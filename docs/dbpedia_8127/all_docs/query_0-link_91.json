I have known Professor Marc Depaepe for many years: in the beginning at quite a distance, since he was one of the select company of star research professors appointed permanently through the Flemish Fund for Scientific Research in Belgium. These professors were, so to speak, “untouchable” and we, “the rank and file”, respectfully kept our distance. Marc Depaepe’s CV and academic bibliography offer convincing evidence that he is indeed an outstanding researcher. But to be serious, he is not aloof at all. I had the pleasure of getting to know him better during the years in which I was Vice rector for the Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Leuven, and subsequently Rector of the University. In those days, we had a lot of meetings and conversations, mostly about budgetary issues and recruitment policy. I very well remember our long discussions on the start-up of the sub-faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences at the KULAK, the KU Leuven Campus in the city of Kortrijk (WestFlanders). In 2004, Marc agreed to be the first chair of this sub-faculty, a very challenging project indeed. During the five years of his mandate he did pioneering work to establish the new Bachelor study programme on Education Sciences as well as developing a strong research environment in the field of Educational Studies at the KULAK, with particular emphasis on the history of education. Over the years, I have got to know Marc Depaepe more personally as a man who is as good as his word. Our discussions have always been plain and constructive, practically oriented and very flexible. Marc does not consider himself to be the centre of the world. As a true historian, he has the capacity to put everything into perspective, especially his own person and work, with a balanced sense of humour and a delicate touch of irony which are also present in his publications. These characteristics of his personality, and perhaps also the fact that we are contemporaries from the same region, have been conducive to our becoming friends. But certainly the fact that we share a common critical attitude in dealing with various scholarly and societal issues – such as history, culture and education – has led up to a spontaneous recognition, which has hitherto stimulated us to undertake common projects. In 2010, we both spent a short study period at the marvellous Centro Internacional de la Cultura Escolar (CEINCE) in Berlanga de Duero, a charming village located in the province of Soria, Castilla y León, Spain. The director of that study centre, Professor Agustín Escolano Benito from the Universidad de Valladolid, was our generous\n\nBetween educationalization and appropriation\n\nhost and offered us a lot of facilities to do research on the dissemination of political and religious ideas through books and school manuals in different societies, cultures and times. As a matter of fact, this phenomenon represents an aspect of the main theme of this volume which deals with the area Between Educationalization and Appropriation. This book is a compilation of various articles which Professor Depaepe has written and published since 1997. It is a representative mirror of his scholarly research work achieved in the past more than three decades. But why a book like this? It is a longstanding tradition within historical research to edit special collections of articles on the occasion of specific commemorations, such as the jubilee of the foundation of prestigious institutions. However, the learned community used to look askance at this kind of occasional publication which was considered as the product of “like breeds like”. Fortunately, in recent years this suspicious attitude has changed into a more positive view of such anthologies which usually offer an interesting sample of the state of affairs in a scholarly discipline. Moreover, scientific communities, especially in the Humanities and Social Sciences, produce to an increasing degree Festschriften and Libri amicorum for the celebration of the special birthdays of striking personalities, or when professors are accorded emeritus status. Some ‘stars’ do not hesitate to market their ‘academic memoirs’. In the field of the history of education reference can be made to the recent book edited by Wayne Urban who collected some thirty essays written by different leading scholars in the historical study of American education, focusing on the origins and growth of their personal scientific interests.1 Although the autobiographical scope might provide interesting points of departure for sound reflection on the reception and effects of education and educational systems, this approach is neither the ambition nor the perspective of the present volume as prepared by Marc Depaepe. Otherwise, this collection of articles might be characterised in a sense as a festschrift, since its author will celebrate his 60th birthday in 2013. Moreover, at the close of the 2011-2012 academic year, he has looked back on a 25-year-long well spent teaching career. Between Educationalization and Appropriation is definitely conceived as a reader. It is a book not to put on the bookshelves but to work with. On the one hand, it is a brilliant sample of the varied research that Professor Depaepe has hitherto completed in his academic life. The book is a 1\n\nWayne J. Urban (Ed.), Leaders in the Historical Study of American Education. Rotterdam/Boston/ Taipei: Sense Publishers, 2011. – It is interesting to notice that Marc Depaepe is one of the few international scholars mentioned in Urban’s anthology as a star researcher in the historical study on education: see the contribution by Sol Cohen, “Memoir. A Mosaic of Memory”, p. 41.\n\n6\n\nForeword\n\ncompelling introduction to his research topics as well as the methodology that this passionate scholar has developed. Reading Depaepe is an invitation to share in his passionate search for knowledge based on long-term highquality research. On the other hand, the materials he has collected in the present study are intended to be used in educational historiography. In fact, many of his articles originated in the interactive process between research and teaching which marks the essence of university education as the act of shaping independent critical minds. With regard to educational historiography, this topic is part of the international Master of Science in Educational Studies which was set up at the University of Leuven in the 1990s. Marc Depaepe has devoted a lot of time and energy to the development of this specialized master programme, first as coordinator (2000-2001) and subsequently as programme director and head of the Department of Educational Sciences (2001-2004). Professor Depaepe is a Master in the full sense of the word. He has reached the highest level of ability in the field of Educational Studies, a researcher who is qualified to train students at all levels in such a way that they feel incited to act according to their knowledge. Policymakers in higher education and university governors often theorise ad nauseam about the three pillars of the University’s mission: scholarly research, academic education, and social service. However, this segmentation risks to become qualifying for the academic career to such an extent that it ends up in pigeon-holing the range of duties for professors and lecturers. Depaepe practises an inclusive approach integrating the three basic components into one dynamic force field. The interactive process between his research and teaching, as mentioned above, evolves with changing effects on society, especially in the area of educational practices. The present collection of studies clearly reflects this synergetic methodology. In what follows, I will try to clarify this on the basis of a brief description of some dimensions of his academic work. As far as research is concerned, the extensive list of Depaepe’s publications reveals six main topics that have been developed over the years. Each of these occurs in one form or another in this book. At the very beginning of his research career, Marc Depaepe took an active interest in the history of education. In particular, he focused on primary education in the 19th and 20th centuries in Belgium. This topic was studied in his master’s thesis (1977) and has remained at the centre of his research interest. His doctoral project ended in a PhD dissertation (1982) in which the history of education was supplemented with a focus on the international debate concerning the theoretical and methodological aspects of the historiography of the 7\n\nBetween educationalization and appropriation\n\neducational dimension strictly speaking. This facet continues to determine his research and teaching to this day. In 1989, Depaepe submitted an additional doctoral dissertation – the so-called “Special Doctorate” that then still existed for ‘scientific’ academic degrees unlike legal’ degrees which knew only one doctoral degree. In this study, he introduced the dimension of the history of science in the area of psychology and educational sciences. He more specifically approached the topic from a comparative point of view for which he studied the German, Anglo-American and French models. A fourth topic in Depaepe’s research has been developed since the 1990s. More particularly, it concerns the history of colonial education, with a special focus on the Belgian Congo. More recently, this subject has been expanded with the history of migration (mainly in Northern France) and the specific role of education in the encounter of hybrid cultures. Finally, together with his research team he has produced a number of tools, inter alia to achieve statistic studies in the field of Belgian history of education. All in all, he is a team player, one who inspires and incites his teammates. It is clear that Professor Depaepe is also a leading scholar on the international scene of the history of education. He has been successively Secretary (1989-1991) and President (1991-1994) of the International Standing Conference for the History of Education (ISCHE),. Moreover, he was a founding member and Vice president of the Internationale Gesellschaft für Historische und Systematische Schulbuchforschung (1997-2007). Finally, since 2005 he has been Co-Editor-in-Chief of the authoritative international journal Paedagogica Historica. However, his scientific services are not restricted to the societies and journal mentioned above. Depaepe has been active in more than forty countries, in the farthest corners of the globe, as an adviser and a member of various editorial boards, as a wellknown congress participant and a lecturer, a “missionary”, as it were, of the New Cultural History of Education. All these activities have resulted in a large number of publications in 17 different languages. International recognition has come with his admission as a member of the International Academy of Education, of which he has recently been appointed to the Board of Directors. The global dimension of Marc Depaepe’s scholarly work is certainly appreciated by his international students in the Master of Science in Educational Studies at the University of Leuven. In particular, the part on the colonial and post-colonial educational experiences catches their attention, not just because the study of these aspects is extremely helpful to recognising configurations of our ‘modern society’, but also because it is very useful to unmask the ‘system errors’ of their own education. In this 8\n\nForeword\n\nrespect, the teaching of this subject contributes to effective development cooperation. On the other hand, Depaepe’s teaching of international students is a breeding ground for promising doctoral students who, for their part, are trained to become competent actors for change in educational systems in their home countries. As I have mentioned before, the volume written by Professor Depaepe is a book to work with and not to put on the bookshelves. The most important value of the book is definitely its demystifying force. Let me try to describe how I understand this. According to the title, the author concentrates on two basic notions running through the book and linking the various parts of it: ‘educationalization’ and ‘appropriation’. These key concepts are clearly explained in the introduction to the book. They crystallise Depaepe’s theory-conscious approach to the history of education in favour of which he strongly argues. Although he is extremely reticent about learning a lesson from the past, his studies spread the encouraging message that education is functioning no matter how, not necessarily according to what policymakers, educationists or researchers have in their minds about education, but at least in the direction of gaining a clear understanding into the human condition. Education and the school as institution are indispensable tools of self-realization through disclosing enlightening. As Immanuel Kant stated: “Aufklärung ist der Ausgang des Menschen aus seiner selbstverschuldeten Unmündigkeit. Unmündigkeit ist das Unvermögen, sich seines Verstandes ohne Leitung eines anderen zu bedienen.”2\n\nIn sum, whichever way you look at the idea of school education, there is probably no model other than ‘educationalization’ and ‘appropriation’ to explain its fundamentals. It is the merit of Marc Depaepe and his book to have proved this beyond doubt. In addition, he rightly emphasizes the constant need to demythologize thought as self-discourse, since history is mainly shaped through structural processes instead of individuals. The idea of a ‘personal subject’ is largely created by Modernity, as Depaepe’s study tries to demonstrate. According to the author, this applies not only to the history of education but to educational historiography as well. In stating this, he puts his own contribution into perspective. What one says in a book’s foreword does matter. I would therefore like to conclude by expressing my deepest appreciation to Professor Depaepe for the invaluable work he has achieved in recent years in which he has built up “Beantwortung der Frage: Was ist Aufklärung?” in Berlinische Monatsschrift, december 1784\n\n2\n\n9\n\nBetween educationalization and appropriation\n\na long-standing reputation as a dedicated scholar and teacher. I also wish to show my esteem and gratitude for his commitment to our university and its community. And, over and above this, I am extremely grateful for his loyalty and generosity, his trust and humour that make life much more pleasant. Finally, a special acknowledgment is due to Leuven University Press for having accepted this volume for publication in its prestigious collections of international standing. Thanks are extended to UPL’s manager Ms Marike Schipper and her staff for their meticulous publishing activities. I do hope that the present book as a selection from the voluminous scholarly work of an international celebrity in the field of the history of education will be widely distributed and above all enthusiastically accepted by scholars and students. Marc Vervenne Honorary Rector of the University of Leuven (KU Leuven) Professor of Biblical Studies at the Faculty of Theology and Religious Studies\n\n10\n\nIntroduction As is explained in the Foreword by the former Rector of the KU Leuven, for which I am, of course, very grateful, this book has been published for mainly two reasons: a scientific and an educational one. A scientific one, because it gives a state of the art of my research and an educational one, because it can be used for teaching purposes in the international programs of our university, which wants to base its teaching on research. The title of this reader, Between Educationalization and Appropriation, refers to two key-concepts of my writings on the history of education. In a nutshell, it boils down to this: over the last few centuries, education has set itself up as a major player in the modernisation of society. The school was the socialization institute par excellence, through which the coming generations were to find their place. So it was that education and teaching proved not to be aimed primarily at equality of opportunity or emancipation of the masses, but rather at social control, disciplining and standardization of behavior. Just as pupils had to learn to write between the lines of their exercise books at school, so this institution had taken on the task of seeing to it that its students conducted themselves within the bounds of what was morally desirable and socially acceptable. The impulsive brute violence of the masses had to be tamed, come what may, and the revolutionary potential of the lower classes kept in check or suppressed. In colonial and post-colonial contexts – the historical configuration with which several of the graduates of the program will identify themselves – this socialization took on an extra dimension, in the sense that from the outset it also prevailed as a kind of “civilizing offensive”. Western civilization, which was deemed to be superior, had to be disseminated to so-called “underdeveloped” regions, often as a subcomponent of a more wide-ranging understanding of missionary work and evangelization. Nevertheless, this modernization, or as the case may be “educationalization” (or “pedagogization” – neologisms derived from the German Pädagogisierung), did not immediately imply the pursuit of equality. Rather, the reverse was true: the question as to how far we could, ought to and were allowed to go in this respect was forever lurking just around the corner. The indigenous population was as a rule not expected to play a top-rank role in the social “progress” that was being made. As docile helpers in that process, they were sooner to be kept within a kind of arm’s-length proximity… It is also for this reason that the concept of educationalization in the history of education literature has generally\n\nBetween educationalization and appropriation\n\ntaken on a rather negative connotation. And nonetheless there was a positive side inevitably attached to that educational action – albeit mostly in the form of “unintended side effects”, according to the insights of HeinzElmar Tenorth, my colleague from the Humboldt University at Berlin (see chapter 6). With the imparting of knowledge, pupils and students (both here and abroad) not only gained an understanding of all kinds of social structures (including the educational structures in which they had ended up), but also developed tools enabling them to think for themselves (as well as the taste for doing so!), something that cannot be kept in check, let alone controlled, by any disciplining, standardizing or civilizing authority or any other power whatsoever. This partly explains why all dictatorial systems are eventually susceptible to implosion from within. So let that also be a part of the joy we are sharing in today; like it or not, education and teaching always have had an emancipating effect, even though it was difficult to plan what the final result of this would be. In no case did it follow the rules laid down by the policymakers. The same applies, mutatis mutandis, to the second concept – appro­ priation. This, too, is generally viewed in a negative light, since “appro­ priation” usually means lack or loss of authenticity, certainly when it is associated with the confrontation of different cultures. But, in view of the modernization processes, was there another way than imposing the grammar of “schooling” as the backbone of “emancipation”? - the highly cultivated dream of Enlightenment, summarized by Immanuel Kant with the slogan: “dare to think”. From the neo-colonial perspective of Western superiority the history of education was traditionally seen as a “history of adaptation and assimilation”, whereby the best pupils at the time – for example in the Belgian Congo – were regarded as “évolués” (and therefore possibly also as “half-civilized” and/or “uprooted”, see part III). Nonetheless, historical research has made equally important subtle distinctions in this stereotypical interpretation, not only in relation to the question as to whether modernization and metropolization was in fact avoidable, but also, and in particular, as regards the wealth of “inverse” effects of the African confrontation with modernity. Who did (or did not) learn from whom and why? Globalisation is indeed quite simply impossible without “glocalisation”, as my German colleague Jürgen Schriewer (also form the Humboldt University at Berlin) once very aptly put it (see also chapter 6). And it is on account of this very embedding in the individual’s own culture that the door to creative and authentic education and training of the person is set ajar. For within the scope of the historical processes of 12\n\nIntroduction\n\ncultural hybridity, there is nonetheless still a narrow (perhaps indeed too narrow) space for tinkering with and fixing fragmentary selves. Not that, as a researcher of the history of education, I am looking for “lessons” from the past. Quite the contrary (see part V). If the history of our discipline “teaches” something, it is that, by itself wanting to form part of educational research, it has become far too alienated from social and cultural history. This is why at every moment I have deemed opportune, I have pointed out the importance of but also the need for historicizing the educational past. After all, we will not escape from history by taking it out of the game … But on a celebratory occasion such as this – the publication of my “selected writings” - the optimistic message of the benefits of education in the past – the Janus face over which traditional “history of education” has all too often stumbled – may perhaps for once prevail over the necessity for historical contextualization, qualification and interpretation… As it has already been said, the same message, couched in terms of the twin concepts of “educationalization” and “appropriation”, serves at the basis of my teachings in the international courses at Leuven, in the master programs of educational studies as well as European studies. As is noted in the official course descriptions, it is one of the essential goals for the students to master these concepts in order to be able to see within the complex forms of historical evolutions in education some general patterns, but also and foremost to be able to contextualize them against different cultural backgrounds (so that they can understand similarities as well as differences between the educational system in their home countries and the situation here). In view of this general aim, this book is divided into five parts. Each part contains four to six “chapters” that have been selected from my publication list (i.e. articles that have been published elsewhere and of which I am the author or a co-author). In sum 23 articles have been selected. The first part deals with Belgian and Flemish developments – a ‘local’ starting point for the introduction of concepts that apply to Western histories of education in general. To get an idea of the impact of the phenomenon of schooling in Western society, it seems advisable to start with a concrete case. The first article deals, in a nutshell, with the role of education since the Middle Ages, while the second focuses on the 1930s. The ‘interbellum’ was indeed the period par excellence in which the phenomenon of educationalization manifested itself, not only in Belgium, but also in the 13\n\nBetween educationalization and appropriation\n\nsurrounding countries. This was also the case with the ongoing feminization of the education profession. According to our interpretation the process of feminization is closely related to that of educationalization, which can be regarded, in itself, as a subcategory of a bigger modernization process in which schooling played a central role. This ‘modernization’ took shape from the 17th and 18th centuries onwards and, therefore, is essential to a course that deals with the making of ‘modern’ educational systems. Hence, the first part is named: ‘from schooling to educationalization’. In the second part we delve deeper into the origins and characteristics of educationalization, also from the point of view of etymology. Lying at the basis of our research, the articles describe, some of the developments that can be covered by the label ‘educationalization’ and try to relate it to the features of our ‘post-modern’ society. As it turns out, professionalization of the field was crucial to educationalization. It is self-evident that this professionalization was closely related to the development of educational research, educational studies and educational as well as general psychology. All of this can be amply illustrated by the colonial experience in education to which we devote our third part. Analyses of the educational development of the former Belgian Congo – the present-day Democratic Republic of Congo – show to what extent modernization processes like civilization and educationalization took root ‘under pressure’ (historically as well as materially) in the colonial context. Therefore, the history of the colonial educational past, even more than that of Western educational history in general, reveals the systematic difficulties and pedagogical paradoxes of the ‘modern’ educational project (e.g. docility vs. autonomy). In view of the assessment of the ‘appropriation’ of metropolitan ideas and ideals in an African context – ‘glocalization’ is seen here as an essential part of the ‘globalization’ process – these studies will certainly interest international students. In the fourth part we analyze the ‘appropriation’ process within the framework of educational theory formation, education science building, as well as in the educational praxis itself. Two good examples are, on the one hand, the way in which Darwinism was treated and, on the other hand, the way in which the New Education movement created its own selfdiscourse, often far away from (and opposite to) what really happened in everyday educational life… From a current history of science perspective, we will ‘demythologize’ former (and often too simple) rhetorics about 14\n\nIntroduction\n\nthe ‘glorious’ role of education (and educational research in particular) in the modernization of society – the rhetoric of a so-called ‘new’ (i.e. ‘child-centered’) education theory not excluded. The domain of school architecture is only one of the many examples. The most striking example, however, may be the use of ‘educational’ psychology under the Nazi-regime in Germany. Needless to say, the approach we have used in our research does not fit into the old historiographic (even hagiographic) framework of ‘great men’ and their ‘great ideas’ that have led to continuous progress in the educational field. Our articles are, all in all, attempts to realize some of the challenges of the so-called ‘new cultural history of education’. In the fifth and last part, I have collected some theoretical, methodological, and historiographical chapters that illustrate how we have conceived this job and how specialists as well as the public have reacted to this attempt. I really hope the public will enjoy reading and studying all these chapters. Some of them have been coauthored by colleagues. It is self-evident that I remain grateful to all of them. This especially applies to Frank Simon, with whom I have worked from the outset of my career (see chapter 23). For pragmatic as well as historical reasons the notes and/or references (including the once used system) were kept in their original form.

Depaepe\n\nIt is not easy, within the limited space of this introduction, to paint a sufficiently finely-differentiated picture of the story of education. Nevertheless, we shall venture to do that in the guidebook for this museum. The idea we should like to emphasize is the central role played by the school in the modernisation of society. Given the broad reach of that process, we shall not adopt an exclusively Belgian or Flemish standpoint, and foreign visitors will have no difficulty in finding, both in the museum itself and in this museum guide, similarities with the history of education in their own countries. This angle on modernisation also has the consequence that our interest is centred above all on the continued expansion of the educational system over recent centuries, mainly at the level of primary education.\n\n❙❙ The Church Takes the Forefront Even though, in ancient culture, the school had already carved out for itself an undisputed place within society, it was only in the Middle Ages that it took root in our regions. In fact, the relatively highly developed school system of ancient times collapsed during the course of the fifth century with the fall of the Western Roman Empire. But soon, the need for a written code made itself felt within the Church, which, partly because abbeys used to act as intellectual magnets, became seen as the sole heir of late classical culture. The written word made it possible to express collective memory in a more objective way than did an oral code, and thus facilitated the handing-down of the Christian message. The Church organised teaching within institutions which came into being between the sixth and the twelfth centuries – the abbey schools (at Corbie, for instance, near to Amiens), the cathedrals (for example in Rheims, Chartres, Cologne and Liège), the chapter houses (at Leuven, for instance, and at leper) and parishes (in a * Originally published in: Guide of the Municipal Education Museum of Ypres (Ieper, Stedelijke Musea, 1999) 3-20. 23\n\nPart I. Starting from the Belgian Case – from Schooling to Educationalization\n\nlarge number of non-collegiate parish churches). Since all these institutions were intended for the training of the clergy in the broadest sense, education there was placed under the seal of religious practice, such as the teaching of prayers and Gregorian plainsong. In addition, the most advanced institutions practised the ‘seven liberal arts’ – grammar, rhetoric, dialectics, music, geometry, arithmetic and astronomy. But ultimately, even this teaching had a religious end in view: in fact, the existence of mediaeval man was imbued with the Christian ideal of salvation, which was to find its culmination in the Beyond. It was for this reason that secular learning, a not inconsiderable part of which consisted of knowledge accumulated and disseminated by Arabs and Jews, was to become placed within a higher divine wisdom. Between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries, a number of new trends appeared, which were linked with the rise of the towns. For instance, in Paris and Bologna, originating respectively from the cathedral school and the city’s public Latin school, we see the development of the first universities, which, in the second half of the twelfth century, demanded their independence from the religious and secular authorities. In our regions, it was in 1425 that a university of this type was founded in Leuven – also known as a studium generale. In cities, centres of trade and industry, the secular authorities took a hand in the setting up and running of Latin schools. Side by side with them, there appeared schools which provided an opportunity to acquire more practical knowledge.1 So far as the training of tradesmen went, this did not take place within a school setting but took the form of a guild apprenticeship.\n\n❙❙ In the Service of the ‘True Faith’ As is well known, it was the Reformation which put an end to the religious unity of western Europe. Following the work of a number of reformers, a variety of religious persuasions and church communities sprang up during the first half of the sixteenth century. The Catholic Church reacted to this threat by launching a Counter-Reformation, which drew its ideas from the Council of Trent (1545-1563). Right up to the twentieth century, this movement was to leave a deep mark on the face of the Church, 1\n\nIn some cases, this made it possible to raise school attendance to a perceptible degree. For instance, in Florence around 1330, almost one in three of six-to-fifteen-year-olds was already going to school. See L. Haas, The Renaissance Man and his Children. Childbirth and Early Childhood in Florence, 1300-1600, New York, 1998. 24\n\nThe School, Cornerstone of Modern Society\n\nwhich assumed a strongly centralised and hierarchical character, placing an emphasis on the authority of the Pope. A close interest was taken in education at all levels in order to protect the ‘true faith’. Founded in 1534, the Jesuit order played a decisive role in secondary education for boys. Its colleges became not only the prototype for subsequent classical humanities, giving pre-eminence to the qualities of pietas et eloquentia (virtue and eloquence), but also foreshadowed school structures and features which were later to be predominant at practically every level of education, including the primary school. In these institutions, which were cut off from the world, places of control and discipline, a whole range of devices for fostering competition were put into service for purely ‘schoolish’ ends, such as the earning of distinctions, which were awarded to the most outstanding pupils. The closed system of the boarding schools, where only Latin was taught, and within which every effort was made to imitate the Roman (in other words pagan!) world in order to mould ardent Catholics, was, in the final analysis, oriented upon the ‘modern’ principles of disciplined education: watching over children, accustoming them to strictness, placing an emphasis on obedience to ethical rules and on presenting the innocence of childhood, and encouraging behaviour that carried the stamp of reserve. In primary education, it was just as important to serve true religion: the Roman faith in those countries which had remained Catholic, and the reformed faith in the others. This explains the great importance attached to the catechism, the close watch which the church authorities held over the ‘lower’ schools, and also the efforts expended by nuns, mainly in towns, to organise education for girls. In the countryside, education remained in the hands of schoolmasters, often sextons, whose main task was to inculcate religion and high moral standards.\n\n❙❙ The Modernisation of Education In many respects, the closing decades of the eighteenth century ushered in a series of social changes. In the field of education, the ideas of the Enlightenment and Romanticism were at the root of a hitherto unknown pedagogical optimism which made itself felt in the work of philosophers such as Immanuel Kant in Germany and Jean-Jacques Rousseau in France, to mention only two. This whole stream of thought was summed up in the catch-phrase ‘knowledge is virtue’, implicit in which was the widely extended reach, the modernisation and the secularisation of education. 25\n\nPart I. Starting from the Belgian Case – from Schooling to Educationalization\n\nLeading thinkers began – and this was relatively new – to look upon education as a means of freeing men from the ascendancy of religious authority, reducing their dependency and fostering social change. In short, a means of creating new men in a new society. In reality, all this has not always resulted in what those great thinkers had hoped for. As time went by, it turned out that education had a dynamic of its own, which produced and reproduced social inequalities, for the greatest benefit of the upper social classes, and of the bourgeoisie in particular. The broadening of the range of educational supply, following a growing consensus over the need to provide school courses more or less targeted on preparing young people to carry out tasks and functions in society, did not fundamentally change the ideology of education at the end of the eighteenth century. Educational courses were linked with careers, vocational groups and status, and this gave rise to a hierarchical structure within education itself. In order to counter the risks of social disintegration, middle-class virtues were also inculcated upon the lower classes, mainly through the Volksschule or ‘school for the people’, which, in the case of Germany and the Netherlands, where educational thought was most responsive, was increasingly run by a state placed above the various classes and religious persuasions. Furthermore, the civilising inroads made by the middle classes at the close of the eighteenth century and at the beginning of the nineteenth century gave rise to processes which had more to do with infantilisation, standardisation and discipline than with the emancipation extolled by the Enlightenment philosophers. Certainly, it is untrue to say, as is often heard, that the ‘discovery’ of childhood as a distinct age of life occurred only at the end of the seventeenth and at the beginning of the eighteenth centuries. But it is nonetheless true that the greater interest devoted to children and young people led to the ‘little ones’ being increasingly isolated from the ‘adult’ world. It was above all the children from middle-class backgrounds who were the first to be able to, or have to undergo the ‘beneficial’ influence of civilisation, and who were exposed to an educational organisation of childhood. This occurred not only through the agency of the school and the boarding system – which, from the time of the humanists, had been the educational cocoon par excellence – but also in the private sphere, where a relatively distinct world was created to the child’s scale. The emergence of a specific and moralising literature for children and young people, together with the development of\n\n26\n\nThe School, Cornerstone of Modern Society\n\na huge toy industry centred upon Thüringen, Seiffen and Nuremberg, are other phenomena which may illustrate this trend.2 How were the principles of the Enlightenment given concrete form in our regions? Under Austrian rule, the Empress Maria Theresa, within the framework of her general cultural policy, took care to advance education in the Hapsburg-governed Netherlands, but solely from the standpoint of an ‘Aufklärung’ reinterpreted through Catholic thinking. Even though the idea was spreading that the state should play a more active role, for the time being the Church retained control of education. Not only did a statute of 1774 aiming to reorganise education for ordinary people in our regions remain a dead letter, but at the start of the 1770s, Latin teaching (for boys) was almost entirely in the hands of the clergy: the Jesuits had seventeen colleges, the Augustinians and the Franciscans had around ten each, the Oratorians seven and the Dominicans three. However, it was in this very sector that state education was to be established for the first time. The suppression of the Jesuit order in 1773 was the occasion for the founding of colleges known as royal (or Theresian) colleges. So far as the curriculum was concerned, these state institutions clearly reflected some new emphases in accordance with the utilitarian ideology of the time, but this did not prevent Latin from continuing to take the lion’s share for itself. Moreover, although they were state-run, these colleges retained a marked religious character: 56% of teachers were priests or other members of religious orders in 1779 and as many as 66% in 1792.3 Maria Theresa’s enlightened policy provoked much resistance. What the people found it hardest to accept was her interference in the Church’s affairs. Opposition was at its height after the ascent to power of Joseph II in 1780. The new sovereign wished to move rapidly to a series of reforms, such as the suppression of contemplative religious orders, the setting-up of a general seminary to train priests, and the modernisation of administrative and legal institutions.\n\nThis growing pedagogical trend within society is apparent not only with regard to children: this process also affected adults. For further information about this, see M. Depaepe, De pedagogisering achterna. Aanzet tot een genealogie van de pedagogische mentaliteit in de voorbije 250 jaar, Leuven, 1998, from which this article draws to a great extent. 3 Other data relating to this will be found in the overview articles by M. De Vroede, published in Algemene Geschiedenis der Nederlanden, vol. XI (Bussum, 1983) 60-69 & 128-144, vol. XIII (Haarlem, 1978) 111-125 & 328-351. 2\n\n27\n\nPart I. Starting from the Belgian Case – from Schooling to Educationalization\n\n❙❙ The Aftermath of the French Revolution Under French rule, too (1795-1814), the bourgeois authorities made every effort to maximise their control over the running of the school system, without, however gaining a real monopoly hold over it. The Constitution of the Directory (1795-1799) in fact made provision for freedom of education. Despite the revolutionary determination to abolish the old order, the new institutions (primary schools, central schools and special schools) had some difficulty in developing. The écoles centrales or ‘central schools’ alone experienced a degree of success, for the most part with the middle class. Nine in number, one for each département, they were placed under the control of the provincial administrations. As for the subjects taught, Latin (which did remain on the curriculum) lost some of its importance to the natural sciences. With their very encyclopaedic courses of study, these schools made a structural break with the year-group system which had been normal practice in the Jesuit colleges. But after the Concordat of 1801 signed by Napoleon and the Pope, there was a return, at primary education level, to the situation before the French Revolution, where central government had no role. Religion gradually regained its primacy within a curriculum which was still very limited, even though no provision had in fact been made for religious studies in the legislation in force in 1802. On the contrary, the teaching of religion was introduced by the decree of 17 March 1808, which established the imperial university and thus strengthened bureaucratic control over education. This ‘university’ was, in fact, to draw together every initiative in education, at whatever level. At the same time, a number of different entrepreneurs made an appearance on the primary education ‘market’ – innovators who, alongside the traditional schoolmasters, enabled private education to undergo a considerable expansion, despite state control. Their teaching, however, remained basic, given that there existed no college capable of training future teachers, in contrast with the German model. It is therefore hardly surprising that under French rule, illiteracy tended to rise rather than fall. In the second half of the eighteenth century, it seems that in rural areas, scarcely 50 to 60% of men and 15 to 30% of women knew how to write their names. Under the Napoleonic régime, the central schools were subsequently replaced by lycées – schools of this type were founded in Brussels, Gent and Liège between 1802 and 1804, and at Brugge in 1808. Unlike the central schools, the lycées also brought in priests to teach religion, which regained its place. Latin once again became the subject with greatest prestige; nevertheless the lycées did not abandon the mathematical bias of the central schools. The curriculum also included 28\n\nThe School, Cornerstone of Modern Society\n\nmilitary training. The secondary schools, which were run at one stage by the communes, and at another by private enterprise, continued to exist alongside the lycées.\n\n❙❙ In the General Interest It was not until the period of Dutch rule (1815-1830) that there was a perceptible shift in government policy on education, which from that time onwards was to advance the prosperity and the education of the people. Schooling for ordinary people was, in fact a priority of the enlightened policy of William I, all the more so as the Southern Netherlands had a long way to catch up on the Northern Netherlands in this area. In the view of William I, it was a task for the state and no longer the Church to develop public education. Priests, however, could share in the task, insofar as they behaved like other state employees. In 1817, the government set up two colleges with the purpose of training future primary teachers: one in Haarlem and the other in Lier. In addition there were the ‘atheneums’ (state schools for full secondary education), municipal colleges and ‘state universities’ – three in the north and three in the south (Leuven, Liège and Gent) – along with special schools for science, trade and industry, in order to meet the needs of the Industrial Revolution. The resources allocated by the authorities in this area are very well illustrated by the fact that in this period the Netherlands was spending much more money than France on education. Some sources indicate that 1,146 school premises were built or renovated for primary education between 1817 and 1828, and the numbers on roll in the municipal schools increased by around 60%. But what is even more important than these facts and figures, which must be treated with caution, is the qualitative development of education. In addition to its religious purpose, little by little the ‘people’s school’ was increasingly given a more ‘educational’ task: it had to produce docile, honest and hard-working citizens. For this, the school employed a whole series of methods: an expanded curriculum spread across a well-balanced timetable of activities, more effective educational methods such as simultaneous education given from the front of the room (which implicated the use of standard textbooks, reading tables, wall charts, the blackboard, rows of benches in the classroom, and sets of weights and measures) together with an entire school ‘liturgy’ of rituals, including a broad range of teachers’ rewards and punishments (such as good and black marks etc.). This, then, was the end of the individual and ineffective teaching which had been widespread till 29\n\nPart I. Starting from the Belgian Case – from Schooling to Educationalization\n\nthen, with the schoolmaster calling the children out one by one to recite their lessons in front of him, while the others argued, played or had fights. Teaching from the front of the class seemed to reflect a natural order within an integral and organic society, and helped to instil ‘shared virtues’ such as a sense of duty and self-control.\n\n❙❙ The School as Vehicle for Socialisation It goes without saying that this change in outlook did not occur without setbacks. After the Belgian Revolution of 1830, there were still to be regular protests against this modernisation of education. Nevertheless, the trend was irreversible. It became deeply rooted almost everywhere in Europe in the middle of the nineteenth century. At a time when the liberal system had passed its highest point, the bourgeois values of sobriety, moderation, hard work and self-discipline continued to provide the norms which guided educational practice (whether or not they drew upon religious convictions). Education had proved to be effective methods for channelling and neutralising working-class resistance, in particular by promoting the assimilation of working-class children into the bourgeoisie. In fact, the more widely the bourgeois cultural model was adopted, the more the individual would be taken for someone who was courteous, civilised and perfectly behaved. For this reason, the burgeoning workers’ movement was unable to prevent this wish to rise through the social hierarchy from gradually marginalising a genuine working-class culture. During the course of the nineteenth century, education, which remained strongly permeated by social differences, became a powerful vehicle for socialisation: primary, or ‘popular’ education was designed for the lower classes (in Germany, moreover, the primary school was called the Volksschule) whereas higher education was reserved for the ruling classes. As for secondary education, it could serve at one and the same time as a springboard for the tertiary level and as a leaving qualification for upper-middle class pupils. The public schools in England were typical examples of these élite schools. It was only in the second half of the nineteenth century that education was increasingly looked upon as a lever for setting a social dynamic in motion. However, there was still not any question of a thorough democratisation of schools. On the one hand, far too many workers’ children had still, in fact, to break off their schooling too soon, and it was necessary to wait for the abolition of child labour and the introduction of compulsory education (Prussia: 1763; Denmark: 1814; Switzerland: 1874; Britain: 1880; France: 30\n\nThe School, Cornerstone of Modern Society\n\n1882; Netherlands: 1901; Belgium: 1914; Finland: 1921) in order to halt this phenomenon. On the other hand, the growing diversification of educational courses, which met the needs of the industrialisation process, strengthened the hierarchical and compartmentalised vertical structure of schools. Thus, in almost every country in Europe there emerged various forms of vocational and technical education which were aimed as a matter of priority at certain population groups, while new educational courses designed for the middle and lower classes were created within secondary education itself, such as the state schools for lower secondary education in Belgium or hbs education (secondary schools with a programme of 3 to 5 years) in the Netherlands. At the same time, girls’ education fell into a distinct category, given the specific role which society required women to play. There was the same form of hierarchical structure, ranging from the home-centred, bourgeois ideal disseminated by secondary schools, and the domestic training (for instance, ordinary dressmaking or cooking) provided in the vocational schools, right through to training for the socalled ‘women’s jobs’ (such as milliner) in technical schools.\n\n❙❙ An Arena for Ideological Conflicts Just as in other European countries, control over primary education in Belgium, which had undergone a considerable expansion since the 1842 compromise agreed between Catholics and liberals,4 was the issue at stake in a political and ideological conflict which affected the whole of society. In the final analysis, this schools war (1879-1884) had much less bearing on the curriculum, in which the liberals wanted to give greater prominence to science than to religion, or on subsidies for Catholic schools, than on the modernisation of the ideology of education. The Catholics advocated a model which, in accordance with tradition, placed moral improvement before the acquisition of knowledge, whereas the liberals, heirs of the Enlightenment, put forward the contrary model. This, too, is the reason why they made every effort to reduce the predominance of Latin in secondary education by introducing new subject options and by combining the study of dead languages with mathematics or science. Between 1843 and 1878, the number of primary schools rose from 2,073 to 4,376, the number of teachers from 8,388 to 11,808, and pupil numbers from 238,439 to 594,338. For lack of space, we will not give other figures here. As for the development of elementary education, we refer the reader to the statistical analysis we have already published with colleagues and collaborators: L. Minten el al., Les statistiques de l’enseignement en Belgique, 4 parts (5 vols.), Brussels, 1991-1996.\n\n4\n\n31\n\nPart I. Starting from the Belgian Case – from Schooling to Educationalization\n\nThis ‘schools issue’ – in which, on the one hand, non-Catholics stood for a neutral education built upon scientific and secularised foundations and run by the state or local authorities, while the Catholics supported denominational, state-subsidised education with a religious tone – remained a source of latent tension, and underlay the whole of educational policy development in Belgium. Moreover, in the 1950s, the left (made up of liberals and socialists) and the right (the Catholics) were to clash once again when a second schools war broke out, in which the main issue was the subsidising and the institutionalisation of the state schools for lower secondary education and technical education. Nevertheless, this ideological debate was also overlaid by the growing professionalisation of the teachers, who themselves took up a position based on the more scientific nature of educational theory. A clear consensus, which went beyond political and ideological lines, thus emerged on the issue of the nature of education. The superiority of simultaneous methods and the so-called learning conversation, which, through the technique of guided questions, enabled the teacher to suggest to the pupil the correct response, and which was based on principles such as the clarity of the exposition and the value of individual work, was not called into question, nor was the concentric structure of the subject and the curriculum, leading outwards from alreadyfamiliar material, nor was the distribution of pupils into age-based and level-based classes or year groups, nor again, separation of the sexes (with the emergence of an increasingly female teaching profession as an indirect consequence).\n\n❙❙ The Schooling Society The effect of all these developments was to clear the way not only for the expansion of education – before the First World War, the Catholics had taken advantage of their political power in Belgium in order to perceptibly expand the network of denominational schools at every level – but also for the elaboration of the schoolish character of education. This last-mentioned phenomenon was further strengthened by the introduction of compulsory education and a determination to make the primary school a ‘school for life’; this, however, was not done without a degree of moralistic bias (school savings, school mutual benefit societies, manual work, household tasks, health education, gymnastics, an awareness of the world, etc.). Undoubtedly, this movement drew in part upon thinking about the ‘new school’ and upon a number of educational reforms, but in actual practice 32\n\nThe School, Cornerstone of Modern Society\n\nthe revolutionary potential of these theoretical ideas was widely thwarted or reduced to a bare minimum. Moreover, educational reform, by insisting on the child’s individuality, merely infantilised children, as is shown, amongst other things, by the introduction of Froebel methods in infant schools, and the very artificial nature of cloyingly sentimental literature for children and the very young. At university level, the spread of educational intervention was justified above all by a naïve belief in the possibility of a scientific theory of education, in which the favoured methods were experiments, tests and statistics. This concern to quantify education continued to be apparent after the First World War, especially in the United Stales. In fact, the ideology of iq fitted neatly into a view of the world based on achievement and ability, upon which capitalist and democratic society depended. The idea that merit is a blend of (innate) aptitudes and personal endeavour, and that leadership must be entrusted to the most deserving, justified the perpetuation of a multilevel educational structure with inequalities of status. The ‘childcentred learning’ advocated by reform pedagogues was not sufficiently firmly entrenched to enable it to fundamentally change education, as was demonstrated by the introduction into Belgium of the famous Plan of 1936. The fact that in the interwar years, the old continent had lived under the ascendancy of authoritarian-type, normative educational systems was not, of course, predisposed to change anything whatsoever. But this domination also had the effect that education, much like youth movements, moreover, increasingly fell prey to ideological takeover bids intended to win over and enlist the masses. This was equally true for the proponents of the New Order and for the Catholic Church, which turned into a stronghold of fierce opposition to state authority.\n\n❙❙ A Break with the Past or Continuity After the Second World War, and especially from the sixties on, there was a reaction against authoritarian and traditional educational methods. Out of a concern for ‘true emancipation’, some theorists, mainly drawn from neo-Marxist or psychoanalytical schools of thought, set themselves up as proponents of non-repressive education. Even though more democratic educational methods are now widespread, in the majority of cases we still cannot talk about a reforming alternative to the bourgeois education which has been taking shape since the eighteenth century, with its traditional allocation of roles and its authoritarian relationships. Within education, 33\n\nPart I. Starting from the Belgian Case – from Schooling to Educationalization\n\nwhich has undergone an unprecedented expansion, assumption of mass proportions, and (external) democratisation in the affluent society which followed the Second World War (in Belgium, the percentage of young people of 14 and 15 attending school rose from 69% to 95.5% between 1957 and 1979), the emphasis has continued to be placed on the pursuit of achievement. Overall, every indication, therefore, is that the history of modern education is characterised more by a continuity with the past than by radical breaks. Against this background, therefore, it will readily be understood that an increase in educational opportunities does not in practice automatically mean increased independence for pupils, but rather, it brings with it longer dependency on their part. Then again, it is without doubt also true that no other institution in human memory has succeeded better than the school to bring about the emancipation of the individual, despite all the attempts to control it, and the social pressures that have been brought to bear upon it.\n\n34\n\n2 The Conquest of Youth: an Educational Crusade in Flanders during the Interbellum Period* M. Depaepe & F. Simon\n\nIn Europe between the two World Wars, youth constituted a notable arena for the manifestation of social polarizations. From the 1920s on, the political scene shifted markedly to the right: theories of the New Order proclaimed the failure of parliamentary democracy, and in Italy Fascism (Mussolini in 1922) and in Germany Nazism (Hitler in 1933) acquired real political power. In both countries, an authoritarian state was established and war was proclaimed against the Red Peril of Communism. The youth, as the future cornerstone of the ideology and the regime, was assigned a central part in this process. Groupings attached to the party, such as the Giuventà fascista and the Hitlerjugend, took advantage of the romantic-nationalist roots of the youth movement and developed a resolute cult of leadership and uniforms (Koon 1985; Kock 1979; Stachura 1981; Heideking, Depaepe & Herbst 1997). The same trend also developed in other European countries within the framework of the youth movements. Apart from more or less comparable Fascist organizations, which eventually clashed with the earlier established “red” (or Socialist) and “blue” (or Liberal) youth associations, the European youth work of the interbellum period was obviously strongly encouraged by the Catholic Church. By means of “Catholic Action”, the Church was turned into an anti-secular bastion by Pius XI (1922-1939). With its doctrine of divine revelation, the Catholic Church tried to convert as many “souls” as possible to what it perceived as the only universally and absolutely valid Truth. Although Catholic ideology cannot really be put on a par with the extreme forms of ideological “enticements” of Fascism and Nazism, it is still undeniable that the Catholic Church also launched an offensive at that time to mobilize the “masses” (Balthazar 1994; Fabre & Caillavet 1994). By means of numerous mass organizations – for adults as well as youth – the Church waged war against “impious” Communism with a virtually unprecedented triumphalistic thirst for conquest. Hence * Originally published in: F. SIMON (ed.), Liber Amicorum Karel De Clerck (Gent, C.S.H.P., 2000) 19-42.\n\nPart I. Starting from the Belgian Case – from Schooling to Educationalization\n\nthe slogan, much used at the time, “Rome or Moscow” (Latu 1946). In essence, the Church raved against the decline in morals that seemed to have started in the Roaring Twenties. Catholic Action was embedded in the acceleration of the process of massification (universal franchise, compulsory education, compulsory military service, mass press circulation, and standardized products) that had been in progress since the end of the 19th century. Ideas of progress and emancipation went hand in hand with an irrational fear of insurrection by the masses and of inevitable cultural decline. In daily life, different techniques were used to influence the masses. Particularly during the economic crisis of the 1930s, with its breakdown in the equilibrium between economics and politics, new methods were sought to regulate the “mass” phenomenon. In such a period of incertitude, it is not surprising that people felt threatened in their daily lives and had little ideological resistance to movements that offered them shared group experiences (Reynebau 1994, 12-73). In Flanders in Belgium, where Catholics dominated, common decency was felt to be threatened by ongoing secularization. This trend was seen as a result of the change in the Zeitgeist that occurred after the First World War, to which the contact with other cultures, not in the least by “unbridled” soldiers, had amply contributed (De Borchgraeve 1999). The discourse on increasing moral decay served a grandly orchestrated pedagogical offensive, inside as well as outside the school. In the core of the family, the various youth organizations, and the school, there was a distinct preference for authoritarian education centred on “moral values”. This resulted in a kind of feminization of domestic education and a masculinization of public life that were readily adopted by the youth movements for girls and boys (Simon 1994b, 178-195). A whole army of spiritual caretakers, physicians, hygienists, psychologists, and social workers was ready or getting ready to receive and counsel the young people – especially the boys! – throughout their “strenuous” years of youth. This gave birth to a myriad of books of the type “How Do I Become a Man?” (Foerster 1920). Moreover, psychopedagogical expertise increasingly acquired an institutional basis and was scientifically legitimized in the framework of youth psychology and the development of pedagogical theories. For instance, it is striking how the experimental mainstream, apparently standing surety for the academic professionalism of psychologists and educationalists, was integrated into the Catholic normative-pedagogical system of thought in Flanders (Depaepe 1993). This is actually already one of the points of interest of our article. In the history of youth – which is, by the way, an understudied field in English-language historiography – the interbellum period does, indeed, 36\n\nThe Conquest of Youth\n\nreveal that a core problem like the transition from youth to adulthood is at the basis of an important part of pedagogical theorizing (Dekker & Depaepe 1993, 9-12). At the same time, the case of Flanders demonstrates that nomothetic statements such as the assumption that a specific “youth land” for working-class youngsters was only created in the fifties (Zinnecker 1985, 24-45) need to be qualified. The primary coloration in our contribution is constituted by the approach to this complex process of “educationalization” (Hermann 1986, 661-683; Depaepe 1998b; Depaepe 1999). Can it be explained in function of the dominant social groups wanting to keep and extend their privileged social positions by controlling youth, or was it a much more intricate matter? Without intending to give a definite answer – the research in the history of education, which, up to now, has been not very successful in generating theories about the nature of education (Tenorth 1996, 343361) has certainly to develop in the near future more finely-woven concepts than the monlithic idea of “educationalization” to explain the increased pedagogical influence since the Enlightenment –, we will examine here, how, on the different levels of education (the family, youth work, as well as the school), the rhetoric and reality of the Catholic Restoration Movement in Flanders intermingled. In order to give a more complete image of the educational mentality in the interbellum period – in accordance with the notion histoire totale, derived from the French historical school – we will attempt to bridge the gap between the ideal and the real by using texts of pedagogical opinion setters as well as from the every-day educational reality (Depaepe & Simon 1995, 9-16). Therefore, our contribution can be considered as an attempt to the construction of a “mentality history” in the field of education, whereby the notion of “educational mentality” functions as the possible binder for a better comprehension of the totality of the educational past (Gaus 1975, 403-430; Frijhoff 1992, 614-634; Peeters 1994, 29-32). Indeed the educational mentality constitutes not only a link between the theory-based ‘concepts’ on the one hand, and the concrete educational praxis in the rigid and institutionalized – perhaps overinstitutionalized – educational landscape, on the other, but it works as the motor for driving the educational discourse that has won acceptance in the ongoing schooled society from the Enlightenment on. That with such an approach we have come quite a way from the simple idea history – the stories of the great educators that often pejoratively and unjustly influenced the image formation of our profession is obvious (Depaepe 1997, 208223). The rationality and irrationality and the legitimacy and illegitimacy of conrete educational behaviour were determined much more by opinions 37\n\nPart I. Starting from the Belgian Case – from Schooling to Educationalization\n\nthan by large-scale theories and utopian visions. Hence our preference to operationalize the new cultural history of education as a kind of Zeitgeistresearch, i.e. as an attempt to reconstruct the history of educational opinions and realities and mental structures (ways of thought and feeling) on the basis of trivial documents, such as letters, newspapers, occasional adresses, advisory literature and the whole educational press (Depaepe 1983, 19). Through such documents a pedagogical discourse with its own textual specificities was created to activate and legitimate the social phenomenon of massification, which was at the time also perceived as the result of a kind of totality-spirit, working behind history, But this idea of totality was, of course, from a complete different nature than the histoire totaleconcept. It belonged to the Zeitgeist of the twenties and thirties that an organologic principle could bring unity and order in society and, in doing so, could make the normativity of the leading ideologies more acceptable to the masses. In short, we try to reconstruct a collective mentality of social groupings for that particular period and area. Today, in a period of so-called ‘demassification’ (Wildemeersch & Jansen 1992) in which the individual looks predominant and the norma­ tive orientation of the ideological framework is fading away, it seems not superfluous to study the interbellum period, in which the massification was at the heart of the Zeitgeist. All the more because these, at first sight contradictory, phenomena occur in periods of economic depression in which ‘normally’ free-floating anxiety is accompanied by increased egocentrism (Gaus 1995, 125-137). The massifying expressions (corporatistic, fascistic, fascist) in the 1930s would this indicate if not an exception then a difference in degree in the ego-involvement as well as in the anxiety. Here, other studies will have to help to find an answer. By way of introduction, we will first discuss the pedagogical discourse with its seemingly broad social consensus, and then we will consider its scientific disguise.\n\n❙❙ The Discourse on Moral Rearmament as the Driving Force in Educationalization During the Interbellum Period “A wave of spiritual woe is washing over the world. The concepts of religion, ethics, domesticity, and duty are no longer signposts for a countless number of people. The outlines of civilization have blurred. Many people are blinded by total confusion, and having forgotten God, they delve into the solutions of uncounted world mysteries, which give life a bitter taste. Faith has faded 38\n\nThe Conquest of Youth\n\neven among Christians. In the big cities, acts of faith, attending Mass on Sunday, forgoing meat on given days, church weddings, and the baptism of the children are waning. In many a Christian family, one cannot find a single religious book, one cannot hear a single prayer. A total degeneration of morality rules all classes and ranks of mankind. In this disconcerted society, domestic life, too, has been disrupted. The education of the children is often being neglected, and, in many neighbourhoods, schools and streets have become the children’s shelter. And when these children grow up, and freed from school take a job usually in factories or workshops, passion and lust will rage through them, in no time decaying and ruining numerous young lives. Imagining these situations, one must be convinced of the need to grapple with education in its largest and broadest sense. If we do not want to see youth sink deeper, then parents and teachers must extend a helping hand. The interest, which the education of the youth enjoyed during these last years, leads us to believe that the young are not able to cope with the emancipation granted to them. Nowadays the care of youth, not only children but also and especially boys and girls in their ripe adolescent years, has become one of the crucial questions of our time.”\n\nWith these words Father Jozef Joos started his introduction to his book Moderne Jeugdopleiding (Modern Youth Education) (Joos 1933,11-12), which was addressed to parents. This one text out of many reflects the pulse of Catholic Action in its battle against the “crisis of culture” that was conspicuously manifest in film, fashion, music, dance, and sexual behaviour. In agreement with the Pope’s guidelines, expressed in the encyclical Divini Illius Magistri (1929), it conceived education as the principal means to turn the tide. To this end, all kinds of Catholic organizations were mobilized. As such, immediately after the First World War, an appeal was made to Catholic parents and teachers to establish associations for moderation and temperance, while in the beginning of the thirties the Catholic Offensive Movement was put into effect all over Flanders (Dhaene 1986, 227-268). This movement guarded public morals and developed activities in the press, cinema, and radio. In addition, the Zedenadel (Moral Nobility), a society for the promotion of decency, was founded. It campaigned against “filthy” movies, stage plays, and periodicals, denounced nudism, and repudiated propaganda for contraceptives and abortion. Besides these organizations, other potentially manipulative channels were deployed on a mass basis. Advisory literature containing what should (and in particular what should not) be done according to pedagogical opinion setters flourished more than ever before. Publications with overblown titles such as: “Save Youth!”, “The Battle for Chastity”, “Champions”, and “In the First Division”, as well as hagiographic stories about Catholic pedagogues (e.g. Don Bosco and Edouard Poppe) met with astonishing success. They promoted “unflagging 39\n\nPart I. Starting from the Belgian Case – from Schooling to Educationalization\n\ncombat against alcoholism” and warned about excessive smoking and eating – “the beast of gluttony” – laziness, ostentation, and impurity. This plea was embedded in a broader “offensive for chastity” intended to preserve youth from the “vices” by “mortification” and “zeal”. There was no room for “sissies”, but only for real Flemish “men”, “champions” that would win the “battle for chastity”. These metaphors were apparently taken from national sports such as soccer and cycling, which had become popular and the coverage of which in the press was just as strongly moralizing in Catholic Flanders (Depaepe 1992, 226-231). The final goal of the pedagogic offensive had to be obtained through “strict” education based on obedience, willpower, and authority. Such repressive pedagogical praxis obviously went hand in hand with a strictly dogmatic theory of education, which was inspired by the “eternal source of rejuvenation of the Catholic pedagogical philosophy” (De Hovre 19342, 16). However, this “conservative revolution” – with these words Frans De Hovre, the leading philosopher of education in Flanders, welcomed the “rebirth” of the Catholic theory of pedagogy – did not leave much room for the contribution of youth itself. This “perilous period” was loaded with negative connotations so that the educational activity had to be unilaterally controlled from the top. “Youth will never save itself ”, wrote the Jesuit Stracke in 1926 (Stracke 1926, 3-6), and as such the necessity of a strictly guided pedagogical approach – the well-known führen, which was absolutely at odds with wachsenlassen (Litt 1927) – had been “proven right”. Thus, youth could not but let itself be inundated passively by this massive flow of civilizing effort. However, we should beware of taking the repressive wishes of the moralists as actually effective. Study of the demographic behaviour in the interbellum period, for example, adequately indicates that obedience to certain strictures was certainly not universal. Between about 1920 and 1934, despite moral pressure and social control, about 60% of the married couples tried to control their fertility in one way or another (Vandenbroeke 1994, 124-136). And, as a matter of fact, even the militants of the Catholic Action themselves doubted the effectiveness of their efforts. Alberic Decoene, priest and head of the teacher-training college of Torhout reflected thus in the introduction to Joos’ work: “We have built innumerable schools and mobilized a vast army of Christian educators, male and female. Entire convents are at our disposal. Their members have sacrificed their youth, their talent, their future to the noblest of all apostolates: Christian education. Every morning, around 8:30, hundreds of thousands of children take their places in the classrooms that we ourselves have generously erected with masses of money. Why then do all these efforts 40\n\nThe Conquest of Youth\n\nsometime seem not to produce what they should produce? Has God’s arm become shorter? Is our will not firm enough? Are we not alert enough?”\n\nRather than flinch before the challenge, Decoene argued, one had to continue the trodden path. For him, the apparent misfortunes in the educational work should necessarily lead to a deeper reflection on the means employed in order to imprint the values on the soul of the child and adolescent even more strongly than before. Hence his appeal to go “back to the investigation of the basic questions controlling everything, i.e. the educational questions” (Decoene 1933,7-8). And, obviously, in this reflection the family was, first of all, at stake. According to Western and Christian tradition, Decoene and his colleagues in no way doubted the inviolability and authority of this “primary” and “natural” educational environment, and, obviously, increasingly fed the sexual stereotypes in the educational patterns. Still, did everyone share these opinions? And how did they relate to family education, in particular, in the context of the tension between discourse and reality and between norm and practice?\n\n❙❙ The Educationalization of the Family and the Success of Authoritarian Education Saturated with Sexual Stereotypes and Marked by Infantilization In virtually every layer of the population – Catholic as well as non-Catholic – education of the children was seen as a task to be performed primarily by women (Depaepe 1998b,232-260). Motherhood was a lofty social task. Nevertheless, the notions about the family itself could diverge considerably, depending on the underlying view of society and humanity. The Catholic point of view, especially in the massive efforts of that time to revalue and restore the family and faithful to Catholic doctrine and specifically to the teaching of the encyclical Casti Connubii (1930), stressed the importance of having many children, of marital fidelity, and of indissolubility as well as a clear division between the sexual roles: professional life for the man, domestic life for the woman. The aspiration was to have a normally large family, i.e. not a massive guided by instincts, but a family that complied with the laws of nature and that took responsibility for posterity. This implied that intentionally small families were stigmatized as being suspect of unnatural interventions, selfishness, and indolence. The traditional rural Catholic family life served here as the ideal of the moral revival, although even there, too, “sensuality” had infiltrated. Moreover, an inspired country youth was to be used to stem the tide of the pernicious urban wave and 41\n\nPart I. Starting from the Belgian Case – from Schooling to Educationalization\n\nthus prevent the rural depopulation. Indeed, the urban conglomerates struck a completely different note. The Socialist women’s movement chose for intentional motherhood, approved of the use of contraceptives, and looked on childless or small families more as a result of a financial need than anything else. Helios: Ligue belge de propagande héliophile, an association established in 1924, operated on the same wavelength. In the beginning, it concentrated on naturism and nudism, but, in the course of the 1930s, eugenics, sexology, and birth control were frequently discussed. Its members and sympathizers were most probably from the progressive intellectual circles of the Francophone part of Belgium. It also joined the Weltliga für Sexualreform, which advocated equal sexual rights for both men and women, birth control to achieve well-considered reproduction, the liberation of marriage from the meddling of Church and State, and systematic, non-repressive sexual education. About the mother working outside the home, opinions also varied. The Catholic viewpoint knew barely any hesitation: a large family presupposed a married woman at the fireside, which conviction, actually in accordance with Quadragesimo Anno (1931), culminated in 1934 with the bill of Father Rutten to limit labour for married women. Although economic grounds (the high unemployment rate) were not totally lacking, the bill, which was never passed, would have been the pinnacle of a family-defense policy that had been pursued for many years. Actually, many thought it impossible that working outside the home and being a good housekeeper, wife, and mother could be combined in one, single person. Being a working woman brought on calamities: badly educated and abandoned children, a wretched family life, disease, lower birth rates, higher child mortality, juvenile delinquency, etc. In the first instance, a woman had to develop a solid family life and provide society with morally sound members by means of religious education. Within the Socialist movement, especially within the unions, there was significant opposition to wage work for married women as well, which was seen as a possible cause of unemployment and wage reduction. The Socialist women, however, advocated a choice for women between wage work or domestic work. They strove to do everything possible to enable mothers to stay with their families but nothing to oblige them to do so. Their pro-family attitude in supporting child benefits – the Socialist Belgische Werklieden Partij (Belgian Workers’ Party), first saw it as a disguised form of wage reduction, a manoeuvre by the bosses to break the power of the unions – and in demanding legal recognition of domestic work as a profession as well as of maternity wages from the birth of the first child on acted as a counterbalance to the importance the Catholic world 42\n\nThe Conquest of Youth\n\ngranted to family problems. However, Socialist women, together with freethinking and feminist groupings, perceived working outside the home as a form of independence for the married workman’s wife, an emancipation from her status, in Bebel’s words, of being “the slave of a slave”. The ideological split disclosed itself clearly in such positions on the family, and the Catholic Church and the New Order came together there quite easily. “All mothers at home, the child is a treasure,” was one of the slogans of the National Flemish Organizations, inspired by National Socialism, taking the “universal Christian moral law” as the theological basis of their policy (De Wever 1994; Depaepe 1998c, 113-128; Depaepe 1998a, 504-522). If one abstracts from the underlying social model and in particular of the religious dimension in education and of the veneration of the Blessed Virgin (“the mother par excellence”), one can find many similarities in all the different opinions about the educational activity of the ideal mother in the ideal family. The mother had responsibility for building the character of her children. She had to impart qualities to them such as solidarity, enthusiasm, self-denial, order, thrift, obedience, love of truth, courage, self-control, and industry. She had to provide a warm, cosy atmosphere, maintain domestic happiness, in short, a real home, a spotless house with no dissension in which Sundays and holidays were honoured and strong family ties were forged. Maternal love, however, should not lead to overprotection, but, by means of a functionally strict and fair education, by means of seriously commanding and calmly forbidding, worthy members of society were to be formed. Given this central role of the mother, the father, the head of the family, seems to have been almost completely excluded from the educational process. “By “nature” he was less fit for it: he laboured, provided the breadwinning, and functioned like a bogey man when the children misbehaved. However, by the end of the thirties, new elements had emerged (Simon 1994b, 182): the father started to be depicted playing a more active role, taking part in the games of the children at home, and starting to discuss the school results with his wife. Paid holidays and the forty-hour week, which left more free time to be divided over fewer children, were surely a factor here. The child also came to be shown as entitled to its own corner, its own fantasy world, and the mother, immersing herself in the children’s thoughts and feelings, could be more a child with the children. These, at least in the sources used for the present study and particularly in the pedagogical advisory literature, are extremely tentative indications of a shift from a restrictive to a more permissive educational style and from “discipline-oriented” to “love-oriented” behavioral control techniques. The 43\n\nPart I. Starting from the Belgian Case – from Schooling to Educationalization\n\ninfluence of Alfred Adler, Charlotte Bühler, and Eduard Spranger gradually took shape: the relational aspect of education came more into focus. This idealized picture displayed to an audience chiefly composed of labourers reflects in the first place the opinions of middle-class propagandists, who wanted to determine what was good for the lower classes, perceived as an ignorant, “unreasonable” mass. Many pedagogical advisory articles from the Socialist side also started from the premise of the young girl as being totally unprepared for motherhood, which explains in part their support of family-substituting establishments such as nurseries, infant consultation clinics, and recreation camps for weak children. Consequently, on the one hand, attention was focused on motherhood, women were expelled from the job circuit, and the “female” wife was placed in the household; on the other hand, she was not necessarily considered to be the best educator. Other bodies started to take over the tasks of the family. Advisors of parents, some representing organizations, others not, were part of this effort as were the multitude of youth leaders and, not in the least, the school with its professional elementary school teachers. Parents were told in a rather pedantic way about what kind of education they had to provide. The doctors and nurses of the National Work for Child Welfare, with their medical-pedagogical counselling in the programs for antenatal, infant, and toddler care and related services, contributed to the increasing amount of supervision of the family. Growing medicalization and educationalization, using the woman as a tool, went hand in hand. Finally, we come to the pedagogical reality within the family itself. The few characteristics in educational patterns we have cited are quite familiar to the older generations of today and to many labourers and correspond more or less to their experience. Does this then demonstrate the success of the moralizing campaigns of those days? The answer seems ambivalent. The few studies that have investigated educational styles in working class families and that used techniques such oral-history interviews all reveal the originality of the working-class culture within some groups (De Graeve 1988, 150-174). But one value is universal: obedience. Parental authority was indisputable. The day-to-day context of the labourers made such a unilateral balance of power almost necessary. A strict family rhythm mainly determined by the existing labour relations, cramped housing with rudimentary hygienic facilities, and a time-consuming household limited the intimate time budget to a minimum. Any disobedience disturbed the strict organization of the household. It was equally important to the labourers to aim at respectability. Children showed respect by, for example, wearing descent clothes, and speaking about sexuality was a 44\n\nThe Conquest of Youth\n\nsign of disreputableness. There was hardly any sex education within the family. Children were fooled into believing that babies were delivered to the house by a stork or were found under a cabbage leaf. Another popular story was the “boat theory”, which held that children came from Spain, just like St. Nicholas. All these naive sexual inventions probably produced infantilizing effects. However, it is quite interesting to note that certain behaviour deviating from the standard, such as drunkenness, divorce, or having a child out of wedlock, were tolerated within the working class, in sharp contrast with the restrictive attitude of the middle and higher classes on these matters and not at all escaping the attention of the moralists of the time. Values and standards were thus being adopted from other groups, were filled in differently, or were inherent in the working-class culture. Conforming to certain bourgeois values was, first of all, a matter of survival. Therefore, besides the objective fact of women being expelled from the job circuit, it remains questionable whether women themselves to a certain degree did not feed its ideologically attendant worship of domesticity, for it enhanced their significance within marriage. Their power within the family, within the private sphere received in a way a sacral character. For women in working-class neighbourhoods, where the living area and street area merged, this child- and woman-minded movement, this shift to a more intimate pattern of life signified a new dimension, a hope for autonomy.\n\n❙❙ “He Who Possesses the Youth, Possesses the Future” or the Educationalization of Youth Care and Youth Work With the mass mobilization of the time, it is hardly surprising that the educationalization and socialization of children and young people towards a certain ideology were constantly being discussed. Youth movements grew profusely and were interwoven in the propaganda with mass mobilization. This phenomenon was most powerful on the Catholic side. The massive mobilisation already started in elementary school with the Eucharistic Crusade, a popular movement during the 1920s under the strict supervision of the Church. Boys and girls were encouraged to go to Holy Communion weekly and “to devote their heart to Christ” every morning. By means of participation in the Eucharistic, an elite of perfect Christians was to be formed, who were to make a substantial contribution to the Christianization of society (Van Garsse 1987, 195-203; Van Haver 1995). During the thirties, this type of religious youth work stagnated and declined as it was subsumed under the auxiliary services of the class-related Catholic 45\n\nPart I. Starting from the Belgian Case – from Schooling to Educationalization\n\nAction. The Kristene Arbeidersjeugd (KAJ) (Young Christian Workers), in particular, which was led by the charismatic Jozef Cardijn, was one of the cornerstones. It manifested its power thorugh a number of mass activitities, such as pilgrimages, meetings and celebrations (flag parades, choral readings, group formations, slogans, mass singings, etc.). At the beginning of the thirties, a religious shift occurred within the KAJ: moral-religious action took priority, and political and trade-union activity was relegated to the background. Social needs, of course, still remained on the agenda, and solutions continued to be sought for coping with the economic crisis: unemployment funds and employment agencies were established; material and financial aid was granted to unemployed young people; work camps were founded, and the extension of compulsory education was demanded. On the social-educational level, there were services for vocational guidance, infirmaries, and programs for school-leavers and soldiers. Another spearhead of Catholic Action was the Katholieke Studenten Actie (KSA) (Catholic Student Movement) founded in 1928. The Flemish bishops used this association as a repressive means to counter the influential, though in the beginning of the thirties ideologically splintered, Flemish-nationalist, antiBelgian Algemeen Katholiek Vlaams Studentenverbond (General Catholic Flemish Student Association), which was relatively independent of Church (Vos 1982). Meanwhile the the KSA and the KAJ continued to flourish. Together with the successful programs of other youth organizations, such as the Catholic youth groups (patronages) for boys, the more middle-class Scouts – the Flemish Association of Catholic Scouts, the Farmer’s Union for Boys, the Farmer’s Union for Girls and the Middle-Class Youth – illustrate the web the Catholics had woven over Flanders to catch the youth. Its competition consisted, first, of the Socialist organizations. Some of them developed political, economic, and antimilitarist activities. Others were less militant in organizing demonstrations and meetings against Fascism, preferred cultural activities and imported to Flanders the German youth movement-style, romanticizing the image of “simply being young together surrounded by pure nature”. By forming an elite, the latter ones aspired to the spiritual and moral edification of all working-class children, creating within capitalism a Socialist counterculture focused on community spirit. Besides associations linked to the Socialists, there were also Liberal and Flemish-nationalist youth associations. Little is known"
