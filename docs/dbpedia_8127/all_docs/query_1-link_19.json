The joint resolution of Congress, approved December 15, 1877, in relation to the Universal Exposition of 1878 at Paris, provided for the appointment by the President of twenty commissioners additional to the Commissioner-Gen¬ eral, and on the 12th day of February, 1878, I had the honor to be appointed one of these commissioners. The Exposition was opened to the public on the 1st day of May, and was closed on the 10th day of November. A large portion of the intervening time I spent at Paris or in visit¬ ing such industrial centers as would afford needed informa¬ tion in the preparation of this report. By arrangement tji^commerciia with the Commissioner-General I undertook the consider- pectsbof uieWoii tiou of the commercial and business aspects of the iron and stecl in,his_ steel industries as they were represented at the Exposition, and such observations as I may submit in the following pages will be strictly in accordance with this understand¬ ing, leaving to others the presentation of facts and opinions affecting the purely technical and scientific aspects of these technical 0 the industries. A few preliminary remarks of a general nature will, however, be permitted. In strong contrast with the action of our government in CiSior?Pi).yPPh<' regard to the Philadelphia Exhibition, the French Govern- ^cXof thTpro- meut, rightly appreciating the benefits to be derived from •j|°£ed Erposi' international displays of industrial products, promptly re¬ solved that the Exposition should be held, and assumed the expense of its creation and management. The people, thus encouraged and thus directed, labored with a patriotic pride and a concentration of effort worthy of all praise to secure its success. Every branch of the government and all classes interest?1 pnWlc of the people realized that the honor, the glory, and the welfare of France would be promoted by the Exposition, and there were therefore no serious impediments placed in its way and no jealousies engendered to cast reproach upon the French name. The Exposition was as completely sue- E|p0cs“fonof the cessful as all France desired that it should be, and Fiance 3 4 UNIVERSAL EXPOSITION AT PARIS, 1878. is richer to-day, her people are more generally employed, and her future is brighter than if it had not been held.

The statesman exccp1 United States formed the exception; neither her natural tion- resources nor the mechanical skill and achievements of her people were adequately represented. It will be for others to state all the reasons for this inadequate display; I desire merely to add my testimony in emphasizing the fact that all the nations which made adequate displays of their products at Paris commenced to prepare their exhibits at an early day after the holding of the Exposition was determined upon. France, Great Britain, Sweden, Russia, Austria, Italy, Belgium, and the Australian colonies were in the van of preparation ; only the United States, of all the leading industrial nations of the world, lagged behind.

If we would widen the area for the consumption of our agricultural and manufactured products, and if we would increase our commerce, we must not sit with folded hands and wait for customers to come to us, but swiftly as opportunity offers go in search of them. May we not learn wisdom in this matter from that mother country which has taught us so much already?

More perhaps than any other great industry, showc(1{^ fruits that which embraces the manufacture of iron and steel was °f tho manufhet- ure rather than represented at Paris by its fruits ranker than by its methods, the methods. But how numerous, and varied, and wonderful were these fruits! Of machinery used in other manufacturing indus¬ tries, and made mainly or wholly of iron and steel, the dis¬ play was in an economic sense the most imposing feature of the Exposition. Indeed, the presence of labor-saving ma¬ chinery and its products was the great industrial base, and pillar, and crown of the Exposition, as it had been of other recent international exhibitions. It may here be remarked that on the Continent of Europe, The manufact- and to a certain extent in Great Britain, the manufacture steel with the 7 . manufacture ol of heavy machinery, railway rolling-stock, steam-engines, heavy machinery military material, etc., is more generally conducted in con- lishment common * . n . n . in Europe. nection with the manufacture ot iron and steel than in this country. Locomotives, railway cars, and ordnance, for instance, are not manufactured by a single establishment in the United States which makes iron and steel, but in Europe the combination of industries indicated is frequently met. Whether the economical results are satisfactory or not is simply a question of administration ; but the fact is to be noted that the European system of consolidating industries has scarcely an existence in the United States. The genius of our institutions, the varied resources of our country, and its vast extent are influences which encourage individual enterprise and a separation of industries. COUNTRIES WHICH PRODUCE THE MOST IRON AND STEEL. Countries which produce the most steel and iron. The leading iron and steel producing countries of the world are as follows, in the order of their prominence : (1) Great Britain. (2) United States. (3) Germany. (4) Franco. (5) Belgium. (G) Austria-Hungary. (7) Russia. (8) Sweden. These countries produce more than 98.5 per cent, of the world’s annual increase of iron and steel. All were repre¬ sented at the Paris Exposition except Germany. All other 6 UNIVERSAL EXPOSITION AT PARIS, 1878. countries unitedly produce less than 1.5 per cent, of the an¬ nual increase. The iron resources of most of these coun¬ tries were, however, represented at Paris.

Remarkable By far the finest exhibit of iron and steel and their of iron and steel, products ever made by France was made at her own Expo- sitiou in 1878. Her exhibit of iron and steel proper was also greatly superior in size and variety to that made at the same or at any previous international exhibition by any other country. It excited the astonishment and elicited the admiration of all who thoughtfully examined it, for few who looked upon it had before realized how largely French skill and enterprise had been enlisted in the manufacture of the more finished forms of iron and steel. In the manufacture of crude iron, castings, bar-iron, iron and steel rails, and some other heavy products, the world had known, at least since the Paris Exposition of 1807, that Prance was largely engaged, and that in their skillful and economical produc¬ tion she was not behind any other nation ; but at the Ex- Great increase, position of 1878 she showed that in the manufacture of the nu-nt sinceYsOT? most advanced forms of iron and steel and many of the products derived from them she had been enterprising and successful beyond all expectation. At Vienna, in 1873, and at Philadelphia, in 1870, France made a very poor display of her iron and steel resources and capabilities. For this the destructive war from which she had but recently emerged was doubtless the principal cause. But in 1878 she came grandly into line with other iron and steel producing nations IRON AND STEEL EXHIBITS: COMMISSIONER MORRELL. of tlie first rank, lier steel exhibit being especially notice- FKA-NCE- able and surprising. Of the various exhibits made by the iron and steel makers of France, that of Schneider & Co., of Creusot, was the J^reu^ot^00\" most conspicuous and the most complete. It was closely followed by the exhibit of the Terre Noire Company, and it Torre Noire, in turn by the exhibit of the Saint-Chamond Company. samt-chamon<i. Each of these exhibits was displayed in a pavilion erected in the immediate vicinity of the main Exposition building, that of Schneider & Co. being the largest special building attached to the Exposition. In the Creusot exhibit the object which first attracted the CrGusot- visitor’s attention, at the entrance to the pavilion, was the wooden model of the immense 80-ton steam-hammer finished steam-hammer, at Creusot in 1877.* This hammer is the largest in the world, and is said to possess more than three times the power of the celebrated 50-ton Krupp hammer at Essen. A hundred- ton forging may be turned with ease upon its anvil by means of its four powerful cranes. The large sum of $500,000 is said to have been the cost of this hammer and its accessories and of the building erected for it at Creusot. Scarcely less wonderful as a metallurgical monster was the Siemens-Mar- , siamons-Mar- ° # tin mgo ‘ . tin steel ingot, cast by the same company in April, 1878, and weighing 120 metrical tons, a wooden model of which was placed on exhibition. By the side of this ingot stood another wonder — a massive armor plate, 13 feet 10 inches Armor plate long, 8 feet 6 inches wide, 2 feet 7 inches thick, and weigh¬ ing 65 metric tons. This plate was intended for a ship’s turret. Somewhat in the same line as the objects above noticed was a marine engine of 2,040 horse-power, with Marine enSiuc. three upright cylinders, one of 5.49 feet and each of the others of 6.10 feet in diameter. Eight boilers were provided to supply the steam. The weight of the engine was 290 metric tons, and that of engine and boilers was 480 tons. There was also exhibited an exceptionally large cast-steel shaft for a screw-propeller, for a French naval vessel. This, Screw-propoi- forging was 60 leet 4 inches long and 17 inches in diameter, and weighed 44,651 pounds, or about 20 tons. There were many other exhibits in the Creusot pavilion which indicated great facility in the manufacture of heavy machinery and warlike material for use on land or sea. There were also locomotives, iron and steel rails, plates, sheets, and wire. steel tires, iron bars, angles, and beams, and many other iron and steel products — all of good quality. A model of a modified Danks puddling machine was also exhibited, Dankspnddier. See frontispiece. 8 UNIVERSAL EXPOSITION AT PARIS, 1878. Crousot, Models drawings. with various products. This modification overcomes diffi¬ culties iu machine puddling heretofore experienced in Eng¬ land and the United States, and it practically dephosphorizes the iron worked in it. It represents a step forward. Two of these machines are regularly at work at Creusot, giving good results, each of them producing 20 tons in 24 hours. A circular steel plate, about 90 inches in diameter, attracted and attention. Models and drawings of bridges, engines, mines, workingmen’s houses, etc., and of the town of Creusot itself, were liberally distributed throughout the building, as were also samples of the ores, coal, and refractory materials in The finest iron use at Creusot. The whole display was most imposing, and and steel exhibit , ever made. was the finest single exhibit of iron and steel ever made at an international exhibition. The works of Schneider & Co. are mainly situated at .works ntcreu- Creusot, in the department of the Saone-et-Loire, where a Bessemer plant of 6 eight-ton converters, a Siemens-Mar¬ tin plant (both commenced in 18C9), blast furnaces, plate mills, gun factory, mines, etc., are located ; but their loco¬ motive, boiler, bridge-building, ship-building, and marine and at ck&ions- works are situated at the neighboring town of Chalons, on the river Saone. There are also coal and ore mines, brick works, etc., elsewhere. The ground occupied by the fur¬ naces, rolling mills, steel works, constructing shops, and other buildings used by the company at Creusot and Chalons Area occupied, covers GO acres ; and the total area occupied by the works, dwellings of workmen, and railroads at the works is 3,0G8 The number of miles of railroad operated is 188, In all departments of the company’s works th -re are in use 281 and engines other than locomotives, 58 steam-hammers, and 1,050 steam-machine tools. In the last fiscal year there of were produced 549,000 metric tons of coal, 155,000 tons of pig-iron, 126,000 tons of wrought iron and steel ; and 25,000 tons of iron and steel products in the constructing shops. In the same year 400,000 tons of iron ore were consumed in 13 blast furnaces. These furnaces are from 72 to 82 feet high, and are supplied with Whitwell and Cowper fire-brick stoves and with immense blowing engines. All the Bessemer iron is run direct from the blast furnaces to the converters. In recent years the average annual production of steel rails has of been 50,000 tons; of iron rails, 20,000 tons; and of locomo¬ tives 100. The total sales of the company amounted to $15,000,000 in the fiscal year 1874-’75, and to $11,000,000 in the fiscal yearl877-’78.

Its nominal capital is 27,000,000 FgAJtCE- francs, or $5,211,000. The works at Creusot were founded Creusot in 1781, but they did not begin to assume any of their pres¬ ent importance until 1S3G, when they passed into the hands of Messrs. Schneider Brothers & Co. The Terre Noire exhibit, although not so large as that of Terre Noire. Creusot, was more consecutive and instructive, in showing instructive con- grades of steel and the results of using metalloids. It com- tfon.tIT° cxhlbl prised an interesting and very full collection of ores, coal, pig-iron, ferro-manganese, and spiegeleisen ; bent and frac- and tured bars ; polished bars and rails ; hammered, rolled, and fractured samples of various kinds of steel ; cast-iron pipes of various diameters ; beams, some of which were G8 feet long; galvanized iron; chains; locomotive axles; steel ingots ; solid steel castings, etc. The bent and fractured specimens of iron and steel showed the quality of these metals to be excellent. There was also exhibited a model in wood of the immense blowing engine of the Bessemer 'Blowing en- plant of the company at Bess6ges, and a fine drawing of the gmes' large blowing engine of the blast furnaces at Tamaris ; also models, drawings, and photographs of much other ma¬ chinery, including photographs of the large plate train, just Plate train, completed, which will roll a plate 3G.08 feet long, S.2 feet wide, and 3.9 inches thick. But the feature of the Terre Noire exhibit which attracted most attention was the dis¬ play of solid steel castings, made by a process peculiar to solid steel cast- Terre Noire, but a modification of the ordinary Siemens- mgs' Martin process. Cannon and projectiles are the principal cannon, etc. articles made by this process, which produces a true steel free from blow-holes. The process has been briefly described to consist in the use of a silicide of manganese and iron, the silicon preventing blow-holes by decomposing the oxide of carbon which is in solution and tends to escape during solidi¬ fication', while the manganese reduces the remaining silica and the oxide of iron and prevents a further production of gases by the reaction of the oxide on the carbon. About 200 tons of castings are produced monthly by this process. The works of the Terre Noire Company are greatly scat- worts of Terro • Noire tered, the principal branch, however, being at Terro Noire, in the department of the Saone-et-Loire. The extensive operations of the present company had their origin in the purchase of the iron mine of La Voulte, in 1810. In 18G2 the erection of a Bessemer plant was commenced at Terre Noire, and in 18G8 a Siemens-Martin plant was established Bessemer and at the same place. A Bessemer and a Siemens-Martin plant plant118 ’ Martm were established at Besseges in 1868. The company owns 10 UNIVERSAL EXPOSITION AT PARIS, 1878. Creusot. Plant, area, railways. 19 blast furnaces and all the usual appliances of an advanced and comprehensive iron and steel establishment. It has 15 Siemens-Martin furnaces, 8 Bessemer converters, 84 pud¬ dling and 55 reheating furnaces, 12 steam-hammers, and 28 roll trains for iron and steel. Its buildings cover 28 acres ; it operates, with ten locomotives, 70 miles of railroad con¬ nected with its various works ; and it employs 7,881 persons. Two of the Siemens-Martin furnaces have a nominal capacity of 15 tons each, and have m;:de heats of 22 tons each. Bessemer prac- In the Bessemer practice of the Terre Noire Company Noire.a spiegeleisen is melted in a Ponsard furnace, which requires 25 pounds of coal to melt 100 pounds of metal. One furnace serves four converters, but the latter, which are on the ground door, are small and convert only 4 tons at a heat. At Terre Noire the metal is charged direct from the blast furnace into the Bessemer converter. At some of the blast furnaces of the company Siemens-Cowper stoves are used. The company is noted for its production in commercial High-grade quantities of high-grade ferro-manganese in the blast fur- ferro-mangancse. . uace. The highest it has made contains 85 per cent, ot manganese, G.7 per cent, of carbon, and 8 per cent, of iron. Ferro-manganese of from 71 to 75 per cent, of manganese is made from ores of 3G to 40 per cent, of manganese, and with about 2.75 tons of coke to the ton of product, the blast being about 715° C. An average daily production of 11 to 12 tons is obtained in a furnace which would produce 42 tons of Peiro-siiicium. Bessemer pig-iron in the same time. Ferro-silicium is also manufactured at Terre Noire in the blast furnace, the com¬ position of two samples being as follows: (1) Iron, G8.50; manganese, 20 ; carbon, 1.50 ; silicinm, 10. (2) Iron, 7G.77 ; manganese, 14; carbon, 1. GO; silicinm, 7.50. The Siemens- tiu pifmt ns Mar Martin plant at Terre Noire is very complete and elaborate.

Several locomotives and cars and a large FBAJJCE- collection of polished and fractured iron and steel rails Saint-Chamond. were exhibited; also car wheels of wrought iron with steel tires. Of the marine articles on exhibition several armor plates of great thickness were most conspicuous. Some of Armor plates, these were rolled much thicker at one edge than at the other, the thinner part to go under the water. The frag¬ ment of an iron armor plate thus rolled was shown, one edge of which was 14 inches thick and the other 9 inches; several indentations showed that, notwithstanding its thick¬ ness, it had been almost perforated by projectiles hurled against it. A model of the rolls by which these plates were produced was exhibited. The display of steel cannon Steel cannon and cast-steel cannon balls was large, the tube of one can- and balIs' non weighing almost 7 metric tons. A cast-steel ingot, Steel ingots ami weighing 40 metric tons; a steel crank- axle, weighing 3i ob'“ts- tons; a ship’s keel of wrought iron, 49 feet long, and weigh¬ ing 5,170 pounds; and several large cast-steel plates for various purposes, were especially noticeable. Oast-steel beams, steel disks for circular saws, thin sheets of crucible steel, bent, twisted, and fractured bars of iron and steel, aud many other specimens completed a very interesting col lection of iron and steel products. Of the models shown Mo.ieis of tur- there was one of a twenty-ton Pernot lurnace in use at the works. The steel made at Saint-Chamond is made in Sie- mens-Martin-Pernot furnaces. Iron is also puddled iu Per¬ not furnaces. The works produce beams, springs, tires, cannon, rails, armor and other plates, and merchant iron and steel. Sieel beams are a specialty, and are made up to two feet in width by a peculiar universal train. The company which operates the extensive works at Saint- (l mc.™; Ckamond has a capital of $2,600,000, employs from 5,000 Sfa'ctures. to 6,000 workmen, and manufactures from 40,000 to 45,000 tons of iron and steel annually. Its works proper are in five divisions, and in addition it has seven blast furnaces — four cold-blast charcoal in Corsica aud three hot-blast coke near Saint-Chamond. In the main building of the Exposition and in the an- other l iencu , . . 1 . exhibits. nexes there were exhibited the products ot many other iron and steel establishmeuts of Prance, a majority of all these establishments in the country being represented. Speci¬ mens of pig-iron and iron ores from all parts of France and adjacent sources of supply were shown.

The Denain and Anzin Company presented a very impos¬ ing column of iron and steel rails and other iron and steel products, including iron made in a revolving puddling fur¬ nace of the Crampton pattern. The Champagne Company exhibited a large collection of iron ores, and of pig-iron made with both charcoal and coke. Jacob Holtzer & Co. exhibited chrome pig-iron and steel, the latter showing a very fine fracture. This firm also ex¬ hibited a very large and complete assortment of steel bars of all sizes, as well as steel castings, tools, cannon, and raw materials. The Compagnie de VHorme showed samples of wrought iron tempered in sulphuric acid to increase its tensile strength. The Coal Company of Anzin, the largest mining company in France, exhibited a fine model of its mines, at which are employed about 15,000 persons. This company owns about 70,000 acres of land, and produces about 2,000,000 tons of coal annually. Engines and machinery. Engines and machinery. Steam-engines. The display made by France of steam-engines and loco¬ motives was the largest in the Exposition, and showed to great advantage. Many of the engines were in motion, and in ease of movement, smoothness of finish, and adaptation to the uses to which they were applied they compared favor¬ ably with the best engines in use in the United States. I was especially pleased to see two Corliss engines of French manufacture in operation, each of about 50 horse power. The largest engine in the Exposition building was a French engine of 700 horse-power.

France, indeed, manifests wonderful progress in the quick¬ ness with which she perceives and the readiness with which she accepts foreign mechanical ideas. Long ago Nasmyth, the English inventor of the steam-hammer, found that Frenchmen could perceive its great advantages and possi¬ bilities when his own countrymen could not. Neilson’s hot- blast, invented in Scotland in 1828, was used in France in 1832; the manufacture of Bessemer steel, invented in Eng¬ land in 1857, was introduced into France in 1859 at Sireuil. The Whitwell stoves are in more general use in France than in England. The most recent exhibition of this progress¬ ive mechanical spirit is, perhaps, shown in the introduction upon at least two French railroads of the Westinghousc air-brake, an American invention. In the substitution of steel for iron, now rapidly taking place in many countries, France is not behind any of her contemporaries. FRANCE. Machinery.

In 1878 the importation was 932,281 tons. France exported 79,113 tons of ore in 1877, and 79,530 tons in 187S. Production and The annual production of coal in France is about 17,000,000 consumption ot x 77 coal in France, tons, the annual consumption about 23,000,000 tons, and the annual exportation to neighboring countries about 800,000 tons, leaving about 7,000,000 tons to be imported. This de¬ ficiency is supplied partly from Belgium and partly from England and Westphalia. In 1873 Belgium furnished 50 per cent, of the whole importation, England 36 per cent., Artificial fuel, and Westphalia 14 per cent. About 700,000 tons of artificial fuel, or briquets, are annually manufactured in France from the refuse of coal mines. The production of coal in France coal measures, pijg doubled since 1SG0. The coal measures are principally found in the departments of Pas-de-Calais, Eord, Loire, and Saone-et-Loire. of The production of pig or cast iron in France amounted to 112,500 metric tons in 1819, to 203,361 tons in 1830, to 347,773 tons in 1840, to 415,053 tons in 1850, to SOS, 353 tons in 1800, and to 1,200,348 tons in 1808. During the years 1874 to 1877 the production was annually about 1,400,000 tons. The ex¬ act figures for 1878 are not authoritatively published, but the approximate production for the year has been placed at of 1,417,073 tons, showing a slight increase. In 1801 there were 472 blast furnaces in France, of which 282 used char¬ coal, 113 coke, and 77 mixed charcoal and coke. In 1872 the total number of furnaces had decreased to 270, although the production of the year was much greater than that of 1801, the substitution of coke for charcoal and the use of larger and better furnaces accounting for the decrease in the whole number. Of the 270 furnaces in 1872, only 89 used char¬ coal, and 40 a mixed fuel ; the remaining 135 used coke. The Production of annual production of charcoal pig-iron is now less than charcoal pig-iron. 100,000 tons. It is still customary m some parts of France to make rough castings direct from the blast furnace (classed as pig in the above statistics), and in the Pyrenees iron is still made by primitive processes. Manufacture The manufacture of iron rails in France began about 1840, of iron rails m . France. and in 1850 the production was only 23,087 metric tons. In 1S00 it was 121,348 tons, and in 1869 it was 210,028 tons. In 1872 it had fallen to 129,151 tons ; in 1875 to 118,959-tons; Statistics furnaces.

Tbe production of merchant iron (not including plates Merchant iron, and sheets) amounted to 149,052 metric tons in 1850, and to 710,935 tons in 1872. Since 1872 this production, like that of iron rails, has decreased, the make in 1877 being 589,559 tons, and iu 1878 being 608,704 tons. The production of plates and sheets amounted to 100,915 metric tons in 1805, and to 129,843 tons in 1872. The make in 1877 was 107,451 tons, and in 1878 it was 105,688 tons. The decrease in the production of iron rails and merchant , Reduced pro¬ duction ot iron iron and the stationary production of iron plates and sheets rails, ^ ^eto., ac- are results almost wholly due to the rapid increase in thetuo increase in manufacture of steel.

The manufacture of crucible cast steel in France Crucible cast does not appear to have ever much exceeded 8,000 metric tons annually, the production in 1S70 being 8,135 tons, and in 1872 being 8,080 tons. Of the reported production of 253,536 tons of Bessemer and Siemens-Martin steel in 1878, the „ Bessemer and quantity rolled into rails is placed at 211,519 tons. In 1876 steel, there were in France 26 Bessemer converters and 25 Sie¬ mens-Martin furnaces. The imports of pig-iron into France amounted to 212,897 importa- metric tons in 1877, and to 166,487 tons in 1878; of iron in other forms to 02,736 tons in 1S77, and to 69,965 tons in 1878; and of steel to 5,009 tons in 1877, and to 6,173 tons in 1878.

Taken in detail, the display of these arti¬ cles may have justified this criticism ; but as a whole it was extensive, varied, and exceedingly suggestive of mechanical piiv^fsteei’steei CSC(-‘Hence. Ho other nation except France made so impos¬ ed UCmaeA?^ ^ a display of steel, of cutlery, of armor plates, of sta- tionary and other engines, of steam-pumps, and of machine tools; while its display of agricultural implements and machinery, of textile machinery, and of general hardware was the finest in the Exposition. Its entire display of ma¬ chinery and tools was more than creditable — it was mag¬ nificent; and yet it must be confessed that, omitting this cuUeryWar° nna feature, and omitting also the splendid show of hardware and cutlery, the exhibit of iron and steel and their products by the leading nation of the world engaged in their manu¬ facture was not such as she could have made nor such as was due to her reputation. Especially was there noticeable the absence of a large assortment of the products of the Bessemer and open-heartli processes, in the invention and perfection of which processes Great Britain is entitled to the highest honors. Such products as were exhibited were Bessemer rails chiefly Bessemer rails and Siemens-Martin plates, and the and Siemens- ' . Martin plates, absence of others would seem to warrant the conclusion that on the Continent and in the United States the tendency to adapt Bessemer and open-hearth steel to the manufacture of articles for which other steel and iron have heretofore been required is stronger than in Great Britain. This view would, however, be erroneous. Great Britain failed to make a complete display of the capabilities of Bessemer and open-hearth steel; but she has not, therefore, confessed that she has failed to observe and to utilize them. On the contrary, there is abundant evidence, to be noted further on in this report, that she is abreast of other nations in adapt¬ ing Bessemer and open-hearth steel to miscellaneous uses.

Of Siemens steel, made by the “ore” process, the only noticeable display was made by the Bandore Company, of pa^ndore Com‘ which Dr. Siemens himself is the head. The exhibit of this Dr- Siemens, company, in an annex to the main building, embraced speci¬ mens of rolled and forged steel in various minor forms; also heavy ship plates of the same material; also rails, angles, ship plates, beams, tires, and axles. The exhibit was scarcely such in and3axie™s'tircs’ location, style, and variety of samples as might have been expected from this company. One of the most interesting of the British steel exhibits Whitworth was that which embraced various samples of the “ Whit¬ worth metal,” to which much importance has been attached in Great Britain in connection with the manufacture of ord¬ nance and other articles by the Siemens and Siemens-Martin processes. The exhibit was large, and of a character to favorably impress the visitor. The metal is made of more than ordinary solidity and tenacity by being cast under by- 8l^ds?ceic catt- draulic pressure. Cannon and shells of this metal are said ins- to withstand the severest tests, a claim that received confir¬ mation from some of the samples submitted. A propeller Hollow pro¬ shaft was exhibited, forged hollow, which it was claimed was peller much stronger than a solid wrought-iron shaft of the same size, which would weigh one-half more. This shaft, forged from a hoop of compressed steel, was 33 feet 7 inches long, the out¬ side diameter 17£ inches, and the diameter of the bore Ilf inches. A hydraulic cylinder of this metal was shown which was represented to stand a pressure of four tons to the square inch. For machine tools, in which strength combined with COmpressedsteef lightness is desirable, the compressed steel is claimed to have no equal. Sir Joseph Whitworth’s aim has been to produce a steel that would be free from blow-holes, and this result 2 p r - vol 3 IS UNIVERSAL EXPOSITION AT PARIS, 1878. GREAT BRITAIN.

It has already been stated in this report that a similar result has been claimed by the Terre Noire Company, in France, through chemical combinations. Hadfield’s Steel Foundry Company, of Sheffield, exhibited crucible steel castings, in various forms, principally, however, as railroad appliances, including very light wheels for street railroads. The wearing qualities of these wheels are doubt¬ less excellent, but they arc hardly superior in this respect to American chilled cast-iron wheels, while they are much more expensive. Their extreme lightness, however, is a recom¬ mendation, although it may be doubted whether they are much, if any, lighter than the best cast-iron wheels on Ameri¬ can street railroads. Steel wheels of various sizes, from colliery sheaves to car wheels, made from Attwood’s steel, at the Stunner’s Close Steel Works, at Wolsingham, were also exhibited, as were other steel castings and steel forgings from the same works. The exhibit made by the cast-steel makers of Sheffield was not large, but it was interesting and valuable. Tool steel was shown in great variety by Guy & Co. Jowitt & Sons showed circular saws with perforated teeth ; one of the saws was 7 feet and 3 inches in diameter. Siebohm & Dieckstahl exhibited many fine steel fractures, showing their steel to be of exceptional excellence ; other firms showed cast steel in various forms and tools made from it. Andrew & Co., Andrew & Co., of the Toledo Works, showed a piece of cast-steel wire rod, No. 2 wire gauge, 1,250 feet long.

Of iron products proper and the raw materials of their manufacture the best display in the British section was made by the Cleveland and North of England district. The iron- ^eveiand^aud masters of this district showed commendable enterprise in district, the extent, variety, and neatness of their display. They ex hibited the exact quantity of coke, ore, and limestone used in the production of one ton of Cleveland pig-iron, namely, a pillar of native iron ore 10 feet high and weighing 3i2%- tons, 24 cwts. of Durham coke, and 12 cwts. of Weardale limestone.

The castings exhibited by the proprietors of the Acklam Ackiam works. Works, at Middlesborough, including garden chairs, umbrella stands, and similar light wares, were cast directly from the blast furnace, the better to show the quality of the Cleve¬ land metal for foundry purposes. Mr. I. Lowthian Bell, M. I. Lowthian P., exhibited samples of Cleveland iron from which the large e percentage of phosphorus originally contained in it (1.2 to 1.75) had been almost entirely removed by his oxide of iron process. He also exhibited samples of steel made from this iron. Specimens were also shown by Hopkins, Gilkes, & Jiypkms, Gilkes Co., of Middlesborough, of iron made in the Danks puddling furnace from Cleveland pig-iron. They fully established the claim for excellence that has been made for this iron, and it was not surprising to learn that it is competing with the best Staffordshire brands. It possesses a tough fiber and great tensile strength. Siemens-Martin steel made from this Iron was also exhibited. The Danks furnace has been Danka furnace, proved to be apowerful agency in the elimination of phospho¬ rus from Cleveland pig-iron, but, although successfully com¬ peting in quality and price in the manufacture of the very best bar-iron, the proprietors cannot, by its instrumentality, make iron rails of sufficient hardness to compete with Bes¬ semer rails in wearing qualities. The Cleveland and North of England district is the most immense i> re¬ productive iron district in the world. It embraces less than Cleveland and three English counties — Northumberland, Durham, and the district. North Eiding of Yorkshire — and yet its annual production of pig-iron during the years 1871 to 1878, both inclusive. 20 UNIVERSAL EXPOSITION AT PARIS, 1878. great Britain, averaged over 2,000,000 English tons. In each of these North of Enn End years it produced more pig-iron than any other country, the district. United States alone excepted, and in the years 1875, 1876, and 1877 it produced more than the United States, the exact figures for 1877 being as follows : Cleveland, 2,138,378 tons ; United States, 2,066,594 tons. In 1878 the production of Cleveland declined to 2,023,177 tons, which was less than that of the United States in the same year. There are 165 Blast furnaces, blast furnaces in this district, some of them being the largest in the world. Of these, 92 were in blast and 73 were out of blast in December, 1878. In 1840 the number of blast furnaces was less than a dozen, and they were all small. The district produces about one-third of the total pig-iron product of Great Britain It also produces over Coal- 31,000,000 tons of coal annually, or about 23 per cent, of the immense coal product of the kingdom. Until a year or two ago it was also very prominent in the manufacture of Puddling fur- finished iron. Of 7,159 puddling furnaces in all Great Brit- 1HC€S. ain, 1,894 are to be found in this district. The extreme cheapness with which Cleveland pig-iron can be made brings it into successful competition with the pig-iron of Scotland and other districts of Great Britain, and with that of Bel¬ gium, Germany, and other Continental countries. The fact is, to be noted, however, that, notwithstanding this cheap¬ ness and the rapid growth of the Cleveland iron district in Exports of pig- the last ten years, the exports of pig-iron from all Great Britain since 1873 have annually been less than in 1871, showing that Cleveland pig-iron is merely taking the place in foreign markets of other British pig-iron, particularly that of Scotland. The district of South Staffordshire is the great center of the finished iron trade of England. It contains 125 separate and distinct iron works, or, as we say in our country, roll- aud pua’rtifn \"fur3 in8' mi^si having over 2,000 puddling furnaces, out of a total paces. 0f 7^159 in the whole of Great Britain. It also contains 148 Blast furnaces, blast furnaces out of a total of 977 in the kingdom. Of the whole number in the district only 38 were in blast in De¬ cember, 1878. But of the large iron interests packed in this small territory very little display was made at Paris. Several firms exhibited specimens of sheet-iron, some of which were bent into various shapes to show their excellent quality.

A prominent feature of the British agricultural machinery exhibit was the steam-plow, which has not yet been brought into use in either France or Amer¬ ica, except experimentally, although largely employed in England. The introduction of this great labor-saving ma¬ chine upon our Western prairies may be presumed to be among the possibilities of the near future, as may also the introduction upon American farms of another feature of histrySUgar in‘ European agriculture, the beet sugar industry. In the British section there was a display of stationary, portable, locomotive, fire, and marine engines that was almost be¬ wildering in its extent and variety. Galloway & Son, of Manchester, exhibited a 300-liorse- power engine which attracted much attention. It had two cylinders, one high and the other low pressure. The workmanship was excellent. Of steam-pumps, hydraulic cranes, and other hydraulic machinery, portable forges, steam-hammers, wood working machinery, and machine tools generally, the display was also large. Two steam-cranes, exhibited by Messrs. Appleby Brothers, deserve special mention. The exhibit of textile machinery was magnificent and unequaled. Steam-engines. Galloway & Son. Hydraulic ma¬ chinery.

It lias already been remarked that in the nature of things it is impossible to exhibit at an international exhibition many of the processes of iron and steel manufacture. In the British section there was, therefore, but little to sug¬ gest the methods by which the greatest iron and steel pro¬ ducing country in the world has attained its pre-eminence, whitweii stoves.

The adaptation of steel to ship-building was not shown in steel in ship- the British section by the presentation of comparative or ° 3 other tests made by the British admiralty or the British Lloyd’s, although experiments on a large scale, favorable to steel, had been made by both these agencies prior to the opening of the Exposition. These experiments related to the plating of the hulls of vessels and the general substi¬ tution in their frame- work and interior construction of steel where iron is now used. As these and earlier experiments have already resulted in the building of two steel vessels for the British Government and in contracts for the. build¬ ing of other vessels, it is to be regretted that no record was made at Paris of the reasons that have prompted action which may lead to a revolution in the construction of both naval and merchant vessels. Nor were the bridge-building steel iu bridge qualities of steel full}’ illustrated at Paris by Great Britain, although her engineers have made numerous experiments in its use for this purpose.

Great Britain is making great progress in the utilization of steel for all purposes to which it is adapted, the prefer¬ ence being for Bessemer and Siemens-Martin steel because of their cheapness. Steel boilers for stationary and loco¬ motive engines are largely manufactured. Steel car wheels have already been mentioned. The Sheffield cutlers have Bessemer steel commenced to use Bessemer steel in the manufacture of scissors and other cutlery. In some instances steel rail ends are used for this purpose, and in others steel of a desired quality is specially manufactured. In all railway appli¬ ances steel made by the Bessemer and the Siemens-Martin processes is rapidly displacing iron in Great Britain, as it is on the Continent. Iron, however, has found new friends in those inventors who have suggested its use in the eonstruc- for in- tion of the so-called permanent way of railroads, and vari- manent way of jr o 7 ous systems of this new permanent way are now in daily use on the Continent. In Great Britain one or two of them have been used experimentally, and a commencement has been made in shipping iron for the construction of the per¬ manent. way of an Indian railroad.

The story of Great Britain’s wonderful achievements in the manufacture of iron and steel is best told in the statis¬ tics of their production; and, in this connection, the statis¬ tics of her coal production should not be overlooked, for it is to the existence of her immense coal deposits that her prominence in the manufacture of iron and steel is mainly Make of iron in due. In 1735, one hundred and forty-four years ago, the total make of pig-iron in Great Britain was only 17,000 in 1804. English tons. In 1854, the epoch of the Crimean war, a quarter of a century ago, it had steadily increased to in i87i. 3,009,838 tons, and in 1871, seventeen years after 1854, this product was more than doubled, the production in that year in 1872. being 0,027,179 tons. In 1872 there was an increase to in 1877. 0,741,929 tons, the highest product yet attained. In 1877 the production was 0,008,604 tons, which was somewhat less than that of 1871. To fully realize the magnitude of these figures, comparison of them should be made with the fig¬ ures representing the world’s total production of pig-iron World’s pro-jn 1877. This total production was a fraction less than Auction of pig- . ^ ^ . . iron in 1877. 14,000,000 tons ; tlio production of pig-iron by Great Britain in that year was, therefore, almost one-half of that total IRON AND STEEL EXHIBITS: COMMISSIONER MORRELL. 25 Bnt Great Britain’s progress in the manufacture of steel GBEAT IiR1TALN'- has been much more rapid than the development of her ^stedmanutact- pig-iron industry. At the period of the Grimean war her ln 1854- annual production of all kinds of steel was only about 50,000 tons, but immediately after the close of that war the Bessemer process was invented, and in 1878 no less than production by 850,000 tons of steel were made by it alone in Great Britain. ®c^®“eri)10tcss In 1856 Dr. C.

Siemens and his brother Frederick in- ^Siemens Bru- vented the Siemens regenerative gas furnace, and in 1864 .Regenerative it was successfully applied to the production of steel by the Martin process. In 1878 there were produced in Great Britain by the Siemens- Martin process and its near relative, Sifmen8CtMartm the Siemens process, 174,000 tons of steel. The total pro- process m ms. duction of steel in Great Britain in 1878 is supposed to du^t[onh<.f steei have been 1,100,000 tons, which was nearly 40 per cent. ofm 1878- the world’s production of about 2,700,000 tons in that year. du^f0fnd 8 pi0' In producing her enormous annual yield of pig-iron Great Britain has mainly relied upon her own supplies of iron ore. In 1877 she mined 16,692,802 tons of ore, and imported ore 1,142.308 tons, principally from Spain and Algeria, for use in her Bessemer steel works. In the same year she ex¬ tracted 415,000 tons of “burnt ore” from imported cupreous pyrites, principally obtained in Spain. She thus smelted in 1877 a total of 18,250,110 tons of iron ore, from which were obtained 6,608,664 tons of pig-iron. Only two dis¬ tricts in Great Britain — Northwest Lancashire and Cumber¬ land — can supply large quantities of ore suitable for Bessemer steel. The importation of foreign ores for Besse- cess- mer purposes is absolutely necessary. The production of coal in Great Britain, keeping pace British ' A 0 A production. with that of pig-iron, has more than doubled since the pe¬ riod of the Crimean war. In 1854 it was 64,661,401 tons, and in 1875, twenty-one years afterwards, it was 131,867,105 tons. This product was increased in the following year to Foreign ores.

Britain to other countries will be seen in the following sum¬ mary. In 1872 the maximum of yearly exports of iron and steel and their manufactures was attained, when a total of 3,382,762 tons was exported. From 1872 to 1876 the expor¬ tation of these products gradually declined in quantity to 2,224,470 tons ; but in 1877 a slight increase to 2,344,651 tons took place, which was, however, not maintained in 1878. when 2,299,223 tons were exported. The value of British iron and steel exports has steadily declined from £37,731,239 in 1873 to £18,393,974 in 1878. The exportation of coal and coke from Great Britain to other countries gradually increased in late years until 1876, when a maximum exportation of 16,299,077 tons was attained. In 1877 the quantity sent abroad fell to 15,358,828 tons. In 1860 the exports amounted to 7,412,000. This quantity was more than doubled in 1876. About one-third of the total British production of coal is used in the home iron and steel industries. ir^and^teef °f The importation of iron and steel into Great Britain is annually increasing. The value of the importations in 1877 reached £1,943,622. The imports of coal into Great Britain are so small as not to justify the quotation of exact figures. Railways.

In 1862 the production reached 524,591 tons, which was more than doubled six years later, in 1868, when 1,200,188 tons were produced. In 1869, the year pre¬ ceding the beginning of the war with France, the produc¬ tion was 1,356,965 tons. In 1870 and 1871 it was practically stationary, but in 1872, after the accession of the French provinces, it jumped to 1,927,061 tons, and in 1873 it reached a maximum of 2,174,058 tons; adding castings from the blast furnace, the production in the last year was 2,240,575 tons. The production of pig-iron declined from 1873 to 1876, in which latter year it was 1,801,457 tons ; including 44,888 tons of castings from the blast furnace, it was 1,846,345 tons. These statistics show more rapid progress in the building up of the German iron industry than has been made in the United States. In 1848 the latter country produced Production m 1 United States in about 800,000 English tons of pig-iron ; and in 1873 a maxi- i848andi873. mum of 2,560,962 tons was reached.

As many. Germany has usually imported more pig-iron than she has exported, and as the accession of Alsace and Lorraine gave to her only about 230,000 tons of pig-iron annually, the greater progress of Germany from 1848 to 1873, as compared with the progress of the United States, is an interesting- fact, and is creditable to the enterprise and skill of the Ger¬ man people and to the natural resources of the empire. The growth of the pig-iron branch of the German iron iron and steel trade down to 1873 was fully equaled in rapidity by other manufactlires- branches of iron manufacture and by the manufacture of steel. In 1848 there were within the limits of the present empire 109 foundries for iron castings, employing 5,112 workmen, and in 1875 the number had increased to 874, employing 42,134 workmen. The production of these foun¬ dries increased from 131,929 metric tons in 1862 to 524,137 tons in 1873, but declined to 436,104 tons in 1876. The quantity of steel of all kinds produced in 1848 was 9,024 stgg™duction metre tons; in 1862 it was 40,916 tons; in 1876, when the maximum was attained, it was 390,434 tons.

Of the total production of mineral fuel by Germany in 1876, there were 38,454,428 tons of bituminous coal and 11,096,034 tons of lignite. ofRGenuanyraiS The foregoing statistics show that the German iron, steel, iionParnd coa ™ °f au(i coal industries have been almost wholly developed during the past thirty years, and that the iron industry proper reached the culmination of its prosperity in 1873. Germany is to day the third in rank among iron-making and steel-making nations, Great Britain and the United States alone outranking her, while she probably ranks next to Great Britain as a coal-producing country. Ores and coal. OrCS and COal. A study of the resources possessed by Germany for the manufacture of iron and steel shows that they are both ex- Abmidant. tensive and varied. Iron ore aud coal are abundant, and the quality of each favorably compares with that of like ac?uai 'and* refa- products of Great Britain and France. The coal, which is tivo- easily mined, is equal to English and Welsh coal for gen¬ erating steam, and the most of it yields good coke for the blast furnace. It is superior to that of France. The French people deserve great credit for producing good iron with Quality of ores. p00r coai. The ore is of all varieties, and no difficulty is experienced in working it, except that which is caused by the presence of too much phosphorus in some varieties, ren¬ dering them unsuitable for Bessemer steel. There are com¬ mercial difficulties, however, which consist in the general tion^of^oai^nd seParation ^ie coal and ore supplies, and in the remote- ore deposits. ness of both from centers of consumption and from the sea- coast. The coal deposits are found mainly in Silesia and Saxony, bordering on Austria, and in Westphalia and Rhenish Prussia, bordering on Holland and Belgium. The ore mines are found in the same provinces and in others lying mainly upon the interior boundary line of Germany, including Bavaria, Wiirtemberg, Alsace, Lorraine, and Lux¬ emburg; but wherever found they are not usually associated with the coal deposits.

For the same reason these products are largely debarred from foreign markets into which they would otherwise find a ready entrance; and, for the same reason, also, the cost of foreign ores for most of the Bessemer establishments of Germany, which are in the interior, is greatly increased beyond the cost of similar ores to British Bessemer steel manufacturers. The German iron trade at present labors under still another difficulty, in the removal, on the 1st Removal of ' • German import of January, 1877, of all import duties on iron and steel, duties on iron and The government is, however, giving close attention to the needs of the iron and coal industries.

The number of blast furnaces in Germany in 1876 was,, statistics of d blast furnaces. 463, of which 297 were in blast and 166 were out of blast. Gf the whole number of furnaces 338 were in Prussia, and of these 172 were in blast. The consumption of raw mate¬ rials in the production of a ton of pig-iron in Germany ranges from 2.5 to 2.8 tons of ore, from 2.8 to 3.2 tons of coal or coke, and from 1 to 1.5 tons of limestone. Many of the furnaces of Germany possess all the approved modern appliances, while comparatively few are wholly antiquated in style and naked in equipment. At Hof, in Bavaria, there Hof, in Bavaria, are four furnaces owned by one company, each of which is 57£ feet high, 19 feet in diameter, and supplied with four Whitwell stoves.

Two out of four furnaces of Berge- Borbeck, belonging to the Phoenix Company at Laar, pro¬ duced 27,982 tons of pig-iron in 1875, or a daily average of 76g tons. To produce this quantity of pig-iron there were required 59,575£ tons of ore, 39,151 tons of coke, and 27,305 tons of limestone. Better results than these have been obtained at other furnaces in Germany, but the above figures I find to have been deemed worthy of prominent mention. There is observable a vast amount of enterprise and skill in the management of the blast furnaces of Ger¬ many. One of the coke furnaces of the Hoerde Iron Works was continuously in blast from July 3, 1855, to May 29,1874, or almost nineteen years. German rolling mills and steel works are also mainly projected on a liberal and progressive scale. Krupp’s Steel Works, at Essen, in Rhenish Prussia, are well known to be the largest in the world. A recent publication enumerates 16 German iron and steel companies, each of which had either absorbed over 4,000,000 marks, or $1,000,000, or had- been organized with a capital stock of .this amount. One of these, the Konig and Laura Hiitte, had a capital of 27,000,000 marks, or $6,750,000; another, the Dortmund Union, 41,400,000 marks, or over $10,000,000; an¬ other, the Donersmarkhiite, 18,000,000 marks, or $4,500,000; another, the Phoenix, 16,200,000 marks, or $4,000,000 ; two others, the Hoerde and the Bochumer Yerein, had 15,000,000 marks each, or $3,750,000 ; and yet two others, the Preus¬ sische Company of Dusseldorf and the Westphiilische Union, had over 10,000,000 marks each, or over $2,500,000. These references show the large, not to say extravagant, scale on which many of the iron and steel works of Germany have been projected. Steel production. Germany early embarked a large amount of capital in the manufacture of Bessemer steel, although from the first the unwelcome fact was only too manifest that most of the ore suitable for its production would have to be imported, at least for some time. This disadvantage is now, however, not so great as formerly, domestic ores being mixed to a larger extent with foreign ores in the manufacture of Bes- Bessemer steel semer pig. The first Bessemer steel works in Germany were forks built about 1865, and in 1876 there were no less than 19 such establishments. Of these, 14 were in Prussia, 1 in Saxony, 2 in Bavaria, and 2 in Alsace and Lorraine. These 19 establish¬ ments contained 78 converters, of which 18 were embraced in Herr Krupp’s works at Essen. Three additional con- IRON AND STEEL EXHIBITS: COMMISSIONER MORRELL. 31 verters, or a total of 81, were enumerated in 1877. Only germ ax y. 39 converters were at work in that year, and some of them not steadily. In apparent contradiction of the praise jusi bestowed on the iron and steel metallurgy of Germany, tiL^YnGurman^’ figures have been produced to show that the average yield of German converters when at work is only between one- third and one-fourth that of converters in the United States. This is certainly not a creditable showing for Germany, but superior ces- u seiner practice it may be said in extenuation that the Bessemer practice 1g“at^e 0nitPl1 of the United States is not equaled by that of any other country in the world. Even Great Britain falls far behind it. With 114 converters, a majority of which may be pre¬ sumed to have been active, that country produced in 1878 dCompnraUve only 850,000 tons of ingots ; while the United States in the converter of Eng- same year, with 22 converters, not all of which were active, United states, produced exactly 653,773 English tons of ingots. Germany has made creditable progress in the introduction of the Sie¬ mens regenerative furnace and the Siemens-Martin process. The total production of all kinds of steel in Germany has tk^ot*tl 81J™|lu'1 already been given for comparative years, the production Gcrraaiiv’in1876- for 1876 being 390,434 metrical tons. The exact quantity of each kind of steel which entered into this total is not at hand, but the proportion of Bessemer steel, as well as the extent to which it is displacing iron in Germany, may be inferred from the following statistics of the production of iron and steel rails in the years 1871 to 1876: Tear.

The cast-steel manufactory at Essen has existed since the year 1810. It has been operated by the present owner, Alfred Krupp, since 1S2G, and since 1848 for his sole account. The number of workmen at the close of 1877 amounted to 8,500. The works occupy about 1,000 acres, of which about 187 acres are under roof. There are in these works 1,648 furnaces; 298 steam-boilers ; 77 steam-hammers, the largest of all weighing 50 tons; 18 trains of rolls; 294 steam-en¬ gines, aggregating 11,000 horse-power, one of the largest Machine tools, having 1,000 horsepower ; and 1,063 machine tools. When all existing facilities are employed the works cau produce Productive in 24 hours 2,700 rails, which will lay 11 £ English miles of track ; 350 ties ; 150 locomotive and car axles ; 180 car wheels; 1,000 railroad springs; 1,500 grenades, etc. In one mouth there can be produced 304 field guns and guns pro- of large caliber.

The process of casting steel in forms for use has been perfected and largely practiced in Ger¬ many, which country may also be said to have given the greatest impetus to the use of cast steel as a substitute for iron axles and tires upon railways.

In the building of locomotives she has achieved great distinction, and in the supply of neigh¬ boring Continental countries she has met with much success. In twelve locomotive works in Germany over 1,000 locomo¬ tives have been built annually. At the large locomotive Albert Bors;s- -works of Albert Borsig (recently deceased), at Berlin, 1,031 locomotives were manufactured in the six years prior to April, 1873, of which 300 were sent to Bussia. This large establishment and an auxiliary establishment in Up¬ per Silesia, under the same ownership, manufacture the pig- iron, rolled iron, steel, boiler plate, axles, etc., required in the construction of locomotives, and besides supply large quantities of these articles to the German market.

Henri Schneider, the head of the great firm of Schnei- Oerman iron m- der & Co., at Creusot, in France, is credited with the fol¬ lowing declaration before a government legislative commis¬ sion, in February, 1878, concerning the German iron trade: “There are a number of articles in which Germany competes with us with greater effect and is a more dangerous rival than England. The German makers are our chief competitors, and I attribute their formid¬ able development to several causes. In the first place, their industry is based on excellent natural conditions. Germany possesses very con¬ siderable mineral wealth, developed under healthy conditions, quite independently of the speculations which of late years have increased the production. Tn certain provinces, as, for instance, Nassau, and near Siegen, there are special kinds of ore producing a certain quality of iron under most advantageous conditions. Germany has now, too, in Lorraine, the finest deposits in the world for making iron cheaply. I think that ordinary pig-iron can be made cheaper at the present time in Lorraine and Luxemburg than in any place in the world. For iron ores, imported by German makers from Spain for their important make of steel, they enjoy very advantageous sea-carriage rates, and from sea¬ ports the forwarding rates into the interior are remarkably low.” Germany s ad¬ vantages of min¬ eral wealth, fa¬ vorable condi¬ tions of develop¬ ment, and cheap sea¬ board and inland rates of trans¬ portation. IRON AND STEEL EXHIBITS: COMMISSIONER MORRELL. 35 This is high praise from an industrial rival, but it is no- _ qekmany. ticeable that English makers of iron and steel speak slight¬ ingly of “dear and bad” German iron made with ore and coal that are found at inconvenient distances, the latter al¬ leged to be of poor quality, and the former largely phos- phoriferous. But M. Schneider would hardly express his B^t0™hpariS0nan°| dread of German competition in French markets if he had French opinions of German iron. nothing to be afraid of ; and it is just possible that English manufacturers would have a higher respect for Germany’s ability to supply herself with good iron and steel, at fair prices to consumers, if she were not so good a customer for Cleveland and Scotch pig-iron and English bars. To Ger- English export mauy and Holland (the latter almost wholly in transit for to Germany. Germany) Great Britain annually, during 1875, 1876, and 1877, exported over half a million tons of iron and steel. Against the revenue policy which would continue these large importations German ironmasters and their idle work¬ ingmen not unnaturally protest, and they ask that they shall be protected by adequate duties against the advantages possessed by British ironmasters, namely, “the sea for their roadway, cheap shipping, cheap machinery, cheap coal, and ^Argumont^ m the command of cheap capital.” They allege that if ade-tion to German quate protection had been afforded them in late years, the dustries. excessive importations of iron and steel from Great Britain would not have been possible, and that their own industries and all other German industries would have measurably prospered. The anomaly is here presented of France dreading the French fear of apprehended competition in her markets of German iron and GciraJn rivalr> steel, and of Germany protesting against the competition, already formidable and oppressive, of British iron and steel in German markets. We have here also illustrated one phase of industrial competition from which the United States is practically free, the contiguity or proximity of the territory of an industrial rival. Germany has undoubtedly te^ea^”st suffered greatly from British competition, which was ren- ish competition, dered possible by reason of the advantages stated and the repeal two years ago of German duties on iron and steel; while Germany herself, by reason of her acquisition of the iron-making districts of Alsace and Lorraine, and for the other reasons assigned by M. Schneider, occupies a threat¬ ening industrial attitude toward France. It seems clear Probable result were free trade that, if trade between these three countries were absolutely flowed between free from all restrictions, the German and the French iron and steel industries would both be injured, and those of Great Britain only would be benefited. 36 UNIVERSAL EXPOSITION AT PARIS, 1878.
