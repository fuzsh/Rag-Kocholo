        "text": "Under Article 7 of the Code of Conduct for Members of the European Parliament regarding integrity and transparency, Members must publish online all meetings relating to parliamentary business which are scheduled either with interest representatives or with diplomats and representatives of third countries.\n\nThis obligation was first created in July 2019 and was extended to its current scope in November 2023. The meetings declared can be found on each Member’s profile page on the European Parliament website, and in each parliamentary procedure’s entry on the Legislative Observatory. You can also search the entire database of declared meetings using the search form, and extract the information in your preferred format."
