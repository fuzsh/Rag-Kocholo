Origin, Meaning, And History Of Kana

Kana is a gender-neutral name with diverse origins. In Japanese, it is said to mean ‘powerful,’ depending on the Kanji combinations, Kana may carry several other meanings. For instance, it may be a combination of the characters 香 (ka), meaning ‘incense, perfume,’ and 佳 (ka), meaning ‘excellent, beautiful’ with 菜 (na), meaning ‘vegetables, green.’ In Hawaiian, it is a form of the name Hannah and means ‘grace.’ Additionally, it is also believed to have Finnish origins, where it translates to ‘hen’ or ‘chicken.’

In Hawaiian legends, Kana was a Maui demigod who was powerful and kind. He was born in Hāmākualoa, Maui, as a piece of rope to his goddess mother, Hina. He was raised and taught by his grandmother Uli in Hilo, Hawaiʻi island until he became a human. In his human form, he grew significantly large, and his house had to be stretched from the mountain to the sea for Kana to fit. He had special powers that allowed him to stretch across the Hawaiian islands, walk from one island to another, and even cross the channels between them. In one famous story, Kana saved his mother, Hina, who was kidnapped by a chief on Moloka’i. He used his incredible stretching powers to span the sea and, with the help of his brother Niheu, transformed the land where his mother was held captive. Through this transformation, it’s believed that turtles in the sea were created (1).

The name Kana appears numerous times in the world of popular culture.
