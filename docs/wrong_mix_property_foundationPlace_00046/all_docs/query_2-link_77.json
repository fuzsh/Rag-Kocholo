        "text": "Kelsey Booth\n\nData Analyst, Center for Applied Brain & Cognitive Sciences\n\nBio: Kelsey graduated from University at Buffalo (SUNY) in 2022 with a Master’s degree in Math Education Studies and in 2021 with a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics. She is working as a data analyst at the center. Outside of work, Kelsey enjoys playing games, attending sporting events, and spending time with her family and cat.\n\nSara Anne Goring, Ph.D.\n\nPostdoctoral Researcher, Center for Applied Brain & Cognitive Sciences\n\nBio: Sara Anne Goring earned her PhD in Psychology from Claremont Graduate University in 2023, working with Andrew Conway on models of reading comprehension, cognitive aging, and psychometric measurement. She also holds a BA in psychology from University of Missouri Kansas City, and an MA in psychological sciences from the University of Colorado Colorado Springs. Sara’s research includes higher-order/psychometric modeling of individual difference factors, and language-related phenomena such as semantic illusions and disfluent speech production/comprehension.\n\nDaniel Grover\n\nSenior Programmer Analyst, Center for Applied Brain and Cognitive Sciences\n\nBio: Dan received his Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Game Design from Northeastern University in 2016. His experience as a game designer led him to become a Unity programmer for the center. Dan is responsible for creating virtual environments, virtual entities, and scripted behaviors to simulate military-relevant scenarios and collect multi-modal data from streaming devices. With over 5 years of experience at the center, he has also recently taken on the important role of maintaining, updating, upgrading, and ensuring proper functioning (including software/hardware integration) of the center's virtual reality caves. In addition to his work, he enjoys sports, playing video games, food, and spending time with family and friends.\n\nHannah Hart-Pomerantz\n\nSenior Research Coordinator, Center for Applied Brain & Cognitive Sciences\n\nBio: Hannah is a graduate of the University of California Santa Cruz in 2020 with a B.S. in Cognitive Science. Before joining the center, she worked as a research assistant in the High Level Perception Lab at the University of California Santa Cruz. She also served as the lab manager for a portion of her time there. She will be assisting with a variety of projects at the center.\n\nMarissa Marko Lee, Ph.D.\n\nPostdoctoral Researcher, Center for Applied Brain & Cognitive Sciences\n\nBio: Marissa received her Ph.D. in Neuroscience from American University in 2023. During that time, she worked with Dr. Catherine Stoodley examining the role of the cerebellum in cognition and developmental disorders (e.g., developmental dyslexia, autism) using a wide variety of methodologies including neuroimaging and neuromodulation. Her research interests include continuing to investigate neuromodulatory methods in humans and how they could potentially be applied in real-world settings. Outside of work, she enjoys reading sci-fi and fantasy novels, listening to live music, and spending time with her cat, Avocato.\n\nJames McIntyre\n\nResearch Engineer, Center for Applied Brain & Cognitive Sciences and Tufts Institute for Artificial Intelligence\n\nBio: James received his Bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Engineering (2020) and a Master’s in Electrical Engineering (2022) from the University of Rhode Island. During this time, he was a Research Assistant in an academic lab working with non-invasive neuroimaging modalities such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). His research interests focus on the intersection of machine learning and neuroscience. In addition to his work, he enjoys weight lifting, video games, and spending time with his dogs.\n\nKana Okano, PhD\n\nCognitive Scientist, Principal Investigator, Center for Applied Brain and Cognitive Sciences\n\nBio: Kana received her Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology from Tufts University in 2012, working with Professor Phillip Holcomb on visual word recognition using ERP. Before becoming a Research Associate at CABCS, she completed her post-doctoral work at MIT with John Gabrieli and Susan Whitfield-Gabrieli and a Research Scientist position at MIT Integrated Learning Initiative. Her background involves using various neuroimaging techniques (EEG, MEG, fMRI) to understand the neural underpinnings and functions underlying higher-level cognitive processes.\n\nMadelyn K. Sandone\n\nSenior Research Coordinator, Center for Applied Brain and Cognitive Sciences\n\nBio: Madelyn graduated from the University of Tampa in 2022 with a B.A. in Psychology. While at UT, she worked with Dr. Sarah Orban as a research assistant, examining the role of ADHD and executive functioning in symptoms of boredom, smartphone usage and nomophobia, and emotion regulation. She assists with experimental execution and development for a variety of projects at the center. In addition to her work, Madelyn enjoys traveling to new places, dancing, sunshine, and a good smoothie.\n\nMarisa Smith\n\nSenior Research Coordinator, Center for Applied Brain and Cognitive Sciences\n\nBio: Marisa graduated from Temple University with a B.A in Psychology. Before joining the center, she worked as a Research Assistant in the Research in Spatial Cognition Lab at Temple. Additionally, she worked as a Research Assistant for the All of Us Research Program at Newton-Wellesley Hospital. She will be assisting with a variety of projects at the center.\n\nEric Streeter, BFA, AAS\n\nGraphic Designer, Center for Applied Brain and Cognitive Sciences\n\nBio: Eric received his BFA in Illustration from the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) and an AAS in Geodetic Survey and Mapping from the Defense Mapping School at Fort Belvoir. Prior to joining CABCS in 2018, Eric worked as a Creative Director at CGI Concepts, an Adjunct Professor at RISD, and a Senior Artist at LG Balfour. As a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, Eric applies his military background to the design of photorealistic technical visualizations, including operational environments and adaptive camouflage patterning."
