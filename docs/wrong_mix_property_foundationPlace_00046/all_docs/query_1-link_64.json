        "text": "John and Kelly want to open a business bank account to keep the funds from their auto repair shop separate from their personal funds.\n\nRates and fees vary from bank to bank, so John and Kelly visit multiple banks in the area. They bring along their business documents, including their business license and Employer Identification Number (EIN). They open a checking and savings account at a bank that gives them a favorable introductory offer and has low fees.\n\nJohn and Kelly also open a credit card account, which they’ll use to make business-related purchases and build a credit history. They can use the line of credit in an emergency to keep their business running smoothly.\n\nJohn and Kelly also want to open a merchant services account, which allows them to accept credit and debit card payments from customers. These accounts charge various transaction fees and require a minimum number of monthly transactions. John and Kelly carefully consider the fees associated with each merchant services provider before selecting the best one for their business.\n\nCustomers can now securely pay John and Kelly’s business — with cash, check, or card — rather than pay John and Kelly themselves."
