        "text": "8 Feb â€“ Kanako Miyashita recently announced that she is retiring from showbiz.\n\nThe \"Whisper of the Heart\" actress shared the news on social media, saying that she will be retiring from the industry at the end of March after much thought.\n\n\"It was a decision that required courage and determination, and I was very worried, but I thought that there might be other places where I could free my mind and express myself. I came to this decision because I wanted to see the wider world,\" she added.\n\nKanako, however, revealed that she will be releasing her collection of works called \"MUSEUM\", saying that she made it with all her heart.\n\n\"I hope that you will enjoy it as if you were visiting an art museum,\" she added.\n\nKanako made her debut in 2015 through the movie, \"The Edge of Sin\", and has starred in several movies and dramas since then, including \"Prison 13\" and \"Dearest\"."
