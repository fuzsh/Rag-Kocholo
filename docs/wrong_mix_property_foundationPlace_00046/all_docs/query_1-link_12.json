        "text": "The biggest political divide is not between LEFT and RIGHT, but between those who DO and DON'T follow politics, according to Professor Yanna Krupnikov of the University of Michigan. She explains something I‚Äôve long noticed: people who talk about issues nonstop can feel intimidating, and, frankly, a little exhausting, for those who are less focused on issues. I learned this on the #EzraKleinShow last week, and was fascinated. Here are some of the takeaways from the podcast; by ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù I mean issues, elections and civic engagement in general, not just candidate races: ü•ñ People who don‚Äôt follow politics still vote. We shouldn‚Äôt ignore this group. However, they‚Äôre more focused on everyday issues like grocery prices and housing affordability, than wonky economic indicators. ü•≥ There is a bigger difference between engaged and disengaged Democrats than disengaged Democrats and Republicans. Party preference isn‚Äôt everything. üòè Seeing people who talk (or post) non-stop about politics may be alienating to people who are less-engaged. I‚Äôve noticed a feedback loop this year where some people say they‚Äôre posting about certain issues more because they don‚Äôt see others do the same. I wonder what impact this has had more broadly. üíó Can we get people who are disengaged to care, or is that a pipe dream? This topic needs a LOT more research. Even if people don‚Äôt follow politics closely, they still hear about elections and issues through the media they follow. Joe Rogan was mentioned as someone who isn‚Äôt expressly political but does have vibes about issues and candidates. Thus, working with influencers and content creators can be a powerful way to reach disengaged people. This doesn‚Äôt mean we should stop talking about the issues that matter to our communities; just that we have room to try many approaches. Klein shared how hard it can be for traditional institutions to reach disengaged voters by, say, working with creators and influencers. That is so far far from my own experience at Asian American Futures. We‚Äôve had an amazing experience working with Social Currant, a GenZ-led creator agency. They recruited creators who don‚Äôt make issue-based content to help us explain the Supreme Court decision on race in college admissions, and the importance of mental healthcare to AAPIs. This year, we‚Äôre working with VietRISE and AAPI Victory Fund's c3 team to teach creators about local issues and get out the vote in Orange County. The outreach to creators has been overwhelmingly positive. People like Mikka Kei Macdonald at Community Change, and Oluwakemi Oso and Kate Gage at Cooperative Impact Lab, have been doing this longer and at an even bigger scale. I‚Äôm excited to see how working with creators and influencers to reach out to young, less-engaged, potential voters can make a difference for AAPI communities.
