        "text": "The members of Chai can’t stop smiling. On a Wednesday night in early September, the Japanese quartet is making its live New York debut, and their presence is sheer glee. Mana, Kana, Yuki, and Yuna are dressed in matching bubblegum pink jumpsuits with a wide-leg cut inspired by a character from the Hayao Miyazaki anime film Castle in the Sky. They trade delightfully simple synchronized dance moves. They perform an a capella, Japanese-language cover of ABBA’s “Dancing Queen.” These crowd-pleasing embellishments are all in service of the exuberant, sleek mashup of pop, R&B, funk, rock, and hip-hop that comprises Chai’s fantastic debut, Pink—originally released last fall through Sony in Japan, and now out in the U.S. through California indie Burger Records. Moments of pure joy are in short supply these days; a Chai show is a reprieve.\n\nChai’s discernible delight might seem incongruent with the stated mission of their band: to dismantle and subvert notions of cuteness that its members feel are so repressive in Japan. They call the overriding concept of their band “Neo-Kawaii,” or “New Cute”—a phrase they coined to signal a move towards the embrace and celebration of human imperfection. The first song Chai ever wrote together, “Gyaranboo,” is about body hair; Yuki describes its theme as “I’m hairy, oh well.” But “Neo-Kawaii” is properly summarized on the single “N.E.O.” from Pink, which directly comments on oppressive beauty standards, offering a list of supposed imperfections that translate to “Small eyes/Flat nose/No shape/Fat legs!” Chai seek to reclaim them as perfect.\n\nThe day after the show, at Chai’s request, we meet at a quiet Chinese restaurant in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, in search of one thing: dumplings. Chai are dumpling aficionados. The band even has a song about dumplings, which they say is their only love song. Speaking through their translator, Rena, who works with Sony, Yuki elaborates: “We realized we don’t feel super heartbroken or like we’re going through things in relationships. So instead, what do we all love? Food! And what kind of food do we all love? Gyozas!” This gastronomic approach to songwriting, as well as their slightly eccentric eclecticism, might bring to mind their Japanese forebears in Cibo Matto, but Chai is more of a pop band—albeit a crucially self-directed one.\n\nIdentical twin sisters Mana, on keys and lead vocals, and Kana, on guitar, compose Chai’s melodies and chords, respectively. They met Yuna, the drummer, in a high school music program. Later, at college near their bustling hometown of Nagoya, they connected with Yuki, who had never envisioned herself as a musician. Nevertheless, she learned how to play the bass in a year and became the band’s primary lyricist. (Chai only use stage names and are hesitant to share details that might reveal their ages.)\n\nThe foursome were liberated, in a sense, at college, where they first discovered that the standards of beauty and cuteness they grew up with could be obliterated simply by looking at things from a different angle. College is also where they heard Western music for the first time—they only heard Japanese music growing up—and discovered the stylistically voracious bands that would influence them, like Beastie Boys and N.E.R.D. Pink opens with the phrase “hi hi hip-hop rap time” and, a couple of tracks later, arrives at a song with an opening riff reminiscent of “All Right Now” by the ’70s rock band Free. Their inspirations are all over: Tom Tom Club, Justice, Basement Jaxx, Devo. (At a recent L.A. show, Devo’s Jerry Casale showed up, and they cried.)\n\nPitchfork: Your show in New York was so joyful. Where does your energy come from onstage?\n\nChai [in unison]: Food.\n\nYuna: Especially yesterday. We had chicken and waffles before we performed.\n\nYuki: But also the relationship between the four of us. It’s like a new family.\n\nKana: We give each other a little chant before every show: You guys are cute! We’re cute! We're awesome! We build each other up. When we play, all that energy is released.\n\nYou’ve made it a goal to subvert the idea of kawaii. How did the concept of kawaii affect you growing up?\n\nMana: In Japanese society, cute people are the ones that are popular, and cute things are the ones that are hip. Cute is a standard, and everything else is ugly. It affected me a lot, because I didn’t feel like I was a part of that standard. People really get hurt by the word “cute”—if you don’t fit into that, it really bothers them. It’s something that stays on your mind. It’s a huge insecurity. For some reason that word is very strong. That’s why we decided to make songs about the fact that everyone is cute.\n\nYuki: Also, as a child, instead of looking at different people and saying, “Oh this is cute about you” and pointing out people’s differences, they have a standard of cute, and most of the girls who are that standard look the same. Instead of telling a person you’re fine the way you are, they say, “If you do this, you can look like them.” People used to say that my face was large—in Japan, for some reason, they like smaller, thinner faces—and tell me, “Oh, if you put your hair down, you could be a cute girl.” Instead of, “You’re fine the way you are,” it’s more like, “How do you fix yourself?”\n\nKana: Even within families or people you grew up with in your neighborhood, people will be like, “You should do the surgery and make your eyes a little bigger.” It’s a weird cultural thing. In school, the girls with the bigger eyes were the ones that were considered pretty and popular. The whole time growing up in Japan, I had no idea there was anything else that was considered cute—because I was always in Japan only. So the first time I went to college and saw that people overseas don’t even care about things like this, I was like, “Whoa.” I realized there was another “pretty” outside of what Japan kept calling pretty. That’s what helped us realize that we’re not going to care about cute anymore.\n\nYuki: In Japan, being cute is probably the biggest compliment you can give a woman. And culturally, people don’t really compliment one another. People don’t really go up to someone and say, “I like your shirt” or “I like your shoes.” So when you’re not considered a part of that cute standard, people don’t say anything to you. In America, people just say: “You’re beautiful,” “You have nice clothes.” I love that about America. Since they don’t do that in Japan, it hits women harder when they’re not called cute. That’s the reason we made the songs now, to say it doesn’t matter. We are what we are. We’re happy with that.\n\nDid anyone encourage you to play music growing up?\n\nYuki: I didn’t grow up listening to music. My parents didn’t play music at all. I had no idea I wanted to be a musician. When I was younger, I only heard J-pop, so I actually thought music was boring. I never found any interesting music, so I never listened to it.\n\nYuna: When I was in elementary school, there was this band in Japan called Orange Range who were really popular. I was actually hardcore crushing on the drummer, so much that I realized, “Maybe I’m interested in the drums, too.” I decided to find a high school with a music program, to do drumming in school. I met Kana and Mana in that high school.\n\nMana: There’s this idol group in Japan called Morning Musume—it’s kind of like the K-pop girl groups. After I saw them on TV when I was 7 years old, I wanted to be a singer. I wanted to join the group.\n\nKana: We both wanted to be singers growing up. But then I realized that there’s too many people who want to be singers; we can’t all sing. We were in a music class in our high school. At the time, I was playing drums. I never wanted to play guitar, I hated guitar. My teacher, who played guitar in a funk band, kind of threw me into the guitar. I would just copy him and how he would play. After that class, I actually started getting into funk. I fell in love with the guitarist from Tower of Power.\n\nYuki: In Japan, a lot of girls in bands don’t play an instrument. We wanted to show that we could actually play. That’s a part of what’s cool in our world: being women who can actually play.\n\nWhat about the color pink resonates with you?\n\nYuki: In Japan, most girls like pink when they’re little. There is this cultural understanding that when you’re a young girl, you can wear pink, but as you grow older, pink is not the color for you. What we are trying to say is that pink is for everybody at every age. We wanted people to know it’s a cool color and it shows woman power. Our pink outfits show we’re not just cute: This is what cool women wear. The reason the outfits have the belly button [cut out] is, in Japan, people tend to be reserved, and they don’t show their skin. And we want to do the opposite, like: We don’t care. We’re free."
