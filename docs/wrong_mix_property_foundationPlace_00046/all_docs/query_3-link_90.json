MET surveys can be used for both on and offshore geo-microbial surveys, and has been used in a wide variety of environments Canadian tundra, Ecuadorian rainforests, Peruvian deserts, and oceanic sediments. The MET process is also an environmentally friendly method of exploration, as there is no special equipment, chemicals, or explosives used during sample collection. The MET technology is able to judge the microbial populations of hydrocarbon degrading microbes present within the soils. Geo-microbial surveys are a cost effective way to survey over a large area. The MET process is cost effective, precise, accurate, and timely. MET surveys are a useful tool when used in conjunction with seismic surveys. Geo-microbial surveys are able to identify surface anomalies, and when compared with the results of a seismic survey you would be able to see where surface signals correlate with sub-surface structures identified by the seismic survey. With only the seismic survey you would be able to identify sub-surface structures, but without the geo-microbial survey you would not know if the sub-surface structure is charged with hydrocarbons.
