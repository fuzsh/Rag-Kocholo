        "text": "American actress and filmmaker (born 1989)\n\nAnna Kay Napualani Akana (born August 18, 1989)[2] is an American actress, comedian, filmmaker, musician, and YouTuber. She has appeared in TV series, films, and music videos that include Awkward (2011), Ant-Man (2015), Hello, My Name is Doris (2016), and Dirty 30 (2016).\n\nIn 2015, she launched a clothing line Ghost & Stars. She is the author of So Much I Want to Tell You: Letters to My Little Sister (2017), in which she describes her struggles and experiences.[3]\n\nAkana's father was an officer in the United States Marine Corps, including during her childhood.[4] Her father moved every few years to a new state or country.[5] In a 2020 interview, she said that she loved Sailor Moon, Inuyasha, and Ranma ½, expressing her surprise that her dad would make them watch Tenchi Muyo! with him despite its \"perverted\" nature.[6] Her father stated that she loved shows like The Powerpuff Girls, animation in general, and anime, the latter especially because she spent \"four years growing up in Japan\".\n\nOn February 14, 2007, Akana's younger sister, Kristina, died by suicide aged 13.[7] Several months after, Akana watched Margaret Cho perform on a Comedy Central special and laughed for the first time since her sister's death. She began to see laughter as a means of trying to move on with her life and decided to seriously pursue comedy.[8] Akana has been vocal about her sister's suicide and is a strong advocate for suicide prevention. In 2013, Akana uploaded a YouTube video, \"please don't kill yourself\", in which she explains how it felt for her to have a family member die by suicide.[9] In that same year, she released a book Surviving Suicide which contains her journal entries from the two years after her sister's death.[10]\n\nIn October 2018, she came out as bisexual.[11]\n\nIn 2019, she stated that she had undergone an abortion when she was twenty and felt it was one of the best decisions she had ever made.[12] She later presented her story as a movie for YouTube titled \"Take Your Birth Control\".[13] Akana is of Japanese, Filipino, Hawaiian, Spanish, French, Irish, German, and English descent.[14][15]\n\nAkana first started performing comedy at age 19 but switched to YouTube video performances in 2011 after experiencing panic attacks and anxiety before going on stage.[8] She later resumed performing stand-up onstage.\n\nIn 2014, Akana formed a comedy music duo, Cat Benatar, with fellow comedian and writer Megan Rosati.[16] (The duo's name is wordplay for the pop singer Pat Benatar.)\n\nAkana creates both comedy and documentary YouTube videos.[17] In 2014, Akana was listed on New Media Rockstars Top 100 Channels, ranked at #72.[18] In that same year, Akana decided to focus more on her skills as a director and attempted to make one short film a month.[19] While she did not reach her goal of twelve short films, she did make six short films which were received well by her YouTube audience. Akana starred in all of her short films and has starred in various other short films, and she has since continued to create short films.[20]\n\nOne of her short films, Miss Earth, was partially financed by Brian Grazer and Ron Howard's production company, New Form Digital. It was part of the 2014 Incubator, a series to showcase and produce original stories by YouTube Creators and filmmakers.[21][22][23] Miss Earth was later adapted into a web series, Miss 2059, and released on Verizon's go90 app in June 2016, with a second season released in late 2017.[24][25][26][27][28]\n\nAkana executive produced and starred as the lead role in the original comedy-drama web television series Youth & Consequences, created by Jason Ubaldi and released in March 2018 on YouTube Red. She is also the host of the web series Crash Course Business: Entrepreneurship beginning in August 2019.[29]\n\nOn October 10, 2019, she was featured in a 30-minute YouTube documentary created by SoulPancake in collaboration with Funny or Die wherein a variety of comedians discuss mental health called Laughing Matters.[30]\n\nIn 2011, Akana appeared in the TV series Awkward. In that same year, she also appeared as an extra in Katy Perry's \"Last Friday Night\" music video.[31]\n\nIn 2015, she appeared in the films Ant-Man and Kids vs Monsters.\n\nAkana starred in Snapper Hero, a scripted video series distributed via Snapchat.[32] The series was sponsored by AT&T.[32]\n\nIn 2016, Akana appeared alongside Sally Field in the indie comedy film Hello, My Name Is Doris, written by Michael Showalter.[33] That same year, she also appeared in a short Star Wars fan film, Hoshino[34] as well as the comedy film Dirty 30.\n\nShe has a recurring role in the Comedy Central show Corporate.[35]\n\nShe also has supporting roles as Gloria Sato in the Disney Channel show Big City Greens and Sasha Waybright in Amphibia.\n\nIn 2019, she announced on Ryan Higa's Off the Pill podcast to be part of the Netflix original Jupiter's Legacy.\n\nAkana also hosts the podcast Explain Things to Me with fellow comedian Brad Gage where the two interview experts in various fields about their work.[36]\n\nIn 2021, Akana was announced as starring alongside Emma Roberts in the romantic comedy About Fate.\n\nIn 2015, Akana released a clothing line, Ghost & Stars, which features several cat-themed designs as well as formal dresses, leggings, and a variety of T-shirts.[37]\n\nIn 2017, Akana's book So Much I Want to Tell You: Letters to My Little Sister was published. The book describes Akana's struggles and experiences growing up and offers advice to her late sister.[3]\n\nIn 2019, Akana transitioned from comedy into music, and upon so, released her debut single, \"Intervention\". Its music video was directed by Auden Bui.[38][39] She has since released two more music videos, one for \"Pretty Girls Don't Cry\" in July 2019 and \"Not My Proudest Moment\" in August. She continued to release music videos for songs named \"Alone Together\", \"Disappointment\", and \"Let Me Go\". Her debut album, Casualty, came out in October 2019.[40] Her follow up project came out early 2021 called No Longer Yours.[41][42]\n\nIn reviewing her video, \"Why Guys Like Asian Girls\" (which references \"Yellow Fever\", a term for an Asian fetish),[43] Cate Matthews of The Huffington Post wrote: \"A step-by-step takedown of 'yellow fever' or the desire to date Asian women often accompanied by bizarre, offensive attempts to do so, could start the healing. Luckily for us, YouTuber Anna Akana was more than up to the video-making task.\"[44]\n\nIn reviewing her video, \"How to Deal with a Breakup\", MTV wrote: \"In this sketch, comedian Anna Akana envisions the flurry of activity inside the cranial command center of a newly single dumpee.\"[45]\n\nDeadline referred to Akana as \"a prolific online creator whose channel boasts 60 million views and 900,000 subscribers, and last year wrote and starred in her own narrative feature Riley Rewind, scoring a none-too-shabby 20M views online.\"[33]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2013 Inappropriate Comedy Student driver 2014 Here She Is Miss Hawaii Also writer 2015 Ant-Man Writer in Luis' story Kids vs Monsters Daisy 2016 Hello, My Name Is Doris Blogger Dirty 30 Ashley Driscoll 2017 You Get Me Lydia 2018 Next Gen Ani Voice[46] 2019 Go Back to China Sasha Li 2019 Let It Snow Kerry 2020 Hooking Up Elizabeth Carthright 2021 So Much TBA Television film, pre-production 2022 Blade of the 47 Ronin Luna Netflix Original Film 2024 Big City Greens the Movie: Spacecation Gloria Sato, Additional voices Voice[47]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2011 Awkward Asian girl Episode: \"Knocker Nightmare\" 2012 Shake It Up Tomoka Episode: \"Made in Japan\" The Beauty Inside Alex #29 5 episodes 2013–2014 The Fosters Lily 2 episodes 2016 Adam Ruins Everything Female Shopper Episode: \"Adam Ruins Shopping Malls\" 2017 Stitchers Amanda Weston Recurring role;
