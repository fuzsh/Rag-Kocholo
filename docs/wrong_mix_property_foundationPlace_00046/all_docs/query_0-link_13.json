        "text": "Castle captivated audiences for years — and its abrupt cancelation and alleged on-set drama has stayed with fans since its 2016 end.\n\nThe ABC drama premiered in 2009 and teamed up the unlikely duo of author Richard Castle (Nathan Fillion) and Detective Kate Beckett (Stana Katic). The reluctant partnership between Castle and Beckett eventually evolved into a crime-fighting duo that couldn’t be denied.\n\nIn April 2016, news broke that Katic was being written off the show during season 8 due to alleged budget cuts. However, a source exclusively told Us Weekly at the time that Katic’s offscreen tension with Fillion led to her exit.\n\n“Nathan has been nasty to Stana for a long time,” the insider said, while a second source told Us, “It got so out of hand they made Stana and Nathan go to couples counseling together.”\n\nKatic’s rep denied there were any issues with Fillion shortly before confirming her exit. In May 2016, ABC canceled Castle with its final episode airing that same month.\n\nScroll down to see what the cast of Castle is doing now:"
