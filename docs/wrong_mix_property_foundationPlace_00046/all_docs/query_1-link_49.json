        "text": "Most drug plans charge a monthly fee that varies by plan. You pay this in addition to the Part B premium . If you're in a Medicare Advantage Plan (Part C) or Medicare Cost Plan with drug coverage, the monthly premium may include an amount for drug coverage.\n\nGet your premium automatically deducted\n\nContact your plan (not Social Security or the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB)) if you want your premium deducted from your monthly Social Security or RRB payment (called \"premium withholding\"). If you want to stop premium deductions and get billed directly, contact your plan.\n\nYour plan will tell you when premium withholding is set up or if there are any problems. It may take up to 3 months to start.\n\nIf you don’t start having premiums withheld from your Social Security payment until 1 -2 months after you joined a drug plan, you’ll get a bill for those months from your drug plan. You’ll need to pay this bill directly to your drug plan.\n\nWhat happens to my premium withholding if I switch plans?\n\nHow much does Part D cost?\n\nMost people only pay their Part D premium. If you don't sign up for Part D when you're first eligible, you may have to pay a Part D late enrollment penalty.\n\nIf you have a higher income, you might pay more for your Medicare drug coverage. If your income is above a certain limit ($103,000 if you file individually or $206,000 if you’re married and file jointly), you’ll pay an extra amount in addition to your plan premium (sometimes called “Part D-IRMAA”). You’ll also have to pay this extra amount if you’re in a Medicare Advantage Plan that includes drug coverage. This doesn’t affect everyone, so most people won’t have to pay an extra amount. The chart below lists the extra amount costs by income.\n\nSocial Security will contact you if you have to pay Part D IRMAA, based on your income. The amount you pay can change each year. If you have to pay a higher amount for your Part D premium and you disagree (for example, if your income goes down), use this form to contact Social Security [PDF, 125 KB]. If you have questions about your Medicare drug coverage, contact your plan.\n\nIf Social Security notifies you about paying a higher amount for your Part D coverage, you’re required by law to pay the Part D-Income Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (Part D IRMAA). If you don’t pay the Part D IRMAA, you’ll lose your Part D coverage.\n\nEmployer/Union coverage and Part D IRMAA\n\nThings to remember\n\nPay your Part D IRMAA bill to Medicare as soon as you get it. Find out how to pay your bill.\n\nKeep your address current with Social Security, even if you don’t get a Social Security check.\n\nPart D premiums by income\n\nThe chart below shows your estimated prescription drug plan monthly premium based on your income as reported on your IRS tax return. If your income is above a certain limit, you'll pay an income-related monthly adjustment amount in addition to your plan premium. If you've had a life-changing event that reduced your household income, you can ask Social Security to lower the additional amount you'll pay.\n\n2024\n\nIf your filing status and yearly income in 2022 was:"
