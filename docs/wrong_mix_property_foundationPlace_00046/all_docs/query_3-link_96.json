The pharmaceutical industry has been sadly misleading the public for years and as a result, we now have a huge health crisis. Cheef Botanicals will strive to spread the truth about natural alternatives, and educate people about the risks and costly side effects of many pharmaceutical drugs. We believe that consuming natural occurring superfoods will help lower the risk of certain illnesses and promote overall health and wellness. We want to stop the homeostatic imbalances caused by modern-day medication and bring back the stability, balance, and equilibrium that your body was meant to have. Cheef Botanicals will continue to provide access to useful education, research and share with you real customer experiences through forums, social media, and news articles.\n\nCannabis • Consumer Web • eCommerce • Software\n\nIrvine, California, USA\n\n700 Employees\n\nWM Technology, Inc.’s (Nasdaq: MAPS) mission is to power a transparent and inclusive global cannabis economy. Now in its second decade, WM Technology has been a driving force behind much of the legislative change we’ve seen in the past 10 years. Founded in 2008, WM Technology, is a leading technology and software infrastructure provider to the cannabis industry, comprising a B2C platform, Weedmaps, and B2B software, WM Business. The cloud-based SaaS solutions from WM Business provide an end-to-end operating system for cannabis retailers.

Through its website and mobile apps, WM Technology provides consumers with the latest information about cannabis retailers, brands, and products, facilitating product discovery and driving engagement with our retail and brand customers. WM Technology holds a strong belief in the power of cannabis and the importance of enabling safe, legal access to consumers worldwide.

Headquartered in Irvine, California, WM Technology supports remote work for all eligible employees. Visit us at www.weedmaps.com. 5/23/2022: Notice to prospective Weedmaps job applicants: Our team has been made aware of incidents involving LinkedIn, Telegram, and Facebook accounts impersonating Weedmaps recruiters. These individuals are attempting to use our company name to solicit payment from prospective candidates interested in applying for jobs at our company. Our team is actively working to combat these attempts, but in the meantime, please be mindful of the following: Our recruiters will always communicate with candidates through an @weedmaps.com email address. CORRECT: [email protected] INCORRECT: [email protected] Our recruiters will NEVER ask for or attempt to solicit payment from applicants in order to apply, interview, or work for Weedmaps. If you are interested in a role at Weedmaps, please apply through our established channels or contact our team: [email protected]\n\nCannabis\n\nLos Angeles, California, USA\n\n65 Employees\n\nThe best dispensary in LA these days has a wide selection of products and provides a wide range of consumption techniques to find the right fit for you. A selection of goods to pick from benefits the dispensary and the customer since many individuals are not satisfied with simply smoking a joint. There are not many professions with a more intriguing and distinctive title than \"budtender,\" but the term is nothing without the expertise to back it up. Most customers at a dispensary are curious and have varying degrees of marijuana expertise. The employees must be well informed on all aspects of the business, including the many strains available, the effects they produce, and the distinctions among edibles, flowers, oils, and other forms of cannabis. If you have never bought marijuana before, you probably have no idea what the going rate is for different kinds."
