She returns to SI Swimsuit for her second year after making her appearance in the magazine as a rookie in 2021.\n\nYumi, the niece of DJ Steve Aoki and Dim Mak record label owner Devon Aoki, joins Kim Kardashian, Maye Musk, and musician Ciara on the cover and so we consider this the best time to also tell you about her parents.\n\nWho Are Yumi Nu Parents?\n\nYumi Nuâs parents are Brent Nu (dad) and Kana Grace (mom) who met each other in Manhattan, New York. Together, these folks made sure they give their daughters a very grounded upbringing that nurtured creativity and open conversation.\n\nKeep reading and get to know these folks even better.\n\nMeet Yumi Nu Mom, Kana Grace\n\nYumi Nuâs mom is one of the daughters of Benihana founder Hiroaki âRockyâ Aoki and she inherited a portion of his whopping $50 million inheritance when he passed away in 2008.\n\nFeeling the racing strain, Kana and her husband moved their family to Newport, California, where Kana had grown up and her mum still lived.\n\nTalking to Teen Vogue recently, Yumi described how her mom had gone into survival mode and kind of raised them in a white-washed way. But things changed once they were at their grandmotherâs. That is when they started to know about their Asian heritage, their culture. You could find this grandma, named Chizuru, on Instagram @mamaaoki as she entertained her 18.3K followers.\n\nKana Grace Age\n\nBorn sometime in September 1966, Kana Grace reached the age of 55 in 2021.\n\nWhat Is Kana Graceâs Nationality?\n\nKana Grace is a Japanese. Addressing this, her daughter Yumi once opened up on social media that she struggled to connect with her Japanese half as she grew up in predominantly white areas. Be that as it may, she said, she anyway grew up to love and respect both sides of her ethnic composition. She puts in the effort to understand the culture of both. And she was also in the process of learning the Japanese language.\n\nYumi, so you know, is an American and her ethnicity is Japanese and Dutch. She said her Japanese heritage is a big factor in the work she chooses to do.\n\nFor years, she had been wanting to be on the cover of Japanese Vogue and the dream did come true in 2022âs spring.

For their birthdays, Brent would arrange elaborate scavenger hunts, placing pictures of animals onto construction paper with messages and clues. âHe gave us so much space to growâ, Natalie said.\n\nThe Nu patriarch meanwhile was raised by his mom Bonnie Nootenboom of Delaware, New Jersey, most likely with as much love.\n\nBrent Nu Age\n\nBrent Nu, full name Brent Nootenboom, reached the age of 52 in January 2021.\n\nWhat Is Brent Nu Nationality?\n\nYumiâs dad is a Dutch who on Facebook mentions East Stroudsburg in Pennsylvania as his hometown.\n\nBrent Nu Job\n\nBrent Nu seemingly worked in a garage shop of his own.
