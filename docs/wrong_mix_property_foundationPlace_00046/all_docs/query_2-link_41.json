        "text": "People often use the words âcannabisâ and âmarijuanaâ interchangeably, but they donât mean exactly the same thing.\n\nThe word âcannabisâ refers to all products derived from the plant Cannabis sativa.\n\nThe cannabis plant contains about 540 chemical substances.\n\nThe word âmarijuanaâ refers to parts of or products from the plant Cannabis sativa that contain substantial amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC is the substance thatâs primarily responsible for the effects of marijuana on a personâs mental state. Some cannabis plants contain very little THC. Under U.S. law, these plants are considered âindustrial hempâ rather than marijuana.\n\nThroughout the rest of this fact sheet, we use the term âcannabisâ to refer to the plant Cannabis sativa.\n\nDrugs containing cannabinoids may be helpful in treating certain rare forms of epilepsy, nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy, and loss of appetite and weight loss associated with HIV/AIDS. In addition, some evidence suggests modest benefits of cannabis or cannabinoids for chronic pain and multiple sclerosis symptoms. Cannabis isnât helpful for glaucoma. Research on cannabis or cannabinoids for other conditions is in its early stages.\n\nThe following sections summarize the research on cannabis or cannabinoids for specific health conditions.\n\nUnlike Epidiolex (the purified CBD product sold as an FDA-approved prescription drug), over-the-counter CBD products may contain more or less CBD than stated on their labels, and because of less rigorous regulatory oversight than prescription drugs, they may also contain contaminants, such as THC.\n\nCBD may have side effects, including decreases in alertness, changes in mood, decreased appetite, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea. CBD may also produce psychotic effects or cognitive impairment in people who also regularly use THC. In addition, CBD use has been associated with liver injury, male reproductive harm, and interactions with other drugs. Some side effects, such as diarrhea, sleepiness, abnormalities on tests of liver function, and drug interactions, appear to be due to CBD itself rather than contaminants in CBD products; these effects were observed in some of the people who participated in studies of Epidiolex before its approval as a drug.\n\nSeveral NCCIH-funded studies are investigating the potential pain-relieving properties and mechanisms of action of substances in cannabis, including minor cannabinoids (those other than THC) and terpenes (substances in cannabis that give the plant its strain-specific properties such as aroma and taste). The goal of these studies is to strengthen the evidence regarding cannabis components and whether they have potential roles in pain management.\n\nNCCIH is also supporting other studies on cannabis and cannabinoids, including:\n\nAn observational study of the effects of edible cannabis and its constituents on pain, inflammation, and thinking in people with chronic low-back pain.\n\nStudies to develop techniques to synthesize cannabinoids in yeast (which would cost less than obtaining them from the cannabis plant).\n\nResearch to evaluate the relationship between cannabis smoking and type 2 diabetes."
