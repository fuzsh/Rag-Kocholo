        "text": "The motion directed the Los Angeles City/County Native American Indian Commission (LANAIC), the Executive Director of Racial Equity, and other relevant County departments to work in collaboration with local Tribes to explore and examine the historical record and relationship between the County and California Native Americans, including the County’s policies, procedures, and practices that may have harmed California Native Americans and to develop a public statement that acknowledges, corrects, and disseminates the true historical record of the County and its respective departments including testimony from local tribal governments and impacted communities and with respectful collaboration and consultation with California Native Tribes.\n\nOver a nine-month period in 2022, the LANAIC, in partnership with the Chief Sustainability Office and the Department of Arts and Culture, met with designated representatives from five local Tribes. A culminating report entitled “We Are Still Here,” A Report on Past, Present, and Ongoing Harms Against Local Tribes includes an accounting of the history of the First Peoples of the region. The report reflects the thoughts, wishes, needs, and recommendations of representatives from the Fernandeño Tataviam Band of Mission Indians, Gabrieleno/Tongva San Gabriel Band of Mission Indians, Gabrielino Tongva Indians of California Tribal Council, San Fernando Band of Mission Indians, and San Manuel Band of Mission Indians. The report was submitted on February 16, 2023 to the Board of Supervisors.\n\nA Land Acknowledgment is a statement that recognizes an area’s original inhabitants who have been forcibly dispossessed of their homelands and is a step toward recognizing the negative impacts these communities have endured and continue to endure, as a result. It honors the First Peoples and recognizes the connection with the land, their continued reciprocal stewardship of the lands and waters, and their ongoing work to preserve and protect the land.\n\nAcknowledgment is a first step toward correcting the misinformation and harmful practices that erase the history and culture of the First Peoples. When done properly, a formal land acknowledgment can be an opening to greater public consciousness of Native American sovereignty and a move toward creating equitable relationships and beginning reconciliation with the First Peoples.\n\nIn recent years, the County has been active in both uplifting the histories of what is now known as Los Angeles County and prioritizing equity for communities countywide. The County is also committed to actively engaging in repairing relationships and restorative collaboration with Native communities.\n\nThe Countywide Land Acknowledgment, which was adopted by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors (Board) in November 2022, is intended to center the First Peoples by highlighting their strength, resilience, and continued contribution to the greater Los Angeles County community. It makes clear that the First Peoples are still here, and they have not left their ancestral lands.\n\nRepresentatives from local Tribes also shared their hope that the Countywide Land Acknowledgment could positively impact outcomes by keeping local Tribes and the American Indian and Alaska Native community at the forefront during County decision-making processes.\n\nOn June 23, 2020, Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda L. Solis introduced a motion, co-authored by former Supervisor Sheila Kuehl, to adopt the Countywide Cultural Policy, which was unanimously adopted by the Board. The Cultural Policy calls for the County to “identify ways to acknowledge Indigenous Peoples as traditional stewards of this land at County public events and ceremonial functions and celebrate the contributions of culture bearers and traditional arts practices of diverse communities.” Beginning in October 2021, the County, through the Los Angeles City/County Native American Indian Commission (LANAIC) and the Los Angeles County Department of Arts and Culture (Arts and Culture), embarked on a process to gather input to its understanding of the history of the region’s First Peoples and the harms that have been perpetuated and to gather input on the development of a formal land acknowledgment for the County.\n\nFrom November 2021 to June 2022, Arts and Culture, the LANAIC, and its consultant team conducted extensive outreach to 22 California Native American Tribes (Tribes), with generally five tribal affiliations, that have ties to the Los Angeles County region, as identified by the State of California Native American Heritage Commission.\n\nThe following Tribes appointed a representative to participate on a working group to contribute recommendations, guidance, and historic and cultural information that would inform the development of a formal land acknowledgment for the County:\n\nFernandeño Tataviam Band of Mission Indians\n\nGabrielino Tongva Indians of California Tribal Council\n\nGabrieleno/Tongva San Gabriel Band of Mission Indians\n\nSan Manuel Band of Mission Indians\n\nSan Fernando Band of Mission Indians\n\nOne Tribe – the Gabrieleño Band of Mission Indians – Kizh Nation (Kizh) – contacted the LANAIC and requested a separate process. The Kizh were provided an opportunity to review the draft Countywide Land Acknowledgment ahead of the Board motion to adopt it.\n\nThe Countywide Land Acknowledgment should be verbally delivered by the highest-ranking staff member of the host Department, agency, or organization, or an elected County official who will be giving opening remarks.\n\nIts delivery should not be pre-recorded. Delivery should be prepared through a reflective and intentional process to understand past and ongoing harms, as well as to learn about the First Peoples in the present day. Delivering the Countywide Land Acknowledgment should be motivated by genuine respect and support for local Tribes and American Indian and Alaska Native people. The land acknowledgment provides the opportunity for the speaker to do their own research and to take something from the statement that teaches them how to be a better visitor on the land."
