        "text": "Japanese language written in Latin script\n\n\"Japanese transliteration\" redirects here. For transliteration into Japanese, see Transcription into Japanese.\n\nThe romanization of Japanese is the use of Latin script to write the Japanese language.[1] This method of writing is sometimes referred to in Japanese as rōmaji (ローマ字, lit.'Roman letters', [ɾoːma(d)ʑi] ⓘ or [ɾoːmaꜜ(d)ʑi]).\n\nJapanese is normally written in a combination of logographic characters borrowed from Chinese (kanji) and syllabic scripts (kana) that also ultimately derive from Chinese characters.\n\nThere are several different romanization systems. The three main ones are Hepburn romanization, Kunrei-shiki romanization (ISO 3602) and Nihon-shiki romanization (ISO 3602 Strict). Variants of the Hepburn system are the most widely used.\n\nRomanized Japanese may be used in any context where Japanese text is targeted at non-Japanese speakers who cannot read kanji or kana, such as for names on street signs and passports and in dictionaries and textbooks for foreign learners of the language. It is also used to transliterate Japanese terms in text written in English (or other languages that use the Latin script) on topics related to Japan, such as linguistics, literature, history, and culture.\n\nAll Japanese who have attended elementary school since World War II have been taught to read and write romanized Japanese. Therefore, almost all Japanese can read and write Japanese by using rōmaji. However, it is extremely rare in Japan to use it to write Japanese (except as an input tool on a computer or for special purposes like in some logo design), and most Japanese are more comfortable in reading kanji and kana.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe earliest Japanese romanization system was based on Portuguese orthography. It was developed around 1548 by a Japanese Catholic named Anjirō.[2][citation needed] Jesuit priests used the system in a series of printed Catholic books so that missionaries could preach and teach their converts without learning to read Japanese orthography. The most useful of these books for the study of early modern Japanese pronunciation and early attempts at romanization was the Nippo jisho, a Japanese–Portuguese dictionary written in 1603. In general, the early Portuguese system was similar to Nihon-shiki in its treatment of vowels. Some consonants were transliterated differently: for instance, the /k/ consonant was rendered, depending on context, as either c or q, and the /ɸ/ consonant (now pronounced /h/, except before u) as f; and so Nihon no kotoba (\"The language of Japan\") was spelled Nifon no cotoba. The Jesuits also printed some secular books in romanized Japanese, including the first printed edition of the Japanese classic The Tale of the Heike, romanized as Feiqe no monogatari, and a collection of Aesop's Fables (romanized as Esopo no fabulas). The latter continued to be printed and read after the suppression of Christianity in Japan (Chibbett, 1977).\n\nFrom the mid-19th century onward, several systems were developed, culminating in the Hepburn system, named after James Curtis Hepburn who used it in the third edition of his Japanese–English dictionary, published in 1887. The Hepburn system included representation of some sounds that have since changed. For example, Lafcadio Hearn's book Kwaidan shows the older kw- pronunciation; in modern Hepburn romanization, this would be written Kaidan (lit. 'ghost tales').[citation needed]\n\nAs a replacement for the Japanese writing system\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the Meiji era (1868–1912), some Japanese scholars advocated abolishing the Japanese writing system entirely and using rōmaji instead. The Nihon-shiki romanization was an outgrowth of that movement. Several Japanese texts were published entirely in rōmaji during this period, but it failed to catch on. Later, in the early 20th century, some scholars devised syllabary systems with characters derived from Latin (rather like the Cherokee syllabary) that were even less popular since they were not based on any historical use of the Latin script.\n\nToday, the use of Nihon-shiki for writing Japanese is advocated by the Oomoto sect[3] and some independent organizations.[4] During the Allied occupation of Japan, the government of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) made it official policy to romanize Japanese. However, that policy failed and a more moderate attempt at Japanese script reform followed.\n\nModern systems\n\n[edit]\n\nHepburn\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Hepburn romanization\n\nHepburn romanization generally follows English phonology with Romance vowels. It is an intuitive method of showing Anglophones the pronunciation of a word in Japanese. It was standardized in the United States as American National Standard System for the Romanization of Japanese (Modified Hepburn), but that status was abolished on October 6, 1994. Hepburn is the most common romanization system in use today, especially in the English-speaking world.\n\nThe Revised Hepburn system of romanization uses a macron to indicate some long vowels and an apostrophe to note the separation of easily confused phonemes (usually, syllabic n ん from a following naked vowel or semivowel). For example, the name じゅんいちろう is written with the kana characters ju-n-i-chi-ro-u, and romanized as Jun'ichirō in Revised Hepburn. Without the apostrophe, it would not be possible to distinguish this correct reading from the incorrect ju-ni-chi-ro-u (じゅにちろう). This system is widely used in Japan and among foreign students and academics.\n\nNihon-shiki\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Nihon-shiki romanization\n\nNihon-shiki romanization was originally invented as a method for Japanese to write their own language in Latin characters, rather than to transcribe it for Westerners as Hepburn was. It follows the Japanese syllabary very strictly, with no adjustments for changes in pronunciation. It has also been standardized as ISO 3602 Strict. Also known as Nippon-shiki, rendered in the Nihon-shiki style of romanization the name is either Nihon-siki or Nippon-siki.\n\nKunrei-shiki\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Kunrei-shiki romanization\n\nKunrei-shiki romanization is a slightly modified version of Nihon-shiki which eliminates differences between the kana syllabary and modern pronunciation. For example, the characters づ and ず are pronounced identically in modern Japanese, and thus Kunrei-shiki and Hepburn ignore the difference in kana and represent the sound in the same way (zu). Nihon-shiki, on the other hand, will romanize づ as du, but ず as zu. Similarly for the pair じ and ぢ, they are both zi in Kunrei-shiki and ji in Hepburn, but are zi and di respectively in Nihon-shiki. See the table below for full details.\n\nKunrei-shiki has been standardized by the Japanese Government and the International Organization for Standardization as ISO 3602. Kunrei-shiki is taught to Japanese elementary school students in their fourth year of education.\n\nWritten in Kunrei-shiki, the name of the system would be rendered Kunreisiki.\n\nOther variants\n\n[edit]\n\nIt is possible to elaborate these romanizations to enable non-native speakers to pronounce Japanese words more correctly. Typical additions include tone marks to note the Japanese pitch accent and diacritic marks to distinguish phonological changes, such as the assimilation of the moraic nasal /ɴ/ (see Japanese phonology).\n\nJSL\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: JSL romanization\n\nJSL is a romanization system based on Japanese phonology, designed using the linguistic principles used by linguists in designing writing systems for languages that do not have any. It is a purely phonemic system, using exactly one symbol for each phoneme, and marking the pitch accent using diacritics. It was created for Eleanor Harz Jorden's system of Japanese language teaching. Its principle is that such a system enables students to internalize the phonology of Japanese better. Since it does not have any of the other systems' advantages for non-native speakers, and the Japanese already have a writing system for their language, JSL is not widely used outside the educational environment.\n\nNon-standard romanization\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition to the standardized systems above, there are many variations in romanization, used either for simplification, in error or confusion between different systems, or for deliberate stylistic reasons.\n\nNotably, the various mappings that Japanese input methods use to convert keystrokes on a Roman keyboard to kana often combine features of all of the systems; when used as plain text rather than being converted, these are usually known as wāpuro rōmaji. (Wāpuro is a blend of wādo purosessā word processor.) Unlike the standard systems, wāpuro rōmaji requires no characters from outside the ASCII character set.\n\nWhile there may be arguments in favour of some of these variant romanizations in specific contexts, their use, especially if mixed, leads to confusion when romanized Japanese words are indexed. This confusion never occurs when inputting Japanese characters with a word processor, because input Latin letters are transliterated into Japanese kana as soon as the IME processes what character is input.\n\nLong vowels\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition, the following three \"non-Hepburn rōmaji\" (非ヘボン式ローマ字, hi-Hebon-shiki rōmaji) methods of representing long vowels are authorized by the Japanese Foreign Ministry for use in passports.[5]\n\noh for おお or おう (Hepburn ō).\n\noo for おお or おう. This is valid JSL romanization. For Hepburn romanization, it is not a valid romanization if the long vowel belongs within a single word.\n\nou for おう. This is also an example of wāpuro rōmaji.\n\nExample words written in each romanization system\n\n[edit]\n\nEnglish Japanese Kana spelling Romanization Revised Hepburn Kunrei-shiki Nihon-shiki Roman characters ローマ字 ローマじ rōmaji rômazi rômazi Mount Fuji 富士山 ふじさん Fujisan Huzisan Huzisan tea お茶 おちゃ ocha otya otya governor 知事 ちじ chiji tizi tizi to shrink 縮む ちぢむ chijimu tizimu tidimu to continue 続く つづく tsuzuku tuzuku tuduku\n\nDifferences among romanizations\n\n[edit]\n\nThis chart shows in full the three main systems for the romanization of Japanese: Hepburn, Nihon-shiki and Kunrei-shiki:\n\nHiragana Katakana Hepburn Nihon-shiki Kunrei-shiki IPA あ ア a い イ i う ウ u ɯ え エ e お オ o か カ ka き キ ki kʲi く ク ku kɯ け ケ ke こ コ ko きゃ キャ kya kʲa きゅ キュ kyu kʲɯ きょ キョ kyo kʲo さ サ sa し シ shi si ɕi す ス su sɯ せ セ se そ ソ so しゃ シャ sha sya ɕa しゅ シュ shu syu ɕɯ しょ ショ sho syo ɕo た タ ta ち チ chi ti tɕi つ ツ tsu tu tsɯ て テ te と ト to ちゃ チャ cha tya tɕa ちゅ チュ chu tyu tɕɯ ちょ チョ cho tyo tɕo な ナ na に ニ ni ɲi ぬ ヌ nu nɯ ね ネ ne の ノ no にゃ ニャ nya ɲa にゅ ニュ nyu ɲɯ にょ ニョ nyo ɲo は ハ ha ひ ヒ hi çi ふ フ fu hu ɸɯ へ ヘ he ほ ホ ho ひゃ ヒャ hya ça ひゅ ヒュ hyu çɯ ひょ ヒョ hyo ço ま マ ma み ミ mi mʲi む ム mu mɯ め メ me も モ mo みゃ ミャ mya mʲa みゅ ミュ myu mʲɯ みょ ミョ myo mʲo や ヤ ya ja ゆ ユ yu jɯ よ ヨ yo jo ら ラ ra ɾa り リ ri ɾʲi る ル ru ɾɯ れ レ re ɾe ろ ロ ro ɾo りゃ リャ rya ɾʲa りゅ リュ ryu ɾʲu りょ リョ ryo ɾʲo わ ワ wa wa~ɰa ゐ ヰ i wi i ゑ ヱ e we e を ヲ o wo o ゐゃ ヰャ iya wya iya ゐゅ ヰュ iyu wyu iyu ゐょ ヰョ iyo wyo iyo ん ン n-n'(-m) n-n' m~n~ŋ~ɴ が ガ ga ぎ ギ gi gʲi ぐ グ gu gɯ げ ゲ ge ご ゴ go ぎゃ ギャ gya gʲa ぎゅ ギュ gyu gʲɯ ぎょ ギョ gyo gʲo ざ ザ za za~dza じ ジ ji zi ʑi~dʑi ず ズ zu zɯ~dzɯ ぜ ゼ ze ze~dze ぞ ゾ zo zo~dzo じゃ ジャ ja zya ʑa~dʑa じゅ ジュ ju zyu ʑɯ~dʑɯ じょ ジョ jo zyo ʑo~dʑo だ ダ da ぢ ヂ ji di zi ʑi~dʑi づ ヅ zu du zu zɯ~dzɯ で デ de ど ド do ぢゃ ヂャ ja dya zya ʑa~dʑa ぢゅ ヂュ ju dyu zyu ʑɯ~dʑɯ ぢょ ヂョ jo dyo zyo ʑo~dʑo ば バ ba び ビ bi bʲi ぶ ブ bu bɯ べ ベ be ぼ ボ bo びゃ ビャ bya bʲa びゅ ビュ byu bʲɯ びょ ビョ byo bʲo ぱ パ pa ぴ ピ pi pʲi ぷ プ pu pɯ ぺ ペ pe ぽ ポ po ぴゃ ピャ pya pʲa ぴゅ ピュ pyu pʲɯ ぴょ ピョ pyo pʲo ゔ ヴ vu βɯ\n\nThis chart shows the significant differences among them. Despite the International Phonetic Alphabet, the /j/ sound in や, ゆ, and よ are never romanized with the letter J.\n\nKana Revised Hepburn Nihon-shiki Kunrei-shiki うう ū û おう, おお ō ô し shi si しゃ sha sya しゅ shu syu しょ sho syo じ ji zi じゃ ja zya じゅ ju zyu じょ jo zyo ち chi ti つ tsu tu ちゃ cha tya ちゅ chu tyu ちょ cho tyo ぢ ji di zi づ zu du zu ぢゃ ja dya zya ぢゅ ju dyu zyu ぢょ jo dyo zyo ふ fu hu ゐ i wi i ゑ e we e を o wo o ん n, n' ( m) n n'\n\nSpacing\n\n[edit]\n\nJapanese is written without spaces between words, and in some cases, such as compounds, it may not be completely clear where word boundaries should lie, resulting in varying romanization styles. For example, 結婚する, meaning \"to marry\", and composed of the noun 結婚 (kekkon, \"marriage\") combined with する (suru, \"to do\"), is romanized as one word kekkonsuru by some authors but two words kekkon suru by others.\n\nKana without standardized forms of romanization\n\n[edit]\n\nThere is no universally accepted style of romanization for the smaller versions of the vowels and y-row kana when used outside the normal combinations (きゃ, きょ, ファ etc.), nor for the sokuon or small tsu kana っ/ッ when it is not directly followed by a consonant. Although these are usually regarded as merely phonetic marks or diacritics, they do sometimes appear on their own, such as at the end of sentences, in exclamations, or in some names. The detached sokuon, representing a final glottal stop in exclamations, is sometimes represented as an apostrophe or as t; for example, あっ! might be written as a'! or at!.[citation needed]\n\nHistorical romanizations\n\n[edit]\n\n1603: Vocabvlario da Lingoa de Iapam (1603)\n\n1604: Arte da Lingoa de Iapam (1604–1608)\n\n1620: Arte Breve da Lingoa Iapoa (1620)\n\n1848: Kaisei zoho Bango sen[6] (1848)\n\nあ い う え お 1603 a i, j, y v, u ye vo, uo 1604 i v vo 1620 y 1848 i woe e o か き く け こ きゃ きょ くゎ 1603 ca qi, qui cu, qu qe, que co qia qio, qeo qua 1604 qui que quia quio 1620 ca, ka ki cu, ku ke kia kio 1848 ka kfoe ko が ぎ ぐ げ ご ぎゃ ぎゅ ぎょ ぐゎ 1603 ga gui gu, gv gue go guia guiu guio gua 1604 gu 1620 ga, gha ghi gu, ghu ghe go, gho ghia ghiu ghio 1848 ga gi gfoe ge go さ し す せ そ しゃ しゅ しょ 1603 sa xi su xe so xa xu xo 1604 1620 1848 si sfoe se ざ じ ず ぜ ぞ じゃ じゅ じょ 1603 za ii, ji zu ie, ye zo ia, ja iu, ju io, jo 1604 ji ia ju jo 1620 ie iu io 1848 zi zoe ze た ち つ て と ちゃ ちゅ ちょ 1603 ta chi tçu te to cha chu cho 1604 1620 1848 tsi tsoe だ ぢ づ で ど ぢゃ ぢゅ ぢょ 1603 da gi zzu de do gia giu gio 1604 dzu 1620 1848 dsi dsoe な に ぬ ね の にゃ にゅ にょ 1603 na ni nu ne no nha nhu, niu nho, neo 1604 nha nhu nho 1620 1848 noe は ひ ふ へ ほ ひゃ ひゅ ひょ 1603 fa fi fu fe fo fia fiu fio, feo 1604 fio 1620 1848 ha hi foe he ho ば び ぶ べ ぼ びゃ びゅ びょ 1603 ba bi bu be bo bia biu bio, beo 1604 1620 bia biu 1848 boe ぱ ぴ ぷ ぺ ぽ ぴゃ ぴゅ ぴょ 1603 pa pi pu pe po pia pio 1604 1620 pia 1848 poe ま み む め も みゃ みょ 1603 ma mi mu me mo mia, mea mio, meo 1604 1620 mio 1848 moe や ゆ よ 1603 ya yu yo 1604 1620 ら り る れ ろ りゃ りゅ りょ 1603 ra ri ru re ro ria, rea riu rio, reo 1604 rio 1620 riu 1848 roe わ ゐ ゑ を 1603 va, ua vo, uo 1604 va y ye vo 1620 1848 wa wi ije, ÿe wo ん 1603 n, m, ˜ (tilde) 1604 n 1620 n, m っ 1603 -t, -cc-, -cch-, -cq-, -dd-, -pp-, -ss-, -tt, -xx-, -zz- 1604 -t, -cc-, -cch-, -pp-, -cq-, -ss-, -tt-, -xx- 1620 -t, -cc-, -cch-, -pp-, -ck-, -cq-, -ss-, -tt-, -xx-\n\nRoman letter names in Japanese\n\n[edit]\n\nThe list below shows the Japanese readings of letters in Katakana, for spelling out words, or in acronyms.
