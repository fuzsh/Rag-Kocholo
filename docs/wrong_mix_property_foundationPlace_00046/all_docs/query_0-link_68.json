I‚Äôve learned that you make me laugh with the easy comfort of a long-lost friend. I‚Äôve learned that you‚Äôre a strong and independent woman, and your strength gives me joy. I‚Äôve learned that you make me a better person, a better man, because of your sensitivity and your soft voice. And so Theresa, I know I found a full partner to share all of life‚Äôs experiences that are thrown at us.‚Äù\n\nCongratulations to the happy couple!"
