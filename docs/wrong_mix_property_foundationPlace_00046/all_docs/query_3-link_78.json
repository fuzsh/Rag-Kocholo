        "text": "David Bronner, CEO and president of the soap company that bears his surname, has partnered with Flow Kana to launch Brother David’s – a non-profit cannabis company that will dedicate its profits to charity. Bronner, a noted organic farming advocate, said his soap company, Dr. Bronner’s, has dedicated more than $5 million to the legalization movement since 2001.\n\nAll of Brother David’s sun-grown products will be sourced from cultivators that have received Sun + Earth certification, which is given to farms using ethical and ecological best practices.\n\n“Brother David’s provides an alternative to the chemical and fossil-fuel intensive industrial ag model being adopted by many corporations in the cannabis industry. As society moves closer and closer toward the federal legalization of cannabis, we need to chart a new course before it’s too late. We need to promote Sun + Earth and other high bar standards – because it’s best for the Earth in this age of climate crisis, and produces the cleanest, greenest and most ethical cannabis possible.” – David Bronner, in a statement.\n\nIn 2012, Bronner was arrested for cultivating hemp in front of the White House in protest of federal laws. He was also arrested in 2009 for digging up the lawn of the Drug Enforcement Agency in Washington, D.C. to plant hemp seeds.\n\nFlow Kana has set up a California supply chain of more than 200 independent farms. Michael Steinmetz, Flow Kana CEO, said the partnership will help fight to preserve the cannabis industry “from the ways of industrial agriculture.”\n\n“This movement is not only about saving these environmental and community values, but making this decentralized model of agriculture the gold standard for others to follow across the cannabis industry and beyond,” he said in a release. “This fight requires everyone’s involvement and careful collaboration across many operators, distributors, retailers, and brands working in tandem to preserve, protect, and evolve our industry and world.”\n\nBrother David products will be available May 7 at select dispensaries in San Francisco, Berkeley and will roll out in Southern California later in the month.\n\nGet daily cannabis business news updates.
