        "text": "Senator Cynthia Villar expressed surprise on Wednesday regarding the House of Representatives’ approval of a bill legalizing divorce in the Philippines. She emphasized her opposition to the measure, aligning herself with several other senators against the bill.\n\n“Of course, I was surprised by their decision,” said Villar, who is married to tycoon Manny Villar. “But as everyone knows, I have a very happy family life, so I’m not in favor of divorce.”\n\nVillar joins Senate President Francis Escudero, Senate President Pro Tempore Jinggoy Estrada, Senator Joel Villanueva, and Senate Minority Leader Koko Pimentel in their opposition to the divorce bill.\n\nSenator Juan Miguel Zubiri also voiced his stance against the bill, citing his pro-family values. “I am a conservative legislator. If I were in America, I would be a Republican, so I am pro-family,” Zubiri told reporters. “I frown on any bills that will separate our families. We don’t want to end up like in Las Vegas, where people marry on a whim and then divorce the next month. That’s not right. We should study this to ensure we don’t become like other countries with very dysfunctional families.”\n\nZubiri believes the divorce bill will be a matter of conscience voting in the Senate.\n\nSenators Sonny Angara and Bong Revilla mentioned they are still studying the controversial measure. Currently, seven senators support the bill, six oppose it, and two are undecided.\n\nSenator Grace Poe expressed conditional support for the bill, stating she would propose amendments to certain provisions. Similarly, Senator JV Ejercito indicated he is leaning towards supporting the bill.\n\nThe Senate’s version of the proposed divorce law, principally authored by Senators Risa Hontiveros, Raffy Tulfo, Robinhood Padilla, Pia Cayetano, and Imee Marcos, is currently pending on its second reading before the Senate Plenary."
