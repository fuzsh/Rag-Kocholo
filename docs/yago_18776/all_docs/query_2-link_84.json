        "text": "“WE do not build our happiness on the unhappiness of others.”\n\nThus Senator Cynthia Villar declared at the Bulong Pulungan, media forum at the Hotel Sofitel last Tuesday, October 3, 2017.\n\nSenator Villar expressed her sentiments in response to allegations that she and six other senators refused to sign Senate Resolution 516.\n\nThe resolution called for the government to stop drug-related killings particularly involving minors.\n\nOutrage on Social Media and the Senate\n\nEarlier, a blog on social media asked “fellow Filipinos” to “remember the senators… ask for an explanation why they did not sign the resolution… and give them your outrage.”\n\nAside from Villar, the other senators were Koko Pimentel, Tito Sotto, Dick Gordon, Miguel Zubiri, Gregorio Honasan, and Manny Pacquiao.\n\nIn various press conferences or privilege speeches in the Senate, the senators expressed their dismay, clarifying that they were not asked to sign the resolution.\n\nThe senators then filed their own resolution — Senate Resolution 518– which called on the government to stop extrajudicial killings.\n\nSenator Villar lamented that she and her co-senators were not asked to sign the resolution, but that word spread that the senators refused to sign.\n\nShe said she would have signed the resolution. “I will sign it anytime,” she added.\n\n“It’s okay that we were not asked to sign,” she said. “But when you use the resolution to say bad things to your colleagues, that’s a different story.”\n\nShe said if she and the other six senators had done the same to their critics, they would feel hurt, too. She pointed out senators should not destroy each other: “We are always together, every day. Hindi maganda iyon. (That’s not nice).”\n\nShe repeated, “You know, our principle is we do not build our happiness on the unhappiness of others.”\n\nWhat Makes Cynthia Villar Happy\n\nThe 516 Resolution issue thus behind her, Senator Villar preferred to discuss what makes her happy– the interrelated, sustainable programs of her Committee on Agriculture and Food and Committee on Environment and Natural Resources.\n\nThe Senator’s programs include:\n\nSaving Manila Bay from environmental menace, including preserving the wetlands by building a Wetlands Park by the Bay, and providing toilets and other amenities for the informal settlers living in house on stilts at Barangay Baseco;\n\nEstablishing farm schools in every Philippine town to encourage the youth to go into farming, and thereby assure that agriculture will continue in the country;\n\nExtending the scope of responsibility of the Philippine Rice Institute from mere research to bringing the seeds it has researched on at the farm level.\n\nRevising the Coco Levy Fund bill to make two budgets: one for the farmers– scholarships for children, livelihood, health benefits, or processing equipment; and another for the Philippine Coconut Authority to be able to fulfill the responsibility of government to the coconut industry such as planting, replanting, fertilization, and creating processing centers.\n\nFrom the transcript of the Bulong Pulungan forum with Senator Villar, here are excerpts, edited for clarity, including translations, in service of this blog’s readers worldwide…\n\nOn Agriculture and Environment\n\nMy committees in the Senate are the Committee on Agriculture and Food and Committee on Environment and Natural Resources. I think they are interrelated… I like them. I believe that sustainable agriculture is sustainable environment.\n\n…Especially in the advent of natural farming… if we take care of the environment… that will make our agriculture sustainable, especially that according to statistics, 38 percent of our lands in the Philippines is degraded.\n\nWe asked the UN FAO (United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization) how do you solve degradation of the soil and they said compost all your waste and bring them back to the soil. This is a relationship between environmental practices and sustainable agriculture.\n\nRight now, according to study, the main problem is the presence of plastic in our ocean. According to a study made by the University of Georgia, the biggest contributor of plastic into the ocean would be China, next is Indonesia, and the third is the Philippines.\n\nSo, if we allow our plastic to go into the ocean, then if the fishes eat them, they die. In a way, by throwing your plastic into the ocean, you are destroying our fishes. That is also a relationship between environmental practices and sustainable agriculture. So, they are interrelated.\n\nI remember I visited France and I went to a natural farm. They said they are promoting natural farming in France because they found out that the amount of money they earn from the export of agricultural products will just be enough to rehabilitate the waterways destroyed by chemical fertilizer and chemical pesticide.\n\nWhy will you (still) plant if your earnings from agriculture will only be enough to cure environmental degradation that it is causing? So, they said they want to promote natural farming so that this will not happen even if their production will decrease. They said they noticed that for those who are using a lot of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, the farmers developed cancer.…When I came back to the Philippines and I was a speaker of the association of nurses, Philippine Nurses Association, the president (who) came from the Cordillera, told me without me telling her about the comment of the French, sabi niya alam n’yo ho ba ang daming nagkaka-cancer ngayon sa Cordillera dahil sa paggamit ng pesticide at chemical fertilizer. (There are many who suffer cancer in the Cordillera because they are using pesticides and chemical fertilizers).\n\nSo, there is interrelationship that we can see between the environment and agriculture. I felt that taking care of the environment is the key towards sustainable agriculture. So, I am very happy with my two committees.\n\nOn Farm Schools\n\nMy farm is a farm school. I have two farm schools: one at the boundary of Las Pinas and Bacoor for Southern Luzon and NCR (National Capital Region); and one in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan, for Regions 3, 1, 2 and CAR (Region IV-A which includes Cavite, Laguna, Rizal, and Quezon).\n\nThe students from these northern regions come to my farm in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan.\n\nThe farm school started with a knowledge. There was a study by the Philippine Institute of Development Studies that the barriers (against) farmers not earning are four: lack of technology; lack of mechanization; lack of financial literacy; and inability to access cheap credit.\n\nSo, I thought that these barriers can be learned in the farm school. That’s when I encouraged farm owners with a minimum of one hectare– because that’s the requirement of TESDA (Technical Education and Skills Development Authority) to teach (farming basics). The (farm owners) accredit themselves with TESDA because TESDA will pay for the tuition of the students who will come to their farm school to learn.\n\nI think a farm school in every town in the Philippine should be ideal because the average age of farmers in the Philippines is 57. So, if we are not able to encourage the young people to continue the farms of their parents, then, as UN FAO says, we will have food shortage 33 years from now or in 2050.\n\nSo, we should encourage the building of farm schools. It came with a legislation on the Farm Tourism bill. Under the bill, you turn your farm into a tourist farm and at the same time a learning center– so that is the farm school. That would be a good model for people so that they will earn from their farms. The farm becomes a tourist farm catering to tourists and at the same a farm school where they will earn money from teaching.\n\nBecause a teacher can teach 25 students. TESDA will pay them P12,000 for a three-month course. One will be earning something like P300,000 a month per quarter for 25 students so the teacher will be earning P100,000 a month. Not bad isn’t it, for a part-time work of teaching 25 students.The farm owners, they like it. Last year we made a directory. We have 382 farm schools. Now we have 920…My dream is 1 for every town which is 1,600, but 920 is not so bad. It’s a farm school for every two towns in the Philippines so it’s accessible. I am so glad that TESDA is so happy.\n\nOn talks that her husband, Manny Villar, is planning to run for mayor of Manila\n\nManny was really born in Manila in Tondo. The house they rented in Tondo happened to be owned by the wife of a Sandiganbayan justice who was our friend. The wife died and the family wanted to divide the properties. They forced Manny to buy. Since doon naman siya pinanganak, binili niya. (He was born there, so he bought the property.) When we bought it, it’s really a condemned building so we decided to build a three-story building. The two stories, I asked McDonald’s to rent (so we don’t need to hire a guard for the place).\n\nWe use the third story whenever we are there if we don’t have any place to go to in Tondo. So (people) thought that we are establishing residence (in Manila).\n\n… It’s not meant for us to run in Manila. Ang laki ng problema ng Manila. (It is so big, you wouldn’t want to solve the problem of Manila.\n\nOn Solving the Manila Bay Problem\n\nThe Supreme Court has a mandamus, requiring 13 government agencies to (look into the problem about Manila Bay).\n\nSince I am chairman of the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources, naturally, I decided to do Baseco (the compound of the Bataan Shipyard and Engineering Corporation, where informal settlers have built houses on stilts).\n\nManny made some films there for his political campaigns so I thought that I should be helping Baseco just to say thank you…\n\nWith the Department of Natural Resources and Environment (and other agencies) we are planting mangroves; DA-BFAR (Department of Agriculture’s Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources is building aquaculture; the Bureau of Soils and Water Management of DA is building a vegetable garden. So, the settlers already have fish and vegetables.\n\nThe settlers—about 10,000 residents– don’t have toilets. So, the (DOH) Department of Health is building toilets – because, under the Millennium Development Goals, they are aiming for zero open defecation. They said they need P2.5 billion to solve open defecation. Sabi ko, hindi mo naman kayang gawin in one year kaya every year we will build something. (We can’t afford to do this in one year, so, every year, we will build something.)\n\nI think right now they are allocating P75 million to build (toilet facilities).\n\nThe Villar Sipag at Tiyaga (Diligence and Perseverance) Foundation is building livelihood projects. We are trying to slowly cement the roads, provide environmental (safety measurements), waste management, food security, livelihood (skills training) infrastructure (development).\n\nThis is really a convergence. The DPWH (Department of Public Works and Highways) and MMDA (Metro Manila Development Authority) are helping.\n\nThe Manila Bay Sunset Partnership, Landbank of the Philippines together with DZRH, DepEd (Department of Education) for overseeing the public school, and the (DILG) Department of Interior Local Governments for managing the barangay, are also involved. Kapag ayaw nilang mag-cooperate, nire-remind ko, gusto n’yo isumbong ko kayo sa Supreme Court? (If they don’t want to cooperate, I remind them, I will report you to the Supreme Court.)\n\nOn the bird sanctuary at the Manila Bay\n\nFrom October 21 to October 28, there will be a convention– the UN Convention for the Protection of Migratory Animals here in Manila—at the Las Pinas-Paranaque Wetland Park (the only wetland park in Manila).\n\nI am building a Visitors’ Center there, courtesy of our family so that (the Convention participants) will see something when they get there. I am building toilet facilities.\n\nThere is a budget from the Department of Tourism to build a wetland museum, a training center and the office of DENR and a restaurant there. The (Manny) Pangilinan Group has committed to building the pier. Because we intend to do river cruise from Las Pinas to that area. The training center will be used to train students on environmental protection. DENR will have an extension office there so they can watch over the wetland park plus Manila Bay.\n\nThere will be a restaurant so people can go there and eat and see the place. We are finishing our Visitor’s Center by October 20.\n\nNext year, we have a budget to connect the bridge (of the Wetland Park) to Macapagal Avenue so it will be easy to go there and to come back to Macapagal Avenue. It will become an eco-tourism destination. It will be good for us because this will be the first time that we will have something like that in Metro Manila.\n\nOn the Ramsar List\n\nIt’s the responsibility of the government of the Philippines to protect (the Wetland Park).\n\nThat place has 35 hectares of mangrove forest, two lagoons, and 84 species of birds; 3 of them endangered–the black stilt, the Philippine duck, and the Chinese Egret.\n\nWe have 1,000 black stilts of the remaining 100,000 in the world. If you have 1% of the endangered species, you automatically join the Ramsar List as one of the most important wetlands in the world.\n\nThe Ramsar List is based on a treat signed during the Convention of Wetlands at the Ramsar County (in the Mazandaran Province of Iran) providing the framework for the conservation and wise use of wetlands –land areas saturated with water taking on the characteristics of a distinct ecosystem.\n\nThe treaty was signed in the 1970s and the government of the Philippines is a signatory.\n\nOn the reclamation project by the Manila Bay\n\nI think (developers) want more cruise terminals (by the Solaire Resort area) rather than reclamation. It’s okay so long as they don’t close Manila Bay—because this will cause flooding in Las Pinas, 8-meters high—about 3-storeys high.\n\nLas Pinas houses are all only 1- or 2- two stories high. And most of the owners are middle-class families paying their houses on installment arrangement with the Pag-IBIG or the Social Security System for 25 years. Can you imagine what you built for 25 years being inundated?\n\nOn the Philippine Rice Institute’s mandate\n\n(I looked up) the seed development law (and it says there) you have to bring the seeds that you have researched on at the farm level. Now they will do the extension.\n\nOn the Coco Levy Fund\n\nI want the Coco Levy Fund bill back to the Committee to make corrections. I am happy that it was not passed… because we want to make amendments.\n\nThe Coco Levy Fund is a P100-billion fund for the coconut farmers. We will pass a bill, the Coconut Industry Development Fund which will have two budgets: one for the interest of the farmers, and another one for the budget of the PCA (Philippine Coconut Authority).\n\nI would like to believe (the interest of the Fund) is for the personal benefit of the coconut farmers. And then the budget for PCA should be used for the responsibility of government to the coconut industry planting, replanting, fertilization, maybe to create processing centers. (Because if you only sell coconut), the farmer earns only P50 a day or P1,500 a month. And it takes P6,300 a month to feed a family of 5.\n\nFrom the studies, (there is a) kind of seedlings of coconut that can produce 150 nuts a year. Our seedling now is producing 40 nuts a year. So, if you use the new seedling you triple the P1,500 income to P4,500. And then when you do intercrop either coffee or cacao, you earn additional P10,000 a month. So that’s P14,500 a month. That’s the model that we want. This will be the responsibility of PCA.\n\nNow the fund for the farmers may be used for scholarships for their children, maybe livelihood, health benefits to the coconut farmers, or processing equipment—whatever they like.\n\nI don’t like either that they will have a fund manager-– baka kung saan dalhin ang pera at maubos. (They might put the money somewhere else and use it up.).\n\nToday, we have 12 million farmers. 1.5 million in fisheries; 2.5 million in livestock, poultry, and dairy; 8 million in crops– 3.5 million in rice, another 3.5 million in coconut and 1 million miscellaneous– banana, sugar, vegetables.\n\nYou can see that if you really want to make a difference, you just have to solve the problem of the coconut farmers and the rice farmers because they are the majority.\n\nIf we have a model that will make the rice farmers and coconut farmers wealthy, then we end poverty in the Philippines."
