        "text": "Cynthia Aguilar Villar, Cyn to people close to her, wears two official hats — that of a public servant as a senator, and one as managing director of the Villar Foundation, which is engaged in numerous social development and philanthropic pursuits. Cyn is also a staunch environmentalist and an advocate for women empowerment.\n\nHer success in these various roles, however, takes root from a happy and fulfilling life anchored on her being a wife to former legislator and real estate magnate Manny Villar and a mother to two successful children, Senator Mark and Las Piñas Representative Camille.\n\nDaily Tribune interviewed Senator Cyn on being her only daughter’s mom, and she graciously replied to our questions.\n\nAsked how she bonds with her daughter, she replied, “We find time to be together every Sunday with her children, as well as on special occasion, whether we dine out, visit some interesting places, or just around in each other’s homes, conversing and sharing experiences on our being homemakers as well as public servants.”\n\nCyn is one lucky mother whose children turned out well, bringing home diplomas from top international academic institutions. Not surprisingly, she considers Camille’s best gift to her the latter’s “MBA degree which she acquired at the IESE School of Business (the business school of the University of Navarra) in Barcelona, Spain.” Camille also attended the Ateneo de Manila University.\n\nThat she highly values this outstanding achievement of Camille affirms the lady senator’s belief in education. Cyn herself attended the University of the Philippines where she was an outstanding student. It was also at the state university that she met the love of her life, Manny, and together, through the proverbial thick and thin, emerged successful parents, entrepreneurs and public servants.\n\nCamille’s many accomplishments includes her taking after a mother who has earned the respect especially of Filipino women and environmentalists. The feisty, articulate lady senator praises her daughter “for being so hardworking as she helps her father in his mall and retail business, even as she likewise serves the people of Las Piñas as a Congresswoman and Deputy Speaker in the House of Representatives.”\n\nWhen we asked her what she tells her daughter about boys, Senator Cyn reminded us, “She is already married and has found happiness in her family life. Obviously, she has made the right choice and so I do not have to tell her anything about men.”\n\nStill, when it comes to living her life, she advices Camille “to work hard and manage her income properly to be able to provide for her children in the future and give them the best education she could afford.”\n\nSenator Cyn can only look back to what her own mother taught her, and which she has passed on to her own daughter, which is “to work hard and save one’s earnings for the future.”\n\nIndeed, a worthy advice from a mother who knows best to a daughter who has a great future ahead of her."
