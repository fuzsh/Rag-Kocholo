Our time schedule seems to be different that it took me almost 1 week before i can manage to meet him last September 2 .\n\nI lived in northern Metro Manila where traffic is unpredictable and our place is notorious for its monstrous traffic jam and public buses is always crowded especially on rush hour . Decided to leave at around past 5:30am just to be in Makati before the rush hour began, I also pass the MRT North Avenue station and decided not to take the ride despite the short line ( I am happily watching the MAD Max Fury Road film being aired over the air-condition bus that i took ) Route -Novaliches – Baclaran via EDSA .\n\nBuendia Avenue aka Senator Gil Puyat Avenue\n\n( notice the large poster with the clearance )\n\nI paid over Php 50 transportation fee going to Buendia ( aka Senator Gil Puyat Avenue) It is well worth it since the bus is not crowded and had a good movie to watch . I arrived a little past 7:30am at the Buendia Gasoline station near MRT Buendia . The main center island with a lot of decades-old trees like acacia, narras , mahogany will be cut-down in the not so distant future to pave way for road widening project . I hope that someone can save those premium trees There are tree experts that are around and maybe instead of just cutting those premium trees , I think they must find a space to replant those trees. Let us say in Ayala Triangle or Somewhere else ? There are a lot of public parks and spaces in Metro Manila that needed trees.\n\nCentury City Mall\n\nI leisurely took a stroll walking along Buendia and I asked a friendly Makati police who knew the street. He quickly told me the exact location and it was just a few blocks away. I walked towards Makati Avenue then pass-by Kalayaan Street , Century City Mall , A Venue Mall then Valdez street .I was greeted with a friendly smiles by the hotel receptionist and she got my ID and my purpose . She immediately called the room.\n\npostcards from Germany ( love the landmarks)\n\nWhen Mr. Jurgen Nes came, we did a few photo opportunity , swap some postcards , got a few autographs and have a little chit-chat.\n\nBerlin map with landmarks\n\nThis is one of my personal favorite , This showed the map of Berlin and its famous landmarks\n\nVielen Dank, Maraming Salamat , Thank You , Terima Kasih and Gan Xie\n\nWebsite: http://www.isabelleroyalehotel.com/\n\nLike Loading...\n\nFiled under: Uncategorized | Tagged: Advocacy, Buendia, Isabelle Royale Hotel and Suite, Makati City, Postcard, Senator Gil Puyat Avenue, Valdez Street | Leave a comment »\n\nWorld Trade Center , Senator Gil Puyat Avenue ( Buendia Street) , Pasay City – Philippines 8.)
