        "text": "An Arverne man was sentenced to 24 years in prison Tuesday, Sept. 6, for manslaughter in the fatal stabbing of his 43-year-old wife inside their home in 2020, according to Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz.\n\nManuel Villar, 42, pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the first degree in July before Queens Supreme Court Justice Michael Aloise.\n\nAccording to the charges, during the early morning of Sept. 24, 2020, Villar confronted his wife, Ivette Villar, inside their 58th Street home with accusations of infidelity at around 1:30 a.m. as their three sons and a friend of one of their sons slept in another room.\n\nAs the argument escalated, Villar grabbed a knife and then repeatedly stabbed his wife in her neck and head. With his wife left bleeding on the floor, Villar drove away from their Arverne home and called 911 hours later, admitting his deeds to the emergency services operator and providing details of his location. When police arrived to arrest Villar, a knife was discovered in his vehicle.\n\n“The defendant, who pleaded guilty, is responsible for a brutal act of domestic violence that resulted in the death of his wife and mother of his three children,” Katz said. “He will now serve a lengthy prison term imposed by the court as punishment.”\n\nJustice Aloise imposed Tuesday’s determinate sentence of 24 years in prison to be followed by five years of post-release supervision."
