        "text": "NOT JUST gwapa (beautiful). Affectionate, sweet and humble as well.\n\nShe is also a picture of a successful and contented woman – and an accomplished public servant.\n\nCamille Aguilar Villar is undeniably exuding the Ilongga vibe.\n\nThe youngest daughter of businessman and former Senate President Manuel Villar Jr. and Senator Cynthia Villar, Camille’s lolo, Manuel Montalban Villar Sr., hailed from Cabatuan, Iloilo. In 2006 she was crowned the Queen of Jaro – an affirmation not only of her beauty and grace but also of her Ilonggo heritage.\n\nFAMILY-ORIENTED\n\nIlonggos are a family-oriented people and the Villars are no different. They value family as a bedrock from whom members are raised to become better individuals through the shared values of good character and hard work.\n\nIt is thus no surprise that just like her achiever-brothers Paolo and Mark, Camille has blossomed in her chosen field of endeavor as a an entrepreneur, public servant and a wife.\n\nMark, of course, is the hardworking former secretary of the Department of Public Works and Highways who oversaw the successful “Build, Build, Build” public infrastructure program of the national government. Like Camille, he has also found his true calling – public service.\n\nIn her various undertakings, be it in business or public service, Camille takes inspiration and guidance from her parents and siblings.\n\nAccording to Camille, being able to work especially with her dad fuels her yearning to learn more and be passionate in everything she does.\n\nPUBLIC SERVANT\n\nLike her parents, Camille loves to serve the public. Her passion to serve through politics started when she was elected as representative of the Lone District of Las Piñas City. She eventually became a Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, the youngest in the country’s history.\n\nAs a public servant and first-term member of the House of Representatives in the current 18th Congress, Villar has filed 100 bills and resolutions of national importance and local application, including pushing for a bigger assistance to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), empowerment of women, and protection of children and kids with special needs, and the law on learners integration in education.\n\nShe also worked for employment generation, community livelihood programs, development of pioneering industries including green industries, safeguarding the environment, addressing hunger and malnutrition, senior citizens’ welfare and combatting the abuse and violence inflicted against women, minors and the underprivileged.\n\nPrior to being elected as Deputy Speaker in February 2021, Camille served as Deputy Majority Floor Leader and former vice chairperson of the House Committee on MSME Development and House Committee on Trade and Commerce.\n\nShe championed the passage of a law increasing the bed capacity of the Las Piñas General Hospital and Satellite Trauma Center from 200 to 500 beds. Ditto, relevant measures on retail trade, zero-waste policy via Extended Producers Responsibility; on the possibility of a national cyclists statute and a new Land Transportation Office in the city.\n\nAs an advocate of the improvement of the education sector, Camille continues to grant scholarships, provide trainings to women and out-of-school youth, give financial aid and digital and technological learning support to teachers and students, and skills and re-skills acquisition\n\nMoreover, with her desire to help Las Piñas residents develop skills and grow their income through practical applications, she constantly provides livelihood assistance and trainings through the Villar SIPAG (Social Institute for Poverty Alleviation and Governance) Foundation.\n\nDuring the pandemic, she also distributed personal protective equipment and ayuda, and ramped up the city’s health infrastructure by installing modular hospitals, isolation centers and mega vaccination hubs.\n\nShe unveiled the “May Bahay sa Bakuna” vaccine incentive program to reward vaccinated residents with grocery items, motorcycles and a brand new house-and-lot package.\n\nBUSINESSWOMAN\n\nJust like her father Manny Villar Jr. Camille’s success as an entrepreneur/businesswoman signifies her being hard-working and passionate in her work, another strong character of an Ilongga.\n\nCamille obtained her MBA from IESE (Instituto de Estudios Superiores de la Empresa) Business School in Barcelona, Spain, one of the leading business schools in the world, and studied Business Management at the Ateneo de Manila University.\n\nWith her education, Camille took a major role in managing their family business, from malls to real estate.\n\nThe city and province of Iloilo is also home to these businesses providing employment opportunities and spurring the local economy.\n\nCamille, too, is the Managing Director of Vista Land Commercial and Director of Starmalls, Inc.; Golden Bria Holdings,Inc.; and AllValue Holdings Corp."
