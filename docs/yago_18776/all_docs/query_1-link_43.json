Senator Joel Villanueva opposes divorce but supports equal access to annulment, which he says favors the rich. Divorce advocates argue that annulment's scope is limited and does not reflect reality. While most senators oppose divorce, Senate President Sotto and others may support a bill allowing dissolution of marriage if it does not use the word \"divorce\". Advocates want a process that is more affordable and truthful for separating couples.",
