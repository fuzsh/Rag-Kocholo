We Filipinos, especially the poor, are the losers for it.\n\nManny Villar is an extraordinary man, not just in his rags-to-riches climb to wealth and prominence, but in his humility and integrity of character. I have not met quite a man such as he, except for my own father. He is a God-fearing man, a wonderful husband and father, a defender of the poor and the culture of life, an honest and dedicated public servant. He is a generous man, working without fanfare to alleviate the dire situation of many poor Filipinos, whether farmers or OFWs.\n\nHe could have given a lot of hope to those who are willing to work hard through sipag at tiyaga. As a government official, he regularly secured the highest satisfaction ratings, especially as Speaker of the House and as Senate President. He has the distinction of having impeached a sitting President. Manny Villar was by and far the best candidate for President. He could have decisively transformed our nation for the better.\n\nIn this election campaign, despite the awful black propaganda of his opponents, he kept his campaign to a high moral level. He would not retaliate in kind. He silently endured the lies, unjust maligning and numerous half-truths and deception. He is like a modern-day Job. I believe God is very pleased with him.\n\nToday we face an uncertain future, with an elected President whose track record and competence remain subject to question. Today the culture of life will be deeply under threat, with a President who is pro-choice, pro-RH and pro-population control. Today we are again going to be governed by elitist and dynastic families and business interests, and the poor will suffer all the more.\n\nOh, what could have been! Our people need to grow in greater political maturity. The poor should not favor a convicted plunderer who has shown a mockery of family, life andgood governance. The priests and nuns should not favor a person because of his pedigree or due to sentimental attachment, especially at the sacrifice of the culture of life. The institutions of society, especially media, should always look to truth in its reporting.\n\nManny Villar, you did not succeed in winning the Presidency, but for me you are already a winner. May our Lord bless you in every way.\n\nYour brother in Christ,\n\nFrank Padilla\n\nThe Burning Issues\n\nFellow Filipinos, the biggest issue in the elections on May 10 is the survival of the Filipino family.\n\nMany senators and congressman have been trying to pass the Reproductive Health Education bill, a bill that will only result in big profits for foreign drug manufacturers.\n\nThese foreign companies, with the help of supportive legislators, will, through the bill, change the way we raise our children and our families.\n\nYou be the judge:\n\n1. Will you allow your children ages 10 to 17 (grade 5 to 4th year high school) to be given sex lessons in school, complete with vivid, explicit pictures, by male and female teachers, who will explain only the technical and biological techniques of sex, without the needed moral and religious guidance? (Section 12, and Section 4-h of the bill)\n\n2. Do you want your teenage children (ages 12 to 17) to hunger for \"satisfying sex\" by using condoms and contraceptives because the bill, if it becomes law, will give them that right to have \"satisfying sex\" anytime they want to, and the law forbids the parents to stop them? (Section 4-c, 4-g, 4-h)\n\n3. If the bill becomes law, the government can punish you, as the parents, if you refuse to have your children be given the sex lessons in school. Penalties range from jail terms of one to 6 months and/or a fine of P10,000 to P50,000. (Sections 12, 4-h, 21-e and 22 of the bill). Do you want this?\n\n4. If the bill becomes law, the people of all religions in the country (parents, teachers, priests, pastors, lay leaders and others) can be arrested if they oppose this law. The same jail terms of one to 6 months, and/or fines of P10,000 to P50,000. (Sections 12, 4-h, 21 and 22 of the bill) Do you want this?\n\n5. If one of your children of minor age is subjected to child abuse, do you want the government to decide on its own what to do with him/her? Without your parental consent? (Section 21, a-3). Do you want this?\n\n6. If the bill becomes law, the wife can have a ligation, and the husband can have a vasectomy, without either's consent. The RH bill will legalize this betrayal of trust between spouses. It will also punish the health worker, doctor or nurse who refuses to do this medical technique on the basis of no consent of the other spouse. (Sections 21, a-2 of the bill.) Do you want this?\n\nIf you answer \"NO\" to any of these questions, find out who among the presidential, senatorial and congressional candidates have authored, sponsored or supported this RH Bill 5043, then make your decision whom to vote for.\n\nRemember, what is at stake here is the survival of the Filipino family -- your own family and your children’s families. Choose correctly your candidates.\n\nVOTE WISELY. VOTE PRO-LIFE. SAVE THE FILIPINO FAMILY!\n\n(BUMOTO NG TAMA. BUMOTO SA MGA KANDIDATO NA PRO-LIFE.\n\nILIGTAS ANG PAMILYANG PILIPINO!)\n\nFROM THE SERVANT GENERAL\n\nA COVENANT FOR LIFE\n\nApril 27,2010\n\nMy dear brothers and sisters in Christ,\n\nPeace in the Lord Jesus!\n\nOn May 10 we have the elections. As always, electing capable people to government is crucial for the well-being of our nation. For this election in particular, what is at stake are the very things we stand for family and life.\n\nAs you well know, the anti-family and anti-life forces are rampaging throughout the world, supported by powerful forces such as the US government under President Obama, the European Union, elements of the United Nations, liberal international media (CNN, New York Times, etc.), liberal billionaires (Oprah, Warren Buffett, etc.), and homosexualist groups.\n\nOne by one the different nations have fallen under this assault. Now they have abortion, divorce, contraception, same sex marriage, valueless sex education, euthanasia. Make no mistake about it the assault on the Philippines is under way!\n\nAs such, the elections of May 10 are crucial. We need a pro-life President and other officeholders who are pro-life. We must not elect those who are pro-choice, pro-RH bill, pro-population control. That would be a disaster for the culture of life in our nation.\n\nIn regard to this, I invite you to participate in a Mass and Covenant Signing for the Protection of the Filipino Family. This will be on May 2, at 11:30 a.m., at the Manila Cathedral. The main celebrant will be His Eminence,Cardinal Gaudencio Rosales. Concelebrants are Archbp Paciano Aniceto, Chair of the Episcopal Commission on Family and Life, and Bp Jesse Mercado, Chair of the Episcopal Commission on the Laity. Political candidates vying for national posts will be invited to sign A COVENANT FOR LIFE.\n\nStand for life!\n\nWe ask for the Lord’s mercy and blessing upon our land.\n\nYours in Jesus and Mary,\n\nFrank Padilla\n\nFROM THE SERVANT GENERAL\n\nIN DEFENSE OF A BROTHER\n\n(Part 2)\n\nHoly Wednesday\n\nMarch 31, 2010\n\nMy dear brothers and sisters in Christ,\n\nThe scripture readings this Holy Week, starting from Palm Sunday, describe the lament of a man who is unjustly accused and viciously attacked. Such a man is our brother Manny Villar. The attacks against him have intensified.\n\nI want to say this outright: NONE OF THE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HIM ARE TRUE.\n\nThe attacks against him, especially by the camp of his major political opponent, are politically motivated, and have utilized lies and half-truths from the beginning. Two major columnists are at the forefront of the public attacks against him. Behind the scenes is a New Ager who was the GK guru, but who is now full-time in the Aquino campaign. I want to remind you that these three are the same persons who, during the crisis in CFC, unjustly maligned me, maligned Bishop Gabriel Reyes, and even maligned Cardinal Rylko of the Vatican.\n\nTheir latest attack is saying that Manny Villar was not born poor and that his brother Danny did not die because of their inability to provide medical care due to poverty. What shameful lies these are. Even Noynoy Aquino himself came out yesterday on primetime TV to aver these lies.\n\nManny indeed was born poor. When his commercial jingle says he swam in a sea of garbage, it is creatively describing his situation as a boy when they would be playing in the streets, and when the heavy rains came, they would find themselves amid the garbage that the waters would bring.\n\nHow about his brother Danny being brought to the hospital and the funeral parlor? Well, just this month, the wife of a security guard at our compound had a stroke. They are dirt poor. But she was brought to three hospitals including St Luke’s, rode a number of times in an ambulance, had two angiograms, and was given expensive medicine. Where did the money come from? It should be obvious. They begged and borrowed. Relatives, friends and employer then helped them.\n\nIt is shameful for Manny’s political opponent to desecrate the name of his dead brother by maligning him and maliciously questioning the sacrifices of his loving family!\n\nIn all the vicious and unfounded attacks, Manny Villar has maintained the high ground in his campaign. He is positive. He does not retaliate in kind. He tells the truth. He is a true Christian.\n\nManny Villar is an exemplary Christian businessman and politician. That is probably why his political opponents need to resort to lies in order to try to bring him down. A sister of ours, who is a judge in a nearby province, recently told us that some Noynoy supporters came to her to ask if they could look at court records to dig up dirt on Villar. The campaign to discredit Manny Villar is deliberate and well-organized.\n\nManny and his wife Cynthia have been regular members of our community since 1999. They have been married for over 34 years. They have three well-behaved children. Manny was born poor and, knowing how it is to be poor, have the interest of the poor at heart. One of his primary goals is to greatly reduce poverty. Manny is only one of two Presidentiables (the other is JC de los Reyes) who is pro-life and is against the RH bill (though Gibo Teodoro lately also claimed to be anti-RH).\n\nDo not believe all the lies being hurled against Manny Villar. If you need to be clarified about certain issues, then look to his explanations or those of others. Do not just pass on negative maligning emails. It is unchristian to do so. And because of the constant barrage of lies that might start to convince you, in fairness and Christian charity, consider first the other side.\n\nHere are some rebuttals to the lies being said about Manny Villar.\n\nOn Monsod's C5 controversy, Ric Barcelona (ex-student of Monsod) crafted a rebuttal and a sequel - message:\n\nhttp://www.mabuhayradio.com/sections/real-estate/5391-c5-sound-and-fury-is-solita-monsod-painting-the-full-picture.html............http://www.mabuhayradio.com/sections/real-estate/5420-monsodas-c5-analyses-errors-and-consequences.html...........\n\n..........\n\nVillar's lawyer also sent in a letter to refute Monsod's claims:\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Professionals-for-Manny-B-Villar-Pro-MBV/243075437807?v=app_2347471856#%21/topic.php?uid=243075437807&topic=13632\n\nOn the Senate investigation of the C5 brouhaha:\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Professionals-for-Manny-B-Villar-Pro-MBV/243075437807?v=app_2347471856#%21/notes/professionals-for-manny-b-villar-pro-mbv/the-c5-timeline-its-really-all-politics/302519919512\n\nOn the hoax Mansion story:\n\nhttp://politicalamateur.wordpress.com/2010/02/22/and-the-black-propaganda-backfires-palpak-to-the-max/.................or\n\nto\n\nhttp://www.mabuhayradio.com/sections/politics/5393-yellow-tainted-integrity-and-corrupted-disposition.html\n\nDrawing comparisons between C5 and the SCTex controversy, Magno's article is a must-read:\n\nhttp://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=547074&publicationSubCategoryId=64\n\nOn the Hacienda Luisita controversy plus the SCTex project:\n\nhttp://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=547074&publicationSubCategoryId=64\n\n.

That is your right and privilege. I would like you to do that intelligently and prayerfully. We in community can have different candidates, and there is nothing wrong with that. We uphold our democratic system and an individual’s freedom of choice. But as a Christian community, we ultimately look to our Lord Jesus Christ, even in our political actions and choices. We should never be part of deliberate and malicious lying, as that makes us not children of God but of Satan, who “is a liar and the father of lies” (Jn 8:44).\n\nIt is terribly wrong to lie and malign and viciously and unjustly attack the integrity and good name of an individual. Manny Villar is our brother whom we must stand up for and defend.\n\nPlease pray for our brother Manny Villar, that he would continue to maintain the high moral ground, and simply trust in God for his vindication.\n\n“But I am afflicted and in pain;\n\nlet your saving help protect me, God”\n\n(Psalm 69:30)\n\nGod bless you all.\n\nIn the service of God and nation,\n\nFrank Padilla\n\nCFC-FFL\n\nHaving a Life-giving Household\n\nHouseholds are small pastoral groupings of members. They are essential to the life and mission of our community. They are where members are cared for, and where members continue to grow in the Lord.\n\nA household is led by a leader assigned to it. However, every member of the household needs to take responsibility for the good conduct of the household, and help ensure that it becomes life-giving for everyone. If there is anything amiss, household members should speak up and discuss the problem, and together, under the direction of the leader, take steps to change the situation. The leader, being a servant, must be open and even desirous of such inputs, as a way of ensuring that the household members themselves find the household life-giving.\n\nWhat makes for a life-giving household? First are the technical aspects.\n\n(1) It must be regular. Household meetings are never cancelled, unless getting to the meeting becomes physically impossible, such as in the case of flooding.\n\n(2) It must be on time. There is an arrival time, and there is a starting time, about 15 to 30 minutes after. Members should strive to be at the meeting venue at the arrival time. This gives some leeway to unexpected traffic.[1] If one arrives early, then all the better, so that there is some fellowship time. One does not arrive and immediately jump into the worship portion. Further, the meeting should start on time at the agreed on starting time, or at most just 5 or 10 minutes later, even if not everyone has arrived.\n\n(3) It must have the three basic ingredients of worship, discussion/sharing and fellowship.[2] It must follow the prescribed times for each aspect. Worship is about 30 minutes, discussion/sharing is for one hour, fellowship is for 30 minutes to an hour. Overall it should be from two to three hours.\n\n(4) It must NOT become a service meeting.[3] There are other designated times for service meetings.\n\n(5) It must end on time, and not too late in the evening (if it is on an evening).[4] A household meeting certainly should not spill over into the next day (that is, after midnight).[5]\n\nIn all the above, the household leader must be the one to ensure these happen. Members who violate the above must be reminded and encouraged. If they continue to do so, they must be corrected more forcefully.\n\nSecondly, what makes for a life-giving household is the fraternal aspect. The household members are brothers and sisters in Christ. They are journeying together along the path of Christ, which is the way of holiness. They have a responsibility, as they themselves grow in the Lord, to help the others grow as well.[6]\n\nA relationship as brethren in Christ can mean a number of things.\n\n(1) It is a relationship of love. Household members are to love each other as Christ has loved them.\n\n(2) There is fraternal correction. Such is not just left to the household leader, but everyone else takes responsibility to correct whatever is amiss.\n\n(3) It is a relationship of friendship. Household members should desire to grow in their friendships and to the ties that bind. It should be such that they look forward to being together for the household meeting, and eagerly anticipate it.\n\n(4) It is a relationship of loyalty. Household members guard their hearts from anger, resentment or the like. If there is any personal problem, it is resolved quickly.\n\n(5) It is a relationship of trust. Household members trust each other enough to become vulnerable, such that they can openly share their lives, especially their challenges and shortcomings.[7] The principle of confidentiality is to be strictly observed.\n\nThirdly, what makes for a life-giving household is the pastoral aspect. We have households so that we will grow in the Lord. The household, normally being held in the church that is the home, is a school of spirituality.\n\nThus a number of elements are important.\n\n(1) Worship should be alive and vibrant. Household members must participate actively in the singing and the prayers. They should be open to receiving and sharing the word from the Lord. They must have the faith to know that they are in the presence of Jesus, and accord him the praise and worship that is his due.\n\n(2) There should be serious discussion and sharing. Normally the men meet separately from the women.[8]\n\n(a) For the first year, the discussions follow a specific track, based on the teaching courses that are taken up.\n\n(b) For the succeeding years, there is flexibility as to content. It can be Bible sharing, personal sharing, or discussion of a particular topic.\n\n(c) For discussion of topics, there are many resources available in the Church. In particular, the books and writings of the Servant General are suggested topics to be taken up.\n\n(3) The household leader must strive to be a true servant leader.[9]\n\nFinally, since the household meeting is basically a spiritual activity, there is the needed spiritual preparation. All members of the household, especially the leader, should spend some time, before arriving at the household venue, praying to God about the meeting.\n\n(1) Ask God to bind any spirits that are not of Him, and to send His angels to stand guard along your way and over the venue.\n\n(2) Ask for wisdom and discernment.\n\n(3) Ask for the grace by which every member of the household will be joyful and loving.\n\nThere are many life-giving elements in community. There is our personal prayer and Bible reading. There are the many teachings, formation tracks, and leaders training. There are the assemblies and other activities. But the household is unique in that the receivers are also the givers, and vice versa. The household is thus the basic cell of community--for formation, for fraternal relationships, for moving the whole community forward.\n\n(SG. Dec 15, 2009)\n\n[1] When someone is late, he often says it is because of the traffic. Indeed there was traffic, but if you ask him what time he left his home, you will see that he left already late.\n\n[2] Unless it is just a time for fellowship, which normally happens once a quarter.\n\n[3] If there is an urgent need, the fellowship portion can be turned into a service meeting.\n\n[4] For example, 8pm to 11pm. If members can meet earlier and end earlier, all the better.\n\n[5] When it is already the time of fellowship, those who need to leave earlier than the rest should feel free to do so.\n\n[6] While the household leader is the basic pastor, every member, sharing in the priestly ministry of Christ, ministers to everyone else.\n\n[7] It is not necessary to bare all secrets.\n\n[8] This is very important. Only in rare times should the men meet together with the women for this portion. This is basically so that the men will grow together as men of God, and the women as women of God. Men and women have different needs, and different dynamics in relationships. Further, this allows them to take up different topics for discussion and sharing.\n\n[9] Let your other “bible” be the book Servant Leadership .\n\nFROM THE SERVANT GENERAL\n\nDISOBEYING JESUS\n\nJanuary 28, 2009\n\nWe are disciples of Jesus, and we are supposed to live a life of obedience to him. Is it then ever permissible to disobey Jesus? We know that the answer is No. Never!\n\nBut there were people during the time of Jesus who did disobey him, and I would actually extol them. Before you cast aspersions on me, let me explain.\n\nWho were these people who disobeyed Jesus? They were the ones he healed and whose lives he changed. There were the leper (Mk 1:40-42), the two blind men (Mt 9:27-30a), and the deaf and mute man (Mk 7:32-35). Jesus told all of them not to speak about their healing (Mk 1:43-44; Mt 9:30b; Mk 7:36a).\n\nBut they disobeyed Jesus.\n\nThe leper immediately “went away and began to publicize the whole matter. He spread the report abroad ….” (Mk 1:45).\n\nThe two no-longer blind men “went out and spread word of him through all that land.” (Mt 9:31).\n\nThe deaf-mute, and the people who witnessed the healing, were adamantly disobedient, such that “the more he ordered them not to, the more they proclaimed it.” (Mk 7:36b).\n\nWhy would those whom Jesus had done such a great thing for disobey him? Well, they disobeyed him precisely because he did such a great thing for them. They simply could not contain their joy. They could not hold back their amazement. They simply could not keep such miraculous works to themselves. They could not be selfish and keep silent about this miracle worker. They had to share him with others. They were extremely grateful. Jesus had radically transformed their lives.\n\nWhat in effect had they become? They had become evangelizers. They proclaimed the good news of salvation and healing in Jesus.\n\nPaul, that great apostle, himself said, “woe to me if I do not preach (the gospel)!” (1 Cor 9:16b). Just like those whom Jesus healed, Paul could not be restrained.\n\nHow about us? God has blessed us tremendously (though we often do not recognize the blessings). Do we thank Him? Do we proclaim His greatness? Are we enthusiastic about sharing our experience of Him with others? Or are we uncaring, complacent, disinterested, too preoccupied with other things? Or perhaps we do tell others about Jesus, but not passionately. We do not respond in the manner and to the extent that God has blessed us. Jesus gave his all, but we only give a small part of ourselves.\n\nCFC-FFL is called to be evangelistic and missionary. This is the reason for our existence. We are to proclaim Christ. We should be as enthusiastic as the people Jesus healed. We should work such that “his fame (would) spread everywhere throughout the whole region” (Mk 1:28), that “people (would keep) coming to him from everywhere” (Mk 1:45c), that “the whole crowd (would rejoice) at all the splendid deeds done by him” (Lk 13:17b), and that “all (would be) astonished by the majesty of God” (Lk 9:43). We should work such that Jesus would be known and loved by all.\n\nAnd in our situation, we do not face the dilemma of wanting to speak about Jesus but being told not to. Jesus does not tell us not to speak about him. On the contrary. Jesus commands us to “go into the whole world and proclaim the gospel to every creature” (Mk 16:15).\n\nMake sure you obey.\n\nFROM THE SERVANT GENERAL\n\nUSHERING IN THE YEAR 2009\n\nJanuary 1, 2009\n\nMy dear brothers and sisters in the Lord,\n\nHappy New Year!\n\nI pray that you had a wonderful Christmas holiday, not just with lots of partying, but with extra time for prayer and thanksgiving and rejoicing in the blessings God has showered upon us in 2008. Now it is back to work. And that is something we should all be looking forward to, especially in our work for the kingdom.\n\nWe face a new year. What kind of a year will it be? Well, it will be entirely up to us (by the grace of God).\n\nBrothers and sisters, for us personally:\n\nWe can always maintain our joy, because our joy is Christ. No matter what is happening in our lives, including the seeming negatives, we are loved by God and God has the most wonderful plan for us.\n\nWe can always have hope, because our hope is Christ. God is merciful and we can trust in His divine mercy. God is faithful and we can look to His outpouring of grace and blessings upon us.\n\nBut we are not just to maintain our own equanimity in Christ, but we are once again given the privilege, and responsibility, of making a positive difference in and for the world. We are called on to build the kingdom of God in our midst. We do that by building our homes and our community into a holy army that will fight for God’s righteousness, working to enthrone Jesus in the hearts of every person, every home, every community and every nation.\n\nBrothers and sisters, CFC-FFL is an evangelistic and missionary community. This is why God raised CFC in 1981, re-founded CFC in 1993, and then raised a remnant in 2007. This is our reason for being. This is how we become God’s instruments according to His plan. This is what makes us relevant in the world today. This is how we can look forward to a future full of hope.\n\nIf we trust in Jesus for our life, our family and our work, then 2009 will necessarily be a very happy new year.\n\nMy prayer is that you will indeed have such a year.\n\nGod bless you.\n\nYour brother and servant,\n\nFrank Padilla\n\nFROM THE SERVANT GENERAL\n\nON BLIND OBEDIENCE\n\nDecember 31, 2008\n\nHello brothers,\n\nAs we face a new year of serving our people, it is timely to be reminded of our proper posture of authority. We lead as servants. And unlike the world, authority does not mean being authoritarian. We do not lord it over people, we do not dictate on people, we do not run people's lives. We do not expect or demand blind obedience.\n\nBlind obedience is expected of no one, even by the Lord. Blind obedience violates our innate dignity and freedom. Blind obedience is different from faith, which we have in Jesus. We fully trust in Jesus, but it is not a blind trust, as we see clearly that He is all good, desiring only our well-being, and is all-powerful for whom nothing is impossible. We obey God because of our faith and hope in His eternal love.\n\nWe also obey those the Lord puts over us, whether the Church hierarchy or our community leaders. But again, such obedience cannot be blind. We do not just blindly follow whatever is demanded of us. If fact, servant leaders should make no demands, but rather just give directives in accord with their positions of leadership. Then what is expected of subordinates is active submission. This means that they should heed and acknowledge one's leader with respect, as it is the Lord who places that person in authority, but if for any reason one's conscience does not allow him to just accept a directive, then he is not expected to just blindly do so. He can reason it out, ask for a dialogue, appeal to a higher authority, even correct what he believes to be wrong. This of course should be done in good order, with respect and fraternal love and loyalty.\n\nServant leadership and active submission are the key to peace, unity and good order in community. Blind obedience, whether demanded or given, is what violates what the Lord has provided and what ultimately leads the community astray.\n\nGod bless.\n\nfrank\n\n\"For to me life is Christ, and death is gain.\" (Phil 1:21)W\n\n----- Forwarded Message ----\n\nFrom: CFCFFL Home Office <homeoffice@cfcffl.org>\n\nSent: Wednesday, December 24, 2008 9:10:47 PM\n\nSubject: THE COMING OF THE SAVIOR\n\nFROM THE SERVANT GENERAL\n\nTHE COMING OF THE SAVIOR\n\n“And the Word became flesh\n\nand made his dwelling among us”\n\n(John 1:14a)\n\nDecember 25, 2008\n\nMy beloved brethren in Christ,\n\n“Do not be afraid; for behold, I proclaim to you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. For today in the city of David a savior has been born for you who is Messiah and Lord.” (Lk 2:10-11). Thus did the angel of the Lord proclaim to the shepherds the birth of Jesus.\n\n“And suddenly there was a multitude of the heavenly host with the angel, praising God and saying: ‘Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.’” (Lk 2:13-14). Heaven burst out in joyful celebration and worship. Indeed, it was the most momentous moment in all history, when God came into the world as a human baby, to usher in the start of the life and work of the Savior of the world.\n\nToday we Christians celebrate Christmas. Despite problems and woes, we manage to be joyful. Despite antagonisms and conflicts, we manage to wish goodwill to others. Despite tragedies and injustice, we manage, even for just a moment, to feel peace within us.\n\nBut what will the new year bring? In a week’s time, will the peace and joy of Christmas already be a thing of the past, something that was briefly enjoyed in the year that has gone?\n\nIt does not have to be that way. The angel talked of not being afraid, of good news, of great joy, of the universality of the good news.\n\nThe birth of Jesus is good news. It is the greatest news ever. A Savior has been born. We will be redeemed from sin and darkness. Our lives can be turned totally around, for the better.\n\nThis great news is for all. For even the vilest of sinners. Nay, precisely for the vilest of sinners. No one is to be excluded from the grace and blessing of God.\n\nAnd so all should rejoice. Salvation, transformation, renewal, deliverance, grace upon grace, fullness of life all these are within reach. And God desires for all to have them.\n\nSo we should no longer be afraid. No matter what our situation in life, no matter how deep in the pit we are at the moment, we can confidently look forward to God’s action on our behalf. And if God is for us, who can be against us? We can move on with our lives with confidence and trust.\n\nBut after two millennia, why is the world, already lighted up by the birth of the Savior, still in darkness, in conflict, and unhappy?\n\nIt is because we have not done our part. What then must we do? First, we must allow Jesus to be born in our very own hearts. We must be personally transformed in Christ, and live out our lives according to the ways of the Savior. We must grow in holiness.\n\nSecond, we must allow Jesus to be born in our homes. We must build a family for Christ, and live in a home inhabited as well by the Holy Spirit. In our home, all will be formed with truly Christian values.\n\nFinally, we must work such that Jesus is born in every other heart as well. We must do the work of evangelization. We must proclaim Christ to the whole world. Jesus depends on us! To proclaim this good news, this salvation in Jesus, this reign of Jesus in our lives, this coming of peace into the world this task is our privilege and our responsibility. When we do so, the heavenly host will again burst out with exultant joy. “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings glad tidings, announcing peace, bearing good news, announcing salvation, and saying to Zion, ‘Your God is King!’” (Is 52:7).\n\nLet us shout for joy for the Lord restores us, and let us break out in song for the Lord redeems us (Is 52:8-9). Let us live such that Jesus becomes incarnate in our lives and makes his dwelling among us. And let us work such that “all the ends of the earth will behold the salvation of our God.” (Is 52:10b).\n\nThis is what Christmas means. That is how Christmas will remain in people’s hearts and lives, long after the festive celebrations have ceased.\n\nHave a blessed Christmas.\n\nYour brother and servant,\n\nFrank Padilla\n\nFROM THE SERVANT GENERAL\n\nJune 14, 2008\n\nSubject: THE “COUPLES FOR CHRIST” NAME\n\nMy dear brothers and sisters in Christ,\n\nPeace!\n\nOn June 5, the Philippines’ Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC), on our petition, issued an Order reviving the original CFC foundation established in 1984, the “COUPLES FOR CHRIST FOUNDATION INC.” (CFCFI). This means that we now have legal right to the name “CFC,” and this is a prior right to that of CFC-GK-IC, with its corporation of CFCGMFI established in 1993.\n\nMany bishops, both in the Philippines and in other countries, have recognized CFC-FFL. They include Bishop Gabriel Reyes, the Spiritual Director of CFC (before he resigned as Spiritual Director of CFC-GK) and the Chair of the Episcopal Commission on the Laity, and Archbishop Angel Lagdameo, Archbishop of Jaro and President of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP). In a recent letter to me dated May 27, Cardinal Stanislaw Rylko, President of the Pontifical Council for the Laity, also left it to individual bishops to recognize CFC-FFL, including that of our name.\n\nTherefore, from both the spiritual and the secular, from both Church and state, we have every right to use the name “Couples for Christ.”\n\nEven from the moral and ethical standpoint, we can and should use the name “CFC.” The Church considers me the founder of CFC, and in the ecclesiology of new movements, the charism resides in the founder. Where the founder is, there is the charism. Where the charism is, there is the authentic CFC.\n\nSo to all my brothers and sisters in CFC-FFL, if you ever had any doubts at all before, be assured that you are indeed CFC. The Church and the state, and I believe the Lord as well, say so.\n\nWith regard to our brethren in CFC-GK, we do not intend to do to them what they have been doing to us. For the sake of peace and eventual reconciliation, we do not intend to prevent them from using the name “CFC,” for as long as they strive to not let go of what it means to be truly CFC.\n\nIn fact, I reiterate my long-standing and constant proposal, that of having one big CFC family but with two separate and distinct branches. This has many models among the religious congregations, such as the Franciscans and the Carmelites. This way, we co-exist peacefully, and even keep the door open to eventual reconciliation and true unity.\n\nI extend my hand of peace to my brethren in CFC-GK.\n\nFor us in CFC-FFL, let us continue to move on, as we have been doing. There is much work to be done. Since last year we have been praying: “Lead us back to you, O Lord, that we may be restored: give us anew such days as we had of old.” (Lam 5:21). The Lord has answered our prayers. God has restored us to our authentic charism of evangelization and family life renewal. Now God has even restored the original CFC foundation. So now we look to such days of old, when we were focused on our calling, and when we zealously proclaimed Christ throughout the world.\n\nLet us praise and thank God for His wondrous deeds in our lives and in our work. We thank our Blessed Mother Mary for interceding for us and granting our prayers. Let us be humbled by God’s faithfulness to us, and continue to dedicate ourselves totally to Him and to our mission.\n\nAnd let us continue to rejoice! Always!\n\nGod bless us all.\n\nYour brother and co-worker in Christ,\n\nFrank Padilla\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n*************************************************************************\n\nREFLECTIONS ON PERSECUTION AND SUFFERING\n\nThe readings these past 3 days have been consistent in talking about persecution and suffering. These are God’s words to us. They direct our path.\n\nJune 6 – 2 Tim 3:12 “In fact, all who want to live religiously in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.”\n\nJune 5 – 2 Tim 2:8-9 “such is my gospel, for which I am suffering, even to the point of chains, like a criminal.”\n\nJune 4 – 2 Tim 1:8,12 “bear your share of hardship for the gospel with the strength that comes from God. ….. On this account I am suffering these things”\n\nSuffering and carrying the cross are the ways of a true disciple.\n\nWhat are some of these sufferings? The fulltimers who resigned/retired from CFC-GK are not being given their benefits (for some it will be almost a year already), and are in dire need, for daily sustenance and for coming education expenses. Our intercessors are being viciously attacked spiritually, to the point of physical suffering. Our seniors throughout the world are being maligned and attacked personally. GK beneficiaries who align with us are being threatened. A brother was even ousted from the golf committee!\n\nThere is no let-up, and in fact the attacks are intensifying. Look at their blogs (I myself do not, but hear about their content), their anonymous emails, the newspaper attacks, the continuing disinformation (quoting even the Vatican out of context).\n\nLamentations continues!\n\nWhat is God doing? God is forming us in order to prepare us for the glorious years ahead.\n\nThis is a time of purification. SO REJOICE! The extent and the intensity of the persecution and our suffering are directly proportional to the glory that God intends to accomplish in and through His holy remnant.\n\nGod is teaching us and forming us. We should not focus on crying out for relief or for His judgment on those who persecute us, but we should be entering more deeply into understanding His ways and allowing these to be embedded deeply within our very being.\n\nJune 5 – Ps 25:4-5 “Make known to me your ways, Lord; teach me your paths. Guide me in your truth and teach me”\n\nJune 6 – Ps 119:157,159-160 “Though my persecutors and foes are many I do not turn from your decrees. ….. See how I love your precepts, Lord; in your kindness give me life. Your every word is enduring; all your just edicts are forever.”\n\nSo what are these continuing and intensifying persecutions all about?\n\nFirst, they help purify us. So praise God for this great way to grow in holiness. Without such trials and crosses, we would not be as holy.\n\nJune 4 – 2 Tim 1:9 “He saved us and called us to a holy life, not according to our works but according to his own design and the grace bestowed on us in Christ Jesus before time began”\n\nSecond, they teach us, in a painful but blessed way, how we are to be as Christians (pain is inherent in the process of purification). They prepare us for our relationships (with God, with brethren, with others) for the work of the future. Given what we are enduring, we must learn not to fall into such sins ourselves.\n\nØDo not lie. This will include such things as half-truths and distortions (such as reporting only the good and hiding the bad).\n\nØDo not just speak about love but actually love. Do we still harbor grudges against each other? Are we unable to forgive? Do we look down on others? Do we look to the interest of our brethren first and foremost? Are there brethren we have not fully accepted with the love of the Lord?\n\nØDo not be tampuhin (onion-skinned). This is a sign of great immaturity. This shows we do not have the heart of a servant.\n\nØLook to serving God and not man. We look beyond the shortcomings of those over us. As we do so, we see Christ, who is the one we are actually serving.\n\nØDo not malign others. But speak the truth in righteousness. It is the truth that sets people free. But let your speech be gracious.\n\nØLove your enemy. It is God who will judge them. Pray that they will be converted so that they will not be judged harshly.\n\nØBe at peace with all.\n\nThird, God is giving us the privilege to be directly invested. There is no other way to truly transform us. We know all about suffering and crosses, but this cannot just be a vicarious experience. Unless we ourselves experience them in a personal, concrete and significant way, the impact on our lives is limited. God loves us so much and is preparing us for so great a future that He is prolonging and allowing the intensification of our suffering.\n\nSo what do we do?\n\nFirst, and again, REJOICE! We are worthy to suffer even just a little bit of what Jesus suffered—false accusation, betrayal, abandonment, insults, ridicule, painful blows, hatred. The fruit of such little suffering will be tremendous and awesome.\n\nSecond, continue to learn the lessons of Lamentations. This is not just for 2007, but forever. At least once every year, preferably during Lent, read and meditate on the book 40 Days of Lamentations. Look to suffering and pain and the cross as God’s blessings (if we have not acted unrighteously). Meditate on the very many passages in the Bible that speak of this (Mt 5:10-12; Acts Acts 5:41; Acts 14:22; Jas 1:2-4; 1 Pt 1:6-7; 1 Pt 2:19-21; 1 Pt 4:12-19; 2 Cor 1:3-7; 2 Cor 6:3-10; 2 Cor 12:9-10; Phil 2:5-8; Col 1:24; Heb 12:1-13; many others). But always remember, Lamentations is about hope and joy.\n\nThird, let go and let God. Many times this will entail not just a spiritual assent, but actual physical or material loss. For example, while the fulltimers should fight for what is legally and morally due to them, they should not be focused on the money (no matter how great their need) and even at some point be willing to suffer material loss as they go about the Lord’s work. Let go of money, of reputation, of employment, of friends (because of them, not because of us), even of golf. But in all things, be blameless. And trust in God.\n\nLet us keep our eyes fixed on Jesus.\n\nJune 4 – Ps 123:1-2 “To you I raise my eyes, to you enthroned in heaven. ….. so are our eyes on the Lord our God, till we are shown favor.”\n\nLet us continue to recognize our own sinfulness and look to God’s mercy. Let us always consider the plank in our own eye and not the splinter in others. Let us humble ourselves, and allow the Lord to raise us up.\n\nJune 5 – Ps 25:8-9,11 “Good and upright is the Lord, who shows sinners the way, guides the humble rightly, and teaches the humble the way. ….. For the sake of your name, Lord, pardon my guilt, though it is great.”\n\nLet us follow Jesus’ (and Paul’s) teaching, with all that these entail.\n\nJune 6 – 2 Tim 3:10-11 “You have followed my teaching, way of life, purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance, persecutions, and sufferings”\n\nJune 5 – Ps 25:14 “The counsel of the Lord belongs to the faithful; the covenant instructs them.”\n\nLet us continue to put our faith, trust and hope in God.\n\nJune 6 – 2 Tim 3:11 “Yet from all these things the Lord delivered me.”\n\nJune 5 – Ps 25:6-7 “Remember your compassion and love, O Lord; for they are ages old. Remember no more the sins of my youth; remember me only in light of your love.”\n\nLet us remain faithful to God, to His ways, and to our covenant. Let us fear the Lord in His awesome majesty. This is the way to being blessed.\n\nJune 6 – 2 Tim 3:14 “But you, remain faithful to what you have learned and believed”\n\nJune 5 – Ps 25:12-13 “Who are those who fear the Lord? God shows them the way to choose. They live well and prosper, and their descendants inherit the land.”\n\nLet us rejoice, for the victory, in God’s time and in God’s way, is at hand.\n\nGod console, sustain, strengthen, and bless you all.\n\nfrank\n\nJune 6, 2008\n\n*************************************************************************\n\nJune 6, 2008\n\nSubject : Current Status of CFC-FFL with the Vatican\n\nFOR ALL CFC-FFL LEADERS\n\nDear brethren,\n\nI am in receipt of a letter dated May 27 from Cardinal Rylko of the Pontifical Council for the Laity. Cardinal Rylko expressed the following:\n\n(1) The Vatican's concern for the situation of CFC.\n\n(2) His concern for the misleading manipulation of confidential letters from the dicasteries of the Holy See.\n\n(3) Their being saddened by the newspaper articles that gravely offended the Holy See and the Philippine bishops.\n\n(4) His regret that there is no immediate solution to the problems in CFC, but hoping for eventual reconciliation.\n\nCardinal Rylko conveys the following:\n\n(1) It is up to each bishop to recognize us and the use of the name CFC-FFL (or any other name for that matter).\n\n(2) He recommends avoiding further scandal and confusion by not using sarcastic or denunciatory expressions.\n\n(3) He urges us not to use \"Restoring the authentic CFC charism\" on our mastheads, as this does not help reconciliation.\n\nCardinal Rylko closed with asking for my collaboration, and trusting that I will make every effort for the good of CFC throughout the world.\n\nI have responded by assuring the Vatican of my sincere desire to bring healing and reconciliation. I reiterated my proposal for creative unity, that of one CFC with two separate branches. I assured him that we are committed to not causing scandal or confusion, and that we do not respond in kind to the unwarranted attacks against us. I have already given instructions, which I give to you all also, to remove the phrase \"Restoring the authentic CFC charism\" from letterheads, mastheads and eventually I.D.s. I have told him that we in CFC-FFL have moved on, approved by very many bishops throughout the world.\n\nThis is good news for us. Let us now move ahead and go about our work of evangelization and family life renewal.\n\nLet us continue to relate to our brethren in CFC-GK with friendship, cordiality and Christian charity, as I know you all are doing.\n\nGod bless us all.\n\nYour brother and co-worker in Christ,\n\nfrank\n\np.s. I have not given out a copy of Cardinal Rylko's letter because of his concern about the spread of confidential letters. If and when the Cardinal gives his permission, I will give out the copy. You may pass on this email to our leaders or to those who need to know. However, avoid wholesale email blasts.\n\n\"For to me life is Christ, and death is gain.\" (Phil 1:21)"
