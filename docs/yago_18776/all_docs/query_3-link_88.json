        "text": "Senator Cynthia Villar can’t understand why some people are hating on his husband, bilyonaryo Manny Villar, for being the richest Filipino.\n\nCynthia claims that her husband (“a poor boy in Tondo who made it good in this world”) makes sure that there will be no conflict of interest in any business he puts his money in because they know that people will “take it against them.”\n\nDuterte thinks Villar has nothing to apologize for being richest Filipino: Sino ba namang magnegosyo na lugi?\n\n“He (Manny) is an inspiration to all the poor people that if you work hard you can be what you want to be someday. So masama ba iyun? Bakit sila nagagalit na nagtagumpay ‘yung husband ko, di ba dapat i-admire nila iyun?” said Cynthia in an interview with ANC.\n\nCynthia tells graduates: Be like Manny Villar, be entrepreneurs not employees\n\n“We were in business long before we became public official and we’re very careful about conflict of interest kasi made-demanda kami diyan. So we have lawyers to say na dito wala kang conflict of interest, dito may conflict of interest ka kaya ‘yun,” she added.\n\nThe Villars have been accused of conflict of interest for taking key elective posts in government while building their business empire founded on cheap housing.\n\nManny used to be a congressman and senator before he retired from politics in 2010 after losing in the presidential elections.\n\nVillar is richest Filipino in January\n\nCynthia, who has taken Manny’s seat in the Senate, has been criticized for heading the Committees on Agriculture, Agrarian Reform, and Environment which gave her a direct hand in crafting the country’s land use policy, including the conversion of farm lands to subdivisions and shopping mall centers.\n\nManny Villar to return to politics? Cynthia says never say never\n\nTheir son, Mark, is the Secretary of Department Public Works and Highways which gives him the power over what roads and bridges get priority under the Duterte administration which critics claim directly or indirectly benefit Camella Homes and Vista Land projects."
