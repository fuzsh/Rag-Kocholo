        "text": "I swear, I am NOT kidding! This really happened this afternoon! üëª\n\nI was watching episode 2 of Ms. Marvel (the MCU freak that I am) on my android while lying down on my sleeping mattress here in my mini library. My mattress is right beside one of my bookshelves. The lights are off inside my windowless room. So my only source of light was my android.\n\nAll of a sudden, something fell on my chest! Of course I freaked out and gave out a sissy scream coz I didn‚Äôt see what it was. ü§£ I immediately jumped to my feet and turned on the light‚Ä¶\n\nLo and behold, it was the certificate of appreciation given to me by Mr. Vladimir Nieto and his group Konseho ng Herencia ng Lucena (Heritage Council of Lucena) exactly six years ago today!\n\nThe appreciation certificate, encased in wood and glass, was given to me after I gave a lecture about the Spanish documents that I retrieved from the Portal de Archivos Espa√±oles: PARES which proves that Lucena ‚Äîthe city of my birth‚Äî was founded on 3 November 1879. This means that the capital city of Tayabas Province (I will never call it Quezon) was founded 144 years ago today. But for reasons beyond me and logic, this foundation date is still not recognized by the local government unit of Lucena despite Mr. Nieto‚Äôs insistent lobbying.\n\nNow what puzzles me is how this certificate fell on my chest exactly on the day that Lucena City is supposed to celebrate its 144th founding anniversary. It‚Äôs not hanging on my wall; it‚Äôs just standing on top of my bookshelf leaning against the wall. But in spite of several tremors we‚Äôve experienced through the years, it didn‚Äôt even budge. It‚Äôs only now that it fell‚Ä¶ and right on top of me!\n\nI really don‚Äôt pay much attention to spooky stuff (I can watch horror movies alone in the dark), but when the city of your birth suddenly and literally haunts you on its birthday, well, that‚Äôs something else. Not scary, but something else that I couldn‚Äôt yet explain.\n\nBut I‚Äôm relieved the certificate didn‚Äôt fall on my nose.\n\nFollow me on Facebook, X, Instagram, and Threads.\n\nAm I the only one who has noticed that most of today‚Äôs Filipino youth have become a disrespectful, maleducated bunch? They have absolutely zero respect for their elders nowadays, most especially when they think they know that they have a reason to answer back. And with the growing popularity of ‚Äúmeme culture‚Äù, they have also become arrogant and brazen through the years, as if the memes or quote cards that they share on social media have all the right answers in the world, or as if they know more, or are smarter, than the people who have had more decades of joy and suffering, of triumph and defeat, ahead of them (little do they know that such brainless memes were created not really to inspire but to incite social media engagement).\n\nPardon the oratorical pedagogy, but coming from both a highly conservative Catholic family (father side) and a temporal one (mother side), I perfectly know where I stand regarding this malignant elephant in the room, and it‚Äôs high time that I speak up about it.\n\nFrom my father‚Äôs side of the family in Unis√°n, it‚Äôs virtually taboo for the younger ones to answer back, even if the elders are wrong, or even if the younger ones have all the right reasons in the world. An uncle of mine once shared to me that when he was being given a mouthful by his creole grandmother, he was admonished that he should never look at his elders straight in the eye while being scolded. The elders within this side of my family also practiced in sparing the rod and spoiling the child. Many people may no longer agree to this old-fashioned practice, that somehow there is a measure of domestic injustice in all of this. However, because of this ‚Äúinjustice‚Äù, my father‚Äôs family was able to preserve RESPECT and CIVILITY within themselves. Even up to his elders‚Äô dying days, whether or not the latter have done the former wrong, the younger generations are compelled to gather around the detested and feared elder to show their last respects, an endearing Filipino praxis that clueless, gadget-dependent kids today, ignorant as they are because of a sense of entitlement that has been egged on by an ethics-free social media engagement, label as ‚Äútoxic Filipino tradition‚Äù.\n\nThe exact opposite holds true with my mother‚Äôs side in Tondo, where Catholicism is mere affiliation rather than a way of life. From that detestable side of my life, the younger generations fought back against their elders, a literal riot, a free-for-all. I remember years ago when, during a heated argument, one disrespectful uncle almost attacked my maternal grandfather. It would have been an interesting fistfight had my grandfather did not hold his ground against his drossy son. It was both a humorous and hilarious scene that I will never ever forget. Today, this ‚ÄúTondo cancer‚Äù among the youth is spreading throughout many families all over the archipelago.\n\nSpeaking of toxic Filipino tradition, I have also noticed these past few years that many memes and vloggers are spreading this vile idea that today‚Äôs youth should have no responsibility toward their parents. Parents, they argue, should not regard their children as ‚Äúinvestments‚Äù, that children, after graduation, should be allowed to freely move out from the clutches of their ‚Äústifling parents‚Äù. While there is a measure of truth in this, today‚Äôs haughty kids should be reminded that this is not a rule but a norm. A loving norm, if I may add, because this is reflective of a child‚Äôs GRATITUDE toward the parents‚Äô sacrifices just to place them where they should be in society. What‚Äôs a family for if they will not help or support each other to survive this harsh world?\n\nSadly, today‚Äôs clueless, gadget-addict kids do not have an inkling that all this talk about ‚Äútoxic Filipino culture‚Äù is nothing more but a subtle and ingenious Masonic propaganda to destroy the family. But since today‚Äôs children would rather retweet or click on share than read books and think, they immediately gobble up this anti-family propaganda as if it‚Äôs gospel truth. As far as I‚Äôm concerned, today‚Äôs gadget-dependent kids who attack time-honored Filipino filial traditions by labeling them as toxic are the ones who are really toxic, a genuine scum of the earth who, in reality, only want to escape the burdens of responsibility to embrace hedonism.\n\nFollow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.\n\nI woke up to the sound of beating drums and fireworks. Because today is the feast day of San Isidro Labrador, the patron saint of farmers. But he is not the patron saint of our city (even though the river behind our apartment building bears his name). There is not even a barrio nor a church here in San Pedro Tunas√°n that is named after him.\n\nUsually, municipalities and cities hold festivities or ‚Äúfiestas‚Äù to honor their respective patron saints. For example, neighboring Bi√±√°n is now in a festive mood with its Puto Latik Festival. Although the name is secular, Puto Latik is deeply rooted to the honorifics vested upon San Isidro Labrador, its primary patron saint. Then there are the municipalities of Lucb√°n (Tayabas), Cuenca (Batangas), and Nabas (Acl√°n) just to name a few. These places have San Isidro as their patron saint.\n\nHowever, I understand that there are many other places in Filipinas that also hold San Isidro Labrador in high esteem even if he is not their premier patron. Aside from my city of residence, one best example is Ormoc (Leyte) whose premier patrons are San Pedro Ap√≥stol and San Pablo Ap√≥stol. But it still has festivities reserved every May 15 for San Isidro Labrador. Then there is Unis√°n (Tayabas), my father‚Äôs hometown. Its poblaci√≥n holds annual processions during the saint‚Äôs feast day although it has no church nor chapel dedicated to the saint there.\n\nThis is because the entirety of our country was once agricultural. And San Isidro Labrador himself was a farmer (the word ‚Äúlabrador‚Äù is Spanish for ‚Äúfarmer‚Äù). While our country may no longer be considered fully agricultural, small street parades such as the one that roused me up from bed are an indication that vestiges of our past lingers and refuses to die.\n\nSan Isidro Labrador is, hands down, one of our country‚Äôs most popular saints. What endeared him to the Filipino masses is his patronage: he represented those who till the land, those who labor on it, the downtrodden sector who toil the whole day to produce what is essential to the human being: food. And any mention of his name immediately reminds us of idyllic places ‚Äî Barrio San Isidro, wherever that may be in Filipinas, will always be that place of rural delights filled with delicious farmlands, tons of fruits and vegetables, sweet streams, and docile carabaos. So deeply entrenched is this saint in our cultural psyche that barrio folks think of him already as one of their own, as a Filipino saint. And so widespread and popular is his cult that one might think that he is the patron saint of the whole archipelago!\n\nBut even in this age of the Internet, very few of our countrymen still know that San Isidro Labrador was a Spanish farmer, a native of Madrid.\n\n¬°Feliz fiesta!\n\nFollow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.\n\nLate last year, a Spaniard by the name of Luis Mart√≠n Arriola commented on my blog. He‚Äôs into genealogy and was researching on his wife‚Äôs ancestors. It turns out that his Filipina wife Peachy is a distant cousin of mine, and that we have a common ancestor: Don Gregorio Bonilla y Calvo, our great-great grandfather. Luis Mart√≠n has been my Facebook friend ever since.\n\nYesterday, he sent me a digital copy of my Don Gregorio‚Äôs baptismal certificate. Fortunately, my knowledge of paleography allowed me to understand the difficult handwriting.\n\nAccording to this document, he was from Villa de Torremocha, C√°ceres, Spain and was born on 20 January 1859 (baptized four days later by Fr. Jos√© Calero). His parents were Gregorio Bonilla and Guadalupe Calvo. My great-great-grandfather later migrated to our country and married Querina Villa of Atimonan, Tayabas. They settled in nearby Unisan. One of their children was Rafaela Bonilla who married Paulo √âvora of Calap√°n, Mindoro. One of their children was Norma, my father‚Äôs mother.\n\nGregorio also had a daughter from another woman, but I‚Äôm not sure if it was out of wedlock or a previous marriage (or probably his first wife). His daughter‚Äôs name was Margarita, the mother of Atty. Benjam√≠n Salvosa who founded Baguio Colleges Foundation (now known as the University of the Cordilleras).\n\nI hope that one day, I‚Äôd get to walk the streets of Torremocha and breathe the same air that my Bonilla and Calvo ancestors breathed.\n\nFollow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.\n\n‚ÄúI paint a romantic picture of research because my experience has been truly so, and there have been times that, while going over the shelves aimlessly or hunting for a particular book, I came across something important that I was not looking for, something I did not know was there. It is called serendipity.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄìAmbeth R. Ocampo‚Äì\n\nA few years ago, while browsing the National Archives of the Philippines‚Äò catalogue of Erecci√≥n de Pueblos (establishment of towns) for anything I could find about Imus, Cavite (I was then a history consultant there), I stumbled upon an entry about my father‚Äôs hometown of Unis√°n, Tayabas (now Quezon). After seeing there the exact date of its foundation, I copied it on a slip of paper then put it in my wallet. Unfortunately, it got lost somewhere in my cluttered personal library.\n\nBut just this morning, I found out that the NAP has already digitized its erecci√≥n catalogue. While researching about Bi√±√°n (where I now work part-time as a history consultant), I again stumbled upon the entry for Unis√°n.\n\nFor many years, Unis√°n has recognized 18 February 1876 as its foundation date. They celebrate it as Araw ng Unis√°n. I don‚Äôt know what the basis of that date is, but the National Archives show something else‚Ä¶\n\nOn a report to the Spanish Crown dated 11 November 1879, it was stated that Unis√°n was established as a parish on 15 May 1879, on the feast day of San Isidro Labrador. Then a few months later, on 30 September 1879, it was established as a town. This is one of those rare cases wherein a place was established as a parish first ahead of being established as a civil town. Because as is usually the case, it is the other way around.\n\nThis rediscovery of Unis√°n‚Äôs foundation date partly corroborates the Tayabense town‚Äôs entry in the online catalogue of the Portal de Archivos Espa√±oles: the year stated there is 1879. Fortunately, there is no more need to go to Spain to take a look at the actual documents for further verification. They‚Äôre in our national archives, after all.\n\nInternet technology has made life easier for researchers. Nevertheless, it is still important to see the documents themselves rather than just rely on catalogues for there is always the danger of encountering typographical errors. Also, one doesn‚Äôt always get complete answers online. For one: another mystery left to be solved is to why the name Unis√°n was chosen to replace its original name of Calilaya (or Calilayan in other sources). While the meaning of Calilaya has already been deciphered (it pertains to river current), Unis√°n‚Äôs hasn‚Äôt been yet.\n\nI can‚Äôt wait to lay my hands on the actual documents on my next visit to the archives.\n\nFollow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.\n\n√ëgay√≥n namin cay√≥ caila√±gan.\n\nA few months ago, Rappler reported that the wealth of many of our country‚Äôs billionaires grew despite the pandemic. Ten or so of these billionaries are prominent, but there are actually more of them. To my estimation, at least thirty.\n\nNow, it‚Äôs back to square one for the government, with Metro Manila going back to a hard lockdown (Enhanced Community Quarantine) starting tomorrow due to a rising case of the dreaded Delta variant, a more dangerous strain of the COVID-19 virus circulating around the globe. Region IV-A might even follow suit (this according to a recent Facebook post by Cavite Gov. Jonvic Remulla). For sure, more livelihoods and businesses will be affected.\n\nThe national and local governments are in a quandary. They are running out of funds (if they haven‚Äôt yet) for alleviation programs. Imagine if our billionaires would chip in at least ‚Ç±1 billion to government efforts. How much would be the total?\n\nRam√≥n Ang\n\nAlfredo Ben√≠tez\n\nMark Cojuangco\n\nDavid Consunji\n\nTeresita Sy-Coson\n\nRobert Coyiuto Jr.\n\nLance Gokongwei\n\nAndrew Gotianun Sr.\n\nRoberto O√±gp√≠n\n\nManny Pacqui√°o\n\nManny Pa√±gilinan\n\nRicardo Po Sr.\n\nEnrique Raz√≥n Jr.\n\nMichael Romero\n\nEdgar S√≠a II\n\nAndr√©s Soriano\n\nElizabeth Sy\n\nHans Sy\n\nHarley Sy\n\nHerbert Sy\n\nHenry Sy Jr.\n\nAndrew Tan\n\nLucio Tan\n\nTony Tan Caktiong\n\nGeorge Ty\n\nCynthia Villar\n\nManny Villar\n\nFernando Z√≥bel de Ayala\n\nI√±igo Z√≥bel de Ayala\n\nJaime Z√≥bel de Ayala\n\nThat‚Äôs a total of ‚Ç±30 billion pesos. With that amount, they would be able to help millions of Filipinos who are financially suffering from this pandemic.\n\nBaca √±ga culang pa ang mgÃÉa billonario na iy√°n na nasa listahan, eh.\n\nAnd believe me: even if each of them will shell out a billion pesos or more from their own pockets (not from their companies), never will they become impoverished. They will continue living la vida loca. Their wealth machines will continue producing for them tons of moolah for years to come.\n\nThe question is: are they willing to do that for their countrymen?\n\nFollow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram."
