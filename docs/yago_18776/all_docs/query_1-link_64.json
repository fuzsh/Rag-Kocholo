        "text": "Against the advice of my assistants who are in their â€™20s, I decided to go with the corniest title for this column â€“ My Valentine. Tomorrow is a special day. After writing this column, I surprised my wife with a Valentineâ€™s getaway treat. Good luck to the husbands and partners planning their Valentine surprises.\n\nThroughout the years, most of the women entrepreneurs I have met value their relationship with their respective spouses. While women entrepreneurs are busy growing their negosyos, I observe that most of them are quite sentimental when it comes to Valentineâ€™s Day.\n\nIn light of this special time of the year, I asked some women entrepreneurs about their Valentineâ€™s Day expectations from their husbands.\n\nPatty Chilip, CEO of Standard Insurance and wife of Cris Chiliip, CEO of Tyremart Inc. said â€œValentineâ€™s is my favorite holiday because I love the idea of hearts and flowers. I used to work at a university with mostly women and we celebrated it like a national holiday where we all gave each other roses and chocolate. I think flowers are a classic gift and thus far, my husband has always remembered to send me amazing ones each year. My dad also sends me roses each year, which never fail to make me smile. I think Valentineâ€™s is about simple gifts and giving from the heart. It doesnâ€™t have the pressure of a Christmas gift so itâ€™s that much sweeter.â€\n\nSenator Cynthia Villar said â€œI always receive a basket or bouquet of flowers from Manny every Valentineâ€™s Day. Manny and I will have lunch with family friends. We may not go out for dinner anymore and just stay at home, since I expect the traffic to be very heavy, as Valentineâ€™s Day this year falls on a Friday and payday. In the past, we usually watch concerts but not this year.â€\n\nBeng Dee, COO of Foodlink Group reminisced: â€œthrough the years, itâ€™s still always nice to have a reason to celebrate love; Valentineâ€™s Day is one of those. So on that day, Iâ€™d definitely still want Rikki to bring me out on a planned dinner and of course get those flowers and chocolates, no matter how generic or clichÃ© it may beâ€ and she noted â€œI surely wouldnâ€™t mind being treated extra special on V-dayâ€.\n\nNurture Spa president Cathy Turvill said â€œInstead of expecting my spouse to do something, for me I would rather we both express our love and commitment to each other by being there for each other on that special day.â€\n\nMompreneur Tintin Bersola Babao is excited for their getaway saying â€œhe has exceeded my expectations and is flying me to Hong Kong this Valentineâ€™s weekend.\n\nSurely, there will be a rush of sentiments this Valentineâ€™s. I remember my teenage days making sure I personally hand pick the right color of roses in the flower shop. This reminded me of an entrepreneur who is in the flower business and who does extremely well in occasions like this.\n\nDustin Andaya, who we featured in our agripreneur book as an inspiring story, is the man behind the success of Island Rose and Philippine Cut Flower Corp., the countryâ€™s largest and most popular flower retailing venture. They started producing high quality roses in 1983. During that time, only a few were in the flower industry in the Philippines. Dustin saw the opportunity to grow and flourish a pioneering business.\n\nNow they are the single best supplier of Dutch and French roses to flower shops, hotels and restaurants, and event coordinators. They developed greenhouse technology to mimic European weather conditions and environmental control to regulate the temperature in their farms. These innovations are big steps ahead of the traditional way of growing flowers.\n\nâ€œKeeping relationships aliveâ€ is Dustin and the companyâ€™s thrust. This is the ideal statement to describe the business of flowers, especially this Valentineâ€™s Day. The companyâ€™s sales tend to increase more than 150 percent this special season, compared to their sales on regular days.\n\nOn Feb. 14 alone, they deliver more than 12,000 dozen flowers. Of course, classic red roses are their bestsellers. One of their most common delivery requests during Valentineâ€™s is filling a room with flowers â€“ thatâ€™s at least 10 dozens of flowers per customer.\n\nBeyond doubt, Dustinâ€™s business is not just about flowers. Itâ€™s a business that keeps relationships alive. After all, Valentineâ€™s is less momentous without the classic beauty and symbolism of flowers.\n\nSpeaking of loveâ€¦ Felipe Enrique Gozon Jr., the only son of Go Negosyo Trustee Felipe Gozon, tied the knot with Maria Estrelita Arles. Gozon Jr., is a very bright lawyer who met his better half in the same law firm that the father is a partner of where they both work. Congratulations to Mr. and Mrs. Felipe Enrique Gozon Jr.\n\nMy condolences to a good friend Ditto Borromeo, a childhood friend whose mom Nena Borromeo passed away the other day. His father, Fred Borromeo, gave an emotional eulogy about his wife, friend, and partner for 57 years. It is nice to see couples live their marriage vows â€“ in sickness and in health till death do us part. Itâ€™s such an inspiration for many who are married of what true love is.\n\nOn Feb. 19, Go Negosyo will be opening the doors of the SMX Convention Center in Pasay for the 3rd Filipino Technopreneurship Summit. This summit will feature Filipino tech giants like Engr. Dado Banatao of Tallwood Venture Capital, Manny V. Pangilinan of the PLDT Group, Maria Ressa of Rappler.com, and many more successful Filipino technopreneurs.\n\nFor more information, visit www.gonegosyo.net"
