        "text": "Senator Cynthia Villar doesn’t see the need for the Philippines to finally legalize divorce because she’s happily married to bilyonaryo Manny Villar.\n\nThe wealthiest Senate member made her position on the divorce bill known Wednesday (May 29), a week after the measure was approved on third and final reading by the House of Representatives.\n\n“Syempre nagulat ako sa kanila,” Villar said of the House move to approve the controversial bill that is opposed by conservative lawmakers and the Catholic Church.\n\n“Pero ako po, alam naman ng lahat I have a very happy family life. So I’m not in favor of divorce,” she added.\n\nVillar joins six other senators who have so far expressed opposition to the bill – Senate President Francis Escudero, former Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri, Senate President Pro Tempore Jinggoy Estrada, Francis Tolentino, Joel Villanueva, and Ronald Dela Rosa.\n\nThose who support divorce are Senator Risa Hontiveros – who authored the Senate version – Robin Padilla, Grace Poe, Imee Marcos, Pia Cayetano, and Raffy Tulfo. The other senators are still weighing their options.\n\nThe Philippines is the only country apart from Vatican City where divorce is not allowed."
