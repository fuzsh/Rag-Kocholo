        "text": "MANILA, Philippines – The advertisement was released in late January.\n\nOn television, the field is the radioactive green of a 7-11 Slurpee. A road cuts through the field. Mountains glow an uneasy purple. Thunder rolls. Lightning snaps. Computer-generated clouds shudder overhead. Music rolls under the presidential voiceover.\n\nThere may be many who would like to walk the straight road, says Benigno Aquino III, but some are merely pretenders to the path.\n\nThe sky opens. Sunlight shines through.\n\nTrust these few, says the President. They walk, one a time, down Aquino’s metaphorical straight road. The President names them. Angara. Aquino. Escudero. Hontiveros. Legarda. Madrigal. Magsaysay. Poe. Trillanes. That the candidates were made to walk on a treadmill in a room painted chroma green perhaps explains why Sonny Angara looks constipated, or why Bam Aquino, for example, walks as if there is a rope wrapped around his shoulders. The point, however, is clear.\n\nThe straight road, the Liberal Party’s tagline for good governance, was born out of opposition to Gloria Macapagal Arroyo’s perceived legacy of corruption. The coalition’s press release claims Team Pnoy is bound by a “shared set of principles,” but it is necessary to ask just what sort of principle is shared among members representing an alphabet soup of acronyms to create the unwieldy LP-AKBAYAN-NPC-NP-LDP-NUP coalition. The coalition is careful to say the sudden unity is “more than popularity.” It is a “union of principles,” one whose “primary consideration” in inviting candidates, along with track records, is the “commitment to push for the legislative component of President PNoy’s social contract with the Filipino people.”\n\nThis united legislative agenda should have made it safe to assume that Team Pnoy’s coalition candidates share the President’s pet principles, not least the Reproductive Health law, arguably one of the most divisive laws in recent Philippine legislation that was pushed to passing by the Aquino’s liberal juggernaut. This may be the case for Akbayan’s Risa Hontiveros, a decade-long stalwart of the RH law, or for Jun Magsaysay, who argues “for certain” that the law is needed. And yet the same “united senatorial slate” also invited Koko Pimentel, who continues to “disagree with committing billions of pesos just to buy consumables, condom, pill, injectable, and IUDs,” and Sonny Trillanes, who voted against the bill in 2012 “because of the provisions on sex education.” Team Pnoy also includes wife of 2010 presidential candidate Cynthia Villar, who still insists there is no truth in the idea “a big population is a liability.”\n\nYet the disagreement over the RH law is not the only point where the coalition’s united stand takes a turn. The coalition splits on the issue of the gun ban, just as the President demands a Comelec exemption from turning in his own personal arsenal. Chiz Escudero opposes sin taxes, the same bill that Aquino signed into law late last year claiming it was his Christmas gift to the Filipino people. Coalitionist Alan Peter Cayetano stands in opposition against a bill banning political dynasties, while candidates Jamby Madrigal, Jun Magsaysay and Pimentel stand firmly in support.\n\nIt’s in the past\n\nCompromises have also been made over what the party has claimed is its core issue—corruption.\n\nIn 2010, candidates Hontiveros and Madrigal coined the term “Villaroyo,” claiming that presidential candidate Manny Villar and his family were guilty of corruption in collusion with the Arroyo regime. At a time when any connection to the unpopular Arroyo was a death sentence for a candidate, Hontiveros tightened the noose, announcing that Villar was in fact the secret candidate of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.\n\nToday, Hontiveros, Madrigal and Cynthia Villar belong to Team Pnoy, coalition anti-corruption.\n\nMadrigal says she had differences with Senator Villar, not his wife, and hopes that “we will put the past behind us.”\n\nHontiveros says she does not withdraw her criticism, saying that she is “glad that the people I criticized before or I fought with on valid issues turned around and decided to support President Noy and his reform agenda.”\n\n“The issues before, they stand and they must be addressed by those who need to be held accountable.”\n\nIt would have been easy for Hontiveros or Madrigal to claim the moral high ground had thay protested Villar’s inclusion, or had they withdrawn their membership from the coalition. Instead, Hontiveros and Madrigal now campaign for a national position for the woman who shares assets with the man they claim is guilty of national corruption.\n\nPerhaps this is how they define unity.\n\nThe alternative\n\nIn early January, the United Nationalist Alliance released a January advertisement for its senatorial slate. UNA did not offer neon fields in its advertising campaign, only a van driving through a city devoid of color, with a voiceover asking why poverty exists in spite of the straight road. In the commercial, the driver turns left, into a universe of blue skies, happy faces and rainbow arcs.\n\nThis is what is needed, says the voiceover, good governance and a road to a better life.\n\nNancy Binay, daughter of Vice President Jejomar Binay, offers her smiling promise. Life, she says, will be better with UNA.\n\nUNA is led by Binay, former President Joseph Estrada and Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile, the holy triumvirate of the opposition coalition. They promise “to form and unite their respective forces and resources” to offer the Filipino “a decent and viable alternative leadership.”\n\nIt is difficult to understand just how alternative UNA is, granted that UNA does not have a united platform beyond “alternative.” The UNA camp is composed of rabid nationalists, moderate liberals, with occasional neoliberals thrown in with the socialists and conservatives. Their voting patterns are inconsistent, their opinions splitting on gun issues, dynasties and sin taxes as well as the RH Bill, their policies having little or nothing to do with the political stance of their various leaders. Jack Enrile, for example, who proclaimed himself a supporter of the RH Bill, sin taxes, divorce and same sex marriage, stands on the same campaign stage as his father’s ally Gringo Honasan, who is against sin taxes, says “the institution of marriage is sacred to me,” and argues against divorce, same-sex marriage and the RH bill.\n\nUnity for UNA means Estrada calls on the nation to vote for UNA candidate Mitos Magsaysay, whose stalwart defense of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and her portion of the Arroyo pork barrel linked her to the woman Estrada calls a criminal. Today, Estrada raises Magsaysay’s banner at proclamation rallies, and by his endorsement demonstrates to the public his standards for legislative excellence.\n\nMitos Magsaysay, says Estrada, is “okay.”\n\nThe independents\n\nPoe, daughter of action star Fernando Poe, Jr, goddaughter to Estrada, is perhaps one of the most pointed examples of the lack of party lines across both coalitions. Like Loren Legarda and Escudero, Poe registered as an independent candidate, signed on as an Aquino guest candidate and accepted adoption as an UNA candidate.\n\nShe says the Aquino coalition “is very clear” where it stands—“transparency, honesty in government and credibility—but is unable to differentiate UNA, other than that they stand for the poor. “Somewhat like that.”\n\nShe calls her participation in the Aquino coalition “a serious commitment,” but later adds she could have joined the UNA slate had UNA shown more interest inviting her.\n\n“I’ve hinted at [UNA] so many times. There were many who witnessed it. I hinted that the President is considering me. Maybe they were nervous because I was just a neophyte.”\n\nThat Poe reduces her choice of party loyalty to a question of who called first is an example of just how much value there is in “shared principles.” She has no support system, she said, and she needs as much help as she can get.\n\n“You know what here in our country, there’s hardly any value when it comes to having a political party because people change parties like they would depending on the political weather.”\n\nIn March, UNA announced it was dropping all three common candidates from its slate. The rationale was not principle. It was attendance.\n\n“We wanted all three to win,” says Joseph Estrada says. “I don’t understand the selfishness that deprived us of their presence.”\n\nEscudero went on the defensive immediately after the announcement, claiming he had never believed in political parties and that his only loyalty is to the people. Perhaps he forgot he walked on the same treadmill against the same green walls as the rest of the Aquino slate, in an advertisement paid for and aired by the Aquino coalition.\n\nCobbled by convenience\n\nThe lack of shared principles across the candidate coalitions is not a surprise, particularly in a country that once allowed an action star named Bong Revilla to play guest candidate for four different parties at the same time. What is startling is the party leaders’ persistent claim there is in fact some sort of shared agenda, an imagined unity that the public is told to believe. But there is none, no ideological standard required of party members any more than there are for kindergartners choosing teams in a game dodge ball.\n\nThis is an election where belonging to a party is a function of circumstance and convenience, not principle, not even loyalty. It will be an election where the best scenario will involve a public voting on personality instead of party, as the party cannot be trusted.\n\nIt could be that the leaders have good intentions, perhaps they are naïve or forgiving or willing to offer second chances to erstwhile enemies. Whatever their intentions, the price will be paid by the Filipino, who will discover that promises mean nothing without the unity necessary to enforce agendas on the legislative floor.\n\nThese are not, after all, coalitions of men bound by common principles, or even coalitions of principled men. These are politicians on the campaign treadmill. The direction may seem straightforward, but the road leads to nowhere. – Rappler.com\n\n(A version of this article was published in Esquire Magazine’s May election issue.)"
