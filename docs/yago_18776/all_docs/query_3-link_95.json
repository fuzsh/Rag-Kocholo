        "text": "MIAMI – A superseding indictment was returned today charging Florida residents Bayron Bennett, 33, of Miami, Fausto Villar, a/k/a “Cuba,” 42, of Miami, Avery Bivins, 36, of Miami Gardens, Clementa Johnson, 47, of Tallahassee, Vernon Green, 53, of Miami, Diori Barnard, 47, of Miami, Jerren Keith Howard, a/k/a “Blood,” a/k/a “Omerta Bloody,” 38, of Miami, Michael Jose Dulfo, a/k/a “Mike Dulfo,” a/k/a “Mike D,” 42, of Miami, and Edner Etienne 27, of Miami, for their respective involvement in a campaign to stalk, torment and attempt to kill a victim. If convicted, the defendants face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.\n\nAccording to the court record to include the superseding indictment, since roughly 2022, the victim was subjected to a protracted stalking and attempted murder campaign involving criminal acts to include, multiple arsons, poisonings, an automobile crash, and an instance where contract criminals brandished a firearm in furtherance of a plot to kill the victim. As part of this investigation, law enforcement learned that the scheme against the targeted victim was accompanied by efforts to obstruct justice.\n\nU.S. Attorney Markenzy Lapointe for the Southern District of Florida; Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey B. Veltri of the FBI, Miami Field Office; Special Agent in Charge Deanne L. Reuter of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Miami Field Division; Chief of Police Manuel A. Morales of the Miami Police Department (MPD); Director Stephanie V. Daniels of the Miami-Dade Police Department (MDPD); Special Agent in Charge Felipe Williams of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE); Bureau Chief Darrell Wilson Sr. of the Florida Department of Financial Services, Bureau of Fire, Arson, and Explosives Investigations; Sheriff Michelle Cook of the Clay County Sheriff’s Office; Special Agent in Charge Kristin Rehler of the FBI, Jacksonville Field Office, and Chief of Police Jason Cohen of the Pinecrest Police Department, made the announcement.\n\nU.S. Attorney Lapointe commended the law enforcement agencies involved with this investigation for their efforts and assistance.\n\nThis is an ongoing investigation. Anyone with information is encouraged to call the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI (1-800-225-5324) or file a report at tips.fbi.gov.\n\nSpecial Prosecutions Section Assistant U.S. Attorneys Abbie D. Waxman, Brian Dobbins, and Ignacio J. Vázquez, Jr. are prosecuting this case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Emily Stone is handling asset forfeiture.\n\nAn indictment contains mere allegations, and all defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law.\n\nThis case involves acts of alleged domestic violence. Domestic violence can be physical, sexual, emotional, economic, psychological, or technological actions or threats of actions or other patterns of coercive behavior that influence another person within an intimate partner relationship. This includes any behaviors that intimidate, manipulate, humiliate, isolate, frighten, terrorize, coerce, threaten, blame, hurt, injure, or wound someone. Domestic violence can happen to anyone regardless of race, age, sexual orientation, religion, sex, or gender identity. Domestic violence affects people of all socioeconomic backgrounds and education levels. Domestic violence occurs in both opposite-sex and same-sex relationships and can happen to intimate partners who are married, living together, dating, or share a child. If you or someone you know is in immediate danger because of domestic violence, call 911. For additional assistance and resources call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 800-799-SAFE (7233) or visit https://www.justice.gov/ovw/domestic-violence.\n\nThis case is also part of Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN), a program bringing together all levels of law enforcement and the communities they serve to reduce gun violence and other violent crime, and to make our neighborhoods safer for everyone. On May 26, 2021, the Department launched a violent crime reduction strategy strengthening PSN based on these core principles: fostering trust and legitimacy in our communities, supporting community-based organizations that help prevent violence from occurring in the first place, setting focused and strategic enforcement priorities, and measuring the results. For more information about Project Safe Neighborhoods, please visit https://www.justice.gov/psn.\n\nThis investigation was carried out by members of the FBI’s South Florida Violent Crime and Fugitive Task Force. The Task Force is made up of federal and local law enforcement agencies who cooperatively target the region’s perpetrators of violent criminal offenses and fugitives from justice.\n\nRelated court documents and information may be found on the website of the District Court for the Southern District of Florida at www.flsd.uscourts.gov or at http://pacer.flsd.uscourts.gov under case number 24-cr-20110.\n\n###"
