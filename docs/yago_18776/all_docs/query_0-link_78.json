She argued that the nurses needed to complete their degree; hence there was no need to shut them down.\n\nNurses don't actually need to finish BS Nursing. These nurses only want to become a room nurse or caregivers in America or other countries. They don't need to be that good, said the Senator.\n\nUnfortunately, her comment wasn't well-received by nurses; thus, they demanded an apology from her. On 4th March 2013 here is the apology she twitted.\n\nI sincerely apologize to all the nurses and their families who were hurt by my response to the question I was asked on TV, twitted Cynthia.\n\nCynthia Villar research\n\nIn the recent past, the Senator encountered a public backlash against her comments on the high budget of corn study presented by the Department of Agriculture.

As a result, numerous individuals criticized her disapproval.\n\nThis is what she had to say,\n\nI am not against research; I want the research that can be applied. There should be an application for us to check that our research is worthwhile because if we cannot apply the research, it is just useless. I look at the budget of the DA; it cannot be purely research and no application. I was telling them that if they have a budget divide it - half should be for research, and the other half should be for application and its impact to the farmers. You have to apply research for the benefit or for the good of the people and the agriculture, she remarked.\n\nNet worth\n\nCynthia is one of the wealthiest senators in the Philippines.
