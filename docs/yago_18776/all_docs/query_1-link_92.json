        "text": "How sad that both Herbert “Bistek” Bautista and Monsour del Rosario failed to make it as senators.\n\nFormer Quezon City Mayor Herbert had no less than actress and beauty queen (international, ha) Ruffa Gutierrez as an ardent supporter.\n\nRuffa’s mom, talent manager Annabelle Rama, also supported Bistek’s senatorial bid.\n\nIn the case of Monsour, a taekwondo expert, he got support from his fellow sports enthusiasts and followers.\n\n***\n\nFormer child actor Nash Aguas is now a councilor in Cavite City.\n\nNash was a former member of the children’s show, “Goin’ Bulilit.” He formed a love team with Alexa Ilacad, who is now a singer, songwriter, dancer, host, vlogger and model.\n\nIn the past, Alexa has admitted to have really fallen in love with Nash, who served as her inspiration when she wrote and composed the song, “Paano.”\n\nWell, the two have kept mum about what transpired between them.\n\n***\n\nThe two have their own partners now. Jomari is with Abby Viduya, while Aiko is with Jay Khonghun.\n\nReelected as first district councilor of Paranaque City is actor Jomari Yllana.\n\nJomari was accompanied by girlfriend of several years, actress Abby Viduya, during his proclamation.\n\nMeanwhile, Jomari’s first wife, actress Aiko Melendez, is also a councilor – in Quezon City’s fifth district. She is supported by her boyfriend, newly elected Zambales Representative Jay Khongun.\n\n“He (referring to Congressman Jay Khongun) may be my forever,” Aiko said.\n\nAiko has been married twice. She tied the knot with Martin Jickain after her marriage to Jomari was annulled. She and Jickain have a daughter, Marthena.\n\n***\n\nWe are glad for actor-politician Jinggooy Estrada, who won a seat in the senate.\n\nHis half-brother, JV Ejercito, also seems poised to return to the senate.\n\nJinggoy and JV are, of course, the sons of former President Joseph Estrada from two women. Jinggoy’s mom is Dr. Loi Ejercito, a former senator, while JV’s mom is former actress Guia Gomez, who was a former mayor of San Juan City.\n\nHow the two will behave in the Senate floor, that’s what we should look forward to.\n\nAng bongga, pag nagkataon.\n\n***\n\nRobin Padilla remains on the top spot in the senatorial race, followed by broadcaster Raffy Tulfo.\n\nAntique Representative Loren Legarda is in third place.\n\nWill Mark Villar remain in number four up to the proclamation? Mark’s name only became a byword when he became secretary of the Department of Public Works and Highways during the term of President Duterte.\n\nMark, a former congressman, is the eldest child of businessman Manny Villar and Senator Cynthia Villar. He is married to Emmeline Aglipay, who was also a former congresswoman.\n\nThe couple have a daughter, Emma.\n\n***\n\nWherever he may be, the late Comedy King Dolphy must be truly happy for youngest son Vandolph for again winning a seat in the Paranaque City council.\n\n“Ako, I’m ultra happy for him,” Vandolph’s mom, the still-sexy actress Alma Moreno, said.\n\n“Kasi, isang accomplishment ito. Kinailangan, for one, to earn the trust of the people. Kinailangan din na malaman ng tao na gusto mo talaga silang mapagsilbihan, kaya tumatakbo ka for the position.\n\n“I’m proud of Vandolph. I’m glad I’m his mother,” she happily added.\n\nAn only child, Vandolph was spoiled by both Alma and Dolphy.\n\n“But he never took for granted his studies. Nakita kasi niya ito sa kanyang mga older siblings, lalo kay Eric (Quizon),” continued Alma. “Iminulat din ng mga ito na dapat nagbabasa siya araw araw ng pahayagan para maging aware siya sa nangyayari sa kanyang paligid. O kaya gawing habit na manuod ng balita sa TV.\n\n“Sana, all young people do. Sa paraang ito, magkakaroon tayo ng compassion sa ating kapuwa, na hangad din natin na madama nila para sa kin.\n\n“Pray natin na God be with us always,” the 62-year-old actress further said."
