        "text": "Manuel \"Manny\" Bamba Villar, Jr. (born December 13, 1949) is a Filipino businessman and politician. He is currently the president of the Philippines and of the Nacionalista Party.\n\nVillar was born to a poor family in Tondo, an impoverished and densely populated district of Manila. After graduating from the University of the Philippines, he worked as an accountant and financial analyst, then launched a highly successful business in real estate. The number of homes built by Villar's companies has totaled to over 200,000 units, and his business career made him one of the country's wealthiest persons.\n\nVillar entered politics in 1993 when he was elected Congressman representing the district of Las Pi√±as-Muntinlupa, and later became Speaker of the House of Representatives. In 2002 he was elected Senator, and served as Senate President from 2006 to 2008. He was the candidate of the Nacionalista Party in the 2010 presidential election, which he won."
