        "text": "There are two things that may come as a surprise about Cynthia Villar, the woman most likely to become first lady in the next presidency (her husband’s biggest rival is unmarried).\n\nOne is that it wasn’t her money that built her husband Manny Villar’s real estate empire as is widely believed about the country’s richest senator. Congresswoman Cynthia Aguilar-Villar actually comes from humble beginnings as well. Her grandmother Manuela Aguilar Riguera sold betel nut in the public market of Las Piñas but managed to send her son Filemon Aguilar, Cynthia’s father, to med school. Later, he quit his practice, went into business, and then became a politician.\n\nSecond is that for someone who’s the other half in a partnership that has built close to 200,000 houses for all income classes of Filipinos, Cynthia still prefers to stay in the same property that they purchased 34 years ago — a two-bedroom house in Las Piñas on a 280-square-meter lot. Over the years, of course, the house has been remodeled, renovated and reconfigured many times, one room added here and there — until Cynthia last year got tired of its “train-like appearance kasi dugtong-dugtong,” and did a major renovation to standardize the spaces and make them cohesive. Through three decades, the property has expanded to 5,000 square meters and also now houses a structure they use as an office.\n\nFor the past 18 years that she has been a congresswoman, Cynthia’s projects have focused on the environment and livelihood for women because if there is one thing she believes women should have, it’s financial independence. And what’s more, she has combined these two pressing issues into projects that answer both, like keeping the Las Piñas River clear of coconut husks and water lilies by turning these into nets to cover the slopes of Las Piñas’ hills, blankets, slippers and hampers. The livelihood projects are self-sustaining, started from Cynthia’s initial seeding. That’s how a businessman would do it and that’s how she did it.\n\nThough she admits that she’s had a difficult life and would not want to go through her childhood again, she didn’t have to look far for role models when she was growing up because the women in her family fulfilled that role. “All our mothers and grandmothers are role models,” Cynthia says.\n\nEver since she was young, her working days have been 16 to 18 hours long, and she gets by with only six hours of sleep, and relaxation is a massage and watching TV.\n\nEvery day, she says, she prays for the happiness of her children Paolo, Mark and Camille, and says, almost wistfully, “I hope that they find happiness in their married lives like I did.”\n\nThen there was another role model in her life: Manny Villar, son of a market vendor, who was her classmate at the UP College of Business Administration, later her friend and then her husband. He whom she describes as “a visionary,” a strategist, a man who managed to raise capital each time a financial crisis threatened to dissolve their businesses, and expanding their companies by getting them publicly listed.\n\nAnd to think that for two years of attending the same college in UP, she did not even notice him. In their third year, they became friends and when both were 25 years old they got married.\n\nShe knew he was the one when her father, former Las Piñas Mayor Filemon Aguilar, told her: “He will grow old with you and he will take care of you as you grow old.”\n\nRight from the start Manny struck her as a dependable man. “I’m not a weak person, but I always see that he’s even stronger than me. He’s willing to swallow all his pride just to survive. It’s a very good trait — to be humble and not be proud. He has demonstrated leadership all his life because he was elected House speaker and senate president. It’s easy to be elected by ordinary people, much harder to be elected by your peers. At the same time, he has the character. Remember, he was born very poor.”\n\nManny really wanted to be an entrepreneur, according to Cynthia. His first business was delivering seafood in Makati but when his biggest customer couldn’t pay him he became a salary man again, which he didn’t like. Then he discovered that the canteen that owed him money was operating the canteen at his office. So he negotiated a debt restructuring of sorts: “food chits” in exchange for his receivables.\n\n“The canteen owner probably thought that it would take Manny forever to consume the food chits. But he was very creative. He sold the food chits at 20 percent discount and when he had enough money, he resigned.”\n\nHis next business was delivering gravel and sand. They had two trucks and then it hit him: Why not build houses himself? The Villar couple took out a seven-year loan from a rural bank that offered low interest. And that was how the Villar empire was born: on a four-hectare property. Total number of houses by the Villar companies to date: almost 200,000 units, ranging from the high-end subdivision that is Portofino to Brittany Bay to Camella Homes.\n\n“After 20 years, the company was publicly listed,” Cynthia says. “That was how the company got to be big, from the first IPO. Manny did that three times. The biggest adversity was the 1997 financial crisis, when we saw that our whole life’s work might go down the drain because of the economy. I don’t think the presidency will match that. When you don’t become president, you don’t lose everything. During that time, we might have lost everything.”\n\nCynthia looks at her husband’s candidacy for the presidency with as much practicality as a businesswoman: “It’s just a race. You try to do your best, they try to do theirs. Nothing personal about it.” But she also believes that “public service is really service to the people, especially in a country where 92 percent are poor. The eight percent should not complain anymore.”\n\nOn the role she will play should her husband win, she says, “I don’t relish the thought of being first lady or Manny being president. We don’t even know what will happen to us there. I said, ikukulong yata nila kami doon. I think I will enjoy more being an ordinary person. But as I’ve said, opportunities are being open to you, and you must take them. Otherwise at the end of your life, you will always ask yourself if you made the right decisions. That’s a very difficult position to be in.”\n\nIn the Villar equation, it seems that Cynthia always takes the backseat, the figure behind the man, the wife, the mother — instead of the entrepreneur or the hard worker who built her wealth from scratch. But she was and is one hardworking entrepreneur — she was not the moneyed one that financed her husband’s business, as many people believe. She doesn’t like this myth about her because she thinks that it robs poor people of the dream that it is possible to become big out of nothing. She wants them to know it is possible even without a financier.\n\nThat she remains practical and grounded is perhaps because she was the other half that built the company, that managed the books and the day-to-day operations, that made quick decisions when needed, that attended the PTA meetings of the children and accompanied tem on field trips, and pushed her two boys to study in one of the best business schools in the US.\n\nHere are excerpts from the exclusive Philippine STAR interview that followed a luncheon hosted by Ricky Reyes:\n\n1. What are you most looking forward to if your husband becomes president?\n\nWorking on the country’s health problems. Senators and congress people have endowment in hospitals. If you want to help a person who is sick, you write to the hospital. It’s not that big. Like about 1,500 people approach us every month regarding their health needs, typically dialysis and chemo. The government should b able to provide free treatments. I think this is something I can lobby for.\n\n2. On a more personal level, what are you looking forward to?\n\nI think it will still be work because there’s so much to do.\n\n3. What kind of power should a first lady have?\n\nShe should be to do social work for the people. It shouldn’t be a formal power.\n\n4. You have been to Malacañang Palace many times over the years. Do you like the place?\n\nI haven’t been to the personal quarters of the president, only the public spaces. I would want to live in a simpler place, more pleasant. Nothing too historical.\n\n5. Do you think there is anything you would change in Malacañang? Erap renovated the kitchen before.\n\nHe did the living quarters. He did not live in the main Palace. I think the President is now living in the guesthouse, which is more contemporary. I think that would be nice.\n\n6. Do you have more friends now that your husband is running?\n\nOur friends are more of volunteers now. Eventually they become good friends. My friends are still there, but many are volunteers. We have many groups volunteering. It’s impossible to centralize them and we let them work in groups because it means the individuals like working with each other.\n\n7. Is the family ready to lose if the election doesn’t turn out in your favor?\n\nYes. In fact we have made plans already. We will travel and rest. Later on, Manny can continue with his advocacy. He has many things to do other than the presidency. We have worked all our lives and I have many things to catch up on.\n\n8. You’re like the poster couple for hardworking Filipinos. Wasn’t it hard raising a family and growing a business at the same time?\n\nNo, we have always worked as a family. My children are working with us now. When they were younger, they were always in school. I wanted to give them the best education. Paolo and Mark both went to University of Pennsylvania-Wharton School of Finance, only Camille stayed here, she finished at Ateneo. Di ko siya pinaalis, now whatever she wants to do, I will let her do it kasi kawawa naman. When they were growing up, I was a model mother — I accompanied them to field trips, attended PTA conferences, I supervised them so they could go to the best colleges. I made sure they filled out their application forms and mailed them on time.\n\n9. How would you describe each of your children?\n\nPaolo is the most intelligent. He always had good grades, and high marks in entrance exams, but also very shy. Mark has very good people skills, and loves supporting young Filipino artists. Camille is a natural in a crowd, she likes being with people, she likes working in communications, which she does for our company.\n\n10. Who takes after you the most and after their father?\n\nThey all take after us. Manny loves music and art, which Mark got. Nakuha ba nila ang sipag namin? Camille is a fast thinker like me.\n\n11. What do you and your husband disagree on?\n\nMasyado akong ma-detalye. Every morning, all the messages are written on a sheet of paper and I write down my comments so people would know what to do during the day. Manny wants to have time to discuss, to have coffee. He believes mas importante ang strategy rather than the day-to-day.\n\n12. He’s the big picture, you’re the daily operations?\n\nYes.\n\n13. Was this already the arrangement when you were starting out?\n\nYes. But when you’re small, there really is no big picture (laughs). The big picture is the day-to-day. What can you strategize with two trucks doing the same thing every day?\n\n14. How did your husband pursue you?\n\nWe were classmates in UP, then we became barkada. Mas maganda yata yon, it’s more stable rather than love at first sight.\n\n15. Sino ang mas matalino?\n\nIn college, I didn’t want to study a lot. I had been studying very hard in grade school and high school. I just wanted to pass in college. Manny wasn’t the studious type either; he was a very practical person. I don’t think we really excelled in UP, but we were excelling in our earlier years. I guess we were good in different ways. He really is a visionary. To be able to grow a mom-and-pop operation into a publicly listed company takes vision.\n\n16. Who handled the money in the beginning?\n\nI did. But now it’s the company’s money. At home I was the one who did the budget.\n\n17. You got married at 25.\n\nYes, when we met we were about 18, because we were in third-year college. That’s why he keeps saying 40 years na daw kami. Sabi ko, 34 years pa lang tayo. Huwag mong saabihin yan nagmumukha tayong matanda.\n\n18. If there is one quality of his that made you fall in love, what was it?\n\nDependable, very dependable.\n\n19. You saw that even when you were only 18?\n\nYes. It’s something that you feel about a person. Na hindi ka lolokohin.\n\n20. You grew up in a family of politicians. When your husband first entered politics, what was your reaction?\n\nHe was forced into it because my father was going to retire as mayor of Las Piñas. Manny didn’t want to, but eventually he relented because, he said, “Nakakahiya naman baka sabihin ang yabang ko.” He tried politics and he has never left.\n\n21. After 18 years, is there anything you will miss about being a congresswoman?\n\nI’m on my last term in Congress, so now nobody will call me “Congresswoman Cynthia Villar” anymore. Now you become an ex-congresswoman. I think our lives will be the same. I never changed my life just because I became a congresswoman.\n\n22. What’s your biggest frustration about politics?\n\nThe lack of idealism.\n\n23. You never lost that in 18 years of politics?\n\nNo, never. You have to be an idealist. You will see by my votes in Congress that I tend to be a romantic idealist. My career has been full of idealism.\n\n24. Does your husband share this?\n\nYes, but then I didn’t have to become Speaker of the House or senate president — for that you need to have to be a realist, you have to manage people. Me, I never had that opportunity, so I guess I kept my idealism intact.\n\n25. What was the best advice your father gave you about politics?\n\nIn politics, he said that those who are really hospitable to people remain popular. He was commenting about the fact that I was always hosting for him when he was a mayor because I wanted him to win in the elections.\n\n26. Do you believe in surveys?\n\nIn a certain way, yes. But you have to find also the weakness of a survey. You cannot rely on it totally. You have to take it with some consideration.\n\n27. Does it affect you when you see your husband’s standing going down?\n\nYeah, of course. I’m normal. I’m human. But it’s not something that will affect me for a long time. It’s just a survey.\n\n28. You sound very grounded and calm about a lot of things.\n\nOf course, how can you survive if you’re not? We’ve been in politics for a long time. You have to take care of yourself also, to shield yourself. You should have low expectations so that you will not be disappointed.\n\n29. And yet you’re an idealist still.\n\nOn issues I tend to be idealistic because I can afford to be independent. If you ask me, “Why do you work so hard all your life?” It’s so that when the time comes that I need to make independent decisions, I can make them. What will I get out of all this hard work? Di ba independence? I don’t want to be deprived of that. Even my husband feels the same.\n\n30. As a wife, are you also independent?\n\nI care for my family, but they should also care for me. They should let me do what I want to do.\n\n31. When was your last family vacation?\n\nWe have one every Christmas season, from Dec. 23 to maybe Jan. 10 because Congress is out, and school is out. But we have small family vacations in between. We usually go to Los Angeles. We can just walk, go to a bookstore or coffee shop, watch a movie — nobody knows us. Except now, people recognize Manny.\n\n32. How many personal houses do you own?\n\nWala yata kaming personal except the one where we live. The rest are company houses that they use for planning, etc. Yung lolo ni Manny had a small house in Bataan, which was nasisira na. Inayos nila kasi sabi nung congressman doon nakakahiya bahay ng senador ganyan ang hitsura. I think that house is in our name. It’s an old house built in the 1920s.\n\n33. What’s your reaction to the criticism that the Villars are spending too much on the campaign, how do you hope to recover this?\n\nAs Manny says, of all the candidates, “I’m the only person who’s not in media or a relative of somebody in media.” At a disadvantage na kami, the field is not equal. So you have to make up for that. If they don’t give you free time in media, how do you make yourself known but through infomercials? Others have worked in media all their lives, that’s their investment — as we have worked for our living all our lives in business. And what’s wrong with people knowing him better? Then they can make an intelligent choice. How can they do that if they don’t even know their candidates? Do we have to recover the money? No. Even if we spend some, we earn continuously from our businesses. We have an earning company, so we can afford it.\n\n34. What about the relief goods that had his name and face stamped on the containers?\n\nOur packing materials are all like that. We already had them, so why shouldn’t we use them? Even companies’ packing materials are all like that. Like when I give gifts, of course, they have my name on it and even the recipient would want to know who to thank.\n\nWhen we were starting in business. Manny would be angry when the packaging was shoddy. His analogy was you’re like a beautiful woman in a nice dress and then nakalabas ang half-slip mo. He would point at the packaging of the Japanese and say that it’s important how to present your gift. When it’s packed properly, the recipient feels that you went out of your way to make him feel important. That’s part of our training as good managers and business people. Even our model houses are well made. It’s part of the competition. In business and politics.\n\n35. How does your husband relax?\n\nHe goes to the gym, we have a home gym. Before he used to play billiards, then tennis, never golf because it’s too time consuming. Ako ang may pinaka-maraming equipment in our home gym given by friends, but I never have the time to use them.\n\n36. Who designs your formals?\n\nNolie Hans, who’s my cousin; sometimes Paul Cabral.\n\n37. Do you like that part of your job, the dressing up?\n\nI don’t mind it as long as I have the time.\n\n38. What are people most surprised about you?\n\nThat when they meet me they realize I’m just like them. They think, Cynthia Villar, asawa ni Manny Villar, na sinasabing pinaka-mayamang senador. Sometimes they are so surprised at how simple I am that they don’t even believe it’s me.\n\n39. Do you enjoy stumping?\n\nWhen I’m not too tired, yes. Many of our campaigns are actually programs. We don’t go in and campaign and get out. Even in my district, I do not campaign, I go there to do programs."
