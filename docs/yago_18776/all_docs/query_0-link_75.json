From the high-end market to the middle-income segment; Vista Land operates through various housing projects such as Brittany, Crown Asia, Camella Homes, Communities Philippines, and Vista Residences.\n\nManny Villar used to be involved in politics and was once a congressman, speaker of the house of representatives, senator, and senate president.

Infrastructures will enable connectivity, which facilitates increased trade and investment; improves supply chains; increases private capital productivity; and, ultimately, will help build up the competitive standing of the Philippines when it comes to investment destination. Additionally, more jobs will be created directly and indirectly as businesses flourish and the Philippine economy will become more robust.\n\nAfter his years of service in the Department of Public Works and Highways, he is now currently running for a senatorial position this 2022 and belongs to the senatorial slate of Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban) faction headed by Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi.\n\nCamille Villar\n\nCamille Villar managed to create her own story and build a career that spans both the public and private sectors.
