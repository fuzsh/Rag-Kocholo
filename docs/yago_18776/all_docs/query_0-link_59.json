As Speaker, he presided over the impeachment of President Joseph Estrada by the House of Representatives in 2000. In 2001 he was elected Senator, and served as Senate President from 2006 to 2008. He was the candidate of the Nacionalista Party in the 2010 presidential election, which was won by Benigno Aquino III.\n\nContents\n\n 1 Early life and education  2 Business career o 2 Becoming the richest person in the Philippines  3 Political career o 3 House of Representatives o 3 Senate  4 2010 presidential campaign  5 Offshore leaks  6 Personal life  7 See also  8 References  9 External links\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\n\nManuel Bamba Villar Jr. was born on December 13, 1949 in Tondo, an impoverished and densely populated district of Manila.[8] He was the second-born of the nine children of his parents in a poor family.[3][4][5][6][7][9] His father, Manuel &quot;Maning&quot; Montalban Villar, Sr., was a government employee from Cabatuan, Iloilo who worked as an inspector for the Bureau of Fisheries.[4][8] His mother, Curita &quot;Curing&quot; Bamba, was a seafood vendor from a poor family in Orani, Bataan.[4] The family lived in a small rented apartment in a run down slum area.[6] Villar's father was eventually granted a year-long scholarship for higher education in the United States, which led to a job promotion to a director position in the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources upon his return.[3] Due to cramped conditions in Tondo, Villar's father obtained a P16,000 loan from the Government Service Insurance System, payable in 20 to 25 years, to build a home in San Rafael Village, Navotas.[7] As a child, Villar initially attended Isabelo delos Reyes Elementary School, a nearby public school in Tondo.[10] He also assisted his mother in selling shrimp and fish at the Divisoria Public Market, as early as age six, in order to help earn the money to support his siblings and himself to school.[4][8] However, accompanying his mother interfered with his education and he was forced to drop out from school during Grade 1.[10] He was then enrolled at Tondo Parochial School (later renamed Holy Child Catholic School), a private school in Tondo run by priests, to complete his elementary education.[10]\n\nVillar finished his high school education at the Mapúa Institute of Technology in Santa Cruz, adjacent to Tondo.[11] He attended the University of the Philippines - Diliman and earned his bachelor's degree in business administration in 1970.[11] He returned to the same school to earn his master's degree in business administration in 1973.[11] He later characterized himself as being impatient with formal schooling, and eager to start working and go into business.[6]\n\nBusiness career[edit]\n\nAfter obtaining his bachelor's degree, Villar began his professional career working as an accountant for Sycip, Gorres, Velayo &amp; Co. (SGV &amp; Co), the country's largest accounting firm.[11] He resigned from SGV &amp; Co. to start his first business, delivering seafood in Makati.[9] However, when his largest customer was unable to pay him, he negotiated a debt restructuring of sorts, selling discounted meal tickets to office workers in exchange for receivables.[5] He then worked briefly as a financial analyst for the Private Development Corporation of the Philippines, where his job was to sell World Bank loans.[4][8] Wanting to start a business of his own again, he quit his job and availed of one of the loans, which offered attractive rates.[4]\n\nIn 1975, with an initial capital of 10,000, Villar pu₱ rchased two reconditioned trucks and started a business delivering sand and gravel for construction companies in Las Piñas.[6] [9] This eventually segued into building houses, as Villar took out a seven-year loan from\n\na rural bank offering low interest rates.[5] From the loan, he kick-started building and selling homes at his first project, Camella Homes Phase 1 and 2 in Las Piñas,[12] initially with 160 units and would have resulted to be the country's largest home building company, with an emphasis on low-priced mass housing.[8] A notable innovation of Villar's companies was to sell house and lot packages, when the common practice at the time was to sell lots for future homeowners to build upon.[9] He initiated mass housing projects through economies of scale, utilizing the cost advantages of developing a large-scale project in order to bring down housing prices.[9] The number of homes built by Villar's companies totaled to over 200,000 units.[5]\n\nIn the 1980s, Villar established Prime Water to operate and maintain water distribution systems throughout the country. It counts a 25-year partnership with the municipality of Daraga to deliver bulk water, a 25-year joint venture agreement with Lingayen Water District in Pangasinan, and a 25-year joint agreement with the Leyte Metropolitan Water District[13] among its 30 water projects with local water districts. The Commission on Audit flagged Prime Water’s operations in Guagua, Pampanga due to high levels of arsenic in the commission's 2018 annual report.[14] The company produces over 170 million liters of treated water daily, supplied by more than 250 deep wells and surface water resources, and is directly involved in delivering water to more than 150, households across the Philippines.[15] Now under the Villar Group of companies, the water utility firm is led by their eldest son, Paolo.[16]\n\nIn 1984, he founded Golden Haven Memorial Park, a chain of cemeteries in the Philippines, started with its first branch in Las Pinas and expanded in Cebu, Cagayan De Oro, Zamboanga, Bulacan, and Iloilo. It will also expanded into the businesses of memorial chapel, crematorium and columbarium.[17]\n\nMakabayang Masang Pilipino (LAMMP) coalition in order to hasten the process of impeachment.[26] Seconds after the opening prayer, and skipping the traditional roll call, he immediately read a resolution sending the impeachment case to the Senate for trial, bypassing a full vote and ignoring attempts by Estrada allies to delay the proceedings.[25]\n\nHours after the impeachment proceedings, congressmen allied with the president led a move to oust Villar from his post as speaker, replacing him with Camarines Sur representative Arnulfo Fuentebella, an ally of President Estrada.[25]\n\nIn 2001, barred by constitutional term limits from seeking re-election to a fourth term in the House of Representatives, Villar was succeeded by his wife, Cynthia Villar.\n\nSenate [edit]\n\nVillar ran for Senator in the 2001 election. Having recently resigned from Estrada's LAMMP coalition, he ran for Senator as an independent politician, but campaigned as a member of the People Power Coalition, the administration coalition party which was supportive of the recent 2001 EDSA Revolution. He was elected to the Senate with more than 11 million votes, ranking seventh out of 37 candidates.[27] He later won re- election in 2007, running as a member of the Genuine Opposition coalition, ranking fourth out of 37 candidates.[8]\n\nIn July 2006, Villar was chosen Senate President, making him the first post-World War II public official to head both the House of Representatives and the Senate.[8] He had previously held the position of Senate President pro tempore, as well as the chairmanship of the Committees on Finance, Foreign Relations, Public Order, and Committee on Agriculture and Fisheries.[8]\n\nIn November 2008, Villar lost the support of the Senate majority, due to alleged fabricated accusations thrown on him by political enemies on the C5 project. He then resigned as President of the Senate and was succeeded by Juan Ponce Enrile [28] who later on investigated Villar for C5 scam.[29]\n\n2010 presidential campaign[edit]\n\nMain article: 2010 Philippine presidential election\n\nVillar was a candidate for President of the Philippines in the May 2010 presidential election, as the standard bearer of the Nacionalista Party. He filed his certificate of candidacy for president on November 30, 2009, along with his running mate, Senator Loren Legarda.[30] His popular campaign line was &quot;Sipag at Tyaga&quot; (Hardwork and Patience). Villar's campaign platform includes combating poverty and corruption, two major problems between which he believes there is a strong link.[31]\n\nAccording to a January 2010 survey by polling firm Pulse Asia and the February 2010 survey from Social Weather Stations, Villar was statistically tied in the lead with his main rival in the election, Senator Benigno Aquino III.[32] In a March survey rival Aquino had regained a significant nine-point lead.[33] Other significant rivals in the presidential race included former President Joseph Estrada and former Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, opinion columnist William Esposo claimed that Villar has lied in his TV ads and could not have been poor because his younger brother Danny was admitted to FEU Hospital, which he claims was a top hospital at the time and in 1962, there was no bone marrow transplantation and chemotherapy yet and everyone whether rich or poor died from contracting leukemia.[34] Villar clarified that his brother was admitted as a charity patient, because the family was unable to afford treatment. Any family member, who is on the verge of death, will definitely be brought to the nearest possible hospital to try and save him, regardless of their status in life.[7]\n\nVillar placed third in the election, behind Senator Noynoy Aquino and former President Joseph Estrada. On May 11, 2010, a day after the election, Villar was among the first to concede to Aquino.\n\nOffshore leaks[edit]\n\nDuring the ICIJ's (International Consortium of Investigative Journalists) report of Offshore leaks in April 2013, his name appeared on the list of businessmen with offshore accounts. It was revealed that Villar owned an account in the British Virgin Islands.[35]\n\n&quot;The ICIJ investigation, of which PCIJ was part, found that Villar is the beneficial owner of a BVI international business corporation called Awesome Dragon Holdings Limited,&quot; said an ABS-CBN article. [36]\n\nVillar has not denied ownership of Awesome Dragon, and no evidence of any wrongdoing has been found.\n\nPersonal life[edit]\n\nIn his third year of college at the University of the Philippines, Villar became friends with Cynthia Aguilar, his classmate in the UP College of Business Administration.[5] Her father was then mayor of Las Piñas City. They married at the age of 25.[5] They have three children: Paolo (born c. 1977), eldest child and first of two sons; Mark (born 1978); second of two sons; and Camille Linda (born c. 1985), youngest child and only daughter.[18][37] Villar's two sons studied at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania for their college education, while Camille attended Ateneo de Manila University for her undergraduate degree and IESE Business School for her MBA in 2013.[5] All three children graduated with degrees in finance or business management. [37] Mark is a former Representative of Las Piñas City and the current DPWH secretary,\n\nwhile Camille is the current Representative of Las Piñas City and a former co-host of Wil Time Bigtime and Wowowillie.\n\nVillar lives in a two-bedroom house with his family in Las Piñas City.[5] In early 2010, a political smear was disseminated on the Internet, claiming falsely that Villar owned an extravagant mansion in the United States, which was debunked by Snopes.[38]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n &quot;Naging Mahirap&quot;, Villar's jingle for his 2010 presidential campaign"
