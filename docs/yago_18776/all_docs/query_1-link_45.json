        "text": "Valentine's Day is an important day for lovers in its own right.\n\nSome couples, however, took it to the next level by making Feb. 14 their wedding day. What's more befitting than making a lifetime commitment on the day of love?\n\nHere are some local celebrities who decided to tie the knot on Feb. 14—for a lifetime of love and an everyday celebration of Valentine's Day.\n\nHeart Evangelista and Chiz Escudero\n\nHeart Evangelista, who’s also celebrating her birthday on Valentine’s Day, married Chiz Escudero in a church ceremony in 2015 on Balesin Island in Polilio, Quezon Province.\n\nTheir principal sponsors include GMA Network Chairman and CEO Felipe Gozon, President and Chief Operating Officer Gilberto Duavit Jr., and Congressman Gilberto Duavit Sr., 24 Oras anchor Mel Tiangco, Viva Entertainment boss Vic Del Rosario, and actors Susan Roces, Eddie Garcia, and Jackie Lou Blanco.\n\nCelebrity guests included Lovi Poe, Solenn Heusaff, and Carla Abellana.\n\nOn their ninth anniversary, Heart and Chiz renewed their vows in the same venue in an intimate ceremony.\n\nKryz Uy and Slater Young\n\nKryz Uy and Slater Young got married on Valentine’s Day in an intimate church wedding at the Archdiocesan Shrine of the Sacred Heart Parish in their hometown Cebu.\n\nA resort wedding ceremony and reception followed on Feb. 16 at Shangri-La Mactan Resort and Spa.\n\nThe content creator and Pinoy Big Brother winner’s big day had a floral theme with mostly white hues.\n\nSome of their celebrity guests included PBB alumnus Sam Milby and Cornerstone Entertainment producer Erickson Raymundo.\n\nKryz and Slater now have three children.

Cynthia Villar, her husband, former senator Manny Villar, Dr. Vicky Belo, and Hayden Kho.\n\nGuests included Alodia’s fellow content creators like Cong TV, Camille Co, and Laureen Uy.\n\nThe gaming icon’s wedding included the Manila Philharmonic Orchestra’s rendition of Final Fantasy VII’s battle theme.\n\nAlodia on Instagram shared an artwork of her and her husband with the caption, “Love is our greatest adventure, and every day with you feels like Valentine’s Day.”\n\n“my forever duo in game and IRL,” she added."
