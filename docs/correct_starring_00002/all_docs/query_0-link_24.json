It is such a fuck for me, that I only know the films name in german. You wrote, Snake in monkeys shaow. i saw a movie called, Die Schlange im Schatten des Adlers (=Snake in eagleÃ‚Â´s shadow) is this the same movie? with Jacky Chan?\n\nMaybe Seb will make somstimes a list with translation for people like me…\n\n[quote]Vic!

You wrote, Snake in monkeys shaow. i saw a movie called, Die Schlange im Schatten des Adlers (=Snake in eagleÃ‚Â´s shadow) is this the same movie? with Jacky Chan? [/quote]\n\nYes, the title I gave is an alternate title for that movie. It is a Jackie Chan movie, directed by Yuen Woo Ping.\n\nVic u are a diamond thanx for the list + the link to KB influential movies page it has saved me a lot of time and research and money (tired of buying those dvd box sets with one good/nine rubbish) in my quest for best kung fu movies ever.\n\nyakuzanerd/speedgeekjerk\n\n“Shaolin Master Killer” also known as “36th Chamber of Shaolin”… and there are 3 sequels to it… all starring Gordon Liu… I liked specially the “The Disciples of the 36th Chamber” sequel (this crazy Monk fights the other Monks and becomes a Monk…)…\n\nShaolin Versus Wu-Tang\n\nthanks theese lists are so awesome… one can really watch days worth of fun action-packed movies… thanks Tarantino…\n\ncool Jet_Set!\n\nI got One Armed Boxer 2 and I was afraid that was like guillotine 2… but it being Guillotine 1 now I know it’s the same movie Tarantino says is kick-ass fun and inspiration…\n\n[quote]Guys what about Kuan Tai Chen’s Iron Monkey (Tie ma liu)!?! One of the best Kung Fu movies and as it’s one of QT’s favs I’m sure it influenced him hugely somewhere along the road of making Kill Bill…\n\nP.S. Great topic YakuzaNerd[/quote]\n\nthere are two versions, one from 93 with that donny guy, and one form way back.\n\nWell been finding and seeing the recommended above movies :Iron Monkey great for fight scenes and photography a blueprint of what the Once upon a time in china 1 and 2 were going to top.\n\nShaolin Temple early Jet Li while he was still Wushu peking athlete?\n\nDiscovered Princess Blade(referenced on imdb) having seen it a week after KB 1 well sorry to say but once all the hype put aside i favour it!(fights choreographed by …Donnie Yen !!)"
