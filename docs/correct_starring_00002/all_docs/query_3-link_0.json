        "text": "Chinese martial arts film actor (born 1955)\n\nFor the Chinese-American politician (劉貴明), see Gordon J. Lau.\n\nGordon Liu (Lau Kar-fai simplified Chinese: 刘家辉; traditional Chinese: 劉家輝; pinyin: Liú Jiāhuī; Wade–Giles: Liu Chia-hui; Jyutping: Lau4 Gaa1 fai1); born Sin Kam-hei (simplified Chinese: 冼锦熙; traditional Chinese: 冼錦熙; pinyin: Xiǎn Jǐnxī, 22 August 1951)[2] is a Chinese actor and martial artist.\n\nBorn in Guangdong, Liu studied hung ga kung fu at the school founded by Lau Kar-leung’s father, Lau Cham.[3] He entered the Hong Kong film industry as a stuntman. His early acting credits include minor roles in several Hong Kong kung fu films, including the Shaw Brothers-produced 5 Shaolin Masters (1974). He went on to appear in many Shaw Brothers films, such as Challenge of the Masters (1976), in which he portrayed the folk hero Wong Fei Hung, Executioners From Shaolin (1977), The 36th Chamber of Shaolin (1978), in which he played the lead role as Shaolin hero San Te, Dirty Ho (1979), Return to the 36th Chamber (1980), Martial Club (1981), The Eight Diagram Pole Fighter (1984), and Disciples of the 36th Chamber (1985). By the late-1980’s, he had begun accepting smaller roles, such as in Lau Kar-leung's Tiger on the Beat (1988).\n\nLiu made his American debut in 2003. He played two roles in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill films: Johnny Mo, the leader of the Crazy 88 yakuza gang in Volume 1 (2003), and kung fu master Pai Mei in Volume 2 (2004).\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nLiu was born Sin Kam-hei in Guangdong Province, China on 22 August 1951, prior to his adoption into another family.[4] He is often wrongly cited as being the adopted son of Lau Cham, and adoptive brother of directors and actors Lau Kar-leung (Liu Chia-liang) and Lau Kar-wing (Liu Chia-Yung). He was not adopted by the family but is Lau Cham's godson.[5]\n\nIn his youth (ages 15–20), he skipped school to train in Chinese martial arts without his parents' knowledge. He trained at Lau Cham's martial arts school of Hung Gar discipline, which descended from Wong Fei-hung's grand student (father to Lau Kar Leung). Lau Cham's wife assisted in his training and due to the friendship and respect Liu felt for Lau and his wife, he took on the name Lau Ka-fai. As he grew up, he found a job as a shipping clerk to make ends meet. His interests had always been towards martial arts and he was eventually offered a role by Lau Kar-leung.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nLiu's first break was with Chang's Film Company (a Shaw Brothers subsidiary operating in Taiwan) acting small parts for such films as 5 Shaolin Masters, Shaolin Martial Arts, and 4 Assassins. He starred in Challenge of the Masters (1976), as the folk hero Wong Fei Hung, and was featured in Executioners From Shaolin (1977) before starring in his signature role as Shaolin hero San Te in The 36th Chamber of Shaolin.\n\nThe tale of the imperialistic struggle, while not a new one, was significant for the intense focus placed on the inner workings of Shaolin Temple itself. San Te, Liu's character, overcomes the temple's thirty-five chambers as he unwittingly undergoes the rigorous training regimen imposed by the temple's Head Abbott on the pretext of \"earning\" a right to study martial arts there.\n\nThe \"zero-to-hero\" tale turned Liu into an international icon in spite of a frame far slighter than that of the folk hero himself (known as \"Iron Arms\" for the muscularity of his physique) and paved the way for a very healthy working schedule into the mid-1990s, even as younger, more agile martial artists eventually emerged. By the late 1980s, he had begun accepting smaller roles, such as in Lau Kar-leung's Tiger on the Beat.\n\nLiu has also been active in television, and was contracted to Hong Kong's TVB company for many years, continuing playing roles as a martial arts master. Though still performing some martial arts roles, he is at home as well in comedic, self-deprecatory or emotional characters. His second-most common role in TVB has been playing a Hong Kong Police Force officer[citation needed].\n\nQuentin Tarantino had long been a fan of Liu, and hoped to find him a role in one of his movies. This eventually came to pass with the roles of Johnny Mo and Master Pai Mei in Tarantino's Kill Bill films. His roles in Kill Bill raised Liu's profile again and a renewed interest was shown by Chinese producers; since Kill Bill, Liu has returned to doing movies while continuing to do television for Hong Kong's TVB station.\n\nIn 2008, Liu added a Bollywood film to his profile. Collaborating with Indian actor Akshay Kumar who is a top-billed Bollywood actor and also a martial arts performer in a film titled Chandni Chowk To China (CC2C). He played the role of the villain, Hojo, a smuggler and a well-trained martial artist. Before this, he appeared as himself (along with his mentor Lau Kar Leung) in the 2009 film Dragonland, the first Italian documentary about martial cinema history, by Lorenzo De Luca. Liu attended as special guest star at the premiere in Rome, meeting his Italian fans for the first time. During August 2011, Liu had a stroke and put all his plans on hold to recover. Liu had cancelled all public engagements as of March 2012.[6]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nLiu has been married twice. He has two daughters, Angie and Bonnie, from his first marriage which ended in 1986, and a son Kris (冼峻龙) and daughter Sonia (冼咏珊) from his second marriage with Ma Fei-feng (马飞凤) of Thai-descent which ended in 2009.\n\nIn August 2011, while in To Kwa Wan performing with his band, Liu had a stroke and hit his head. He had partial right-sided paralysis and a speech impairment as a consequence of the stroke, needing a wheelchair to travel. At the same time, his estranged family from his second marriage had begun pressuring him for money. Depressed at his physical state and family complications, he isolated himself in a nursing home. In June 2012, Liu decided to divorce his second wife and focus on his recovery.[7]\n\nDuring his medical crisis, Liu entrusted his assets to his assistant and spokesperson, Eva Fung. However, the two fell out, and Fung refused to return his assets.[8] Subsequently in 2013, he arranged for Hong Kong actress Amy Fan to become the legal guardian of his assets.[9] Liu later took legal action to recover his assets, and on April 29, 2014, a day before the court date, Fung agreed to return them with interest. In 2015, it was reported that he no longer spoke with a slur but continued to use a wheelchair, and that he had resided at a nursing home for several years.[10]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1973 Hero of the Waterfront Extra The Hero of Chiu Chow 1974 5 Shaolin Masters Chang Yung Cameo Shaolin Martial Arts Ho Chen-kang 1975 The Four Assassins Aburiha / Abulahua Marco Polo The Monk Foon Ying's Thug / Monk Brief Appearance 1976 Challenge of the Masters Wong Fei-hung 7-Man Army Mongolian Commander #2 Boxer Rebellion Boxer Bloody Avengers 1977 He Has Nothing But Kung Fu Shang Kai-Yuan (as Chia-Fai Liu) Stunt Coordinator Executioners from Shaolin Tung Chien-chin (Tong Qianjin) 1978 Breakout from Oppression Hsiao Tu (Tsao Chan) Director, Action Coordinator The 36th Chamber of Shaolin Liu Yu-de / Monk San Te Heroes of the East Ah To Shaolin Mantis Shaolin Fighting Monk (Guest Star) Brief Appearance 1979 Fury in the Shaolin Temple Dirty Ho Wang Tsun Hsin (11'th Prince) The Shadow Boxing Chang Chieh Spiritual Boxer Sequel 1980 Clan of the White Lotus Hong Wen-Ting Return to the 36th Chamber Chao Jen-Cheh Fists and Guts Ah-San / Shaolin Priest Shaolin Warrior Fa Tien Producer 1981 My Young Auntie James Elders Shaolin and Wu Tang Director The Shaolin Drunken Monk Lao Chung Treasure Hunters Monk Mo Seung Martial Club Wong Fei-hung 1982 Raiders of Shaolin Kung Fu Ga-wi Yu Legendary Weapons of China Ti Tan (Guest Star) Godfather of Canton Lin Si Hai The 82 Tenants Ah Hui Cat vs Rat Emperor Yung Hsi (Guest Star) 1983 Lady Is the Boss Lee Hon Man (Ah Man) Shaolin and Wu Tang Hung Yung-Kit Tales of a Eunuch Emperor Kang Hsi / Siu Yuen Tzu 1984 The Eight Diagram Pole Fighter Yang Wu-lang (Fifth Brother) 1985 Two Jolly Cops Lo Tak-Fai Producer The Young Vagabond So Chan Disciples of the 36th Chamber Monk San Te Crazy Shaolin Disciples Monk Wu Ching USA Ninja Action Director 1986 The Story of Dr. Sun Yat Sen 1988 Legend of the Phoenix Tiger on the Beat Fai, The Hitman A Bloody Fight Inspector Lau Fai Peackock King Kubira Shaolin vs. Vampire Hyo Daiyu (as Ryu Chafi) Director Let's Rage the Gangland 1989 A Fiery Family Wei Fury of a Tiger Rambo / Sergeant Mang Action Choreographer White Lotus Trio Avenging Trio My Heart Is That Eternal Rose Lai Liu Ghost Ballroom Chai Killer Angels Michael 1990 Tiger on the Beat 2 Lau Fai The Fortune Code Japanese Commander in Blue 1991 The Killer Inspector Wong Crystal Hunt Officer Lung China Heat The Banquet Brief Appearance A Fate of Love The Story of the Gun Officer Lau Fai Guns of the Master Killer 1992 Passionate Killing in the Dream Chit-Chit Cheetah on Fire Mainland Gang Leader (as Ka Fai Lau) Cry Killer Martial Art Director 1993 Flirting Scholar Evil Scholar Last Hero in China Master Liu Heung (as Ka-fai Lau) Legend of the Liquid Sword Shaolin Monk (Guest) (as Ka-fai Lau) Cameo The Buddhism Palm Strikes Back For-wan Tse-san The Mystery of the Condor Hero Yuen-tsan Bogus Cops Hood 1994 The Kung Fu Scholar His Excellency Drunken Master III Governor Lee (as Kar Fai Lau) American Shaolin Abbot Hung Chi Treasure Hunt If You Were Here Mr. Chiang Stunt Coordinator Funny Shaolin Kids Two Shaolin Kids in Hong Kong 1995 Lethal Girls 2 1997 Super Cops Uncle Shing Action Coordinator 1998 Thunder Scout 1999 The Set Up Heaven of Hope Coffin Leung Generation Consultant Lieutenant Chow Generation Pendragon Gambler Series: Fraudelent Culture 2000 The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber Sing Kwan The Legend of Lady Yang Chan Yuen-lai The Island Tales Bo 2002 Drunken Monkey Detective Hung Yat Fu 2003 Star Runner Master Lau (Coach Lau) Kill Bill: Volume 1 Johnny Mo 2004 Kill Bill: Volume 2 Johnny Mo / Pai Mei Shaolin vs. Evil Dead Pak / Brother White Dragon in Fury Snake Curse Dr. Gao Er 2005 Dragon Squad Ko (Police Driver) Dragon Heat A Chinese Tall Story Jade Emperor Insuperable Kid Japanese Ambassador Dragon Get Angry 2006 Katana-Man Mr. 3 Minutes Triad Head (Mahjong Debt Collector) Hung Kuen vs. Wing Chun Liu Chiaoxi My Kung Fu Sweetheart 2007 Shaolin Vs.
