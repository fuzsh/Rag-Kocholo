        "text": "I'm a Tarantino fan; nonetheless, I did not like Volume 1. Secondly, because of their vast differences in direction and intensity, it's rather surreal to think of V1 and V2 as a single production, though apparently this was their origin. Lastly, I did like Volume 2 - liked it very much. At times, it approached the brilliance of \"Pulp Fiction.\"\n\nGone are the buckets of splattering blood that so riddled V1. Instead, a greater attention to awkward tension, clever builds, clever dialogue (for the most part) and stylish production that makes sense to the overall goal. Unlike the first, where cinematic powerful scenes are rare, in the second, weak scenes are rare. And even these weak scenes could have been saved with a little editing. (Some of the verbiage goes long, and there's one too many \"this is how I'm going to kill you\" bad guy lectures.) These imperfections rob V2 of being a truly great film.\n\nIt's fun to see Carradine back in form and in the genre (playing the bamboo flute, no less). He's quite likeable as Bill, intelligent, warm, sensitive, with the ability to turn deathly violent in the wink of an eye. Tarantino' cocky pizzazz delivers this unique story in his unique ironic-violent-comedy-action genre, while poking some respectful fun at the Martial Arts genre in general.\n\nThe burial scene in particular is very well constructed. Further cinematic dynamics combined with a commanding score and strong acting make V2 a very good movie going experience.\n\nAnd of course, a great deal of answers are provided to lingering questions. Still, I think V2 nearly stands on it's own. With just a paragraph summary from the first film you'll be prepped and ready.\n\nI so did not enjoy V1 that I was ready to pass on V2; I'm glad I decided to see it.\n\n(This film viewed at a .)"
