        "text": "Tarantino's two-part epic Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2 has changed platforms once again--the movies have left Netflix and are now streaming on Hulu, as of April 2020. We know you're going to rewatch these classics, so watch out for these tidbits when you do. Check out our gallery Kill Bill: Vol. 1 Easter eggs as well.\n\nWhen watching Kill Bill: Vol. 2, the second half of Quentin Tarantino's kung fu meets spaghetti Western epic, it quickly becomes apparent that this is an entirely different kind of film from Vol. 1. Whereas Vol. 1 favors quick edits, Vol. 2 drags moments out. Where Vol. 1 punctuates its founts of blood with quippy one-liners, the victims in Vol. 2 bleed more realistically, and the comedy is more situational.\n\nVol. 2 is Tarantino working at a languid pace, letting his characters mosey along to their destinations. Perhaps they mosey a bit too much if we view Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 as two separate films. But together, the two halves of Kill Bill complement one another. If Vol. 1 is about the deliberateness of revenge and the single-minded pursuit of it, Vol. 2 is about its complications and intricacies, and the ways that guilt catches up with its perpetrators and victims."
