It was originally scheduled to be released on February 20, 2004 but was rescheduled. \"Variety\" posited that the delay was to coincide its theatrical release with \"Volume 1\"'s release on DVD.[2] In the United States and Canada, \"Volume 2\" was released in 2,971 theaters and grossed $25.1 million on its opening weekend,[3] ranking first at the box office and beating fellow opener \"The Punisher\". \"Volume 2\"'s opening weekend gross was higher than \"Volume 1\"'s, and the equivalent success confirmed the studio's financial decision to split the film into two theatrical releases.[4] \"Volume 2\" attracted more female theatergoers than \"Volume 1\", with 60% of the audience being male and 56% of the audience being men between the ages of 18 to 29 years old. \"Volume 2\"'s opening weekend was the largest to date for Miramax Films aside from releases under its arm Dimension Films. The opening weekend was also the largest to date in the month of April for a film restricted in the United States to theatergoers 17 years old and up, besting \"Life\"'s record in 1999. \"Volume 2\"'s opening weekend was strengthened by the reception of \"Volume 1\" in the previous year among audiences and critics, abundant publicity related to the splitting into two volumes, and the DVD release of \"Volume 1\" in the week before \"Volume 2\"'s theatrical release.[5]"
