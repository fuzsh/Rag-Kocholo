In part 1 of Quentin Tarantino's delirious revenge movie, The Bride seeks vengeance on those who massacred her wedding party... Inspired by countless Japanese swordplay actionfests, yakuza gangster thrillers, and Chinese martial arts movies, Quentin Tarantino borrows from the best in order to shape his deliciously over-the-top cinematographic style into a simple but effective plot.
