One of the premiere superstars of old school Shaolin-style martial arts cinema, Gordon Chia-hui Liu has been a household name in Asia for nearly thirty years. This bald-headed, sharp-featured Hong Kong legend broke into movies in the early 1970's, first as a stuntman, then as a martial-arts choreographer.
