Nanavati ,\n\nWrong Details updated\n\nIf youâll are giving the platform number, either give the correct platform number or just donât give one at all. I checked time for AC train from Vasai Road to Churchgate on your app. It said 4.33 AC local from platform no 5, and informed my parents accordingly, and the train came to platform no 3. We wasted our money on tickets we couldnât utilise at all.\n\nEither give true platform number, or just donât give any detail at all, please donât put up wrong information at least.\n\nGenuinely disappointed this time.\n\nmitesh_z ,\n\nApp crashed frequently on IOS\n\nThe Mindicator app has been incredibly helpful for Mumbai commuters, providing valuable information and updates. However, recently, the app has been crashing frequently on iOS devices, which is frustrating. It was working fine for about 10-15 days, but now itâs become quite unreliable.\n\nWhen it works, the app is nothing short of amazing, offering useful features and real-time information. Itâs undoubtedly one of the most helpful apps for commuters in Mumbai. However, itâs essential that the developers pay attention to the frequent crashes and work on seamless integration for iOS users.\n\nOnce the app is stable and free from crashes, it will be a top-notch tool for commuters. Iâm hopeful that the developers will address these issues and improve the appâs performance for iOS users, making it even more valuable and user-friendly."
