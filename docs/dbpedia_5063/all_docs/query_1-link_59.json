        "text": "ETGovernment\n\nPublished On Nov 23, 2020 at 10:35 AM IST\n\nRead by: 100 Industry Professionals\n\nRead by 100 Industry Professionals\n\nWith a focus on making Mumbai suburban stations less congested to allow for social distancing, the Mumbai Rail Vikash Development (MRVC) is all set to redesign 19 stations in both Central Railway (CR) and Western Railway (WR) regions.\n\nAccording to a press statement released by MRVC, “It has received approval from the Railway Board for a Rs 947-crore revamp of 19 suburban stations – 11 on the Central Railway (CR) and 8 on the Western Railway (WR). MRVC has already started the redesign of a few of these stations for a complete makeover looking at the social distancing aspect of Covid-19 pandemic.”\n\nAdvt\n\nMRVC had received approval for the makeover of 14 of the 19 stations during the Covid-19 lockdown and they were doing the paperwork for the multi-crore project, it added.\n\nThe 19 stations are Bhandup, Mulund, Kasara, GTB Nagar, Chembur, Govandi, Mankhurd, Neral, Shahad, Thane and Dombivali on the Central Railway; and Mumbai Central, Khar, Jogeshwari, Kandivali, Bhayander, Mira Road, Vasai and Nallasopara on the Western Railway, the statement informed.\n\nThe redesign model will be mainly looking at remodeling of smaller stations which have remained congested during the lockdown even though local trains haven’t open to all. The scope of work will be widening the entrance and exit of stations and shifting ticket counters, food stalls and other amenities to the upper deck, the statement read.\n\nThe revamp of the 19 stations is part of the Rs 33,690-crore Mumbai Urban Transport Project-3A which will augment the suburban rail system, especially in the northern suburbs and across the wider Mumbai Metropolitan Region, the statement said.\n\nMRVC has awarded consultancies for architectural planning and environmental and social impact assessment, and has invited expressions of interest for a detailed design engineering consultancy. The process was delayed because of Covid-19, but most of the concept plans have been approved, it added.\n\nJoin the community of 2M+ industry professionals\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.\n\nDownload ETGovernment App\n\nGet Realtime updates\n\nSave your favourite articles"
