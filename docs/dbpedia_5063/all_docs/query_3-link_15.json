        "text": "Mumbai's long-awaited AC trains are finally here. You can now travel from Churchgate to Borivali and Virar in air-conditioned bliss. Here's a lowdown on the ticket prices and timings:\n\nMumbai AC local train timings\n\nBorivali - Churchgate: 7.54 - 8.50\n\nVirar - Churchgate: 10.22 - 11.46\n\nVirar - Churchgate: 13.18 - 14.44\n\nVirar - Churchgate: 16.22 - 17.42\n\nBorivali - Churchgate: 18.55 - 19.44\n\nVirar - Churchgate: 21.24 - 22.48\n\nMahalaxmi - Borivali: 6.58 - 7.50\n\nChurchgate - Virar: 8.54 - 10.13\n\nChurchgate - Virar: 11.50 - 13.05\n\nChurchgate - Virar: 14.55 - 16.12\n\nChurchgate - Borivali: 17.49 - 18.41\n\nChurchgate - Virar: 19.49 - 21.15\n\nNote: All trains, except Mahalaxmi - Borivali, will operate as 'fast' trains, and will run only on weekdays, with Saturday and Sundays reserved for maintenance.\n\nWhich stations does the AC local halt at?\n\nThe air-conditioned train halts at Churchgate, Mumbai Central, Dadar, Bandra, Andheri, Borivali, Bhayander, Vasai and Virar. From November 1, the AC local is likely to also halt at seven more railway stations: Marine Lines, Charni Road, Grant Road, Dahisar, Mira Road, Naigaon, Nallasopara. Perhaps to make up for the additional journey time, the top speed of the train will be bumped up from 70km/hr to 90km/hr.\n\nMumbai AC local train fare\n\nAs you'd expect, passengers have to shell out premium fare for the AC experience. Ticket price for a single journey on the AC train is 1.3 times that of the same journey in First Class.\n\nThe ticket price for a single journey starts at Rs60 from Churchgate to Mumbai Central, with a steady increase (Rs85 till Bandra, Rs125 till Andheri, Rs165 till Borivali and Rs205 till Virar).\n\nUnlike regular local trains, the AC service will have a special weekly and fortnightly season ticket. A special weekly pass will cost anything between Rs285 till Mahalaxmi, to Rs945 till Andheri going all the way up to Rs1,070 till Virar. The fortnightly season ticket starts at Rs430 going up to Rs1,555 till Virar. Remember: the trains will not operate on weekends.\n\nThe monthly pass on the AC local train will cost between Rs570 to Rs820 (till Bandra) to Rs1,240 (till Andheri) to Rs1,640 (till Borivali), capping at Rs2,040 till Virar.\n\nHow to buy tickets for the AC local\n\nThere are four ways to buy tickets for Mumbai's AC local train:\n\nYou can purchase one at the ticket counter\n\nYou can book one through the Railways' official UTS mobile ticketing app just before you hop on to the train.\n\nIf you're carrying a single-journey First Class ticket, you can buy an upgrade on the train by paying the fare difference.\n\nIf you hold a First Class pass, or season ticket as it is called, you cannot buy an upgrade on the train. You will have to go right back to the ticket counter and buy an upgrade by paying the fare difference.\n\nMore AC locals coming soon?\n\nYes. There's currently just one AC local train that runs between Churchgate and Virar. From January 2019, a second AC local will be pressed into service on the same route. The new AC local will have a capacity for around 1,300 passengers, 100 more than the current one. Once that kicks in, the AC local frequency is likely to double."
