        "text": "Do I need a service or repair?\n\nWhen your phone isn’t working as you expect, it’s definitely frustrating. However, not all issues need a service. Phone issues fall into three main categories, and it's worth trying out some troubleshooting first.\n\nSoftware issues might express themselves as an app that behaves badly, a sluggish phone, a phone that won’t turn on or a phone that randomly shuts down. To help understand if it’s a software issue, try our troubleshooting guide or our Software Fix tool.\n\nThis includes buttons not working, broken charging jacks, or a battery that drains too quickly. Again, it's worth troubleshooting first to be sure it's really a hardware issue.\n\nWe list these separately because they are not covered within the standard one year warranty (but they are covered under our MotoCare Accidental Damage Plan). Physical damage includes broken screens and broken housing. Liquid damage can cause major malfunction and the sensors inside the phone will let the technicians know if this happened.\n\nHow much will it cost?\n\nIf your device is within the one year standard warranty period, most repairs will not cost anything. See below for exceptions. (Note: You can check your warranty status by visiting My Products)\n\nIf you have a broken screen or other physical damage, this is not covered under our standard warranty , so you will have to pay for the repair separately.\n\nPlease note: Both liquid and physical damage are covered under the Moto Care Accident Protection Plan.\n\nParts Price List\n\nIn most cases liquid damage will cause a major malfunction. Again liquid damage is not covered under our standard warranty. Liquid damaged devices cannot be repaired.\n\nPlease note: Both liquid and physical damage are covered under the Moto Care Accident Protection Plan.\n\nIf your device doesn’t qualify for the standard warranty (by age or condition) and you do not have a Moto Care plan, the cost will be determined by the repair center. You will receive a quotation by the repair partner when your device is received. Parts Price List"
