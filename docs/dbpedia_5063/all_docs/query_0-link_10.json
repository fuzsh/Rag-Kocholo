Trains heading to and from Mumbai that stand cancelled today are train nos. 11009, 12123, 11008 and 12128.\n\nCentral Railway short terminated several trains including train nos. 12110, 11012, 12071 and 11011.\n\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued an orange alert for Maharashtra today.

The footage from Dombivli Railway Station shows worried commuters amid heavy downpour.\n\nThe video footage from Mumbai shows waterlogged streets and roads after heavy showers wreaked havoc in the city disrupting daily life.\n\nWestern Railway, in a post on X, stated, “Mumbai Suburban trains are running upto 10 mins late because water is above track level between Matunga Rd and Dadar due to heavy rains.”\n\nThe post further states, “High capacity water pumps are being utilised to drain waters away from the railway tracks to ensure a smooth commute for Mumbaikars.”\n\nCentral Railway in a post on X stated, “Train Services on Main line are running, however due to heavy rains and water logging between Bhandup and Nahur trains are being run by clamping and padlocking the points. Clamping completed at 06.45.” Meanwhile, harbour line services are operating normally.\n\nThe Central Railway noted that at Bhandup station, the train service halted at around 5.15 am. \"At 6.40 am, services for slow local trains were restored. Fast local trains are still halted, but we will restore that also soon,” reported CNBC-TV18.\n\nVistara airlines warned passengers against heavy traffic congestion in view of heavy downpour. In a post on X, Vistara Airlines stated, “Heavy traffic congestion and slow vehicle movement are expected en route to Mumbai Airport today due to weather conditions.\n\nCentral Railway in a post on X informed that due to heavy rain and high tide in Mumbai, the movement of local trains in the suburban section is affected. The authorities further advised to avoid travel unless necessary.\n\nTrain services on the Main Line-Down and Up Fast Line between CSMT and Thane are suspended due to waterlogging at multiple locations, as reported by Central Railway.

The train services were affected between Kasara and Titwala stations, according to officials.\n\nRailways officials informed that soil came on tracks between Atgaon and Thansit stations due to heavy trains at around 6:30 am. In adition to this, a tree fell, blocking tracks near Vashind station. This disrupted rail traffic on the Kalyan-Kasara route.\n\n\"Train services between Kasara and Titwala have been suspended temporarily,\" PTI quoted a spokesperson of the Central Railway as saying. Another railway official informed news agency PTI that an overhead equipment pole tilted, causing the pantograph of the Mumbai-bound Punjab Mail train to become entangled near Vashind.\n\nTrains were diverted via the Kalyan-Lonavala-Pune-Miraj-Londa-Madgaon route due to waterlogging on tracks between Vashind and Khadavli stations, according to Central Railway. This resulted in the diversion of long-distance trains and the termination of short-distance trains."
