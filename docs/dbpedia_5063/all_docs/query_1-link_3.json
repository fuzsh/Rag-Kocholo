Built in 1886, it is one of the busiest stations on the Central line and witnesses a footfall of more than 300 thousand commuters daily. Though none of the long journey express trains halt here, it is well connected to Mumbai and Navi Mumbai through Thane. Though during rush hours the station is an unacceptably over-crowded affair. [3] Distance between Dombivli and Thane is 25 km (16 mi).\n\nKalyan-Dombivli is a twin city and a municipal corporation with its headquarters located in Kalyan in Thane district in the Indian state of Maharashtra. It was formed in 1982 to administer the twin townships of Kalyan and Dombivli. Kalyan has a history of over 700 years.\n\nThe government of India recently announced five cities of Maharashtra state for smart city project. Kalyan- Dombivli is one of them.\n\nDombivli is a town in the Thane district of Maharashtra state in Konkan division, located about 48 km from Mumbai CST. Dombivli’s history dates back to the medieval period and no major archaeological evidences ofher early habitation have been found. The earliest inhabitant known was addalal. Dombivli was first documented in the year 1075 by King Harpal Dev on stone inscriptions, situated at Mahul village near the Turbhe port. However, the stone writings in Dombivli referring to its existence during the years 1396-97 confirms the fact. The Portuguese stationed themselves at several places when they came to Dombivli.Existence of Dombivli can also be traced back approximately in the year 1730 during the Peshwa rule. In the 19th century, farmers cultivated paddy and sold it in the areas from Kalyan to Mumbai.\n\nDombivli, a town in Kalyan tahsil is located at a distance of twenty kilometers from Thane and six kilometers from Kalyan and is a railway station on the Central Railway. In the year 1075, King Harpal Dev had referred to Dombivli on the stone inscriptions, which was situated in Mahul village, near the Turbhe Port. From this, we come to know that Dombivli village existed approximately 800 years ago. There is a reference given for Dombivli in the year 1730 during the Peshwa Rule.\n\nThe stone writings referring to its existence in the years 1396-97 still exist in Dombivli is a proof of the great heritage of Dombivli. The Portuguese stationed themselves at several places when they came to Dombivli.The stone inscriptions that existed in the year 1300 B.C. at “Agasan” have been preserved in the Museum even today.\n\nIn the 19th Century farmers cultivated Paddy and sold it in the areas from Kalyan to Mumbai.\n\nIn the past, within Dombivli also, the areas were named on the basis of the inhabitants, e.g., the areas where the THAKURS” (Tribal) lived was called “THAKURLI”. The areas where the “PATHARWATS” or “STONE-CUTTERS” lived were known as “PATHARLI” and the area where the “DOMBAS” or the (low caste) lived was called “DOMBIVLI”. The area Diva, Ghariwali, Agasan was the neighboring village since ancient times.\n\nTopologically Dombivli was surrounded by the ruins of is the following villages. To the East the CHOLE village. To the West is the Airey(Aayre) village. To the South is the Patharli village. And to the North is the Thakurli village.\n\nIntially there was a thick growth of trees such as “Karwandi”, “Pendhkadi”, “Fur” and “Nivdung”. Animals such as “Wolves”, “Foxes”, “Rabbits”, etc. were found here in abundance. Due to this it was very difficult for the people of the areas of Ram Nagar, Pendse Nagar, and Vishnu Nagar to walk about freely after 5.00 P.M.\n\nIn the year 1880, the first person who settled down in KOPARGAON near “Dombivli was late Shri-Narayan Atmaram Patkar. He had two ships, which he used to transport and trade in Rice and other commodities through the Kalyan Creek. Mr. Zaveri in his unique research reports has mentioned that “Dombivli” has derived its name due to the fact that “Dombivli being situated on the shallow land was prone to the danger of being submerged in water.”Dombivli Railway Station was set-up in the year 1887. There was only one tall cabin, which was used for ticketing as well as signaling. Initially the Railway Tickets to Dombivli” was stamped as “Dimali”. Efforts were also made to rename it as “Subhash Nagar”.\n\nIt is a growing town and its vicinity to Mumbai and Thane and the availability of local train services from the place has given it the position of the suburb of Mumbai.

Kms.,\n\nIt has been enjoying a population boom with over 800,000 people (Acc. to 1991 census), The name “Concrete Jungle” just happen to justify the problem.Dombivli came into being as the Gajabandhan Village and the “Old Dombivli”, which forms the West flank at present, is embraced by the river Ulhas. And quite rightly about a decade ago, one could still see the Paddy fields in these areas. The East flank has been the golden arm of the Municipal Corporation with the major cut of the budget going towards its development. Plush colonies in the extension area of the town, Which has been under the jurisdiction of the Industrial Corporation (M.I.D.C), has been a real mother of all plans for the Municipal corporation.\n\nDombivli boasts a cosmopolitian population with Maharashtrians, Jains, Gujarathis, Kannadigas, Tamilians, Malayalee’s and Punjabis … and a marginal population of Khojas (The Aga-Khan cult) too.
