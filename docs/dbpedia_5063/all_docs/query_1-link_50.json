        "text": "The Mumbai Rail Vikash Development (MRVC) is all set to redesign 19 stations in both Central Railway (CR) and Western Railway (WR) regions with a focus on making Mumbai suburban stations less congested and to promote social distancing.\n\nWhile the project has been under discussions for the last two years, the MRVC has created general arrangement drawings (GAD) for these stations and have also received approvals for some of them. Moreover, now a tender process is being implemented to prepare a plan for the development works. Currently, drawings have been finalised for four stations, namely Khar and Bhayandar on Western Railway and Ghatkopar and Mulund on Central Railway.\n\nHowever, the development work has been hampered by the lockdown and restrictions imposed in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAs per the plans, these railway stations will undergo revamp at the floor and deck levels. Existing FOBs will be widened and there will be new wider ones as well.\n\nMRVC had received approval for the makeover of 14 of the 19 stations during the COVID-19 lockdown and they were doing the paperwork for the multi-crore project.\n\nThe revamp of the 19 stations is part of the INR 33,690 crores Mumbai Urban Transport Project-3A which will augment the suburban rail system, especially in the northern suburbs and across the wider Mumbai Metropolitan Region.\n\nMRVC has awarded consultancies for architectural planning and environmental and social impact assessment and has invited expressions of interest for a detailed design engineering consultancy.\n\nRevamps that will take place:\n\nAttempt to create maximum space within the railway station boundary\n\nProvide more space for passengers on the platform.\n\nA new pedestrian bridge, more escalators, elevator\n\nAttempts to add a pedestrian bridge and skywalk and some modifications\n\nChanges in the design of ticket windows, food stalls\n\nGood amenities and toilets\n\nAdvanced deck for passengers\n\nMore lights will be installed in the station\n\nStations that would be revamped:\n\nCentral Railway\n\nBhandup\n\nMulund\n\nThane\n\nDombivli\n\nShahad\n\nNeral\n\nKasara\n\nHarbour Line\n\nGTB Nagar\n\nChembur\n\nGovandi\n\nMankhurd\n\nWestern Railway"
