Where shunt path leads to main line, path of shunt on main line only needs to be shown.\n\n5) Station codes, signals, shunt/main track, train description shall be displayed. Field objects should be as per geographical layout. For trains, only train #s shall be displayed.\n\n6) The width, height of overview panel shall be so that it is able to accommodate 6 lines from CSTM to SNRD, 4 main lines from SNRD - CLA, 6 lines from CLA - KYN.\n\n7) Two harbor lines from CSTM - CLA, which are in planning stage, shall also be catered for. At Diwa, where trains from WR and KR join CR system, adequate space should be provided for indications to operator for all tracks & trains.\n\n8) In addition, EMUs can join/leave CR system at CSTM, CLA, KLV and SNPD car sheds.\n\n9) Sufficient space shall be made available between track indications for alphanumeric display.\n\nSpecifications for DLP Display system:\n\n1) Screen size: 67 - 70 inches diagonal\n\n2) Imaging panel: DLP - Single chip DMD\n\n3) Light Source: Dual lamp system - UHP, minimum power range 100 W with auto lamp switchover, user replaceable lamp\n\n4) Lamp use: Single to dual redundant operation.

However TMS at WR is operational for last few years and this design is approved by RDSO. So I would use WR model for describing the working of TMS.\n\nEvery driving cab in WR has conical shaped antenna mounted on roof top. The TMS input unit in cab transmits the driving cab # to central system. TMS1 and TMS2 .\n\nAntenna on CR EMU can be seen at CR Antenna1 and CR Antenna2 .\n\nAs a result, loco inspector at CCG or TNL at BCT can see details of rakes at CCG platform like: Screen1 and Screen2.\n\nSo far we have accounted for unit # of rake.\n\nNow the next question is, how to relate unit # with train #s and TT.\n\nEvery EMU bears a unique train # while plying on tracks. This # is one or two alphanumeric characters long.\n\nWhen EMU leaves car shed, it gets train # assigned and it is entered into TMS manually. Similarly, a stabled rake arrives on platform at the beginning of day, ASM enters this train # .\n\nThis accounts for six digit train Identification in TMS as shown here under item # 9.\n\nIn addition to train #, EMU also gets trip # consisting four numeric characters making it easy to match with WTT.\n\nLet's look at one EMU and her few trips during day. Details are from old WTT and may have changed.\n\nTrain # AQ\n\nTrip # 3 Dep BA 4:05 Arr BVI 4:40\n\nTrip # 22 Dep BVI 4:46 Arr CCG 5:51\n\nTrip # 51 Dep CCG 5:53 Arr BVI 6:58\n\nTrip # 100 Dep BVI 7:05 Arr CCG 8:10\n\nTrip # 155 Dep CCG 8:12 Arr BA 8:44 (Not on Sunday/Holidays. Else pick up Trip # 174)\n\nOn weekdays, her last trip would be:\n\nTrip # 859 Dep CCG 22:39 Arr BVI 23:24 . She gets new Train # the next day and ASM at BVI enters it into TMS.\n\nCar shed may pick her up on Sundays/Holidays or leave her stabled at BA. Depending upon action by car-shed, she may lose her train # or may keep it. On weekdays, she will continue her trips for the rest of the day as Train # AQ.\n\nNow with this manual input of train #, TMS knows about her trips, whether she has 9-coaches or 12-coaches.\n\nTraction controllers (TNL) may change her route from Fast track to slow track and vice versa but TMS knows the train # associated with unit so no input necessary. Only when TNL assigns a working of another train to her, he keys in the changes into TMS to reflect new trip # she will be working at.\n\nSame scenario when Control Tower assigns available platform for her which could be the same as expected or different from what is expected normally, the display on platform and electronic announcements will identify her correctly.\n\nSo TMS operator or ASM gets following screen. http://tinyurl.com/fo5pa He/She need not know unit #, train # or anything like that.\n\nTMS also gets input from signal circuits to know if that specific unit has passed signal and her location.\n\nTMS sends announcements to PA system at respective stations, sends input to display showing ETA, sets indicators to reflect TT for the rake arriving on individual platform.\n\nThe whole system works without much interference under normal circumstances. However, things go wrong at times and lots of manual input is required. That explains why every ASM, TNL and car-shed's SSE has TMS terminal handy.\n\nMore pictures of WR TMS can be seen at http://trainweb.org/railworld/TMS/"
