        "text": "Earlier this month, as the election campaign grew less phoney by the day, Michael Howard sat in the offices of Birmingham's Sunday Mercury. In his neat blue suit and pink shirt, with his square face and high forehead, he was a portrait of inscrutable composure. On the wall behind him was a collection of the tabloid newspaper's classic front pages. Just to the left of his head was one bearing the cautionary headline: 'Armed Perverts Stalking Midlands Schools'. Slightly further across was a banner headline with a novel home-owning angle: 'House Buyer Finds Skeleton in Bed'; while on the right, flanking the leader of the opposition, was an issue boasting an investigation into the economics of postmortems '12.25p to Cut up Brains of Dead Babies'.\n\nHere was the man with the nocturnal reputation framed by dark tales of skeletons and cadavers. It was a Labour spin doctor's dream. Yet if he was concerned by the ghoulish decoration over his shoulder, Howard hid his discomfort well. Though far from a natural when dealing with the public, he's been around long enough to know the campaign trail is no place to nurse an overdeveloped sense of personal dignity. Besides, as a veteran of both John Major's and Margaret Thatcher's cabinets, he is familiar with the dangers of looking back.\n\nHoward had come to the Mercury for a readers' question session. It was an intimate gathering of about 12 people, but he did not waste any time on intimacy. Howard does not possess Tony Blair's gift for informal engagement with strangers. There is no small talk or even medium-sized talk. It's straight into the big issues. An Asian man got to his feet and asked him what Howard would do to protect the Muslim community in Britain, whose plight the questioner compared to the Jews under the Nazis. Another man wanted to know what plans Howard had to promote Birmingham, while a woman quizzed him in minute detail on where he stood on mobile-phone masts.\n\nAs befits the former barrister, Howard had mastered his brief. He replied to each question with well thought-out if not particularly inspiring answers. The Asian man walked out shortly after Howard dismissed the comparison with the Nazis, but the only slightly awkward moment arrived when a plain-speaking local arose and said: '\"Prison works\". What do you mean by that?'\n\nIt was a reference to what is perhaps Howard's most infamous phrase, coined at the imperious height of his reign as home secretary, before well-known Conservatives such as Jonathan Aitken and Jeffrey Archer were imprisoned and became proselytisers for penal reform. The draconian image that those words conjured continues to haunt Howard. His recent targeting of Gypsies shows he is willing to use the same tactics again. But if he had been guilty back then of playing to the gallery, then seldom has there been a less popular populist. 'Very simple,' he answered in his effortfully calm voice. 'When they're inside they can't commit crime.' He then produced a tight-lipped pout of a smile, as if to say, 'I rest my case.'\n\nLeon Brittan, who has known Howard since they were at Cambridge together in the early Sixties, told me if he had to name his friend's political weakness it would be 'that he can persuade himself so firmly of the strength of his argument that he forgets to persuade other people'. Norman Lamont, another member of the renowned Cambridge mafia, put it slightly differently: 'He can be sometimes too much the lawyer.'\n\nIn person, Howard can be charming, but in a crowd he is short on charisma. When asked about the problems with his public profile, and the idea that he lacks warmth, Howard will say that unlike Blair he is not a person who needs to be liked. 'I don't really think about these things,' he told me. 'I've got a job to do.'\n\nBut if such matters do not occupy his thoughts, then they certainly concern his campaign team. Led by Maurice Saatchi, the advertising legend, and Lynton Crosby, the Australian who masterminded John Howard's re-election Down Under, Howard's advisers have been working on presenting a less threatening personality to the public. It's what's known in advertising parlance as 'decontaminating the brand'.\n\nWhile Howard denies a makeover, it's notable that he has replaced his old heavy-framed spectacles that made him look stern and overbearing with a new rimless pair that soften his face. There is also a greater humility in evidence. In conversation with members of the public, he'll now say things like: 'That is only my opinion, you may disagree.'\n\nIt's what Howard's wife, Sandra, calls improving the 'bedside manner'. In the past, Howard's bedside manner was reminiscent of that of a doctor informing a terminal patient that he is behind on his health-insurance payments. As if remembering he was supposed to be winning votes rather than arguments, Howard followed up his statement to the man who asked about prisons with a few conciliatory comments. But he was making no apology. Law and order is considered to be one of Labour's more vulnerable policy areas, and Howard rarely misses an opportunity to remind his audience that crime fell by 18 per cent during his time at the home office.\n\nThe strategy of identifying Labour's perceived weak points - crime, immigration, asylum, bureaucracy - and hammering away at them was beginning to deliver results by the time Howard visited Birmingham. The gap between the government and the Tories had narrowed slightly in some polls, one putting it as small as five per cent. Simon Heffer, the Thatcherite columnist, has suggested there is as much chance of Howard becoming prime minister as a 'one-legged man winning an arse-kicking competition'. But if the prospect remains implausible, it is no longer laughable. Hardly a day has passed this month without Howard delivering some kind of blow to the government. What is certain is if he could somehow steal the election it would amount to the most remarkable political resurrection in a generation.\n\nBack in 1997, Howard ran for the leadership of the Conservative Party. He was 56, a recognised heavyweight in his prime. He came fifth out of five candidates. The man who did not need to be liked found out that he wasn't - even by his own party. It was a crushing blow. Howard is not a sulker in the Edward Heath mould, so there were no operatic vendettas waged from the back benches. Nevertheless, he confided to Lamont that he would never again stand for leader.\n\nHe was as good as his word in 2001, when Iain Duncan Smith replaced William Hague, and he also managed to avoid throwing his hat in the ring when he usurped Duncan Smith in November 2003 in a bloodless coup. As he was the only candidate, it was a no contest. A politician who six years previously had been consigned to the coffin of history, at least in terms of the highest office, had now, miraculously, risen to the top of his party. His leadership was hailed by the Tory backbenchers as a return to 'grown-up' politics. Yesterday's man was suddenly the bright new hope for the future.\n\nWhether it was a testament to Howard's enduring ability or the parlous state of the Conservatives is a question that is open to debate. But it is apparent Howard's main selling point - his experience - is both his singular advantage and his distinctive liability. Having been a junior minister at the DTI, an employment secretary, environment secretary and home secretary, Howard wields a killer CV. But those posts were held in Thatcher's and Major's governments, none of which is yet recalled with misty-eyed longing. He had a role in both the poll tax and entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism, two political debacles the Tories would like to forget. In a highly competitive field, he was arguably the most unloved member of the government that lost the 1997 election.\n\nThe trick Howard must master is to portray himself as a leader with a substantial background in government without simultaneously directing too much attention to his past. Howard believes the main reason the Tories were ousted in 1997 is because 'people' - or 'peepil' as he tends to call them - 'felt that it was time for a change'. His message is that people have once again had enough. But have they had so much that they want him? 'As I travel around the country,' he told an audience of local authority Conservatives at the Birmingham Botanical Gardens, 'these are some of the words people use to describe how they feel about Mr Blair and his government: \"Let down\", \"Disillusioned\", \"Living in their own world\". And there is another word that I hear again and again from people: \"Accountability\".' It was a modern kind of speech in which the major theme is established by repeating the key word every other sentence. In this case it was 'accountability', which he seemed to say about 50 times in a few minutes. Afterwards, I asked a councillor from Walsall what she thought of the speech. 'I liked it,' she said. 'Basically, it was about accountability.'\n\nHoward also chastised Blair for his habit of saying it was 'time to move on'. Yet move on is precisely what Howard himself has had to do. The difficulty is that whereas Blair has the knack of fashioning his past failings as human, Howard's simply make him look heartless. Ill at ease when conversation strays from policy, he is not sure how to present himself as a rounded person.\n\nWhen I spoke to him in Birmingham, there was a glint in his eye and a coy grin but he gave next to nothing away about himself, or indeed about anyone else. I asked him who his friends were on the Labour benches and he said: 'I have acquaintances in the government, some of whom I'm on warmer terms with than others.' He did manage to rebuff me with a joke when I asked him to name the warmer acquaintances. 'No,' he said, 'that would be desperately unfair to them. I'm not going to ruin their political careers by confessing to a warm relationship.' But as soon as he detected the slightest intrusion into what he considered his personal arena he closed up: 'I don't think this is a road I want to go down.'\n\nThe bare bones of Howard's biography have been picked clean, but the marrow of the man remains frustratingly hard to get at. Michael Crick, that most dogged of biographers who chewed up and spat out Jeffrey Archer, has just completed his biography of Howard. Crick is a man who can detect dirt the way Aborigines can divine buried water. If it's there, he'll find it. Yet Howard's friends and advisers are confident their man will emerge unscathed.\n\nThe one story from the book that has been given an early preview is the discovery that Howard's father, a Romanian Jew who fled Europe before the war, gave false information to gain entry to Britain. Howard thinks his father did so to protect his own father, who probably entered Britain as an illegal immigrant. Not ideal news for a politician who takes a strong line on illegal immigration and abuse of the asylum system, but it was a minor embarrassment rather than a lasting wound. While Howard is not above mentioning his immigrant ancestry when it suits him, he is not someone who likes to dwell too long on his roots.\n\nHe was born in 1941 and grew up in Llanelli, South Wales, where his parents owned a drapery and where he attended the local grammar school. 'I am passionately and extremely Welsh,' he has said, but in his Birmingham speech he delighted the audience when he called for 'English votes for English laws'. As the Welsh Assembly has a very limited ability to make law, it could be seen as an oddly Anglocentric statement from the mouth of a passionate Welshman. But then his passions themselves have never been particularly Welsh. He stood out among other boys at school because in a region renowned for its fidelity to socialism and rugby, he was a Conservative who preferred football.\n\nIt was not until he went to Cambridge that he became part of a group. He read economics before transferring to law, and joined the Conservative Party. He told me that as a boy from South Wales he felt a sense of 'awe' among the gilded halls of the university. One key, perhaps, to Howard is his outsider's appreciation of tradition and, indeed, privilege (he sent his son to Eton). It's surely no coincidence that his favourite novel is Brideshead Revisited, which he first read at Cambridge and the video of which he still insists family and friends watch with him each New Year's Eve. At college, he was part of an ambitious and self-conscious set of young Conservatives, including Norman Lamont, Leon Brittan, Kenneth Clarke, Norman Fowler and John Selwyn Gummer, that John Dunn, a contemporary, once described as 'tremendously unformidable'. Lamont recalls Howard 'wavering between Conservative and Labour, flirting with social democracy'. Though fervently anti-CND and anti-communist, he was an admirer of Hugh Gaitskell. He fell out with Kenneth Clarke, who was chairman of CUCA (Cambridge University Conservative Association), over Clarke's decision to invite Oswald Mosley, the notorious fascist and Nazi-sympathiser, to speak to the group. Howard plays down the bust-up now and, typically, refuses to play the anti-semitism card. 'I hadn't particularly objected when Mosley had been invited the previous year, but I didn't think a visit from Mosley should be an annual fixture. I remonstrated and in the end I resigned.'\n\nCynics have suggested his resignation from CUCA and interest in Labour were little more than vote-winning ploys to gain the presidency of the Cambridge Union. It's a cheap shot and almost certainly untrue. But he was elected president.He left Cambridge with a well-developed taste for the good life and spent a formative year in America in 1963, discovering, among many other things, the delights of thousand island salad dressing. He returned intent on making his fortune as a barrister while looking for a safe Tory seat. During this period, he shared a bachelor flat with Lamont in Harley Street. Lamont recalls his flatmate as something of a flashy dresser: 'He wore waistcoats with lapels.' Howard tells a story of once being asked to see the judge after a court case. He nervously expected a dressing down but instead the judge praised his performance and then offered some solemn advice: 'Could I suggest a lighter stripe in your shirt?'\n\nThese were the swinging Sixties and Howard was an early convert to the cause, at least in terms of the music. 'I saw the Beatles in Cambridge when Chris Montez topped the bill,' he told me with amused pride. 'I still have a copy of their first album, which says on the sleeve that the Beatles are the biggest thing to hit British show business since the Shadows. Our two cats are called Martha and Prudence after two tracks from the White Album.' Impressed by his interest in the late, experimental period of the Fab Four, I asked him what post-Beatles pop music he enjoyed and he thought for a while. 'Things like \"Lady in Red\",' he replied brightly, 'that sort of stuff.'\n\nThe Beatles fan was also a Liverpool FC fan, and he stood twice in that city's constituency of Edge Hill, a Labour stronghold. Many of his Cambridge contemporaries, like Clarke, were quick to secure a safe seat, but Howard was over 40 before his chance came. Some friends say he relaxed his search after his marriage to the former Vogue model Sandra Paul in 1975. Another interpretation is that as Howard was her fourth husband, Sandra was not the kind of Tory MP's wife constituency committee members were looking for. 'He took me on trust,' Sandra acknowledged recently. They met at a dance in Hampshire when she was still married to husband number three. By all accounts, the attraction was instant and mutual. She had hung out with JFK and knew Frank Sinatra, who was godfather to one of her two children, and she was reckoned to be one of the great beauties of Sixties and Seventies society. Howard sent her a copy of Tender is the Night, another novel, like Brideshead, rich in doomed romance. She must have seemed quite exotic to the barrister from Llanelli. I wondered if his friends were surprised by the match.'No,' says Lamont. 'Sandra was and is a dazzling woman, but Michael had always been interested in great beauty. He used to go on and on about Julie Christie in Darling [the film in which she plays a capricious young woman who makes her way in fashionable society, jumping from one partner to the next].'\n\nThirty years on and the Howards remain devoted to one another. It's because of the obvious domestic harmony that Sandra has felt able to joke about her husband's explosive temper. 'Michael can get irritated in an instant,' Lamont confirms. '\"That's not the point I'm making,\" he'll shout at me, but I tell him it is the point I'm making. He doesn't mean it, though. It's all over very quickly.' After eight years of marriage Howard was rewarded with a seat in Folkestone. By then he had made enough money as a barrister specialising in complicated planning appeals to become a Lloyd's underwriter. One of his first jobs in government was to help draft financial services legislation that exempted Lloyd's from regulation. Howard had, by then, resigned as an underwriter, but his critics argued there was a conflict of interest because he would still reap benefits from the law. The controversy passed and he rose rapidly through the ranks to make it into Thatcher's last cabinet as employment secretary.\n\nIt was in Major's government, however, that he really came to public prominence. He seemed to relish his image as a home secretary keen on punishment, a man who was determined that prison under his leadership was not going to be a 'Butlins' holiday camp. Unfortunately, some of the prisoners did not appreciate their accommodation and there were a series of high-profile and embarrassing break-outs.\n\nIn response, Howard sacked Derek Lewis, the head of prisons. Lewis later said: 'Too much of what he does is directed at his own personal political career, too little to the broader political and public interest. I think that's a serious flaw in someone who aspires to be a political leader.' Lewis also said Howard was strongly influenced by his wife, and claimed that she once vetoed a planned improvement in prison diet. Howard could ignore all this as the invention of an embittered man. But what hurt him was the backing given to Lewis by the minister of prisons, Ann Widdecombe. Her support did not extend to resigning herself; instead, she waited until Howard ran for the leadership in 1997, when she formulated the description that has become among the most adhesive in modern British politics. There was, she said, 'something of the night' about Howard. His friends insist this was a totally unfair representation of the man. In contrast to the media or the public, those who know him are genuinely baffled by the imagery, and some are convinced it was the product of Widdecombe's near romantic attraction to Lewis. They also say that there is a caring side to Howard that seldom sees the light of publicity. Lamont talks of how Howard campaigned for Ugandan Asians to be let into the country and how he visited Jonathan Aitken in prison. Apparently it was Howard who was despatched to Ford prison to dissuade Aitken from returning to politics. But whatever the truth, or otherwise, of Widdecombe's comment, it was a long time after it was made before Howard would see a new dawn.\n\nAnother day, another press conference. A few days after Birmingham, I saw Howard again at Tory head office, where he was announcing Conservative plans for a massive campaign against sexually transmitted diseases, like the one mounted against Aids in the Eighties. The message was health that week, in particular the health of Margaret Dixon's shoulder, which had suffered from repeated operation postponements. The campaign strategy was to personalise problems wherever possible, give them a human face. It worked well, until Howard came face to face with the people in question. He looked about as comfortable as Prince Philip meeting tribal dancers.\n\n'He is unsuited to touchy-feely campaigning,' says the broadcaster Anne Robinson, a friend of Howard, who makes it clear that she has no political allegiance. 'And he's hopeless at spin.' She paints a picture of the man that bears little resemblance to his public image. 'He's charming and unspoilt. I think, for example, I was the first person to take him to the Ivy [the central London restaurant renowned for its celebrity clientele]. The point is not that he lacks sophistication, he's just not interested in being hip. He also adores women; he's at ease in the company of women.'\n\nUnfortunately for Howard, not all women seem to reciprocate those feelings. The polls suggest he is less than adored by female voters. Howard once asked a friend in the media what he could do to improve his image. The answer was: 'Never leave the house without Sandra.' It is hoped that the presence of his photogenic wife by his side will help persuade women that, in spite of what they may have heard, he is a bit of a catch.\n\nAn hour after the STD conference, Sandra appeared next to her husband at the London Lighthouse, the HIV/Aids support centre in west London. She was dressed in an elegant suit, fashionably tailored and flared. A delicate woman with the figure and hesitant manner of a schoolgirl, she has the same taut, uncertain smile as Howard, or perhaps it's the other way round. While it looks as if she's probably got involved in a few diets in her time, it seems very unlikely Derek Lewis's prison diet was one of them. According to friends, she's the liberal in the household. Just a glimpse of her confirms that she is blessed with the kind of caring expression that works like a balm. She stood in the background whenever possible at the Lighthouse, but it was to her that people were quietly drawn.\n\nHoward was solicitous of his wife's wellbeing, swapping knowing looks, a protective hand to her shoulder as he opened doors for her. It was all rather old-fashioned and touching, what you might even call chivalrous. Could it be that Widdecombe's infamous denouncement was simply an error of transcription? Did she really mean that there was something of the knight about him? A few days later, Howard went the whole hog and brought his extended family, including step-grandchildren, out at the Conservative spring conference for a photo-call. They are a fine-looking bunch, and doubtless there are votes in them, but some of Howard's friends thought that this was Lynton Crosby getting too slick for Howard's own good. Howard himself did not look noticeably more at ease with his own family in public than he had with Margaret Dixon. He looked, in fact, like a man who needed to be liked.\n\nIt's possible, of course, that the British public could vote for Howard without liking him. But to do that they would have to like Tony Blair considerably less. Some commentators would say that Blair has been doing his utmost to bring about that situation. Labour was expecting the budget to provide a springboard for its campaign, but there has been something lacklustre and complacent about many of its pronouncements, as if the government couldn't quite take Howard seriously. Shaun Woodward, who ran the 1992 Conservative campaign and later defected to Labour (he is now advising Blair on the election), told me that the Tories had two major problems. 'One, Michael Howard, and two, no coherence to their policy.'\n\nBut transport, schools and hospitals have yet to see the improvements the government promised. And Blair's personal approval rating has failed to recover from the Iraq war. Having supported the war himself, Howard cannot exploit this issue in the way that he might like to. There is simply not enough clear blue water between himself and Blair. 'I do have differences with the government,' Howard protested. 'I think it was wrong not to tell the truth about the intelligence.'\n\nHe had called on Blair to resign at the time of the Butler inquiry, which looked at the intelligence that led to the decision to go to war. Woodward saw this as a sign of Howard's characteristic desperation. 'That's his Achilles heel. He starts out with a forensic approach, but he can't help himself, he always has to go for the knock-out blow.' Howard continued: 'I think it was wrong and foolish to have gone to war without a plan. This is not wisdom in hindsight, we said this at the time: what happens after Saddam is deposed? If there had been a plan, who knows, they probably would not have disbanded the Iraqi army and the Iraqi police. And it probably would have been much easier to deal with many of the problems they face today.' So did he think that Saddam's police and army should have been retained? He acknowledged that he did not say that at the time. The point, he restated, is that there should have been a plan. 'Blair should have insisted on it.' I did not think that Britain held that kind of influence in the White House, much less the defense department. But he disagreed. So was he disappointed that George Bush didn't have a plan? 'Well,' he said, a smile threatening his lips, 'I don't criticise other leaders. I'm a British politician. I criticise British politicians. I think we should have used our clout to get a plan.' To make George Bush have a plan? ['He has little time for Bush,' said one of his friends.] 'To get a plan.' The exchange said everything about the limited room Howard has to manoeuvre on the biggest question in British politics so far this century. New Labour insiders admit that Howard is a far tougher opponent than his two predecessors, but they are not yet panicking. After all, they will remind you, the economy is strong.\n\nIn his speech in Birmingham Howard had said that as someone whose constituency was just 20 miles from France, he looked across the Channel with envy at the French health service. I pointed out that it came as a result of huge public investment, much of it through the years of Conservative under-investment in the NHS. He countered that Labour now almost matched French spending but were way behind in performance. It may be, as Howard says, that the Conservatives will continue the current rate of investment in the health service and radically increase the rate of improvement. But exposing Labour mismanagement is not the same as proving Conservative credibility. Howard is strong on the former yet he is having difficulty making an impact on the latter.\n\nI took the same train to Birmingham as Howard. Inevitably, it was late. I asked him if he thought the privatisation of the railways had been a success. 'I think you could argue about the type of privatisation until the cows come home, but what I'm quite convinced of is that the model that was in place in 1997 could have been made to work and would have worked if it had a period of stability within which to work.' Aside from a few Railtrack investors, no one really believes that. In the end, what may well keep Blair in office is the fact that he has not yet had as much time to screw up as the Tories. Or, to put it another way, the electorate has not had quite enough time to forget what went before Blair.\n\nI asked Howard in Birmingham what he thought of Blair. 'I think he still is what he's always been,' he replied, not without a certain disdain, 'a brilliant leader of the opposition.' Unless Howard can persuade the electorate that he's a changed man, that judgment may also turn out to be all that history has to offer the single-minded lawyer from Llanelli."
