        "text": "Breast augmentation is a surgical procedure to change the size, shape, or symmetry of a woman’s breasts. While breast implants are considered safe and effective in most cases, there are some potential risks that should be weighed before deciding if the procedure is right for you. You’ve already weighed the benefits of improving your current physical appearance and have decided to move forward with breast augmentation; now it’s time to understand the risks. One of the most important things you can do to prepare for your procedure is to choose the right doctor. Dr. Michael Howard believes in empowering his patients through consultation, procedure, and post-operative care to ensure that every patient is as comfortable and confident as possible. But he starts with blog posts like this to inform not only his patients and future patients but the community at large so that everyone can make the best decision for themselves, taking in all the pros and cons.\n\nTake a look at the information below, and when you’re ready to schedule a breast augmentation, call (224) 271-4250 for our scheduling coordinator. We proudly serve the Lake Forest, Chicago, and Glenview, IL communities.\n\nThe Pros and Cons of Breast Implants\n\nThere are many means to improve your breasts’ size, shape, and symmetry. These include cosmetic surgery such as breast augmentation, breast lift (mastopexy), fat transfer, and more. Breast implants are a popular way to augment the size of your breasts while also restoring fullness in cases of natural volume loss due to weight fluctuations, pregnancy & breastfeeding, or aging.\n\nThe pros include:\n\nAs with any surgery, the cons include the risk of infection or reaction to the anesthesia. But what about the risk of having implants inside your body? You may remember a recall of silicone implants in the early 1990s due to reports of implants leaking or rupturing. As the international medical community grew increasingly aware of implants through research, it was evident that issues were not widespread but rather localized and primarily included capsular contracture, rupture, and reoperations. [1] Today’s silicone and saline implants are considered safe.\n\nBreast Implant Safety Considerations\n\nThe FDA has approved silicone and saline breast implants, but there is still a risk of rupture or leakage. It is essential to follow your surgeon’s post-operative instructions, like wearing supportive bras and avoiding strenuous activities to help protect your implants. Additionally, it is recommended that you get an MRI three years after your surgery and every two years following to check the status of your implants.\n\nWhat is Capsular Contracture?\n\nWhen the implant is initially inserted, a capsule of fibrous material envelops it. Initially, this capsule is soft and thin so that there are minimal changes in appearance; however, as time passes, it gradually thickens and hardens, which can lead to shrinking breast contours causing varying levels of discomfort from slight tenderness all the way up to severe pain.\n\nThere is a broad range of capsular contracture rates, varying from as little as 1.3% to up to 30%, among patients who have received implants. [2] The probability of developing contracture increases with the duration of implants, thus inferring a direct relationship between when the implant is inserted and how long it takes for the contracture to develop. An astounding 92% of capsular contractures will likely develop within the first year after surgery. [1] Additionally, breast reconstruction patients are far more prone to capsular contractures than those undergoing aesthetic augmentation, with a rate of 10.4% reported. [3]\n\nIt is important to note that there are no current FDA-approved devices to prevent or treat capsular contracture, and the FDA requires breast implant manufacturers to conduct long-term studies to collect data on the safety and effectiveness of their products. Therefore, it is in your best interest to speak with a board-certified plastic surgeon like Dr. Howard to discuss the latest techniques and materials available.\n\nThe New Silicone Implants\n\nAfter a lengthy hiatus of fourteen years, the FDA gave implant manufacturers Allergan and Mentor permission to produce and sell silicone gel breast implants for general use in America; this applied to reconstructive surgeries and aesthetic purposes. After extensive research, the informed consent process, implants, surgical techniques, and follow-up methods have vastly improved.\n\nAs a result of this unwavering commitment to uncovering facts and promoting transparency, public faith in plastic surgery has been renewed; this is evidenced by the growing number of breast implant procedures being performed today. Over the course of seven years, the demand for breast augmentation surgery has seen an immense increase in popularity. From 2000 to 2006, it rose a whopping 64% and continued its steady growth with a 6% rise from 2006 to 2007. In fact, breast augmentation is now the most requested aesthetic procedure among Americans today![4]\n\nWhat is the Rate of Implant Sickness Today?\n\nThroughout the 1990s, countless women experienced maladies due to breast implants. These included neurological and rheumatological difficulties, which were said to be caused by the devices. After a decade-long study, the Institute of Medicine reported that silicone gel and saline-filled breast implants posed no safety risks or health issues. Furthermore, the research uncovered no new threats to health when using these devices. [5]\n\nSymptoms of implant sickness included:\n\nFatigue\n\nJoint pain\n\nMemory loss\n\nHeadaches\n\nOther chronic illnesses\n\nDespite this, the FDA has not found any scientific data to support the existence of a “breast implant illness.” The FDA has, however, declared that breast implants could cause several local complications, including infection, implant rupture, capsular contracture, and wrinkling. In rare cases, some women have experienced autoimmune reactions, which may include symptoms such as chills, fever, malaise, and swollen lymph nodes.\n\nAlthough the FDA does not endorse any specific follow-up methods for patients with breast implants, they suggest that patients receive routine aftercare appointments to ensure the safety of their implants. Additionally, the FDA recommends discussing any signs or symptoms of implant complications with their healthcare provider as soon as possible.\n\nWhat is Cohesive Gel?\n\nOne benefit of the new generation of breast implants is a more cohesive gel. The silicone gel used for breast implants has been referred to as “cohesive” since the 1980s. However, this term only recently accurately represents what is currently being utilized in modern-day implants; a solid form compared to the liquid consistency of its predecessor.\n\nToday’s cohesive gel is a thicker, more stable implant that holds its shape better and is less likely to leak or rupture should damage occur to the implant shell; this means a reduced risk of silicone leakage into the body. Additionally, cohesive gel implants are available in various shapes and sizes to better suit patients’ aesthetic goals.\n\nWhat Should I Do if My Implant is Damaged?\n\nYou must contact your doctor immediately if one of your implants is damaged. They can determine if the implant needs to be replaced. It is also recommended to get a mammogram every year and MRI scans every two years after the completion of the surgery, as these scans will allow your doctor to monitor the implant properly and check for any signs of damage.\n\nFurthermore, implants have a shelf-life and must be replaced approximately every 10-15 years. Implants are replaced to prevent a breakdown of the material and to ensure that the shape of the breast remains unchanged over time. Replacing them periodically ensures that your breasts remain looking and feeling their best.\n\nOverall, breast implants are still a safe and effective way to enhance the size and shape of your breasts. Knowing the facts about capsular contracture, implant sickness, and cohesive gel can help you make a more informed decision about the type of surgery that is right for you. With careful consideration and proper follow-up, you can enjoy breast augmentation’s benefits for many years.\n\nAre Implants Right for Me?\n\nMedical professionals have provided women safe and effective results with improved materials, techniques, and research.
