        "text": "Lord Howard of Lympne, 82, was a successful barrister for more than two decades before becoming a Member for Parliament. He rose swiftly through the ranks, becoming Home Secretary in the Thatcher administration and then Conservative Party leader.\n\nA life-long Liverpool FC supporter, he revels in the time he can now devote to watching football and remains proud of his tenure at the Home Office, during which time recorded crime in the UK fell by a million.\n\nA father of two, Lord Howard lives with his wife Sandra in Lympne, Kent, in his former constituency of Folkestone and Hythe.\n\nWhat is your earliest money-related memory?\n\nMy parents told me not to get into debt. I don’t think it was based on anything in particular, it was rather more of a principle and on the whole, I’ve adhered to it.\n\nWhat was your first job?\n\nMy parents had a fashion shop in Llanelli where we lived, and I used to help a bit. I think all it did was persuade me that this line of work wasn’t for me.\n\nWere you set on a legal career when you went to university?\n\nNo, not at all. When I went to university, I had no idea what I wanted to do for a living. I started off reading economics, which I did for a year and a half, and in my second year I began speaking at the Cambridge Union.\n\nI was very interested in politics, and found I enjoyed public debating. So, in the middle of my second year I decided to go to switch to law, and I ended up practising at the bar for 21 years.\n\nDid your subsequent legal career coincide with your political one?\n\nI combined the two with great difficulty for my first two years in Parliament. Sandra and I were agonising over what to do, then Margaret Thatcher made the decision for us when she asked me to join the government.\n\nDid your years in law help you financially when you entered Parliament?\n\nYes and no. I don’t know whether this is still the case, but at the bar you’d pay your income tax in arrears, so you pay tax on your previous year’s earnings. Well, I was doing quite well, but not really putting aside enough money for the tax bill, so when I became a minister, on a hugely-reduced salary, it became a bit difficult.\n\nDid you set your targets on higher office when you entered Parliament?\n\nI just wanted to be an MP, and didn’t think much beyond that. You can go into the House of Commons determined to be Prime Minister and if no one offers you a job you’ll never get what you want. On the other hand, you can go in as I did, just content to be a MP and if you’re asked to do a job, you do it.\n\nDid being a barrister equip you to be a minister?\n\nThe main thing I didn’t know about before becoming a minister was whether I’d be any good at taking decisions. As it was, I was actually quite good at taking them. Now, many people might say they were the wrong decisions, but that’s a different point.\n\nWhat qualities helped you become party leader?\n\nI was the fourth leader of the Conservative party in six years. By recent standards that’s not uncommon, but then it was very unusual, and I was elected unopposed. There had been so much infighting by that point that people were fed up with it all and this gave me a chance to restore a sense of unity and discipline, which I think I did.\n\nWhat moment of your career are you most proud of?\n\nWhen I arrived at the Home Office the officials told me crime has been rising at a rate of 5pc a year for the last 50 years and the first thing I needed to understand was there was nothing I could do about it. My job was to manage expectations.\n\nThat was not advice I was prepared to accept, and so with the help of many other people we changed a lot of things and crime started to come down. There were a million fewer crimes recorded when I left the Home Office than when I went there. Of course, there are some criminologists who argue to this day that it was just coincidence, but I don’t agree with that."
