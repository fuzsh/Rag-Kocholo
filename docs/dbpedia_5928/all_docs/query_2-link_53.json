        "text": "Michael Portillo visited Canvey Island on Sunday. This photo shows him meeting Ray Howard MBE and Janet Walden Chair of Canvey Community Archive at Canvey’s Dutch Cottage and was specially posed for the archive and not part of the filming. The reason for the visit was to film part of his Great British Railways Journeys, with a stop off at Canvey Island.\n\nThe archive had been instrumental in helping Michael’s crew sort out places to film and putting forward Rod Bishop to be interviewed on camera about Canvey’s Dutch Connections. The programme will be broadcast sometime in the future.\n\nWe have more photographs covering the two visits by the crew but have been asked not to use them until the broadcast. We will let you know when that will be as soon as they let us know."
