        "text": "Targeting Islamism should be more of a priority for Michael Gove than redefining extremism, Michael Portillo has said.\n\nThe former defence secretary said Mr Gove’s plans for a new definition of extremism would be “counterproductive” as it was likely to be misused by government agencies to crackdown on the wrong people.\n\nSpeaking on GB News, he cited how the previous definition of extremism in the counter-terrorism Prevent programme had led to government bodies focusing in a “perverse” way on Right-wing ideology rather than tackling the major threat posed by Islamist extremism.\n\nInstead, he said the Communities Secretary should be seeking to define simpler ideologies such as Islamism to focus government agencies on tackling the extremist threat from the ideology.\n\n“I have a feeling that if he defines that word it is going to lead to more counterproductive activity. What he needs to get hold are the organs of state that are behaving in a perverse way,” he said.\n\nHis comments come as Mr Gove prepares to unveil a new broader definition of extremism this week to enable Government, universities, councils and other bodies to ban funding for or engagement with Islamist and Right-wing groups.\n\nMr Gove said: “The definition will replace the existing Prevent definition and give practitioners more specificity on the ideologies, behaviour and groups of concern to support vital counter-radicalisation work. For all state institutions this definition and a set of engagement principles should act as a guide.”\n\nSpeaking on Camilla Tominey’s show on GB News, Mr Portillo said the last definition of extremism had seen Prevent staff draw up lists that included Right-wing Conservatives such as Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, and Brexit, even though leaving the EU had been backed by the majority of British people.\n\n“What worries me is that Michael Gove instead of trying to sort out government agencies, which are behaving in these perverse ways, is seeking to redefine extremism. The next definition of extremism will give us a new set of problems. Some of them might curb free speech,” said Mr Portillo.\n\nHe said Mr Gove, in his interview with The Telegraph, had attempted to define Islamism although he did not “quite get there”.\n\nMr Gove defined Islamism as an ideology “that seeks to set Muslims apart from the rest of society”, “divide Muslims themselves”, apply Sharia law and create “an Islamic state”.\n\nMr Portillo said: “I think that would be a very useful definition if you define Islamism. He says it is about promoting sharia law, about promoting an Islamic state. He doesn’t explicitly say it’s in Britain but I assume he means Britain.\n\nLet’s define things that are simpler than extremism.”\n\n‘A balancing act’\n\nMeanwhile, Lord Howard, the former Conservative leader, agreed that London had become a “no-go zone” for Jewish people on weekends when there were pro-Palestine protests.\n\n“It is very difficult to get the balance right. The right to protest is undoubtedly a fundamental part of a free society and we must maintain the right to protest but it is also unacceptable that sections of our community think that our streets are no-go areas for them,” said Lord Howard, who is of Jewish descent.\n\n“How we strike that balance has to try to reconcile those two sometimes conflicting rights is a really, really difficult challenge and I don’t think we have got it right at the moment.”\n\nVictoria Atkins told Sky News there was a concern that in large-scale pro-Palestinian demonstrations “there can be a minority of people who hold and extol views that make the rest of us feel not just deeply uncomfortable, but if you are a Jewish resident of London, some have said that they feel worried about walking around London when these demonstrations happen, and that’s not right”.\n\nThe Health Secretary insisted the new definition of extremism was not a political attempt to draw a dividing line with Labour. She said: “It is precisely because we have seen, sadly, in the last six months or so, we have seen this rise in extremist ideas which is making people – other citizens in our country – feel deeply uncomfortable.\n\n“So, it is that balancing act between ... freedom of speech, but also the right of citizens to go about their daily lives.”\n\nEarlier, Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said Mr Gove was right to look at the definition of extremism. She told Sky News’ Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips: “We’ll wait to see what he produces. But I do think it is right that we look again at the definition.\n\n“The most important thing from my perspective is that more is done to bring communities together. The vast, vast majority of people in this country respect, tolerate difference – [they] welcome difference and diversity – it’s one of the things that make our country great.\n\n“But, of course, it is always right to tackle extremism and hatred wherever it rears its head.”"
