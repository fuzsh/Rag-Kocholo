        "text": "Accused currently on pre-trial release for allegedly stealing alcohol from Elmhurst Jewel-Osco\n\nDuPage County State’s Attorney Robert Berlin and Lombard Chief of Police Tom Wirsing announced today that Judge Joshua Dieden denied the State’s motion to detain pre-trial a Chicago man accused of fleeing from police after allegedly stealing $837.82 worth of alcohol from a Lombard Mariano’s grocery store. Michael Howard, 43 (d.o.b. 1/6/1981) of the 4800 block of Washington Boulevard, appeared in First Appearance Court this morning charged with one count of Burglary (Class 2 Felony), two counts of Retail Theft (Class 3 Felony), one count of Fleeing and Eluding a Police Officer (Class 4 Felony) and one count of Misdemeanor Resisting or Obstructing a Police Officer. Howard is currently out on pre-trial release for allegedly stealing twenty-six bottles of liquor from an Elmhurst Jewel-Osco store on March 15, 2024. A hearing is scheduled for tomorrow, April 19, 2024, to consider the State’s Petition to Revoke Howard’s pre-trial release in that case.\n\nOn April 17, 2024, at approximately 7:40 p.m., officers with the Lombard Police Department responded to a call of a retail theft in progress at the Mariano’s located at 345 W. Roosevelt Road. Upon his arrival, a Lombard police officer located the suspect, later identified as Howard, already in his vehicle, pulling out of the Mariano’s parking lot. After following Howard for a short amount of time, the officer activated his emergency lights and sirens to initiate a traffic stop. It is alleged that instead of pulling over, Howard accelerated away from the officer. Pursuit of the vehicle continued with assistance from the Oak Brook and Villa Park Police Departments. It is alleged that during the pursuit, Howard reached speeds of 65 mph in a 35-mph zone. Near 25th Avenue and I-290, Oak Brook police successfully deployed spike strips stopping Howard’s vehicle. It is alleged that once stopped, Howard refused to exit the vehicle and resisted a Villa Park police officer’s attempt to remove him. When searching Howard and his vehicle, officers found eighteen bottles of alcohol in the vehicle and one bottle of alcohol in Howard’s pants. He was taken into custody at this time.\n\n“It is alleged that Mr. Howard, who is currently on pre-trial release for stealing alcohol from a DuPage County grocery store, thumbed his nose at the law and again stole alcohol from a DuPage County grocery store,” Berlin said. “To further aggravate the matter, it is alleged that Mr. Howard once again ignored the law and attempted to flee from law enforcement, putting the motoring public at risk. Thankfully, no innocent motorists or pedestrians were injured or killed as a result of Mr. Howard’s alleged actions. The successful apprehension of the defendant in this case sends the message that if you come to DuPage County to steal or otherwise break the law, you will be arrested, charged and prosecuted. I commend the Lombard Police Department for their efforts on this case as well as the Oak Brook and Villa Park Police Departments for their assistance. I also thank Assistant State’s Attorneys Bethany Jackson, Michael McBride and Michael Paup for their work in securing charges against Mr. Howard.”\n\n“I want to thank all of our law enforcement partners for their assistance on this case especially State’s Attorney Bob Berlin and his staff.” Wirsing said.\n\nHoward’s next court appearance is scheduled for April 29, 2024, for arraignment in front of Judge Brian Telander.\n\nMembers of the public are reminded that this complaint contains only charges and is not proof of the defendant’s guilt. A defendant is presumed innocent and is entitled to a fair trial in which it is the government’s burden to prove his or her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt."
