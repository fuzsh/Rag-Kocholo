        "text": "Michael Portillo is a British politician who served as Prime Minister (1996 - 2005). He is considered one of the founders of the so called New Right, including classical liberal economics with social liberalism and one nation conservatism.\n\nPortillo was only the second Conservative Prime Minister since 1959, and the longest serving conservative Prime Minister since Lord Salisbury.\n\nAs Leader of the opposition (1994 - 1996) he re-branded the conservative party as a modern right of centre political party, and appealed to younger voters. He led the Conservatives to landslide election victories at the 1996 and 2000 general elections.\n\nAfter his decision to support militarily the United States invasion of Iraq Portillo's personal popularity began to wane, and his situation as party leader began to weaken.\n\nIn 2005 he resigned, under pressure from other figures within the Conservative party. He resigned from parliament 6 months later. He has subsequently become Secretary of Democrats International, a worldwide forum of Centre-Right political parties.\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nPortillo entered parliament at the 1987 election.\n\nEarly Political Career[]\n\nLeader of the Opposition[]\n\nPortillo united both the pro-European and Eurosceptic wings of his party around a European referendum. Running up to the election Portillo introduced all women shortlists in some constituencies, this proved controversial, particularly with traditional conservative supporters.\n\nPrime Minister[]\n\nCabinet[]\n\nFirst Cabinet 1996 - 2000[]\n\nPrime Minister - Michael Portillo\n\nDeputy Prime Minister - Malcolm Rifkind\n\nChancellor of the Exchequer - Ken Clarke\n\nForeign Secretary - John Redwood\n\nHome Secretary - Michael Howard\n\nDefence Secretary - Iain Duncan Smith\n\nEducation Secretary - Gillian Shepherd\n\nEmployment Secretary -\n\nEnvironment Secretary - Norman Fowler\n\nHealth Secretary - John Maples\n\nSocial Security Secretary -\n\nTransport Secretary - George Young\n\nScottish Secretary - Michael Forsythe\n\nWelsh Secretary - William Hague\n\nSecond Cabinet 2000 - 2005[]\n\nPrime Minister - Michael Portillo\n\nDeputy Prime Minister - Ken Clarke\n\nChancellor of the Exchequer - Peter Lilley\n\nForeign Secretary - Michael Howard\n\nHome Secretary - Ann Widdecombe\n\nDefence Secretary - Iain Duncan Smith\n\nEducation Secretary - Theresa May\n\nHealth Secretary - Liam Fox\n\nScottish Secretary - Jacqui Lait\n\nWelsh Secretary - William Hague\n\nFirst Term 1996 - 2000[]\n\nPortillo's first term was centered largely around economic changes, largely encapsulated in the so called, Tory Trinity announced at the 1996 conference, of \"Deregulation, Privatisation and Revitalisation\".\n\nPortillo cast the conservatives as being liberal both on social and economic matters, this did upset many on the left of the party.\n\nHe followed through on campaign promises to cut public spending and taxes, including privatising the BBC.\n\nSecond Term 2000 - 2005[]\n\nThe Conservatives were re-elected in another landslide in 2000. In the subsequent cabinet reshuffle Clarke was demoted from Chancellor to Deputy Prime Minister, being replaced by Peter Lilley.\n\nIn October 2004 he announced that he intended to lead the Conservative Party not only into the next election, but intended to serve at least another three years in office. This angered many not only in the conservative party, but within his own cabinet. Pressure mounted on him to resign, with Ken Clarke openly declaring he would seek to challenge him.\n\nThe crisis gradually grew deeper, in January 2005 Michael Howard informed Portillo that he would not be able to support him as leader for much longer.\n\nPost Prime Ministerial Career[]\n\nPortillo resigned from the House of Commons a month after leaving office. He took up several company directorships."
