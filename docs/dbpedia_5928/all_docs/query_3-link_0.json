        "text": "Michael Howard, Baron Howard of Lympne (born July 7, 1941, Gorseinon, South Wales, England) is a British politician who was the leader of the Conservative Party (2003–05).\n\nHoward’s father, Bernat Hecht, was a Jewish Romanian immigrant who settled in England in 1939 and changed his name to Bernard Howard. (Other members of the family remained behind, including Howard’s grandmother, who later died in a Nazi concentration camp.) After graduating from Peterhouse, Cambridge, Howard became a barrister. His ambition, however, was always to become a politician. He stood unsuccessfully for a seat in the House of Commons in the 1966 and 1970 general elections. In 1983 he was elected MP for the south-coast seat of Folkestone and Hythe.\n\nIn 1985 Howard joined Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s government as a junior minister at the Department of Trade and Industry. He won respect for overseeing the deregulation of London’s financial district, and in 1987 he was promoted to minister for local government. This position brought him to national prominence when he introduced legislation to abandon Britain’s traditional form of local taxation, the property-based “rates” system, and replace it with a poll tax, or “community charge,” in which every adult not receiving welfare benefits was to be charged the same amount for local services. Although Howard succeeded in securing passage of the bill, the poll tax was immensely unpopular. It contributed to Thatcher’s resignation as prime minister in 1990, and one of the first decisions taken by John Major, her successor, was to scrap the poll tax and revert to a property-based system of local taxation. Howard, however, survived the storm and in 1990 joined the cabinet as employment secretary. In 1993 he was promoted to home secretary, a post from which he introduced stricter policies on both immigration and prisons."
