        "text": "Riding on his re-election on Tuesday as the Conservative Party leader, Prime Minister John Major shuffled his Cabinet this afternoon, passing out plum positions to loyalists of both the Tory right and the Tory left and rewarding two would-be rivals who did not challenge him.\n\nThe post of Foreign Secretary, which is critical as Britain tries to hammer out its policies on European integration and on Bosnia, went to Malcolm Rifkind, who had backed Mr. Major and had been effective as an articulate and cost-cutting Defense Secretary.\n\nThe Foreign Secretary's job had been filled by Douglas Hurd, an anathema to the far right, which viewed him as overly favorable to closer integration into Europe through the European Union. Mr. Rifkind shifted his view on the \"Euroskeptics\" in a January speech, in which he insisted that the \"nation state\" must retain final authority in the European organization.\n\nThe balancing act involved two men who supported Mr. Major publicly, allowing him to beat the challenger, John Redwood, on the first ballot by winning two-thirds of the ballots cast by 329 Tory members of Parliament.\n\nA position long vacant -- Deputy Prime Minister -- was awarded to Michael Heseltine, 62, president of the Board of Trade and Secretary of Trade and Industry. Mr. Heseltine, a flamboyant elder statesman for the party's liberal wing and the man whose challenge brought down Mr. Major's predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, in 1990, resisted blandishments to declare his availability this time around, though he was privately said to still covet the job.\n\nMr. Rifkind's position as Defense Secretary went to the other potential rival, 42-year-old Michael Portillo. Mr. Portillo, son of a refugee from Franco's Spain, was in the relatively minor post of Employment Secretary and had become the rallying figure for the economically conservative, anti-European right. His allies were making preparations for a campaign in his name in the event that Mr. Major did not win on the first ballot.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
