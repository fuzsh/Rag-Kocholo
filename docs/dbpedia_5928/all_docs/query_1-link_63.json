        "text": "Most politicians fall into one of two categories. There are those who are in it because they love the game, the intrigue, the feeling of proximity to great events. And there are those who go into politics to get things done.\n\nOf course, there is always some overlap. There was with Alan Clark. But there is little doubt that he belonged in the first rather than the second category.\n\nAs early as 1969, for example, five years before he entered Parliament, Clark wrote to his father:\n\n“It is a curious thing, but even such slight contact as I have had with the political world, suggests that it is, to me, highly addictive. While one is intoxicated, all other interest and certainties seem unimportant.”\n\nNearly 10 years later, when he had been an MP for four years, he wrote:\n\n“I just adore the Commons. I am seduced by its gossipy, club-like regimental atmosphere and love also the delicious karate-style confidence that being an MP gives me.”\n\nAnd how he loved the gossip. In 1993, Tristan Garel-Jones and I were the only MPs at the wedding of Clark’s son Andrew. When we reached the head of the line at the reception at Saltwood Castle, Alan promptly grabbed us. “Stuff this,” he said, “let’s go and have a good gossip.” Leaving Jane and the other members of the wedding party to deal with the rest of their guests, he marched us to another room so that he could get his fix on what was happening at Westminster.\n\nThis was during his ‘‘wilderness years’’ – the period between his decision not to stand for re-election at Plymouth Sutton in 1992 and his return at Kensington and Chelsea in 1997. Paradoxically, that was the time when I saw him most. As his neighbour in Kent, and his MP, I was one of the few sources of information who were readily available. And by that time we had become friends, though it hadn’t always been so.\n\nThe most striking manifestation of this was the letter he sent me when I entered the Cabinet in 1990. It took a long time to decipher his famously illegible handwriting but eventually I was able to read:\n\nI used to think you were a Grade A s---. But I have changed my mind.\n\nAlan was always very good company – witty, engaging and utterly forthright in his views. But you knew that he was dangerous. Even before the publication of the diaries in 1993, you knew that nothing you said would be likely to remain unrepeated.\n\nThe diaries are his great legacy. They are undoubtedly what he will be remembered for. But are they, as Ion Trewin concludes in this very readable account of an extraordinary life, how he will ultimately be judged?\n\nWhen asked by Sue Lawley on Desert Island Discs whether he would dump the diaries if it meant getting into the Cabinet, Clark equivocated. But I think it is clear that political success was what he craved. And his political career certainly left its mark on history, though not in the way he would have chosen.\n\nHis ministerial career was not without its achievements, to a greater extent than is normal for those who don’t enter the Cabinet. His supporters can justly claim credit for his part in the Defence Review in the late Eighties, though that involved a high degree of conspiracy in circumventing the authority of his secretary of state, Tom King.\n\nBut his part in what became known as the ‘‘Arms to Iraq’’ saga is impossible to justify. As Minister of Trade, he was responsible for encouraging exports. But he was equally responsible for complying with Government guidelines that prohibited the export to either Iran or Iraq, during the war between those countries, of any defence equipment that would “significantly enhance the capability of either side to prolong or exacerbate the conflict”.\n\nIt may have been unsurprising, as Trewin records, that Clark found the guidelines ‘‘irksome, tiresome and intrusive’’, but that was no justification for his attempts to get around them.\n\nAnd it certainly did not justify his behaviour in encouraging British firms who wished to export defence equipment to Iraq to make misleading statements about the likely use of their products in order to obtain export licences.\n\nHis culpability did not end there. The various accounts he gave of his part in this saga were inconsistent and indeed contradictory. They culminated in his cross-examination by counsel for two businessmen who were being tried at the Old Bailey for selling machine tools to Iraq that could be used for the manufacture of munitions. He had, he admitted, been “economical with the actualité”. Moreover, he went on, he would have helped British firms in selling their goods abroad even if they had told him that their customers would use them to manufacture munitions.\n\nThe trial promptly collapsed and the Scott Inquiry was set up. When its report finally came out, it was extremely damaging to the Government and a significant factor in the decline of its political fortunes.\n\nTrewin tells the story in the book and leaves nothing out. But he is too quick to emphasise points that seem to lessen Clark’s responsibility for what happened. He quotes, for example, Scott’s conclusion that it wasn’t simply Clark’s evidence that was fatal to the prosecution. That may be so. But if Clark had done his job, no export licence would have been granted, none of the equipment would have reached Iraq and there would have been no trial.\n\nThe chapter devoted to this episode contains one of the few errors in the book. Charles Powell, Margaret Thatcher’s principal adviser at No?10, will doubtless be amused by the description of him as Robin Butler’s predecessor as Cabinet Secretary.\n\nTrewin dedicates the book to Jane Clark, and nothing could be more fitting. She is the heroine of the story. The book is not coy about Alan’s women. In particular, it explains in some detail the relationship with Alison Young, his secretary – the one woman for whom he apparently contemplated leaving Jane. Nor is it coy about Jane’s reaction – to this and his numerous other affairs. No woman, faced with such a string of public infidelities, could have been more spirited, loyal and stoic. The diaries exposed them to the world and yet Jane handled it all with immense strength of character. And Clark was, in Simon Hoggart’s words, a philanderer obsessed with his wife.\n\nTowards the end of his life, very movingly described in the book, his devotion to and dependence on Jane was uppermost in his mind. She was a remarkable wife to a remarkable man.\n\nArrogant, rude, clever, charming, witty. A brilliant diarist, a serious military historian and a frustrated – and ultimately unsuccessful and unfulfilled – politician, Alan Clark was also a warm friend. His story is well worth telling and in this book Trewin has captured the essence of an extraordinary man."
