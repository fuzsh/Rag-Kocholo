        "text": "Howard Kutner, a founding partner of one of KPK Law’s predecessor firms, Kutner Law LLP, passed in March 2023. A graduate of Osgoode Hall Law School, Howard devoted many years to practicing corporate and real estate law. In the early months of 2014, he welcomed his son Michael as a partner, and together they established Kutner Law LLP, collaborating for a meaningful nine years (though Michael would argue, not nearly long enough).\n\nA unique character, Howard humorously referred to Michael as both his son and “son-in-law.” Beyond the jokes, their partnership was a testament to a strong familial and professional bond. Howard’s legacy lives on in the principles and knowledge he imparted to the KPK Law team.\n\nAs we reflect on Howard’s contributions, we want to assure everyone that we are committed to honouring his memory by upholding the standards and values he instilled in us. The legacy he leaves behind remains an integral part of our practice."
