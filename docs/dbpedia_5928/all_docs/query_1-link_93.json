Lord Strathclyde, who keeps his job as Leader of the opposition in the Lords, completes the shadow cabinet line-up.\n\nIn the lower tier of the Tory front bench, Nicholas Soames returns as shadow defence minister, a portfolio he once held in Mr Major's government, while John Bercow, who quit Mr Duncan Smith's team over gay adoption last year, becomes spokesman on international development affairs.\n\nAlan Duncan has been made shadow secretary for constitutional affairs and Julie Kirkbride wins her first front bench job as shadow secretary for culture, media and sport.\n\nMichael Howard's cabinet in full:\n\nMichael Howard: leader of the Opposition\n\nOliver Letwin: shadow chancellor\n\nDavid Davis: shadow home secretary\n\nMichael Ancram: shadow foreign secretary\n\nTim Yeo: shadow health and education secretary\n\nLiam Fox: co-chairman responsible for campaigning\n\nLord Saatchi: co-chairman responsible for party management\n\nDavid Maclean: chief whip\n\nDavid Willetts: policy co-ordination and shadow pensions secretary\n\nDavid Curry: shadow local government secretary\n\nTheresa May: shadow environment and transport secretary\n\nLord Strathclyde: leader of the Lords\n\nMinisterial teams\n\nInternational affairs: Michael Ancram; Nicholas Soames (defence); John Bercow (international development); James Arbuthnot (trade).\n\nEconomic affairs: Oliver Letwin; David Willets; Howard Flight (treasury); Stephen O'Brien (industry); Andrew Mitchell; Laurence Robertson; Andrew Tyrie.\n\nHome, constitutional and legal affairs: David Davis; Dominic Grieve (attorney general); Alan Duncan (constitutional affairs); Julie Kirkbride (culture); Tim Boswell; Eleanor Laing; Jacqui Lait; Humfrey Malins; Patrick Mercer.\n\nHealth and education: Tim Yeo; Tim Collins (education); Andrew Lansley (health); Simon Burns; Tim Loughton.\n\nEnvironment and transport: Theresa May; Caroline Spelman (environment and women); Damian Green (transport); John Whittingdale (agriculture and food); Christopher Chope; Greg Knight: Anne McIntosh.\n\nLocal government Wales and Scotland: David Curry; Eric Pickles (local government); Bernard Jenkin (regions); David Lidington (Northern Ireland); Peter Duncan (Scotland); Bill Wiggin (Wales); Geoffrey Clifton-Brown; John Hayes.\n\nParliament: Lord Strathclyde; David Maclean; Baroness Blatch (deputy leader of the Lords); Lord Kingsland (lord chancellor); Lord Cope of Berkeley (Lords chief whip); Baroness Seccombe (Lords deputy chief whip); Patrick McLoughlin (Commons deputy chief whip); Oliver Heald (leader of the Commons)."
