        "text": "Nigel Fletcher is an adviser in the Conservative Research Department\n\nand a Councillor in the London Borough of Greenwich. This article is\n\nadapted from his ongoing research for a doctoral thesis on the role of\n\nthe Opposition in Britain.\n\nThe Leader of the Opposition and the Conservative Shadow Cabinet sat around the table in their meeting room, posed for a group photograph. With two years to go before a General Election, they faced a former Labour Chancellor who had taken over as Prime Minister from a younger and more charismatic predecessor. After the cancellation of an expected General Election, Labour was set for eventual defeat at the hands of a resurgent Conservative Party and its dynamic leader.\n\nThat Leader was Margaret Thatcher, and the Prime Minister, James Callaghan. It was 1977, but the parallels with David Cameron and Gordon Brown today are striking. So on Monday of this week, thirty years on, I watched as Lady Thatcher sat with David Cameron in the Shadow Cabinet Room, where she planned her Government, and where he now plans his.\n\nThe event was the launch of an exhibition I have put together in conjunction with the Parliamentary Archives, entitled ‘Government’s Waiting Room.’ It marks the contribution the Shadow Cabinet’s premises have made to recent Parliamentary history, and is drawn from my wider research for a doctoral thesis on the role of the Opposition. If the Shadow Cabinet is a Government-in-waiting, my argument runs, its offices are the most significant waiting-rooms in Britain. They matter because, as Winston Churchill said in reference to the Palace of Westminster, ‘we shape our buildings and afterwards our buildings shape us.’ Well, that’s my excuse – in truth, having worked in and around the Shadow Cabinet block over the years, its history intrigued me.\n\nThat curiosity led me, after several months of research, to organise\n\nthe reception in the Shadow Cabinet Room on Monday. With the exception\n\nof John Major (who was absent abroad) we were joined by all the other\n\nConservative Leaders to have used the room since: William Hague, Iain\n\nDuncan Smith, Michael Howard, and of course David Cameron, who escorted\n\nLady Thatcher to the event after their private talks in his office.\n\nAlso in attendance were a number of surviving members of the 1970s\n\nShadow Cabinet –Teddy Taylor, Norman Fowler and Tom King.\n\nIt was a very special evening, with many memories shared. Lady\n\nThatcher herself was on top form, and no-one who heard her take control\n\nof the photocall at the Shadow Cabinet table can doubt she still has a\n\ncommanding presence. It was that same determination which secured her\n\nthe use of the current Shadow Cabinet Room in 1976 and ensured that in\n\nthe thirty-one years since, it has been at the heart of politics at\n\nWestminster as the designated home of the Opposition.\n\nWhen Mrs Thatcher took over as Leader of the Opposition in 1975 she was\n\nfar from impressed by the facilities she found. The Leader’s Room\n\ndoubled as the Shadow Cabinet meeting room, and she recalls in her\n\nmemoirs that there ‘was not enough space, and as summer approached it\n\nall became very hot and airless.’ The inadequacy of the facilities was\n\nunderlined by the fact her secretaries had to sit on the floor in the\n\nmain room to sort the huge pile of correspondence she received.\n\nShe did, however, attempt to make her surroundings more bearable, as a\n\njournalist who interviewed her there in May 1975 reported:\n\n\"Margaret\n\nThatcher has persuaded the Department of the Environment to embellish\n\nthe Leader of the Opposition’s room with a couple of cloth-covered\n\nsettees and an armchair, a pink-shaded brass lamp and a chromium and\n\nglass table. There should be some impressionist prints coming. The\n\nplates on the mantel-piece are her own. Only half the bulbs in the\n\nchandelier light up, which has her snapping switches in mild\n\nexasperation.\"\n\nHer office routine made the inadequacies of her office more\n\ntroublesome. In the same interview she revealed that she was normally\n\nin her office by 9.30am and stayed at least until the House of Commons\n\nrose for the night, frequently much later:\n\n‘By the time I’ve been\n\nwriting a speech at three o’clock in the morning, my hair is looking\n\ndishevelled. I haven’t even got a mirror in this room, I must get\n\none. You look in the glass of a bookcase or something, but you make\n\nup before you go out in the morning, you put on something reasonably\n\ntidy and you hope it remains reasonably tidy.’\n\nThe job of solving the problem of lack of space fell to Mrs Thatcher’s\n\nhead of office and close confidante, Airey Neave MP, who discussed it\n\nwith the Government. When the request was reported to him, Prime\n\nMinister Harold Wilson agreed that ‘parliamentary accommodation is\n\ninadequate but that the solution for that must be found within the\n\nparliamentary setting.’\n\nFinancial pressures meant that little progress was made at first, but\n\nthe following year, with new Prime Minister James Callaghan in Downing\n\nStreet, Airey Neave approached the new Leader of the House, Michael\n\nFoot, to ask if there was any possibility of the Opposition taking over\n\nsome of the accommodation in the official Serjeant at Arms’\n\nresidence, off Speaker’s Court. The Serjeant was retiring, and his\n\nsuccessor had made it known that he was content to remain in his\n\nexisting flat as long as provision were made for his Deputy. After\n\nchecking with the Department of the Environment and Number 10, Michael\n\nFoot wrote to Airey Neave to tell him ‘we are content for the\n\nOpposition to move during the Recess into that part of the Serjeant’s\n\nformer residence that is not being converted for the use of the Deputy\n\nSerjeant… I am glad to note that you do not want the move to cost a\n\ngreat deal, and I hope that agreement can soon be reached on any\n\nexpenditure that may be necessary.’\n\nNeave had indeed been at pains to stress the lack of spending desired,\n\nnoting that although the decorations were ‘mostly sub-standard and are\n\ndue to be replaced under normal maintenance’ it would ‘be wrong in our\n\nview to spend money on them at the present time. A thorough cleaning\n\nthroughout, together with the rearrangement of the furniture, is all\n\nthat we feel would now be justified.’ He requested extra telephones,\n\nannunciators (Parliamentary information screens) and a division bell,\n\nbut added ‘all of this would have been needed to whatever House\n\npurposes the rooms were allocated.’ The careful display of frugality,\n\nand its commitment to paper, demonstrates the sensitivity of a\n\npolitician at a time of national restraint, as well as Mrs Thatcher’s\n\nown instincts on good housekeeping.\n\nWhen the order to begin work filtered down to the Department of the\n\nEnvironment, an official there noted the instruction for a minimal\n\namount of work to be carried out, but pointed out that the new Shadow\n\nCabinet room ‘can be very cold in winter’, and asked if anything needed\n\nto be done about this, or whether ‘this been accepted as well.’ She\n\nalso added sceptically ‘I am personally very doubtful that Mrs Thatcher\n\nwill stand the present very heavy ‘dining room’ decoration for long.’\n\nThe move to the new premises is recorded with a short sentence on the\n\nShadow Cabinet agenda of 13th October 1976, the first meeting back\n\nafter the Parliamentary recess. Below the list of items such as\n\n‘British Transport Locks (Felixstowe) Bill’ is the note ‘Please note\n\nthat Mrs Thatcher’s new office is where the Serjeant at Arms’ office\n\nused to be, [past] the Prime Minister’s office.’ Mrs Thatcher chaired\n\nthe meeting from a seat in the middle of the long side of the table,\n\nfacing the window. This configuration mirrored that of the Cabinet\n\nRoom in Number 10 Downing Street, no doubt intentionally, whilst a\n\nportrait of Sir Winston Churchill gazed down from the wall at the\n\nweekly meetings.\n\nFrom this room, and her office across the corridor, Mrs Thatcher held\n\ncourt for the duration of her period as Leader of the Opposition. She\n\nboth worked and entertained there during the week when the House was\n\nsitting, receiving visitors including Ronald Reagan, who came to see\n\nher there whilst still Governor of California in November 1978. She\n\ncertainly made herself at home, as one of her staff recalled. Matthew\n\nParris, who worked in her correspondence unit, recalls an occasion just\n\nbefore a Shadow Cabinet meeting when he walked into the Shadow Cabinet\n\nRoom to find the Leader of Her Majesty’s Opposition standing on a\n\nwobbling chair in stockinged feet, running her finger along the top of\n\nan oil painting. ‘It’s the way a woman knows whether a room’s been\n\ncleaned properly’, she told him.\n\nIn the years that followed Mrs Thatcher’s move to Downing Street, the\n\nShadow Cabinet Room continued to see its share of political drama and\n\nfarce. Under Neil Kinnock, Welsh trade union banners adorned the\n\nwalls, whilst there were reports that Sue Nye, his diary secretary (who\n\nnow controls access to Prime Minister Gordon Brown) used to perform\n\nacrobatic somersaults as her party piece after receptions there.\n\nJust before the 1992 General Election, the House authorities discussed\n\nwith the Opposition the replacement of the curtains, and reportedly\n\nasked Kinnock’s office to avoid the existing colour, red, to avoid any\n\nembarrassment if the Conservatives moved in after polling day. In the\n\nend, they decided on gold, which they remain to this day. When Kinnock\n\nlost the election, he chose this room for his valedictory press\n\nstatement, flanked by his wife and closest personal staff, with the\n\nSouth Wales area NUM banner and a display of red roses behind him.\n\nJohn Smith signalled a break with his predecessor by replacing the\n\nbanner on the wall with a painting showing ‘a rainswept Palace of\n\nWestminster across a grey, storm-tossed Thames’ for the duration of his\n\nleadership. After Smith’s death, Tony Blair made frequent use of the\n\nroom, and placed a bronze figure of Clement Attlee on the mantelpiece,\n\nalong with a stack of books including the New Testament. The People\n\nnewspaper reported that in September 1996 Blair chose the ‘deserted\n\nShadow Cabinet room… where New Labour was born’ to prepare his final\n\nparty conference speech before the General Election. The paper\n\ndescribed a romantic vision of the Prime Minister-in-waiting ‘alone\n\nwith his thoughts’, ‘out of the spotlight’ with ‘the only sound the\n\nscratching of Tony’s pen.’ And, presumably, the sound of the camera\n\nshutter and flash of the photographer sent along to record the occasion.\n\nWhen the Conservatives returned to Opposition, the room saw plenty of\n\ndramatic scenes. William Hague, who placed a portrait of his hero\n\nWilliam Pitt on the wall, arrived at a Shadow Cabinet meeting one\n\nevening in 1998 to announce to colleagues he had just fired Lord\n\nCranbourne as Conservative Leader in the Lords for his secret deal with\n\nLabour on Lords reform. Five years later, in October 2003, Iain\n\nDuncan Smith marched in to tell his senior colleagues that despite\n\nmounting criticism he would not resign. His press aide Nick Wood\n\nrecorded that ‘his colleagues banged the table, but they made a hollow\n\nsound.’ Less than a week later, MPs triggered the vote of no\n\nconfidence which ended his leadership.\n\nMichael Howard’s Chief of Staff Stephen Sherbourne, like Airey Neave\n\nbefore him, identified the problem of lack of office space, but found a\n\nsolution with admirable speed. Instead of moving into the Shadow\n\nCabinet block, Howard and his team instead took over offices in the\n\nNorman Shaw South Parliamentary outbuilding, which had recently\n\nreopened after a refurbishment. The old Shadow Cabinet Room was still\n\nused for meetings, and it was here that Michael Howard unveiled his\n\nnew, slimmed-down Shadow Cabinet to the press. He reduced its size to\n\njust 12 people, a fact that meant meetings could also be held in his\n\noffice if necessary. The innovative idea was not deemed a success,\n\nhowever, and in a reshuffle the following year the Shadow Cabinet grew\n\nagain to a size that more closely matched both the number in the Labour\n\ncabinet and the number of seats around the Shadow Cabinet table.\n\nMore recently, David Cameron’s Shadow Cabinet has risked becoming too\n\nlarge to fit comfortably around the table. Their first meeting\n\nfollowing the last reshuffle in July was therefore held in the Attlee\n\nRoom in Portcullis House, where there was room for them to gather in\n\ncomfort and pose for group photographs. Regular meetings have now\n\nswitched back to the more traditional setting of the Shadow Cabinet\n\nRoom, where the more limited space means that Cameron leads a very\n\nclose-knit team in every sense."
