        "text": "Dallas Defense Attorney – Michael Howard\n\nThe fact that one mistake, one bad day, or even a police officer’s mistake could completely ruin or change the trajectory of your entire life made me want to get into criminal law.\n\nI grew up in Dallas and attended SMU Dedman School of Law. I began my career fighting for people as a Public Defender in Dallas. I saw how unfairly the criminal justice system treats people, especially if they don’t have a good lawyer.\n\nI wanted to treat my clients how they deserved to be treated – by taking the time necessary to get to know who they are and what they need. I created my law firm to do just that. Understanding that people shouldn’t be judged on their worst day, I strive to help people through difficult times with compassion and integrity.\n\nAreas of Practice\n\nThe Law Office of Mike Howard is 100% criminal defense in both TX state and federal courts.\n\nDomestic Violence\n\nDrug Crimes\n\nDWI\n\nViolent Crimes\n\nSex Offenses\n\nTheft & Fraud\n\nFederal Crimes\n\nFelonies\n\nMisdemeanors\n\nProbation Violations\n\nRobbery & Property Crimes\n\nWeapon Charges\n\nI combine my understanding of my clients with my legal and trial experience to build a unique plan for each case.\n\nOur Mission\n\nFacing criminal charges is intimidating. Knowing this, I ensure my clients understand the process, their rights, and the possible outcomes for their case. I pride myself on getting to know my clients outside of their case files. When I represent you, you’ll have an ally to explain the process, your rights, your options, and how to best resolve the matter.\n\nOur Approach\n\nEvery case is unique, and while not every case needs to go to trial – trial experience is crucial. With an extensive trial background and successful record on some of the most difficult cases, I know the system, criminal process, and parties involved. After all, when your attorney has a reputation as a skilled trial lawyer who fights for their clients, it makes all the difference.\n\nOur Strategy\n\nIt’s simple but effective – we listen. Many criminal lawyers don’t care enough or don’t take the time necessary to treat people like individuals. They forget what it’s like to be scared and not know what to expect from criminal charges. We are proud of our reputation for truly representing our clients’ best interests, standing up for them, and caring about them on a human level. We then leverage that reputation and all our skills to get fantastic results.\n\nOur Process\n\nWe understand where you’re coming from, carefully walk you through each step of the criminal process, and directly answer your questions. We start every case with an initial one-hour consultation. Most lawyers only give a quick sales pitch in a 15-minute call. We don’t do that — we’ll discuss what happened and give you an idea of what to expect, including possible outcomes and strategies. We’ll also talk about pricing. Once we’re engaged, our team will get to work right away, giving you feedback along the way so you know that we’re on it.\n\nWe’ll also familiarize you with our convenient online portal for existing clients and provide regular updates and clear lines of communication until we reach a satisfactory resolution.\n\nEducation\n\nBachelor of Arts, Texas Tech University, 2001\n\nJuris Doctorate, SMU Dedman School of Law, 2004\n\nBar Admission\n\nTexas\n\nUnited States District Court for the Northern and Eastern Districts\n\nMemberships\n\nTexas Bar Association\n\nTexas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association\n\nDallas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association\n\nNational Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers\n\nMeet Our Team"
