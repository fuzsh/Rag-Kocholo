        "text": "Michael Howard today announced he will stand down as Conservative leader, despite widespread calls for him to stay on during a crucial time for the party.\n\n\"I am 63 years old,\" he told supporters. \"At the time of the next general election in four or five years' time I will be 67 or 68 years old, and I believe that is simply too old to lead the party into government.\n\n\"So as I cannot fight the next election I believe it is better for me to stand down sooner, rather than later, so that the party can choose the next leader.\"\n\nMr Howard did, however, say that he would stay on as leader until the party had had a chance to review and rewrite the rules by which it elects its leader.\n\nThe Tories' cumbersome election rules were widely blamed for saddling the party with three years of Iain Duncan Smith, who defeated Ken Clarke in an all-member run-off in 2001.\n\nWhatever the outcome of the review, the shadow home secretary, David Davis - who increased his majority despite a strong Liberal Democrat challenge - will be seen as the favourite to succeed Mr Howard.\n\nOther contenders include the Tory co-chairman, Liam Fox, policy coordinator, David Cameron, and shadow chancellor, Oliver Letwin. The youthful Mr Cameron is believed to be Mr Howard's preferred successor.\n\nDespite each losing out twice in the past, the former chancellor, Ken Clarke, and former Welsh secretary, John Redwood, might not be able to resist another run.\n\nThe former foreign secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, who returned to the Commons last night after an eight year absence, might also fancy his chances, although the Tories are unlikely to choose another veteran from the Thatcher and Major years.\n\nMr Howard's announcement comes despite calls for him to stay on as leader for at least a year. Many senior Tories believe that John Major and William Hague's post-election resignations left the party rudderless at crucial times.\n\nRejecting those calls, Mr Howard told supporters that he wanted to live up to his promise to demand accountability from his ministers if he had made it to Downing Street.\n\n\"I said that if people do not deliver they go,\" he said. \"And for me, delivering meant winning the election. I did not do that. I did not do that despite my best efforts and I want to do now what is best for my party and over all, for my country.\"\n\nHe added: \"There is a good deal of dissatisfaction with the existing rules for choosing the leader of the party. So I intend to stay as leader until the party has had the opportunity to consider whether it wishes the rules to be changed and if so, how they should be changed.\"\n\nMr Howard concluded his statement by urging his colleagues to avoid the bloodletting of the past. \"We need to remain united, never to return to the bickering and back-stabbing of the past and we need to remain positive and outward looking,\" he said.\n\nThe party will now have to decide whether it wants to continue with Mr Howard's populist agenda. Many senior Tories felt deeply uneasy about his relentless focus on immigration and asylum during his brief tenure as leader.\n\nSome had even urged the Tory leader to abandon the so-called \"dog whistle\" strategy of Lynton Crosby, the electoral strategist Mr Howard imported from Australia, after it failed to produce any noticeable shift in the polls during the campaign."
