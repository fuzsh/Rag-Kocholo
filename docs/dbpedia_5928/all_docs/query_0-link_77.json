        "text": "LONDON — Tony Blair won a historic third term as prime minister yesterday but his Labour Party suffered a sharply reduced parliamentary majority in apparent punishment for going to war in Iraq, according to projections based on exit polls. A chastened Blair said \"we will have to respond to that sensibl wisely.\"\n\nSuch an outcome, if confirmed by the actual vote count, could set the stage for Blair to be replaced in midterm by a party rival such as Gordon Brown. As Treasury chief, Brown was widely credited for the strong economy that appears to have clinched Labour's victory, outweighing the bitterness many voters said they felt over Iraq.\n\n\"I know Iraq has been a divisive issue in this country, but I hope now that we can unite again and look to the future there and here,\" Blair said after results gave him a resounding victory in his constituency of Sedgefield in northeastern England, despite a challenge from the father of a British soldier killed in the Iraq war. Blair had to win his seat to keep his job as prime minister.\n\nThe BBC and ITV television stations projected Labour would win 358 seats in the 646-seat parliament, ahead of the Conservatives with 209. The Liberal Democrats - the only party to have opposed the Iraq war - were projected in third place with 53 seats, for them a disappointing gain of two seats.\n\nThe television projections, based on a survey of more than 16,000 voters in 115 closely contested districts, showed Labour with 37 percent of the popular vote, the lowest winning share ever.\n\nIf they are correct that Labour's majority will decline from the current 161 seats to 68, Blair could face difficulties controlling a faction of his party deeply disillusioned with his leadership, especially over Iraq.\n\nClare Short, who quit Blair's Cabinet over the war, said Blair had proved a liability.\n\n\"I think everyone agrees we would have done better with a different leader,\" Short said.\n\nBlair acknowledged the exit polls.\n\n\"It seems as if it's clear ... that the British people wanted the return of a Labour government but with a reduced majority, and we have to respond to that sensibl wisely,\" he said.\n\nFormer Conservative Defense Secretary Michael Portillo said the projected outcome could prove perilous for Blair.\n\n\"On these results I would have thought ... the Brown supporters will be wondering how quickly they can move Tony Blair out of Downing Street,\" he said.\n\nCounting was to continue through the night, and the winner would not be officially confirmed at least until this morning. The outgoing house had 659 seats, but the incoming Parliament will have 646 seats following an adjustment of several electoral boundaries.\n\nDiminished in victoryWhile Blair apparently was diminished in victory, Conservative leader Michael Howard gained stature as his party lost a third straight election but at least showed some signs of life.\n\nThe Conservatives were projected to take 33 percent. The Liberal Democrats were in third place with 22 percent.\n\nA big part of the Conservative strategy was to make it a referendum on Blair, urging voters to \"wipe the smirk\" off his face. Although Howard supported the Iraq war, he attacked Blair, accusing the prime minister of lying about intelligence and the legality of the invasion and lacking a plan to win the peace.\n\nBut Blair benefited from the Conservatives' even greater unpopularit a perception that the opposition is less capable of handling the economy.\n\nAnd the government's strong economic record - Britain's growth is high and unemployment low compared with much of the rest of the European Union - appears to have outweighed the resentments over Iraq. Labour is also credited with improving public services such as health and education through investment.\n\nNever before has the Labour Party won three straight elections. Margaret Thatcher accomplished the same feat for the Tories, the only other prime minister in modern British history to do so.\n\nStill, the projected victory for Labour yesterday stood in stark contrast to Blair's landslides in 1997 and 2001.\n\nUnder Britain's parliamentary system, in which Blair must command a majority in the House of Commons and some lawmakers often rebel against party discipline, the size of the majority is critical.\n\n\"In for a tough time\"William Jones, a political analyst at Manchester University, said that if it turned out to be \"anything under 100,\" Blair would be \"in for a tough time. Under 50 he will be in terrible difficulties. I think we will see him disappear very quickly.\"\n\nGeoff Andrews, a political analyst at the Open University, said a group of around 50 rebellious lawmakers within the Labour Party could exercise greater influence as its lead over the opposition slipped.\n\nBlair's government only narrowly defeated Labour revolts in the last parliament, including the crucial vote to go to war in Iraq and legislation to introduce tuition fees for university students, allow more private funding for state-run hospitals and toughen anti-terrorism laws.\n\nOther governments have coped with smaller majorities. Thatcher won with a majority of 43 in 1979. Her successor, John Major, struggled along with a majority of 21, which shrank toward zero at the end of his five-year term in 1997.\n\nThe margin of a Labour victory could have consequences for Britain's \"special relationship\" with the United States.\n\nThe battering that Blair took over Iraq during the campaign suggested that any future British leader will probably be wary of backing Washington militarily in the face of hostile domestic opinion.\n\nThis one's the lastBlair says this will be his last term. A politically weakened Blair would find it difficult to persuade British voters to approve a proposed constitution for the European Union - which requires ratification by all member states.\n\nDuring the campaign, the left-leaning Guardian newspaper offered free clothespins to any reader who requested one after a columnist urged reluctant Labour supporters to put aside opposition to the Iraq war and back the party for its domestic policies.\n\nIraq loomed large in voters' thinking.\n\n\"Iraq has been a big thing - trust,\" said Nicola Wyndham, 33, who voted for Labour four years ago but switched to the Liberal Democrats this time. \"He (Blair) has had eight years to make an impact and he really hasn't. There are still problems with health, education and crime.\"\n\n\"I've turned from Labour to Liberal Democrat because I don't really believe what Labour are saying,\" said Marguerite Hoy, 64, a voter in Braintree, northeast of London.\n\nDemocratic Party volunteers from the United States joined Blair's campaign, including Stan Greenberg, Zack Exley, Bob Shrum and Karen Hicks.\n\nRepublicans, the traditional allies of British Conservatives, were not much in evidence. Bush's White House has kept the Tories at arm's length in deference to his alliance with Blair.\n\nIn New York, two small makeshift grenades exploded early yesterday outside a building housing the British Consulate. The blast caused minor damage and no injuries.\n\n(Published: May 6, 2005)"
