        "text": "Michael Howard has been crowned the new Conservative leader - without a contest.\n\nThe fact that there had only been \"one valid nomination\" was announced by Sir Michael Spicer, chairman of the 1922 committee, at 12.20pm today, making Mr Howard the fourth Tory leader in the past six years.\n\nTo the banging of desks by Tory MPs in the committee room, Sir Michael said: \"Under the rules of the party I therefore declare Michael Howard is elected leader of the Conservative party and Her Majesty's opposition.\"\n\nThe new leader then left Westminster for a housing estate in Putney, South West London - the venue for his acceptance speech.\n\nIn a 15-minute address flanked by the party's prospective parliamentary candidates, notably women and those of ethnic origin, Mr Howard attempted to soften his image as an authoritarian rightwinger with jokes at his own expense and a declaration he was now \"a bit mellower\".\n\nHe joked that the concepts of choice and competition to Labour MPs were \"as welcome as a clove of garlic to Dracula\" - a reference to his own caricature in the tabloid newspapers.\n\nAnd he made refernce to his own origin as the child of refugees - but said it would be cruel for people in the third world to imagine they could come to Britain without restraints.\n\nMr Howard has given a round of TV interviews for broadcasters tonight, in which, asked if he really though he could become prime minister, Mr Howard said: \"I do. I really do.\"\n\nBut he said it was too early to make cast-iron promises of tax cuts in the next Tory manifesto, although it was a \"false choice\" to offer either better public services or tax cuts.\n\nMr Howard gave a short, untelevised address to Tory MPs after the closure of the poll was announced. He joked \"A week is a long time in politics,\" before warning colleagues: \"We are here to win.\n\n\"Because if we don't win we cannot put into practice the things we believe in for the good of our country. If we don't win we can achieve nothing - and we will be letting so many people down.\n\n\"No bystanders, no snipers from the sidelines. Every one of us a fully engaged participant in the great battle of hearts and minds and ideas.\"\n\nMr Howard's ascendancy comes on a day of deep divisions for the Labour government, with the chancellor, Gordon Brown, going public with his grievance against Tony Blair for leaving him off the party's national executive committee, while the cabinet met this morning on the divisive issue of ID cards.\n\nIt is only a week and a day since Iain Duncan Smith was ousted from the post as Tory boss, in a vote of confidence called just two years into his leadership.\n\nHowever, the succession has been surprisingly painless - even unifying - as potential rivals such as David Davis, Michael Ancram, Kenneth Clarke and even Michael Portillo ruled themselves out of the race. In Mr Davis' case, this was done within 45 minutes of IDS losing.\n\nIt later emerged that Mr Howard's leadership would not be subjected to a formal ratification ballot of rank-and-file Tories, but to an \"informal consultation\" with party members over the coming weekend.\n\nMr Howard is expected to announce his shadow cabinet on Friday. Two men tipped for promotion are the shadow home secretary, Oliver Letwin, and the shadow health minister, Liam Fox, who were among the first to declare their support for the leader-in-waiting.\n\nThere has been speculation that Mr Letwin could become shadow chancellor while Dr Fox - who ran Mr Howard's unsuccessful 1997 leadership bid - would become party chairman.\n\nHowever, much attention over the coming days is likely to focus on what role will be offered to Mr Davis - whose decision not to run for the leadership effectively left Mr Howard with a free run - and whether there will be a place for Mr Portillo, who has hinted he would like a return to the frontbench.\n\nSome pundits have tipped current party chairwoman, Theresa May, and the shadow foreign secretary, Mr Ancram, for the chop.\n\nMr Howard's former Home Office ministerial colleague, Ann Widdecombe, who in 1997 famously described Mr Howard as having \"something of the night\" about him, today said he would get her full support.\n\nIan Taylor, the pro-European MP for Esher and Walton, said he believed Mr Howard would take an inclusive approach.\n\nBut Labour's health secretary, John Reid, immediately took to the airwaves to dub the new Tory leader as \"Mr Poll Tax.\"\n\nHe said: \"The Conservative party have got the leader they deserve - a man who espouses extreme and unfair policies. He put another million on the dole queue and opposed the minimum wage.\"\n\nThe Liberal Democrats' parliamentary chairman, Matthew Taylor, today wrote to thousands of party activists urging them to redouble their efforts to \"decapitate\" the Tories by targeting the marginal seats of leading figures like Mr Howard in the next election.\n\nMr Taylor said voters should be reminded of Mr Howard's record of support for rail privatisation and VAT on fuel, his responsibility for the introduction of poll tax and council tax and his opposition to the minimum wage and statutory maternity rights.\n\nHe added: \"As party leader, Mr Howard will serve only to remind people why the last Conservative government was so unpopular.\n\n\"Michael Howard is unapologetic about his record as a minister in the last Tory government. Mr Howard may try to convince us that he has changed, that he wants to lead a party for 'all Britain and all Britons', but this is akin to the emperor's new clothes.\""
