        "text": "Tory leader David Cameron today vowed to win back seats in Newcastle and vowed: \"There are no no-go areas for the Conservative Party.\"\n\nIn an exclusive interview with the Chronicle he rejected his predecessor Michael Howard's claim that the Tories could win power at Westminster without MPs on Tyneside or the other major cities of Northern England and Scotland.\n\nThe new Conservative leader speaking before the Party Conference in Bournemouth conceded that he was prepared to keep the North East Regional Development Association if local people wished to retain it but had no apologies for the massive manufacturing job losses of the Thatcher Government years.\n\nMr Cameron took head on Mr Howard's claim to this newspaper, two years ago, that the Conservatives could form a Government without winning a seat in Newcastle.\n\nHe said: \"I don't agree with what he said and I've made that very clear.\n\n\"We need to win back seats in the Northern cities.\n\n\"If the Conservative Party is to win an election we have to deal with the problem that some people felt we were out of touch with their concerns.\n\n\"I think that problem was particularly severe in the North and Scotland. People need to know that we are concerned about their concerns.\n\n\"This conference is all about bringing back the Tories to the centre ground, the mainstream of British politics.\n\n\"We need to roll up our sleeves and win back seats in the big Northern cities.\n\n\"There are no no-go areas for the Conservative Party.\"\n\nOn the issue of the North East Regional Assembly and Regional Development Agency, Mr Cameron said: \"In those areas where people don't want them, they should go. We want to devolve power to the historic cities and counties of England the people understand and identify with.\n\n\"But in areas like the North East where people seem to like the Regional Assemblies and Development Agencies, such as in the North East region, they should stay. It's up to what people want.\"\n\nBut he had no apology for the massive job losses in the North East caused by the economic policies of Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s.\n\nHe said: \"I know it was difficult for people, especially in the North East. But I think she had to take tough decisions to curb the irresponsible power of the Trade Unions, and sort out inflation.\n\n\"I'm not going to make any apologies. I think Margaret Thatcher did things that were tough but necessary to make Britain economically great again and we have all benefited.\"\n\nAnd he backed tuition and top-up fees for students to keep English Universities like Newcastle at the top of the world league and said he was prepared to consider congestion charges to cut traffic jams in areas like Newcastle and Tyneside."
