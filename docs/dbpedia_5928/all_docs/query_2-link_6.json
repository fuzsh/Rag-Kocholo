        "text": "For a few brief moments on Wednesday evening, the Conservative Party looked at what it had done in deposing Iain Duncan Smith and felt sick. But the feeling soon wore off. Like one of those freak mornings when you wake after a night of bingeing feeling not hungover as you expected, but clear-headed and full of vim, so as Thursday dawned the Tory party stretched, looked about it and experienced an almost forgotten sensation: optimism.\n\nVery few had dared even to hope that the leader's demise could be followed by consensus regarding his successor. By Thursday, we realised that the nightmare of another long leadership election had been just a dream after all. If MPs had known that it could all be done so simply, perhaps Duncan Smith would have faced a challenge long before.\n\nThe day after his fall, I was asked on television what he had done wrong. It's true he achieved things. Our last conference was a policy-rich environment - we have a black candidate standing in the safe seat of Windsor - but what Iain fatally lacked was authority.\n\nPerhaps, just as Labour produced Blair and Brown in 1994, in an ideal world the Conservative Party would now produce two bright young things, unsullied by having held office in a previous administration. We have George Osborne and David Cameron, but they aren't ready. The party is in no mood to take risks again. In the last two leadership contests, we chose men with little experience, and that counted against them after their election. In the early months of their incumbency, they made mistakes and the press decided they weren't up to the job. It was a judgment against which no appeal was allowed.\n\nBy electing a politician with Michael Howard's experience (and intelligence), we get immediate benefits. This man has authority. For the first time in nearly 10 years, the leadership of the party is not going to be a topic for debate. Nor will the media be able to portray the leader as ridiculous.\n\nMichael knows how to use power, and the party would benefit from a rod of iron. I have worked closely with him, and know that he extracts the maximum leverage from any position. He is more responsible than any other individual for keeping Britain out of the single currency. His pressure, more than anyone else's, persuaded John Major to negotiate the opt-out from the Maastricht Treaty. The way that his electoral bandwagon carried all before it on Wednesday night was impressive. By Thursday, his supporters were handing out to new campaign team members folders full of MPs' telephone numbers that had obvi ously been well prepared. Such organisation and discipline bode well for how he will run the party.\n\nIt was difficult to find too many people who were disgruntled with the result. The media suggested that the rank-and-file membership would be irritated that the parliamentary party had ousted the man they elected. I doubt it. The activists had read the writing on the wall. Precisely because MPs detected that grass-roots support for Duncan Smith had ebbed away, the coup became possible. The consensus over his successor relieves the party members of the responsibility for perhaps choosing someone unacceptable to MPs.\n\nWhat's more, the fact that the leader will not this time be elected by the party's masses provides a useful precedent. We should now be able to dismantle the daft electoral system which pits MPs against party activists. When Iain Duncan Smith became leader, he had received the support of less than a third of Tory MPs. It was a crippling lack of mandate from his peer group.\n\nIt is true that Michael Howard's election does not thrill the party's left wing. But what it had feared most was that the party membership would enthrone David Davis. The Left is, in any case, used to bad news. Margaret Thatcher, William Hague and Iain Duncan Smith were all candidates of the Right. Even John Major, when first chosen, was thought to be the most right-wing contender on offer, and had Margaret Thatcher's endorsement.\n\nOn this occasion, the pro-Europeans would have opted for Ken Clarke. But there was no prospect of a consensus forming to elect him, and recent opinion polls confirmed that any other candidate would beat him in a run-off among the party rank and file, because for a majority of party members the most important thing is that the leader should be against the euro. That may prove the gulf that exists between party members and the electorate, but it remains a fact.\n\nThe 'modernisers' do not expect much movement in their direction from Michael Howard. He doesn't see the point in shifting the party on issues such as adoption by gay couples, though presumably Duncan Smith's grim experiences will suggest that he should avoid three-line whips on social issues.\n\nI have believed since 1997 that the Conservative Party has to make a huge public demonstration that it has changed, since people clearly didn't like the Conservatives when they booted them out of government and felt no more warmly when we were annihilated in 2001.\n\nLabour was lucky to have Clause 4 of its constitution, which bound it to taking control of the commanding heights of the economy. It was a totem that could be dragged out of the closet and ditched by a brave leader, and the ditching provided a neon sign that Labour had become 'new'. We don't have a Clause 4, and even if we did, the time for such a massive upheaval, with the attendant bloodletting, was the first half of the parliament, not now that an election looms. In any case, there is no majority in the parliamentary party for 'modernisation', and it never crossed my mind to stand for leader this time.\n\nHowever, the questions posed by modernisers, even if we are a minority, won't go away. Parties do have to reform or die. Tony Blair chose reform, as did Disraeli and Thatcher. Getting elected is not principally about policy. It's about whether the voters think you understand them and have their interests at heart. Do you look as though you are in politics to make life better for other people or not? Even after the selections of black and gay candidates, which Michael Howard has welcomed, the party's MPs are predominantly male, white, middle-aged and middle class. We need to broaden our appeal. Conservatives will need to show that they understand society today. Duncan Smith developed policies so that people could more easily opt out of the NHS and have more choice within education. Now Michael Howard will need to develop policies to help those who cannot opt out and who have no meaningful choices.\n\nHoward certainly hasn't taken time out to make TV documentaries about living as a single mother. We hear that in the Shadow Cabinet, he has remained socially conservative. Yet the passage of time at least has softened his image since he left the Home Office. His declaration speech resonated with social inclusiveness and Nicholas Boles, the gay prospective candidate for Hove, appeared to be part of Howard's transition team.\n\nA remarkable thing about Howard's unopposed election is that the party has relegated its ideological disputes to second place. In the last two leadership elections, the party opted for a relative unknown in preference to anyone whose career had been long enough to stake out clear positions and to make enemies. This time, the party has moved with a ruthless efficiency to depose a leader and replace him overnight in a way for which it was famed and admired 40 years ago. Perhaps we can even resurrect loyalty from that era. No wonder the Tory party felt optimistic. Even as Duncan Smith was being voted out, the prospect was more division and another leader elected on a minority of parliamentary votes. Four enfeebled leaders in a row must have cast doubt upon the party's chances of survival.\n\nDo we now expect to do more than survive and revive? To overturn Labour's huge majority in one go requires a swing that would be unprecedented. Howard's early pronouncements about the next election have been cautious. In recent months, Labour's poll ratings have tumbled, but the Tories have not reaped the advantage. Howard calculates that we could pick up some of those Labour defectors if the media gives out the message that we have a serious Prime Ministerial candidate. He is not going to have the media falling over each other to get him elected as Blair had before 1997, but he will have the solid support of the right-wing press, on his terms not theirs, and he will at least get a hearing from Rupert Murdoch.\n\nThe Tory party would be wrong to think of Howard as merely a caretaker. Before too long, his age will become an issue, but here is a man who has waited a long time for a crack at the top and he will put down strong roots as leader. Fortunately, he is self-confident enough to be able to appoint people of stature to his shadow team without being afraid of them. I even think that he will be sufficiently magnanimous and forward-looking to plan for his eventual succession. If Howard guarantees our survival; the Osbornes and Camerons will reveal our long-term future."
