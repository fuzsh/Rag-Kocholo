        "text": "BOURNEMOUTH, England, Oct. 5 - Michael Howard, the leader of Britain's Conservative Party, urged Tories on Tuesday to focus on discontent with Prime Minister Tony Blair's domestic record and his failure to \"tell the truth\" in the months before the war in Iraq as the best strategy for contesting the national elections expected next spring.\n\nIn his first address to the annual Conservative Party gathering, Mr. Howard also sought to stem defections to the upstart U.K. Independence Party, which has eroded Conservatives' base by taking a hard line against immigration and membership in the European Union.\n\nThe elections, Mr. Howard indicated, will serve as a referendum on Mr. Blair and his Labor Party's policies that would provide the Tories an opportunity to campaign on a platform of cutting taxes, fighting crime, controlling immigration and scaling back engagement with Europe.\n\nCrucially, Mr. Howard rejected a frontal assault against Mr. Blair over Iraq, the source of broad disaffection in Britain. He mentioned the war in a few paragraphs near the end of his speech.\n\n\"I believe it was right to go to war,\" he said. \"That's a controversial view.\"\n\n\"Many people would prefer me to say something else,\" he added, contending that \"the world is a better place without Saddam Hussein.\"\n\nHowever, in one jab at Mr. Blair, he said: \"Tony Blair did not tell the truth. He did not give a truthful account of the intelligence he received. He did not behave as a British prime minister should.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
