        "text": "Michael Howard yesterday took a significant step towards ending his image as a hardline former home secretary when he endorsed same-sex partnerships.\n\nIn a break with William Hague and Iain Duncan Smith, who both fell foul of Tory modernisers over touchstone moral issues, the Conservative leader showed his support for changing values when he declared that many families do not conform to tradition.\n\nMr Howard has already announced that Tory MPs will be allowed a free vote on the government's civil partnerships bill, which will allow same-sex couples to register their relationship - a move which secured him the support of the Michael Portillo wing of the party.\n\nBut in a lengthy speech yesterday to Policy Exchange, the centre-right thinktank set up by Mr Portillo's supporters, Mr Howard went a step further. \"Families are changing,\" the Conservative leader said. \"Not all conform to the traditional pattern. I continue to believe that the conventional marriage and family is the best environment within which to bring up children.\n\n\"But many couples now choose not to marry. And more same-sex couples want to take on the shared responsibilities of a committed relationship.\"\n\nIn a nod to Tory traditional ists, who will feel uncomfortable to hear their leader espousing same-sex partnerships, Mr Howard insisted that he did not support gay marriages.\n\n\"Civil partnership differs from marriage. Marriage is a separate and special relationship which we should continue to celebrate and sustain. To recognise civil partnership is not, in any way, to denigrate or downgrade marriage. It is to recognise and respect the fact that many people want to live their lives in different ways.\"\n\nHis remarks came during a speech, entitled The British Dream, which was billed as his attempt to flesh out his political philosophy after he set out his values in his \"I Believe\" declaration in the new year. Mr Howard made clear that, while he may have softened some of his views, amid deep social changes in recent years, he remains true to his core belief that the state should play as small a role as possible.\n\nIn his opening remarks he recalled how he wrote an essay in the late 1950s, when he applied to Cambridge University, called Why I am an Angry Young Man. \"I saw Britain as a country too stratified, too hidebound, where people tended to be judged on their background, not on their worth,\" he said.\n\nSociety had changed in many ways since then, but \"many of the constraints\" were still in place. \"We have a state that does too much, that interferes too much, that is too unaccountable,\" he said.\n\nHe outlined a series of areas in which a future Tory government would introduce \"radical reform\" to reduce the role of the state and hand power back to the people.\n\nOn healthcare he admitted that Margaret Thatcher had failed to overcome the \"powerful obstacles\" standing in the way of reform, Mr Howard pledged that NHS patients would be given the right to choose where to have an operation.\n\nOn education Mr Howard, a grammar schoolboy, pledged to reverse the \"rush to uniformity and a levelling down from excellence\" - which he blamed on the creation of comprehensive schools.\n\nAnd on tax, he stopped short of offering a clear pledge to cut taxes. But he described high taxes as \"corrosive\". \"When taxes rise too high, they start to bring people low,\" he said.\n\nOliver Letwin, the shadow chancellor, will make his first announcement on taxing and spending next week. As a first step, he and Mr Howard will today outline an initiative to cut government spending by pledging to cut the number of civil servants.\n\nÂ· Andrew Neil, the former editor of the Sunday Times and editor-in-chief of the Scotsman titles, is to chair the final selection meeting which will choose a successor to Michael Portillo as Tory candidate in the blue chip Kensington and Chelsea parliamentary seat in west London.\n\nSir Malcolm Rifkind, the former foreign secretary, is the most prominent name among the seven candidates shortlisted.\n\nBanana skins: a new approach\n\nEurope: Mr Howard will announce this week that he is to reverse Iain Duncan Smith's plan to withdraw from the centre-right group in the European parliament. This will delight pro-European Tories, who feared being marginalised in the parliament, but is unlikely to upset Eurosceptics, because Mr Howard has won an opt-out from the group's support for a federal Europe.\n\nTroublesome Tories: Unlike Mr Duncan Smith, Mr Howard showed a ruthless streak last week by killing off a campaign by the disgraced former cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken to resume his career as a Tory MP, even though they are friends.\n\nTax and spend: Mr Duncan Smith tried to craft a distinctive image by talking of tax cuts. Mr Howard has expressed support for lower taxes, but insists that he cannot yet offer any firm commitments."
