He was one of only a handful of British politicians to serve in all of the four great offices of state (Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary, Chancellor and Prime Minister) and as such was an influential political figure during the Conservative government's of 1996 until he retired from government in 2007.\n\nHe was considered Portillo's natural successor following the resignation of Ken Clarke in 2003, and was in effect the de facto Deputy Prime Minister during the last two years of the Portillo government.\n\nHoward won the leadership election that ensued following Portillo's surprise resignation in February 2005, and led the Conservatives to a victory - albeit with a drastically reduced majority - in the May 2005 general election.\n\nHis leadership marked a slight turn to the right, particularly over Europe.\n\nPressure mounted on him to resign following disappointing results in the 2006 local elections.\n\nIn May 2007 he resigned, feeling he would be unable to lead the Conservatives to a fourth successive general election victory, but remained acting leader until his successor was elected.\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nEarly Political Career[]\n\nHome Secretary 1996 - 1999[]\n\nHoward served as Home Secretary for most of the Portillo government's first term. Being seen as a strong law-and-order figure, Howard was considered Portillo's largest concession to the hard right of the party.\n\nForeign Secretary 1999 - 2001[]\n\nIn the reshuffle that followed the resignation of John Redwood, Howard replaced Redwood as Foreign Secretary.\n\nChancellor of the Exchequer 2001 - 2005[]\n\n2005 Conservative Party Leadership Election[]\n\nFollowing Portillo's resignation announcement Howard was the immediate frontrunner for the leadership, so much so that other potential candidates David Cameron, Liam Fox and William Hague were quick to endorse him.\n\nHoward officially announced his candidacy on 17th February, stating that if elected he would continue to promote \"new blood\" into the cabinet. The remark backfired somewhat, with Private Eye portraying him as a Vampire.\n\nHe faced Kenneth Clarke, David Davis, Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Ancram in the first ballot, with Alan Duncan announcing his intention to stand before withdrawing.\n\nHoward led on the first ballot.\n\nPrime Minister[]\n\nCabinet[]\n\nPrime Minister - Michael Howard\n\nDeputy Prime Minister -\n\nChancellor of the Exchequer - Oliver Letwin\n\nForeign Secretary - William Hague\n\nHome Secretary - David Davis\n\nDefence Secretary - Liam Fox\n\nHealth Secretary - Andrew Lansley\n\nEducation Secretary - David Cameron\n\nEmployment Secretary - Iain Duncan Smith\n\nEnvironment Secretary -\n\nBusiness Secretary - George Osborne\n\nTransport Secretary - Theresa May\n\nScottish Secretary -\n\nWelsh Secretary -\n\nPost Premiership[]\n\nHoward remained a prominent backbencher for the rest of the parliament, but announced he would step down at the next election.\n\nIn 2010 he was created Baron Howard of Lympe."
