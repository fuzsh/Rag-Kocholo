        "text": "In 2009 when I was just a young, naïve, and arrogant teenager, not even at the age of 18, the BBC launched a series of documentaries to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Margaret Thatcher’s coming to power.\n\nLooking back now after six very long years of feasting on the political delights that Youtube has to offer, one documentary always stood out to me for its depth, honesty and highly interesting presenter. That person was the former Conservative defence secretary Michael Portillo, and his documentary was the aptly titled: “Portillo on Thatcher”\n\nFor those who are unaware, Michael Portillo was a young activist in the Labour Party of old before switching to the Tories in the run-up to the 1979 general election after being impressed by Thatcher’s leadership. He would eventually become an MP and slowly be promoted through the Tory rank and file until eventually reaching the cabinet under John Major’s premiership. The loss of his seat during the 1997 Labour landslide would be dubbed the “Portillo” moment, with people all across the country gleefully asking the morning after “Were you up for Portillo?”\n\nHis personality and appearance during his time in office came to become, in Portillo’s own words, the “embodiment of what millions of people across Britain deemed as the arrogance of the Conservatives.” The loss of his seat would force him to take a sabbatical from politics which, in turn, would help him to form a campaign to modernise a badly defeated Conservative party. But his push for reform would fail to emerge, despite his best efforts, and would lead the Conservatives to three successive election defeats and only the largest number of seats in 2010, narrowly falling short of a majority.\n\nHis documentary is the antithesis to the four-part “Labour: The Wilderness Years” as it shows the inner workings of the Conservative Party during its 18 years in office. Both almost act as stark contrasted documentary playmates but unlike Labour’s series, this standalone feature is focused really on just one person: The Iron Lady. What begins as a championing by Portillo of her legacy slowly becomes a cerebral warning to future leaders of the Conservative party of her long shadow. A shadow that would come to haunt at least three future party leaders and cause in-fighting that would last for well over a decade.\n\nThe film begins with a brief biography of Portillo’s rise in politics, first becoming an MP in 1984 after the murder of the incumbent by the IRA. We see a rather bizarre, equine figure, wearing his trusted blue rosette and winning the by-election easily, all the while championing Thatcher whilst she was still in her prime. He describes her as the “conviction” politician, with plenty of late 70’s, early 80’s stock footage used of her racing around the country, campaigning for every vote possible. Portillo’s narration is often quite playful in its tone. He spares no sharpness when describing her acerbic wit and personality but he also talks openly about his private feelings towards her when he was just a fresh recruit. In short, he like many others, in his own words, was “smitten” by her.\n\nWhat is so wonderful about the documentary is that there are truly few others which offer such an honest appraisal of the former prime minister by one of her own colleagues. I have seen countless programmes that feature the likes of Norman Tebbit, John Major etc. but none were made by one of her own political protégés. Portillo not only manages to involve several of the high profile Conservative ministers from the time, but he also interviews many of his less well-known compatriots. This is symbolised during an amusing moment when the then shadow minister Ed Vaizey admits confusion to Portillo over a song by the reggae band The Beat and their underground hit “Stand Down Margaret”. His confusion lied in the fact that he didn’t understand what the band had against Princess Margaret, as he simply could not understand how anyone could have disliked Mrs Thatcher.\n\nBut these interviews also provide a far rarer glimpse into the innermost thoughts that some in her cabinet had during her premiership. David Mellor openly admits to disliking her policy of having “Wet’s” and “Dry’s” dividing the party, and sopping wet icon Ken Clarke is incredibly brash about the time when her leadership came under threat from Michael Heseltine in late 1990. A young looking David Cameron is also featured as the recently elected new leader of the party. Cameron’s testimony on camera is far more cautious than his other MP’s, partly because his political career began decades after Thatcher was in office. But Portillo is merciless in his candid attitude towards discussing the Iron Lady. At no point does he simply glorify her premiership and ask other Conservatives to do the same, he is simply honest about the legacy she left behind, not just in Britain but within the very party she had been thrown out of.\n\nThat honesty is sharply delivered with the great help of Peter Greenaway collaborator Michael Nyman, whose musical extracts help to give the film all the more operatic and theatrical presence. This works particularly well when the documentary shifts focus from Thatcher and begins to analyse John Major’s time in office, as we hear the strident piano notes banging together to create an unpleasant melody. The juxtaposition of this score over footage of Thatcher arriving in Paris for what would become her last international summit, as well as the destructive riots in London after the announcement of the Poll tax, works wonders.\n\nMajor is portrayed by Portillo as a rather tragic figure for the Conservatives. A kind, polite, and deeply sensitive man, Major was plagued by the ruthless divisions that seemed to rule over the party in the years after Thatcher was ousted. It was under Major that Portillo was finally made a cabinet minister, who, as Portillo later laments, would go on to cause troubles for the Prime-minister after disagreements over Europe. These “troubles” from certain ministers would become infamous after a hot microphone recorded John Major describing several in his cabinet as “bastards”. But the real difficulties the party faced during this seven year period under Major are brought to bear under Portillo’s expert interviewing technique. Former Chancellor Norman Lamont, Michael Howard, and Ken Clarke are among many who attempt to analyse the difficulties that Major suffered, describing the brutal divisions as one of “Civil War” over many issues, but the biggest always being and remaining to be: Europe.\n\nMajor had at least managed, much to the surprise of the party, to win the 1992 general election, albeit with a much smaller majority than Thatcher had ever had to endure. However, after five tumultuous years in office, the party was headed for a disastrous meltdown at the infamous ’97 election when Labour, under Tony Blair, went on to win a 179 seat majority. It was the worst result the Tories had ever received, their popular share of the vote the lowest since the early 19th century and their total number of seats the lowest since 1906. This tragedy for the Tories would bring about a new leader who was young, Northern, energetic and willing to bring what would be dubbed as “a fresh start” for the party.\n\nWilliam Hague became the leader of the Conservatives in ’97 and first began his premiership as a modernising force for the party. Realising the utter destruction of their base, he understood that if the Tories, in Portillo’s own words, “endlessly harkened back to the glory days of Margaret Thatcher” the party would be doomed from the start of the next Parliament. His problem, much like Major’s, was that the bitter divisions that existed for his predecessor were still alive and well, brought about by this single woman, whose grasp of the party was as strong as it had ever been. Featured on film is a rather embarrassing piece of footage of Hague walking with Thatcher when suddenly a keen journalist asks the Iron Lady about his new approach to modernization, dubbed: “A Fresh Start”. “Mrs Thatcher a new start?” Her reply was one of bemusement. “A New start? What was wrong with the old one, we didn’t do too badly in my time!” Hague laughs awkwardly but the real power of such a short piece of video lies in how it perfectly encapsulated the problem the new leader faced.\n\nPortillo also laments about his time in Hague’s shadow cabinet after he won a by-election in one of the Conservatives safest seats, Kensington and Chelsea, in 1999. He describes his time as shadow chancellor as the only unhappy experience he ever had in politics but praises Hague’s appearance in his documentary as a tribute to his decency. Both wanted to reform the party, but Hague, unlike Portillo, was trapped by the long shadow that Thatcher seemed to have cast. Forced by the right of the party to give up his modernising agenda, Hague would run on whatKen Clarke describes as the “quaintest” election campaign in modern history: keeping the pound. The result was a near calamity for the party, winning only one net seat, practically a repeat of the previous election. And with the results in Hague was out, with Iain Duncan Smith, a right-wing Thatcherite, chosen as leader.\n\nThe documentary at this point is running out of time and so Portillo quickly sums up how his failure to win the leadership, by a loss of just one vote, would force him to quit politics. However, his views on Ian Duncan Smith’s very brief time as leader are made well-known thanks to David Mellor describing his appointment as the most lamentable choice ever conceived. The party would oust Smith in 2003 and replace him with Michael Howard who would also lose the upcoming 2005 general election. Howard, who is featured heavily in the film, sums up his time by saying “I didn’t think I was the best person to convince people that the Conservative Party had changed”. Indeed he was not as the Tories would lose a third successive general election and skip a generation in appointing David Cameron.\n\nPortillo’s film is a tribute to political documentaries. He is utterly ruthless in his honest approach to portraying the Iron Lady. Her greatness strengths, her most terrible weaknesses, her stranglehold on the party after being thrown out by it, are all told with impeccable editing and interviewing techniques. His subjects on camera are candid and at times amusing to watch when giving their analyses of the party’s past, but why this documentary stands out truly is due to Portillo himself. A man once loathed by many for his appearance, overlong name, and public attitude is now seen as an incredibly media savvy political commentator. He doesn’t hold his party up to the standards of the heavens, but he certainly points out what he feels were its greatest strengths and failings. His summary of the Iron Lady, however, acts as a potent warning to leaders of all political establishments. If you are lucky enough to have a leader that wins, changes the course of history, and indeed the country, you should always be very, very careful about what to do with them once they are out of office."
