        "meta_description": "When John Major came to office, the Conservatives had already been in power for eleven years and the new Prime Minister tried to strike a balance between continuity (building on the Thatcherite legacy) and change (with a return to the rhetoric of “One-Nation Toryism”). His attitude and choices were partly influenced by the context, for he stood at the helm of both a party and a government sailing in a sea of challenges : Gulf War, economic crisis, splits over Europe, sleaze scandals, rise of New Labour and setting up of Eurosceptic parties, etc. In this context, the Conservatives’ communication strategy focused on John Major’s conciliatory figure and on the “caring” Conservatism he was supposed to incarnate. This article examines the relationship between the Conservative Party’s ideological positioning and the image it tried to project through the various speeches delivered by John Major. It also analyses how John Major’s persona was created and how he constructed a first-person narrative : that of the Brixton kid who would be Prime Minister.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\n1Margaret Thatcher wrote about her Downing Street years :\n\nMy problem was the lack of a successor whom I could trust to keep my legacy secure and to build on it. I liked John Major and thought that he genuinely shared my approach. But he was relatively untested and his tendency to accept the conventional wisdom had given me pause for thought.\n\n3Between 1990 and 1997, John Major was at the helm of both a government and a party facing tough challenges : the Gulf War, “Black Wednesday”, a party split over the Maastricht Treaty, the rise of New Labour and the emergence of Eurosceptic single-issue parties, etc. The reorientations that took place under his premiership may therefore, at first sight, be interpreted as an idiosyncratic response to these challenges. They actually went beyond a mere strategic and rhetorical repositioning for they affected the ideological foundations upon which the party’s identity rests, and altered its image among voters.\n\n4In this context, the Prime Minister emerged as a conciliatory figure whose aim was to keep his party together and to guarantee the unity of the nation in the face of mounting difficulties. Communication therefore focused on the leader’s persona (his public personality and image) by drawing at once on his professional experience and on his personal life. Far from being spontaneous, this image is the product of a carefully planned process. This article examines how this image was created and projected through the various media used by the party for its inward and outward communication (memos, conference speeches, party political broadcasts, etc.). It also reflects on whether this image was coherent or at odds with the political agenda of the Conservative Party under John Major.\n\nThatcherism without Thatcher\n\nTheir [Labour’s] plans to set up a tax raising parliament in Scotland would lead, not immediately but certainly, to Scotland becoming independent. Once broken the United Kingdom will never be the same again. And Labour would take us into a federal Europe – much more power for Brussels, much less power for Britain. So, two threats : a British parliament weakened at home and weakened abroad, two irrevocable changes [...] (PEB, 29/04/97).\n\nBack to Basics : Back to One-Nation Toryism?\n\n9As John Major arrived at Downing Street, the Conservative Party issued a memorandum that set out its “guiding principles for the 1990s” and which stated :\n\n1. That we are a national Party,\n\n2. That we give opportunity and power to the people,\n\n3. That we need a strong and stable economy in which the wealth that is created is owned more widely,\n\n4. That we want a Citizen’s Charter to deliver quality in every part of the public service,\n\n20 “Guiding Principles for the 1990s”, CPA, PPB 184.\n\n5. And that we work, not for short-term gain, but for the long-term good of the nation as a whole .\n\n10Out of this list, the implementation of the Citizen’s Charter was the most concrete element. It illustrated the government’s ambition to improve its image regarding public services and to meet the electorate’s demand in this domain. On the other hand, it revealed the ambiguity of the new leadership’s position vis-à-vis the Thatcher legacy. A year after the passing of the act that introduced market rules within the National Health Service (NHS and Community Care Act), John Major declared at the 1991 party conference held in Blackpool :\n\n21 CPA, PPB 146.\n\n[...] let me say now, once and for all, and without qualification : Under this government, the National Health Service will continue to offer free hospital treatment to everyone .\n\n11This commitment was repeated all through the Major years. In 1997 the outgoing Prime Minister even put forward the idea that the fruits of economic growth were to be equally shared between the members of the national community, as he promised :\n\n22 This follows the excerpt that was commented upon in the previous section. John Major’s speech the (...)\n\n[…] we’ll keep the economy strong. But what will we do with it? Let me tell you. In the next five years, I intend to help bring the have-nots into the golden circle of the haves. I’ll safeguard still further the things that matter most to you and to me : schools, police, pensions and, of course, the health service (PEB 29/04/97) .\n\nNew Labour, New Danger for the Conservatives ?\n\n17Over the same period, education and health gained salience within public opinion whereas the government’s achievements in these domains were deemed rather poor. On the other hand, with the end of the Cold War, national security ceased to be a major electoral issue contrary to what it had been during the 1987 campaign. Finally, the “back to basics” campaign, which had been commonly understood as a moral crusade, severely backfired as the last years of the Major government were marked by a general impression of “sleaze” (sex and “cash for questions” scandals).\n\n20This situation forced John Major to enter a leadership contest in the summer of 1995. He won against the Eurosceptic John Redwood but nevertheless found himself at the head of a party that had trouble defining its own identity. In such a context it fell to the Prime Minister to occupy the forefront of the media scene so as to incarnate a unified party and put himself forward as a head of government responsible for the nation’s cohesion in times of hardship. This explains why the communication of the Conservative Party focused to such an extent on John Major’s personality.\n\n“The Tories’ best card” : A third-person account\n\n48 Interview with Jonathan Hill, op. cit. It is relevant to point out that Labour’s Neil Kinnock app (...)\n\nWhat was clear, very quickly to me, was that, given that he was known as being a grey and not very articulate man, our campaign was thought to be boring, and this was a fair criticism. The only time he came to life was when he was with people, when he had people heckling, shouting at him, pushing, when it was all a bit on the edge. And he liked that. It brought him to life. He spoke better. His voice became better. He was more relaxed. His voice became deeper. He became animated .\n\n“I am the message” : A first-person narrative\n\n27In 1992 John Major was taking stock of the situation and calling for a renewal of confidence :\n\nIt’s now sixteen months since I became your Prime Minister. In that time I’ve been able to lay out the policies that will take us into the future. On Thursday, you must decide whether I continue that work (PEB, 7/04/92, our emphasis).\n\n28Five years later he suggested a direct link between personalities and major political decisions :\n\nIn six weeks’ time, the British Prime Minister – myself or Mr Blair – will go to Amsterdam to negotiate a treaty and what’s decided there will determine whether we go down the route to a federal Europe or whether we say ‘no’. I don’t believe a federal Europe is right for Britain, I shall say ‘no’. Mr Blair – Mr Blair will say ‘yes’ (PEB, 25/04/97, our emphasis).\n\n30The PEB entitled The Journey (aired on 18th March 1992) perfectly illustrates John Major’s recourse to the first-person pronoun to construct a narrative that involves characters with whom most people may be able to identify, and situations which they are likely to have experienced themselves. The broadcast was directed by John Schlesinger (Midnight Cowboy, Marathon Man, etc.) and was filmed as a documentary on John Major’s metaphorical “journey” from his childhood house on Coldharbour Lane, in the working class neighbourhood of Brixton in South London, all the way up to Downing Street.\n\n31The film shows the Prime Minister going back to Brixton, meeting people in the streets and remembering anecdotes about his passion for cricket, his marriage, his first soapbox, his years as a Lambeth councillor, etc. These scenes alternate with excerpts from an interview carried out indoors in which a casually dressed John Major defends his political beliefs about inflation, education, health, socialism, free choice and the free market economy. But as the whole discourse is based on personal anecdotes, his convictions appear to be steeped in experience rather than dogma. It is all the more evident since this experience (being unemployed, taking care of one’s parents when they fall ill, etc.) is likely to have been shared by most viewers :\n\n55 This excerpt can be seen at http ://observatoire.univ-tln.fr (Excerpt n°5).\n\nI think every family has their own experiences of the NHS and will draw upon it. That’s certainly true in my case. In their later years, both my parents were ill. They needed protracted medical treatment, both in hospital from time to time and also direct through their general practitioners. And they got it, excellent treatment; treatment that we couldn’t possibly have provided for ourselves and I saw then, at a very young age and at very close quarters, the peace of mind that the availability of that treatment actually provided to my parents and to the rest of my family. I want to make sure that’s there for everyone else. The Patient’s Charter attempts to make sure that the excellent medical service is also provided as a personal service with the greatest possible dignity .\n\n58 Speech at the Blackpool party conference, October 1991. CPA, PPB 146.See also www.johnmajor.co.uk (...)\n\nThis is the first Conference I have addressed as Leader of the Conservative Party. It is hard to explain quite how I feel about that. It is a long road from Colharbour Lane to Downing Street. It is a tribute to the Conservative Party that that road can be travelled. […] We don’t need lectures in the Conservative Party about opportunity. We are the Party of opportunity .\n\nConclusion\n\n35During the seven years of his premiership, John Major was at the head of a party that needed to reaffirm its “guiding principles for the 1990s” but became increasingly embroiled in internal disputes. His policies bore obvious signs of continuity with the preceding decade but his personality provided a sharp contrast to the flamboyance of the Iron Lady. The new leader did not possess the charisma of his predecessor, nor did his agenda have the same programmatic clarity as the Thatcherite project. He nevertheless managed to come across as less dogmatic and more “caring”."
