        "text": "Included with General Admission\n\nThe outlandish and iconoclastic artist Salvador Dalí (1904–1989) is famous for his bizarre imagery and distinctive Surrealist vision. He was, however, also deeply rooted in tradition. Dalí studied, emulated, and indeed revered his European predecessors from centuries past, embracing influences from Spain, the Low Countries, and Italy throughout his long career.\n\n“Dalí: Disruption and Devotion” juxtaposes nearly 30 paintings and prints on loan from the Salvador Dalí Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida, with European masterpieces from the MFA’s collection, including portraits, religious scenes, and still-lifes by El Greco, Orazio Gentileschi, and Velázquez, among others. In addition to these illuminating pairings, the exhibition features some of Dalí’s best-known works, such as Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory (1952–54). Other examples reveal optical illusions and double images—hallmarks of Surrealism—while the monumental Ecumenical Council (1960) highlights Dalí’s technical mastery. By seeing him in dialogue with great painters and printmakers who came before him, visitors can experience a unique take on one of the most celebrated avant-garde artists of the 20th century."
