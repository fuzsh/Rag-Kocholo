        "text": "Michael Howard's leadership hopes were once sunk by the infamous remark that he has \"something of the night\" about him.\n\nHis eventual performance in the top job should prevent Ann Widdecombe's jibe becoming his political epitaph.\n\nAs leader Mr Howard, in the words of a shadow cabinet colleague, pulled the party \"back from the abyss\".\n\nOnly the timing of his announcement that he will stay on while the leadership rules are reformed comes as a surprise.\n\nAfter taking charge at one of the party's darkest hours he was never going to leave others to pick up the pieces of a third poll defeat.\n\nAnd at the age of 63, Mr Howard always knew this election was his one shot at becoming Prime Minister.\n\nIt is a chance he must have dreamed of since his days as part of the 1960s Cambridge Conservative \"Mafia\", which became so prominent in Margaret Thatcher and John Major's governments.\n\nHowever, the inevitable disappointment must be tempered by the knowledge that it could have been so much worse.\n\nHe restored Conservatives' self-belief, ran the most effective campaign for decades and while the poll gains were modest, they were the first the party has made since 1987.\n\nHowever, Mr Howard left himself no wiggle room when he repeated his threat to sack anyone who failed to deliver just four days before polling.\n\nWhile he championed the Tory Timetable for Action, it was suggested, wife Sandra had a timetable for retirement.\n\nHis dignified speech saying that, for the good of party and country, he will stand down may yet eclipse the draconian reputation built as an authoritarian Home Secretary.\n\nHe then declared \"prison works\" and the crime figures bore him out, registering an unprecedented cut in crime.\n\nDespite this the public did not warm to him and the enduring memory became Mr Howard refusing to answer the same question 14 times on BBC2's Newsnight.\n\nWith Ms Widdecombe's remark ringing in people's ears, he finished fifth out of five in the 1997 leadership contest.\n\nMr Howard told Lord Lamont, former flatmate and Cabinet colleague, that he would never stand again.\n\nThe ascent that began with election as MP for Folkestone and Hythe in 1983 appeared to have ended.\n\nIt was an impressive career for the son of Jewish immigrant parents, who was born on July 7, 1941, and raised in Llanelli, South Wales.\n\nFather Bernard Hecht, a Romanian, escaped Europe before the war and married Hilda Kurshion, the daughter of Russian emigres who fled the pogroms, arriving here in the 1900s when she was six months old.\n\nMr Howard attended a grammar school in Llanelli where he eschewed the traditional Welsh passions of socialism and rugby for Conservatism and football (Liverpool and Swansea).\n\nAt Cambridge he read economics before transferring to law and joined the party where he met the set that included Leon Britain, Kenneth Clarke, Norman Fowler and John Selwyn Gummer as well as Norman Lamont.\n\nWhile Cambridge contemporaries found seats relatively quickly the future party leader had to wait until he was over 40.\n\nIn the meantime he met model Sandra Paul, then still married to husband number three. Doubters were proved wrong and they are clearly still devoted after 30 years of marriage.\n\nThe couple have raised daughter Larissa and son Nick as well as Sholto Douglas-Home, a son from her first marriage who accompanied them on their honeymoon.\n\nWhen predecessor Iain Duncan Smith asked Mr Howard to return to the frontbench in 2001 Sandra was said to be reluctant.\n\nHowever, he answered the call and quickly shone in a shadow cabinet short on experience.\n\nAlthough he went out of his way to voice support for Mr Duncan Smith, he quickly came to be seen as a leadership contender.\n\nWhen Conservative MPs found the courage to despatch IDS they united behind him and, good as his word, did not have to contest the leadership.\n\nAs a potential Prime Minister he knew his character was under scrutiny as never before and responded accordingly.\n\nHe reputedly asked a friend in the media how he could improve his image and was told: \"Never leave the house without Sandra.\"\n\nHe has gone much further. Tory Spring conference saw the children publicly praising him as a father and the family were also pressed into action on the campaign trail.\n\nHowever, the attacks on Tony Blair's integrity and tough talk on immigration reinforced his tough image.\n\nAs one senior frontbencher said during the election: \"It is amazing that someone so well rounded and human simply doesn't come over like that.\"\n\nAs he took on Tony Blair, Mr Howard made a virtue of his directness, saying: \"What you see is what you get.\"\n\nBy that he was selling himself short."
