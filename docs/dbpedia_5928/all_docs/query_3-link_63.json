        "text": "B. Michael Howard, a painstaking man of the theater who worked on both sides of the footlights in Tulane Summer Lyric Theatre productions for 46 years, died Aug. 12 at Touro Infirmary. He was 79.\n\nHoward played Buffalo Bill in Summer Lyric’s first offering, “Annie Get Your Gun,” in 1968. From then on, he not only acted in Summer Lyric plays, including “Oliver!” and “The Music Man,” but was also director and vocal-music director, said Charlie Farve Hayes, operations manager for Summer Lyric and Tulane University’s Department of Music.\n\n“He was multifaceted,” said Beverly Trask, a professor of dance at Tulane. “He could design costumes, and I saw him play the piano, conduct with his head and give light cues all at the same time.”\n\nIn 1997, he succeeded his mentor, Frank Monachino, as Summer Lyric’s director, a position he held until he retired from Summer Lyric in 2014. In addition to offering musical-theater mainstays such as “The Student Prince” and “Carousel,” Howard produced contemporary fare such as “Company,” and he staged the massive musical “Sunset Boulevard” on the small Dixon Hall stage.\n\nIn whatever Howard did, “he was definitely a perfectionist,” Hayes said. “He did not believe it was possible to over-rehearse. He wanted everything to be right.”\n\nPeople who worked with Howard were accustomed to hearing him say, “Once again,” Hayes said. That will be the title of his musical memorial service, which will be held Sept. 24 at 2 p.m. in Dixon Hall.\n\nHoward provided “the most detailed and the most knowing direction I’ve seen a director give in musical theater,” said David Cuthbert, a retired Times-Picayune critic who not only reviewed Summer Lyric productions but also wrote about rehearsals.\n\n“Some of these guys only care if the lights are on and the scenery doesn’t fall down,” Cuthbert said. “Michael was telling a story, and he wanted every bit of the story told.”\n\nHoward — he never used Byron, his first name — was born in McLaurin, Mississippi. Because he could play the piano by ear, he was playing for church services when he was 5, Trask said.\n\nHe earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in music at the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg and taught at R.H. Watkins High School in Laurel, Mississippi, where he established an award-winning choir and was named Mississippi Educator of the Year 1975.\n\nTrask met him in Laurel in 1971, shortly after her father died, when she choreographed Howard’s musicals. During what was a difficult time for her, “he gave me strength,” Trask said. “He was a lifeline for me, and I think he was that for many people.”\n\nAfter a decade of working on Summer Lyric productions, Howard’s presence at Tulane became permanent in 1978, when he was named an assistant professor of music. He became an associate professor in 1986 and retired from Tulane in 2019.\n\nHoward, who was a volunteer at Project Lazarus, the home for people with AIDS, received the Big Easy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2004 and the Mayor's Arts Award.\n\nSurvivors include his companion, Wen Chao Ho, and nieces and nephews.\n\nBurial will be private."
