It primarily concerns the extent to which the Conservatives’ policies were similar to or different from those of previous Conservative governments and oppositions, including from the Margaret Thatcher era and earlier; the extent to which Conservative policies differed from those of the Labour governments led by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown; and how the Conservatives reached the policy positions that they held by the time of the 2010 general election. The remainder of this book investigates Conservative social policies in greater depth, with many of the chapters suggesting different possible interpretations of the ideas. Finally, an overview of the chapters included in this book is provided.",
