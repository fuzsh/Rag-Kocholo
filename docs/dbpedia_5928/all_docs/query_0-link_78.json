        "text": "“MADAM, these are the teeth of a killer…this man must have meat or die.” Such was the startling description of Iain Duncan Smith, new leader of the UK Conservative Party, made by Lord Tebbit when the two were out together on the campaign trail nine years ago.\n\nThe remark by Margaret Thatcher’s one-time hatchet man – and Duncan Smith’s predecessor as MP for Chingford – was in reply to a constituent who had demanded to know the politician’s stance on hunting.\n\nDuncan Smith is generally regarded as a dyed-in-the-wool shooting, hanging and flogging man – but the animal he most wants to get his teeth into now is the European Commission, trying to rip Britain from its jaws as the nation heads towards total integration.\n\nHis election proves that many Britons remain virulently opposed to the idea of a united Europe. For it was the 300,000 ordinary paid-up party members who voted for the grey-faced, balding man, barely-known outside the House of Commons a year ago and totally lacking in ministerial experience, over the affable, high-profile, tried and tested Ken Clarke – whom newspaper polls suggested was the only one who could get his party re-elected.\n\nNot only does the anti-Europe lobby at the heart of the Tory party apparently not value experience over a commitment to a spirited defence of national sovereignty, it also does not set much store by charisma. IDS, as he is now universally known in Britain, has barely a hint of star quality compared to the colourful Clarke or the elegant Michael Portillo – also a Europhile and considered the contest’s front-runner before falling at the first hurdle.\n\nDuncan Smith is a sort of William Hague ‘lite’ – every bit as bald, not as smiley, deeply dull and with vastly less to his CV than the man he is replacing, who at least was a former minister highly-skilled in the arts of speech-making and debate. Hague was also a liberal centrist, whereas IDS is a reactionary, entrenched in right-wing attitudes,\n\nTory-watchers believe his election is bound to lead to a fatal party split. Former Foreign Secretary Lord Hurd has warned that Duncan Smith should not expect to count on the support of the party’s Europhiles, while Clarke warned that IDS’s election would reduce a riven Conservative Party to Britain’s third political force and help promote the Lib-Dems to the position of chief opposition to the government.\n\nIndeed, Liberal Democrats have already confidently drawn up a hit-list of Tory dissidents they believe will be ready to defect to their camp when they can no longer stomach the new leadership: “We think there will be many people who saw themselves as mainstream Conservatives who just do not recognise the party they want in this bunch,” says a senior Liberal Democrat source.\n\nOne of the first to cross the floor could be the sacked deputy chairman of the Tories, Steven Norris, a left-winger who has said tartly of his new leader: “He is on probation.”\n\nIndeed, IDS’s decision to surround himself with like-minded politicians is an untested idea in modern Tory politics. Margaret Thatcher, John Major and William Hague all attempted to unify their party, if unsuccessfully, by appointing representatives of all factions to the inner circle of power. But IDS’s power was bought with a number of promises to the likes of leadership contest rivals David Davis and Michael Ancram (now shadow Foreign Secretary) as well as new shadow defence secretary Bernard Jenkin.\n\nSo what path did this unlikely successor to Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher (she vocally backed IDS for the leadership, said to be a key factor in his victory) take into politics? It was a traditional Tory route via Sandhurst military academy, a spell in the Scots Guards, management college and company boardrooms. Call him old-fashioned – his supporters certainly do. “Iain is a good man…part of the old boy regime of 20 years ago,” says one of the party stalwarts who voted for him, admiring his lean gait, good tailoring and hawkish tendencies. “If common sense is being too right-wing, I’m all for it.”\n\nDuncan Smith attacked the Maastricht Treaty the minute he entered Parliament in his maiden speech of 1992, said to be driven by the determination of Brussels to interfere with the size of condoms made by one of his leading constituency firms, the London Rubber Company. He further embarrassed his own government four years later by introducing a private member’s bill which would have allowed Parliament to overrule some decisions of the European Court.\n\nGiven last month’s cataclysmic events, his military background (including active service in Northern Ireland) and US contacts may prove a great weapon for profile building and winning the hearts of a nation nervous of terrorism and the prospect of active combat. An irritation in opposition to the government as it planned its contingent for the new EU rapid reaction force, he forged links with the US Republican Party, acquainting himself of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld months before either was elected. He has also been a popular speaker on the right-wing lecture trail; the Americans are said to be impressed by his military bearing, pinstripe suits and measured tones.\n\nDuncan Smith has made no secret of the fact that he would prefer to see Britain join the North Atlantic Free Trade Area alongside the US rather than align full-pelt with mainland Europe, and has told the Americans he believes the EU force is on course to destroy NATO.\n\nDespite his grey demeanour, IDS has been called “a force to be reckoned with” – a compliment from the unlikely quarter of The Guardian, Britain’s most strident left-wing voice. The paper points out that even John Major, whose life IDS made miserable during the early 90s, described him as “sharp-toothed and bright-eyed, with a keen prosecuting intellect and a strong right-wing ideology”.\n\nWith IDS at the helm, it now looks as though the Tories will spend the run-up to the next election fatally bickering over Britain joining the euro, and the whole question of defending national sovereignty against interference from Brussels, instead of concentrating on education, health and ousting Labour.\n\nIDS may be paying at least lip-service to the notion of unifying the party while down-playing the isolationist approach which was the backbone of his campaign – he did not mention Europe once in his leadership acceptance speech – but his actions belie his words. He has sent the clearest possible message of his agenda via the appointment of his opposition front bench, Eurosceptics virtually all.\n\nThese appointments include Michael Howard, the new shadow chancellor, party chairman David Davis and David Maclean as chief whip – three of the most important jobs. William Cash, who comes in as shadow attorney general, is the most controversial appointment of all – he is the man who masterminded the Maastricht revolt against his own party when it was in power, voting against the bill 47 times. It has been said that Cash, who like his leader has never held ministerial office, cannot wait to get his teeth into the Nice Treaty when it comes before Parliament later this year.\n\nIn mitigation, it must be said that Ken Clarke had refused to join an IDS cabinet, despite his rival’s overtures during the campaign, and Clarke supporter Andrew Lansley, former shadow Cabinet Office minister, apparently turned down the job of shadow Leader of the House.\n\nThe sole Clarkeist in the new line-up is Damian Green, a former television producer, who has been named shadow education secretary.\n\nMichael Portillo also refused to serve under Duncan Smith, as did many other doyens of the party. But there is one Portillo-ist. That’s Oliver Letwin – the new shadow home secretary and the only liberal in the entire line-up."
