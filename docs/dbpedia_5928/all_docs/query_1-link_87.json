        "text": "John Howard was the first elected Australian prime minister to identify himself as a conservative; he claimed to be a liberal in economic policy and a conservative in social policy.\n\nRobert Menzies had in 1945 regrouped the quarrelling non-Labor factions under the banner of liberalism, and in recent years many of John Howard's critics have argued that he has betrayed a liberal tradition that they trace to the great 19th century liberal J. S. Mill.\n\nIn fact liberalism has been only one strand on the political right in Australia, before Menzies the most successful non-Labor leaders were ex-Labor men whose political formation owed as little to liberalism.\n\nThe conservative tradition originated in rural Australia. The first great conservative cause was the war of the squatters against the Indigenous population conducted in defiance of British humanitarian opinion.\n\nPolitical conservatism was consolidated in the squatters' battle against the shearing unions in the late 1880s.\n\nAs long as Labor could be presented as a socialist party there was a space for liberalism in non-Labor ranks but with the collapse of socialism as a political project from the 1980s Australian liberalism tended to find its political home in the Labor Party.\n\nAs opposition leader in 1995-96 John Howard appealed to an imagined conservative mainstream rather than a defence of liberalism against socialism as Menzies had done in 1949.\n\nTo J.S. Mill, Alfred Deakin and even often to Menzies, liberalism was a philosophy of life. To Howard, liberalism was little more than set of tools for economic management.\n\nIndeed Howard's liberalism was limited even in the area of economic policy. Unlike classical liberals, he distrusted the spontaneous order of the market and allocated an active role for government in redistributing the fruits of economic growth towards those he considered deserving.\n\nLiberalism declines\n\nUnder Howard the liberalism of the Liberal Party became largely residual.\n\nIn many respects the Liberals inherited the pragmatic and populist conservatism of the declining National party, whose leaders had always been untroubled by the use of public authority to reward the deserving.\n\nHoward's defence of the Regional Partnerships program indicated sympathy for this approach. The most reliable bloc of Liberal seats came from the former National party stronghold of Queensland.\n\nMenzies had annoyed the Country Party (the predecessor to the Nationals) by his reluctance to support the outlawing of the Communist Party but Howard in government was untroubled by the criticism of civil libertarians.\n\nA heroine of the Howard years such as Jackie Kelly recalled in her style the hard traditions of Australian rural conservatism, from the squatters' wars against Aborigines and unions to the 'secret armies' of the early 1930s.\n\nHoward's intellectual supporters, such as Keith Windshuttle, looked back with admiration to the 19th Century frontier where hard men made hard decisions untrammelled by doubts.\n\nThe government's style and rhetoric echoed the harsh and unsentimental tone of J. S. Mill's 19th century critics such as Fitzjames Stephen who declared that 'the first idea of all is force, the power to reward and punish. The next idea is command'.\n\nGnawing anxiety\n\nYet behind the bravado of Australian conservatives in the Howard years lay a gnawing anxiety.\n\nYear after year the Prime Minister declared victory against the cultural left, but despite this he declared just before the election that a Labor victory would restore the tyranny of political correctness.\n\nThe saga of WorkChoices exemplified the limited scope of conservative victories.\n\nThe guiding inspiration of WorkChoices was less economic efficiency than a commitment to conservative values of support for authority and hierarchy.\n\nIt recalled the rhetoric of the squatters' 1880s and 1890s battle for 'freedom of contract'.\n\nThe rhetoric of WorkChoices contained an implied critique of discontented employees, a suggestion that if they were aggrieved with their treatment they should pursue another job or preferably pursue the road of self-employment rather than collective action.\n\nThe rapid decline in union membership from the 1990s was misinterpreted by Australian conservatives, they and Howard in particular saw it as evidence of a fundamental shift in popular values, that Australia had become a nation of 'enterprise workers' who accepted the exercise of managerial prerogative.\n\nIn fact the decline in union membership owed little to unexplained shifts in public opinion, it was a result of economic restructuring, governments' crusade against the closed shop and in particular an anti-union offensive by employers who were under greater competitive pressure due to economic liberalisation.\n\nThe government was baffled by opposition to WorkChoices and finally resorted in desperation to the themes of paternalist conservatism, marketing the Workplace Authority as a substitute trade union.\n\nJohn Howard's four election victories illustrated the contemporary appeal of conservative politics, but his final downfall revealed that conservatives could be just as prone to political hubris as their rivals.\n\nDr Geoff Robinson is a lecturer in Australian Studies and Politics at Deakin University."
