        "text": "Tell-all memoir targets senior Tory MPs and reopens spat with Michael Howard\n\nWiddecombe, 65, admits she laughed as Howard was repeatedly questioned by Jeremy Paxman in one of the most infamous political gaffes\n\nRecounts details of accusations of affair with former Prison Dervice director Derek Lewis\n\nClaims David Cameron stood between her and a seat in House of Lords because of disagreement over fox hunting\n\nFormer Tory MP's opinions on current politicians laid bare - calls David Cameron 'big-headed'\n\nLaid bare: the Tory grandee pulls no punches in her memoir, in which she attacks many senior member of her own party\n\nPolitics can be a bruising business and sometimes really rather nasty, but by and large its practitioners are more honourable than is often credited to them.\n\nThere were, however, some instances where I could not watch what was happening and keep quiet.\n\nPerhaps the most famous example was when I attacked Michael Howard as having something of the night about him and thereby ruined his hopes of the Tory leadership in 2003.\n\nI also managed to fall out with a different Michael – Michael Portillo – despite early admiration for his clarity of thought and willingness to help anyone.\n\nI found it easy enough to give my loyalty to the various leaders over the years and, once he was elected, never rocked the boat for Michael Howard – although I did have some initial doubt about his protégé, David Cameron.\n\nAfter we lost the 1997 Election and John Major resigned, Michael Howard decided to stand for election as Conservative leader.\n\nMy decision to speak out against him after the Election, when I could no longer damage Major, had been taken months before. I confided my intentions to friends.\n\nOn Saturday May 10, a journalist rang me. I told him I intended to question Michael’s conduct over the unjust sacking of Derek Lewis as director-general of the Prison Service.\n\nIn the course of our conversation I used the expression I had already tried on a few unsuspecting individuals, ‘something of the night’.\n\nNext day the expression took off everywhere. On Monday the first of the Dracula cartoons, which now adorn my walls on Dartmoor, appeared.\n\nI deployed my line that the sacking of Lewis had been ‘unjustly conceived, brutally executed and dubiously defended’.\n\nA frenzy of speculation began that Michael had lied to the House. Then the Howard camp made a miscalculation of gigantic proportions.\n\nBitter rivals: Ms Widdecombe is famed for saying Tory leader Michael Howard had 'something of the night about him'\n\nFall out: Ann Widdecombe gives details of her spats with Michael Portillo, accusing him of being jealous of her\n\nI flipped through the papers and saw a headline ‘The Wooing That Won Widdecombe’ and a story alleging Derek Lewis had courted me with chocolates, bouquets and private dinners and that it was one of the most ‘unusual professional alliances Whitehall had ever seen’.\n\nThen the piece quoted ‘an insider’ as saying: ‘I think she fell in love with him. He flattered her vanity. He sent her flowers and took her to dinner. I don’t think she was used to that, poor girl.’\n\nFor me, the hint of immorality was enough. I was insulted to the core. I hated injustice, hated brutality and hated the crude exercise of power.\n\nI would never have become involved with a married man. After that, it was mortal combat.\n\nI set out the facts for a press that could hardly believe its luck. I had arrived in the Home Office in July 1995 and had been absent all August. The dismissal took place in the first half of October.\n\nIn the whole of that time there had been not a petal of a flower nor crumb of a dinner and no friend would ever give me chocolates because they would be too concerned for my girth.\n\nThe only flowers had come from me to Mrs Lewis after her husband’s dismissal. Where was the wooing in that?\n\nMichael appealed to John Major who called me in but, like the Chief Whip Alastair Goodlad before him, made no serious attempt to dissuade me.\n\nRepetitious: Ann Widdecombe reveals she relished in Jeremy Paxman's questioning of Michael Howard in an infamous Newsnight segment. the presenter asked Mr Howard the same question 14 times\n\nI saw him smile slightly as he told me: ‘I will tell Michael you are of fixed purpose.’\n\nHe also said he thought the ‘wooing’ briefing a disgrace and that he had told Michael so. When Michael and I appeared on Newsnight, we were in separate studios.\n\nI roared on Jeremy Paxman as 14 times he asked Michael if he had threatened to overrule Derek and 14 times he refused to answer.\n\nIt did more than I could ever have done to persuade the media that Howard was hiding something.\n\nI was so delighted that I put a message on my answering machine saying that for anyone tempted to vote for Michael, Tuesday’s Newsnight should be compulsory viewing.\n\nHoward just never knew when to stop, always confusing toughness with personal destruction.\n\nJeremy later sent me a small box of chocolates with the message ‘never mind the girth worries’. Five months later he came to my 50th birthday party in the Commons.\n\nOn the day of my speech in the Commons, the press gallery was packed to standing room.\n\nMy stomach was rotating and when Speaker Betty Boothroyd called my name I did not want to stand up.\n\nThe events of the previous week had confirmed my intentions, but I was about to destroy a colleague and probably make an outcast of myself for a while to come.\n\nI was heard in silence and without interruption. The following day the press was overwhelmingly favourable and I knew my job had been done.\n\nMichael came last in the first ballot and I sent Lewis a pager message: Mission Accomplished.\n\nMy intervention had been the culmination of two years of events. Derek Lewis had been appointed director general of the Prison Service in December 1992 by Ken Clarke, who had brought him in from the private sector.\n\nHe quickly built up a loyal following as he focused and directed a poorly performing service. Derek was widely admired, but that sentiment was not shared by Michael Howard.\n\nThe vehicle he chose to dismiss the director general was an investigation into the escapes at Parkhurst in January 1995, prepared by General Learmont, a former Quartermaster-General.\n\nWhen the report arrived in October, just as I was starting my job as Prisons Minister in earnest, I knew Michael would use it to get rid of Lewis.\n\nOn the morning of Sunday, October 15, Michael and I met at the Home Office and he told me what he intended to do. My response was prophetic: ‘You’ll get away with this tomorrow but by the next day Derek’s fightback will have started and he has a lot of support.\n\n'There will be resignations and by Wednesday the tide will have turned in his favour.’\n\nNational treasure: Ann Widdecombe's memoir contains details of her time on Strictly Come Dancing\n\nUnusual alliance: Ms Widdecombe said she was insulted at accusations of an affair between her and the then director of the Prison service, Derek Lewis\n\nRunours: Headlines like 'The Wooing that won Widdecombe' accused Widdecombe of dating a married man. After that, it was mortal combat,' she writes\n\nHe then called Lewis into the room and demanded his resignation. Lewis refused. The deadline for the resignation came and went and so did another.\n\nI sent a note over to Downing Street telling the Prime Minister I disagreed with what was being done. John Major rang back to ask what I intended to do.\n\nI had been asking myself the same question all morning. The dream job had become a nightmare. I had little respect for the man for whom I was working.\n\nA major act of injustice was being carried out and I would, under collective responsibility, have to defend it.\n\nThe following day, I listened disbelievingly as the Home Office head of press told Michael that the dismissal of Lewis had gone well and that the press was happy as a head had rolled.\n\nBoth seemed to be suffering political myopia. Two non-executive members of the prisons board resigned, the senior civil servants’ union took up the case, irate governors flooded the Home Office fax machines, the Opposition began sniffing the air and the press began to turn.\n\nWhen the Opposition called a debate, Michael had no choice but to field me to avoid speculation of a rift, but he trusted me not an inch.\n\nMichael, panicky that I might say something good about Derek Lewis, demanded I must say that his decision had my full support.\n\nAs the Opposition was claiming that he had misled Parliament about the amount of pressure he had put on Derek, it seemed an odd moment to ask me effectively to mislead the House – nor was I so daft as to have been unprepared for such a question.\n\nThe formula I had concocted was: ‘The Home Secretary himself has praised Mr Lewis’s achievements and so do I, but it is inescapable that we have had two of the most serious operational failures in the history of the Prison Service.’\n\n'Michael Portillo was a fool. He alienated people who might have been his supporters, with an arrogant disregard for the consequences'\n\nI gave a vigorous winding-up speech, vocally supported by Michael. The day, which had so much potential for disaster, had turned into one of triumph and Michael left the Chamber on a high.\n\nThat mood sustained him when we all met in the PM’s office for a celebratory drink.\n\nHad I caused four days of anguish for the party, produced an Opposition censure debate, been served with a writ against the Home Office, endured resignations from serious players and brought about a media frenzy which overshadowed a successful party conference, I would have apologised to the PM.\n\nThat was not Howard’s way. Triumphant, gloating, vindictive, his first words when we had all sat down were: ‘Now I am going to get the press cuts about when Lewis left Granada.’\n\nDerek had left the TV company amid a huge controversy because he had invested £200 million of the company’s money in BSkyB.\n\nOutspoken: Ann Widdecombe is notorious for speaking out against colleagues\n\nIt turned out to be a stake eventually worth several billion pounds, but the parting had been difficult and Michael must have thought he could capitalise.\n\nQuite why he would wish to do that when he himself had just so triumphantly survived would not be obvious to anyone not given to kicking men when they are down.\n\nI got up and left, outraged but also deeply upset. Women who take their careers seriously do not let male colleagues see them in tears and I knew that was where I was heading.\n\nNot content with having destroyed a loyal servant’s career, put his family through hell and hearing his own side cheer it to the echo, he must now gratuitously indulge in a vengeful feud.\n\nI recalled Howard’s earlier panicky demands and contrasted them with his nasty certainty now. It revealed, I thought, a dark side, something of the night.\n\nThe Prime Minister later sent for me and I told him that vindictiveness and triumphalism were hardly appropriate, but if that was the course Michael wanted to pursue then I would not be following him along the path.\n\nBut let me lay to rest the silly story that I thought Michael possessed and wanted an exorcism. The myth arose from a joke exchanged between Roman Catholic priest Michael Seed and me when he visited my office.\n\nAs we passed the Home Secretary’s quarters, he asked in jest if he should sprinkle it with holy water and I snorted that bell, book and candle might be more appropriate.\n\nAll would have been well if we had not repeated the joke to friends.\n\nNext I heard it repeated back to me seriously, then BBC presenter Jim Naughtie actually claimed that an eminent journalist believed I had brought a priest to the Commons to exorcise Michael.\n\nQuit: Ms widdecombe said some of David Cameron's new and exciting parliamentary candidates, they were not all cut out for the job. Louise Mensche (pictured) quit after three years in governmet\n\nIt showed not merely an astounding credulity but a woeful ignorance of exorcism procedures in the Catholic Church.\n\nThe relationship between Howard and the prison service was further strained after it emerged that miscalculations had allowed a number of prisoners to be released early.\n\nAt a furious meeting at the Home Office, Michael was white-faced with anger and frustration. He tried unsuccessfully to get to the bottom of it and who had performed the calculations, but he was known as a hardline sacker and everyone was busy covering themselves.\n\nAfter another Election defeat in 2001, Iain Duncan Smith took over the party leadership, but after a vote of no confidence in 2003, the position became vacant again.\n\nIt had been six years since I had destroyed Michael Howard’s hopes of the leadership and I had no appetite for another assassination.\n\nIf we were to have any hope of landing blows on Tony Blair we did not need to land them on each other.\n\nThe press began to ring up every five minutes so I devised a one sentence response: ‘I do not retract anything I said in 1997, including the famous phrase, but this is 2003 and I have no intention of rehearsing those matters again.’\n\nMichael pronounced it ‘very generous’ but I suspect the reaction stemmed from relief. He said we should meet and we duly did so in his room at Parliament.\n\nIt was a cordial conversation but I refused to support him outright. Diplomatically, I said I wanted to be certain no one else was standing. No one did.\n\nThe coronation having taken place, Michael performed the political manoeuvre of burying the hatchet by offering me a frontbench position at the same time as ensuring my refusal by choosing a brief I could never have accepted: Overseas Aid.\n\nI could hardly globe-trot given my responsibilities to my sick mother. I turned it down flat, whereupon his supporters briefed that I had snubbed him.\n\nAll that needs to be said about my gradual disengagement from political ambition is that my reaction was no more than a large yawn.\n\nI had some hopes for the party led by Michael. He had a formidable brain, great determination and could think fast on his feet.\n\nHe is a man who could have been a political giant had he only learned to distinguish between toughness and bullying or decisiveness and autocracy, if he had known when to stop in delivering punishment, if his smile did not always remind one of the face of the proverbial tiger, if humanity and humility had played a greater role in his personality. I would trust him with anything except people.\n\n‘I would fight alongside him in the jungle… but if the battle went wrong he would look for someone to court martial – or just shoot.’\n\nOpinionated: In the no holds barred book, David Cameron is said to be big-headed and inexperienced\n\nDivisive: Ms Widdecombe said her disagreements with David Cameron over fox hunting may have cost her a seat in the House of Lords\n\nThe reaction of the Conservative Right to the scale of the Election defeat in 1997 was to seek a new image for the party.\n\nThe high priest was the king across the water, Michael Portillo, who had undergone a conversion of Damascene proportions since losing his seat.\n\nThe man who had always taken a hard line on the economy was suddenly the champion of the low paid. He had also taken on the social conservatives and was now the voice of homosexual equality.\n\nSpeaking about David Cameron: 'I thought him big-headed and dismissive of everything that had gone before, and it did not help that he was an admirer of Michael Howard.'\n\nHe was hardly the only Tory to think in this fashion and there were useful debates to be had, but the man who returned to Parliament in a by-election in November 1999 was different from the man who had left.\n\nI was looking forward to Michael’s return because I still thought of him as the man for whom I had worked: clever but never short of time for other people.\n\nNow he seemed focused only on his own ambitions. I went to his constituency on three occasions but he refused point blank to come to mine, saying: ‘It’s a bit of a waste of time going to colleagues’ constituencies, isn’t it?’\n\nI was not wholly convinced that Michael was responsible for the backbiting which intensified as time went on, but he failed to control his own supporters and those of his henchman, Francis Maude.\n\nWhen a fairly perceptive colleague said he thought Portillo was jealous of me, I did not brush it aside.\n\nRevealed: Ms Widdecombe remembers John Major saying that he thought the 'wooing' rumour about Derek Lewis were a disgrace\n\nStraight shooter: Ann Widdecombe doesn't curtail her no holds barred approach in her autobiography\n\nMichael had known me as an admiring supporter. Now he saw me as the darling of the party in the country who dealt with him on equal terms.\n\nYet I knew he hated my views and my style and could hardly believe that this frumpy little woman could be considered seriously in the same breath as the suave, charismatic Portillo.\n\n(Petty jealousies are normal and no serious player can expect not to encounter them. One of the irritants in my life was John Redwood who, aided and abetted by Bernard Jenkin, seemed to try to make my job as difficult as possible when he had to submit policy proposals to a group I was chairing.\n\nHe resented not being able to send them straight to William Hague and played silly games, always holding up the meeting to complain about the times at which we gathered. It was wearing but hardly worrying.)\n\nMichael Portillo was a fool. He alienated people who might have been his supporters, with an arrogant disregard for the consequences.\n\nFrom 1999 until 2001 the Portillistas ran their campaign while the rest of us tried to secure an, admittedly unlikely, Election victory.\n\nWhat really mattered was to win back enough seats to make victory possible the time after.\n\nMalcolm Gooderham, Portillo’s spin doctor, stood in the wings mocking my party conference speech in full sight of my own aides and knowing that they could see.\n\nThat was how tribal we had become and the antics of the two factions in Central Office speak vastly louder than any policy discussion ever could.\n\nIn fact, the infighting erupted in major bloodletting and the blood on the carpet was mine.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday was told that half the Shadow Cabinet disagreed with my plan as Shadow Home Secretary to target cannabis smokers. In fact, as the speech makes abundantly clear, I was targeting the entire range of drugs activity and never actually mentioned the wretched weed by name.\n\nThe aide then said: ‘Ask some of them if they smoked dope when they were younger. I promise you will receive some fascinating responses.’\n\nThe Mail on Sunday found no fewer than seven Shadow Cabinet members who admitted to having smoked cannabis when young: Francis Maude, Bernard Jenkin, Archie Norman, Peter Ainsworth, David Willetts, Tom Strathclyde and Oliver Letwin, although he said he had been duped (and doped) and was furious.\n\nOliver Letwin\n\nMichael Ancram and William Hague had both expressed surprise at my failure to stand for the Conservative leadership in 2001 the latter saying that he had expected me to be ‘a substantial candidate’ and that the ‘party must be mad’.\n\nKen Clarke did not declare immediately and I decided to back Michael Ancram.\n\nI was closest in viewpoint to Iain Duncan Smith but thought he lacked charisma and would not be impressive at the despatch box.\n\nI think he won because he wasn’t Widdecombe, Portillo or Clarke.\n\nHe had no controversy attached to him, was a clear Eurosceptic and thought reliable.\n\nAfter a lacklustre Election campaign in 2005, Michael Howard resigned and the party once more became image obsessed under the new leader, David Cameron.\n\nI had not supported him. He had been in Parliament for only four years when he stood as leader and, if I had worried about William Hague’s experience, this seemed madness.\n\nI thought him big-headed and dismissive of everything that had gone before, and it did not help that he was an admirer of Michael Howard.\n\nOnce he had won I tried to give him my loyalty, which in many ways was made easy by the way he began to look like a Prime Minister in waiting.\n\nWe might just win, I thought, and cheered him on. Maybe he wasn’t quite so big-headed, I hoped, when we had a cordial conversation.\n\nAnd if he was, so what? Churchill was hardly a modest man. Yet the image nonsense wearied me and I did not attempt to hide my scorn of the manipulation of the candidate selection process.\n\nI did not think that there was anything superior about those of us who survived the electoral carnage of 1997.\n\nA sizeable body of former MPs wanted to come back, yet such was the desire to do away with the past that there was an attempt to dispense with those who had been part of it.\n\nMost ludicrous of all was the A-list. Cameron wanted to broaden the party’s image by filling its benches with women, homosexuals and those from ethnic minorities.\n\nHe also wanted new and exciting candidates and was, crucially, unbothered about previous experience.\n\nThe realities of parliamentary life shocked some of them to the core. One of his A-listers, Louise Mensch, resigned her seat less than three years after the Election, while another is a thorn in Cameron’s side.\n\nI was closest in viewpoint to Iain Duncan Smith but thought he lacked charisma and would not be impressive at the despatch box. I think he won because he wasn’t Widdecombe, Portillo or Clarke.\n\nMost ironic of all, such bias inevitably brought in a new urban element which has thwarted his plans to repeal the hunting ban.\n\nI have never understood how any woman can want positive discrimination. In the 1970s the attitude was robust: give us equal opportunities and we will show that we are as good as the men.\n\nIn the 1990s that became: we can’t manage without special measures to smooth our paths.\n\nI believe it is the right of every woman in Parliament and elsewhere to look every man in the eye and to know that she got there on exactly the same basis as he did. If not, then she has become a second-class citizen.\n\nYet Cameron is undeniably able. He has presence and confidence and when I saw him perform at the party conference, he took a leaf from my book by walking about without speaking notes.\n\nHe needs only to add a touch of humility and generosity to that ability to win success but he appears unaware of its importance.\n\nIain Duncan Smith and Michael Gove are making the sort of changes the country can respect and it would be a pity if their efforts were to be vitiated by the Prime Minister’s obsession with image and ‘modernising’.\n\nWhen I considered my future in my final year in Parliament, I would have listed the greatest possibilities in order of likelihood as: 1. The Lords. 2. LBC Radio. 3. The Vatican.\n\nThere is no prescriptive right to go to the Lords and a place there is purely at the gift of the PM, but there had to be a strong probability: I was a Privy Counsellor, had served in senior Ministerial office, had been Shadow Home Secretary and was one of the biggest players in the Hague years.\n\nI had emerged clean from the expenses scandal and few did more to travel the country cheering the troops and raising funds.\n\nSo it was natural enough for colleagues to tell me I was bound to be asked.\n\nMost of them did not believe me when I told them it wouldn’t happen, but I knew because I had received private intelligence from an unimpeachable source that Cameron had set his face against it.\n\nThe leader of the Lords, Tom Strathclyde, said in front of a number of MPs that it was because of hunting but I cannot believe Cameron is that petty or that much in the grip of the squirearchy.\n\nI come from a hunting family. My mother used to walk to otterhounds and I grew up with the head of one poor beast decorating the wall, while my father rode to foxhounds in his youth, as did my grandfather throughout his life.\n\nI do not object to killing foxes, but I strongly object to the chase whereby an animal runs for its life with the hounds getting closer and closer. It is barbarous that such an activity should be regarded as a sport.\n\n'Doris Karloff' I could handle, but Jimmy Carr's vulgar jokes went too far\n\nI had inherited a policy that ensured female prisoners, like male prisoners, would routinely be handcuffed when travelling for medical treatment.\n\nThat raised a particular problem for pregnant inmates.\n\nChannel 4 secretly filmed a prisoner from Holloway who was giving birth in the Whittington Hospital in NorthLondon.\n\nMatter of taste: Ann Widdecombe swore she would not return to Have I Got News For You after comedian Jimmy Carr's taunts\n\nThere was a moment before labour was confirmed when she wanted to smoke and handcuffs were applied.\n\nThe image broadcast to a scandalised nation was woman, bump, chains. The media had a field day.\n\nThe Opposition, with some cause, demanded a statement, and the job fell to me.\n\nThe Mirror ran a photograph of my head superimposed on a pregnant body in chains and Paul Flynn, a Labour MP, dubbed me Doris Karloff, which stuck.\n\nJournalists were surprised by my lack of resentment at this nickname. After insisting to one that I had nothing to add, I terminated the conversation with the words: ‘That’s it. Karloff has spoken.’\n\nHis colleagues were consumed by mirth. In 2006 I had a highly successful appearance as chairman on Have I Got News For You and was invited back in 2007 when, thanks to Jimmy Carr, it was not successful at all.\n\nTwo hours of non-stop vulgarity were more than I could stand.\n\nYou are only as good as your last programme and I have not been invited back since.\n\nThere is only one rumour which, with the wisdom of retrospect, I wish I had taken more seriously.\n\nWhile I was in Social Security, the Kent Messenger rang up to ask if I was about to be named in Peter Tatchell’s campaign to ‘out’ highprofile figures as homosexual.\n\nAs I had never had a lesbian instinct in my life, I dismissed it as rot and my name did not appear but the rumour persisted, though never in a form that asserted its truth sufficiently baldly for me to sue.\n\nThen in 2001 a group called Tories Against Hypocrisy made the accusation on the internet, accompanied by alleged circumstances which went back to my early years in Maidstone.\n\nAt first I laughed at the absurdity, then tried to identify the people responsible – but they were impossible to find.\n\nMy third reaction was that they had probably done me a favour.\n\nEvery dirty digger in Fleet Street would now go dirty digging and come back with a shiny clean spade and probably frustration at having his time wasted.\n\nIndeed, after that the hints and innuendoes virtually disappeared as the truth that a woman may be both heterosexual and unmarried was finally accepted.\n\nMaybe if I had reacted more energetically the first time the issue was raised I might have discovered the source and squashed the libel earlier."
