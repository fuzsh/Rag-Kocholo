        "text": "Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck, a renowned physicist, was born on April 23, 1858, in Kiel, Germany. He came from an academic background, with his father being a Professor of Constitutional Law. Planck embarked on his academic journey by studying at the Universities of Munich and Berlin, where he was mentored by prominent scientists like Kirchhoff and Helmholtz. In 1879, he earned his doctorate in philosophy from Munich and later served as a Privatdozent in Munich from 1880 to 1885. He then became an Associate Professor of Theoretical Physics at Kiel until 1889, at which point he succeeded Kirchhoff as a Professor at Berlin University. This position would become his academic home until his retirement in 1926. Subsequently, Planck assumed the role of President of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Promotion of Science, a position he held until 1937. He also became a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1894, eventually becoming its Permanent Secretary in 1912. Planck's early scientific pursuits centered around thermodynamics, a field he was drawn to through the influence of Kirchhoff and Clausius' writings. He delved into topics like entropy, thermoelectricity, and the theory of dilute solutions. Simultaneously, he explored radiation processes, identifying them as fundamentally electromagnetic in nature. His groundbreaking work in this realm led to the problem of energy distribution in the spectrum of full radiation. In 1900, Planck introduced a revolutionary concept: the energy emitted by a resonator could only exist in discrete units or quanta. He mathematically established the relationship between energy and the frequency of radiation, defining it as E = hv, where \"h\" is now known as Planck's constant. This discovery marked a pivotal moment in the history of physics, despite initial underappreciation. Over time, it proved invaluable in resolving discrepancies between observed phenomena and classical physics, with applications like Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect. Planck's work on quantum theory was documented in publications such as \"Thermodynamik\" (1897) and \"Theorie der Wärmestrahlung\" (1906). In recognition of his contributions, he was elected as a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1926 and awarded the Copley Medal in 1928. During the Nazi regime in Germany, Planck faced a tumultuous period as he opposed certain government policies, notably the persecution of Jews. Despite hardships, including the destruction of his home in bombing raids, he remained in his homeland out of a sense of duty. Planck was not only esteemed for his scientific discoveries but also cherished for his exceptional personal qualities. He possessed musical talents as a pianist and once contemplated a career in music. Planck married twice, first to Marie Merck in 1885, who passed away in 1909, and later to her cousin, Marga von Hösslin. Tragically, he lost three of his children at a young age and experienced personal anguish when one...\n\nBefore the discovery of the Higgs boson particle, it was understood that the nucleus of an atom contained all the mass attributed to neutrons and protons. In the mid-sixties, neutrons and protons were regarded as the fundamental particles. However, Dr. Peter Higgs (a British physicist) and his colleague Dr. Satyendra Nath Bose (an Indian physicist) had a deeper understanding that these two particles are not fundamental and that there exist sub-atomic particles accountable for the mass of matter. They formulated the concept of the \"god particle,\" which was subsequently renamed the Higgs boson in honor of their contributions. It is a class of sub-atomic particles that are around 1/100th the size of a proton and is the fundamental force-carrying particle of the Higgs field, which is responsible for granting other particles their mass. Scientists in CERN laboratories used the world’s most robust particle accelerator to observe it for the first time in 2012. Through this development, our comprehension of the mass of matter has advanced and is substantiated by experimental evidence. Consequently, new pathways for further discoveries are set to unfold in the future. It's a significant accomplishment for a scientist when their theory is experimentally validated during their lifetime. Dr. Peter Higgs passed away on 9th April 24. R.I.P.
