        "text": "This paper is the first part of a three-part project ‘How the principle of energy conservation evolved between 1842 and 1870: the view of a participant’. This paper aims at showing how the new ideas of Mayer and Joule were received, what constituted the new theory in the period under study, and how it was supported experimentally. A connection was found between the new theory and thermodynamics which benefited both of them. Some considerations are offered about the desirability of taking a historical approach to teaching energy and its conservation.\n\nIn this 400-page award-winning book, Smith describes the human side of one of the major concepts in recent times: Energy. This is a word that appears often in today's conversations but most people have only vaguest sense of this idea. Smith is a historian of science, who is fascinated by the personalities involved but he is also very familiar with the science of energy, so he can present both sides of this intriguing story: a powerful new concept and the tough men who created it; mainly from the North of England and Scotland. These scientists and engineers developed energy physics to solve practical problems encountered by Scottish shipbuilders and marine engineers; to counter biblical revivalism and evolutionary materialism; and to rapidly enhance their own scientific credibility and, in the case of Maxwell, promote his own secret religious agenda. This was one of the first examples of unifying physics, when most scientists were stuck in just specialities. It was only in 1853 that the formal Energy definition surfaced but the discoveries of atomic physics ended its conquest as the atomic world was seen to be discrete that contradicted the original continuum assumption. Smith skillfully places this revolution in its scientific and cultural context, exploring the actual creation of scientific knowledge during one of the most significant episodes in the history of physics, showing how this new, difficult idea quickly displaced the central idea of Newtonian physics: Force. The Energy idea spread rapidly across the educated minds of Europe, feeding old metaphorical extensions, as it reinforced the conquest of industrial mechanization. As this book seems written for Smith's fellow scholars, I added extra explanatory sections to help the non-specialists.\n\nThe philosopher-Physicists centers on the origins of modern mathematical physics developed primarily by Maxwell and Helmholtz. In alternate chapters, the contributions of the principals are placed in the context of the prevailing discourses and controversies in physics and philosophy. Cultural contexts, such as art (e.g. the pre-Raphaelites), literature (e.g. romanticism) and historical events (e.g. the revolutions of 1848 and the Franco-Prussian war) are presented. Contemporaries, such as Boltzmann, Gibbs, Oersted, and Riemann in mathematical physics, and Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, and Frege in philosophy are considered. The last chapters deal with the influence of the work of Maxwell and Helmholtz on the developments in 20 th century mathematical physics, focusing on the origins of quantum mechanics. The theme of the arguments is in the influence of Kantian epistemology and metaphysics on the authors. The epilogue examines the work of Arthur Compton as founded on Maxwell's electrodynamics and field theory and Helmholtz' concept of energy (all modified by Einstein), and Boltzmann's Statistical Mechanics. It highlights the difficulties of modern wave-particle dualism inherent on their dependence on the mathematical formalism and on innovations of the principals. The arguments are paraphrased with a minimum of both scientific and philosophical technical terminology, and there is no mathematical notation. This is to make the work accessible to non-specialists, typically at the undergraduate level."
