        "text": "It was such a joy to present at my first of the Gordon Research Conferences ! ðŸ§ ðŸŒŸ The Barriers of the CNS community welcomed this chemical engineer with open arms and I felt so at home. I was blown away to be able to spend 20 minutes talking about the beauty of astrocytes over breakfast, be in the room listening to conversations about the future of pericyte research, and marvel over new revelations about endothelial cells, the retinal barrier, and more! After each day of learning, I laughed over beer with researchers from all over the world - researchers I have heavily cited and admired since before my Ph.D. as well as new peers and friends. Learning the history of my field from the individuals who have actively built and shaped it was among the great honors of my life. Being able to share in turn the things I have been working towards in my Ph.D with the Nance Lab and have those things be validated, constructively critiqued, and valued by leaders in the Barriers field was truly amazing. Thank you to the conference co-chairs for the opportunity to attend and to the GRC for the Carl Storm Fellowship Award! ðŸ©µ I also wanted to especially thank Dr. Dionna Williams , Dr. Robert Thorne , and Dr. Ana Raquel P. Santa Maria, Ph.D. for all of their encouragement and support prior to and throughout the duration of the meeting. To everyone at the Barriers of the CNS GRC, thank you for all you have done to build our field, and I am excited to hopefully contribute in my own small way one day! ðŸ§ ðŸŒŸ"
