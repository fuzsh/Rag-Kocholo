        "text": "As part of the celebrations for CERN’s 70th anniversary, this event offered a unique opportunity to explore the various applications of particle physics instruments and tools in hospitals and medical research. Medical doctors, biologists and physicists guided the public on a captivating journey, providing insights into the future of therapy and imaging.\n\nThe event covered three areas in which particle physics was contributing to the development of new medical technologies:\n\nAccelerators to treat cancer\n\nFrom radiotherapy for cancer treatment to radiopharmaceuticals: tens of thousands of particle accelerators are used in medicine. New therapies have been made possible by the innovative technologies developed for frontier instruments, like the Large Hadron Collider.\n\nLooking inside the human body\n\nSince the discovery of X-rays, medical imaging and physics have advanced hand in hand. Sophisticated particle detectors, which are at the heart of modern imaging devices, enable doctors to provide early and accurate diagnosis of many diseases.\n\nThe digital health revolution\n\nMachine learning and artificial intelligence technologies play a crucial role in particle physics, which is rapidly embracing these tools to advance research. Collaborations with medical doctors, epidemiologists and researchers are leading to game-changing developments that help to preserve or improve our health."
