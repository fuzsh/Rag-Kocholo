Also the IAC recommended maximization of space utilization and construction cost saving. After GA(General Arrangement) is made a decision, it is necessary to evaluate the radiation analysis of every controlled area in the proton accelerator research center such as accelerator tunnel, Klystron gallery, beam experimental hall, target rooms and ion beam application building to keep dose rate below the ALARA(As Low As Reasonably achievable) objective. Our staff has reviewed and made a shielding design of them. In this paper, According to accelerator operation mode and access conditions based on radiation analysis and shielding design, we made the exhaust system configuration of controlled area in the proton accelerator research center.

IAC-Jabola and IAC-EsperanÃ§a were developed by the Instituto AgronÃ´micoCampinas (IAC in view of their excellent grain type, plant size and higher mean yield than the standard control Jalo Precoce.The IAC had these cultivars registered in MAPA/RNC based on results of 24 VCU trials in 2005/2006/2007, in the state of SÃ£oPaulo. The yield of IAC Jabola was 2124 kg ha-1, 2336 kg ha-1, and 2558 kg ha-1, in the rainy, dry and winter seasons,respectively. The IAC- EsperanÃ§a produced 1718 kg ha-1, 1545 kg ha-1, and 2263 kg ha-1 in the rainy, dry and winter seasons,respectively.\n\nInternal auditory canal (IAC) stenosis: imaging Findings\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nOrtiz Jimenez, Johanna; Roa, Jose Luis; Figuero A, Ramon E\n\n2011-01-01\n\nObjectives: To describe the computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) findings in a patient with a diagnosis of internal auditory canal (IAC) stenosis. To describe the embryological development of the IAC structures and the natural history of IAC stenosis. Methods: A 4 year old girl presents with sensorineural hearing loss and bilateral recurrent otitis media. The temporal bone CT shows diminished left IAC diameter (less than 2 mm), right IAC absence and normal inner ear structures. These findings are pathognomonic for left IAC stenosis. The MR findings include left IAC stenosis and IAC neural structures absence secondary to aplasia of the vestibulocochlear nerve on each IAC . Results: Hypoplasia/aplasia of the vestibulocochlear nerve in association with IAC stenosis is an important consideration in the differential diagnosis of sensorineural hearing loss, as it is a relative contraindication for cochlear implant placement. Conclusions: IAC stenosis and vestibulocochlear nerve hypoplasia/aplasia must be excluded as an etiology of sensorineural hearing loss. The diagnosis can be made by CT and MR.\n\nInternal auditory canal (IAC) stenosis: Imaging findings\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nOrtiz J, Johanna; Roa, Jose L; Figueroa Ramon E\n\n2011-01-01\n\nObjectives: To describe the computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) findings in a patient with a diagnosis of internal auditory canal (IAC) stenosis.

The experimental design was completely randomized in a factorial 4 x 4 (four temperatures and four immersion times), with four replications. Pre-germination treatments were: immersion in water at room temperature (25 Celsius degrade) and immersion in hot water at temperatures of 60, 70 and 80 Celsius degrade for 2, 4, 6 and 8 minutes. Water content of the seeds was determined before treatments. Before and after each treatment, seeds were subjected to germination test; 20-30 Celsius degrade alternating temperature, determining the percentages of normal and abnormal seedlings, dormant and dead seeds. Independent of time, immersion in 70 Celsius degrade, water was the most efficient treatment for accelerating germination of castor bean cultivar IAC 226.\n\nPerformance of new Hevea clones from IAC 400 series Perfomance de novos clones de Hevea da sÃ©rie IAC 400\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPaulo de Souza GonÃ§alves\n\n2007-06-01\n\nFull Text Available The Hevea breeding program of Instituto AgronÃ´mico de Campinas (IAC has completed clonal evaluation on the following series: IAC 100, IAC 200 and IAC 300. The performance of 22 clones of Hevea brasiliensis (Willd. ex Adr. de Juss. Muell.-Arg., evolved at IAC, over a period of eleven years was evaluated in the Western Central part of the SÃ£o Paulo State, Brazil. Among these 22 new clones, six were intraspecific hybrid clones (IAC 400, IAC 404, IAC 405, IAC 406, IAC 410, IAC 412 and the remaining are primary those resulted from selected ortets within half-sib progenies. An old popular clone RRIM 600, of Malaysian origin, was used as the control. The trial was laid out in a randomized block design with three replications. Yield performance over a period of four years, mean girth at the 11th year, girth increment before tapping and on tapping, thermal property of natural rubber produced, bark thickness, number of latex vessel rows in seven year virgin bark, percentage incidence of tapping panel dryness, wind damage and diseases like leaf and panel anthracnose have been observed. Sixty one percent of the clones were superior in relation to the control for yield. The clone IAC 400 recorded the highest yield (97.40 g tree-1 tap-1 over four years of tapping, followed by IAC 411 (78.87 tree-1 tap-1, whereas the control clone RRIM 600 recorded 50.86 g tree-1 tap-1. All selected clones were vigorous in growth. Girth increment of these clones was average to above average. Except for IAC 423, other clones had thick virgin bark at opening ranging from 4.84 mm for IAC 401 to 6.38 mm for IAC 416. The natural rubbers from IAC clones have shown good thermal stability up to 300ÂºC and no differences in the thermal behavior among rubber from clones of the IAC series and the clone RRIM 600 were found in inert atmosphere.O programa de melhoramento de Hevea do Instituto AgronÃ´mico de Campinas (IAC completou a avaliaÃ§Ã£o dos clones da sÃ©rie IAC 100, IAC 200 e IAC\n\nPRODUTIVIDADE DE CULTIVARES DE UVAS PARA SUCO SOBRE DIFERENTES PORTA-ENXERTOS IAC EM MOCOCA-SP YIELD OF JUICE GRAPE CULTIVARS GRAFTED ON SOME IAC ROOTSTOCKS\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMAURILO MONTEIRO TERRA\n\n2001-08-01\n\nFull Text Available Estimou-se o potencial de produÃ§Ã£o de uvas das cultivares copa Concord, Isabel e Seibel 2, recomendadas para produÃ§Ã£o de suco, enxertadas sobre os porta-enxertos IAC 313 'Tropical', 'IAC 571-6', IAC 572 'Jales', e IAC 766 'Campinas', num experimento conduzido, durante seis anos, na EstaÃ§Ã£o Experimental de Mococa (21Âº28'S, 47Âº01'W do Instituto AgronÃ´mico de Campinas.

The electron accelerator is used to generate neutrons by inducing Bremsstrahlung photon-neutron reactions in a Tungsten- Copper target. This accelerator/target system produces a source of â¼1012 n/s, which can initiate fission reactions in the subcritical system. This coupling experiment between a 40-MeV electron accelerator and a subcritical system will allow us to predict and measure coupling efficiency, reactivity, and multiplication. In this paper, the results of the criticality and multiplication calculations, which were carried out using the Monte Carlo radiation transport code MCNPX, for different coupling design options are presented. The fuel plate arrangements and the surrounding tank dimensions have been optimized. Criticality using graphite instead of water for reflector/moderator outside of the core region has been studied. The RACE configuration at the IAC will have a criticality (k-effective) of about 0,92 and a multiplication of about 10.

ITEM is responsible for the field management of 15 IACs in the western US. This DOE funded program utilizes teams of engineering faculty and students to conduct assessments of small to medium-size plants to identify cost savings by conserving energy, minimizing waste, and improving productivity. These assessments are provided at no direct cost to participating manufacturers, who are under no obligation to act on any recommendations. Centers managed by ITEM have conducted assessments in more than 700 plants in the metals fabrication industry (SIC 34). Recommendations made have the potential to reduce energy costs by about 10% on average. The average metals fabrication plant served achieved a 5.7% reduction in annual energy costs. These cost savings are accompanied by a reduction in energy usage of about 1.2 x 10 12 Btu/yr. Another benefit of the program is that it provides hands-on industrial experience and energy efficiency training for engineering students who will take these skills into industry. Since the program began more than 20 years ago, IACs have served less than 2% of the plants in this industry. To provide an effective means for plant managers to access and utilize the knowledge gained over the years ITEM has summarized recommendations that identify specific actions that plant management can take to save money\n\nDevelopment of a Positron Source for JLab at the IAC\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nForest, Tony [Idaho State Univ., Pocatello, ID (United States)\n\n2013-10-12\n\nWe report on the research performed towards the development of a positron sour for Jefferson Lab's (JLab) Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) in Newport News, VA. The first year of work was used to benchmark the predictions of our current simulation with positron production efficiency measurements at the IAC. The second year used the benchmarked simulation to design a beam line configuration which optimized positron production efficiency while minimizing radioactive waste as well as design and construct a positron converter target. The final year quantified the performance of the positron source. This joint research and development project brought together the experiences of both electron accelerator facilities. Our intention is to use the project as a spring board towards developing a program of accelerator based research and education which will train students to meet the needs of both facilities as well as provide a pool of trained scientists.\n\nResistÃªncia de soja a insetos: VIII.

Before this time the facilities and staff of AAC belonged to other departments of the institute. The re-organization however, was necessary. It was understood that the translocation of all the accelerators into a centralized unit is advantageous in numerous fields. Here we just mention some of them. The submission of any instrumentation type proposal (EU or domestic) will be easier and has a higher chance to be supported. The organization and distribution of the beamtimes will be more equal and optimal. The usage of the maintenance and spare tools can became better and cheaper. The operating staff (cca. 20 person) can serve at more than one accelerator and the teams can help each other. The accelerator center actually became a fourth new basic unit of the institute besides the three traditional scientific divisions (see the Atomki homepage for the organization chart). The following six main facilities belong to the accelerator center: Cyclotron; VdG-5 accelerator; VdG-1 accelerator; ECR ion source; Isotope separator; Tandetron (under installation). In figure 1 the placements of these machines are shown in an artistic 3D map of the Atomki. The table 1 summarizes the main parameters of the accelerators. More detailed technical specification of the machines can be found in the new homepage of the center. In 2009 all the accelerators operated as scheduled, safely and without major breakdowns.

This study evaluated the influence of âIAC 766â and â106-8 Mgtâ rootstocks on the physicochemical characteristics of âBordÃ´â, âIsabelâ and âIAC 138-22 âMÃ¡ximoâ musts and wines. The musts were evaluated for pH, soluble solids, total acidity and soluble solids/acidity ratio. The wines were evaluated for density, alcohol content; total, volatile and fixed acidity; pH, dry extract, reducing sugars, reduced dry extract, alcohol in weight/reduced dry extract; free and total sulfur dioxide; anthocyanins, polyphenols index (I 280; polyphenols and total flavonoids and antioxidant activity. The âBordÃ´â, âIsabelâ and IAC 138-22 âMÃ¡ximoâ musts had low soluble solids for winemaking. The â106-8 Mgtâ rootstock promoted higher dry extract content and reduced dry extract in BordÃ´ wine, and lower total and fixed acidity in IAC 138-22 MÃ¡ximo wine. In Isabel wine, higher pH was promoted by the âIAC 766â rootstock. Aside from low total acidity of the BordÃ´ wine, all the physicochemical characteristics of the wines studied are in accordance with Brazilian law.

This is a distributed ion chamber which is used to monitor secondary ionization along the shield walls of a beam line resulting from incorrectly steered charged particle beams in lieu of the use of many discrete ion chambers. A cone of ionizing radiation emanating from a point source as a result of incorrect steering intercepts a portion of 1-5/8 inch Heliax cable (about 100 meters in length) filled with Argon gas at 20 psi and induces a pulsed current which is proportional to the ionizing charge. This signal is transmitted via the cable to an integrator circuit whose output is directed to an electronic comparators, which in turn is used to turn off the accelerated primary beam when preset limits are exceeded. This device is used in the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) Beam Containment System (BCS) to prevent potentially hazardous ionizing radiation resulting from incorrectly steered beams in areas that might be occupied by people.

The pharmacological treatments have been performed by the intraperitoneal route of administration, representing to date, the main limit for the drug use. The aim of this study was to develop a delivery system that allows the oral administration of IAC while maintaining its therapeutic efficacy. Solid Lipid Microparticles (SLMs) containing a theoretical 18% (w/w) of IAC have been produced by the spray congealing technology; three formulations have been tested (A, B and C) using different low melting point carriers (stearic acid, Compritol(Â®) HD5ATO and carnauba wax) alone or in combination. All IAC loaded SLMs exhibited a spherical shape, encapsulation efficiency higher than 94% and particle size suitable for the oral route. Administered per os at different dosages in an inflammation rat model, all SLMs demonstrated their efficacy in reducing oedema and alleviating pain, compared to the gold standards Indomethacin and Paracetamol. These results suggested that the SLMs are an efficacious delivery system for the oral administration of IAC, potentially useful for the treatment of others diseases related to an over production of free radicals.

Methods and Materials: A total of 50 patients who underwent radiosurgery for para-IAC meningiomas between 1998 and 2009, which were followed for 2 years, were enrolled. The mean age was 55.8 years (range, 15â75). The mean tumor volume was 6.1 cm 3 (range, 1.0â19.0), the mean tumor length in the IAC was 6.9 mm (range, 1.3â13.3), and the mean prescribed marginal dose was 13.1 Gy (range, 10â15) at an isodose line of 50%. The mean follow-up duration was 46 months (range, 24â122). Results: Eight (16.0%) patients had nonserviceable hearing at the time of surgery. At the last follow-up, the tumor control rate was 94%; unchanged in 17 patients, decreased in 30 patients, and increased in 3 patients. Among 42 patients with serviceable hearing at the time of radiosurgery, it was preserved in 41 (97.6%) patients at the last follow-up. The maximal and mean radiation doses to the cochleae of these 41 patients were 5.8 Gy Â± 0.3 (range, 3.1â11.5) and 4.3 Gy Â± 0.2 (range, 2.2â7.5), respectively. The maximal dose to the cochlea of the patient who lost hearing after radiosurgery was 4.7 Gy. Conclusions: The radiation dose to the cochlea may have the minimal toxic effect on the hearing outcome in patients who undergo radiosurgery for para-IAC meningiomas.\n\n76 FR 66931 - Medicare Program; Accountable Care Organization Accelerated Development Learning Sessions; Center...\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2011-10-28\n\n...] Medicare Program; Accountable Care Organization Accelerated Development Learning Sessions; Center for...

IAC and autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) may mimic sclerosing cholangitis, cholangiocarcinoma, or pancreatic carcinoma. Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical, biochemical, radiological, and histological findings.To study the clinical presentation of and treatment strategy for IAC, we reviewed clinical, serologic, and imaging characteristics, as well as treatment response, in 39 patients with IAC. The majority of patients were men (82%). Clinical features on presentation included obstructive jaundice in 26 patients (67%) and abdominal pain in 20 (51%). Positive IgG4 immunostaining was seen in 27 patients. The median serum IgG4 level before treatment was 769.4âmg/dL (range, 309.1-1229.7âmg/dL). After the steroid therapy, the median serum IgG4 level in 23 patients was 247.0âmg/dL (range, 139.0-355.0âmg/dL). Cholangiograms were available in 36 (92%) patients. Stenosis of the lower part of the common bile duct was found in 26 of 39 patients. Stenosis was diffusely distributed in the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts in 14 of 39 patients. Additionally, strictures of the bile duct were detected in the hilar hepatic lesions in 27 of 39 patients. AIP was the most frequent comorbidity (35/39 in this study) of IAC. Other affected organs included eyes (nâ=â6), salivary glands (sialadenitis, nâ=â10), lymph nodes (mediastinal and axillary, nâ=â3), kidneys (nâ=â2), and the retroperitoneum (retroperitoneal fibrosis, nâ=â2).Regarding treatment, 29 patients were treated with steroids, of whom one underwent pancreatoduodenectomy, and one underwent choledochojejunostomy. Eight patients were treated with biliary stents. The remaining 19 patients took prednisolone alone. Eight patients achieved spontaneous resolution.

Final report\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nCapehart, B.L.\n\n1996-02-01\n\nCommercial energy use costs businesses around $70 billion annually. Many of these businesses are small and medium sized organizations that do not have the resources to help themselves, or to pay for professional engineering services to help reduce their energy costs and improve their economic competitiveness. Energy cost reduction actions with payback times of around two years could save the commercial sector 15--20%, or $10--$15 billion per year. This project was initially intended to evaluate the feasibility of performing commercial energy audits as an adjunct to the industrial audit program run by the US Department of Energy Industrial Office. This program is housed in 30 universities throughout the United States. Formerly known as Energy Analysis and Diagnostic Centers (EADC`s), the university programs are now called Industrial Assessment Centers (IAC`s) to reflect their expansion from energy use analyses to include waste and productivity analyses. The success of the EADC/IAC program in helping the manufacturing sector provides an excellent model for a similar program in the commercial buildings sector. This project has investigated using the EADC/IAC approach to performing energy audits for the commercial sector, and has determined that such an approach is feasible and cost effective.\n\nResults on the application of the methodology for power diagnoses Iac-DOE to Mexican companies; Resultados de la aplicacion de la metodologia de diagnosticos energeticos Iac-DOE a empresas mexicanas\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nAmbriz Garcia, Juan Jose [Universidad Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico, D.F.

The oat starch showed 1.36% of lipids, 32.23% of amylose and low retrogradation capacity (9.19% after 30 days of storage. Although the oat starch has presented high amylose content, its low retrogradation may be due to the presence of lipids that by steric impediment could make it difficult for the polymeric chains to approach. The rheological behavior of oat starch was characterized as pseudoplastic. The low gelatinization temperature (64.71 Â°C of the starch may be related to its higher lipid content.\n\nUtilization of 5 MeV electron accelerator center and perspective\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nTanaka, Hiromi\n\n1990-01-01\n\nElectron beam process gives instantaneous effect as compared with heating process, and has such merits that energy consumption is very small, objects can be treated from outside, harmful chemicals are not used and treatment can be done as packed. The spread of electron beam process is largely due to the results of the development of highly reliable accelerators and utilization technologies, but as observed from all industrial fields, it is limited to only a part. In order to contribute to the solution of problems and the spread of electron beam process, Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Ltd. installed a 5 MeV, 200 kW large power accelerator developed by RDI in USA in the Electron Irradiation Application and Development Center opened in Tsukuba City. The Center was completed in June, 1989, and has carried out the activities of the development of irradiation utilization technologies, test irradiation and entrusted irradiation service. The features of electron beam process are high dose rate, the possibility of on and off as occasion demands, the preparation of radiation sources and the disposal of wastes being unnecessary, and no environmental problem. The industrialized processes, the types, energy and use of electron accelerators, the Tsukuba irradiation facilities and others are reported.

The aim of this study was to use a triaxial accelerometer to compare the three-dimensional centerof- mass accelerations of two groups of ultramarathon runners with distinct performances during different running speeds and distances. Ten runners who participated in the 12-h Taipei International Ultramarathon Race underwent laboratory treadmill testing one month later. They were divided into an elite group (EG; n = 5 and a sub-elite group (SG; n = 5. The triaxial center-of-mass acceleration recorded during a level-surface progressive intensity running protocol (3, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 12 km/h; 5 min each was used for correlation analyses with running distance during the ultramarathon. The EG showed negative correlations between mediolateral (ML acceleration (r = â0.83 to â0.93, p < 0.05, and between anterior-posterior (AP acceleration and running distance (r = â0.8953 to â0.9653, p < 0.05, but not for vertical control of the center of mass. This study suggests that runners reduce stride length to minimize mediolateral sway and the effects of braking on the trunk; moreover, cadence must be increased to reduce braking effects and enhance impetus. Consequently, the competition level of ultramarathons can be elevated.\n\nStart up of the Tandem Accelerator in the Ezeiza Atomic Center\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBianchini, R.; Consorti, S.; Roldan, M.; Llovera, R.; Arenilla, P.; Alvarez, D.E.; Ugarte, R.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nA High Voltage tandem electrostatic accelerator FN model was installed and started up by the Nuclear Regulatory Authority (ARN) on the campus of Ezeiza Atomic Center.

The 12 UD Pelletron tandem accelerator was operated very stably. In addition, the heavy ion post accelerator with interdigital-H structure has worked well, providing additional energy of 2 MeV per charge for heavy ions. The constructions of a new Lamb-shift polarized ion source, a multi-computer control system for the ion sources of the UTTA, an electrostatic inflection system of incident ions for the UTTA, a new beam bunching system, and a new SF 6 gas handling system were under way. The development and performance test of various radiation detector systems were carried out. Two thirds of the research works were performed by using the beam from the Lamb-shift polarized ion source (PIS). A newly constructed fast spin state interchange control system for the PIS made polarization experiment more effective and accurate.

It requires a multidisciplinary personalized approach that includes focal treatments, chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy. Today, the focus of therapy has shifted to eye preservation with the major aim to save the childâs life and to preserve the eyeball as a functioning organ of vision with minimal complications. One of the most promising therapy approaches is selective intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC, by which a cytostatic agent is given directly into the eye. This treatment modality has been shown to provide survival benefit and improvement of quality of life, reducing toxicity and minimizing side effects.\n\nArquitetura do sistema radicular do porta-enxerto de videira 'IAC 766' na Ã©poca de transplante do viveiro para o campo Root architecture of IAC 766 grapevine rootstock in the transplanting from the nursery to the field\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRicardo Sfeir de Aguiar\n\n2006-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Na propagaÃ§Ã£o de porta-enxertos de videira por estaquia em recipientes para posterior transplante ao campo, Ã© importante evitar danos ao sistema radicular.

Jr.\n\n1994-12-01\n\nThe Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) has been in almost continuous operation since the middle 1960s, providing a remarkable opportunity to amass thyratron data. This paper reviews the history of this thyratron usage, focusing primarily on data collected during the last ten years of accelerator operation. There have been two distinct operating conditions during the history of operation at SLAC. Prior to 1985, the fundamental thyratron operating points were 46 kV anode voltage (Epy), 4.2 kA peak current, 3.8 Î¼s equivalent square pulse (esp), with a maximum repetition rate of 360 pulses per second (pps). The accelerator was upgraded during 1985, and the thyratron operating points are now 46 kV Epy, 6.3 kA, 5.4 Î¼s esp, with a maximum repetition rate of 120 pps. The SLAC high-energy physics research program requires that each of the available modulator klystron units provide a stable microwave energy source. Within these constraints, this paper explores historical thyratron lifetimes at SLAC, reviewing the available data to determine how long these thyratrons can be expected to operate before failure currently or recently used in the 243 accelerator modulators\n\nASSOCIAÃÃO ENTRE O ÃNDICE DE ADIPOSIDADE CORPORAL (IAC E ÃNDICE DE MASSA CORPORAL (IMC EM MULHERES PRATICANTES DE TREINAMENTO RESISTIDO\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nWilliam Cordeiro de Souza\n\n2014-04-01\n\nFull Text Available O presente estudo buscou como objetivo realizar uma relaÃ§Ã£o entre o Ã­ndice de adiposidade corporal (IAC e Ã­ndice de massa corporal (IMC em mulheres praticantes de treinamento resistido.

Of greatest interest to the high energy accelerator physics community gathered here is the development of the linear collider concept, and so I shall concentrate most of this paper on a discussion of the present status and future evolution of the SLC. I will also briefly discuss the research and development program that we are carrying out aimed at the realization of the next generation of high-energy linear colliders. SLAC had a major colliding-beam storage-ring program as well, including present rings and design studies on future high-luminosity projects, but time constraints preclude a discussion of them. 8 figs., 3 tabs\n\nNatural and Accelerated Bioremediation Research (NABIR) Field Research Center (FRC) Management Plan\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nWatson, D.B.\n\n2002-02-28\n\nThe Environmental Sciences Division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory has established a Field Research Center (FRC) to support the Natural and Accelerated Bioremediation Research (NABIR) Program on the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Oak Ridge Reservation in Oak Ridge, Tennessee for the DOE Headquarters Office of Biological and Environmental Research within the Office of Science.\n\nEvaluation of the Accelerate Pheno System: Results from Two Academic Medical Centers.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLutgring, Joseph D; Bittencourt, Cassiana; McElvania TeKippe, Erin; Cavuoti, Dominick; Hollaway, Rita; Burd, Eileen M\n\n2018-04-01\n\nRapid diagnostic tests are needed to improve patient care and to combat the problem of antimicrobial resistance. The Accelerate Pheno system (Accelerate Diagnostics, Tucson, AZ) is a new diagnostic device that can provide rapid bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) results directly from a positive blood culture. The device was compared to the standard of care at two academic medical centers. There were 298 blood cultures included in the study, and the Accelerate Pheno system provided a definitive identification result in 218 instances (73.2%). The Accelerate Pheno system provided a definitive and correct result for 173 runs (58.1%). The Accelerate Pheno system demonstrated an overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 94.7%, 98.9%, 83.7%, and 99.7%, respectively. An AST result was available for analysis in 146 instances. The overall category agreement was 94.1% with 12 very major errors, 5 major errors, and 55 minor errors. After a discrepancy analysis, there were 5 very major errors and 4 major errors. The Accelerate Pheno system provided an identification result in 1.4 h and an AST result in 6.6 h; the identification and AST results were 41.5 h and 48.4 h faster than those with the standard of care, respectively. This study demonstrated that the Accelerate Pheno system is able to provide fast and accurate organism identification and AST data. A limitation is the frequency with which cultures required the use of alternative identification and AST methods.

The facility has 3-irradiation ports (rooms) that are 2-rotationg gantry ports and 1-horizontal fixed port. The C235 can accelerate proton to 235 MeV with the beam intensity of 300 nA. The external diameter is a very compact with about 4 m. The radio frequency is 106 MHz, the accelerating voltage is about 60 kV, and the harmonic number is 4. A beam stability of the C235 has an important relation with the uniformity of an irradiation field and is a very difficulty. The measured result indicated that the incident beam position must be into the 0.5-mmÏ circle.

It is important to understand the inconsistency and study the possibility that petaelectronvolt cosmic-ray acceleration could account for the apparently contradictory point and diffuse Î³ -ray spectra. In this work, we propose that the cosmic rays are accelerated up to greater than petaelectronvolts in the GC. The interaction between cosmic rays and molecular clouds is responsible for the multiteraelectronvolt Î³ -ray emissions from both the point and diffuse sources today. Enhanced by the small volume filling factor (VFF) of the clumpy structure, the absorption of the Î³ -rays leads to a sharp cutoff spectrum at tens of teraelectronvolts produced in the GC. Away from the GC, the VFF grows, and the absorption enhancement becomes negligible. As a result, the spectra of Î³ -ray emissions for both point and diffuse sources can be successfully reproduced under such a self-consistent picture. In addition, a âsurviving tailâ at â¼100 TeV is expected from the point source, which can be observed by future projects CTA and LHAASO. Neutrinos are simultaneously produced during proton-proton (PP) collision. With 5â10 years of observations, the KM3Net experiment will be able to detect the petaelectronvolt source according to our calculation.\n\nSistemas Correctores de Campo Para EL Telescopio Cassegrain IAC80\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGalan, M. J.; Cobos, F. J.\n\n1987-05-01\n\nEl proyecto de instrumentaciÃ³n de mayor importancia que ha tenido el Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias en los Ãºltimos afios ha sido el diseflo y construcciÃ³n del te1escopio IAC8O. Este requerÃ­a del esfuerzo con junto en mecÂ´nica, Ã³ptica y electrÃ³nica, lo que facilitÃ³ la estructuraciÃ³n y el crecimiento de los respectivos grupos de trabajo, que posteriormente se integraron en departamentos En su origen (1977), el telescopio IAC80 fue concebido como un sistema clÃ¡sico tipo Cassegrain, con una razÃ³n focal F/i 1.3 para el sistema Casse grain y una razÃ³n focal F/20 para el sistema CoudÃ©. Posteriormente, aunque se mantuvo la filosofia de que el sistema bÃ¡sico fuera el F/11.3, se considerÃ³ conveniente el diseÃ±o de secundarios para razones focales F/16 y F/32, y se eliminÃ³ el de F/20. Sin embargo, dada la importancia relativa que un foco estrictamente fotogrÃ¡fico tiene en un telescopio moderno, diseÃ±ado bÃ¡sicamente para fotometrÃ­a fotoelÃ©ctrica y con un campo util mÃ­nimamente de 40 minutos de arco, se decÃ­diÃ³ Ilevar a cabo el diseÃ±o de un secundario F/8 con un sistema corrector de campo, pero que estuviera formado Ãºnicamente por lentes con superficies esfÃ©ricas para que asl su construcciÃ³n fuera posible en EspaÃ±a Ã³ en MÃ©xico. La creciente utilizaciÃ³n de detectores bidimensionales para fines de investigaciÃ³n astron6mica y la viabilidad de que en un futuro cercano Ã©stos tengan un Ã¡rea sensible cada vez mayor, hicieron atractiva la idea de tener diseÃ±ado un sistema corrector de campo para el foco primario (F/3), con un campo Ãºtil mÃ­nimo de un grado, y tambiÃ©n con la limitante de que sus componentes tuvieron sÃ³lamente supÃ©rficies esfÃ©ricas. Ambos diseÃ±os de los sis-temas correctores de campo se llevaron a cabo, en gran medida, como parte de un proyecto de colaboraciÃ³n e intercambio en el Ã¡rea de diseÃ±o y evaluaciÃ³n de sistemas Ã³pticos.\n\nStanford Linear Accelerator Center selects Verity Ultraseek for public and internal Web Sites\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2004-01-01\n\nVerity Inc., a provider of enterprise software has announced the latest version of its powerful, downloadable Verity(R) Ultraseek(R) enterprise search engine is being used by the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, a research facility funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and operated by Stanford University (1/2 page).\n\nOpportunistic or event-driven maintenance at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAllen, C.W.; Anderson, S.; Erickson, R.; Linebarger, W.; Sheppard, J.C.; Stanek, M.\n\n1997-03-01\n\nThe Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) uses a maintenance management philosophy that is best described as opportunistic or event-driven. Opportunistic maintenance can be defined as a systematic method of collecting, investigating, pre-planning, and publishing a set of proposed maintenance tasks and acting on them when there is an unscheduled failure or repair ''opportunity''. Opportunistic maintenance can be thought of as a modification of the run-to-fail maintenance management philosophy. This maintenance plan was adopted and developed to improve the overall availability of SLAC's linear accelerator, beam delivery systems, and associated controls, power systems, and utilities. In the late 1980's, as the technical complexity of the accelerator facility increased, variations on a conventional maintenance plan were used with mixed results. These variations typically included some type of regular periodic interruption to operations. The periodic shutdowns and unscheduled failures were additive and resulted in unsatisfactory availability. Maintenance issues are evaluated in a daily meeting that "
