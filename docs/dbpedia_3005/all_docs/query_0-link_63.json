This transformation has permitted the field to move on from dosimetric evaluations, case studies, and retrospective reports to well-conducted prospective clinical trials and large and robust database analysis incorporating vast numbers of patients and producing real-world evidence, demonstrating not only clinical benefit efficacy, but also cost-effectiveness. Significantly, particle therapy is genuinely integrated with advances in surgical approaches, the development of targeted and immunotherapeutic agents, and entwined with other radiotherapy modalities. PTCOG 60 offered two days of educational and parallel sessions and three days of multi-session scientific reports, as well as integrated subcommittee meetings.\n\nObjectives for the 60th annual conference were to:\n\nAddress individual needs in compliance with their Continuous Professional Development (CPD) plan.\n\nDiscuss the latest technological and clinical innovations in particle therapy.\n\nIdentify educational resources, networks and other for exchange of knowledge and learning about particle therapy,\n\nDiscuss the current research projects within the Particle Therapy Co-Operative Group (PTCOG) and enhance opportunities for future collaboration between groups of young researchers.\n\nDiscuss the latest developments about practical clinical application of particle therapy.\n\nDescribe diagnostics and treatments in the field of particle radiation therapy.\n\nTarget Audience\n\nHealthcare professionals who treat cancer patients using radiation therapy/particle therapy and specifically:\n\nRadiation Oncologists\n\nMedical Physicists\n\nDosimetrists\n\nResidents\n\nRadiation Therapists\n\nParticle Therapy Cooperative Group (PTCOG) 2022 Committees\n\nPTCOG Executive and Organizing Committees\n\nJay Flanz, Ph.D., PTCOG Chairman\n\nTadashi Kamada, M.D., PTCOG Vice-Chairman\n\nMarco Durante, Ph.D., PTCOG Vice-Chairman\n\nMartin Jermann, MSc, PTCOG Secretary\n\nMinesh P Mehta, M.D., Miami Cancer Institute - Baptist Health South Florida\n\nAlonso Gutierrez, Ph.D., MBA, Miami Cancer Institute - Baptist Health South Florida\n\nAndrew Wroe, Ph.D., DABR, Miami Cancer Institute - Baptist Health South Florida\n\nNikki Mejia, Miami Cancer Institute - Baptist Health South Florida\n\nPTCOG60 Scientific Program Subcommittee Members\n\nMichael Story, Ph.D.\n\nCo-Chairman of Scientific Program Subcommittee, Biology\n\nAnita Mahajan, M.D.\n\nCo-Chairman of Scientific Program Subcommittee, Clinics\n\nAntony J.

Flint1, David Martinus1, Broderick X. Turner1, Scott J. Bright1, Mandira Manandhar1, Poliana C. Marinello1, Tingshi Su1, Simona F. Shaitelman2, Gabriel O. Sawakuchi1\n\n1MD Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Radiation Physics, Houston, USA\n\n2MD Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Radiation Oncology, Houston, USA\n\nIntroduction: PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have improved survival for BRCA mutated breast cancers (BC). It is unclear how distinct forms of radiation differentially interact with PARPi and if they can be used to further improve outcomes. Protons induce more DNA lesions than x-rays due to their higher ionizing density. If not properly repaired, DSBs can generate micronuclei or induce cellular senescence, both affecting immune response. We investigated the effects of combining PARPi with x-rays or protons on clonogenic cell survival, micronuclei and senescence in the context of BRCA1 mutation.\n\nMethods: Clonogenic survival, quantified micronuclei/nucleus and radio-induced senescence (β-galactosidase activity) data for human BC cell lines with a BRCA1 mutation (HCC1937, MDA-MB-436) and their isogenic cell lines (HCC1937-BRCA, MDA-MB-436-BRCA) were obtained. Cells were irradiated with 6 MV x-rays or 9.9 keV/mm protons (dose-weighted LET in water) ± PARPi (Olaparib).\n\nResults: Survival fraction was lower after protons compared to x-rays. PARPi treatment appears to result in greater radiosensitization after proton compared to x-ray radiation as assessed by survival assay. The number of MN/nucleus was significantly higher in HCC1937 than HCC1937-BRCA. Senescence was significantly higher for HCC1937 compared to HCC1937-BRCA. Radio-induced senescence is not affected by PARPi treatment but is amplified after proton radiation compared to x-rays. Data for MDA-MB-436 (BRCA+/-) are being collected.\n\nConclusions: In vitro, PARPi treatment in BRCA1 mutated cell lines leads to a greater sensitivity to radiation. This sensitivity is higher after protons compared to x-rays (survival fraction, micronuclei and senescence), but understanding of associated immune effects warrants further investigation.\n\nO 002 - Defective homologous recombination predicts increased responsiveness to carbon ion radiotherapy\n\nAnthony Davis1, Brock Sishc1, Janapriya Saha1, Katy Swancutt1, Lianghao Ding1, Elizabeth Polsdofer1, Angelica Facoetti2, Benjamin Chen1, Debabrata Saha1, Mario Ciocca2, Todd Aguilera1, Michael Story1\n\n1University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Radiation Oncology, Dallas, USA\n\n2Medical Physics Unit & Research Department- Foundazione Centro Nazionale di Adroterapia Oncologica CNAO, Radiation Oncology, Pavia, Italy\n\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal malignancy that is expected by 2020 to become the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths globally. The 5-year overall survival rate for patients with PDAC is <10%, which is due to the majority of pancreatic cancer patients presenting with advanced disease and the inherent resistance of PDAC to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Clinical trials have suggested that carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) used concurrently with gemcitabine is effective against unresectable locally advanced PDAC. We have initiated pre-clinical studies to identify patients who would most likely benefit from CIRT. In particular, we have focused on examining the role of an aberrant DNA damage response (DDR) in PDAC treatment responsiveness. This is supported by exome sequencing data of >150 surgically excised PDACs that showed that >35% of PDAC tumors have an alteration in a DDR gene and that these alterations correlate with a poor outcome. In this study, we utilized a panel of PDAC cell lines, whose survival fraction of 2 Gy (γ-rays) ranged from average to radioresistant, to determine if CIRT can overcome photon radioresistance. We identified that cell lines defective in the DNA double-strand break repair pathway homologous recombination (HR) pathway are exquisitely sensitive to CIRT. Furthermore, targeting a radioresistant PDAC cell line with the HR inhibitor B02 results in marked increased sensitivity to CIRT in vitro. Finally, we will present initial results showing the identification of DDR-related biomarker(s) that predict responsiveness to CIRT.\n\nO 003 - Inhibition of Glutaminase-1 (GLS1) increases the relative biological effectiveness of proton radiotherapy and increases levels of lipid peroxidation\n\nScott Bright1, Rishab Kolochina1, David Flint1, David Martinus1, Mandira Manandhar1, Mariam Ben Kacem1, Poliana C Marinello1, Tingshi Su1, Simona F Shaitelman2, Gabriel Sawakuchi1\n\n1MD Anderson, Radiation Physics, Houston, USA\n\n2MD Anderson, Radiation Oncology, Houston, USA\n\nGlutaminase-1 (GLS1) is important in redox homeostasis, producing glutamate from glutamine. GLS1 downstream products include nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and glutathione (GSH). GSH serves as a first line defense against oxidative stress by neutralizing reactive oxygen species and as such is an important factor in radiation response. Many cancers display dysregulated glutamine metabolism compared to normal tissue and GLS1 has therefore proved an attractive therapeutic target with several GLS1 inhibitors in development. We hypothesized the disruption of GSH by GLS1 inhibition would render cells radiosensitive. We performed clonogenic survival and lipid peroxidation assays in NCI-H460 cells exposed to 6 MV x-rays and 9.9 keV/μm protons to determine the radiosensitization and lipid peroxidation levels induced by IACS-6274 treatment, a GLS1 inhibitor discovered at MD Anderson and currently in clinical trials. We observed that IACS-6274, could radiosensitize NCI-H460 to x-rays and protons (Figure 1A). We also observed that the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) was significantly increased in the presence of IACS-6274 compared to vehicle (Figure 1B). Our data also suggest that protons combined with IACS-6274 leads to the greatest increase in lipid peroxidation (Figure 2), a known step in the cell death pathway, ferroptosis. These results suggest protons synergize with GLS1 inhibition. It is therefore an attractive combination for further development. Our results also suggest that cell death may occur through ferroptosis, which is more prevalent in cancer cells compared to normal tissue.\n\nO 004 - Relating proton LETd to biological response of salivary glands using PSMA-PET in clinical patients\n\nDirk Wagenaar1, Roel J.H.M. Steenbakkers1, Johannes A. Langendijk1, Vineet Mohan2, Wouter Vogel2, Stefan Both1\n\n1Department of Radiation Oncology- University Medical Center Groningen- University of Groningen, Radiation Oncology, Groningen, Netherlands\n\n2Dutch Cancer Institute NKI, Radiation Oncology, Amsterdam, Netherlands\n\nPurpose: A recent study investigated the use of PSMA-PET in monitoring loss of secretory cells in salivary glands of head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. The purpose of the current study was to measure variations in RBE in salivary glands of patients treated with proton therapy.\n\nMethods: Six patients treated with proton therapy were included. These patients received a PET-CT scan using 68Ga (N=1) or 18F (N=5) PSMA before treatment (baseline) and one month after the last fraction (follow-up). All analyses were performed in RayStation v9AR (v8.99.30.71). Physical dose (Dphys), D*LETd and the follow-up PSMA-PET scan were deformed to the baseline PET-CT using deformable image registration. Parotid gland delineations were adjusted to include voxels which had an uptake of ≥5 g/ml in the baseline PSMA-PET scan. Voxels were smoothed in a 6-mm cube to reduce effects of noise and registration errors. Relative PSMA uptake was defined as the ratio of uptake on the follow-up and baseline PSMA-PET scans. The LETd was calculated from the D*LETd and Dphys.\n\nResults: In four out of six patients a relation between relative PSMA-uptake and LETd could be observed, where the relative PSMA uptake was lower as voxels had higher LET but identical physical dose (Figure 2).\n\nConclusion: An RBE-LETd relation is shown for the biological response of parotid glands as measured using PSMA-PET. This study shows PSMA-PET can be used to investigate the spatial distribution of RBE of the salivary glands in a clinical setting.\n\nO 005 - Early cellular response to pMBRT: a mechanistic study\n\nAnnaïg Bertho1, Ramon Ortiz1, Cristèle Gilbert1, Julie Espenon1, Marjorie Juchaux1, Annalisa Patriarca2, Ludovic De Marzi2, Yolanda Prezado1\n\n1Institut Curie, U1021/UMR 3347, Orsay, France\n\n2Institut Curie, Hospital complex, Orsay, France\n\nProton minibeam radiation therapy (pMBRT) is a novel therapeutic approach which uses spatially modulated narrow (< 1 mm) proton beams [1]. In comparison to conventional irradiations, pMBRT has displayed a remarkable reduction in neurotoxicity [2] and an equivalent or superior tumor control in small animals [3]. All of this despite the highly heterogeneous dose distributions - challenging the dogma that a homogenous dose is required to achieve tumor control. These aforementioned distributions consist of high (peak) doses along the path of the minibeams and low (valley) doses in between them. While the underlying biological mechanisms responsible for pMBRT efficiency remain elusive, our previous in vivo evaluation highlighted a significant involvement of the immune system in the response to pMBRT [4]. Consequently, we conducted an in vitro mechanistic study on cell death and immunogenicity of pMBRT using astrocyte and glioma cell lines. We observed that pMBRT induced more apoptosis compared to standard proton therapy (PT) at 24h after irradiation in the astrocytes. Late apoptosis was also increased compared to standard PT, indicating that the timing of cell death can be impacted by pMBRT. Immunogenic cell death can mimic morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis [5]. In contrast, no difference in cell death was observed in the glioma cell line as a function of the irradiation mode, thus suggesting that the mean minibeam dose might indeed be a good indicator for tumor response. The analysis of key immunogenic factors such as ATP, HMGB1 and Calreticulin is ongoing and will also be presented.\n\nO 006 - A multimodal 3D image registration toolkit to investigate proton radiation-induced brain injury\n\nMarc Boucsein1,2, Sindi Nexhipi3,4, Robin Koch1,2, Theresa Suckert3,4,5, Elke Beyreuther3,6, Antje Dietrich3,5, Armin Lühr3,4,5,7, Emanuel Bahn1,2,8,9\n\n1German Cancer Research Center DKFZ, Clinical Cooperation Unit Radiation Oncology, Heidelberg, Germany\n\n2Heidelberg University Hospital, Radiation Oncology, Heidelberg, Germany\n\n3OncoRay - National Center for Radiation Research in Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany\n\n4Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Institute of Radiooncology - OncoRay, Dresden, Germany\n\n5German Cancer Consortium DKTK, Partner Site Dresden- and German Cancer Research Center DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany\n\n6Helmholtz - Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Institute of Radiation Physics, Dresden, Germany\n\n7TU Dortmund University- Faculty of Physics, Medical Physics and Radiotherapy, Dortmund, Germany\n\n8National Center for Tumor Diseases NCT, Integrative Radiation Oncology, Heidelberg, Germany\n\n9Heidelberger Institut für Radioonkologie HIRO, Quantitative klinische Strahlenbiologie, Heidelberg, Germany\n\nPurpose: In proton brain radiotherapy, late radiation-induced injuries represent serious complications. To investigate their formation, we use a mouse model and irradiated brain sub-regions with a highly collimated proton Bragg peak. By co-aligning the radiation input distributions (dose and LET) with fluorescently stained histological slices, we aim to perform dose-response analysis on a single-cell level throughout the whole brain. This allows detailed insights into how proton radiation causes cellular changes associated with late radiation-induced injuries.\n\nMethods and Results: As manual processing is time-consuming, our goal was to accelerate, automatize and optimize the preprocessing and registration steps. We have developed a toolkit for automated co-registration of histological slices with CT, MRI and histology- or MRI-based atlases, consisting of three main parts: First the preprocessing, second, histological slices are reconstructed in 3D, and third the automated registration of the different image modalities. We used self-developed packages (https://github.com/DKFZ-TMTRR) within the python-based viewer NAPARI, which are designed for memory-efficient analysis of large image data sets, allow efficient monitoring throughout the whole process, and offer the option of manual interventions.\n\nDiscussion: In summary, we have developed an image registration toolkit to combine clinically relevant brain image modalities in one interactive registration pipeline. Altogether, this yields an accurate co-alignment of the brain with the administered dose distributions within one reference coordinate system, minimizing spatial inaccuracies between the modalities, as presented in Figures 1&2. As a result, radiation input parameters are defined for every single cell with high confidence, allowing for statistical analysis of radiation effects on an unprecedented level of detail.\n\nO 007 - Predicting radiation-induced lymphopenia in lung cancer patients across institutions after treatment with photon- and proton-based radiotherapy\n\nYejin Kim1,2,3, Ibrahim Chamseddine2, Ting Xu4, Steven H. Lin4, Zhongxing Liao4, Yeona Cho3, Jin Sung Kim3, Hong In Yoon3, Seungryong Cho1, Clemens Grassberger2\n\n1KAIST, Nuclear and Quantum Engineering, Daejeon, Korea Republic of\n\n2Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Radiation Oncology, Boston, USA\n\n3Yonsei Cancer Center, Radiation Oncology, Seoul, Korea Republic of\n\n4MD Anderson Cancer Center, Radiation Oncology, Houston, USA\n\nPurpose: Radiation-Induced Lymphopenia (RIL) has been correlated to inferior survival and hypothesized to adversely impact adjuvant immunotherapy. This study aims to develop and compare RIL prediction models after both Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) or Proton Therapy (PT) for locally-advanced lung cancer.\n\nMethods and Materials: In total, 178 patients were collected; 45 IMRT patients from Yonsei Cancer Center and 92 IMRT and 41 PT patients from MD Anderson Cancer Center. Clinical variables and Dose Volume Histograms (DVHs) of normal lung and heart were used to predict Grade(G)4 RIL at the end of radiotherapy. Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forests (RF) and a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that considers the entire DVHs using convolution layers were developed. Models were compared to each other using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (AUC).\n\nResults: Incidence of G4RIL was 16%/10% after IMRT/PT respectively. For IMRT, predicting G4 RIL using CNN outperformed other methods, increasing the average AUC from 0.69 to 0.74. Model performance significantly decreased when including PT patients for all models to 0.62-0.65, with only small outperformance of CNNs. Standard deviations indicate lower model robustness for mixed IMRT/PT cohorts (0.04) compared to IMRT only (0.02).\n\nConclusion: CNN approaches to include DVH information to predict RIL are successful in IMRT patients, but inhomogeneity in DVHs and baseline patient heterogeneity in combined IMRT/PT cohorts affects model training and robustness. Further research is required to determine if this is due to fundamental differences in the interaction with circulating lymphocytes between IMRT and PT.\n\nO 008 - 12C radiotherapy for individuals whose tumors are considered radioresistant may require personalization of RBE to be fully potent\n\nMichael Story1, Brock Sishc1, Anthony Davis1, Lianghao Ding1, Elizabeth Polsdofer1, Angelica Facoetti2, Mario Ciocca3, Arnold Pompos1, Debabrata Saha1\n\n1University of Texas- Southwestern Medical Center, Radiation Oncology, Dallas, USA\n\n2Foundation CNAO, Medical Physics and Biology, Pavia, Italy\n\n3Foundation CNAO, Medical Physics, Pavia, Italy\n\nHead and neck squamous cell carcinoma is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide. 30% of patients experience locoregional recurrence with median survival less than one year. Factors contributing to treatment failure include inherent resistance to X-rays, hypoxia and immune suppression amongst others. However, the unique properties of 12C radiotherapy make its application well suited to the treatment of HNSCC. We examined the 12C radioresponse of five HNSCC cell lines, whose surviving fraction at 3.5 Gy ranged from average to resistant when compared to a larger panel of 38 cell lines to identify biomarkers predictive of low LET radioresistance. A 37 gene signature was able to place cells in their respective radiosensitivity cohort with an accuracy of 86% which can be reduced to 13 genes if only segregating radioresistant cell lines against all others. Subsequently, Cells were irradiated with 12C using a SOBP with an average LET of 80 keV/μm. RBE values varied depending upon endpoint used. Radioresistant cells were characterized by an enrichment of genes associated with radioresistance and survival mechanisms including but not limited to G2/M Checkpoint MTORC1, HIF1a, and PI3K/AKT/MTOR signaling. These data were used in an in silico-based modeling approach to evaluate tumor control probability after 12C irradiation that compared clinically used treatment schedules with fixed RBE values vs the RBEs determined for each cell line. The modeling suggests that there is a likelihood that using a generalized RBE will not provide a fully potent therapy to individuals with radioresistant disease irrespective of selection for 12C radiotherapy.\n\nO 009 - Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) update: current status of clinical trials, accelerator technologies, drug carriers and treatment planning strategies\n\nWill Jin1, Crystal Seldon1, Michael Butkus1, Wolfgang Sauerwein2, Huan Giap3\n\n1University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Radiation Oncology, Miami, USA\n\n2Deutsche Gesellschaft für Bor-Neutroneneinfangtherapie DGBNCT, Radiation Oncology, Essen, Germany\n\n3Nancy N and JC Lewis Cancer and Research Pavilion, Radiation Oncology, Hilton Head Island, USA\n\nBoron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is based on the nuclear capture and fission reactions that occur when 10B is irradiated with low-energy (0.0025 eV) thermal neutrons. The resulting 10B(n,α)7Li capture reaction produces high linear energy transfer (LET) α particles, helium nuclei (4He) and recoiling lithium-7 (7Li) atoms. The short range (5-9 μm) of the α particles limits the destructive effects within the boron-containing cells. In theory, BNCT can selectively destroy malignant cells while sparing adjacent normal tissue at the cellular levels by delivering a single fraction of radiation with high LET particles. Early clinical works on BNCT are based on unoptimized neutron sources from nuclear reactors, limited carriers with BPA and BSH, and crude treatment planning approaches. A total of more than 200 patients were reported on 17 clinical trials for GBM, head and neck, and melanoma which are shown in Table 1. Table 2 showed current prospective trials. Recent BNCT re-emergence are due to several developments: (1) small footprint accelerator-based neutron sources, (2) high specificity third generation Boron carriers based on monoclonal antibodies, nanoparticles, etc. (3) treatment planning software and patient positioning devices that optimize treatment delivery and consistency. There are currently 4 vendors (2 from US, and 2 from Japan) providing accelerators that are optimized for clinical uses with custom neutron spectrum, beam shaping assembly, patient positioning devices, IGRT, and quantitative in-vivo imaging. Current treatment planning approaches are done with pre-treatment PET/CT scan and Monte Carlo modeling with novel drug carriers with high tumor and normal tissue ratio will be discussed.\n\nO 010 - Global review of BNCT clinical experience and future prospects\n\nHanna Koivunoro1, Leena Kankaanranta2, Tetsuya Yamamoto3, Shinji Kawabata4, Heikki Joensuu2\n\n1Neutron Therapeutics, Medical Physics, Helsinki, Finland\n\n2Helsinki University Hospital and University of Helsinki, Department of Oncology, Helsinki, Finland\n\n3Yokohama City University Hospital, Department of Neurosurgery, Yokohama, Japan\n\n4Osaka Medical and Pharmaceutical University, Department of Neurosurgery, Osaka, Japan\n\nIn boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT), targeted high-LET radiotherapy to cancerous tissues is achieved by combining external irradiation with low energetic neutrons and a carrier drug that transports boron-10 selectively into cancer cells. First clinical BNCT studies were carried out using a nuclear research reactor as the neutron source in the absence of medical devices capable of producing a high intensity neutron beam in the clinic. The reactor-based phase I/II trials and case studies supported the concept of BNCT in the treatment of several types of human cancer including glioblastoma, head and neck cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, hepatoma, some sarcomas, and cutaneous malignancies, and in extramammary Paget's disease and meningioma, despite the studies were often carried out in patient populations with inoperable/recurrent disease. Single-agent L-boronophenylalanine (L-BPA) was the most frequently used boron carrier compound, sometimes in combination with borocaptate sodium (BSH). In phase I/II studies on locally recurrent or advanced head and neck cancer, about 70% of the patients achieved either complete or partial response with BNCT, and many of the remaining patients had stable disease as their best response suggesting substantial activity for L-BPA-based BNCT in this patient population. At present, several types of accelerator-based neutron sources are under an approval process for medical use worldwide, and one such device has already been approved in Japan. In this review we summarize the clinical results obtained with BNCT including data from the published and still on-going accelerator-based trials and discuss of the future of BNCT delivery in hospital environments.\n\nO 011 - The NECTAR project: Could neutron capture therapy be the unexpected weapon to fight Alzheimer's disease?\n\nValeria Pascali1,2, Saverio Altieri1,2, Diego Alberti3, Valeria Bitonto3, Sebastiano Maria Salomone Micocci3, Simonetta Geninatti-Crich3, Annamaria Deagostino4, Emanuele Azzi4, Polyssena Renzi4, Nicoletta Protti1,2\n\n1University of Pavia, Physics Department, Pavia, Italy\n\n2National Institute of Nuclear Physics INFN, Pavia Unit, Pavia, Italy\n\n3University of Torino, Department of Biotechnology and Health Sciences, Torino, Italy\n\n4University of Torino, Department of Chemistry, Torino, Italy\n\nNECTAR (NEutron Capture Enhanced Treatment of neurotoxic Amyloid aggRegates) project, funded by the European Commission, aims to study the effectiveness of low-energy neutron-induced capture reactions in the degradation of β-amyloid (Aβ) protein aggregates involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is the most common form of dementia characterized by the accumulation of Aβ aggregates in the brain. After several decades of discomforting trials, last year aducanumab, a monoclonal antibody able to block the progression of AD, was approved by USA-FDA. Nonetheless, several aspects of AD pathogenesis and progression are unclear thus further studies and innovative treatments must be pursued. The innovative idea of the NECTAR project is to exploit the secondary particles produced by the neutron capture reactions (on B-10 and Gd-157) to destroy the Aβ aggregates, which size couple well to the short range of reaction products, promoting their depolymerization. The gamma produced by neutron capture reactions will be investigated as a promoter of the Aβ clearance by the glia cells. On behalf of NECTAR Consortium, the talk will present the preliminary results achieved. In particular, the first in vitro experiments conducted at the nuclear reactor of Pavia University, accompanied by Monte Carlo simulations focused on a first evaluation of microdosimetric energy deposition. In view of the future developments of the NECTAR project, macroscopic scale simulations will also be presented in order to describe a first study concerning the irradiation effects on AD transgenic mice.\n\nO 012 - Contributions to BNCT dosimetry in normal lung through optical density analysis in autoradiographic images\n\nMaría Sol Espain1,2, Agustina Portu1,2, Marcela Alejandra Garabalino2, María Silvina Olivera3, Gustavo Santa Cruz3, Verónica Andrea Trivillin1,2, Paula Ramos2, Ana Mailén Dattoli Viegas1,4, Andrea Monti Hughes1,2, Sergio Ferraris5, Guillermo Belerenian5, Fernando Lange5, Gisela Saint Martin2, Emiliano César Cayetano Pozzi6, Paula Curotto6, Silvia Inés Thorp7, Amanda Elena Schwint1,2, Sara Josefina González2,4\n\n1National Research Council CONICET, n/a, Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\n2National Atomic Energy Commission, Radiobiology, Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\n3National Atomic Energy Commisssion, BNCT Department, Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\n4National Atomic Energy Commission, Computational Dosimetry and Treatment Planning Division- BNCT Department, Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\n5Maimonides University, Center of Research and Development of Integral Models CIDME, Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\n6National Atomic Energy Commission- Ezeiza Atomic Center, Research and Production Reactors, Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\n7Ezeiza Atomic Center- National Atomic Energy Commission, Instrumentation and Control Department, Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\nWithin the context of the multi-institutional Argentine project “Therapeutic Potential of BNCT for the Treatment of Multiple Lung Metastases: Feasibility and therapeutic efficacy study at an experimental level of a novel ex-vivo irradiation protocol”, the validity of the ovine model as an adequate human surrogate in terms of boron kinetics in clinically relevant tissues was established [1], and neutron autoradiography technique was extended to study the boron microdistribution in normal and metastatic lung from BDIX rats [2]. A new boron biodistribution study of a normal sheep was performed, infusing boronophenylalanine-fructose (350mg/kg) for 40 min, and samples of lung and other tissues were extracted for boron determination. ICP-OES measurements were carried out, and sections of normal lung were processed to obtain autoradiographic images. Ongoing thermographic analysis seeks to correlate the boron distribution in the organ with its thermal evolution during cryopreservation. At the microscopic level, a preferential uptake of BPA in the broncho-vascular tree was observed (Figure 1). Optical density measurements were performed in order to study this trend, as it could explain potential vascular damage in normal lung after BNCT. These results will be used to contribute to dosimetry optimization in a clinical scenario. Computational simulations were used to study the phenomenon of heat transport in the lung volume and thus understand certain observed spatial correlations between temperature and boron concentration.\n\nO 013 - Development of a novel accelerator system and new targeted drugs for BNCT\n\nKendall Morrison1, Michael Torgov2\n\n1TAE Life Sciences, Drug Development, Santa Monica, USA\n\nBNCT development has been hindered by a number of practical hurdles, particularly the need for a nuclear reactor as a source of neutrons and the reliance on poorly soluble boronophenylalanine (BPA) for boron delivery. At TAE Life sciences we are developing a new neutron source and drugs to overcome these hurdles. We have developed a compact, low energy neutron spectrum (2.5 MeV proton energy) tandem accelerator operating at 10mA with a lithium target generating neutrons in the epithermal spectrum ideal for BNCT. We are currently completing the installation of the first of these tandem accelerators at a large hospital in Xiamen, China. In addition to developing this modern neutron source we are also testing novel boronated small molecules as alternatives to BPA. These have been designed to have good solubility, cellular uptake and retention. These compounds have been extensively in vitro and in vivo and we have shown that, in addition to their easier formulation, they can deliver 2-3 times more boron across multiple cell lines and tumor models than can be achieved with BPA. We will present design features of our tandem accelerator as well as in vitro and in vivo data regarding boron delivery using our novel compounds.\n\nO 014 - Variable RBE for meningioma helium ion therapy: from the LBNL experience toward state-of-the-art helium ion therapy\n\nThomas Tessonnier1,2,3, Stewart Mein2,4,5,6, Hoeltgen Line1, Held Thomas1, Eichkorn Tanja1, Harrabi Semi1, Debus Jürgen1,5,6,7, Haberer Thomas7, Mairani Andrea2,4,8\n\n1Heidelberg University Hospital, Department of Radiation Oncology, Heidelberg, Germany\n\n2National Center for Tumor Diseases NCT, Division of Molecular and Translational Radiation Oncology, Heidelberg, Germany\n\n3Heidelberg Ion Beam Center, Medical Physics - BioPT group, Heidelberg, Germany\n\n4Heidelberg Ion Beam Center, BioPT group, Heidelberg, Germany\n\n5German Cancer Research Center DKFZ, Heidelberg Institute of Radiation Oncology HIRO, Heidelberg, Germany\n\n6German Cancer Research Center DKFZ, Clinical Cooperation Unit Radiation Oncology, Heidelberg, Germany\n\n7Heidelberg Ion Beam Center, Ion Beam Therapy Center, Heidelberg, Germany\n\n8National Centre of Oncological Hadrontherapy CNAO, Medical Physics, Pavia, Italy\n\nFollowing commissioning of the first clinically validated treatment planning system (TPS) for helium ion therapy, an evaluation of helium ions versus proton therapy in a 20 patient cohort for meningioma was performed. Assessment of the selected biological model (a modified microdosimetric kinetic model), corresponding inputs sensitivity (for (α/β)x=2Gy) and clinical impact of helium ion beams is performed in the context of bedrock clinical trial data from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and on-going treatment programs at the Heidelberg Ion-beam Therapy Center (HIT). Commissioning results confirm the reliability of the first clinical helium ion therapy TPS. Helium ion therapy exhibited statistically significant superior CTV coverage and reductions in low-dose bath in normal tissue compared to proton therapy. Studies indicate the selected biological model and input parameters are appropriate for clinical application and consistent with respect to known uncertainty of RBE prediction for ion therapy and against available in vivo data for radio-response. Mean RBE predictions in the target volume were ∼2.1 while ranging from 1.8 to ∼4 for clinically relevant dose level for normal tissues and OARs. RBE model predictions for the clinic were verified against in-vivo biological readouts and clinical outcome for OAR collected at LBNL. This work paves the way for further and upcoming trails and on-site studies using the established clinical procedure for treatment planning and delivery for raster-scanned helium ion beam therapy. The first helium treatment was performed at HIT in summer 2021.\n\nO 015 - Assessment of boron compounds on the biological effectiveness of proton therapy\n\nMandira Manandhar1, Scott Bright1, David Flint1, David Martinus1, Rishab Kolachina1, Mariam Ben Kacem1, Chad Lee2, Kendall Morrison2, Simona Shaitelman1, Gabriel Sawakuchi1\n\n1UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Radiation Physics, Houston, USA\n\n2TAE Life Sciences, TAE Life Sciences, Foothill Ranch, USA\n\nPurpose: To investigate whether alpha particles generated through proton-boron fusion reactions is sufficient to enhance the biological effectiveness of the proton beams by adding sodium borocaptate (BSH) or 4-borono-L-phenylalanine (BPA) to cells irradiated with protons.\n\nMethods: We performed clonogenic survival assays in DU145 prostate cancer cells treated with 80.4 ppm BSH or 86.9 ppm BPA, or their respective vehicles, after irradiation with 6 MV x-rays, a low liner energy transfer (LET) (1.2 keV/μm) proton beam and a higher LET(9.9 keV/μm) proton beam. gH2AX and 53BP1 foci were measured at 1 h and 24 h post radiation in similar conditions.\n\nResults: BSH radiosensitized DU145 cells to photons and protons. However, no difference was found in sensitization enhancement ratio (SER) or the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for BSH-treated versus BSH-untreated cells irradiated with photons or both proton beams. No differences were found in gH2AX or 53BP1 foci or gH2AX/53BP1 colocalized foci for BSH-treated versus BSH-untreated cells across radiation types. BPA did not radiosensitize DU145 cells to either radiation types. Similarly, no difference in SER, RBE, gH2AX and 53BP1 foci or gH2AX/53BP1 colocalized foci in DU145 cells were observed in BPA-treated versus BPA-untreated DU145 cells.\n\nConclusions: Treatment with 11B, at concentrations of 80.4 ppm from BSH or 86.9 ppm from BPA, had no effect on the biological effectiveness of proton beams in DU145 cells. Our results agree with published theoretical calculations indicating that the contribution of alpha particles from boron-proton fusion reactions to the total absorbed dose and biological effectiveness is negligible.\n\nO 016 - Biosensor for Deconvolution of Individual Cell Fate in Response to Ion Beam Irradiation.\n\nMartin Niklas1, Schlegel Julian1, Liew Hans1, Rein Katrin1, Abdollahi Amir1, Debus Juergen2\n\n1German Cancer Research Center, Molecular & Translational Radiation Oncology E210, Heidelberg, Germany\n\n2University Hospital Heidelberg, Radiation Oncology, Heidelberg, Germany\n\nClonogenic survival assay constitutes the gold standard method for quantifying radiobiological effects. However, it neglects cellular radiation response variability and heterogenous energy deposition by ion beams in ion beam cancer therapy on the microscopic scale. We introduce Cell-Fit-HD4D, a biosensor that enables a deconvolution of individual cell fate in response to the microscopic energy deposition as visualized by optical microscopy. Cell-Fit-HD4D enables single-cell dosimetry in clinically relevant complex radiation fields by correlating microscopic beam parameters with biological endpoints. Decrypting the ion beam's energy deposition and molecular effects at the single cell level has the potential to improve our understanding of radiobiological dose concepts as well as radiobiological study approaches in general.\n\nO 017 - Evaluation of biological scaffolds as a 3D tumour environment for studies on the impact of XRT and CIRT\n\nAlexandra Charalampopoulou1, Amelia Barcellini2, Stefania Cesari3, Antonia Icaro Cornaglia4, Stefania Croce5, Silvia Molinelli6, Ester Orlandi2, Marco Pullia6, Alessandro Vanoli7, Angelica Facoetti1\n\n1National Center for Oncological Hadrontherapy CNAO, Radiobiology, Pavia, Italy\n\n2National Center for Oncological Hadrontherapy CNAO, Clinical, Pavia, Italy\n\n3Foundation I.R.C.C.S Polyclinic San Matteo, Molecular Medicine, Pavia, Italy\n\n4University of Pavia, Public Health- Experimental and Forensic Medicine, Pavia, Italy\n\n5Foundation I.R.C.C.S Polyclinic San Matteo, Surgical Sciences, Pavia, Italy\n\n6National Center for Oncological Hadrontherapy CNAO, Medical Physics, Pavia, Italy\n\n7Foundation I.R.C.C.S Polyclinic San Matteo, General Surgery, Pavia, Italy\n\nBackground: 3D biologic scaffolds (Figure 1) promote cell viability, interactions and proliferation, recreating an environment suitable for the diffusion of oxygen, nutrients and cell growth factors. This work aims to: 1) assess the feasibility of bioscaffolds to reproduce the tumour environment for radiation effect studies; 2) investigate the response of radioresistant tumour cells cultured in this 3D model when exposed to XRT and CIRT.\n\nMaterials and methods: Mucosal melanoma HMV-II and pancreatic PANC-1 cells were seeded in bioscaffolds obtained by subunits of decellularized porcine liver and irradiated with 2 Gy and 4 Gy of photons and carbon ions. Every 7 days for 4 weeks, scaffolds were fixed, embedded in paraffin and subsequently sectioned; their histological sections were stained and evaluated (Figure 2).\n\nResults: With regards to the 1st aim: tumor cells exhibited infiltrative behaviour into the scaffolds maintaining different morphological features consistent with the cytotype without dedifferentiation. Concerning the 2nd endpoint, HMV-II and PANC-1 irradiated cells showed a different response to LET: CIRT seemed to have a more severe effect on PANC-1 than HMV-II cells in terms of molecular alteration (binucleated cells with increased nuclei size, cytoplasm disaggregation, diapedesis). Melanin production of HMV-II cells was premature in the scaffolds treated with XRT compared to CIRT (14 days versus 21 days, respectively).\n\nConclusions: Bioscaffolds are a suitable radiobiological 3D study model. XRT and CIRT cause different morphological damages to PANC-1 and HMV-II cells in the bioscaffolds.\n\nO 018 - Proton therapy could offer a biologic advantage in the treatment of recurrent medulloblastoma\n\nTien Tang1, David Flint2, Scott Bright2, David Grosshans3, M. Waleed Gaber1\n\n1Baylor College of Medicine, Pediatrics, Houston, USA\n\n2University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Radiation Physics, Houston, USA\n\n3University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Radiation Oncology, Houston, USA\n\nMedulloblastoma is the most common pediatric brain tumor. Despite aggressive treatment, recurrent medulloblastoma remains a challenge. One possible approach to overcome these treatment resistant tumors is the use of protons, which potentially have differing patterns of biological damage. In this study, we aimed to determine if proton irradiation might be used to overcome photon-resistant medulloblastoma cell line survival. To recapitulate, a recurrent medulloblastoma cellular model, Daoy cells were irradiated with fractionated doses of 2Gy photon (120Kvp, 25mA, ∑50Gy). Clonogenic assays were used to verify photon radio-resistance and compare response between radiation modalities. Survival curves generated from the assay were used to calculate D10 (dose for 10% survival). To explore differential DNA damage, following 2Gy exposure, cells were immunostained with DNA double-strand break markers γ-H2AX and 53BP1. Results from the clonogenic assays, revealed the photon-resistant cell line had a significantly higher D10, x-ray than wild-type, 7.14±0.08Gy and 4.99±0.03Gy respectively, when exposed to photon and thus confirmed the model. Proton therapy (9.9KeV/um) was found to significantly radiosensitize the photon-resistant cell line (D10, proton=4.42±0.25Gy, compared to photon radiation) but not wild-type (D10, proton=6.11±1.55Gy). As expected, there were significantly more DNA damage, more γ-H2AX foci, 2hrs after proton irradiation in both cell lines (compared to photon radiation). There were also significantly more 53BP1 foci in the photon-resistant cells compared to wild-type after proton irradiation which indicate potential differences in DNA damage response between radiation modalities. These findings seem to indicate that, in this model of photon-resistant medulloblastoma, treatment resistance may be overcome with proton irradiation.\n\nO 019 - Ultra-High Dose Rate Carbon Ion Irradiation: First in vivo Experiment\n\nWalter Tinganelli1, Uli Weber1, Anggraeini Puspitasari1, Palma Simoniello2, Christoph Schuy1, Amir Abdollahi3,4, Claudia Fournier1, Helm Alexander1, Marco Durante1,5\n\n1GSI Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung, Biopyhsics, Darmstadt, Germany\n\n2University of Naples 'Parthenope', Dipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie, Naples, Italy\n\n3Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Center HIT, Heidelberg-, Germany\n\n4German Cancer Research Center DKFZ, Medical Physics, Heidelberg, Germany\n\n5Technische Universität Darmstadt, Institut für Festkörperphysik, Heidelberg, Germany\n\nRadiotherapy indisputably plays a crucial role in cancer treatment since more than 50% of patients receive it throughout their treatment. However, the efficacy of radiation treatment has a limitation due to the toxicity in the normal healthy tissue. Short pulses of electrons or protons at ultra-high dose rates (FLASH) were shown to be less harmful to healthy tissue but just as efficient as conventional dose rate radiation for tumor growth inhibition. Radiotherapy under FLASH conditions may become a new strategy to treat cancer as it bears the potential to widen the therapeutic window of radiotherapy substantially. Our group published the first results on an in vitro FLASH experiment with carbon ions, demonstrating that FLASH irradiation with ions heavier than protons is feasible. The effects were shown to depend on the oxygenation level. However, in vitro experiments are certainly limited in their significance compared to complex in vivo experiments. Therefore, we recently performed the first in vivo experiment using ultra-high dose rate (> 40 Gy/s) carbon ions to expose a C3H/He osteosarcoma mouse model, which spontaneously develops lung metastases. Compared to conventional exposure to carbon ions, the ultra-high dose rate of carbon ion spared the healthy tissues, while providing a comparable tumor control (figure below). Furthermore, the results point to a reduced number of lung metastases in mice whose tumors were exposed under FLASH conditions compared to those treated with a conventional dose rate.\n\nO 020 - Effects of proton FLASH therapy in the immune response against rat glioblastoma\n\nLorea Iturri1, Annaïg Bertho1, Charlotte Lamirault2, Marjorie Juchaux1, Cristèle Gilbert1, Frédéric Pouzoulet2, Pierre Verrelle3, Ludovic de Marzi4, Yolanda Prezado1\n\n1Institut Curie, UMR 3347/U1021 – Signaling- Radiobiology and Cancer, Orsay, France\n\n2Institut Curie, Translational Research Department- Experimental Radiotherapy Platform, Orsay, France\n\n3Institut Curie, Centre de Protonthérapie d'Orsay- UMR9187 / U1196 - CMIB, Orsay, France\n\n4Institut Curie, Centre de Protonthérapie d'Orsay- INSERM U1288 - LITO, Orsay, France\n\nFLASH radiation therapy [1] is increasingly gaining interest as it has the potential to reduce the toxicity associated to radiotherapy (RT), especially in the case of cancer treatments where the radiation is one of the key therapeutic elements. The mechanisms by which FLASH RT can control tumor growth are still under study, and several theories have been proposed, including a more efficient immune attraction to the tumor. To bridge this gap in knowledge, we evaluated the impact of proton FLASH therapy compared to conventional proton therapy given in one fraction in a rat glioblastoma model, with special attention to the immune response generated after the treatments and the neurological toxicities produced. FLASH effect was first demonstrated by means of behavioral tests: rats receiving FLASH therapy exhibited a significantly higher discrimination ratio than the ones receiving conventional irradiations. Using high-parameter flow cytometry, we characterized the immune cell heterogeneity of the tumor after the radiation, evaluating the density of different subsets of lymphocytes and myeloid cells in the tissue. We observed that both conventional proton therapy and proton FLASH RT are able to effectively mobilize a vast amount of lymphocytes to the tissue, altering the immune suppressive equilibrium that is a hallmark of glioblastoma. Studying the immune responses upon novel and less toxic types of radiotherapy will give more understanding of the radiobiological effects of these techniques. Importantly, it will give vital information that could be later used in future studies combining radio-immunotherapies.\n\nO 021 - Effect of FLASH versus Non-FLASH proton radiation on mice with head and neck cancer\n\nLi Wang1, Ming Yang2, Qinglei Hang1, Xiaochun Wang2, Uwe Titt2, Yinhan Zhang1, Jennifer Heldring1, Narayan Sahoo2, Xiaorong Ronald Zhu2, Steven J. Frank3\n\n1The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Experimental Radiation Oncology, Houston, USA\n\n2The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Radiation Physics, Houston, USA\n\n3The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Radiation Oncology, Houston, USA\n\nPurpose: FLASH-Radiotherapy (F-RT) has been identified as a promising modality to deliver curative dose to tumor instantaneously in milliseconds while mitigating normal tissue damage. We have shown that compared to conventional-proton radiotherapy (C-PRT), F-PRT caused reduced cell viability in human head and neck cancer (HNSCC) cells, and higher level of cell viability in the human normal tongue cells. However, effect of F-PRT versus C-PRT on mice bearing HNSCC are absent, these were investigated herein.\n\nMethods: When SCC-VII (HNSCC) tumors (in the middle of tongue in C57/6J mice, 6/group) reached 18.1 mm (17.3−18.9 mm3) in average volume, a single dose of 20-Gy F-PRT (250-Gy/s) or C-PRT (0.592-Gy/s) were given to the oral cavity and surrounding normal structures of mice. The overall survival times (OSs, days from treatment initiation to mice death, were compared by a Kaplan-Meier analysis), body weight, and tumor growth of mice were compared.\n\nResults: The mean OSs of mice with F-PRT versus C-PRT were 11.0±0.0 and 9.3±0.19 days, median OSs were 11.0 and 9.0 days; F-PRT (versus C-PRT) significantly prolonged OS (P=0.019) (Figure). No difference was observed in body weight and tumor growth changes between treatments. No mice death in control group during the observation period.\n\nConclusion: Mice with HNSCC tumors survived longer after F-PRT (20-Gy) versus C-PRT. No difference of tumor growth or body weight changes between F-PRT and C-PRT were observed. Studies in more tumor types and more radiation doses are warranted to validate this finding and to further provide rationales for clinical application.\n\nO 022 - Including volume effects in biological treatment plan optimization for carbon ion therapy: gEUD-driven optimization with TRiP98\n\nMarco Battestini1,2, Marco Schwarz3,4, Michael Krämer5, Emanuele Scifoni2\n\n1University of Trento, Department of Physics, Trento, Italy\n\n2National Institute for Nuclear Physics, Trento Institute for Fundamental Physics and Applications, Trento, Italy\n\n3Azienda Provinciale per i Servizi Sanitari, Trento Proton Therapy Center, Trento, Italy\n\n4University of Washington, Radiation Oncology Department, Seattle, USA\n\n5GSI Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ions Research, Biophysics Department, Darmstadt, Germany\n\nTRiP98, a research software for particles treatment planning, pioneered the implementation of RBE-weighted dose optimization. However, it allowed only for voxel-based dose objectives, i.e. prescribed dose to the target and maximum dose to healthy tissues. We present a method to account for volume effects in plan optimization, using the Generalized Equivalent Uniform Dose (gEUD), which allows to convert a heterogeneous dose distribution into a uniform dose associated with the same biological effect and closely correlates to NTCP. We implemented the gEUD-based optimization in TRiP98 for carbon ion therapy, allowing to control the whole DVH shape of OAR with a single objective, reducing the volume receiving dose levels close to the mean or the maximum dose, depending on the organ type specific volume effect parameter a and a prescribed gEUD0. We studied the role of such parameters in multi-field optimization. We compared voxel-based and gEUD-based optimization in chordoma cases with different anatomies. For all plans containing multiple OARs, we obtained the same target coverage and similar DVHs for OARs with a small volume effect, while decreasing the mean dose received by the parotids, thus reducing their NTCP, as in the example shown in Figures 1–2, where NTCP decreased from 11.09% to 4.37%. This novel optimization method (Battestini et al. Front. Oncol. accepted) can be applied to different OARs, achieving the largest improvement if volume effect is large. This allows TRiP98 to perform a double level of biologically-driven optimization for ion beams, including both RBE-weighted dose and volume effects.\n\nO 023 - Radiobiological models in Carbon Ion Radiotherapy (CIRT): How do physical and treatment planning parameters influence the relation between clinical RBE-models?\n\nJoanna Gora1, Sarah Grosshagauer2, Mansure Schafasand1,3, Antonio Carlino1, Markus Stock1, Piero Fossati1\n\n1MedAustron Ion Therapy Centre- Austria, Medical Department, Wiener Neustadt, Austria\n\n2Technical University of Vienna- Austria, Atomic Institute, Vienna, Austria\n\n3Medical University of Vienna- Austria, Radiotherapy Department, Vienna, Austria\n\nThere are two main clinically used radiobiological models, calculating RBE-weighted dose for CIRT (MKM and LEM). Although both estimate RBE-distributions within tissue, translation between them is not straightforward. Several dose prescription and OARs constraints translations are already clinically applied. However, they carry limitations, which may potentially influence the treatment outcome. The study aims at visualizing the theoretical and practical aspects, which affect the relation between the models. It was divided into 2 sections: model dependencies (LET and dose/fx dependencies) and TP considerations (beam arrangement, dose gradients, spot placing: blocking vs constraints, range shifter contribution). Evaluations were performed in the virtual phantom and patient CT, optimizing the LEM RBE-weighted dose first, followed by MKM recomputation, averaged LET distributions were examined in addition (RayStationV9). Results illustrate how mentioned parameters influence LEM/MKM relationship, therefore any translations between them require great caution. Figure1 exemplifies one of the findings. For plateau and tail region (dose/fx independently), MKM-doses are as expected lower comparing to LEM(16-40%). SOBP region highly depends on dose/fx(-29%to+40%). However, distal target/OAR overlapping region calculation is driven by created dose gradients. MKM-dose for high-gradients is lower comparing to LEM-doses(by 17%-34%), while for low-gradients the behavior is reversed, resulting with higher MKM-doses(up to 33%). Understanding the relation between the models, allows combining European and Japanese-based experience and therefore more confident decisions during the TP process. Not every center has capability of simultaneous LEM and MKM calculations. This study guides and highlights the importance of choosing optimal planning strategies, especially when OAR constraint dose escalation is considered.\n\nO 024 - Exploring LET and RBE effects from pruning techniques in proton arc therapy\n\nHelge Henjum1, Johannes Tjelta1,2, Lars Fredrik Fjæra1, Sara Pilskog1,2, Camilla H. Stokkevåg1,2, Kristian S. Ytre-Hauge1\n\n1University of Bergen, Department of Physics and Technology, Bergen, Norway\n\n2Haukeland University Hospital, Department of Oncology and Medical Physics, Bergen, Norway\n\nPurpose/objective: Proton arc therapy (PAT) is an emerging treatment modality that holds promise to improve target coverage and reduce linear energy transfer (LET) in organs at risk. We aimed to investigate if pruning the highest energy layers in each beam direction could further reduce high LET values surrounding the target, and thus also the relative biological effectiveness (RBE)-weighted dose.\n\nMethod and Materials: A 240° PAT plan for a germinoma patient was created with multifield optimization in the Eclipse TPS with a prescribed dose of 54 Gy(RBE1.1). The PAT plan was iteratively pruned for energy layers in each direction, creating 6 PAT plans with different amounts of pruning (P-PAT) while maintaining tumor coverage. All plans were recalculated in the FLUKA Monte Carlo software, and the LET, physical dose, and variable RBE-weighted dose from the Rørvik model (ROR) and an LET weighted dose model (LWD) were evaluated.\n\nResults: Almost all P-PAT plans reduced the mean RBE-weighted dose to the surrounding healthy tissue compared to the PAT plan (Figure 1), whereas the 6-layers P-PAT plan showed an increase. These findings were consistent across RBE models. The LET was increasingly higher within the PTV for each pruning iteration, where the mean LET from the 6-layer P-PAT plan was 1.5 higher than for the PAT plan. Likewise, the LET values to the healthy tissue were reduced for each pruning iteration (Figure 2).\n\nConclusion: We demonstrated a pruning method for PAT to increase LET and RBE in the target and reduce it in surrounding tissue while maintaining sufficient target coverage.\n\nO 025 - Reducing high LET component of dose to the brainstem in proton treatment planning for brain tumors by optimization\n\nAnne Vestergaard1, Morten Høyer1, Jesper Kallehauge1, Ole Nørrevang1, Bob Smulders1,2, Yasmin Lassen-Ramshad1, Aida Muhic1,2, Rikke Dahlrot1,3, Erik Traneus4, Korreman Stine1\n\n1Aarhus University Hospital, Danish Centre for Particle Therapy, Aarhus N, Denmark\n\n2University Hospital of Copenhagen / Rigshospitalet, Department of Oncology, Copenhagen, Denmark\n\n3Odense University Hospital, Department of Oncology, Odense, Denmark\n\n4RaySearch Laboratories, Ab, Stockholm, Sweden\n\nClinical evidence of increased RBE at the distal edge of proton beams is emerging. This study explores the use of optimization to reduce the high LET dose contribution to the brainstem, by re-optimizing plans following clinical guidelines as well as more brain sparing field arrangements. Five grade 1 meningioma patients were treated (prescribed dose 54 GyRBE) according to treatment planning guidelines, that do not allow more than one of minimum 3 beams with distal edge in the brainstem. Treatment plans were optimized in a research version of Raystation (10B-IonPG, Raysearch Laboratories) using same beam angles as clinically treated plans (Clin). A plan was created to spare normal brain (DE). Both plans were re-optimized with a penalty on the dose component in the brainstem with LET>3 keV/μm. The high LET dose component (DhighLET) and the variable RBE (McNamara model, brainstem α/β=2) were calculated. For all plans with the high LET dose objective, brainstem D2cc decreased compared to the Clin and DE plans. DhighLET in the brainstem was low for Clin plans. The DE plans reduced mean dose to the normal brain by 22% and had a higher DhighLET compared to Clin plans. When DE plans were optimized with the high LET dose objective, DhighLET decreased to the same level as the Clin plan. For the clinical beam configurations, the high-LET dose component was generally low. Using the DE beam configurations decreased the mean dose to the normal brain and by optimizing with penalty on the high LET dose component the brainstem D2cc decreased.\n\nO 026 - Integrating the maximization of peak-to-valley dose ratio and normal-tissue survival fraction into treatment planning for proton minibeam radiation therapy\n\nWeijie Zhang1, Wangyao Li1, Yuting Lin1, Fen Wang1, Ronald C Chen1, Hao Gao1\n\n1University of Kansas Medical Center, Radiation Oncology, Kansas City, USA\n\nPurpose: Proton minibeam radiation therapy (pMBRT) is a novel proton modality of spatially fractionated RT (SFRT). pMBRT can reduce the radiation damage to normal tissues via biological dose sparing of high peak-to-valley dose ratio (PVDR). This work will integrate the maximization of PVDR into pMBRT treatment planning. This new optimization method can be combined with the hardware approach (e.g., using collimators) for maximizing PVDR.\n\nMethods: The new optimization method simultaneously maximizes the normal-tissue PVDR and optimizes the dose distribution at tumor targets and organs-at-risk (OAR). The PVDR maximization is through the joint total variation (TV) and L1 regularization with respect to the normal-tissue dose. That is, at beam-eye-view projected dose slices of several depths for each beam angle, the TV of dose is maximized, corresponding to the PVDR maximization, while the L1 of dose is minimized, corresponding to the minimization of the OAR dose and maximization of survival fraction (SF).\n\nResults: The new IMPT method with TV and L1 regularization (TVL1) was validated in comparison with the conventional IMPT method (CONV) for pMBRT on several clinical cases. The results show that TVL1 provided larger PVDR and SF than CONV for biological sparing of normal tissues, with preserved plan quality in terms of physical dose distribution.\n\nO 027 - Integrating the production of radicals from water radiolysis into the framework of microdosimetry\n\nAlejandro Bertolet1,2, Harald Paganetti1,2, Jan Schuemann1,2\n\n1Massachusetts General Hospital, Radiation Oncology, Boston, USA\n\n2Harvard Medical School, Radiation Oncology, Boston, USA\n\nMicrodosimetry captures the local energy deposition patterns from different ionizing radiation qualities. The local distribution of energy depositions impact the complexity of damages induced to radiobiologically relevant targets such as the DNA. In a previous work [1], we showed that the energy imparted into a microscopic site correlates with the number of strand breaks (SBs) induced by direct effect, i.e., the SBs originated by direct ionization from radiation in the very early stage of radiation action (up to 1 fs). However, part of the damage induced to DNA is mediated by radicals resulting from radiolysis of molecules of water in the cellular cytosol. Microdosimetry only accounts for physical quantities such as energy imparted, so that it cannot predict the magnitude of the indirect effect, i.e., the SBs produced by these radicals at a later stage. In this work, we used the Monte Carlo multi-scale tool TOPAS-nBio to study the yield of ·OH radicals at 1 μs induced by protons with different energies in a 1 μm-diameter site of liquid water [2]. The yield of ·OH radicals was related to the dose-average linear energy () as shown in the figure below including a saturation term to account for higher radical recombination at higher local energy depositions. Our work is a first step towards linking common microdosimetric quantities to fundamental radiation damage by including time dependent effects of radiochemistry.\n\nO 028 - A Multiscale Generalized Stochastic Microdosimetric Model ({\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSM2\",\"term_id\":\"2\"}}GSM2) to describe dynamical oxygenation and fast reaction kinetics for unraveling the FLASH effect\n\nFrancesco Giuseppe Cordoni1, Marta Missiaggia2, Giorgio Cartechini2, Martina Fuss3, Gianmarco Camazzola3, Daria Boscolo3, Marco Battestini2, Andrea Attili4, Francesco Tommasino2, Michael Krämer3, Chiara La Tessa2, Emanuele Scifoni5\n\n1University of Trento, Department of Civil- Environmental and Mechanical Engineering, Trento, Italy\n\n2University of Trento, Dep. of Physics, Trento, Italy\n\n3GSI Helmholzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung, Biophysics division, Darmstadt, Germany\n\n4INFN-Roma 3, Dep. of Physics, Roma, Italy\n\n5TIFPA-INFN, Dep. of Physics, Trento, Italy\n\nFLASH radiotherapy has emerged in recent years as a promising new avenue for therapeutic use of radiation. It has been collected experimental evidence that ultra high dose rate (FLASH) irradiations are able to spare normal tissue being equally efficient for tumour control. Besides this evidence, the mechanism at the basis of FLASH effect remains largely unexplained to date. The Generalized Stochastic Microdosimetric Model ({\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSM2\",\"term_id\":\"2\"}}GSM2), [1,2], is a probabilistic model that describes the time-evolution of the DNA damages in a cell nucleus from microdosimetric principles. Among the most relevant strengths there is the capability of efficiently treating the several levels of spatio-temporal stochasticity happening during a protracted irradiation. We derive a multiscale {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSM2\",\"term_id\":\"2\"}}GSM2 coupling the DNA damage evolution with fast reaction kinetics accounting for radical formations, oxygen consumption and re-oxygenation happening during a given dose delivery time structure. The resulting multiscale {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSM2\",\"term_id\":\"2\"}}GSM2 describes the coupled evolution of the multiscale system composed by DNA damage and fast Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). Via simulations of proton energy deposition in a microscopic volume using TRAXCHEM, we study the combined effects of ROS and the time evolution of DNA damages, assessing the resulting cell-survival curve at different beam structures and oxygenation conditions. We show how the multiscale {\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSM2\",\"term_id\":\"2\"}}GSM2 is able to justify the empirical patterns of Double Strand Breaks (DSB) yields and normal tissue sparing observed in FLASH radiotherapy, [3], see Figure 1.\n\nO 029 - A Monte Carlo study of the free radical production in minibeam radiation therapy\n\nThongchai Masilela1,2, Yolanda Prezado1,2\n\n1Institut Curie - Université PSL - CNRS UMR3347 - Inserm U1021, Signalisation radiobiologie et cancer, 91400 - Orsay, France\n\n2Université Paris-Saclay - CNRS UMR3347 - Inserm U1021, Signalisation radiobiologie et cancer, 91400 - Orsay, France\n\nMinibeam radiation therapy is a novel treatment technique characterised by the use of narrow beamlets to create distributions of high (peak) and low (valley) doses. By calculating the primary yield of reactive oxygen species (ROS), our goal was to assess whether the ROS composition differed between these regions, thereby bridging the gap of knowledge between the physical and biological implications of this technique. Simulations were performed using TOPAS-nBio. A water phantom was irradiated with protons and x-rays in broad beam (BB) and minibeam (MB) configurations. The primary yield at 1000 ps of the hydroxyl radical (an indicator of indirect DNA damage) was calculated in spherical cellular targets. While we observed no inherent difference between the types of ROS produced in the peaks and valleys, the absolute amount depended on the radiation's spatial distribution. At all depths, the hydroxyl yield for x-rays was approximately 1.6 times larger in the MB peak and 18 times smaller in the valley compared to the BB configuration. For protons these ratios in the entrance region were 5.6 and 60 respectively, but approached unity towards the Bragg peak. In a target located at the Bragg peak, the peak-to-valley ROS ratios suggest a differential indirect DNA damage effect for x-rays, whereas for protons this damage is more homogenous. At this instant in time, the distribution of free radicals appears to be analogous to the macroscopic dose. Further simulations are being performed to calculate direct and indirect strand breaks, and investigate the effect of diffusion at larger time scales.\n\nO 030 - Accumulation of sublethal radiation damage and its impact on cell survival\n\nOleg Vassiliev1, Christine Peterson2, David Grosshans3, Radhe Mohan1\n\n1The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Radiation Physics, Houston, USA\n\n2The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Biostatistics, Houston, USA\n\n3The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Radiation Oncology, Houston, USA\n\nObjective: Determine the extent of sublethal radiation damage (SRD) in cells surviving a given dose of radiation and how it affects cell survival curves.\n\nMaterial and methods: We have developed a cell survival model that accounts for accumulation of SRD. The model uses a microdosimetry based formalism to calculate characteristics of energy deposition events on a microscopic scale. Each event may cause lethal or sublethal damage. Probabilities of the two outcomes depend on the statistics of all preceding events. We have validated the model and evaluated its parameters using data from 341 measured cell survival curves for photons, protons and heavy ions.\n\nResults: Accumulation of SRD begins at doses below 1 Gy and includes increasing the number of damaged cells and damage buildup in individual cells. At 10 Gy few cells remain undamaged, whereas the subpopulation of most damaged cells becomes the largest. Accumulation of SRD in a cell reduces its repair ability - the most damaged cells are most radiosensitive. This results in the slope of a survival curve becoming constant at high doses - a property supported by experimental data. Energy deposition events occur in cells at random. This makes cell population highly heterogeneous in terms of radiosensitivity.\n\nConclusions: Accumulation of SRD is an important factor in cell response to radiation. Starting at doses below 1 Gy this process makes a population of surviving cells highly heterogeneous in terms of radiosensitivity. This warrants development of novel cell survival and tumor control models that account for this heterogeneity.\n\nO 031 - Patient variation effect on tumor control probability of lung PBS treatment\n\nWeijun Xiong1, Minglei Kang1, Haibo Lin1, Chengyu Shi1, J. Isabelle Choi2, Charles B Simone II2\n\n1New York Proton Center, Medical Physics, New York, USA\n\n2New York Proton Center, Radiation Oncology, New York, USA\n\nBackground: This study is to examine the effect of patient variation of α and β on tumor control probability (TCP) for hypofractionated and conventionally-fractionated lung PBS treatment. The goal of this study is to develop a patient-specific TCP model for future lung PBS treatment.\n\nMethod and Materials: The lung cancer TCP based on the linear-quadratic (LQ) model was calculated using parameters α and β. The LQ parameters were derived from clinical data for lung cancer, and variations in α and β were added through parameters σα, σβ which are the standard deviation of Gaussian distribution around α0 and β0, respectively.\n\nResults and Conclusion: The patient variation σα is always necessary to be considered for the treatment. It requires an extra dose for hypofractionated treatment and a low α/β ratio to achieve a greater-than-50%TCP when σα is increasing. For low α/β ratio, the β term also plays important role in cell-killing, and the patient variation σβ is also necessary to be considered for hypofractionated treatment. Even for high α/β ratio, when moving from conventionally-fractioned to hypofractionated treatment, the variation σβ also has a moderate effect on treatment. From the analysis of the extra dose to 95% TCP with variation σβ, TCP for hypofractionated treatment is more prone to patient variation σβ.\n\nO 032 - Dosimetric comparison of breath-hold and free-breathing techniques in left-sided breast cancer patients treated with proton pencil beam scanning\n\nEmile Gogineni1, Zachary Fellows2, William Hrinivich1, Heng Li1, Victoria Croog1, Jean Wright1, Khadija Sheikh1\n\n1Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Radiation Oncology and Molecular Radiation Sciences, Baltimore, USA\n\n2Miami Cancer Institute, Radiation Oncology, Miami, USA\n\nPurpose: To evaluate dosimetric differences in lung and heart doses in left-sided breast cancer patients treated with intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) using Active Breathing Control (ABC) and free-breathing (FB).\n\nMethods: Eight left-sided breast cancer patients undergoing IMPT were planned on both FB and ABC CT simulation scans and were robustly optimized with range and setup uncertainty of 3.5% and 5 mm. A representative comparison plan is provided in Figure 1. The prescription for all patients was 50 Gy radiobiological equivalent (GyE) in 25 fractions. Dosimetric parameters, lung density, and time on table for beam were compared using paired t-tests.\n\nResults: A dosimetric comparison is provided in Table 1. Volume of ipsilateral and contralateral lungs receiving 5 GyE and volume of ipsilateral lung receiving 20 GyE were all significantly higher with ABC than with FB. Maximum heart dose was lower with ABC than FB, but there were no statistically significant differences in any other heart or left anterior descending artery volumetric endpoint between ABC and FB. Lung density was significantly lower with ABC than FB. Time on table for beam was significantly longer with ABC than with FB.\n\nConclusions: ABC plans provided slightly higher lung dose and mostly similar cardiac dose in comparison with FB plans. Given the large increase in the time required for ABC treatment without obvious dosimetric or clinical benefit, FB techniques may be preferred when treating breast cancer with IMPT in order to maximize clinic workflow and minimize patient inconvenience, particularly in patients without cardiac risk factors.\n\nO 033 - Advanced Pencil Beam Scanning Bragg-peak FLASH-RT can enhance lung cancer planning treatment outcomes compared to conventional PBS techniques\n\nShouyi Wei1, Haibo Lin1, J. Isabelle Choi2, Charles B. Simone II2, Minglei Kang1\n\n1New York Proton Center, Medical Physics, New York, USA\n\n2New York Proton Center, Radiation Oncology, New York, USA\n\nPurpose: To compare dosimetric characteristics between an advanced proton pencil beam scanning (PBS) Bragg-peak FLASH technique and conventional PBS planning technique in lung tumors.\n\nMethod: Single-energy PBS Bragg-peak FLASH treatment plans(a cohort of 10 patients) were optimized based on a novel distal tracking technique to enable Bragg-peaks to stop at the distal edge of the target. Inverse treatment planning using multiple-field optimization(MFO) can achieve sufficient FLASH dose rate and intensity-modulated proton therapy(IMPT)-equivalent dosimetric quality. The dose rate of organs-at-risk(OARs) and the target were calculated under realistic FLASH machine parameters. FLASH dose rate coverage(V40Gy/s) was also evaluated as a metric of the FLASH sparing effect. The standard care of PBS treatment technique using multiple energy layers was rescaled to 34Gy/fraction as reference. The dosimetric quality was compared between Bragg-peak FLASH and conventional plans based on RTOG0915 dose metrics.\n\nResults: The Bragg-peak plans achieve >70% of V40Gy/s FLASH coverage for all major OARs. The lower dose rate region was associated with a low dose, occurring at the PBS field penumbra region. The PBS treatment plans yield slightly superior target dose uniformity with a D2%(%) of 108.02% versus Bragg-peak at 115.95%(p=0.001). No significant difference was seen between dose metrics for Bragg-peak and IMPT treatment plans for the spinal cord, esophagus, heart, or lung-GTV(all p=0.1).\n\nConclusion: Bragg-peak plans can achieve comparable plan quality to conventional PBS while achieving sufficient FLASH dose rate coverage for major OARs. The novel Bragg-peak FLASH technique has the potential to enhance lung cancer planning treatment outcomes compared to standard PBS treatment techniques.\n\nO 034 - Long-term results of pencil-beam scanning proton therapy in the Mayo 3-fraction partial breast irradiation nonrandomized phase 2 trial\n\nRobert Mutter1, Michael Golafshar2, Todd DeWees2, Kimberly Corbin1, Nicholas Remmes1, Lisa McGee3, Carlos Vargas1, Dean Shumway1, Tina Hieken4, Sean Park1\n\n1Mayo Clinic, Department of Radiation Oncology, Rochester, USA\n\n2Mayo Clinic, Department of Biomedical Informatics, Scottsdale, USA\n\n3Mayo Clinic, Department of Radiation Oncology, Scottsdale, USA\n\n4Mayo Clinic, Department of Surgery, Rochester, USA\n\nPurpose: We conducted a trial of 3-fraction photon, proton, or brachytherapy PBI, with technique selected at physician and patient discretion. Herein, we report long-term outcomes of the novel proton regimen.\n\nMaterials/Methods: Eligible women were age ≥ 50 years and s/p lumpectomy with negative sentinel nodes for estrogen receptor positive (ER+) invasive breast cancer (BC) without preoperative chemotherapy or any DCIS measuring ≤ 2.5 cm. CTV was post-operative bed plus 1 cm with ± 3 mm/3% robustness checks and prescribed 21.9 Gy (RBE) in 3 fractions administered consecutive business days. The regimen was designed to have comparable biologically effective dose as 40 Gy in 15 fractions, assuming an α/β ratio of 3.5.\n\nResults: Between 2015-2017 49 proton patients were treated with proton PBI. Median patient age was 67 years. 82% had invasive BC and 18% had DCIS. The median of the mean heart/ipsilateral lung and breast V50% doses were <0.001/0.1 Gy and 27%.The proportion of patients with adverse cosmesis (by RN assessment) was 16% pre-PBI and 4% at last follow-up (median 4.2 years) with no patients experiencing cosmetic worsening and 96% having good/excellent cosmesis. Two patients developed local recurrence (1 marginal, 1 in-field). 4-year local recurrence-free, progression-free, and overall survival were 97.9%, 93.7%, and 93.7%, respectively. There were no treatment related grade ≥2 adverse events and no evidence of deterioration in patient-reported pain, fatigue, breast related or overall quality of life.\n\nConclusions: 3-fraction proton PBI exquisitely spared normal tissues, was associated with favorable cosmetic outcomes, disease control, and excellent tolerability.\n\nO 035 - Dose rate and dose robustness for proton transmission FLASH-RT in lung cancer treatment\n\nShouyi Wei1, Haibo Lin1, Chengyu Shi1, Weijun Xiong1, Chin-Cheng Chen1, Sheng Huang1, Robert H. Press2, Shaakir Hasan2, Arpit M. Chhabra2, J. Isabelle Choi2, Charles B. Simone2, Minglei Kang1\n\n1New York Proton Center, Medical Physics, New York, USA\n\n2New York Proton Center, Radiation Oncology, New York, USA\n\nPurpose: To evaluate the plan quality and robustness of both dose and dose rate of proton pencil beam scanning (PBS) transmission FLASH delivery in lung cancer treatment.\n\nMethods: An in-house FLASH TPS was used to optimize 10 lung cancer patients previously treated with proton SBRT to receive 3 and 5 transmission beams (Trx-5fds and Trx-3fds) to 34 Gy in a single-fraction. Perturbation scenarios (n=12) for setup and range uncertainties (5mm and 3.5%) were introduced and dose-volume histogram and dose-rate-volume histogram bands were generated. Conventional proton SBRT plans were used as reference. RTOG0915 dose metrics and 40Gy/s dose rate coverage (V40Gy/s) were used to assess the dose and dose rate robustness.\n\nResults: Trx-5fds yields a comparable ICTV D2% of 35.9 Gy, whereas Trx-3fds results in inferior D2% of 38.5 Gy to the clinical SBRT plans with D2% of 35.8 Gy (p<0.05). Both Trx-5fds and Trx-3fds plans had slightly worse OAR dose metrics than SBRT plans. Trx-5fds achieved superior dosimetry robustness for ICTV, esophagus, and spinal cord dose than both Trx-3fds and conventional SBRT plans. There was no statistical difference in dose rate robustness for V40Gy/s coverage between Trx-3fds and Trx-5fds.\n\nConclusion: Transmission plans yield overall inferior plan quality compared to the conventional proton SBRT plans but provide improved robustness. With the use of more beams, both dose and dose rate robustness for the transmission plans can be achieved.\n\nO 036 - Accuracy of residual interfraction patient positioning in Ocular Proton Therapy (OPT)\n\nMartijn Hol1, Myra Rodrigues2, Yvonne Klaver2, Kees Spruijt2, Jasper Kouwenberg2, Eleftheria Astreinidou1, Coen Rasch1\n\n1Leiden University Medical Center, Radiotherapy, Leiden, Netherlands\n\n2Holland PTC, Radiotherapy, Delft, Netherlands\n\nIntroduction: In ocular proton therapy patients are positioned upright on a robotic chair, the head is fixated with a bite frame and mask. Patients are requested to gaze towards a LED-light to fixate the affected eye. To facilitate pre-treatment verification, tantalum fiducials are attached to the eye circumventing the target volume. Before each fraction two orthogonal x-ray images are manually registered to a reference DRR, based on the fiducial position only.\n\nObjective: We investigated the interfraction positioning accuracy of the current practice at HollandPTC.\n\nMethods: A cohort of 60 patients was selected, each patient received 60GyRBE in 4 fractions. From each patient the reference DRR (generated by EOPP treatment planning system) and last pre-treatment orthogonal kV images were used to perform an automated offline rigid body registration determining the interfraction positioning accuracy. In total 240 fractions were analyzed, the means and standard deviations are calculated.\n\nResults: The interfraction statistics of the patient population are reported. The deviations in the longitudinal direction are larger than other directions. This can be explained by use of the strap and robustness in the longitudinal direction in the treatment plan, which allows some freedom in patient positioning. Based on the statistics, we calculated the margins according to the simplified Herk margin recipe. The calculated margins are 0.7, 1.5 and 0.8 mm for the lateral, longitudinal and vertical direction.\n\nConclusions: A day-to-day patient positioning accuracy is determined for the current practice of ocular proton patients at HollandPTC. The determined margins are within the current clinical safety margin of 2.5 mm.\n\nO 037 - Comparison of two PBS proton CSI Treatment Techniques: single posterior-anterior beam versus two posterior oblique beams for the brain target\n\nLei Hu1, Anna Zhai1, Qing Chen1, Chin-Cheng Chen1, Francis Yu1, Jana L. Fox2, Suzanne L. Wolden3, Jonathan Yang3, Charles B. Simone II4, Haibo Lin1\n\n1New York Proton Center, Department of Physics, New York, USA\n\n2Montefiore Medical Center, Radiation Oncology, New York, USA\n\n3Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Radiation Oncology, New York, USA\n\n4New York Proton Center, Radiation Oncology, New York, USA\n\nBackground: To compare two approaches for pencil beam scanning (PBS) CSI, Bi-lateral Posterior Oblique Beams (BPO) versus Single Posterior-Anterior Beam (SPA), for the brain target in terms of dosimetric differences and treatment efficiency.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Five patients were simulated in the head-first supine position on a long BOS frame and scanned using 3 mm CT slice thickness. A customized thermoplastic mask immobilized the patient's head and neck and a vac-lock for legs. The plans were robustly optimized with 3mm setup and 3.5% range uncertainties, plus 5 mm uncertainty to ensure a smooth dose match line in the 5 cm segment junctions. The brain field(s) included either BPO beams sharing the same isocenter or a SPA beam. The spine segments were planned with a single PA field. Dosimetric differences between the BPO and SPA were compared, and the treatment efficiency was analyzed according to timestamps of beam delivery as well as simulations.\n\nResults: The Dmax were 111.4±2.1% vs 109.4±1.9% and the inhomogeneity (D5/D95) were 1.030±0.010 vs 1.027±0.003 in brain CTVs using SPA and BPO beam arrangements, respectively. Lens received less dose by 3.05±2.2 Gy(RBE) (left) and 2.52±1.9 Gy(RBE) (right) in the SPA plans. No significant cochlea dose change was observed. SPA may reduce the treatment time by more than 4 minutes in average and up to 10 minutes considering the beam line allocation.\n\nConclusion: SPA is dosimetrically comparable to BPO, with reduced lens doses at the cost of slightly higher dose inhomogeneity and hot spots. Implementation of SPA may improve treatment efficiency of PBS CSI.\n\nO 038 - Protontherapy/tomotherapy for curative dose escalation of sinonasal skull base adenoid cystic carcinoma: return on experience and literature overview\n\nAntoine Mavrikios1, Farid Goudjil1, Sofia Zefkili1, Valentin Calugaru1\n\n1Institut Curie, Department of Radiation Therapy, Paris, France\n\nAdenoid cystic carcinomas (ACC) represent 1% of head and neck malignancies. Sinonasal cases account for 10-25% of all cases with high propensity for skull base inflitration. Curative dose escalation for this poor prognosis subgroup of radioresistant tumors is challenging because of adjacent organs at risk. Highly conformational techniques like proton therapy and helical tomotherapy appear to be viable options because of their unique radiobiological and balistic properties but reports remain scarce. Eighteen patients treated by proton therapy and/or helical tomotherapy for sinonasal skull base ACC at Institut Curie, France, between March 2010 and August 2020 were retrospectively included. 61% of the patients did undergo surgery with positive margins prior to radiotherapy. Median delivered dose was 73.8 Gy. 33% of the patients received concomitant cisplatin chemotherapy. Evaluated outcomes were overall survival (OS), local control (LC), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), disease-free survival (DFS), acute and late toxicity profile.Median follow-up was at 49.6 months. 5-year OS, LC, DMFS, DFS rates were 46%, 54%, 46% and 39% respectively. 2 patients had a grade 3 acute toxicity. 1 patient had a grade 4 late optic nerve disorder. 45% of the patients had a grade 3 late toxicity of which 7 (39%) had a grade 3 late hearing impairment. Proton therapy and helical tomotherapy are effective and safe methods of dose escalation for curative treatment of sinonasal skull base ACC. Our results are coherent with available literature. Available data also suggests that carbon-ion therapy may be even more efficient because of better radiobiological properties.\n\nO 039 - Early clinical outcomes of spot-scanning proton beam therapy with simultaneous integrated boost technique for IDH-mutated glioma\n\nMaciej Pelak1, Carola Lütgendorf-Caucig1, Petra Georg1, Birgit Flechl1, Ulrike Mock1, Piero Fossati1, Marta Mumot1, Antonio Carlino1, Markus Stock1, Eugen Hug1\n\n1MedAustron, Ion Therapy Center, Wiener Neustadt, Austria\n\nIntroduction: Gliomas with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation have a favorable prognosis compared to IDH-wildtype tumors. This justifies the use of proton beam therapy (PBT) as it reduces unnecessary dose to unaffected brain and, consequently, late side effects. The use of simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) technique simplifies the planning process and contributes to a more conformal dose distribution. We analyzed the early outcomes of SIB PBT in patients with IDH-mutated glioma.\n\nMethods: The analysis included patients enrolled in the MedAustron prospective registry study, who were diagnosed with glioma with confirmed IDH1/2 mutation. Prescription for WHO grade II (15 patients) was 54.04 Gy RBE for PTV2 at 1.93 Gy/frct and 50.4 Gy RBE at 1.8 Gy/frct for PTV1 in 28 fractions. For WHO grade III tumors (11 patients) the dose was 60 Gy RBE for PTV2 at 2.0 Gy/frct and 54 Gy RBE for PTV1 at 1.8 Gy/frct in 30 fractions. Follow-up including MRI was obtained at 3, 6 and 12 months and then annually. Toxicity was assessed using CTCAE v4.0.\n\nResults: Between October 2017 and April 2021 26 adult patients were treated. Median follow-up was 29.1 months. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 96.2% and 88.5%, respectively. Actuarial 2-year OS was 100% and PFS was 95.8%. No acute or late toxicity > grade 2 was observed. Radiation-induced brain lesions were identified in 9 patients, 6/9 lesions resolved spontaneously without treatment.\n\nConclusion: Early clinical data demonstrate that SIB PBT is a safe and effective treatment of IDH-mutated glioma.\n\nO 040 - Novel unconventional immunomodulatory approach for partial tumor irradiation using protons and carbon ions exploiting the bystander and abscopal effects\n\nSlavisa Tubin1, Piero Fossati1, Razvan Galalae1, Rastko Konstantinovic1, Antonio Carlino1, Markus Stock1, Giovanna Martino1, Michaela Daniel1, Joanna Gora1, Eugen Hug1\n\n1EBG MedAustron GmbH, Medical Department, Wiener Neustadt, Austria\n\nRecently, a novel, unconventional radiotherapy approach, known as the “PARTICLE-PATHY” (PARTICLE-based PArtial Tumor irradiation of HYpoxic segment) has purposefully been developed for an intentional induction of immuno-stimulating radiation effects. This approach was applied for those patients affected by unresectable bulky oligometastatic tumors that were unsuitable for conventional particle therapy with the purpose to improve the radiotherapy therapeutic ratio, adding to direct radiation tumor cell killing also the component of immune-mediated killing in terms of bystander and abscopal effects. In order to generate those immune radiation effects, the loco-regional immune system cells are maximally spared from radiation as an OAR known as the peritumoral immune microenvironment-PIM (the applied dose-constraints: D30%=0Gy RBE, D50%<0.8Gy RBE, Dmean<4Gy RBE). PARTICLE-PATHY delivers extremely hypofractionated radiation doses, typically 45Gy RBE in three fractions to the hypoxic segment of those large tumors which on an average represent only 30% of the GTV. Currently, we are conducting a prospective trial to assess the immunogenic potential of carbon-ions applied to this novel treatment concept. The hypothesis implies that for an effective immune modulation leading to improved therapeutic ratio, the entire tumor volume may not need to be irradiated but only a partial tumor volume, to initiate the immune cycle in radiation-spared PIM, resulting in tumoricidal bystander and abscopal effect. The preliminary clinical results seen in the first eight consecutive patients are very encouraging confirming the high therapeutic potential in terms of tumor response devoid of any acute or late toxicity (Fig. 1 and 2).\n\nO 041 - Robustness of proton SBRT for prostate cancer in consideration of inter-fraction anatomy variations\n\nFrancis Yu1, Qing Chen1, Sheng Huang1, Brian Shen1, Daniel Gorovets2, Shaakir Hasan3, Charles Simone3, Haibo Lin1\n\n1New York Proton Center, Physics, New York, USA\n\n2MSKCC, Radiation Oncology, New York, USA\n\n3New York Proton Center, Radiation Oncology, New York, USA\n\nPurpose: To evaluate the treatment robustness of proton prostate SBRT using a pre-treatment CT and on-board CBCT imaging accessing of inter-fraction anatomy variations.\n\nMethods: Ten consecutive prostate cancer patients treated with SBRT to 50 fractions at the New York Proton Center were retrospectively studied. An ultrasound bladder scanner was used to ensure patients had full bladders prior to imaging. Before setting up patients on the table with on-board images, patients were re-scanned with repeat simulation CT for better image quality and more consistent anatomy within that day. Synthetic CT based on the CBCT were generated for OARs contouring with the reference to daily pre-treatment CT. The anatomy change of critical OARs including rectum, bladder and bowel, and overall plan quality were quantitatively investigated.\n\nResults: The average time interval between pre-treatment CT and CBCT was around 13.5 mins over all 50 treatments, of which the 25th percentile of bladder volume change and the 10th percentile of rectum volume change were ∼25% and 20%, respectively. Bladder scanner measured volume showed l0-30% difference compaed to contouring volume using pre-treatment CT and CBCT for 90% of measurements.\n\nConclusion: The rectum and bladder volume change can be extreme for some patients even within short period of time. The bladder scanner is a reliable tool in monitoring bladder volume and the plan quality consistency requires additional investigation.\n\nO 042 - Pencil-beam scanning proton beam therapy in gastrointestinal cancers: feasibility and early outcomes from India\n\nAshwathy Mathew1, Nagarjuna Burela1, Sapna Nangia1, Srinivas Chilukuri1, Kartikeswar Patro1, Dayananda Shamurailatpam1\n\n1Apollo Proton Cancer Centre, Radiation Oncology, Chennai, India\n\nAim: We report here our preliminary experience of treating gastrointestinal(GI) cancers with pencil-beam scanning (PBS) proton therapy.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Twenty-five consecutive patients with GI cancer, who were treated with PBS proton therapy at our facility from July 2019 to January 2022 were reviewed and patient, tumour and treatment details, toxicities and outcomes were collated.\n\nResults: Of 25 patients, 19 were male, with a median age of 63 years(Range:51-80) and median Charlson comorbidity index of 5(Range: 3-9). Liver was the most common primary site treated(32%), followed by esophagus(24%), pancreas(20%), rectum(16%) and one patient each with anal canal and recurrent sigmoid cancer. Sixteen patients(64%) received proton therapy as definitive treatment while nine(36%) received it as part of neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment. Twenty percent patients received concurrent chemotherapy alongwith proton therapy and 40% received targeted and/or chemotherapy prior. Median dose delivered was 54 GyE(Range: 41.4- 67.5) in a median of 28 fractions(Range: 5-33). Among abdominal tumors(n=13), seven were treated with deep-inspiration breath-hold, two with compression belt=2, while 4 were treated in free-breathing. The maximum grade of acute toxicity observed was Grade 3 (CTCAE V4.0) in 3 patients (dermatitis-2, hematological-1). With a median follow- up of 5.5 months(Range: 1-29 months), 19 patients are alive and 80% are locally controlled at last follow-up.\n\nConclusion: PBS proton therapy is feasible, with acceptable toxicities, without compromising local control in this cohort of GI cancer patients, many of whom were heavily pre-treated and/or received concurrent chemotherapy. Longer follow-up is needed to corroborate this encouraging early experience.\n\nO 043 - Oblique beam angles lead to better rectal protection but worse bladder sparing in prostate cancer receiving pencil-beam-scanning proton therapy (PBS)\n\nYunze Yang1, Jean-Claude Rwigema1, Carlos Vargas1, Nathan Yu1, Sameer Keole1, William Wong1, Steven Schild1, Martin Bues1, Wei Liu1, Jiajian Shen1\n\n1Mayo Clinic Arizona, Department of Radiation Oncology, Phoenix, USA\n\nPurpose: To investigate the dosimetric impact of beam angle changes in prostate cancer treated with pencil-beam-scanning proton therapy (PBS).\n\nMethods: Ten prostate patients were included in this study. Four plans for each patient were generated, one plan with left and right lateral parallel-opposed beams and three ones from posterior oblique angles of 5°, 10°, and 15° respectively. Dose-Linear-Energy-Transfer (LET)-volume histogram was employed to study the changes in dose and LET after beam angle changes. Volume metrics, V(d,l), defined as the cumulative normalized volume that has a dose of at least d(Gy[RBE]) and an LET of at least l(keV/μm), were calculated for both rectum and bladder. To evaluate the relative volume metrics changes, the relative volume change (RVC) was used. Three relative-biological-effective (RBE) models were employed to study the biological effect from dose and LET. Effect sizes for volume metrics of all RBE doses were evaluated.\n\nResults: Both high dose and LET volumes were significantly reduced in rectum using oblique angles (Fig.1). High RBE dose volume was effectively minimized at high dose in rectum with a maximum RVC of -69.7% (Fig. 2). LETs but not doses in bladders significantly increased, which caused a maximum RVC of 34.6% at high dose. Both magnitudes and effect sizes of the increase in bladder were less than those of the decrease in rectum.\n\nConclusions: Oblique angle plans achieved better dose and LET sparing of rectum while sacrificing LET sparing in bladder. Changing beam angles could be a good strategy to redistribute LET distributions.\n\nO 044 - Pencil beam scanning intensity modulated proton therapy (PBS IMPT) for squamous cell anal cancer: Is toxicity related to significant consequences?\n\nPavel Vitek1, Jiri Kubes1, Vladimir Vondracek1, Lubomir Zamecnik1, Radek Zapletal1\n\n1Proton Therapy Center Czech, Proton radiotherapy, Praha 8, Czech Republic\n\nA significant improvement in toxicity of definitive chemoradiotherapy was referred for PBS IMPT. The single institution study presented here had a primary objective to confirm high efficacy of PBS IMPT. The secondary objective was to assess what toxicity is limiting for PBS IMPT. The patients anal SCC received PBS-IMPT, 230 MeV. Treatment was administered in 2 volumes: Tumor plus involved nodes and regional node groups respectively. The dose 57,5 GyE and 45 GyE was administered to volume 1 and 2 in 25 fractions, simultaneous integrated boost, with concomitant chemotherapy cisplatinum (CDDP) plus capecitabine. Treatment effect was assessed upon DRE and MRI. Toxicity was scaled using CTCAE criteria. Forty-two patients were eligible, median follow up is 36 months, 39 patients are alive. The relapse free and colostomy free survival were 94% and 93 %. 39 patients (92,9%) achieve a complete regression. 2 patients underwent salvage resection, 1 due to severe chronic toxicity. Grade 3 and 4 myelotoxicity rate was 7,5% and 5,0%. Other grade 3-4 toxicity was dermatitis (23,3%), diarrhoea 7,5% and dehydration (7,57%). Chronic toxicity emerged as skin atrophy/ulceration – grade 3-4 (5,8%) and radiation proctitis grade 3 (2,9%). PBS IMPT achieves a high complete regression rate. The myelotoxicity grade 3-4 remains low. The acute toxicity completely resolved, had no lethal outcome and never resulted in colostomy. It is the chronic toxicity - skin ulceration, fistulation, fibrosis - what results in significant morbidity requiring salvage surgery and/or colostomy. A challenging question remains, how far is PBT able to save chronic toxicity.\n\nO 045 - Hybrid proton-photon and fraction optimization for combined proton-photon treatment\n\nWangyao Li1, Weijie Zhang1, Yuting Lin1, Ronald C Chen1, Hao Gao1\n\n1University of Kansas Medical Center, Radiation Oncology, Kansas City, USA\n\nPurpose: Hybrid proton-photon radiotherapy (RT) can provide better plan quality than proton or photon only RT, in terms of robustness of target coverage and sparing of organs-at-risk (OAR). This work develops a hybrid treatment planning method that can optimize the number of proton and photon fractions as well as proton and photon plan variables, so that the hybrid plans can be clinically delivered day-to-day using either proton or photon machine.\n\nMethods: In the new hybrid treatment planning method, the total dose distribution (sum of proton dose and photon dose) is optimized for robust target coverage and optimal OAR sparing, by jointly optimizing proton spots and photon fluences, while the target dose uniformity is also enforced individually on both proton dose and photon dose, so that the hybrid plans can be separately and robustly delivered on proton or photon machine. To ensure the target dose uniformity for proton and photon plans, the number of proton and photon fractions is explicitly modeled and optimized, so that the target dose for proton and photon dose components is constrained to be a constant fraction of the total prescription dose while the plan quality based on total dose is optimized.\n\nResults: For all cases, hybrid plans provided better overall plan quality and OAR sparing than proton-only or photon-only plans, better target dose uniformity and robustness than proton-only plans, quantified by treatment planning objectives and dosimetric parameters. Moreover, for HN and brain cases, hybrid plans also had better target coverage than photon-only plans.\n\nO 046 - Brain stem toxicity in Carbon Ion Radiotherapy (CIRT)\n\nPiero Fossati1, Birgit Flechl2, Sarah Grossahagauer3, Carola Lutgendorf-Caucig2, Eugen Hug2, Markus Stock3, Antonio Carlino3, Joanna Gora3\n\n1EBG MedAustron Gmbh, Radiation Oncology, Wiener Neustadt, Austria\n\n2MedAustron Ion Therapy Center-, Radiation Oncology, Wiener Neustadt, Austria\n\n3MedAustron Ion Therapy Center-, Medical Physics, Wiener Neustadt, Austria\n\nBackground: Brainstem toxicity is a potentially lethal complication of skull base RT. CIRT is highly precise, but dose calculations can be based on different RBE models and fractionations.\n\nMaterial and methods: Since July 2019, 39 adult patients with tumours in the proximity of the brainstem were treated with CIRT at MedAustron. CIRT was based in 8 patients on the “German Approach” of 66 Gy (RBE) at 3 Gy(RBE), and in 31 patients on the “Japanese fractionation” (64-76.8 Gy RBE in 16 fractions of 4-4.8 Gy(RBE)). Brainstem OAR constraints were defined as Dmax < 54 Gy RBE (for 3Gy/fraction treatment) and D0.1cc < 46 Gy RBE (for 16 fraction approach), respectively. Plans of patients treated with the Japanese fractionation were recomputed with the MKM RBE.\n\nResults: With a mean follow up of 11 months (range: 3-31 months) 1 symptomatic and 2 asymptomatic brainstem events were observed. One patient developed radiographic signs of demyelination in an area with very low dose only (D0.1ccLEM < 25 Gy(RBE), D0.1ccMKM< 15 Gy(RBE)). The patient had gaze and balance "
