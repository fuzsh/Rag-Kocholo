        "text": "For your dissertation you chose a topic from the field of renewable energy. The title of your thesis was: “Stochastic time series analysis in electric power systems and paleo climate data”. Can you describe what you were researching on?\n\nLet’s start by saying that it is a topic that appears a lot in the news nowadays. My research was centered around the question: How can we reliably maintain power delivery in power grids? Can we constantly deliver power if, for example, we are only obtaining it from the sun or from the wind? These power sources are usually called “volatile” or “intermittent”. Some people would say: unreliable. That is one of the questions I wanted to research – is it really unreliable? Mathematicians describe these processes with stochastic processes, which in themself comprise a large research field in mathematics. This field can be boiled down to the mathematics of data and chance, and the study of noise, as we call it.\n\nWhy were stochastic processes interesting for your research questions?\n\nThey give us one way to analyze and simulate the “volatile” nature of power systems, which can negatively impact the stability of a power grid system. There are various time scales at which potential problems emerge. For example, renewable wind power generation varies rapidly in a period of a few seconds, swaying up and down, but it similarly increases and decreases from night to day. Moreover, it varies in intensity over the range of a week, sometimes vanishing completely for as long as seven straight days. My research focused on measurable effects from power generation seen at the level of power-grid frequency – which we commonly remember as 50 Hertz.\n\nThe impact of these fluctuations is detrimental to power systems equipment and the generators themselves. This always results in the question whether renewable energies are reliable. I have no concern in stating that they absolutely are – we know about the consequence of their use in power systems and know how to tackle it. Research only helps us improve our knowledge and find better solutions to increase our use of renewable sources.\n\nAfter your dissertation you worked with scientists from Norway and had a scholarship in Japan. Is research abroad important for young scientists?\n\nIt depends a lot on the topic you are studying. For a long time, it was the standard within academia to study somewhere and then go abroad to see how things work elsewhere. Nowadays with all the possibilities of online collaboration you don’t necessarily have to move elsewhere in order to do very competent research. But it is very important to know that other research mentalities exist in different parts of the world. If you, for example, only work in German institutions, you will only be asking “German-centric” research questions – and that is what changes if you collaborate internationally. It broadens your view. To me that is the key point.\n\nToday you are based at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU) in Ås, about 30 kilometers south of Oslo. From there you returned to Helmholtz for a research visit with HIDAs Norway Exchange Program. What were your experiences?\n\nThis exchange program is a collaboration between the Norwegian Artificial Intelligence Research Consortium (NORA) and its partner institution HIDA. As a PhD or postdoc, you can apply for accommodation and travel grants around a self-organized research project. This gave me the chance to visit Benjamin Schäfer and his research group at the Karlsruher Institut für Technologie (KIT) in December 2022 who similarly works with machine learning applications to power-grid systems. It allowed me to attend a major conference in South Africa and strengthen the collaboration with the Grid Related Research Group, led by Jacques Maritz, at the University of the Free State.\n\nMoreover, as I started my new appointment as associate professor in physics at NMBU in January 2023 and still had budget left, I invited a promising student from the Forschungszentrum Jülich to visit NMBU. For three weeks we worked together here in Ås on machine learning applications for electricity price forecasting. I certainly hope to see more people taking advantage of all the collaboration initiatives from Helmholtz and their research network.\n\nThe interview was conducted by Andrea Walter"
