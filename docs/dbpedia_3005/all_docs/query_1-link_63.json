        "text": "Introduction\n\nColor is an integral part of our experience. It is used to detect objects, to define their contours, and judge their properties. A prime example of its use is the detection of fruit, such as cherries or raspberries, in foliage, and judgment of their degree of ripeness. Full trichromatic vision, based on long-wavelength (L), middle-wavelength (M) and short-wavelength (S) sensitive visual pigments, is unique to primates among mammals. These pigments are separated into individual cone photoreceptors. Other mammals usually have an S pigment in a small proportion of cones plus another pigment in the middle-wavelength region of the spectrum. This may provide them with an ability to distinguish colors along a blue-yellow dimension, but the details are uncertain. In any event, primates appear to have developed a highly sophisticated visual system capable of detecting both the borders between objects and their surface characteristics, such as color and brightness."
