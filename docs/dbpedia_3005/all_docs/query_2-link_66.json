        "text": "Rudolf Clausius (born January 2, 1822, Köslin, Prussia [Poland]—died August 24, 1888, Bonn, Germany) was a German mathematical physicist who formulated the second law of thermodynamics and is credited with making thermodynamics a science.\n\nClausius was appointed professor of physics at the Artillery and Engineering School at Berlin in 1850, the same year in which he presented a paper stating the second law of thermodynamics in the well-known form: “Heat cannot of itself pass from a colder to a hotter body.” He applied his results to an exhaustive development of the theory of the steam engine, stressing the concept of entropy (dissipation of available energy). He became professor of physics at Zürich Polytechnikum in 1855, and, two years later, contributed to the theory of electrolysis (the breaking down of a compound by electricity) by suggesting that molecules are made up of continually interchanging atoms and that electric force does not cause but simply directs the interchange. This view later was used as the basis of the theory of electrolytic dissociation (breakdown of molecules into charged atoms or ions).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPhysics and Natural Law"
