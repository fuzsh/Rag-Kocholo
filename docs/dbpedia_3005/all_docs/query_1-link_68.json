        "text": "On the Reception of Wilhelm Ostwald’s Energism in the United States: The American Frontier, Pragmatism, and a Non-Atomic Theory of Matter in the 1890s:\n\nPaweł Stachura\n\nAbstract\n\nThis article discusses the reception of Wilhelm Ostwald’s energism in the United States. Ostwald, as a renowned teacher and contributor to the field of physical chemistry, was an important influence on the development of chemistry in the United States. In the final decade of the nineteenth century, he also developed and promoted a non-atomic theory of matter called energism. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the reception of energism in the United States was quite enthusiastic because of its perceived compatibility with American pragmatism, and with the values and concepts associated with the American frontier. Energism, in the interpretation of its American proponents, puts more emphasis on individual experience, volition, force, and initiative, as various manifestations of energy, the hypothetical fabric of the universe. This perspective led to interesting speculations about the equivalence of the mind and matter. The article will present primary sources by a philosopher and two natural scientists: John Elof Boodin, Edwin Emery Slosson, and Clarence L. Herrick.\n\nKey Words: energism; pragmatism; science; American frontier\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe chemist Wilhelm Ostwald (1853-1932) occupies a special place in the history of German American cultural exchange because he helped to educate many American chemists, introduced physical chemistry in the United States, and was, before Albert Einstein, one of the most famous German scientists in America. Wilhelm Ostwald was a pioneer of physical chemistry, known for his work on catalysts, solutions, quantitative description of chemical reactions, and relations between chemical reactions and physical factors, which notably included research on energy absorbed and released in chemical reactions (Servos 15). Ostwald was also a widely recognized teacher and author of textbooks; in particular, he supervised early work by many eminent American chemists at his laboratory in Leipzig in the 1890s and 1900s, including Morris Loeb (Saltzman 10-15), Wilder Dwight Bancroft, and Arthur Amos Noyes (Stock). Importantly, Ostwald’s public recognition in the United States and the United Kingdom at that time seems to have been greater than in his native Germany (Hansel 56-57), which was perhaps related to his general effort at promoting international cooperation in science (Holt, “The Bridge” 146-50). Between 1903 and 1906, following invitations from his former students, he made several trips to the United States, lecturing at numerous universities and accepting honorary degrees and memberships in academic corporations, including the American Chemical Society. In the 1880s and 1890s, Ostwald gradually developed a general philosophical system called energism, initially conceived as an alternative to atomism but which eventually became a general philosophical system and gave Ostwald non-scientific fame (Slosson, Major Prophets 191-215). Although energism was a short-lived movement, and Ostwald himself quickly “converted” back to atomism in 1908 (Holt, “A Note” 388), it had a relatively strong reverberance in non-academic publications.\n\nLike the vortex atom, Ostwald’s energism was one of the contemporary research programs (Lakatos 4) for a theory of everything, as Niles R. Holt observes in his brief introduction to the notion:\n\nBased upon Ostwald’s own research, as well as that of his friends Svante Arrhenius and Jacobus van’t Hoff [sic1], Energism was an attempt to establish that energy, not matter, was fundamental to the universe. The antiatomic and antimaterialistic stress of Energism was not unusual in scientific thought in the late nineteenth century. During Ostwald’s lifetime, in fact, several similar theories which stressed the importance of energy rather than matter were proposed by scientific writers. Ostwald, however, regarded his Energism as the ultimate monism, a unitary “science of science” which would bridge not only physics and chemistry, but the physical and biological sciences as well. (“A Note” 386)\n\nThis unitary science was apparently related to Darwinism, a connection that Ostwald made in a lecture from 1895, as related by Holt: “Energism complemented Darwinism, he insisted, because the Darwinian theory of evolution had presented physics and chemistry with the task of explaining the ‘universe in a state of flux’” (“A Note” 387). Holt also notes an important early connection between Ostwald and America, in that Ostwald acknowledged J. Willard Gibbs (whose papers on thermodynamics he translated into German) as an inspiration for energism: just as Gibbs tried to formalize thermodynamics as a set of transformations of energy, so Ostwald tried to formalize chemistry as a “chemistry without substance,” where substances are defined in terms of various levels of various types of energy (perception of matter was explained as energy transfer to sense organs). However, in the exchange of letters between Gibbs and Ostwald, the content is limited to organizational and editorial matters (Moore, Smolinski, and Jaselskis 114-17), as Ostwald proved to be a skillful “organizer and disseminator” of science, appreciating Gibbs’s ideas and trying to make them more available for European scientists (116). Ostwald solicited Gibbs’s contribution to Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie, at that time a new, but already influential journal established by Ostwald and Jacobus van ’t Hoff. He also secured Gibbs’s consent for a republication of his longer work, translated into German. Gibbs, perhaps characteristically, was polite, but not very responsive (122).\n\nThe reception of Ostwald’s energism was part of the more general current of progressive American ideas at the turn of the nineteenth century; the context will be discussed in the concluding section, with reference to John Higham’s essay about the 1890s in Hanging Together: Unity and Diversity in American Culture (2001). The textual evidence suggests that energism, and non-atomic theories of matter in general, were in a peculiar agreement with pragmatism as well as with the symbolic and mythical complex of the American frontier (individualism, violent expansion as formative national experience, representation of landscape, and nature as wilderness). This affinity facilitated the cultural transfer of Ostwald’s ideas and their relatively wide acceptance in the United States, both in academic publications and in popular representations of science. Apart from the relatively well-known response by William James, the present article will describe the reception of Ostwald’s energism in the writings of lesser-known scientists and philosophers who were active in the first decade of the twentieth century: Clarence L. Herrick (1858-1904), Edwin Emery Slosson (1865-1929), and John Elof Boodin (1869-1950). Among these, Herrick’s interpretation of Ostwald’s energism is probably the least known today.\n\nResearch Problem and Selection of Material\n\nWilhelm Ostwald’s energism was an important but previously overlooked influence on American pragmatism. Existing research tended to treat energism as a localized (German and chemical) variety of the general scientific interest in energy. What makes energism important and interesting in its own right, as an influence on pragmatism, is its unusual disciplinary background and its sweeping generality. Rather than a physical theory of energy, work, and force, it was a theory of matter, devised by a prominent chemist, but it was not just a theory of matter; it was more like a theory of experience: human experiences and material phenomena were of the same nature. There was thus a strong affinity between energism and the philosophical monist movement in America.\n\nEnergism can be described as a form of monism aiming to explain all phenomena via the effects of energy transfer, so it was not surprising that numerous texts by Ostwald and his American followers were originally published in The Monist, the important philosophical journal, which advocated Ernst Haeckel’s thought in America in the 1890s.2 What makes Ostwald’s framework so peculiar is that it began as a rather localized and specialized development in the field of physical chemistry but later became a philosophical project. As the name suggests, energism is also notable for its dynamism and emphasis on energy, which was compatible with the role of voluntarism in pragmatist philosophy. Thus, energism was warmly received in the United States as a scientific corollary to pragmatist philosophy, and as a scientific corollary to the general cultural climate of opinion in the United States at the turn of the nineteenth century (specifically, the popular enthusiasm about energy and frontier experience). It was also seen as a vision of a new, American science of the future and, more generally, as an outline for a future American understanding of reality. Despite its initial positive reception, though, energism was quickly abandoned as a research project in chemistry, and its non-scientific influence disappeared in the 1910s. Its status as a blind alley, perhaps as a road not taken, demonstrates that, for a time, a substantial segment of American culture—augmented by German American cultural exchange—could create a new, radically different understanding of the world, down to the level of chemistry textbooks and articles about the theory of matter.\n\nThe selection of James, Herrick, Slosson, and Boodin was dictated by their uniformly positive response to Ostwald’s energism among a set of diverse thinkers who had relatively few points of contact. James and Boodin were pragmatic philosophers, linked by mutual intellectual recognition and personal friendship. Slosson was a chemist as well as a popularizer and administrator of science, and Herrick was a biologist and geologist and later the second president of the University of New Mexico. They also operated in various areas of scientific discourse: James and Boodin published philosophical books and essays; Herrick apparently referred to monism in his teaching but published mostly on biology and geology, and Slosson, although trained academically as a chemist, was mostly a popularizer of science and philosophy. An important point of contact between Ostwald, James, Herrick, and Boodin is that they published in The Monist, the famous journal for philosophy of science. In the texts under discussion, all of the authors associate Ostwald’s views with monist philosophy, although Slosson does not pursue monism actively, presenting impartial summaries of his interviews with Ostwald and Ernst Haeckel. These four intellectuals pursued similar goals when they referred to Ostwald’s energism, attempting to combine a scientific theory of matter with the philosophy of pragmatism as well as with the cultural mythology of the American frontier. It was almost as if certain traits of American identity in the 1890s, American pragmatism and individualism, and the cult of nature and violence, could be incorporated into matter itself as natural phenomena. The authors treated energism as a sort of scientific version of monistic philosophy, perhaps even a promise of a new, monistic science that could bypass the traditional divisions between mind and matter, subject and object, perception and existence. The analysis offered here will demonstrate that they wrote against a perceived mechanicism of atomic materialism, a criticism that will be presented against the background of similar contemporary ideas in science, philosophy, and popular culture. Importantly, energism came in two varieties: initially, in the 1890s, as a theory of matter in chemistry, and then, in the early 1900s, as a totalizing, new philosophy, which proposed a new cognitive framework, based on individual experience, in particular on the dynamic experience of effort, resistance, strain, and yield. The thinkers under discussion could combine Ostwald’s energism with concepts traditionally identified as elements of American identity: individualism, pragmatism, and the frontier experience. Thus, energism was readily, if briefly, adapted as a sort of American style in science, which is perhaps related to Ostwald’s personal popularity in the United States, the lively exchange of letters with American scientists, and his importance as a teacher of many American chemists.\n\nSeveral critics have demonstrated that any scientific concept of matter could have a cultural impact, because there was usually a mutual influence between scientific and non-scientific versions of materialism: Sarah Alexander discovered this mutual bond in Victorian fiction, with reference to physics, and Stephen Hancock made a general connection to science when discussing middle-class subjectivity in Victorian novels. Writing about a more specific case, Stefanie Markovits analyzed the impact of crystallography on the Victorian diamond-craze and its echoes in fiction. In the American context, apart from general studies in the history of ideas (Boller), there have been several recent works about electricity and materialism as sources of imagery; for instance, Paul Gilmore posited “Romantic electricity” (2004) as an early influence on American realism, and Mark Noble (2007) linked the evolution of atomism in chemistry to early versions of Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass in the 1850s. What such studies point to is that scientific notions were readily used by non-scientists (in literature and public discourse) as long as they conformed to a general worldview.\n\nThus, in the case of the American reception of energism, energy could be augmented by a set of non-scientific connotations related to freedom, alertness, virility, spontaneity, and initiative. Those were the qualities commonly associated with the myth of the American frontier as discussed in classic studies of the myth-and-symbol school of American studies, where the American character was usually presented against the background of the sublime beauty of Western landscapes: the American frontier experience was a confrontation between a human being and wild nature.33 In extreme cases, as described in the conclusion of this article, an American literary character would first confront, and then spiritually fuse with nature. This fusion is structurally analogous to some descriptions of the mind and matter in American texts about energism, a similarity which will be discussed in the following sections. The myth-and-symbol critics focus on what Slotkin describes as “the structuring metaphor of American experience” (5): exploration and fight in sparsely populated frontier land. If, as those critics suggests, the Western frontier experience was a cornerstone of American national identity, then it could also include an American frontier style in science. This possibility will be elaborated on in the concluding section. Before that, however, the paper will present the scientific background of energism, comparing it with other contemporary theories of matter, then present a survey of the dissemination of Ostwald’s views in the United States, and then present the American responses chronologically.\n\nThe Scientific Context: Energism as a Non-Atomic Theory of Matter and as Monistic Philosophy\n\nOstwald’s energism was a non-atomic, non-substantialist theory of matter that sought to understand phenomena purely in terms of energy transfer. That framework applied not only to matter (energy was not just a different word for matter), but to human perception and sensory experience (perception was also a form of energy transfer). It was, of course, not the only non-atomic theory of matter developed late in the nineteenth century; the other major project was the vortex atom, which was primarily a British idea. Throughout the nineteenth century, there were also a number of challenges to the atomic theory of matter in chemistry (­Patterson 83-92). Energism was rooted in the general development of the concept of energy, as it emerged in nineteenth-century science. From the vantage point of the history of physics, Ostwald’s energism is part of the process described in Crosbie Smith’s The Science of Energy (1998), that is, the increasing importance of the notions of energy and entropy in the vocabulary of modern science after the 1850s, especially in the work of James Prescott Joule, James Clerk Maxwell, William and James ­Thomson, and P. G. Tait. By emphasizing their work, Smith presents the physics of energy as a local, Northern-British development, part of the history of ideas in Victorian England. More recently, Ingo Müller (2007) presented a wider international history of energy with its implications for other sciences (biology, sociology) in the twentieth century. Müller mentions Ostwald briefly because of his recognition and translation of J. Willard Gibbs’s work on thermodynamics (their correspondence has been briefly discussed in the introduction). As a more general and less technical background for Ostwald’s energism, two well-known earlier books seem to stand out, because their recognition went beyond the world of natural science: the notions of energy, power, and entropy had been made popular earlier in the nineteenth century by Hermann von Helmholtz in On the Conservation of Force (1847), and ­Balfour Stewart’s and P. G. Tait’s The Unseen Universe (1875) is arguably one of the books that originated the popular metaphors of cosmic energy, spaces permeated by good and bad energy, etc. The general framework for atomic and non-atomic theories of matter in the late nineteenth century was the opposition between dynamics and mechanics. Dynamic models of matter (that is models devised purely in terms of force and energy) were probably seen as a way to a science that would be simultaneously more religiously minded and progressive, an antidote against mechanicist materialism.4 The present paper, however, will focus on a specific development in the 1890s, when Ostwald and his followers tried to discuss chemical phenomena—and materiality more generally—exclusively in terms derived from thermodynamics without the use of the substantialist atom known from the kinetic theory of matter. In other words, Ostwald’s energism, rather than being considered as part of the physics of energy, features here as a non-atomic theory of matter and part of chemistry.\n\nIn a survey article from 1968, S. G. Brush (163-67) presented a long catalog of theories of matter in the nineteenth century, arranged chronologically as background for Ernst Mach’s criticism of the atomic theory. The vortex atom in Victorian England and Wilhelm Ostwald’s energism are some of the most extensively described items on Brush’s list. Both theories had, quite apart from their scientific life as research programs, a rich array of “ideological uses and philosophical responses” (Kragh 85). The vortex atom, developed in the last four decades of the nineteenth century, was a variant of the continuum-based view of matter, possibly related to Descartes’s vortices and vaguely similar to the “fluids” whose existence was assumed in earlier physics and chemistry (Kragh 34).\n\nThe history of vortex-atom theory was described by Crosbie Smith (1998) and Helge Kragh (2002). It was developed in the 1860s, and then intermittently until the 1890s, by a group of prominent British physicists, including William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), P. G. Tait (physicist and mathematician, pioneer of topology), and J. J. Thomson (who would later discover the electron). The theory had some following in Britain and the United States, but apparently less so in France or Germany, and can consequently be regarded as an example of a national style in science (Kragh 80-81). The point of this “hydrokinetic theory of matter” was that it was a “unitary continuum theory” of a “Universal Plenum” (Kragh 33), conceived initially based on Hermann von Helmholtz’s work on hydrodynamics: in 1859, the German physicist had presented a mathematical demonstration that stable vortex rings could exist indefinitely in a (theoretical) continuous elastic fluid, rather like the remarkably stable smoke rings blown by guns or as a smoking trick. For a time, the vortex atom was recognized as a very promising idea on the cutting edge of science, and it seems that explanation of some chemical phenomena was an important expectation from the vortex theory. For example, in a contemporary, popularizing American book, Matter, Energy, Force, and Work (1898) by Silas W. Holman, there is a long section on the vortex atom, with a chapter on its application in chemistry (205-23) as well as its possible use for explanation of “the changes of energy attending chemical actions, which shows itself so largely in the production or absorption of heat and electrical energy” (212). In the United States, there was even a curious philosophical pamphlet by the anthropologist Charles Staniland Wake (1907) that attempted to create an ethical and anthropological system based on the vortex atom.\n\nCompared with the vortex atom, Ostwald’s energism was a less developed research program, with several publications by Ostwald and a limited number of responses from philosophers and popularizers. However, at least some writings suggest that Ostwald knew how to devise a comprehensive, useful energetic approach and terminology, as in A Handbook of Colloid-Chemistry (1915), where he describes the phenomena of dispersion, solvency, and surface tension purely in terms of energy transfer, without mentioning atoms at all, and occasionally suggesting the continuity of matter (87-95). The book was published in 1895, and the English translation had several British and American editions between 1915 and into the 1920s. It is not a philosophical text but an example of the practical applicability of energism in chemistry.\n\nIt would seem likely that Ostwald would have referred to an earlier non-atomic research project, particularly the vortex theory. This, however, seems not to have been the case: Kragh, in the final sections of the article on the vortex atom, observed that there were remarkably few references to one another between the English proponents of the vortex atom, the German scientists who argued for and against Ostwald’s energism (Deltete 46-50), and the contemporary French, German, and American empirical critics of the atomic theory (Kragh 90). Herrick’s article on monism, discussed below, seems to be a rare example of such a cross-reference, but this is largely because it is a compilatory article published in 1905 when both theories were already becoming historical artifacts.\n\nReception of Ostwald’s Energism in the United States: Translations\n\nChronologically, the American reception of Ostwald’s energism is limited to a cluster of texts from the 1890s and the 1900s. It seems logical to start with his own texts translated and published in the United States. A survey of Ostwald’s publications in America shows the ideas that were associated with him at the time. Natural Philosophy, the major work presenting the chemical aspect of energism, was published by Holt and Company in 1910, with numerous reprinted editions published immediately afterward or in the following years. In this book, Ostwald describes atoms as a “useful” cognitive tool, especially with reference to the kinetic theory of gases, but ultimately an “injurious” one, because the image of atoms as little beads of matter was too naïve (Natural Philosophy 458-80). Earlier, Ostwald’s non-technical (non-chemical) publications seem close to Haeckel’s philosophical monism, and in his criticism of the atomic theory of matter, Ostwald often turns against philosophical materialism. Thus, Popular Science Monthly published Ostwald’s article on “The Failure of Scientific Materialism” in 1896, and Scientific Progress reprinted the same article but with the more radical and promising title, “Emancipation from Scientific Materialism.” In 1903, International Quarterly published a more accessible (and cautious) article on “The Philosophical Meaning of Energy,” and two years later, “A Theory of Happiness,” an example of the later phase of energism, when it was no longer a chemical theory but rather a philosophical movement. A number of Ostwald’s articles were published in The Monist, including “The Modern Theory of Energetics” (1907). Some English material on energism was published as pamphlets, for instance, Monism as the Goal of Civilization (1913), published by the International Committee of Monism in Hamburg. This brief survey is by no means complete, and it does not include Ostwald’s more specific and technical chemistry books, textbooks, and articles, translated and published in the United States.\n\nOstwald’s Energism in the United States: General Response by William James\n\nOstwald’s philosophical ideas appealed to American thinkers at the beginning of the twentieth century. Sergio Franzese, in an exhaustive analysis of William James’s use of the concept of energy, points to the importance of the obvious, if superficial, connotations of the concept in popular discourse, the sort of connotations that have become common in everyday language but were relatively new in the popular materials from the 1860s through the 1890s. Franzese supplies the context for James’s thought: energy enters the general discourse (politics, popular culture) as a synonym for virility, toughness, “the primarily masculine and pugnacious spirit of the American people and democracy,” and as one of the defining qualities of “the tough American male, the hero of the traditional myth of the frontier” (159).\n\nInterestingly, Franzese observes that equating energy with virility is different from the contemporary versions of “energy” in the political and philosophical writings of Thomas Carlyle, John Ruskin, Ernest Renan, and Henry Adams, all of who referred to Helmholtz’s pessimistic conceptualization of energy in terms of dissipation and increasing entropy (153-56). The American “energy” of the 1890s was apparently energetic enough to defy the mechanical, thermodynamic, and pessimistic image of the universe known from philosophical reactions to Helmholtz’s book (159). As Franzese observes, James associated energy with pragmatism and the “will to believe,” vaguely confronting these three notions with a dark triad of determinism, materialism, and the “necessary death” of the universe:\n\nIn Pragmatism, in particular, beside the explicit mention of Maxwell and Ostwald as examples of the pragmatist attitude of thinking, James deals with the metaphysical significance of the concepts of God, matter, and energy in relation to entropy and the thermal death of the planet. […] Given a possible ending of all life in entropic catastrophe, the meaning of the metaphysical alternative between God and Matter is immediately evident. If we believe that Matter is the fundamental principle of the universe, nothing can prevent Matter from following its eternal laws and lead the universe to its necessary death. If, on the contrary, we believe that a benign God oversees the destiny of the universe, chances are that the universe, its moral order, and all the human efforts in it are not doomed to destruction. (162)\n\nFranzese links this reasoning to James’s reading of The Unseen Universe but notes that the relevant passage in Pragmatism is followed by a reference to Ostwald, whose idea of energy is presented as a pragmatic “conceptual device” that could counter materialism and its presumed deadly consequences. The pragmatic device, as it seems, was constructed on the authority of science, but with little reference to any specific scientific theory of energy: “Anyone who tried to trace James’s notion of energy back to the scientific theories of his days would eventually find himself in the embarrassing situation of having to admit that James does not follow any particular scientific theory of energy, even if his texts certainly echo with the contents of the scientific debate on energy” (Franzese 164). Energy thus seems to have been a sort of non-materialistic substitute for matter, a concept that would neutralize the supposedly negative implications of materialism without giving up on the authority of natural sciences; if material objects were a form of energy, they could be perceived scientifically, optimistically, and religiously at the same time. This is the touch that could give Ostwald recognition and admiration in America (and in Germany) that went beyond his importance as a chemist.\n\nOstwald’s Energism in the United States: Clarence L. Herrick as the Practical User\n\nThe combination of empirical science with the popular American energetics mentioned above (virility and frontier spirit) is exemplified by Clarence L. Herrick’s philosophical writings, particularly the paper on “The Passing of Scientific Materialism” published in The Monist in 1905. The same issue of The Monist in which Herrick’s article was published includes his obituary, which recounts his education and scientific career. Born in 1858 in Minneapolis, he initially specialized as a neurologist at the University of Minnesota, spent a year studying in Leipzig,5 and subsequently developed a wider spectrum of academic interests as professor of natural sciences and geology at the University of Chicago and as President of the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque after 1887 (today he is sometimes mentioned by local historians for his pioneering geological work there). His son, Charles Judson Herrick, published an extensive memoir in Transactions of the American Philosophical Society in 1955 in which he quotes an astonishing description of Clarence L. Herrick from Dorothy Hughes’s Pueblo in the Mesa (1939), a history of the University of New Mexico, where Herrick is mentioned as “the great man” in the early days of the university:6\n\nUnder the stars of New Mexico’s matchless sky I listened to the great man discuss evolution, magmatic segregation, stream erosion, and as the dying fire sunk to glowing ambers and the stars shone more brightly I listened while the scintillating mind strayed into those fields of psychology and philosophy he loved so well, and heard him expound the principles of dynamic monism. (128)\n\nPerhaps such inspiring moments were related to Herrick’s two geological survey articles published in 1898. Among his other non-philosophical writings, apart from the two geological surveys, there are also occasional writings on physiology and neurology (1899), and earlier papers on fauna in Minnesota and Georgia.\n\nHerrick’s article on monism (1905) presented a general history of materialism from its philosophical beginnings to its nineteenth-century edition as a scientific doctrine, concluding that materialism would soon be replaced by dynamic monism. In the philosophical conclusion of the article, the author assumes that the basic stuff of the universe (arche, or Urstoff) is energy, or rather intensity and activity, which he further reduces to the perception of strain and resistance experienced by human will in contact with phenomena. Thus, there is a reference to Arthur Schopenhauer at the end of the article, including a long quotation from On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, where the German philosopher famously describes the essence of matter as “pure action as such, causality itself” (63).7\n\nHerrick attempts to reduce matter phenomenologically (he does not use the term, but it seems to be appropriate), by observing that many physical concepts related to matter (mass, weight, momentum, gravity) can be expressed in terms of energy:\n\nMass is used as though it somehow represented “amount of matter,” but, in reality, it is expressed in units of a force, and reasons may be given for using energy instead of a mass. It is generally agreed to represent kinetic energy by the formula v2/m2, when m equals mass and v equals velocity of the moving body. Potential energy will then be represented by the fs, where f equals force or measure of striving to change its place, and s the space passed over by the point considered in the change of state. (“The Passing” 60)\n\nIt follows that the m (quantity) can be factored out of the equations by defining it in terms of the difference (ratio) between an accepted unit of measurement (also defined as kinetic or gravitational force) and a reading on a dynamometer; this is a very convoluted description of weighing something on scales. The reading on scales, as Herrick proposes, is a reading of “intensity” (how much of a pull there is), which Herrick expresses in terms of religious-like litany, describing the activity of measuring a force:\n\nThe general law that in energy the intensity must have the same value in all parts of the system is interpreted to mean that\n\nFor kinetic energy velocity equals intensity,\n\n“ potential energy force equals intensity,\n\n“ heat energy temperature equals intensity,\n\n“ electrical energy electromotive force equals intensity;\n\nAnd that, whenever the intensity varies in different parts of the system, the latter is in a state of unrest until equilibrium is restored. (“The Passing” 60; quotation marks in original)\n\nHerrick does not elaborate on how this might lead to equations without mass in them, but proceeds to the next section about recent developments in chemistry and physics, especially the discovery of radioactivity and William Crookes’s research in “rarefied matter” (plasma). To him, those discoveries had blurred the distinction between matter and energy. The primary target of criticism in the article was no longer the concept of mass but the concept of the atom; Herrick is proposing a monistic image of matter, undivided into discrete particles but “filling” space in the manner of the etheric medium of vortex atoms whose history Herrick described at length earlier in the article. Rather than “filling” space, Herrick’s energetic matter is somehow synonymous with space; matter is understood to be a continuous play of energetic effects that make, or constitute, space and time.\n\nThe argument continues with the identification of energy as a subjective experience of strain. For Herrick, continuous matter is only a generalization of individual experience of strain and resistance encountered by an individual activity (“The Passing” 77). Atomic theory of matter seems to be, in this view, a derivative of the concepts of mass and force, a derivation that he presented as naïve, artificial, and superfluous substantialism. The dynamic alternative, presented as a more natural and empirical approach, is the individual experience, which for Herrick means an experience of “effort or strain.” Natural science, eventually, becomes a sort of generalized psychology:\n\nPsychological moments alone remain reliable and trustworthy measures of quantity. In last resort we discover (what has always been known but never realised) that the only energy we really know is that which we ourselves generate. The axiom at the bottom of all science is that the force impinging on my sensorium is commensurate, according to some law, known or unknown, with the reaction within my kinesodic system. In other words, the only real measure is mental reaction thereto – sense of effort or strain. (“The Passing” 78)\n\nThose “psychological moments” of “effort or strain” are not only the only facts of science for Herrick but the stuff of existence itself. In a manner that seems strangely circular and only vaguely related to atomism, Herrick finally equates energy with subjective intensity of experience (in his case, the experience of scientific laboratory work). The intensity of experience, for Herrick, is the fabric of the universe, and the measurement of all physical quantities is consequently the measurement of intensity of experience, the “muscle-strain” when someone takes a reading: “It would seem, then, that we really estimate in homo-ergs or man-powers. May it not be possible to reduce all to a standard, say of ‘psychs’?” (“The Passing” 78).\n\nBe it as it may, the argument implies that the measured quantities are continuous. For Herrick, science (and indeed all perception) is about measuring, not counting. In the closing lines of the article, he describes the “material hypothesis” as a survivor of metaphysical prejudice, and by “material hypothesis” he means atomism in chemistry, and the kinetic theory of matter in physics, both based on the idea that matter comes in discrete, massive portions separated by empty space. Herrick envisioned a future science, in which human experience of matter would be understood as a continuous play of intensities. Only chemists had apparently not caught up with the development: “The abacus has long since been abolished from our schools, is it still necessary to our physicists, must our chemists still continue to count on their fingers?” (85).\n\nHerrick’s conclusion was paralleled on the subjective side by “Physiological Corollaries of the Equilibrium Theory of Nervous Action and Control” (1898), one of his psychological writings, as well as in “The Concept of Individuality,” a posthumously published essay (1910), whose fragments were published as four articles in Psychological Review in 1904 and 1907. In these writings, Herrick approaches matter from the subjective point of view, interpreting individual mental states as “the locus of a certain vector force” (Metaphysics 36), mentioning vortex atoms “as illustration” (32) of individual consciousness, defined in dynamic terms as vectors, circular movement, and centripetal acceleration. Another illustration comes directly from the American West, when Herrick describes a dust devil to exemplify the apparent stability of a fast-revolving vortex: “On the open plains in the western desert a slender column of dust rising perhaps 150 feet in the apparently still air may be seen slowly moving at the rate at which a man might walk, sometimes pursuing a uniform path, at others suddenly turning” (31). The dust devil, which Herrick describes as “the result of the union of equilibrated forces,” is compared to human consciousness, hesitating and exploring in an unpredictable way (32). Thus, Herrick could describe subjectivity without substance as a dynamic equilibrium of forces, and he could similarly describe material objectivity as the effect of a dynamic equilibrium between various observable forces (intensities). The psychological writings, however, do not mention Ostwald explicitly.\n\nHerrick’s 1905 article is an important example of a non-atomic materialism that criticized traditional atomism as a microscopic version of naïve materialism. The chemical version of materialism, which Herrick does not ignore but tries to integrate into his system, seems to have been incompatible with a continuous image of matter; chemical atomism was a stronghold of what he perceived as an outdated and naïve vision of matter made of atoms separated by empty space. Importantly, Herrick’s essay was influenced by recent discoveries of radioactivity and the emerging science of nuclear physics. The author tries to account for a number of discoveries, including radioactive decay, protons, neutrons, and electrons, and does not see them as incompatible with dynamic monism. Perhaps the most important objective, or promise, of the monistic view of matter was an integration of material phenomena with psychology, or even a theoretical integration of supernatural concepts with natural science. Herrick does not explicitly comment on the supernatural possibility.\n\nExplicitly, the American philosopher of nature presents an association between energism and a dynamic idea of individual struggle, giving the scientific debate a cultural, potentially political, quality. This important angle of Herrick’s article is corroborated by Franzese’s observations on James’s reception of energism and by Herrick’s biographical background in the American West, as indicated by the memoir quoted here. It also comes out in Herrick’s remarks on effort and strain as well as in the description of the dust devil. Herrick did not create an opposition between subjective force and external resistance, but rather saw subjective experience as a result of a dynamic equilibrium between various natural forces. Herrick rarely makes an open reference to Ostwald, but when he does, it is because this subjectivity-as-equilibrium had, at least theoretically, a calculable energy, possibly with various types of energy quickly transforming into one another. Herrick’s goal seems to have been to celebrate the individual confrontation with the outer world, and to integrate, in a monistic manner, an individual subjectivity with its surroundings, in the same way as his description of the dust devil merges an individual being into one with the landscape that makes it.\n\nOstwald’s Energism in the United States: Popular Presentation by Edwin Emery Slosson\n\nIf energism was a sort of chemistry turning into metaphysics, it is only appropriate that Ostwald was described as a prophet. Edwin Emery Slosson’s Major Prophets of Today (1914) is a collection of interviews turned into essays published in The Independent, a weekly New York magazine edited by Slosson. Slosson, who had scientific training and was a professor of chemistry at the University of Wyoming, was the first head of Science Service (the federal educational and popularizing agency), and has been recognized for his contribution to the popularization of science in the first decades of the twentieth century (Barton 17-20). His non-academic publications are mostly popular-science books, but he also published collections of interviews with celebrity intellectuals and articles on education. Major Prophets of Today includes chapters on Ostwald, Henri Bergson, Maurice Maeterlinck, H. G. Wells, and Ernst Haeckel. Slosson presents a cautiously enthusiastic, accessible summarizing view of energism, describing it with a mixture of respectful curiosity and benign skepticism, as if already writing about the past (Slosson, Major Prophets 198). This is understandable, given the fact that at the time of the interview (in 1912), even Ostwald did not recognize energism as a useful research project in physics and chemistry but rather as a sort of ethical system.8 In the chapter on Ernst Haeckel, Slosson mentions Ostwald as the author of weekly lay sermons for Monist societies in Jena: “But it is curious to observe how rapidly the Monist locals are assuming the forms of the non-conformist congregations. They celebrate Christmas—with trees, candles, and gifts. They have a weekly sermon by Ostwald and a Sunday-school paper, Die Sonne” (Major Prophets 249). Ostwald’s ethics of energy were drawn in terms which vaguely resemble general thermodynamic formulae:\n\nMaeterlinck expresses his idea of happiness through the symbol of the Blue Bird. Ostwald expresses his by\n\nG = E2 – W2\n\nPoets and scientists both are necessarily symbolists. […] Ostwald, however, insists that his formula is not a mere mathematical jest, but applicable to practical affairs, and like a true physician he has tried it on himself and knows that it works. […] An interpretation of Ostwald’s formula […] will enable the reader to try it for himself. G stands for happiness (Glück). This, according to the theory of energetics, is dependent upon the amount of energy expended, might in fact be measured by the amount of carbon dioxid (!) produced by conscious activity if we could separate it from the unconscious psychological processes of the body. Part of this Energy is expended in agreeable ways; let that be represented by E. But there is always another part […], such as painful feelings, disagreeable thoughts, unwilling duties; that might be represented by W (widerwillig). (192-93)\n\nSlosson’s account of Ostwald’s energism is rather brief, but it echoes a relatively large number of translations published in America at the time; Ostwald represented a triumph of German science in America, as no German scientist before Einstein, perhaps not even Ernst Haeckel, could match his popularity among the American reading public.\n\nAs has already been mentioned in the section about James, American pragmatists invoked Ostwald as a source of scientific authority to support the image of an energetic universe in flux. Ostwald thus influenced the American pragmatism with his concept of matter and chemical reactions as phenomena that could be accounted for purely in terms of energy and thermodynamics; by a stretch, pragmatism was a sort of voluntarist chemistry. Sometimes his presence is rather indirect, as in Slosson’s later book, Six Major Prophets (1917), which has a chapter on Dewey. Slosson quotes from Dewey’s quotation from a German essay on pragmatism, a definition which Dewey criticized in the preface to Influence of Darwin: “Epistemologically, nominalism; psychologically, voluntarism; cosmologically, energism; metaphysically, agnosticism; ethically, meliorism on the basis of the Bentham-Mill-utilitarianism” (258). Slosson did not identify the quotation, but Dewey did, and it comes from Ludwig Stein’s pamphlet, Der Pragmatismus: Ein neuer Name für alte Denkmethoden (Pragmatism: A New Name for Old Methods of Thinking, 1908), where Ostwald is mentioned four times, either as representative of a return to Aristotelian entelechy, or as a “voluntarischer Denktypus” (Stein 34), a representative of a voluntaristic type of thinking. Because human will was equated, in American interpretations of Ostwald’s ideas, with external phenomena (energy transfer), perception could be redefined as an energetic struggle between various physical powers. Concurrently, the inner, mental phenomena occurred when an energetic system was disturbed by a new force and reached a new equilibrium.\n\nThis monistic idea is fascinating because it suggests a belief in the possibility of empirical research in direct interface between mind and matter. Thus, when pragmatism and Ostwald’s energism were described in proximity, if not equated, what was at stake was more than a voluntary power: to get rid of superfluous concepts and to focus on practical action but also to open new research avenues in natural sciences.9\n\nOstwald’s Energism in the United States: The Pragmatic Realism of John Elof Boodin\n\nThe references to energism in William James’s work are not as specific as in John Elof Boodin’s A Realistic Universe: An Introduction to Metaphysics (1916). In the first part of this book—part manifesto, part a textbook on metaphysics—Boodin discusses “Energy and Things,” and introduces the concept of “Pragmatic Energism” (33-61), an attempt to revive the radical version of Ostwald’s energism by reducing all material phenomena to relations between variables in formulae that define various types of energy. Boodin refers to William James, rather than Ostwald, when he defines pragmatic energism. The constitutive parts of his framework are “systems” variously described as energy systems and mechanical systems:\n\nOur energy systems are cross sections of reality in the service of our special purposes. They are pragmatic, but that does not mean they are unreal. […] In analysing any such system, there are certain general postulates holding for all systems: there must be certain variables, there must be the form or organizing relation of the system, and there must be recurrence. Recurrence is the pragmatic equivalent of what an older metaphysics spoke of as substance. […] In a mechanical system, such as that of ordinary kinetic energy, we have three independent variables: gravitation mass, space units, and temporal units. For purposes of social description, these variables must be standardised. We ascertain the gravitation mass at a certain location on the Earth’s surface, Paris for example. We standardize our space units in terms of some common measure, kept at a certain constant temperature, whether it be the steel yard in London, or the meter in Paris. We standardize our temporal units in terms of sidereal time, and our clocks are so regulated. (A Realistic Universe 38)\n\nThe insistence on “recurrence” is related to Boodin’s attempt to construct realism, a non-subjective, external environment for subjectivity; reality is, for Boodin, what responds in a consistent way, eventually leading (or forcing) a subject to recognize a pattern. Energism furnished Boodin with a scientifically formulated idea of reality as a set of recurrent patterns of responses to human actions.\n\nImmediately after this paragraph, Boodin proposes to replace the atomic theory of matter with a new paradigm based on “organizing relation[s]” (formulae) and continuous variables, such as temperature, mass, or energy (A Realistic Universe 38-39). Without mentioning energism explicitly, Boodin presents its main tenet: the human experience of matter is based on an interplay of continuous variables. Substance and atom were, in this framework, mere visualizations, or metaphors, based on everyday-life imagery of objects (stones or marbles). The idea of continuous matter returns in the following chapter, with reference to recent discoveries of sub-atomic particles (A Realistic Universe 70-71), but what matters for Boodin is material reality rather than theory of matter; the philosopher needs reality as source of recurrent patterns that can be pragmatically used—and named—in scientific theories. Subsequently, he conceives of atoms as “more or less stable dynamic clusters within dynamic systems” (83) and makes a few references to Ostwald’s energism (81, 115) presenting energism as a new, pragmatically superior theory of reality because it is applicable in more fields than atomic materialism (389).\n\nWith the reference to Ostwald, Boodin could describe recurrence in terms of energy and force. Recurrent patterns emerged when subjective forces (the forces experienced as our subjective strain) met resistance from external forces; it was only through a relative “match” between forces that perception and measurement were possible as a sort of mutually acknowledged existence. Matthias Neuber wrote that energism was, for Boodin, the necessary tool for “bridging the gap between ‘the’ subjective and ‘the’ objective,” because “[t]he knower and the known are related through certain energetic dependencies” (8). Neuber provides an extensive discussion of Boodin’s earlier paper on “Pragmatic Realism,” published in The Monist in 1910, where he equated perception with existence, both understood to be the result of an encounter between two (presumably localized) sets of physical forces. Consequently, he concludes that possible interactions between mental and physical energy should be studied empirically, pointing to everyday experience: “A cup of coffee or a good beefsteak makes a difference to thinking. But that does not necessarily make them thought stuff” (605). Boodin does not immediately suggest that thinking could work the other way, affecting beefsteaks and coffee. But on the following page, he distinguishes between “extra-subjective energetic relation,” as when people use tools to produce food and drink, and “subjective energetic relations” which are still unknown, but could be extremely useful: “Not completeness, but control, is what we aim at” (606). This is one of the moments when Boodin seems to hint at direct control of the mind over matter as a theoretical possibility in the energetic framework, a possibility that would have to be empirically verified.\n\nUnlike in Herrick’s writings, Boodin’s energism is not clearly related to the imagery of struggle between people and nature, but there is a fragment of A Realistic Universe where the interplay of forces is described in terms of vitality, that is, life is defined as another confrontation between subjective and objective forces engaged in the process of mutual definition: “If, again, we take an organic system, we find that we can deal with this on the basis of the same postulates. Here too we have our variables, our organizing relation, and recurrence. Life, complex as it is, is after all, a chemical compound” (A Realistic Universe 40). It would seem that, for Boodin, life is an intrinsic quality of matter, or more appropriately, of reality itself (Boodin refers to an article in the Encyclopedia Britannica about the protoplasm). Thus, Boodin proposes a reality that is dynamic and very much alive with activity, which will be interpreted in the conclusions, in terms of the popularity of dynamism in American general discourse of the 1890s.\n\nInterpretation and Conclusions\n\nThe texts suggest that the positive reception of Ostwald’s energism was strongly influenced by the contemporary American ideological context. William James found energism useful as a scientific version of the American praise for energy as a quality of character, with the associated connotations of virility, initiative, individualism, and frontier heroism; the references are consequently vague and infrequent. Boodin, the other pragmatic philosopher influenced by Ostwald, treated energism as a combination of pragmatism and realism, an idea of objective reality unencumbered by redundant, substantialist concepts. Human perception of matter was the result of interaction, or as Boodin called it, “putting in context,” a sort of confrontation between various “energy centers” or “dynamic clusters” (Boodin, A Realistic Universe 83). Herrick could relate very similar ideas to his scientific experience, putting more emphasis on intensity and struggle, and on occasional references to his first-hand experience of Western landscape. Generally, Ostwald’s energism made it possible to conceive of material reality as the result of an interaction between human effort and natural resistance, turning the entire universe—including micro- and macrocosm as well as subjectivity and objectivity—into a scene of confrontation and struggle. The examples suggest that in the American context, the frontier expansion and settlement was the most readily available source of imagery for comparisons: human perception of matter was a form of energetic struggle, comparable to Western expansion and settlement.\n\nIn American studies, the frontier theme has been critically discussed in a sequence of synthetic, historical books by authors described as the “myth and symbol school,” ranging from Vernon Louis Parrington and Van Wyck Brooks in the 1920s, through R. W. B. Lewis, Henry Nash Smith, and Bernard De Voto in the 1940s and 1950s, to Leo Marx and Richard Slotkin in the 1960s and 1970s. These authors emphasized the importance of mythic plots and symbolic images in the formation of a national identity, often criticizing the persistence of content in historical texts that was idealized, exaggerated, untrue, and fraudulent, or somehow damaging. Apart from Parrington and Van Wyck Brooks, myth and symbol critics focused on the American frontier: Smith and De Voto criticized a history of idealized or fraudulent descriptions of Western landscape; Marx denounced the “pastoral myth” of nature as a regenerative force for American urban populations, and Slotkin focused on the combination of violent scenes and pastoral settings in Western narratives. It would be redundant to summarize their classic works, especially given their bulk and extensive collections of source material, but one of their focal points of reference seems to be Frederick Jackson Turner’s Importance of the Frontier in American History (1893). Turner’s lecture, which would then be incorporated into a longer book published in 1921, famously starts with the conclusion: the frontier experience had been recently terminated, there was no territory left for free expansion, and there was a need for new frontiers.\n\nThus, in the United States of the 1890s, there was a concerted effort to construct a theory of matter as a new frontier territory. In the writings, particularly those by James and Herrick, matter and energy have the attributes of the mythical Western frontier landscape: they resist the human expansive effort but eventually yield to it, and at the same time they shape human subjectivity, the individual character, and identity. Particularly in Herrick’s work, the construction of subjectivity as an equilibrium of natural forces and intensities suggests that an individual is only a place where some specific force equilibrium occurs. A similar concept was proposed by Boodin when he wrote about “energetic continuities” (“Pragmatic Realism” 610). These concepts are monistic in that they melt together the subject and the object. They are quite similar to numerous descriptions of a solitary reverie in a natural landscape, discussed in Marx’s book as moments of near-complete merging of subjectivity and objectivity (Marx 288-95), but also as scenes of a self-preservation struggle of subjectivity confronted with nature, and as distinctly American frontier experiences (318-19).\n\nSimilarly, Slotkin lists numerous, recurrent scenes of regenerative violence, or rebirth through violent struggle in the Western frontier, both in fiction and in historiography, as symbolic images of American national identity. Slotkin observed that, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, pastoral descriptions of frontier landscape would conventionally include elements of the sublime aesthetic, such as gigantic features, steep slopes, and dizzy heights, but that the sublime also implied violence and danger which was “dwarfing and dominating the human” (202). Following the sublime convention, pastoral frontier landscapes could be combined with scenes of frontier violence. Against the sublime struggle, the American mythic heroes, such as Davy Crockett, would win in a struggle that was “satisfying” and “physical rather than cerebral” (415). The same symbolism is found in James’s appreciation of energism as praise for American virility, in Boodin’s idea that reality is defined by interaction of force-fields, and in Herrick’s insistence that reality is made out of a struggle between natural intensities and the strain of a measuring and discerning eye. Perhaps, most generally, just like the American frontier could be redefined in terms of space exploration in the 1960s, so it could be redefined as exploration of the microcosm and as a theory of matter in the 1890s.\n\nIn his essay “The Reorientation of American Culture in the 1890s,” John Higham provides numerous examples of the widespread and diverse praise for dynamism in American culture at the time, ranging from popular music and sports to writings and public statements by intellectuals who started to express praise for anti-intellectualism, action, practicality, virility, physicality, or sheer violence (Hanging Together 177-79). For Higham, this was “a profound spiritual reaction” to the earlier spirit of gentility, conformity, dullness, and above all, mechanization of life in the industrial economy (177). In intellectual history, the earlier epoch, from the 1860s to the 1880s, was characterized by “a materialistic outlook” (185), by dominance of philosophical systems (Spencerian, Hegelian, positivist, Marxist), and by the underlying idea of slow, predictable, evolutionary progress governed by immutable laws (185); such ideas can be broadly described as deterministic and mechanicist ones, because they often questioned, or eroded, the importance (or existence) of free will. In general terms, the new dynamic thinking of the 1890s was about reasserting the free, willing vitality as an agent of natural, social, and historical life. Even more broadly, it seems to have been about “real” life versus a sort of living death. Higham sees American pragmatism as a philosophical version of the new dynamic vitality, describing a William James who “struck the distinctive note of the 1890s by interpreting all ideas as plans for action and by exalting the will” (191).\n\nThe intellectual goal of the new dynamic thinking, according to Higham, was “liberation from closed systems and formalistic abstractions” (195), and, in Europe, this tendency apparently led to subjectivism and criticism of empirical science. In America, the tendency was different:\n\nUnready for the heightened subjectivity of European thought, American intellectuals did not engage in the accompanying criticism of scientific ideas. In Europe objective reality lost some of its authority. Americans, however, resisted sharp segregation between various levels and types of thought: between facts and values, intellect and intuition, the scientific and the supra-scientific. “Something there is that doesn’t love a wall,” an American poet declared some years later; and the chief American philosophers—James, Dewey, and Peirce—wanted to do away with walls separating subjective values from objective facts. For Americans the external world retained a promise of ultimate goodness and harmony. (195-96)\n\nThis comment seems to put, for instance, J. B. Stallo’s The Concepts and Theories of Modern Physics (1882) as an isolated case, a not entirely Americanized idea that found its recognition with Ernst Mach, but it also frames Ostwald’s energism as an isolated case in the reverse, an American-style idea in Germany, recognized in the United States: energism did not question the external world but questioned substantialism, and positioned energy transformation as the fabric of the universe. In this way, the experience itself, the energetic confrontation between sense organ and stimulus, was part of the fabric of the universe. This kind of chemistry was voluntarist and vitalist, and this would explain why energism was popular with American philosophers.\n\nAn important component of the new spirit of the 1890s was the rediscovery of nature, particularly by the urban middle class: the two most cherished components of this rediscovery were “spaciousness” and “virility” associated with Western landscapes (Higham 179). This is one of the central themes in Marx’s Machine in the Garden, especially in the introductory remarks on the afterlife of the pastoral ideal in the twentieth century (9-11). It was not any nature that was cherished; it was about the kind of rough and fresh nature experienced by tourists in the great outdoors. In practical terms, people were attracted to outdoor sports, nature tourism, and the creation of national parks (Higham 180). But intellectually, Higham argues, this tendency found its expression in nature writing, and in enthusiastic assessments of the frontier spirit in fiction and historiography; Higham lists Frederick Jackson Turner as a model representative of the new dynamism among American intellectuals (181).\n\nFor Herrick, if not for all four authors, exploration and violence in the American West can be interpreted as the “structuring metaphor” (Slotkin 5) of scientific endeavor: it was a struggle that formed and regenerated the individual experience of the observer. This is comparable to a passage from Hamilton Wright Mabie’s essay, quoted by Higham: “We fly to Nature, and are led away from all thought of ourselves. We escape out of the individual into universal life; we bathe in the healing waters of an illimitable ocean of vitality” (196). When Boodin argues for an external reality, he defines reality in terms of various force-fields, mutually defining one another by confrontation: the act of measuring a force is a form of struggle against another force, a competitive activity, which generated the world perceived by human beings (themselves also forces, taking part in the activity). Similarly, when Herrick writes about “psychs” as the ultimate units of measurement, he refers to the experience of strain and effort and can be directly related to the contemporary American praise for physical effort in the great outdoors, particularly on the American frontier. Slosson’s voice, probably because he wrote later, was more skeptical and cautious, not directly relatable to the popular dynamism of the 1890s.\n\nThe intriguing quality of the early phase of energism was that while it was explicitly a research project in natural sciences, it was also a research project in psychology and philosophy. If it had worked, it would demonstrate that the cherished individualist energy, known from American non-scientific discourse, was identical with the various types of energy known from natural science, and identical with matter, and thus subjectivity would turn out to be identical with the world at large in general. This approach seemed to offer a new degree of dynamic freedom in science but was also compatible with the American cultural dynamism of the 1890s, as described by Higham. Perhaps its most appealing quality was that energism promised to combine the description of matter, energy, and of subjective mental activity, into a single, monistic approach. Among other things, some sort of fantastic, mental control over matter would be the ultimate goal of this new American science. Helge Kragh, in the conclusion of the article on vortex atom theory, invokes the idea by Imre Lakatos that history of science is made of research programs, most of which are abandoned as unproductive, impracticable, or difficult to adjust to empirical tests (112-14). When an unproductive program is not abandoned soon enough, it can degenerate into pseudoscience (Lakatos 137), which energism did not. Its brief American flourish is interesting historically, especially as it co-occurred with the final stages of the history of the American frontier."
