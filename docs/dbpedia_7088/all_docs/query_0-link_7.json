        "text": "This open access book shows how the politics of migration affect community building in the 21st century, drawing on both retrogressive and progressive forms of mobilization. It elaborates theoretically and shows empirically how the two master frames of nostalgia and hope are used in local, national and transnational settings, in and outside conventional forms of doing politics. It expands on polarized societal processes and external events relevant for the transformation of European welfare systems and the reproduction of national identities today. It evidences the importance of gender in the narrative use of the master frames of nostalgia and hope, either as an ideological tool for right-wing populist and extreme right retrogressive mobilization or as an essential element of progressive intersectional politics of hope.\n\nIn this report, our objective is to provide a snapshot of the current situation of the governance and management of migration in Hungary, the regulatory landscape, citing and reflecting on developments and events occurred between 2011 and 2018. Section 1) gives a statistical overview of international migration to Hungary. The data displayed shows the main patterns of asylum seeker flows, their recognition rates and the scale of people being expelled from the territory. Section 2) outlines the political, cultural and socio-economic context in which migration management enfolds. It briefly introduces the linguistic and religious cleavages and the political and institutional arrangements of the state. Without engaging in a thorough analysis, we will try to pin down those critical socio-economic and political factors that are accountable for the current escalation of tensions. In doing so, we move on to Section 3) that gives an insight on how the constitutional organization of the state has been altered and restructured over the past years, thus establishing an ideological, legal and institutional base for the transformation of the migration and asylum framework. Section 4) accounts for the legislative and institutional framework of immigration and asylum by introducing the major Acts that govern the field, the authorities that are responsible for the implementation of the policy, and the Government’s migration strategy. Since the recent developments fundamentally changed the scope of the framework, now representing its basic tenets, instead of discussing the amendments in a separate section, the refugee crisis driven reforms will be embedded here. In chronological order we will address all major amendments since 2015 that affected the legislative framework. Section 5) explains the legal status of foreigners, including asylum applicants, beneficiaries of international protection, the main categories of third country nationals legally residing in the country in terms of the type of residence permit they hold, irregular migrants, and unaccompanied minors. In describing the situation of asylum seekers, we will outline the first main stages of the application procedure. Finally, in Section 6) we will analyse the national framework compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights based on the Court’s case law in relation to migration and asylum.\n\nThe coexistence between Hungarians and Islam has been considered balanced, until the spring of 2015 when a wave of migrants appeared in Europe. \"Opening to the East\", the foreign policy announced by the government in 2011 heralded a new chapter of cooperation with Arabic/Muslim countries, predominantly due to economic considerations. The migrant crisis turned government communication, as well as the stance of Jobbik, the largest opposition party, upside down. This paper discusses the unique phenomenon of what role the political debate about Islam and the construction of the temporary border barrier protecting the Hungarian national borders played in the competitive communication of the national-radical, pro-Muslim opposition Jobbik party (achieving a lead in the polls) and the centre-right governing parties Fidesz-KDNP which typically emphasise their Christian character.\n\nBased on empirical research conducted in Hungary and Poland in 2016–2017, as well as on analysis of social media, blogs and newspaper articles, this article discusses Hungarian and Polish attitudes towards Muslims and Islam. Against a historical background, we analyse how the Hungarian and Polish governments responded to the large-scale influx of Muslim refugees during the 2015 'migration crisis'. The anti-immigrant narratives, fueled by both governments and the right-wing press, resulted in something akin to Islamophobia without Muslims. Instead of portraying the people arriving at the southern border of Europe as refugees seeking safety, they described the migration process in terms such as 'raid', 'conquest' and 'penetration'. These narratives often implied that Muslims will combat Europe not only with terrorism but with the uteruses of their women, who will bear enough children to outnumber native Poles and Hungarians. The paper ends with a discussion of positive attempts to improve attitudes towards refugees in Poland and Hungary.\n\nThe Turkish candidacy for European Union (EU) membership is, in many respects, unique. Having been granted the status of a candidate country in 1999 and having begun accession negotiations in 2005, Turkey finds itself further apart from the EU than at any point in the last dozen years. Only one chapter has been provisionally closed, many more are frozen and the prospect of more opening is very remote. In fact, the possibility of a full suspension of negotiations is very real, as recommended by the European Parliament (EP) and as endorsed by certain member-states. This chapter examines the migration and refugee crisis, as well as its aftermath, in light of EU-Turkey relations. It starts off by providing a context to the crisis by discussing the state of play in EU-Turkey relations by 2015 and the series of challenges the two sides were facing at the time. It then moves on to analyse the content of the EU-Turkey migration deal and its aftermath to date. The next section is devoted to an analysis of the state of play and sets out the chapter’s main argument. Although the deal is surviving waves of deterioration in bilateral affairs, it is also indicative of a new, transactional approach in EU-Turkey relations, whereby Turkey becomes a valuable partner for the Union on issues of joint interest (especially those with serious domestic repercussions in EU member states) but is progressively removed from the circle of potential accession states and thus relegated to an EU ‘partner’ on an ad hoc basis. The chapter concludes by discussing the repercussions of the new state of EU-Turkey affairs for both sides.\n\nThe Hungarian solution to migration is a policy package consisting of three elements: selective closure of borders, series of deterrents, and governmental xenophobic discourse and propaganda campaigns.This policy package is legiti- mized by the Hungarian government’s strategic self-positioning as the “frontier of Europe.”This position is enabled by interwoven moral divides of the European space: the east/west and the Europe/Balkans. At the same time, the Hungarian solution is anchored to a series of domestic political manoeuvres that advance a hegemonic discourse of citizenship and attempt to exclude domestic, margina- lized populations from the public sphere. In order to understand the Hungarian government’s punitive approach to migration, its policy needs to be examined in the domestic context, on the one hand, and in relation to those European moral hierarchies that are used to legitimize these policies, on the other. This article is a contribution to discussion on the dynamics of European peripheries in relation to migration and location.\n\nThis report gives an overview of the major developments of the Hungarian border and migration control policy, the subsequent practices and dominant political narratives focusing mainly, but not exclusively, on the past five-year period. It will discuss the role of actors involved in migration governance, the cooperation among them and with international stakeholders. In terms of sources, the report relies on the relevant academic literature, legislation, policy reports, research reports and reviews by NGOs and EU institutions, as well as qualitative interviews conducted with public and third sector stakeholders. The qualitative content analysis predominantly draws on the Prime Minister’s speeches on themes related to borders, migration, security, and the future of Europe available at the Prime Minister’s Office website. Key findings include: - The major emphasis of the Hungarian pre-entry policy has been on the facilitation of kin-state politics and the so-called “Eastern Opening” (Keleti Nyitás) Programme; - The border control regime has been significantly reinforced since 2015 coupled with an extensive deployment of police and military personnel; - The Hungarian border and migration management’s sole aim has been to prevent irregular migrants from entering the country irrespective of their protection needs; - The implemented policy and the applied measures are often at variance with, and depart from Hungary’s human rights obligations; - The Hungarian political discourse is overwhelmed by security-focused narratives with a total lack of solidarity towards asylum seekers; - The cooperation between civil society organisations and the government is nonexistent; NGOs involved in migration management face criminal liability."
