The border crossing point may be used by citizens of the two countries in accordance with regulations on local border traffic. “Thanks to persistent lobbying on the part of my fellow Member of Parliament László Tasó, people living in the area will no longer have to make a long detour if they would like to cross to the other side of the border”, Mr. Szijjártó indicated."
