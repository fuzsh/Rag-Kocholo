        "text": "The Csapókerti Neighborhood Day was not organized due to COVID-19 in 2020, but the event was organized this year. There are many associations and organizations in the district that are happy to take part in community events.\n\nAt the opening of the neighborhood day, Mayor László Papp said that one of the best news was that people could meet in person again. The other one was that the renovation of the Csapókerti Community House could start this year; therefore, the building will be closed in mid-October.\n\nWe are now working to ensure that the NGOs operating here and the Főnix Néptáncegyüttes (Phoenix Folk Dance Ensemble) are properly accommodated during the transition period. The work will start in November, and we would like to hand over the renovated and refurbished Csapókerti Community House in a year’s time, the mayor said.\n\nMember of Parliament László Tasó emphasized the need for such gatherings. The role of community life is essential for which well-functioning NGOs are needed.\n\nThere are many non-governmental associations (NGOs) in this area, and they represent a value, the lack of which would weaken the self-awareness of the Hungarians, so they must be taken care of, and a good example must always be presented to others, Tasó said.\n\nThe Csapókerti Neighborhood Day was held for the 16th time this year.\n\nSource: dehir.hu"
