One of his main results in the area concerns the convexity theory of probabilistically constrained stochastic optimization problems. He introduced the concept of logarithmic concave measures and provided several fundamental theorems on logconcavity, which supplied proofs for the convexity of a wide class of probabilistically constrained stochastic programming problems. These results had impact far beyond the area of mathematical programming, as they found applications in physics, economics, statistics, convex geometry and other fields.\n\nSándor Arnóth\n\nBorn in\n\nHungary\n\nYears\n\n1960-2011 (aged 51)\n\nEnrolled in the University of Debrecen\n\nStudied in 1987\n\nOccupations\n\npoliticianhistorian\n\nBiography\n\nSándor Arnóth was a Hungarian politician and member of the National Assembly of Hungary between 1998 and 2006, in 2008 and from 2010 until his death.
