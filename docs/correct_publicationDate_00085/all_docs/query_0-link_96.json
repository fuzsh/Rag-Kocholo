Reaching readers from around the world, he’s hugely influential, making a name for himself as an author with a lot to say. Giving his work depth, he elevates the form, saying something important in the process, all while entertaining his audience. This unique formula of his has proven to be enormously successful, making him an extremely popular household name for many.\n\nUsing genres such as science-fiction and fantasy to explore deeper themes and ideas, he really pushes the boundaries. Taking his stories in new and interesting directions, he leaves the reader constantly wondering what’s coming next. With countless twists and turns, he keeps them glued to the page, as there are new and exciting surprises with each and every page turn. Winning awards for his work, he’s also written for television, reaching a huge audience worldwide, with popular shows such as Stargate.\n\nAlso writing for blockbuster franchises, Steven Barnes has produced novels for Star Wars, proving to be a highly adept novelist. He’s a gifted author when it comes to creating characters as well, allowing his work to really come to life upon the page. Each of his protagonists has their own voice, speaking to the reader in a manner that is wholly believable and authentic. With plenty more to come yet, he isn’t going to be finishing his literary career soon either, as there are lots more planned.\n\nEarly and Personal Life\n\nBorn in Los Angeles, California, on the 1st of March in 1952, growing up with a keen interest in writing and genre fiction. Attending Los Angeles High School, he would go on to graduate from Pepperdine University, where he would major in Communication Arts. Developing his craft as a writer, he would come to hone and refine his voice during this time, shaping his style as it’s known today.\n\nPrior to writing novels full-time, he would work in writing television, something which he would continue over time. Working on shows such as ‘The Outer Limits’ and ‘Baywatch,’ he would gain a strong insight into writing for large mass audiences. Married to fellow writer Tananarive Due, he continues to write while teaching a course from UCLA with his wife and hosting a blog together.\n\nWriting Career\n\nPublishing his first piece of fiction back in 1979, Steven Barnes would begin his literary career with the novelette ‘The Locusts.’ Nominated for a Hugo Award, it was written alongside fellow author Larry Niven, really making a name for Barnes as a writer himself. He’s also written various other books with Niven too, as well as writing with Jerry Pournelle, overcoming differences of opinion along the way.\n\nBarnes would later receive an award for ‘Lion’s Blood’ in 2003, gaining the Endeavour Award, while his Star Wars novel became a bestseller. Making its way on to The New York Times bestseller list reaching the top, The Cestus Deception would see him reach a mass-audience worldwide fast. Also working with his wife Tananarive Due, he’s created a vast body of work both on and off-screen, establishing him one of the most sought after names working within the industry.\n\nThe Cestus Deception\n\nInitially released on the 1st of January in 2004, this would first arrive through the Arrow Books publishing imprint. Further building upon the Star Wars universe, this would be the third book in the ‘Star Wars: Clone Wars’ series of books. Written alongside fellow authors, a collection of writers would contribute to the series, each with their own unique inclusion into the collection.\n\nSending an envoy to Ord Cestus led by the famed Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine hopes to prevent the sale of bio-droids there. While they hope to persuade the Confederacy there, there’s also a chance to stir up the underclass, while their backup plan consists of a full-scale attack by the Republic if all else fails. This plan doesn’t sit right with Obi-Wan, as he begins to suspect the Republic may be moving in dark path, as he hopes to put a stop to the potential bloodbath. Will he manage to prevent the slaughter from taking place, can he successfully manage the negotiations, and what will become of the Cestus Deception?\n\nAs a Star Wars novel, this really makes the most of the franchise, drawing upon its many elements, creating an intriguing and intelligent story. The book itself is a great story for both fans of the franchise and newcomers alike, with its entirely self-contained narrative. Many people will already be aware of where the story is moving, but it still makes sure not to leave anybody behind or lose readers.\n\nLion’s Blood\n\nFirst brought out back in 2002 through the ‘Mysterious Press’ publishing outlet, this would first arrive on the 13th of February. It would also provide the first part of the ‘Lion’s Blood’ series, paving the way for the follow-up book ‘Zulu Heart’ to come out in 2003. The book itself can be read by itself as an entirely stand-alone title, as it’s not a part of any overall series, being easily accessible.\n\nTaking place in the year 1863, this sees a primitive village being raided, as the women and children are captured, with the survivors being sold into slavery. Crossing the ocean to the New World, an eleven-year-old Irish boy named Aidan O’Dere is sold into slavery on a Southern plantation. In this alternate vision of America, the south is owned by black Africans, while the North is run by Vikings, as they sell Franks and Celts to the Southerners. It’s here that this alternative view of American slavery brings to light the many injustices of what really happened in ‘Lion’s Blood.’\n\nProviding another view of American slavery, this casts a light on what actually happened by asking some larger questions. With its intriguing narrative and engaging characters, it really manages to bring to world to life, while not shying away from more difficult subject matter. The premise itself really is an interesting one, and this book definitely makes the most of it for the entire duration of the novel."
