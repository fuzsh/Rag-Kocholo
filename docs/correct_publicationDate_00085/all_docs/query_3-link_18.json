In that time, a new generation has grown up in the peace and serenity of the island paradise of Camelot, ignorant of the Great Grendel Wars fought between their parents and grandparents and the monstrous inhabitants of Avalon.<p>Now, under the influence of a charismatic leader, a group of young rebels makes for the mainland, intent on establishing their own colony, sure that they can vanquish any foe that should stand in their way.<p>But they will soon discover that Avalon holds darker secrets still.<p>At the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (Digital Rights Management).",
