        "text": "for other topics click a “category” on the right\n\nTwo children’s versions of “Beowulf” have been published: “Beowulf”, adapted and illustrated by Gareth Hinds (Candlewick Press, ages 10 and up); and “Beowulf: A Hero’s Tale Retold”, adapted and illustrated by James Rumford (Houghton Mifflin, ages 9-12).\n\nBeowulf is a 3,000-line epic poem composed early in the eighth century; it is the first significant text written in English — or what eventually became English. (A bilingual edition, translated by Seamus Heaney in 2000 -FSG Publishers- won the Whitbread Award.)\n\nIt is the elegiac narrative of the adventures of Beowulf, a Scandinavian hero who saves the Danes from the seemingly invincible monster Grendel and, later, from Grendel’s mother. He then returns to his own country and dies in old age in a vivid fight against a dragon.\n\nThe poem is about encountering the monstrous, defeating it, and then having to live in the exhausted aftermath.\n\nThere are not one but three monsters. Grendel is a man-eating monster who snacks nightly on sleeping Danes until Beowulf sails over from what is now Sweden and rips his arm off. Grendel’s mother, a fearsome swamp creature, is hell-bent on avenging her creepy son. The treasure-hoarding dragon was the inspiration for some of Tolkien’s winged worm-things.\n\nSo powerful and elemental is the tale that it has inspired countless re-tellings in movies, comic-books, cartoons, even an opera.\n\nGareth Hinds is a graphic novelist, and working from this tradition, has reimagined “Beowulf” as a kind of superhero tale. In this version Grendel bears some resemblance to the movie monster in the “Alien” movies. Beowulf, when he finally removes his robe for the fight with Grendel, could be Captain America or Green Arrow, ripped and massive.\n\nIn a NY Times review, Charles McGrath tells us that the narration, adapted from A J Church’s 1904 prose translation, “is sufficiently antique-sounding that it can pass for basic Olden-speak, the lingua-franca of so many fantasy novels these days.”\n\nBut long sections of the book take place in a languageless space, except for the occasional “SKUTCHLP”, “SMASH”, and “SSWACK”. There are great fight scenes, choreographed in the manner of a great kung-fu master, and drawn from a variety of vantage points, with close-ups, wide-angles and aerial views. It is, in its way, “as visceral as the Old English, which was consciously onomatopoeic, and by changing his palette for each of the poem’s three sections he evokes its darkening rhythm.”\n\n“Beowulf: A Hero’s Tale Retold”, will come out later in the summer (2007). It is quieter and more realistic than Hinds’s. Rumsford’s inked-in watercolors attentively depict domestic details of the Danish court (pets, houses, the pit by which the king sits). You learn more here from reading than from looking, however. The story has been adapted in a style that relies on Anglo-Saxon words, and is, according to McGrath, a not-bad approximation of the original; it should be easily comprehensible to a fourth- or fifth-grader as well.\n\nMcGrath refers to a version that has an “even better” text: “Beowulf” by Michael Morpurgo, out last year. Morpurgo, a distinguished British author of children’s books, preserves much of the strangeness and complexity of the original. Even though his text is in prose, it preserves some of its oddity as well. It’s also the clearest about Grendel’s motivation: “it drives him mad, eavesdropping at the banquet hall, that the Danes have the gift of telling stories.”\n\nsole source: NYT review by Charles McGrath on 6/19/07. “Beowulf”, adapted and illustrated by Gareth Hinds, is published by Candlewick Press and costs $9.98 in paper. “Beowulf: A Hero’s Tale”, adapted and illustrated by James Rumsford, will be published by Houghton Mifflin and will cost $17. “Beowulf: A New Translation by Seamus Heaney” (bilingual!), was published by FSG in 2000; $25 in hardcover at that time."
