        "text": "by Joshua Gray\n\nhttps://qarrtsiluni.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/gray-beowulf-podcast.mp3\n\nFor Zachary, whose fantasy world sent me on a quest of my own\n\nHere, let me tell you of the time Hrothgar,\n\nking of Denmark, built a hall in his castle.\n\nWhen it was complete, he named it Heorot.\n\nHeorot was a hall where the people in the palace\n\nate supper and then slept when it was time for bed.\n\nNearby there lived a beast who lurked in the dark.\n\nHe was called Grendel, and was grand and gruesome.\n\nGrendel abhorred Heorot (no one knows why);\n\none night he went to the hall, broke through a wall,\n\nand found many men to feast on. Grendel growled\n\nferocious and loud, and his red eyes glared in the dark.\n\nThe noise awoke all who slept in the hall\n\nand the knights were poised for battle. But the beast\n\nGrendel showed his horrible teeth and grabbed\n\nthe first knight he found and gnashed him\n\nwith one big bite. The monster roared\n\nand everyone ran, leaving Grendel loudly laughing\n\nas he went back to his lair where he soundly slept.\n\nThe monster managed to raid Heorot for eleven years.\n\nFinally it became clear King Hrothgar needed help\n\nkilling the beast in battle, because his warriors were dying\n\none by one in this gruesome Grendel War. The Danes\n\nprayed to the gods to keep the monster from preying on them.\n\nTheir prayers were answered when a ship sailed to their shores.\n\nBeowulf was aboard the boat, and he came from across the sea\n\nto help Hrothgar from the terror of Grendel’s teeth. Beowulf\n\nannounced himself to Hrothgar, and the King welcomed him\n\nwith open arms. Hrothgar fed his guest a feast in his hall,\n\nand Beowulf announced he planned to fight Grendel with his fists.\n\nUnferth, Hrothgar’s bravest knight, questioned Beowulf’s skill.\n\nUnferth asked, “Are you the legendary Beowulf, who took part\n\nin a swimming contest with a friend in the ocean? As I have heard\n\nthe story, you both challenged each other and the sea for seven nights,\n\nswimming as far out as you could, beating the cold and angry waves,\n\nbut in the end your friend won the race, you fell behind humiliated.”\n\nBeowulf bawked. “You’re right brave Unferth, I am that Beowulf.\n\nBut you have heard wrong. For five days and nights\n\nwe swam shoulder to shoulder against those cold and angry waves.\n\nI was pulled under by a sea-monster. Armed with a sword,\n\nI killed the sea-monster and eight others after it. It was a hard fight\n\nunder water with those terrible beasts, and I was weakened\n\nbut I swam to the surface and made it to the other shore.\n\nNot since my fight with the sea-monsters have my people perished\n\nat the mouths of them. I lost, but I was honored, not humiliated.”\n\nWhen the feast was over, it was bedtime for the brave\n\nBeowulf. He laid in bed awake, waiting for Grendel to strike.\n\nGrendel stormed through the stone wall, grabbed\n\na startled soldier with his cruel claws and bit him to the bone.\n\nThe monster moved toward Beowulf, and lifted him\n\nout of bed. But before the beast could open its mouth,\n\nBeowulf put Grendel in an arm lock no man or beast\n\nhad ever witnessed, and the monster let out a horrible howl.\n\nThe two tumbled about the hall until the sound of the scream\n\nfrom the loser lifted everyone out of their beds. The monster\n\nhad been manacled from a man stronger than him,\n\nand the beast ran recklessly back to his den to die.\n\nGrendel’s arm was torn off by Beowulf’s grasp and\n\nhe could not live much longer. Beowulf picked the arm off\n\nthe floor, evidence of the fight, and stood among his men victorious.\n\nThe next day word got around that the beast had been beaten\n\nby Beowulf. The damaged wall in the hall was repaired,\n\nand Hrothgar gave Beowulf gifts for his courage.\n\nA victory feast was served for supper, and everyone\n\nwas the happiest they’d been since Grendel started\n\nrunning his raids. That night as they settled in for sleep,\n\nit felt great to not worry about Grendel again.\n\nBeowulf went to bed elsewhere. But as soon as\n\neveryone was asleep and silence swept the night,\n\na second terror lurked in the moonlight. Grendel’s mother\n\nhad come to Heorot to avenge her son’s death.\n\nShe was just as gruesome as Grendel. The sleeping were startled\n\nawake, and they all went for their swords. Grendel’s mother\n\nkilled a counselor, Hrothgar’s right-hand man. She grabbed\n\nGrendel’s arm, gave an angry growl, and disappeared.\n\nAfter her attack, Beowulf was brought to Hrothgar’s hall.\n\nThe crowd in the castle knew Grendel’s mother\n\nlived under the mere, so Beowulf decided to go to her instead\n\nof waiting for her to come back to him. He brought a boat\n\nto the wet mere, even though the waters were infested\n\nwith all sorts of beasts. He took a crew with him, and\n\non their way, through the dark moor, they found her footprints,\n\nand followed them to the water. In the water and on the rocks\n\nthey found reptiles of all kinds: they found snakes and sea-dragons,\n\nmonsters and wild things. They waded through them\n\nto where Grendel’s mother lived below the waters.\n\nBeowulf wore a wet suit and prepared for battle.\n\nA special sword was given to him by Hrothgar’s men,\n\nand he placed it in his holster. Beowulf told the men\n\nto wait for him; he would be back victorious. With that,\n\nhe dove into the deep waters, and descended to the monster’s den.\n\nGrendel’s mother sensed Beowulf approaching.\n\nShe waited for him, hungry. When he came close,\n\nshe captured him and dragged him down to her den.\n\nBeowulf searched for the special sword,\n\nheaved it out of his holster, and struck his opponent.\n\nBut the sword failed to do damage. The blade broke\n\noff the handle and Beowulf was left using his two bare\n\nhands. He attempted another arm lock, but the beast’s\n\nstrength was too brutal. Beowulf managed to break free,\n\nand fought bare-handed against the furry beast. But Beowulf’s\n\nbare hands were no match for the monster’s might.\n\nAnd for a moment he thought he had lost. Right then,\n\nBeowulf saw a mighty weapon, a sword of some sort,\n\nhanging on the cave wall, glistening with gold.\n\nHe raised the heavy sword and with one swift blow\n\nBeowulf killed the beast. As he stopped to rest, he realized\n\nGrendel himself laid in the lair, lifeless. His arm\n\nwas placed neatly next to him by his mother. Beowulf\n\ngrabbed Grendel’s arm, and swam back to the surface\n\nof the water, leaving his special sword in the lair.\n\nBeowulf returned to Hrothgar and told the king Heorot\n\nwas free once again of those monsters in the night.\n\nHrothgar thanked Beowulf, praised his strength\n\nand courage, but warned him that his strength and courage\n\ncould also endanger his life. “Do not give way to pride,”\n\nsaid Hrothgar to Beowulf, “your strength is in bloom,\n\nbut blossoms only a short while. Grendel was king\n\nof this country for eleven years, even though\n\nI wore the crown, because I didn’t bring my pride to battle\n\nagainst him. I knew better. I laid low instead, and prayed\n\nfor someone with courage to fight him. The day you arrived\n\non my shores I knew my prayers were answered.\n\nI say this because you are fit to be King, and will be, someday.”\n\nBeowulf thanked him for the fatherly advice, and told him\n\nit was time to sail the seas again, to go back home.\n\nHe gathered his men, prepared his ship, and said goodbye\n\nto Hrothgar and Heorot. When Beowulf and his ship arrived\n\nat shore, he was welcomed at once by his Uncle Hygelac.\n\nHygelac was king of this country, ruler of the Geats.\n\nHe ruled the Geats well, and years later when Hygelac\n\ndied of old age, Beowulf himself became king.\n\nFor fifty years Beowulf ruled his kingdom well,\n\nbut in his old age, Beowulf was faced with another terror\n\nof the night. A dragon, which lived in a cave on a nearby cliff,\n\nawoke angry, because someone came into his cave\n\nwhile he soundly slept, and stole some treasure\n\noff his treasure pile. It happened not once, but twice.\n\nThe dragon found footprints the second time,\n\nand he flew over the kingdom like a living torch,\n\nburning buildings down to their bones.\n\nBeowulf believed the dragon performed these deeds\n\nbecause of something he had done. So the king\n\ndecided to fight the dragon himself. He gathered\n\nan army of men and made for the cave, the dragon’s den.\n\nWith his men waiting outside, Beowulf entered\n\nthe cave and called for the dragon, who responded\n\nwith a breath of fire. Beowulf, the old king,\n\nraised his shield and sword and the two battled.\n\nThe heat inside the cave made it hard for the old king\n\nto focus. He stabbed the dragon’s scales with his sword,\n\nand the dragon cried in pain. But the puncture\n\nwasn’t deep enough, and it upset the dragon even more.\n\nOutside the army heard its cry, and all but one ran\n\nfor safety. Only Wiglaf ran inside the cave to help\n\nBeowulf, who was fighting without his sword.\n\nThe dragon turned and sunk its teeth into Beowulf’s neck.\n\nThe dragon focused on Beowulf so the battle was easier\n\nfor young and strong Wiglaf, who gave the dragon\n\na deadly blow. The dragon cried in pain once again,\n\nblew his last fiery breath, and fell hard on the floor.\n\nWiglaf ran to Beowulf’s aid, and attempted to treat his wound.\n\n“Wiglaf,” said Beowulf, “bring me some treasure, so I can see\n\nwhat I’ve been fighting for.” Wiglaf ran around the fallen dragon,\n\nand fetched a piece of treasure, something simple he could carry.\n\nBeowulf’s eyes fell on it. “Ah,” he said, “Wiglaf, I name you\n\nthe new king of the Geats, you have shown your courage. I will die\n\nof my wound.” And soon, the old king closed his eyes,\n\nbreathed his last breath, and peacefully passed away.\n\nDownload the podcast"
