We are very grateful as well to Suzanne Rancourt at the University of Toronto Press for her encouraging belief in this book’s worth throughout its long development. Britt would like to thank his colleagues at Texas A&M, especially Claudia Nelson, the students in his Beowulf’s Afterlives graduate and undergraduate seminars, and all participants in the Medieval Studies Working Group and the Critical Child Studies Working Group. Thank you also to Ruby Perry-Mize for being an actual child – and one willing to provide incisive commentary on many, many youth versions of Beowulf. Generous support for this project has been provided by Stanford Text Technologies, and by Texas A&M University through its Department of English and the Melbern G. Glasscock Center for Humanities Research. Bruce wishes to acknowledge foremost Anna Smol, whose 1994 essay, “Heroic Ideology and the Children’s Beowulf,” is the first serious critical appraisal of the breadth and cultural work of adaptations of the poem for children. Her research of the holdings at the Osborne Collection of Early Children’s Books at the Toronto Public Library proves how vital archives of physical books are for understanding our reception of the past. Following her work, I then built my own collection, which was happily shared with my son Oscar in a great many bedtime readings of Grendel stealing towards Heorot and the dragon being pushed into the ocean. I also must acknowledge the extraordinary patience of our chapter contributors on the lengthy whale-road to publication, and, most deeply, my co-editor, Britt Mize, for his quietly compelling this book into the world with persistence and grace.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nBEOWULF AS CHILDREN’S LITERATURE\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nIntroduction: Beowulf in and near Children’s Literature britt mize\n\nRecycling Beowulf is a booming business, in output if not always in commercial or aesthetic profit. At least eleven feature-length films have been Beowulf-themed, with more doubtful claims made for others. There are dozens of songs and musical compositions, many original poetic treatments, a slew of novels and shorter fiction (including representatives of the sci-fi, cyberpunk, and fantasy genres), around twenty graphic novel or comics versions, several video games, and three published board games.1 But the single largest category of Beowulf representation and adaptation, outside of direct translation of the poem into modern languages, is children’s literature: as Bruce Gilchrist’s bibliography in this volume attests, Beowulf has been remade for the consumption of young readers well over a hundred times in English alone. Almost from the moment the Old English epic found its way into print for adults, adults have been refashioning it for youth, first in Danish, then in English and German, and more recently in Afrikaans, Chinese, Dutch, French, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Slovenian, Spanish, and Swedish, to give a partial list.2 This essay collection examines the history and processes of remaking Beowulf for young readers. For greatest coherence we focus on the mainstay forms of children’s literature – picture books, illustrated storybooks, and youth novels – while certain other materials, like curricular aids, illustrated full translations of the poem, and songs, will enter discussion where they link closely to the historical and theoretical dimensions of bringing Beowulf to child audiences.3 Reworkings of Beowulf for children cover a full gamut of style and register. Some are graceful and sophisticated: Through the dark night a darker shape slid. A sinister figure shrithed down from the moors ... toward the timbered hall, huge and hairy and slightly stooping ... Then it grasped the great ring-handle and swung open\n\n4 Britt Mize the door, the mouth of Heorot ... Grendel saw the knot of sleeping warriors and his eyes shone with an unearthly light.4\n\nOthers come across as ponderously archaizing: Dead the monster sank to the ground, and Beowulf ... saw at his feet the lifeless carcase of his foe ... He strode thither, and, seizing the corpse by the hideous coiled locks, shore off the head to carry to earth again.5\n\nAnd a few embrace silliness: “Wow! Not the Beowulf? The winner of Best Warrior in West Denmark three years in a row?” marvelled the Dane. Beowulf smiled and buffed his nails on his chain-mail shirt. “Not the Beowulf who ... was named Most Gorgeous Geat by Midgard Maiden Magazine?” “’Tis I!” Beowulf struck a heroic pose.6\n\nEvery stylistic choice, every illustration program, every enveloping paratext reflects decision-making about what kind of work a new version of the story should do for (and upon) young readers, in particular times and places, situated within their ecologies of opportunity, ability, and desire. Do children’s presentations of Beowulf educate? Entertain? Awe? Invite young people into more grown-up discourses? Do they encourage curiosity and exploration? Promote fixed values? Teach systems of social relations that adults find agreeable? Do they address children as they are presumed already to be, or urge young people to aspire to something unattained? The answer to all of these questions is “yes” in a holistic view of the corpus, although the nature of the specific instance is always inflected by larger forces that shape adult investment: trajectories of nationalism; reforms in education like those in nineteenth-­century Denmark and the twentieth-century United States; epoch-making trends and events in popular literary culture like the Tolkien phenomenon and Heaney’s Beowulf translation. Nor has the production of children’s ­Beowulf engagements, though large in volume, had a constant rate, and its ebbs and flows prove that the motivation to make a youth adaptation in the first place is no less responsive to its social moment than are the strategies used in doing so. Every aspect of the practice of accommodating such a monument of traditional literary history to youth readers, both in its chronological rhythms and its methods, deserves serious investigation.\n\nIntroduction 5\n\nBut scholarly interest in children’s adaptations of canonical literature has not matched the market and library presence of such adaptations. As Anja Müller points out in her introduction to the only whole book dedicated to the remaking of venerated adult literature for younger readers, the studies that do exist have tended to focus narrowly on individual cases rather than taking up larger questions of theory and method.7 Yet adaptations of works originally intended for adults are hardly a negligible part of the landscape of children’s literature. Bookstores stock an ample selection, and the catalogues of most publishers of youth literature include some retellings of “classics,” if not a whole series of them. The disparity of production and public demand with critical acknowledgment could imply merely a prevailing scholarly opinion that the adaptation of adult literature does not normally result in high-quality children’s books. Such a view may also be joined with a valid scepticism, among thoughtful observers of cultural and educational paradigms, as to whether perpetuating an old-fashioned literary canon is a project children’s literature should invest in. I suspect, however, that another reason this area of study has not gained more traction is a perception that children’s adaptations of long-appreciated literature will be only subtractive and attenuating, instrumental in purpose, and therefore analytically uninteresting. Publishers reinforce such a perception when they stress the authority of the antecedent work and represent an adaptation of Beowulf, or the Iliad, or a Shakespeare play, as an uncoloured transmission of it. But even the most conservative retelling for a new audience requires imagination and creativity, inevitably endowing it with its own character; and the status of the resulting narrative as a new cultural object is all the more obvious when multimedia complexity is introduced through illustrations and other features of visual design. As to the instrumentality of children’s adaptations, if they are more instrumental than original children’s literature – which is not self-evident, although adaptations sometimes work less hard to conceal it – extratextual goals are themselves an eligible target of analysis, with paratexts and educational rhetoric furnishing evidence for crucial critical enquiry into what such works communicate and do. A few valuable articles on children’s ­Beowulf adaptations have appeared,8 and of course children’s literature as a genre, medievalism as an impulse, and adaptation as a practice each has its own vast critical literature; but this book is the first to bring together a group of scholars, and even some creators, of Beowulf reflexes for young audiences in order to address many of the most important issues of transmuting the Old English poem into textual and pictorial\n\n6 Britt Mize\n\nforms that appeal to children, past and present – and to the adults who in any era influence their access to literature.\n\n• Beowulf books for children represent a wide spectrum of material characteristics and quality of manufacture, with everything that the physical aspects of a codex imply about the social work of its text. At one extreme are cheaply produced, almost disposable paperbacks, such as might pass through many hands in a classroom set and be treated carelessly with little liability against a purchaser’s small expense.9 At the other are beautiful, richly illustrated large-format volumes good for savouring with family members in a peaceful domestic setting, or else in privacy: books designed for a lap or a clean, uncluttered table.10 These books’ material features encourage a reader to treasure them and to seek again and again the captivating sensory experiences they offer, much like objet d’art presentations of Beowulf made for adults.11 Free-standing Beowulf presentations of this type project around themselves an idealization of social space implying affluence and tranquillity, a message for the parents and librarians who buy them as much as for any child readers. Inclusion of the Beowulf story in larger literary bundles, like anthologies and subscription series for children, has also been frequent for more than a century, making its incorporation into superstructures of cultural value an explicit part of its physical and conceptual presence for young readers. Here, variety in material presentation is less an indication of difference in anticipated use than an effort to assert B ­ eowulf’s importance through marketplace channels that allow different levels of expenditure on books. Among the home libraries that might be acquired as sets or serially, for example, the magazine-like Books for the Bairns (“price one penny” for issue 51, containing “The Story of Beowulf”) stand alongside the luxurious tomes of Journeys through Bookland.12 Single-volume anthologies for home or school that include a version of Beowulf have a similar canon-making and -sustaining effect, in that they present the story as part of a fabric of institutionally endorsed culture, dissociation from which is resisted by its integration with other works of recognized literary status.13 Material format and physical context thus carry messages about ­Beowulf, but the retellings the books embody also carry messages about the world and others in it. Words and pictures can powerfully attract young readers to templates for perception of what is normal, good,\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nor admirable; what factors appropriately define groups; what roles within and outside of one’s own group should be sought; and what social structures ensure that the right types of people thrive. Such messages, though designed for children, often must first speak successfully to adults with their own preformed beliefs about not only these matters, but also about what children should encounter or are capable of understanding. Thus children’s books inherently have an ideological dimension, one that is difficult to analyse without simultaneous acknowledgment of the genre’s didactic involvements. These involvements may be official (as in educational settings) or unofficial, and they may either affirm or challenge systemic lines of force like beliefs about ontological inequality, assumptions about gender identity and roles, and perceptual cues to cooperation, sympathy, or antagonism.14 This collection was nearing its final form when the long entanglement of medieval studies as a discipline (just as much as creative medievalism) with histories of personal and institutional racism became a foregrounded issue to many academics who until recently were comfortable referring to themselves as “Anglo-Saxonists.”15 Those discussions, and the shifts in perspective that they have prompted, speak broadly to the importance of this book’s subject matter, given the textual and visual power of children’s literature to contribute to the formation of categorical perceptions. Supposed racial histories implied or sometimes directly traced by paratexts are frequent in children’s versions of Beowulf, especially from the nineteenth and earlier twentieth centuries. In images, the more human the hero’s adversaries are made to appear, the more their monstrosity is expressed visually as something like racialization. Both phenomena are less common now than they once were in children’s literature, but recent books are not devoid of racially loaded assertions to child readers that Beowulf represents their own people’s heritage – meaning the heritage of white English or Northern European people, extended to other regions through colonial settlement. A fully theorized, historicizing study of race and racism in Beowulf adaptations for children remains to be written; several of the essays here will join previously published scholarship in laying crucial groundwork for that endeavour, revealing much about specific moments and movements in the long history of claimed ownership through presumed racial heritage.16 Ideological messages, like other attributes of children’s books, are tuned to the anticipated age and experiences of the readership. Only one reformulation of Beowulf for the extremely young has yet appeared17 – even John Green’s colouring book is not for preschoolers, with its closely drawn lines and detailed captions18 – but a handful of\n\n8 Britt Mize\n\nversions seem designed for children in the lower grades of primary school to enjoy.19 Retellings for higher primary or middle-grades audiences abound, some of them keeping a storybook-like format and a continuous program of artwork but pairing this visual elaboration with text appropriate to fairly advanced readers, and others for the same age groups novelizing the narrative in unillustrated or little-illustrated formats. Of course, the generalized correlation of age and reading ability used by educational entities and book publishers is far from absolute. For readers who follow a presumptive path towards high proficiency as they mature, “children’s literature” shades into simply “literature,” with a transition zone of books that were not conceived primarily for pre-adult readers but might either attract their interest (with enticements like Leonard Baskin’s pictures accompanying Burton Raffel’s full translation of Beowulf), or else might be put into their hands institutionally (like translation extracts in high school readers, or John Gardner’s Grendel, used in some college-preparatory English classes).20 Some adapters of Beowulf consider precisely the developmental position of readers who are moving out of childhood, or contemplate a readership whose age, abilities, and experience may mix elements regarded as typical of “childhood” and “adulthood.” In the preface to his Beowulf: A New Verse Translation for Fireside and Classroom, William Ellery Leonard states that he intends it for “mainly the first two years of college, but without embarrassing, I hope, the needs of the high school or even the junior high school,” and signals which parts of the text he considers less suitable for the younger segments of his audience: “Presumably the high school student should skip those portions ... which I have enclosed in brackets; and presumably the college student should attend to them.”21 Leonard marks for exclusion passages that lack linearity with the main narrative, such as the Finnsburh episode, sometimes explaining the reason for omission in the teacherly commentary he interjects between sections of the poem.22 My guess is that Leonard’s stilted diction and cumbersome couplets were always more forbidding to teenage readers than an embedded tale of revenge,23 but setting aside his specific judgments, his text is interesting in suggesting alternative realizations for an audience he imagines to span the boundary of childhood. Marney Worden’s unique and creative rendering of Beowulf, written entirely in short, basic sentences of a kind not often found in a pictureless book of 126 pages, is for audiences that she describes as “young” but also, more broadly, as “inexperienced” readers: That night there was a feast. King Hrothgar welcomed the coming of Beowulf and his men.\n\nIntroduction 9 Everybody came. There was wine to drink. There was deer meat to eat – with fish and rabbit, too.24\n\nAmy Hager extols simplicity, identifying it as something she herself has longed for in the Beowulf story, and makes it the guiding principle of her unillustrated retelling, never stating that she has a youth audience in mind.25 Cases like these reward awareness of vagueness at the edges of “children’s literature” as a category. The genre’s boundaries can also be both defined and complicated by conventions of topical acceptability and the frankness with which socially delicate subject matter is treated. In this frame of reference, children’s literature verges into young adult (YA) literature, which caters to aspirational grown-ups at a stage of increasingly perceptive encounter with such issues as gender identity, sexual activity, chemical substance abuse, mental illness or disability, and mortality and grief. In YA literature so defined, non-incidental interactions with Beowulf are limited to A.E. Kaplan’s Grendel’s Guide to Love and War and The Boneless Mercies by April Genevieve Tucholke, two well-written novels that maturely address death, grief, trauma, and less prominently some of the other topics listed above.26 Several of the comic books and graphic novels that riff on Beowulf contain eroticized imagery, typically enmeshed with regressive gender politics or worse;27 most do not depart from the modes of titillation common to works in this media form marketed to young teen boys.28 Closer to what is usually understood as a YA treatment of sexuality is the Grimm Fairy Tales magazine’s Beowulf foray, in which Wulf, approximately college age, makes out with classmates at two academies for future heroes,29 and a couple of the graphic novels portray some kind of sexual contact overtly.30 But none of the Beowulf comics or graphic novels takes a nuanced approach to sex or any of the other potentially fraught topics that YA literature has proved capable of exploring. Something the few YA Beowulf novels and the more numerous graphic novels and comics have succeeded at, though, is owning their autonomy as reimaginings of the Old English poem or isolated components of it. A view of Beowulf as an open resource that a later creator may draw upon or manipulate freely is less common in works readily classified as children’s literature, which usually follow the poem’s main plot structure, even if elaborating greatly or exercising much freedom in the realization of characters and events. However, adaptational activity less constrained by the received story does exist among children’s books. Some novels for middle-grades audiences retain the contours of a portion of Beowulf while building around it a wider original narrative,\n\n10 Britt Mize\n\nor use the events of Beowulf as a background against which some other, foregrounded new story unfolds.31 Others, in an approach similar to that of the YA novels by Kaplan and Tucholke, detach certain threads or iconic elements from their connections in Beowulf to use as raw material for recombination and development according to wholly new creative visions.32 Such freedom brings up two major theoretical issues for a critic of engagements with Beowulf in children’s literature.33 First, radically inventive treatments strain at the boundaries of “adaptation” by many definitions of that term: when can a highly creative interaction with Beowulf still be considered a version of Beowulf, and when does it cease to be, notionally, “Beowulf” in a meaningful way? In this matter children’s works deriving from the poem are not separated from the larger field of Beowulf’s manifestations in popular culture, or from concerns of adaptation theory broadly. Preoccupation with naming does not seem helpful to me (is it Beowulf? is it an adaptation?); more useful is a critical focus on the activity of working from earlier materials to create new ones. Even the most fragmented and transformational appropriation of Beowulf for a young audience, if that appropriation can be recognized, is a legitimate part of the Old English poem’s cascading presence through the field of cultural productions for children and can be analysed as such.34 The other issue is endemic to children’s literature as a genre with its own social realities. Although informed literary critics have abandoned the belief that fidelity to the antecedent work is prerequisite to an adaptation’s quality or interest, the entanglement of children’s literature with education keeps the question of fidelity near the surface for many who create, publish, buy, or recommend children’s reworkings of canonical texts. The degree of commitment to fidelity by any of these adults rests on assumptions about the purpose of an adaptation for youth. If a children’s Beowulf is a surrogate for or representation of the Old English poem, much as a traditional translation might be, then a teacher, librarian, or parent is not unreasonable to hope that it tells approximately the same story. On the other hand, if it is solely for entertainment, whether it follows a thousand-year-old text matters little, and the character’s name might as well be “Beowulf” as anything else. Between these two possibilities lies the wish to provide young people with reading material they like that will stimulate the imagination, broaden interests, and encourage ongoing learning, and most Beowulf adaptations for children are designed to combine pleasure with intellectual enrichment in some proportion.35 At a theoretical level we know that “fidelity” is a red herring: any act of adaptation involves countless\n\nIntroduction 11\n\nchoices to privilege some aspects of the original for reproduction while sacrificing others. Remaking Beowulf for child readers amplifies that truth with the additional need for calibration not just to a modern audience, but to a young one, often in a mixed textual/pictorial format that demands profound creativity. Yet none of this changes the fact that reader judgments will be based on aesthetic appreciation blended with a desired sense (at least among many adults) that notional “Beowulf” has survived the transformation, and those judgments have stakes for all parties.\n\n• While each chapter that follows treats in some way both the development of Beowulf adaptation for children and the technical or conceptual nature of that adaptational activity, the essays are grouped by emphasis into a series more focused on history followed by a series more focused on method and message. The earliest stages of this history are elucidated by Mark Bradshaw Busbee and Renée Ward. Busbee examines in detail the first attempt to bring Beowulf to child audiences, N.F.S. Grundtvig’s Danish translation and its subsequent repackagings and derivations, taking account of Grundtvig’s many other writings on Beowulf and on educational theory. Never clearer than in this case is the entwinement of Beowulf as children’s literature with institutional goals: the initial failure of Grundtvig’s Bjowulfs Drape was reversed by its later prominence in the public schools he founded, where it entered the standard curriculum in the form of extracts and songs. For many decades Bjowulfs Drape influenced Danish national consciousness, and its echoes extended also to Germany (in the youth drama of Otto Bruder) and England (in J.R.R. Tolkien’s ideas about the poem). Ward identifies for the first time the earliest children’s adaptation of Beowulf in English – E.L. Hervey’s tale “The Fight with the Ogre,” in her 1873 book The Children of the Pear-Garden – which preceded by eight years the next documented version for English-speaking children. In a thorough consideration of Hervey’s treatment of the story, including its sources in Beowulf retellings meant for adults, Ward reveals the continuity of this children’s adaptation with adaptations more generally and with the literary and ideological tastes of Victorian England. The chapter concludes by presenting readers with a perplexing mystery of publication history to solve, one borne of an illustration in Hervey’s book.\n\n12 Britt Mize\n\nAmber Dunai and Carl Edlund Anderson look at important moments in the twentieth-century development of Beowulf engagements in books read by young people. J.R.R. Tolkien, who cared greatly about children’s reading but disdained the idea of literature for children, thought that authors should write so as to include young people in a general community of readers; Dunai measures Tolkien’s theory against his practice in several of his Beowulf-related writings. Working from Tolkien’s concept of “faërie” and his beliefs about the desirable narrative trajectory for stories fitting that category, Dunai finds that The Hobbit (popular among many audiences), the song “The Lay of Beowulf” (which Tolkien sang to his own children), and the story Sellic Spell (which never reached readers during Tolkien’s lifetime) reflect complexly the author’s philosophy of literature that is well suited for child and adult audiences alike. Anderson too focuses on the middle part of the twentieth century to identify the emergence of a new mode of interaction with Beowulf among children’s writers. He argues that during this era authors felt newly free to draw upon elements of Beowulf in ways not closely tethered to the Old English poem’s narrative. After surveying several examples that illustrate the difference he proposes between “retellings” and “reuses” of Beowulf, Anderson reads one of each type by the same author, Rosemary Sutcliff, as a closer study in this distinction. Sutcliff’s Beowulf: Dragon Slayer, a fairly conservative adaptation of Beowulf, is well known; less widely read now is her youth novel The Shield Ring, which (like Tolkien’s Hobbit) borrows from Beowulf and refracts elements of the poem creatively to integrate them into a new story. Anderson describes systematically for the first time the mid-century expansion of possibilities for Beowulf’s presence in literature for young audiences, coinciding with a period of dynamic change in both Beowulf adaptation more broadly and the history of children’s literature. Bruce Gilchrist’s chapter is the collection’s fulcrum between the historical emphasis of its first several chapters and the emphasis of the next several on matters of technique and theme. Gilchrist traces pictorial representation of female characters in Beowulf from Victorian times to the present, on the premise that illustration history constitutes its own record of emphasis, priorities, and flavouring of the story’s gender politics for child audiences. Sets of artistic choices, he shows, can group pictorial representations into four broad periods, each with its own patterns of implication about the presence and importance of regal women and Grendel’s mother. Gilchrist finds, perhaps surprisingly, that in visual art the trend has been to increasingly displace and de-emphasize\n\nIntroduction 13\n\nthe poem’s female figures despite some social and textual movements in the opposite direction. Janet Schrunk Ericksen’s topic, manipulations of perspective, complements Gilchrist’s study of pictures by examining narrative techniques used in the story’s telling to implicitly situate a reader with a specific vantage point on a scene. Ericksen selects Beowulf’s fight with Grendel’s mother as an especially informative episode, given that the poem’s isolation of the hero in that scene establishes an a priori limitation of perspectival options to which adapters must respond creatively. In a sampling of books for both younger and more advanced readers, Ericksen finds complex interplay among perspective, perceived risk, and probable audience sympathy in representations of a violent confrontation. My own essay proceeds from one of the major tenets of adaptation theory: that adaptation creates a fully dialogic relationship between the new work and its antecedent. This chapter analyses features of a recent Chinese children’s book, whose representation of Beowulf differs in some important ways from those familiar in the European/American tradition, to discover how its creators’ choices can prompt new perspectives on the Old English poem itself. Robert Stanton surveys the use in children’s Beowulf versions of a staple strategy in much children’s literature: the incorporation, narratively and pictorially, of animal characters in more and less anthropomorphic realizations. Working from the insights of critical animal studies, ­Stanton’s close analysis of several examples – including ones by Rudyard Kipling and “Dr. Seuss” (Theodor Seuss Geisel) that are not widely recognized as having Beowulf connections – sheds light on how the narrative and visual reimagining of Beowulf characters as animals relates to ideologies of humanness and power in the contexts of these works’ creation. Yvette Kisor examines the textual and graphic design features of several Beowulf versions that she argues are meant for the “new Tolkien generation”: an appellation by which Kisor refers to young people in the first decade of the 2000s whose aesthetics and tooth for medievalism were shaped in part by the CGI-enhanced Peter Jackson films adapting Tolkien’s fiction to the screen. Kisor links several Beowulf books to these films and the demographic group they were designed to attract. She suggests that the 2007 Robert Zemeckis Beowulf film, publicized in part through an “educational program” or “study guide” sent out to teachers, responded to the same demographic, but that unlike the books’ creators with their variously thoughtful efforts to stimulate learning and imagination, the film’s promoters took a much more exploitative view of schools and students.\n\n14 Britt Mize\n\nIn the penultimate chapter I interview author Rebecca Barnhouse and author and artist James Rumford, two accomplished creators of Beowulf engagements for child audiences.36 Barnhouse and Rumford both provide generous insight into their methods and goals in bringing Beowulf to children, and their comments return to many of the issues raised in the collection’s introduction and other chapters. Prior bibliographies of Beowulf-related materials are either spotty in their coverage of children’s books, being more focused on Beowulf scholarship,37 or are now outdated.38 The final chapter of this collection, Gilchrist’s cumulative bibliography of Beowulf books for children, gives the fullest documentation to date in one chronological listing. NOTES 1 Short treatments exist of single or small groups of works in these genres and media forms. At the larger scale, some of these materials have recently been or are now being studied in Veronika Traidl, Telling Tales about Beowulf: The Poem and the Films (Munich: Herbert Utz, 2016); Kathleen Forni, Beowulf’s Popular Afterlife in Literature, Comic Books, and Film (New York: Routledge, 2018); and an essay collection in progress, edited by David F. Johnson and Britt Mize. The Beowulf’s Afterlives Bibliographic Database (beowulf.dh.tamu.edu), made public in a pilot form in 2018, will eventually be the most complete record of Beowulf representations, versions, and adaptational engagements. 2 Not including the bilingual ramifications of Henriette Barkow, Beowulf, illus. Alan Down (London: Mantra Lingua, 2004), which pairs Barkow’s English version with a translation into any of seventeen languages (according to usa.mantralingua.com as of 15 August 2019). In the present collection, Mark Bradshaw Busbee studies the earliest Beowulf presentations for children, in Danish; Renée Ward identifies what now becomes the earliest known example in English; and my essay analyses perhaps the first monolingual Chinese Beowulf for children. 3 Less well represented types for young audiences include drama (e.g., David Calcutt, Beowulf: A Play Based on the Anglo-Saxon Epic Poem [Cheltenham, Gloucestershire: Nelson Thornes, 2001]), animated retellings (e.g., Yuri Kulakov, dir., Animated Epics: Beowulf [Bright Spark Productions, 1998]), a colouring book (John Green, Beowulf [Mineola, NY: Dover Publications, 2007]), and a recent series of stories written and illustrated by children (3EB [children of Canary Wharf College, Glenworth], Battles & Beasts: A Collection of Beowulf Stories [London: 3EB, 2018]). We do not attempt systematic treatment of comics and graphic novels – a media\n\nIntroduction 15\n\n4 5 6 7\n\n8\n\nform with its own genres and established critical discourse, and having a complex relationship to children’s literature per se – but examples will be mentioned from time to time, and those most clearly designed for child audiences are listed in Gilchrist’s bibliography of children’s versions.

The essays below by Janet Schrunk Ericksen, Robert Stanton, and Bruce Gilchrist address Beowulf adaptations’ inducements to children to see the story, and by extension the world, in particular ways. For many, the centrality of this issue emerged at the July–August 2019 conference of the International Society of Anglo-Saxonists (ISAS) in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where Adam Miyashiro delivered a keynote address entitled “Mythmaking the ‘Anglo-Saxon’: Settler Colonialism, White Supremacy, and Medieval Heritage Politics.” Earlier commentary on racism as a component of past and present fascination with the Middle Ages, of which there had been much especially in social media but also\n\nIntroduction 17 in topical conference sessions, had not been as universally acknowledged throughout the discipline. Ensuing discussions and an eventual vote resulted in the organization’s changing its name to the International Society for the Study of Early Medieval England (ISSEME) in late November 2019, shortly before this book’s submission in December. 16 Especially Mark Bradshaw Busbee’s chronicle of a Danish nationalist enterprise to popularize Beowulf, Renée Ward’s study of an early Victorian children’s Beowulf enmeshed with Orientalism, and Carl Edlund Anderson’s essay situating Rosemary Sutcliff’s Beowulf engagements within mid-century English longing for an idealized “Anglo-Saxon” past. See also Jaillant, “‘A Fine Old Tale of Adventure.’” 17 Melissa Niemann, Beowulf (Maricopa, AZ: Little Literary Classics, 2016). 18 For example: “Not long after, Grendel’s mother, a frightening fiend in her own right, arrived to take revenge for the death of her son. Seizing one of Hrothgar’s favourite warriors, she rushed back to her lair in the misty mere” (Green, Beowulf, 14). 19 E.g., Tessa Potter, Beowulf and the Dragon, illus. Simon Noyes (Crystal Lake, IL: 1996); Patten, Beowulf and the Monster; Eric A. Kimmel, The Hero Beowulf, illus. Leonard Everett Fisher (New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2005). 20 Raffel, trans., Beowulf, illus. Leonard Baskin (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1971); Gardner, Grendel, illus. Emil Antonucci (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1971). Gilchrist’s chapter on illustrations of Beowulf includes works such as Raffel’s alongside books designed for children. Amber Dunai’s essay below scrutinizes J.R.R. Tolkien’s blurring of the category of children’s literature in relation to his own Beowulf-related creative works. 21 Leonard, Beowulf: A New Verse Translation for Fireside and Classroom (New York: Century, 1923); quotations from pp. v and v–vi. 22 In one such headnote Leonard writes of the Finnsburh tale that “many wise men of today have striven to puzzle it out ... but ... they despise one another grievously for their differences of opinion. Now ... I suggest that we don’t listen to ‘The Woe of Hildeburh’ at all – lest we too fall to quarreling over its meaning” (47–8). He prompts readers to skip instead to his translation of The Fight at Finnsburh, which follows Beowulf as an appendix. 23 The greater longevity of Leonard’s translation has been with adult audiences, for whom it was reset twice in deluxe illustrated formats: Leonard, Beowulf, illus. Rockwell Kent (New York: Random House, 1932); and Leonard, Beowulf, illus. Lynd Ward (New York: Heritage Press, 1939). Oddly, both include the brackets but not the preface explaining their presence, and the 1932 version also removes the translation of The Fight at Finnsburh to which Leonard’s headnote already cited (see previous note) still refers readers.\n\n18 Britt Mize 24 Worden, Beowulf, ed. John R. Olson (Silver Spring, MD: National Association of the Deaf, 1973); quotations from pp. iii and 34. 25 Hager, A Modern Scop Tells Beowulf (Coral Springs, FL: Llumina Press, 2007), i. 26 Kaplan, Grendel’s Guide to Love and War (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2017); Tucholke, The Boneless Mercies (New York: Farrar Straus Giroux, 2018). The status of the latter as a gender-flipped Beowulf interaction is asserted in its marketing but may be less evident from the novel itself. Another highly creative recent Beowulf adaptation (Maria Dahvana Headley, The Mere Wife [New York: MCD/Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2018]), though by an author who has previously written YA fiction, is pitched more to adult readers. 27 To give one case in point: Tony Bedard (text) and Jesus Saiz (art), “Beowulf,” in the DC Comics magazine Sword of Sorcery 0–3 (Nov. 2012– Feb. 2013), is set up as a coming-of-age story centred on Wiglaf, with whom many features of the presentation encourage an audience of boys to identify. When Wiglaf and Beowulf confront Grendel’s mother, an eroticized cyber-woman who has attacked no one, she offers no threat to them other than that which is assumed to inhere in her power and superior knowledge: she herself has already confined Grendel, reveals valuable information, and shows no aggression toward Beowulf. Nevertheless, Beowulf’s willingness to listen to her explanations rather than kill her makes Wiglaf increasingly anxious until the boy attacks her himself, confirming his manhood through violence against an exaggerated female body. The episode is in issue 3, pp. [26]–[31]. 28 Par for the course are the warrior woman Nan-Zee in Uslan and Villamonte, Beowulf: Dragon Slayer, and the ambiguously nude, Angelina Jolie–inspired Grendel’s mother in the graphic novel ancillary to the 2007 Zemeckis film (Chris Ryall [text], Gabriel Rodriguez [art], and Jay Fotos [art], Beowulf, 4 vols. issued serially [San Diego: IDW Publishing, 2007]). 29 Shand et al., in Grimm Fairy Tales 102 (one of the instalments in which Wulf is present before the start of the “Beowulf” story proper) and 109. 30 In one, Freawaru and Beowulf are understood through most of the book to be sexual partners and are twice shown having intercourse (Stephen L. Antczak [text], James C. Bassett [text], and Andy Lee [art], Beowulf: The Legend [Decatur, GA: VLE Comics, 2006], 37 and 135); and amid the hyperbolic violence of another, Grendel is depicted with an erection, fondles the naked Beowulf as he pretends to sleep, and ejaculates profusely on him during their fight (Santiago García and David Rubín, Beowulf [Bilbao: ­Astiberri Ediciones, 2014], [44]–[46]). 31 E.g., Rebecca Barnhouse, The Coming of the Dragon (New York: Random House Children’s Books, 2010); Charles A. Brady, The King’s Thane, illus.\n\nIntroduction 19 Henry [C.] Pitz (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1961); Nancy Farmer, Sea of Trolls (New York: Atheneum Books for Young Readers, 2004). 32 E.g., James Rumford, Beo-Bunny (Honolulu: Mānoa Press, 2012); N.D. Wilson, Boys of Blur (New York: Random House, 2014); Rick Barba, The Massively Multiplayer Mystery (New York: Aladdin, 2006). 33 The following two paragraphs’ comments on principles of adaptation and its analysis have several points of contact with Linda Hutcheon, A Theory of Adaptation, 2nd ed. with contributions by Siobhan O’Flynn (New York: Routledge, 2013) – not always in full agreement, but in ways that do not require debate here. In a field that has tended to bog down in taxonomy, Hutcheon redirects attention to analytical implications of the unique relationship between works that emerges through adaptation, and hers is the best holistic treatment of adaptation as a creative mode. Hutcheon does not address children’s literature; O’Flynn’s “Epilogue” (new to the 2nd ed.) briefly discusses digital adaptation of works that started out as children’s books (201–5). 34 Carl Edlund Anderson’s essay below carries out such an analysis in tracing the increasing freedom exercised by mid-twentieth-century children’s authors. 35 A wish felt keenly and addressed very thoughtfully by some creators of children’s books, as is clear in Rebecca Barnhouse’s and James Rumford’s interview below, and to which writers and illustrators respond more and less successfully, as Yvette Kisor’s chapter shows. 36 Barnhouse, The Coming of the Dragon (with a sequel, Peaceweaver [New York: Random House Children’s Books, 2012], less closely tied to Beowulf); Rumford, Beowulf: A Hero’s Tale Retold (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2007), and Beo-Bunny. 37 Donald K.

Grundtvig (1783–1872),1 wrote that Beowulf is det eneste gamle Digt, man med glad Sikkerhed kan lade Børn læse ... da man vist inderlig maatte ønske Børn livlige Riim-Krøniker istedetfor dødt Meel-Pap, og dog har saa ondt ved at finde Bøger, som med den nødvendige Livlighed og Trohjertighed forene den ikke mindre nødvendige Reenhed og Ærbarhed. [one of the very few old poems that people would happily allow children to read, (that is) if they want them to read lively rhyme chronicles instead of dead pulp fiction; and it is very difficult to find books that with the necessary liveliness and honour unite no less needed purity and honesty.2\n\nThe remark appeared in the introduction to Bjowulfs Drape: Et Gothisk Helte-Digt fra forrige Aar-Tusinde [Beowulf: A Gothic hero-poem from the previous millennium], which was the first complete translation of the poem into a modern language.3 Like the translation, the idea was unprecedented: no one had before suggested that Beowulf might be suitable for children.4 Some early scholars had deemed it rude and barbaric and therefore inappropriate reading for polite society; others thought it little more than a curiosity, a historical artifact not worth translating. But Grundtvig argued that Beowulf’s poetry contained living words bearing forth undying historical truths; the poem itself is an example of “the Word’s fight to victory,”5 not the “dull and stupid trash which some English writers of no small name have chosen to suppose.”6 Instead, it was “shaped and adapted to be a little shared Homer for England and for the North”7 and should therefore “be found in all homes and become a reader\n\nThe First Beowulf for Young Readers 21\n\nfor all children, yes, become for Scandinavia ... what the Iliad and the Odyssey were for the Greeks.”8 As the self-proclaimed prophet of modern Denmark,9 he intended to made “a living use of it all” in order “to amuse and secretly enlighten both children and parents.”10 And he did, by writing extensively about its hidden meanings and by repurposing its heroes and monsters for his own poetic recreations – all with the aim of awakening the people to a cultural heritage different from classical “Homerisk” and German traditions dominating education and thought in Denmark. However, despite his efforts, Bjowulfs Drape was, on its own, not a successful version for young readers. Like his adaptations of Saxo Grammaticus’s Gesta Danorum and Snorri Sturluson’s Heimskringla,11 when Bjowulfs Drape was published in 1820 few people bought the translation and fewer actually read it. Grundtvig admitted that the book fell dead from the press, that “for many years it was hardly read outside [his] own house,” and that he himself carried a copy to the British Library in 1829.12 The main problem was that it was a hybrid text produced without the slightest consumer awareness.13 But from the late 1820s on, as the Danish School Reform Act of 1814 promoted popular literacy, as children’s literature came into its own as a genre in Denmark, and as Grundtvig began making educational and political use of Beowulf, his followers, who called themselves “Grundtvigians,” began excerpting selections of Bjowulfs Drape in children’s textbooks, readers, and songbooks.14 As a result, the translation became a text in Grundtvig-inspired Friskoler [Free Schools] and Folkhøjskoler [People’s High Schools], Grundtvigian educational leaders, artists, and children’s writers constructed adaptations for children upon Grundtvig’s translation and interpretation, and Grundtvigian ideas about the hero and the monsters quietly found their way abroad into adaptations and interpretations of the poem for young readers. A Skald in the Childhood of Art Grundtvig’s interpretations and adaptations of Beowulf for his countrymen between 1815 and 1820 were inspired by German Romanticism and the integration of “children’s with adult literature into a national literature.”15 The godfather of German Romanticism, Johann Gottfried von Herder (1744–1803), had called ancient traditional poetry “the ­language in its childhood” and a “living expression” of “human nature.” The old poems were not like modern ones, which relate “­arbitrary dead ideas.”16 Adam Oehlenschläger (1779–1850), the ­ Danish poet Grundtvig admired most, modelled Herder-inspired recreations of Norse legends and myths in his Nordiske Digte [Norse poems].\n\n22 Mark Bradshaw Busbee\n\nOehlenschläger wrote that it wasn’t “a Homeric exhilaration” that had inspired him but “the Nordic character itself, these mountains ... with their rich metals and diamonds that only need to be polished to shine with an incredible radiance.” It must be remembered, he added, “that the diamond can only be polished in its own dust.”17 Grundtvig declared himself of the same mind as Oehlenschläger,18 and by 1815, when the Icelandic-born Danish scholar Grímur Jónsson Thorkelin (1752–1829) published the editio princeps of Beowulf,19 Grundtvig was prepared to exalt the Northern character in Beowulf.20 Thorkelin had discovered the poem in October of 1786, when Grundtvig was a small boy, and had returned from England with the transcripts of it in spring of 1791. Waiting eagerly for its publication, Grundtvig wrote that the edition would no doubt “shed a splendid light” over the people of the North.21 Later, knowing its history – that the unique manuscript was nearly destroyed by fire in 1731 and that the transcripts were nearly destroyed in 1807, when the British navy bombed Copenhagen – Grundtvig attributed a salvific quality to the poem, calling it “a brand from the fire”:22 a phrase lifted from the Old Testament, where the prophets Amos (4:11) and Zechariah (3:2) remind the people that God had saved them from destruction. Beowulf had twice been saved providentially, and now it called for interpretation. It was Grundtvig’s calling, as the prophet of modern Denmark, to relate its divine messages about kingship and community and remind his countrymen, young and old, of the spiritual gift they had received. He immersed himself – allowed himself to be trained “like a child”23 – in the language, so that he might “learn the whole poem by heart.”24 Of his first encounter, he later wrote, “Feeling the warmth that only those who know what it’s like to love from childhood the literature, the past and the Fatherland, I sat myself down and listened to the old song whose language the hand of time had so sorely crippled.”25 Assuming childlike openness, Grundtvig “wrote himself to clarity”26 and became the first modern person to understand the plot of the poem, identifying some fifteen characters Thorkelin had misunderstood or overlooked, explaining significant events such as Scyld’s ship burial and the Finnsburg episode, and making the only historical connection in the poem: the association of Beowulf’s King Hygelac with Chochilaicus in Geoffrey of Tours’ Gesta Francorum.27 He made a few mistakes, too – at first, he refused to acknowledge the first, Danish Beowulf (Beow, at l. 18)28 – and his imagination led him into a few wild misreadings, such as the idea that “the text mentions a deity’s, presumably Hilda’s, revelation in a golden airship, promising the hero both to protect him and to guard his ships.”29 Throughout, he attended closely to the poem’s illustrations of ancient Denmark. Beowulf was like “a distant close relative that we\n\nThe First Beowulf for Young Readers 23\n\nhave never seen” speaking to him across time,30 helping him to see rich interpretative possibilities in Scyld Scefing and, most influentially to twentieth-century scholars like J.R.R. Tolkien, the monsters. Grundtvig claimed that Beowulf was written by “a skald in the childhood of art,”31 a notion that fit within his broader idea that the stages of the life of man match the progression of history. It was composed at a turning point in history, a time of childhood and youth when “man gives free reign to his imagination.”32 Scyld’s mysterious arrival from the sea as a child, his formation into a powerful, beloved king, his magnanimous reign, and his equally mysterious return in death over the seas – these events unfolded, in Grundtvig’s view, like a providential prophecy of “Nordisk” destiny. The Scyld episode constituted “the most superb part of the poem ... a prediction of the incorruptibility of the Skjoldung stock [i.e., the Danish line of kings].”33 To correct Thorkelin’s Latin mistranslation of the crucial fifty-two line passage about Scyld Scefing, Grundtvig offered what he admitted was a speculative rendition in the mother tongue,34 in order “to provide readers with a picture of the poem’s singularity”; he announced a plan to illustrate it “through a quiet contemplation of the whole” in “a rhymed translation for those of [his] countrymen who do not have the opportunity to become acquainted with the original language.”35 The following excerpt represents the style and tone of his 1815 rendering of lines 43–4 of the original, the arrival and passing of Scyld (“Skjold” in Grundtvig’s version): Udstyre Man vilde Den Herre fra Land, Med Gaver saa gilde, Som da over Strand Han underlig drevet Af Herren var blevet Til Dannemarks Land.36 [This lord they would send / Equipped from the land, / With gifts so worthy, / As when, over the sea, / Miraculously he / Was driven by God / To Dannemark’s land.]37\n\nThe translation might better be termed a paraphrase due to its departure from the form of the original. Like all of Grundtvig’s verse translations of Beowulf, the lines demonstrate a balancing act: they attempt not to “diverge from the words of the text but ... to allow its spirit to express itself in another language, not only in other words but also in other expressions.”38 The translation keeps with the fashion of the day\n\n24 Mark Bradshaw Busbee\n\nof lineating the poem’s half-lines independently; it dispenses with alliteration, preferring instead ballad form with varying rhyme. Patterned after the folk-speech of Grundtvig’s boyhood nanny Malene Jensdatter (1732–1810) when she told him folktales as a child,39 it often maintains features of spoken narration. Grundtvig adds oral fillers like ja (yes) and dog (well) and subjective touches like emotive or evaluative adjectives: for example, Skjold faces death with “graanende Haar” (1820, 3) [greying hair] and “danske Adels-Blod” (1820, 14) [Danish royal blood] trails from Heorot after Grendel’s attacks. The additions often steer narration in directions of the translator’s choosing. The result is that Grundtvig is omnipresent as background storyteller. Flemming Lundgreen-Nielsen observes that this was the first time anyone from high literary circles tried to use popular speech when dealing with prestigious materials. “Thus,” Lundgreen-Nielsen writes, “Grundtvig anticipated Hans Christian Andersen’s stylistic experiments in his fairy tales for children from 1835 onwards.”40 An example of how Grundtvig steers the narrative through choices in translation can be seen in his treatment of Heorot. He explains that Hrothgar’s hall is called “Hjort ... partly because heorth is ‘home’ and partly – it seems clear ... that Hjort [hart; deer] is in any case stated to be the hall’s poetic name, presumably from the word hiorta (merry, cheerful).”41 Heorot, like the modern Danish state, “is the physical heart-muscle that distributes and guides the spiritual streams that emanate from the larger heart of civil society”; it is where the people are protected and provided justice, where they celebrate their culture and a shared reason for being.42 In a translation of lines 76b–81a, Heorot is imagined as hyggeligt (cosy) and symbolic of Hrothgar’s relationship to his people, stylized as a sort of King Arthur’s court with its round table.43 Grundtvig writes, “There was strength in the King’s words. [Hrothgar] called the Fortress ‘Heart.’ He benched his fighters around the table and gave them what they had earned. Yes, he filled their hands with silver and gold. He gave them from his heart.”44 Like Frederik VI (r. 1808–39), Grundtvig’s king and benefactor, Hrothgar gifts the people “not just with gold and shiny jewels but with the most honorable and rarest stones in the crown: fervent love.”45 His magnanimity extends to other Northern peoples, especially to the “Goth” Beowulf before he departs for Gothland. Lines 1870–3 are adapted to amplify the close relationship of Denmark with the other peoples of the north: Se Taarerne runde Den Gubbe paa Kind, Ei dølge han kunde\n\nThe First Beowulf for Young Readers 25 Bevægede Sind, Tog Bjovulf i Arme, Som Ven tager Ven, Og kysde med Varme Den herlige Svend.46 [See, the tears flowed down / On the old man’s cheeks. / He could not conceal / His deeply moved mind, / Embraced Beowulf, / As friend hugs his friend, / And kissed him with warmth, / The glorious lad.]47\n\nTo this idealized Danish community, the monsters offer for Grundtvig a violent contrast, a threat that elevates the poem’s meaning. They demonstrate the poet’s “Barn-Dommen” [child-like judgement] and love of “æventyr” [folktale] (both terms quoted from Bjowulfs Drape, liv), so, naturally, Grundtvig appeals to Danish superstition and folklore, calling Grendel a troll, his mother a Hex (witch), and the dragon by the name “Stærkhjort,”48 and suggesting that Grendelsmere is located in “Trumholt Skov,” which in Jutland is called “the witch’s meeting place.”49 Choices like these allow a dual focus to emerge. The monsters must be vividly portrayed for young readers, but like all compelling stories for children, they must also contain images intriguing to adults reading (and buying) books for their children. In his longest essay on Beowulf, Grundtvig offers the following explanation of the meaning of the monsters and the hero: “The stories about Grendel and the dragon make up the chief content of the poem, as a continuation of the warfare that the devil and the old giants waged against God, a fight which, carried on by trolls and the like, interpenetrates the historical matter of the poem and is meant to give to this matter a higher meaning.”50 The monster fights “can be seen to shadow forth in the double adventure” of mankind. That double adventure is revealed in “falsehood’s hostility to truth ... partly in history and partly in nature.”51 Beowulf is not only the “Helten er Gothernes, det Nordiske Kaempe Folks” [hero of the Goths, the Scandinavian warrior-people], he is also God’s agent who “afvæbner Mørkets Magt og redder med Kraft det døende Folke-Liv” [disarms the powers of the dark and rescues by force the dying people’s life] (Bjowulfs Drape, li–lii, li). Bjowulfs Drape makes this existentialist meaning understandable to the child by having “Trolden Grendel” cast sleep upon the “drunken, snoring” warriors before devouring them.52 Beowulf explains the problem to his Danish hosts: Saa vidt han sig formaster, Han kommer vaabenløs,\n\n26 Mark Bradshaw Busbee Kun Søvn han paa jer kaster, Jer Helsot er en Døs!\n\n(Bjowulfs Drape, 56)\n\n[So far as he presumes to, / He comes weaponless. / He only casts sleep upon you, / Your wasting disease is a stupor.]\n\nThe proposal amplifies dual interpretive potential for Grendel: he is a bogeyman who attacks people when they are asleep and most vulnerable – the stuff of childhood nightmares; for adults he is an intellectual and spiritual or moral problem that goes “nær til Hjerte” (Bjowulfs Drape, 14) [close to the heart]. Endnotes explain how Grundtvig’s reading solves a crux at line 600,53 but the translation fits Grendel’s actions into broader meanings for the poem as a whole. Grendel is a “Hedning Sjæl,” “Gud forhadt” (Bjowulfs Drape, 79, 67) [heathen soul, hated by God]; for adults he also plays a metaphorical role akin to that of Jean-Paul Sartre’s angoisse: he is the lie preventing modern Danes from dragging themselves out of le visqueux (the mud) or le néant (the void) of paganism and national lethargy.54 He is the force inhibiting national self-awareness and growth and a symbol of “discontinuity in human existence, particularly in the struggle between the forces of life and death.”55 Skjold and the Monsters as Allegorical Figures Between 1815 and his first interpretations of the poem, and 1820 when Bjowulfs Drape was published, Grundtvig repurposed the heroes and monsters of Beowulf in ways that can be seen as a subtext for later Danish adaptations for young readers. An early retelling of the first fifty-two lines of the poem – Scyld Scefing’s arrival and departure over the sea – shows Grundtvig working Scyld Scefing into the better-known story of the Danish King Skjold, already well-known through Saxo Grammaticus’s Gesta Danorum. In the poem “Danne-Virke,” Skjold’s body is sent out over the waves, but rather than drifting into the unknown, it lands again on Danish soil. His death represents the unfortunate historical loss of a uniquely Danish form of spirituality, during a period of national decline and depression. And the poet calls Skjold back to help the Danes when they need him.56 This poem anticipated Grundtvig’s evolving thoughts about the role of the Beowulf interpreter and about the meanings of the monster fights, thoughts that reach new levels in 1817 during the three-hundred-year jubilee for the Reformation. His poem “Ragna-Roke, (et dansk Æmter)” was published in Grundtvig’s journal Danne-Virke,57 alongside his\n\nThe First Beowulf for Young Readers 27\n\nlongest essay on Beowulf, “Om Bjovulfs Drape.” In the second of five scenes imagined as dialogues between the Northern spirit and the legendary folk hero Holger Danske, the poet Cædmon says, Jeg drømde, jeg drømde, Kong David jeg saae, Han gav mig i Hænde Sin Harpe saa prud, Strængene gyldne Slog jeg med Vælde, End vel i Midgard Mindes mit Kvad. Jeg bøied mit Øre Til Bogen hin gamle, Dens Tale fik Tone, Og Tungen fik Røst, Billeder høie Blikket opdaged, Venlig jeg skiænked Skriften mit Prud. “Us is riht micel Dhæt ve rodera-veard Vereda vuldor-cining Vordum herigen!” Toner som disse Tør jeg vel haabe, Sank ei i Tidens Skummende Bølger. Jeg Øre og laande Til Oldtidens Sagn, I Krands jeg dem fletted, Med Konst jeg dem bandt, Som svaiende Kviste Man sanker og binder, Og skaber et Lysthuus I Skoven saa vild. “Hvæt ve gar-dena In gear-dægum, Theod-cyninga Thrym gefrunon,” End vil jeg haabe Hrodgar og Bjovulf\n\n28 Mark Bradshaw Busbee Kvæde i Salen Kæmpernes Priis. Saa jeg paa Harpen Hævede Sandsagn, Adled til Epos Oldtidens Digt, Stridige Stykker Snild jeg forbandt: Yndig blev Sandhed, Og Æmter sandsynligt.\n\n(“Ragna-Roke,” 340–2)\n\n[I dreamed, I dreamed, / I saw King David. / He put into my hand / his beautiful harp. / Golden strings / I struck with might. / Then well in Middle-earth / my song will be remembered. / I bent my ear / to the ancient book. / Its speech received tone, / and the tongue, a voice; / noble images / flashed before my eyes. / I paid my respects / to the writing. / “For us, it is an important duty / that we praise the protector of heaven / king over armies / with our words.” / Tones such as these / I dare hope / never sink in time’s / foam-bearing waves. / I lent an ear / to the myths of ancient times, / I wove them into garlands, / with art I bound them, / as swaying twigs / one collects and binds / and builds an arbour / in the forest so wild. / “Listen! We of the Spear-Danes / in days of yore, / of the folk-kings, / glory have heard.” / Yet will I hope / Hrothgar and Beowulf / sing together in the hall / the heroes’ praise. / So with the harp / I raised up true tales, / ennobled them to epics, / the poetry of former times, / difficult pieces / cleverly I mixed: / lovely became truth, / and fairy tales possible.]\n\nWithin this recreation, Luther’s reform of the Catholic Church is reconceived in terms of Beowulf’s fight with Grendel. The Northern Spirit says, Lad høit mig dig berømme, Du Helt, som kiæk og bold, Trods Ild og Edder-Strømme, Lemlæsted Romas Trold! Ja, feig fra Kampens Bulder Alt fra sin Arm og Skulder Som Grændel flygted han. Endnu, ak, gaaer hans Moder Ved Midnat ud paa Rov, Ja, Hrodgars Vaaben-Broder Hun kvalde mens han sov;\n\nThe First Beowulf for Young Readers 29 Den Hex saa leed sig skjuler I Fjeldets dybe Huler, Paa Nykke-Havets Bund.\n\n(“Ragna-Roke,” 327)\n\n[Let me praise you / you hero [Luther], who brave and bold, / in spite of fire and poison streams, / mutilated the Roman troll! / Yes, cowardly from the battle din, / from his arm and shoulder, / Grendel carried himself away. / Yet, oh, his mother goes / at midnight out on the hunt; / Yes, Hrothgar’s brother-in-arms / she killed while he slept; / the witch then sought to hide herself / in the deep caves / at the bottom of the monster-mere.]\n\nAnd later, Christ’s harrowing of hell is imagined in terms of Beowulf’s fight with Grendel’s mother: Da, som de Toner klinge, Skal Helten brat opspringe Alt af sin Himmelseng. Til Lue-Skoven haster Den Helt som ei kan døe, Og dristig han sig kaster Alt i den sorte Søe. Hans Byrnje aldrig bugner, Og Sværd med Oldtids Runer, Til Brug er ham beredt. Naar vældig han det svinger, Faaer Jesabel sin Løn, Og hovedløs nedspringer Til Helhjem hendes Søn; Med Hoved og med Hjalte Skal Bjovulf og de Talte, For Hrod-Gar stædes ind.\n\n(“Ragna-Roke,” 328–9)\n\n[Then, as the bells ring, / the hero shall spring up / out of his heavenly bed. / To the terrible forest [where Grendel lives] rushes / the hero who cannot die, / and valiantly he casts himself / into the dark lake. / His armour never bends, / and a sword with ancient runes / has been prepared for him. / When powerfully he swings it, / Jezebel gets what she deserves / and jumps headless down / to Hell, her son; / With head and with hilt, / shall Beowulf and the chosen ones / be brought before Hrothgar.]\n\nThe sword in the Christ-like hero’s hands has double significance. On a literal level, it is the sword Beowulf finds in his fight with Grendel’s\n\n30 Mark Bradshaw Busbee\n\nmother, the hilt from which Hrothgar seems to read before making his famous sermon (Beowulf, ll. 1698–1795). On a metaphorical level, the sword might also be the poem Beowulf itself, if Grundtvig is considering the Old English and Old Icelandic meanings of the word in his metaphor for the poem as a “Brand udrevet af Ilden” [sword pulled from the fire].58 The hero, whether he be Christ, Luther, Beowulf, or Grundtvig himself, uses the message of the poem to defeat spiritual lethargy. This message was redirected into political channels after the July Revolutions in France in 1830 and Denmark’s 1848 war with Prussia over the Schleswig-Holstein region, which bordered Prussia to the south.59 In an 1841 essay, Grundtvig writes that “as soon as the troll manages to send [Denmark] to sleep, as so often happens, she sinks down to become a German slave-maiden.”60 In 1850, he writes, One sees easily at once what the old skald could then have either dreamed or thought, that the troll Grendel and his mother are the most fitting picture that one could wish for of the Germans in Denmark. One can see only shame, much like what Grendel and his mother brought ... It is also now high time that we make for ourselves a good omen, as the old Norse heroic poem gives us a glimmering victory over Denmark’s arch-enemies.61\n\nAnd in 1864, he reimagines Grendel’s sleeping spell as a metaphor for the German language – Grendel’s “Trolde-Sorg” [troll-sorrow] does damage to children’s ears; the hero restores “Barne-Glæde” [childhood joy] by telling them the old Danish songs.62 Associations like these form a powerful political subtext for Danes encountering Beowulf through Grundtvig’s translation. And why not interpret the poem this way? In 1817, he had regarded it as “a golden harp from Heathen times, with broken strings and with its stem melted by the heat.”63 It could be refashioned according to the truth, “a melting oven” in which “everything shall be cast”; that “which is left unscathed will be seen as truth, but whatever the fire melts is the lie.”64 The times called for political readings. And so, “the old forgotten poem” is given “new clothes, new money, and lessons in modern speech so that it might get along in the new world.”65 Bjowulfs Drape as Source Text for Educational Readers and Patriotic Songbooks Before the 1830s, Grundtvig’s translation, interpretations, and adaptations of Beowulf fell on deaf ears. Grundtvig attributed the fact that nobody bothered to read Bjowulfs Drape to the indifference of the people\n\nThe First Beowulf for Young Readers 31\n\nof Denmark at the time.66 It could be said that the public did not begin to regard Bjowulfs Drape as a text for young readers until 1829, when Grundtvig used his first pedagogical experiment, Krønike-Riim til Børn-Lærdom [Chronicle rhymes for the education of children], as a vehicle for his ideas. Krønike-Riim was a school reader in Danish that included the history, folklore, myth, and legend of the North. Its poems, including one titled “Angel-Sachsener,” were originally written by Grundtvig for his own children in folk-style poetry so that they might more readily enjoy and identify with them. Grundtvig reintroduces ­Beowulf as the “Sagn og Æventyr / ... / Harpen kaldte, under Kors, / Heden-Old tilbage, / Bragende om Grændel Trold, / Bjovulf, Hengst, og Hnæf og Skjold, / Norden i det Hele!” [song and fairy tale / ... / of heathen times / (that) the harp called back, under the sign of the cross, / (including) heroic songs about Grendel the troll, / Beowulf, Hengst, and Hnæf and Skjold, / and the entire North!].67 Krønike-Riim coincided with Grundtvig’s “long descent from the high-level ‘scholarship of clarification’ to the activity of folkoplysning (enlightenment of the people).”68 He had made three consecutive summer research trips to England (1829–31) and had returned with a refined interest in education and how Beowulf might fit into a plan of enlightenment. “This early Gothic Homer,” he proclaimed to English-speaking scholars, deserves “the attention and admiration of cultivated minds.”69 In Nordens Mythologie (1832), possibly his most famous work, he proclaimed that books from the Middle Ages like Beowulf were “suffering the same fate as its castles, that is, they lie in ruins.”70 He complained that “scholars preferred to bury these treasures in the ground and brood over them like dragons until the end of the world rather than make them fruitful for life by developing a comprehensive humane education.”71 Bjowulfs Drape grew in popularity alongside Grundtvig’s ideas and the development and spread of the People’s High Schools, for which Grundtvig has been called the “Father of Western Adult Education.”72 In 1831, a follower of Grundtvig named Christian Flor (1792–1875) published Danske Læsebog til Brug i de laerde Skoler [Danish reader for use in schools], which reproduced the main storyline of the first part of Beowulf (pp. 8–62 of Bjowulfs Drape) and titled it “Grendels Uvæsen i Hjorteborg – Gothen Bjovulf” [Grendel’s attack in Heorot – the Goth Beowulf].73 A few years later, when Hans Christian Andersen began publishing his Eventyr [Fairy tales], Danish scholars began to take children’s literature seriously. P.M. Møller (1794–1838) published an article titled “Om at fortælle Børn Eventyr” [On telling children fairy tales] that stirred debate about how practical contemporary children’s stories\n\n32 Mark Bradshaw Busbee\n\nshould be and what narration style is best; one of the background discussants was Søren Kierkegaard (1813–55).74 In an 1837 journal entry, Kierkegaard describes contemporary children’s literature as “poetic dross” (“poetisk Skyllevand”); it is overly didactic, hackneyed, and tedious. What matters is that the stories should “bring the poetic to bear on their lives in every way, to exert a magical influence.”75 Often opposed to Grundtvig’s ideas, Kierkegaard reflects the evolving support amongst scholars, even among his fiercest ideological opponents, for Grundtvigian presentations of old poems like Beowulf.76 After 1838, Grundtvig began to make public proclamations that ­Beowulf is suitable as a “reader for all children” and that it would become “what the Iliad and the Odyssey were for the Greeks.”77 By 1847, Beowulf became squarely part of Grundtvig’s educational program when his Græsk og Nordisk Mythologi for Ungdommen [Greek and Nordic mythology for the youth] was commissioned for use in schools.78 The anthology of stories includes sections on “Skjold og Fredegod” (248–52) [Skjold and Fredegod], in which Skjold is described (and illustrated) as “Danmarks Skytsaand” (248) [Denmark’s guardian spirit]; “Rodgar og Grændel” (252–3) [Hrothgar and Grendel], in which “en afskyelig Trold ... kastede Søvn paa hans Kæmper” (252) [the monstrous troll [Grendel] ... casts sleep on Hrothgar’s warriors]; and “Bjovulf og Stærkhjort” (257–9) ­[Beowulf and Strong-Heart [the dragon]], in which the hero “frelste det indsovede Danmark” (257) [frees a sleeping Denmark]. The message is that Beowulf and the Eddic poems are “folkehistoriske Myther udtrykker en historisk Sandhed” (251) [folk-historic myths expressing historic truth], shared by all nations of the north as a common heritage (252). Grundtvig’s followers were listening. Between the two wars with Prussia in 1848 and 1864, numerous editions of Danish patriotic songbooks appeared that included excerpts from Bjowulfs Drape.79 Carl Joachim Brandt’s Rim og Sange til Fædrelandets Historie [Rhymes and songs of the fatherland’s history], volume 1, was the first to use selections from Bjowulfs Drape as part of a compilation of heroic songs of Denmark.80 The anthology includes excerpts from it titled “Trolden Grændel” (38–9) [The troll Grendel], “Bjovulfs Pris” (40–3) [Beowulf’s worth], and “Rodgars Tak” (44–5) [Hrothgar’s thanks]. Brandt provides short explanations before each selection that demonstrate his (and his readers’) acceptance of Grundtvig’s interpretation of Beowulf. For example, Brandt discusses Grundtvig’s attribution of magic to Grendel’s terrorizing of Heorot before providing the corresponding selection from Bjowulfs Drape (38). In 1865, Kristian Køster’s Et Hundrede Danske Sange [One hundred Danish songs] reproduced Grundtvig’s poem “Skjold” as a song, titled\n\nThe First Beowulf for Young Readers 33\n\n“Skjold kommer til Danmark” (no. 51, pp. 100–1) [Skjold comes to Denmark].81 The poem-turned-song incorporates Old Testament images of Moses’s arrival and the Lion of Judah (Gen. 49:9 and Rev. 5:5) as well as traditions from Norse myth – of the goddess Freya’s beauty and of Odin’s role as All-father. The first stanza dramatizes Denmark in a time of need by gesturing to conditions of contemporary post-war Denmark: I gamle dage det var en gang, at danske folk var i kongetrang; de gode græd, og de onde lo, hvor ingen hegner, kun torne gro! Da kom en snekke for fulde sejl med løvehoved og hjertespejl, med guld og våben og stads om bord, men ikke en sjæl ved mast og ror, dog var der liv, for en lille dreng alene lå i store seng, en neg var bundet med aks og strå, den hviled drengen sit hoved på, og hvor han sov både spæd og spag, dér vajed over et kongeflag, så liljehvidt og så rosenrødt, som kun hos Freja på kinden mødt. [In the old days there was a time / when the Danish folk required a king; / the good cried and the evil laughed – / without a hedge, thorns upspring! / Then came a boat with its sail full, / with lion-head and heart-mirror,82 / with gold and weapons and robes on board, / but not a soul by the mast and oar, / Yet was there life, for a little boy / alone lay in the big ship-bed, / a sheaf was bound with wheat and straw, / on which he rested his little head, / and where he slept both small and weak, / there waved over him a royal flag, / so lily white and so rose red, / as only on Freya’s cheek are at play.]83\n\nThe people wonder if the boy is a gift from Odin, the news spreads with clash of arms, and the skalds of Denmark sing the Skjold’s praises. A Grundtvigian composite image of Skjold/Scyld was already present as early as 1847 in David Jacobsen’s illustration that accompanied Grundtvig’s retelling of the event for young readers in Græsk og Nordisk Mythologi for Ungdommen (see fig. 1.1). The illustration blends anachronistic imagery – the sailed vessel, tunics, winged helmets – to give the scene a timeless quality, and it begins a long tradition of illustrations and paintings of this scene in Denmark.84\n\n34 Mark Bradshaw Busbee\n\nFigure 1.1. Skjold/Scyld, by David Jacobsen, from N.F.S. Grundtvig, Græsk og Nordisk Mythologi for Ungdommen. Copenhagen: Bing & Søn, 1847, p. 248.\n\nDuring the final quarter of the nineteenth century, Grundtvig’s version of Beowulf, which appeared in a second edition in 1865, became a mainstay of the People’s High School tradition. Ludvig Schrøder, a follower of Grundtvig, published Om Bjovulfs-drapen: Efter en række foredrag på folkehöjskolen i Askov [The heroic poem of Beowulf: From a series of lectures at the People’s High School in Askov]85 based on lectures Schrøder had given at Askov, a heavily politicized People’s High School located just north of Denmark’s border with Prussia. Schrøder’s book relied greatly upon Grundtvig’s 1820 translation,86 and it revived and extended many of Grundtvig’s readings of the poem, particularly his theme of awakening. Robert Bjork writes that Schrøder’s work “emerged, after all, in the context of Grundtvig’s educational program in the People’s High Schools that Grundtvig founded in Denmark, and Beowulf was being used by Schrøder as the nationalistic reader Grundtvig had hoped it would be.”87 Drawing upon Grundtvig’s interpretation of Grendel as a symbol of the Roman Catholic Church in “Ragna-Roke, (et dansk Æmter),” where Grundtvig had called the Pope “the troll of Rome,” and his interpretation of Beowulf as a figure of Luther,\n\nThe First Beowulf for Young Readers 35\n\nSchrøder identifies Pope Leo X’s selling of indulgences to build St. Peter’s in Rome as one of the causes of the Reformation. As such, Pope Leo’s building of St. Peter’s is similar to Hroðgar’s building of Heorot. Beowulf, like Luther, had to fight to overcome the lethargic self-satisfaction that follows such a proud enterprise. Like Grundtvig, Schrøder finds other broad allegorical possibilities in the poem: ­Beowulf’s sword symbolizes heroic action, gold symbolizes happiness, and fire symbolizes evil and anger.88 Most influential in bringing Grundtvig’s Beowulf into the hands of Danish young people were the songbooks used in the People’s High Schools. Poul Dam notes that, collectively, the songs adapted from the poem might be thought of as collectively constituting a third edition of Grundtvig’s translation.89 The development of the songbook tradition is informative: it could be said that, in its relationship to Beowulf, the roots of the tradition reach back to a series of lectures Grundtvig gave in 1838 that inspired books like Brandt’s 1848 collection, Rim og Sange til Fæderlandets Historie, which included poems from Grundtvig’s 1820 translation. The tradition grew and gained momentum in books like H. Nutzhorn and Ludvig Schrøder’s Historiske Sange [Historical songs] in 1872, which featured thirty-five of Grundtvig’s historical poems, fourteen of which were imported directly from the second edition of Grundtvig’s Beowulf from 1865 (retitled Bjovulfs-Drapen, et Høinordisk Heltedigt fra Anguls-Tungen) [Beowulf’s death, a High Norse heroic poem from the tongue of the Angles].90 It seems clear that Historiske Sange effectively reintroduced Grundtvig’s Beowulf to future generations and paved the way for the first People’s High School songbooks, such as Jens Bek and N. Johan Laursen’s Sangbog for den danske folkehøjskole [Songbook for the Danish People’s High School], published in 1888 and, most influentially, Nutzhorn’s Sangbog for Højskoler [Songbook for High Schools] in 1894. Konstantin-Hansen and Skovgaard’s Grundtvigian Bjovulf for Children By the early twentieth century, schoolchildren, young Danes attending People’s High Schools, even regular citizens – that is, nearly everyone – had been exposed to Bjowulfs Drape through the collective effort of Grundtvigians and the ubiquitous Folkehøjskolens Sangbog, and most people took it for granted that “Grundtvig had attempted to express what he saw in the poem in a creative manner.”91 Popular artists followed Grundtvig’s lead, too: in 1899, Valdemar Rørdam’s free translation Bjovulf: Et Digt [Beowulf: A poem] seems to have fully trusted\n\n36 Mark Bradshaw Busbee\n\nBjowulfs Drape as its source text.92 Rørdam accepts Grundtvig’s nationalist readings, even some of his early, questionable ones. For example, in Rørdam’s version we learn that Om Natten er Grændel Jætte Hersker paa Skjoldungestol. Han Kastede Søvn på Vagten Og åd den for Kongens Dør. At Trold over Mand fik Magten Ved Søvn, det så man før.93 [at night Grendel the giant / ruled on the Skjoldung throne. / He cast sleep on the watchmen / and ate them before the king’s door. / That the troll gained power over men / with sleep, that has been seen before.]\n\nThe full flowering of a Grundtvigian version of Beowulf for children came in 1914 with Bjovulf: Et Angelsaksisk Heltedigt [Beowulf: An Anglo-Saxon heroic poem] by Thora Konstantin-Hansen (1867–1954), with illustrations by Niels Kristian Skovgaard (1858–1938).94 The writer and the artist were reared in Grundtvigian households and were inculcated by followers of Grundtvig from their youth. Konstantin-Hansen grew up within the walls of Vartov, the church-school compound where Grundtvig preached until his death in 1872. It is likely that she was christened by Grundtvig and that, from a very young age, she read and sang portions of Bjowulfs Drape from Flor’s and Brandt’s readers and Køster’s songbook. In the summer of 1882, when she was fifteen, she spent a summer at Askov Højskolen, where Ludvig Schrøder had presented and published his Grundtvig-inspired Beowulf lectures seven years earlier. (He was still headmaster when she attended.) Later in life Konstantin-Hansen claimed that the basis for her world view was the Grundtvigian Free School.95 Niels Skovgaard’s upbringing was similarly Grundtvigian. Like Konstantin-Hansen, Skovgaard’s father was a close friend of Grundtvig’s. He was educated in “Gregersens Skole,” a Grundtvigian basic school in Copenhagen, where he, too, likely read widely in Grundtvig’s writings, and where he became close friends with Grundtvig´s son Frederik Lange Grundtvig and frequented his home.96 Their collaboration provides a rich commentary on Bjowulfs Drape. In the foreword to her children’s version, Konstantin-Hansen writes, Danske Lærde og Digtere har udgivet, forklaret og oversat det angelsaksiske Digt i sin Helhed længe før nogen anden, ikke engang Englænderne\n\nThe First Beowulf for Young Readers 37 selv ... Især har N. F. S. Grundtvig Æren af at have gjort opmærksom paa dets Værd og gjort det tilgængeligt for os paa Dansk. Det var hans Ønske, at Bjovulfsdrapen “maatte findes i alle Huse og blive Læsebog for alle Børn, ja, blive for Norden efter fattig Lejlighed hvad Iliaden og Odysseen var for Grækerne.” Denne Bog, som kun er en forkortet fri Gengivelse, skulde gerne give danske Børn Lyst til, naar de bliver ældre, at læse Grundtvigs Gengivelse af Bjovulfsdrapen i smukke og morsomme danske Vers. Senere kunde de saa have Udbytte af at læse Adolf Hansens Oversættelse i en Versform, der kommer den gamle angelsaksiske saa nær som muligt, og af at læse hvad A. Olrik i “Danmarks Heltedigtning I” har at fortælle om Bjovulfsdrapen og dens Forhold til Skjoldsagnene. Kunde denne lille Bog blive Begyndelsen til en saadan Læserække, var den i alt Fald Udgivelsen værd. (5) [Danish scholars and poets have published, explicated, and translated the Anglo-Saxon poem in its entirety long before anyone else, even the English themselves ... N.F.S. Grundtvig particularly has the honour of having called attention to its worth and making it available to us in Danish. It was his wish that Bjovulfsdrapen “might be found in all houses and become a reading book for all children, yes, become for the North through practice what the Iliad and the Odyssey were for the Greeks.” This book, which is only an abridged free paraphrase, is intended to spark desire in Danish children, when they get older, to read Grundtvig’s version of Beowulf in beautiful and entertaining Danish verse. Later, they could then have the benefit of reading Adolf Hansen’s translation in a verse form that comes as close as possible to the old Anglo-Saxon, and to read what Olrik, in Danmarks Heltedigtning I, has to say about Bjovulfsdrapen and its relation to the Skjoldung sagas. Should this little book be the beginning of such a reading lineup, then its publication would be worth the work.]\n\nThese remarks are dated March 1914, a month before the First World War began. Denmark had assumed neutrality but memories of the humiliation of defeat by Prussia in 1864 certainly lingered. The prose translation gives the whole of the Danish part of the poem, ending where Grundtvig said it should have ended.97 Konstantin-Hansen’s translation follows the shape of Bjowulfs Drape by mirroring Grundtvig’s fifteen “songs” instead of the original text’s twenty-eight sections (including the proem) in the Danish half of the poem. The poem’s allusion to the biblical creation story, the Finnsburg episode, and the allusion to Sigemund are omitted, and the portions\n\n38 Mark Bradshaw Busbee\n\nof the poem that Grundtvig emphasized and that had been adapted for the Folkhøjskole Sangbog are amplified and savoured. Here is Konstantin-Hansen’s opening: Vi har hørt meget fortælle om Danernes Færd i gamle Dage, om Kongernes Stordaad og Heltenes Sejre. En af de bedste Fortællinger er dog den om Kong Skjold, ham der blev fundet som et hjælpeløst Barn, men havde Lykken med sig og steg saaledes i Magt og Hæder, at alle omboende Folk derovre paa den anden Side af Havet maatte adlyde ham og give ham Skat. Han styrede sit Rige godt. (9) [We have often heard stories about the Danes’ deeds in the old days, about the kings’ great deeds and the heroes’ victories. One of the best-known stories is one about King Skjold, he who was found as a helpless child, but was so fortunate and grew so great in might and honour, that all surrounding peoples over on the other side of the sea were forced to obey him and give him treasure. He ruled his kingdom well.]\n\nThe narration omits the Danish Beowulf/Beow (at line 56 in the original) and reports instead about Halfdan’s three sons Hjorgar, Hrodgar, and Helge and a daughter “Elan,” who married the warlike Skjoldung Anganthiov.98 Following Grundtvig, Hrothgar’s hall is called “Hjorthal,” and the king “skænkede Ringe og Smykker til alle, der samledes i Hallen” (11) [gave rings and treasures to all who were gathered in the hall]. But harmony is broken by the troll Grendel. We are told that Grendel “spejded ind gennem Gluggen og saa, hvorledes Hirdmændene havde lagt sig til Hvile efter Gildet og nu sov sødelig uden at ane Fare” (12) [spied in through the window and saw how the warriors had lain down to rest after the feast and now slept soundly without knowing danger]. The facing page illustration (see fig. 1.2) provides a distinctly Grundtvigian subtext to the narrative. Grendel is a shadowy creature who blends into the landscape and the sky. Behind him, the clouds assume human shapes as though the monster is part of a greater, more ominous invasion, one that readers in March of 1914 were likely to discern quite clearly as suggesting German aggression. The brave “Gøte” [Goth] Beowulf hears about “denne tunge Sorg paa Kongens Hjerte” [the heavy sorrow upon [Hrothgar’s] heart] through the “Sange fra Mund til Mund vidt ud i Verden” (15) [songs sung mouth to mouth wide over the world]. In the subsequent sections, Konstantin-Hansen’s narrative follows Bjowulfs Drape closely, though she omits Beowulf’s claim that Grendel casts sleep on the Danes and quite conspicuously amplifies Wealhthow’s (Valtjov’s) part, providing\n\nThe First Beowulf for Young Readers 39\n\nFigure 1.2. Grendel spying into Hjorthal, by Niels Skovgaard, from Konstantin-Hansen, Bjovulf: Et Angelsaksisk Heltedigt, p. 13.\n\nthe queen’s speeches in their entirety. Beowulf’s fight with Grendel also follows the general storyline of Bjowulfs Drape, though, as in Grundtvig’s version, Beowulf awaits the monster with his men positioned around him on the floor. And the narrator adjusts the tone of the scene slightly, adding that even though Beowulf’s men were afraid and doubted that they would ever leave Heorot, “Snart faldt de dog alle i Sövn undtagen een” (33) [they all quickly fell asleep, all except one]. The fight scene as illustrated by Skovgaard (see fig. 1.3) suggests that he and Konstantin-Hansen were attending to the analogous scene in\n\n40 Mark Bradshaw Busbee\n\nFigure 1.3. Beowulf fighting Grendel, by Niels Skovgaard, from Konstantin-Hansen, Bjovulf: Et Angelsaksisk Heltedigt, p. 34.\n\nGrettirs saga, which she had translated in 1912. In the scene, the hero Grettir realized that it would be useless to struggle with the undead Glam any longer so he “satte samtidig Foden mod en stor, jord-fast Sten ved Døren” [set his foot against a large, earth-bound stone by the door].99 Skovgaard has Beowulf fight Grettir-like, leveraging himself against the doorframe. When Grendel’s mother comes for revenge, Beowulf tells Hrothgar to be strong. The narrator adds that they “var et dygtigt og rask Folk, de danske!” (43) [were a doughty and tough people, the Danes!], and we hear hints of Konstantin-Hansen’s feminist outlook when she has the narrator sarcastically speculate that “det var jo dog kun en Kvinde, der ikke i Mod og Kraft kan maale sig med Mænd” (44) [[Grendel’s mother] was sure enough only a woman, who in courage and power could not\n\nThe First Beowulf for Young Readers 41\n\nmeasure up with a man]. With her defeat, the Danes can “sove i Fred” (59) [sleep in peace]. As Beowulf sets out to depart for “Folk og Fædreland” (62) [[his] people and fatherland], Hrothgar tells him that he has “fuldbyrdet Freden mellem Gøter og Daner” (63) [fulfilled his duty to bring peace between the Goths and Danes]; then, as the king says his farewells, “Taarerne randt ned ad hans Kinder” (64) [tears ran down his cheeks]. The story ends not with the departure of the hero over the sea, in a way that would mirror Scyld’s departure, but with Beowulf’s joy-filled return to Gothland, where he tells his tale and thanks God for his victory. Grundtvigian Echoes in Bruder and Tolkien Grundtvig’s pioneering belief that the poem bears forth modern-day truths found its way into the currents of influence in German and English traditions of Beowulf for young readers. In 1927, the German Otto Bruder published a “Laienspiel” titled Beowulf: Ein heldisches Spiel [­Beowulf: A heroic play].100 Intended to be performed as an inspirational piece for the German youth movement, its theme is the awakening of a people from lethargy. The plot of the play is relatively simple: each night shieldbearers stand watch, but one by one they succumb to fatigue and are devoured by a for"
