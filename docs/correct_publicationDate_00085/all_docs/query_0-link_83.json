        "text": "Steven Barnes has been recently signed by Del Rey to write a Star Wars novel.\n\nWebsite: http://www.lifewrite.com/\n\nJedi Council Forums Username: Darth_Barnes\n\nFull length novels that Steven has written include:\n\nDream Park (With Larry Niven), Ace Books 1981.\n\nThe Descent of Anansi (With Larry Niven) Tor Books, 1982\n\nStreetlethal Ace Books, 1983.\n\nThe Kundalini Equation Tor Books, May 1986.\n\nThe Legacy of Heorot Pocket Books, written with Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. Simon and Schuster , July 1987.\n\nThe Barsoom Project, Ace Books August 1989.\n\nFUSION Five-part graphic novel for Eclipse Comics. 1987\n\nGorgon Child, Tor Books, December 1989.\n\nAchilles' Choice (With Larry Niven), Tor 1991\n\nThe California Voodoo Game (With Larry Niven), 1991\n\nFireDance-Tor, 1993\n\nThese works have been variously translated into Italian, Spanish, German, Japanese, Dutch, Hungarian and Polish.\n\nBeowulf's Children, Tor, 1995 (With Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle)\n\nBlood Brothers, Tor, 1996\n\nIron Shadows, Tor, 1997\n\nFar Beyond the Stars, Bantam, 1998\n\nSaturn's Race, Tor, 2000\n\nCharisma, Tor 2000\n\nLion's Blood, Warner 2002\n\nDiscuss Steven's novels and aspects of his writing in this thread. You never know, Steven might drop by from time to time!\n\nI've read two of his novels:\n\nStar Trek: Deep Space Nine: Far Beyond the Stars was an adaptation of the episode with the same title, and was much, much better than the Episode. I forget the details, but it had to do with Sisko dealing with racism in America in the mid-20th century.\n\nThe Legacy of Heorot, written with Niven & Pournelle, was a fairly standard Aliens-style action/adventure sci-fi novel which was pretty unfulfilling but not bad.\n\nDual-meaning. The planet, Ord Cestus is the main setting for the novel.\n\nHowever, the word is latin for a woman's belt, which has meanings from girdle to a specific type of symbolic belt worn by a bride.\n\nSo, therefore, I think we must obviously conclude from the title that this story will tie in with the Corellian Trilogy - a sort of prequel. Kit Fisto and Obi-Wan must stop bio war droids from accessing Centerpoint.\n\nBecause the bride in question, can only mean Roger, MacBride Allen.\n\n...Or not.\n\nScheduled for June 2004 is The Cestus Deception, a Clone Wars hardcover novel by author Steven Barnes, published by Del Rey Books\n\nJust as I thought, it's a hardcover. Like all prequel bridge books that have come out on recent years, I get to wait until June 2005 for a cheaper paperback. Is that cool or what?\n\n1) Genghis -- your forgot the more used definition of \"cestus\" -- a hand covering of leather bands often loaded with lead or iron and used by boxers in ancient Rome. Typically this has just been adapted to \"spiked gloves\" but the original meaning still stands and is more common than a woman's belt.\n\n2) I recently started reading \"The Lives of Dax\" for Deep Space Nine. Steven Barnes has an excellent little tale of a young Ben Sisko accompaning Curzon Dax as his aide. Very well done story. I'm quite hopeful for The Cestus Deception and to see how he plays in LFL's sandbox.\n\nI believe he is. If he's not then all of the people posting in the OS thread for The Cestus Deception-originally titled \"First African American to write a Star Wars book\"-were very, very mistaken"
