        "text": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nFor centuries, storytellers have been telling and retelling the tale of King Arthur, Camelot, and the knights of the Round Table. Author Lev Grossman, best known for his Magicians trilogy, felt like it was time to give Arthur an update for the modern world. His Arthurian epic, The Bright Sword, which was a decade in the making, is finally out now.\n\n\"Some things about Arthur feel eternal: The sense that of a departing golden age that we just missed. Humans have always felt that way. There's something in Arthur about trying to be better than you are, the sense that they're all striving to be these great pure holy knights and really knowing that they can't achieve that,\" Grossman tells T&C.\n\nReaders, he says, have always been drawn to the story of Arthur because it reflects the world they live in. \"There's something strange about the Arthur story, and maybe almost unique, in that it's very old, it's very fundamental to Western culture, but it has this strange power of transforming: It becomes a very different story over time. When Marion told it [Marion Zimmer Bradley wrote The Mists of Avalon in 1983], when Tennyson told it [Alfred Tennyson wrote the poems Idylls of the King in the 1860s], when the Welsh poets told it in the sixth century, these stories were about completely different things,\" he says. \"Even though it was the same story, it becomes about the world in which you're telling it, and that's fascinating, too. The Arthur story is a lens through which you can see more clearly the world that you're in.\"\n\nA few weeks before publication of The Bright Sword, Grossman spoke with T&C about finding the \"blank spaces\" in Arthur's story, leaning into magic, and what we can learn from Camelot in 2024.\n\nWhy did you want to want to write a King Arthur story for the new millennium?\n\nI grew up on The Once and Future King, that was probably my favorite book as a teenager. And after Mists of Avalon, after Winter King and Mary Stewart and Rosemary Sutcliffe... for a long time, I felt as though the Arthur story was complete and done. Then, oddly, as time went by, I began to feel as though the story—without having diminished in any way, it started to feel like it belonged to the past. Much the same way that Tolkien looks a little bit different after you've read Game of Thrones. When [Thrones author] George [R.R. Martin] did that, he reimagined the Tolkien tradition. It was more grounded, felt more contemporary. Obviously it's set in a quasi medieval world, but the brokenness of that world, the complexity, the shades of gray felt so familiar, like they belonged to this moment we're in now. I hadn't read that Arthur, the Arthur that felt like it belonged in our moment in that way. So, I started thinking about how you do that.\n\nWhere do you start when thinking about the Arthur that belongs in our moment?\n\nOne way to think about it is looking for the blank spaces on the map. One of the things that made The Once in Future King so genius was the way that [author T.H.] White began by telling the story of King Arthur's childhood. I didn't understand when I was a teenager that nobody had ever done that before—and all that stuff about Merlin being his tutor and living backwards and his squabbling with Kay and all that stuff, White just made it up! It made the story so fresh and real.\n\nSo I started thinking about whether there were any blank spaces still left. And I felt like there were two: One of them was the world after Arthur, which had never been satisfyingly written about. Arthur dies, he has no children. The throne passes easily and without any squabbling to his totally random cousin Constantine, who til then has been a completely minor character. I felt as though there's a succession crisis brewing here of Westerosian proportions, and it would be interesting to look at that, and look at that world.\n\nWhen I started thinking about that, I realized, well, hang on, there's hardly anybody left because after the Battle of Camlann—almost everybody dies in the Battle of Camlann. It's a real disaster, and there's only a few knights left. At first that seemed as though that was a fatal problem, but then I realized that once there was nobody left in the center of the stage, you could bring in people from the margins. You could bring in these stories that hadn't really been written about very much. And those were stories about people who were gay or trans or neurodivergent or disabled or not white. That was another blank space, basically the people in the margins.\n\nStories of succession are everywhere right now, including Succession and House of the Dragon. Why are you as an author fascinated by succession and why do you think readers are so interested by it?\n\nFor me, it's because it's about a family. Succession in that world, in the world of monarchies, it's about family. A way in for me, for Arthur, was to think of his story as a story about a terribly dysfunctional family—where the father had killed the mom's first husband and then forcibly married her. There were three stepchildren already, and then there was Arthur. Then, Arthur's own marriage to Guinevere, which in my mind is a happy one, but they had no children, and then they had Mordred who was this rogue, incestuous, illegitimate child running around. That's the story of this incredibly complicated toxic family, and it's also the story of Britain, of this nation, which was that family writ large—something very, very compelling about that. I grew up, myself, in a family with a somewhat larger-than-life, charismatic father, and certainly when I watched Succession, I recognize a lot of what I see. There's something about that story where you just can't look away.\n\nArthur’s story has been told and retold for 1,400 years, and no two tales are the same. What were some key elements you wanted to include? What makes it a tale of King Arthur?\n\nWhen I wrote The Magicians, The Magicians was a lot about having a little fun with different kind of fantasy tradition—the Narnia and the Harry Potter—and poking holes in it and making it seem grittier and more grounded and finding the absurdity in it, much the same way that Alan Moore did with Watchman. And that's how I began writing King Arthur. And that turned out to be exactly backwards, because the one thing, as it turns out about King Arthur, you don't want to cut him down to size, because then he stops being King Arthur. The beginning of it, as it turned out to be—took me probably two years to figure this out—that was King Arthur is a good man, he's a genius, he's a brilliant leader and king, and he's charismatic and he's good. So that had to be in there.\n\nThen, this was another thing I wavered about: God had to be in there. King Arthur is a very Christian story almost from its inception, and I felt as though the Holy Grail and God and angels had to be a part of the story. And there's Guinevere and Lancelot and that whole configuration. Then, of course, Arthur has to die. That's almost the defining thing in his life. Le Morte d'Arthur, the death of Arthur, it's all leading toward his fated doom. I mean, it's interesting the way the things that people have done with Arthur. There's versions of Arthur where Mordred is the hero. People have done almost every way of reconfiguring it. In some ways, mine is a very classic Arthur, and then in other ways not.\n\nBefore reading The Bright Sword, my knowledge of Arthur, etc. was the Camelot musical, which I tried to push out of my mind as I read. Are you going in with the assumption that your readers are familiar with Arthur and Camelot and the key characters?\n\nYou've always got an imaginary reader in your head when you're writing, and I feel as though you could come into it knowing relatively little about Arthur. I definitely tried to include a lot of exposition about Arthur's life and what happened. And of course, even though it's in the world after Arthur's death, Arthur makes many cameo appearances.\n\nCamelot, the musical, I'm a fan. I would never say anything negative about the musical, which is based off of The Once In Future King. The only thing I'll say about it is, I didn't see the revival of it, but I remember reading that when Aaron Sorkin went over the script, he took out all the magic and he decided it was just going to be a real world story, which is definitely a school of thought. But I felt as though that was great and I wanted to go the other way and do a much more romantic Arthur, a fantasy Arthur, where there was lots of magic.\n\nThe great thing about Arthur's world that makes it so weird and exciting is that it's got a ton of magic and fairy in it, and it's also got God in it. It has these two different flavors of supernatural power that are co-present in it. Somebody famous called Arthur's world a hybrid world. And it is a hybrid world, and I wanted to lean into that. I feel very comfortable writing about magic, maybe less so about God, but I got comfortable with writing about angels, definitely. Mostly, when people write about Arthur, those two powers, when one of them comes on stage, the other one goes away and they circle each other, but they rarely interact. I wanted them to confront each other and face off against each other.\n\nThe other layer of The Bright Sword is the history of sixth century Britain. What was your research process like into the history of Arthur's time?\n\nIt definitely was a journey because I'm not a historian by any stretch of the imagination, and I had a lot to learn about that world. And it only gets more interesting when you read about it. And the first thing you learn about it is that Arthur's world was a post-apocalypse world. The Romans had occupied Britain for three and a half centuries and then they left relatively suddenly. When they left, Britain collapsed into ruins and the whole country was littered with these buildings, towns, roads, aqueducts, baths, and temples that the Romans had built that immediately began to fall to ruin. And that was the world they lived in! It was as though an advanced civilization had come to Earth and then left and took all its technology with it, and everybody was left living in the rubble. That was Arthur's world. That was the world of the dark ages.\n\nThe final line of the novel, “we are made for a bright world, but we live in a dark one,” stuck with me long after I put it down. What is it about releasing The Bright Sword in 2024 that feels timely?\n\nOne thing I'm very aware of is it is how divided America is. There's so much passion and feeling about who should be in charge of it. We're not really having a succession crisis, but it feels a little bit like that. It feels like many countries are sharply divided against themselves—and that was Arthur's Britain. Arthur's Britains was split in half between the Celts and the Romanized Celts and the Pagans and the Christians, the old and the new, the north and the south. It's a story about this country that is trying to be whole, and I recognize a lot about that in the world right now. And, it was a moment in time where there were many displaced and disenfranchised peoples. Britain was a post-colonial place, and there were vast populations moving around and being forced out of one place and into another, and I recognize that, too. That's something that's happening now.\n\nWould you want to continue writing in this world?\n\nI don't know. This book took me a very long time to write. I mean, an absurdly long time to write, if I'm being honest. It took me about 10 years. Arthur and I, we need some time apart, but there's no bottom to the world. There's just more and more in it, and so many bits I didn't even get to.\n\nWhat do you hope readers take away from this version of Arthur?\n\nOne of the important things to me about this book was that unlike most Arthur stories, it doesn't end with Arthur's death. The classic Arthur story is so much about his death and the ending of that world, and then the rest is darkness after that. There was something very appealing for me about writing about the people who had to live on in the world after Arthur, in that broken world where God is absent, the center hasn't held—because that's our world. The Bright Sword is very much about that hinge moment where we pass out of the age of legend and into the real world that we have to live in, and it turns out you can live in it! Which isn't obvious from the classic Arthur story, and it requires lots of robustness and compromise, but it can be done.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
