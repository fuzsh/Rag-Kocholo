Beowulf's terrifying quest to destroy the foul ﬁend Grendel, his mother a hideous sea-hag, and a monstrous ﬁre-dragon is the oldest surviving epic in British literature. Artfully retold and magniﬁcently illustrated, Beowulf is made instantly accessible to children by a formidable children's book partnership."
