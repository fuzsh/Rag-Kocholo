        "text": "The single largest category of Beowulf representation and adaptation, outside of direct translation of the poem, is children’s literature. Over the past century and a half, more than 150 new versions of Beowulf directed to child and teen audiences have appeared, in English and in many other languages. In this collection of original essays, Bruce Gilchrist and Britt Mize examine the history and processes of remaking Beowulf for young readers.\n\nInventive in their manipulations of story, tone, and genre, these adaptations require their authors to make countless decisions about what to include, exclude, emphasize, de-emphasize, and adjust. This volume considers the many forms of children’s literature, focusing primarily on picture books, illustrated storybooks, and youth novels, but taking account also of curricular aids, illustrated full translations of the poem, and songs. Contributors address issues of gender, historical context, war and violence, techniques of narration, education, and nationalism, investigating both the historical and theoretical dimensions of bringing Beowulf to child audiences.\n\nIntroduction: Beowulf in and near Children’s Literature\n\nBritt Mize\n\n1. “A Little Shared Homer for England and the North”: The First Beowulf for Young Readers\n\nMark Bradshaw Busbee\n\n2.

Children’s Versions of Beowulf: A Bibliography\n\nBruce Gilchrist\n\n\"Beowulf as Children’s Literature is a brilliant, groundbreaking collection of essays that provide intriguing insights into why and how, of all the disparate genres, forms, and media into which the Old English poem Beowulf has been transposed, children’s literature takes pride of place as the largest single category of post-Beowulfian adaptation. As a collective, it addresses both the theory and method of the adaptation for children of a canonical text, and so makes a major contribution to study of children’s literature, even as it breaks new, fertile ground in the area of Beowulfiana.\"\n\nDavid F. Johnson, Professor of English, Florida State University\n\n\"The essays in Beowulf as Children’s Literature reveal the powerful role the Old English epic has played in children’s imaginative lives since the early nineteenth century. Through close studies of picture books and young adult novels, film and teaching aids, the book’s contributors show how Beowulf has been used to convey ideas of gender, race, class, and nation to audiences just learning to read. Carefully contextualized and extensively illustrated, this volume provides a rich trove of materials for future study of early medieval literary reception.\"\n\nIrina Dumitrescu, Professor of English Medieval Studies, University of Bonn\n\n\"A treasure trove of riches, this generously illustrated collection of sophisticated, penetrating essays marks a remarkably rare achievement in Beowulf scholarship: a genuine first word in a new conversation. Dazzlingly curated by Gilchrist and Mize, contributions range from Beowulf’s earliest known adaptation for children in 1820 to the present day. Scholars of Beowulf, of reception, of medievalism, and of children’s literature will want this essential book on their shelves.\"\n\nChris Jones, Professor of English, University of St Andrews"
