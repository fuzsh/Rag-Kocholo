But this apparent opposition is the work of cultural narrative and ideology. That is, culturally speaking, we have been taught to ascribe so-called “masculine” characteristics like objectivity, neutrality, and logic to the “hard” practices of coding, and the so-called “feminine” characteristics of subjectivity, bias, and emotional affect to the \"soft\" practices of textile crafting. Yet if we probe digital coding and textile crafting, we see that these practices are more alike than we might expect. Consider, for instance, the digital computer’s binary logic of 1s and 0s that is also present in the knitted system of knits and purls, or that both craftwork and codework emerge through systems of advanced mathematics, rely on generative and procedural logic, and operate as repositories for cultural memory. In addition to exploring these connections, we will also think about some of the divergences between the machinic and the handcraft, such the temporality of slow vs. fast fashion, the environmental impacts of textile production, the cultural division of art from craft, and machinic limitations of craft practices (spoiler: unlike knit and embroidery, crochet cannot be done by a machine).\n\nIn this class, we will critically and creatively make codework and craftwork, to explore relationship between these two hands-on storytelling practices. Students in this class can expect to learn the basics of knitting, crochet, embroidery, and machine sewing, and do not need to have any prior knowledge of these crafts. We will interface this craftwork with computational codework through practices like data analysis and visceralization, programming with Arduino Lilypad, and writing craft-generation programs in Tracery and Twine.\n\nDCD*302*01: Visual Methods (Eapen)\n\nAn intermediate course that provides students with an in-depth exploration of the theories and practicum of visual and verbal elements used by visual communicators. This course will build on the issues found in relation to cultural shifts in aesthetic trends and consumer behavior while also discussing solutions created by visual communicators and the software tools used.\n\nDCD*304*Q1: Interactive Methods “Book Arts and Embodied Experience: Physical, Digital, and AI Interactivity (Mukamal)\n\nThis Interactive Methods course explores building community and empowering social change through the tradition of bookmaking—and probes the future of book arts in the age of AI. We create book arts projects, which may or may not look like traditional “books,” that not only convey information, but also communicate complex embodied experiences through the physicality of the object itself. We insist on physical fabrication because, in the age of AI, creating is paradoxically both more precarious and more important than ever. We begin by exploring how handmade books and bookish cultural objects (e.g. zines, pamphlets) have historically functioned in (often marginalized) communities by empowering individuals to share their embodied knowledge with others. Often, DIY makers create these objects to build community around shared experiences in an effort to effect cultural change. In keeping with this tradition, we frame book arts as a powerful resource for each of us to share our own stories.\n\nWe make book arts projects on topics that matter to us (like fashion, mental health, body image, sports, politics, video games… anything that interests you). For each project, we journey from most physical to most artificial: (first) physically making, (second) digitizing using photography and videography; and (third) putting generative AI interfaces to work to create their own versions of our projects. Along the way, we learn how to engineer prompts for interfaces like DALL-E 3 (made by OpenAI, creator of ChatGPT). We also think in a meta-way about how we interact with physical artifacts, digitizations, and AI systems, and consider how these different interactions affect the squishy boundary between “human-made” and “AI-made.” By embodying this trajectory from human-made to AI-made, we explore deep questions about the meaning and purpose of art: What is human about art? What does it mean that it takes us time to create, while AI can do so seemingly instantly? Is the value of art in the making process or in experiencing the product?\n\nThis hands-on, multidisciplinary course interfaces with Dr. Mukamal’s related 2024-25 Professional Enhancement Grant. It features collaborations with and visits from her grant team, Meghan O’Connor (Associate Professor of Visual Arts), who specializes in printmaking, and Loren Mixon (Academic Engagement & Outreach Librarian, University Libraries), who specializes in zine cultures. The final project is a “curated digital gallery” website with all book arts projects, digitizations, and AI-generated work. Standout work will be invited for feature in our inaugural Spring 2025 Book Arts Week on campus and in exhibition spaces throughout the local Conway and Myrtle Beach communities.\n\nDCD*309*01: Interactivity and Culture (Mukamal)\n\nIn this course, we explore how people interact around big issues such as mental health, de-stigmatization, and advocacy. We focus on how Generation Z views mental health as compared to older generations and what their unique perspective means for how we interact around mental health in public spaces, from online communities to schools to higher education. We study historical shifts in news ecosystems pre- and post-digital revolution, tracing the decline of print and the rise of social media as predominant cultural forums for debating contemporary political, social, and economic issues. We analyze trends such as a) data-driven study of mental health disparities and treatment access, b) connections between mental health and stressors like gender-based violence, economic instability, gun violence, and climate change, c) the swell in mental health activism, and d) digital mental health solutions, from apps to AI-powered chatbots. What do these trends mean for what digital interactivity can and can’t do to mitigate the mental health crisis? As we learn best practices for ethical data collection, analysis, display, and interpretation, you’ll craft your own research topic on any topic that matters to you, design an online poll of your chosen population, produce interactive data visualizations of your results using industry-standard software (Tableau), and share your findings in a semester-end symposium. You’ll leave this course empowered to use data to advocate for change.\n\nDCD*312*01: Social Media (Laiola)\n\nIn this course, we are going to critically and creatively engage with digital social media, focusing in particular on the myriad ways they affect on- and offline culture, and the potentials they introduce for critical and creative expression. We will learn about the rich history of digital social media and \"web 2.0,\" noting in particular the ways key platforms relate to and differ from one another in the ways they invite, cajole, and even force us to participate and socialize with them. As well, we will think about the cultural feedback loops, whereby online culture influences offline culture and vice versa, and the ways front-end expectations, rhetoric, and aesthetics are influenced by algorithmic logic and codes. Finally, while this class's focus is NOT marketing or branding, students will have many opportunities to create content for different platforms and study they ways content moves across these platforms.\n\nDCD*488*Q1: Capstone Course (Laiola)\n\nThis course serves as a culminating experience for the program of study in this degree, allowing the student to bring together all the skills and knowledge acquired in the courses to produce and publish online a project of his/her own design. This course has the following co-requisites: DCD 495 or DCD 496.\n\nDCD*496*Q1: Social Media Practicum (Laiola and Sobota)\n\nA hands-on, practice-based \"course,\" where 4-5 DCD and English students will work closely with faculty advisors to create content for, manage, and strategize the ENGL and DCD social media platforms. Students should be critically familiar and engaged with Instagram, Twitter, and Tiktok, as they will be responsible for creating content to represent the English and DCD programs in these spaces. They will learn about social media analytics, growing and cultivating audiences, and the ins and outs of managing a social media presence for a brand or company. Note: This class is by instructor permission, and students who have taken Dr. Laiola's DCD 312: Social Media class are particularly encouraged to enroll.\n\nENGL*300*01: Critical Conversations in English: Print and Identity (Lowery)\n\nThis course ciphers through the messiness of nineteenth-century periodical culture to examine definitions and representations of African-American print culture. We will explore overlooked voices and materials from marginalized communities, seeking to understand the complexities of African American literary production. We will use interdisciplinary methods that have both shaped and responded to approaches in African-American print culture in the nineteenth century and beyond. By delving into both familiar and unfamiliar archives, we will uncover hidden narratives and confront silences that pervade historical newspapers. Part of our work will be to focus on how authors shaped their own identities through print and media and the ways texts have shaped and reshaped perceptions of African American identity, sometimes beyond the author’s control.\n\nThe class culminates in a project that aims to reveal forgotten histories and stories that enrich our breadth of diverse voices. By illuminating these overlooked narratives, we can challenge and expand conventional knowledge of African American print culture for the present and future.\n\nENGL*301*D1: Forms of Creative Writing (Ockert)\n\nIn this online-only distance learning course students examine the history, movements, and technical forms of poetry, fiction, and creative nonfiction using a combination of example readings and writing workshops.\n\nENGL*332*01: Perspectives on American Literature and Culture (Hamelman)\n\nStudents and instructor study American literature and culture from the perspective of antinomianism (the act of dissent/disobedience/resistance). We focus on key points of this topic, with attention on overlap between and among authors and texts, from the canonical to the contemporary. Our immersion in poetry, fiction, non-fiction, video, and other genres reveals the fluid and complementary nature of literature and culture, the intertextuality of them, the ceaseless borrowing and border-crossing that occur between and among authors, genres, historical periods, social movements, and themes. Our course features interactive and diverse approaches to assessment, from traditional papers to collaborations that encourage engagement with American texts and their literary/cultural contexts.\n\nENGL*334*01: Perspectives on British Literature and Culture: Empire and Its Legacies (Port)\n\nThis section of ENGL 334 traces the expansion and decline of the British empire, centering on its cultural significance and ongoing legacies in texts from the nineteenth century to the present day. We explore how personal and political landscapes intersect in a range of works, including fiction, poetry, drama, film, theoretical writing, and music. Our discussions investigate how national and postcolonial identities have been constructed and challenged over time through a compelling range of voices and narratives. Some of the topics we’ll discuss include: the politics of language; discourses of race and gender; commerce and consumption; love and sexuality; and competing forms of power, influence, and resistance. Texts include a selection of colonial and postcolonial works centering on Ireland (W. B. Yeats, James Joyce, Brian Friel); the Indian subcontinent (Rudyard Kipling, E. M. Forster, Salman Rushdie); Africa (Joseph Conrad, Chinua Achebe, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o); the Caribbean (Jamaica Kincaid, Louise Bennett, Derek Walcott) and contemporary, multicultural Britain (Linton Kwesi Johnson, Hanif Kureishi, Andrea Levy, Kamila Shamsie). Throughout, we’ll consider how literary culture serves as a means both for expanding imperial influence and for countering it.\n\nENGL*335*D1: Perspectives on World Literature and Anglophone Literatures and Cultures: Magic Realism (Oldfield)\n\nIn this course we'll be reading world literature in translation with a focus on fiction that chooses to interact with lived human experience in imaginative ways - folkloric, psychological, surrealistic, speculative, magical, weird. Although geographies are in the imaginary, the course will include authors from Latin America, Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Europe/Eurasia. Some of the featured (real) authors include Julio Cortazar, Haruki Murakami, Sharnush Parsipur, Suzanne Césaire, Bruno Shultz, and Anna Akhmatova. The course will consist of reading, discussion and writing.\n\nENGL*341*01: African-American Lit, 1750-pre (Lowery)\n\nThis course surveys the African-American literary tradition, covering the periods of the antebellum U.S., slavery, post-Reconstruction, the Harlem Renaissance, the Black Arts Movement, and postmodernism. Using various genres from and beyond the canon, we will explore the past and the history of African American literary production to engage with speculative futures. Many of our readings will explore topics of resistance to racism and gender discrimination as well as topics about Black life, love, identity, and futures. We will also work to understand the major themes of the African-American literary tradition. These include double-consciousness, uplift, signifying, and more recent speculative understandings of Black futures. Students may take this course to fulfill their English major and minor requirements, and most reading materials will be provided on Moodle.\n\nENGL*350*01: Language Variation in North America (Hasty)\n\nWhy do those people up North (i.e., Yankees) talk the way they do? How can those people in the South (i.e., Rednecks) sound so nice yet still so dumb? Why don't the people out West have an accent? Do I have an accent? In this course, we will answer all these questions and more. We will study the differences in the varieties of North American English from a scientific perspective being guided by contemporary sociolinguistic theory. While regional variation is one of the most salient aspects of American English, we will also study social, ethnic, gender, and style-related language variation. Along with understanding how different varieties of English are linguistically different from each other, we will also explore issues related to the social evaluation of individual dialects regarding the perceptions and attitudes of speakers and hearers of these varieties. We will address issues related to the so-called \"Standard\" English ideology and even seek to uncover linguistic profiling and discrimination. The course will be discussion based and will involve a good deal of classroom participation and presentation. Students will be asked to complete original sociolinguistic research by collecting data on actual real-world language variation and presenting their findings in both oral and written form.\n\nENGL*351*01: Language, Gender and Power (Fleckenstein)\n\nThis course investigates language structure and usage patterns in the context of gender to achieve a better understanding of the way language contributes to the creation and understanding of our social world. We will examine how individuals use language to reflect, construct, and perform gender identities. Students will become familiar with a wide range of studies exploring the intersection between language and gender in a range of different contexts including informal talk among friends and talk in work or public settings. The course encourages a critical engagement with past and present approaches to the study of language and gender and draws on a range of different theoretical and methodological frameworks to show how gender and identity can be analyzed in language\n\nENGL*355*01: Introduction to Discourse Analysis (Fleckenstein)\n\nThis course is an introduction to the close analysis of discourse, focusing initially and primarily on conversational discourse while also branching out to consider other types of interaction (e.g., institutional, online, and media discourse). Throughout this course, we will address questions related to discourse in terms of identity (how identities are reflected, created, negotiated, and repaired through talk), relationships (such as how people negotiate hierarchy and equality in interaction), meaning (how meanings are jointly created or not understood), social action (such as how speakers use language to criticize and apologize), culture (the interrelationship between language use and culture), technology (such as how social media is – and is not – changing discourse), as well as social problems (e.g., racial and gender discrimination) and social issues (such as the role of the English language in the U.S.).\n\nENGL*362*01: Fiction I (Ockert)\n\nAn introductory creative writing workshop course in which students study published contemporary short stories and create original works of short fiction. Students read and critique both published and student work.\n\nENGL*368*01: Poetry I (Hensel)\n\nAn introductory creative writing workshop course in which students study published contemporary poetry and create original poems. Students read and critique both published and student work.\n\nENGL*411*Q1: English Capstone Seminar (Boyle)\n\nThis class serves as the summative experience representing a student’s progress through and completion of the English degree. It provides a forum for both reflection upon and assessment of the student’s experience in the major. Assignments focus principally on the production of a professional level portfolio that students may utilize in a postgraduate context. Students revise and create written assignments and samples; video and media-ready resumes; and practice telling their professional stories for a variety of audiences. Students are introduced to guest speakers that help them prepare for graduate school; construct a profile through writing and media; and attend events like the English Futures Speaker Series, where they hear from professionals and scholars who have translated their humanities training into an exciting spectrum of opportunities.\n\nThe course also includes activities designed to help the department assess its program as well as the opportunity for an exit interview.\n\nENGL*459*01 Advanced Composition and Rhetoric (Howes)\n\nThis course introduces the theories that structure the field of Composition and Rhetoric to advance students’ knowledge and build vocabulary to discuss reading, writing, and how texts function in the social world. We will combine this theory with practice by writing using different genres and developing research skills. These methods will allow students to explore questions about ways language connects to how we see others and ourselves, critically interrogating literacy learning, discourse communities, and rhetorical theory. Implementing process-based writing will also encourage students to cultivate content and clarity in their writing by working through multiple drafts and learning about effective revision strategies.\n\nENGL*483*01: Theory of Literary Criticism (Smith)\n\nThis course will survey major figures and discussions surrounding critical and literary theory in the 20th century. From the New Critics to the Frankfort School, from Du Bois to Deleuze, we will spend the semester parsing out the relationship between theory and criticism and what both can tell us about how we engage literature today. Throughout the semester you will also have opportunities to put literary theory into practice by producing your own readings of fiction, poetry, and drama. Please email csmith8@coastal.edu if you have any questions.\n\nENGL*485*D1: Adolescent Literature (Arnold)\n\nYoung adult literature is one of the fastest-growing segments of the publishing industry right now. At the same time, most of the books banned or challenged in the United States over the last year are books written for young adults, and most of those banned books portray the experiences of LGBTQ+ people, people of color, or other culturally marginalized and historically under-represented populations. In ENGL 485, students will focus on these important trends and tensions in contemporary books written for middle- and high-school readers, while exploring a wide variety of genres and forms, including realistic fiction, fantasy, verse, and graphic novels. Along the way, we will build expertise in critically reading, categorizing, analyzing, and evaluating young adult texts, using current scholarship, book awards, booklists, and other tools. Whether you plan to teach, you are considering becoming a librarian, or you want to learn more about the growing field of young adult literature, this course will inform and challenge you. ENGL 485 is a distance-learning course in an online, asynchronous format, which requires high-speed internet access, an up-to-date device and web browser, and access to the Moodle learning management system.\n\nENGL*489*01: Gender and Sexuality in Literature: Subversive Pleasures: Histories and Theories of ‘Deviance’ (Pillai)\n\nIn this course we will address two persistently controversial and interconnected questions that inform our expressions, experiences, and performances of gender and sexuality: What is deviance? And what is pleasure? In engaging with these questions, we will also address the historical, socio-cultural, economic, legal, political, philosophical, and psychological contexts within which both pleasure and deviance are defined, challenged, and reimagined. Our studies and conversations will hinge on our ability to identify and unearth the often complicated and intersecting logics of individual and collective identity that inform all our notions of pleasure (and pain) and deviance (and conformity). Throughout the semester we will study diverse visual, literary, and theoretical texts—movies/series and music videos, short stories and poems, and excerpts of works by theorists of gender and sexuality—and juxtapose the commonsense and uncommonsense understandings of deviance and pleasure explored within these works.\n\nThis is a cross-listed course: students may take this course to fulfill requirements for their ENGL and/or WGST minor or major. No book purchase is needed for this course. Reading/viewing materials will be made available to you on Moodle. Contact tpillai@coastal.edu if you have any questions about the course.\n\nSpring 2023\n\nDCD and ENGL 300 & 400 Level\n\nDCD*300*01: Special Topics in Critical Studies (Mukamal)\n\nThis special topics course takes a digital approach to a much debated phenomenon: book banning in the 21st century American education system. We use text methods to evaluate whether the reasons cited for banning books actually corresponds with books’ content; visual methods to explore the books’ messaging and marketing (Bookstagram) and data visualization tools to break down when, where, and why books are banned and which authors and identities are disproportionately affected; accessible sound and motion methods through BookTok debates; and methods of social media analytics to understand how peoples’ choice to read banned books and talk about this reading online influences their belief systems, advocacy, and activism. Because the numbers reveal that literature written for young people is central to these debates, we focus on banned young adult (YA) books from Angie Thomas’s The Hate U Give (2017) to Adib Khorram’s Darius the Great is Not Okay (2018). We also break down current research about the multifaceted impacts of YA literature to better grasp the stakes of book banning for this population. As the final project, students choose their own banned book from any time period and genre and study it through their own combination of text, visual, sound and motion, and social media analytical methods. Students leave this course empowered to understand and participate in the complex, vital, and ongoing cultural conversation about book banning.\n\nDCD*302*01: Visual Effects (Benn)\n\nThis course surveys visual production methods across multiple forms of media, including film, graphic novels and comics, paintings, videogames, and memes. We will examine the technical affordances of each medium, considering how visual representation is specific to form. From camera angles and directorial decisions about how a shot is framed to the (re)production of images in memes, students will understand how each visual format uses its unique characteristics to communicate. Additionally, students will be introduced to a broad array of visual tools and encouraged to produce their own projects inspired by the theoretical material covered in class.\n\nDCD*312*01: Social Media (Laiola)\n\nIn this course, we are going to critically and creatively engage with digital social media, focusing in particular on the myriad ways they affect on- and offline culture, and the potentials they introduce for critical and creative expression. We will learn about the rich history of digital social media and \"web 2.0,\" noting in particular the ways key platforms relate to and differ from one another in the ways they invite, cajole, and even force us to participate and socialize with them. As well, we will think about the cultural feedback loops, whereby online culture influences offline culture and vice versa, and the ways front-end expectations, rhetorics, and aesthetics are influenced by algorithmic logic and codes. Finally, while this class's focus is NOT marketing or branding, students will have many opportunities to create content for different platforms and study they ways content moves across these platforms.\n\nDCD*316*01: Digital Resources in the Humanities (Mukamal)\n\nIn this intermediate course, we explore creative ways that digital resources in the humanities can highlight underrecognized cultural contributions by individuals marginalized on the basis of intersectional identity factors such as gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, nationality and citizenship status, ability, religion, language, and more. We both examine cutting-edge humanities-centered interdisciplinary projects and create our own projects through a process of critical making. For example, we study the history of feminism and civil rights through interdisciplinary databases including ProQuest’s Historical Newspapers and Women’s Magazine Archive; we engage electronic texts by examining the gender dimensions of instapoetry and both critiquing and contributing original work to the online fan fiction site Archive of Our Own (AO3); we build our own collaborative digital history project using mapping resources; we discover how data visualization software can build awareness around exclusions and inequities; and we investigate how new media projects as widespread as BookTok promote change-making cultural dialogue about issues of representation. We round out the semester with a hands-on critical making experience in the FabLab and Kimbel Library Makerspace.\n\nDCD*488*Q1: Capstone Course (Laiola)\n\nThis course is to be taken by DCD majors in their final semester at Coastal, and serves as the culminating experience for the DCD major. Students will gather together all of the work they have done throughout their time in DCD, preparing it for inclusion in a public-facing, professional portfolio of work that tells the story of who they are as DCD professionals. In this way, the course supports students as they transition from their roles as DCD students to that of DCD professionals.\n\nDCD*496*Q1: Social Media Practicum (Laiola)\n\nA hands-on, practice-based \"course,\" where 4-5 students will work closely with faculty advisors to create content for, manage, and strategize the ENGL and DCD social media platforms. Students should be critically familiar and engaged with Instagram, Twitter, and Tiktok, as they will be responsible for creating content to represent the English and DCD programs in these spaces. They will learn about social media analytics, growing and cultivating audiences, and the ins and outs of managing a social media presence for a brand or company. Students who have taken Dr Laiola's DCD 312: Social Media class are particularly encouraged to enroll.\n\nENGL*300*01: Critical Conversations in English (Paster)\n\nENGL 300 provides students with an introduction to our major and to English Studies in more general terms. This course invites you to examine critical issues and questions current in our discipline with your classmates. At the same time, you will also think extensively about the writing, reading, and research practices that will support genuine meaning making and inquiry as you take classes across the English major. In addition to considering some of the major disciplines that make up English Studies, you will read a rich set of varied texts that introduce these areas (like composition, creative writing, linguistics, and literature), attend the English Future Speakers Events so you get a sense of the varied job opportunities the major can lead to, and analyze undergraduate student research in English to analyze how others are entering the field. This work will help you identify areas of interest and inquiry that resonate with you.\n\nENGL*301*01: Forms of Creative Writing (Liebeck)\n\nA course that introduces the fundamentals of composing poetry, fiction, creative nonfiction and other types of creative writing. An exploratory approach is taken using a combination of contemporary readings, technique-focused studio days, group excursions, sharing, and critique. The course will culminate in the creation of an individual portfolio, and an alternative publication project involving the whole class.\n\nENGL*301*D1: Forms of Creative Writing (Liebeck)\n\nA distance learning course that introduces the fundamentals of composing poetry, fiction, creative nonfiction and other types of creative writing. An exploratory approach is taken using a combination of contemporary readings, technique-focused instruction, sharing, and critique. The course will culminate in the creation of an individual portfolio, and an alternative publication project involving the whole class.\n\nENGL*311*01: Topics in Shakespeare-Claiming Shakespeare, Queering Shakespeare for Our World and Our Fabulous Future (Pillai)\n\nThis course may be taken by ENGL, THEA, WGST, and EDUC majors/minors for fulfillment of program requirements.\n\nAs humans hurtle towards the second quarter of the 21st century, our critical consciousness expands to grapple with our growing complexities as individuals, cultures, and communities. We might wonder how our identities and practices can remain relevant in the future that is ahead of us. Along with the four Cs of “critical thinking,” “communication,” “collaboration,” and “creativity” that will become increasingly crucial factors in our wellbeing, our ability to adapt to the many changes around us will be vital to our relevance and growth in the 21st and 22nd centuries. This is where studying “Shakespeare” comes in handy. For centuries, cancel culture has failed to shut down “Shakespeare” because Shakespearean storytelling—on the page, the stage, and on screens—has adapted to, reflected, and anticipated the various changes in our societies and environments. Shakespeare has remained a fabulously transformative, cultural artifact that continues to be malleable and manipulable. In this course we will explore 21st century cultures and practices of Shakespearean storytelling. Specifically, we will study queer and feminist global adaptations, that is, appropriations and remediations that reclaim Shakespearean drama to make it not simply relevant to our present and future but fabulously urgent representations of our time.\n\nNo book purchase needed: reading and viewing materials will be made available online. No prior knowledge of Shakespeare needed.\n\nENGL*332*01: Perspectives on American Literature and Culture-Octavia Butler’s Speculative Fiction (Lowery)\n\nDeemed the godmother of Afrofuturism, the celebrated African American writer Octavia Butler left behind a career that changed the science-fiction world entirely after her unexpected passing in 2006. As the first ever science fiction writer to receive the MacArthur Fellowship, Butler wrote with an eye toward the future and consistently offered an honest observation of humanity. Though one of a few Black women writers publishing in the white-male dominated science fiction genre, Butler transcended conventions and offered outlooks on not only issues of race, gender, sex, and power, but of empathy, social normativity, environmentalism, and many more. This course will examine Butler’s work alongside some of her contemporaries, Samuel R. Delany, and Charles Saunders, as well as those inspired by it to contextualize the impact of her body of work in the twentieth century. Butler’s legacy, as students will see, speaks for itself as she is an early pillar of Afrofuturism.\n\nENGL*334*01: Perspectives on British Literature and Culture-The Arthurian Tradition: From Gawain to Tom (Ennis)\n\nKing Arthur is the single most significant figure in British literature and culture, and the influence of Arthurian legend has endured for over 1500 years. Whether Arthur is a 5th-century Celtic warrior, the ideal of a noble king, a wronged husband, a Christian champion, or a supernatural demigod depends upon who is doing the telling. From the Round Table to Merlin, from the scandal of Lancelot and Guinevere to the quest for the Holy Grail, we’ll discuss how Arthurian material has been appropriated, assimilated, and modified by different traditions and audience preoccupations. Readings of the legend will include Geoffrey of Monmouth’s 12th-century account, Sir Thomas Malory’s 15th-century prose version, the Welsh inflected nineteenth century take by Felicia Hemans, and the “Victorian Arthur” of Alfred Lord Tennyson. We will also make space for humorous and satirical versions, since as Henry Fielding’s popular 1731 play The Tragedy of Tragedies; or The Life and Death of Tom Thumb the Great. The final part of the class will allow us to sample contemporary takes on the material, so be prepared to discuss your favorite version(s) of Arthur!\n\nENGL*338*01: Perspectives on a Single Author: Edgar Allan Poe (Hamelman)\n\nNotwithstanding many personal and professional difficulties, Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) carved out a canonical place in American literature and culture. He is that rare author whose imagination appeals to readers of all ages and whose works continually adapt to new historical and social conditions. A perennial touchstone author of American gothic/horror fiction, Poe also mastered other genres such as lyric poetry and satire/hoax, and he more or less originated the detective tale, whose offshoots include innumerable crime dramas pervading American television and cinema. Finally, as a theorist, Poe stood out, arguing against the “heresy of the didactic” common in mid-nineteenth-century popular poetry. In this course we close-read many examples from these genres, analyze Poe’s aesthetics, and contextualize his creations not only in his own era of print but also in our digital/virtual world, where interest in his “relatable” themes and tropes has not diminished.\n\nENGL*350*01: Language Variation in America (Hasty)\n\nWhy do those people up North (i.e., Yankees) talk the way they do? How can those people in the South (i.e., Rednecks) sound so nice yet still so dumb? Why don't the people out West have an accent? Do I have an accent? In this course, we will answer all these questions and more. We will study the differences in the varieties of North American English from a scientific perspective being guided by contemporary sociolinguistic theory. While regional variation is one of the most salient aspects of American English, we will also study social, ethnic, gender, and style-related language variation. Along with understanding how different varieties of English are linguistically different from each other, we will also explore issues related to the social evaluation of individual dialects regarding the perceptions and attitudes of speakers and hearers of these varieties. We will address issues related to the so-called \"Standard\" English ideology and even seek to uncover linguistic profiling and discrimination. The course will be discussion based and will involve a good deal of classroom participation and presentation. Students will be asked to complete original sociolinguistic research by collecting data on actual real-world language variation and presenting their findings in both oral and written form.\n\nENGL*365*01: Creative Nonfiction I (Hanafi)\n\nThis writing workshop is focused on process, with plenty of room for experimentation. We'll read and discuss works of creative nonfiction in print, digital, and visual forms, and encounter different, often innovative, methods of research and arrangement. You'll experiment with creative ways of doing research and generating material, such as being outdoors, browsing the internet, talking, and playing games of chance. As a group, we'll work on getting and giving feedback that's suited to wherever we are in the process. The workshop can be useful for both artists and writers; the skills and techniques you'll develop might be applied to artmaking in many forms.\n\nENGL*382*01: Contemporary Fiction (Port)\n\nIn this course, we will read some of the most compelling and influential works of fiction published in the late-twentieth and twenty-first centuries. We’ll explore their diverse literary strategies and investigate how they respond to the unsettling social, political, and technological developments of recent years. Our readings will include multicultural voices of post-imperial Britain and former colonies. They will address urgent concerns such as ideologies of gender, sexuality, race, and nationalism; the climate crisis; the effects of rapid technological advancement; and ongoing reverberations of empire, war, and terrorism. Our novels and short stories will include selections from highly regarded authors such as Kamila Shamsie, Bernadine Evaristo, Kazuo Ishiguro, Margaret Atwood, Hanif Kureishi, Amitav Ghosh, Ian McEwan, Ali Smith, Hari Kunzru, and Abdulrazak Gurnah. While fiction can’t solve problems, it can help us help us understand, reframe, and respond to circumstances we face as individuals and on a collective scale. Studying these course texts together will provide an opportunity to reflect productively on individual choices and relationships as well as on some of the pressing challenges confronting our contemporary world.\n\nENGL*386*01: Topics in Contemporary Poetry-American Poetry, 1993-2023 (Albergotti)\n\nThis section of ENGL 386 will look specifically at American Poetry of the last 30 years. We will read broadly and in depth, sampling as much as we can while also trying to bring into focus a sharper view of the landscape of American poetry today. In addition to reading work by a wide variety of practicing poets on the page, we will also have the opportunity to speak with a number of them face-to-face via Zoom visits to our classroom. Part literary studies, part art appreciation, this course will dive deep into the rich diversity of contemporary practice in American poetry in a way that will be useful and illuminating to the student of literature, the aspiring poet, and—dare I say it?—the interested reader. While this is not specifically a creative writing class, students will have the opportunity to write poems to fulfill part of the course’s assignments.\n\nENGL*392*01: Writing in Professional and Public Setting (Sobota)\n\nStudents will explore writing that happens in the 21st century workplace, where close attention to audience, context and purpose guide a writer’s decisions. We’ll consider how writing occurs in government agencies, non-profit organizations, and educational institutions. Course methods will approach textual creation from an ethical and rhetorical perspective, considering ways texts interweave various threads: specialized and general knowledge; information, education and persuasion; public and community relations; and, importantly, citizenship and morality. We’ll analyze and create texts for both print and digital channels, including a feature story, a compilation, an opinion article, and a non-profit blog.\n\nENGL*411*Q1: English Capstone Seminar (Boyle)\n\nThis class serves as the summative experience representing a student’s progress through and completion of the English degree. It provides a forum for both reflection upon and assessment of the student’s experience in the major.\n\nAssignments focus principally on the production of a professional level portfolio that students may utilize in a postgraduate context. Students revise and create written assignments and samples; video and media-ready resumes; and practice telling their professional stories for a variety of audiences. Students are introduced to guest speakers that help them prepare for graduate school; construct a profile through writing and media; and attend events like the English Futures Speaker Series, where they hear from professionals and scholars who have translated their humanities training into an exciting spectrum of opportunities.\n\nThe course also includes activities designed to help the department assess its program as well as the opportunity for an exit interview.\n\nENGL*451*01: Introduction to the Study of Language and Modern Grammar (Fleckenstein)\n\nThis course is an introduction to the scientific study of the nature and structure of human Language — what we refer to as linguistics. We will go beyond providing an overview of the field, and will draw on real-world language data to emphasize the methods of linguistic analysis and ability in the areas of sound patterns (phonetics and phonology), words and word formation (morphology), sentence structure (syntax), meaning (semantics), and discourse. Over the course of this semester, we will demonstrate how complex and interesting the language system is and how social and historical factors can contribute to language variation and change.\n\nENGL*453*D1 Development of the English Language (Hasty)\n\nHistory of the English Language is an introduction to the field of Historical Linguistics, with a specific focus on the development of the English Language from its origins in Indo-European up to our current Present Day English. This course will provide you with the tools to do historical linguistic analysis in order to foster a deeper understanding of not only the history of the English language but also a knowledge of the methods through which this history was uncovered. By the end of the course, you should have an understanding of the following: how and why language changes, how to analyze and represent sounds graphically, how writing systems differ from each other and from speech, how and why languages are grouped together into families, and specific phonological, morphological, syntactic, and lexical differences between Old, Middle, Early Modern, and Present Day English. To foster and assess these objectives, you will complete a series of problem sets and exams which will ask you to apply historical linguistic analysis to real world language data.\n\nENGL*457*01: Form and Style in Writing (Kellogg)\n\nWhat do we mean by writing style? This class develops an understanding of style as a choice — or rather, as a set of choices. Every time you choose to write a sentence one way rather than another, you have made a stylistic choice. Your writing has attained a style, however, only when the set of the choices you make add up to something recognizable, consistent, and true. This course is an intensive workshop in improving prose style. We will cover research and citation styles (what many students mean by “style”), but we focus on improving your ability to compose sentences and paragraphs with wit, elegance, and power. We will cover issues of clarity, concision, coherence, cohesion, and other elements of practical style; control of sentence length, rhythm, and pacing; and a variety of rhetorical figures, including tropes of argument. You will both revise previously written pieces and compose new work.\n\nENGL*459*01 Advanced Composition and Rhetoric (Paster)\n\nAre you interested in writing? Want to take a close look at your writing process and experiment with some new strategies for producing, revising, and rethinking texts? Want to contextualize that work by learning about how the field of composition talks about the social activity of writing? Want to step into new genres as you reflect on all of the writing you compose? This section of ENGL 459 takes a hard look at writing, considering it as both a process and a product, as something we do and something we study. This course will give you an opportunity to build on your existing strategies for crafting a variety of texts as you experiment with approaches that are offered by scholars in the field of composition and rhetoric as “best practices.” In addition to examining (and often critiquing) the work often associated with writing for the college classroom and, in larger terms, academic contexts, this course will also introduce you to the academic field of Composition, a field you might not yet be familiar with. As you read a sampling of rhetorical and writing studies theory, you can expect to question the social and ideological nature of writing and, by extension, the complexities associated with communication and language use itself. As you do this, you will reflect critically on your own writing habits and experiment with new ways of crafting rhetorically effective and engaging pieces.\n\nENGL*462*02: Fiction II (Ockert)\n\nThis is an advanced course in fiction writing and in it we will analyze the multiple ways a short story can be written. You will write at least two original short pieces which will be read and critiqued by the entire class. Although it is impossible to teach you to be a great writer, it is possible to teach you the ways in which published writers have organized their thoughts and ideas onto the page. “Greatness,” I’m hoping, will rub off on you. Additionally, you’ll have the opportunity to read your peers’ writing in a workshop setting. Building on what you’ve learned in previous creative writing courses, we will study contemporary elements of style and seek to understand what makes a good short story good.\n\nENGL*468*01: Poetry II (Albergotti)\n\nAuden says that “poetry makes nothing happen.” Dickinson says it makes her feel “as if the top of [her] head were taken off.” Bishop says that producing it involves “hundreds of things coming together at the right moment.” And Pound says that our job in writing it is to “make it new.” In this workshop course, we’ll see if any or all of those poets are right. And we’ll do our best to say something ourselves, to contribute to a conversation that spans centuries. At the very least, we’ll create some works of art that did not exist before, and that’s usually a good thing. And if we’re very lucky, some of those works will live longer than us. That’s the goal, anyway. So let’s get together and try to make some “memorable speech” (that’s Auden again) by writing in lines as well as sentences. [Note: It is recommended, but not required, that students complete ENGL 368 before enrolling in ENGL 468.]\n\nENGL*483*01: Theory of Literary Criticism (Smith)\n\nThis course will survey major figures and discussions surrounding critical and literary theory in the 20th century. From the New Critics to the Frankfort School, from Du Bois to Deleuze, we will spend the semester parsing out the relationship between theory and criticism and what both can tell us about how we engage literature today. Throughout the semester you will also have opportunities to put literary theory into practice by producing your own readings of fiction, poetry, and drama. Please email csmith8@coastal.edu if you have any questions.\n\nENGL*484*D1: Children’s Literature (Arnold)\n\nThis distance-learning course takes a scholarly approach to the understanding and appreciation of works appropriate for elementary and middle school children. Readings range from classic to contemporary and cover a variety of reading levels, genres, themes, and cultures. Assignments focus on critically reading, categorizing, analyzing, and evaluating children’s literature and illustration; using children’s book awards, book lists, and other tools for selecting children’s books; and understanding the importance of including multicultural books in any children’s literature library. Members of the learning community in this class are expected to participate actively in online class activities; contribute to a shared class book list through composing an annotated bibliography; gain practice reading aloud and presenting literature in an online environment; develop a working knowledge of tools for locating children’s books; and become familiar with issues and scholarship in the field of children's literature. High-speed Internet access, an updated web browser, and access to the Moodle learning management system are required for this distance-learning course.\n\nENGL 600 Level\n\nENGL*602*E1: Principles of Editing and Publishing (Oestreich, K)\n\nStudents will work with COVE (Collaborative Organization for Virtual Education) to gain valuable skills by learning HTML and the editing skills necessary to then review, write, and copy edit for the COVE digital collective. Tasks may include but are not limited to encoding primary material from a variety of fields (following clear semantic guidelines); facilitating the creation of timelines for specific projects; helping to build COVE's Master Map (Google Map search and place annotation); and copyediting articles and editions at standards that meet or exceed those of traditional academic presses. COVE is getting very close to having 14 million words of content, the equivalent of a 56-volume encyclopedia, and we will be adding to that massive corpus by encoding Talia Schaffer’s Literature and Culture at the Fin de Siècle (2006), among others. Students will also read articles on the role of digital text creation in English departments, English language writing and reading praxis, and current commercial and academic publication structures.\n\nStudent Learning Goals\n\ngain technology, writing, and copyediting skills and publishing experience\n\ncontribute to a digital repository that will influence future teaching\n\ncreate definitive web editions of texts and maintain the consistent journalistic excellence and integrity of the COVE website\n\nENGL*604*E1: Composition and Rhetoric (Smith)\n\nThis course will explore major discussions in the field of Rhetoric and Composition from the mid-1960s to the present. Using James Berlin's mapping of the field into three distinct rhetorics—expressivist, cognitive, and social-epistemic—we will see how these trajectories have played out historically in the theory and practice of composition. Similarly, we will spend a lot of time bringing those conversations to more contemporary research in the related fields of creative writing studies, digital rhetoric, rhetorical theory, and composition studies. Along with more conventional academic essays, students will be asked to engage and produce a variety of multimodal compositions. If you would like to discuss the course further, please contact csmith8@coastal.edu.\n\nENGL*655*E1: Graduate Writing Workshop, Creative Nonfiction (Hanafi)\n\nThis writing workshop is focused on process, with plenty of room for experimentation. We'll read and discuss works of creative nonfiction in print, digital, and visual forms, and encounter different, often innovative, methods of research and arrangement. You'll experiment with creative ways of locating yourself in the world and documenting your experience. As a group, we'll work on getting and giving feedback that's suited to wherever we are in our process.\n\nENGL*658*E1: Graduate Writing Workshop, Poetry (Albergotti)\n\nIn this graduate-level poetry workshop, we will explore a lot of possible avenues to the making of poems. We’ll write and workshop at least seven poems during the semester. Students will receive ample feedback and assemble a polished portfolio of their poems at the end of the course.\n\nFall 2022\n\nENGL 300 *01 Critical Conversations in English: (Smith)\n\nA research-intensive course that offers English majors the opportunity to examine a critical issue current in the discipline of English studies and to participate in a rigorous exchange about this issue with their peers. Depending on the demonstrated scholarly expertise and active research agenda of the instructor, the course will explore a range of theoretical and historical models of reading and reception. English majors should take the course in the first semester of their junior year (or for more advanced majors, during the second semester of their sophomore year). Sections of the course will be offered in both fall and spring semesters and enrollment will be limited to 20 students. This course may be repeated for credit once under a different instructor.\n\nENGL 301 *01 Forms of Creative Writing (Albergotti)\n\nA course that introduces the fundamentals of composing poetry, fiction, and creative nonfiction using a combination of example readings and writing workshops. We will study the elements of craft that apply to a variety of genres, including fiction, poetry, and creative nonfiction. We will examine poems, stories, and essays by successful writers in an effort to understand their craft; we will produce and discuss our own pieces of writing; and we will develop our abilities to provide effective, helpful feedback to pieces of writing created by others. We will also work on becoming better readers of contemporary literature, not just better writers of it.\n\nENGL 301 *D1 Forms of Creative Writing (Ockert)\n\nIn this online-only distance learning course students examine the history, movements, and technical forms of poetry, fiction, and creative nonfiction using a combination of example readings and writing workshops.\n\nENGL 303 *01 British Literature I (Ennis)\n\nA survey of representative works illustrating the development of British literature from its beginning through the eighteenth century, with an emphasis on major literary movements understood in relation to their intellectual, social, and political contexts.\n\nENGL 332*01 Perspectives on American Literature and Culture (Hamelman)\n\nThis course develops students’ knowledge of a wide range of American literary and cultural texts that are critically analyzed within particular social historical, political, theoretical, popular, and/or aesthetic contexts. Through various overlapping forms of representation (textual, digital, aural, visual) students explore the major social, cultural, and political concerns of British literature and culture, including, industrialization and urbanization, ideologies of class and gender, nation and empire, scientific progress and religious crisis, technological innovation, and modernization. The literary and cultural texts that students read, view, and listen to include canonical as well as lesser-known titles that the instructor selects from theses main sources: poetry, fiction, non-fiction contemporary video, musical lyric, and/or cinema. The course features interactive and diverse approaches to assessment, from traditional papers to digital collaborations that show student engagement with British texts and their literary/cultural contexts.\n\nENGL 334 *01 Perspectives on British Literature and Culture: Empire and Its Legacies (Port)\n\nThis section of ENGL 334 will trace the expansion and decline of the British empire, considering the complex dynamics of authority and influence. We’ll see how personal and political landscapes intersect in a range of works, including fiction, poetry, drama, film, and music. With a focus on subjectivity, diversity, and crosspollination, we’ll discuss how “British” national and postcolonial identities have been constructed and challenged over time through a compelling range of individual voices and stories.\n\nENGL 335 *01 Perspectives on World and Anglophone Literatures and Culture – Magical and Other Realisms (Oldfield)\n\nIn this course we'll be reading wold literature in translation with a focus on fiction that chooses to interact with lived human experience in imaginative ways - folkloric, psychological, surrealistic, speculative, magical, weird. Although geographies are in the imaginary, the course will include authors from Latin America, Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Europe/Eurasia. Some of the featured (real) authors include Julio Cortazar, Haruki Murakami, Sharnush Parsipur, Suzanne Césaire, Bruno Shultz, and Anna Akhmatova. The course will consist of reading, discussion and writing.\n\nENGL 341 *01 African-American Literature, 1750-present (Lowery)\n\nThis course surveys the African-American literary tradition, covering the periods of the antebellum U.S., slavery, post-Reconstruction, the Harlem Renaissance, the Black Arts Movement, and postmodernism. Using various genres from and beyond the canon, we will explore the past and the history of African American literary production to engage with speculative futures. Many of our readings will explore topics of resistance to racism and gender discrimination as well as topics about Black life, love, identity, and futures. We will also work to understand the major themes of the African-American literary tradition. These include double-consciousness, uplift, signifying, and more recent speculative understandings of Black futures. Students may take this course to fulfill their English major and minor requirements, and most reading materials will be provided on Moodle.\n\nENGL 351 *01 Language, Gender and Power (Fleckenstein)\n\nThe course investigates language structure and usage patterns in the context of gender to achieve a better understanding of the way language reflects the changing roles of women and men. Differences in gender-based language use, language references, and the perceptions, attitudes and behaviors related to these differences are examined in this course.\n\nENGL 354 *01 English Grammar and Syntax (Hasty)\n\nAlthough we use it every day and often have strong opinions about its proper form and appropriate use, we rarely stop to think about the wonder of Language. You are reading and understanding these sentences, but you have no conscious knowledge of how you are doing this. That is, you have some implicit knowledge of language, but you aren’t able to express how you know the things you know. For example, you know that sentences like Wash your hands! are OK without having a stated word as the subject, but why then is *Ran to the store. bad? You know that the second sentence is bad in some way, yet you can’t really express why (and the “rules” you were taught in grade school don’t seem to help you explain this). The study of the mystery of Language is the science of Linguistics. This class is about one aspect of linguistics: how sentences are structured, what linguists call Syntax. One of the most interesting questions in linguistics is how we subconsciously get from sounds and words to organize those words into what we intend to say (the sentence). By the end of this course you should have gained a solid understanding of modern syntactic theory as well as the ability to apply this theory to a variety of novel sentence structures in English and other world languages.\n\nENGL 362 *01 Fiction I (Ockert)\n\nAn introductory creative writing workshop course in which students study published contemporary short stories and create original works of short fiction. Students read and critique both published and student work.\n\nENGL 368 *01 Poetry I (Albergotti)\n\nPoetry I is an introductory poetry writing workshop that focuses on fundamentals and forms. Students will study a variety of poetic forms and techniques and will read a broad range of poems, both classic and contemporary. The majority of the coursework involves the writing and discussion of poems by members of the class. For the final project, students assemble a portfolio of the poems they have produced during the semester, both in original and revised versions, along with reflective discussions of the writing and revision process. ENGL 368 is designed to lay the groundwork for further study in ENGL 468: Poetry II. Students who wish to take ENGL 468 are strongly encouraged to take ENGL 368 first.\n\nENGL 379 *01 Special Topics in Film Studies (Oestreich, K)\n\nEveryone has an opinion on which is better: the book or the film. This course will teach you how to elevate this debate by introducing you to film adaptation theory and principles of film form in order to analyze intermedial (e.g., book to film) adaptations of canonical nineteenth-century British literature. You will read excerpts from novels before studying their adaptations, which may include but are not limited to Frankenstein (1931), Pride and Prejudice (2006), Jane Eyre (2011), Wuthering Heights (2011), The Autobiography of Jane Eyre (2013-14), Emma (2019), Rebecca (2020), and Persuasion (if it is released in time), as well as the literary parody web series, Edgar Allan Poe’s Murder Mystery Dinner Party (2016). By the end of this term, you will have acquired the vocabulary and theoretical background necessary to write analytically about both the original source text and its adaptation.\n\nENGL 391 *01 Introduction to new Literacy Studies (Howes)\n\nThis course is designed to expose you to form and content: research methods and knowledge pertaining to the field of New Literacy Studies. Basic concepts in the discipline include an understanding of literacies as multiple and layered, concepts around the “sponsorship” of learners who enter particular discourses, and connections between literacies and communities. When we study this topic, we study not only the skills of reading and writing, but the way the ability to navigate text serves as a resource for individual and groups in their daily lives. For this reason, we will study literacies within the context of a certain time and place, considering how learning and using discourse changes from one historical location and community to the next. The study of literacies coincides with a variety of different fields, including education, English Studies, Composition and Rhetoric, and sociolinguistics; the texts we cover this semester will reflect this diversity while keeping us focused on questions of how language-use impacts groups and individuals. While the questions and interests you bring to the class will guide our discussions, some general questions we will reflect upon during the semester include:\n\n• How do we define literacy and literacies?\n\n• What different perspectives make up conversations in Literacy Studies?\n\n• How do different literacies interact within communities and impact identity?\n\nWhile this course primarily focuses on literacies in the US – historical and contemporary – we will also incorporate acknowledgement of the transnational nature of language and education to explore interactions as literacies and languages come into contact.\n\nENGL 411 *Q1 English Capstone Seminar (Pillai)\n\nThis class provides a forum for both reflection upon and assessment of the student’s experience in the major. Readings and writing assignments will focus on the discipline of English in a postgraduate context, the professional potential of the English degree, portfolio construction, and revision of existing writings for publications. The course will also include activities designed to help the department assess its program as well as the opportunity for an exit interview.\n\nENGL 443 *01 Topics in Women Writers: Bridges to Everywhere: Intersectional Storytelling and Feminist Practice (Pillai)\n\nThis course will introduce students to feminist texts, theories, and practices that, through their intersectional storytelling methods, forge social change in diverse environments across the world. In particular, we will focus on the works of writers and directors who examine the interconnectedness of gender, religion, race, age, ethnicity, class, ability, nationality, sexuality, and locationality in peoples’ lived experiences and everyday struggles. No book purchase needed.\n\nENGL 451 *01 Introduction to the Study of Language and Modern Grammar (Fleckenstein)\n\nThis course is an introduction to the scientific study of the nature and structure of human Language — what we refer to as linguistics. We will go beyond providing an overview of the field, and will draw on real-world language data to emphasize the methods of linguistic analysis and ability in the areas of sound patterns (phonetics and phonology), words and word formation (morphology), sentence structure (syntax), meaning (semantics), and discourse. Over the course of this semester, we will demonstrate how complex and interesting the language system is and how social and historical factors can contribute to language variation and change.\n\nENGL 459 *01 Advanced Composition and Rhetoric (Howes)\n\nThis course provides an introduction to the theories that structure the field of Composition and Rhetoric to advance students’ knowledge and build vocabulary to discuss reading, writing, and how texts function in the social world. We will combine this theory with practice by writing using different genres and developing research skills. These methods will allow students to explore questions about ways language connects to how we see others and ourselves, critically interrogating literacy learning, discourse communities, and rhetorical theory. Implementing process-based writing will also encourage students to cultivate content and clarity in their writing by working through multiple drafts and learning about effective revision strategies.\n\nENGL 465 *01 Creative Nonfiction II (Hanafi)\n\nAn advanced creative writing workshop course in which students study published contemporary narrative nonfiction and create original nonfiction essays. Students read and critique both published and student work.\n\nENGL 483 *01 Theory of Literary Criticism: (Smith)\n\nA study of various theories of literary criticism as applied to the major genres (fiction, poetry, and drama) with the aim of establishing standards of judgment.\n\nENGL 485 *D1 Adolescent Literature (Arnold)\n\nThis course introduces students to the wide variety of young adult literature available for middle and high school readers, along with current issues, trends, and scholarship in the field of young adult literature. Readings range from classic to contemporary and cover a variety of levels, genres, themes, and cultures. We will read fantasy and historical fiction, dystopian literature and graphic novels. We will read of the experiences of migrant workers, Native Americans living on a reservation, and Jews suffering through the Holocaust, along with wizards, heroes, anti-heroes, and a host of other characters. Along the way, we will focus our discussions on critically reading, categorizing, analyzing, and evaluating young adult literature and illustration; using book awards, booklists, and other tools for selecting books; and understanding the importance of including multicultural books. Whether you plan to teach, you consider becoming a librarian, you want to share good books with a child, grandchild, niece or nephew, or you simply want to learn more about the field of adolescent literature, this course has lots for you to enjoy and learn\n\nSpring 2022\n\nENGL 300 *01: Critical Conversations in English (Smith)\n\nA research-intensive course that offers English majors the opportunity to examine a critical issue current in the discipline of English studies and to participate in a rigorous exchange about this issue with their peers. Depending on the demonstrated scholarly expertise and active research agenda of the instructor, the course will explore a range of theoretical and historical models of reading and reception. English majors should take the course in the first semester of their junior year (or for more advanced majors, during the second semester of their sophomore year). Sections of the course will be offered in both fall and spring semesters and enrollment will be limited to 20 students. This course may be repeated for credit once under a different instructor.\n\nENGL 301 *01: Forms of Creative Writing (Liebeck)\n\nA course that introduces the fundamentals of composing poetry, fiction, creative nonfiction and other types of creative writing. An exploratory approach is taken using a combination of contemporary readings, technique-focused studio days, group excursions, sharing, and critique. The course will culminate in the creation of an individual portfolio, and an alternative publication project involving the whole class.\n\nENGL 301 *D1: Forms of Creative Writing (Ockert)\n\nIn this online-only distance learning course students examine the history, movements, and technical forms of creative nonfiction, poetry, and fiction using a combination of example readings and writing workshops. Each student will have one essay, two poems, and one short story read and critiqued by the entire class. The philosophy behind the workshop format is to broaden a writer’s knowledge base and provide him/her with further tools with which to sharpen his/her craft.\n\nENGL 306 *01: American Literature II (Lowery)\n\nAmerican literature from the Civil War to the present presents several works that encompass a dizzying array of styles and perspectives on topics as diverse as reconstruction, feminism and gender, naturalism, Local Color writing, the Great Migration, world war, modernism, identity, race, and technology. In this course, we will examine whether such a monolithic understanding of the nation’s literature is even productive or possible. Thus, while we will study the various reading selections with an aim to recognize the development of American literature, we will keep an eye on questioning our conception of what American literature has been, is now, and will be in the future.\n\nThe selected readings do not represent American literature in a definitive way, but instead, show us early and present conceptions of the America we have come to understand. We will use the selections to deepen our knowledge about what goes unspoken about the gaps in our nation’s literature. In order to do this sort of evaluation effectively, we must attend to formal elements, thematic contents, historical meaningfulness, philosophical contributions, and cultural identities.\n\nENGL 323 *01: Modern British/Irish Literature: 1922, Modernism’s Miracle Year (Port)\n\nThe first half of the twentieth century was a time of rapid changes throughout Europe, many of which resonate in our own time of profound cultural shifts. Technological and scientific advances, economic developments, and social transformations led to new ways of experiencing space and time and new conceptions of human character. The growth of cities, rising consumerism, cross-cultural colonial encounters, and the crises of world wars coincided with—and contributed to—the erosion of long-held certainties about empire, religion, marriage, and morality. These radical changes contributed to a widespread sense of alienation, anxiety, and instability, along with an awareness of creative empowerment and artistic possibility. Artists, writers, filmmakers, musicians, and dancers responded to their changing environment with innovative aesthetic forms that broke dramatically from the conventions of previous generations.\n\nENGL 323 begins with an introduction to some of the theoretical and historical foundations of modernism and goes on to explore a number of the most groundbreaking, influential literary texts written by British and Irish authors during this period (approximately 1890-1945). In Spring 2022, we will center our studies on several remarkable works published in 1922, which has been dubbed the annus mirabilis (miracle year) of literary modernism: T. S. Eliot’s The Waste Land, James Joyce’s Ulysses, and Virginia Woolf’s Jacob’s Room. Our discussions will be enriched by consideration of related works as well as parallel developments in modernist visual art, film, music, and dance. We will round out our semester by considering contemporary responses to these texts and the ongoing influence of modernist aesthetics today. In addition to learning about these cultural touchstones in their historical and aesthetic contexts, you will sharpen your skills in attentive reading, thoughtful discussion, and effective writing.\n\nENGL 338 *01: Perspectives on a Single Author: Edgar Allan Poe (Hamelman)\n\nNotwithstanding many personal and professional difficulties, Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) carved out a canonical place in American literature and culture. He is that rare author whose imagination appeals to readers of all ages and whose works continually adapt to new historical and social conditions. A perennial touchstone author of American gothic/horror fiction, Poe also mastered other genres such as lyric poetry and satire/hoax, and he more or less originated the detective tale, whose offshoots include innumerable crime dramas pervading American television and cinema. Finally, as a theorist, Poe stood out, arguing against the “heresy of the didactic” common in mid-nineteenth-century popular poetry. In this course we close-read many examples from these genres, analyze Poe’s aesthetics, and contextualize his creations not only in his own era of print but also in our digital/virtual world, where interest in his “relatable” themes and tropes has not diminished.\n\nENGL 350 *01: Language Variation in America (Hasty)\n\nWhy do those people up North (i.e., Yankees) talk the way they do? How can those people in the South (i.e., Rednecks) sound so nice yet still so dumb? Why don't the people out West have an accent? Do I have an accent?\n\nIn this course, we will answer all these questions and more. We will study the differences in the varieties of North American English from a scientific perspective being guided by contemporary sociolinguistic theory. While regional variation is one of the most salient aspects of American English, we will also study social, ethnic, gender, and style-related language variation. Along with understanding how different varieties of English are linguistically different from each other, we will also explore issues related to the social evaluation of individual dialects regarding the perceptions and attitudes of speakers and hearers of these varieties. We will address issues related to the so-called \"Standard\" English ideology and even seek to uncover linguistic profiling and discrimination. The course will be discussion based and will involve a good deal of classroom participation and presentation. Students will be asked to complete original sociolinguistic research by collecting data on actual real-world language variation and presenting their findings in both oral and written form.\n\nENGL 365 *01: Creative Nonfiction I (Burch)\n\nLiterature and workshop course designed to study published contemporary creative nonfiction and create original works of creative nonfiction. Students will read and critique both published and student work. This course is writing intensive.\n\nENGL 375 *01: Special Topics in World and Anglophone Literature: Philosophy and Literature (Oldfield/Rauhut)\n\nCreative literature and philosophy both explore human experience in the world, often asking many of the same questions about ethics and embodiment, language and subjectivity, reality and consciousness. In this class, co taught by Dr. Oldfield (English) and Dr. Rauhut (Philosophy), we’ll alternate reading World literary texts, including by Dostoevsky, Kafka, and Borges, with philosophical readings, including by Nietzsche, Freud and Camus. Whether you’ve taken philosophy before or would like to be introduced to it, in this course we’ll see how much literature and philosophy are intertwined while considering their different approaches. Cross listed with PHIL 310 and LIS 375.\n\nENGL 392 *01: Writing in Professional and Public Setting (Sobota)\n\nThis course focuses on writing that happens in the world of work. It encompasses texts that inform, persuade, advocate, explain, and guide. These texts are crafted for specific rhetorical situations and involve close attention to audience, context, and purpose. We’ll look at ethical and rhetorical perspectives for a variety of texts that we read and write, considering the ways the following variables are interwoven: specialist and general knowledge; information, education, and persuasion; public and community relations; and, importantly, citizenship and morality. You’ll write a range of texts for print and digital channels, including internal and external messages, public service announcements, feature stories, and institutional profiles.\n\nENGL 411 *Q1: English Capstone Seminar (Childs)\n\nThis class provides a forum for both reflection upon and assessment of the student’s experience in the major. Readings and writing assignments will focus on the discipline of English in a postgraduate context, the professional potential of the English degree, portfolio construction, and revision of existing writings for publications. The course will also include activities designed to help the department assess its program as well as the opportunity for an exit interview. This course is taken during the last semester before graduation.\n\nENGL 451 *01: Introduction to the Study of Language and Modern Grammar (Fleckenstein)\n\nThis course is an introduction to the scientific study of the nature and structure of human Language — what we refer to as linguistics. We will go beyond providing an overview of the field, and will draw on real-world language data to emphasize the methods of linguistic analysis and ability in the areas of sound patterns (phonetics and phonology), words and word formation (morphology), sentence structure (syntax), meaning (semantics), and discourse. Over the course of this semester, we will demonstrate how complex and interesting the language system is and how social and historical factors can contribute to language variation and change.\n\nENGL 453 *D1 Development of the English Language (Hasty)\n\nHistory of the English Language is an introduction to the field of Historical Linguistics, with a specific focus on the development of the English Language from its origins in Indo-European up to our current Present Day English. This course will provide you with the tools to do historical linguistic analysis in order to foster a deeper understanding of not only the history of the English language but also a knowledge of the methods through which this history was uncovered. By the end of the course, you should have an understanding of the following: how and why language changes, how to analyze and represent sounds graphically, how writing systems differ from each other and from speech, how and why languages are grouped together into families, and specific phonological, morphological, syntactic, and lexical differences between Old, Middle, Early Modern, and Present Day English. To foster and assess these objectives, you will complete a series of problem sets and exams which will ask you to apply historical linguistic analysis to real world language data.\n\nENGL 457 *01: Form and Style in Writing (Kellogg)\n\nWhat do we mean by writing style? This class develops an understanding of style as a choice — or rather, as a set of choices. Every time you choose to write a sentence one way rather than another, you have made a stylistic choice. Your writing has attained a style, however, only when the set of the choices you make add up to something recognizable, consistent, and true. This course is an intensive workshop in improving prose style. We will cover research and citation styles (what many students mean by “style”), but we focus on improving your ability to compose sentences and paragraphs with wit, elegance, and power. We will cover issues of clarity, concision, coherence, cohesion, and other elements of practical style; control of sentence length, rhythm, and pacing; and a variety of rhetorical figures, including tropes of argument. You will both revise previously written pieces and compose new work.\n\nENGL 459 *01 Advanced Composition and Rhetoric (Howes)\n\nThis course provides an introduction to the theories that structure the field of Composition and Rhetoric to advance students’ knowledge and build vocabulary to discuss reading, writing, and how texts function in the social world. We will combine this theory with practice by writing using different genres and developing research skills. These methods will allow students to explore questions about ways language connects to how we see others and ourselves, critically interrogating literacy learning, discourse communities, and rhetorical theory. Implementing process-based writing will also encourage students to cultivate content and clarity in their writing by working through multiple drafts and learning about effective revision strategies.\n\nENGL 462 *02: Fiction II (Ockert)\n\nThis is an advanced course in fiction writing and in it we will analyze the multiple ways a short story can be written. You will write at least two original short pieces which will be read and critiqued by the entire class. Although it is impossible to teach you to be a great writer, it is possible to teach you the ways in which published writers have organized their thoughts and ideas onto the page. “Greatness,” I’m hoping, will rub off on you. Additionally, you’ll have the opportunity to read your peers’ writing in a workshop setting. Building on what you’ve learned in previous creative writing courses, we will study contemporary elements of style and seek to understand what makes a good short story good.\n\nENGL 468 *01: Poetry II (Albergotti)\n\nAuden says that “poetry makes nothing happen.” Dickinson says it makes her feel “as if the top of [her] head were taken off.” Bishop says that producing it involves “hundreds of things coming together at the right moment.” And Pound says that our job in writing it is to “make it new.” In this workshop course, we’ll see if any or all of those poets are right. And we’ll do our best to say something ourselves. At the very least, we’ll create some works of art that did not exist before, and that’s usually a good thing. And if we’re very lucky, some of those works will live longer than us. That’s the goal, anyway. So let’s get together and try to make some “memorable speech” (that’s Auden again) by writing in lines as well as sentences. [Note: It is recommended, but not required, that students complete ENGL 368 before enrolling in ENGL 468.]\n\nENGL 483 *01: Theory of Literary Criticism – Critical Theory: From Information to Insight (Pillai)\n\nThis course will answer three interconnected questions: what is “theory”; what does theory do; and what can we do with it? In essence theory, also known as critical theory, explores how knowledge works: how it is made or constructed in particular contexts, how it is shared among or withheld from peoples, and how it is challenged or reproduced in societies. In answering the “whats” and “hows” mentioned above, this course will inevitably address a crucial set of “whys,” a few of which are: why is knowledge often packaged as power; why does our excavation of seemingly clear-cut concepts unearth complicated matter; and why is theory crucial both to our pursuits of social change and our understanding of aesthetics?\n\nCritical theory is embedded in interdisciplinarity. Diverse disciplines, including philosophy, history, sociology, politics, media studies, and literary cultural studies intersect in our theoretical analysis of cultural materials, texts, and phenomena. In this course we will study a variety of theoretical texts in diverse media. While some of what we read, watch, and hear in this course may challenge our cultural assumptions, we’ll emerge from the experience equipped with critical thinking tools that enable us to transform information into insight.\n\nStudents may take this course to fulfill requirements for their ENGL minor or major. The course is also useful for students interested in taking the praxis tests. No book purchase is needed for this course. Reading/viewing materials will be made available to you on Moodle. Contact tpillai@coastal.edu if you have any questions about the course.\n\nENGL 484 *D1: Children’s Literature (Arnold)\n\nThis distance-learning course takes a scholarly approach to the understanding and appreciation of works appropriate for elementary and middle school children. Readings range from classic to contemporary and cover a variety of reading levels, genres, themes, and cultures. Assignments focus on critically reading, categorizing, analyzing, and evaluating children’s literature and illustration; using children’s book awards, book lists, and other tools for selecting children’s books; and understanding the importance of including multicultural books in any children’s literature library. Members of the learning community in this class are expected to participate actively in online class activities; contribute to a shared class book list through composing an annotated bibliography; gain practice reading aloud and presenting literature in an online environment; develop a working knowledge of tools for locating children’s books; and become familiar with issues and scholarship in the field of children's literature. High-speed Internet access, an updated web browser, and access to the Moodle learning management system are required for this distance-learning course.\n\nENGL 489 *01: Gender and Sexuality in Literature- Subversive Pleasures: Histories and Theories of ‘Deviance’ (Pillai)\n\nIn this course we will address two persistently controversial and interconnected questions that inform our expressions, experiences, and performances of gender and sexuality: What is deviance? And what is pleasure? In engaging with these questions, we will also address the historical, socio-cultural, economic, legal, political, philosophical, and psychological contexts within which both pleasure and deviance are continually defined, challenged, and reimagined. Our studies and conversations will hinge on our ability to identify and unearth the often complicated, intersectional logics of individual and collective identity that inform all our notions of pleasure (and pain) and deviance (and conformity). Throughout the semester we will study diverse visual, literary, and theoretical texts—movies/series and music videos, short stories and poems, and excerpts of works by theorists of gender and sexuality—and juxtapose the commonsense and uncommonsense understandings of deviance and pleasure explored within these works.\n\nThis is a cross-listed course: students may take this course to fulfill requirements for their ENGL and/or WGST minor or major. No book purchase is needed for this course. Reading/viewing materials will be made available to you on Moodle. Contact tpillai@coastal.edu if you have any questions about the course\n\nFall 2021\n\nENGL 300 *01: Critical Conversations in English - Border Crossings: Migration in Contemporary Literature and Film (Port)\n\nRefugee, migrant, exile, alien: current news reports and political rhetoric often focus on efforts to cross national borders and attempts to limit such movement. Whether seeking to flee war, escape natural disaster, evade political or religious persecution, or increase economic opportunities, those who cross borders often have fascinating stories to tell. Our course will explore accounts of migration in contemporary fiction, film, and memoir with origins at the US border with Mexico, Ireland, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and elsewhere. Our readings will be informed by a selection of theoretical texts on national and cultural identity, boundaries and belonging, language and translation, and the powers and failures of memory. These works provide an opportunity to probe some of the complexities around such concepts as home and homeland, diaspora and exile, race, ethnicity, and tradition, and to consider how these concepts are evolving in a world that has become increasingly transcultural and globalized, and—in reaction—increasingly nationalistic.\n\nENGL 301 *01: Forms of Creative Writing (Liebeck)\n\nStudents draw technical inspiration and enabling constraints from reading poetry, fiction, and creative nonfiction with an emphasis on modernists, post-modernists, and contemporary writers. They share and receive feedback on their own weekly writings, keep a journal and a reading journal, and culminate in a personal portfolio and a collaborative class publication project.\n\nENGL 301 *D1: Forms of Creative Writing (Ockert)\n\nIn this online-only distance learning course students examine the history, movements, and technical forms of poetry, fiction, and creative nonfiction using a combination of example readings and writing workshops.\n\nENGL 311 *01: Topics in Shakespeare – Changing “Shakespeare” in the “Real World” and Our Future (Pillai)\n\nThis course can also be taken as ENGL 338/”Perspectives on a Single Author”\n\nAs humans hurtle towards the second quarter of the 21st century, we might wonder how our identities and practices can remain relevant in the future we’ll inhabit. Along with the four Cs of “critical thinking,” “communication,” “collaboration,” and “creativity” that are expected to play crucial roles in our professional and social lives, our ability to adapt to the many changes around us will be vital to our relevance and growth in the 21st and 22nd centuries. This is where studying “Shakespeare” comes in handy. For centuries, cancel culture has failed to shut down “Shakespeare” because Shakespearean storytelling—on the page, the stage, and on screens—has adapted to, reflected, and anticipated the various changes in our societies and environments. In this course we will explore the changing cultures and responsive practices of Shakespearean storytelling. Specifically, we will study its morphology and mutations through “original works,” “adaptations,” “appropriations” and “re/mediations.” We will critically analyze five “Shakespeare” stories told in diverse media and will engage with the following questions: why does a story come to be picked repeatedly by storytellers across cultures? How does it change with the change of hands and the change of time, place, cultures, forms, or media? How does the past embed itself in the future of a story, and how does the future version of a story deal with its past? If “Shakespeare” adapts exceptionally well to humans’ continual experimentations with critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity, what can we learn about adaptability from “Shakespeare” that will enable us to be relevant in our futures?\n\nNo book purchase needed: reading and viewing materials will be made available online.\n\nENGL 332*01 Perspectives on American Literature and Culture (Hamelman)\n\nThis course develops students’ knowledge of a wide range of American literary and cultural texts that are critically analyzed within particular social historical, political, theoretical, popular, and/or aesthetic contexts. Through various overlapping forms of representation (textual, digital, aural, visual) students explore the major social, cultural, and political concerns of British literature and culture, including, industrialization and urbanization, ideologies of class and gender, nation and empire, scientific progress and religious crisis, technological innovation, and modernization. The literary and cultural texts that students read, view, and listen to include canonical as well as lesser-known titles that the instructor selects from theses main sources: poetry, fiction, non-fiction contemporary video, musical lyric, and/or cinema. The course features interactive and diverse approaches to assessment, from traditional papers to digital collaborations that show student engagement with British texts and their literary/cultural contexts.\n\nENGL 334 *02 Perspectives on British Literature and Culture (Oestreich, K)\n\nNo Dead White Men: One of the clichés about English literature is that it is the study of dead white men; therefore, this section of ENGL 334 is breaking that stereotype by focusing exclusively on the fiction, non-fiction, poetry, and cinema written by British women, enslaved persons, and colonized BIPOC (black, indigenous, people of color) from the end of the eighteenth century through the present day. The literature that was published by these authors tends to be less solipsistic, less interested in the solitary genius and more invested in ameliorating present cruelties by building relationships with their communities – emotionally, politically, didactically, polemically. We are going to read and respond to these traditionally under-represented persons’ takes on human rights, reform, abolition of slave trade, gender roles, war, imperialism, post-colonialism, literature, education, childhood, technological developments, and more.\n\nENGL 335 *01 Perspectives on World and Anglophone Literatures and Culture – The Question of Evil (Oldfield)\n\nDoes evil exist? Is it natural, spiritual, a survival skill? How do we react when faced with evil? Can we transcend evil? Can one person's evil be another's good? Our species has been exploring these and other questions of evil since we began to reflect on ourselves in narrative, and in this class we'll explore along with them. In ENGL 335 our literature will include folklore, mythology, imaginative fiction, and other narrative arts from a spectrum of eras and cultures on all inhabited continents. Humanity is bound together by our shared questions of evil, and in this class we will bring our voices to this timeless and timely conversation.\n\nENGL 337 *01 Perspectives on Genre – Spicing Things Up: Women’s Imaginative Labor and South Asian Diasporic Communities (Pillai)\n\nDiaspora: the dispersion or spread of groups of people beyond their traditional homelands or points of origin.\n\nThis course will introduce students to visual, audio, and written texts produced by women of the South Asian diaspora. From Kamala Harris to Padma Lakshmi the labor of diasporic women’s imaginative work represents the nexus of assimilation and alienation, just as it recalibrates the West’s normative logics of gendered belonging within spaces: within bodies, communities, and nations. Covering a variety of popular media—food shows, fashion journalism, political writing, talk shows, films, and short stories—we will analyze the creative and critical work of women of the South Asian diaspora who adopt intersectional methods to examine the interconnectedness of gender, religion, race, age, ethnicity, class, ability, nationality, sexuality, and location in peoples’ lived experiences.\n\nNo book purchase needed: reading and viewing materials will be made available online.\n\nThis course is cross-listed with WGST 301.\n\nENGL 341 *01: African-American Literature, 1750-present (Lowery)\n\nThis course surveys the African-American literary tradition, covering the periods of slavery, post-Reconstruction, the Harlem Renaissance, the Black Arts Movement, and postmodernism. Using various genres in the canon, we will explore the past and the history of African American literary production in order to engage with present contexts of struggle. Many of our readings will explore topics of resistance to racism as well as topics about black life, love, and identity. We will also work to understand the major themes of the African-American literary tradition. These include double-consciousness, uplift, signifying, and the neo-slave narrative.\n\nENGL 350 *01: Language Variation in North America (Hasty)\n\nWhy do those people up North (i.e., Yankees) talk the way they do? How can those people in the South (i.e., Rednecks) sound so nice yet still so dumb? Why don't the people out West have an accent? Do I have an accent?\n\nIn this course, we will answer all these questions and more. We will study the differences in the varieties of North American English from a scientific perspective being guided by contemporary sociolinguistic theory. While regional variation is one of the most salient aspects of American English, we will also study social, ethnic, gender, and style-related language variation. Along with understanding how different varieties of English are linguistically different from each other, we will also explore issues related to the social evaluation of individual dialects regarding the perceptions and attitudes of speakers and hearers of these varieties. We will address issues related to the so-called \"Standard\" English ideology and even seek to uncover linguistic profiling and discrimination. The course will be discussion based and will involve a good deal of classroom participation and presentation. Students will be asked to complete original sociolinguistic research by collecting data on actual real-world language variation and presenting their findings in both oral and written form.\n\nENGL 352 *01: African American English (Childs)\n\nA course that explores African American English from a linguistics and social perspective. Course content will focus on hypotheses of the development of African American English, linguistic theory as applied to African American English, and social/cultural dimensions of African American English.\n\nENGL 355 *01: Introduction to Discourse Analysis (Fleckenstein)\n\nThis course is an introduction to the close analysis of discourse, focusing initially and primarily on conversational discourse while also branching out to consider other types of interaction (e.g., institutional, online, and media discourse). Throughout this course, we will address questions related to discourse in terms of identity (how identities are reflected, created, negotiated, and repaired through talk), relationships (such as how people negotiate hierarchy and equality in interaction), meaning (how meanings are jointly created or not understood), social action (such as how speakers use language to criticize and apologize), culture (the interrelationship between language use and culture), technology (such as how social media is – and is not – changing discourse), as well as social problems (e.g., racial and gender discrimination) and social issues (such as the role of the English language in the U.S.).\n\nENGL 362 *01: Fiction I (Ockert)\n\nAn introductory creative writing workshop course in which students study published contemporary short stories and create original works of short fiction. Students read and critique both published and student work.\n\nENGL 368 *01: Poetry I (Albergotti)\n\nPoetry I is an introductory poetry writing workshop that focuses on fundamentals and forms. Students will study "
