        "text": "As someone who spends his life telling stories for children, I can't be sniffy about adapting Beowulf. I think it's wonderful that a 3D, computer-generated version of an epic poem set in sixth-century Denmark was made at all. It's a brave, extraordinary thing, and I was entranced by the spectacle, but I'm afraid it left me cold in a way that the poem - an account of a mythical hero's battle with a terrifying monster - does not.\n\nThe film changes the very nature of its hero. He becomes vulnerable and flawed, and he loses much of his nobility. The minute he starts lying, he becomes less interesting. The monster, Grendel, is also rather diminished here. He is imagined as a pathetic creature - you feel as if he's being eaten from the inside by maggots. I never had the sense of his enormous and terrifying strength. They've created a whole new plot about who slept with Grendel's mother, which feels clunky. I found the portrayal of her, as a naked Angelina Jolie, to be rather absurd. For one thing, she seems to be wearing high heels. Adding sexuality to the story just made it more ordinary for me.\n\nBeowulf's naked fight with Grendel was just ridiculous. His genitals are constantly obscured by candlesticks and so on; I was sitting there in my 3D glasses, and I kept wondering, if I just leaned a little bit to the left ...\n\nThe 3D effect is so powerful that you wonder whether it is somehow infecting your brain. It's rather disturbing to have rats running around inches away from your nose and spears that seem to fly towards you. Eventually, the film leaves you no room to use your own imagination. As a viewer you're not treated with enough respect."
