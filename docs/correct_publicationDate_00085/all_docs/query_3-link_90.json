        "text": "A powerhouse trio of science fiction greats has united to further explore the planet Avalon, first introduced in their classic novel The Legacy of Heorot.\n\n\"Once upon a long, long time ago, our parents and grandparents left a place called Earth. They traveled across the stars in a ship called Geographic to find paradise.\"\n\nA new generation is growing up on the island paradise of Camelot, ignorant of the Great Grendel Wars fought when their parents and grandparents first arrived on Earth. Setting out to explore the mainland, this group of young rebels feels ready to fight any grendels that get in their way. On Avalon, however, there are monsters that dwarf the ones their parents fought, and as the group will soon learn, monsters also dwell in the human heart.\n\nAvalon does not give up her secrets easily, and some of those mysteries are wicked as sin and blacker than the grave.\n\nLarry Niven is the multiple Hugo, Locus, and Nebula Award–winning author of science fiction short stories and novels, including the Ringworld series, as well as many other science fiction masterpieces. His Footfall, coauthored with Jerry Pournelle, was a New York Times bestseller.\n\nJerry Pournelle (1933–2017) was an American science fiction writer, essayist, and journalist who contributed for many years to the computer magazine Byte. He wrote the popular Janissaries and CoDominium series and was the coauthor of several bestselling science fiction novels, including Lucifer’s Hammer, The Mote in God’s Eye, and the New York Times bestseller Footfall. He had advanced degrees in engineering, political science, statistics, and psychology and, in addition to his career as a fiction writer, had for many years written columns on both politics and technology.\n\nSteven Barnes is a prolific author and scriptwriter who has been nominated for the Hugo, Nebula, Cable ACE, and Endeavour awards. His work for television includes episodes of The Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, Stargate SG-1, and Andromeda. A lifelong student of human-performance technologies, he holds black belts in judo and karate, has an instructor certificate in Circular Strength Training, and is a trained hypnotherapist."
