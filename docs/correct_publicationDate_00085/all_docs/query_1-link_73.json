        "text": "Since the end of the seventeenth century in England, literary criticism of Children’s Literature has followed a ‘natural’ cycle of birth, growth, and development that is almost parallel to the birth and development of Children’s Literature which, mainly springing from oral storytelling, became written and spread through seventeenth-century Europe thanks to the works of Gianbattista Basile and Charles Perrault. This field is vast, and thus this article cannot be exhaustive but rather will attempt to retrace a brief history of criticism, in the English language, by examining several books and articles on the subject, published since 1990 but that also refer as far back as 1700, and available at the University of Cambridge Library. Like women’s writing, Literature for Children at its best is an Art whose ultimate goal is to change history by doing justice, and the role of the critic is to spread light on how that is done in a poetic as well as subversive way.\n\nDespite the fact that “the representation of gendered bodies and behaviours” within children’s literature is an issue that is “highly significant” and “frequently addressed, […] the application of gender studies to children’s texts […] is still very much a work in progress” (Flanagan 2010). In this article, my main aims are, firstly, to argue the importance of children’s literature as literature, and secondly, to show why gender does matter within children’s literature and its criticism, even within those books not tackling the issue at first glance. The article2 is divided into three sections : Dilemmas in Children’s Literature : Performativity Matters, in which I introduce the perspective on children’s literature I endorse - the framework I propose to understand children’s literature is performative ; Gender Dilemmas, in which I claim that gender is a fundamental category to understand children’s literature and what it does ; Subversions, Agency Attributions, Desires : Non-normative Representations, in which I individuate three different narrative strategies children’s books may employ in order to question gender norms. Children’s literature representations of non-normative behaviours, desires, and agencies make non-normative existences conceivable, and, as such, real.\n\nThis paper proposes a ‘Youth Theory’ of analysis which constructs youth as a site of transition, rather than an ‘other’ figure, and examines the relationship that young people have with the dominant social discourse (adulthood). The theory is similar to Marxist theory, except instead of focusing on arbitrary class barriers, it focuses on a culturally determined age-based power hierarchy. Fiction for young readers is unusual in the publishing discourse because the target audience of the genre does not (usually) produce the texts they consume. Instead, Children’s and Young Adult fiction (YA) is produced by adult authors. This exclusion of the young readers’ voice can marginalise and (eventually) colonise young adults as readers because it privileges the voice of the ‘powerholders’, or adults. Young readers differ from other marginalised groups, such as women, people of colour, and LGBTQ+ people, because there is no youth-specific theory of textual analysis in the way that there is Feminism, Post-colonialism, and Queer theory. This paper addresses this gap in critical practice; it models the use of Youth Theory by analysing contemporary fiction for young readers through an age-based interpretive framework. It examines how aetonormativity is portrayed in fiction, and how young characters are shown reacting to it."
