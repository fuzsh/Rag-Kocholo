They go on to create a number of varied written outcomes using the text as a starting point including recounts, formal letters, dialogue, descriptions, obituaries and writing their own epic, heroic narrative using various poetic devices. References will be made to the original manuscript throughout.\n\nSynopsis of Text:\n\nIn fifth-century Denmark, a murderous monster stalks the night, and only the great prince of the Geats has the strength and courage to defeat him. Beowulf's terrifying quest to destroy Grendel, the foul fiend, a hideous sea-hag and a monstrous fire-dragon is the oldest surviving epic in British literature. Artfully retold and magnificently illustrated, this companion volume to Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is made instantly accessible to children by a formidable children's book partnership.\n\nText rationale:\n\nThis is a key text in Anglo-Saxon literature, which delves into the historical period with detail and provides children with a rich background knowledge of the time. Re-told by significant children’s author Michael Morpurgo, this is the oldest surviving epic in British literature and includes examples of old-English language which will inspire children’s own writing. The book also provides a companion to Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.\n\nLinks and themes:\n\nClassic fiction, narrative poetry, Denmark, Old English, monsters, dragons, bravery, intrigue, betrayal, loyalty\n\nDate written: October 2018\n\nA Spelling Seed is available for Beowulf.\n\nSpelling Seed Overview:\n\nOverview:\n\nThis is a three-session spelling seed for the book Beowulf by Michael Morpurgo.
