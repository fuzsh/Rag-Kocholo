To understand something, we first must understand something about its surroundings and conditions of possibility. A phenomenon takes place within a given context, an environment, and thinking critically requires that we first understand something about this context and the conditions under which the taking place of the phenomenon is possible. A human being, for example, lives within a certain natural environment, and to think critically about being human requires that we first understand something about the environmental conditions in which a human being lives and under which a human being flourish.\n\nThis course is devoted to the study of environments. From the air and water of the natural environment to the social media platforms and cellphone apps of the digital environment, it will focus on environmental contexts and conditions to foster independent critical thinking and writing skills. It is divided into four sections: natural environments, built environments, cultural environments, and digital environments. The first section will address various questions concerning ecology, climate change and the Anthropocene; the second will touch on issues of urban living and combined and uneven geographical development; the third will discuss language use, the culture industry, and politics and ideology; and the fourth will touch on the Internet, social media, and technological advances.\n\nENGL 160 Academic Writing I: Writing in Academic and Public Contexts\n\nCRN: 23296\n\nDays/Time: MW 8:00-9:15\n\nInstructor: Zara Imran\n\nThis course will explore the central questions regarding Otherness as a concept and phenomenon. What do we mean by the ‘other’? How and why do people, cultures, and societies create others amongst themselves? How are these others understood and represented in different mediums and across time?\n\nIn seeing how the other as a category is self-created and one that fluctuates, we will try to critically reflect upon our own selves. The other is never created in a vacuum and is always described against and through ‘the self’. Reflection upon the self is crucial to understand what historic and present functions categories of ‘others’ play in our lives. To begin to think about these questions this course will largely be divided into four thematic modules. Each module will try to grapple with these questions whilst we focus on different forms of otherness.\n\nENGL 160 Writing Home\n\nCRN: 11828 Days/Time: MW 8:00-9:15\n\nInstructor: Ryan Nordle\n\nHow do we define ‘home’? Where are the limits of a home? How do we transition from one home to the next? Is home a feeling? Is it a place? Is it people? This course will take these as its guiding questions. We will explore the concept of home through the process of writing and develop our writing process through the concept of home. While this course will broadly instruct on principles of academic writing, you will specifically learn about and demonstrate competence in writing within four genres: personal narrative, photo essay, argumentative essay, and reflective essay. These four writing projects will be the focus of the units in this course, all designed to prepare your writing for entering public and academic spheres.\n\nENGL 160 Academic Writing I\n\nCRN: 41816\n\nDays/Time: MW 9:30-10:45\n\nInstructor: Seunghyun Shin\n\nIn this section of English 160, we will examine non-fiction literary genres. As a tutorial composition course designed for freshmen who came to the university to try to carve a new life, through the next fifteen weeks, you will be guided to the world of fundamental writing by working on four projects: Memoir, Editorial, Indie Game Review, and Reflection. All semester long you will work step-by-step writing about yourself, your community, what you love, and ultimately, what you want to do as a young scholar. Our class will function as a collective writing community where reading, research, philosophy, theory, controversial issues, and your own writing will be shared and discussed daily. Academic writing is a process that develops because of critical thinking and critical reading, and it takes shape via the ever-continuing process of both creative and critical thinking.\n\nENGL 160 Writing Home\n\nCRN: 38996\n\nDays/Time: MW 9:30-10:45\n\nInstructor: Seunghyun Shin\n\nHow do we define ‘home’?

This course will orient students to genre-writing and the rhetorical situation through a framework of “daring to disagree” with systems of oppression and injustice. Students will read and analyze different mediums and genres of writing, including podcasts, speeches, films, songs, memes, TikToks, as well as academic articles and scholarly monographs. We will engage these texts through in-class discussion, journaling, group activities, as well as formal and informal writing assignments. By the end of the semester, students will have created a portfolio of work that reflects the different ways in which writing can be a “political gesture that challenges the politics of domination” (8).\n\nENGL 160 Academic Writing I: Writing in Academic and Public Contexts\n\nCRN: 30663\n\nDays/Time: MW 9.30-10.45\n\nInstructor: Zara Imran\n\n“This course will explore the central questions regarding Otherness as a concept and phenomenon.

Perhaps you have observed it yourself in Chicago and its surrounding suburbs. Critics of gentrification see it as the destroyer of neighborhoods, believing that it represents a form of social cleansing and institutionalized racism. Supporters of gentrification think it is the savior of cities and claim that change is inevitable. They believe that the renovation of certain neighborhoods brings prosperity and increased public safety.\n\nIn this ENGL 160 class, we will enter the debate about gentrification through class discussions and four writing projects. This course aims to give you opportunities to practice the kind of writing and speaking skills that will serve you for a lifetime.\n\nENGL 160 Gentrification\n\nCRN: 21630\n\nDays/Time: MW 4:30-5:45\n\nInstructor: Sian Roberts\n\nGentrification is sweeping through America. Perhaps you have observed it yourself in Chicago and its surrounding suburbs. Critics of gentrification see it as the destroyer of neighborhoods, believing that it represents a form of social cleansing and institutionalized racism. Supporters of gentrification think it is the savior of cities and claim that change is inevitable. They believe that the renovation of certain neighborhoods brings prosperity and increased public safety.\n\nIn these 160 classes, we will enter the debate about gentrification through class discussions and four writing projects. This course aims to give you opportunities to practice the kind of writing and speaking skills that will serve you for a lifetime.\n\nENGL 160 Academic Writing 1: Writing in Public and Academic Contexts\n\nCRN: 11496\n\nDays/Time: MWF 8:00-8:50\n\nInstructor: Scott Grunow\n\nInformation is not knowledge. – Albert Einstein\n\nThe readings in this course will explore a range of issues, such as relationships with neighbors during the pandemic and the role of Amazon in the global economy, that are and will be relevant to your experience as citizens of the UIC campus community of thinkers, readers, and writers. You will be embarking a journey that will begin with closely observing and describing information. Then, we will focus on analyzing this information in relation to multiple experiences and viewpoints, and finally, you will develop the confidence to make the move from information to knowledge, though developing skills in applying, analyzing, and evaluating, and ultimately, writing argument-based assignments. We will emphasize, overall, in this class, making the transition to college-level thinking, reading, and writing through a range of interactive activities in and outside of class.\n\nENGL 160 This, Not That: The Art of Making Distinctions\n\nCRN: 11339\n\nDays/Time: MWF 9:00-9:50\n\nInstructor: Joseph Staten\n\nThis class is based on two core ideas: 1. Good, clear writing is nothing other than good, clear thinking. 2. The basis of good, clear thinking is the ability to distinguish—to make “”distinctions””—between two things that are different from one another. Distinctions can be as trivial and ordinary as “”basketball vs. baseball,”” or as complex as “”good vs. evil,”” and it doesn’t take long to discover how foundational distinctions are not only to thinking and writing but to society itself. In this class, we will develop and sharpen our capacity for distinction making—and therefore our capacity for understanding our world as well.\n\nReadings will be drawn from a diverse range of clear thinkers (and wonderfully clear writers), from ancient philosophers such as Aristotle to contemporary essayists such as Joan Didion and James Baldwin. We will apply the lessons learned from these writers to four genre-based writing assignments, which may include memoir, arts criticism, argumentative essay, reflective essay, and/or others.\n\nENGL 160 Academic Writing 1: Writing in Public and Academic Contexts\n\nCRN: 11792\n\nDays/Time: MWF 9:00-9:50\n\nInstructor: Scott Grunow\n\nInformation is not knowledge. – Albert Einstein\n\nThe readings in this course will explore a range of issues, such as relationships with neighbors during the pandemic and the role of Amazon in the global economy, that are and will be relevant to your experience as citizens of the UIC campus community of thinkers, readers, and writers. You will be embarking a journey that will begin with closely observing and describing information. Then, we will focus on analyzing this information in relation to multiple experiences and viewpoints, and finally, you will develop the confidence to make the move from information to knowledge, though developing skills in applying, analyzing, and evaluating, and ultimately, writing argument-based assignments. We will emphasize, overall, in this class, making the transition to college-level thinking, reading, and writing through a range of interactive activities in and outside of class.\n\nENGL 160 Academic Writing I: Haunted People, Places, and Spaces\n\nCRN: 46717\n\nDays/Time: MWF 10:00-10:50\n\nInstructor: Carla Barger\n\nIn this class you’ll think and write about hauntings in film and literature. You’ll look at adaptations of authors like the Brontes, Dickens, and Poe and films like The Others. You’ll also read and discuss ideas by thinkers like Sigmund Freud and Avery Gordon as well as folklore from cultures around the world that attempt to explain how and why people and places are haunted.\n\nOur theme is hauntings, but your main concern will be learning to identify and analyze different genres so that you can communicate effectively to various audiences. By the end of the semester, you’ll be able to discern genre conventions and deploy them successfully in both academic and professional settings, and you will have gained valuable project and time management skills that will prove useful to you throughout your college career and beyond.\n\nENGL 160 Writing in Academic and Public Contexts: Pop Music and Politics\n\nCRN: 41625\n\nDays/Time: MWF 10:00-10:50\n\nInstructor: Chris Glomski\n\nIn “Popular Music and Politics,” we will investigate subjects that may find us debating such questions as: “How does popular music reflect and comment on contemporaneous social and political issues?” “What might something so basic, so essential, as the music we listen to reveal about our social class or political beliefs?” “Can mere ideas or artistic creations ever be dangerous enough to warrant regulation?” While these questions provide the context for our writing, our goal is to learn about the conventions of academic discourse and writing, not just about pop music or politics. Therefore, in addition to our inquiries into these subjects, we will also spend time learning to engage actively with course texts, to work on sharpening mechanics, and to write effectively in a variety of genres. All of this will culminate in a final reflective project pertaining to your experiences in English 160.\n\nENGL 160 Race, Gender, and Digital Culture\n\nCRN: 11551\n\nDays/Time: MWF 10:00-10:50\n\nInstructor: Dez Brown\n\nIn this course, we will use an interdisciplinary approach to investigate complex issues present in digital and popular culture. Students will engage in an intersectional analysis that considers the ways in which race and gender (as well as class, sexuality, age, disability, and other socially constructed categories of identity) are formed, embodied, and policed in the United States, especially in digital spaces and productions. Careful investigation of the hegemonic structure and intent behind technology and digital culture (e.g., AI reproduction of human-created art, avatar creation in video games) through course readings and sustained exploration of popular genres (e.g., television, video games), will prepare students for writing projects and other major assignments in the course. Our goal will be to gain tools to be able to write and communicate effectively in general, but especially about the relationships between socially constructed identities and a myriad of technologies.\n\nENGL 160 Academic Writing I: Writing the Image\n\nCRN: 46725\n\nDays/Time: MWF 10:00-10:50\n\nInstructor: Kabel Mishka Ligot\n\nIn this class, you will explore the many and varied ways humans see, read, and engage with the still image, particularly paintings, illustrations, and photographs. In our meetings, will discuss and question how still images create meanings and arguments out of the world we live in. Through ekphrastic essays, reviews, and comparative genre studies, you will learn to articulate your thoughts and feelings about visuals that we encounter online, in museums, in books, in popular media, and in everyday life. We will also discover ways to integrate meaningful visual aspects in our own rhetorical and argumentative moves. This is not an art history course: you are not required to have any background in art theory or visual art to sufficiently participate in the class.\n\nENGL 160 Academic Writing I: Haunted People, Places, and Spaces\n\nCRN: 46715\n\nDays/Time: MWF 11:00-11:50\n\nInstructor: Carla Barger\n\nIn this class you’ll think and write about hauntings in film and literature. You’ll look at adaptations of authors like the Brontes, Dickens, and Poe and films like The Others.

The two styles of writing we’ll work in are the personal essay (aka. memoir) and the argumentative or critical essay. In these, you can use the song’s lyrics to reflect on yourself or events in your life; they can also help you talk about the broader world (e.g., violence, racism, sexism). We’ll also learn how to make arguments (and counterarguments) about the music itself. This course often helps students realize what a large role music has in their world.\n\nWriting often does not start with writing. Writing often does not start with words at all. Often writing starts with a feeling and the writing of words is an attempt to capture that feeling. It can be elusive, but therefore good writing is hard and there is so much bad writing. Everyone has feelings; not everyone takes the time or has the skill to make those feelings into words that evoke feelings in other people. This is one thing writing shares with music. Kind of magic in both cases.\n\nENGL 160 Academic Writing I: Art and Social Change\n\nCRN: 46732\n\nDays/Time: MWF 12:00-12:50\n\nInstructor: Mohammed AlQaisi\n\nWords are the only tools you will be given. Learn to use them with originality and care. Value them for their strength and diversity. And remember that somebody out there is listening.” – William Zinsser\n\nIn this course you will learn how to effectively express yourself through writing using works of art that address important social issues; you will do this primarily by utilizing and honing your writing skills in four writing projects: a review, an analysis, an argument, and a reflective essay. Through individual and partner work, you will sharpen your ability to edit and revise your writing. You will learn how to navigate and use various academic resources available to you on campus and online. Your assignments will focus on art, specifically movies, paintings and works of literature. By the end of the semester, you should come away with knowledge of writing strategies that will be useful to you throughout your college career.\n\nENGL 160 Gangsters on Film\n\nCRN: 30668\n\nDays/Time: MWF 12:00-12:50\n\nInstructor: Sibyl Gallus-Price\n\nAs Scarface sits in his whirlpool tub smoking a Cuban cigar, he shouts at a financial planning ad on tv: “You know what capitalism is? Getting f****ed!” Montana’s statement not only raises questions about America’s attachment to ideas of sound investment, prosperity, and financial responsibility, but capitalism’s complex and often concealed relationship with the economic underworld of organized crime. In looking at films like Scarface (1983), Goodfellas (1990), City of God (Cidade de Deus) (2002), and American Gangster (2007) we’ll discuss how this major genre serves as a lens to magnify the contradictions of our social conditions. In doing so we’ll address the kind of characters that have become central to the genre: How is the gangster represented, who’s being represented, who isn’t, and why? Does gangster film call us to admire these cowboys of capitalism or offer us a view of the hollowness of the American Dream? Our major writing projects will include the film review, the photo essay, the analytical essay, and a multimodal final reflective project.\n\nENGL 160 Second City: Space & Place in and Around Chicago\n\nRN: 25927\n\nDays/Time: MWF 12:00-12:50\n\nInstructor: Margaux Brown\n\nWe are all members of the UIC community, and we come to UIC with our own unique social and cultural backgrounds that shape our experiences, beliefs, and values down to how we express ourselves through written and spoken language. In this course we will explore and consider the spaces and places that are around us from the broad range of the city of Chicago to smaller neighborhoods and communities like UIC. You will write a profile and review that will draw attention to local communities and though an argumentative essay you will draw important attention to an issue that affects a specific local community. Through these different genres and engaging in rhetorical situations around them you will explore and learn the necessary critical reading and writing skills to be successful in your academic career.\n\nENGL 160 Academic Writing I: Treat Yo Self: Self-Care and Self-Help in 2023\n\nCRN: 27283\n\nDays/Time: MWF 12:00-1250\n\nInstructor: Katie Brandt\n\nIn this class, we will explore a variety of issues related to the larger course theme of “Self-Care and Self-Help”—that is, what it means to take care of oneself holistically in the strangeness of life post-2020. Throughout the semester, we will learn about multiple self-care methods; practice, criticize, and evaluate methods of self-care; discuss barriers to self-care; and explore the self-help industry as it has evolved from the 20th to 21st century. Some questions we will be thinking about broadly this semester include: How do I define self-care? (Why) is it important to engage in self-care? What methods of self-care work best for me? What are the social, economic, political, racial, gendered, etc. barriers that exist to certain self-care methods? How and why has the self-help industry emerged in America throughout the last century? Perhaps most importantly, we will constantly be questioning how reading and writing can help one engage in self-care.\n\nWe will work within numerous genres and writing styles, including reading some challenging texts. By reading and analyzing a variety of texts within the theme of “Self-Care and Self-Help,” our goal is to understand the nuances of genre and situation, rhetoric, and style to become articulate and engaging writers for a wide range of purposes and audiences. Genres that we will focus on (but are not limited to) include listicle, review, annotated bibliography, anthology, argument, self-reflection, and evaluation. You need not master each of these genres nor the course topic by the end of the semester; rather, the goal is to learn about and experiment with these genres to develop your writing skills, discover your own writing strengths and challenges, and explore the course theme of “Self-Care and Self-Help” in a meaningful way.\n\nENGL 160 Academic Writing I: Writing in Academic and Public Contexts\n\nCRN: 11575\n\nDays/Time: MWF 1:00-1:50\n\nInstructor: Eman Elturki\n\nIn an increasingly globalized world and with the abundance of diverse modes of communication, what does be “literate” mean? Is it the ability to read and write? Are these abilities sufficient in the 21st century? In this course, we are going to explore what the term “literacy” entails in a rapidly developing world. This exploration will include examining the conventional view of literacy and how this view has evolved to include new literacies and multiliteracies such as information literacy, digital literacy, cultural literacy, media literacy, visual literacy, and more. We will look at how literacy is conceptualized from opposing theoretical perspectives; is the construction of literacy a cognitive activity or a social practice? We will also tackle literacy-related issues such as identity, power, gender as well as the impact of literacy/multiliteracies on health, socioeconomic status, and the economy at large. The course will involve in-class activities, student-facilitated discussions, and mini reading quizzes. These learning tasks and shorter assignments will enhance your critical reading skills, build knowledge of genre and writing, offer opportunities to expand areas of literacy such as information and digital literacies, and help you prepare for the major writing assignments. These assignments involve composing multiple drafts of a literacy autobiography, a definition essay, an evidence-based problem-solution paper, and a final reflection. By engaging in this course work, you will advance your critical reading and academic writing skills.\n\nENGL 160 Academic Writing I: Writing in Academic and Public Contexts\n\nCRN: 30965\n\nDays/Time: MWF 1:00-1:50\n\nInstructor: Thomas Moore\n\nMovies, music, and stories are something we all love to watch, listen to, and read. They soothe us, make us laugh, and make us cry. What we don’t often think about, though, beyond the way they make us feel, is the fact that these feelings are always accompanied by an interpretation. In this class, we will slow down our process of consuming media and think carefully about the ways in which we interpret it, as well as train ourselves to pay extremely close attention to the ways these works are constructed and the choices the artists and authors make as they create them.\n\nENGL 160 Deep Fried & Delicious: A Taste of the Fast-Food Industry\n\nCRN: 38997\n\nDays/Time: MWF 1:00-1:50\n\nInstructor: Travis Mandell\n\nIn this course, we will engage in a semester-long investigation of the Fast-Food Industry and its impacts on society at large (both in the U.S and Globally). We will read texts that interrogate the industry’s influence on culture, economy, environment, and physical health. We will discuss countering points of view on the different issues, ranging from worker minimum wage to the impact of “”food swamps”” in varying communities, and analyze the various debates taking place across different fields of inquiry. Argument is the lifeblood of knowledge and being able to present your own voice is essential to furthering the conversation.\n\nThrough lectures, in-class discussions, group writing sessions, debates, and writing projects, this class will prepare you to participate in the academic discourse surrounding any subject you may choose in the future. By understanding rhetoric and the conceptualization of argument, conducting comparative analytic techniques, accessing scientific scholarly content, writing an argumentative essay, and reflecting on your own writing process, you will become well versed in the art of academic writing. We will be reading scholarly essays (peer-reviewed) as well as popular articles to help broaden our understanding of genre/audience regarding the Fast-Food Industry. Ultimately, the purpose of this course is to prepare you for the rest of your academic career at UIC (and beyond), fostering a strong foundation for your academic writing skills and argumentation that can be used in whatever specific discipline/major you pursue.\n\nENGL 160 Academic Writing I: Writing in Academic and Public Context\n\nCRN: 42864\n\nDays/Time: MWF 1:00-1:50\n\nInstructor: Keegan Lannon\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Marshall McLuhan made the then controversial claim that “the medium is the message.” For McLuhan, he was concerned about the use of the TV as a means for disseminating information, and he argued that the device used to communicate will necessarily change the content and the character of the message. In this course, we will continue McLuhan’s line of inquiry, examining the past, current and (potential) future communication technologies to see how these might influence what we say and how we say it, both in academic and public contexts.\n\nENGL 160 Second City: Space & Place in and Around Chicago\n\nCRN: 29462\n\nDays/Time: MWF 1:00-1:50\n\nInstructor: Margaux Brown\n\nWe are all members of the UIC community, and we come to UIC with our own unique social and cultural backgrounds that shape our experiences, beliefs, and values down to how we express ourselves through written and spoken language. In this course we will explore and consider the spaces and places that are around us from the broad range of the city of Chicago to smaller neighborhoods and communities like UIC. You will write a profile and review that will draw attention to local communities and though an argumentative essay you will draw important attention to an issue that affects a specific local community. Through these different genres and engaging in rhetorical situations around them you will explore and learn the necessary critical reading and writing skills to be successful in your academic career.\n\nENGL 160 Academic Writing I: Writing in Academic and Public Contexts; Writing Towards the Arts\n\nCRN: 11759\n\nDays/Time: MWF 1:00-1:50\n\nInstructor: Jay Yencich\n\nWhile much of the buzz of the last twenty years has been about the STEM fields—Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics—many universities and secondary schools have recently recognized that a creative component is necessary to spur innovation in those same disciplines. Hence, many have argued for a “Arts” to fill out the acronym—STEAM—thus re-integrating humanities elements traditional to higher education. In this section of English 160, we will be using the foundations of the UIC composition program, focusing on genre and situation, to explore the world of the arts. We will begin with photography and build up writing involvement and critical scrutiny through the worlds of music and film before finally concluding with a work of literature spanning a few hundred pages, be it a novel, a play, a collection of short stories, a book of poems, or a set of essays. Through these lenses, we will examine the status of these art forms, what goes into evaluating them, and their relationship with society at large.\n\nENGL 160 Academic Writing I: Writing in Academic and Public Contexts\n\nCRN: 11788\n\nDays/Time: MWF 2:00-2:50\n\nInstructor: Thomas Moore\n\nMovies, music, and stories are something we all love to watch, listen to, and read. They soothe us, make us laugh, and make us cry. What we don’t often think about, though, beyond the way they make us feel, is the fact that these feelings are always accompanied by an interpretation. In this class, we will slow down our process of consuming media and think carefully about the ways in which we interpret it, as well as train ourselves to pay extremely close attention to the ways these works are constructed and the choices the artists and authors make as they create them.\n\nENGL 160 Deep Fried & Delicious: A Taste of the Fast-Food Industry\n\nCRN: 11809\n\nDays/Time: MWF 2:00-2:50\n\nInstructor: Travis Mandell\n\nIn this course, we will engage in a semester-long investigation of the Fast-Food Industry and its impacts on society at large (both in the U.S and Globally). We will read texts that interrogate the industry’s influence on culture, economy, environment, and physical health. We will discuss countering points of view on the different issues, ranging from worker minimum wage to the impact of “”food swamps”” in varying communities, and analyze the various debates taking place across different fields of inquiry. Argument is the lifeblood of knowledge and being able to present your own voice is essential to furthering the conversation.\n\nThrough lectures, in-class discussions, group writing sessions, debates, and writing projects, this class will prepare you to participate in the academic discourse surrounding any subject you may choose in the future. By understanding rhetoric and the conceptualization of argument, conducting comparative analytic techniques, accessing scientific scholarly content, writing an argumentative essay, and reflecting on your own writing process, you will become well versed in the art of academic writing. We will be reading scholarly essays (peer-reviewed) as well as popular articles to help broaden our understanding of genre/audience regarding the Fast-Food Industry. Ultimately, the purpose of this course is to prepare you for the rest of your academic career at UIC (and beyond), fostering a strong foundation for your academic writing skills and argumentation that can be used in whatever specific discipline/major you pursue.\n\nENGL 160 Academic Writing I: Writing in Academic and Public Context\n\nCRN: 11330\n\nDays/Time: MWF 2:00-2:50\n\nInstructor: Doug Sheldon\n\nCrime, Detection, and Scandal:\n\nIn this course we will examine the representations of illegality within texts presented in popular form. We will interrogate the complex definitions of each genre and how we use it to understand illegality in and written, visual, and verbal context. Working with texts that range from mystery, scandal history, graphic novels, and film adaptations, this course will attempt to produce plausible answers to the following questions: What defines a crime or scandal? What value is placed on the detective or investigator as a hero? Who benefits from creating objects of illegality? How do the separate modes of presentation (text v. film v. comic) engage us with these cultural concepts? Students in this class will be able to use these concepts to examine our cultural and legal systems, which produce, value, and challenge these genres and use those skills to produce texts that interrogate and investigate those systems.\n\nENGL 160 Academic Writing I: Writing in Academic and Public Context\n\nCRN: 11327\n\nDays/Time: MWF 2:00-2:50\n\nInstructor: Keegan Lannon\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Marshall McLuhan made the then controversial claim that “the medium is the message.” For McLuhan, he was concerned about the use of the TV as a means for disseminating information, and he argued that the device used to communicate will necessarily change the content and the character of the message. In this course, we will continue McLuhan’s line of inquiry, examining the past, current and (potential) future communication technologies to see how these might influence what we say and how we say it, both in academic and public contexts.\n\nENGL 160 Unfinished Business: How the Past Shapes the Present\n\nCRN: 46713\n\nDays/Time: TR 8:00-9:15\n\nInstructor: Kris Chen\n\nThis synchronous online course will explore key events in the United States that occurred in the second half of the twentieth century that have ties to present-day social issues. This is a heavily history-oriented writing class. Topics discussed in class with include (but are not limited to): vaccines, civil rights, key Supreme Court cases, education, environmental protections, LGBTQ+, political corruption, reproductive rights, unions, and voting. In this class, you will write an op-ed piece, a film review, and an argumentative essay. The final paper for this class will be a reflective essay. Short writing assignments and peer reviews are also incorporated into the class.\n\nENGL 160 Academic Writing I\n\nCRN: 11343\n\nDays/Time: TR 8:00-9:15\n\nInstructor: Ryan Croken\n\nFrom the perils of climate change to the devastation of mass extinction, the beauty and bounty of this planet are increasingly threatened by the ecological crisis brought about by human industrial society. How do we conceive of ourselves, and communicate with one another, at this critical point in our planetary history? In this course students will develop a conceptual framework through which to approach such a question. Concurrently, you will cultivate the requisite skills to express yourselves in various genre forms, including a letter to future generations, an op-ed, an argument-based academic essay, and a self-reflective essay with the option for a creative component.\n\nThese efforts will help prepare you to effectively participate in public conversations pertaining to environmental issues—as well as related issues of social consequence—that will serve you throughout your careers at UIC and beyond. Particular attention will be paid to climate change, environmental justice, activism, ecopsychology, and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nENGL 160 Academic Writing I: Writing in Academic and Public Contexts\n\nCRN: 11331\n\nDays/Time: TR 8:00-9:15 ONLINE\n\nInstructor: Ling He\n\nThis course will be taught fully online for the entire Fall 2023 semester. The sessions will be conducted synchronously on Tuesday and Thursday on Blackboard Collaborate. You will need to have access to your own computer and a high-speed Internet Service Provider. Specific guides for the course site login will be sent to you by email before the first day of the semester.\n\nENGL160 is designed and taught using genre-based pedagogy, viewing the genre as the common form of responding to similar situations that shape writing. From this lens, the course is structured around four writing projects to help you develop genre-specific knowledge through attention to the writing purposes, audience, and context. You will learn how to write five academic genres: Reading Summary, Reading Response, Argumentation, Rhetorical Analysis, and Reflection, in addition to public writing using social media. These genre-based writing strategies help ensure your success in writing for your university coursework and specific rhetorical situations and appeals. Reading is integrated into writing for topical knowledge, modeling, and genre analyses. ENGL160 features student-centered learning, offering frequent opportunities to write with ongoing instructor feedback on multiple drafts and teacher-student interactions in and after class.\n\nENGL 160 Academic Writing I: Writing in Academic and Public Contexts\n\nCRN: 38998\n\nDays/Time: TR 8:00-9:15 ONLINE\n\nInstructor: Catherine Vlahos\n\nIn this online synchronous class, we will be reading, discussing, and writing about heroes and modern culture. What is a hero, and how does this idea change across time and culture? Who can be heroic, and how? Was there ever a time you acted heroically? Why is the world so obsessed with superhero movies? Why do we like anti-heroes as much as traditional heroes, and do both types exist in real life?\n\nYou will write about these questions and more in the form of online journal entries, short in-class writings, and 4 major writing projects: a memoir, a news article, a persuasive essay, and a digital story.\n\nENGL 160 Academic Writing I: Writing on Social Issues in Film\n\nCRN: 46739\n\nDays/Time: TR 8:00-9:15\n\nInstructor: Eric Pahre\n\nIn this course, you will examine how popular films explore and portray different facets of common social issues, and how the discourse of film critics and academics further examine these topics and create important conversations between creators, critics, and the viewer or reader. You will watch several 21st-century films, some offering direct social satire or commentary and others working on a more subdued level. These topics include racism, gender inequality, classism, income inequality, and capitalism. Over the course of the semester, you will work to thoughtfully interpret and discuss the challenging content of these films and learn to write about deeper meaning while bringing films and reviews into conversations with one another. You will write multiple reviews of films with the goal of engaging with the ideas behind the films, and you will write an argumentative essay advocating for the presence, importance, details, or meaning of these ideas. The final goal of this class is to use these topics to become a more thoughtful and articulate academic writer. By the end of course, you should feel more confident in writing not only about challenging topics in film but also about the real-world issues that we find present in all types of media we encounter throughout our lives.\n\nENGL 160 Academic Writing I: Writing on Social Issues in Film\n\nCRN: 41621\n\nDays/Time: TR 9:30-10:45\n\nInstructor: Eric Pahre\n\nIn this course, you will examine how popular films explore and portray different facets of common social issues, and how the discourse of film critics and academics further examine these topics and create important conversations between creators, critics, and the viewer or reader.

This semester, you will embark on a journey through different genres of writing focusing on the rhetorical strategies used by scholars to convey their message to the reader. Whole group discussions, small group discussions and writing activities will further cement concepts and ideas presented within each text. Four writing genres will be explored: the Literary Analysis Essay, the Definition Essay, the Argumentative Essay, and the Reflective Essay. In addition to peer-review sessions, you will also receive feedback from your instructor to help produce clear and thought-provoking writing projects. The theme for this course centers on the dynamic relationship between self and society.\n\nENGL 160 Academic Writing I: Writing in Academic and Public Contexts: Writing about Sound\n\nCRN: 27280\n\nDays/Time: TR 9:30-10:45\n\nInstructor: Eniko Vaghy\n\nIn this course, you will investigate the significance of sound at the personal, social/cultural, and political level. Through discussions, analyses, and assignments focused on environmental sound, personal sound/speech, music, as well as other topics concerning sonic production, we will approach questions such as: “Is it possible for sounds to represent the cultural or political landscape of a certain place?” “Can you discern unrest and strife—or, conversely, joy—just by listening to the world around you?” “What are the politics contained in code-switching and personal dialect alterations?” “What biases do we inflict on others based on the way they speak?” To answer these questions, you will participate in sound walks, listen to podcasts, read articles and stories about sound, contribute to in-class discussions, and write informal reflections as well as longer papers on sound. By this, you will strengthen and diversify your writing, reading, and listening skills.\n\nENGL 160 Academic Writing I: Writing in Academic and Public Contexts\n\nCRN: 11543\n\nDays/Time: TR 9:30-10:45 ONLINE\n\nInstructor: Ling He\n\nThis course will be taught fully online for the entire Fall 2023 semester.

Climate change. Police brutality. Government surveillance. Artificial Intelligence. The line between reality and dystopia is becoming increasingly blurred. From images of nuclear holocaust to Philip K Dick’s pre-crime division, we will examine popular depictions of dystopia in the modern world to help us better understand what it is, why we engage with dystopic tropes, and what we stand to learn from engaging with them. To better understand the power of tales of dystopia to spur social change, we will examine movies, movie reviews, short stories, emergent narrative video games, formal analyses, and argumentative essays. Along the way, we will focus on areas key to reading and writing at the college level, including genre, form, rhetoric, and argumentation. In this English 160 course, you will learn how to effectively express yourself through writing and gain the tools necessary for success in a range of writing situations both in your academic career here at UIC and beyond.\n\nENGL 160 Academic Writing I\n\nCRN: 11583 Days/Time: TR 11:00-12:15\n\nInstructor: Ryan Croken\n\nFrom the perils of climate change to the devastation of mass extinction, the beauty and bounty of this planet are increasingly threatened by the ecological crisis brought about by human industrial society.

Or that you should avoid contractions (like “don’t” and “can’t”) because they sound too informal?\n\nWhat about the five-paragraph essay (referred to as a “theme” back in the day)? Even if your teachers didn’t call it that, you will recognize its structure right away: an introduction and thesis that sets up three main points, three corresponding body paragraphs, and a conclusion that restates the introduction and begins with something like, “In conclusion…”\n\nWhile the five-paragraph essay can be useful in some specific writing situations (such as standardized tests), those who study and teach academic writing generally agree that it doesn’t prepare students for college writing. In addition, it rarely produces papers that are enjoyable to write or read.\n\nDon’t despair—the good news is that this course aims to challenge some outdated beliefs and unhelpful ideas about academic writing and replace them with habits and strategies that will serve you better as a college writer. We’ll accomplish this by focusing on situation, purpose, and audience, as well as prioritizing revision—significant changes to language and structure—over editing (corrections at the level of words and sentences). We’ll also practice critical thinking and reading skills, constructing cohesive paragraphs, writing for simplicity and concision, and finding, identifying, and working with sources. Finally, an important goal for this course is to make writing enjoyable in ways it might not have been for you in high school, and possibly shift your perception of yourself as a writer.\n\nENGL 160 Writing the Body and Understanding Empathy\n\nCRN: 23461\n\nDays/Time: TR 12:30-1:45\n\nInstructor: Lauren Keeley\n\nThe term “empathy” has become a buzzword of the COVID-19 pandemic, but what exactly does it mean to share and understand the feelings of another? How do we communicate pain, and why is doing so important? In this course, we will discuss the relationship between writing, illness, and the body. We will explore how language functions to communicate what is seemingly inexpressible (physical and mental pain) but fundamentally human and shared. You will get to write in a variety of genres, such as memoir, op-ed, and argumentative essay as we chart the boundaries between sickness and health. Finally, the class will provide a review of the grammar, editing and revision techniques that will prove useful to you throughout your time at UIC and beyond.\n\nENGL 160 Imagine That: Writing About Sci-fi and Speculative Fiction\n\nCRN: 32837\n\nDays/Time: TR 12:30-1:45\n\nInstructor: Rana Awwad\n\nIn this class, you will engage with a variety of different mediums (short stories, graphic novels, TV shows, films, critical engagements, etc.,) that explore the various themes and tropes that make up science fiction and speculative fiction. What role do the themes of (dis)connection, loneliness, found family, estrangement, etc. do for these genres? What kind of tropes are at play in sci-fi and speculative fiction and what do they do to complicate or reproduce the genres? Is there even a clear difference between these two genres? Centered around four major writing projects, this course will strengthen the reading, writing, and critical thinking skills you will need to write in academic and public contexts.\n\nENGL 160 Writing About Popular Media, Resistance, and Social Change\n\nCRN: 11534\n\nDays/Time: TR 12:30-1:45\n\nInstructor: Jennifer Rupert\n\nWhat does it mean to be “woke.” Do you believe that popular culture can be a force for social change or does mainstream popular culture mostly encourage “slacktivism”? In this course, we will explore the ways in which (mostly) American popular media— video games, film, television, books, social media, advertising, news reporting, and other forms of infotainment—heighten or diminish our social awareness and corresponding desire to act on social problems. As a starting point for this investigation, we will be reading a recent collection, Popular Culture, and the Civic Imagination: Case Studies of Creative Social Change (New York University Press, 2020). Students will utilize the theories generated by academics and activists to build original thinking on the popular media texts that matter most to them. A combination of in-class discussion, short writing assignments, and discussion board posts will not only prepare students to build arguments in three distinct genres—film analysis, opinion piece, and manifesto—but also to contribute to public conversations about pop culture and politics by transforming their academic prose into social media posts designed to heighten awareness of social issues for carefully chosen audiences. Through this course work, students will sharpen some of the most valuable skill sets for their future academic, personal, and professional lives: the ability to understand complex arguments, the ability to write clear, correct, and compelling prose, and the ability to assess various sorts of rhetorical situations to make successful presentations. In other words, students will begin to see the value of smart rhetorical choices in achieving their short- and long-term goals.\n\nENGL 160 Academic Writing I: Writing in Academic and Public Contexts: Examinations of Self and Society\n\nCRN: 46718\n\nDays/Time: TR 12:30-1:45\n\nInstructor: Sammie Marie Burton\n\nEnglish 160 is designed to expand on the critical-thinking and writing skills necessary for college success.

The topic of this class involves U.S. immigration, with a focus on migrants and undocumented immigrants from Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, as well other Latin American countries. We will explore the reasons migrants attempt to enter the U.S. from Mexico, either through seeking asylum or unlawful entry; the experiences of and challenges for undocumented immigrants from Latin America who have settled down and built lives in a country in which they’re not recognized or welcomed as citizens (including DACA recipients); the related politics, policies, and contention; and the potential (or not) for actual “immigration reform.” Through readings and writing assignments on this topic, you will gain skills in the strategies of writing in a variety of genres, including an academic argumentative essay. You will be responsible for four writing projects, the last of which will be a reflective essay that thoughtfully and thoroughly analyzes your own learning process as a writer.\n\nENGL 160 Academic Writing I: Writing in Academic and Public Contexts\n\nCRN: 41808\n\nDays/Time: TR 3:30-4:45\n\nInstructor: Lisa Stolley\n\nThis class will provide you the opportunity to engage in the process of writing in different situations and genres as well as help you become self-aware learners.

Students will utilize the theories generated by academics and activists to build original thinking on the popular media texts that matter most to them. A combination of in-class discussion, short writing assignments, and discussion board posts will not only prepare students to build arguments in three distinct genres—film analysis, opinion piece, and manifesto—but also to contribute to public conversations about pop culture and politics by transforming their academic prose into social media posts designed to heighten awareness of social issues for carefully chosen audiences. Through this course work, students will sharpen some of the most valuable skill sets for their future academic, personal, and professional lives: the ability to understand complex arguments, the ability to write clear, correct, and compelling prose, and the ability to assess various sorts of rhetorical situations to make successful presentations. In other words, students will begin to see the value of smart rhetorical choices in achieving their short- and long-term goals.\n\n161 Courses\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Contemporary Film and Culture\n\nCRN: 14388\n\nDays/Time: MWF 8:00-8:50\n\nInstructor: Ryan Nordle\n\nThis course will explore the role that contemporary film plays in culture, and that culture plays in film. By contemporary film, we mean the inter/national cinema of the last 50 years. In your examination of the connection between film and culture, you will develop your skills in academic writing and the research process. While this course will broadly instruct on principles of academic writing, you will specifically learn about and demonstrate competence in writing through four projects: an annotated bibliography, a research proposal, a literary review, and a research paper. These four writing projects will be the focus of the units in this course, all designed to prepare your writing for entering public and academic spheres.\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Female Networks and Feminist Resistances\n\nCRN: 41600\n\nDays/Time: MWF 8:00-8:50\n\nInstructor: Zara Imran\n\nThis course will investigate female networks of kinship/friendship and their relationship to feminist resistances. We will read a range of texts from various disciplines and critically analyze theoretical paradigms and feminist movements over time. It will provide you with a breadth of knowledge, exposing you to some central political and social movements, their criticisms and shortcomings, theorizations and complications of sisterhood, correspondences, etc. The primary goal of this course is to help students undertake independent research. Students should choose what aspect of the course they like and explore it that in depth in their own research projects.\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Unfinished Business: How Events of 1955-1975 Shape Our Present\n\nCRN: 32285\n\nDays/Time: MWF 8:00-8:50 Online\n\nInstructor: Kris Chen\n\nIn this synchronous online course, we will explore key events in the United States that occurred between 1955 and 1975 and have ties to present-day social issues. Topics discussed in class will include (but are not limited to): civil rights, counterculture, education reform, environmental protections, LGBTQ+ rights, Medicare, political corruption, reproductive rights, Russia, unions, and voting rights. In this class, you will select a present-day topic with ties to the 1955-1965 era in the United States to conduct a semester-long focused inquiry of that topic. Assignments will include four writing projects: an annotated bibliography, a project proposal, a literature review, and a research paper. Short writing assignments and peer reviews are also incorporated into the class.\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Contemporary Cinema and Modern Problems\n\nCRN: 14434\n\nDays/Time: MWF 8:00-8:50\n\nInstructor: Elliot Pahre\n\nThe social issues at the forefront of our conscience—inequality, discrimination, war, climate change, to list only a few—are prevalent in modern film and television to a degree that we as viewers may not feel prepared to engage with the deeper meaning of every piece of media we encounter. In this English 161 section, you will develop your ability to research and draft an academic essay by writing about the depiction of modern issues in contemporary cinema. You will work to thoughtfully interpret and discuss the challenging content of socially-minded films and learn to write about and argue for that deeper meaning. You will also learn to join an ongoing academic conversation about the representation of your chosen topic in popular film and media. You will focus your efforts towards one or two films and a central social topic and spend the bulk of the semester on the systematic and thorough development of your own, well-supported ideas in a semester-long project. You will create an annotated bibliography, research proposal, literature review, and end the semester with a thoroughly reasoned and researched essay.\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II. Rumors, Fear, and the Madness of Crowds: A Research Inquiry Into the Phenomenon of Mass Hysteria\n\nCRN: 30805\n\nDays/Time: MWF 8:00-8:50\n\nInstructor: Scott Grunow\n\nWhat psychosocial factors cause groups of persons to get involved in a disturbing dynamic of rumors, fears, and mass hysteria? In the late 20th and early 21st century in particular, one has noticed several cases of mass hysteria, ranging from the moral panics such as “Satanic” day care centers in the 1980s and Pizzagate, to the viral spread of conspiracy theories such as QAnon, all of which have caused incidents of persecution and mob violence. Yet many of these incidents contain roots in previous movements dating as far back as the medieval period, often related to fears about the end of the world, the apocalypse. In this course, you will learn to form your own inquiry about our topic of rumors, fear, and the madness of crowds by learning the skills of analytical and research-based writing. You will learn the essential elements of writing a social sciences academic research paper. The first part of the course will focus on honing accurate and critical reading skills by summarizing shorter assigned readings and beginning what will become the reference list/abstract for your research paper. You will begin exploring a general research topic related to the topic of the course, focusing on what and how an incident or pattern of crowd behavior occurred. The second part of the course will move from restating another author’s claims and evidence, “they say” to responding to them critically with an “I say, based on they say” using the reading and writing techniques of analysis and synthesis. You will begin to tie in your more specific research topic and the sources you summarized in the annotated reference list to multiple crowd theorists we will read in this unit. The third part will involve your individual path of inquiry and research on a specific topic with a research paper proposal and accompanying annotated reference list and the final research paper.\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Disability in Literature, Film, and Online Media\n\nCRN: 14384\n\nDays/Time: MW 8:00-9:15\n\nInstructor: Angelica Davila\n\nAlmost everyone will experience disability at some point in their lives. Despite this, disabled people continue to be treated as an afterthought of society. The same could be said for how disability is portrayed in various forms of media, such as literature, film, and online. In this section of English 161, we will analyze disability portrayal in the media and explore connections between media and society. How does disability portrayal in media translate into the field of education, politics, quality of daily living, and popular culture? We will focus on critically analyzing media, identifying issues, and researching a chosen topic within disability portrayal and society. This course’s final project will be a research paper where you will explore your chosen topic, engage critically with various sources, and enter a larger conversation through your academic writing.\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Language, Society, and Accessibility\n\nCRN: 14452\n\nDays/Time: MW 8:00-9:15 ONLINE\n\nInstructor: Antonio Guerrero\n\nOur focus in this online course will be to explore, question, and propose critical ideas about the ways we all learn, communicate, and interact. Among other topics, we will research and write about language, writing, social dynamics, education systems, and the way in which elements from our day-to-day lives translate to learning spaces and beyond. As you conduct a semester-long research project, you will begin exploring the ways in which online learning influences contemporary social structures, and vice versa. We will begin this research journey collectively by asking some key questions: how do we use knowledge as a measurement of individual merit? What influences our perception of value in society? What are tangible and rhetorical roles of learning spaces, and how do these contribute to our worldview? To try to answer these questions we will explore the structure of this very English course and our individual identities as members of our academic community. Doing so will allow us to analyze the role of learning ‘spaces’ across social structures and to posit why it is that knowledge, ideas, and communication hold such immense power in our lives.\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Writing for Inquiry and Research; Social Justice as the Mirror and the Lens\n\nCRN: 14427\n\nDays/Time: MW 8:00-9:15\n\nInstructor: Mark Magoon\n\nIn this section of English 161, which I have named “Social Justice as the Mirror and the Lens,” we will examine the topic of “social justice”—the fair and just relation between individuals and society as it relates to opportunity and social privilege—and we will use that topic to become better academic writers and researchers, but also to better understand ourselves and our world. Debates revolving around education, race, gender, identity, sexuality and the rhetoric that surrounds them are at the heart of many community and cultural discussions not only here in Chicago, but abroad too. In this course—one that will function as a writing community and safe space—we will take up questions surrounding the topic of social justice today. Through the examination of various forms of “texts”—scholarly, public, literary, visual, and cinematic—we will use our course topic to develop skills of critical reading, academic research, and writing.\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Oh, Horrors! Research Papers!\n\nCRN: 14473\n\nDays/Time: MW 8:00-9:15\n\nInstructor: Kian Bergstrom\n\nHorror. Terror. The uncanny. The weird. The gothic. The oneiric. The frightful. The supernatural. The haunted. The plagued. The ghastly. The dark. The dark. The dark. The dark. So dark. So very dark. The endless night. Forever the night. All work. No play. And Jack is a dull, dull boy… Hold my hand?\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Writing in the University\n\nCRN: 14394\n\nDays/Time: MWF 8:00-8:50\n\nInstructor: Pending\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Writing About Music and Society\n\nCRN: 44764\n\nDays/Time: MWF 8:00-8:50\n\nInstructor: Chris Muratore\n\nIn this class, you will learn about academic writing and the research process through the\n\nlens of writing about music. Specifically, we will be exploring how writing about a musical\n\npiece of your choice will allow you to discuss and examine important contemporary social and political issues such as gender equality and cultural appropriation. The class will therefore be structured around four projects– an annotated bibliography, a research proposal, a literary review and a research paper– which will culminate in the writing of an extended argumentative essay based on analysis of your own research. This will help you learn how to write in a clear and effective manner that will give you valuable communication skills both within academia and whatever career you choose to pursue after college.\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Writing for Inquiry and Research\n\nCRN: 14386\n\nDays/Time: MWF 9:00-9:50\n\nInstructor: Mishka Ligot\n\nFrom checking your phone right after waking up to scanning the cereal box while eating breakfast, from seeing the many posters and billboards on your morning commute to opening your textbooks for class, our lives are supersaturated with images. Through the stories they tell and represent, images can silently or explicitly evoke emotional, intellectual, or even spiritual responses in the people that view them. They can inspire people to think or (re)act in a specific way. In this course, you will be learning about the conventions and methods of academic research and writing. Through four projects (an annotated bibliography, a research proposal, a literature review, and a final research paper), you will use these approaches to find effective and compelling ways to talk about the images you encounter in your everyday life, and try to make sense of how they make sense of the world.\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Writing About Music and Society\n\nCRN: 14392\n\nDays/Time: MWF 9:00-9:50\n\nInstructor: Chris Muratore\n\nIn this class, you will learn about academic writing and the research process through the\n\nlens of writing about music. Specifically, we will be exploring how writing about a musical\n\npiece of your choice will allow you to discuss and examine important contemporary social and political issues such as gender equality and cultural appropriation. The class will therefore be structured around four projects– an annotated bibliography, a research proposal, a literary review and a research paper– which will culminate in the writing of an extended argumentative essay based on analysis of your own research. This will help you learn how to write in a clear and effective manner that will give you valuable communication skills both within academia and whatever career you choose to pursue after college.\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Writing for Inquiry and Research\n\nCRN: 42683\n\nDays/Time: MW 9:30-10:45 ONLINE\n\nInstructor: Karen Leick\n\n* This section meets online on Monday and Wednesday at 9:30 AM. Attendance at Zoom meetings is required.\n\nIn this course, we will look at the ways our social, educational, employment, and leisure activities are affected by technology. In addition, we will discuss the ways we think about the value and threat of technological developments. How do we understand the relationship between human “”progress”” and technology? What is the relationship between technology and power? Does technology make our lives better, or sometimes worse? Why is there often a negative public reaction to new technology?\n\nEach student will write a 10-page research paper about a controversial issue related to one of the topics that we have discussed in the course: Social Media, the Music Industry, Online Education, Video Games. In addition to short readings that we will discuss in class, students will find sources about their topic of interest to explore in more depth for their research papers. As we explore the major topics of the course, students will develop a research proposal, annotated bibliography, comparative essay, and the final research paper.\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Oh, Horrors! Research Papers!\n\nCRN: 14399\n\nDays/Time: MW 9:30-10:45\n\nInstructor: Kian Bergstrom\n\nHorror. Terror. The uncanny. The weird. The gothic. The oneiric. The frightful. The supernatural.

Brand\n\nIn this course, we will explore texts and cinematic examples of cutting-edge media forms: virtual reality, augmented reality, and atmospheric media. We will begin with theories and authorial visions that yearn for immersion in—or perhaps escape to—imaginary spaces (virtual reality), how these spaces can blur the lines between work and play, and the mixture of isolation and hyper-connectivity that various thinkers both promise and caution against. We will unpack our contemporary preoccupation with artificial objects and companions that join us in our real physical spaces (augmented reality), and finally we will consider the ways that machines can “see” us in unexpected ways and how they teach us to see ourselves, a growing ubiquity mediated by increasingly diffuse and invisible technologies (so-called “atmospheric” media). You should expect to read and write extensively as you develop a thesis-driven research project on a subtopic of your choosing. This project will unfold over several steps (annotated bibliography, review of literature, paper proposal, final paper) that span the entire semester and will serve as your entrée to the fundamentals of University-level research.\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Democracy and its Consequences\n\nCRN: 26192\n\nDays/Time: MWF 10:00-10:50\n\nInstructor: Abigail Kremer\n\nWe often think of democracy as a flawed, but “best as we can get” system. Surely, as we’ve seen with American democracy, it can be flawed, disrupted, and broken. In this class, we will examine, first, democracy as a system alone: what would it look like if democracy worked perfectly? In doing so we will analyze democracy’s practical application, and what it looks like in governments presently. We will also be working to understand democracy and its relationship to capitalism. That is, until inevitably, we explore what happens when and how democracies collapse.\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Writing, Seeing\n\nCRN: 14462\n\nDays/Time: MWF 10:00-10:50\n\nInstructor: Mishka Ligot\n\nFrom checking your phone right after waking up to scanning the cereal box while eating breakfast, from seeing the many posters and billboards on your morning commute to opening your textbooks for class, our lives are supersaturated with images. Through the stories they tell and represent, images can silently or explicitly evoke emotional, intellectual, or even spiritual responses in the people that view them. They can inspire people to think or (re)act in a specific way. In this course, you will be learning about the conventions and methods of academic research and writing. Through four projects (an annotated bibliography, a research proposal, a literature review, and a final research paper), you will use these approaches to find effective and compelling ways to talk about the images you encounter in your everyday life, and try to make sense of how they make sense of the world.\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Contemporary Film and Culture\n\nCRN: 43491\n\nDays/Time: MWF 10:00-10:50\n\nInstructor: Ryan Nordle\n\nThis course will explore the role that contemporary film plays in culture, and that culture plays in film. By contemporary film, we mean the inter/national cinema of the last 50 years. In your examination of the connection between film and culture, you will develop your skills in academic writing and the research process. While this course will broadly instruct on principles of academic writing, you will specifically learn about and demonstrate competence in writing through four projects: an annotated bibliography, a research proposal, a literary review, and a research paper. These four writing projects will be the focus of the units in this course, all designed to prepare your writing for entering public and academic spheres.\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Contemporary Cinema and Modern Problems\n\nCRN: 42686\n\nDays/Time: MWF 10:00-10:50\n\nInstructor: Elliot Pahre\n\nThe social issues at the forefront of our conscience—inequality, discrimination, war, climate change, to list only a few—are prevalent in modern film and television to a degree that we as viewers may not feel prepared to engage with the deeper meaning of every piece of media we encounter. In this English 161 section, you will develop your ability to research and draft an academic essay by writing about the depiction of modern issues in contemporary cinema. You will work to thoughtfully interpret and discuss the challenging content of socially-minded films and learn to write about and argue for that deeper meaning. You will also learn to join an ongoing academic conversation about the representation of your chosen topic in popular film and media. You will focus your efforts towards one or two films and a central social topic and spend the bulk of the semester on the systematic and thorough development of your own, well-supported ideas in a semester-long project. You will create an annotated bibliography, research proposal, literature review, and end the semester with a thoroughly reasoned and researched essay.\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Female Networks and Feminist Resistances\n\nCRN: 25973\n\nDays/Time: MWF 10:00-10:50\n\nInstructor: Zara Imran\n\nThis course will investigate female networks of kinship/friendship and their relationship to feminist resistances. We will read a range of texts from various disciplines and critically analyze theoretical paradigms and feminist movements over time. It will provide you with a breadth of knowledge, exposing you to some central political and social movements, their criticisms and shortcomings, theorizations and complications of sisterhood, correspondences, etc. The primary goal of this course is to help students undertake independent research. Students should choose what aspect of the course they like and explore it that in depth in their own research projects.\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Writing for Inquiry and Research\n\nCRN: 43494\n\nDays/Time: MWF 11:00-11:50\n\nInstructor: Ryan Asmussen\n\nThis course is designed to prepare you for the research and writing you will do throughout your academic career. Class discussion will involve class lecture and activities to assist you in engaging in the practice of academic discourse, which involves developing rhetorical, grammatical, and research skills. You will be required to read challenging academic texts, learn to navigate library databases, evaluate sources, write formal research assignments, write reflectively, and work in discussion/peer-editing groups.\n\nMore specifically, we will be focusing on disciplines associated with the humanities. What are the humanities? As opposed to STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), the humanities “includes, but is not limited to, the study and interpretation of the following: language, both modern and classical; linguistics; literature; history; jurisprudence; philosophy; archaeology; comparative religion; ethics; the history, criticism and theory of the arts; those aspects of the social sciences which have humanistic content and employ humanistic methods; and the study and application of the humanities to the human environment with particular attention to reflecting our diverse heritage, traditions, and history and to the relevance of the humanities to the current conditions of national life” (National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act, 1965, as amended).\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Unfinished Business: How Events of 1955-1975 Shape Our Present\n\nCRN: 14431\n\nDays/Time: MWF 11:00-11:50\n\nInstructor: Kris Chen\n\nThis course will explore key events in the United States that occurred between 1955 and 1975 and have ties to present-day social issues. Topics discussed in class will include (but are not limited to): civil rights, counterculture, education reform, environmental protections, LGBTQ+ rights, Medicare, political corruption, reproductive rights, Russia, unions, and voting rights. In this class, you will select a present-day topic with ties to the 1955-1965 era in the United States to conduct a semester-long focused inquiry of that topic. Assignments will include four writing projects: an annotated bibliography, a project proposal, a literature review, and a research paper. Short writing assignments and peer reviews are also incorporated into the class.\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Understanding Documentary\n\nCRN: 14474\n\nDays/Time: MWF 11:00-11:50\n\nInstructor: Seunghyun Shin\n\nIn this section of English 161, we will explore documentary works—not only documentary film but also photography, poetry, and stenography—and practice academic writing, research, and critical thinking. Although documentary was traditionally tied to historiography and ethnography, many intellectual works driven by documentary mode of discourse and the combination of aesthetic and rhetoric have become significant to any communities and cultural discussions around the world. In this course, we will take up questions in regard to documentary as more than a mode of discourse. Through the examination of various forms of texts—scholarly, public, literary, visual, and cinematic—we will practice critical reading, writing, and academic research.\n\nThroughout this course, you will explore and identify your interest and original argument broadly related to documentary works. By working on four projects—annotated bibliography, literature review, research proposal, and critical paper—you will practice culminating your argument into a thesis and contribute to the ongoing academic discussion of your interest.\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II: The Effects of Social Media on Body Image and Psychological Well-Being\n\nCRN: 32291\n\nDays/Time: MWF 10-10:50\n\nInstructor: Karisa Sosnoski\n\nIn this class you will consider the intricacies of social media by reading, watching, and listening to sources through an analytical lens. You will be invited to think about other people’s experiences with interactive technologies, their comprehensive influence on communities, and how they facilitate the creation of powerful ideas and standards. Through class discussion and interaction, you will analyze the interconnected nature of social categorizations such as race, class, social status, and gender, and how they influence the use and addictive nature of social media. We will analyze controversial topics as a starting point in our exploration, while also considering the positive and negative influence of hyper-technological demands for young people today. How does social media play a role in politics, power, body standards, and psychological well-being? Throughout the course, you will write four major writing projects including an annotated bibliography, synthesized analysis, research proposal, and research essay. We will begin considering larger discussion points as a class, and then you will develop focused questions and participate in the practices of academic research and writing. Each writing assignment will enable you to further develop your research interests within our class inquiry.\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Sports Fans: Psychology, Superstition, and Scapegoats\n\nCRN: 14402 MWF 10:00-10:50\n\nInstructor: Chris Glomski\n\nIn “Psychology, Superstition, and Scapegoats”, we will explore the psychology of sports fans and the folklore attached to sports teams in considerable depth as we pursue the aforementioned goals. Beginning with the etymological roots of the word “fan” (from “fanatic”), we will explore such phenomena as deindividuation, disinhibition, and parasocial relationships. We’ll also examine the history of superstition, curses, and scapegoats attached to our own Chicago Cubs (and other teams). These are some of the starting points for much stimulating critical thinking and writing we will undertake together this semester. While these concepts provide the context for our writing, our goal is to learn about academic research and writing, not just about psychology and superstition. Therefore, in addition to our inquiries into these subjects, we will also spend time learning about summarizing, analyzing, and synthesizing arguments, conducting academic research, writing a research proposal, and drafting a research paper. All of this will culminate in a final research project that answers a research question you have posed in relation to the course inquiry. Our readings and class discussions will guide you through each of these steps, and help you work toward generating a research topic that interests you enough to write a ten-page paper.\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Writing for Inquiry and Research\n\nCRN: 14394\n\nDays/Time: MWF 11:00-11:50\n\nInstructor: Jay Shearer\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Tabletop Role-Playing Games\n\nCRN: 14461\n\nDays/Time: MWF 11:00-11:50\n\nInstructor: Hyacinthe Ingram\n\nTable-Top Role-Playing Games (TTRPGs) such as Dungeons and Dragons have seen a boom in popularity in current cultural conscious, with actual play shows like Critical Role and podcasts like The Adventure Zone aiding in the genre’s revival. In this class, you will be looking at TTRPGs and the actual play shows that have aided in this revival to examine the ways that this form of media functions in creating space for representations of major cultural issues. As a class, we will explore these representations and cultural examinations by viewing these shows and reading various sources about TTRPGs, specifically looking at the ways in which these role-playing games affects these representations and major discussions.\n\nWhile looking at specific examples of these topics, as well as academic sources discussing TTRPGs, you will be tasked with researching and writing a long form research paper discussing one of the many topics that come up in these games and enter the conversation of this form of media and play that is currently happening. During the semester, the writing that you do, including the annotated bibliography, the research proposal, and the literature review, will serve as steppingstones that culminate in the research paper and the presentation of your research to the class. This is a student-driven exploration of TTRPGS as a genre, and what the genre has to offer to society.\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Writing for Inquiry and Research\n\nCRN: 14417\n\nDays/Time: MWF 10:00-10:50\n\nInstructor: Ryan Asmussen\n\nThis course is designed to prepare you for the research and writing you will do throughout your academic career. Class discussion will involve class lecture and activities to assist you in engaging in the practice of academic discourse, which involves developing rhetorical, grammatical, and research skills. You will be required to read challenging academic texts, learn to navigate library databases, evaluate sources, write formal research assignments, write reflectively, and work in discussion/peer-editing groups.\n\nMore specifically, we will be focusing on disciplines associated with the humanities. What are the humanities? As opposed to STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), the humanities “includes, but is not limited to, the study and interpretation of the following: language, both modern and classical; linguistics; literature; history; jurisprudence; philosophy; archaeology; comparative religion; ethics; the history, criticism and theory of the arts; those aspects of the social sciences which have humanistic content and employ humanistic methods; and the study and application of the humanities to the human environment with particular attention to reflecting our diverse heritage, traditions, and history and to the relevance of the humanities to the current conditions of national life” (National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act, 1965, as amended).\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Writing for Inquiry and Research Writing about Film and Society\n\nCRN: 14412\n\nDays/Time: MWF 10:00-10:50\n\nInstructor: Snezana Zabic\n\nWhether they focus on one character’s inner life or depict scenes of mass revolt (or anything in-between those two extremes), films tell stories deeply intertwined with both negative and positive developments in society. Within our general inquiry about film and society, you will research a scripted feature film, read articles in-depth, discuss your sources and respond to them in writing. You will produce essays that go through drafting, peer-review, and revision phases. Assignments include: 1) an annotated bibliography, 2) a film analysis, 3) a research proposal, and 4) a researched argument essay. You will choose the film and all the sources for your semester-long research project. You will conduct research using the UIC library databases, and write arguments based on the knowledge gained during this research. You will be able to discuss your ideas from inception to completion.\n\nENGL 161 Academic Writing II: Social Justice in Public Writing\n\nCRN: 14408\n\nDays/Time: MWF 10:00-10:50\n\nInstructor: Katharine Romero\n\nIn this section of English 161, called “Social Justice in Public Writing,” we will examine the argumentation of rhetors in the public writing sphere to understand argumentation as it relates to public context and the intended aud"
