        "text": "Today’s post focuses on Prof Jack Cohen and is a belated tribute to his work. He died in 2019 and was a good friend and a key member of the group of complexity scientists & thinkers we worked with while I was in IBM. That included Max Boisot, Brian Goodwin, Bill McKelvey, Peter Allen and others and it was a privilege to spend time with them. And I remain eternally grateful to Yasmin Merali for providing the introductions. It was also through Jack that I got to meet Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. For those of you who don’t know him, he is probably most famous for his three books (with Terry and Ian Stewart) on the Science of Discworld establishing that a world can be flat, resting on the backs of four elephants transported through space by a giant turtle. I’ll return to Pratchett in the final post of this series.\n\nJack was a reproductive biologist, published in Nature and elsewhere, and did significant work on human fertility. But in his spare time, he designed aliens and alien universes for science fiction writers, and from time to time people like me who tried to get organisations to change. I remember him taking me through the database he created for Anne McCaffrey’s Pern series. Pern was a candidate for this series and it’s a delightful series (well the ones written by Ann, less so Todd) but it didn’t make the final list. But Jack’s database which included thread and Northern and Southern Continent differences ran into the thousands; not just the species used in the book but all of the supporting ecosystem. He delighted in that level of detail and he was constantly enthusiastic. A discussion at his house in the Marches of South Wales ranged from tantric sex to epistemology and the ecosystems of all the surrounding lakes. I’m fairly eclectic in my conversation but I had nothing on Jack.\n\nBut the most animated conversations I had with him (and that is a high bar) followed my mentioning the Legacy of Heorot series, a modern retelling of the Grendel story (hence the banner picture). I knew he had been involved, but I didn’t realise just how much. The authors of the books were Niven & Pournelle (whose wider work on the Ring World and Motes are candidates for later in this series) who also brought in Steven Barnes to do the bulk of the heavy lifting. The idea originates from Jack talking at a scientific fiction collection about a frog with nasty habits. The said African frog lives under conditions of scarcity so the life cycle is fairly simple: the tadpoles eat plankton that the frogs cannot access, then the frogs eat the tadpoles, avoiding their own if possible on some theories.\n\nThat idea got picked up by Niven & Pournelle who pulled Jack into a meeting from which arose the eco-system of Avalon the fourth planet of Tau Ceti. There is an added complication here in which the suspended animation needed to get the planet has danged intellect and reasoning skills to varying degrees. In later books in the series there will be intergenerational conflict in consequence (children are not affected). The ecosystem has a dominant predator the grendels (the Beowulf link) who can release chemicals into their blood that allow them to move more than a hundred miles an hour, but only for so long. If they don’t return to water fast they literally die from the heat. Their spawn is seen by the settlers as a food source (named samlon who are male) by the colonists but are also (like the frogs) the principal foodstuff for the grendels. When samlon metamorphose into grendels they enter a feeding frenzy from which only the fittest ‘’ survive.\n\nThe colonists, after narrowly surviving an attack by the local grendel, go on a killing spree to eliminate what appears to be an existential threat. But that means the grendels are not eating the samlon so their numbers grow quickly and one day they all become grendels and the colony is almost wiped out.\n\nIt’s a good story well told, although it has a few stereotypes in it, but you can see Jack’s attention to detail and him laying down the thread for the series. In the second volume (which Jack mostly wrote) one of the grendels evolves to find an accommodation with the human population through the medium of a young rebel. As the series progresses with a novella The Secret of Black Ship Island and Starboard & Godsons more aspects of the planet, including a highly intelligent species are discovered. I’m not going to ruin the story for readers but the whole series is worth reading and the audiobooks are well narrated.\n\nNow Niven is an interesting writer who mainly co-authors. Pournelle was a military engineer to came to Niven to learn how to write. He also partnered with Steven Barnes, Micael Flynn, Brenda Cooper and Edward Lerner along with many others. Writing with people from different backgrounds I always find useful, your voice is tempered by people from a different background. Some of the best articles I have written were with a co-author: Mary Boone, Annabelle Mark, Cynthia Kurtz, Mark Lazaroff, Gary Oliver, Hugh Willmott, Jeff Able, Gary Klein, Lock Pin Chew & Peter Stanbridge. But equally, there are times when you need to write and there is a difference between being the primary and secondary author. Variety, as they say, is the spice of life.\n\nBut three main messages come out of those various conversations with Jack:\n\nThe law of unintended consequences is fundamental to complexity theory – it is the only thing you can predict. That means you have to design and create systems that can handle those by triggering smaller versions early and creating a broader approach to resilience as outlined in the EU Field Guide and now elaborated in Estuarine Mapping.\n\nLinked to the above, everything is connected to everything else in any complex system and in unexpected ways. Additionally, and especially in human systems new patterns of interaction can arise spontaneously, which can vary our understanding of the past to assume that they were always there to be discovered in the first place. This is the danger of hindsight or retrospective coherence,\n\nThe importance and consistency with the science. I think my use of natural science as an enabling constraint came from those conversations with Jack. That doesn’t restrict imagination, but you start to think what eco-system would support fire lizards and allow their genetic re-engineering to three burning dragons (Pern) or the many and various fabulous worlds that Pratchett creates. Imagination is enabled by science, it’s not something opposed to it,\n\nAnd finally in this memory was the work Jack and I did to create client universes that could be used in war games with existing managers. We used to send in anthropologists to study the culture and then Jack and I would sit down and (well mostly Jack) create an alien universe that matched the culture of the organisation. It was unfamiliar enough that people would do things and find solutions in the fictional world that they would reject as fantastical if it was their organisation – that method of anthro-simulation is a powerful approach to training, lessons learning and also developing resilience."
