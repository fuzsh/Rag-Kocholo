        "text": "This is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\nBeowulf is an Old English heroic epic poem of anonymous authorship. Its creation dates from between the 8th[1] and the 11th century, the only surviving manuscript dating from circa 1010.[2] At 3182 lines, it is notable for its length. It has risen to national epic status in England.[3]\n\nBeowulf has been adapted many times in verse, in prose, on the stage, and in film. In 2003, the Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies published Marijane Osborn's annotated list of over 300 translations and adaptations, withdrawn in 2019.[4] By 2020, the Beowulf's Afterlives Bibliographic Database listed some 688 translations and other versions of the poem, from Thorkelin's 1787 transcription of the text, and in languages including Afrikaans, Albanian, Arabic, Basque, Belarusian, Catalan, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, French, Ganda, German, Greek, Gujarati, Hungarian, Icelandic, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Macedonian, Persian, Portuguese, Polish, Punjabi, Russian, Serbo-Croat, Slovenian, Somali, Spanish, Swedish, Tamil, Turkish, Uighur, and Urdu.[5]\n\nThe poet John Dryden's categories of translation have influenced how scholars discuss variation between translations and adaptations.[6] In the Preface to Ovid's Epistles (1680) Dryden proposed three different types of translation:\n\nmetaphrase [...] or turning an author word for word, and line by line, from one language into another; paraphrase [...] or translation with latitude, where the author is kept in view by the translator so as never to be lost, but his words are not so strictly followed as his sense, and that, too, is admitted to be amplified but not altered; and imitation [...] where the translator – if he has not lost that name – assumes the liberty not only to vary from the words and sense, but to forsake them both as he sees occasion; and taking only some general hints from the original, to run division on the ground-work, as he pleases.[6]\n\nThe works listed below are novels and other works that take more \"latitude\" than pure \"translations\". Those are listed at List of translations of Beowulf.\n\n1949 : Silverlock a novel by John Myers Myers. In one scene the protagonist attends the celebration in Heorot after Beowulf kills Grendel.
