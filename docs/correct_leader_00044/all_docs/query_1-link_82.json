        "text": "By Staff\n\nYesterday’s protests were by and large peaceful, according to the Metropolitan Police. Initial reports had indicated someone had exploded a home-made bomb near the house of parliament, but the Chief Superintendent of the Metropolitan Police told The Icelandic National Broadcasting Service RÚV the reported explosions had probably been caused by people setting off fireworks. The crowds pelted the house of parliament with bananas, eggs and toilet paper rolls.\n\nAccording to the local newspaper Morgunblaðið a man was arrested earlier in the day for throwing skyr at the house of parliament. In Iceland, splashing someone with skyr is an old form of protest or insult.\n\nRead more: As many as 22,000 gathered to demand resignation of PM yesterday: Largest mass protest in Icelandic history\n\n\"We have not received any reports of injuries,” Ásgeir Ásgeirsson the Chief Superintendent of the Metropolitan Police told RÚV. “We wish to emphasize that people heeded our request not to direct their anger toward our officers. Two officers suffered some minor injuries: One was hit in the head with a banana, and a second officer was hit with an egg. But otherwise the protests were peaceful.”\n\nRÚV reports that the City had finished cleaning the house of parliament and Austurvöllur square at 21:45 last night."
