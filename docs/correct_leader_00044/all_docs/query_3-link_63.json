        "text": "By Staff\n\nHundreds of volunteers from the Icelandic Search and Rescue Units helped police over the weekend, participating in a search for clues which could help solve the murder case of Birna Brjánsdóttir. The search focused on the beaches west of Selvogsviti lighthouse where Birna's body was discovered on January 22. The search was initiated after Police received a tip from a member of the public.\n\nBody dumped near Vogsós estuary\n\nAccording to the sources of the local newspaper Fréttablaðið Police now believes Birna's body was dumped in the ocean near Vogsós estuary, 6 km (3.7 km) to the west of where her body was found. The search over the weekend focused on the beach on either side of the estuary. Ásgeir Þór Ásgeirsson, the officer in charge of the search told Fréttablaðið that Police hoped to find clothing or perhaps the phone of Birna.\n\nThe searchers found nothing during the weekend. \"We didn't find any of Birna's things or anything else which could be connected to the case. But we have now eliminated the areas, and we don't need to search them again,\" Ásgeir Þór told Fréttablaðið.\n\nÁsgeir Þór told Fréttablaðið that Police now believes that Birna's body was most likely dumped into the ocean at Vogsós estuary. \"Based on the weather conditions at the time we think it is more likely that she was put in the water to the west rather than to the east of where she was found.
