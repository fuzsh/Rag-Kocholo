        "text": "The documentary film Iceland Street, Jerusalem tells a story of three nations. Here is the story about the interaction between Iceland and Israel, two nations which considered themselves to have a common cause in international matters. But here is also the story of the Palestinians who lost their land.\n\nIceland and Israel were close in the first decades after the founding of the Republic of Iceland in 1944 and the state of Israel in 1948. The two nations felt they had a common destiny due to their small size and the importance of ancient history that shaped their views on the world.\n\nBut the friendship of these two nation was a strange combination.\n\nOn one hand we have a nation, which never had an army and has never been in a war against other countries, and on the other hand is a militarized nations that has been at war\n\nwith their neighbors from the beginning six decades ago.\n\nSynopsis\n\nIcelanders boast of being a peaceful people that does not harass other nations. The small population and the isolation in the North Atlantic have shaped its role in international affairs. But twice, Iceland has undertaken actions that can be viewed as a violation of the rights and sovereignty of other nations.\n\nThe first time was in 1947 when UN representatives of Iceland worked for and supported the establishment of Israel. The second time was when the Icelandic government supported the invasion of Iraq in 2003.\n\nThe Iraq war is still ongoing and the final outcome belongs to the future. The establishment of Israel was a recipe for endless conflict, as many people pointed out when the UN discussed in 1947, the establishing of a new state in a territory where other people already lived.\n\nIceland and Israel were close in the first decades after the founding of the Republic of Iceland in 1944 and Israel in 1948. The two nations felt they had a common destiny due to their smallness and the importance of ancient history that shaped their views on theÂ world.\n\nIcelanders had actively contributed to the creation of Israel at the United Nations and were proud of it. In return the Israelis treated the representatives of Iceland with respect. In 1966, Asgeir Asgeirsson President of Iceland visited Israel and became the first foreign head of state to address the Knesset, the Israeli parliament.\n\nThe highlight of the visit was in Jerusalem when Asgeir Asgeirsson cut on the ribbon and formally opened a new street that was named Iceland Street.\n\nNow relations between the two countries have gone sour and only 4% of Icelanders support the cause of Israel as the world denounces the assault on Gaza and the killings on board the Mavi Marmara.\n\nOur documentary takes you to the origins of this conflict, seen through the eyes of the director of the film, an Icelandic radical from the â68 Generationâ. A veteran from the opposition against he Vietnam War and other radical events in the seventies. As the crisis in the Middle East deepens his old sympathies for oppressed people awaken. Visiting former ministers and diplomats, historians and other experts in Iceland, Israel, England, Gaza, the West Bank and the US he tries to get a grasp of the situation and think about a solution."
