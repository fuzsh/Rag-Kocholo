        "text": "Recently, the President of Iceland, Guðni Th. Jóhannesson and first lady Mrs. Eliza Reid were present to formally open its doors for business while on their planned official visit to Poland.\n\nMeniga has had an office in Warsaw since September 2017, but the number of employees has since doubled prompting the need for the new location. With the high demand for Meniga products in Poland and Central Europe, this new office will be able to cope with a further increase in the number of employees and customers in the region.\n\nIf you are in the area, don’t hesitate to stop by our new office for some good coffee, discussions on fintech or challenge us to a game of ping or foosball. You are welcome anytime.\n\nBelow are some pictures of the new & improved office."
