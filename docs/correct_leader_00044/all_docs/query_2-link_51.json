        "text": "Hildur Elísa Jónsdóttir (she/her)\n\nb. 1993 in Iceland\n\nhildurelisa@gmail.com\n\n+354 690 4395\n\nBased in Reykjavík and Amsterdam\n\nHildur Elísa is an Icelandic artist, musician and composer interested in storytelling and creating engulfing experiences within spaces, often inspired by the mundanity of everyday life. In her works, she uses relational aesthetics and methods of institutional critique to interrupt and criticise normative narrative and show her subjects from a new angle.\n\nThrough a variety of media - performance, moving image, installation and music - Hildur Elísa employs normalised human behaviours and experiences in a critical way, displacing them into an artistic context. By placing these mundane, everyday happenings in unconventional and absurd scenes, she aims to challenge our understanding of our heavily constructed social reality, reflecting on our own ability to create new meaning and to forge our own reality - always asking ‘why’ and ‘what if’.\n\nHildur Elísa’s creative process is a balance between caprice and compulsive research. She is particularly interested in how we experience everything that happens around us, what of those experiences we have in common and where we differ and strives to create works that force the viewer to create their own meaning.\n\nHildur Elísa holds Master’s degree in Re:master Opera from Sandberg Instituut (NL), a Bachelor’s degree in Fine Art from the Iceland University of the Arts (IS) and a diploma in classical clarinet from the Reykjavík College of Music (IS). During her studies at the IUA she went on exchange in the Kunst und Vermittlung department at Hochschule Luzern (CH), where her work Konzert für Spielzeug und Schwimmbad was chosen by curator Michael Sutter to be exhibited at the HSLU exemplary exhibition, K+. After graduating, she interned with artist, musician and composer Lina Lapelytė in Vilnius (LT). Her works have been exhibited and performed in Arti et Amicitiae (NL), Ásmundarsalur (IS), Nýlistasafnið / The Living Art Museum (IS) and Outvert Art Space (IS), selected for festivals such as Gaudeamus Muziekweek (NL), Grachtenfestival (NL), Hamraborg Festival (IS), LungA (IS), Nordic Music Days (UK), November Music (NL), O Festival (NL), Opera Forward Festival (NL), Plan-B Art Festival (IS), Platform Nord (NO), Rewire (NL), Tokyo Biennale (JP) and Ung Nordisk Musik (FI), and have been performed by, among others, Juho Myllylä, K!art - Ensemble for New Music and Performance Art, Jónas Ásgeir Ásgeirsson and Antti Tolvi. Besides making her own work, she has served as a board member of the Association of Icelandic Artists and is currently vice chair of Ung Nordisk Musik Iceland. Together with artists Ástríður Jónsdóttir and Joe Keys, Hildur Elísa founded and runs Associate Gallery in Reykjavík, Iceland."
