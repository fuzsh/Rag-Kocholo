        "text": "Explore! A gap year won’t kill your career\n\nTake your time and explore as much as possible! Everything you study, even from a young age, may become extremely useful down the line - performers have increasingly varied skill sets which can be applied almost anywhere. There is no one path for any singer to follow, so if your instinct is to train in another field, or take a gap year or go travelling, then go! There will always be a time when these life experiences can inform your art.\n\nA tough COVID journey has had a silver lining\n\nWe’ve all found hidden reserves of strength which help us to be as innovative as possible. There are so many companies and colleagues now doing inclusive online programming; but the most inspirational movements have been towards advocacy and mental health projects, demonstrating how important community is.\n\nOver lockdown, I’ve been particularly inspired by the work of Canadian tenor Zach Finkelstein through his blog, The Middleclass Artist; as well as the new artist collective at i:Opera, who are both openly advocating for equality in the opera and classical music industry. A particular highlight for me was participating in Vopera’s first entirely digital production - a company dedicated to keeping singers working during the pandemic, while offering 24-hour mental health support. Finally, there are many organisations committed to getting artists back to work, such as the Bishopsgate Institute, Opera Holland Park (especially through their award-winning Inspire program), and the Tête-à-Tête Opera Festival who all carried off impressive COVID-secure performances and live-streams throughout the past year. Their efforts to galvanise the community have gone a long way during a particularly tough period.\n\nThere are so many companies and colleagues now doing inclusive online programming; but the most inspirational movements have been towards advocacy and mental health projects, demonstrating how important community is.\n\nThe Canadian music teaching system has some unique advantages\n\nMy experience growing up in Ontario is that bands are central to music education. I spent six years playing trumpet in elementary and high school, but most of all I developed ensemble skills (playing in a section, following a conductor, rehearsal time management, etc). We were also privileged enough to attend regular band camps, European concert tours and choir retreats. The instruments I specialised in (piano and voice) were studied privately, outside of school. The teaching quality is standardised: every full-time music teacher is trained as a conductor and learns how to play all band instruments before attending Teachers’ College, to be able to accommodate for all students.\n\nMy teaching and outreach work in the UK has shown the same ensemble programs are accessible here - there are many fantastic children’s choirs and orchestras, amateur opera companies and brass bands as well as opera companies doing wonderful outreach work - but these programs mainly exist as extracurriculars. Music studied at school to qualification level focuses on tangible assets of the individual musician, as it is easier to grade. It is normal for schools with a Music Department to have the capacity for visiting music teachers to give weekly private lessons, which contributes significantly to the income of freelance musicians; and creates an atmosphere where enterprising students can play in different types of ensembles/sing in different styles of choir while being supported by the school (borough and funding dependent). Music education is therefore left up to the individual schools and Music Departments, placing the focus more on individuality; while the Canadian system prioritises music as a performance practice, giving students more scope for growth in an ensemble.\n\nWe may never go back fully to big audiences and live performances\n\nMusicians everywhere have adapted to socially distanced live-streamed performances, so nearly every project is in a stage of conversion, perhaps even despite the easing of restrictions.\n\nAs for what's next for me, in February 2021, Divine Art Recordings released our album on its Métier Label, one of the foremost labels for contemporary music. My next project is an operatic art film of Amy Bryce’s opera ‘The Kinder Society’, written during her residency with the Stiftung Kunst und Musik für Dresden 2019. Long-term, I am working with Icelandic accordionist Jónas Ásgeir Ásgeirsson to create a contemporary recital for soprano and accordion, exploring the cultural links between Canada and Iceland."
