The incumbent is Guðni Thorlacius Jóhannesson, who declined to run for a third term after being elected in 2016 and re-elected in 2020.\n\nHalla Tómasdóttir is president-elect after winning the 2024 Icelandic presidential election, and is scheduled to take office on 1 August.[2]\n\nThe president is elected to a four-year term by popular vote, is not term-limited, and has limited powers.\n\nHistorically, while first-term elections have often been hard-fought, an incumbent president who decides to run again for office has usually run unopposed, or they have won re-election with an overwhelming majority of the vote when opposed. The 2012 election was a notable exception to this, where incumbent Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson won with only 52.78% of the vote.\n\nThe presidential residence is situated in Bessastaðir in Garðabær, near the capital city Reykjavík."
