        "meta_description": "Leifr Eiricsson, sometimes called the Leif Eiricsson Memorial, is statue of Norse explorer Leif Erikson created by American artist Alexander Stirling Calder. The artwork was commissioned by the United States government as a gift to the Icelandic people for the 1,000th anniversary of the Alþingi in 1930. The statue was unveiled on July 17, 1932, in Reykjavík, Iceland atop a hill overlooking the city, on which the Hallgrímskirkja was later built. The statue is gazing out to the west, towards the newly discovered Vinland in North America.\n\t\n\tIn June 1930, Iceland celebrated the 1,000th anniversary of the founding of the Alþingi, the country’s parliament. Preparatory to the celebration, the 71st United States Congress passed House Joint Resolution 2, on June 21, 1929 permitting the US government to participate in the celebration and required the government to “procure a suitable statue or other memorial of Leif Ericsson and present the same as a gift of the American people to the people of Iceland.”\n\tLater that year, the United States Commission of Fine Arts was enlisted to select a sculptor to fulfill Congress’ request. The commission first selected a group of artists who were subsequently invited to submit photographs of their proposed works for final consideration. Per the Department of State, the artist was required to be a citizen of the United States. In November 1929, the photographs were inspected and Alexander Stirling Calder was recommended by the commission to the Department of State as the artist to be hire.\n\t\n\tCalder’s completed statue was accepted by the commission in January 1932. During the course of its design, Calder had completed three preliminary sketches and studies. \n\t\n\tAfter being shipped to Iceland, the statue was placed on its pedestal on May 2, 1932. The location chosen for the artwork on the prominent hill at the top of Skólavörðuholt, where stood a historic tower called Skólavarðan, which had to be demolished to build the monument. The Hallgrímskirkja was later built on this site.\n\t\n\tThe statue was officially unveiled in a ceremony on Sunday, July 17, 1932. The ceremony was presided over by the Icelandic prime minister, Ásgeir Ásgeirsson, and also included speeches by Frederick W. B. Coleman, US envoy to Denmark (Iceland was still in a personal union with Denmark at the time), and Knud Ziemsen, the mayor of Reykjavík.\n\t\n\tThe stone pedestal has the form of the prow of a Viking ship and contains an inscription about the gifting of the statue by the United States. It was constructed of Texas red granite, is 15 feet (4.6 m) feet high, and was manufactured by the Presbrey-Leland company of Brattleboro, Vermont. It was erected in the autumn of 1931, several months before the statue was placed.\n\t\n\tIcelanders interpreted the gift as acknowledgement by the US that Leif was Icelandic, and appreciated the gesture, as many Norwegians, and especially Norwegian Americans and Norwegian Canadians, claimed Leif as their countryman. \n\t\n\tWhile the statue and pedestal were being created, some controversy arose regarding the spelling of Leif Erikson’s name. Specifically how the Old Norse “Leifr Eiríksson” should be modernized for inscription on the pedestal, as the different Nordic countries use different spellings of the name, and there are multiple different anglicized versions as well. After consulting with Sveinbjörn Johnson, an Icelandic-born law professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, “Leifr Eiricsson” was decided upon.
