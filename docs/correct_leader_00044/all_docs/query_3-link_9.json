Her biography has been translated into 69 different languages.\n\nJóhanna Sigurðardóttir (Icelandic pronunciation: [ˈjouːhana ˈsɪːɣʏrðarˌtouhtɪr̥]; born 4 October 1942) is an Icelandic politician, who served as prime minister of Iceland from 2009 to 2013. Elected as an MP from 1978 to 2013, she was appointed as Iceland's Minister of Social Affairs and Social Security, serving from 1987 to 1994, and from 2007 until 2009. In 1994, when she lost a bid to head the Social Democratic Party, she raised her fist and declared \"Minn tími mun koma!\" (\"My time will come!\"), a phrase that became a popular Icelandic expression. She became prime minister on 1 February 2009, Iceland's first female prime minister and the world's first openly LGBT head of government. Forbes listed her among the 100 most powerful women in the world. She has been a member of the Althing (Iceland's parliament) for Reykjavík constituencies since 1978, winning re-election on eight successive occasions. In September 2012, Jóhanna announced she would not seek re-election and retired from politics as Iceland's longest serving member of Parliament.\n\n4 . Katrín Jakobsdóttir (b. 1976 )\n\nWith an HPI of 60.09 , Katrín Jakobsdóttir is the 4th most famous Icelander Politician . Her biography has been translated into 61 different languages.\n\nKatrín Jakobsdóttir (Icelandic: [ˈkʰaːtʰrin ˈjaːkʰɔpsˌtouʰtɪr̥]; born 1 February 1976) is an Icelandic politician who served as the prime minister of Iceland from 2017 to 2024 and was a member of the Althing for the Reykjavík North constituency from 2007 to 2024. A graduate of the University of Iceland, she became deputy chairperson of the Left-Green Movement in 2003, and served as their chairperson since 2013 until her presidential bid in 2024. Katrín was Iceland's minister of education, science, and culture, and of Nordic cooperation from 2 February 2009 to 23 May 2013.

Kristján Eldjárn ( 1916 - 1982 )\n\nWith an HPI of 59.34 , Kristján Eldjárn is the 7th most famous Icelander Politician . His biography has been translated into 40 different languages.\n\nKristján Eldjárn (Icelandic: [ˈkʰrɪstjaun ˈɛltjaurtn̥]; 6 December 1916 – 14 September 1982) was the third president of Iceland, from 1968 to 1980. Kristján was born in Tjörn, Svarfaðardal, Iceland. His parents were Þórarinn Kr. Eldjárn, a teacher in Tjörn, and Sigrún Sigurhjartardóttir. He graduated in archaeology from the University of Copenhagen and taught at the University of Iceland. In 1957 he was awarded a doctorate for his research into pagan burials in Iceland. He was a teacher at the Akureyri Grammar School and the College of Navigation in Reykjavík, becoming a curator at the National Museum of Iceland in 1945 and its Director in 1947, a position he held until the 1968 presidential election. Between 1966 and 1968, he hosted a series of educational TV programs on the (then new) Icelandic National Television (RÚV); on the program,he showed the audience some of the National Museum's artefacts and explained their historical context. These programs became quite popular, making him a well known and respected popular figure. This no doubt gave him the incentive needed to run in the 1968 presidential election as a politically non-affiliated candidate. Starting as the underdog in the 1968 presidential election, running against Ambassador Gunnar Thoroddsen who initially had a 70% lead in the opinion polls, Kristján won 65.6% of the vote on a 92.2% voter turnout. He was re-elected unopposed in 1972 and 1976. In 1980 he decided not to run for another term, wanting to devote his remaining years entirely to continuing his lifelong academic work. President Kristján Eldjárn died following heart surgery in Cleveland, Ohio on 13 September 1982. His son Þórarinn Eldjárn is one of Iceland's most popular authors, specializing in short stories, but also writing poetry and an occasional novel. His daughter Sigrún Eldjárn is also an author and illustrator of several children's books. Þórarinn's son, Ari Eldjárn, is Iceland's most prominent stand-up comedian. \"Islands villkor: få människor hårt arbete fiske och elenergi\". Forum (in Swedish).

His biography has been translated into 56 different languages.\n\nGuðni Thorlacius Jóhannesson (Icelandic pronunciation: [ˈkvʏðnɪ ˈtʰɔrlaˌsiʏs ˈjouːhanɛsɔn]; born 26 June 1968) is an Icelandic historian and politician who has served as the sixth president of Iceland since 2016.

Bjarni Benediktsson ( 1908 - 1970 )\n\nWith an HPI of 57.35 , Bjarni Benediktsson is the 9th most famous Icelander Politician . His biography has been translated into 32 different languages.\n\nBjarni Benediktsson (30 April 1908 – 10 July 1970) was an Icelandic politician of the Independence Party who served as prime minister of Iceland from 1963 to 1970. His father, Benedikt Sveinsson (1877–1954), was a leader in the independence movement in Iceland and a member of the Althingi from 1908 to 1931. Bjarni studied constitutional law and became a professor at the University of Iceland at age 24. He was elected to the city council in Reykjavík in 1934 as a member of the Independence Party and from 1940 to 1947 was mayor of the city. In 1947 he became Foreign Minister and served in various posts in cabinets until 1956. Bjarni was mainly responsible for Iceland joining NATO in 1949, against significant opposition, and for giving the United States Air Force a lease on Keflavík Airport near Reykjavík, which was of major strategic importance during the Cold War. Bjarni was caricatured by the Nobel prize winning writer Halldór Laxness in his 1948 play Atómstöðin (The Atom Station). In 1956, when the left-wing parties formed a coalition government, Bjarni, out of office, became editor of Morgunblaðið, a leading conservative newspaper. In 1959, when the Independence Party formed a coalition government with the Social Democrats, Bjarni became Minister of Justice. He served as speaker of the Althing in 1959. Two years later he was elected chairman of the Independence Party and in 1963 he took over from Ólafur Thors as Prime Minister. He served in this position until his death, which was caused by a fire at a government summer house at Þingvellir; his wife and grandson also perished in the blaze. Bjarni was the father of Björn Bjarnason and Valgerður Bjarnadóttir, as well as the father-in-law of Vilmundur Gylfason. Bjarni was the great-uncle of his namesake Bjarni Benediktsson, who became Prime Minister in January 2017. \"Bjarni Benediktsson\".
