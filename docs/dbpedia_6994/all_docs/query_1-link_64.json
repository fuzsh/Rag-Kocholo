Tar Heels develop a voice for critical thought and the courage to guide change.\n\nCarolina’s nationally recognized teaching, groundbreaking research and dedication to public service continue a legacy that began when the University was chartered in 1789 and opened to students four years later.\n\nIn pictures\n\nTar Heels move in\n\nMove-in is in full swing at Carolina. Thousands of new and returning students — with the help of their loved ones — are unpacking cars, doing some heavy lifting, and setting up their dorm rooms. Take a look at how Tar Heels are settling into their homes for the new school year.\n\n(Photos by Johnny Andrews and Jon Gardiner, University Communications)"
