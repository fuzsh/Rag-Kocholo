        "text": "Welcome to ENMU-Roswell\n\nSuccess Starts Here!\n\nEstablished in 1958, the campus of Eastern New Mexico University-Roswell (ENMU-Roswell) provides high quality, affordable education and life-long learning opportunities.\n\nThe faculty-student ratio is kept low, with small classes, allowing instructors to provide support and personal attention to students.\n\nENMU-Roswell is accredited by The Higher Learning Commission (HLC)\n\nAvailable to students, faculty, and staff\n\nEastern New Mexico University Roswell has partnered with TimelyCare, higher education’s most trusted virtual health and well-being provider, to offer students free and equitable access to mental health support, medical care and basic needs assistance.\n\nThe need for 24/7 access to high-quality care has never been more important. According to the American Council on Education, student mental health is the top concern of college and university presidents. It’s also the number one reason students leave college. A recent report by Gallup and the Lumina Foundation found that 69% of students in bachelor’s degree programs who considered dropping out cited emotional stress as their reason.\n\nThrough TimelyCare on their phone or other device, Eastern New Mexico University Roswell students can now select from a wide-ranging menu of virtual care options from licensed physicians and counselors in all 50 states – at no cost and without the barrier of traditional insurance.\n\nAdditionally, faculty and staff have access to support that empowers them to guide students to TimelyCare resources to help students achieve a sense of well-being, live healthier lifestyles and improve their mental health.\n\nWhy Vote on Bond 3?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nUpcoming Events\n\nNo Results Found\n\nThe page you requested could not be found.
