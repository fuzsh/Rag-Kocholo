        "text": "About Marketing and Communications\n\nAs the central communications office for Clayton State University, the Office of Marketing and Communications advances the Clayton State brand through promotion and management of the Universityâ€™s reputation, image, and identity. We are understandably careful about the way the Clayton State brand is represented.\n\nThe Office of Marketing and Communications has a vested interest in the success of our University and the attainment of our shared goals. We join our partners in celebration of each individual success whether it be enrollment, fundraising, athletics or student outcomes. Our goal is to serve with the highest level of excellence, therefore we seek to establish strategic partnerships in which each party brings its respective expertise to help achieve shared goals.\n\nHow We Help You\n\nOur methodology is very simple: We take a research-driven, comprehensive approach that uses a mix of communication strategies to engage, inform, and influence target audiences. In the process, we ask these questions:\n\nWhat are your goals?\n\nWho is your audience?\n\nWhat do you want them to know or what action do you want them to take?\n\nTo better serve you, we will meet with you to help define your needs and goals, to determine the scope of the project, to provide communication recommendations that are based on research and experience, develop a project timeline, and oversee the execution within our division."
