        "text": "Private university in Manila, Philippines\n\nThe University of the East (Filipino: Pamantasan ng Silangan), also known as UE, is a private university located in Manila, Philippines. Founded in 1946, business tycoon Lucio Tan acquired the university in 1990. UE was once labeled as the \"largest university in Asia\" when its enrollment in the past reached over 65,000 students.[1][2]\n\nThe Commission on Higher Education (CHED) granted UE autonomous status and recognized 2 of its programs as Center of Excellence and 1 program as Center of Development.[3][4] UE offers degree programs from basic education to graduate studies. UE has two other campuses, one in Caloocan, and its medical school, the UE Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Medical Center located in Aurora Blvd., Dona Imelda, Quezon City.\n\nThe history of the University of the East starts in September 1946, in a rented room on Dasmariñas Street, Manila, where 110 students enrolled in Certified Public Accountant (CPA) review classes. The group of business teachers led by Dr. Francisco T. Dalupan, Sr. that started the sessions made it their objective to help the country, which was still reeling from the war. Of the 110 students, four made it to top spots in the 1947 CPA board Examinations.[1]\n\nOn September 11, 1946, five educators - namely Dr. Francisco T. Dalupan Sr., Dr. Hermengildo B. Reyes, José L. Torres, Enid Mapa and Santiago de la Cruz—established the Philippine College of Commerce and Business Administration (PCCBA) along R. Papa St. in Sampaloc, Manila. The PCCBA admitted 350 students in the summer of 1947. The following year, more students enrolled and more academic units were organized, and the PCCBA moved to what is now UE's main campus on 2219 Claro M. Recto Avenue.\n\nPCCBA alumni performed successfully in the government's accountancy examinations. Because of this success, the government granted the PCCBA permission to establish other colleges, leading to the establishment of the Colleges of Liberal Arts, Business Administration, Dentistry, and the Graduate School of Business Administration.[1]\n\nThe PCCBA was granted university status on July 4, 1951, and was renamed the University of the East. Dalupan became UE's first president and chairman of its board of trustees. The first members of the Board were Dr. Hermenegildo Balbino Reyes, a businessman, scholar, and former Vice President of the University of the Philippines; Santiago F. de la Cruz, a CPA and business executive who later succeeded Dalupan as UE president; José L. Torres, a soldier, businessman, and accountant; and Jaime Hernández, former Secretary of Finance.\n\nThe succeeding years saw the opening of the colleges of Law, Medicine, and Engineering, as well as the Graduate School of Education. The Graduate School later merged with the Graduate School of Business Administration.\n\nIn June 1954, UE opened a new campus, then known as UE Tech, on a 4.86-hectare lot along Samson Road in Caloocan. UE Caloocan, which is now academically autonomous, is headed by a chancellor. The new Tan Yan Kee Academic Building houses the colleges of Arts and Sciences, Business Administration, and Fine Arts, whereas the College of Engineering has its own building. The UE Caloocan grounds have been used for ROTC and CAT instruction since 1986.\n\nIn 1955, the UE purchased a one-hectare lot along Aurora Boulevard in Quezon City, where it established the College of Medicine. On May 17, 1957, the college was converted into a Foundation and named the UE Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Medical Center (UERMMMC).\n\nIn 1962, the university acquired a 5,850-square-meter (63,000 sq ft) lot across UERMMMC. This became the Research Center for Sciences, Humanities and Culture, which is home to two buildings. One housed the School of Music and Arts and the Ballet School while the other housed the College of Dentistry and research laboratories. The School of Music and Arts, now the College of Fine Arts, moved to the Caloocan campus in 1981. On the mid-1960s Dalupan commissioned the National Artist Guillermo Tolentino to create the symbol of every UEian, the Lualhati from the figure of CBA student Ophelia Salas. The College of Dentistry moved to the Recto (Manila) campus in school year 1988–1989.\n\nIn 1967, former President Diosdado Macapagal decided to teach part-time in the College of Business Administration and branded UE as the \"People's University\".[1]\n\nTogether with the expansion came rapid growth in enrollment. From the original 110 students in 1946, the student population steadily grew each year until 1960, when UE became the first Philippine university have an enrollment of over 60,000. The highest enrollment record was achieved during the first semester of school year 1975–1976, with 67,443 students registered. Today, the body of UE alumni is over a million.\n\nThe economic crisis and recession that hit the Philippines in the 1980s did not spare UE. The devaluation of the peso, rising inflation, the high cost of wages, coupled with faculty, personnel and student strikes affected UE. Enrollment declined. This period intensified into a crisis that almost led to the school's being sold to a foreign religious group. Financial trouble and academic decline continued to burden UE throughout the 1980s. For a brief period in 1984, a controlling interest in the university was held by an entity of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's Transcendental Meditation movement. Students boycotted classes and held protests against the takeover, and in short time control was returned to stakeholders.[5][6]\n\nDr. Isidro D. Cariño, who became UE president in 1984, began applying measures that included personnel reduction, cost-cutting measures, and renting out school premises and facilities on short- and long-term leases. UE began offering a ladderized curriculum, a special course for executives, programs from the Institute for Computer Studies and Systems, and scholarships for accounting and engineering students. The lease of facilities enabled UE to hold back tuition fee increases in 1986–1987 and 1987–1988.\n\nWhen Cariño was appointed Secretary of Education in 1990, Panfilo O. Domingo, former president of Philippine National Bank, took over as chairman of the board of trustees and became chief executive officer and acting president of the university.\n\nDomingo immediately worked to cure the financial ills of the university by retiring its short-term debts and instituting fiscal and operational reforms. Within five years, the university's loans were substantially reduced and the long-accumulated operating deficit was eliminated from the books. At the same time, Domingo began a massive rehabilitation of UE's infrastructure and academics.\n\nLucio C. Tan heavily invested in education, buying the university in 1990. In 1992, former Treasurer of the Philippines Rosalina S. Cajucom became UE President. After she retired in mid-1995, Domingo reassumed the presidency until the appointment of Dr. Josefina R. Cortes to the position in 1997. She was succeeded by Mr. Baltazar N. Endriga following her 2003 retirement.\n\nthe university was labeled as \"One of the Most Wired Universities in the Country\"[7] by Computerworld and Enterprise Magazine. Featured in the 2006 Computerworld Premier 100 of Computer World Magazine, the university ranked 15 among the top 100 corporations and companies in the use of Information Technology and is the only educational institution on the list.\n\nThe university migrated from ATM to Gigabit Ethernet at its Manila campus with an Ethernet networking solution from Nortel Networks.[8] The upgrade will significantly improve speed and performance of student and faculty access to online learning resources and academic records. The upgrade will also support the university's plan for a unified communications network ultimately linking the Manila facility with campuses in Caloocan and Quezon City.\n\nOn October 6, 2009, the Commission on Higher Education granted the Autonomous Status to the UE-Manila campus.[3]\n\nOn September 25, 2012, the university inaugurated the Dr. Lucio C. Tan Building, an eight-story building and the new home of UE Caloocan's Elementary and High School Department (EHSD). The edifice, named after UE's chairman of the board and chief executive officer, features modern classrooms and laboratories, a 500-seater multipurpose hall, and a library with multi-media facilities.\n\nBy the second semester of SY 2014–2015, College of Dentistry moved to the new seven-storey building extension campus at the part formerly of Ever Gotesco Manila Plaza along Recto Avenue near the Manila campus, while the Old Dentistry Building is now used mostly by Senior High School students.\n\nThe UE Manila Campus (main campus) consists of twelve buildings, located on the heart of University Belt area, Sampaloc, Manila. The campus faces Claro M. Recto Avenue, near Mendiola Street and Legarda station. All of the campuses are fully integrated with the Smart ID System. One of the beautification projects of the university is the construction of the Tan Yan Kee Garden.\n\nIn 2013, An Annex was up diagonally across UE's Manila Campus along Recto Avenue, Dr. Lucio C. Tan Building, home of UE College of Dentistry.\n\nThe building has six floors and a mezzanine and features various facilities and equipment—including a variety of dental laboratory facilities, four specialty clinics, 253 dental chairs, a variety of simulator equipment and specialized machines, two auditoriums, four lecture rooms, a multipurpose hall and a parking area. The building was inaugurated on December 8, 2014.\n\nOn April 2, 2016, a fire broke out on the second floor of the UE College of Arts and Science Building. The Engineering Building and the University Chapel also caught fire, leaving the three buildings in ruins. The groundbreaking ceremony on May 22, 2017, for new Lualhati Building to be erected at the footprint of these buildings.\n\nThe Lualhati Building stands 10 floors tall, and houses four Colleges: the UE College of Arts and Sciences - Manila, the UE College of Computer Studies and Systems, the UE College of Education, and the UE College of Engineering - Manila, as well as the new University Chapel.\n\nIn line with the construction of this new building, the university is modernizing its Manila Campus with the aid of a new masterplan. The campus masterplan designed for the university aims to rationalize, modernize, and create a safer, more secure, and sustainable campus for the UE community. The redesign of the masterplan involves the introduction of outdoor relaxation and recreation areas, and better circulation networks.\n\nA ceremonial turnover of the Lualhati Building was held on September 30, 2021, as part of UE's 75th Foundation Anniversary.\n\nUniversity of the East Caloocan is located in Caloocan, along Samson Road. It is an autonomous unit headed by a Chancellor with College of Business Administration, College of Arts and Sciences, College of Engineering, College of Fine Arts, Architecture and Design, and Elementary and High School Department. UE Caloocan is called Caloocan Campus to distinguish it from the Manila Campus on Recto Avenue. All of the Colleges are also present at the Manila Campus except the College of Fine Arts.\n\nOn September 12, 2012, the university inaugurated the Dr. Lucio C. Tan Building - Caloocan Campus. It is a ten-story building that houses the Basic Education Department (Formerly known as Elementary and High School Department or EHSD). The edifice was named after UE's chairman of the board and chief executive officer.\n\nUniversity of the East Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Medical Center (UERMMMC) is located in Quezon City, along Aurora Boulevard. UERMMMC is a non-stock, non-profit foundation and a memorial to President Ramon Magsaysay since 1957.
