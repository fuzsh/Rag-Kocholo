UE was founded in 1946 as the Philippine College of Commerce and Business Administration (PCCBA), which became the University of the East in 1951. The University of the East has two extension campuses in addition to its main campus in Manila, and now enrolls over 20,000 students. UE’s mission is to seek \"the development of a just, progressive and humane society\" by educating \"morally upright and competent leaders in various professions, imbued with a strong sense of service to their fellowmen and their country.\" University of the East’s website>>\n\nOffice of Extension and Community Outreach\n\nThe Office of Extension and Community Outreach seeks to deliver technical, entrepreneurial, computer literacy, industrial arts, supplementary feeding program, dental health, literacy and communication services to marginalized local communities in collaboration with NGOs, Government Agencies, and Civil Society.

Its main objectives centered on empowerment, self-reliance, social equity, and stability. Twenty-two residents from UE’s adopted communities were awarded with seed money to help them start up their own small businesses since their chance of employment is very slim. In order to enhance their skills in handling business and finances, UE community worker-volunteers spearheaded a series of intensive seminars, trainings and workshops. Today, their respective small businesses are continuously operating and served as their main source of daily living.\n\nCollege-based Community Outreach Programs"
