        "text": "by Reuel Hermoso / 02 October 2020\n\nTwo of the best all-around swingmen in the game - Heat star Jimmy Butler and Laker legend LeBron James - square off for all the marbles. (Photo from slamonline.com)\n\nThe smoke has cleared from both the Eastern and Western Conferences, and expectedly, the Los Angeles Lakers cinched their conference finals and the first NBA finals berth. But in the Eastern Conference, an unlikely winner emerged – the Miami Heat, who just defeated the fancied Boston Celtics.\n\nEric Spoelstra’s troops are now marching on to the NBA finals, that glorious Nirvana that they have not been to since 2014 when they had current Lakers superstar LeBron James. They lost that series to the San Antonio Spurs, winning just a game (to the Spurs’ four) in the seven-game series, and James returned to his homestate and its team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, the following year, and even conspired with celebrated backcourt wizard Kyrie Irving to give Cleveland its first NBA championship in 2016. The Heat last won the NBA crown in 2013. That makes for a really hungry team longing to feast on a championship glory.\n\nBut if a seven-year fast looks bad, the Lakers are in a worse famine, last appearing – and winning – the NBA finals in 2010, when the late great Kobe Bryant was still their unquestioned leader. Acquiring James’s services after he left the Cavs was a watershed event for the Lakers in their quest to finally end that 10-year title drought. And signing up the highly-prized former New Orleans Pelicans power forward-center Anthony Davis was the last key to unlock the display chest holding the Larry O’Brien trophy for the Lakers to finally take home.\n\nGetting other pieces like former Houston Rockets big man Dwight Howard and young gunners Kentavius Caldwell-Pope and Alex Caruso to pace the backcourt, as well as versatile wingmen like the young Kyle Kuzma and the more experienced Markieff Morris to beef up the frontline, helped to complete this powerful Laker roster. Coach Frank Vogel, acquired just last year, has done some pretty admirable work in that short period, piloting the Lakers to a 52-19 win-loss card in just his first season – the best record in the Western Conference and the third-best in the entire league. This is a team that was put together precisely to restore the Lakers’ lost glory, and with this ticket to the Big Dance, they’re just four wins away from accomplishing that.\n\nThe Heat, however, are looking to spoil the Lakers’ date with destiny, believing that they have their own destiny to meet – and have proven they will not be denied that other finals slot. The face of the Heat today, Jimmy Butler, is himself a story that mirrors the struggles of his team to get back its own former glory. Thrown out of the house by his mother at the age of 13, Butler spent the following year hopping from house to house, living with friends who would take him in for a day, a week, or more if he was lucky. Finally, a friend’s family decided to adopt him.\n\nThey sent him to school, and later saw him off to college to fulfill his dreams of playing varsity basketball. Initially, he played for Tyler College in his home state of Texas, and was later offered an academic scholarship at Marquette, a perennial March Madness contender in the US NCAA, for which former Heat superstar Dwyane Wade also played. In his junior year, Butler helped the Golden Eagles to an 11-7 win-loss card that season in the NCAA’s Big East Conference and a fifth consecutive March Madness appearance.\n\nIn the NBA, Butler became a journeyman of sorts, suiting up for the Chicago Bulls, which drafted him in 2011. Although he played well in his long stint with the Bulls – at one point breaking Michael Jordan’s team record for most points in a half in a game they won against the Toronto Raptors on January 3, 2016 –Butler was plagued by injuries. In 2017, he was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves, and the following year he was again traded to the Philadelphia 76ers. Finally, in a sign-and-trade deal, the guy famously known as “Jimmy Buckets” “moved (his) talent to South Beach,” in the famous words of James himself when he first left the Cavs in 2010 to join the Heat.\n\nWith all this moving and seeming lack of rootedness even from his early adolescence, any lesser man would probably have called it quits. Certainly not Butler though. He couldn’t care less how people felt about him, whether they felt pity on him or hated his guts. As sportswriter Garth Johnson put it in fansided.com: “A lot of guys in the league view basketball as a way to a lifestyle. Jimmy Butler viewed basketball as a way to a life. On his own since 13 in a small Texas town outside Houston, Butler had more to worry about than rubbing some people the wrong way.” Read more about it in https://fansided.com/2020/02/29/jimmy-butler-heat-sledgehammer-greatness/.\n\nTo cut to the chase, this Heat squad today is now Butler’s team – his and his alone. Sure, he had his chances to carve out a leadership position with the Bulls, but that wasn’t meant to be. He wasn’t exactly welcomed in Minnesota, and some like Johnson even think Butler broke the Timberwolves apart during his stint there. But even then, as Johnson observes, “in his one season there they made their first playoff appearance in 14 years.” The Timberwolves even had their first winning season in 13 years and had a win-loss card of 38-24 with Butler while going 9-11 without him. They even fell from third in the West when he hurt his knee, to eighth going into the playoffs.\n\n“You don’t have to be a stat geek to see how they are (now) faring without him,” Johnson argues.\n\nMore importantly, though, it’s what the Heat braintrust decided to do to get those other pieces they needed to put together a team that’s primed to surprise the NBA by achieving what it has in so short a time. Butler is their crowning recruitment achievement in the offseason, but consider as well coach Spo’s starting five to give you an idea of this team’s ability to continue perplexing the league and its fans.\n\nAs civil engineer and casual basketball pundit Ramby Nolido observed, they first cornered Kentucky Wildcat sniper Tyler Herro – who now comes off the bench as a deadly sixth man – ahead of their Eastern Conference finals opponents, the Celtics, who were hoping the Heat would overlook him before making Herro the 13th overall draft pick, depriving the Celtics of a chance to get him in the next draft slot at 14th. Then they acquired former Golden State Warriors small forward Andre Iguodala and two former Celtics – Jae Crowder and Kelly Olynyk – with Crowder playing with an ax to grind against his former team in the just-concluded Eastern Conference finals. Heat management then brought up deadshot Duncan Robinson from their G-League team to light things up from rainbow country.\n\n“That’s four steps in the season that they got things right,” says Nolido. And from their previous roster, they kept Bam Adebayo and Goran Dragic, a deadly frontline-backcourt tandem on both ends of the floor.\n\nThe question thus inevitably surfaces: Who will win the NBA title – the first held in a “bubble” in its long history? Who will get to take the Larry O’Brien trophy out of the bubble?\n\nClearly, the advantage is in LA’s favor. The combined firepower alone of James and Davis in the 2019-20 season is a whopping 51.5 points per game on the average. The supporting cast is just as potent, with inside-outside threats Kuzma and Caruso combining with Davis, who has decent three-point shooting numbers and can take the ball inside with his vaunted size and athleticism. Caldwell-Pope is also another recognized perimeter threat, but is a solid slasher as well. Morris, JaVale McGee, and even Howard are also known to be able to hit it from the perimeter, although that isn’t their strong suit.\n\nWhat is their strong suit – and that of the rest of the Lakers – is their astounding inside scoring and, on the defensive end, their protection of the shaded lane. Indeed, LA has dominated the paint throughout much of the season, and obviously the Lakers will continue to use their size and length to their fullest advantage. Because despite the timely three-point bombs that guys like Kuzma, Caruso, Caldwell-Pope, and even the superstars James and Davis have unleashed with deadly accuracy during the playoffs, the Lakers are not exactly an outside scoring juggernaut, averaging just 34.9 percent from trifecta range (averaging home and road three-point shooting percentages prior to the lockdown, according to https://www.nba.com/lakers/stats/team). In the bubble, that percentage has dropped even lower to 30.6 percent in July and 30.2 percent in August.\n\nSource: https://www.nba.com/article/2020/09/28/2020-playoffs-numbers-preview-lakers-heat-finals\n\nIn contrast, the Lakers own the low post. They are monsters in the restricted area, scoring a gargantuan 88 points underneath the basket compared to the Heat’s 74. Here’s the thing though – elsewhere in the paint, Miami outscores LA but not by much. Total points in the shaded area will expectedly go the way of the Lakers. This accounts for many of their wins, since inside points are higher-percentage shots compared to perimeter attempts.\n\nStill, the numbers for outside points seem to be going the way of the Lakers. Total mid-rangers and three-balls have them up 26 points over the Heat. But where the boys from South Beach have the upper hand scoring-wise is from the free-throw line. There, they outscore the Hollywood boys by a whopping 18 markers. They also run the break better, beating LA in transition by nine points – both crucial advantages in the clutch. Where the Lakers are better off with the game on the line is in second-chance points, where they lord it over the Heat by 20 points.\n\nIndeed, offense and offensive efficiency will spell the difference for both teams, despite their respective claims to being defensive juggernauts. As John Schuhmann of nba.com wrote: “Both teams have had success on both ends of the floor, but offense was the story in the conference finals. The Lakers and Denver Nuggets combined to score 115.3 points per 100 possessions, while the Heat and Boston Celtics combined to score 114.1. Those were the third- and fourth-most efficient series of the 14 we’ve seen thus far.”\n\nWe should thus expect that offense will remain the most compelling reason for their respective coaching staffs to continue as that is what has brought them both this far.\n\nOr is it? Perhaps both teams will be wise to revisit their defensive narrative and give it more of the importance it truly deserves. As University of Alabama legendary football coach Bear Bryant (no relation to Kobe) famously said (and which Ateneo sniper Jai Reyes repeated after his Blue Eagles successfully wrested the UAAP men’s basketball title from the La Salle Green Archers in 2008): “Offense wins games, but defense wins championships!”\n\nThe team with the better defensive strategy will take the series – and the championship. As Schuhmann of nba.com correctly observes: “To win their 17th championship, the Lakers will have to keep up with the Heat’s ball and player movement. To win their fourth, the Heat will have to protect the rim. In both cases, it’s much easier said than done.” (As an aside, as a Celtics fan, I just want to say that this is one reason why I’m rooting for the Heat; it’s not just because of our natural aversion to the Purple-and-Gold but also because Boston diehards want to keep that record of most number of NBA titles ever. Touché!)\n\nEach game, each quarter, maybe even each possession, will boil down to how the individual and roster matchups will fare between these two protagonists. Key here will be the substitution patterns of Messrs. Vogel and Spoelstra, and how they can effectively use the chess pieces they each have.\n\nCoach Vogel has largely stuck with his starting five of James as point forward, Davis at the forward spot, Caldwell-Pope as swingman, JaVale McGee at center, and Danny Green as shooting guard, while coach Spo has from time to time experimented in his backcourt lineup, but with schoolboy charm Duncan Robinson and Dragic in the perimeter, Adebayo at center, and Butler and Dragic in the wings as the mainstays. He has a potent bench, with boy wonder Herro as his sixth man and Crowder at the forward spots (the latter’s versatility allows him to play both the small and power positions), with both players having reliable deep-three shots that can spread the Laker defense to its limits. It is a fast lineup, well, at least faster than that of the Lakers, and should leverage on that speed to run the floor before the Lakers’ transition defense can react.\n\nWhat’s also interesting and has been fun to watch thus far is the Butler-Adebayo tandem. Schuhmann at nba.com notes that, when the two are on the floor together, the Heat outscore their opponents by 10.6 points more per 100 possessions. But they’ve been outscored by their opponents by 3.0 points per 100 possessions in 103 minutes with just Adebayo without Butler on the floor, and by 14.4 points per 100 possessions in 99 minutes of play with just Butler without Adebayo. It would seem that, if coach Spo had to keep either one on the bench longer, it would have to be Butler.\n\nIndeed, as Schuhmann demonstrates, “the Heat have scored 16.9 more points per 100 possessions with Bam Adebayo on the floor (116.1) than they have with him off the floor (99.2). That’s the fourth-biggest on-off offense rating differential among 73 players who’ve played at least 200 total minutes in the postseason.”\n\nAdebayo clearly has proven himself to have a greater impact on the game for the Heat, and the last game against Boston in the Eastern Conference finals showed the value he brings to the table. Though a center, Adebayo moves like a power forward with the way he screens and passes (especially his interior passing), and even his turnaround jumper in the key is cash. And that’s how he could wreak havoc on the Lakers’ post defenders like Howard and McGee – maybe even Davis as a rim defender.\n\nOn the offensive end, those guys may also have fits trying to score against him in the post, Adebayo being the most athletic big on the Heat roster, with more than ample length and heft. Of course, we can’t forget Iguodala, who brings with him championship experience from Golden State, having been with the Warriors in all their three NBA championships thus far in the 21st century (2015, 2017 and 2018). It will be remembered that in the 2015 title series, Iguodala fashioned a defensive masterpiece on James, limiting the latter to 38.1 percent field-goal shooting compared to 44 percent when Iguodala was on the bench. Both Iguodala and James are in their mid-30s, and have had their fair share of NBA glory. For sure, James will look at settling an old score, while Iguodala will look at putting the cuffs on The King once again via his tried-and-tested lockdown D that made James bleed for every point, giving the Warriors a superior 3-1 finals win-loss card in all their NBA finals showdowns that only saw a failure in 2016.\n\nSo who will be the Bubble Champions of the NBA? The numbers coming out of the Las Vegas bookies give the clear advantage to the Lakers, if only for the James-Davis pairing. But as many hoops pundits have seen through decades of watching this game, stranger things have happened in basketball. Just last August, the Milwaukee Bucks were the indubitable favorite to win the NBA crown among the bookies and oddsmakers. Everyone and his mother now know Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, Eric Bledsoe, the Lopez twins and company are now vacationing wherever.\n\nActually, folks were looking at a Bucks-Lakers finals. And I thought we’d be having a revival of the famous Celtics-Lakers rivalry of the ages.\n\nThe bottomline: sit back, relax. Or stand up, and bite your nails. Either way, this will be a great series. James up against his old team. Or Heat president Pat Riley up against the old team that he coached. No plot could have been better contrived.\n\nby Bert A. Ramirez / September 28, 2020\n\nPJ Simon uncorks one of his patented one-hand push shots against a Giñebra defense. (Photo from humblebola.com)\n\nApostle. Based on the modern dictionary, an apostle is a disciple, a follower, a missionary, an evangelist and an advocate. Peter June Simon, the Scoring Apostle, is all that and more. Throughout his legendary career as one of the greatest off-the-bench players in PBA history, Simon preached, exemplified and lived the life of a player who gave his team, the Purefoods franchise for which he played all his 16 years as a professional, whatever it needed, whether it was manufacturing points where he excelled, giving his team an offensive spark off the bench, a clutch shot to win a game, a great teammate, an excellent ambassador for the team outside the playing court, or simply a cheerer and supporter from the bench like he mostly did towards his last two years as a Magnolia Hotshot.\n\nYes, PJ earned the moniker “Scoring Apostle” mainly through his excellent scoring prowess and ability to create his shot that would fit alongside his given and family name – Peter Simon – which matched that of the Apostle Peter Simon whom Jesus Christ anointed as the first leader of the Catholic Church, but perhaps unknowingly and in a providential way, that nickname also fit the 5-foot-11 guard so perfectly for the virtues that he exemplified and the character that he carried as a player and as an individual.\n\nIt’s very rare that anyone, particularly with Simon’s caliber that frustrated many an opponent or made them lose a matchup or a game, could earn universal respect and admiration. Yes, from even some of his most bitter rivals on the court.\n\nWhen PJ announced that he is retiring from the game this past week, Mark Caguioa, a fierce adversary considering the rivalry between Simon’s team and Caguioa’s Giñebra club, was quick to pay tribute to Simon. “My only batchmate left from (the) 2001 draft. One of the nicest guy(s) on and off the court,” the Giñebra veteran said. “PJ might be a nice guy but don’t let that fool you. I call this guy a quiet assassin because he usually goes under the radar. He is a born winner and a true champion. Thank you for all the great battles. Bro, good luck on your next chapter.”\n\nSol Mercado, another Giñebra adversary, also took note of Simon’s kind demeanor, but stressed that he was a “real killer” on the hardcourt. “Always respectful and classy, never took your kindness for weakness,” Mercado said.\n\nAnd players from other teams were similarly effusive in their praise of Simon. Veteran Gabe Norwood, Rain or Shine’s captain, said on Instagram, “I always respected the way you competed and the way you played the game.”\n\n\"It was my pleasure playing against you,“ San Miguel’s Chris Ross also remarked, while teammate Alex Cabagnot said, “Congrats on the retirement! Wonderful career. Enjoy life! #idolsOnly #legend.”\n\nRetired PBA star and many-time Gilas Pilipinas member Jimmy Alapag said, “Congrats on a Hall of Fame career my friend! Always had my utmost respect! One of the best!”\n\nFormer Alaska star Jeffrey Cariaso, whose playing career intersected with that of Simon and who served as Purefoods assistant from 2011-2014 during Tim Cone’s tenure with the ballclub, validates what his rivals said about PJ. “One of my favorite people in the PBA. Congratulations on a great career.” the current Alaska mentor said. “Such a warrior and winner on the court. And a genuine, high-character individual off it.”\n\nRyan Gregorio, who coached Purefoods for nine years and is mainly responsible for turning Simon into the PBA legend that he became, probably knew PJ as much as anybody and, just like the rest, was impressed most of all by his inherent good personality both on and off the court. \"More than his on-court exploits, his demeanor separates him from the rest,” Gregorio said. “There is no mean bone in his body. He is your consummate player and a model person. I wish him all the best in his future undertakings.”\n\nPJ’s teammates, of course, only have good words and wishes for their well-liked comrade.\n\n“Salamat tol @pjs08 sa binigay mo na saya sa team at sa PBA! Salamat sa mga kwentuhan, champion, kulitan at samahan natin!” said Marc Pingris, who with Simon and James Yap used to form the so-called Big Three for the Purefoods ballclub. “Saludo ako sa yo. mabait na kaibigan at mapagmahal sa family at sa fans! It’s time na mag-enjoy ka kasama ang maganda at mabait mo na asawa! Basta kung may problema tol alam mo number ko!”\n\n“Love and prayers my brother… been a pleasure playing next to and learning from you every day. All love and respect,” backcourtmate Justin Melton said in a comment to Simon’s retirement post on Instagram.\n\n“One of my best teammates!!! Love you brotha!” wrote former teammate and now-Barangay Giñebra forward Joe Devance, with whom PJ and the then-San Mig Coffee Mixers won a Grand Slam in 2014.\n\nAnd the accolades did not only come from contemporaries. Even a relative youngster, like NLEX’s Kiefer Ravena, also had good words for him. “One of the greatest stories out there. Just goes to show there are different ways to make it to the league! It was a pleasure guarding you and playing against you kuya @pjs08! God bless sa next chapter!” Ravena said in response to Simon’s Instagram post.\n\nIndeed, that captures Simon’s story and how he made it into the PBA. The Makilala, Cotabato native was drafted in the fifth round of the 2001 PBA draft, the 43rd overall selection by the now-defunct Sta. Lucia Realtors. But he went unsigned by Sta. Lucia and had to take his talent instead to the then-Metropolitan Basketball Association with the Davao Eagles. He then signed with Dazz Dishwashing Liquid, the Lamoiyan Corporation franchise in the then-semi-pro Philippine Basketball League, when the MBA disbanded in July 2002 and proceeded to validate the talent he had shown earlier with the Eagles and, before that, with the University of Mindanao varsity squad, with whom he earned three MVP trophies.\n\nGregorio, who was looking to fortify the Purefoods team then, always had his sights trained on Simon, whom he believed had a complete set of basketball skills even then. “I was impressed by his basketball instincts,” recalled Gregorio, who saw PJ at ringside leading the then-renamed Fash Liquid team tangle with the star-studded Welcoat Paintmasters squad in the 2004 PBL Platinum Cup finals. Welcoat then counted on Simon’s future Purefoods teammates Yap, Paul Artadi and Ervin Sotto (Kai’s father) as well as Jojo Tangkay, but PJ outplayed them all as he sparked Fash to the title, his second with the team after earlier leading then-Hapee Toothpaste to the 2003 PBL Unity Cup championship.\n\nSimon in the process bagged the MVP award, beating both Yap and then-teammate Rich Alvarez, who would go on to become the top pick in the 2004 PBA draft ahead of Yap. “PJ couldn’t be stopped. He took all of them to school and won,” recalled Gregorio. “The next day, I talked to Mr. (Rene) Pardo and said, ‘Sign this free agent. This guy is legit.’” The rest of course is history as PJ would prove his coach right.\n\n“That year, we were able to draft James at No. 2 and Paul (Artadi) at No. 11. Then we got PJ from the free agency. So, as if we got three blue-chip recruits that season,” said Gregorio, now retired and currently an executive at Meralco and a special assistant to Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas president Al S. Panlilio.\n\nGregorio then orchestrated a trade that brought Marc Pingris from FedEx the next year to form a lethal two-man frontcourt with Kerby Raymundo, and the Purefoods club won two more championships under Ryan with that core, giving PJ his first two PBA titles. “We had Kerby at the ‘5’ spot, Ping at ‘4’, and a solid three-man and two-guard rotation involving James, Noy Castillo, and PJ. And Paul and Roger Yap were our point guards,” Gregorio, now 48, explained. “PJ came off the bench. He was my super sub. He would come in and manufacture instant offense for us.”\n\nTrue enough, Simon established a reputation as probably the league’s most explosive reserve. On November 10, 2010, for example, he scored a career-best 42 points in B-Meg Derby Ace’s 102-97 victory over Air21, hitting 13 of 15 shots from the floor (2-of-4 from three-point range), while making 14 of 18 free throws.\n\nOn December 17, 2010, he also exploded for 35 points in B-Meg’s 106-97 double overtime win over then-newcomer Meralco in Game One of their quarterfinal series en route to sweeping that series before losing to Talk ‘N Text in six games in the semifinals.\n\nOther exhibits of the Scoring Apostle’s offensive game was a 32-point job on December 13, 2006 in Purefoods’ 114-73 blowout of Coca Cola in the 2006 Philippine Cup, where PJ combined with Yap splendidly to power the Chunkee Giants to the title by beating Red Bull in the finals in six games, and a 31-point game on May 13, 2007 in a 117-105 loss to Giñebra in the 2007 Fiesta Conference, Simon’s top scoring night in an import-laden conference.\n\nSimon’s ability to manufacture points when needed made him one of the most feared players even coming off the bench. In fact, Alapag, who was already two years into the league when PJ finally got his break from Purefoods, singled him out as the toughest defensive assignment he had in his stellar career.\n\nSpeaking during his guest appearance in the podcast 2OT, Alapag answered when veteran broadcasters Carlo Pamintuan and Magoo Marjon asked that question: “Easy. PJ Simon. I had nightmares about that one-arm floater with him posting me up. One of the best.”\n\nThe 5-foot-9 Alapag, a six-time PBA champion himself who made an excellent international career playing for the national team, said nothing worked against PJ as he recalled even trying to play physical with him. Those matchups, in fact, gave PJ’s amiable character an opportunity to shine even more, making it even more challenging for Jimmy as Simon carried himself very well despite all the hits he took. “He would never say a word, which made it even tougher! Because I would do everything – push him away from the block, hit his arm, hold him,” Alapag shared with a smile. “Nothing worked.”\n\nSimon would go on to take an even more stellar role when he later became one-third of the team’s Big Three along with Yap and Pingris as Gregorio would resign from the team to coach the Meralco Bolts under the MVP Group of Companies in 2010. The trio’s partnership produced five more championships with Tim Cone at the helm, including only the fifth grand slam in PBA history in 2014. Tim Cone’s reassignment to Barangay Giñebra in 2015, as well as Yap’s controversial trade to Rain or Shine in 2016 for Paul Lee, however, would somehow put a damper on Simon’s role on the team with the constant adjustments that had to be made, although the now-Magnolia Hotshots won another crown under current coach Chito Victolero in 2018 with the import-laden Governors’ Cup title.\n\nNo matter if Simon’s career would seem to have ended with a whimper with the way his role had been diminished on the team, it can’t take away from the luster that it enjoyed for more than a decade, which he marked with eight All-Star selections, a PBA Mythical Second Team berth in 2014, an All-Star Game MVP award in 2008, a Three-Point Shootout title in 2019, and two Mr. Quality Minutes Award (the PBA’s equivalent of the NBA’s Sixth Man Award) in 2008 and 2014, one of only four players to do so twice, the others being Jayson Castro, Rodney Santos and Ronald Tubid.\n\nHe of course won eight PBA championships, more than the two players regarded as the greatest in franchise history ever won in their legendary careers – Alvin Patrimonio, who got five, and Yap, who took seven.\n\nSimon’s career scoring average of about 11 points, which of course had been diminished by his warming the bench through the last two years under Victolero, is also deceptive, as he played approximately just half of a possible 48 minutes. Taken on a per-36-minutes basis which would have been normal for a player of PJ’s caliber, that average would have risen to over 16 points.\n\nFor Simon, however, that wouldn’t have mattered much, true to his apostle’s reputation in terms of character and values. For him, having played for 16 years in this basketball-crazy nation’s top hoops league was good enough.\n\nIt’s no wonder there is no player the candid Gregorio could be prouder of. “Truly one of the best players that I have coached,” he said. “Seventeen years after and many championships given to Purefoods, I am so happy to be proven correct.”\n\nAnd so are the legion of Purefoods fans who have reveled in Simon’s exploits, and, now, memories.\n\nPJ would now have more time to spend with his wife, the former Jehza Huelar, the 2018 Miss Supranational Philippines who is due to give birth to their first child shortly. (Photo from Peter June Simon’s Facebook account)\n\nby Bert A. Ramirez / July 10, 2020\n\nSix years ago today, the then-San Mig Super Coffee Mixers achieved the most coveted feat in the PBA – a grand-slam victory or a championship triple – by beating the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters 92-89 in the fifth and deciding game of the Governors’ Cup Conference finals. The humdinger of a win gave the Mixers a fourth straight PBA title at that point, a feat that’s certainly the high point in the original Purefoods franchise’s illustrious history.\n\nThe singular achievement, only the fifth, and, as it’s turned out, the last grand slam in PBA annals, was fraught with all the trappings of a development that could have only been brought by destiny. After all, the events that unfolded to eventually see the first grand-slam win in the league being pulled off after 18 long years all pointed to a providential, if not divine, element in play throughout the historic journey that it took.\n\nHow can one explain what took place in the fifth and deciding game, for example? The Mixers, rebuffed decisively in their first attempt to clinch the rare feat in Game 4, worked painstakingly this time to take the initiative early, never allowing the Elasto Painters to go ahead after the latter tied it up at 34 midway through the second quarter. They then went on a murderous stretch to take a seemingly formidable 69-53 lead, aided by the benching of Arizona Reid who was hobbling with a sprained ankle he sustained in the previous contest.\n\nThat Reid injury came out of the blue, and definitely was a factor in this contest, as was several misplays normally not committed by the E-Painters. That pass by Paul Lee (now a Magnolia player after that monumental 2016 trade for former franchise face James Yap to ROS) to a teammate that was somehow obstructed by the referee in front of the ROS bench was a case in point. San Mig’s blowing all but one point of that 16-point lead once Reid returned, as well as the Mixers’ holding firm never to relinquish it also had some air of providence to it, as did the four straight misses from the line by Yap and Marc Barroca, two of San Mig’s better free-throw shooters then, in the dying seconds that left the door open for the E-Painters, yet didn’t make any difference in the end.\n\nAnd those successive misses from three-point distance by Jeff Chan, Lee and finally Reid on that last play, though defended well, would also indicate that luck – or fate – was simply not on the E-Painters’ side. Heck, those three were among the best three-point bombers in the entire PBA at that point, and Lee himself demonstrated that earlier in this game where he hit treys seemingly coming from the parking lot, and Reid had made it a habit of burning San Mig on that front particularly in their two victories in the series.\n\nBut the fact that these three tried to at least extend the game into overtime, but failed, seemed to tell all and sundry that, no, it couldn’t happen simply because San Mig was destined to win this coveted and prestigious grand slam, certainly the greatest feat any team can accomplish in the local pro league.\n\nThe journey that the Mixers took to get this “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” as Yap who won the Finals MVP himself described it, was also fraught with circumstances that point to a destined grand-slam victory by San Mig. In the two previous conferences where they had to win to set up this date with destiny, the Mixers had to survive seven do-or-die battles, eight if one included their Game 7 victory over sister team Petron in the 2013 Governors’ Cup, where they last used the name B-Meg in their continuing evolution from the original Hotdogs franchise.\n\nThey had to beat Talk ‘N Text in the deciding game of a best-of-three quarterfinal series in the 2014 Philippine Cup, where they had a 1-5 start partly due to injuries and had to win four straight games at the end of the eliminations just to qualify for the playoffs. They also had to do the same in Game 7 of their semifinal matchup against Giñebra witnessed by an all-time PBA record crowd of 24,886. That was the game where they blew out the Gin Kings aided by the 30 points of Big Game James and the 28 of P.J. Simon.\n\nThen, the Mixers had to come from being snuffed out twice by Alaska in the quarterfinals of the 2014 Commissioner’s Cup after falling behind 1-0 and having to win the rubber match, and also had to survive Air21 in a deciding game in their best-of-five semifinal series. Finally, San Mig had to beat both TNT and ROS in the semifinals and finals of this conference to complete the grand-slam journey.\n\nThis historic feat by the Mixers – as indicated by the kind of journey it took – might not have come with the dominance that the four earlier grand slams were accomplished, but it certainly stands out for the determination, grit and teamwork it took to achieve it. One should note that Crispa’s two grand slams in 1976 and 1983 took place seven years apart of each other, while San Miguel Beer’s came six years after that in 1989, and Alaska’s own followed after another seven years in 1996.\n\nThat it took all of 18 years for another grand slam to happen might be attributed to the much greater difficulty of pulling off such a feat at that point due to the PBA’s greater balance, where no single team could dominate unlike in the Crispa-Toyota days or the days of San Miguel Beer that used the core of the Northern Consolidated team, or Alaska that prided itself with the chemistry that was developed by, yes, Tim Cone, the same coach that orchestrated this phenomenal San Mig achievement who to that point already stood all alone at the top of the league’s coaching firmament as the only one to have won two grand slams and 18 championships (he now has won 22, the last four with Giñebra where he moved in 2015).\n\nYes, Alvin Patrimonio, now the team’s manager, and Jerry Codiñera, the only two players at that point to have had their numbers retired by the franchise, can really be proud of this San Mig team that took after them and the great tradition they established with similar worth and talent as well as commensurate honor. And so can previous players who have worn the PureFoods, Coney Island, B-Meg and San Mig jersey like Rey Evangelista (whose No. 7 has also been retired), Dindo Pumaren, Glenn Capacio, Al Solis, Elmer Cabahug, the late Edgar Tanuan, Kerby Raymundo, Ronnie Magsanoc, Noy Castillo, Jun Limpot, Roger Yap, Jojo Lastimosa, J.B. Yango, Willie Generalao, Nelson Asaytono, Bong Ravena and Boyet Fernandez.\n\nBut a lot more people can similarly be proud of this bunch of players who had proven worthy of the Purefoods brand of talented, skillful, determined and gutsy play, people who were responsible for establishing and leading the team itself during its early days and into its evolution as a grand-slam champion. These are Ayala Corporation Chairman emeritus Don Jaime Zobel de Ayala, whom one can still imagine jumping from his box seat with arms raised to cheer his team that was then under the Ayala Group, the late Ely Capacio who steered the team to a title in the early ‘90s and would have been immensely pleased despite a different role before his demise in the San Miguel conglomerate, Baby Dalupan who gave PureFoods its first title in 1990, former team manager and still big San Mig diehard Monchito Mossesgeld, former coaches Chot Reyes, Eric Altamirano, Chito Narvasa, Derrick Pumaren, Ronnie Magsanoc and Ryan Gregorio, and, of course, current management leaders Butch Alejo, Rene Pardo and San Miguel big boss Ramon Ang.\n\nSan Mig’s singular accomplishment, to be sure, was a product of a lot of people’s effort, but make no mistake about it. It came to pass as part of the team’s destiny mainly because Cone then, along with his assistants at that point, Johnny Abarrientos, Richard del Rosario, Mon Jose, Jason Webb and those who came before them who had moved on, Jeffrey Cariaso and Olsen Racela, fully invested themselves into that mission along with the entire Mixers ballclub, starters and reserves alike.\n\nIt’s really uncanny, but for one’s destiny to come to pass, he has to fully invest himself to bring the circumstances to make it happen, and that’s what the Mixers, from the first man to the last, precisely did.\n\nby Bert A. Ramirez / February 02, 2020\n\nThe shocking, tragic passing of Kobe Bryant last January 26 in a helicopter crash that also killed his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others generated an outpouring of grief, anguish, sympathy and pathos worldwide the likes of which might have never been seen before. Why, even my own daughter Tintin, previously so casual, if not apathetic, towards my love for basketball, suddenly became involved herself, posting even more material in the family chat group than I did.\n\nObviously, the way Kobe died along with his daughter and the rest of their companions had something to do with such a universal reaction. It was a case of being gone at a remarkably young age (41) that isn’t even approached by the death of another legend, pop music and entertainment icon Michael Jackson, as Kobe died in such a cruel manner while Jackson, whose own demise at 50 shocked the world in 2009, died of a natural cause, albeit induced by an external factor.\n\nWhat made Bryant’s death oh-so-tragic is the fact that he was just about beginning a second act just after a remarkable career that made him a pop culture icon in the mold of Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, Lionel Messi and Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal, to name just a few sports figures who have reached iconic stature in this age of the Internet.\n\n“Kobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,” former US President Barack Obama, himself an avid basketball fan, said.\n\n“To think that Kobe was at the peak of his life, retired from basketball but capable of taking care of his family and doing charitable works with all the resources he had, is something anyone cannot comprehend with this tragic life ending,” my own brother Tony, a passionate basketball fan like me, told our Celtics chat group.\n\n“Oh man. This is just so sad!” Ryan Mercado of the same Celtics chat group exclaimed. “Kobe is not only a loss to basketball but he was an icon, an ambassador and a humanitarian as well.”\n\n“A true legend in the game of basketball and an inspiration to the world,” baseball great Barry Bonds tweeted of his friend as he mourned his passing and that of his young girl.\n\n“I guess sports fans all over the world are devastated by the tragic loss of a transcendent figure and his daughter,” my own kumpare and fellow roundball enthusiast Erick Reyes said. “Kobe always played the old-fashioned way. He didn’t demand for (star) teammates. He always believed that he could carry the team by being a good role model. He played injured, didn’t go for load management. He didn’t bring his talent elsewhere and could have won many more championships. Instead, in the tradition of the greats like Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, and others who wore that purple-and-gold uniform, Kobe stayed with the Lakers until he retired.\n\n“I was in Negros when Kobe played his final game in the NBA. I watched the game while having lunch and I thought this was one of the emotional farewell games. Instead, we were treated to a feast. He scored 60 points and led the Lakers to a 101-96 victory over the Utah Jazz. That is Kobe for you. He wanted the ball till the end.”\n\nIndeed, what made Kobe Bryant different from his peers was the way he approached his commitment to his sport and his profession, spawning what eventually became known as “mamba mentality” (in reference to his nickname “Black Mamba”), a kind of work ethic and passion that simply prescribes how one should approach an endeavor in order to be successful.\n\n“There was nothing inauthentic about Bryant’s intensity,” Bryan Armen Graham of The Guardian wrote in explaining Kobe’s commitment and approach to his job as a pro athlete. “He was probably the hardest worker in sports. Often it is supporting players who are praised for getting the very most out of their talent, but Bryant was an example of a supremely gifted athlete hell-bent on squeezing every last drop from his natural gifts, propelled by a maniacal competitive streak that wouldn’t have been out of place on Wall Street in the ‘80s and often led to flare-ups with cooler-tempered teammates, most infamously with Shaq (O’Neal).\n\n“He appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated no fewer than 20 times (when such appearances still mattered) and became one of the rare sporting figures to genuinely transcend the sports pages in the US and become a household name. His international popularity may have even exceeded his standing at home as he became a crucial figure in elevating the sport’s global profile. Michael Phelps may have won a record eight gold medals at the (2008) Beijing Olympics, but Kobe was the star of those Games on the ground.”\n\nKobe had game, all right, but this goes far more than his basketball stature. He was viewed as an inspirational figure who after his retirement became one of the greatest ambassadors of the game, if he still wasn’t one as an active professional. As Kobe himself remarked, “The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great at whatever they want to do.”\n\nThis is why even the staunchest Celtics fans like me cried (secretly of course) when I learned about Kobe’s and his companions’ tragic death. Bryant, I told a friend who had met him personally in his basketball academy in Los Angeles, was one of my most hated rivals because of my lifelong affinity with the Celtics, but the tragedy that befell him and the rest of his companions that included his daughter Gigi knows no bounds. We’re all human, after all, and thus we cry with their followers and loved ones.\n\nAs a member of Facebook page Celtics Nation said, “As Celtics fans we are taught one thing, hate the Lakers. But this is bigger than basketball. He was a husband, a father and an icon. Loved by millions around the world. The impact he made will never be matched.”\n\nKobe Bryant’s persona that had gained worldwide fame because of modern technology has no doubt also contributed to the worldwide impact of his passing. Many who had the privilege of having had personal encounters with him, from avowed Lakers fan and sports broadcaster Jinno Rufino to that friend of mine who used to work at the now-defunct RPN 9, Babette Pascual-Yllana, are all unanimous in saying that Bryant was a gentle human being, a humble and gentlemanly character who belied that sporting image of an arrogant competitor who had that undeniable swagger and confidence.\n\n“When I met him, there was not a tinge of yabang. Very accommodating,” Babette said. “During those times he was already planning for his retirement, that’s why he put up the Kobe Bryant Basketball Academy and, later, the Mamba Sports Academy. At that time, he was already working on the legacy that he would leave behind.\n\n“He was a gentleman, it stood out. Maybe perhaps he was raised in italy? I noticed that in my travels, mas well-mannered sila kaysa Americans. (Kobe, of course, partly grew up in Italy as his father, former NBA frontliner Joe “Jellybean” Bryant, played for a while in the Italian League, one of the top professional leagues in Europe.) Even if they (the Italians) also have superiority complex, di sila entitled kung umasta. You could see it in Kobe then that he had a good heart.”\n\nOf course, that good heart knew no bounds when Kobe needed to mentor or to simply encourage fellow basketball players young and old alike when they needed some words of wisdom or encouragement, like what Kobe did to current and former Celtics Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward and Isaiah Thomas. Bryant was one of the first to advise Hayward on what attitude to take when the then-first-year Celtic suffered that horrific ankle injury in 2017.\n\nPerhaps what also made people relate more with Bryant was the fact that they could identify with him despite his superstar image because of his own frailties and weaknesses, which he never hid from the public but eventually overcame with that single-minded purpose and determination for which he became noted. In 2003, for example, he was accused of raping a woman in his hotel room while he was in Denver for knee surgery. While admitting having sex with the woman, he denied rape, and a judge eventually dropped the charges, although he had to eventually settle out of court when the woman went on to file a civil lawsuit.\n\nWhile issuing a public apology, stating that he was sincerely ashamed of what he had done, Bryant had to go through a turbulent phase in his life that culminated with wife Vanessa filing for a divorce in 2011. Eventually though, the two reconciled, with Kobe turning to his Catholic faith and upbringing to overcome his personal crisis. Kobe and Vanessa later founded the Kobe and Vanessa Bryant Family Foundation that is dedicated to, among other things, helping young people in need, encouraging the development of physical and social skills through sports, and assisting the homeless.\n\nAsked about this commitment in 2013, Bryant said, “My career is winding down. At the end of my career, I don’t want to look back and just say, ‘Well, I had a successful career because I won so many championships and scored so many points.’ There’s something else that you have to do with that. (The homelessness) issue is one that kind of gets pushed on the back burner because it’s easy to point the blame at those who are homeless and say, ‘Well, you made that bad decision. This is where you are. It’s your fault.’ In life, we all make mistakes and to stand back and allow someone to live that way and kind of wash your hands of it… that’s not right.”\n\nIs it still surprising why Bryant achieved that iconic status of his?\n\n“An icon is the perfect word for him. His impact was far more than basketball. Unbelievable,” Brandon Goldberg of Celtics Nation said.\n\n“Kobe was an icon and a legend. He was always driven and committed to his goals. A man with vision,” said my own sister in the US, Kitchie Beltran, not especially a staunch sports fan like another younger sister, Lourdes Beltran is (they’re married to brothers, thus the similar surnames), but who knew Kobe through the extent his stature reached. “The impact of his death was felt by almost everyone. They say that the people’s reaction to Kobe’s passing could be compared to the way the world reacted to the death of JFK (former US President John Kennedy) and the loss of Princess Diana.”\n\nThat’s true, of course. And that’s also due in part to the available technology nowadays, which really brings more intimacy to a worldwide public, providing infinitely more people much closer knowledge about a celebrity or icon, particularly a great basketball star like Kobe whose game has become a global sport much like football. And this is why the impact of Kobe’s death is felt more not only because of the circumstances of his death, but also because basketball is now in the world’s cultural mainstream due to the technology available.\n\nEven then, all those factors wouldn’t have made a difference in making Kobe Bryant even bigger in death than he was in life perhaps without the element that counts most of all – his character and greatness as a human being. That element transcended race, sports and cultural boundaries for him to be universally mourned.\n\nAs my favorite golfer of all time, Jack Nicklaus, said, “Kobe Bryant embodied excellence. Legendary talent; inspirational athlete; great role model; American icon loved globally. Sports lost a tremendous friend but (you) don’t have to be (a) sports fan for your heart to hurt. Just have to be human!”\n\n“You inspired a generation,” my brother Raul’s inaanak Angel Espejo de Llana said in his own obituary for Kobe. “You were the example of hard work and determination. You will always be remembered as an inspiration and a hero.”\n\n“Kobe was truly larger than life, a legend,” Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio tweeted. “LA will never be the same.”\n\nPerhaps Bill Velasco, in his eloquent tribute to Bryant in The Philippine Star, put it best when he wrote, “I believe that the deepest, core reason why Kobe Bryant stirred us so is that he took us to places inside us that very few of us dared to go… It was his fearlessness to look within, to face his weaknesses, to pile onto his strengths, to refuse to recognize limits, that is what we mourn… Kobe Bryant ventured alone into the realm of what is possible more deeply than most of us ever will… He showed us the light that leads inside of us, and faced his own demons and flaws to prove that it could be done.”\n\nRest in peace, Kobe. Yours was a life that was short by human standards, but it was a life well-lived, and a life that gave joy to millions of people.\n\nby Bert A. Ramirez / January 26, 2020\n\nThis would get some people, especially members of the younger generation who were brought up with the spectacle of Kobe Bryant, LeBron James and Stephen Curry doing their thing on NBA courts riled up, but I have to make this case – if only to correct the impression that today’s players, as represented by the so-called “King,” LeBron James, were decidedly, almost inevitably, superior to those of another era, the ‘80s, as represented by a Hick from French Lick, Indiana who plied his trade in Boston, Larry Bird – and thus set the record straight.\n\nNo, it’s not all about belonging to another generation, or being enamored by one’s own affinities he is imprisoned by the past and loses sight of what’s going on now. No, far from that. It’s about caring for the game and its history, and making sure that the larger picture is not lost in the face of the current-day hype especially surrounding today’s best players.\n\nFor example, whenever any pundit or latter-day scribe says LeBron James is the best-passing forward, let alone possessed the highest basketball IQ in history, I just cringe as if they never knew, or, worse, have forgotten that there was one dude who could do it even better than LeBron does. I don’t care about the numbers but LeBron can never be as good a passer, much less have a better basketball mind than Larry Bird did. (As proof that LeBron can’t be better than Larry as a passer and a floor visionary, we are sharing here a video showing 50 passes that will debunk that ill-perceived, almost thoughtless notion by today’s misguided observers and chroniclers.)\n\nPeople indeed now have the temerity to say LeBron is the best small forward who ever played the game, that he is even the greatest player of all time, period. But honestly, the only edge I can think of that LeBron had over Bird is his longevity, and even that has an asterisk over it. This is because James started his NBA career right out of high school. Bird, on the other hand, completed his collegiate eligibility and entered the NBA at the ripe old age of 23. That alone gave James a five-year headstart, no matter if Bird’s injuries curtailed him late in his career and prevented him from playing more games than he should have.\n\nThe problem with today’s fans is that they equate talent and skills with one’s athleticism, and many people tend to forget the greatness of Larry Legend, including the sportswriters, simply because he was almost anathema to today’s more athletically gifted players. The 2013 NBA finals alone, where James’ Miami Heat edged San Antonio 4-3, is an example. Everybody was going gaga over LeBron’s numbers, not realizing that the rate of usage (the number of times the ball goes through one player) was so lopsidedly on James’ side, and that the efficiency rating of LeBron in that series has to be one of the lowest in any star’s one-man domination of a series, much lower than Rick Barry’s 1975 finals during his Golden State Warriors’ four-game upset of Washington, or even Jerry West’s in the LA Lakers’ losing stand against Boston in 1969.\n\nSimply put, people have been deceived by LeBron’s dominance almost by default. This is not to diss James, but when current-day announcers of the game, for example, call him the greatest passing forward of all time, they might be missing (or forgetting, if they’re old enough) this amazing skill showcased by Larry during his time. This skill, in fact, was partly responsible for Bird’s turning the game, along with Magic Johnson, from the selfish, individualistic sport that it was perceived to be in the ‘70s, during which even the NBA finals were shown on a tape-delayed basis, into the team-oriented, passing game that it’s supposed to be all along and ushered in its golden era in the ‘80s, when it became so popular such popularity paved the way for making it the global game that it eventually became in the ‘90s.\n\nJust to make things clearer, in what area of the game does James really have the edge over Bird? Shooting? Nope. He can’t even shoot 80 percent from the free-throw line. Rebounding? Oops, it’s Bird by a mile there. Playmaking? It’s still Bird without question (just look at that video).\n\nAll right, James might have a slightly better assist average than Bird (7.2-6.3 in the regular season and 7.1-6.5 in the playoffs) but that has to be taken into context considering his usage rate. James holds the ball 70-80 percent of the time, particularly now with the Lakers where he is acting as the de facto point guard. This partly explains why his teams’ point guards sometimes felt marginalized and was, in fact, partly responsible for Kyrie Irving’s asking for a trade that brought his-then Cleveland sidekick to Boston in 2017. But for sheer quality and impact of passes, Larry Legend has to get the edge in this particular skill over the King, just as he undeniably has in rebounding and shooting. The accuracy, effect, timing and opportunism as well as creativity of Bird’s passes simply trump those of James’.\n\nWhenever Bird handled the ball during his time, he often passed it to his teammates whom he pleasantly surprised many times for making the game easier for them. And that’s what basketball should be all about, shouldn’t it?\n\nThe only area in the game where James might have had the decided edge over Bird was defense, and this was mainly because of his superior athleticism that enabled him to make better one-on-one coverage. But Bird was no slouch on defense either, doing it more in the context of team defense and being recognized for that with three All-Defensive Second Team selections in his career. And for those who may not be aware, James is now short of trash there as he hardly even makes an effort in that area now to preserve himself on the offensive end.\n\nIn short, Bird trumps James in most, if not practically all facets of the game, and that’s notwithstanding the fact that Bird did everything within the team concept while James had that ridiculous usage rate that liberally allowed him to put up those numbers. And remember, Larry did all his stuff in an era that may be considered the most competitive in NBA history, and when the rules allowed the physicality that today’s no-touch rules forbid.\n\nBut fans nowadays have nothing in their mind but James when talk shifts to all-around value and skills, perhaps in part due to the fact that the technology nowadays enables practically everybody in the world to access NBA games and anything that discusses it. In Bird’s time, these technologies were not yet around. Imagine if all that – the Internet, live streams and podcasts – were already there? What would have they done to a sports superstar’s image, and, by extension, the perception of his value and talent?\n\nThis is why oldtimers like me who have seen the game since the ‘60s (in my case) and therefore would have a better range of perception at least would like to put things in perspective to prevent the hype from overwhelming the truth, and, worse, revising history as it should be recorded.\n\nby Pocholo D. Hermoso / 12 September 2019\n\n(Photo courtesy of Rappler)\n\nWith the UAAP season now with us, our collective excitement – and maybe stress? – is greatly aggravated. But along with these sentiments come expectations for the teams we’re rooting for. Which teams will make the postseason? Which teams won’t? What award will this player win? And the biggest question of them all, who will win all the marbles? With seniors graduating, fresh blood entering the league, and summer league stints, here’s how I think all eight UAAP teams are going to fare.\n\n1. UE Red Warriors\n\nAfter losing super-superstar Alvin Pasaol, the University of the East is undoubtedly in full rebuild mode. In fact, a day or so before the season opened, coach Joe Silva stepped down as team mentor, and was replaced by Philippine Basketball Association Developmental League coach Lawrence Chongson of the Tanduay Rhum Masters, who led the Red Warriors to the finals in 2009. This team is definitely not expected to win games this season; its main goal is to expose its players to the rigors of a UAAP season and develop them for the future. Being a rebuilding team, the Red Warriors have done a tremendous step one of the rebuilding process: recruiting a cache of young talent. After the team’s final roster cut, 12 out of the 16 players are either rookies or sophomores. If taught and nurtured right, the Red Warriors are poised to become one of the best teams in the league in 2-3 years’ time. They may not be contenders now, but they absolutely will not give up on games — they will try to score an upset in all 14 games. As the UE faithful proudly roar, “Go Fight! UE! Iwakadima!” expect team veterans Philip Manalang and Nick Abanto, along with a bevy of rookies, to keep their alma mater proud – watch out for potential backcourt star Rey Suerte among these.\n\n2. NU Bulldogs\n\nWith a failed season 81 for the National University Bulldogs, expectations have lowered for them this season. After winning only four games last season, a playoff berth is still a dream for this team. In a team filled with role players, NU would be best served running the offense exclusively through the younger Ildefonso, Dave. The sophomore averaged a team-high in points per game with 15.2 to go along with 5.6 rebounds and 2.8 assists. Dave Ildefonso is expected to take a leap towards being a superstar in this league, together with a developing supporting cast of Senegalese Issa Gaye, streaky scorer John Lloyd Clemente, elder brother and skipper Shaun Ildefonso, and the only two blue-chip recruits of the Bulldogs, Miguel Oczon and Robert Minerv, both from NU Bullpups. NU has become popular in its recruitment and development of players, particularly from its juniors squad. NU must emphasize developing star players from the young core, along with continued recruitment from its uber-talented Bullpups squad.\n\n3. FEU Tamaraws\n\nAfter making the playoffs in dramatic fashion, the Far Eastern University Tamaraws lost the man that made it all happen. While FEU’s offense doesn’t revolve around a star, losing your best scorer will always hurt the team. That star, Arvin Tolentino, is now graduated, so FEU’s focus should shift towards grooming their next best scorer. The Tamaraws are also generally young so their search for a new star may take long, but once they do get to do it, FEU should be back in the postseason in no time. With the team now built around veteran combo guard Wendell Comboy, expect a faster-paced Tamaraw squad on both ends of the floor. Together with him in the backcourt is point guard LJ Gonzalez, who is a shifty ballhandler and can score if he needs to. Other vets like forwards Kenneth Tuffin and Barkley Eboña should help beef up the Tamaraw frontline and ably back up rookie center Patrick Tchuente of Cameroon in the post. For sure, celebrated Blue Eagle and now-FEU mentor Olsen Racela and his assistants – former PBA legends Johnny Abarrientos (who also starred for the Tamaraws in college) and Jojo Lastimosa (himself a former Blue Eagle), as well as retired PBA slotman Gilbert Lao – will have their hands full pushing their wards to vie for a playoff spot.\n\n4. DLSU Green Archers\n\nIf you are a diehard De La Salle University alumni or fan under the impression that your Green Archers will win the championship, let alone make the playoffs, then this is a season to forget. The three imports that the Green Archers recruited last year were one-and-done this season, and one wonders how this will help in securing their team’s long-term prospects. In addition to having no reliable recruits yet, the team lost former team captain Kib Montalbo and Santi Santilian. With two key cogs gone, La Salle is due for an elevated performance from sharpshooter Aljun Melecio and Mythical Five selection Justine Baltazar. La Salle isn’t picked to make the playoffs this year, but with the team’s rich history and championship DNA, it may be too early to count the Archers out. Let’s see what type of noise they can make.\n\n5. UST Growling Tigers\n\nThe University of Sto. Tomas is a sexy pick to make its postseason return this year. As CJ Cansino resumes rehabilitation of his torn ACL (he is expected to play in the season opener against UE), the team’s roster represents a predominantly young team, with majority being rookies. While many of these Growling Tigers may be rookies, their potential is off the charts and they have the mentality and talent to make it to the playoffs. These new and fresh faces include Beninese big man Soulémane Chabi Yo, former La Salle swingman Brent Paraiso, the long and athletic small forward from Pangasinan, Rhenz Abando, and Mark Nonoy, a UAAP “seniors-ready rookie” from the juniors program of UST. Spearheaded by this army of newcomers, the Growling Tigers are ready to make some noise this season 82 under highly-regarded coach Aldin Ayo.\n\n6. Adamson Soaring Falcons\n\nAfter having fallen short season after season after season, the Adamson University Soaring Falcons’ window of opportunity is closing; this year may be their last chance to win a UAAP championship. Definitely, they will have to rely on sweet shooter Jerrick Ahanmisi to deliver the goods for them, as for the first time in his collegiate career, he is the alpha dog of this team. Bolstered by a more-than-solid supporting cast, the Soaring Falcons are once again a contending team this year. This season, they aren’t generally picked to end up with the twice-to-beat advantage they had last season. This puts them in familiar position. From Seasons 79-80, the San Marcelino-based squad was challenged with having to beat the then-Ben Mbala-led Green Archers. Despite losing to those Archers in both seasons, an upset victory in a playoff series with any team should heal the wounds of all the Falcons’ past playoff shortcomings.\n\n7. UP Fighting Maroons\n\nTo be the champions, you gotta beat the champions. The Fighting Maroons of the University of the Philippines are primed to win it all this season 82. After coming out of nowhere to reach the finals last year, everyone now knows what to expect from this team. This is because despite losing star skipper and leader of the “Atin ‘to” movement, Paul Desiderio, the Maroons have reinforced their squad with former La Salle star Ricci Rivero and the ever-popular Kobe Paras. After years of winless seasons and playoff absences, this is the deepest team the Fighting Maroons have ever had since their last championship team back in ’86, when Kobe’s dad, Benjie Paras, Ronnie Magsanoc and Eric Altamirano starred for the Maroons. With the two new stars combining with the uber-talented Gomez de Liaño brothers and floor general Jun Manzo, Bo Perasol’s army is in the running for becoming eventual UAAP champions. The only team in their way…\n\n8. Ateneo Blue Eagles\n\nFresh from a back-to-back championship victory last season, the Ateneo Blue Eagles have the proverbial target on their backs. In a general interview by ABS-CBN, Ateneo is the consensus team to beat. Despite losing two games in the regular season last year, the Blue Eagles elevated their game onto extraordinary levels that they looked practically unbeatable. However, season 82 will be completely different from last season. Many teams have bolstered their rosters. Moreover, they are playing this season without Raffy Verano, Jolo Mendoza and the graduated Anton Asistio. Most importantly, their biggest threat, the UP Fighting Maroons, may even be more star-studded than themselves — this season would definitely be no walk in the park for the Blue Eagles. But despite being a team full of star power as well, coach Tab Baldwin’s men do not rely on a superstar (even someone of Thirdy Ravena’s caliber); they have a system, a system so successful it has led them to three finals appearances, along with two chips. But considering all circumstances surrounding the team, Ateneo should get ready to be able to defend its crown and continue its dynasty.\n\nby Reuel R. Hermoso / August 15, 2019\n\nThey weren’t given much of a chance when Season 81 began.\n\nDespite having the most formidable frontline ever in women’s volleyball in the University Athletic Association of the Philippines, the Ateneo de Manila University Lady Eagles were at best considered a low-end placer in the Final Four. Most pundits already conceded that the defending three-peat champions from Season 80, the De La Salle Lady Spikers, were finally going to give coach Ramil de Jesus that elusive four-peat – something that has evaded him and his team three times already. In Season 81, it appeared that, finally, this rare sporting feat was within their grasp.\n\nIn their opening match of the season against the Lady Spikers, the Lady Eagles could muster just a set against the defending champs in a 25-14, 25-17, 16-25, 25-19 defeat. This shortfall would be replicated in the second of two elimination rounds of the season on an even more disappointing scale when La Salle handily swept them in straight sets.\n\nMeantime, an erstwhile dominatrix of UAAP volleyball was beginning to stir from a decade-long hibernation – the University of Santo Tomas Golden Tigresses were racking up win after win especially in the second round. And no win was bigger than that of their second-round elims matchup when they beat the defending champion Lady Spikers 25-14, 25-23, 23-25, 25-19. This after the Lady Spikers showed their championship poise and swag in their first-round elims game, taking from the Golden Tigresses three straight sets after the ladies from España shocked the defending champs in the first set to tame the Tigresses 21-25, 25-23, 25-19, 26-24.\n\nBut even in that first-round meeting, it was quite evident that UST would prove to be the bane of the defending champions. That deciding fourth set in their Round 1 encounter came down to a race to 26 after the Tigresses tied the set at 24-all. The Taft ladies led by captain Desiree Cheng and the other Des – Lourdes Clemente – had to conspire through service aces and excellent net defense on upcoming Tigress sensation Eya Laure to be able to finally seal the match. Rookie gigil – the Tagalog term for wanting to do too much too soon along with a pumped-up adrenalin and a sign of youthful overeagerness and immaturity, traits that she will most certainly soon outgrow – characterized Eya’s play in the end-game, attacking the defense of Des Clemente at the top of the net but being thwarted by a game-winning kill block.\n\nAs fate would have it, meanwhile, the Lady Eagles began stretching their wings once again, going on a spectacular winning run in the first and second rounds, beating every opponent – except the defending champs. In the usual exchange of oneupmanship, La Salle fans and alumni may take cold comfort in the fact that the new champions never won against the former champs. But there’s really no such thing as an asterisk championship – a crown is a crown is a crown. As any diehard would say, “I’ll take a win any time – whether it’s by one point or 100 points!” Ateneo fans and alumni would be happy to take the grand prize either way. And who knows? Things could have been different in the finals had the Green and Blue been the protagonists.\n\nProvidence had other plans, however, and by the time the second round of eliminations rolled around, the now-former champs were slowly disrobed by the higher-tier teams – being exposed as a mere shell of their former volleyball powerhouse glory, and in dramatic fashion beginning with their match against the erstwhile perennial cellar-dwellers, the University of the Philippines Lady Maroons. Under international mentor Godfrey Okumo, the Lady Maroons were gradually transformed from one of the league’s doormats to a steady powerhouse Final Four contender for two straight seasons now. Unfortunately, though, they’ve just fallen short of landing a finals berth in the same period, despite the presence on the team of some of the best non-pro athletes the sport has seen – Kathy Bersola, Tots Carlos, Isa Molde, Bernadette Tiamson and Marian Buitre – who are among the top talents on the Lady Maroons roster.\n\nPundits believe it would be just a matter of time before the other Katipunan-based team finally makes it to the Big Dance, like their brothers on the UP men’s basketball team. They may be hampered by the departure since last year of an able net defender like Kathy Bersola and a reliable open hitter like Bernadette Tiamson, but UP’s recruitment efforts are, according to observers, now running at par with those of Ateneo and La Salle. Expect some hidden rubies to emerge brightly in the coming seasons for the Lady Maroons. Distinguished international coach Fabio Menta is also helping out with the UP Integrated School Girl Maroons in the girl’s division, and has brought some very important lessons in modernizing the game for the girls in the crucial formative years of junior and senior high school.\n\nStill, even with its impressive but futile performance in the last two seasons, UP showed that it’s here to stay – in the Olympus of women’s volleyball, among the best of the best in its league. And nowhere was this most evident than in the Lady Maroons’ 6-2 sweep in sets this season of the three-peat champ Lady Spikers. Round 1 saw both teams dragging each other to a death match fifth set, which the Lady Maroons took. In Round 2, the Lady Maroons swept the defending champions, and established their place in the country’s pantheon of women’s volleyball, and, by extension, lending credence to the observation by not a few pundits that it would be difficult for the defending champions to successfully defend their crown – if they even get to the finals in the first place.\n\nThis observation was also bolstered by La Salle being manhandled not just by UP and UST, but also by the Far Eastern University Lady Tamaraws. Though they were handily beaten in straight sets by the title defenders in Round 1, the Lady Tams didn’t consider that a setback, stringing up consecutive wins in the remainder of the elims and losing only to Ateneo in Round 2. When they faced their first-round tormentors in the final game of the eliminations, the ladies of Morayta came back with a vengeance, defeating La Salle in a classic five-setter that could well be one of the best displays of volleyball ever seen.\n\nAnchored on the steady stream of points from open hitters Jerillee Malabanan, Kyle Negrito and Heather Guino-o and backed up by rookie sensation Lycha Ebon, FEU effectively put the cuffs on the Lady Spikers’ chance at defending their crown with that pulsating victory because the latter would also go on to lose to UST in their subsequent game, creating a virtual twice-to-beat advantage for the latter going into the Final Four. (A win by La Salle would have given it the No. 2 spot at the end of eliminations and an important twice-to-beat advantage facing UST; instead, it was UST that secured that advantage courtesy of the FEU win, a victory that prompted the Tigresses and their fans to send some love – and merienda – over to the other corner at Morayta from España.)\n\nIn the end, the ladies of Taft were forced to give up their hold on the title when they lost two straight games to the Golden Tigresses in their Final Four matchup. In the second game of that series that could have gone three games had La Salle won it, the two teams dragged each other to a do-or-die fifth set as the ladies from España scored a spine-tingling 25-19, 25-19, 20-25, 23-25, 15-10 victory to end the defending champs’ three-year reign and again frustrate their four-peat bid. Dethroned in two straight games, the Lady Spikers sustained their worst finish in a decade. Archer captain Desiree Cheng bid the Green faithful a tearful goodbye, and so did her nickname-sake Des Clemente, a one-and-done transferee from the University of Perpetual Help System Daltas in the National Collegiate Athletic Association, and another one-and-done star from the NCAA, Jolina dela Cruz, formerly of the Lyceum of the Philippines Lady Pirates.\n\nThe championship series was itself a match for the ages: old guard with a storied UAAP volleyball past, UST, against the come-lately Ateneo. The trophy tally is a veritable mismatch. Even combining their lone title when they were still with the NCAA, Ateneo is a babe-in-the-woods compared to UST, the Lady Eagles having only four titles (the last three in the UAAP, including this latest championship) and the Golden Tigresses a whopping 16 crowns! (NB: The FEU Lady Tamaraws remain at the top of the UAAP food chain with 29, repeat, 29 championships in women’s volleyball.)\n\nStill, because of their recent successes, particularly in clinching three championships in the last six years, the Lady Eagles have achieved a level of fame that many teams elsewhere and in whatever event can only dream of. They have gained a devoted following that spans nearly two decades back to the days of Charo Soriano and Bea Pascual, a devotion that has grown to greater heights upon the entry of the so-called Fab Five – open hitter Fille Cainglet (now Cayetano), middle blocker Gretchen Ho, opposite hitter Dzi Gervacio, setter Jem Ferrer, and utility Aye Nacachi. But none boosted the Lady Eagles’ stock in the public eye more than the arrival of Alyssa Valdez – who has become practically the face of Philippine volleyball. Together with topnotch teammates – libero Denden Lazaro, open hitter Ella de Jesus, middle blocker Amy Ahomiro, opposite hitter Mitch Morente, and utility Bea Tan – she led the Lady Eagles to their first-ever UAAP championship in 2014 and a repeat the year after.\n\nIt was this spate of recent successes that led to speculation – even expectation – that Ateneo would make it back to the finals, even with Valdez having graduated, and, yes, again win it all. But UST would prove to be a huge stumbling block to that ambition when the Tigresses scored a straight-sets victory in Game 1 of the finals on May 11 at the Araneta Coliseum – 25-17, 25-16, 25-20 – before a sellout crowd and a stunned blue-and-white faithful. As expected, Sisi Rondina led the Tigresses in demolishing the listless Lady Eagles set by set, backed ably by Eya Laure, Caitlyn Viray, Kecelyn Galdones and Ysa Jimenez. Veterans like opposite hitter Dimdim Pacres, libero Rica Rivera and setter Alina Bicar also contributed to the Game 1 victory.\n\nOn the other side of the net, the Lady Eagles were a picture of utter chaos, committing error after error and ensuring their opponent’s win. A doppelganger of Pauline “Ponggay” Gaston, who defended the floor very well with excellent first-ball receives in the Final Four match versus FEU, could not materialize as she was unable to field the loaded services launched by the Golden Tigresses. The service aces of Sisi and Alina were spectacular for the UST cause and practically extinguished any advantage the Lady Eagles might have had at the net. That said, blocking was excellent for the ladies from Loyola Heights, and was the only bright spot they had, although this was somewhat sparse for them during this game. Notable performances for the Lady Eagles were those of middle blockers Maddie Madayag and Kat Tolentino, the latter being able to attack at will while moving more like an open hitter than a middle.\n\nGame 2 on May 15 was therefore do-or-die match for the Lady Eagles, and many, even from among their fan base, thought that this was the end for them – what with the Growling Tigresses’ superb Game 1 showing. Fortunately for them, the Ateneans rose to the challenge to deliver a clutch four-set performance and win 26-24, 14-25, 25-21, 25-15. Leaning on their “Towers of Power” – Maddie, Kat and captain Bea de Leon – the Lady Eagles gave it their all, yielding only Set 2 to their opponents and dominating them at every turn.\n\nFor the Growling Tigresses, though, what sank their collective hearts was the ankle sprain caused by the hyperpronation of Eya’s left foot. Both sides gasped in horror – the two teams and their respective crowds – as she folded down on the floor, tears visible no doubt due to the pain but also perhaps because of thoughts racing in her mind that she would not be able to help her team rally back in Set 3. Her father, former PBA star Eddie Laure, carried her off the floor and into the dugout, from which she emerged late in Set 4 to try and do a Willis Reed of the New York Knicks back in 1970, or even a Paul Pierce of the Boston Celtics in the 2008 finals of the National Basketball Association in the US.\n\nBut it was too late, and perhaps ill-advised, for coach Kung Fu Reyes to field the young Laure, even if just maybe to inspire her teammates to try and stage a comeback. Any such thoughts had to be set aside as the Lady Eagles closed out Game 2 to set the stage for the winner-take-all third match, also in the same venue – the Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay City – three days later.\n\nThat was a Saturday, the 18th, and expectedly the Mall of Asia Arena – and the mall itself – was filled with diehards in blue and yellow, and both sides were hoping to finally bring home the crown that had resided at Taft courtesy of the La Salle Lady Spikers for the last three years. And with this sense of urgency on both sides, it was also expected that a five-setter was in the works, with the championship point – this is the point where the team in the lead needs to score just one more marker to take home the top prize – extending beyond 15. That would have been an enjoyable treat for the fans of both schools, but more so for the fans of the sport itself – nothing beats the thrill of tying both teams up at championship point.\n\nAnd it did turn out to be a treat, although not exactly in the way the fans of the Growling Tigresses would have wanted things to go. Far from a five-setter, it was just a three-setter as Game 1 was, only this time, it was the Lady Eagles that won the match – and thus took home the top prize – 25-17, 25-22, 25-22.\n\nFrom the get-go, Ateneo made it clear who was in charge, who would dominate the net – and the game for that matter. For sure, Sisi would be able to punch the ball through even against two blockers, but those were rare times. For the most part, the Katipunan Wall was solid, intact, and impervious to any attempt by Sisi, Eya, or even the strong newcomers like KC and Ysa. With Bea, Kat and Maddie at the net, there was nothing the UST girls really could do but try and perhaps score off the blockers – again another rare occurrence if and when it happened – or try and land the ball in the backline or nip at the corners.\n\nBut even that backline was superbly defended by rookie libero Dani Ravena out of Miriam College High School, who even scored two markers – both on pancake saves – which showed how quick she was or how flatfooted the Tigresses were on the return ball, or maybe both. The real Ponggay also finally showed up, diving for the ball like it was nobody’s business, and Deanna Wong, with more than 30 excellent sets, created spectacular plays for Kat, and even Bea and Maddie in the middle – but none more scintillating than setting up Jules Samonte, the diminutive but high-flying open hitter, at the championship point.\n\nWhat made that championship point most exciting was the fact that UST was actually gaining fast on Ateneo, even tying them at 22-all in the third frame. A series of misfires by Sisi and Eya as well as a monstrous block for the ages that Maddie had forced on Eya pushed the Lady Eagles ahead, however, cementing the Katipunan Wall forever into Ateneo sports lore. When Jules had punched through that last point, the whole place was in a frenzy, and the Lady Eagles were once again the queens of UAAP volleyball.\n\n(P.S.: What made this championship most memorable was that, despite the fierceness of the battle and the take-no-prisoners competitiveness exhibited by both teams, when the smoke had cleared, the ladies from both camps were a jumble of heartwarming friends who clearly had a great time – win or lose – with lots of hugs and kisses exchanged. Maddie and Sisi even did a few cartwheels on the UST side of the court, to the delight of their respective fans! The Lady Archers were present as well to receive their third-place award, but aside from courteous smiles and some handshakes, it seemed they would rather have been somewhere else – and for the Lady Eagles and the Growling Tigresses perhaps, the feeling was mutual. Ha-ha-ha! See you all in Season 82!]\n\nby Bert A. Ramirez / June 13, 2019\n\nRafael Nadal raises the Coupe des Mousquetairesafter his 12th French Open title victory. (Photo by Getty Images)\n\nRafael Nadal’s recent victory in the French Open not only set a record that may never be broken, but may have also set standards of excellence that may not be matched in the history of tennis.\n\nRight after Nadal’s 6-3, 5-7, 6-1, 6-1 triumph in the finals over Dominic Thiem, whom he also beat in last year’s finals at Roland Garros and whom he has now beaten 5-0 in Grand Slam events and paces 9-4 head-to-head, praises came pouring in for the legendary Spanish tennister. This, after all, is not only his 12th French Open title, which made him the only player in history, male or female, to win as many as 12 singles titles in any Grand Slam event, breaking the record he previously shared with Margaret Court, who won 11 Australian titles and holds the most Grand Slam titles overall with 24; it also raised the number of Grand Slam championships he has won to 18, just two behind Roger Federer’s 20, the first time he has come within that number of his arch-rival’s total.\n\n“Amazing – Nadal did it again!!! The greatest accomplishment in tennis IMO…” fellow legend Martina Navratilova, who’s tied for fifth overall among female players in number of Grand Slam titles won with 18, said on Twitter.\n\n“There will never be another Nadal. Congratulations to @RafaelNadal on an incredible 12th French Open win. A genius on clay, with a tremendous work ethic, he’s a role model both on and off the court. Well done!” said another legend, Billie Jean King, seventh on the women’s Grand Slam list with 12.\n\n“Simply magnificent @RafaelNadal. Winning a Grand Slam isn’t easy. Winning 12 French titles is beyond belief. Congratulations King of Clay!” Rod Laver, one of the greatest players with 11 Grand Slam titles and the only player to win all four Grand Slam events in the same year (doing it twice in 1962 and 1969), also tweeted.\n\n“Once again @RafaelNadal proves why beating him in a best-of-five set match on clay is arguably the biggest challenge in all of sport. I mean have we seen consistency and dominance like anywhere else?” tweeted Australian and 1987 Wimbledon champion Pat Cash.\n\n“12? Really @RafaelNadal? Totally run out of superlatives for this kind of clay court tennis. Never to be matched in my lifetime and still going. Congratulations legend,” one-time world No. 4 James Blake of the US said.\n\nEven Spanish golfer Sergio Garcia and former world No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt of Australia could hardly believe it.\n\n“Amazing @RafaelNadal! 12 @rolandgarros titles! Like John McEnroe would say, ‘you cannot be serious!’” Garcia said.\n\n“I see it but I don’t believe it… (that) someone can win 12 @rolandgarros singles titles. @RafaelNadal what a performance! #TheKingOfClay,” Hewitt, a former Wimbledon and US Open champion, meanwhile, said.\n\nBut what does Nadal’s latest French Open title really mean in the larger scheme of things? He is 24-0 in both the semifinals and finals of the event, and holds an astounding 93-2 record there overall, an amazing 98 percent winning percentage. Those two losses incidentally came in a fourth-round match in 2009 against Robin Soderling and in a quarterfinal in 2015 against current No. 1 Novak Djokovic, who now trails him in Grand Slam titles with a third-running 15.\n\nGreg Rusedski, a former top-ranked British player who was once ranked world No. 4, thinks that Nadal’s feat will be talked about more than 200 years from now.\n\n\"This is the unbreakable record,“ Rusedski told BBC Sport. \"Most players don’t win 12 titles in their careers; he has won 12 clay-court majors at Roland Garros. When we’re dead, in 200 years from now, people will be talking about Rafael Nadal winning 12 French Opens.\n\n\"It is incomprehensible. This is the Tour de France of tennis and to do it 12 times is superhuman.”\n\nDaniela Hantuchova, the former women’s world No. 5 from Slovakia who now works as a tennis analyst, simply says Nadal’s supremacy at the French Open surpasses anything either Federer or Djokovic has achieved in his career, calling it the “single greatest achievement in tennis.”\n\nThis would trump Federer’s record 310 weeks as the Association of Tennis Professionals’ world No. 1 (114 weeks more than Rafa’s sixth-ranked 196 and 45 more than Nole’s fifth-ranked 265), or Roger’s record 347 Grand Slam matches won (that’s 87 more than Rafa’s third-best 260 and 77 more than Nole’s second-best 270), or Roger’s leading 101 tour-level titles (19 more than Nadal’s second-best 82), or even Djokovic’s being the only man to have won all nine Masters 1000 tournaments, or his possibly tying Pete Sampras for the most times with the top rank at the end of the year with six if he ends up 2019 at the top (Nole is currently tied with Federer at five while Nadal has four).\n\n“It’s really difficult to find words to describe what kind of achievement that is,” Hantuchova said of Nadal’s 12 French Open titles. “When you see nice words from other great champions, that just shows you’ve done something extremely special. That hashtag (the ‘King of Clay’) is going to belong to him forever because there’s no one that will ever change the history that Rafa has been able to achieve here at Roland Garros.\n\n“It’s something that we’re not really realizing to the fullest potential, that this will never be broken in any sport, what he is able to do,” the Slovakian declared.\n\nDissecting Nadal’s four-set victory in this year’s finals against Thiem, Hantuchova said Nadal again showed just how mentally tough he is as he fended off Thiem’s strong challenge particularly in the beginning of their matchup.\n\n“That’s where his mental strength is better than anyone else’s. Obviously it was very disappointing for him to lose that second set,” Hantuchova recalled. “The way he started off playing the third, even better than the first two sets, it was just incredible. From then on, it was just one-way traffic.”\n\n“The physical toll that Rafa puts on you in a 3-out-of-5-set match is perhaps the most underrated thing he does to you. Impossible for anyone to know that hasn’t experienced it first hand,” former world No. 7 Mardy Fish attested, and Hantuchova could only agree with the American’s assessment.\n\n“Dominic did stay with him for two sets but then it almost felt like he hit a little bit of a wall in the third set because it took him so much energy, the first two sets,” the Slovakian said. “Still he was able to fight until the end but this is where Rafa is the best we’ve ever seen on clay. I don’t think we’re still able to appreciate enough what Rafa is doing in sports in general. As (his trainer) Carlos Moya said, maybe in 100 years people will finally realize this is the best thing that ever happened in the sport of tennis for sure.”\n\nSo is Rafael Nadal’s 12 French Open titles indeed the greatest accomplishment in tennis? Is it the most unbreakable record of all? Let me share how a respondent to Jon Wertheim’s Sports Illustrated mailbag going by just the name Anthony put it:\n\n“Say what you will about Federer and Djokovic’s incredible records (and they are incredible), but 12?!? TWELVE French Opens? I’d put it at the top of not only tennis’s unbreakable records, but in the top tier of sports’ unbreakable records. The only possibility it has of being broken is if Nadal himself makes it 13, 14, etc. I also really feel for Dominic Thiem. It makes me think of all the generations of players Nadal has prevented from winning the French. First, Federer, as he’s a bit older. Then, his own generation of Djokovic/Ferrer/Wawrinka. Now, it’s Thiem’s gen. Next year, it might be Tsitsipas’s.”"
