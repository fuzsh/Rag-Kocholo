        "text": "As part of the University of Illinois, UIC grew to meet the needs of the people of Illinois, but its deepest roots are in health care. The Chicago College of Pharmacy, founded in 1859, predated the Civil War and is the oldest unit in the university. Other early colleges were the College of Physicians and Surgeons and the Columbian College of Dentistry.\n\nThese Chicago-based health colleges became fully incorporated in 1913 as the College of Medicine, College of Dentistry and College of Pharmacy. The College of Pharmacy was the first pharmacy school west of the Alleghenies and emphasized laboratory instruction and research.\n\nDentistry became the first American dental school fully equipped with electric drills. The College of Medicine developed the country’s first occupational therapy program and grew rapidly to become the largest medical school in the U.S.\n\nIn the decades following incorporation, several other health science colleges were created. Together with the College of Medicine, College of Dentistry and College of Pharmacy, they formed the Chicago Professional Colleges of the University of Illinois. In 1961, the professional colleges became the University of Illinois at the Medical Center.\n\nFollowing World War II, the University of Illinois increased its presence in Chicago by creating a temporary, two-year branch campus on Navy Pier. The Chicago Undergraduate Division primarily accommodated student veterans on the G.I. Bill. The program allowed all students to complete their first two years of study in Chicago before going downstate to finish their undergraduate degrees at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nThe lakeside location earned the Navy Pier campus the name “Harvard on the rocks.” The university shared the 3,000-foot pier with other tenants, including the Chicago Police Department Traffic Division and several military detachments. At that time Navy Pier was not the bright, attractive venue it is today as Chicago’s leading tourist attraction. The pier was a dreary, functioning port facility. Because the pier had only a single corridor along its half-mile length, students were able to see their peers each day.\n\nAfter the war, and after the wave of returning veterans seeking education benefits under the GI Bill had passed through, demand for a public university in Chicago remained high. The university made plans to create a permanent, degree-granting campus in the Chicago area.\n\nThe site was a 100-acre parcel at the junction of Greektown and Little Italy. To accommodate a planned student body of 32,000 in such a small area, famed Chicago architect Walter Netsch arrayed the campus buildings in concentric rings, like a droplet of water.\n\nThe University of Illinois at Chicago Circle — named for the nearby ultra-modern freeway interchange — opened in February 1965. “Circle,” as it was called, was a degree-granting institution, with ambitions to become a great university. A member of the faculty proudly noted it was the first university to be named for a transportation feature since Oxford and Cambridge.\n\nWithin five years of the campus’s opening — a period during which it was the fastest-growing campus in the country — enrollment grew from 5,000 to 18,000 and almost every department offered graduate degrees. Befitting the location of the campus at a crossroads of immigration, many of Circle’s students were the first in their families to attend college – as are many of UIC’s students today.\n\nUIC was born in 1982 when the Circle and Medical Center campuses consolidated to form a comprehensive university campus with seven health science colleges and an academic medical center. Consolidation helped UIC reach elite Carnegie Research I status.\n\nIn 1993, then-UIC Chancellor (and later UI President) James Stukel launched the Great Cities Initiative to join UIC teaching and research with community, corporate and government partners in tackling urban challenges. Renamed the Great Cities Commitment at its 10-year mark, the signature program integrates research with genuine community engagement.\n\nIn the 2000s, UIC’s South Campus development brought student housing, retail stores, restaurants and private residences to the historic Maxwell Street neighborhood. The influx of faculty and staff families and the expansion of student housing helped UIC change from a daytime commuter campus into a vibrant, 24-hour academic community. Today, one-third of UIC first-year students and about one-fifth of undergraduates live on campus.\n\nIn July 2019, UIC opened its newest campus living facility. The 10-story Academic and Residential Complex, which is part of a public-private partnership, holds 550 beds in a mix of traditional dorm rooms and suite-style units. Three large lecture halls, four classrooms, several small group study rooms, a tutoring center, computer stations and collaboration spaces are highlights of the facility’s academic areas.\n\nThe Engineering Innovation Building, which also opened in July 2019, is the first new academic building on the east side of campus since 1991. The 50,000-square-foot facility houses instructional space, research labs and faculty and staff offices. The building also includes the university’s first high-bay structural research lab, where researchers can carry out a wide range of tests on large-scale structural components.\n\nAdditional new campus construction projects are underway to support scholarship and research and improve the student experience.\n\nIn August 2019, UIC acquired the John Marshall Law School and formed Chicago’s only public law school. Formerly an independent private school, John Marshall was founded in 1899 and for over a century upheld a tradition of diversity, innovation and opportunity and provided an education that combines an understanding of the theory, the philosophy and the practice of law. The creation of UIC School of Law provides current and prospective law students with more affordable education, as well as enhanced student services, such as access to health care, recreational facilities, residence halls and college athletics. There will be opportunities to take interdisciplinary courses, and new joint-degree and dual-degree programs are in development. These courses and programs align with UIC’s strengths in disciplines such as the health sciences, engineering and technology, urban planning and public administration, the social sciences and business."
