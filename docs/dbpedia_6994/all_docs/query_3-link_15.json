Getting to know my students and watching them grow, both academically and personally, over their time at Eastern and beyond is very rewarding.”\n\n“I hope that my research and/or creative student-centered endeavors are helping our students graduate, seek out and obtain their chosen job, and find happiness and enjoyment in their current and future lives.”\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nKristalyn Salters-Pedneault - Professor, Psychological Science\n\n“I train lots of students in our Mental Health Counseling concentration who plan to become therapists. I tell them that to be a good therapist, they would be well-served to experience as much art as possible. There’s so much to learn about being human; art is a window into to the full experience like no other.”\n\n“It gives me such a sense of accomplishment to hear about our alumni’s lives and to know that I was able to join them on part of that journey.”\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nLaura Rodriguez - Assistant Professor, Education\n\n“Due to the social nature of learning, I believe that teaching must first and foremost focus on developing and nurturing relationships with and among students. Nurturing relationships is a combination of demonstrating care and respect for your students with explicit teaching of interactional norms and communicating high expectations.”\n\n“Nurturing relationships is a combination of demonstrating care and respect for your students with explicit teaching of interactional norms and communicating high expectations.”\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nMarin Kurti - Assistant Professor, Sociology, Anthropology, Criminology and Social Work\n\n“I am a first-generation immigrant and grew up in the Bronx, New York City, where I was exposed to different cultures and backgrounds that taught me the value of diversity and encouraged my curiosity of the world around me.”\n\n“My main advice to students is to embrace lifelong learning. Every year, they should be challenging themselves to learn a new skill that’s either related or unrelated to their career.”\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nPeter Drzewiecki - Professor, Environmental Earth Science\n\n“I would encourage students to find a balance in life between work, fun and family. Hopefully these are not mutually exclusive activities! I also encourage them to never stop learning about the world around them, keep asking questions and continually challenge themselves.”\n\n“One of my ongoing research projects is to understand the climate and environments of the Jurassic rocks in the Connecticut Valley, which were deposited at the time dinosaurs roamed the planet.”\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nRacheal Pesta - Assistant Professor, Sociology, Anthropology, Criminology and Social Work\n\n“The most rewarding experiences at Eastern are cultivating meaningful relationships with students. Whether it’s supervising an independent study or honors thesis, or having the opportunity to mentor undergraduate students towards independent thinking and scholarship is something that makes Eastern unique.”\n\n“Receiving an email from a student who just landed their dream job or who got accepted into their top choice graduate program ranks among the most memorable and rewarding experiences I’ve had here at Eastern.”\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nSarah Baires - Associate Professor, Sociology, Anthropology, Criminology and Social Work\n\n“I think the most rewarding part of teaching at Eastern is seeing your students excel in their own research and/or their success in obtaining careers in their desired market or entering graduate school to achieve their goals. The foundation we set in our classrooms is so beneficial to our students; our small class size also supports their success.”\n\n“My main goal as a professor is to instill in our students critical thinking skills to help them become informed citizens and thoughtful contributors to our society.”\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nScott Moore - Associate Professor, History, History and Social Sciences\n\n“I urge students to approach history by being as open as possible to learning about time periods and places they haven’t had a lot of prior exposure to.”\n\n“I find it rewarding to see students who have not previously engaged with history realize how much they enjoy it by the end of the semester.”\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nTao Chen - Associate Professor, Art and Art History\n\nTao Chen’s artwork has been exhibited in juried art shows nationally and internationally. His passion for art started when his father showed Tao early on the joy of drawing and opened up a world of artistic inspiration.\n\n“Sharing my experience with my students and helping them grow academically and professionally is my favorite part of being a teacher and educator.”\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nTom Balcerski - Associate Professor, History, History and Social Sciences\n\n“I truly enjoy engaging with students inside and outside of the classroom. Whenever possible, I bring students into the wider world around them...”\n\n“I strive to teach students the contours of American history, to think critically about the past, and to conceptualize history as a contested terrain that we still navigate today.”\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nYuanyuan Jiang - Assistant Professor, Business Administration\n\n“I urge students to approach history by being as open as possible to learning about time periods and places they haven’t had a lot of prior exposure to.”\n\n“I find it rewarding to see students who have not previously engaged with history realize how much they enjoy it by the end of the semester.”\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nDavid Belles - Professor, Music\n\n“Committing to excelling in any discipline, music in this case, will transfer to all aspects of life. Allow yourself to be vulnerable and you will reach heights beyond you think you are capable of.”\n\n“We perform music from as far back as medieval times, as well as music in multiple languages. In addition, music is a vehicle for students to travel and experience cultures other than those they have experienced.”\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nKwangwon Lee - Assistant Professor, Education\n\n“After college, everyone takes a different life path, and that path may not be what we always expect. Don’t be afraid of change and be willing to take chances!”\n\n“Through my course in Play and Development, I get the opportunity to see our candidates begin the journey of developing their teaching philosophy and competencies.”\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nMartin Mendoza-Botelho - Professor, Political Science, Philosophy and Geography\n\n“Never stop learning nor be curious about the world. Value knowledge and cultures of all types and be true to yourself. Pursue careers and activities that have meaning to your life, you will not regret walking this path.”\n\n“Our students are very motivated. I enjoy seeing them progress during their time at Eastern. Whether it’s local politics, the environment or national politics, they move from simpler understanding to a more complex perspective. Their thinking becomes more sophisticated and balanced.”\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nScott Smith - Assistant Professor, Computer Science\n\n“Do something you like doing. More than likely, you will be doing it for a long time so you have to enjoy it!”\n\n“I love teaching Computer Networking and Security. That is where I can best pass on what I have learned over the years.”\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nCaitlin Vasquez-O'Brien - Assistant Professor, Psychological Science\n\n“I believe that learning should be exciting and open to everyone. I am successful when students feel the same sense of excitement about the material that I do, and when they are able to draw connections from what we are learning to the world around them.”\n\n“Students should feel the same sense of excitement about learning that professors do, and students should be able to engage with the material and draw connections to the world around them.”\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nTanya Moorehead - Associate Professor, Education\n\n“My goal is to give students the opportunity to get to know each other, so that they feel comfortable to take risks together and learn.”\n\n“We have a campus environment where everyone is learning, open to conversations. I can even invite President Núñez to speak to my class.”\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nSudha Swaminathan - Professor, Education\n\n“I tell my students to stay flexible because the education they are getting at Eastern prepares them to be teachers for sure, but it also gives them the skills to do a number of other things that they may not realize they have the capacity or interest to accomplish.”\n\n“Seeing my students comfortable and confident in talking about their research, showcasing their capacity for reasoning and critical thinking, never fails to inspire and impress me. Those are the best moments.”\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nRicardo Pérez - Professor of Anthropology, Sociology, Anthropology, Criminology and Social Work\n\n“Students interested in Anthropology should hone the skills they gain at Eastern — critical thinking, problem-solving, and clear and effective written and oral communication; these will be assets to any job or future career path.”\n\n“The most rewarding aspect about teaching at Eastern for me is getting to know and interact with a diverse group of students.”\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nMegan Heenehan - Professor, Mathematical Sciences\n\n“Don’t feel stuck on one path. It’s ok to try one career and then pivot to something else. Be open to learning new things and find something you enjoy doing.”\n\n“Interactions with students inside and outside of the classroom are the best part of my job. Seeing how students grow over their four years and then hearing what they end up doing after Eastern is very rewarding.”\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nKedan He - Assistant Professor, Physical Sciences\n\n“Computers enable students to readily visualize and analyze the complex behavior of such systems, and thus present a unique and valuable tool with which they can further strengthen their intuition and solve otherwise intractable problems.”\n\n“I want to alleviate the apprehensions many students have towards science. By connecting with them early, I hope to demystify the subject and transform their initial trepidation into genuine interest and enthusiasm.“\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nKristen Morgan - Associate Professor and Chair, Design and Media Technology\n\nGet a liberal arts education; designers need to know about philosophy, history, literature, art, science, math, psychology and sociology, just to name a few. The larger your breadth of knowledge, the better equipped you are to analyze a script for design.\n\nMake real, lasting connections and work to maintain them. Reach out to people in your field that you admire and invite them for a cup of coffee.\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nAfarin Rahmanifar - Associate Professor, Art and Art History\n\nOne of the most important aspects of teaching I have learned over the years is that each student is unique and that’s rewarding to me as a teacher.\n\nStudents in my Mixed Media class are encouraged to enhance their unique artistic ability, shake up their traditional studio practices and step out of their comfort zone.\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nAnthony Aidoo - Professor, Mathematical Sciences\n\nThe most rewarding thing about teaching mathematics at Eastern is knowing that I have the support of my colleagues and my academic department to prepare graduating students who advance in life because of mathematics.\n\n‘Mathematics can be studied, applied and enjoyed by all.’ This has been the premise I have always operated on as a teacher.\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nAnthony Cornicello - Professor, Music\n\nI love showing students music that they most likely have not encountered — whether it’s jazz or classical. Quite often, there is a wonderful positive reaction that makes it all so worthwhile!\n\n“I love showing students music that they most likely have not encountered — whether it’s jazz or classical. Quite often, there is a wonderful positive reaction that makes it all so worthwhile!”\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nBrian Day - Assistant Professor of Film, Communication, Film and Theatre\n\n“I really find working with students to be very rewarding. I enjoy watching them develop as young adults as they expand their skills and knowledge, which leads to them growing in confidence.”\n\nMy teaching philosophy is that we are helping each student grow as a person as they are getting an education.\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nBryan Oakley - Professor, Environmental Earth Science\n\n“Get involved with fieldwork as much as possible. Be versatile. I am able to do what I do because while I am trained as a geologist I have collaborated with coastal planners and managers, biologists, soil scientists and coastal engineers.”\n\n“Taking students into the field and showing them how to conduct research, collect and analyze data and then present the data at a research conference is a super rewarding experience.”\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nCaitlin Carenen - Professor, History\n\n“History offers diverse career opportunities — there is no one career track. Skills that students learn studying history that are transferable to life after Eastern include critical thinking, analytical writing, exploring evidence and being able to make a persuasive argument.”\n\n“Watching my students visit a Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank and visit Israel’s Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem reminds me of why I teach what I teach.”\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nChristopher Krebs - Assistant Professor, Psychological Sciences\n\n“Life is a marathon so don’t rush it. The work that you’ve done and connections you’ve built at Eastern will last a lifetime so don’t forget that as you begin tackling the next chapters of your life. Enjoy the adventure!”\n\n“Eastern is a small public liberal arts college similar to that to which I attended during my undergraduate studies, and I am surrounded by colleagues who share a passion for teaching and genuinely care about our students.”\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nChris Torockio - Professor, English\n\n“If you want to be a writer, you have got to love the process. Writing fiction is a slow, meticulous, painstaking process, filled with infinite mistakes and false starts. Great writing never, ever, ever falls easily out of the writer fully formed, the way legend would have us believe.”\n\n“My favorite teaching moments are when a student who came to class having no idea that they liked to write discovers their voice and realizes that they have a passion for writing.”\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nCourtney Broscious - Associate Professor of Political Science, Political Science, Philosophy and Geography\n\n“Life is not a linear process. Don’t always be in a hurry to get to the next milestone, because you never know what types of opportunities you will miss in the present.”\n\n“I believe that institutions of higher education should be agents of social mobility and should provide an education that encourages students to develop flexible skillsets that can be applied in multiple settings.”\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nMaeve Doyle - Assistant Professor, Art and Art History\n\nI had the rare fortune to spend my whole education in small, liberal arts institutions. I love the personal, hands-on learning that places like Eastern foster. I sought it out as a student, and I’m thrilled to be part of Eastern’s public liberal arts mission today.\n\nNo matter what career you pursue, and no matter where your future takes you, art history gives you skills to adapt, succeed, and thrive.\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nGarrett Dancik - Professor, Computer Science\n\nProfessor Dancik has dedicated much of his work to teaching and developing courses in computer science, data science and bioinformatics, an interdisciplinary field that uses computational and mathematical tools to organize and analyze biological data.\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nJames Diller - Professor, Psychological Sciences\n\nDr. James Diller is an expert in the field of behavior analysis. He is credited with developing the concentration in behavior analysis at Eastern, which allows students to sit for national certification.\n\n“Many students underestimate what they can do. They’re not sure they are able to present at a conference or write a paper for publication, but they see they can do those things after working closely with a faculty mentor.”\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nJeff Calissi - Associate Professor, Music\n\nBeing a percussionist means having proficiency in more than a singular musical instrument and teaching at a liberal arts institution is rather similar.\n\n“My favorite percussion instrument is the marimba for several reasons. It is the most musical and accessible for both performer and audience, not to mention the sound of rosewood being unique and beautiful.”\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nJenna Scisco - Associate Professor, Psychological Sciences\n\n“I went to a public liberal arts college for my undergraduate degree (The College of New Jersey). My dream was to teach psychology at a similar institution, and Eastern was a perfect fit.”\n\n“I have taken Eastern students to study abroad in England, Ireland and Italy. It is such a rewarding experience to be able to expose students to new cultures and the experience of international travel.”\n\nFaculty Spotlight\n\nJonathan Hulvey - Associate Professor, Biology\n\n“I am deeply curious about how nature works, and I believe that everyone has this innate curiosity. Some of the most rewarding moments have been to witness students begin to ask more and deeper questions or try new experiments in the lab, for the sheer joy of discovering something new and being able to see the natural world from a new angle.”\n\n“Some of my most rewarding moments have been to witness students ask deeper questions or try new experiments in the lab, for the sheer joy of discovering something new and being able to see the natural world from a new angle.”"
