The University of Pittsburgh has an excellent reputation as a leader in the studies of East Asiaâ€”the faculty are some of the most well known in their disciplines, facilities for research are superb, and synergies arising from the mix of these two produce some of the most amazing graduates.\n\nReflecting the national trend of integrating arrays of humanistic and scientific disciplines, EALL's current faculty concentration has a particular strength in media and performance studies, with digital orientation.\n\nAs the name suggests, you will take graduate courses of your choosing, after consulting the academic director of the program in a variety of disciplines in humanities, social sciences, education, and international studies, to name a few. The program is administered and the degree is granted by the Department of East Asian Languages and Literatures.\n\nIDMA is typically a two-year program. Before being admitted as a student, you must have had at least two years of formal language training in Chinese or Japanese, have a strong academic record, and possess academic interests compatible with the expertise of the East Asian faculty at the University of Pittsburgh."
