Because early settlers to the area wanted to establish an institution of higher learning, the General Assembly of the State of Deseret, led by Orson Spencer, chartered the University of Deseret. State funding was limited and the economy was struggling, so the first classes were held in private homes and other make-do spaces, and money for teacher salaries and supplies came from private donations to the school. The roster the opening semester was 25 students, and tuition was $8 for the quarter.\n\nThe first classes in 1850 were held in the home of John Pack on the corner of West Temple and what is now 200 North.\n\nThe limited funds didn't last long, and in 1853, the university was forced to close. Courses were held intermittently for more than a decade, until state leaders could put greater resources into the school thanks to a rebounding economy. In 1869, John R. Park, a well-known educator in Utah, was hired as the university's first president. Under Park's leadership, the school built a solid foundation in the community.\n\nIn 1884, the university moved into its very own building for the first time, located where West High now stands in Salt Lake City (241 N. 300 West). After the move, student life began to develop on campus with the formation of literary and debating societies and the establishment of the annual University Ball. Two years later, the university granted its first degrees and formed the Alumni Association. By 1900 enrollment had grown to 400 students, and B.A. and B.S. degrees were offered in classical, scientific, and normal programs.\n\nThe University of Deseret moved in 1884 into its first building, located where Salt Lake's West High School stands today at 241 N. 300 West.\n\nIn 1892, the school was renamed the University of Utah. The Territorial Legislature petitioned Congress for 60 acres for a new campus, which was granted in 1894, landing the university on the east bench of Salt Lake Valley—its permanent home.\n\nAt an elevation of 4,330 feet above sea level, the University of Utah is set on the east bench of the Salt Lake Valley. Just beneath the towering Wasatch Mountain Range, campus provides a stunning view of the areas to the west, north, and south. The university is a part of incorporated Salt Lake City, which has a population of about 200,000 people, nestled in the greater Salt Lake Valley with a population of about 1.3 million. In recent years, the region has grown in population, cultural diversity and accolades.\n\nRecently named the Best State in America by U.S. News & World Report, Utah is frequently listed by prestigious magazines and news outlets among the “best places to live” due to a variety of factors including recreational options, the business environment, climate, and a low crime rate. And Salt Lake City, the 46th largest metropolitan area in the United States, just came in as the 21st best place for business and careers by Forbes. It was also recently ranked as the nation's second-friendliest city by Travel+Leisure magazine. The international airport is just nine minutes from downtown, and getting around is easy on TRAX, the city's ever-expanding light rail transit system. TRAX lines now connect campus with the airport and all sections of the Salt Lake Valley.\n\nIn addition to the diverse assortment of restaurants and bars (with culinary options running the gamut from tapas bars to nouvelle cuisine), there are two beautiful mixed-use shopping/living areas—the Gateway, on the west side of the city, and City Creek, in the heart of downtown. The NBA’s Utah Jazz is a state staple, as are the Triple-A Salt Lake Bees. On our campus you will find the Utah Museum of Fine Arts; the Natural History Museum of Utah; and the state's abortorium, Red Butte Gardens. The U was also the founding force behind the much-acclaimed Utah Symphony and Ballet West, fixtures of the Salt Lake cultural scene.\n\nBut many Utahns spend much of their time outdoors. Seven world-renowned ski resorts are about 30 minutes away from campus. Utah was home to the Winter Olympics in 2002, and has long been dubbed to have “The Greatest Snow on Earth.” Five national parks with stunning scenery are within a five-hour drive. Forty golf courses are located throughout the valley and nearby mountains. And hundreds of miles of hiking and biking trails can be accessed in the foothills east of campus. For a quick getaway, the historic mining and ski town of Park City is only a 30-minute drive from Salt Lake.\n\nBeyond the state, Los Angeles is a 10-hour drive to the southwest, and Las Vegas is just six hours. To the north, Boise is about four and a half hours, while Denver is eight hours to the east."
