        "text": "THE Hungarian director Istvan Szabo, represented in the New York Film Festival this year by ''Mephisto'' and last year by ''Confidence,'' is one of the most impressive of the festival's current contributors. But where ''Confidence'' was a small, delicate two-character drama, the ambitious ''Mephisto'' is both less and more. The story is much larger, with many subsidiary characters and a broad historical scope. But the cost of this expanded scale is some of the precision and intimacy Mr. Szabo brought to his more modest work.\n\n''Mephisto'' is an extremely handsome film, often quite stylish and very well played. But it lacks an essential clarity. The central character, from a 1936 novel by Klaus Mann based on the real actor Gustav Grundgens, is the gifted and successful Hendrik Hofgen (Klaus Maria Brandauer), who has his greatest triumph in the role of the title. His brilliant, diabolical turn in ''Faust'' wins him the admiration of a Nazi benefactor and the opportunity to renounce his past politics and past friendships for the sake of expediency. Hendrik is no ideologue, only an actor in endless search of the ideal role.\n\nThe film presents Hendrik in a complex light, particularly in its early segments, before the direction in which he is drifting becomes apparent. He is a fascinating character at first, frenzied and mercurial, and the film races through his story in a daringly compressed style. As a young man, Hendrik is almost indiscriminately passionate. He appears capable of flying into a fury over anything and nothing, yet never really sure of his feelings and beliefs. As played cannily by Mr. Brandauer, Hendrik has the hint of a fetishistic side, but there's nothing that moves him deeply enough to bring it out in full.\n\nBut if the early parts of the film suggest that Hendrik may be headed for madness, the latter portion makes him so much more ordinary as to approach the banal. Mr. Szabo, who has set a number of characters and subplots in spin, has trouble keeping the material organized, and a number of later developments are unduly ambiguous. However, he does establish Hendrik as a man ashame d of his own behavior yet unable to alter it, a man who ac ts not out of convictionbut out of a fear and abhorrence of freedom. As such, he remains an intriguing character throughout."
