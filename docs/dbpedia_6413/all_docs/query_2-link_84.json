        "text": "Diversity in film education, an essential first step toward diversity in filmmaking, received a big boost today as the American Film Institute announced a half million-dollar grant from the Time Warner Foundation. The grant will create five full scholarships to the AFI Conservatory for applicants from communities traditionally under-represented in film and television.\n\nThe new Time Warner Foundation Fellowships, as they will be known, reflect the notable increase in scholarship opportunities for both current and incoming Fellows at the AFI Conservatory. More than $6.2 million has been raised this year for the highly selective program of approximately 260 Fellows.\n\n“Diversity is often the essential spark that catalyzes the creative process,\" said Bob Gazzale, President and CEO of the American Film Institute. \"We are honored that Time Warner Foundation has chosen the AFI Conservatory as the place to illustrate their global commitment to ensuring new voices in America's art form.\"\n\nThe first of these five scholarships was issued this Fall 2013 to Adriana González-Vega, a first-year AFI Directing Fellow whose thesis film FRENTE AL MAR (OCEANFRONT) won the Renée Crown University Honors' Orlin Prize, Best Student Film at Carmel Art and Film Festival and was an official selection at the Montreal World Film Festival. González-Vega received a BFA in Film from Syracuse University and studied abroad at the Film and TV School of Academy of Performing Arts in the Czech Republic where she directed a 35mm narrative short film. She lists among her influences a wide range of filmmakers such as Luis Buñuel, Satyajit Ray, Pedro Almodóvar and Sally Potter.\n\nThe American Film Institute notes with sorrow the passing of actors Peter O’Toole (1932-2013), Joan Fontaine (1917-2013) and Tom Laughlin (1931-2013) – all within the last few days.\n\nO’Toole’s performance in David Lean’s LAWRENCE OF ARABIA (1962) remains one of the most iconic in film history, but in a career spanning half a century, the actor also graced the Shakespearean stage and big screen – as Henry II both in BECKET (1964) and THE LION IN WINTER, in LORD JIM (1965); GOODBYE, MR. CHIPS (1969); THE RULING CLASS (1972); MY FAVORITE YEAR (1982) and VENUS (2006). We remember him in flowing white robes, his clear blue eyes, peering across the desert toward Damascus.\n\nJoan Fontaine, who died in Carmel, California, at the age of 96, will always be remembered for REBECCA (1940) and Alfred Hitchcock’s SUSPICION (1941) for which she won the Academy Award®, THE CONSTANT NYMPH (1943), JANE EYRE (1943) and IVANHOE (1952). One year younger than her sister Olivia de Havilland, Fontaine was the picture of grace and intelligence opposite such leading men as Lawrence Olivier, Cary Grant and Robert Taylor. Fontaine was licensed as a pilot and an interior decorator. She was a champion balloonist and a Cordon Blue chef.\n\nTo paraphrase Shakespeare: “Age could not wither nor custom stale her infinite variety.”\n\nTom Laughlin found lasting movie fame as the writer, director and star of the BILLY JACK series, in which he played a pacifist ex-Green Beret Native American hapkido expert battling racism during the 1970s. An American original, Laughlin bought advertising during national news broadcasts for THE TRIAL OF BILLY JACK (1974), changing the way films are distributed and marketed to this day. He ran for President three times, started a successful Montessori pre-school in Santa Monica, and also wrote extensively about Jungian psychology and alternative cancer treatments.\n\nAs we count down the remaining days of 2013 we thank all of our supporters who have graciously donated to AFI this year. If you haven’t had a chance to yet, please consider an end of the year contribution to AFI today. AFI works on many initiatives to ensure that America’s rich cultural film heritage will thrive for generations to come, and support from movie lovers like you is the backbone of our efforts. Please consider making an extra contribution or becoming a member today and know that you’re supporting important efforts like digitizing the AFI Archive.\n\nThe AFI Archive is over 5,600 hours of audio-visual content of history’s most important filmmakers, including Frank Capra, Federico Fellini, Alfred Hitchcock, John Huston, Sidney Poitier, Jean Renoir, Elizabeth Taylor and many, many more, imparting their wisdom to aspiring film artists at the AFI Conservatory. The preservation of such remarkable material is imperative for our cultural heritage. Your support will help AFI’s efforts to preserve these recordings digitally and upgrade our archive facilities, ensuring that these hours of oral histories and interviews with master filmmakers – a most irreplaceable history – will be shared for generations to come.\n\nWe sincerely thank you for a wonderful 2013 and look forward to an even greater 2014 with you. Thank you for your support.\n\nPlease make your tax-deductible year-end contribution here.\n\nSomehow, we managed to squeeze in a few minutes with Stephanie Nye, AFI's Web Programmer, Creative Services, during the \"crazy-busy\" run-up to this year's AFI FEST. We spoke to Nye in her Manor House office on the Institute's Hollywood Campus. Known throughout the organization as a great team player, Nye's answer to our second question made perfect sense.\n\n1. What do you do at AFI? I'm responsible for AFI.com, which includes AFI's program sites such as AFI Conservatory, AFI Fest, AFI Silver Theatre, AFI Docs, American Film, and all of AFI's online transaction web sites. Also, our department sends out all of the e-mail communications, including press releases and the Alumni Connection. I interface with every department at AFI that's represented online.\n\n2. What are you working on today? Today I am working on the AFI FEST web site, our year-end appeal e-mail communications, filmmaker invitations for events at AFI FEST, our daily e-mails that are going to go out during the festival… It's really crazy-busy because of FEST.\n\n3. What was your best day at AFI? I love working here. But I think I was really struck by the first Life Achievement Award I got to go to. I went to the Barbra Streisand Life Achievement Award on the red carpet, taking photos for the web site, and so I got to see everything up close and personal, and that was pretty exciting.\n\n4. How long have you been at AFI? I have been at AFI – off and on – since 2000, but I've been full-time since 2005. So what is that? Eight years?\n\n5. What don't your colleagues know about you? I think one thing they don't know about me – because they know most things about me – is that I love to country-western dance. I know how to two-step and line-dance, and I've been doing it since I was in my 20s.\n\n6. What did you do before you came to AFI? Before I came to AFI, I had a web design business. And the way I got into web design and programming was that I was a silk-screener. I worked for companies in Seattle and New York. Then I had my own business, silk-screening on t-shirts. I had a line of gay and lesbian t-shirts that I sold at pride events and the March on Washington. I wanted to sell t-shirts online so I taught myself how to build websites.\n\n7. Where did you grow up and attend school? I am from just outside Seattle – Mountlake Terrace. I went to Edmonds Community College on a basketball scholarship. It's right near where I grew up – in one of the adjacent towns. I played center in high school and forward in college.\n\n8. What's your favorite film? Favorite film – dan-dan-DAAAN! I love film in general. It's easier for me to say what I don't like. My least favorite kind of films are horror and scary films because I think I watched too many of them as a kid. But I couldn't even narrow it down to a genre. I love comedies, I love dramas, I love sappy movies, I love action films. But, if you want to pick a few, I love THE PRINCESS BRIDE, I love BABY MAMA from a few years ago. CADDYSHACK and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK are also two of my all-time favorites."
