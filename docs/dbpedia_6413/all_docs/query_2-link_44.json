        "text": "Original poster art for 'Metropolis.'\n\nOne more to go in 2022, and it's a biggie: 'Metropolis' (1927), for which I'll be doing music on Tuesday, Dec. 27 at the Jane Pickens Theatre in Newport, R.I.\n\nShowtime is 7 p.m.; lots more info in the press release below.\n\nLooking ahead, 2023 beckons as another busy post-pandemic year of silent film music.\n\nBesides a full dance card of local shows, a pair of out-of-town performing trips are already on the calendar.\n\nIn January, I'll be playing for film programs at Cinema Detroit in Detroit, Mich., and Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.\n\nAnd then in February, it's my annual pilgrimage to the Kansas Silent Film Festival at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas.\n\nI don't do personal New Year's resolutions as I don't ever seem to change. I'll soon be 60 years old, but I'm still bedeviled by teenage habits and personality trains, with a big helping of the Seven Deadly Sins mixed in.\n\nBut in terms of silent film accompaniment, according to my running list of silent feature films that I've accompanied (maintained elsewhere on this blog), right now the total stands at 373.\n\nSo that means if I make an effort, 2023 may be the year the total crosses 400. Well, that's a big round number!\n\nSo, in between repeat screenings of popular titles that comprise the bulk of my work, I'll try to salt in a few obscure titles I've never before tackled. If I do an average of one every two weeks, I should make it!\n\nOne good sign: in planning its 2023 calendar, the Somerville Theatre has booked no less than four silent features that I've never played for before, including Lillian Gish in 'Annie Laurie'; Mary Pickford's early 'Cinderella;' the recently restored MGM blockbuster 'The Fire Brigade'; and Thomas Meighan in 'The Canadian.'\n\nAll are via 35mm prints from the Library of Congress—your tax dollars at work!\n\nIn the meantime, 'Metropolis' is up next. Hope you'll join us during that strange in-limbo week between Christmas and New Year's Day.\n\nAnd a Happy New Year!\n\n* * *\n\nA scene from 'Metropolis' (1927).\n\nTUESDAY, DEC. 6, 2022 / FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nFor more info, contact: Jeff Rapsis • (603) 236-9237 • jeffrapsis@gmail.com\n\nRestored classic sci-fi epic 'Metropolis' to screen in Newport on Tuesday, Dec. 27\n\nLandmark early futuristic fantasy, with half-hour of rediscovered footage, to be shown with live music at Jane Pickens Theatre\n\nNEWPORT, R.I.—A silent film hailed as the grandfather of all science fiction fantasy movies will be screened with live music in Newport during the upcoming holiday vacation week.\n\n'Metropolis' (1927), an epic adventure set in a futuristic world, will be shown on Tuesday, Dec. 27 at 7 p.m. at the Jane Pickens Theatre Film and Event Center, 49 Touro St., Newport, R.I.\n\nThe screening, the latest in the venue's silent film series, will feature live accompaniment by Jeff Rapsis, a New Hampshire-based composer who specializes in creating music for silent films.\n\nAdmission is $15 per person; members $13. Tickets are available online or at the door.\n\n'Metropolis' (1927), regarded as German director Fritz Lang's masterpiece, is set in a society where a privileged elite pursue lives of leisure while the masses toil on vast machines and live in poverty.\n\nThe film, with its visions of futuristic factories and underground cities, set new standards for visual design and inspired generations of dystopian fantasies from Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner' to Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil.'\n\nIn reviving 'Metropolis' and other great films of cinema's early years, the Jane Pickens Theatre aims to show silent movies as they were meant to be seen—in high quality prints, on a large screen, with live music, and with an audience.\n\n\"All those elements are important parts of the silent film experience,\" said Rapsis, who will improvise an original live score for 'Metropolis' on the spot. \"Recreate those conditions, and the classics of early cinema leap back to life.\"\n\nIn 'Metropolis,' the story centers on an upper class young man who falls in love with a woman who works with the poor. The tale encompasses mad scientists, human-like robots, underground spiritual movements, and industrial espionage, all set in a society divided between haves and have-nots.\n\nFrom 'Metropolis' (1927).\n\nThe version of 'Metropolis' to be screened at the Jane Pickens Theatre is a newly restored edition that includes nearly a half-hour of missing footage cut following the film's premiere in 1927.\n\nThe lost footage, discovered in 2008 in an archive in Argentina, has since been added to the existing 'Metropolis,' allowing plot threads and characters to be developed more fully.\n\nWhen first screened in Berlin, Germany on Jan. 10, 1927, the sci-fi epic ran an estimated 153 minutes. After its premiere, the film's distributors (including Paramount in the U.S.) drastically shortened 'Metropolis' to maximize the film's commercial potential. By the time it debuted in the U.S. later that year, the film was only about 90 minutes long.\n\nEven in its shortened form, 'Metropolis' became a cornerstone of science fiction cinema. Due to its enduring popularity, the film has undergone numerous restorations in the intervening decades in attempts to recover Lang's original vision.\n\nThe restoration work has continued in recent years. In 2008, the curator of the Buenos Aires Museo del Cine discovered a 16mm dupe negative of 'Metropolis' that was considerably longer than any existing print.\n\nIt included not merely a few additional snippets, but 25 minutes of \"lost\" footage, about a fifth of the film, that had not been seen since its Berlin debut.\n\nThe discovery led to a 2½-hour version that debuted in 2010 to widespread acclaim. It's this fully restored edition that will be screened at the Jane Pickens Theatre.\n\n\" 'Metropolis' stands as an stunning example of the power of silent film to tell a compelling story without words, and reach across the generations to touch movie-goers from the real future, which means us,\" said accompanist Jeff Rapsis, who provides live music for silent film screenings throughout New England and beyond.\n\nTo accompany a silent film, Rapsis uses a digital synthesizer to recreate the texture of the full orchestra. The score is created live in real time as the movie is screened.\n\nRather than focus exclusively on authentic music of the period, Rapsis creates new music for silent films that draws from movie scoring techniques that today's audiences expect from the cinema.\n\nThe restored 'Metropolis' will be shown on Tuesday, Dec. 27 at 7 p.m. at the Jane Pickens Theatre Film and Event Center, 49 Touro St., Newport, R.I. Admission is $15 per person; members $13. Tickets are available online at www.janepickens.com or at the door. For more information, call the box office at (401) 846-5474.\n\nAn original lobby card promoting W.C. Fields in 'So's Your Old Man' (1926).\n\nUp next: I'll accompany a screening of 'So's Your Old Man' (1926), a terrific W.C. Fields silent comedy, on Wednesday, Nov. 16 at the Flying Monkey Moviehouse and Performance Center in Plymouth, N.H.\n\nShowtime is 6:30 p.m. and yes, it's a silent film starring W.C. Fields. You won't hear his nasal twang and he sports a mustache, but give it a chance. I've found from experience that the Fields silents (those that survive, anyway) are great for audience response.\n\nMore about 'So's Your Old Man' in the press release below. Hope to see you in Plymouth on Wednesday night!\n\nFor now, here's a brief report of this year's Halloween marathon of silent film screenings, which reached a crescendo with three separate screenings in three states on the Saturday prior to spook day.\n\nIt got so busy that I really didn't have time to update the blog day-by-day. Hence this attempt to catch up.\n\nThe pre-show set-up in 'The Showroom' in Keene, N.H.\n\nLet's see...on Tuesday, Oct. 25, it was 'Nosferatu' (1922) at the new Showroom venue of the Colonial Theatre in Keene, N.H. It's called the \"showroom\" because it actually was originally the showroom of a car dealer!\n\nI've been doing 'Nosferatu' pretty regularly for a long time, and everything clicked that night. Great reaction from an enthusiastic audience made of mostly first-timers for the silent film/live music experience.\n\nTools of the trade: the \"dingy bell\" I use to match the clock chimes in 'Nosferatu.'\n\nI got specific kudos from a young boy for the way I matched the bell chimes for the two times in 'Nosferatu' that a clock strikes midnight. It's a little tricky because both times characters on screen hear the clock before it's seen on camera.\n\nIf I do it just right, I can get 12 chimes exactly, and that's what happened, thus helping me build the pre-teen fan base for the silent film experience.\n\nPre-show poster posing at the Rex Theatre in Manchester, N.H.\n\nOn Wednesday, Oct. 26, it was 'The Cat and the Canary' (1927) at the Rex Theatre in downtown Manchester, N.H. Another strong turnout for this lesser-known but entertaining comedy-thriller—people seemed to get what director Paul Leni was going for, and reacted strongly throughout.\n\nIn introducing the film, in order to demonstrate the \"fame is fleeting\" principle, I asked if any members of the Laura LaPlante club were present. Two hands went up immediately!\n\nThis is another film in which a clock striking midnight is featured prominently. In this case, it's a big old grandfather clock, and when the hour comes, Leni fills the screen with a prolonged montage of hammers hitting various coils to make the sounds.\n\nNo mere dingy bell will do this justice, so instead I switch the synthesizer to a setting named 'Valerian Bells,' which sounds like something from 'The Exorcist.' Once again I won after-screening praise for my bell effects! I thought \"Heck, I'm on a roll.\"\n\nBut fate, and perhaps the spirit of Edgar Allen Poe, had other plans for me and my bells, bells, bells...\n\nLoved this series poster at the Jane Pickens Theatre in Newport, R.I.\n\nOn Thursday, Oct. 27, it was down to Newport, R.I., where the Jane Pickens Theatre was running 'Nosferatu.' To everyone's surprise and delight, well over 200 people crowded into the venerable venue to take in the vampire's exploits.\n\nHaving only started doing silent films this year in Newport, there's a great sense of discovery there, even with a film as familiar (to me, anyway) as 'Nosferatu.' The majority of attendees were first-timers, not just for 'Nosferatu' but for any silent film in a theater with live music.\n\nAnother poster in Newport. The Jane Pickens Theatre does a great job promoting screenings.\n\nAnd so audience reaction was intense and gratifying. They even laughed at my weak joke about preparing by means of braving the scary traffic getting through Boston on Route 128. Har!\n\nAnd the music once again came together to support, I hope, what F.W. Murnau and his collaborators had put into the film so long ago. Altogether, it was one of highlights of the season: a packed house and that in-the-moment feeling that a film is really connecting, creating a shared experience by everyone present. Wow!\n\nPre-show inside the Jane Pickens Theatre. My little Roland speakers (seen on stage) do a great job, filling this sized house with a big sound when needed.\n\nAlas, it was this screening in which the bells got the best of me. After a half-dozen screenings of 'Nosferatu,' I screwed up both cues! Each time, I went to hit the dingy bell button, and literally missed the bell.\n\nThe first time, I succeeded in nearly knocking the bell off the chair, and so managed to get maybe only six dings before the movie moved on. That unnerved me enough to muff the second cue as well. It was a case of \"not saved by the bell.\"\n\nFriday, Oct. 28 saw me up at Warner, N.H. to accompany 'The Bells' (1926), an obscure thriller from obscure Chadwick Pictures that benefited from performances by the not-so-obscure Lionel Barrymore and Boris Karloff.\n\nThe screening, a fund-raiser for the Telephone Museum of N.H. (Yes, New Hampshire has a telephone museum. Doesn't your state?) and so 'The Bells' seemed an appropriate title.\n\nNot the largest turnout of the season but the hall was pretty full and the film worked in spite of my clumsy attempts to integrate some toy sleigh bells into the score when needed.\n\nThis is where the bells got the best of me—fittingly in a film called 'The Bells.'\n\nThe bells referred to in the title are not telephone bells, but sleigh bells, the sound of which symbolize a murder that's committed during the picture.\n\nWell, the best I could do in advance of this screening was to find a set of toy bells glued to felt that we found in my basement with a lot of old Christmas stuff.\n\nI didn't have a chance to really test them out, and it turned out they were not even close to being up to the job. As I tried to shake them while playing keyboard with the other, they made virtually no sound. Instead of menacing, they sounded pathetic, at least to my ears.\n\nFinally, one shake too many caused them to fly out of my hand and hit the floor, where I left them, getting my sleigh bell effects from the keyboard from then on. Strangely, a woman afterwards complimented me on how effective that was!\n\nDear Santa: please bring me a set of real sleigh bells. Also, while we're on the subject, a real boxing bell would be nice as well.\n\nSaturday, Oct. 29 was the true one-day marathon: another 'Nosferatu,' this time a matinee at the newly opened Park Theatre in Jaffrey, N.H., then an evening screening of 'Der Golem' (1920) at the Leavitt Theatre in Ogunquit, Maine, followed then by a midnight screening of the reconstructed 'London After Midnight' (1927) at the Coolidge Corner Cinema in Brookline, Mass., just over the line from Boston.\n\nThe Leavitt Theatre, like all of Ogunquit, does not do Halloween halfway.\n\nThree states, three screenings, in 12 hours! And I had time for a piping hot bowl of bibimbap (see below) at the Korean Restaurant around the corner from the Coolidge, which thankfully stays open late on Saturday nights.\n\nDuring this steeplechase, as far as the music goes, I was in kind of a trance. Sitting at the keyboard, it just flowed out of me. For 'Nosferatu,' it was a synthesis of all the material I'd been developing at the six previous screenings of the film I'd accompanied in the previous two weeks.\n\nFor 'Der Golem,' it was largely a riff on the theme from Bach's \"Little Fugue in G minor.\" And 'London After Midnight' was total seat-of-the-pants improv based on three descending notes, which I have to say became thrillingly effective as the film progressed.\n\nRisky selfie of me and the distinctive Coolidge marquee, obtained by stepping into Harvard Street in front of the theater.\n\nBesides the Korean food, it was powered by the adrenaline rush from seeing so many people in costume lined up for the Coolidge's annual Halloween overnight marathon, for which 'London After Midnight' was the opening film.\n\nAdding to that was the sight of several large rats outside my car! Really—after the crowd had filed in, the rats came out of a dumpster area in an alley behind the theater and were apparently scavenging spilled popcorn and soda.\n\nMe with the line of Coolidge marathon attendees stretching back into the alley, the end of which is where I later encountered rats guarding my car.\n\nThis happened to be right where I parked my car for the load-in. Rather than be alarmed, my reaction was: \"How cool to see this at Halloween!\" Still, I had the presence of mind to make hissing noises to scare them off before moving the car out of there.\n\nIt was well past 1 a.m., but I couldn't miss the Coolidge Corner's costume contest!\n\nAnd then Sunday, Oct. 29 saw me accompanying a non-Halloween program at a new venue: the Gloucester Meetinghouse in Gloucester, Mass., an imposing structure that rises majestically out of the seaport's crowded old center.\n\nThe venue's silent film programs are usually accompanied by celebrated Boston-based organist Peter Krasinski, a good friend and colleague. But Peter was out of town and recommended me to fill in (thanks, Peter!) for a program of comedies: shorts by Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, and then Chaplin's feature 'The Kid' (1921).\n\nA beautiful fall afternoon with the Gloucester Meetinghouse in Gloucester, Mass.\n\nWeatherwise, it was a spectacular late October Sunday, but attendance was strong. One odd thing was that the church interior was noticeably warmer than it was outside. This was the result of a group using the building the night before accidentally leaving the heat cranked up to 85 all night long!\n\nBut the accidental combo of silent film and bikram-style yoga didn't stop the audience from enjoying the program, with many people afterwards praising 'The Kid' for its powerful emotional impact. Nice!\n\nI perhaps lingered a bit too long, because I then found myself high-tailing it on Route 128 back to New Hampshire, where I just barely made it to the Town Hall Theatre in Wilton, N.H. for a 7:30 p.m. screening of Alfred Hitchcock's 'The Lodger' (1927).\n\nFor this one, I know the film somewhat, but hadn't done it in a long time. And coming at the end of a long series of screenings, there just wasn't an opportunity to view it or a chance to prepare anything in advance.\n\nBut at the same time, I'd been doing films nearly every day for the past three weeks. So in my favor was a state of unusual fluency, I'd have to say, that comes from sitting at a keyboard and creating music several hours in a row day after day.\n\nAnd with 'The Lodger,' I just plunged in with a kind of aggressively syncopated jazz motif that turned out to be remarkably versatile in catching the various ups and downs of Hitchcock's first real 'Hitchcock' film: a tale of murder, false leads, misdirection, blonde women, and all the other Hitchcockian tropes we cherish.\n\nIt worked, and became one of the most satisfying accompaniment experiences of a busy stretch. No bells in this picture, but something similar: a cuckoo clock sounds twice, in close-up, at key moments, and both times I was ready.\n\nI think overall, this spooky steeplechase reaffirmed one of the basic principles of silent film accompaniment, at least the way I do it. For me, the only way to develop and maintain fluency at improv-based accompaniment is to do it a lot.\n\nWhen I do it a lot, I notice a difference. I'm able to get inside (and stay ahead) of a film in a way that seems almost effortless. The music just comes, and I find if I'm in that \"zone\" I can shape it to fit what the film seems to need at any given time.\n\nBut you can't keep this pace up indefinitely. So after 'The Lodger'—nothing! A whole note rest! The next week, including the weekend, I had no screenings—the first time since Labor Day.\n\nNow, two weeks later, I'm back at it: I accompanied a benefit screening of 'Wings' last Thursday for the Aviation Museum of N.H. (of which I'm director), and this past Sunday did music for the silent version of 'All Quiet on the Western Front' (1930) at the Town Hall Theatre in Wilton, N.H.\n\nThe screening, in honor of Veterans Day, was well attended and the music came together in spectacular fashion. It was one of those shows where you're just in synch with everything—where an accompanist can feel the rhythm of the scenes and the editing and can anticipate, say, when there's a shell blast and can capture it as a big scene unfolds.\n\nI had never scored the filim and had only previewed it once. But that was enough to be ready for a couple of big moments where the music seemed to really work well. One example: the scene where Raymond Griffith plays a dying French soldier.\n\nOnce he perishes, a character continues speaking to him, saying with increasing desperation he should have died instead. While that was going on, I kept to a moody ostinato in E minor.\n\nBut every so often, the camera cuts to Griffith's immobile face, just staring blankly ahead. And each time, I hit a C minor chord about an octave above, and held it for the duration of the shot.\n\nIt happens three times, and each time I pushed the volume a bit, and also added notes to the top of the chord. (It ended up being C minor with G Major on top.) I have to say, it made my hair stand on end, and I knew what was coming. I hope it had a similar affect on the audience.\n\nAnd that's it for catching up. During the holiday season, the performance schedule often thins out, but not this year—I'm booked at venues pretty regularly into the next year, including two more gigs at the Coolidge in December and January. (No costumes, but more Korean food!)\n\nBut next up: it's W.C. Fields in 'So's Your Old Man' tomorrow night at the Flying Monkey. Press release is below. Hope to see you there!\n\n* * *\n\nA production still from 'So's Your Old Man' (1926).\n\nTUESDAY, NOV. 8, 2022 / FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nContact Jeff Rapsis • (603) 236-9237 • jeffrapsis@gmail.com\n\nFlying Monkey to screen rare silent film starring comic icon W.C. Fields\n\n'So's Your Old Man' shows legendary performer as younger man; program on Wednesday, Nov. 16 accompanied by live music\n\nPLYMOUTH, N.H.—He was a performer who could be recognized by just the nasal twang of his voice.\n\nBut prior to reaching iconic fame in talking pictures, W.C. Fields successfully starred in a popular series of silent feature films for Paramount Pictures and other studios in the 1920s.\n\nRediscover the non-talking W.C. Fields in 'So's Your Old Man' (1926) one of his best silent pictures, in a screening on Wednesday, Nov. 16 at 6:30 p.m. at the Flying Monkey Moviehouse and Performance Center, 39 Main St., Plymouth, N.H.\n\nGeneral admission is $10 per person, general seating. Live musical scoring will be provided by silent film accompanist Jeff Rapsis.\n\nIn 'So's Your Old Man' (1926), Fields plays Sam Bisbee, inventor of a new shatter-proof windshield glass and regarded as a crackpot by the townsfolk.\n\nAfter a demonstration of his glass to auto executives goes awry, he faces ridicule and shame. On the way home, Bisbee encounters a woman he thinks is trying to commit suicide, and so prevents her.\n\nThe woman is really Princess Lescaboura, member of a family of European royalty, who later arrives in Bisbee's home town to thank him, upending Bisbee's life and setting the small town aflame with gossip. The film includes a version of Fields' famous \"golf\" routine.\n\nThe film was remade as a talkie in 1934, with W.C. Fields again starring, under the title 'You're Telling Me!' In 2008, 'So's Your Old Man' was added to the U.S. National Film Registry.\n\nW.C. Fields remains famous today for his comic persona as a misanthropic and hard-drinking egotist with a snarling contempt for dogs, children and women.\n\nAlthough Fields achieved lasting fame as a movie star in talking pictures of the 1930s, his long career encompassed decades on the vaudeville stage as well as a series of silent film roles in the 1920s.\n\n\"People find it hard to think of W.C. Fields in silent films, but he was actually quite successful,\" Rapsis said. \"As a vaudeville performer and juggler, Fields cultivated a form of visual comedy and pantomime that transferred well to the silent screen.\n\n\"Also, as a middle-aged man during the silent film era, he was able to play a family father figure—the kind of role that wasn't open to younger comic stars such as Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton,\" Rapsis said.\n\nIn all, Fields starred in 10 silent features in the mid-1920s. Several are lost; in those that survive, Fields sports a thick mustache, part of his vaudeville costume as a \"vagabond juggler\" which he dropped in later years.\n\nThe film was made not in Hollywood, but at the Paramount studios in Astoria, Queens, a popular production facility for New York-based stage performers who also appeared in film.\n\nFor the music, Rapsis improvises in real time, while the film is running, using a digital synthesizer that allow him to recreate the \"movie score\" texture of a full orchestra.\n\n\"Improvising a score live is a bit of a high-wire act, but it allows me to follow and support the film a lot more effectively than if I was buried in sheet music,\" Rapsis said.\n\n\"Instead, I'm free to follow the film right in the moment. Each time it's different, which lends a certain energy and immediacy and excitement to the experience.\"\n\n'So's Your Old Man,' a silent comedy starring W.C. Fields, will be screened with live music on Wednesday, Nov. 16 at 6:30 p.m. at the Flying Monkey Moviehouse and Performance Center, 39 Main St., Plymouth, N.H.\n\nAdmission is $10 per person.

Something about Halloween brings out people to silent film screenings.\n\nSo as a silent film accompanist, I'm willing to make hay while the sun shines, although that's a terrible expression to use regarding Halloween, which is about anything but sunshine.\n\nThe story this year is, of course, 'Nosferatu' and the 100th anniversary of the film's original release. In the two weeks prior to Halloween, I'm accompanying a half-dozen screenings in four different states!\n\nThe most recent was last night in Keene, N.H., at the Colonial Theatre's new \"Showroom\" venue. (That's it at left, prior to the screening.) Despite it being a Tuesday night, a near-capacity crowd turned out to experience 'Nosferatu,' with many first-timers in the audience.\n\nLast week, I accompanied the film in Natick, Mass. and Brandon, Vt. On Thursday, I'll do it again in Newport, R.I. No matter how many times I accompany it, the film never seems to get old—kind of like the vampire himself.\n\nThe one special effect I use in scoring 'Nosferatu' is what I call a \"dingy bell,\" which I employ to match the scenes of a clock chiming during the movie.\n\nTwo such scenes appear in the movie, and it's a bit tricky because each time, the chiming starts off screen. The characters hear it, and only then does the camera show the clock, which both times is striking midnight.\n\nIn order to make it work exactly, you need to know when to start the chiming (in my case, hitting the dingy bell) in order for it to add up to 12. After so many times, I'm usually able to do it exactly, but I'm always on edge in the moments leading up to it.\n\nShould I start now? Or now? Or maybe...oh crap, I'm too late!\n\nI happened to nail it last night, as I learned from the father of a young boy who attended. Afterwards, he said his son was most impressed with how I matched the bell hits to the on-screen action.\n\nHey, I'll take it!\n\nHope to see you at 'Cat in the Canary' tonight, or at any of the upcoming Halloween shows.

General admission is $10 per person.\n\nThe show is the latest in the Rex Theatre's silent film series, which gives audiences the opportunity to experience early cinema as it was intended: on the big screen, with live music, and with an audience.\n\n'The Cat and the Canary' stands as the original movie thriller—the first picture to feature the reading of a will in a haunted mansion complete with clutching hands, a masked killer, disappearing bodies, and secret passageways.\n\nSilent film starlet Laura LaPlante leads the cast as a young heiress who must spend the night in the creepy old mansion, which is filled with relatives who all have motives to frighten her out of her wits. Meanwhile, a dangerous escaped lunatic is loose on the grounds. Can she and the others make it through the night?\n\nMartha Maddox and Laura LaPlante in 'The Cat and the Canary.'\n\nCreated for Universal Pictures by German filmmaker Paul Leni and based on a hit stage play, 'The Cat and the Canary' proved popular enough to inspire several remakes, including one starring Bob Hope. It was also the forerunner of all the great Universal horror classics of the 1930s and '40s.\n\nThe Rex Theatre screening will use a fully restored print that shows the film as audiences would have originally experienced it. 'The Cat and the Canary' will be accompanied by live music by New Hampshire composer Jeff Rapsis, who specializes in silent film scoring.\n\nRapsis will improvise the score on the spot during the screening.\n\n\"Silent film is all about the audience experience, and this one is a perfect Halloween crowd-pleaser,\" Rapsis said. \"It has something for everyone—spooky scenes, some good comedy, and it's all fine for the whole family.\"\n\nCritics praise the original 'Cat and the Canary' for its wild visual design and cutting edge cinematography.\n\nFilm reviewer Michael Phillips singled out the film for using \"a fluidly moving camera and elaborate, expressionist sets and lighting to achieve some of the most memorable shots in silent film, from the amazing tracking shots down the curtain-lined main hallway to the dramatic zooms and pans that accompany the film's shocks.\"\n\nLeonard Maltin called the original 'Cat and the Canary' a \"delightful silent classic, the forerunner of all \"old dark house\" mysteries.\"\n\n'Cat and the Canary' will be shown on Wednesday, Oct. 26 at 7 p.m. at the Rex Theatre, 20 Amherst St., Manchester, N.H.\n\nGeneral admission is $10 per person. Tickets may be purchased online at www.palacetheatre.org, by phone at (603) 668-5588 or at the door.\n\nEmil Jannings doesn't hold back as 'Mephisto' (a.k.a. Satan) in 'Faust' (1926).\n\nAs the days grow shorter, and the list of screenings for Halloween grows longer.\n\nTonight, it's Murnau's 'Faust' (1926), which I'll accompany at the Flying Monkey Moviehouse and Performance Center in Plymouth, N.H. Showtime is 6:30 p.m.\n\nSee you there! Lots more info in the press release below.\n\nFor now, a brief report on the first of several 'Nosferatu' (1922) screenings coming up in the next two weeks.\n\nWith this year marking the 100th anniversary of the film's release, interest is heavier than usual.\n\nLast Sunday afternoon, I accompanied 'Nosferatu' to the largest crowd we've attracted so far to the silent film series at the Center for the Arts in Natick, Mass.\n\nThe Center for the Arts screening room just before 'Nosferatu.'\n\nAbout 40 people took in the film, with many staying afterwards for an extended question-and-answer session.\n\nMost had never seen 'Nosferatu,' so I need to keep that in mind when I start thinking that the film gets programmed too often.\n\n'Faust' certainly doesn't run as often, so if you're interested in seeing Murnau's last film made in Germany prior to his move to Hollywood, join us this evening.\n\nHere's the press release:\n\n* * *\n\nAn original German poster for F.W. Murnau's adaptation of 'Faust' (1926).\n\nTUESDAY, SEPT. 20, 2022 / FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nContact Jeff Rapsis • (603) 236-9237 • jeffrapsis@gmail.com\n\nRarely shown 'Faust' adaptation on Wednesday, Oct. 19 at Flying Monkey\n\nSilent film thriller starring Emil Jannings to be shown on the big screen with live music for Halloween program\n\nPLYMOUTH, N.H.—It's been a novel, a stage play, and an opera. When movies first appeared a century ago, it was only a matter of time before they tackled 'Faust,' the tale of a man who consigns his soul to the devil to obtain power in the present.\n\nAt the height of the silent era, German director F.W. Murnau created a cinematic version of 'Faust' filled with stunning images that maintain their power to astonish.\n\nSee for yourself with 'Faust' (1926), the original silent film adaptation of the classic legend, to be shown on Wednesday, Oct. 19 at 6:30 p.m. at the Flying Monkey Moviehouse and Performance Center, 39 Main St., Plymouth, N.H.\n\nAdmission is $10 per person, general seating.\n\n'Faust' is a 1926 silent film produced by German studio UFA, directed by F. W. Murnau, starring Gösta Ekman as Faust, Emil Jannings as Mephisto, and Camilla Horn as Gretchen.\n\nAs the film opens, the demon Mephisto has a bet with an Archangel that he can corrupt a righteous man's soul and destroy in him what is divine. If he succeeds, the Devil will win dominion over earth.\n\nA scene from F.W. Murnau's adaptation of 'Faust.'\n\nThe Devil delivers a plague to the village where Faust, an elderly alchemist, lives. Though he prays to stop the death and starvation, nothing happens. Disheartened, Faust throws his alchemy books in the fire, and then the Bible too. One book opens, showing how to have power and glory by making a pact with the Devil.\n\nFaust goes to a crossroads as described in the book and conjures up the forces of evil. When Mephisto appears, he induces Faust to make a trial, 24-hour bargain. Faust will have Mephisto's service till the sand runs out in an hourglass, at which time the Devil will rescind the pact.\n\nAt first, Faust uses his new power to help the people of the village, but they shun him when they find out that he cannot face a cross. They stone him and he takes shelter in his home. Mephisto then uses the lure of restored youth and love to convince Faust to sign over his soul once and for all.\n\nThe remainder of the film follows the grim consequences for everyone, all depicted with vivid visual imagination in the last film Murnau made in Germany before making the move to Hollywood.\n\n'Faust' continues to impress modern critics, including Roger Ebert.\n\n\"Murnau had a bold visual imagination, distinctive even during the era of German Expressionism with its skewed perspectives and twisted rooms and stairs,\" Ebert wrote in 2005. \" 'Faust,' with its supernatural vistas of heaven and hell, is particularly distinctive in the way it uses the whole canvas.\"\n\nA scene from F.W. Murnau's adaptation of 'Faust.'\n\nIn screening F.W. Murnau's version of 'Faust,' the Flying Monkey aims to recreate all essential elements of silent film experience: high quality prints shown on a large screen, with live music and an audience.\n\n\"These films caused people to fall in love with the movies for a very good reason,\" said Jeff Rapsis, who will improvise a musical score during the screening. \"They were unique experiences, and if you can recreate the conditions under which they were shown, they have a great deal of life in them.\n\n\"Though they're the ancestors of today's movies, silent film is a very different art form than what you see at the multiplex today, so it's worth checking out as something totally different,\" Rapsis said.\n\nRapsis performs on a digital synthesizer that reproduces the texture of the full orchestra and creates a traditional \"movie score\" sound.\n\nF.W. Murnau's ‘Faust' will be shown on Wednesday, Oct. 19 at 6:30 p.m. at the Flying Monkey Moviehouse and Performance Center, 39 Main St., Plymouth, N.H.\n\nAdmission is $10 per person.
