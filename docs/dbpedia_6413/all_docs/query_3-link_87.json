        "text": "The Navajo, or Diné, people of North America hold deep beliefs in magic and shape-shifting, exemplified by yee naaldlooshii, or the skinwalker, which is a great example of both. This entity, often reduced to a mere werewolf, is a mainstay in pop culture, leaving many to wonder: Are skinwalkers real?\n\nThe answer is complicated. As with aliens, there are believers and skeptics. But one thing is certain: whether or not skinwalkers exists is a long-standing question.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, archaeological discoveries in modern-day Germany date the contemplation of therianthropes (shape-shifting or half-animal beings) back to between 35,000 and 40,000 years ago. Still, the concept remains a key feature of religion, myth and the fantastic.\n\nOriginating from Navajo (Diné) folklore, a skinwalker is a malevolent witch capable of transforming into, possessing or disguising themselves as an animal. Skinwalkers go by different names in different Native American tribes. The Navajo version is called yee naaldlooshii, which translates to \"with it, he goes on all fours.\"\n\nA person becomes a skinwalker by committing a heinous act, like killing a family member. This gives them supernatural powers, allowing them to shape-shift from a human to an animal at will. They often become coyotes, wolves, foxes or bears, though they can transition into any animal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Navajo society, skinwalkers were blamed for everything that went wrong: crop failures, bad marriages, sicknesses, sudden death — you name it.\n\nUnlike Greek myths or a demon from medieval literature — creatures for which vibrant belief has long subsided and whose attributes are readily cataloged and canonized in Western tomes — the skinwalker does not reside in a text.\n\nCharacteristics and Supernatural Abilities\n\nSkinwalkers are said to wear the skin of the animal they want to become (hence the name \"skinwalker\"), which depends on the needs of the task they want to perform. They might become a bear to have a immense strength. Note that skinwalkers voluntarily assume this role — it's not a curse, like being a werewolf.\n\nSkinwalkers can also read people's minds, control animals of the night, like owls, call up spirits of the dead, inflict pain and are almost impossible to catch and get rid of. They must continue to kill or they'll die.\n\nAccordingly to legend, you can tell if you're in the presence of a skinwalker by their eyes. If you shine a light on one when they're in animal form, their eyes glow bright red. In human form, their eyes seem animal-like.\n\nTo get rid of a skinwalker, you need a powerful shaman who knows the right spells and incantations to get the skinwalker to turn on itself. You can also shoot the witch with bullets dipped in white ash, but the shot must hit them in the neck or the hand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his 1944 book \"Navaho Witchcraft,\" noted anthropologist Clyde Kluckhohn explored magical traditions of contemporary Navajo people. Specifically, in his book he examined the \"influencing of events by supernatural techniques that are socially disapproved.\"\n\nThe author noted that English-language translations like \"witchcraft,\" are useful shorthand in this case, but they're not perfect. You can draw similarities between real or imagined European witches and skinwalkers, but the Navajo spirit world is undoubtedly unique.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBased on his interviews with Navajo people, Kluckhohn pieced together general descriptions of the various forms of \"witchcraft\" that existed within Navajo legend. He described skinwalkers as secret witches (mostly male, some female) who creep out in the night to take the form of swift-moving animals like the wolf and coyote.\n\nThey were said to gather in foreboding places to work dark magic against their victims and engage in various taboo rituals of incest, corpse defilement and sibling murder.\n\nThe Shifter in European Folklore\n\nEuropean folklore is rich with its own shape-shifter legends. For example, werewolves — creatures that can transform between human and wolf forms — are widespread in many European folk stories, such as those from France, Germany and Eastern Europe. Similarly, tales of selkies, who change from seals to humans, can be found in the folklore of Scotland and Ireland.\n\nIn Slavic folklore, there are stories of vampires that can transform into bats, wolves and other creatures. Although these entities exhibit transformative abilities like skinwalkers, the cultural contexts, stories and moral lessons from these European shape-shifters differ significantly from those of the Navajo skinwalker.\n\nWhile shape-shifting is a common theme worldwide, skinwalkers are particular to Navajo beliefs and narratives and are not found in European folk stories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSkinwalker Ranch (also known as Sherman Ranch) borders the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation in Utah and is a hotbed of strange phenomena. The cattle ranch has spawned a popular book (\"Hunt for the Skinwalker\"), a feature-length documentary of the same name and a History Channel series (\"The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch\").\n\nAs the story goes, Terry Sherman and his family gained widespread attention after encountering numerous inexplicable phenomena on their Utah property, famously dubbed \"Skinwalker Ranch\" in reference to Navajo legends of shapeshifting witches. The 512-acre ranch in the Uintah Basin has been the epicenter of numerous unexplained incidents, such as UFO sightings, livestock mutilations and other mysterious activities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1996, the Sherman family sold the ranch to billionaire Robert Bigelow, who was significantly interested in paranormal activities. Bigelow established the National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS) to investigate the paranormal incidents occurring there.\n\nThe ranch has since become synonymous with paranormal and UFO-related activities, spurring substantial intrigue, skepticism and various investigations, becoming a focal point for researchers and enthusiasts of the unexplained. In 2016, Robert Bigelow sold the ranch to Brandon Fugal.\n\n\"From encounters with mythical animals, to numerous cattle mutilations, poltergeist activity, crop circles, sightings of glowing orbs and even flying saucers, virtually everything you might call 'paranormal' has been reported at the ranch and surrounding properties,\" wrote Austin Craig in TechBuzz in 2021.\n\nFugal told the publication there was a 100-year-old history of paranormal activity, including skinwalker sightings, at the property.\n\nThe Ute Tribe Steer Clear of the Ranch\n\nThe Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation is the home of the Ute tribe. At one time, the Ute enslaved some of the Navajo people and also joined with U.S. troops against the Navajo during the Civil War. The result was that the Navajo were expelled from their lands in the Four Corners area, though they returned later.\n\nThe Ute believed the Navajo put a curse on them and left shape-shifters among them because of their vile deeds. This is why, allegely, the Ute will not go near Skinwalker Ranch.\n\nPrevious owners of the ranch had reported strange occurrences. Fugal said he bought the cattle ranch in 2016 not believing he would see anything unusual. Six months later, he saw \"UFO activity\" in broad daylight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSkeptics say there is no hard evidence of anything unusual happening at Skinwalker Ranch. However, a biochemist who was part of an investigative team there in 1997, claimed to see a \"humanoid creature\" in a tree staring down at the team. He fired at the creature with a rifle and it disappeared.\n\nIt was then he noticed it had left \"a single large print in the snow with two sharp claws protruding from the rear of the mark going a couple of inches deeper. It almost looked like a bird of prey, maybe a raptor print, but huge and, from the depth of the print, from a very heavy creature,\" according to History.com. Was that a skinwalker sighting?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch,\" a popular History Channel series, follows a team of researchers led by astrophysicist Dr. Travis Taylor, as they try \"applying cutting edge technology to investigate the 512-acre property to uncover the possibly 'otherworldly' perpetrators behind it all,\" according to the show's website."
