        "text": "France during the years of World War II has long attracted the attention of writers and film directors eager to wrestle with the complicated and dark themes that dominate the Nazi Occupation. The forces that tore France apart —some internal, some external — make for an intense backdrop and a variety of compelling themes and characters. Obviously, the excitement and risk involved in the Resistance movement is a topic that draws many readers eager to hear about the underground network as well as the isolated resistors who worked alone in both big and small ways to thwart the Germans. But, how did individuals from all walks of life cope with the sudden occupation of their country — the takeover of life as they knew it? Set during this time, the popular series Un village français External was so popular that it was only later turned into a book. Multiple seasons explore how businessmen, Communists, housewives, teachers, policemen, and Jews (both French and foreign-born), navigate the new and ever-changing landscape dominated by the Germans. As the years pass in this long-running show, the sinister horror of the Nazi plan became more apparent. Food and supplies grow increasingly scarce. The need to survive compromises the actions of even the strongest characters, while others die for their convictions. Following the storyline of these characters as they try to make sense of their circumstances makes for compelling, if excruciating, reading (or viewing). The courageous efforts of some characters are moving and inspiring, while the morally corrupt decisions made by others can only be viewed with disgust. Like much of French fiction, these novels have a strong basis in reality. Spies, double agents, and forbidden love stories fill the pages, as do the unspeakable injustice and brutality that characterize the so-called \"Dark Years\" of France. As France itself grapples with this era in its history, writers continue to seek a way to interpret, and perhaps reconcile, the events of the Nazi Occupation of France.\n\nA select bibliography of popular historical fiction in both French and English is further down the page.
