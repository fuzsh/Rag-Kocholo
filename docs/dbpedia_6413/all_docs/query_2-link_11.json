        "text": "Metropolis is based on a 1925 novel of the same name, written by director Fritz Lang’s then-wife Thea von Harbou for the express purposes of being adapted for the screen. Lang and von Harbou also wrote the screenplay. The story shows influences from H.G. Wells, Auguste Villiers de l’Isle-Adam, and Mary Shelley, as well as the culture of the Weimar Republic.\n\nBefore the book existed, though, the story was set in motion by Lang’s very first trip to New York City in October 1924. He was fascinated by the skyscrapers and the lights. Ultimately, the set designs were a beautiful mix of German Expressionism, Art Déco, and New York City architecture. Reportedly, Art Déco got a huge boost of popularity from the film.\n\nFilming began 22 May 1925, with a budget of 1.5 million Reichsmarks. Lang cast Rudolf Klein-Rogge as mad scientist Rotwang (marking their fourth film together); established screen and stage actor Alfred Abel as Joh Frederson; and unknowns Brigitte Helm as Maria and Gustav Fröhlich as Freder.\n\nLang was quite the demanding director, much like Chaplin, and frequently made his actors do numerous re-takes. A simple scene could take as long as two days to be deemed just right. Fröhlich could barely stand up by the time Lang was finally happy with all the film he’d shot. For the flood scene, Lang also made Helm and 500 poor Berlin kids work in a pool of water at a low temperature.\n\nFilming finally wrapped on 30 October 1926.\n\nThe original soundtrack was composed by Gottfried Huppertz, who’d also scored Lang’s two 1924 Nibelungen films. He drew inspiration from Wagner and Strauss, melding classical elements with mild modernism. Other elements included hymn “Dies Irae” (“Day of Wrath”) and “La Marseillaise.” During filming, Huppertz often played his score on the piano to inspire and guide the actors.\n\nThe score was meant for a large orchestra to perform. Side note: If you have the opportunity to see a silent with live orchestral accompaniment, go for it! I saw some Laurel and Hardy shorts by MASS MoCA with live musicians in I believe 2007, and I also saw the original Ten Commandments with live music in November 2015, at a local church which has been kind enough to loan their beautiful building for several film screenings.\n\nMetropolis features a number of ambitious special effects, most famously the Schüfftan process. This involves using a special mirror to give the illusion of actors being on huge, realistic sets which are actually miniatures. The technique was used again in Alfred Hitchcock’s first talkie, Blackmail (1929).\n\nDuring the adaptation from book to screenplay, and again during the numerous edits on the way to the finished product, a number of changes were made. Most of the references to magic and occultism were left on the cutting-room floor, as were the moral motivations for certain actions by the main characters.\n\nAlso abandoned was an ending where Freder flies to the stars. Since good writers can find inspiration even from junked plot elements and scenes, this ending became the basis for Lang’s final silent, 1929’s Frau im Mond (Woman in the Moon).\n\nAll that intense, hard work ultimately paid off. Initial reception was mixed, but the film has more than gone on to prove its incredibleness.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nReleased 10 January 1927 at the Ufa–Palast am Zoo cinema in Berlin, Metropolis is not only one of the greatest silent films ever, but one of the greatest films ever as well. This was also the very first silent I ever saw, at least that I was consciously aware of. This past summer, I was lucky enough to see it at the local indie theatre, at one of their 35-cent matinées. I believe that was the first time I got to see the 148-minute 2010 restoration.\n\nIn the year 2026, Joh Frederson presides over the huge, futuristic city of Metropolis. The few haves live in high-rise towers, while the many have-nots toil away in dangerous underground factories. Joh’s pretty son Freder is an idle playboy when the film opens, but all that changes when he falls in instalove with Maria.\n\nMaria has brought the workers’ children aboveground to see how the idle rich live, but this field trip isn’t long-lived. Frederson and his stooges make them leave, but Freder is determined to see Maria again. He goes below ground in search of Maria, and stumbles upon one of the machine rooms. Freder is horrified when the Moloch machine explodes, killing and injuring several workers.\n\nFreder rushes to tell his father about what happened, very shaken. Frederson is upset to learn that not only was Freder prowling around underground, but also that he didn’t learn of this accident from his assistant Josaphat. The foreman of the Heart Machine, Grof, also shows Freder secret maps which were found on two dead laborers. Frederson fires Josaphat for his incompetence.\n\nFreder resolves to do all he can to help the exploited proletariat, after seeing his father cares less about their living and working conditions. These living human souls are just impersonal cogs on a machine to Frederson, expendable commodities.\n\nFrederson gives orders for Freder to be closely watched, but Freder goes back underground. Freder is horrified to see a worker named Georgy struggling and finally collapsing by the paternoster machine (i.e., the giant clock). Georgy pleads that someone must stay by the machine at all times, and Freder kindly volunteers to take his place. They switch clothes, and Georgy gets into Freder’s car.\n\nFrederson goes to visit the mad scientist Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge, who starred in many of director Fritz Lang’s films, both silents and talkies). Years ago, Rotwang was in love with Hel, who left him for Frederson. Sadly, she died giving birth to Freder. All these years, Rotwang has been obsessed with Hel.\n\nRotwang is trying to create a robot to take the place of human workers, since it never makes a mistake or gets tired. He sacrificed his own hand towards the creation of this robot.\n\nRotwang tells Frederson the maps depict a network of catacombs beneath Metropolis, and they go to spy on the workers. Freder is also by this meeting, having been invited under the false impression he’s Georgy. Freder almost didn’t make it to the end of his 10-hour shift, and indeed collapsed at the end, right before the next worker took his place.\n\nBy the meeting, Maria tells the story of the Tower of Babel, imparts some spiritual teachings, and promises a mediator will come to save them. Frederson demands Rotwang make the robot in Maria’s likeness, so it can spread discord among the workers.\n\nRotwang kidnaps Maria, and uses her to bring his robot to life. By the time Freder finds Rotwang, the robot has been animated and gone to Frederson. Freder is shocked to find his father with the woman he believes is his sweetheart, and goes a bit mad. He passes out, and the robot goes to do Rotwang and Frederson’s bidding.\n\nI won’t spoil what happens after this, but suffice it to say, it’s an incredible, powerful, intense, dramatic, emotional journey. The film meant even more to me after my political awakening at age fifteen, but I’ll discuss that more in a later installment.\n\nIt’s hard to put into words just how awesome and incredible this film is. Your cinematic education isn’t complete if you haven’t seen Metropolis!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nHomunculus, a six-part horror series released from June 1916–January 1917, is a film many silent cinephiles have heard about (particularly with such a memorable title), but which few have actually gotten a chance to see. For many years, it remained exclusively the domain of film history books and pictures, apart from a shoddy-quality print of Part Four.\n\nThe print I saw recently is the print most silent cinephiles have seen, a cut-down Italian version which became available several years ago.\n\nEverything changed on 17 August 2014, when a meticulously-restored (albeit work-in-progress), near-complete print of all six parts premièred by the Rheinisches Landesmuseum in Bonn.\n\nStefan Droßler, director of Filmmuseum München, undertook the most gargantuan task of restoring and reassembling the entire series. Russia’s Gosfilmofond gave him the footage after a lot of negotiating.\n\nThere were 27 reels, in quite good condition, from all six parts, but they weren’t exactly in their proper order. In process of copying the footage onto safety stock, everything had been cut and mixed up, and the filmstrips were only sorted by their original tints.\n\nAll the intertitles had also been removed, replaced by single frames with the first three words of each missing intertitle scratched on.\n\nSince no censorship records with the original intertitles had survived, Hr. Droßler had to make entirely new titles. I wouldn’t be surprised to learn those censorship records were destroyed in a bombing raid during WWII, since that’s how a lot of old German and Prussian military records were destroyed.\n\nHr. Droßler reassembled six hours’ worth of footage and created intertitles with the help of every last speck of material he could find from other archives, photographs, and programs. After the Bonn première and a second showing in München on 4 September 2014, the restoration continued.\n\nIn November 2015, MoMA showed the latest version of the restoration.\n\nThe film which premièred by the Bonn film festival ran 196 minutes, at a speed of 25 frames per second. Back in 1916, the average projection speed was about 16–20 FPS, though it varied from 12–22 until it was standardized to 24 FPS in 1926.\n\nThe reassembled film is based upon the 1920 reissue, which had summarized all six parts into but three. Thus, there’s probably still material missing from the 1916 original footage. According to those who’ve seen the restoration, it doesn’t feel fragmentary.\n\nA lot of important horror film motifs come from this granddaddy of horror cinema, like the hunchbacked assistant, the mad scientist’s exuberance upon bringing his creature to life, and the brooding, dark, caped figure. However, since it came out in 1916 Germany, it was only seen in occupied or neutral European countries.\n\nThe 1920 reissue didn’t have a much wider reach, since all things German were very unpopular. Many U.S. theatres, for example, refused to play Dr. Caligari that same year, and there were protests and angry letters to newspapers when some theatres did carry it.\n\nAt any rate, it did have an undeniable influence upon horror cinema. Not many Americans had the chance to see it, but they were influenced by horror films made by people who had seen it, particularly all the great German Expressionist horror films. It’s a chain reaction, cultural osmosis.\n\nOn to the actual film itself!\n\nThe installments are as follows:\n\nThe Birth of the Homunculus\n\nThe Mysterious Book\n\nThe Tragic Love Story of the Homunculus\n\nThe Revenge of Homunculus\n\nThe Annihilation of Humankind\n\nThe End of the Homunculus\n\nPopular Danish actor Olaf Fønss played the title role, and got the highest salary in German film history up till that point. Shooting began in May 1916, and Part One premièred 22 June by Berlin’s Marble House theatre. Parts Two through Five ran over the rest of 1916, and Part Six released January 1917. Each installment was divided into four acts.\n\nProfs. Ortmann and Hansen are in competition to artificially create human life. The first to succeed is Hansen, with help from his hunchbacked assistant Rodin. Their creation is a baby boy, though historically, a Homunculus referred to a miniature, fully-formed human.\n\nTragically, Ortmann and his wife lose their newborn baby boy at only a few days old, and Ortmann immediately bring over the Homunculus. After the switch is made, Hansen believes his experiment failed.\n\nOrtmann raises Homunculus as his own son, Richard. The boy grows up normally, but for one major issue: he doesn’t have the ability to love.\n\nAt age 25, Homunculus discovers the truth about his creation, and swears revenge on Hansen, his heart burning with hatred. In spite of his inability to love, he courts and marries Hansen’s daughter Margarete. After their marriage, he lets Hansen in on the secret.\n\nHansen is horrified, and orders Margarete to leave Homunculus. Margarete, however, loves Homunculus, and saves him when Hansen tries to poison him.\n\nIn Part Two, Homunculus befriends a stray dog in North Africa, turns his wrath on Rodin, and miraculously heals a king. The queen and advisors are very suspicious of Homunculus, and once they present evidence of his artificial origins, the king orders him seized. Homunculus escapes the angry mob and vows to kill the next person he meets.\n\nIn a scene very reminiscent of The Golem, Homunculus encounters two small children, and he changes his track (at least temporarily).\n\nSince I’ve only seen a condensed version, I can’t recap the entire thing accurately, but I can say there’s a lot of chaos, destruction, and drama. I can’t wait to see it onscreen or on DVD!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nReleased 14 October 1926 in Germany, and 5 December in the U.S., F.W. Murnau’s Faust is an absolute classic of German Expressionist cinema, German silent cinema, silent film, German film, and film overall.\n\nFaust (legendary Swedish actor Gösta Ekman) is a venerable scholar who believes the most wonderful thing in creation is our ability to choose between good and evil. As the film opens, he’s the subject of a bet between Mephisto (i.e., the Devil, played by Emil Jannings) and an archangel.\n\nMephisto claims Faust is as rotten as anyone else, by preaching good while doing evil (alchemy). He offers a wager to wrest Faust’s soul away from God. The archangel says if Mephisto can destroy the Divine spark in Faust, the Earth will be his. Mephisto gloats that no one can resist evil.\n\nMephisto descends, bringing the Plague. Within a few days, half the town is dying. Faust, desperate to find a cure, spends all his time praying.\n\nA young lady takes him to her dying mother, but Faust’s potion fails to save her. In despair, he throws his vial onto the floor, and it shatters.\n\nFaust is so overcome by helplessness, he throws all his books into a fire. As they’re burning, a book about the dark arts flutters open. Intrigued, Faust takes note of the instructions for calling up the Lord of Darkness to come to one’s aid and give one all the world’s might and glory.\n\nHe grabs it from the fire and continues reading.\n\nFaust freaks out when Mephisto actually appears, and he runs home. Mephisto, one step ahead of him, is already waiting there, and offers Faust a contract:\n\n“I renounce God and the heavenly legion, and so shall be mine the power and glory of the world.”\n\nFaust orders him to get away, but the Plague compels him to wish for the power to help for one day only. Mephisto immediately jumps on this, and offers Faust a one-day trial.\n\nFaust waffles a bit, but is convinced when Mephisto says he’ll be able to help the hungry and sick. Whatever Faust wishes, Mephisto will perform. Faust will be the master, and Mephisto the servant.\n\nMephisto makes Faust sign with his own blood, saying a blood signature is more binding. After Faust makes sure it’s only one day, he finally signs.\n\nThe locals come to Faust, begging for his help. He successfully heals the first patient, but the second patient is holding a crucifix, which he’s unable to look upon or get his hands past. The people realize he’s in league with the Devil, and begin stoning him.\n\nFaust flees home, and tries to end it by drinking poison. Mephisto stops him, reminding him the trial day isn’t over yet. Faust fires back that Death makes everyone free, but before he can drink, Mephisto gives him a tempting image of his youth.\n\nAnother battle of the wills ensues, before Faust finally begs for youth.\n\nNot only is Faust transformed back to youth, but Mephisto also assumes a more youthful appearance.\n\nMephisto shows him an apparition of a pretty woman, and Faust demands to be taken to her. They set off an a spectacular journey over the world, on Mephisto’s flying cloak. They arrive at the wedding of the Duchess of Parma, Italy’s most beautiful woman, and make a lot of trouble by the reception.\n\nFaust is getting it on with the bride when Mephisto alerts him to the fact that the sand in the hourglass has run out, and with it the trial day. The image of his returning old age terrifies Faust, and he demands to keep his youth. Mephisto agrees, and says their pact stands for eternity.\n\nSome time later, Mephisto comments that nothing seems to satisfy Faust, no matter how many hedonistic pleasures he partakes of. Whatever Faust wishes, he must grant.\n\nFaust most wants to go home.\n\nThey arrive on Easter, and Faust almost immediately falls in instalove with Gretchen (Camilla Horn). Mephisto doesn’t think this kind of innocent maiden is his type, and offers to introduce him to some more obliging wenches.\n\nFaust is adamant Gretchen is the only one for him, and keeps pursuing her until finally she gives in and goes from resisting his advances to being in love herself. This part of the storyline really unsettles me, particularly since too many people still believe “No really means yes!”\n\nWhile Faust pursues Gretchen with Mephisto’s reluctant help, Mephisto flirts with Gretchen’s aunt Marthe. Some critics feel these scenes are unnecessary, and that it’s out of character for Mephisto to ham it up.\n\nAlso out of character is one of the intertitles which was originally altered for the U.S. release. When Marthe offers Mephisto alcohol, he claims he doesn’t drink. Can anyone really imagine the Devil as a teetotaler? In the German original, he says his stomach is too weak for such a fiery drink.\n\nThe plot thickens when Gretchen’s brother Valentin comes home.\n\nThough Mephisto is Faust’s servant, he causes a lot of trouble with devastating consequences. It all starts when Faust is discovered in Gretchen’s bed. From that point on, things only get worse and worse, particularly for poor Gretchen.\n\nThough there’s still a sexual double standard, and while I feel the pendulum has swung way too far in the other direction, seeing old films like this makes me so, so, so glad women who have sex and children outside of marriage are no longer treated like pariahs and condemned as whores, while men suffer no consequences.\n\nThe last half-hour is full of drama and emotion. It all leads up to three final, unforgettable intertitles:\n\nThe Word that rings joyfully throughout the Universe,\n\nThe Word that appeases every pain and grief,\n\nThe Word that expiates all human guilt,\n\nThe Eternal Word…dost thou not know it?\n\nTell me the word!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIf you celebrate Sukkot, may you have a wonderful holiday!\n\nThis week, it’s all about classic German horror films of the silent era. I’ll be covering Der Müde Tod, Faust, and Homunculus. Next week, I’ll showcase two short antique films (from 1901 and 1906), The Haunted Castle, and Dracula (which I found rather overrated). This year’s horror series will close with Frankenstein.\n\nThe common English name of Der Müde Tod is Destiny, though it was originally released as Behind the Wall. The German title, however, truly translates as The Weary Death.\n\nReleased 6 October 1921, this film originally bombed in its native Germany. Many critics felt it wasn’t German enough. Internationally, it was much more successful. Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., purchased the U.S. rights so he could delay the American release while copying some of the special effects for his 1924 film The Thief of Bagdad.\n\nWe’re introduced to an unnamed young couple travelling in a carriage, and then the scene shifts to the Golden Unicorn Inn, where several important townspeople are heatedly discussing a strange newcomer. This oddball has waged a campaign to be allowed to purchase an annex by the graveyard, and finally succeeded with enough gold. He claims he wants to build a garden there, though his plot of land is soon surrounded by a wall with no windows or doors.\n\nThe young couple runs into the stranger by the inn, where he shares their table. One of the barmaids insists they drink from the bridal cup, which turns into a terrifying vision of an hourglass. The young lady is so shaken-up, she runs away.\n\nWhen she returns, her fiancé has disappeared. She’s told he left with the mysterious stranger, and tries to track them down. By the foreboding wall near the graveyard, she sees a parade of phantoms passing through the wall, her fiancé among them. This sight so unrattles her, she faints.\n\nThe pharmacist finds her and takes her in until she comes back to herself. In the pharmacist’s home, she sees a book (which doesn’t necessarily seem to be the Bible) open to the Song of Solomon. She’s very inspired by the line “For love is as strong as Death,” and drinks a potion that opens up a door to a staircase leading to the stranger’s lair.\n\nThe room is full of candles, each one representing a life’s progress from birth to death.\n\nShe begs him to restore her lover’s life to her, and he says it was just her fiancé’s time to go. He had no control over it, and had to do his job. Harvesting all these souls is so wearying, not at all a job he enjoys or does with gusto. Each soul is like a candle, and once it burns out, there’s no reprieve.\n\nAfter enough begging and pleading, Death agrees to give her three chances, represented by three candles. Each candle is a life she can save. If she saves even one of the three young lovers, Death will give her back her fiancé. But once each candle burns out, there can be no do-over.\n\nThe Story of the First Light is set in Persia; the Story of the Second Light is set in Renaissance Venice; and the Story of the Third Light is set in Ancient China. Though these are all historical settings, they’re more the realm of historical fantasy than straight historical. Of the three stories, I most enjoyed the Chinese one. It has so much charm, innocence, and sweetness, together with my longtime interest in Chinese history.\n\nIn each of the three stories, the young lovers are played by the same couple as in the establishing German frame story, Lil Dagover (who played Jane in Dr. Caligari) and Walter Janssen. In each story, however, it’s the young lady who plays the starring role.\n\nThough she fails to save any of the three lives, Death takes pity on her, and gives her one final chance to prove herself. If, within one hour, she can bring him the soul of anyone who only has a short time left in the world, he’ll take that life in exchange for her lover’s and restore life to the young man.\n\nI won’t spoil what happens after this, but I will say it’s a very powerful final reel, with an unforgettable, very emotional ending.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
