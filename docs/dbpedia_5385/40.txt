Lin Zexu (30 August 1785-22 November 1850) was a Qing Chinese scholar and official whose hardline anti-drug policies led to the disastrous First Opium War. While the initially-supportive Daoguang Emperor criticized him for leading China into the first of two disastrous wars with Britain, the Chinese diaspora in New York City erected a statue to him in Kimlau Square to commemorate his moral high ground in the war on drugs.
