        "text": "Anyone walking through Chinatown and Lower Manhattan can feel the Asian-American presence and influence on New York City’s culture. Bet let’s get specific! What are the figures, monuments, and locations that represent these communities’ histories?\n\nStop #1: Bayard Street, between Baxter and Mulberry\n\nWhat you’re looking for: A bronze statue on a granite pedestal\n\nWhat is this? This Monument, sculpted by Lu Chun-Hsiung, depicts the Founder of the Republic of China. Dr. Sun Yat-Sen is shown in a Tang jacket and Manchurian dress, representing Chinese dress/culture’s widespread influence. His pioneering philosophy, which eventually made him a President, envisioned a peaceful, cultural and intellectual merging of East and West. He traveled the world promoting democracy and fighting for China to be free from imperial rule.\n\nA fun fact: the engraved calligraphy on one side of the pedestal that reads Confucius’ famous motto “All Under Heaven Are Equal” is in Dr. Sun’s own handwriting, with his personal stamp right next to it.\n\nStop #2: Bowery and Division Street, traffic island at the intersection\n\nWhat you’re looking for: A 16-foot sculpture on a green marble pedestal\n\nWhat is this? This statue of of Confucius, donated in 1976 by the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association of NYC (in celebration of the USA bicentennial), sits outside The Confucius Plaza apartments. This housing co-op, with almost 800 apartments, was the first public-funded housing project created for Chinese Americans (1975). The monument of Confucius, sculpted by Liu Shih, honors the Chinese philosopher and draws crowds of tourists and locals alike. On one side of the pedestal, you’ll notice an American Flag, accompanied by an inscription of Confucius’ proverb, “The Chapter of Great Harmony.”\n\nA fun fact: On the West side of the pedestal, the vertical Chinese inscription reads: ” The World Is A Commonwealth.”"
