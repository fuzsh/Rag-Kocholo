        "text": "I. The Chinese government places great importance on drug control. President Xi Jinping has provided important instructions and speeches on multiple occasions regarding drug control. On June 19, 2014, February 21, 2019, and June 18, 2019, President Xi Jinping listened to reports on drug control and delivered important speeches. On June 24, 2014, June 21, 2018, and June 22, 2020, President Xi Jinping issued important instructions on drug control. On June 25, 2015, President Xi Jinping cordially met with representatives of outstanding collectives and individuals in the national drug control efforts and delivered an important speech. Specific details can be found in public reports.\n\nII. Construction of drug control institutions and teams in China. According to the \"Drug Control Law of the People's Republic of China,\" the National Narcotics Control Commission (NNCC) is the coordinating body under the State Council responsible for organizing, coordinating, and guiding national drug control work. It currently has 41 member units, including the Ministry of Public Security, National Health Commission, Ministry of Education, etc. Mr. WANG Xiaohong, Secretary of the Central Committee, State Councilor, and Minister of Public Security, serves as the Director of the NNCC. The office of the National Narcotics Control Commission is located in the Narcotics Control Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security, and it currently has 13 departments, including the Prevention and Education Department, Drug Investigation Department, Prohibition of Drug Use and Cultivation Department, and International Cooperation Department, etc.. Drug control committees, offices, and specialized teams have been established nationwide in provinces, cities, and counties. There are currently 26,000 police officers dedicated to drug control in the public security system. The Ministry of Public Security also has a Narcotics Intelligence Technology Center (National Anti-Drug Laboratory) responsible for drug control research, drug testing, analysis, and identification.\n\nIII. Situation of drug control laws and regulations in China. The \"Drug Control Law of the People's Republic of China\" has been in effect since June 1, 2008, providing comprehensive regulations for drug control work. Four laws, including the \"Criminal Law,\" \"Criminal Procedure Law,\" \"Public Security Administration Punishment Law,\" and \"Drug Administration Law,\" serve as the legal basis for drug-related criminal enforcement and administrative enforcement. The \"Criminal Law\" includes 13 drug-related criminal offenses, such as \"smuggling, trafficking, transporting, and manufacturing drugs\" and \"illegal possession of drugs.\" The \"Public Security Administration Punishment Law\" stipulates penalties for illegal activities such as drug abuse. China rigorously enforces drug control and takes strict measures against drug-related crimes. According to relevant laws, anyone involved in drug-related crimes, regardless of the quantity involved, will be convicted and punished.\n\nThe State Council has issued regulations including the \"Regulations on the Administration of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances,\" \"Regulations on the Administration of Precursor Chemicals for Illicit Drug Production,\" and \"Regulations on Detoxification,\" which provide a basis for administrative management in drug control. The \"Regulations on the Management of Entertainment Venues\" and \"Regulations on Detention Centers\" specify the responsibilities related to drug control. In 2015, the \"Measures for the Administration of Non-Medical Use of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances\" were introduced, which promptly include addictive substances susceptible to widespread abuse in the controlled substances list. China has currently classified 449 types of narcotic drugs and psychotropic drugs, as well as entire classes of fentanyl-like substances and synthetic cannabinoids. Additionally, 38 precursor chemicals used in illicit drug production are also regulated (including one ephedrine substance).\n\nIv. Comprehensive Advancement of Drug Control.âFirst, we strengthen key targeted efforts. We regard focusing on key areas with severe drug problems as a powerful tool to reinforce the responsibilities of governments in drug control. We establish clear hierarchies and provide classification-based guidance. We pragmatically implement measures such as targeted rectification, public notifications, and focused attention. As a result, drug problems in 134 areas (county-level) have been effectively addressed.âSecond, we carry out drug control demonstration and creation. We consider the creation of drug control demonstration cities as an important means to leverage the advantages of local governance and enhance the level of drug control at the city level. More than 200 cities participated in two batches of demonstration activities, and the first batch of 41 national drug control demonstration cities were named. This establishes a group of exemplary cases for drug control, creates a series of replicable, adaptable, and scalable experiences, and promotes theoretical and practical innovations in drug control work.âThird, we organize drug control efforts in poverty alleviation.We issued the \"Opinions on Winning the Battle against Drugs and Poverty Alleviation\" and implemented targeted drug control measures based on the list of impoverished individuals affected by drugs. We strive for precision in poverty alleviation, provide strong rehabilitation and support for individuals who fell into poverty due to drug abuse, achieve detoxification and poverty alleviation, and provide categorized assistance and employment guidance for drug trafficking-related impoverished individuals upon their release from custody. By addressing the root causes of drug-related poverty, we continue to promote specialized drug control efforts in rural areas, focus on key challenges in \"one hundred counties and one thousand villages,\" and contribute to the comprehensive development of rural revitalization.âFourth, we conduct nationwide surveys on public satisfaction with drug control work. Two national surveys on public satisfaction with drug control work were conducted in 2020 and 2021, achieving positive results. By understanding the subjective evaluation of the general public regarding drug control work and objectively verifying the effectiveness of various measures, we assist in scientific decision-making and the construction of a drug control system with Chinese characteristics in the new era. This further promotes high-quality development of drug control work in the new era.\n\nV. Deepening Drug Prevention and Public Education.âFirst, we conduct nationwide drug prevention campaigns. We have formulated and implemented the \"Guiding Opinions on Strengthening Drug Prevention and Education for the Whole Society in the New Era,\" establishing a comprehensive drug prevention education system for the entire population. Drug prevention education is incorporated into the important content of citizen morality, law, popular science, and health education. It is also included in the teaching syllabus of administrative colleges at all levels, as well as in the training programs for government officials. We carefully organize theme activities such as \"National Drug Prevention Month,\" \"Mobile Drug Prevention Classroom,\" and \"Bringing Drug Prevention to Grassroots,\" creating a strong atmosphere of \"healthy life, free from drugs\" throughout society.âSecond, we implement youth drug prevention education programs. We improve the integrated education mechanism among schools, families, and communities, accelerate the construction of digital platforms for youth drug prevention education, and continue to implement the \"Caring Project\" of establishing drug-free book corners in schools in remote and impoverished areas. We regularly organize themed activities such as youth drug prevention knowledge competitions and debates, conduct specialized drug prevention education for students at the beginning of the school year, optimize the construction and application of the national digital platform for youth drug prevention education, and strive to create drug-free campuses and prevent students from using drugs.âThird, we create integrated media for drug prevention campaigns. We actively adapt to the characteristics of new media communication and establish new media platforms such as WeChat and Weibo for drug prevention. We build the LIN Zexu Drug Prevention Education Base and various drug prevention platforms, vigorously promote the social \"positive energy\" of taking pride in rejecting drugs, and resolutely prevent the spread of drug-related \"subcultures.\"\n\n(Note: Mr. LIN Zexu was a prominent Chinese official known for his efforts to combat the opium trade in the 19th century.)\n\nIV. Continuously Improving Drug Control Technology.âSince its establishment in 2008, the National Anti-Drug Laboratory has been dedicated to research on drug inspection and identification, monitoring and early warning, and hazard assessment technologies. It has achieved significant research results in areas such as the construction of drug sample libraries and databases, drug characteristic analysis and correlation identification, synthesis of drug standard substances, monitoring of drug abuse trends, identification of new psychoactive substances, and addiction and harm assessment of drugs. It has accumulated abundant technical experience. In 2019, the construction of regional sub-centers of the National Anti-Drug Laboratory was initiated. On June 22, 2021, the five regional sub-centers in Beijing, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Sichuan, and Shaanxi were all completed and put into operation. This marked the initial establishment of a \"1+5+N\" drug laboratory technical system in China, with the National Anti-Drug Laboratory as the core, supported by regional sub-centers and leveraging provincial and municipal-level drug laboratories. The system aims to cover the entire country, be closely aligned with practical needs, operate efficiently and effectively, and achieve international first-class standards.Starting from 2022, the National Anti-Drug Laboratory has established a nationwide sewage monitoring network, which detects and analyzes the metabolites of 12 common drugs, including heroin, methamphetamine, and ketamine. It also estimates the scale of drug consumption, providing a scientific basis for accurately understanding the domestic drug abuse situation and objectively evaluating the effectiveness of drug control efforts. The National Anti-Drug Laboratory has currently established characteristic analysis technology systems for common drugs such as heroin, methamphetamine, and tablet drugs. Each year, nearly 10,000 samples of various types of drugs are extracted from drug seizure cases for characteristic analysis. By analyzing and statistically summarizing the chemical and physical characteristics of drugs, it provides intelligence services for drug control policies and law enforcement.\n\nVII. Achievements in Drug Control Enforcement in Recent Years. Key Practices:âFirst, establishing a comprehensive drug control system, including prioritizing the containment of drug penetration from the \"Golden Triangle\" region, enhancing drug control efforts by leveraging the three-dimensional border control system, especially the physical barriers along the 3,300-kilometer border, and Strengthening maritime drug interdiction to prevent drug trafficking from the \"Golden Triangle\" region and transit of South American cocaine.âSecond, crackdown on domestic drug manufacturing, including strengthening control over factors related to drug production, analyzing and assessing key individuals, items, and locations involved in drug manufacturing activities, and improving the capability to detect and disrupt drug manufacturing groups and supply chains.âThird, preventing illegal diversion of precursor chemicals, including establishing a sound legal framework for the control of precursor chemicals used in drug production, timely inclusion of 15 newly identified chemicals that can be used in drug manufacturing into the controlled substance list, and enhancing control and interdiction efforts across the entire supply chain to prevent illegal diversion of precursor chemicals.âFourth, combating drug trafficking activities, including adopting a \"target drug users for investigation, target drug traffickers for investigation\" approach, conducting \"cluster crackdowns\" to dismantle drug trafficking networks and eradicate local drug markets, addressing drug-related activities through online platforms and postal logistics to curb their proliferation, and combating cross-regional large-scale drug trafficking activities, organizing \"Operation Hunt Eagle\" to dismantle drug trafficking networks with regional characteristics.âFifth, preventing the development and manufacturing of new types of drugs, including adopting a multi-pronged approach of prevention, control, and regulation, proactively addressing issues related to new types of drugs, and introducing regulations for the control of new psychoactive substances, classifying fentanyl-related substances and synthetic cannabinoid substances.Currently, China has regulated 449 types of drugs and two categories of substances. Sixth, strengthening international drug enforcement cooperation, including collaborating on drug enforcement operations such as the joint \"Safe Mekong\" operation among six countries in the Mekong River region and the China-Australia \"Flame\" operation, deepening law enforcement cooperation with countries such as Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, and achieving practical results in intelligence sharing, law enforcement investigations, judicial cooperation, and law enforcement training.\n\nAchievements:âfirst, year-on-year reduction in drug-related criminal offenses.In 2022, there were 35,000 drug-related criminal cases solved nationwide, with 53,000 criminal suspects arrested and 21.9 tons of various types of drugs seized.Compared to the peak period in 2015, these figures decreased by 78.8%, 72.7%, and 78.6%, respectively.The average annual reduction rates were 19.1%, 16.7%, and 23.2%, respectively. And there were 197,000 drug users apprehended, representing a 71.5% decrease from the peak period, with an average annual reduction rate of 21.4%.âSecond, significant reduction in drug manufacturing activities.The number of domestic drug manufacturing sites destroyed nationwide decreased from 572 during the peak period in 2013 to 128 in 2022, representing a 77.7% reduction.The average amount of drugs seized per case decreased from 58 kilograms to 1.5 kilograms. And the domestic market share of domestically produced drugs decreased from over 70% during the peak period to less than 10% currently.âThird, significant reduction in the scale of drug smuggling and infiltration from the \"Golden Triangle\" region.In 2022, Yunnan Province, which borders the \"Golden Triangle\" region, solved 3,438 drug-related criminal cases and seized 9.6 tons of various types of drugs. And the number of cases solved was the lowest in 30 years, and the amount of drugs seized was the lowest in 12 years. Fourth, suppression of small-scale drug trafficking activities. In 2022, the number of drug trafficking cases involving quantities of 10 grams or less decreased by 85.5% compared to 2013.\n\nVIII. \"Clean Source and Cut off Flow\" work and its effectiveness.To effectively respond to the changing drug situation in China and address the domestic drug issue, the NNCC and the Ministry of Public Security of China have organized the \"Clean Source and Cut off Flow\" operation nationwide for three consecutive years since 2020. This initiative aims to strengthen the prevention of drug infiltration from the \"Golden Triangle\" region, eliminate drug-related risks, crack down on drug-related crimes, and sustain the positive trend in China's drug situation.âFirstly, efforts have been made to deepen the \"Clean Borders\" operation, improve the inspection and interception system, and establish a comprehensive control network in the Yunnan border region to effectively cut off the circulation channels of drugs. The construction of maritime interception mechanisms has been strengthened to effectively intercept drug smuggling through the sea.âSecondly, extensive actions such as \"Ice and Drug Eradication,\" \"Cluster Crackdown,\" and \"Drug Control in Postal and Logistics Services\" have been carried out, with a focus on key law enforcement areas to severely combat domestic drug production and trafficking activities.âThirdly, enhanced investigation and control measures have been implemented to reduce the harm caused by drug abuse. Increased efforts have been made in promoting drug prevention education in entertainment venues and among young people. Actions such as the \"Safe and Caring\" campaign have been implemented to provide support services for drug users. Measures have been strengthened to combat drug-impaired driving and reduce the social harm caused by drugs.\n\nIX. Practices and Effectiveness of Drug Addiction Treatment and Rehabilitation.Adhering to the principles of people-oriented approach, scientific drug rehabilitation, comprehensive correction, and compassionate assistance, China has implemented a registration system for drug users and provided service through classification and grading. These efforts aim to help drug users overcome addiction, restore their health, and reintegrate into society. By 2022, the number of drug users in China has been declining for six consecutive years, while the number of drug users who have remained abstinent for three years has been increasing for 12 consecutive years.âFirstly, there has been a comprehensive promotion of the \"Safe and Caring\" campaign for drug users. Drug control departments at all levels nationwide adhere to the principle of \"tailored strategies and comprehensive assistance\" to provide support and assistance to over two million drug users and their families.âSecondly, community-based drug rehabilitation and community recovery programs have been extensively implemented. Drug users who meet the criteria are required by law to participate in community-based drug rehabilitation and recovery programs. These programs comprehensively implement drug addiction treatment, rehabilitation guidance, employment support, and assistance services, thus improving the level of service management for drug users.âThirdly, compulsory isolation and rehabilitation for drug addiction are carried out based on scientific approaches. For drug users with severe addiction who cannot quit through community-based rehabilitation, compulsory isolation and rehabilitation are ordered by law. Measures such as physiological detoxification, medical diagnosis and treatment, physical rehabilitation, anti-relapse training, legal and drug prevention education, psychological correction, and vocational skills training are provided to help drug users overcome addiction and reintegrate into society.âFourthly, voluntary drug rehabilitation is encouraged. China encourages drug users to voluntarily seek treatment at drug rehabilitation medical institutions, and their previous drug use behavior is not punished. For opiate addicts, they can participate in methadone maintenance treatment.âFifthly, risk assessment and prevention measures are implemented. A comprehensive understanding of the current situation and drug contamination level of drug users is obtained, and risk assessments are conducted. Extensive investigations are carried out in venues prone to drug use, key industries, and sectors related to public safety. Timely actions are taken to address drug-related violations and eliminate risks of accidents or incidents caused by drug use.\n\nX. Strengthening Supervision of Controlled Precursor Chemicals.âFirstly, control of precursor chemicals used in drug manufacturing is emphasized. Currently, China has listed 38 types of controlled precursor chemicals (including a category of ephedrine substances), surpassing the 14 varieties regulated by the United Nations. Multiple departments work together to establish a comprehensive and dynamic supervision mechanism for all stages of precursor chemical management. In November 2020, the national online reporting and management system for precursor chemicals was officially launched, providing convenient services for enterprises and guiding them to carry out production and business activities in compliance with the law, thereby regulating the industry.âSecondly, active adherence to international conventions is ensured. China joined the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances in October 1989. It is one of the strictest countries in the world in terms of implementing this convention. China strictly fulfills obligations related to controlling precursor chemicals, international inspections, and reporting data specified by the convention. Multiple domestically regulated substances have been added to the international controlled substance list. In accordance with international conventions and domestic regulations, notifications for the export of internationally controlled substances, as well as substances internationally uncontrolled but domestically regulated, are sent through the PEN and PENLIGHT systems. Since 2018, a total of 18,387 inspections involving 17.9 million tons have been conducted, preventing 424 cases involving 450,000 tons.âThirdly, the classification-based control measures and effectiveness for fentanyl-like substances are implemented. On May 1, 2019, the Chinese government innovatively implemented classification-based control of fentanyl-like substances and adopted a series of effective measures to combat their illegal production, trafficking, and abuse. This has played an important role in preventing the illegal production, trafficking, and abuse of such substances. The control of fentanyl-like substances represents an unprecedented practice in China's drug control regulations and is a concrete manifestation of China's commitment to global drug control. It has received full recognition from the international community. Since China implemented the classification-based control of fentanyl-like substances, no reports have been received from other countries regarding the seizure of such substances originating from China.\n\nXI. Actively Promoting International Cooperation in Drug Control.China has signed over 50 government-to-government and inter-agency drug control cooperation agreements with more than 30 countries and international organizations. Annual meetings have been established with 13 countries, and China has joined five multilateral drug control mechanisms, including the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Thirteen border drug control liaison offices have been set up with neighboring countries. Regular communication and coordination, exchange of drug-related intelligence and case cooperation, sharing of experiences and best practices in drug control, and technical exchanges are conducted with dozens of countries, continuously deepening comprehensive and trust-based cooperation in the field of drug control with other nations.Particularly in the field of law enforcement, efforts have been made to promote the establishment of drug law enforcement cooperation brands such as the \"Safe Passage of the Mekong River,\" China-Australia \"Flame,\" China-Cambodia, and China-Vietnam joint anti-drug operations. In recent years, more than 800 transnational and cross-border drug trafficking cases have been successfully solved jointly, effectively safeguarding social security and stability."
