        "text": "Extracts: Lin Zexu – Just Say No!\n\nAnna Chen wrote and produced The Steampunk Opium Wars which premiered at the Royal National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, 16 February 2012. Here are some extracts from the show …\n\nBritain loves its Chinoiserie\n\nTHE NARRATOR – ANNA: It was a dark and stormy night in the history of the British Empire.\n\nEver since Queen Elizabeth I had granted a charter to the East India Company to trade with the East it had been a bumpy ride.\n\nSure, things looked pretty cool for a while when we liked the silks,\n\nwhen we liked the porcelain with the pretty willow-pattern,\n\nwhen we built pagodas in Kew Gardens in admiration\n\nwhen we liked the taste of the spices and taste of the tea.\n\nAnd we liked the Chinese people (English applaud) and the way they grew the tea.\n\nAnd it was all smiles and chinoiserie.\n\nBut it didn’t come for free.\n\nWe ate the spices, and we drank the tea.\n\nWe drank the tea and we drank the tea in the pretty porcelain chinoiserie.\n\nWhy not? It was nice. And so was the spice.\n\nBut it came at a price.\n\nWe drank the tea and we paid for the tea\n\nAnd we paid so much\n\nIt drained the treasury\n\nAll that gold bullion nearly gone.\n\nSomething had to be done.\n\n(Enter LORD PALMERSTON and SIR JARDINE-MATHESON )\n\nHer Majesty’s government heeded the call\n\nScratched their heads, polished their balls\n\nAnd looked for something covetable to trade\n\nA barter instead of a straight purchase had to be made.\n\nBut they didn’t want our clockwork toys\n\nOur cheap alloys\n\nNixed our chunky ceramics\n\nFound our wool too coarse compared with their silk\n\nCouldn’t drink milk, so dairy was out.\n\nWhat’s a government to do?\n\nParliament needs a silver service\n\nBRITISH GOVERNMENT (LORD PALMERSTON): Much more of this and we’re broke. We have nothing the Chinese want and the balance of trade is alarming. Anyone have any bright ideas?\n\nANNA: Stand up the East India Company.\n\nSIR JM: We can grow the tea ourselves. Why pay the Chinese when we can nick the seeds and cultivate it in our back garden. Otherwise known as India.\n\nLORD P: Yes, yes, that’s good. But we need something right now. What else?\n\nSIR JARDINE MATHESON: Well, I’m not sure you’ll like this …\n\nLORD P: No, go on. We’re desperate.\n\nSIR JM: Me and the boys in the East India Company have been gardening. Poppies to be precise.\n\nLORD P: I want ideas and you bring me flowers?\n\nSIR JM: Didn’t you like the roses I sent you? We haven’t been growing just any old flowers.\n\nPoppies. Opium, to be exact. It’s a bit like crack. Only prettier. And bloody cheap.\n\nWe’ve been slipping it over the sea into China to pay for the tea and it’s working a treat.\n\n(Rubs hands with glee)\n\nANNA: The British East India Company: never knowingly undersold.\n\nSince 1757, the East India Company had been granted the monopoly\n\non growing opium poppies in Bengal.\n\nUsed in medicine to keep you healthy,\n\nSmoked for pleasure by the wealthy,\n\nOpium wasn’t very common at all.\n\nWith British mass production that all changed.\n\nIt widened the range of the customer base\n\nIt turned an aristocratic vice into a mass addiction\n\nAnd targeted an entire race with a deadly affliction.\n\nWhat sparked it?\n\nThere aren’t many commodities that create their own market.\n\nSIR JM: POEM The Case for Free Trade (by Paul Anderson) persuading Lord P to send in navy and use military force to make China accept opium.\n\nLORD P: (To Sir JM) Thank you so much for the assistance and information so handsomely afforded us, Sir Jardine-Matheson, leading to so satisfactory an outcome.\n\nIt will form an epoch in the progress of the civilisation of the human races. Not to mention the most important advantages to the commercial interests of England.\n\nANNA: Sir Jardine-Matheson, aren’t you and the East India Company just drug dealers?\n\nSIR JM: Madam, this is business. The opium trade is the safest and most gentlemanlike speculation I am aware of.\n\nANNA: So not tacky, then? A little bit squalid?\n\nSIR JM: “Squalid”? Opium is the world’s most valuable single commodity trade of the 19th century. It will make me an MP. It will make me a man of property. It will buy me an island in the Hebrides. It will allow me to do as I please.\n\nANNA: So, let me get this straight:\n\nto pay for our silks and tea,\n\nyou’re selling opium to the Chinese\n\nwho don’t want it because opium addiction is a terrible disease.\n\nSIR JM: This “disease” is the hub of British trade in the East. It will even gain us a Hong Kong lease. As much as we can seize,\n\nANNA: The East India Company grew the opium, it processed the opium, it took the opium to depot hulks permanently moored offshore where it was sold to Chinese smugglers who then distributed it inside China.\n\nWith the end of the East India Company’s trade monopoly in 1834, all the narco-capitalists fought for a piece of the action. The East India Company’s role morphed into the biggest narco-capitalists yet: Jardine Matheson, still around today.\n\nJardine Matheson rapidly expanded their opium interests and forced open the Chinese market. From fifteen tons in 1730, opium trafficking expanded two hundred-fold to two thousand five hundred tons in 1838.\n\nThe haemmorhaging of silver from the Chinese coffers to pay for their drug habit was unsustainable. The Qing Imperial government had had enough. It decided to enforce the ban on opium and sent Commissioner Lin Zexu to the port of Canton stop it.\n\nGovernor Lin Zexu just says no!\n\nLIN ZEXU: Freeze. You need to cease.\n\nWhat are you, a herd of beasts?\n\nNo, no no, kids. Just say no!\n\nANNA: Governor General Lin Zexu. What are you doing here?\n\nLIN: The Emperor sent me. Looks like I got here just in time.\n\n(To audience) What have they been giving you. I’ve seen those foil wraps. What’s in it?\n\n(Grabs Queen Vic’s East India Company carrier-bag and looks in it)\n\nQUEEN VICTORIA: It’s only chocolate.\n\nLIN: “Only chocolate”? Yeah, pull the other one. (Undoes a wrap and tastes a bit.) Ooh, it is. Yes, but laced with what, I wonder. Bloody East India Company. Nothing but a lot of drug-running bastards.\n\nSIR JM: Harrumph! East India Company, fine fellows. Wonderful horticulturalists. Green fingers. Very good at growing things.\n\nANNA: (To Lin) So what have you got against an exciting money-making venture? It’s only satisfying a market.\n\nLIN ZEXU: Only satisfying a market? What idiot says that?\n\nANNA: Well, that’s what they say\n\n(Lord P & Sir JM) — and it says so here.\n\n(Waves Lovell’s The Opium Wars) You lot were already junkies, weren’t you?\n\nLIN ZEXU: (Snatches book and discards it) Do you believe EVERYTHING you read? You were only only a junkie if you had more money that sense. People who had to work all day in the paddy fields couldn’t afford it.\n\nIt wasn’t until HE (indicates Sir Jardine-Matheson) and his lot and the East India Company started growing the cheap stuff by the ton in Bengal that it started to be anything more than a posh vice. Suddenly, every Chen, Wong and Chan were doing it.\n\nANNA: By 1839 British merchants were smuggling one thousand four hundred tons of opium into China.\n\nSIR JM: Steady on, chappie. It’s only a little bit of fun. You can’t stop progress, you know. The march of history.\n\n(Music)\n\nLin Zexu sprinkles it with lime and throws it in the sea\n\nLIN ZEXU: It was illegal.\n\nIt was evil.\n\nIt was immoral.\n\nIt was Sodom and Gommorral.\n\n(Appealing to audience)\n\nLook!\n\nUse your head,\n\nUse your smarts.\n\nWould you trust these guys?\n\nWould you buy a used cart?\n\nHow can you justify\n\nA junkie-making enterprise\n\nThe object of the exercise\n\nIs making them rich.\n\nThey sound like fakers\n\nThey look like undertakers\n\nThey won’t be happy\n\nTil we’re dying in a ditch\n\nTreating us like mugs\n\nSelling us their drugs\n\nCosting us a fortune\n\nTill we haven’t got a stitch\n\nLORD PALMERSTON: (Mocking) So, there you have it — the voice of authority\n\nLIN: You think it’s fun? Smacked-up off your trolley?\n\nSpending all your lolly on dreaming with the dead?\n\nIt’s OK you lot spicing up your life\n\nThe poppy costs a packet and it messes up your head\n\nWait til you’ve been on opium for a while.\n\nIt feels like hours but it’s longer by a mile\n\nDays and weeks pass. And it bloody-well shows.\n\nGive it a month, you’ll lose your glow\n\nLose your glamour, lose your zing\n\nYour skin all puckers. You start to ming\n\nYour teeth fall out\n\nAnd then your hair\n\nNo-one will look at you,\n\nThey wouldn’t bloody dare\n\nALL: No-one will look at you,\n\nThey wouldn’t bloody dare.\n\nQUEEN VICTORIA: It never did me any harm.\n\nLIN ZEXU: Yeah, not much of an advert, are you, Queenie?\n\nWhat’s the time?\n\nEighteen thirty-nine.\n\nLORD P, SIR JM, QUEEN VIC: China is in a bit of a decline\n\nLIN: Yes, I know we’re past our prime\n\nYou’re not exactly giving us a chance to shine\n\nThat’s no excuse\n\nFor all this abuse\n\nHand me your drugs\n\nI want your poppy juice.\n\nDeliver all your drugs to me\n\nI’ll sprinkle it with lime\n\nAnd throw it in the sea.\n\nALL: He’ll sprinkle it with lime\n\nAnd throw it in the sea.\n\nANNA: In 1839 Lin Zexu told the dealers in Canton they had to hand over their opium, all 20,000 chest of it. One and a half tons delivered to him on the dockside. Everyone kicked up.\n\nSIR JM: Do you know how much that costs?\n\nLORD P: Now we’ll have to compensate the merchants.\n\nQUEEN VIC: You’re getting my laudanum over my cold dead body.\n\nLIN: Your Majesty has not before been thus officially notified, and you may plead ignorance of the severity of our laws, but I now give my assurance that we mean to cut this harmful drug forever.\n\nSay no, no, kids, just say no\n\nI’m getting stroppy with the poppy, just say no\n\nLordy, lordy, laudanum\n\nGet your beauty sleep, drink lots of water.\n\nHer Majesty won’t be amused until we’ve fought her\n\nTea Out, Opium In\n\nGetting stroppy with the poppy Lordy, lordy, laudinum\n\nQUEEN VICTORIA: Mr Lin, tell the Emperor that it is a bounty of nature, a gift from God, a medicine which, if taken in tincture form, is most efficiaceous in ailments of the womb. We do not smoke it like the barbarians.\n\nANNA: Actually, it had been the Western sailors who taught the Chinese how to smoke opium.\n\nBritain begins the Opium Wars\n\nLORD P: POEM After Kipling: Apology for the First Opium War by John Crow Constable\n\nSIR JM: (To Lord P) Game’s up. The opium trade is now so very important in England that we cannot be too cautious in keeping as quiet and out of the public eye as possible.\n\nLORD P: I fear you are correct. (Beckons Queen Vic) C’mon, Ma’am, you too. Let’s find you a nice place to lie down. Men, load the cannon! We’re off to war.\n\n(The men exit followed by Queen Victoria.)\n\nLIN ZEXU: Hey, Your Majesty. Wait, I haven’t finished. Just a minute. (Follows her off)\n\nWilliam Gladstone and Richard Cobden speak up\n\n(In Parliament, a vigorous debate took place, William Gladstone and the Radical Richard Cobden opposing the Opium Wars.)\n\n(Enter CAPTAIN IRONSIDE SL and MR COBSTONE SR.)\n\nMR COBSTONE: A war more unjust in its origins in its origins, a war more calculated in its origins, a war more calculated in its progress to cover this country in disgrace, I do not know and have not read of. The flag is being hoisted to protect a notorious contraband traffic. It is the Chinese, supposedly the pagans and semi-barbarians, who are righteous in this instance whilst we, the enlightened and civilised Christians, are pursuing objects at variance with both justice and religion.\n\nANNA: In late 1839, Her Majesty’s government dispatched the troops and the navy.\n\nAfter a sea voyage halfway across the world, the fleet of British warships finally arrived in the spring of 1840.\n\nQuite a long way to go for a ruck.\n\nIn the defining example of gunboat diplomacy,\n\nthey sent the warships up the Yangtse,\n\na painful condition … which cut off the Qing Empire’s tax income.\n\nThey bombarded the coastal towns with heavy artillery resulting in a devastating loss of Chinese life.\n\n(MUSIC: Atmos intro)\n\nLX: Fade down lights, except for Captain Ironside\n\nCAPTAIN IRONSIDE: When we captured the port of Jinhai, we fired 15 broadsides in a few minutes into the defenceless town. The crashing of timber, falling houses and groans of men resounded from the shore … a more complete pillage could not be conceived. The rape and plunder only ceased when there was nothing more to take or destroy. Two thousand Chinese died that day.\n\nOur losses? Three men in all. The yellow men had no chance against our superior weaponry.\n\nWe had the Wellesley with 74 guns; the Conway and the Alligator, each with 28 guns; the Cruiser and the Algerine with 36 guns between ‘em, and a dozen more vessels all armed and highly dangerous.\n\nD’ye know what that adds up to?\n\nVictory for us. Defeat for our enemy.\n\nBut do you know something else? The buggers would not give up. They resorted to dirty tactics. Native tricks such as the ambush. However, our men had the fortitude of lions, not to mention state of the art technology.\n\nMind you, we nearly suffered a crushing defeat at Sanyuanli,\n\njust north of Canton, from the massed peasant militia.\n\nIt was the timidity and cowardice of the Qing army that saved our bacon.\n\nAs a result of this and our brave endeavours, British opium ships began to gather once more."
