Founded in 1857 by the Society of the Daughters of the Heart of Mary (DHM), Nardin Academy is a private, independent, Catholic academy with three unique schools: a co-ed Montessori, a co-ed elementary, and a college preparatory school for young women.

Across the academy, we strive to fulfill both our mission and the three pillars of our strategic plan: maximize student potential, engage students with the world, and enrich Nardin community life.
