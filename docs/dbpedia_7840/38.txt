Nardin Academy is a private, independent Catholic high school in the heart of Buffalo, NY. The Academy has three schools: high school for young women (grades 9-12), lower and middle schools for boys and girls (K-8) and Montessori school with programs for toddlers through 3rd graders. In 1857, Nardin Academy was founded by the Daughters of the Heart of Mary, a society of religious women, as the first Catholic free school in the Diocese of Buffalo. Today we continue their tradition of providing a strong, value-centered Catholic education in a close-knit community, while also creating new traditionsâ€”maximizing our use of and access to appropriate technological advances, while staying connected with far-flung alums, family and friends. Every day, you find an energetic and enthusiastic student body, aged 18 months to 18 years, developing a love of learning in an atmosphere designed to enhance the body, mind and spirit.
