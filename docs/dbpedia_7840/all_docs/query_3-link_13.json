We also hold several liturgical services throughout the year, including our Thanksgiving interfaith prayer service, Lessons and Carols, Advent Prayer Services, and Reconciliation Services during Lent. Students take primary roles in both liturgy and music ministry.\n\nRetreats\n\nEach student at Nardin has the opportunity to attend a retreat every year they attend Nardin. Each retreat is student-led by seniors and allows each student to pause, reflect, and grow. The sequence of retreats is highlighted below:\n\nFreshman Retreat\n\nThe Freshman Retreat is a class retreat that encourages students to reflect on their first year at Nardin, paying particular attention to the relationships in their life.\n\nSophomore Retreat\n\nThe Sophomore Retreat is a class retreat centered around the Gospel story of the Two Foundations (Matthew 7: 24-29). Students reflect honestly about the “foundations” in their life\n\nKairos\n\nThe Kairos retreat has a long history in Catholic high schools and colleges. Kairos is new to Nardin and is offered to juniors three times a year. Kairos is a three-day, two-night retreat based on the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius Loyola. On Kairos, students will reflect on their relationships with others, self, and God. The retreat also challenges students to heed the call to servant leadership.\n\nSenior “Portrait of a Graduate” Capstone\n\nThis unique, individual retreat allows students to reflect on their time here at Nardin in the context of traits of the “Portrait of a Graduate.” Each student creates a 10-15 minute presentation based on their reflection and presents to their classmates in their religion classes.\n\nAny questions can be directed to Tom Whalen, the Director of Campus Ministry, at twhalen@nardin.org"
