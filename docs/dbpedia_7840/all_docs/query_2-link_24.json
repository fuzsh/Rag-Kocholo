        "text": "Welcome to the Lower School at Nardin Academy! The early years of a child’s life holds great significance for who they aspire to be. Our focus for each child is to instill a love of learning, an understanding of oneself, to develop strong morals and values, and grow in independence and self-confidence to accomplish all they can as they contribute to our global community.\n\nOur school environment strives to provide a child the opportunity to explore, investigate, and make connections across their learning. Their educational experience should be experiential within a supportive, academically inspiring, and respectful environment that meets the needs and readiness of each individual child. There is not a “one size fits all” approach when it comes to teaching and our highly skilled and compassionate educators understand the depth of that.\n\nNardin’s Lower School will provide for your child an atmosphere where learning is exciting, challenging oneself is encouraged, and feeling secure and confident in exploring one’s own interests and abilities is always welcome!\n\nWarm regards,"
