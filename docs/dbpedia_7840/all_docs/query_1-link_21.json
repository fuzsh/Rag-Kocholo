        "text": "By Mark Scott\n\nBuffalo, NY – For the first time, Business First newspaper is ranking the area's private schools. It's been publishing similar rankings for public schools for several years now.\n\nNardin Academy ranked as the area's top private high school, followed by Holy Angels, Sacred Heart, Mount St. Mary's and St. Joseph's Collegiate Institute. Schools such as Canisius High School, Nichols and the Park School were not included because they don't participate in statewide testing.\n\nNardin Principal Rebecca Reeder attributes part of the reason for the school's success to the fact more than 98 percent of students received a Regents diploma in 2000.\n\n\"We not only teach for the Regents exams, but we teach beyond them,\" Reeder said. \"It's a standard, but we don't consider it the highest standard.\"\n\n\"Our focus is strictly college prep,\" she continued. \"Our students are aware that they need to do well to show themselves in a good light. They are very driven.\"\n\nBusiness First also ranked private elementary schools. The Kadimah School of Buffalo's two campuses were in the top three. The middle school ranked number one, while the lower school campus came in at number three.\n\n\"The education here is top-notch, and our kids are expected to work really hard,\" Headmaster Mark Stolovitsky said.\n\nSandwiched between the two Kadimah Schools was Nativity of our Lord School in Orchard Park.\n\nBUSINESS FIRST'S PRIVATE HIGH SCHOOL RANKINGS\n\nTop 10 schools: 1.
