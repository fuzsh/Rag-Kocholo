I went there in 1943 and have included my experience there in a book I have recently written about growing up in Buffalo. Every time I try to bring it up on computer it always shows Niagara County or Lewiston. The elementary school I'm referring to was definitely on Washington Street near St. Michael's Church. Anyone alive today in Buffalo who went to that school in the 1940s? Where can I find a picture of it? I wonder if there is anyone in Buffalo today who was in my class in 1943. TommyTo \"Old Timer.\" I attended School #30 from 1968 to 1971. It was demolished in 1976 and an M&T Bank now occupies the space. I remember that the demolishing of the building was featured in the former Courier Express, and it showed a photo of the fancy archway over the front entrance which was the last part of the structure to come down. Did you have a teacher named Mrs. Keller? I also remember Ms. Kroll. She had this antique regulator clock in her office, and it must have been an original fixture when the school was built in 1895.I am looking for a 8th grade class picture from school 79 on lawn ave, for the year 1963. Does anyone have one that I could get a copy? I have searched every where for mine and had no luck..Does anyone remember a PS on East Delavan, near Cambridge, Wyoming or maybe Moselle? Pretty sure it's gone, but I can't for the life of me remember the number of it - my sister went there in the late 1960s (the rest of us went toe Saint Matthews). There are two schools missing that I know of. I went both. School 85 on edison st is missing. I was looking to find an old teacher. A miss swanick 4th grade. An school 82 is also missing.

Seventh and eighth grades were spent as a \"crossing guard\" at PS 82 near Cortland and Suffolk Ave. For a short while (1961-63) I attended Kensington High School but left for the mid-west (Missouri). I particularly remember a little store on the corner of Roslyn and Lang where we would stop and return found pop bottles and buy \"penny candy\" after school.\n\nGreat site! Thanks. I attended 5 elementary and high schools while growing up in Buffalo: I graduated Cardinal Dougherty HS 1975, where I spent my junior & senior year. Before that, St. Joes (2 years, didn't quite fit in there), PS 81 (5th through 8th), PS 21 (1st through 4th) and Holy Angels Parish on Porter and West for Kindergarten. Had some GREAT teachers and I credit my Buffalo education for all I've accomplished in life - but the ones that stand out are Brother John Shinsky (CDHS, History), Mr. Joe Chaya (St Joe's, Freshman Dean), Miss Meyers (PS 21, 3rd and 4th Grade) and Mrs. McKenna (PS 21, first grade). I left Buffalo in 1979 to join the USAF but Buffalo has never left me. I get back as often as I can and I wish you all the best!AT MAX I WENT TO SCHOOL # ONE TOO AND THERE IS NO RECORDS OR PIC OF THE SCHOOL AND OF THE RECORDS THAT WE ATTENDED THERE..SO I GUESS WE WENT STIAGHT TO HIGH SCHOOL CAUSE THE GRAMMER RECORDS ARE GONE Does anyone out there have a class photo of the kindergarten class of 1956 Public School #1 that was on Hudson and Busti Street.

Thanks\n\nMaxCan anyone help me with the PS # for the school on Rother Ave. near Walden that burned to the ground around 1963. I believe it was 57 but can't confirm that. I graduated PS #9 in 1955 and Seneca in 1959. Any photo's of #9 or #57 available? Hi Dave Q, I'm still playing trumpet at 70.I am looking for a copy of a photo of a former public school #21 that was located at 1000 Hertel avenue(near Delware Ave. I graduated back in 1962 but it was torn down maybe in the 80's then a fays drug store was put in. I know work at 1000 hertel avenue at Child Care Resouse network, and would like a photo of the school. Can you help me out, I checked with the Buffalo Rocket and I Thought they printed a photo of it before it came down. They wouldn't look that far back for me. Only thing I have is a photo of our class on the front lawn not showing the school that much.Funny thing how things \"come around\". Graduated from PS 21, teachers I remember are Mrs. Axelrod, Mrs. Valente, Mrs Waterbury - loved her geography classes and the stories she read to us, Mrs Brown in Music class - couldn't sing a note so she told me to just move my lips at graduation. Well - the building is down and a new one is up....and my twin sister is now back on the site working in the new building.Why no picture of PS37 on Carlton Street between Orange and Peach Streets, the old Fruit\n\nBelt, Buffalo, NY. The building is still there, probably under another name, but PS37 is still marked in the stonework. I graduated from 8th grade in June 1948 and wondered if there were any records listing the names and pictures of the 1948 classmates.\n\nGUESTPS#21. I which there was a picture, and a picture of that gym equipment and the red velvet stage curtain. In 1969,some teachers included A. Navarro, B. Meyers, Mrs. Slayback, Mrs. Ethel Henshaw,Mrs.Wiseburg. Somebody help me out here!I'm looking for a classmate, Kathy J. I've been gone from Buffalo 33 years, but still remember some things from that school so clearly.Lincoln School PS#44 still stands amongst the ruins of the east side on Broadway. A wonderful school I attended from 1965-1970; when Malecki's Meats & Paner's Store still stood across the street. A great era to grow up on the school playground & Lincoln Gym/playground. Baseball on \"Rockyfeller\" field across from the fire station further down Broadway, street hockey on Person St., sledding & ice hockey in the fields @ Schlenker st...Giza Delicatessen & Kaminski's store for a bottle of RC or Pepsi....A special time.....I have found a class ring to Fosdick Masten Vocational school class of 1963.

School #59 was demolished as was St Mary Magdalene School on Fillmore Ave. Both gone. I also went to 59 for kindergarten and then to St Mary Magdalene up to 7th grade in 1969. That whole area is like a war zone. So many buildings and homes are gone.Whatever happenned to PS 47 on Pratt Street? MY brothers and I went there between the years 1945-1955 (that may be ancient to some of you). There was a music teachr there named Mr. Scott. Doe anyone remember him? He wrote a song called \"Ours is the World.\" It's an excellent song and I would like to post it in our school's newspaper. I need Mr. Scotts's first name. If anyone remembers him and knows his first name, please leave a comment. ThanksMy sister and I were just talking about our grammar school #71 on Newburgh Ave and what a great a school it was. The interior was so nice and well cared for. There was even a courtyard garden in the center. We were there in the late 50's and early 60's. So many good memories. If there are any publications or sites with interior photos I would love\n\nto know about them.girls vocational schools give the quality based education to the learners.

I attended #30 from 69-74 when my parents moved to Clarence. It was later torn down and an M&T bank is now there. I didnt see anyone mention this school and when I look up PS#30 I am directed to a school that still exists. If anyone remebers this school and has a photo of it I would love to see it Where is PS #21, How about a photo.its has been torn down, but it was part of North Buffalo.I grad. in '62,we had the largest class and 5 sets of twins,(I'm one of the). Went on to Riverside HS and grad in '66.(grad with 9 sets of twins)Had the greatest football team back in '62-66. Go Frontiers.(#21 was at 1000 Hertel ave, I know work\n\non the site of 1000 Hertel Ave- I came my full circle.)There are two more elementay schools that are missing. May have been demolished or converted before these historical school photos were taken?? In the very early 1940's I attended school PS 48 which was located on Edna Pl. between Masten Ave. and Michigan Ave. The other school was PS 39 which was located on High St. about 2-3 blocks West from where High St. intersected Genessee St.No one has mentioned School 59....I only went to Kindergarten there...and then went on to St. Mary Magdalene....but I would love to see a picture of it. I seem to remember it being on Glenwood Avenue..off of FillmoreI attended Campus North. PS #63 and I just recently took a drive by to show my children where Mommy went to school. It is no longer open which is sad, but just seeing the building helps the memories flood back - Dancing in Mrs. Roseanne Giganti's ballroom classes, doing plays and drama with Frank Cecala- not to mention that his English classes are what inspired me t be an English teacher myself!!\n\nHi, I'm Stephanie Bucholtz.\n\nI Attend at Riverside Hoghschool.\n\nIt's a Pretty Natural School.\n\nWell...Now it's being \"Re-modeled\" on my Last year.\n\nSENIORS!! 09\"\n\nHaha.\n\nBut yeah it's cool, I love the people here,\n\nsome of the better Teachers lefted to #51 Black Rock Academy.\n\nThat is also my old school.\n\nHaha,\n\nWell yeah it's cool.MARY MANTELLI- If you didn't know.. I graduated from Mr. Cecala's 8th grade this year. What a small world! He now teaches private school. He always has many stories of school 22. Did he still only use a binder back then? -Quinn ( qrhaggerty94@yahoo.com )I attended PS # 22 from 1965 - 1974. What a great school. Mr. Frank Cecala, the middle school English teacher there, taught us so much about the English language that I never learned another thing in high school or college that he hadn't already taught me. He is the reason that I am a teacher today. My old school is one that has since been converted to apartments, but I still drive by from time to time if I am in Buffalo visiting family. This is a great site - brought back many wonderful memories.K.(Krygier) T. 19-Feb-2008 18:11\n\nMe, my three older brothers, my younger sister, our dad, and my two uncles all went to School 44 (or, \"Lincoln\"). I went there K-8, 1976-1985. We lived a block away on Peck St. We played in the concrete playground in the back. I belonged to the Ranger Rick club that planted the little tree near the door on the right. Bells supermarket was across the street. We moved away from the neighborhood in 1988. I neglected to leave my email addr...benderfox@yahoo.com.\n\nI went to PS 19 from 1965-66. My K teacher was Ms Kruhm and my 1st grade teacher was Miss Fontaine. We moved to Riverside and I went to PS 60, teachers...2nd-Miss Alt, 3rd-Mrs Woods, 4th-Dr. Mart, 5th-Miss Boblak, 6th-Miss Otis. I know this is a long shot, but if these names are recognizable and you attended 1966-71, feel free to contact me. I have lost all my class pics and would like help in replacing them. My name is Alan and I lived on Gallatin Ave. It would be nice to share fond memories. Thank you...benderfox@yahoo.com.I went to PS 19 from 1965-66.

Buffalo Seminary Est. 1851, which is what the 20th Century Club was built for the women alums of this Alma Mater.\n\nThe story of Buffalo Seminary began in 1851 when a group of philanthropic citizens established an all-girls school that ranged from kindergarten through the first two years of college. The school, then called The Buffalo Female Academy, was located in Johnson Cottage near the corner of Delaware Avenue and Johnson Park. In 1889, the school changed its name to Buffalo Seminary and its curriculum was structured to meet the requirements of Smith, Vassar, Wellesley, and other leading colleges for women. Ten years later, Sem began offering courses limited to grades 9 through 12. Hi, I am Judy Jones Middleton and I want to thank you for taking me on a journey that will never be forgotten. Born and raised in Buffalo I will always be proud and will always remember where I came from. So many memories rush back, so many wonderful experiences, so many great people. Ahhhhhh, to go back, just once again.I went to P.S. 16, Delaware Ave., K -8th grade. Graduated 1944 and went to Buffalo Technical High School (all boys). Graduated from the College Prep. course in 1948. Never did go to college though. Tech High was a huge building. It was closed in the late '50s. Good memories.Good old South Buffalo, South Park, Bishop Timon. I graduated in 59. Crystal beach etc. What a tribute to our families, lives and spirit. 998 Broadway. I used to love the Ring Bologna at Sattler's. Such a life in the 40's and 50's, Soooo many memories. Cazenovia park, both swimming and ice skating in the summer.........wow!! Thanks ever so much.I went to Public School 15 on Oak Street near Goodell. It was a very old school built in the early 1800's no doubt. It had wrought iron fences. One yard for the boys and one for the girls. We lined up in the morning and walked single file to our class room while the record player played a marching song. We said our leagence to the flag and a pray every morning. Our 4th grade teacher threw books at us from across the room if we day dreamed. One teacher broke a wooden ruler over my head. I didn't dare tell my parents or I would have gotten it again. We never chewed gum or sat on top of our desks or wore a hat in class. I was in 8th grade in 1940.Where is School #67? I graduated in 1958. Helen O'Rourke was the principal. I can remember we could NEVER walk on the grass; we squared corners like little soldiers. Miss Barnette was my kindergarten teacher, Miss Oswick for math in 7th grade and Miss Wilson for 8th grade. Mrs. Woods made music exciting and I still remember singing many college fight songs in her class. We went from class to class in single file; square danced in gym. As the girls and boys stood in line on each side of the gym, there was great anticipation and counting to see who your partner would be. I remember planting tulip bulbs in pots in the fall, putting them in the ground and digging them up in the spring for Mother's Day. Thanks for this. We left Buffalo in 78, but it feels like yesterday. After spending an afternoon on your site, I'm ready to go back. By the way, what happened to PS 67? I didn't see it on the list.\n\nThanks Again,\n\nMark FisherHey!!! Has anyone gone to South Park High? It's the best Public School Ever!!! The faculty members are great!!! It's so homey at South Park. The people are very kind and accepting. You can find great friends here too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks South Park For EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I went to school 1. My eight grade graduation was in 71. I spent one year at Hutch Tech, then my family left Buffalo. School one, I understand, has since been torn down. That 7th/8th grade staff there was outstanding. Does anyone know how I could get in touch with any of those old teachers and say thank you? (Manishefski[mispelled],Wright[maiden name Brown],Piel,and Soconi)No doubt about it, school #66 was and probably is still a beauty. So many wonderful memories. Mr. Farley was Principal, Mrs. Beck Assistant Principal. That was in the 70's, an older woman was before him, but I can't remember her name. I remember her from when I was in Kindergarten. I was in the first portable classroom on the side of the property, that was in 1st grade. This probably had to be the best time to be a child. I'd love to see photos of School 66. I've heard they are renovating the place, is this true?Where's school #66, North Park Middle Academy? :) That is a beautiful building, set on a beautiful piece of land! When approaching it from Parkside, it looms ahead of you in the distance and is an architectural force to be reckoned with! Maybe I'm biased, because I'm the art teacher there, but I think it makes for great photographs. :)Was surprised to see St. Marys Business School was still standing. Went there from 54 to 56. Any one out there from those years please contact me. Would love to chat with you. I am now in Arizona. Have no family left in NY, but do get back there once in a while. azpettus@hotmail.com This was an amazing opportunity to \"visit' Buffalo while I was sitting at my computer in NJ. I loved seeing my alma mater, South Park. I loved the bars and the shots of Crystal Beach. Thanks, Karl for sharing your work with us. Jackie Held-RubinKarl,\n\nWhether it is your intention or not, you are, by putting together your galleries on Buffalo, creating a remarkable architectural history of your beloved city. Perhaps a worthwhile project for any of us to consider.\n\nCheers,\n\nRichard McDonell"
