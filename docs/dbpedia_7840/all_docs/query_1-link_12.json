        "text": "I canâ€™t express enough how incredible our experience at Nardin Montessori has been. Our son is in his 1st year of the Early Childhood Program and absolutely loves going there. His teachers have all shown a great interest in his progress and we are so grateful for their dedication. We love the weekly emails and parent communication as well as the mantle extra social activities they host for students and parents. We are very happy that our daughter will also be beginning her Nardin journey next Fall."
