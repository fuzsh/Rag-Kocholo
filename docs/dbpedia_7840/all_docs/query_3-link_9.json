        "text": "Students in Grades K - 8 study music theory and the understanding of music concepts with a focus on developing both listening and playing skills.\n\nBeginning in Kindergarten and through 8th grade, Nardin music classes learn to play keyboard from beginning to intermediate to advanced using the Yamaha Music In Education (MIE) program. Sixth graders also learn to play the Recorder.\n\nVoice and singing are an integral part of the music program as well. Students are encouraged to practice and share their talents with classmates, and eventually become a part of singing ensembles and the various shows performed throughout the school year.\n\nOrchestra\n\nThe Elementary Orchestra is comprised of students in Grades 3-8 who play a string, woodwind, or percussion instrument. Collaboration is the key to the success of the orchestra, with younger students benefiting from the expertise of older students during weekly meetings. Members must have reading proficiency. If reading proficiency is lacking, lessons can be provided to help reinforce the reading of music in all styles from classical to pop. Performances take place during the holiday season and throughout the year, including Performing Arts Night.\n\nJunior Choir\n\nJunior Choir is comprised of grades 3 - 5 (including Montessori Grade 3). Auditions take place in early October and students learn confidence and poise during a busy holiday performance schedule in Western New York.\n\nSenior Choir\n\nSenior Choir is comprised of grades 6-8. Auditions take place each October and performance venues include Oishei Childrenâ€™s Hospital Tree Lighting, Roswell Park, and many charitable organizations throughout Western New York.\n\nBroadway Play\n\nGrades 5 - 8 have the opportunity to perform each fall. Auditions occur the first week in September with Grade 8 students assuming responsibility of the lead roles, and Grades 5 - 7 taking part in the ensemble. Past performances include Annie, Beauty and the Beast, High School Musical, and the Music Man.\n\nChristmas Show\n\nEvery year on the last day of school in December, Grades K - 6 participate in a production that includes dancing, singing, and orchestra. This annual tradition gets our community into the holiday spirit and culminates with a live manger scene, reminding us all of the true spirit of Christmas. Montessori students play a significant role in this production as well.\n\nPerforming Arts Night\n\nEach spring, the Middle School and other various grade levels in the Lower School and Montessori perform at 710 Main Street (formerly known as Studio Arena). From orchestra and choir to ethnic dances, this night celebrates world culture.\n\nLiturgical Services\n\nThroughout the year, 8th grade choir members provide liturgical music, leading both mass and prayer services.\n\nAfter School Music Program\n\nPrivate half hour lessons are offered on-site for a fee and all instruments of the orchestra as well as piano, voice, and guitar are offered."
