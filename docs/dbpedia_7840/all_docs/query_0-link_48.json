        "text": "My daughter goes to Nardin Montessory. Finally there is a school that knows how children learn; through play. Everything hands on, no worksheets, she doesn't realize that she is learning. And the results are amazing! Her development is 2 years ahead, she immerses herself in what she learnt at home without the stress of homework, just because she is interested in it. Yes, education is about igniting a fire, not filling a pale.\n\nPosted by a parent on 4/29/2016\n\nNardin is a wonderful school, and my daughter loves it. The teachers all work very hard to make sure each student does as well and they also make the school have a happy atmosphere. Go Gators!\n\nPosted by a parent on 1/26/2014\n\nWe transferred our older child from another private school to Nardin in 6th grade. There was more work and it was much harder, BUT she loves it. She was actually sad in the summer because there was no school! Our younger child attended the Nardin Montessori school and loved it. She made the transition to the Nardin traditional school with no problems and is just thriving there too. For us, it is worth the sacrifice to send our kids here because of the high academic standards and because there is nothing better than seeing your kids enjoying school so much. Sending our kids to Nardin was the best decision for us as parents. The school exceeds our expectations, which are very high!\n\nPosted by a parent on 10/25/2011\n\nvery happy with the school. That being said i should and better be given the tuition has gone up about 50% in the last 7 years.Prospective parents should be warned the board will probably continue to raise the tuition 500 per year per student so what you pay in preschool wont be what youll pay by 4th grade.\n\nPosted by a parent on 3/21/2011"
