This accreditation will last seven years and serves as a guidepost for the Academy to work together through goals focused on the sustainment and betterment of our institution. Likewise, in coordination with this Academy-wide accreditation, our Montessori school was recommended for accreditation after their spring 2022 visit. The American Montessori Society (AMS) board is due to ratify these recommendations later this month. We anticipate another 7 year accreditation from AMS."
