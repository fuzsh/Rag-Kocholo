        "text": "At Nardin Academy, we are committed to the transformative power of an all-girls education at one of the most important stages in a girl’s life. Our high school students benefit from an inspirational environment that empowers them to express themselves freely, speak their minds and find their voice from their first days within our halls.\n\nHere, a girl occupies every role, whether it is in the lab, on the field, in the studio, or at the front of the room. Every opportunity and program fosters self-confidence and leadership skills.\n\nOur community is an empowering one. Extraordinary faculty mentor, advise, teach, and support each student’s individual talents. Nardin students celebrate each other’s successes and are enthusiastically involved in daily life. As our alumnae can proudly attest, the friendships forged within the community last long after graduation.\n\nCombined with the tradition of our founders, the Daughters of the Heart of Mary, the all-girls experience at Nardin not only allows students to recognize their potential, but also to use those gifts and talents to make a difference in our world."
