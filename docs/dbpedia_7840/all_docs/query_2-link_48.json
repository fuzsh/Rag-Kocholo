        "text": "Nardin is a very controversial school. I am currently a student at the school so I know what goes on behind and in front of teacher's eyes. I have heard many things about this school such as the great amount of bullying, terrible teachers, big image and 'snobby rich girls'. All I have to say is that people make everything a lot more than it needs to be. Yes, Nardin has bullying, what school doesn't? Yes, sometimes not all girls like all teachers, there will always be a teacher someone has a problem with. Yes, Nardin has a big image it upholds because why would they WANT to get rid of their image? I'm sure the Nardin staff wakes up and wonders what they should do to earn less money and become less successful. Haha absolutely not, no one does that. Yes, there are rich girls and sometimes they are snobby. There are also snobby less-than-rich girls. (Personally, everyone is a little snobby unless they are perfect angels. We are humans people, not angels). I sit in homeroom a lot and because I am not the extroverted type, I just sit and listen to the many conversations between the girls. I have found that students are constantly complaining about EVERYTHING. I will admit, complaining is a good way to start and continue conversations. Most of these complaints are about Nardin and the terrible teachers/food/girls/homework load and much more that don't come to mind. One day my homeroom teacher listened to these complaints and said something that caught my attention. She explained to the girls that it was unavoidable for Nardin to be overwhelming and terrible. That is simply what high school is. High school IS bad teachers. High school IS loads of homework. Parents can complain about specific high schools all they want and yet no matter how many schools they move their child to, there will always be bad teachers, unfriendly classmates, tons of homework and maybe unappetizing lunches. (You won't find bad lunches at Nardin, just saying.) Nardin is simply another school. I gave most of my opinions about specific things in the other questions, but as a whole, I believe Nardin is a great school to be at. I hope I didn't offend anyone with my opinion. Thanks for reading.\n\nPosted by a student on 7/9/2017\n\nThis school portrays it's self as and all girls school but then they turn around and allow boys to come in the school and mingle with the girls,they want to have it both ways TOTALLY MIS-LEADING.This school has a bully problem and they won't address it for fear it would ruin there so-called perfect image and they'd loose Big Money Donors.My daughters grades dropped 20 points since enrolling in this school and she's barely passing.The teachers are mean to my daughter and to me and totally UNCARING to the point where they made my daughter cry.I've spent a ton of money sending my daughter to this school and it was totally a waste of my MONEY.DEFINETLY NEVER SEND YOUR DAUGHTER HERE.THEY DON'T CARE!!! This school is totally overated with no Morals, they claim there a religous school and a all girls school but guys are constantly in the school harassing the girls and they feel it's perfectly o.k.\n\nPosted by a parent on 3/13/2012"
