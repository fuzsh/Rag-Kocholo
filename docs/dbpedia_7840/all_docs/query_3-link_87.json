        "meta_description": "Watch Genevieve's recruiting video • 2024 • Midfield, Defense • Western New York Flash Girls • ORCHARD PARK, NY • Committed to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) • My name is Genevieve Ricci. I play outside back and defensive mid-field for the Western New York Flash Academy  2006 girls ECNL RL team. As a defensive player I work to create opportunities for our team to move up the field and force chances on net. I am a very positive and encouraging teammate, I am always pushing my teammates to be better and they do the same for me. I am in the class of 2024 and attend Nardin Academy. I have been on the Varsity Soccer team since freshman year playing with and against the best soccer players in the region, I play defensive mid and occasionally attacking wing. Along with soccer I play lacrosse for Nardin and was selected as a team captain. I am looking forward to continue playing at the collegiate level after high school.  I love the game!",
