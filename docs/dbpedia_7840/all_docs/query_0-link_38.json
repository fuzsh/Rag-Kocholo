        "text": "Think Again! At Nardin Academy, it may be a surprise to some, that no student pays 100% of the cost of education. With our generous donors, our endowment fund, and supporting activities like our athletic facility rentals to help fill the gap, every student’s cost of education has already been supplemented by 15%. Nardin Academy offers tuition assistance to qualifying families which adjusts tuition rates to meet your family’s financial position. For more information on Tuition Assistance, please review the FAQs below.\n\nWe are happy to speak with you as you consider an affordable, quality independent Catholic education at Nardin Academy. If you have questions, please call 716-881-6262 x1380 or email Leslie McSpadden, Director of Montessori, Lower and Middle School Admissions, at lmcspadden@nardin.org or call 716-881-6262 x 1030 or email Laura Gill, Director of High School Admissions at lgill@nardin.org.\n\nWhat is Tuition Assistance?\n\nTuition Assistance adjusts tuition rates based on need. This allows families to apply for tuition assistance; thus, making a Nardin Academy education affordable to many qualified students who could not otherwise join our school community.\n\nHow Does Tuition Assistance Work?\n\nAny family (current or new) of a full-time enrolled five year-old through twelfth-grade student may apply for Tuition Assistance if they are concerned about affording the tuition at Nardin Academy. Many factors are considered when determining the tuition amount a family is able to pay, including income, assets, unusual expenses, and size of the family. The resources available for the family in a given year must also be considered in light of the Tuition Assistance awards available at Nardin Academy.\n\nAn application for Tuition Assistance does not affect the re-enrollment or the admission process. Regardless of financial need, parents should initiate the re-enrollment or admission process as early as possible. New families may apply for Tuition Assistance only after they have applied for admission to the school. Re-enrolling students must apply for Tuition Assistance each year.\n\nIt is not possible for a family or the school to estimate the tuition assistance for which a family qualifies without the completion of a Tuition Assistance application. Applications are submitted directly to a third-party company which evaluates the application based on a methodology and algorithm for Western New York and makes a recommendation to the school’s Tuition Assistance committee as to what the family can afford towards a Nardin Academy education. Qualifying families are notified of their award from the Director of Finance and Tuition Assistance.\n\nUnfortunately, the school is not able to provide Tuition Assistance to every deserving student. We work within our available resources to make the school accessible to as many qualified, mission-appropriate students and families as possible.\n\nDo I need to apply to Nardin Academy to receive confirmation of my Tuition Assistance?\n\nYes.\n\nWhat is the cost to apply for Tuition Assistance?\n\nThe cost of applying for Tuition Assistance is $60, which is an amount that the third-party company sets. Families below certain income levels may be eligible for a fee waiver which is automatically applied to your application.\n\nShould every new Nardin Academy family submit an application for Tuition Assistance?\n\nNo. Only families where affordability is a concern and feel they may not be able to pay the full Tuition should submit a financial application.\n\nDo I need to apply for Tuition Assistance every year?\n\nYes. A new application must be submitted every year because a family’s financial situation can change from year-to-year.\n\nIf I do not qualify for the program this year, can I apply again next year?\n\nYes. A family that does not qualify is welcome to reapply the following year. Again, a family’s financial situation can change from year-to-year.\n\nDo I need to apply for admission separately from applying for Tuition Assistance?\n\nYes. For new students, application to Nardin Academy and application for Tuition Assistance are two separate processes. However, new families may complete both application processes simultaneously.\n\nWill applying for Tuition Assistance hurt my child’s chance of being admitted to the school?\n\nNo. Admission applications and Tuition Assistance applications are evaluated separately, and an application for Tuition Assistance has no bearing on admission decisions.\n\nAre some families awarded full tuition?\n\nNo. Every family is required to make a financial investment in their child’s education. Our commitment in providing Tuition Assistance means that we are sharing in that investment with you.\n\nWhere does the funding come from to support Tuition Assistance?\n\nLike most independent schools, funding comes from our Annual Fund, Endowment, and other revenue generating activities such as our athletic facility rentals.\n\nWhat kind of economic situation is typical of a family who qualifies for Tuition Assistance?\n\nA wide range of families with a variety of circumstances may qualify for the program. It is our desire to enroll as many talented, hard-working students as possible and we would like to provide access and affordability towards our outstanding education. If affordability is a concern for your family, we encourage you to apply for Tuition Assistance.\n\nAre all admitted students offered Tuition Assistance if the family qualifies?\n\nWe have a limited amount of funds to provide our families and do our best to bridge the gap to help families fund a Nardin Academy education. Therefore, a student may be admitted to the school but placed on a waiting list for Tuition Assistance. It is recommended that families apply for Tuition Assistance as early as possible.\n\nWill Tuition Assistance lead to larger class sizes?\n\nNo. Nardin Academy will continue to accept qualified, mission-appropriate students who have a high level of commitment to their studies.\n\nWho should I contact with questions about Tuition Assistance?\n\nQuestions about Tuition Assistance should be directed to:\n\nKerri Blake, Director of Finance & Tuition Assistance\n\n716.881.6262 x1060\n\nShould every returning Nardin Academy family submit an application for Tuition Assistance?\n\nNo. Only families who feel they may not be able to pay full tuition should submit a financial application. If affordability is a concern for your family, we encourage you to apply for Tuition Assistance.\n\nDo I need to apply for Tuition Assistance every year?\n\nYes. A new application may be submitted every year because a family’s financial situation can change from year-to-year.\n\nIf I do not qualify for the program this year, can I apply again next year?\n\nYes. A family that does not qualify is welcome to reapply the following year.
