        "text": "Welcome to Nardin Academy, a school of academic excellence grounded in the values and philosophy of our Catholic faith.\n\nAs the oldest Catholic independent school in Western New York, our rich educational tradition dates back to 1857 when our school was founded as “St. Mary’s Academy and Industrial Female School” by the Daughters of the Heart of Mary (DHM), a society of Catholic women who sought to provide faith-based education to children, particularly girls, in the Buffalo diocese.\n\nFor 165 years, Nardin Academy has continued to follow the examples set by these remarkable women. Each day through exceptional experiences and opportunities for leadership, we encourage students to recognize their part in our global community and to leverage their talents and gifts to do amazing things for the world."
