We arrived late and tired after a long day of cycling, but the reception was so kind and nice, that we forgot about that and felt comfortable immediately. We could park our bicycles in the church opposite of the hotel !! The lady didn't speak anything but Spanish, but she very cleverly used Google Translate to communicate with us.
