        "text": "The last two Cuban workers at the United States Naval Station at Guantánamo Bay retired on Monday from jobs they began more than five decades ago. The two workers, Harry Henry, 82, an office supply technician, and Luis La Rosa, 79, a welder, were among thousands of Cuban laborers who once commuted to the base each day. The United States has controlled the property since 1903, maintaining it under a perpetual lease that can be broken only by mutual agreement between the United States and Cuba, which now have no diplomatic relations. As the relationship soured in the 1960s, Cubans who worked on the base were allowed to keep their jobs, but no more were hired. Over the decades, the ranks of the Cuban employees thinned until only Mr. Henry and Mr. La Rosa were left. Support work on the base is now done by contractors, mainly from the Philippines and Jamaica. In the past decade, the base has been best known for the detention center that now holds 166 foreign captives suspected of links to the Taliban or Al Qaeda."
