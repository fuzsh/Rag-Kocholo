        "text": "Intense fighting in the eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo threatens to destroy a peace process supported by the United Nations and the European Union.\n\nOn Tuesday (28 October), government forces abandoned Rutshuru, a key town in the province of North Kivu, 100 kilometres north of the provincial capital Goma. Yesterday (29 October), the rebels appeared poised to attack Goma, the UN said. Goma itself was “totally encircled”, according to a European source – one of several EU diplomats and security officials stationed in Goma. Another diplomat described the situation as “very fragile” and said that it had the potential to turn into a “full-scale conflict”.\n\nLouis Michel, the European commissioner for development, travelled to Congo yesterday (29 October) to discuss the situation in North Kivu and to sign an aid agreement worth €514 million with the Congolese government of Joseph Kabila in Kinshasa.\n\nTutsi rebels\n\nThe fighting in North Kivu pits government forces against a Tutsi rebel group, the National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP) under the command of Laurent Nkunda. The CNDP, accused of widespread atrocities, claims to protect the local Tutsi population from Rwandan Hutus, remnants of genocidal militias that are now allied with the Congolese army. The two sides agreed a ceasefire in January but it collapsed on 28 August. Since then, more than 200,000 civilians have been displaced, according to the UN. There are no reliable casualty figures.\n\nThe EU has two missions in Congo, one for security sector reform (Eusec) and one for policing (Eupol), which together have fewer than 100 staff. They are the latest in a string of missions that the EU has had in Congo since the war, which killed millions, ended in 2003. Since then, however, fighting in the eastern provinces has flared up repeatedly.\n\nOn the political side, the EU appointed in 1996 a special representative (EUSR) to support peace processes in the Great Lakes region, which includes Congo, Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda. Dutch diplomat Roeland van de Geer, appointed EUSR in February 2007, also serves as a mediator between the governments of DRC and Rwanda, the latter often accused of supporting the CNDP. The two neighbours have no diplomatic relations.\n\nBan Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, said on Monday (27 October) that he was “extremely concerned” by the situation in Congo. He condemned “deliberate attacks on peacekeepers”. Monuc, the UN’s peacekeeping mission in the country, is the world’s largest with 18,000 blue helmets. Its commander, Lieutenant General Vicente Díaz de Villegas of Spain, resigned on Monday (27 October) for “personal reasons”, according to a UN spokesperson, a description that was rejected by diplomats familiar with the matter. He had served in the job for only seven weeks. “I hope his resignation will force a re-think at the UN,” a diplomat said. He said that Monuc was equipped for traditional peacekeeping and was unable to deal with the peace enforcement that was required under the conditions.\n\nMonuc intervened in this week’s fighting on several occasions, but it is unclear whether it will be able to stop the rebel advance. The UN is now requesting urgent reinforcements from troop contributors."
