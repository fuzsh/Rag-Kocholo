        "text": "When I was a kid, waking up on an interstate bus heading north on the Peruvian Pan-American highway meant two things: 1) I was heading to visit my abuela’s lime farm, and 2) I would finally get to play with my dad’s cell phone. My dad would only give me his phone at the farm because Motupe, Lambayeque, the rural town where my abuela’s farm was, had terrible cell service (at least in the early 2000s) and I may have been notorious for driving up the phone bill by opening WAP sites on his phone.\n\nTo get to the farm, we’d travel by bus, then via a colectivo, and lastly on a mototaxi, sometimes having to lift our legs up while the mototaxi crossed rivers and muddy dirt roads. My dad and I would watch as the signal strength on his phone would dip lower and lower—a countdown until I’d get to play with it.\n\nOnce we got to the farm, phone in hand, I would walk around the four hectares of lime plantation in hopes of finding service, but without any luck. In one of the trips I wondered if I needed to gain elevation to be able to get some service, realizing that maybe the trees were blocking the signal. I then saw a ladder laying on a coconut tree, and figured it was time to test my hypothesis. I reached the top of the tree and the phone went from no service to one bar! I was still not able to open a WAP website, but it was extremely exciting to see one bar of service on the phone—and it encouraged me to try out my next project.\n\nMe at my grandma’s lime farm in Motupe, Lambayeque, Perú, with my dad’s cell phone on my belt\n\nLater that day, I asked my grandma if we could change the radio station. She told me that there was only one AM radio station signal that would reach the farm. I then wondered: what would happen if I used a cable to connect the antenna of the AM radio to one of the metal poles around the farm? I wrapped a cable around a pole and the antenna and tried turning the radio to a new station. In the happiest moment of the summer, my prototype worked. We now had access to many radio stations that were far away from the rural town. This victory was especially meaningful, and I felt proud that my tinkering and experimenting had given my grandma access to stories and sounds that she never could have heard before.\n\nI’ve always been this way. When I was given a tricycle as a kid, I grabbed my dad’s toolbox and took the bike apart before ever trying to ride it. I can’t help but be curious about how things work, and I have always tried to find innovative ways to push technology and tools beyond their perceived limitations. It’s part of why I became an engineer. Looking back, I see how those summers on my grandma’s farm—with just one radio station and little to no cell service—forced me to explore my curiosities and expand my understanding of what is technically possible.\n\nThis is why it was surreal to find out, while I was working on Makani in 2016, that another X project called Loon was helping deliver internet access after flooding in my home country of Peru. In fact, it was around that time in 2017 that I challenged myself to someday work on the Loon team—not only were they on a mission that excited me, but they were also connecting people in the part of the world where I grew up, which I thought was so cool. Even more surreal was in early 2020, after Makani wound down, when I arrived at the moonshot factory to interview for the Loon team (a dream come true), and I saw a monitor on the wall that was tracking the Loon balloons’ flight paths and the connectivity between them and the ground stations. It happens that when I walked by, the screen was showing balloons connecting to a ground station in the north of Peru where my grandma's farm is located, just miles from Motupe where my early antics in connectivity began.\n\nMe in Waimea, Hawaii, looking at one of the Makani test flights back in December 2019\n\nWhile I was sad to experience the end of another moonshot journey with the wind down of Loon in 2021, the fact that my path wound up bringing me full-circle back to rural Peru is still one of the highlights of my career—and it shows that you never really know what is going to happen along the winding road of innovation. This is one of the main reasons why I now love working on X’s Project Taara. We’re connecting people in under-connected parts of the world so that they too can experience the wonders of the web (which, these days, is much wider and richer than anything I could have imagined while trying to load WAP sites on my dad’s cell phone).\n\nTackling connectivity problems when I was a kid meant a scrappy DIY approach and a little bit of danger (those coconut trees were tall!). Tackling those problems on Loon meant launching balloons that would spend hundreds of days surfing the stratosphere above my home country, and now on Project Taara it means beaming connectivity across the Congo using laser beams. It makes me feel proud and deeply connected to where I came from to be able to continue the mission I began on my abuela’s farm: prototyping, iterating, and experimenting with connectivity in whatever ways I can."
