        "text": "Contingency Plan for Lengthy Tarmac Delays\n\nThe World Atlantic Airlines Tarmac Delay Contingency Plan\n\nTo be compliant with Department of Transportation’s Enhanced Protections for Airline Passengers regulations (14 CFR Part 259), World Atlantic Airlines (WAA) has established a Tarmac Delay Contingency Plan, and has committed sufficient resources to implement the plan. WAA coordinates this plan with all airports served on a charter basis. In the unlikely event of a long onboard delay prior to takeoff or upon landing, our System Operations Control Center will coordinate with the Pilot-in-command on the aircraft, the local Airport Operations Team, and authorities at the airport to implement our plan.\n\nUnder section 2309 of the 2016 FAA Extension, a tarmac delay begins “after the main aircraft door is closed in preparation for departure” and ends when a U.S. carrier “begins to return the aircraft to a suitable disembarkation point.”\n\nOnboard delays are situations we always try to avoid. Sometimes weather, gate-space limitations, visibility, airport conditions, mechanical problems, Air Traffic Control requirements, or other uncontrollable circumstances cause unavoidable ground delays.\n\nWAA’s Plan is divided into two (2) time components whereby World Atlantic Airlines will provide and/or take action. The first time threshold is designated at two hours after departure from the gate or after landing and en-route to parking location at the gate. The second time threshold will be at the three hour point for domestic flights and at the four hour point for international flights.\n\nFor all flights, World Atlantic Airlines will provide passengers on the delayed flight notification regarding the status of the delay every 30 minutes while the aircraft is delayed, including the reasons for the tarmac delay, if known.\n\nFor domestic flights, WAA gives assurance that it will not permit an aircraft to remain on the tarmac for more than three hours before allowing passengers to deplane unless:\n\n(i) The pilot-in-command determines there is a safety-related or security-related reason (e.g. weather, a directive from an appropriate government agency) why the aircraft cannot leave its position on the tarmac to deplane passengers; or\n\n(ii) Air traffic control advises the pilot-in-command that returning to the gate or another disembarkation point elsewhere in order to deplane passengers would significantly disrupt airport operations.\n\n(2) For international flights departing from or arriving at a U.S. airport, WAA gives assurance that it will not permit an aircraft to remain on the tarmac at a U.S. airport for more than four hours before allowing passengers to deplane, unless:\n\n(i) The pilot-in-command determines there is a safety-related or security-related reason why the aircraft cannot leave its position on the tarmac to deplane passengers; or\n\n(ii) Air traffic control advises the pilot-in-command that returning to the gate or another disembarkation point elsewhere in order to deplane passengers would significantly disrupt airport operations.\n\nFor all flights, WAA gives assurance that it will provide adequate food and potable water no later than two hours after the aircraft leaves the gate (in the case of a departure) or touches down (in the case of an arrival) if the aircraft remains on the tarmac, unless the pilot-in-command determines that safety or security considerations preclude such service.\n\nFor all flights, assurance of operable lavatory facilities, as well as adequate medical attention if needed, while the aircraft remains on the tarmac.\n\nWAA assures that the plan will be coordinated with both U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) at each large U.S. hub airport, medium hub airport, small hub airport and non-hub airport that is regularly used for that carrier's international flights, including diversion airports.\n\nWAA also assures that it will provide comfortable cabin temperatures onboard aircraft will operating and while delayed. Every effort will be made to ensure that gate facilities will be made available in the event of an emergency.\n\nTSA & HAZMAT Information\n\nTSA Information:\n\nU.S. Transport Security Administration (TSA) has implemented certain restrictions on carry-on items andchecked baggage. Please follow this link: tsa.gov for more information on these restrictions.\n\nIf you have more questions about the TSA process, please feel free toContact Us!\n\nHAZMAT:\n\nWorld Atlantic Airlines does not transport Hazardous Materials. Please note that any Hazardous Materials will be confiscated.\n\nWorld Atlantic Airlines – Advice to International Passengers on Limitation of Liability\n\nPassengers on a journey involving ultimate destination or a stop in a country other than the country of origin are advised that the provisions of a treaty known as the Warsaw Convention and the Montreal Convention may be applicable to the journey. For such passengers on a journey to, from or with an agreed stopping place in the United States of America, the Conventions and special contracts of carriage embodied in applicable tariffs provides that the liability of certain carriers, parties to such special contracts, for death of or personal injury to passengers is limited in most cases to proven damages not to exceed US$75,000 per passenger, and that this liability up to such limit shall not depend on negligence on the part of the carrier. For such passengers traveling by carrier not a party to such special contracts or on a journey not to, from, or having an agreed stopping place in the United States of Americ, liability of the carrier for death or personal injury to passengers is limited in most cases to approximately US$10.000 or US$20,000. Additional protection can usually be obtained by purchasing insurance from a private company. Such insurance is not affected by any limitation of the carrier’s liability under the Warsaw Convention of such special contracts of carriers. For further information please consult your insurance company representative.\n\nNote: the limit of liability of US$75,000 above is inclusive of legal fees and costs except that in the case of a claim brought in a state where provision is made for separate award of legal fees and costs, the limit shall be the sum of US$58,000 exclusive of legal fees and costs.\n\nWorld Atlantic Airlines – Notice of Baggage Liability Limitations\n\nLiability for loss or damage to baggage is limited unless a higher value is declared to and accepted by World Atlantic Airlines, in advance of the travel and additional charges are paid. For most international travel the liability limit is approximately US$9.07 per pound (US$20.00 per kilo) for checked baggage only. World Atlantic Airlines assumes no liability for Fragile, Valuables, Jewelry, Stocks and Bonds, Electronics, Precious and Semi-precious Metals and Gem Stones, Designers Clothing or Articles, Art, Paintings, Collectibles or Perishable articles. World Atlantic Airlines, prohibits the transportation of any Hazardous Material (HAZMAT) as indicated by the Hazardous Material Act and IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations.\n\nFor International Travel to which the Warsaw Convention and/or the Montreal Convention applies, the liability of World Atlantic Airlines is limited to approximately $9.07 per pound up to a maximum of US$640.00 per bag for checked baggage only upon receiving the claim in writing, claim has to be made at the airport where the luggage could not be claimed or found after the flight.
