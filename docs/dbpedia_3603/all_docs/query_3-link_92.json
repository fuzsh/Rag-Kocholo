        "text": "Annotations have been added to the Post object from all v2 endpoints that return a Post object. Post annotations offer a way to understand contextual information about the Post itself. Though 100% of Posts are reviewed, due to the contents of Post text, only a portion are annotated.\n\nEntity annotations (NER):Â Entities are comprised of people, places, products, and organizations. Entities are delivered as part of theÂ entityÂ payload section. They are programmatically assigned based on what is explicitly mentioned (named-entity recognition) in the Post text.\n\nContext annotations:Â Derived from the analysis of a Post's text and will include a domain and entity pairing which can be used to discover Posts on topics that may have been previously difficult to surface. At present, weâre using a list of 80+ domains to categorize Posts. A CSV file of the available context annotation entities is available for download at ourÂ Github repository.\n\nPost annotation types\n\nEntities\n\nEntity annotations are programmatically defined entities that are nested within the entities field and are reflected as annotations in the payload. Each annotation has a confidence score and an indication of where in the Post text the entities were identified (start and end fields).\n\nThe entity annotations can have the following types:\n\nPersonÂ - Barack Obama, Daniel, or George W. Bush\n\nPlaceÂ - Detroit, Cali, or \"San Francisco, California\"\n\nProductÂ - Mountain Dew, Mozilla Firefox\n\nOrganizationÂ - Chicago White Sox, IBM\n\nOtherÂ - Diabetes, Super Bowl 50\n\nContext\n\nLast updated: June 2022\n\nContext annotations are delivered as aÂ context_annotationsÂ field in the payload. These annotations are inferred based on semantic analysis (keywords, hashtags, handles, etc) of the Post text and result in domain and/or entity labels. Context annotations can yield one or many domains. At present, weâre using a list of 80+ domains reflected in the table below.\n\nNote: Domain 131Â (Unified Twitter Taxonomy) refers to X's User Facing Interest Taxonomy. This taxonomy helps to power features on the platform such as,Â Topics.Â Â\n\nÂ\n\nRequesting annotations"
