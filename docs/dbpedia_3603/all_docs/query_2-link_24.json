        "text": "Western Union is the best\n\n19/07/2018\n\nI have tried many applications but this one takes the cake. It is easy, quick and I get everything done. Since I am sending money to support my wife dâ¦oing business overseas this avails me of the answer to help her. It is a startup so it is not big enough yet to have the better money accounting afforded yet. Western Union saved my information so that it is even faster but there are still security items they use to verify so it is safe. Since this application everything flows nicely and I suggest you give it a try!\n\nRead full review Read less\n\nVery convenient and the price is greatâ¦\n\n29/01/2020\n\nI used to go to a certain store where I had to wait in line and the charge for the transaction was way more expensive. I love being able to just pick â¦up my phone and make transactions.\n\nRead full review Read less\n\nGreat App\n\n14/09/2020\n\nThis App is one of the easiest Apps Iâve used, thereâs not a whole lot of apps that as easy to navigate and simplistic but still having everythingâ¦ you need in it. I use this app to send my friend money for food and his medications etc in DR and has worked perfectly every time! No need for me to go to the store every single time like Iâve had to do in the passed to pick up or receive money! I have my 5 star rating due to the fact Iâve had absolutely no issues with this app and itâs fast easy and secure!â\n\nRead full review Read less\n\nBetter rate and faster transaction\n\n23/02/2021\n\nI was using a different app until I came across this app. I would compare the rate and the charges and WU is always has higher exchange rate and lowerâ¦ transfer fee than the other. Yet they have the same processing time. I am sticking with this app from now on.\n\nRead full review Read less"
