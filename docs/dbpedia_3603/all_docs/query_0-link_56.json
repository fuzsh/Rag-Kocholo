        "text": "The author wants to acknowledge the insightful comments of Professor Johan Lagae during the writing of this paper. Additionally, the author wishes to thank Professor Jacob Sabakinu Kivilu and Dr. Gillian Mathys for their observations on previous versions of this paper, as well as Dr. David Peleman for his remarks on the research conducted for the Master’s dissertation which was at the base of the paper. Further thanks go to Dr. Ana Vaz Milheiro and Dr. Barbara Lipietz (II International Conference African Urban Planning, Lisbon, 2017).\n\nIntroduction\n\n1Compared to the railroad and fluvial networks, road infrastructure remains a blank spot in the historiography of colonial planning in Congo, and by extension, in the entire continent. Nonetheless, the colonial road network was used to efficiently carry out the health care program, tax system, postal service, and the military control system, which Freed called the ‘networks of colonial power’ (Freed, 2010). From a diffusionist standpoint that polarises ‘Western’ and ‘indigenous’ technologies, one could hypothesise that road infrastructure thus equally served as a tool of empire during the Belgian colonisation (Headrick, 1981). However, the analysis of the interwar road construction in the Bas-Congo region leads us to question this concept of tool of empire, striving for ‘a more interactive, culturally-nuanced, multi-sited debate about how technology functions within specific parameters of time, place and culture’ (Arnold, 2005).\n\n2As road construction implies access to land, recruitment of labour, and a means of extraction of goods, the road network in the colonial context is inevitably linked to ideas of power, culture and identity. Road construction in Belgian Congo was thus closely related to the development of missionary congregations (Cleys et al., 2019; Cleys, De Meulder, 2011), investment strategies of private capital, politics of the colonial government administration, and various levels of African agency. In line with David Peleman’s Les Hommes de la Route for Belgium (Peleman, 2013), the overall goal of this research is to unveil who were some of the main actors involved in the design and production of the colonial road network, and what were their agendas. Focussing on the evolution of the road network built in Belgian Congo during the interwar period, this article studies two of these specific actors: the colonial government and private entrepreneurs. In particular, the analysis of the case of interwar road construction in the Cataractes-Nord region illustrates how private entrepreneurs deployed the colonial government’s road policies in their favour by carefully responding to governance sensitivities in order to access the colonial hinterland. Contrary to the still dominant discourse on the history of colonial planning (Scott, 1998; Young, 1994), the case illustrates as such how everyday colonial policymaking in Belgian Congo was deeply reliant on the capabilities and motives of government officials and private entrepreneurs ‘on the ground’.\n\n3Existing studies on transportation in Congo, including those dating from the 1950s and 60s, have been limited almost exclusively to fluvial navigation, the development of airlines and, most importantly, the railway network (Blanchart, 1993; Katzellenbogen, 1973; Lederer, 1965; Vanthemsche, 2001). In more general surveys of transportation networks in (colonial) Congo, the discussions on road infrastructure remain extremely concise (Headrick, 1981; Huybrechts, 1970; Nicolaï, 1996; Sabakinu Kivilu, 1979). Besides a noteworthy study on the development of motor vehicles in Belgian Congo (Tsund’olela, 1987), it is quite telling that the most informative source on the topic remains a technical report of 218 pages written by Egide-Jean Devroey, an engineer employed in the Ministry of Colonies (Devroey, 1939). This lack of research on road infrastructure is not specific to the Belgian colony, but can be extended to other studies on transportation in colonial Africa (Dix, 1931). One of the few scholars who did engage in studies on mobility in colonial and postcolonial Africa, Gordon Pirie, writes: ‘compared to the railway, the road and its users have been something of a Cinderella in African transportation history’ (Pirie, 1990, 2009, 2018).\n\n4Anno 2020, some scholars try to put research on colonial infrastructure back on the table (Cupers, 2018; Scotto 2018), although the study of road networks and car mobility in colonial Africa still remains in the margins (Gewald, 2002, 2009). Still, upcoming scholars convincingly argue that road infrastructure and the car mobility it enabled, provide a powerful lens to rethink colonial history by presenting ‘alternative visions of space and power, autonomy and authority, mobility and control’ (Hart, 2015, 2016). Nancy Rose Hunt provided a similar cultural perspective on the history of colonial mobility, studying the disruptive nature of new forms of mobility on African societies, and the struggles related to the simultaneous events of rural health care and forced road construction (Hunt, 1999). Furthermore, Freed’s Networks of (colonial) power: roads in French Central Africa after World War I, studies roads and road work as ‘sites of contestation over colonial rule and order’, signalling the disruptive impact of the forced and technically simple road work on local populations (Freed, 2010). At the same time, recent contributions to the emerging field of the anthropology of infrastructure discuss how road infrastructure does more than only connect, it participates in the creation and recreation of social spaces (Rest, Rippa, 2019).\n\n5In Belgian Congo, the construction of a fine-grained road network coincides not unsurprisingly with the emergence of a colonial bureaucratic apparatus during the interwar years. This period in Congo’s history has not received much scholarly attention until recent years (Petit, Vanderlinden, 2016; Vanderlinden, 2019). Contrarily to railroads that played a major role in linking emerging cities and thus helped structure the urbanisation of the colony, the road network in colonial Congo was more closely linked with the development of the countryside and the upcoming rural economy, a strategy that attracted new political interest after WWI. The rural economy of Belgian Congo has been overlooked for the major part in recent scholarship (Drachoussoff, 1991; Jewsiewicki, 1980, 1983) as most scholars tend to focus on the urban centres, although some noticeable exceptions can be found (Clement, 2007; Segers, 2016).\n\n6Looking at the often messy colonial reality in this ‘periphery of the periphery’ (Sengupta, 2010) allows us to investigate how centrally planned, top-down road policies were effectively implemented ‘on the ground’. Starting from a detailed analysis of the interwar context of colonial road policies, this article elaborates on how the Belgian government considered the road network an essential component of the armature économique and wanted to stimulate its construction to efficiently access the colonial hinterland. Road infrastructure served as a means of control for Belgian colonial officials, via which they could penetrate this rural territory for medical, military, or administrative motives. A substantial part of the road infrastructure network provided the framework for the development of car-based tourism, which targeted both an ‘internal’ and an ‘external’ market from the 1930s onwards (Verhoeven, Payrhuber, 2019). Subsequently, the eighty-year-old technical report on road infrastructure written by Egide-Jean Devroey, an engineer employed in the Ministry of Colonies, is used to deconstruct the colonial administration’s vision of a rational categorization and implementation of roads in the colonial territory (Devroey, 1939).\n\n7In the second part of this article, we contrast these government strategies with a close reading of the case of Victor Cooreman, a jute planter who wanted to install himself in the Cataractes-Nord region in 1928. After three years of correspondence between the entrepreneur and the various levels of government agents, Victor Cooreman ultimately convinced the Belgian government to finance a road crucial for the entrepreneur’s activities, and to recruit indigenous labourers for the road’s construction and maintenance. The detailed description of the case reveals the aptitude and agency of both a variety of government officials and private entrepreneurs, as well as the messy reality of how these policies landed and adapted ‘on the ground’. At the same time, the internal correspondence within the government administration demonstrates the relatively of this colonial road infrastructure as tools of empire, as these centrally-planned roads became ‘tools’ local actors used for their own intentions, in a complex web of knowledge and technology exchanges and interconnectedness (Arnold, 2005).\n\n9By analysing the case of Victor Cooreman’s road negotiation in the Cataractes-Nord region, we hope to provide useful insights in the nuanced realities of colonial road construction in order to add to the rising scholarship on localised agencies (Salami, 2016; De Nys-Ketels et al., 2019). At the same time, this case offers a powerful tool to critically reassess African transportation and planning history, which seems quite technical at first, but ultimately proves to be exceptionally layered.\n\nRoad infrastructure as part of the colonial Armature économique\n\n10At the end of the 19th century, the road network in Belgian Congo was mainly limited to the Bas-Congo region, trying to secure the narrow carrier routes installed by Henry Morton Stanley in 1886 (Fig. 1, right-hand side). Even in the broader context of the African continent, only in the interwar years the first steps towards national and international colonial road networks were taken. In Belgian Congo, the launch of Minister of Colonies Louis Franck’s investment plan in 1922 accelerated the development of different means of (cheap) transportation infrastructure (Vanhove, 1968). Louis Franck (1868-1937) was the liberal Minister of Colonies of Belgium between 1918 and 1924. He launched the so-called ‘Plan Franck’ on August 21, 1921, which consisted of a series of laws and regulations responding to the need for transportation infrastructure in order to stimulate private investment (Belgian Colonial Biography).\n\n12In addition to its economic and political narrative, the ‘Plan Franck’ represented a preliminary step in the Belgian governments’ strategy of rationalising the organization of indigenous labour force. After the international critique on the forced labour practices and the way the Congo Free State was ruled before 1908, the Belgian government strove to project the image of a model colony to the world. From the 1920s onwards, representatives of Belgium took an active role in the composition of various international anti-slavery conventions in the newly established League of Nations. These covenants were of various effectiveness, as national governments interpreted them depending their own definition of the term ‘forced labour’ (Laqua, 2013). Note how particularly the Portuguese and Belgian governments argued during the 1920s that ‘labour could be made compulsory not only for public works but for purposes of education and social welfare’. Although never officially against these conventions, the Belgian government postponed the ratification of the 1930s ‘Forced Labour Convention’ for over a decade, only wanting to accept the convention provided that it allowed for ‘works of public interest, as determined by competent authorities’ (Laqua, 2013). This clearly illustrates the Belgian government’s conflicting motives concerning forced labour that benefitted the development of their colonie modèle or labour defined as ‘educating the passive and lazy indigenous population’ as part of a civilizing mission (Laqua, 2013). After WWII, these impromptu strategies accumulated in a shift of colonial policymaking towards what Young has called ‘welfare colonialism’ (Young, 1994), where the colonial extraction economy was reframed by associating it to major housing, healthcare and education investments (De Nys-Ketels et al., 2019).\n\n13Between 1927 and 1931, catholic politician Henri Jaspar (1870-1939) was almost without interruption both Prime Minister of Belgium and Minister of Colonies (Vanhove, 1958). Well aware of the rising international tensions, he wanted to reconcile the progress of Congolese industries with the possibilities and limitations of the local labour force. To this end, Jaspar had an in-depth investigation carried out in 1930 in Belgian Congo, which resulted in the publication of Expansion coloniale: étude documentaire sur l’armature économique de la colonie belge du Congo. This two-volume publication consisted of set of essays about the armatures that frame the economic expansion of the colony, such as agriculture, education, geology, legislation and transportation networks (Jaspar, Passelecq, 1932). Jaspar continued the politics of his predecessors in the creation of new railways and road networks, and the development of stations and ports, explicitly considering the road network an essential part of the armature économique. Based on this detailed survey, Jaspar established new recruitment standards in the various economic zones, arguing that this would lower the pressure on the indigenous population (Vanhove, 1968).\n\n14Although the road policies discussed in the ‘Plan Franck’ and Henri Jaspar’s Expansion coloniale indirectly conceived road infrastructure as a tool of empire, they divulged little on how the Belgian government envisioned the implementation of their (inter)national transportation and labour politics ‘on the ground’. Remarkably, the eighty-year-old Le Réseau Routier au Congo Belge et au Ruandi-Urundi (Devroey, 1939) is a key source to study the perception of colonial road policies in the Léopoldville-based colonial administration, as it remains the most complete source on the Belgian colonial road network until today. This technical report was written in 1939 by Egide-Jean Devroey (1894-1972), a prominent engineer employed by the Ministry of Colonies in Léopoldville (Belgian Colonial Biography), and reads as an accumulation of Devroey’s two decades of experiences and frustrations with the ad hoc road construction policies in Belgian Congo (Fig. 1, left-hand side). Trying to respond to the struggles of implementing centrally-decided road policies in an extensive colonial territory over eighty times the size of Belgium, Devroey wrote an all-inclusive guide for the colonial government apparatus in order to offer each administrator, regardless of his rank in the colonial hierarchy, a set of objective criteria to guide the construction of a road in a rational and objective manner.\n\n15In the first part of the publication, Devroey distinguished between private and public roads, and divided the latter into three administrative categories. The primary and secondary public roads linked the rural economy with the supra-local rail and river networks, and were used for economic transportation of exploited goods. Additionally, the author discussed a third category: the routes pour voyageurs. These roads served no economic purpose, but offered administrative, political and tourist accessibility of the territory. They were a tool of control for Belgian colonial officials, via which they could penetrate this rural territory for medical, military or administrative motives. These routes pour voyageurs were used by bicycling nurses and linked the African rural population with the local missionary church.\n\n16Devroey further made a distinction between roads of intérêt général (‘general interest’) and of intérêt local (‘local interest’). Roads of ‘general interest’ were defined as public roads that connected administrative centres of the colony, and were the only roads that could be financed by the Belgian state. Any public road that was not granted this status of intérêt général by the Gouverneur Général, automatically became a road of intérêt local. This seemingly practical set of guidelines was created to automatise an efficient access of the entire colonial territory, additionally prioritizing the construction of major roads that stimulated government control and economic expansion.\n\n17However, the analysis of interwar road construction in the Cataractes-Nord region discussed below will illustrate how this status of intérêt général was (mis)used both by private entrepreneurs and the various government officials to motivate their own agendas. A close reading of the correspondence between various government officials and Victor Cooreman, a private entrepreneur who wanted to establish his jute plantation in the region, offers new insights in the dissonant decision-making process of colonial road construction. Studying the genesis of the road between Luozi and M’bedi, the first road in the Cataractes-Nord territoire and the road Cooreman needed to access his plantation, reveals how the colonial road policies landed and were adapted ‘on the ground’ in this ‘periphery of the periphery’.\n\nJute economy as incentive for colonial road construction: the case of Victor Cooreman\n\nJute plantation in the Luala basin\n\n18Victor Cooreman et Cie was established on February 1, 1923 with the purpose of ‘the trade, import and export of cotton and jute fabrics, the manufacture of these fabrics, as well as all operations related to this trade’(Statute Books Belgium). Its main shareholder was Victor Cooreman (1879-1976), the son of catholic politician and businessman Gérard Cooreman (1852-1926), both members of a family active in the fibre industry and part of the bourgeois upper class of the city of Ghent. Gérard Cooreman was the founder and president of the ‘Compagnie Cotonnière Congolaise’ (COTONCO) since 1920 (Statute Books Belgium), and his son wanted to expand his professional activities in the colony by installing a jute plantation in the Luala basin.\n\n21Analysing this map as an archival document in its own right, reveals how this region, and the colony in general, was not at all the ‘terra nullius’ the colonial government depicted in their cartographic vision for the colony. The presence of these sentiers indigènes represent one of the existing logics present in this rural countryside, which usually remained hidden in the colonial government’s official correspondence and mapping on the region. Moreover, considering these private entrepreneurs as cartographic explorers opens up opportunities to investigate and reassess the local realities of road construction, and by extension, the historiography of colonial planning.\n\nFrom private road to route d’intérêt général\n\n22As the projected road between the Luala basin and Luozi only benefitted the exploitation of Victor Cooreman, officially, it should have been categorised as a private road, and thus commissioned and maintained by the entrepreneur himself. However, both the applicant’s eloquent wording and the internal dissonance within the government apparatus allowed that the road was ultimately paid and maintained by the Belgian government, and even received the status of ‘general interest’. Digging deeper in the correspondence between the jute planter and the colonial government discloses the complex history of road construction in this ‘periphery of the periphery’. Furthermore, the intricate set of actors involved in the genesis of this road reveals a complex web of exchanges and interconnectedness between them, and questions colonial roads as tool of empire.\n\n27Dissonant reactions were given to this demand by the various levels of governmental authority in the colony, from the local Administrateur Territorial, to the Commissaire de District, the Gouverneur de Province, and ultimately the Gouverneur Général based in Léopoldville. The Agronome Provincial – the provincial agricultural administrator –, M. Peters, and the Administrateur Territorial of the Cataractes-Nord territory, M. Lecocq, both agreed to Cooreman’s demands, arguing how the need for added revenues and decline of porterage service dominated when granting this protection zone in the region. Lecocq explained how the jute harvest of the trial area needed to be transported via Luozi-Kinganga-Lufu (Fig. 2), of which only the part between Luala and Luozi still needed to be constructed, which was now a porterage route that strains the local population at the time. He gave his opinion on how the construction could be done, under whose supervision, but never even considered that it may not be the government’s responsibility to construct this private road to begin with.\n\n28The Commissaire de District of the district Bas-Congo, M. Morel, agreed with the recruitment conditions for the road, but stipulated that the local workforce should be paid by Cooreman. The manner in which the indigenous workforce would be recruited was not discussed in any of these letters, signalling that, although aware of the labour shortage, Cooreman’s offer was seen as an optimal solution to keep the local workforce from migrating away from the territory. The focus was on the economic aspect of the cultivation, assuming that if more work was introduced in the area, the automatic response of the local population would be to stop migrating. The Commissaire Général, interim of the Provincial Governor of Congo-Kasaï, later sent this entire compilation of letters to the Gouverneur Général, narrowing down the request to the question if or if not the government should allow Cooreman extra privileges. However, the Commissaire Général claimed that no help should be offered to the firm at all as long as the trial was incomplete. No longer treating the road question as an independent request, he acted according to his own motives of not wanting his province to pay for the road’s construction, nor wanting to strain the local population, and gave a negative reply to the request.\n\n29Various reasons can be discerned for this outcome. First of all, the construction of the railroad from Matadi to Léopoldville was, at that time, one of the biggest projects on the agenda of the Governor, as the completion of these infrastructure works would mean that the entire province of Bas-Congo could attract new investors. Take into account the (international) struggles concerning forced labour, the Governor would have been pressured to finish the railroad’s construction as soon as possible. Although he was undoubtedly aware of the migration problems the lower government representatives discussed, the railroad’s construction was the priority of his agenda. Any additional recruitment in the area, it being for advancement of the roads or for new cultivation practices, would further add to the recruitment problems the railroad already struggled with. By delaying the request until the results of the trial area were complete, he hoped to finish the railroad construction first, which was foreseen to be only six months later. In the end, the Gouverneur Général agreed with him, and sent a letter to the Minister of Colonies, in which he quoted that this was not an appropriate time to give extra concessions to Cooreman & Co (July 25, 1930).\n\n30On August 7, an ambiguous decision was taken by the Minister of Colonies: he gave his principle agreement to Cooreman & Co. for both the protection zone as well as the funding of the road construction, after the negative advice the Gouverneur Général provided. This decision seemed very contradictory, as Jaspar first demanded the local authorities’ expertise, when he did not follow their advice later. Further research revealed that just the day before, he received positive recommendations from the Brussels-based colonial Departments of Agriculture and Economy to grant the demand of Cooreman & Co. in order to stimulate extra investment in the area. However, the Gouverneur Général of the Léopoldville-based government did not agree with these recommendations, having given a negative advice just ten days earlier. Several explanations can be given for this difference of opinion. In general, we can ask ourselves if the Brussels-based Departments of Agriculture and Economy were aware of the depth of the population problems the Province of Bas-Congo struggled with. Nonetheless, the Department of Public Transportation, based in Brussels and a direct collaborator of the two former departments, was undoubtedly aware of the problems the railroad construction encountered. So both the Gouverneur Général and the Minister of Colonies should have been informed of these issues, making the latter’s priority of keeping the Belgian entrepreneurs happy and stimulating extra investments in the colony even more telling.\n\nConclusion\n\n32This article analyses how the Belgian colonial government conceived road infrastructure a tool of empire, and how its genesis is completely different from the well-studied railroad network. Examining the case of Victor Cooreman demonstrates how the colonial state stimulated road construction projects in the previously inaccessible Cataractes-Nord region, as this new road network could help facilitate the state presence and surveillance in the colonial hinterland. Even if the road between M’bedi and Luozi at its origins only served the private interests of Victor Cooreman, making it easier for him to extract his jute from the colony, the road is ambiguously granted the status of ‘general interest’. The colonial government authorised thus that the surrounding African population was obliged to construct and maintain this road, even if the abolishment of forced labour in the colonies was a rising topic in international debate at the time. This article therefore underscores the hypothesis that the colonial road network was linked to the infiltration and development of the colonial hinterland, and its construction and maintenance was all the more disruptive for local populations.\n\n33Although this article choses to focus on the relation between the government machinery and private entrepreneurship, the study of the development of the road network in the Cataractes-Nord region introduces a wider set of actors active in public road construction: missionary congregations, private investors, African labourers… and shows how the specific dynamic between them influenced the decision-making process of the road construction project ‘on the ground’. The next step would be to investigate the impact of missionary congregations on the colonial road infrastructure project (Cleys et al., 2019; Cleys, De Meulder, 2011; Mahaniah, 1981). A detailed cartographic study of the evolution of the missionary, state, and privately constructed road networks after 1931 would offer valuable insights in both the geopolitical and economic motives of all actors involved. Additionally, this cartographic mapping should be completed by consulting the colonial archives in the capital of DRC and the archives of local missionary congregations, most of them still present in the DRC.\n\n34Still, the evolution of interwar road construction in the Cataractes-Nord region clearly illustrates how relative these roads as tools of empire were: in the hands of smart investors they become ‘tools’ to make a profit in a colony; in the hands of Africans ‘tools’ to avoid colonial power (Mathys, 2014); and even in the hands of different layers of the colonial administration they served different purposes. Headrick’s tools of empire concept may be applicable to Belgian Congo’s road construction, it is also super-reducing. It conceals the complexity that occurs when introducing a ‘technology’ in a colonial context, where various local officials and private entrepreneurs have the agency to adapt these centrally-defined road policies in the ‘on the ground’ reality in the vast Congolese rural hinterland. This case provides thus already a powerful lens through which we can gain a better understanding of the forces at play in the transformation the road network brought about in the understudied Congolese countryside."
