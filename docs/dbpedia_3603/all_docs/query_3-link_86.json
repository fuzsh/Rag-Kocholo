        "text": "How many service stations are there in the United States?\n\nThe NACS, the association for convenience and fuel retailing, reports that there are more than 145,000 fueling stations across the United States. 127,588 of these stations are convenience stores selling fuel. The rest are gas-only stations, grocery stores selling fuel, marinas, etc.\n\nDo the major oil companies own all the service stations in this country?\n\nNo. According to the latest information, the refiners own less than 5% of the 145,000 retail stations. When a station bears a particular refiner’s brand, it does not mean that the refiner owns or operates the station. The vast majority of branded stations are owned and operated by independent retailers licensed to represent that brand. According to the National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS), more than 60% of the retail stations in the US are owned by an individual or family that owns a single store. Through various branding agreements, approximately 36% of the retail stations in the US sell fuel under API members’ brands. See U.S. Service Station Outlets Summary.\n\nWho owns the rest of the stations?\n\nIndependent owners. They may own just one station, or they could own several stations, or they could own hundreds of stations.\n\nCan these independent owners also sell the major brands of gasoline?\n\nYes. Independents and jobbers can sell gasoline under the brand of one major company or multiple major companies, as well as have their own brand of fuel.\n\nWhy is the price of gasoline so much higher in other countries?\n\nMany countries assess higher tax rates and use the revenue for their general fund budget. For example, ten countries in Europe, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom assess more than $3 in taxes on every gallon of gasoline, according to the Tax Foundation.\n\nWhat’s the single best thing I can do to save gasoline?\n\nCombine trips. Plan well and be sensible about how much you drive. Conserve by avoiding unnecessary trips, combining errands, and carpooling.\n\nWhen I am behind the wheel, how can I get more miles per gallon?\n\nAccelerate smoothly. Jackrabbit starts consume twice the fuel as gradual starts. Also, pace your driving. Staying at a constant speed is better than continuously speeding up and slowing down. Slow down. The faster you drive, the more gasoline your car uses. Driving at 65 miles per hour instead of 55 miles per hour reduces fuel economy by about two miles per gallon.\n\nBesides changing driving habits, what can I do to improve vehicle fuel efficiency?\n\nMaintain your vehicle. Have your car tuned regularly, keep air filters clean, and make sure tires are properly inflated. An engine tune-up can improve car fuel economy by an average of one mile per gallon; under-inflated tires can reduce it by that amount. Don’t warm up your car for too long on cold mornings. Experts say that your car only needs a 30 second warm-up before you can start driving in winter. Cool your car responsibly on hot days. Less use of your air conditioner can improve fuel economy by as much as two miles per gallon, but today’s air conditioners create less drag on your engine than driving with the windows down. Also, you should clean out your car—not only will it make it look nicer, but reducing weight can increase fuel efficiency.\n\nDoes it make a difference what car I drive?\n\nMore fuel-efficient vehicles can save gasoline. A highly fuel-efficient vehicle could potentially cut gasoline use in half or more. How much depends on the vehicle and driving habits and needs. If a less fuel-efficient car requires 20 gallons of gasoline a week compared with 10 gallons for a highly fuel-efficient vehicle, more than 500 gallons of gasoline could be saved annually.\n\nWhat about ethanol?\n\nEthanol contains less energy per gallon than gasoline. According to the Energy Information Administration, the energy content of ethanol is about 33% less than pure gasoline. Most gasoline contains about 10% ethanol, but some higher blends can be problematic for engines and potentially void your warranty. Be sure to consult your vehicle’s owner’s manual before filling up.\n\nCan I avoid fuel evaporation and loss by keeping my tank almost full?\n\nIt shouldn't be a concern. Technical changes to vehicle fuel systems have virtually eliminated fuel evaporation losses.\n\nDoes it help to fill up in the morning when fuel is cool?\n\nVery little. While it’s true that gasoline expands as it gets hotter (reducing the energy content in a given volume), the expansion is only about one percent for every 15 degrees F. Moreover, storage tanks at gasoline stations are buried several feet underground, helping to insulate fuel and keep temperature relatively constant. The benefits, if any, of filling up in the morning versus the evening would be hard to notice.\n\nHow much tax do we pay on a gallon of gasoline?\n\nFederal, state, and local government taxes also contribute to the retail price of gasoline. The federal excise tax is currently 18.3¢ per gallon, and there is an additional Leaking Underground Storage Tank fee of 0.1¢ per gallon. As of July 1, 2017, state taxes on gasoline, including state and local government taxes and fees, averaged 27.3¢ per gallon. County and city taxes can have a significant impact on the price of gasoline in some locations. See the U.S. Energy Information Administration's Gasoline Explained: Factors Affecting Gasoline Prices.\n\nWhat Does the Government Do with the Money?\n\nTraditionally the bulk of the money is used for building and repairing road and bridges.\n\nDo most customers pump their own gasoline?\n\nYes. The first self-serve station opened in 1947 in California. Self-serve really grew in popularity in the 1970s. By 1993, the most recent year for which data are available, self-serve accounted for 88 percent of all sales in states where it was legal.\n\nWhy are prices posted in fractions?\n\nThe idea of posting the prices in fractions began back in the 1930s, when \"discount\" service stations opened and owners promoted their price on their signs out front. To emphasize the discount, these independents priced their product in fractions, sometimes at 1/2 cent intervals, but often at 9/10.\n\nMay you pump your own gas in all 50 states?\n\nNo. New Jersey and Oregon have laws that allow only an attendant to pump gasoline. Customers in all other 48 states may pump their own gasoline.\n\nI see gasoline trucks traveling on the road daily. Are they delivering product right from the refinery?"
