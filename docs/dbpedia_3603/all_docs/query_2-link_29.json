Ideals of “sanctity of human life” and “improve the world” in Mosaic Law, linked with Greek traditions of healthful nutrition and lifestyle, are relevant in modern public health. Roman sanitary engineering and military medicine made pivotal contributions. Hospital organization and university training for physicians developed during Islamic and Christian periods. The rise of cities, the Renaissance, and rapid changes in agriculture, trade, and industry all contributed to public health. New social, political, and economic reforms in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, contributing to sanitation, social reform, and improved nutrition and medical care, led to improved longevity and quality of life in the twentieth century. Immunology, social security, health insurance, and health promotion expanded the scope and effectiveness of global health. Biomedical and social sciences, technology, and public health organization are critical as public health faces old and new health challenges.\n\nKeywords: germ theory, health promotion, infectious disease, maternal health, miasma theory, non-communicable disease, nutrition, origin of public health, sanitary revolution, social security\n\nUpon completion of this chapter, the student should be able to:\n\n1.\n\nIdentify major historical trends and concepts of public health, and their relationship to the individual and the community;\n\n2.\n\nAddress health issues within a historical perspective;\n\n3.\n\nApply experience from the past to address present and new health problems.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe history of public health is derived from many historical ideas, trial and error, the development of basic sciences, technology, and epidemiology. In the modern era, James Lind’s clinical trial of various dietary treatments of British sailors with scurvy in 1756 and Edward Jenner’s 1796 discovery that cowpox vaccination prevents smallpox have modern-day applications as the science and practices of nutrition and immunization are crucial influences on health among the populations of developing and developed countries.\n\nHistory provides a perspective to develop an understanding of health problems of communities and how to cope with them. We visualize through the eyes of the past how societies conceptualized and dealt with disease. All societies must face the realities of disease and death, and develop concepts and methods to manage them. These strategies evolved from scientific knowledge and trial and error, but are associated with cultural and societal conditions, beliefs and practices that are important in determining health status and curative and preventive interventions to improve health.\n\nThe history of public health is a story of the search for effective means of securing health and preventing disease in the population. Epidemic and endemic infectious disease stimulated thought and innovation in disease prevention on a pragmatic basis, often before the causation was established scientifically. The prevention of disease in populations revolves around defining diseases, measuring their occurrence, and seeking effective interventions.\n\nPublic health evolved through trial and error and with expanding scientific medical knowledge, at times controversial, often stimulated by war and natural disasters. The need for organized health protection grew as part of the development of community life, and in particular, urbanization and social reforms. Religious and societal beliefs influenced approaches to explaining and attempting to control communicable disease by sanitation, town planning, and provision of medical care. Religions and social systems have also viewed scientific investigation and the spread of knowledge as threatening, resulting in inhibition of developments in public health, with modern examples of opposition to birth control, immunization, and food fortification.\n\nScientific controversies, such as the contagionist and anticontagionist disputations during the nineteenth century and opposition to social reform movements, were ferocious and resulted in long delays in adoption of the available scientific knowledge. Such debates continued into the twentieth and still continue into the twenty-first century with a melding of methodologies proven to be interactive incorporating the social sciences, health promotion, and translational sciences bringing the best available evidence of science and practice together for greater effectiveness in policy development for individual and population health practices.\n\nModern society in high, medium and low income countries still faces the ancient scourges of communicable diseases, but also the modern pandemics of cardiovascular disease, cancers, mental illness, and trauma. The emergence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza, and drug-resistant microorganisms forces us to seek new ways of preventing their potentially serious consequences to society. Threats to health in a world facing severe climate and ecological change pose harsh and potentially devastating consequences for society.\n\nThe evolution of public health is a continuing process; pathogens change, as do the environment and the host. In order to face the challenges ahead, it is important to have an understanding of the past. Although there is much in this age that is new, many of the current debates and arguments in public health are echoes of the past. Experience from the past is a vital tool in the formulation of health policy. An understanding of the evolution and context of those challenges and innovative ideas can help us to navigate the public health world of today and the future.\n\nPrehistoric Societies\n\nThe Paleolithic Age is the earliest stage of human development where organized societal structures are known to have existed. These social structures consisted of people living in bands which survived by hunting and gathering food. There is evidence of the use of fire going back some 230,000 years, and increasing sophistication of stone tools, jewelry, cave paintings, and religious symbols during this period. Modern humans evolved from Homo sapiens, probably originating in Africa and the Middle East about 90,000 years ago, and appearing in Europe during the Ice Age period (40,000–35,000 BCE). During this time, humanity spread over all major land masses following the retreating glaciers of the last Ice Age at 11,000–8000 BCE.\n\nA Mesolithic Age or transitional phase of evolution from hunter–gatherer societies into the Neolithic Age of food-raising societies occurred during different periods in various parts of the world, first in the Middle East from 9000 to 8000 BCE onward, reaching Europe about 3000 BCE. The change from hunting, fishing, and gathering modes of survival to agriculture was first evidenced by domestication of animals and then the growing of grain and root crops, and vegetables. Associated skills, including food storage and cooking, pottery, basket weaving, ovens, smelting, and trade, led to improved survival techniques and population growth gradually spread throughout the world.\n\nCommunal habitation became essential to adaptation to changing environmental conditions and hazards, allowing population growth and geographic expansion. At each stage of human biological, technological, and social evolution, humans coexisted with diseases associated with the environment and living patterns, seeking herbal and mystical treatments for the maladies. People called on the supernatural and magic to appease these forces and prevent plagues, famines, and disasters. Shamans or witch doctors attempted to remove harm by magical or religious practices along with herbal treatments acquired through trial and error. Life expectancy in prehistoric times was 25–30 years, with men living longer than women, probably due to malnutrition and maternity-related causes.\n\nAs human society evolved, technologically, culturally, and biologically, nutrition and exposure to communicable and non-infectious disease changed. Social organization led to innovations in tools and skills for hunting, clothing, shelter, fire for warmth and cooking, food for use and storage, burial of the dead, and removal of waste products from living areas. Adaptation of human society to the environment has been and remains a central issue in population health. This is a recurrent theme in the development of public health, with resilience in facing daunting new challenges of adaptation and balance with the environment.\n\nThe Ancient World\n\nThe development of agriculture served growing populations unable to survive solely on hunting, gathering, crafts and trading, stimulating the organization of more complex societies able to share production and irrigation systems, in response to disease, malnutrition, and stunted growth. Division of labor, trade, commerce, and government was associated with the development of urban societies. Population growth and communal living led to improved standards of living but also created new health hazards, including the spread of diseases. As in our time, these challenges required community action to prevent disease and promote survival.\n\nIn the first civilizations, mystical beliefs, divination, and shamanism coexisted with practical knowledge of herbal medicines, midwifery, management of wounds or broken bones, and trepanation to remove “evil spirits”. All were part of communal life with variations in historical and cultural development. The advent of writing led to medical documentation. Requirements of medical conduct were spelled out as part of the general legal code of Hammurabi in Mesopotamia (c. 1700 BCE). This code included regulation of physician fees, with punishment for treatment failure, which set a legal basis for the subsequent secular practice of medicine. Many of the main traditions of medicine were based on magic or derived from religion. Medical practice was often based on belief in the supernatural, and healers were believed to have a religious calling. Training of medical practitioners, regulation of their practice, and ethical standards evolved in a number of ancient societies. In general, physicians were regulated by specific schools that acted as trade guilds, often with many competing schools based on differing gods, methods, and mystical beliefs.\n\nSome cultures equated cleanliness with godliness and associated hygiene with religious beliefs and practices. Chinese, Egyptian, Hebrew, Indian, and Incan societies all provided sanitary amenities as part of the religious belief system and took measures to provide water, sewerage, and drainage systems. These measures allowed for successful urban settlement and reinforced the beliefs upon which such practices were based. Technical achievements in providing hygiene at the community level slowly coevolved with urban society.\n\nChinese practice in the twenty-first to eleventh centuries BCE included digging wells for drinking water; from the eleventh to the seventh centuries this included the use of protective measures for drinking water and destruction of rats and rabid animals. In the second century BCE, Chinese communities were using sewers and latrines. The basic concept of health was that of countervailing forces between the principles of yin (female) and yang (male), with an emphasis on a balanced lifestyle. Medical care emphasized diet, herbal medicine, hygiene, massage, and acupuncture.\n\nAncient cities in India were planned with building codes, street paving, and covered sewer drains built of bricks and mortar. Indian medicine originated in herbalism associated with gods. Between 800 and 200 BCE, Ayurvedic medicine developed, and with it, medical schools and “public hospitals”. The ancient Indian way of medical practice, Ayurveda, is the Sanskrit translation of “knowledge of life”. Primarily originating in the Indus Valley, the golden age of ancient Indian medicine began approximately 800 BCE. Personal hygiene, sanitation, and water supply engineering were emphasized in the laws of Manu. Pioneering physicians, supported by Buddhist kings, developed the use of drugs and surgery, and established schools of medicine and public hospitals as part of state medicine. Indian medicine played a leading role throughout Asia between 800 BCE and 400 CE, when major texts on medicine and surgery were written. Among the most valued pieces of ancient Indian writings are those created by Sushruta, a surgeon, and Charaka, a physician, both prominent teachers who ran prestigious schools of medicine. These writings contribute to validating ancient India’s medical history. According to some historians, the teachings of Sushruta and Charaka were passed along to the Romans and Greeks. Despite these advanced medical teachings, with the Mogul invasion of 600 CE, state support declined, and with it, Indian medicine.\n\nIn addition to the ancient Indian medical texts, there is evidence of several ancient Egyptian texts, dating from the years around 1900 BCE. The Kahoun Papyrus, from 1950 BCE, the most ancient scroll, includes three parts: human medicine, veterinary science, and mathematics.\n\nAncient Egyptian intensive agriculture and irrigation practices were associated with widespread parasitic disease. The cities had stone masonry gutters for drainage, and personal hygiene was highly emphasized. Egyptian medicine developed surgical skills and organization of medical care, including specialization and training that greatly influenced the development of Greek medicine. The Ebers Papyrus, written 3400 years ago, gives an extensive description of Egyptian medical science, including the isolation of infected surgical patients. It is recognized as the most extensive and significant of all the known papyri, given the physiological knowledge uncovered. While the first section of the Ebers Papyrus revolves around divine origin and the strength of magic, the latter portions discuss the treatment of medical conditions including digestive diseases, eye diseases, and skin problems. Fractures and painful limbs are also described. The papyrus includes a treatise on the heart and vessels, standing out as only one of many covering anatomy and physiology. The last portion of this important papyrus focuses on surgery, in particular, tumors and abscesses.\n\nThe Hebrew Mosaic law of the five Books of Moses (c. 1000 BCE) stressed prevention of disease through regulation of personal and community hygiene, reproductive and maternal health, isolation of lepers and other “unclean conditions”, and family and personal sexual conduct as part of religious practice. It also laid a basis for medical and public health jurisprudence. Personal and community responsibility for health included a mandatory day of rest, limits on slavery and guarantees of the rights of slaves and workers, protection of water supplies, sanitation of communities and camps, waste disposal, and food protection, all codified in detailed religious obligations. Food regulation prevented use of diseased or unclean animals, and prescribed methods of slaughter improved the possibility of preservation of the meat. While there was an element of viewing illness as a punishment for sin, there was also an ethical and social stress on the value of human life with an obligation to seek and provide care. The Talmudic interpretation of biblical law is the concept of sanctity of human life (Pikuah Nefesh); the saving of a single human life was considered “as if one saved the whole world”, which has been given overriding religious and social roles in community life. A second principle from this source is improving the quality of life on Earth (Tikkun Olam). In this tradition, there is an ethical imperative to achieve a better earthly life for all. The Mosaic Law, which forms the basis for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, codified health behaviors for the individual and for society. These found secular versions in Humanism over recent centuries, which have continued into the modern era as basic concepts in societal values and in practical application in environmental and social hygiene.\n\nIn Cretan and Minoan societies, climate and environment were recognized as playing a role in disease causation. Malaria was related to swampy and lowland areas, and prevention involved planning the location of settlements. Ancient Greece placed high emphasis on healthful living habits in terms of personal hygiene, nutrition, physical fitness, and community sanitation. Hippocrates articulated the clinical methods of observation and documentation and a code of ethics of medical practice. He articulated the relationship between disease patterns and the natural environment (air, water, and places), which dominated epidemiological thinking until the nineteenth century. Preservation of health was seen as a balance of forces: exercise and rest, nutrition and excretion, and recognizing the importance of age and sex variables in health needs. Disease was seen as having inevitable natural causation, and medical care was valued, with the city-states providing free medical services for the poor and for slaves. City officials were appointed to look after public drains and water supply, providing organized sanitary and public health services. Hippocrates gave medicine a rudimentary, scientific, and ethical spirit which lasts to the present time.\n\nAncient Rome adopted much of the Greek philosophy and experience concerning health matters, with high levels of achievement and new innovations in the development of public health. The Romans were extremely skilled in engineering of water supply, sewerage and drainage systems, public baths and latrines, town planning, sanitation of military encampments, and medical care. Roman law also regulated businesses and medical practice. The influence of the Roman Empire resulted in the transfer of these ideas throughout much of Europe and the Middle East. Rome itself had access to clean water via 10 aqueducts supplying ample water for the citizens. Rome also built public drains. By the early first century BCE, the aqueducts made available 600–900 liters per person per day of household water from mountains. Marshlands were drained to reduce endemic malaria. Public baths were built to serve the poor, and fountains were built in private homes for the wealthy. Streets were paved, and organized garbage disposal served the cities.\n\nRoman military medicine included well-designed sanitation systems, food supplies, and surgical services. Roman medicine, based on mystical beliefs and religious rites, with slaves as physicians, developed partly from Greek physicians who brought their skills and knowledge to Rome after the destruction of Corinth in 146 BCE. Training as apprentices, Roman physicians achieved a highly respected role in society. Hospitals and municipal doctors were employed by Roman cities to provide free care to the poor and the slaves, but physicians also engaged in private practice, mostly on retainers to families. Occupational health was described with measures to reduce known risks such as lead exposure, particularly in mining. Commercial weights and measures were standardized and supervised. Rome made important contributions to the public health tradition of sanitation, urban planning, and organized medical care. Galen, Rome’s leading physician, perpetuated the fame of Hippocrates through his medical writings, basing medical assessment on the four humors (sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric, and melancholic). These ideas dominated European medical thought for nearly 1500 years until the advent of modern science.\n\nThe Early Medieval Period (Fifth to Tenth Centuries CE)\n\nThe Roman Empire disappeared as an organized entity following the sacking of Rome in the fifth century CE. The eastern empire survived in Constantinople, with a highly centralized government. Later conquered by the Muslims, it provided continuity for Greek and Roman teachings in health. The western empire integrated Christian and pagan cultures, which viewed disease as punishment for sin. Possession by the devil and witchcraft were accepted as causes of disease. Prayer, penitence, and exorcising witches were accepted means of dealing with health problems. The ensuing period of history was dominated in health, as in all other spheres of human life, by the Christian doctrine institutionalized by the Church. The secular political structure was dominated by feudalism and serfdom, associated with a strong military landowning class in Europe.\n\nChurch interpretation of disease was related to original or acquired sin. Humanity’s destiny was to suffer on Earth and hope for a better life in heaven. The appropriate intervention in this philosophy was to provide comfort and care through the charity of church institutions. The idea of prevention was seen as interfering with the will of God. Monasteries with well-developed sanitary facilities were located on major travel routes and provided hospices for travelers. The monasteries were the sole centers of learning and for medical care. They emphasized the tradition of care of the sick and the poor as a charitable duty of the righteous and initiated hospitals. These institutions provided care and support for the poor, and made efforts to cope with epidemic and endemic disease.\n\nMost physicians were monks guided by Church doctrine and ethics. Medical scholarship was based primarily on the teachings of Galen (131 CE), sustained in Muslim centers of medical learning and later brought to Europe with the return of the Crusades, whose teachings provided the basis of medical teaching until the fifteenth century. Education and knowledge were under clerical dominance. Scholasticism, or the study of what was already written, stultified the development of descriptive or experimental science. The largely rural population of the European medieval world lived with poor nutrition, education, housing, sanitary, and hygienic conditions. Endemic and epidemic diseases resulted in high infant, child, and adult mortality. Commonly, 75 percent of newborns died before the age of five. Maternal mortality was high. Leprosy, malaria, measles, and smallpox were established endemic diseases, along with many other less well-documented infectious diseases.\n\nBetween the seventh and tenth centuries, outside the area of Church domination, Muslim medicine flourished under Islamic rule primarily in Persia, Central Asia and later Baghdad and Cairo. Famous physicians, including the Persian Rhazes (850–c. 932) and the outstanding Islamic Bukhara-born philosopher and physician Ibn Sinna (Avicenna, 980–1037), translated and adapted ancient Greek and Mosaic teachings, adding clinical skills developed in medical academies and hospitals. Piped water supplies were documented in Cairo in the ninth century. Great medical academies were established, including one in Muslim-conquered Spain at Cordova. The Cordova Medical Academy was a principal center for medical knowledge and scholarship prior to the expulsion of Muslims and Jews from Spain in 1492, and the Inquisition. The Academy helped to stimulate European medical thinking and the beginnings of western medical science in anatomy, physiology, and descriptive clinical medicine.\n\nThe Late Medieval Period (Eleventh to Fifteenth Centuries)\n\nIn the later feudal period, ancient Hebraic and Greco-Roman concepts of health were preserved and flourished in the Muslim Empire. The twelfth-century Jewish rabbi–philosopher–physician Moses Maimonides (Rambam), who trained in Cordova and was expelled to Cairo, helped to synthesize Roman, Greek, and Arabic medicine with Mosaic concepts of communicable disease isolation and sanitation.\n\nMonastery hospitals were established between the eighth and twelfth centuries to provide charity and care to ease the suffering of the sick and dying. Monasteries provided centers of literacy, medical care, and the ethic of caring for the sick patient as an act of charity. The monastery hospitals (described in eleventh-century Russia) were gradually supplanted by municipal, voluntary, and guild hospitals developed in the twelfth to sixteenth centuries. By the fifteenth century, Britain had 750 hospitals. Medical care insurance was provided by guilds to its members and their families. Hospitals employed doctors, and the wealthy had access to private doctors.\n\nIn the early Middle Ages, most physicians in Europe were monks, and the medical literature was compiled from ancient sources. In 1131 and 1215, Papal rulings increasingly restricted clerics from doing medical work, thus promoting secular medical practice. In 1224, Emperor Frederick II of Sicily published decrees regulating medical practice, establishing licensing requirements: medical training (3 years of philosophy, 5 years of medicine), 1 year of supervised practice, then examination followed by licensure. Similar ordinances were published in Spain in 1238 and in Germany in 1347.\n\nThe Crusades (1096–1270 CE) exposed Europe to Arabic medical concepts, as well as leprosy. The Hospitallers, a religious order of knights, developed hospitals in Rhodes, Malta, and London to serve returning pilgrims and crusaders. The Muslim world had hospitals, such as Al Mansour in Cairo, available to all as a service provided by the governate. Increasing contact between the Crusaders and the Muslims through war, conquest, cohabitation, and trade introduced Arabic culture and diseases, and revised ancient knowledge of medicine and hygiene.\n\nLeprosy became a widespread disease in Europe, particularly among the poor, during the early Middle Ages, but the problem was severely accentuated during and following the Crusades, reaching a peak during the thirteenth to fourteenth centuries. Isolation in leprosaria was common in Europe. In France alone, there were 2000 leprosaria in the fourteenth century. This disease has caused massive suffering and although leprosy still exists in tropical countries it is gradually disappearing globally. The development of modern antimicrobials has cured millions of leprosy (Hansen’s disease) cases; with early case finding and multidrug therapy, this disease and its disabling and deadly effects are now largely a matter of history.\n\nAs rural serfdom and feudalism declined in Western Europe, cities developed with crowded and unsanitary conditions. Towns and cities were allowed to develop in Europe with royal charters for self-government, primarily located at the sites of former Roman settlements and at river crossings related to trade routes. The Church provided stability in society, but repressed new ideas and imposed its authority particularly via the Inquisition. Established by Pope Gregory in 1231, the Inquisition was renewed and intensified, especially in Spain in 1478 by Pope Sixtus IV, to exterminate heretics, Jews, and anyone seen as a challenge to the accepted Papal dogmas.\n\nUniversities established under royal charters in Paris, Bologna, Padua, Naples, Oxford, Cambridge, and others provided a haven for scholarship outside the realm of the Church. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries there was a burst of creativity in Europe, with inventions including the compass, the mechanical clock, and the loom, with a surge in use of the waterwheel and the windmill. Physical and intellectual exploration opened up with the travels of Marco Polo and the writings of Thomas Aquinas, Roger Bacon, and Dante. Trade, commerce, and travel flourished.\n\nMedical education was widespread in institutions of higher education in many parts of Muslim and other societies. Medical schools in Europe evolved in Salerno, Italy, in the tenth century and in universities throughout Europe in the eleventh to fifteenth centuries: in Paris (1110), Bologna (1158), Oxford (1167), Montpellier (1181), Cambridge (1209), Padua (1222), Toulouse (1233), Seville (1254), Prague (1348), Krakow (1364), Vienna (1365), Heidelberg (1386), Glasgow (1451), Basel (1460), and Copenhagen (1478). By the end of the fifteenth century there were around 80 universities in Europe. Printed books opened a new potential for secular as well as religious education. Physicians, recruited from the new middle class, were trained in scholastic traditions based on translations of Arabic literature and the ancient Roman and Greek texts, mainly Aristotle, Hippocrates, and Galen, but with some more current texts, mainly written by Arab and Jewish physicians.\n\nGrowth exacerbated public health problems in the newly walled commercial and industrial towns, leading to eventual emergencies which demanded solutions. Rapidly growing medieval towns lacked systems of sewers or water pipes. Garbage and human waste were thrown into the streets. Houses were made of wood, mud, and dung. Rats, lice, and fleas flourished in the rushes or straw used on the clay floors of people’s houses.\n\nCrowding, poor nutrition and sanitation, lack of adequate water sources and drainage, unpaved streets, keeping of animals in towns, and lack of organized waste disposal created conditions for widespread infectious diseases. Municipalities developed protected water sites (cisterns, wells, and springs) and public fountains with municipal regulation and supervision. Piped community water supplies were developed in Dublin, Basel, and Bruges (Belgium) in the thirteenth century. Between the eleventh and fifteenth centuries, Novgorod in Russia used clay and wooden pipes for water supplies, and municipal bath houses were available.\n\nMedical care was still largely oriented towards symptom relief, with few curative resources to draw upon. Traditional folk medicine survived especially in rural areas, but was suppressed by the Church as witchcraft. Physicians provided services for those able to pay, but medical knowledge was a mix of pragmatism and mysticism, and there was a sheer lack of scientific knowledge. Conditions were ripe for vast epidemics of smallpox, cholera, measles, and other epidemic diseases, fanned by the debased conditions of life and chronic banditry, warfare, and famines raging throughout Europe, such as during the English invasion of France during the Hundred Years War (1337–1453).\n\nThe Black Death, mainly pneumonic and bubonic plague due to Yersinia pestis infection transmitted by fleas on rodents, was brought from the steppes of Central Asia to Europe with the Mongol invasions, and then transmitted via extensive trade routes throughout Europe by sea and overland. The Black Death was also introduced to China with Mongol invasions, bringing tremendous mortality, halving the population of China between 1200 and 1400 CE. Between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries, during the Mongol–Tatar conquests, many widespread epidemics, including plague, were recorded in Rus (now Russia). The plagues traveled rapidly with armies and caravan traders, and later by ship as world trade expanded in the fourteenth to fifteenth centuries (Box 1.1 ). The plague ravaged most of Europe between 1346 and 1350, killing between 24 and 50 million people, approximately one-third of the population, and leaving vast areas of Europe sparsely populated. Despite local efforts to prevent disease by quarantine and isolation of the sick, the disease devastated whole communities.\n\nBOX 1.1\n\n\"Rumors of a terrible plague supposedly arising in China and spreading through Tartary (Central Asia) to India and Persia, Mesopotamia, Syria, Egypt and all of Asia Minor had reached Europe in 1346. They told of a death toll so devastating that all of India was said to be depopulated, whole territories covered by dead bodies, other areas with no one left alive. As added up by Pope Clement VI at Avignon, the total of reported dead reached 23,840,000. In the absence of a concept of contagion, no serious alarm was felt in Europe until the trading ships brought their black burden of pestilence into Messina while other infected ships from the Levant carried it to Genoa and Venice. By January 1348 it penetrated France via Marseille, and North Africa via Tunis. Ship-borne along coasts and navigable rivers, it spread westward from Marseille through the ports of Languedoc to Spain and northward up the Rhone to Avignon, where it arrived in March. It reached Narbonne, Montpellier, Carcassone, and Toulouse between February and May, and at the same time in Italy spread to Rome and Florence and their hinterlands. Between June and August it reached Bordeaux, Lyon, and Paris, spread to Burgundy and Normandy into southern England. From Italy during the summer it crossed the Alps into Switzerland and reached eastward to Hungary. In a given area the plague accomplished its kill within four to six months and then faded, except in the larger cities, where, rooting into the close-quartered population, it abated during the winter, only to appear in spring and rage for another six months.\"\n\nSource: Tuchman BW. A distant mirror: the calamitous fourteenth century. New York: Alfred A. Knopf; 1978.\n\nFear of a new and deadly disease, lack of knowledge, speculation, and rumor led to countermeasures which often exacerbated the spread of epidemics (as seen in the last decades of the twentieth century, and in the twenty-first century, with SARS and pandemic H1N1 influenza). In Western Europe, public and religious ceremonies and burials were promoted by religious and civil authorities, which increased contact with infected people. The misconception that cats were the cause of plague led to their slaughter; however, they could have helped to stem the tide of disease brought by rats and their fleas to humans. Hygienic practices limited the spread of plague in Jewish ghettos, leading to the Jews being blamed for the plague’s spread, and widespread massacres, especially in Germany and Central Europe.\n\nSeaport cities in the fourteenth century began to apply the biblical injunction to separate lepers by keeping ships coming from places with the plague waiting in remote parts of the harbor, initially for 30 days (treutina), then for 40 days (quarantina) (Ragusa in 1465, and Venice in 1485), establishing the public health act of quarantine as a government measure, which on a pragmatic basis was found to reduce the chance of entry of the plague. Towns along major overland trading routes in Russia took measures to restrict movement in homes, streets, and entire towns during epidemics. In sixteenth-century Russia, Novgorod banned public funerals during plague epidemics, and in the seventeenth century, Czar Boris Godunov banned trade, prohibited religious and other ceremonies, and instituted quarantine-type measures. All over Europe, municipal efforts to enforce isolation broke down as crowds gathered and were uncontrolled by inadequate police forces and public health. In 1630, all officers of the Board of Health of Florence, Italy, were excommunicated because of efforts to prevent spread of the contagion by isolation of cases, thereby interfering with religious ceremonies to assuage God’s wrath through appeals to divine providence.\n\nThe plague continued to strike, with epidemics in London in 1665, Marseille in 1720, Moscow in 1771, and Russia, India, and the Middle East through the nineteenth century. Furthermore, the plague continued into the twentieth century with epidemics in Australia (1900), China (1911), Egypt (1940), and India (1995). (See The Plague, a historical novel by Albert Camus.) The disease is endemic in rodents in many parts of the world, including the USA; however, modern sanitation, pest control, and antibiotic treatment have greatly reduced the potential for large-scale plague epidemics.\n\nGuilds organized to protect the economic interests of traders and skilled craftsmen, and limited competition by regulating training and entry requirements of new members. They also placed high priority on mutual benefit funds to provide financial assistance and other benefits for illness, death, widows and orphans, and medical care, as well as burial benefits for members and their families. The guilds wielded strong political power during the late Middle Ages. These brotherhoods provided a tradition later expressed in the mutual benefit or friendly societies, sick funds, and insurance for health care based on employment groups. This tradition has continued in western countries, where labor unions are among the leading advocates for the health of workers and their families.\n\nThe fourteenth century saw a devastation of the population of Europe by plague, wars, and the breakdown of feudal society. It also set the stage for the agricultural revolution and later the industrial revolution. The period following the Black Death was innovative and dynamic. Shortages of farm laborers led to innovations in agriculture. Enclosures of common grazing land reduced the spread of disease among animals, increased field crop productivity, and improved sheep farming, leading to the development of the wool and textile industries and the search for energy sources, industrialization, and international markets.\n\nThe Renaissance (1400–1600s)\n\nCommerce, industry, trade, merchant fleets, and voyages of discovery to seek new markets led to the development of a moneyed middle class and wealthy cities. During this period, mines, foundries, and industrial plants flourished, creating new goods and wealth. Partly as a result of the trade generated and the increased movement of goods and people, vast epidemics of syphilis, typhus, smallpox, measles, and the plague continued to spread across Europe. Malaria was still widespread throughout Europe. Rickets, scarlet fever, and scurvy, particularly among sailors, were rampant. Pollution and crowding in industrial areas resulted in centuries-long epidemics of environmental disease, particularly among the urban working class.\n\nA virulent form of syphilis, allegedly brought back from America by the crews of Columbus, spread rapidly throughout Europe between 1495 and 1503, when it was first described by Girolamo Fracastoro (1478–1553). Control measures tried in various cities included examination and registration of prostitutes, closure of communal bath houses, isolation in special hospitals, reporting of disease, and expulsion of sick prostitutes or strangers. The disease gradually decreased in virulence, but it lingers as a diminishing public health problem to the present time.\n\nThe Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453 resulted in the westward movement of many Greek thinkers and the end of the Hundred Years War brought stability to north-west Europe. In Europe, the growth of cities with commerce and industrialization and the massive influx of the rural poor brought the focus of public health needs to the doorsteps of municipal governments. The breakdown of feudalism, the decline of the monasteries, and the land enclosures dispossessed the rural poor. Municipal and voluntary organizations increasingly developed hospitals, replacing those previously run by monastic orders. In 1601, the British Elizabethan Poor Laws defined the local parish government as being responsible for the health and social well-being of the poor, a system later brought to the New World by British colonists. Municipal control of sanitation was weak. Each citizen was in theory held responsible for cleaning his part of the street, but hygienic standards were low, with animal and human waste freely accumulating.\n\nDuring the Renaissance, the sciences of anatomy, physiology, chemistry, microscopy, and clinical medicine opened medicine to a scientific base. Medical schools in universities developed affiliations with hospitals, promoting clinical observation with increasing precision in the description of disease. The contagion theory of disease, described in 1546 by Fracastorus and later the German–Swiss physician Paracelsus (Phillipus von Hohenheim, 1493–1541), including the terms infection and disinfection, was contrary to the until-then sacrosanct miasma teachings of Galen.\n\nIn Russia, Czar Ivan IV (Ivan the Terrible) (1530–1584) in the sixteenth century arranged to hire a court physician of Queen Elizabeth I, who brought with him to Moscow a group of physicians and pharmacists to serve the court. The Russian army had a tradition of regimental doctors. In the mid-seventeenth century, the czarist administration developed pharmacies in major centers throughout the country for military and civilian needs, and established a State Pharmacy Department to control pharmacies and medications, education of doctors, military medicine, quarantine, forensic medicine, and medical libraries. Government revenues from manufacturing, sale, and promotion of vodka provided for these services. Preparation of military doctors (Lekars) with 5–7 years of training was instituted in 1654. Hospitals were mainly provided by monasteries, serving both civilian and military needs. In 1682, the first civic hospital was opened in Moscow, and in the same year, two hospitals were opened, also in Moscow, by the central government for the care of patients and training of Lekars.\n\nFrom 1538, parish registers of christenings and burials were published in England as weekly and annual abstracts, known as the Bills of Mortality. Beginning in 1629, national annual Bills of Mortality included tabulation of death by cause. On the basis of the Bills of Mortality, novelist Daniel Defoe described the plague epidemic of London of 1665 over 60 years later (A Journal of the Plague Year, Daniel Defoe, 1722).\n\nIn England in 1662, John Graunt published Natural and Political Observations Upon the Bills of Mortality. He compiled and interpreted mortality figures by inductive reasoning, demonstrating the regularity of certain social and vital phenomena. He showed statistical relationships between mortality and living conditions. Graunt’s work was important because it was the first instance of statistical analysis of mortality data, providing a foundation for the use of health statistics in the planning of health services. It established the sciences of demography and vital statistics and methods of analysis, providing basic measurements for health status evaluation with mortality rates by age, sex, and location. Also in 1662, William Petty took the first census in Ireland. In addition, he studied statistics on the supply of physicians and hospitals.\n\nEnlightenment, Science, and Revolution (1600s–1800s)\n\nThe Enlightenment, a dynamic period of social, economic, and political thought, provided great impetus for political and social emancipation and rapid advances in science and agriculture, technology, and industrial power. Changes in many spheres of life were exemplified by the American and French Revolutions, along with the economic theory of Adam Smith (author of The Wealth of Nations), which developed the political and economic rights of the individual.\n\nIn this influential and notable era, it became evident that advanced ideas and new ways of thinking could materialize into practical, tangible objects. This is exemplified by the development of microscopy, invented in 1676, as a tool that provided a method for the study of microorganisms (Box 1.2 ).\n\nBOX 1.2\n\nOf the many important medical and scientific discoveries, the creation of the microscope provides a crucial tool for the development of modern science applied to biological and medical progress. It has influenced the way in which scientists study, identify, diagnose, treat, and prevent diseases that have so greatly plagued and limited human life in the past.\n\nThe first compound microscope was created by Zacharias Janson and his father, Dutch spectacle-makers who experimented with lenses in 1595. They placed lenses in a tube, and noted that the object examined looked substantially enlarged. Robert Hooke (1635–1703) in England and Jan Swammerdam in the Netherlands built compound microscopes and made important discoveries with them. Hooke’s book Micrographia, published in 1665, showed his compound microscope and illumination system, one of the best such microscopes of his time, and demonstrated at the Royal Society’s meetings, with observations of insects, sponges, plant cells, fossils, and bird feathers.\n\nHowever, credit for invention of the microscope and its medical use is given to Anton van Leeuwenhoek (1632–1723), a Dutch scientist and draper, who attained great success by creating efficient, better functioning lenses. His skill in grinding and polishing lenses provided remarkably high magnifying power. He was the first to see and describe bacteria (1674), yeast plants, the teeming life in a drop of water, and the circulation of blood corpuscles in capillaries. In 1678, after Leeuwenhoek had written to the Royal Society with a report of discovering “little animals” – bacteria and protozoa – Hooke was asked by the Society to confirm Leeuwenhoek’s findings. He did so, paving the way for the wide acceptance of Leeuwenhoek’s discoveries.\n\nThe initial scientific discoveries founded upon microscopy pertained to the circulating blood, microbiological organisms, and tissue cellular structure. As models of microscopes advanced, new capabilities were made possible so that more minute samples could be investigated for vital discoveries throughout the microbiological revolution. Subsequently, cellular structure opened up for scientific research with further advances such as the electron microscope.\n\nObservations and new discoveries made through use of a microscope have shaped how we view disease, cellular processes, microorganisms, and the building blocks of life. From scientists investigating nerve cell function, to Koch studying bacilli responsible for tuberculosis infection, and Pasteur observing microbes as foreign organisms, the microscope has provided one of the key technological contributions to medical and health sciences of all time.\n\nSources:Nobelprize.org.

Bernardino Ramazzini published the first modern comprehensive treatise on occupational diseases in 1700.\n\nIn Russia, Peter the Great (1682–1725) initiated political, cultural, and health reforms. He sent young aristocrats to study sciences and technology, including medicine, in Western Europe. He established the first hospital-based medical school in St. Petersburg and subsequently in other centers as well, mainly to train military doctors. He established the Anatomical Museum of the Imperial Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg in 1717, and initiated a census of males for military service in 1722. In 1724, V. N. Tatishev carried out a survey by questionnaire of all regions of the Russian empire regarding epidemic disease and methods of treatment.\n\nImprovements in agriculture created greater productivity and better nutrition. These were associated with higher birth rates and falling death rates, leading to rapid population growth. The agricultural revolution during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, based on mechanization and larger land units of production with less labor, was associated with rural depopulation and provided excess workers to staff the factories, mines, ships, home construction, and shops of the industrial revolution. Other significant achievements of the agricultural revolution included expanding commerce and nourishing a growing middle class. Exploration and colonization provided the expansion of markets that fueled the industrial revolution, and stimulated the growth of science, technology, and wealth.\n\nColonization also contributed to the agricultural revolution through the introduction of new crops from the Americas, including the potato, the tomato, peppers, and maize. Thus, in addition to the new crops, animal husbandry, improved land use, and farm machinery all contributed to a general improvement in food security and nutrition. This was supplemented by increasing availability of cod from the Grand Banks of the Atlantic, adding protein to the common diet.\n\nIndustrialized urban centers grew rapidly. Crowded cities were ill-equipped to house and provide services for the growing working class. Urban areas suffered from crowding, poor housing, sanitation, poor nutrition, and harsh working conditions, which together produced appalling health conditions. During this period, documentation and statistical analysis developed in various forms, becoming the basis for social sciences including demography and epidemiology. Intellectual movements of the eighteenth century defined the rights of man and gave rise to revolutionary movements to promote liberty and release from tyrannical rule, as in the American and French Revolutions of 1775 and 1789, respectively. Following the final defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815, conservative governments were faced with strong middle-class movements for reform of social conditions, with important implications for health.\n\nEighteenth-Century Reforms\n\nThe period of enlightenment and reason was led by philosophers John Locke, Diderot, Voltaire, Rousseau, and others. These men produced a new approach to science and knowledge derived from observations and systematic testing and philosophical debate of ideas as opposed to instinctive or innate knowledge as the basis for human progress. The newness of the enlightenment was the idea of progress, Sapere Aude [dare to know and “have courage to use your own understanding!”], as the motto of enlightenment. The idea of the rights of man contributed to the American and French Revolutions, but also to a widening belief that society was obliged to serve all rather than just the privileged. This had a profound impact on approaches to health and societal issues.\n\nThe late eighteenth century was a period of growth and development of clinical medicine, surgery, and therapeutics, as well as of the sciences of chemistry, physics, physiology, and anatomy. From the 1750s onward, voluntary hospitals were established in major urban centers in Britain, America, and Eurasia. Medical–social reform involving hospitals, prisons, and lazarettos (leprosy hospitals) in Britain, led by John Howard (On the State of Prisons, published in 1777), produced substantive improvements in these institutions. Following the French Revolution, Philippe Pinel (1745–1826) was instrumental in the development of a more humane psychological approach to the custody and care of psychiatric patients. He fostered reform of insane asylums by removing the chains from patients at the Bicetre Mental Hospital and later Hospice de la Salpêtrière near Paris. Pinel made notable contributions to the classification of mental disorders, and he is often identified as the “father of modern psychiatry”. Reforms in this field were also carried out in Britain by the Society of Friends (the Quakers), who built the York Retreat, providing humane care as an alternative to the inhuman conditions of the York Asylum.\n\nIn 1700, Bernardino Ramazzini (1633–1714) published a monumental piece on occupational diseases (Diseases of Workers), applying epidemiological principles and highlighting specific health hazards. These occupational risks included exposure to chemicals, dust, and metals, as well as musculoskeletal injury from unnatural postures and repetitive or violent motions. In his publication, he described other various disease-causative agents encountered by workers in 52 major occupations. Considered to be the “father of occupational medicine”, Ramazzini established the basis for this field, although progress in the application of his views was slow. Despite the reluctance to apply his beliefs, the latter part of the century fostered interest in the health of sailors and soldiers, which led to important developments in military and naval medicine. Studies of prevalent diseases were carried out by pioneering physicians among workers in various trades, such as metalworkers, bakers, shoemakers, and hatmakers. Deeper understanding of these trades and the risks involved allowed for the identification of causative agents, and thus methods of prevention. The observational studies of Percivall Pott (1714–1789) identified scrotal cancer as an occupational hazard of chimney sweeps (1775). In 1767, George Baker (1722–1809) studied Devonshire colic, acquired from lead poisoning in cider production. Each of these and other similar studies helped to lay the basis for the development of investigative epidemiology.\n\nPioneers and supporting movements successfully agitated for reform in Britain through the parliamentary system. The anti-gin movement, aided by the popular newspapers (the “Penny Press”) and the brilliant engravings of William Hogarth (1697–1764), helped to bring about legal, social, and police reforms in English townships. The reform spirit also produced an effective antislavery movement led by Protestant Christian churches, which goaded the British government to ban slavery in 1797 and the slave trade in 1807. This was achieved using the Royal Navy to sweep the slave trade from the seas during the early part of the nineteenth century.\n\nApplied Epidemiology\n\nScurvy (the Black Death of the Sea) was a major health problem among sailors during long voyages. In 1498, Vasco da Gama (1460s–1524) lost 55 crewmen to scurvy during his voyages. Moreover, in 1535, Jacques Cartier’s (1491–1557) crew suffered severely from scurvy on his voyage of discovery to Canada. During the sixteenth century, Dutch sailors knew of the value of fresh vegetables and citrus fruit in preventing scurvy.\n\nSamuel Purchas (1577–1626) in 1601 and John Woodall (a British naval doctor, 1570–1643) in 1617 recommended the use of lemons and oranges in the treatment of scurvy, but this was not widely practiced. During the seventeenth to eighteenth centuries, Russian military practice included antiscorbutic preparations, and the use of sauerkraut for this purpose became common in European armies. Scurvy was a major cause of sickness and death among sailors when supplies of fruit and vegetables ran out, thus significantly limiting long voyages and contributing to frequent mutinies at sea.\n\nConditions for sailors in the British navy improved following the explorations of Captain James Cook during the period 1766–1779. As mentioned in Box 1.3 , a British naval squadron of seven ships and nearly 2000 men led by Commodore George Anson left Plymouth to circumnavigate the globe in 1740–1744. The squadron returned to England comprised of only one ship and 145 men, after losing the majority of the crews to scurvy. In 1747, James Lind carried out his pioneering epidemiological investigation on scurvy among sailors on long voyages. His work led to the adoption of lemon or lime juice as a routine nutrition supplement for British sailors some 50 years later. Vitamins were not understood or isolated until almost 150 years later; however, Lind’s scientific technique of hypothesis formulation, study design, careful observation and testing, followed by documentation and publication, was exceptional and monumental. This established the investigation of nutrition in public health in what is now recognized as the first clinical trial and epidemiological investigation.\n\nBOX 1.3\n\nCaptain James Lind (1716–1794), a physician serving in Britain’s Royal Navy, developed a hypothesis explaining the cause of scurvy, founded upon clinical observations in what is currently regarded as the first clinical epidemiological study. It was the tragedy of Admiral Anson’s expedition of circumnavigation, with the deaths of 380 men out of a crew of 510 on one of his ships, which led to Lind’s interest in investigating scurvy.\n\nIn May 1747, on HMS Salisbury, Lind conducted his study by treating 12 sailors who had fallen sick to scurvy. He gave each sailor one of six different dietary regimens. The two sailors who were fed oranges and lemons recovered from their illness and were fit for duty within 6 days. This is in contrast to all of the other sailors, who were given different treatments, and consequently, remained sick. Lind concluded that citrus fruits would treat and prevent scurvy. In 1753, he published A treatise of the scurvy: in three parts. Containing an inquiry into the nature, causes and cure of that disease together with a critical and chronological view of what has been published on the subject.\n\nLind reported: “Scurvy began to rage after being a month or six weeks at sea … the water on board … was uncommonly sweet and good [and] provisions such as could afford no suspicion … yet, at the expiration of ten weeks, we brought into Plymouth 80 men, out of a complement of 350, more or less afflicted with the diseases\". Captain Lind observed during his experiment that: “the most sudden and visible good effects were perceived from the use of oranges and lemons”, and that in a short time this group was fit for duty, whereas all the other groups remained ill. He concluded that: “experience indeed sufficiently shows that as green or fresh vegetables with ripe fruit were the best remedies for it [i.e., scurvy], so they prove the most effectual preservatives against it”, and that oranges are “the most effectual preservatives against the distemper\".\n\nScurvy was eliminated in the Royal Navy by the end of the eighteenth century, but continued to plague merchant seaman during most of the nineteenth century until compulsory lime juice was imposed and steam ships led to shortened voyage times.\n\nSources: Carpenter KJ.

In 1795, the Royal Navy adopted routine issuance of lime juice to sailors to prevent scurvy. This measure effectively doubled the fighting strength of the Royal Navy by extending the capacity to remain longer at sea with a healthy crew. This was crucial during the Napoleonic wars of 1797–1814, so that “Lind as much as Nelson, broke the power of Napoleon”. Lind also instigated reforms in living conditions for sailors, thus contributing to improvements in their health and fitness and the functioning of the fleet. The inquiries following the Spithead mutiny of 1797 led to the adoption of Lind’s nutrition and health recommendations in the same year. In 1798, the USA developed the Marine Hospitals Service for treatment and quarantine of sailors, which later became the US Public Health Service.\n\nJenner and Vaccination\n\nSmallpox, a devastating and disfiguring epidemic disease, ravaged all parts of the world and had been recognized since the third century BCE. Described first by Rhazes in the tenth century, the disease was confused with measles and was widespread in Asia, the Middle East, and Europe during the Middle Ages. It was a designated cause of death in the Bills of Mortality in 1629 in London. Epidemics of smallpox occurred throughout the seventeenth to eighteenth and into the nineteenth centuries. Primarily a disease of childhood, mortality rates were 25 to 40 percent or more and the disease was characterized by disfiguring sequelae.\n\nSmallpox was a key factor in the near elimination of the Aztec and other societies in Central and South America following the Spanish invasion. Traditions of prevention of this disease by inoculation or transmission of the disease to healthy people to prevent them from acquiring a more virulent form during epidemics were reported in ancient China. This practice, called variolation, was first brought to England in 1721 by Lady Mary Montagu, wife of the British ambassador to Constantinople, where it was common practice. It was widely adopted in England in the mid-eighteenth century, when the disease affected millions of people in Europe. Catherine the Great of Russia had her son inoculated by variolation by a leading English practitioner.\n\nEdward Jenner (1749–1823) was the first to use vaccination with cowpox to prevent smallpox in 1796 (Box 1.4 ), initiating one of the most dramatically successful endeavors of public health. This revolutionary experiment culminated in the eventual eradication of this dreaded killing and disfiguring disease some 200 years later. In 1800, vaccination was adopted by the British armed forces, and the practice spread to Europe, the Americas, and the British Empire. Denmark made vaccination mandatory in the early nineteenth century and soon eradicated smallpox locally. Despite some professional opposition, the practice spread rapidly from the upper classes and voluntary groups to the common people as a result of the fear of becoming infected with smallpox. Vaccination later became compulsory in many countries, leading to the ultimate public health achievement: global eradication of smallpox in the late twentieth century.\n\nBOX 1.4\n\nVariolation, or the exposure of people to the pustular matter of cases of smallpox, was originally documented in ancient China in 320 CE. This practice was used widely in the eighteenth century as a lucrative medical practice, and was a powerful tool in protecting armies from the ravages of smallpox. Variolation was made mandatory by George Washington in the Continental Army during the American Revolution.\n\nIn 1796, Edward Jenner (1749–1823), a country physician in Gloucestershire, England, investigated local folklore that milkmaids were immune to smallpox because of their exposure to cowpox. He took matter from a cowpox pustule on a milkmaid, Sarah Nelmes, and applied it with scratches to the skin of a young boy named James Phipps. This inoculated the boy with smallpox, and in turn, he did not develop the disease. Jenner’s 1798 publication, An enquiry into the causes and effects of the variolae vaccinia, described his widescale vaccination and its successful protection against smallpox. Jenner prophesied that “the annihilation of the smallpox, the most dreadful scourge of the human species, must be the result of this practice\". He then developed vaccination as a method to replace variolation.\n\nOpposition to vaccination was intense, and Jenner’s contribution was ignored by the scientific and medical establishment of the day, but he was later rewarded by Parliament. Vaccination was adopted as a universal practice by the British military in 1800 and by Denmark in 1803. A critical public health tool, vaccination became an increasingly widespread practice during the nineteenth century. In 1977, the last case of smallpox was identified; thus, smallpox eradication was declared by the World Health Organization in 1980.\n\nRemaining stocks of the virus in the USA and Russia were to be destroyed in 1999. However, this was delayed, and following the 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers in New York City, the threat of bioterrorism was taken seriously, including the possibility of use of smallpox. Consequently, vaccination was reinstated for “first responders” including fire, police, and hospital staff in the USA and other countries.\n\nSources: Riedel S.

Birth and death rates form the foundation of demography, which is fundamental to epidemiology, a discipline which utilizes demography, sociology, and statistics. Churches maintained registries of births and deaths, and compulsory registration with local government was adopted in the UK in 1853.\n\nStatistical and epidemiological methods emerged in the early seventeenth century with inductive reasoning put forward by Francis Bacon and applied by Robert Boyle in chemistry, Isaac Newton in physics, William Petty in economics, and John Graunt in demography. Bacon’s writing inspired a whole generation of scientists in different fields and led to the founding of the Royal Society of London in 1660.\n\nIn Russia, in 1722, Peter the Great began a system of registration of births of male infants for military purposes. In 1755, Mikhail Vasilyevich Lomonosov (1711–1765) was central in establishing the study of demography, carrying out surveys and studies of birth statistics, infant mortality, quality of medical care, alcoholism, and workers’ health. He brought the results of these studies to the government’s attention, which led to improved training of doctors and midwives, as well as epidemic control measures. Lomonosov also helped to set up the medical faculty of Moscow University (1765).\n\nDaniel Bernoulli (1700–1782), a member of a European family of mathematicians, constructed life tables based on available data showing that variolation against smallpox conferred lifelong immunity and vaccination at birth increased life expectancy. Following the French Revolution, health statistics flourished in the mid-nineteenth century in the work of Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis (1787–1872), who is considered the founder of modern epidemiology. Louis conducted several important observational studies, including one showing that bloodletting, then a common form of therapy, was ineffective. The importance of Louis’s studies was demonstrated by the decline in this harmful practice. His students included Marc D’Epigne in France, William Farr in Britain, and others in the USA who became the pioneers in spreading la méthode numérique in medicine. The Lancet, one of the oldest, best known, and most respected medical journals, was founded in 1823 by Thomas Wakely, an English surgeon, and its creation played an important role in promoting statistical analysis in medical sciences.\n\nHealth statistics for social and public health reform took an important place in the work of Edwin Chadwick (1800–1890), Lemuel Shattuck (1793–1859), and Florence Nightingale (1820–1910). Recognizing the extraordinary significance of accurate statistical information in health planning and disease prevention, Edwin Chadwick’s work led to legislation establishing the Registrar-General’s Office of Britain in 1836. William Farr became its director-general and placed the focus of the office on public health. Farr’s analysis of mortality in Liverpool, for example, showed that barely half of its native-born lived to their sixth birthday, whereas in England, the overall median age at death was 45 years. As a result, Parliament passed the Liverpool Sanitary Act of 1846, creating a legislated sanitary code, a medical officer of health position, and a local health authority.\n\nIn 1842 in Boston, Massachusetts, Lemuel Shattuck initiated a statewide registration of vital statistics, which later became a model elsewhere in the USA. His report was a landmark in the evolution of public health administration and planning. It provided a detailed account of data collection by age, sex, race, and occupation, and uniform nomenclature for causes of diseases and death. He emphasized the importance of a routine system for exchanging data and information. The London Epidemiological Society, founded in 1850, became an active investigative and lobbying group for public health action. Its work on smallpox led to the passage of the Vaccination Act of 1853, establishing compulsory vaccination in the UK.\n\nIn the later part of the nineteenth century, Florence Nightingale highlighted the value of a hospital discharge information system. She promoted the collection and use of statistics that could be derived from the records of patients treated in hospitals. Her work led to marked improvements in the management and design of hospitals, military medicine, and nursing as a profession.\n\nSocial Reform and the Sanitary Movement (1830–1875)\n\nFollowing the English Civil War in 1646, veterans of the Parliamentary Army called on the government to provide free schools and free medical care throughout the country as part of democratic reform. However, they failed to sustain interest or gain support for their revolutionary ideas amidst postwar religious conflicts and restoration of the monarchy.\n\nIn Russia, the role of the state in health was promoted following initiatives of Peter the Great to introduce western medicine to the country. During the rule of Catherine the Great, under the supervision of Count Orlov, an epidemic of plague in Moscow (1771–1772) was suppressed by incentive payments to bring the sick for care. In 1784, a Russian physician, I. L. Danilevsky, defended a doctoral dissertation on “Government power – the best doctor”. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, reform movements promoted health initiatives by government. Although these movements were suppressed (the Decembrists, 1825–1830) and liberal reform steps reversed, their ideas influenced later reforms in Russia.\n\nFollowing the revolution in France, the Constituent Assembly established a Health Commission. A national assistance program for indigents was established. Steps were taken to strengthen the Bureaux de Sante (Offices of Health) of municipalities which had previously dealt primarily with epidemics. In 1802, the Paris Bureau addressed a wide range of public health concerns, including sanitation, food control, health statistics, occupational health, first aid, and medical care issues. The other major cities of France followed with similar programs over the next 20 years, and in 1848 a central national health authority was established. Child welfare services were also developed in France in the middle part of the nineteenth century. The reporting of vital statistics became reliable in the German states and even more so in France, fostering the development of epidemiological analysis of causes of death.\n\nThe governmental approach to public health was articulated by Johann Peter Franck for the Germanic states in his monumental series of books, A Complete System of Medical Police (1779–1817). This text explained the government’s role in states with strong central governments and how to achieve health reform through administrative action. State regulations were to govern public health and personal health practices including marriage, procreation, and pregnancy. He promoted dental care, rest following obstetric delivery, maternity benefits, school health, food hygiene, housing standards, sanitation, sewage disposal, and clean water supplies. In this system, municipal authorities were responsible for keeping cities and towns clean and for monitoring vital statistics, military medicine, venereal diseases, hospitals, and communicable disease.\n\nThis system emphasized a strong, even authoritarian role of the state in promoting public health, including provision of prepaid medical care. It was a comprehensive and coherent approach to public health, emphasizing the key roles of municipal and higher levels of government. This work was influential in Russia, where Franck spent the years 1805–1807 as director of the St. Petersburg Medical Academy. Because of its primary reliance on authoritarian governmental roles, however, this approach was resisted in most western countries, especially following the collapse of absolutist government ideas following the Napoleonic period.\n\nMunicipal (voluntary) boards of health were established in some British and American cities in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. A Central Board of Health was established in Britain in 1805, primarily to govern quarantine regulations to prevent the entry of yellow fever and cholera into the country. Town life improved as sanitation, paving, lighting, sewers, iron water pipes, and water filtration were introduced. Despite the progress, organization for the development of such services was inadequate. Multiple agencies and private water companies provided unsupervised and overlapping services. London City Corporation had nearly 100 paving, lighting, and cleansing boards, 172 welfare boards, and numerous other health-related authorities in 1830. These were later consolidated into the London Board of Works in 1855.\n\nIn Great Britain, early nineteenth-century reforms were stimulated by the Philosophic Radicals led by Jeremy Bentham, who advocated dealing with public problems in a rational and scientific way, initiating a reform movement utilizing parliamentary, legal, and educational means. Economic and social philosophers in Britain, including Adam Smith and Jeremy Bentham, argued for liberalism, rationalism, free trade, political rights, and social reform, all contributing to “the greatest good for the greatest number”. Labor law reforms (the Mines and the Factory Acts) banned children and women from underground work in the mines and regulated reduction in the workday to 10 hours. These reforms were adopted by the British Parliament in the 1830s to 1840s. The spread of railroads and steamships, the Penny Post (1840), and telegraphs (1846), combined with growing literacy and compulsory primary education introduced in Britain in 1876, dramatically altered local and world communication.\n\nThe British Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834 replaced the old Elizabethan Poor Laws, shifting responsibility for welfare of the poor from the local parish to the central government’s Poor Law Commission. The parishes were unable to cope with the needs of the rural poor, whose condition was deteriorating with loss of land rights due to agricultural innovations and enclosures. Losing strength, the old system was breaking down, and the new industrialization needed workers, miners, sailors, and soldiers. The new conditions forced the poor to move from rural areas to the growing industrial towns. The urban poor suffered or were forced into workhouses while resistance to reform led to more radicalization and unsuccessful revolution, followed by deep political conservatism.\n\nDeteriorating housing, sanitation, and work conditions in Britain in the 1830s resulted in rising mortality rates recorded in the Bills of Mortality. Industrial cities like Manchester (1795) had established voluntary boards of health, but they lacked the authority to alter fundamental conditions to control epidemics and urban decay. The boards of health were unable to deal with sewage, garbage, animal control, crowded slum housing, privies, adulterated foods and medicines, industrial polluters, or other social or environmental risk sources. Legislation in the 1830s in Britain and Canada improved the ability of municipalities and boards of health to cope with oversight of community water supplies and sanitation.\n\nUnder pressure from reformists and the Health of Towns Association, the British government commissioned Edwin Chadwick to undertake a study, which led to the Report on the Sanitary Conditions of the Labouring Population of Great Britain (1842), resulting in a further series of reforms through the Poor Law Commission (Box 1.5 ). The British Parliament passed the Health of Towns Act and the Public Health Act of 1848. This established the General Board of Health, mainly to ensure the safety of community water supplies and drainage, establishing municipal boards of health in the major cities and rural local authorities, along with housing legislation and other reforms. Despite setbacks due to reaction to these developments, the basis was laid for the “sanitary revolution”, dealing with urban sanitation and health conditions, as well as cholera, typhoid, and tuberculosis (TB) control.\n\nBOX 1.5\n\nEdwin Chadwick, a Manchester lawyer interested in political and social reform, was a leader in the reform movement in Great Britain. In 1832 he was appointed to a Royal Commission to investigate the revision of the Elizabethan Poor Laws, in effect since 1601, leading to the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834.\n\nIn the 1830s a series of epidemics of cholera, typhoid, and influenza prompted the government to launch an investigation of sanitation. Chadwick, a strong believer in miasma theories, was convinced that measures such as cleaning, drainage and ventilation would make people healthier and thus less dependent on welfare. He was appointed to lead the inquiry and produced the report The Sanitary Conditions of the Labouring Population (1842). In this report, Chadwick used quantitative methods to show a direct link between poor living conditions and disease and life expectancy. This report inspired major efforts by local authorities to improve sanitation, and led to parliamentary adoption of the Public Health Act of 1848 establishing a General Board of Health, which Chadwick led. He was later forced from office and the national Board of Health was abolished; however, local Boards of Health at the municipal and county levels were developed to implement sanitary reform.\n\nAs an advocate of the miasma theory, he was sidelined by the growing strength of the rival germ theory advocates, whose scientific base was growing rapidly in the late nineteenth century. However, Chadwick’s impact on promotion of sanitation and emphasis on the link between poverty and disease gave him a place among the most important pioneers in public health in the nineteenth century. While the miasma and germ theory advocates struggled bitterly for dominance for many years, each played a key role in modern public health.\n\nIn recent years, the association of poor sanitation, poverty, and adverse social conditions with health risk has re-emerged as being of central importance. Both the biomedical and the social hygiene models are seen to be interactive in the Inequalities in Health movement of the twenty-first century, recognizing the multidimensionality of societal and medical interaction to improve health and quality of life.\n\nSources: Science Museum.

A history of public health. Expanded edition. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press; 1993.\n\nIn 1850, the Massachusetts Sanitary Commission, chaired by Lemuel Shattuck, was established to look into similar conditions in the state. Boards of health established earlier in the century became efficiently organized and effective in sanitary reform in the USA. The report of that committee has become a classic public health document. Reissued in the 1970s, it remains a useful model for a comprehensive approach to public health.\n\nThe Chadwick Report in Great Britain (1842) and the Shattuck Report in Massachusetts (1850) promoted the concept of municipal boards of health based on public health law with a public mandate to supervise and regulate community sanitation. This included urban planning, zoning, restriction of animals and industry in residential areas, and regulation of working conditions, setting the basis of public health infrastructure in the English-speaking world and beyond for the next century.\n\nThe interaction between sanitation and social hygiene was a theme promoted by Rudolf Virchow, the founder of cellular pathology and a social–medical philosopher. Virchow was a leading German physician in the mid-nineteenth century. He promoted the ideas of observation, hypothesis, and experimentation, helping to establish the scientific approach to medical issues. He was a social activist and linked the health of the people to social and economic conditions, emphasizing the need for political solutions. Virchow played an important part in the 1848 revolutions in Central and Western Europe, in the same year as the publication of the Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx. These all contributed to growing pressure on governments by workers’ and political movements to promote better living, working, and health conditions in the 1870s. Virchow was an avowed anticontagionist, and his emphasis on and advances made in the social, economic, and political environment were as much a factor in public health progress as the bacteriological discoveries.\n\nThe Massachusetts State Board of Health was established in 1869, and in the same year a Royal Sanitary Commission was appointed in the UK. The American Public Health Association (APHA), established in 1872, served as a professional educational and lobbying group to promote the interests of public health in the USA, often successfully prodding federal, state, and local governments to act in the public interests in this field. The APHA definition of appropriate services at each level of government continues to set standards and guidelines for local health authorities. The organization of local, state, and national public health activities over the twentieth century in the USA owes much to the professional leadership and lobbying skills of the APHA.\n\nMax von Pettenkoffer in 1873 studied the high mortality rates of Munich, comparing them to rapidly declining rates in London. His public lectures on the value of health to a city led to sanitary reforms, which were being achieved in Berlin at the same time under Virchow’s leadership. Pettenkoffer introduced laboratory analysis to public health practice and established the first academic chair in hygiene and public health, emphasizing the scientific basis for public health; he is considered to be the first professor of experimental hygiene. A strongly outspoken anticontagionist until the beginning of the twentieth century, Pettenkoffer promoted the concept of the value of a healthy city, stressing that health is the result of a number of factors, and that public health is a community concern since the measures taken to help those in need benefit the entire community.\n\nSocial Security\n\nIn 1861, Russia freed the serfs and returned independence to universities. Departments of hygiene were established in the university medical schools in the 1860s and 1870s to train future hygienists, and to carry out studies of sanitary and health conditions in manufacturing industries. F. F. Erisman, a pioneer in sanitary research in Russia, promoted the connection between experimental science, social hygiene, and medicine, and he established a school of hygiene in 1890, later closed by the czarist government. In 1864, the government initiated the Zemstvos system of providing medical care in rural areas as a governmental program. These health reforms were implemented in 34 of 78 regions of Russia, before the Revolution. Prior to these reforms, medical services in rural areas were practically non-existent. Epidemics and the high mortality of the working population induced the nobility and new manufacturers in rural towns to promote Zemstvos’ public medical services. In rural areas previously served by doctors based in the towns traveling to the villages, local hospitals and delivery homes were established. The Russian medical profession largely supported free public medical care as a fundamental right.\n\nIn 1883, Otto von Bismarck (1815–1898), Chancellor of Germany, introduced legislation providing mandatory insurance for injury and illness for workers in industrial plants, and survivor benefits. In 1883, he introduced social insurance for health care of workers and their families, based on mandatory payments from workers’ salaries and employer contributions. In the UK in 1911, Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd-George established compulsory insurance for workers and their families for medical care for general practitioner services based on capitation payment. This was followed by similar programs in Russia in 1912 and in virtually all Central and Western European countries by the 1930s. In 1918, Vladimir Lenin (1870–1924) established the state-operated health program, named after its founder Nikolai Semashko (1874–1949), bringing health care to the vast reaches of the Soviet Union. These programs were based on wide recognition of the principle of social solidarity, with governmental responsibility for health of the population being established in virtually all developed countries by the 1960s (see Chapter 13). In the USA, pensions were established for Civil War veterans, widows and orphans, and were made a national social security system only in 1935. Health care insurance was developed through trade unions, and only extended to governmental medical care insurance for the elderly and the poor in 1965.\n\nDuring the industrial revolution, the harsh conditions in the urban industrial and mining centers of Europe led to efforts in social reform preceding and contributing to sanitary reform. These changes occurred well before the germ theory of disease causation was proven and the science of microbiology was established. Pioneering breakthroughs were made based on trial and error, challenging then established dogmas and producing the sanitary revolution, still unfinished and perhaps the most basic of the foundations of public health.\n\nThe issues of universal access to health care and especially prevention are challenges to public health in the twenty-first century. In many of the industrialized countries with universal health care, social inequalities still exist, with gaps between rich and poor, urban and rural, minority groups and other groups at special risk. These are discussed in following chapters of this book. In the USA, the struggle to achieve universal health care is an ongoing political issue in the second decade of the twenty-first century and is still unresolved. In the countries in transition from the Soviet system of health protection, an epidemiological shift occurred but the health system has been slow to respond. In the developing countries universal access to health care is still a distant dream.\n\nSnow on Cholera\n\nThe great cholera pandemics originated in India between 1825 and 1854 and spread via increasingly rapid transportation to Europe and North America. Moscow lost some 33,000 people in the cholera epidemic of 1829, which recurred in 1830–1831. In Paris, the 1832 cholera epidemic killed over 18,000 people (just over 2 percent of the population) in 6 months.\n\nBetween 1848 and 1854, a series of outbreaks of cholera occurred in London with large-scale loss of life. The highest rates were in areas of the city where two water companies supplied homes with overlapping water mains. One of these (the Lambeth Company) then moved its water intake to a less polluted part of the River Thames, while the Southwark and Vauxhall company left its intake in a part of the river heavily polluted with sewage. John Snow, a founding member of the London Epidemiological Society and anesthetist to Queen Victoria, investigated an outbreak of cholera in Soho from August to September 1854, in the area adjacent to Broad Street. He traced some 500 cholera deaths occurring in a 10-day period. Cases either lived close to or used the Broad Street pump for drinking water. He determined that brewery workers and poorhouse residents in the area, using uncontaminated wells, escaped the epidemic. Snow concluded that the Broad Street pump was probably contaminated. He persuaded the authorities to remove the handle from the pump, and the already subsiding epidemic disappeared within a few days.\n\nDuring September to October, 1854, Snow investigated another outbreak, again suspecting water transmission. He identified cases of mortality from cholera by their place of residence and which water company supplied the home ( ). Snow calculated the cholera rates in a 4-week period in homes supplied by each of the two companies. Homes supplied by the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company were affected by high cholera death rates while adjacent homes supplied by the Lambeth Company had rates lower than the rest of London. This observation provided overwhelming epidemiological support for Snow’s hypothesis that the cholera epidemic source was the contaminated water from the River Thames, distributed to homes in a large area of south London. The risk to local residents of becoming infected and falling ill with cholera was dependent upon the specific water company as well as the pump utilized.\n\nTABLE 1.1\n\nWater Supply CompanyNumber of HousesDeaths from CholeraCholera Deaths/10,000 HousesSouthwark and Vauxhall40,0461,263315Lambeth26,1079837Rest of London256,4231,42259\n\nSources: Snow J.

It also led to legislation mandating filtration of water companies’ supplies in 1857. Vibrio cholerae was not isolated until 1883, during an investigation of waterborne cholera outbreaks in Egypt by Robert Koch. Snow’s work on cholera has become one of the classic epidemiological investigations, studied to this day for its scientific imagination and thoroughness, despite preceding the discovery of the causative organism by nearly 30 years.\n\nA landmark case, Snow’s work on cholera stimulated more investigation of causes of enteric diseases. William Budd (1811–1880), a physician at the Bristol Royal Infirmary, carried out a number of epidemiological investigations of typhoid fever in the 1850s, finding waterborne episodes of the disease. He investigated an outbreak in 1853 in Cowbridge, a small Welsh village, where a ball attracted 140 participants from surrounding counties. Almost immediately afterwards, many of those attending the ball became sick with typhoid fever. He found that a person with typhoid had been at the location some days before, and that his excreta had been disposed of near a well, from which water was drawn for the ball. Budd then concluded that water was the vehicle of transmission of the disease. He investigated other outbreaks and summarized his reports in Typhoid Fever: Its Nature, Mode of Transmission and Prevention, published in 1873, which is a classic work on waterborne transmission of enteric disease. These investigations were very valuable, as they contributed to the movement to disinfect public water systems on a preventive basis.\n\nThe brilliant epidemiological studies of Snow and Budd set a new direction in epidemiology and public health practice, not only with waterborne disease. They established a standard for investigation of the distribution of disease in populations with the purpose of finding a way to interrupt the transmission of disease. Improved sanitation and water safety, developed in urban and rural population centers, contributed greatly to improved survival and a reduction in cholera and typhoid epidemics. However, globally, waterborne disease remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality, especially among children living in poverty.\n\nThe Germ and Miasma Theories\n\nUntil the early and middle parts of the nineteenth century, the causation of disease was hotly debated. The miasma theory, holding that disease was the result of environmental emanations or miasmas, went back to Greek and Roman medicine, and Hippocrates’ treatise On Air, Water, and Places. Miasmists believed that disease was caused by infectious mists or noxious vapors emanating from filth in the towns and that the method of prevention of infectious diseases was to establish sanitary measures to clean the streets of garbage, sewage, animal carcasses, and wastes that were features of urban living. This provided the basis for the Sanitary Movement, with great benefit to improving health conditions. The miasma theory had strong proponents well into the later part of the nineteenth century.\n\nThe contagion or germ theory gained ground, despite the lack of scientific proof, on the basis of biblical and Middle Ages’ experience with isolation of lepers and quarantine of other infectious conditions. In 1546, Fracastoro (1478–1553) published De Contagione, a treatise on microbiological organisms as the case of specific diseases. The germ theory was strengthened by the work of Antony van Leeuwenhoek (1632–1723), who invented the microscope in 1676. The invention of this apparatus is considered to be a groundbreaking discovery, a watershed in the history of science. His research showing small microorganisms led to his recognition as a Fellow of the Royal Society of England in 1680. The germ theorists believed that microbes, such as those described by van Leeuwenhoek, were the cause of diseases which could be transmitted from person to person or by contact with sewage or contaminated water.\n\nMajor contributions to resolving this issue came from the epidemiological studies of Snow and Budd in the 1850s, proving waterborne transmission of cholera and typhoid, suggesting that if the disease was not from a miasma source then it was due to germ (contagion) sources. The classic study of a measles epidemic in the remote Faroe Islands by Peter Panum in 1846 clearly showed person-to-person transmission of this disease, its incubation period, and the lifelong natural immunity that exposure gives (Box 1.6 ). The dispute continued, with miasmists or sanitationists and germ theorists arguing with equal vehemence.\n\nBOX 1.6\n\nPeter Ludwig Panum (1820–1885), a 26-year-old newly graduated medical doctor from the University of Copenhagen, was sent to the Faroe Islands by the Danish government in 1846 to investigate an outbreak of measles. On the islands, located in the far reaches of the North Atlantic, there was no documentation of measles since 1781. During the 1846 epidemic, approximately 6000 of the 7782 islanders were stricken with measles and 102 of them died of the disease or its sequelae. Panum visited all isolated corners of the islands, tracing the chain of transmission of the disease from location to location, and the immunity of those exposed during the epidemic.\n\nFrom his well-documented observations he concluded, contrary to the prevailing opinion, that measles is a contagious disease spread from person to person, and that one attack gives lifelong immunity. His superb report clearly demonstrated the contagious nature of the disease and its incubation period. It also proved that measles is not a disease of “spontaneous generation”, nor is it generally dispersed in the atmosphere and spread as a “miasma”, giving strength to and providing evidence for the germ theory.\n\nSince the 1960s, the availability of an inexpensive, highly effective, and safe vaccine has led to the elimination of domestic circulation of the virus in many countries, yet measles remains a serious global health problem in 2013. An estimated 250,000 children died of this highly contagious disease in 2006.\n\nA European-wide measles epidemic in 2010–2012 had over 50,000 cases in 2011 alone. As a result of imported cases and local spread, outbreaks of measles are occurring in countries that were thought to be measles free, including countries in North and South America. Measles elimination is possible with the two-dose policy with current vaccines, if immunization is given high priority with catch-up campaigns for vulnerable age groups and travelers, and pursued with determined national and international efforts.\n\nSources: Emerson H.

Increasing attention was paid to sewage and water safety, and the removal of waste products by organized municipal activities was adopted in European and North American cities. The sanitary revolution proceeded while the debates raged and solid scientific proof of the germ theory accumulated, primarily in the 1880s. Fear of cholera stimulated New York City to establish a Board of Health in 1866. In the city of Hamburg, Germany, a Board of Health was established in 1892 only after a cholera epidemic attacked the city, while neighboring Altona remained cholera free because it had established a water filtration plant.\n\nThe specific causation of disease (the germ theory) has been a vital part of the development of public health. The bacteriological revolution (see later section entitled “The Bacteriological Revolution”), led by the work of Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch, provided enormous benefit to medicine and public health. Those who argued that disease is environmental in origin (the miasma theory), however, also contributed to public health because of their recognition of the importance of social or other environmental factors, such as poor sanitation and housing conditions or nutritional status, all of which increase susceptibility to specific agents of disease, or to the seve"
