This easy to remember acronym is our University procedure in the case of a fire. Particularly in the hospital, every staff member is trained to recognize and respond appropriately in the case of a fire using this term.\n\nRemove\n\nRemove everyone from the area. If a fire occurred in a patient room, the staff should immediately remove the patient from the area.\n\nAlarm\n\nThe fire alarm pull station shall be activated call 911 to report fire. Fire alarm pull stations are located throughout the buildings, several on each floor. By activating the fire alarm, a fire action plan is set into motion where University Police receive the signal and initiate the emergency response. In addition, certain systems that could increase fire spread are automatically shutdown.\n\nConfine\n\nOnce the room or area has been cleared of patients, the door shall be closed, thus confining the fire. This enables the fire response team the time needed to arrive.\n\nExtinguish or Evacuate\n\nWhen practical and only when an employee has been properly trained in the safe and proper use of a fire extinguisher, extinguisher shall be attempted using one fire extinguisher. Evacuate if you are not comfortable using a fire extinguisher or if more than one extinguisher is needed.\n\nThe Fire Marshal office has available, a portable fire extinguisher trainer for hands on training. Contact the office at 8-3893 to set up a session."
