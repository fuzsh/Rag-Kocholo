        "text": "LEXINGTON, Ky. â Lexington is home to an estimated 1,300 Congolese people, and many of them gathered Saturday in the downtown area to spread awareness about whatâs happening in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nElisha Mutayongwa, the Marifiki Centerâs director, and Karema Bwerevu organized the rally.\n\nMillions have been displaced and killed because of years of violence.\n\nWords like \"overlooked\" and \"forgotten\" have been used to describe the decades-long conflict that has occurred in Congo.\n\nâWe just want to emphasize whatâs going on in the Congo, but mainly on the silence the international community is showing to the world on whatâs going on in the Congo,â said Serge Kanyonga, who is from Congo and attended the rally.\n\nAlmost seven million people are internally displaced, according to the U.N.âs International Organization for Migration. This is the highest number on record for the country.\n\nâWar has a tremendous effect in our lives,â Mutayongwa said. âI can see, even all the people that are here, they have a tremendous story of the journey of life they went through because of what has been going on forever.â\n\nPeople at the rally had the opportunity to share their stories, thoughts and hopes to bring awareness to Lexington residents about an issue that has affected many lives.\n\nâOur community is big here ... how can we just put them together for one cause and be like, âWeâre just going to hold a sign in town and raise awareness,ââ Mutayongwa said."
