        "text": "Large farm dedicated to the grazing of sheep and cattle (in New Zealand agriculture)\n\nA station or run, in the context of New Zealand agriculture, is a large farm dedicated to the grazing of sheep and cattle. The use of the word for the farm or farm buildings date back to the mid-nineteenth century.[1] The owner of a station is called a runholder.\n\nSome of the stations in the South Island have been subject to the voluntary tenure review process. As part of this process the government has been buying out all or part of the leases. Poplars Station in the Lewis Pass area was purchased in part by the government in 2003. The Nature Heritage Fund was used to purchase 4000 ha for $1.89 million.[2] Birchwood Station was bought in 2005 to form part of the Ahuriri Conservation Park[3] St James Station was purchased by the Government in 2008.\n\nNotable stations\n\n[edit]\n\nĀkitio Station, formerly a 50,000 acres (200 km2) property located in the Southern North Island province of Wairarapa and host to the touring English Cricket team in the 20th century.\n\nCastle Hill Station, located on State Highway 73; location of a popular rock-climbing area.\n\nDouble Hill Station, located up the Rakaia River.\n\nErewhon Station, named after a fictitious place (based on Mesopotamia Station) in Samuel Butler's book \"Erewhon\".\n\nGlenaray Station, near Waikaia in northern Southland.\n\nMarainanga Station, Southern North Island, formerly 38,000 acres (150 km2) – famously associated to Ocean Racing – and the Condor maxi yacht campaigns of the 1970s/1980s; and connected to the 1908 foundation of the UK's Stoke Park Club.\n\nMesopotamia Station, associated with 19th century novelist Samuel Butler.\n\nMolesworth Station, at over 1,800 square kilometres (440,000 acres), New Zealand's largest farm.
