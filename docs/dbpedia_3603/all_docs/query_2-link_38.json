        "text": "Baltimore Orioles players Luis Aparicio, Roger Bresnahan, Reggie Jackson, Joe Kelley, George Kell, Joe McGinnity, Eddie Murray, Jim Palmer, Robin Roberts, Brooks Robinson, Frank Robinson and Hoyt Wilhelm have all been inducted into The National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.\n\nAnd let’s not forget fan-favorite and hometown hero, Cal Ripken, Jr., who also has his own spot in the Cooperstown Hall of Fame. Nicknamed “Iron Man,” Calvin Edward Ripken, Jr. played in 2,632 straight games with the Orioles, a record that has yet to be broken.\n\nBaltimore’s most famous player, of course, is George Herman “Babe” Ruth, who was recruited in 1914 at the age of 19. His boyhood home at 216 Emory Street near Camden Yards is now the Babe Ruth Birthplace Museum and features memorabilia from his childhood and career.\n\nBefore you head to Camden Yards for an Oriole’s game, stop by these places to enjoy a pregame beer or crab pretzel!\n\nPickles Pub\n\nLocated among a cluster of rowhomes across from Camden Yards, Pickles Pub has been around since 1988 and is one of locals’ go-to game day destinations. It offers great happy hour specials and plenty of TVs to watch the game. Try the crab patty, a burger topped with crab dip, and pair it with some crabby fries and a Natty Boh for a classic Bawlmer meal. True to its name, the bar serves beer-battered pickles over tortilla chips.\n\nBoots & Brats Biergarten\n\nOpen for weekend home games, the Hilton Baltimore Inner Harbor‘s outdoor beer garden offers various draft and canned brews, including beers from Baltimore-based companies Union Craft Brewing and Heavy Seas Beer, as well as a small food menu with bratwurst and other snack items. The garden also features lawn games, an outdoor TV and music, and the hotel has several rooms overlooking the ballpark if you’re traveling from out of town for a game.\n\nHere in Baltimore, we have a few traditions we like to stick to during Orioles games. Feel free to join in if you want to feel like a true local. When you hear the “Star-Spangled Banner” start playing, be prepared to shout “O” during the first stanza. The crowd also gets to their feet to dance to “Thank God I’m a Country Boy” during the seventh inning stretch. And get ready to declare your allegiance to ketchup, mustard or relish during the great hot dog race on the big screen."
