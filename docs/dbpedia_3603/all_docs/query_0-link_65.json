        "text": "American Museum Congo Expedition (1909-1915)\n\nThe American Museum Congo Expedition (1909-1915) was sponsored by the American Museum of Natural History and made possible through the support of the Belgian government.\n\nThe expedition party consisted of just two men. Herbert Lang, a German-born taxidermist and mammalogist was Expedition leader and photographer; James Paul Chapin, a student and ornithologist who worked at the Museum was selected to be his Assistant. The main goal was to expand the Museumâ€™s collection of African zoological specimens, but Lang was also tasked with acquiring ethnographic material. The Museum was particularly eager to obtain specimens of the recently discovered (1901) okapi and the square-lipped, or white, rhinoceros. Lang and Chapin successfully traveled throughout the Congo region in central Africa (Modern day Democratic Republic of the Congo) to ultimately collect a massive fifty-four tons of material and over 9000 photographs for the Museum.\n\nVideo: American Museum Congo Expedition 1909-1915\n\nNarration by: Felicity Nduku\n\nWritten by: Gordy Slack\n\nGordy Slack\n\nTranscript for Congo Expedition Introduction\n\nGordy Slack\n\nSequence One: Departure\n\nBy the dawn of the twentieth century, the exploration of central Africa had become a Western obsession. Missionaries sought souls to convert. American reporter Henry Morton Stanley had penetrated the heart of Africa, looking for adventure and fame. Theodore Roosevelt launched expeditions into it, emerging with big-game trophies and incredible tales. Robber barons gutted parts of it, taking millions of African lives as they went. But to the natural science community, the Congo represented a different kind of prize. It was brimming with scientifically unexplored forms of life. On May 8, 1909, two young scientists left New York harbor for the West Coast of Africa. They had planned to be in the Congo for two years to collect as many animals and ethnographic objects as they could, and, specifically, to bring home examples of two large mammals: the okapi, a rare, short-necked forest giraffe discovered only a few years earlier--and the endangered square-lipped rhinoceros. Their plan would be amended again and again as two years turned to three, then four, then five.\n\nSequence Two: Lang and Chapin\n\nHerbert Lang was chosen to lead the expedition. He was a German taxidermist and photographer who had already assisted on an expedition to Kenya in 1906. That trip had ignited his interest in Africa, its people, and its wildlife. James Chapin, Lang's assistant, was a nineteen-year-old Columbia College student when they left for the Congo. By the time he returned to New York, he was a world authority on central African birds.\n\nSequence Three: The Voyage\n\nNine days out of New York, they docked in Belgium then sailed another 19 days to Boma, a city near the mouth of the Congo River that was then the seat of the controversial Belgian colonial government. By rail and boat, they traveled a thousand miles up the Congo to Stanleyville and, with the help of hundreds of conscripted porters, walked through the dense rainforest to Avakubi then on to their base camp in Medje. Conditions were grueling. Their search for the reclusive okapi, for instance, took them to parts of the forest so swampy, hot, and dense that Lang called them \"the most dismal spots on the face of the globe.\" But not a day passed without discovery of something new to them; not a week without something altogether new to science.\n\nSequence Four: The Work\n\nLang and Chapin weren't the first scientists to explore the Congo's interior, but their expedition was different in key ways. For one, they spent longer there than other scientists had. And while others had concentrated on big game, Lang and Chapin collected everything from the smallest insects, rodents, and fishes, up to birds and giant mammals. They collected thousands of ants, which would become the primary material for William Morton Wheeler's definitive Ants of the American Museum Congo Expedition. The birds were Chapin's passion and he later published Birds of the Belgian Congo, a four-volume ornithological classic.\n\nSequence Five: The Ituri Forest\n\nLang and Chapin rose before the sun to hunt for specimens. Through the hottest parts of the day they prepared their collections and took detailed notes. Chapin painted and sketched and Lang took photographs, frequently working half the night developing the film he had shot during the day. Lang and Chapin's vast array of ethnographic objects, photographs, and notes constitute one of the period's largest and most comprehensive anthropological collections from the Congo. Because Lang and Chapin were alone on the expedition, they relied heavily on Africans to help them gather specimens, as well as for transportation, provisions, and every other aspect of daily life. For example, Lang and King Okondo, an important Mangbetu chief, became friends and the scientists lived for months as guest's in Okondo's village. The brutal history of European exploitation must have colored these relationships, and we will never hear Okondo's perspective, let alone those of the porters and other assistants on the expedition, but the collections themselves suggest much collaboration between the visitors and their hosts.\n\nSequence Six: Returning Home\n\nBy the outbreak of WW I in 1914 Lang and Chapin had obtained good specimens of the okapi, the square-lipped rhino, and thousands of pounds of other collections. They hurried home, but taking the months necessary to pack and carry their cargo more than a thousand miles to the coast of Africa and to prepare it for the voyage back across the Atlantic. While Chapin and the collections traveled by way of England, running a German blockade of the Liverpool Harbor, Lang, a German national and officially an enemy of the US after the declaration of war, had to return to New York by way of Angola and Lisbon. Almost a century after the expedition, the collection remains an essential resource for scientists studying the cultures, biodiversity, and evolutionary significance of the area. The Expedition's most important contributions may be still to come; for understanding the diversity of an area as vast, rich, and complex as this one will be key to preserving its ecological integrity.\n\nby Gordy Slack\n\nA decade after Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness first depicted the mysteries and agonies of the area, Herbert Lang and James Chapin set sail for the northeastern Belgian Congo. They knew they were launching an extraordinary adventure, but they could not have imagined what those years would hold. By the time they sailed home five and a half years later, they had collected tons of precious zoological and anthropological specimens representing one of the most comprehensive collections of the day.\n\nDeparture\n\nBy the dawn of the twentieth century, the exploration of central Africa had become a Western obsession.

New York: Harper & Brothers. 1885. This early and large map, most likely cut out of Stanley's 1885 publication The Congo and the founding of its Free State; a story of work and exploration, is extremely detailed along the Atlantic Coast and along the Congo River, east of Lake Tanganyika and around Lake Victoria, but completely empty for hundreds of miles north and south of the River in the center of the country, where the rain forest is dense. The map is a good visual representation of the scope of exploration in the Congo as of about 1880.\n\nCarte de l'Etat indÃ©pendant du Congo par J. duFief, SecrÃ©taire-gÃ©nÃ©ral de la SociÃ©tÃ© royale belge gÃ©ographiqe. Bruxelles, 1895. This enormous map (more than four feet square) is drawn at an incredible scale: 31 miles to one inch. In 1895, only limited areas of the Congo had been explored, hence, there's a lot of empty space in this beautiful map. One can imagine how exciting such a map must have been in 1908 to a young man about to set sail.\n\nCarte de l'Etat indÃ©pendant du Congo. Bruxelles. 1898.\n\nCarte de l'Etat indÃ©pendant du Congo. Bruxelles. 1907. The 1898 and 1907 versions of the same map are smaller in scale, and begin to show administrative divisions and topographic detail. The 1898 version has routes of exploration (such as \"Livingstone 1870\") and major battles indicated, and the 1907 version shows missions, administrative posts, and the few railroads that had been constructed around the Congo River rapids. The 1907 version also shows that the bordering territories have been partitioned by the European powers. Such areas as French Congo and German East Africa are noted on the map.\n\nPetit atlas du Congo belge. Bruxelles: A. de Boeck, [1912?]. 32 [i.e. 64] p.: ill., maps (16 col.); 21 cm. Consists of 32 p. of text and 16 folded maps printed on verso of unnumbered pages and on recto of numbered pages. A very comprehensive little atlas, it includes ethnographic, economic, and political color maps of the country, as well as a color map of each province and a detail map of the area around the mouth of the river. Also included are charts and graphs measuring the Congo's climate, language, watershed, river output, geology, population, land disposition, etc.\n\nSerials and Monographs: History\n\nLopes, Duarte.

Bruxelles: A. de Boeck, 1910. 143 p. illus., music, ports. This oversize picture book has terrific photographs of the terrain and peoples of the Congo. It must have been irresistible to young James Chapin. Notable are pictures of people tapping wild rubber vines and lining up with their baskets of rubber. The people of the Congo were taxed by Leopold's government, and paid these taxes with such baskets of rubber. By most accounts, it took approximately twenty days each month to gather enough rubber to pay one family's taxes.\n\nJephson, A. J. Mounteney.

Boston: Houghton Mifflin [1909]. 551 p. illus., facsim., folded map., ports. Stanley seems to have been a cruel and conflicted man. His many biographies cite numerous lies he told about himself and his background, chief among them, that he was an American (he was born in Wales and raised in a workhouse) and that his name was Henry Morton Stanley (he was born John Rowlands). An opportunist of the highest order, he was a journalist when he first went to Africa, to find David Livingstone. Every time he returned from the Congo, he wrote a two-volume book, in which he depicts himself as revered by the natives, admired by his men, intrepid and compassionate. Books and diaries written by men who served under him on these expeditions, and even his own letters and journals, often contradicted this depiction, casting Stanley as a ruthless bully who used men like tools. During his last large expedition, he looted and burned villages and killed the Congolese without thought. One of his officers packed the severed head of an African in a box of salt and sent it to a taxidermist in London (Hochschild p. 99).\n\nWard, Herbert. Five years with the Congo cannibals. London: Chatto & Windus, 1891. xv, 308 p. ill. 25 cm. Typical of the era, this book is heavily illustrated and larded with anecdotes about \"funny\" native practices, run-ins with big game, and description of flora. In books such as this one, the authors try to be objective observers - they attempt to be neither patronizing nor critical, but merely to document the oral traditions, rituals, and daily life of a \"primitive\" culture. These books seem to us, in 1999, to be both patronizing and critical, but it is unkind to judge these writers too harshly. It is very difficult to maintain objectivity when observing other human beings, and it was obviously more so \"back then,\" when the world was smaller.\n\nSerials and Monographs: Politics\n\nAborigines Protection Society. The treatment of natives in the Congo; a statement submitted to His Majesty's government on behalf of the Aborigines Protection Society. [London, 1902]. 10 l. 34 cm. H. R. Fox Bourne, secretary of the Aborigines Protection Society and the writer of this document, was a knowledgeable and highly-respected opponent of Leopold's. A historian and essayist, he wrote articles on the Congo for the Times in London.\n\nBurrows, Guy and Edgar Canisius. The curse of Central Africa. With which is incorporated A campaign amongst cannibals by Edgar Canisius ... With coloured map and numerous illustrations from unique and valuable photographs taken by the author and others. London, R. A. Everett & co., ltd., 1903. xxviii, [10], 276 p., 1 ., viii p., 1 ., [8] p. incl. front., illus., ports. plates, fold. map. 26 cm. Burrows had worked for Henry Morton Stanley, and wrote an adventure travel book called In the land of the Pigmies, to which Stanley had written the introduction. He, like many other former soldiers, was later made an official of the Congo Free State. Edgar Canisius was a soldier in the Force Publique. This book, which criticizes the King and his agents in no uncertain terms, is an insider's - indeed, an administrator's - view of the mistreatment of the Congo natives. Canisius described a six-week campaign that he participated in during which his unit killed 900 Congolese. When this book came out it, especially Canisius's testimony, was quoted in all the newspapers and referred to in official documents and in speeches made by members of the Congo Reform Movement.\n\nCongo Reform Association. Will civilisation hearken? The appeal of fifty-two pioneers of Christianity on the Congo, comprising Englishmen, Canadians, Americans, Germans, Swedes, Danes, and Norwegians. Liverpool: John Richardson & Sons, Printers, 1906. 8 p. Prefatory material by E.D. Morel. The Congo Reform Association was modeled on the organizations of the Abolitionist movement. National chapters were formed in England, the United States, and several European countries, especially the Scandinavian countries. The national chapters were broken down into local chapters, facilitating grass-roots and direct action advocacy. Some of these local chapters held meetings that attracted up to 5,000 people, often with prominent clergymen, members of Parliament, Congressmen, Peers of the Realm, and other celebrities sharing the dais. These celebrities also lent their names to the C.R.A.'s petitions and fund-raising campaigns, in some cases publishing pamphlets of their own (see Twain and Doyle, below). The Association published heavily and lobbied the United States and English governments, agitating for U.S.-British intervention on behalf of the Congolese.\n\nDoyle, Arthur Conan, Sir, 1859-1930.

London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1906. 213 p. Also published in New York by The Nassau Print. Morel, the leader of the Congo Reform Movement, was an amazingly prolific writer. He put out a monthly magazine, a weekly newspaper, and usually wrote one or two books a year, as well as innumerable pamphlets, speeches, and letters to the editor. His correspondence is reportedly massive. In 1904 or 1905, Morel met a missionary named Alice Seeley Harris, whose photographs Morel published in his books and projected (as lantern slides) in his lectures. These photographs are now held in the archives of the Anti-Slavery League in London. One might expect the New York Public Library to hold copies of some of these widely printed photos (some were also published in Mark Twain's King Leopold's soliloquy, for example), but such is not the case.\n\nSheppard, William Henry. Presbyterian pioneers in Congo; introduction by S.H. Chester. Kentucky: Pentecostal Publishing Company, 1900. 157 p. : ill. ; 18 cm. Sheppard was among the many Presbyterian missionaries in the Congo who became politicized because of the atrocities that they witnessed. Sheppard's unique perspective, however, is that he was black. This book, and the many pamphlets and open letters that he later wrote, incorporate a sensitivity to the rights of the Congo natives absent in even the most vociferous white Congo reform writers.\n\nStarr, Frederick. The truth about the Congo; the Chicago tribune articles. Chicago: Forbes & company, 1907. viii, 129 p., plates. 20 cm. Starr wrote 15 articles for the Chicago Tribune, reprinted here in book form, refuting charges against King Leopold, the Force Publique, and the rubber companies. Starr, an anthropologist who believed in the inferiority of \"primitive\" peoples, gained his knowledge about the Congo after a year-long tour of the country paid for by the King of the Belgians.\n\nTwain, Mark.

The AMNH copy of this small book is housed with a letter from the Congo Reform Association exhorting the reader to take specific advocacy steps on behalf of the Congolese, such as organizing meetings and writing letters to Congressmen.\n\nUnited States. Dept. of State. Conditions in the independent state of the Kongo. [Washington, 1906-08?]. 4 v. in 1. 34 cm. This is a collection of State Department documents bound together in chronological order. It includes eyewitness reports of the practices of the rubber companies, correspondence between the British Foreign Office and the State Department, and reports of the American consul-general in the Congo. It is a revealing look at the diplomatic pressures that the United States and Britain brought to bear on King Leopold and the Belgians.\n\nHerausgegeben, eingeleitet und kommentiert von Rold Italiaander.

Bruxelles: Imprimerie Veuve Monnom, 1897. xiv, 523 p., [3] leaves of plates (some folded): ill. (some col.); 26 cm. From the title of this little book, it would appear that the Congo exhibit was but a part of the 1897 Brussels-Tervueren International Exposition. However, there are no other publications associated with the exposition, and no references to any but the Congo exhibit, so it seems that perhaps the Exposition was devoted wholly to the natural history, ethnology, industries, and description of the Congo.\n\nCornet, RenÃ© Jules.

Avec une carte au millioniÃ¨me ... [Bruxelles, C. Bulens, 1906?]. vi, iii, ii, 53 p. incl. tables. 30 cm. (Publications de l'Etat independant du Congo.) LeMaire, an officer of the Force Publique who fancied himself a scientist, kept a diary while he was in the Congo. This diary was published in 1986, prompting speculation that LeMaire was the model for Joseph Conrad's sadistic Colonel Kurtz. The diary reveals LeMaire's leadership in the murder and maiming of large numbers of Congolese natives by men under his command. He was also a staunch promoter of Esperanto, and at least one of his publications, Tra Mez-Afriko, a pamphlet published on the occasion of the 2nd Congress of Esperantists, is printed in both French and Esperanto, with the French in black on the left-hand page, and Esperanto in green on the right-hand page. Regardless of his administrative policies and linguistic abilities, however, his work was not apparently up to the American Museum's standard - none of his publications appear in that library.\n\nOverbergh, Cyrille van. Les Mangbetu (Congo belge). Bruxelles, A. de Wit, 1909. xvi, 594 p., [4] leaves of plates illus., fold. map. 26 cm. (Collection de monographies ethnographiques, 4.) The American Museum Congo Expedition paid special attention to the Mangbetu, whose art captured the imagination of Europe as soon as examples of it were brought out of the forest. The Mangbetu had a complex social system and were quite wealthy, with large structures, highly developed art, and elaborate personal ornamentation including tattoos, body paint, body modification (pointed skulls), scarification and hairstyles.\n\nPiaggia, Carlo.

New York: McClure, Phillips, 1903. 381 p. 20 cm.\n\nQuinn, John. Papers, 1901-1926. Originals: 46 linear feet (72 boxes, 41 letterbooks, 3 v.). General correspondence: 50 microfilm reels. Finding aid available in repository. Manuscripts & Archives Section, NYPL. John Quinn was a corporate lawyer in New York City who collected manuscripts and art. His correspondence, 1901-1924, is with artists, art dealers, critics, poets, playwrights, booksellers, publishers, and members of his family. He had special interest in modern and avant-garde art, modern literature, and the Irish Home Rule Movement. His correspondents include Constantine Brancusi, William Butler Yeats, Marcel Duchamp, James Joyce, and Ezra Pound, among very many others. He carried on a correspondence with Sir Roger Casement, the traitorous English peer and Congo hero, during the latter's (largely unsuccessful) fundraising tour of America in the last years of his life. The letter from Joseph Conrad responding to Quinn's questions about Casement is included here; the Casement section begins on the leaf labeled \"II.\"\n\nNewspaper Headlines, 1880-1916\n\nCompiled from the indexes of the New York Times and the New York Herald and from an unpublished NYPL clipping scrapbook on France, 1879-1890. The Times has a complete printed index, but the Herald's index starts only at 1904. Prior to 1904, the NYPL librarians indexed the newspaper themselves, in handwritten ledgers arranged alphabetically by subject. These indexes are available in the Microform Room, but not all librarians know about the handwritten Herald index. While this list looks very dense, even a quick skim will reveal the pattern of the Congo's history and public opinion about the Congo - first its \"exploration\" by Stanley and DeBrazza, then the European scramble for ownership and trade rights, and then the 1900-1901 revelations of the atrocities committed by the rubber companies, the Congo Reform movement, and the 1908 annexation of the Congo Free State by Belgium. The American Museum Congo Expedition is mentioned twice in the New York Times, once in 1909 and once in 1916.\n\n1880\n\nMr. H. M. Stanley on the Congo. New York Herald.
