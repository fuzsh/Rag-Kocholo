        "text": "On this page:\n\nWhat is a Municipal Solid Waste Landfill?\n\nLearn about Municipal Solid Waste Transfer Stations\n\nRegulations for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills\n\nPublications and Guidance for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills\n\nWhat is a Municipal Solid Waste Landfill?\n\nA municipal solid waste landfill (MSWLF) is a discrete area of land or excavation that receives household waste. A MSWLF may also receive other types of nonhazardous wastes, such as commercial solid waste, nonhazardous sludge, conditionally exempt small quantity generator waste, and industrial nonhazardous solid waste. In 2009, there were approximately 1,908 MSWLFs in the continental United States all managed by the states where they are located.\n\nNon-hazardous solid waste is regulated under Subtitle D of RCRA. States play a lead role in ensuring the federal criteria for operating municipal solid waste and industrial waste landfills regulations are met, and they may set more stringent requirements. In absence of an approved state program, the federal requirements must be met by waste facilities. The revised criteria in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 258 addresses seven major aspects of MSWLFs, which include the following:\n\nLocation restrictions—ensure that landfills are built in suitable geological areas away from faults, wetlands, flood plains or other restricted areas.\n\nComposite liners requirements—include a flexible membrane (i.e., geo-membrane) overlaying two feet of compacted clay soil lining the bottom and sides of the landfill. They are used to protect groundwater and the underlying soil from leachate releases.\n\nLeachate collection and removal systems—sit on top of the composite liner and removes leachate from the landfill for treatment and disposal.\n\nOperating practices—include compacting and covering waste frequently with several inches of soil.\n\nThese practices help reduce odor, control litter, insects, and rodents, and protect public health.\n\nGroundwater monitoring requirements—requires testing groundwater wells to determine whether waste materials have escaped from the landfill.\n\nClosure and post-closure care requirements—include covering landfills and providing long-term care of closed landfills.\n\nCorrective action provisions—control and clean up landfill releases and achieves groundwater protection standards.\n\nFinancial assurance—provides funding for environmental protection during and after landfill closure (i.e., closure and post-closure care).\n\nSome materials may be banned from disposal in MSWLFs, including common household items like paints, cleaners/chemicals, motor oil, batteries and pesticides. Leftover portions of these products are called household hazardous waste. These products, if mishandled, can be dangerous to your health and the environment. Many MSWLFs have a household hazardous waste drop-off station for these materials.\n\nMSWLFs can also receive household appliances (i.e. white goods) that are no longer needed. Many of these appliances, such as refrigerators or window air conditioners, rely on ozone-depleting refrigerants and their substitutes. MSWLFs follow the federal disposal procedures for household appliances that use refrigerants. EPA has general information on how refrigerants can damage the ozone layer and consumer information on the specifics for disposing of these appliances.\n\nMunicipal Solid Waste Transfer Stations\n\nWaste transfer stations are facilities where municipal solid waste (MSW) is unloaded from collection vehicles. The MSW is briefly held while it is reloaded onto larger long-distance transport vehicles (e.g. trains, trucks, barges) for shipment to landfills or other treatment or disposal facilities. Communities can save money on the labor and operating costs of transporting the waste to a distant disposal site by combining the loads of several individual waste collection trucks into a single shipment.\n\nThey can also reduce the total number of trips traveling to and from the disposal site. Although waste transfer stations help reduce the impacts of trucks traveling to and from the disposal site, they can cause an increase in traffic in the immediate area where they are located. If not properly sited, designed and operated they can cause problems for residents living near them.\n\nA Regulatory Strategy for Siting and Operating Waste Transfer Stations provides information about waster transfer stations and the actions EPA has taken to address this issue.\n\nRegulations for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills\n\nThe table below provides links to final and promulgated rules pertaining to the operation and management of MSWLFs. Background information and technical support documents are also available for several rulemakings.\n\nRulemakings for MSWLFs\n\nPublications and Guidance for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills\n\nThe table below includes additional resources and guidance for the operation and management of MSWLFs."
