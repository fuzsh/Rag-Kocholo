In 2013 Andoche started working with ballet Ngoma Za Kongo and went on tour in Gabon, Senegal, Libya and Malta. Ballet Ngoma Za Kongo, meaning “Drums of the Kongo,” was invited by Africa Mondo Productions to tour the United States to bring different traditions and sounds from different regions of Congo.

Everyone who comes to the city for the summer never wants to leave.\n\nFor my performance, I plan to show my experience of my first summer in New York. I will be dancing in a fusion of house, salsa, and breakdance. I chose these three styles because they are the ones that were created in the city and it is what we see all over the city.\n\nI also plan to have red, blue, white, and green lights on the stage, i want to give the intention that I am dancing through the streets of New York at night."
