        "text": "How has your role developed at EY?\n\nI joined EY as a senior, just as the team had started up. I was one of the first to join the team and we had the goal to build up our cybersecurity practice focused on serving the Dutch financial sector. Since then, my role has evolved from supporting on projects to building and leading a team, as part of our ongoing growth as a business. As I grew, I gained opportunities to explore different fields and understand my core strengths.\n\nWhat do you enjoy the most about your role?\n\nIn my mind \"culture eats strategy for breakfast\" therefore, I place high importance on driving an inclusive but transparent culture across my team, bringing them on the journey and ensuring everyone’s voice is heard. We are like a big EY family working toward one goal.\n\nHave you been able to fulfil your professional and personal purpose at EY?\n\nWhen I started my career, I had a purpose in mind that was to make an impact. As a cybersecurity professional, I am ensuring a safe environment for the organization and for our clients on a daily basis. Working in cybersecurity enabled me to fulfil my purpose.\n\nWhat’s your advice to someone who wants to join cybersecurity at EY?\n\nEnsure you have done your research and have the right understanding about a career in cybersecurity. You don’t need to come from a tech background, but curiosity, communication and willingness to learn new skills are the kind of traits we are looking for! It is a fast moving sector, so showing your passion and interest in the sector is important.\n\nWhat attracted you to EY?\n\nI always wanted to begin my career in the financial services sector. One of the key reasons that attracted me to EY is the work culture and diversity. Another key reason is the work EY is doing to help refugees with their relocation, equipping them with the skills to empower them.\n\nHow has EY helped you to develop in your role?\n\nEY encourages me to learn and explore new skillsets to develop my career. Our EY badges programme gives me the opportunity to explore a whole new world of learning. I get to select the suitable courses which will be beneficial for my career growth and to build my knowledge bank.\n\nWhy is working in your area of the business at EY an exciting place to work right now?\n\nRight now, its very exciting to work at EY as the actuarial team is developing its niche skillsets. We are exposed to all the new and topical trends which help us to stay relevant. I get the flexibility to explore new and multiple things at the same time and learn simultaneously. I think this is very useful for someone beginning their career as they will be more well-rounded and learn incredible values.\n\nHow has your role evolved during your time at EY?\n\nI started my journey with EY as a fresh consultant with limited knowledge of the financial world. Over the past 2.5 years I have gained so much additional knowledge of the financial services sector. EY encourages me to mobilize others to achieve our bigger goal. I also get the opportunity to work with big clients and senior stakeholders. Outside of work, I’m also passionate about sharing my knowledge. EY encourages me to pursue my passions and that led me to launch a podcast series focused on climate change. I am constantly growing and improving, which is an important value for me. EY cultivates an environment that is very conducive to growth, which I enjoy a lot.\n\nHave you been able to fulfil your professional and personal purpose at EY?\n\nEY fully supported me when I was selected to attend COP26 through my work with the future leaders network. I negotiated with 19 other young leaders to devise a set of priorities for young people to the leaders of the world; in particular, the areas I was pushing for the most was a holistic, mandatory climate education and the implementation of green youth bonds. Following some highly successful work where the G20 considered and adopted some of our priorities, I led a team of delegates to COP26 in order to research how meaningful the engagement with young people at COPs are. We then wrote a report detailing our findings and our recommendations for future COPs. It was a privilege to represent the UK and lead a team of truly inspirational young people to COP26. This was very much aligned with my personal focus on combatting climate change and sustainability more widely. I was also encouraged to share my experience internally to further build the knowledge of our colleagues. This reflects the focus that EY places on this area, from leadership but also across our organization too.\n\nWhat advice would you give someone trying to begin a career at EY?\n\nEY is a great place to work as it gives you a lot of opportunity to learn and grow in your career. You are encouraged to work flexibly. I would also suggest doing a lot of research about EY before joining, and ask questions to ensure you can make an informed decision on the right area of the business for you.\n\nWhat attracted you to EY?\n\nAt EY, I work with diverse teams where I can focus on my strengths to solve EY client’s problems. I’m encouraged to have my own opinion and mindset and develop my career accordingly. EY has a fantastic 'teaming' culture and opportunities to learn from others, which attracted me the most. The EY badges program gives me opportunity to learn and grow in my career. I like to read a lot and keep myself updated with all the data protection acts.\n\nWhat skills do you use in your role?\n\nThe main skills I use in my role are attention to detail, analytical and logic skills, decision-making and judgement skills, and of course people skills.\n\nWhat do you enjoy the most about your role?\n\nI enjoy working on new and topical areas of data privacy, such as the intersection between new technologies (like AI and blockchain), or employment law and data protection. I like to work closely with our clients, provide them with tailored advice on how to practically implement data protection requirements.\n\nWhy is working at EY an exciting place to work right now?\n\nEY is a fascinating place to work, at any time. Right now, working in law brings excitement as well as new challenges.\n\nWhat challenges do you face in your current role?\n\nThe legal landscape has become much more complicated now and this has probably been the most technically challenging period in my career to date. I am keeping an open mind and a positive attitude to deal with all kinds of challenges.\n\nWhat surprised you most about EY and the people?\n\nI was quite surprised by the fact that EY teams are so diverse and inclusive.\n\nWhat advice would you give to someone trying to decide whether to begin a career in FS Law at EY?\n\nI would like to suggest to any new joiner to read articles related to financial services law practices and the issues which EY clients are facing to help you understand the market EY operate in.\n\nHow did you find your passion?\n\nIt took me a while to find my passion. I started my career as a telecoms engineer more than a decade ago after completing my BSc in electronics & telecoms engineering and MSc in satellite communications. I worked in the telecoms industry for nearly five years and made some great achievements including designing network components for all the leading European telecoms companies and leading the design of the UK’s first 4G Trial network.\n\nMy knack for process automation and improvement however led me to become involved in a number of internal consultation projects within my previous company, which consequently encouraged me to pursue a career in mainstream management consulting. I knew then that I had finally found what I wanted for the rest of my career.\n\nI have been in the advisory field since then and over nine years spanning more than 60 transactions. I have also had leadership experience at both strategic and operational levels across financial services. Having previously worked for other big 4 organizations, I was lured to EY by the fact that it specialized in financial services. This is an industry that I was keen to build my career in.\n\nWhat do you enjoy the most in your area of business and your role?\n\nThe market for M&A is hot right now, and we are supporting numerous interesting transactions. In fact, M&A tends to be busy through all economic cycles. When the economy is good, there is a high volume of deals as companies look to grow through acquisitions, and when the economy is struggling, we tend to get involved in disposals or divestments and restructuring. Due to the nature of our work, we get to advise on some of the most critical programs on the CEO’s agenda; and we typically get to work with the C-Suite.\n\nOften businesses are looking to enter into a market or exit a market, or operate in a different way this has an impact on the company, employees, clients, competitors and many times, the industry at large. I quite enjoy our role in orchestrating this change.\n\nHave you been able to fulfil your professional and personal purpose at EY?\n\nWhen I had just started working at EY, it was a lot about me working hard to demonstrate my abilities and competence. However with more experience and responsibility, it is more about working with others in my team and providing an environment in which they can bring the best of themselves to work and deliver great results. We have some great talent in my team, at all grades, who are amazing at their work and my personal success is linked to how successfully I can help them deliver in their respective roles.\n\nHaving been born and raised in Uganda, spent three years in Tanzania, studied and worked in the UK and travelled extensively, I have been exposed to many forms of diversity. It is something that I value immensely and promoting it is indeed a core value of mine. I have had opportunities within EY to get involved in activities in support of D&I, mostly from a racial diversity perspective, through my involvement in the SaT Black Network (SBN). I have also stayed connected to a number of D&I communities along the pillars of religion and gender. Throughout the course of my career, there have been moments where I have felt under-sponsored, and I am therefore keen to support or mentor others in order to ensure that they make the most of their career journeys.\n\nWhat advice would you give to those who aspire to join EY in your area of business?\n\nFor those who are new to the consulting lifestyle, I would say that it is invaluable experience, particularly in a global organization like EY. If they have worked in consulting before, I would say that EY is a friendly place. Due to the way in which incentives are structured, there is a lot of collaboration across service lines which minimizes internal bureaucracy and allows an employee to make the most of firm-wide opportunities. Transactions is an exciting space to work in, and while it is helpful to have some M&A experience, it is not mandatory, and we have seen many people transition successfully from other consulting roles or industry.\n\nWhat attracted you to EY?\n\nEY has such scope and you're part of a bigger network of people. This means there is always a colleague who can help, from learning to knowledge sharing.\n\nDid you always know you wanted to pursue a career in technology?\n\nI've always wanted to do something related to data which used my math skills. I began my journey at EY within the actuarial department. But given it's broad scope as an employer, I explored data analytics in detail. Seeing the growth and investment capability at EY, I explored ways to shape my career in a more technology focused role.\n\nDo you need to come from a technology background to succeed?\n\nMy role needs a variety of skills, both hard and soft skills. The range of technical expertise can change from low to high. People with a less technical background can find their area of expertise and happiness. And for those who are seeking in-depth technical challenges, you can also find a role within our area. All you need, is to have a passion towards data and technology and the rest you can learn!\n\nWhy is working in technology at EY an exciting place to work right now?\n\nTechnology is changing rapidly, meaning there is so much opportunity to update your skills. Data is everywhere and new data is being generated every second. We are in an era where our customers realize that they cannot stay resilient without data-driven decisions. Combining data with our rich knowledge and expertise, helps derive insights which support our clients. I love that the work I do makes such an impact to their operations.\n\nWhat types of clients do you work with?\n\nWe work with clients who are in the Financial Services sector, like banks, insurers, pension funds and asset management companies.\n\nWhat is your proudest career moment?\n\nI was selected for the Aspire program (leadership development for seniors) who were recognized as future leaders. A selected group of seniors from the EMEIA financial services region attended this program. It was also good opportunity to expand my network and build relationships. I was really honored to be selected for this program.\n\nWhat attracted you to EY?\n\nWhat attracted me to EY is its work and inclusive culture. EY places an emphasis on flexibility and encourages me to explore different options. They motivate me to succeed in my career. The EY badges programme has also provided me with numerous interactive training courses, which helped me to develop and grow in my role.\n\nWhat do you like about the most about your role?\n\nThe variety of tasks I perform, challenges I face and people I work with as a business consultant within insurance transformation. I get the opportunity to combine my communicative skills with business acumen and IT-savviness and to lead a diverse multidisciplinary team which helped me to learn project management and managerial skills. I enjoy getting in touch with people from different cultures, as it enriches my perspectives.\n\nWhat's the culture like?\n\nI get to work in a dynamic team with motivated colleagues on numerous projects that challenge me. In addition, I also enjoy the great work-life balance that comes with these types of projects.\n\nWhy is working in your area of the business at EY an exciting place to work right now?\n\nWe are currently living in a changing technological world and our team has remained at the forefront of this, supporting multiple clients in this area. We focus on a variety of hot topics, e.g., sustainability affecting the insurance industry so there is huge variety in the work we get to do.\n\nMy advice\n\nAt EY, you will receive a great onboarding which will prepare you for your first steps into the challenging, yet interesting world of consulting. I would like to advise if you have just graduated, to not be afraid of starting a career within financial services. You may think you don’t have the knowledge or experience, but if you’re willing and passionate, we will give you all the knowledge, experience and support to succeed.\n\nWhat attracted you to EY?\n\nDuring my interview, we spoke about things like personal values and attributes, and I sensed the amount of attention EY as an organization gives towards culture and wellbeing. This inclusive culture attracted me to join EY.\n\nTell us more about your journey from law to tax.\n\nI was introduced to tax law during my undergraduate degree and it sort of just made sense to me. I therefore pursued a postgraduate degree in tax and practiced it more as I started working. I was attracted to international tax, specifically tax structuring and planning for corporates. I was inspired by the ever-changing nature of tax legislation – it meant to me that there would always be something new to learn and I would be able to grow constantly, two things that I consider very important.\n\nWhat skills do you use in your role? Why do you think they are important?\n\nThere are so many – my people skills come in handy definitely! This is important both internally within my team, and externally with clients. It is also important to have good time management, people management and leadership skills. I enjoy the collaboration element in my role a lot. I interact with many different people to get the desired deliverable, and that suits my personality and working style. I also try and create an atmosphere of approachability and empathy with anyone I work with. The purpose of this is to be inclusive and embracing of everyone to make people feel accepted and seen.\n\nWhy is working in your area of the business at EY an exciting place to work right now?\n\nThere are a myriad of economic challenges impacting businesses form a Tax perspective. International tax is quite a hot topic area, particularly right now, and is expected to have a great trajectory with lots of exciting changes.\n\nWhat advice would you give to those who aspire to join EY in your area of business?\n\nI would highly recommend going for it. The transition will naturally have bumps on the road, but there are enough support mechanisms in place to assist making it as easy as possible.\n\nHow has your role developed at EY?\n\nI joined EY as a senior, just as the team had started up. I was one of the first to join the team and we had the goal to build up our cybersecurity practice focused on serving the Dutch financial sector. Since then, my role has evolved from supporting on projects to building and leading a team, as part of our ongoing growth as a business. As I grew, I gained opportunities to explore different fields and understand my core strengths.\n\nWhat do you enjoy the most about your role?\n\nIn my mind \"culture eats strategy for breakfast\" therefore, I place high importance on driving an inclusive but transparent culture across my team, bringing them on the journey and ensuring everyone’s voice is heard.
