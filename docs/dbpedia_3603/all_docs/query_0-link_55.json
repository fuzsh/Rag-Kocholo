        "text": "It was in Congo Square that enslaved African people gathered on Sunday afternoons to practice their ancestral traditions. Their legacy lives on in our Congo Square Rhythms Festival, a free weekend celebration showcasing the music, food, and dance that made this city known around the world.\n\nAbout\n\nThe Congo Square Rhythms festival sits on the outskirts of the French Quarter in Tremé, celebrating the neighborhood as a key proving ground in the birthplace of jazz! This year, we’re kicking the weekend off with Big Chief Monk Boudreaux & the Golden Eagles in concert at the George and Joyce Wein Jazz & Heritage Center. The show will be live-streamed for free on Friday, March 22 at 8pm CT on jazzandheritage.org/live\n\nFree Admission – Donations Accepted\n\nAdmission to the Congo Square Rhythms Festival is free. But we will have donation boxes set up at most of the park entrances. If you want to help us keep our events free, please support us with the donation of your choice. Thank you.\n\nClass Got Brass\n\nClass Got Brass presented by the Gia Maione Prima Foundation is a program of the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Foundation to support music education in the schools while promoting the traditional brass band music of New Orleans. We invite middle schools and high schools in Louisiana to create a New Orleans-style brass band of up to 12 members – and then to enter a competition in the form of a “second-line” parade with a who’s who of celebrity judges. At stake are more than $50,000 worth of instruments and other supplies for the winning schools’ music programs. Class Got Brass takes place in conjunction with Congo Square Rhythms Fest on Saturday, March 23 in Armstrong Park!\n\nArts Market\n\nAs always, we will feature two Art Markets, with dozens of local artists showcasing beautiful hand-made artworks and crafts. More than two dozen vendors will be present, offering fine art, photography, jewelry, clothing, and housewares.\n\nFood Vendors\n\nIf you love dark roux chicken and sausage gumbo, Creole filé gumbo, seafood gumbo, and all sorts of other great stuff – from po-boys to shrimp ’n’ grits – then come hungry.\n\nMardi Gras Indian Battle\n\nThe Mardi Gras Indian battle is always a major highlight of Congo Square Rhythms Fest! Three tribes meet in Congo Square to “battle” and then unite in Indian prayer, “Indian Red” and chanting. Check out this video from 2019 shot by OZ crew.\n\nKids Tent\n\nCongo Square Rhythms Festival will also feature a Kid’s Tent where our youngest fest-goers can get creative from 12 pm to 6 pm with free activities!\n\nBuild and Play\n\nThe Blocks are Back! PlayBuild’s over-sized Imagination Playground “Big Blue Blocks” are fun for kids of all ages. Kids parents, groups of friends, everyone can join the fun, building and playing together.\n\nAbout Playbuild Nola Founded in 2012 PlayBuild’s mission is to transform urban spaces into dynamic play and learning environments to empower kids to design their futures. A 501c3 non-profit, we operate from our home base in Central City, providing hands-on creative play activities to aspiring architects and city builders.
