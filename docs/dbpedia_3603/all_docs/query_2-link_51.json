        "text": "Xavier Huillard (Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer since may 2010)\n\n2010\n\nXavier Huillard is a graduate of the École Polytechnique and the École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées. He has spent most of his working life in the construction industry in France and abroad. Mr Huillard joined Sogea in December 1996 as Deputy Chief Executive Officer in charge of international activities and specific projects, and then became its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in 1998. He was appointed Deputy General Manager of VINCI in March 1998 and was Chairman of VINCI Construction from 2000 to 2002. He was appointed Co-Chief Operating Officer of VINCI and was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of VINCI Energies from 2002 to 2004, then Chairman of VINCI Energies from 2004 to 2005.

He served as Chairman of the Institut de l’Entreprise from January 2011 until January 2017. He was appointed Chairman of VINCI Concessions SAS on 20 June 2016.\n\nYves-Thibault de Silguy (Chairman from june 2006 to may 2010)\n\n2006\n\nYves-Thibault de Silguy has a degree in law from the Université de Rennes, a Masters degree in public law, and is a graduate of the Institut d’Études Politiques de Paris, public service section, and the École Nationale d’Administration. From 1976 to 1981, he worked at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and for the European Commission from 1981 to 1985. He then worked at the French Embassy in Washington as a Counsellor (economic affairs) from 1985 to 1986. From 1986 to 1988, Mr de Silguy was an adviser in the Prime Minister’s office with responsibility for European affairs and international economic and financial affairs. From 1988 to 1993, he headed the international affairs department of the Usinor Sacilor Group, before being named its Director for International Affairs. From 1993 to 1995, he was Secretary-General of the Interdepartmental Committee for Questions of Economic Cooperation in Europe and at the same time, adviser for European affairs and vice-sherpa in the Prime Minister’s office, assisting in the preparation of summits of the industrialised nations. From 1995 to 1999, Mr de Silguy was European Commissioner responsible for economic, monetary and financial affairs. From 2000 to 2005, he was Chairman of Medef’s European Policy Committee. In January 2000, he became a member of the Executive Board of Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux, then served as Chief Executive Officer of Suez from 2001 to 2003. He was then Executive Vice-President of Suez from 2003 until June 2006. Mr de Silguy was appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors of VINCI on 1 June 2006 and resigned from all his appointments at Suez. On 6 May 2010, he was appointed Vice-Chairman of VINCI and Lead Director of the Board. Since October 2018, he has been Vice-Chairman of VINCI.\n\nAntoine Zacharias (Chairman of VINCI from 2000 to 2006)\n\n2000\n\nA graduate of engineering school ENSEEIHT, Antoine Zacharias held many management positions at Compagnie Générale des Eaux, where he spent most of his career. He was regional director at Lyon, and in charge of developing and monitoring the group's activities in Germany. He was appointed Deputy General Manager of CCGE in 1994 and member of the Vivendi Executive Board in 1995. Executive manager and Director of SGE since 1991, he was appointed chairman of the group in June 1997. In April 2000, he resigned from Vivendi when the latter reduced its interest in SGE to 17%. He was responsible for the VINCI's merger with GTM in 2000, which made VINCi the world leader in construction, concessions and related services.\n\nSoletanche Bachy\n\n1997\n\nThe art of foundations is as old as the hills, but its scientific expression, geotechnical engineering, only goes back to the 1920s. As the industrial pioneers of the new discipline, Soletanche and Bachy devised most of the innovations that revolutionised ground technologies. Their merger in 1997 consolidated their leadership in the sector.\n\nSoletanche and Bachy have successfully completed some 60,000 projects, including waterproofing and repair of large dams; nuclear power station protective walls; tunnels for most of the large urban metro systems; very deep foundations for the highest skyscrapers in Asia, Europe and the Middle East; refurbishment of historic landmarks such as the Arc de Triomphe and the Grand Palais in Paris, the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow and Saint Pancras Train Station in London; major marine works such as Port 2000 in Le Havre, The Palm in Dubai and Al Raha Beach in Abu Dhabi; and a multitude of smaller projects showcasing the skills of our operators, technicians and engineers.\n\nAntoine Zacharias (Chairman of SGE from 1997 to 2000)\n\n1997\n\nA graduate of engineering school ENSEEIHT, Antoine Zacharias held many management positions at Compagnie Générale des Eaux, where he spent most of his career. He was regional director at Lyon, and in charge of developing and monitoring the group's activities in Germany. He was appointed Deputy General Manager of CCGE in 1994 and member of the Vivendi Executive Board in 1995. Executive manager and Director of SGE since 1991, he was appointed chairman of the group in June 1997. In April 2000, he resigned from Vivendi when the latter reduced its interest in SGE to 17%. He was responsible for the VINCI's merger with GTM in 2000, which made VINCi the world leader in construction, concessions and related services.\n\nChannel Tunnel\n\n1994\n\nSGE\n\nxThe inauguration of the Channel tunnel in 1994 marked the end of an exceptional technical and human adventure. The idea dated back to 1802, when Albert Mathieu, an engineer, suggested digging a tunnel to link France to England, but the project did not materialise until France and the UK signed a treaty to this effect in 1986.\n\nThe tunnel includes three galleries, and is a total of 50.5 kilometres in length, of which 37 kilometres run under the channel, which is fifty metres deep. The terminal installations on the French side cover 520 hectares, i.e. the size of an international airport. Of the five French companies that met this exceptional technical challenge, VINCI is represented through two of its businesses, Dumez and SGE.\n\nCBC\n\n1982\n\nCBC (Campenon Bernard Construction) was founded in 1982 by two former Bouygues managers, Henri Becq et Gilbert Simonet, with the support of parent company Campenon Bernard, which wanted to develop building activities. CBC began by bringing together Campenon Bernard's construction subsidiaries, then developed real estate activities and moved into international markets. This policy immediately paid off, and by the end of the 1980s, CBC was among the five leading French companies in the sector.\n\nCBC has three main features: thanks to its research and real estate divisions, it counts as many managers and technicians as workers; it played a pioneering role in Europe, especially in former Czechoslovakia, where it acquired a foothold as early as 1986 (with the hotel forum in Bratislava); lastly, CBC often works with prominent architects, like Richard Meier, who designed the Canal+ head office building, and Ricardo Bofill, responsible for the Swift head office building in Belgium. In 1997, CBC's activities were merged with SGE's other construction businesses within Campenon Bernard.\n\nRaymond Soulas (Chairman from december 1979 to july 1980)\n\n1979\n\nRaymond Soulas, born in Paris on 18 October 1918, was educated at the Lycée Saint-Louis and the Ecole Polytechnique. During the occupation he was deported to Buchenwald. In 1943 he joined SGE as chief engineer and in 1960 was made Managing Director of Tramarance, the company responsible for civil engineering at the La Rance tidal power plant (1960-1967). In 1971, he was named Executive Vice-President and in 1977 Board member and Managing Director of SGE. He was Chairman and CEO of SGE from December 1979 to July 1980. He was Chairman and CEO of Sea Tank Co. from its inception and held the same positions at SGE-TPI. Instrumental in the Sainrapt et Brice merger, he became its Vice-Chairman and CEO in 1979. A year later he was appointed Vice-Chairman and CEO of SGE. Following the acquisition by Saint-Gobain, he remained on the board but retired from all his other positions in 1988.\n\nGTIE\n\n1972\n\nGTIE, the VINCI group's Energy and Information division, was created in 1972 under the name Union des Entreprises Electriques Régionales (UEER). It was designed to bring together three long-standing, recognised companies in the electrical sector: MJB (the result of from the merger of Mors with Jean Bouchon) Garczynski Traploir and Fournié Grospaud. In 1984, Compagnie Générale des Eaux (now called Vivendi) became the sole shareholder of UEER, which changed its name to GTIE. GTIE made several acquisitions. Soon, it included over one hundred companies. The group became leader in France in electrical engineering.\n\nIn 1996, GTIE became a direct subsidiary of SGE, and was expanded to include SDEL and Santerne. With a network of over 700 companies, GTIE is now a leader in Europe in engineering, integration and maintenance of information and energy systems.\n\nEMCC\n\n1971\n\nEntreprises Morillon-Corvol et Courbot was created in 1971 from the merger of two companies with strong reputations in maritime works and harbour construction. Morillon-Courvol was founded in 1885 to operate the sand deposits of the Paris region. It played a crucial role in building the Gennevilliers port and in dredging the Seine river to make it navigable by larger vessels.\n\nCourbot dates back to 1925 and was also very active in the Paris area, though its main markets were France's colonies and overseas territories.\n\nThe two companies merged in 1971 under the name EMCC, which became a subsidiary of SGE in 1983 and was integrated into Campenon Bernard.\n\nViafrance\n\n1971\n\nViafrance, created in 1971, inherited the expertise and culture of two roadwork companies, Vialit and Viasphalte.\n\nVialit was founded in 1925 under the impetus of Georges Courtois, who wanted to promote surface coatings and bitumen emulsions. Until 1970, the company was managed by Lionel Ignace, co-founder of USIRF (the French Union of Roadworks Companies) in 1936.\n\nViasphalte was created in 1933, under the impetus of Entreprises Léon Ballot. After the second world war, it became a subsidiary of Campenon Bernard. Viasphalte owed its success to thorough knowledge of American technology and equipment. By the 1960s, it enjoyed a strong presence in France and abroad. Viasphalte built a 187-km road from Safi to Aqaba in Jordan.\n\nVialit and Viasphalte's activities, which were complementary, were combined in 1971. In 1997, Viafrance merged with Cochery Bourdin Chaussé to form Eurovia.\n\nCofiroute\n\n1970\n\nIn 1970, France had just 1,000 km of motorways. To accelerate the development of the French network, without draining public resources, the government decided to tap private financing through concessions. Five public works groups, including SGE, GTM and Jean Lefèvre, took part in the creation of Cofiroute, alongside two banks, Société Générale and Paribas. The financial risks were substantial and the investment did not pay off for over 15 years. Since 1970, Cofiroute has built over 800 km of motorways in western France, including the Paris-Poitiers link (A10), the Paris-Le Mans link and the Angers-Nantes link (A11). In 1988, it also launched the first motorway radio station, Autoroute FM (107.7). A 65% subsidiary of VINCI, Cofiroute is now present in Europe, North and South America and has acquired a small foothold in Asia.\n\nSOGEPARC\n\n1968\n\nFinancial company SOGEPARC was created in 1968, probably under the impetus of Spie Batignolles, which, like GTM, was increasingly interested in parking concessions. By 1974, SOGEPARC managed 23 parking lots. By 1987, the number of lots under management had increased to 37 and the company was listed on the stock market. From then on, SOGEPARC recorded robust growth. In 1997, it was the largest underground car park operator in France, with 78 lots under management, and began stepping up activities abroad.\n\nIn 1998, following a successful takeover bid, SOGEPARC became part of the SGE group. VINCI's merger with GTM paved the way for the merger of SOGEPARC with Parcs GTM, which led to the creation in 2001 of the world leader in parking concessions: VINCI Park.\n\nParcs GTM\n\n1963\n\nIn the early 1960s, Paris was the first French city to be confronted with exponential growth in automobile traffic and an acute shortage of parking spaces The Paris authorities decided to promote the construction of underground parking lots through concession contracts. In 1963, GTM won the first tender to build and operate a parking lot beneath the Invalides esplanade. This was the beginning of Parcs GTM. The following year, the group won a new contract to build a lot under avenue George V.\n\nUntil 1970, the market was limited to Paris, but in the 1970s, several new parking concessions were created in the provinces, in cities like Toulon and Nancy. In the 1980s, under the impetus of Pierre Léon-Dufour, Parcs GTM won new concessions in Paris, before branching out into international markets. VINCI's merger with GTM paved the way for the merger of Parcs GTM with Sogeparc, the other historical player. Vinci Park, the world leader in parking lots managed under concession, was created in 2001.\n\nSatom\n\n1951\n\nIn 1951, Sainrapt et Brice took over Travaux Afrique. The latter was initially based in Senegal, but soon expanded into Mauritania, Guinea, Togo, Benin and Niger. Travaux Afrique was present in construction, drilling and civil engineering. In 1967, it bought out Sofratom, which had been present in Africa since 1949, and formed SATOM. In the 1970s, the new company was awarded prestigious projects such as the Arlit mining complex, the Japoma rail bridge in Cameroon, and the Saudi embassy in Chad. As a subsidiary of Sainrapt et Brice, it reported 1979 sales that were equal to 70% of the parent company figure. SATOM was one of the biggest assets contributed by Sainrapt et Brice in the 1981 merger with SGE. Since 1984, the company has developed close ties with Sogea and plays a major role in Africa, particularly in roadworks.\n\nSicra\n\n1944\n\nIn 1944, anticipating on the reconstruction needs of post-war France, MM. Raimond and Metrich, architects in Lyon, founded Société Industrielle de Constructions Rapides (SICRA). After carrying out several emergency construction projects, the company began work on standardised housing projects. Unable to develop fast enough on its own, SICRA became part of SGE in 1954 and spearheaded SGE's construction activities. In a 1960s advertisement, SICRA made the following claim: \"SICRA can give you the building you need in just 90 days. Just choose from our stock of prefabricated units\". A close partner of the French national education authorities in the Paris area, SICRA was integrated into SGE subsidiary Sogea in 1986. Within Sogea, SICRA is a leader in the Paris market and has continued to expand in the renovation, housing and services sectors.\n\nFreyssinet\n\n1943\n\nCreated to market prestressed concrete (1943-1962)\n\nFreyssinet was founded in 1943 under the name Société Technique pour l’Utilisation de la Précontrainte (STUP). Edme Campenon, the founder of Campenon Bernard, wanted to apply the patents for prestressed concrete filed in 1928 by Eugène Freyssinet. Prestressed concrete is reinforced concrete whose performance is enhanced by built-in stress, which offsets the external stress the concrete is subjected to. The new process, which allowed for substantial savings in steel and concrete, proved extremely useful in France during the reconstruction period that followed World War II. In just a few years, STUP became a recognised specialist in the construction of bridges and runways, but the company's performance was largely driven by Eugène Freyssinet exceptional creativity.\n\nBreaking into international markets (1963-1981)\n\nIn the early 1960s, STUP lost its founder and faced increased competition in prestressed technology. The company overcame these difficulties by accelerating expansion abroad, as reflected in the change of name from STUP to Freyssinet International in 1976. Innovation, as demonstrated by the Rio-Niterio bridge in Brazil, and the Montreal Olympics centre, remained a key value for Freyssinet International engineers and a major asset.\n\nGlobal leadership (1982-2000)\n\nIn the early 1980s, Freyssinet experienced problems and was forced to divest some of its foreign subsidiaries. The company's technological expertise continued to be highly valued and the company eventually recovered its momentum. Projects such as the Normandy bridge in France, the Vasco de Gama bridge in Portugal, Cardiff stadium in the United Kingdom, and the Hibernia platform off Newfoundland all represent spectacular achievements that make Freyssinet the world leader in specialised civil engineering.\n\nEugène Freyssinet (1879-1962)\n\n1929\n\nEugène Freyssinet was born in the Corrèze region and went to school in Paris, at the Lycée Chaptal, and later at Ecole Polytechnique and Ecole des Ponts et Chaussées. After working for the government for nearly ten years, he was active in developing Entreprises Limousin, of which he became a partner. Freyssinet performed amazing technical feats, thanks to his love of innovation.\n\nIn 1929, he left Entreprises Limousin because the company was not interested in developing prestressed concrete, which Freyssinet had invented a year earlier. The technology was later developed with the support of Edme Campenon and STUP, a company created to market Freyssinet's invention, through which Freyssinet was able to fully express his talent.\n\nBourdin et Chaussé\n\n1928\n\nIn 1928, Sylvain Bourdin and Louis Chaussé teamed up to create a road construction company, focused mainly on markets in western France. As of 1945, Bourdin et Chaussé, expanded beyond its regional base and successfully moved into Africa, where it built the \"road of the sands\" in the Sahara, and participated in the construction of the Uranium road in Niger. These projects, some of which were risky, established the company's reputation. In 1977, it became a subsidiary of SGE and merged with Cochery in 1985. The new company, Cochery Bourdin Chaussé, merged with Viafrance in 1997 to form Eurovia.\n\nLouis Loucheur (Founder)\n\n1928\n\nLouis Loucheur was born in 1872 to a protestant family based in Roubaix. Like his partner Alexandre Giros, he was a graduate of Ecole Polytechnique and in addition to his professional activities, was very involved in politics. Loucheur was noticed for his organisational talents and his knowledge of the weapons sector and, in 1916, he was appointed Under-Secretary of State in charge of artillery and munitions, a vital job in war time. In 1917, he replace Albert Thomas as Minister of Armament, and gave priority to intensifying production.\n\nAt the end of the war, he was appointed Minister of Industrial Reconstruction, then Minister of the Liberated Regions. He played a major role in the settlement of German reparations, though the surrounding dispute led to his resignation in 1922. In 1928, Loucheur, who always supported progressive policies, succeeded in getting the so-called Loucheur law voted. The law called for the construction of 200,000 low-cost housing units over a period of five years. The basis for increased government involvement in the sector was thus established. Louis Loucheur devoted the last years of his life in pursuit of the European ideal, albeit in vain. He died in 1931.\n\nEntreprise Jean Lefebvre\n\n1927\n\nOriginally a family roadworks company, Entreprise Jean Lefebvre's roots go back to 1927, when Charles Lefebvre founded Salviam (\"Save the way\"). Charles Lefebvre was one of the first to use slag from foundries as ballast. Seven years later, he developed a new type of binder and created a company to manufacture fillers and special binders.\n\nIn 1941, Jean Lefebvre, who had already demonstrated a talent for innovation in his father's company, took control of both companies. The following year, the filler and binder company became Entreprise Jean Lefebvre (EJL). In 1944, Jean Lefebvre was awarded a contract by the allied forces to repair Orly airport's runways. In the process, he discovered the efficiency of American equipment.\n\nUpholding the company slogan (\"Jean Lefebvre works for you\"), EJL helped build modern France and acquired a foothold in Africa, with the Dakar-Kaolak road in Senegal and the Cocoa loop in Côte-d’Ivoire. EJL increased its foothold by taking over two companies, Reveto, and Gaétan Brun.\n\nIn the early 1970s, EJL took part in the creation of Cofiroute, demonstrating once again the quality of its roadworks expertise. The group enjoyed strong growth abroad, in Africa as well as in the Middle East.\n\nEJL was restructured in 1981 and came under GTM's control in 1986. EJL continued to develop in France, while expanding in the United States, Canada and Chile. Through GTM, it became a subsidiary of the VINCI group in 2000, and merged with Eurovia.\n\nCochery\n\n1926\n\nIn 1926, Albert Cochery created Entreprises Albert Cochery, specialised in hydrocarbon-based binders for road maintenance. Cochery was present both in the manufacture and implementation of tarmacadam, a blend of foundry slag and tar that was not widely used in France at the time.\n\nFrom 1945 on, distillation factories declined as natural gas deposits were discovered and the steel industry went in recession. Entreprises Albert Cochery acquired Rol Lister & Cie and modified its strategy to become a modern roadworks company and a manufacturer of new road surfaces.\n\nAfter the founder's withdrawal in 1969, his successors continued to grow the company and to acquire capital interests in various roadworks businesses\n\nIn 1985, following SGE's acquisition of a majority interest in the company, Cochery merged with Bourdin et Chaussé. The new unit, Cochery Bourdin Chaussé, merged with Viafrance in 1997 to form Eurovia.\n\nTravaux du Midi\n\n1926\n\nTravaux du Midi was created in Marseille in 1926, under the name Bertagnol et Compagnie. In 1934, Travaux du Midi became part of Grands Travaux de Marseille (GTM), but kept its family organisation. The company did not truly take off until 1961, with the end of the Algerian war and the return to France of European families living in Algeria, who needed new homes and infrastructure. To meet surging demand, Travaux du Midi began to industrialise manufacturing processes. The company was proud of its success in carving out strong positions throughout the south of France. By the early 1980s, it was present from Bordeaux to Nice. An innovative, dynamic company, Travaux du Midi is part of GTM Construction, a subsidiary of the VINCI group.\n\nFroment Clavier\n\n1922\n\nFounded in 1922, Froment Clavier was specialised in the construction of grain silos made from reinforced concrete. At the time, Grands Moulins de Paris was one of its main clients. In its search for new outlets, Froment Clavier started exporting its technology to the French colonies. The company also took part in the construction of subsidised housing, according to the wishes of Louis Loucheur. To meet the needs of post-war France, the company diversified into new areas, from housing to industrial construction, and urban infrastructure, while retaining close ties to the flour mills. In the early 1980s, the company had problems modernising its business and finding new clients. Limited to small-scale projects, Froment Clavier was acquired by Campenon Bernard in 1964. The Froment Clavier brand was phased out.\n\nCampenon Bernard\n\n1920\n\n1920-1945\n\nCampenon Bernard was created in 1920 by a young engineer, Edme Campenon, and an entrepreneur, André Bernard. The company focused on the construction of railways, industrial buildings, roads, and hydraulic infrastructure. The construction of the Chambon dam in 1927 was its first big success. After initial difficulties, the project became a test site for new, more resistant concrete. As a result, yields improved and output reached a record-breaking one thousand cubic metres a day.\n\nAnticipating new technological developments, Campenon Bernard teamed up with Eugène Freyssinet and gave the latter the opportunity to use prestressing technology in major infrastructure. Just before World War II, Campenon Bernard dominated the civil engineering market. During the war, the company pursued honourable business objectives and took part in the creation of STUP (société technique pour l’utilisation de la précontrainte) to market processes developed by Eugène Freyssinet.\n\n1945-1984\n\nIn the post-war period, the group was involved in a number of construction sites in France, the colonies and other countries. Wherever it went, Campenon Bernard provided ingenious and innovative technical solutions as shown by projects such as the Marcoule nuclear power plant and the Choisy-le-Roi bridge. In 1962, however, the virtuous cycle ended with the death of Edme Campenon and Eugène Freyssinet.\n\nThe engineers of Campenon Bernard continued to renew the group's expertise, thanks to civil and military engineering contracts and the construction of several bridges as well as the Oléron viaduct. From 1962 to 1970, over half of all bridges in France were the work of Campenon Bernard. Projects such as the Montparnasse tower in Paris and the Montreal subway further raised the group's reputation, in an environment of heightened competition.\n\n1984-2000\n\nIn 1984, Compagnie Générale des Eaux took over Campenon Bernard. The company won recognition for the construction of the Jules Verne viaduct in Amiens, where it broke the world record for thrust (15,300 tonnes). Campenon Bernard joined SGE in 1988. Under the name Campenon Bernard-SGE, it was responsible for prestigious projects, such as the Stade de France stadium and the Vasco de Gama bridge in Lisbon.\n\nGarczynski Traploir\n\n1919\n\nConstruction engineers André Garczynski and Gaston Traploir met in the trenches of World War I. After the war, they created a company in Le Mans to build electrical networks. The company soon became a leader in western France. In the 1930s, it added water services to its business portfolio.\n\nAfter world War II, Garczynski Traploir became a subsidiary of Compagnie Générale des Eaux. The company recorded spectacular industrial growth, driven by demand for high-voltage power lines, water towers and power plants.\n\nIn 1970, Garczynski Traploir's activities were combined with those of Mors Jean Bouchon and Fournié-Grospaud within a holding company called UEER, which later became GTIE. Garczynski Traploir is specialised in electrical power, information and communication technologies and has continued to develop within GTIE, VINCI's Energy and Information division.\n\nAndré Garczynski (1888-1944)\n\n1919\n\nAndré Garczynski's family was originally from Poland and settled in France in the Sarthe region during the Napoleonic wars. Garczynski studied at the Electricity Institute of Grenoble. In 1919, he founded a company with Gaston Traploir. Garczynski was an automobile lover. He was also very interested in social issues and was actively involved in the creation of Caisses d'Assurances Sociales, ancestor of the French public health insurance system. In 1940 he stayed behind in Le Mans to look after his company. He was arrested by the Gestapo in 1943 and deported to Buchenwald, where he died a year later.\n\nCharles Rebuffel (1861-1942)\n\n1917\n\nBorn in a family of Marseilles traders, Charles Rebuffel joined GTM after graduating from Ecole Polytechnique and Ecole des Ponts et Chaussées. At GTM, he was in charge of building a sewage system for the city of Marseille. Thanks to the success of this first project, he soon became key player at GTM and was eventually appointed chairman from 1917 to 1940.\n\nAn influential player in the electricity sector, he sat on the boards of several businesses and chaired five companies, though GTM was always his main concern. Thanks to the help of his managers, he organised the group into a powerful network of subsidiaries and industrial holdings.\n\nCegelec\n\n1913\n\nCegelec's history is closely linked to the development of the electricity and energy sectors in France and Europe. It has its roots in the creation of the French CGEE (Compagnie Générale d'Entreprises Electriques) in 1913. From success to expansion, the company has become an international group providing technological services to companies and public authorities.\n\n1913\n\nCreation of the CGEE, holding of electrical companies, in order to install and build electricity networks, lines, substations and power plants necessary for France's electrification.\n\n1971 Formation of CGEE Alsthom, after the takeover in 1967 of the SGE (Public works and civil engineering, construction, industrial works, electricity services). This was Europe's largest electrical engineering company, with 13,000 employees and sales of almost one billion French francs.\n\n1989\n\nGEC (General Electric Company) acquired a 24,50% stake in CGEE Alsthom and transferred its industrial control businesses to this company. CGEE Alsthom changed its name to Cegelec.\n\n1998/2000\n\nCegelec was bought by Alstom and became afterwards Alstom Contracting.\n\n2001\n\nAlstom Contracting was acquired by its managers and employees in a LMBO (leverage management buy-out) with the backing of financial institutions and was renamed Cegelec. A second LMBO took place in 2006.\n\n2008\n\nQatari Diar, a global actor in Real Estate Development and Investment, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Qatar Investment Authority, acquired Cegelec.\n\n14 April 2010\n\nEntry into force of the strategic partnership between Qatari Diar and VINCI. Cegelec becomes a wholly-owned VINCI subsidiary.\n\nSDEL\n\n1907\n\nCharles Saunier, a graduate of Ecole Polytechnique, and Maurice Duval created Saunier Duval et Compagnie in 1907. The company kept its name until 1990. Charles Saunier was a former manager of Bengel Frères, a manufacturer of public heating and lighting systems, especially gas-powered. The new company focused on exactly the same sectors and won prestigious contracts, providing lighting for automobile and aviation trade fairs at the Grand Palais in Paris and for the 1931 colonial exhibition.\n\nSaunier Duval diversified into the manufacturing of water heaters and gas powered heaters. After World War II, Saunier Duval opened several branches and acquired leading players in the gas and electricity sectors.\n\nThe company gradually reorganised around several industrial activities (gas, bathroom installations, public lighting, electrical engineering and industrial automation systems). After becoming a subsidiary of Saint-Gobain, Saunier Duval became part of SGE in 1985. Today it is a subsidiary of GTIE.\n\nTunzini\n\n1906\n\nTunzini, a company specialised in heating equipment, was founded by Ernest Tunzini in 1906. Tunzini designed the heating systems of the Printemps department store in Paris, and then went on to promote the advantages of ventilation systems, before becoming a pioneer of air conditioning technology. In the 1950s, the family company became international and entered industrial air conditioning markets abroad.\n\nIn 1966, after sixty years as Chairman, Ernest Tunzini retired and sold his company to Pont-à-Mousson. From then on, Tunzini underwent two major mergers, in 1968 with Améliorair (an aero thermal company founded in 1935) and in 1976 with climate control specialist Nessi. Tunzini became Tunzini Nessi Entreprises d’Equipements (TNEE). In 1985, it became a subsidiary of SGE, shortly after the latter's acquisition by Saint-Gobain Pont-à-Mousson.\n\nThe company was then renamed Tunzini, and in the 1990s, it reinforced its positions in thermal equipment, notably for climate control and fire protection. In March 2000, the thermal mechanics division, which included G+H Montage, a major player in the German insulation market, was transferred to GTIE, VINCI's Energy and Information division.\n\nThinet\n\n1905\n\nThinet was founded in 1905 in Saint-Romain-le-Puy, a small town of the Loire region. The founder, Antoine Thinet, developed a strong regional business base, which later enabled the company to expand nationwide, as of 1936, under the founder's son, Marcel Thinet. The latter implemented two principles of modern management: site planning and industrialisation. Under his leadership, Thinet moved to Paris and built several subsidised housing projects in the Saint-Denis and Suresnes suburbs. It also worked on the Achères water treatment plant and opened an office in Abidjan.\n\nIn 1965, Thinet became an SGE subsidiary to increase its financial clout. It's performance was excellent until the early 1980s, when it encountered serious financial problems. SGE decided to keep only the activities in southern France and to integrate them to Sogea.\n\nBrüggemann\n\n1899\n\nFranz Brüggemann, a construction engineer, founded the Brüggemann company in Duisberg, Germany in 1899. The company did fairly well at first, but did not truly take off until after World War II, when it participated in the reconstruction of major German infrastructure, such as the Breidenbacher Hof hotel in Dusseldorf. Brüggemann won a strong reputation as a reliable partner in civil engineering projects, especially maritime and river infrastructure and prefabricated industrial structures. It also strengthened its international presence, especially in Arab countries. In the 1970s, Brüggemann increased its expertise in construction and civil engineering, major infrastructure and turnkey projects. In 1992, Campenon Bernard Construction (CBC) purchased an interest in the company. Five years later, CBC became part of SGE. Since then, Brüggemann's future has been closely linked to that of SGE, now the VINCI group.\n\nSGE\n\n1899\n\nFoundation of SGE\n\nIn 1899, Alexandre Giros et Louis Loucheur, engineers and graduates of Ecole Polytechnique, founded a civil engineering company, which soon became SGE (Société Générale D'Entreprise). Thanks to buoyant markets in electricity and railway construction, the company was an immediate success. By 1910, SGE was the second-largest company in the sector. During the first world war, the group focused on national defence projects. After the war, despite a sometimes difficult environment, it continued to grow, participating in major projects such as the Truyère and Drac sites. The company was hard hit by World War II and forced to abandon its positions in the colonies. In 1946, SGE was confronted with the French government's decision to nationalise electrical power.\n\nA leader in civil engineering\n\nUnder the management of Jean Matheron and Paul Huvelin, Alexandre Giros's sons-in-law, SGE redeployed massively into civil engineering. In projects such as the Génissiat and Bin-el-Ouidane dams and the Rance tidal power plant, SGE demonstrated significant technical expertise, and established itself as the unrivalled leader in the profession. SGE was taken over by Compagnie Générale d’Electricité (now Alcatel). In 1966, it took part in the creation of Cofiroute. In 1982, it merged with Sainrapt et Brice. From 1984 to 1988, the company was part of Saint-Gobain before it was taken over by Compagnie Générale des Eaux (now Vivendi). When SGE merged with Campenon Bernard, also a holding company, it kept its name and legal identity. All of these transactions radically changed SGE's profile, turning it into a holding company with many subsidiaries.\n\nFrom SGE to VINCI\n\nIn the early 1990s, SGE launched several takeovers to reinforce its position in Europe. In 1997, it exchanged household waste treatment and water distribution activities for CGE's (Vivendi) electrical engineering business (GTIE). SGE was thus able to reorganise around four divisions: Construction, Energy and Information, Roads and Concessions. The year 2000 saw several major changes: following Vivendi's withdrawal, SGE became an independent company and changed its name to VINCI. In the second half of 2000, VINCI's successful bid for GTM made it the world leader in the sector, ahead of Skanska of Sweden and Bouygues of France.\n\nAlexandre Giros (Founder and Chairman, 1932-1937)\n\n1899\n\nAlexandre Giros was born in 1870 and studied at Ecole Polytechnique. In 1899, he teamed up with former Polytechnique classmate Louis Loucheur to found SGE. Alexandre Giros helped promote the use of reinforced concrete and was one of the founders of a business organisation of reinforced concrete companies in 1903.\n\nGiros was also a leading player in the electrical power sector in the XXth century and was active in at least thirteen different companies. In all of his functions, and at SGE, he always applied bold labour policies, but without ever playing a political role, contrary to Louis Loucheur.\n\nNamed commander of the Legion of Honor in 1934, he always upheld the values of hard work and family duty. Through his daughters Denise and Madeleine, who respectively married Jean Matheron and Paul Huvelin, two future SGE leaders, the Giros family continued to control the company for a long time after Alexandre Giros's death in 1937.\n\nGTM\n\n1891\n\nThe birth of a leader\n\nGrands Travaux de Marseille (GTM) was created in Marseille in 1891 by local businessmen to equip the city with a modern sewage system. The work was carried out by Charles Rebuffel, who turned GTM into a leader in French civil engineering. Until 1914, the company recorded steady growth, driven by diversification into new technologies (electrical works, harbour construction and underground structures) and by foreign markets. The war weakened GTM's position and forced it to refocus on industrial construction and electrical works. Efforts to redeploy continued throughout the roaring twenties. During that period, GTM was very successful in the French colonies. Thanks to its presence abroad, the company was less affected by World War II. During the war, it built several electrical facilities (e.g. the Génissiat dam) and carried out projects for the occupation forces.\n\nThe post-war boom\n\nThe first sites of the post-war reconstruction period allowed GTM to recover quickly. But the group was confronted with the challenge of decolonisation. To sustain growth, GTM relied on its ability to innovate, as reflected in the Havana tunnels and the Savines bridge. As of 1957, under the chairmanship of René Gonon, the company won several contracts in Africa, and notably took part in saving the Abu Simbel temple, in work on the Nile river, and in projects in North and South America and the Middle East. GTM diversified into offshore oil structures, nuclear power plants, and concessions, through parking lots and Cofiroute. GTM succeeded in keeping its historical businesses, while adding new ones.\n\nThe age of alliances\n\nIn 1982, GTM merged with Entrepose, a company created in 1935 by metallurgist groups, with which GTM had a long-standing partnership. Entrepose contributed complementary businesses and markets, like underground pipe systems and drilling and sounding activities. Entrepose enabled GTM to expand in the Middle East and Latin America. Yet when orderbooks from emerging countries began to shrink, GTM-Entrepose was forced to retrench to European markets. Fortunately, the French market offered many opportunities. GTM-Entrepose was general contractor for the Georges Pompidou Centre and the La Villette science park. In 1987, Dumez acquired an interest in GTM-Entrepose. As of 1994, Dumez and GTM-Entrepose began considering a merger of their construction and civil engineering activities. The merger became effective two years later. The new entity, called Groupe GTM, became part of the VINCI group in 2001.\n\nDumez\n\n1890\n\nFrom metal frames to reinforced concrete (1890-1944)\n\nIn 1890, the year Gustave Eiffel finished building the tower named after him, Alexandre Dumez created a company specialised in metal frames. The first world war forced the company to refocus on reinforced concrete. This decision was strengthened with the arrival of Pierre Chaufour, soon joined by his brother André, to head the company. Under their leadership, the Dumez company acquired a lasting foothold in Africa.\n\nThe breakthrough (1944-1972)\n\nThanks to the post-war boom and the surge in housing, the company recorded strong growth in metropolitan France. Even so, Dumez's most spectacular achievements were in Africa and soon afterwards in other continents. The Nebeur dam in Tunisia became a symbol of national pride, the Dokan dam in Iraq strengthened Dumez's international reputation, and with the Hendrik Verwoerd site, Dumez broke existing records in dam construction\n\nA powerful group (1972 -2000)\n\nOrganised around several strong subsidiaries, the Dumez group did not suffer from the recession and won several prestigious contracts, including the Yamoussoukro basilica, the new Ministry of Finance in Paris, and the Grand Louvre. Dumez acquired an interest in Chantiers Modernes and, in 1989, bought CFE, the historical leader of the Belgian construction market. Dumez merged with Lyonnaise des Eaux and with GTM, before joining the VINCI group.\n\nDeschiron\n\n1885\n\nDeschiron was founded in 1885 by Gaston Deschiron, a native of the Creuse region in central France, and operated as a family company. From the start, it developed a fairly diversified business base. Deschiron built several bridges and took part in the construction of the Maginot line. After the second world war, it worked for industry, including steel works and electrical utility EDF(e.g. the Gerstheim falls on the Alsace canal and the Arrighi power plant). SGE acquired an interest in the company in 1958. From then on, Deschiron specialised in earthmoving and made a vital contribution to transport infrastructure projects. In 1982, following the family's withdrawal, Deschiron became a fully-owned subsidiary of SGE. Initially, the company was part of Sogea, but as of 1992, it was integrated into Campenon Bernard.\n\nCFE\n\n1880\n\nCCFE was created in Belgium in 1880, under the impetus of Victor Tercelin-Monjot and Frédéric de la Hault, a Belgian entrepreneur specialised in tramway construction.\n\nThe company's initial name (Compagnie Générale de Chemins de Fer Secondaires) reflected its focus on regional railways and tramway systems. Soon management started to concentrate on international development and the company was awarded projects on the trans-Iranian railway. The Belgian Congo also became one of its key markets until the country's independence in 1960. International expansion together with increased diversification enabled CFE to withstand the effects of decolonisation.\n\nIn 1981, CFE purchased Entreprises Ed. François et fils, a company founded in 1868, and became the largest construction company in Belgium. Six years later, in 1987, Dumez acquired an interest in CFE, which still had a strong presence in the Benelux, Africa and the Middle East. CFE was notably sustained by its powerful dredging subsidiary, which was called DEME (Dredging Environmental and Maritime Engineering) in 1991. VINCI holds 45.25% in CFE, which remains the leader in the Belgian construction market.\n\nSogea\n\n1878\n\nA former subsidiary of Pont-à-Mousson\n\nThe story of Eau et Assainissement (the ancestor of Sogea) began in 1878, under the name Etablissements Charles Gibaut. The company did not take the name Eau et Assainissement until 1918, when Pont-à-Mousson decided to add water treatment activities to its traditional foundry business. From the start, Eau et Assainissement was present throughout France, notably in Paris (where it built pipes to supply the city with water from the Voulzie river), Bordeaux and Caen.\n\nIt also developed a strong presence in Africa. In 1925, for example, it won a contract to pipe water from the Bou Redine river to Bone in Algeria. A widespread geographical presence helped the group survive the second world war. But Algerian independence in 1961 hastened Eau et Assainissement's merger with Socoman, another Pont-à-Mousson subsidiary with the same chairman and directors.\n\nPipes and civil engineering\n\nThe new company, called Socea, began to diversify under the management of Jacques Lesage. In 1979, it merged with Pont-à-Mousson's construction businesses, Balency-et-Schuhl and GTBA, which had already been merged under the name Balency-Briard. In 1986, the new company, called Sobea, merged with SGE's construction and civil engineering business, and became Sogea, a subsidiary of SGE, now the VINCI group. In France and abroad, through its many subsidiaries, Sogea took part in several projects, such as the Nice airport or the hydraulic and a water treatment plant in Lagos\n\nDodin\n\n1865\n\nAlthough Dodin's origins date back to 1865, the company did not begin to play a major role in maritime and river works until the 1920s. From then on, Abel Dodin, son of the founder, decided to make the company a specialist in these areas.\n\nDodin enjoyed a strong presence in western France and took advantage of the post-war boom to move into the Paris region, where it carried out work on the Seine and Marne rivers, before moving into the rest of France and abroad. At the beginning of the 1970s, it won a major market to build the Mina Sulman port in Bahrain.\n\nIn 1983, Dodin became a subsidiary of the Saint-Gobain group and, later, a subsidiary of Sogea.\n\nSainrapt et Brice\n\n1852\n\nSainrapt et Brice was created in two stages. In 1852, Michel Sainrapt set up a company specialised in consolidation works and special foundations. Upon his death, he was succeeded by his daughter-in-law. In 1901, she teamed up with a young engineer named Alexis Brice, who had been recruited by Michel Sainrapt, to create Sainrapt et Brice. Though Sainrapt et Brice remained a family-owned company, it reported strong growth, thanks to effective use of reinforced concrete, as demonstrated by the construction of the Banque de France branch in Caen in 1922.\n\nDuring World War II, Sainrapt et Brice chose collaboration with the Germans. Louis-Pierre Brice, Alexis Brice's heir, who was chairman during the war years, was banned from running the company for several years. Sainrapt et Brice, however, was allowed to continue to operate and was awarded major work in the port of Dunkirk in 1947. In the 1950s, it installed electrical power facilities at the Carla falls on the Agout river near Castre.\n\nSainrapt et Brice successfully expanded in France's overseas territories. The company recorded its greatest successes in Africa, through subsidiary Satom. Satom reported strong growth, while the parent company Sainrapt et Brice suffered a deep recession. Sainrapt et Brice was purchased by Devars-Naudo and merged with SGE in 1981.\n\nMors\n\n1851\n\nMors, founded in 1851 by a Parisian craftsman, always embraced the latest technologies. The company started out as a specialist in electrical equipment, then focused on railway signals. At the beginning of the XXth century, it moved into automobile construction. Mors's chairmen were Louis and Eugène Mors, the latter a pioneer of the automotive industry, on a par with other great names, such as Bollé, Clément and Michelin.\n\nMors moved into electrical appliances and even developed a scooter model. It did not decide to focus once and for all on electrical installations until the 1960s. Mors then merged with Jean et Bouchon, a company specialised in electrical installations based in eastern France, and became MJB (Mors Jean Bouchon).\n\nIn 1970, holding company UEER brought together Garczynski Traploir, MJB and Fournié-Grospaud. In 1984, after merging with MJB, UEER became GTIE (Générale de Travaux et d’Installations Electriques), the VINCI group's Energy and Information division."
