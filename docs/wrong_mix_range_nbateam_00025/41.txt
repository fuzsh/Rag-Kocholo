Collegiate Career

For college, Boozer committed to Duke University. Playing under coach Mike Krzyzewski, he led the Blue Devils to the 2001 NCAA Championship title. Among his other accomplishments at Duke, Boozer scored over 600 points during the 2001-02 season along with Mike Dunleavy Jr. Because he didn't complete his degree at the time, Boozer officially graduated from Duke in 2020.

Cleveland Cavaliers

Foregoing his final year at Duke, Boozer declared for the NBA draft in April of 2002. He was ultimately chosen with the 35th overall pick by the Cleveland Cavaliers. In his rookie season, Boozer averaged 10 points and 7.5 rebounds per game. For his second season in 2003-04, he averaged 15.5 points and 11.4 rebounds per game.

Utah Jazz

Boozer became a restricted free agent in 2004. During this time, he was offered a $70 million, six-year contract with the Utah Jazz, which he ended up signing. In his first season with the team, Boozer averaged 17 points and 9 rebounds per game, with an injury sidelining him for the end of the season. He began the 2005-06 season still recovering, and was only able to return in late February. Boozer went on to finish the season strong, however, averaging more than 20 points and nearly 10 rebounds per game. He subsequently had a promising start to the 2006-07 season, helping the Jazz win 11 of their first 12 games. Advancing to the playoffs, the Jazz took out the Houston Rockets in the first round, with Boozer tying his career-high 41 points in the second game. The Jazz went on to defeat the Golden State Warriors in the next round, before falling to the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Finals. Boozer finished his first playoffs appearance with 23.5 points and 12.2 rebounds per game.

Boozer had another impressive season in 2007-08, becoming one of the league's top scorers and rebounders. He once again led the Jazz to the playoffs to face the Rockets for the second consecutive year. Although the Jazz beat the Rockets again, they fell to the Los Angeles Lakers in the second round. The next season, Boozer was sidelined for 44 games due to knee surgery; many questioned whether he would remain with the Jazz. Ultimately, he decided to stick around for one last season, during which he averaged 19.5 points and 11.2 rebounds per game.

Chicago Bulls
