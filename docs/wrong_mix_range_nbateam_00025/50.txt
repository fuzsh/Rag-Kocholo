A report coming out of the Chicago Sun Times via Joe Cowley is stating that the Chicago Bulls have informed Carlos Boozer that he will be amnestied by the team and immediately become part of the 2014 NBA free agency class. This coming season was the final year of his five-year deal; he would have made $16.8 million.

Boozer has spent four years with the Bulls averaging 15.5 points and 9.0 rebounds. These numbers are just slightly below his career averages of 16.6 and 9.8. His best years came while he was a member of the Utah Jazz under legendary coach Jerry Sloan. There he averaged almost 20 points a game and 10.5 rebounds.

Boozer is still an effective power forward in the league and should be able to find a home quickly. He's not going to be able to be the massively efficient player that he was in the past (his FG% has dropped three straight seasons), but he will definitely find a home.

Minnesota should not be a landing spot for Boozer though. Not sure if his feud with Prince isn't totally settled yet.
