        "text": "By Kaitlyn Kupiec\n\n@kaitlynkupiec\n\nThe unbreakable bond between twins Cameron and Cayden Boozer has landed them both in ESPN’s Top 60 recruits for the class of 2025. The sons of Carlos Boozer, a two-time NBA All-Star, play for Christopher Columbus High School (FL).\n\nCameron excels at scoring across all three levels. Defensively, he showcases shot-blocking abilities and can effectively apply pressure, capable of guarding any of the five positions. Additionally, he stands out as a vocal leader, consistently contributing to team communication. Standing at 6-foot-9, Cameron combines size, strength and tenacity in his position as a power forward.\n\nCayden, a 6-foot-5 point guard, dictates the tempo of the game and effectively locates open teammates. He demonstrates proficiency in exploiting gaps, identifying open players and tightening defensive positions. His defensive skills, particularly in playing the lanes, contribute to his status as an elite lockdown defender.\n\nCombined, the brothers put up 43 points in Saturday night’s 81-62 win against Long Island Lutheran (NY). Cameron’s 26 points, seven rebounds and five blocks helped him receive the most valuable player award against the Crusades.\n\nThe Springfield Student sat down with Cameron and Cayden to learn more about their life off the court.\n\nCameron Boozer\n\nDoes being twins help give you a special connection on the court?\n\n“I wouldn’t say a special connection, but since we’re twins, we’ve been playing together our whole life, so that definitely helps a lot.”\n\nYou and Cayden both received offers from the same 14 schools. Have you talked with him about possibly attending the same school?\n\n“Both of us are taking our recruitments separately but at the same time together. All of our decisions and all of our thoughts are separate. Every school we go to, we’re making it clear that they’re recruiting me and also recruiting Cayden.”\n\nIf you could have dinner with any famous athlete, dead or alive, who would it be?\n\n“Lebron, 100 percent.”\n\nWhat is your favorite pre-game meal?\n\n“Outback Steakhouse.”\n\nWhat cartoon character is most like you?\n\n“I would say Spongebob.”\n\nCayden Boozer\n\nHow long have you and Cameron been playing basketball together?\n\n“Basically our whole lives. I think we started playing together in first grade or second grade.”\n\nIn what ways do you and Cameron motivate each other?\n\n“We’re both really good players. I feel like we push each other to try to be the best players we can possibly be, and we both want each other to succeed.”\n\nWhat motto do you live by?\n\n“Probably just stay in the moment. Sometimes you focus on what your future can be like, but just try to enjoy every moment that you get and live in the present.”\n\nIf you could have any celebrity come to a game of yours, who would you want it to be?\n\n“There’s a lot, but one’s Drake. He’s one of the biggest artists right now.”\n\nWhat is your favorite basketball memory?\n\n“Winning our first state championship. That was a great experience, and our fans loved it, and the team was just as excited.”\n\nPhoto courtesy of The Athletic"
