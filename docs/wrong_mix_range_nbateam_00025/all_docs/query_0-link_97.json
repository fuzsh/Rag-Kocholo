        "text": "[new_royalslider id=”139″]\n\nNBA free agency will begin on the first day of July with some teams around the league are already prepping to shape their roster more than a month in advance.\n\nThe Chicago Bulls may be one of the teams ready to mix things up this summer after finishing a disappointing season losing to the up-and-coming Washington Wizards in the first round of the playoffs.\n\n— Lakers Nation Store Is Back! Check Out The Latest Gear! —\n\nAs Chicago gets ready for next year, a few notable players might not return for next season, according to Joe Cowley of the Chicago Sun-Times, the Bulls are reportedly getting ready to use their amnesty provision on Carlos Boozer:\n\nDespite general manager Gar Forman insisting that a decision to seek amnesty on the last season of Boozer’s contract ‘‘doesn’t have to be made until July,’’ sources indicated at the end of the Bulls’ season that a decision already had been made and that Boozer wouldn’t be returning.\n\nAlso, rumors have started to circulate around Chicago that Taj Gibson would receive the role as the starting power forward next season. With this change in the lineup, it seems unlikely that Boozer would be content coming off the bench for the Bulls.\n\nThe 32-year-old has one more season on his contract for $16.8 million. Boozer being amnestied by the Bulls would free up cap space giving the team more flexibility to pursue big-name free agents this summer like Carmelo Anthony and Pau Gasol.\n\n— Think You’re The Biggest Lakers Fan? Take The Ultimate Fan Quiz! —\n\nIf the Lakers were interested in the 11-year veteran, they would have to submit an amnesty waiver claim and pay a portion of his salary. It was also noted last month that Boozer’s agent Rob Pelinka, who also represents Kobe Bryant, could play a role in the Lakers’ pursuit of Chicago’s big man.\n\nThis past season, Boozer only averaged 13.7 points and 8.3 rebounds per game in 29.2 minutes.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nLakers GM Kupchak Says Next Coach Must Get Most Productivity Out Of Kobe Bryant, Plus Likelihood Of Trading The Pick?\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this video"
