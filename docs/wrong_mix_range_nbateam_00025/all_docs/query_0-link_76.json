        "text": "It’s a move that has been expected for quite some time and it looks like it’s finally happening, Carlos Boozer will no longer be a part of the Chicago Bulls.\n\nvia Chicago Sun Times:\n\nA source said Wednesday that Boozer’s departure is a “done deal,” adding that Boozer’s camp already has been informed.\n\nUnder the amnesty provision, Boozer still will be paid the $16.8 million he’s due next season, but it won’t count against the salary cap.\n\nIn their pursuit of Carmelo Anthony, the Bulls were reportedly hoping to complete a sign-and-trade involving Boozer but Knicks president Phil Jackson was adamant that he would not add Boozer to the roster. The Bulls became aware they would have to acquire Anthony as a free agent and amnestying Boozer helps clear up cap space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnthony isn’t the only person they have their eye on. They’re heading to Los Angeles to meet with Lakers free agent, Pau Gasol as not only an alternate to Anthony but also as a possibility of adding them both.\n\nThey’ve also made calls about Lance Stephenson although he’s probably beyond their spending powers. Stephenson reportedly turned down a five-year, $44 million offer from the Pacers. One other person is Trevor Ariza who’s currently being wooed by his current team, the Washington Wizards."
