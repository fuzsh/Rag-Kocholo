        "text": "by Bryan Crawford / @_BryanCrawford\n\nThe first time I got a chance to see Carlos Boozer in his No. 5 Chicago Bulls jersey and uniform at the teams annual media day last week, surrounded by Derrick Rose, Joakim Noah, and Luol Deng, etc., it finally hit me that he really was a part of this team.\n\nI’d be lying if I said that it didn’t give me a chill and make me that much more excited for the NBA season to start just to see the actual product compete on the floor. When you have a veteran guy w ho’s an NBA All-Star and pretty much guaranteed to give you 20 and 10 every single night and you team him with a phenomenal young point guard and a still developing, yet vastly improving young center, as a Bulls fan, you couldn’t help but get excited at the potential havoc this team was going to wreak around the League this year.\n\nBut that was Monday.\n\nBy Sunday, word had come down that on Saturday — a day off for the team — Carlos Boozer had broken the fifth metacarpal bone in his right hand; an injury that will require surgery (that he’ll undergo on Tuesday) and put him on the shelf for at least 8 weeks.\n\nTalk about a buzz kill.\n\nIn any case, Boozer checks in at No. 20 in SLAMonline’s Top 50 this year, jumping 12 spots from a year ago. After playing in only 37 games in ’08-’09 due to injury, Booz made a remarkable comeback and played in 78 games during the ’09-‘10 season where he averaged 19.5 points and 11.2 rebounds per game. But even more than his play – let’s be honest, Booz puts up numbers like that on the regular – his jump in the rankings is largely based on the fact that everyone with a vote expected him to be a beast in the top heavy, but still much improved Eastern Conference this year. This injury to his hand is certainly a setback to that manifestation.\n\nCarlos Boozer knows he has his critics and acknowledged as much at media day. One of the things he said he was most looking forward to was being able to silence them this season. Of the questions regarding his leadership ability and his attitude, the single biggest knock on him throughout his career has been his health and how seemingly fragile he is (score another one for the critics). It’s worth noting that in eight years in the NBA Boozer has already missed a total of 146 games. Once he does return to action (he’s expected to be out at least 15 games), he’ll have basically missed two full seasons going into his ninth year as a professional, mostly due to injury.\n\nWhen healthy, Carlos Boozer is one of the best power forwards in the game today. He has good size, he’s a good passer for a big man, he possesses tremendous skills around the basket with the ability to finish with either hand, and when it comes to rebounding, there are few guys in the NBA that can do it like Booz. But Bulls fans already know this and they aren’t trying to hear any of that right now; they want to see it.\n\nIn fact, the decision to not go after Carmelo Anthony when the team had the chance will seem even dumber to a lot of people who felt the Bulls should’ve done whatever it took — like trade Joakim Noah who “coincidentally” just agreed to a new extension — to get Melo in a Bulls uniform.\n\nAfter suffering through suckitude and mediocrity for the past 13 years, this season was supposed to be the beginning of the Chicago Bulls resurgence and the first step toward the team becoming relevant in the NBA again. Most fans thought they would see it happen sooner rather than later but as it stands right now, they’ll just have to wait a little while longer. That shouldn’t be too hard though. Waiting is something that Bulls fans have become accustomed to for a while now.\n\nSLAMonline TOP 50 PLAYERS OVERALL RANK POSITION RANK Player Team Position 2010 2009 2010 2009 Ray Allen Celtics SG 50 36 11 10 Gilbert Arenas Wizards SG 49 34 10 9 Lamar Odom Lakers PF 48 33 14 10 John Wall Wizards PG 47 NR 13 NR OJ Mayo Grizzlies SG 46 46 9 12 Al Horford Hawks C 45 NR 6 NR Jason Kidd Mavs PG 44 45 12 10 Joakim Noah Bulls C 43 NR 5 NR LaMarcus Aldridge Blazers PF 42 39 13 12 David West Hornets PF 41 31 12 8 Monta Ellis Warriors SG 40 NR 8 NR Andrew Bogut Bucks C 39 NR 4 NR Yao Ming Rockets C 38 NR 3 NR Brandon Jennings Bucks PG 37 NR 11 NR Zach Randolph Grizzlies PF 36 NR 11 NR Stephen Curry Warriors PG 35 NR 10 NR David Lee Warriors PF 34 NR 10 NR Brook Lopez Nets C 33 NR 2 NR Gerald Wallace Bobcats SF 32 NR 6 NR Manu Ginobili Spurs SG 31 29 7 8 Tony Parker Spurs PG 30 15 9 3 Kevin Garnett Celtics PF 29 13 9 3 Rudy Gay Grizzlies SF 28 44 5 9 Josh Smith Hawks PF 27 40 8 13 Andre Iguodala 76ers SG 26 26 6 7 Al Jefferson Jazz PF 25 23 7 7 Russell Westbrook Thunder PG 24 NR 8 NR Chauncey Billups Nuggets PG 23 19 7 5 Tyreke Evans Kings PG 22 NR 6 NR Danny Granger Pacers SF 21 21 4 4 Carlos Boozer Bulls PF 20 32 6 9"
