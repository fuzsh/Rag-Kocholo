        "text": "Michael Jordan was the ultimate celebrity when he was in the NBA. His presence alone made the Chicago Bulls a worldwide brand â€“ a fact that now remains to this day. But since his departure from the league, the Bulls have produced plenty more star-level players.\n\nThe most notable of the bunch was Derrick Rose, whose connection to the city of Chicago made him a fan favorite. In turn, the Rose-led Bulls were one of the more popular teams in recent memory. With Luol Deng, Joakim Noah, Carlos Boozer, and others by his side, Rose brought the Bulls back onto the main stage."
