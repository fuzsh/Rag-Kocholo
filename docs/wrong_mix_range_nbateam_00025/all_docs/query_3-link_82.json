Although fans may like to give him a hard time for his lapses on defense and his non-stop screaming on the court, the 12-year veteran has been one of the more reliable players on Tom Thibodeau’s squad.\n\nOne of the more affable guys in the Bulls locker room, Boozer turned 32-years-old on Wednesday; ancient by today’s NBA standards.\n\nBut the Bulls big man works hard and plays hard both on and off the court. So make sure you go to his Instagram and Twitter page and wish him a happy birthday as the Bulls prepare for their upcoming six-game road trip."
