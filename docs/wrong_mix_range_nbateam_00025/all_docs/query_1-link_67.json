        "text": "There's been no word on the Duke basketball staff landing official visits from either of 2001 Blue Devil national champ Carlos Boozer's twin sons. But five-star forward Cameron Boozer, No. 1 overall on the 247Sports 2025 Composite, and five-star guard Cayden Boozer, No. 17 overall, have begun scheduling and taking trips elsewhere.\n\nAccording to a report from 247Sports' Travis Branham on Friday, the Christopher Columbus High School (Fla.) standouts are checking out another blueblood, Kentucky, on an official weekend visit. The Wildcats entered the fray with an offer in May.\n\nWhile it's the first official visit in their recruitment, it's not the only one they've scheduled. Last week, 247Sports' Jacob Rudner reported that they will check out another SEC program, Florida, on an official visit the first weekend in November.\n\nSure, the lack of a slated Duke visit is noteworthy. However, it's worth pointing out that the Boozer camp has been relatively hush-hush about their process, so it's conceivable that they've already planned an upcoming trip to Durham without any insiders catching wind of it.\n\nOther notable early suitors for Cameron Boozer and Cayden Boozer (not necessarily a package deal) include Duke's rival, UNC, and the hometown hopeful, Miami.\n\nHere's Branham's summary of what the Boozer twins have to offer wherever they end up:\n\n\"Cameron, a 6-foot-8 power forward, is a dominant and imposing big man with immense skill and versatility that owns a game with his inside-out scoring, passing, defense, and rebounding. Cayden, a 6-foot-4 point guard, is one of the top floor generals in the 2025 class. He has good size, long arms, a physically developed frame, and is an excellent facilitator.\"\n\nThe Boozers, who are no strangers to Blue Devil games due to their father's connections, have not revealed finalists or a decision timeline.\n\nThey are among nine 2025 prospects holding Duke basketball offers. Thus far, head coach Jon Scheyer's wishlist has not produced any commitments, but it's still extremely early in the cycle.\n\nRELATED: Blue Devils Have Growing Interest in Dutch Sharpshooter"
