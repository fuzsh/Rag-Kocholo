        "text": "“Joakim Noah – he’s like a hippie superstar basketball player, like a throwback player,” Boozer said. “If you think about people like Bill Walton in the 70s playing in early 2000s, that was Joakim Noah.\n\n“Luol Deng was like an Iron Man, we had Scalabrine who was probably our 12th or 13th man on the team, but he was a great player. Taj Gibson really could start for most teams; he was that talented.\n\n“We had Nate Robinson off the bench, he’s like a football player and I call him the people’s champ, but he’s like 5’7, 5’8 and he won the dunk contest. We had a cast of characters on that team and had a lot of fun playing together, we thought we had a chance to really win a championship in Chicago.\n\n“Unfortunately, D-Rose got hurt a couple of years in a row and that kind of stopped our thrust but man, I played with some really, really good basketball players.”"
