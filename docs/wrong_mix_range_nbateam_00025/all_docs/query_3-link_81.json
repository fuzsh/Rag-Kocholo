        "text": "Rob Carr/Getty Images\n\nTwo summers ago, the Chicago Bulls were fresh off an early playoff exit against the then Lebron James-led Cleveland Cavaliers. The Bulls lost the series (4-1), as expected, since they were the Eastern Conference's eighth seed.\n\nWhile strong performances by Derrick Rose and Joakim Noah made the pain digest a little smoother considering the Bulls' were wiped off the floor by Lebron and the Cavs, it was clear the Bulls needed a big-time scoring option in the post.\n\nBut the Bulls' performance against the Cavs was only a partial showcase of the glaring need for an efficient post scorer, something Chicago has historically lacked. The Bulls have always failed in their attempts to bring a big-time post scorer to Chicago (Marcus Fizer, Eddy Curry, Michael Sweetney, Drew Gooden).\n\nHowever, in the 2010 free agency, the Bulls gave Chicago a considerable amount of hope when they signed long-time Utah Jazz power forward Carlos Boozer to a five-year, $76 million deal. After Chris Bosh (who signed with the Miami Heat), Boozer was considered the second best power forward in the free agent class.\n\nThe move seemed plausible at the time since Boozer averaged 18.6 points and 10.2 rebounds per game during his six-year stay in Salt Lake City. Part of the reason why Boozer was such a highly touted free agent was his ability to run the pick-and-roll game with Deron Williams in Utah.\n\nOn top of that, Boozer was also a prime-time player in Utah and his play against elite competition in the playoffs added to his free-agency stock. In 44 playoff games with the Jazz, Boozer averaged a ridiculous 20.3 points and 12.5 rebounds per game on .503 percent shooting.\n\nThe only knock on Boozer was his inconsistent health and poor defense. Bulls' GM Gar Forman and VP John Paxson were more focused on his offensive prowess, and thought that his poor defense would be overshadowed by the Bulls' already elite defense.\n\nAlmost two years later, Carlos Boozer has become everything but the PF Forman and Paxson envisioned he would be. His defense has become the target of major ridicule in Chicagoland, and his poor play against elite competition has some people believing that Boozer is more a magician than a basketball player.\n\nThe dominant pick-and-roll game Boozer exhibited in Utah has completely vanished, with Bulls' head coach Tom Thibodeau opting to use center Joakim Noah instead because Noah is a better passer and screen setter. The only offense Boozer has displayed in Chicago is a 15-foot jumper that, contrary to popular belief, is almost a sure thing to go in every time.\n\nAnd while Boozer's stay in Chicago hasn't been a complete disaster, it has certainly failed to meet expectations of a $15 million a year salary.\n\nConsider these stats for a moment. In 48 games against losing teams since joining the Bulls, Boozer has averaged 18.9 points and 9.5 rebounds per game. However, in 34 games against winning teams, Boozer's averaged 14.2 points and 9.1 rebounds.\n\nWow. That's almost a five point a game decrease against good competition. And it isn't like Boozer is seeing a considerable drop in playing time against winning teams either. In 11 games this year against .500+ teams, Boozer is averaging just under 30 minutes a game compared to 31.6 minutes when facing sub -.500 teams.\n\nJonathan Daniel/Getty Images\n\nCouple that with Boozer's horrendous play in last year's playoffs (12.6 points per game on 43 percent shooting), and you can see where the hatred towards Boozer stems from.\n\nHe was specifically brought into the Bulls' organization to be the second scoring option and help the Bulls against other title contenders. So far, Boozer hasn't shown up against elite competition and hasn't proved that he is a consistent scoring threat to compliment Derrick Rose.\n\nOn top of his offensive inconsistencies, Boozer's defense has been awful all the time, against good or bad competition. He normally gets beat in the post and lays on the ground, praying that Joakim Noah's help defense can save an easy bucket.\n\nIf you take all of that into consideration, you'd probably say that Boozer isn't worth his $15 million a year salary.\n\nHowever, like most things in life, it is brighter on the other side. When Carlos Boozer is playing like a $75 million man, the Bulls are lethal.\n\nIn the 83 regular season games Boozer has appeared in for Chicago, the Bulls are 65-18. In the 65 wins, Boozer has averaged 17.5 points and 9.7 rebounds per game. That's right around his career average of 17 points and 10 rebounds. In the 18 losses, however, Boozer has only averaged 15.8 points and 8.1 rebounds per game.\n\nNow look at Boozer's play against good competition. The Bulls are 21-9 against .500+ with Boozer in the lineup. In the 21 wins, Boozer averages 17.1 points and 11 rebounds. That's also right around his career average.\n\nBut here's the most humiliating stat of them all. In the nine losses, Boozer has averaged an horrifying 11.1 points and 6.7 rebounds per game. Yikes!\n\nIf I had to think of one saying to describe Boozer perfectly it would be, \"when it rains it pours.\" There is no doubt that Boozer plays worse in losses. But in losses against good competition, Boozer just doesn't play bad; he plays downright disgusting.\n\nHowever, you can't justify Boozer's performance in nine games plus the playoffs and say he's been a total joke in Chicago. He's actually been better than you think.\n\nBoozer's PER (player efficiency rating) has been hovering close to 20 since he's joined the Bulls. That makes him the second most efficient player on the team during that time frame, trailing only Derrick Rose.\n\nNot bad for a man that is the most hated sports athlete in Chicago.\n\nSo, if you take Boozer's PER and add that to the fact that the Bulls are considerably better when Boozer is playing his best ball, you can argue that Boozer is the key to Chicago making a title run this year. When he's on, the Bulls are on. And when he's off, well, you get the picture.\n\nYou just never know what Carlos Boozer is going to show up. Will it be the two time all-star or the feminine, scared post presence?\n\nCarlos Boozer obviously has a lot left in his tank. He plays efficient basketball on the offensive end, and while his defense is always lethargic, most of the time he makes up for it on the offensive end."
