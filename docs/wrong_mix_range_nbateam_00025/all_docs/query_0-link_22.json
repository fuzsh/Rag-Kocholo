        "text": "You had a lot of options this summer in terms of where you were going to play, so why Chicago? I mean, I know [Nike rep] is here… Carlos Boozer: Yeah, I basically came to Chicago because of [Nike rep]. Holla at him! Nah, honestly, I went through the process. I talked to every team and for me it seemed like Chicago was a perfect fit. I flew out here the first day and I met with the boss, Jerry Reinsdorf, John Paxson, President, and Gar Forman, GM, and I met with Coach Thibs, Tom Thibodeau, and I just loved their DNA.\n\nChicago Bulls power forward Carlos Boozer has lofty expectations for his new team this season. “A championship,” he told ESPNChicago.com on Wednesday night after a Nike House of Hoops event. “I think a realistic goal for us is a championship. I think anything shorter than that we’re setting ourselves up to be shorter than what we can reach. I think [we have] potential to be a championship-level team.”\n\nQ: Why the Chicago Bulls? What made you choose them over other teams? Carlos Boozer: They had everything in place and have championship DNA. They got a lot of young players like Derrick Rose, Joakim Noah, Luol Deng and, for me, it was the perfect fit. I was contemplating other teams and also thought of staying in Utah, but I was overwhelmed by Chicago’s professionalism and how bad they wanted to win again, and not just one championship but multiple championships. They want to get back to that, and I’m looking forward to being a part of it.\n\nAt the time of the deal, the guy who will be in charge of deploying Boozer—coach Tom Thibodeau—had been on the job for just about a month. He was still looking for a house, setting up his new office and trying to figure out Chicago traffic (he has since given up on the traffic thing, and wisely so). But even while tackling those issues, one thing he knew for sure was that he would have plenty of ways to take advantage of Boozer’s rare skills in the offensive post. “It was something that we obviously needed, an experienced guy who can score inside,” Thibodeau told SN.\n\nThe plan starts, of course, with the pick-and-roll game, a strength that Boozer showed consistently in working with point guard Deron Williams in Utah. Second-year Bulls point guard Derrick Rose hasn’t really developed as a pick-and-roll point guard, because the big men he has played with (Tyrus Thomas, Joakim Noah, Taj Gibson) aren’t very threatening to defenses offensively. In fact, the Bulls’ offense generally wasn’t very threatening over the last two seasons—last year, the team ranked 27th in the NBA in offensive efficiency. Boozer changes everything. “That’s the big thing, is his ability to set up the pick-and-roll,” Thibodeau said. “That’s going to make a big difference for the offense—when we get into our halfcourt sets, we are going to be much tougher to guard. Teams won’t be able to focus on Derrick. If you can have a big man who runs the pick-and-roll like Carlos, you are going to have a big advantage. That’s going to make Derrick a much better player.”\n\nWith the addition of several free agents, including power forward Carlos Boozer, Rose expects his role to change slightly. “[I’m working on] extending my jump shot,” Rose said. “Making sure I can knock down a consistent 3 now. “We have Boozer and Joakim [Noah] on their game in the post, so my role is going to have to change a little bit this year. When they swing it out, I’m going to have to shoot that shot and have confidence in it, and that’s what I’ve been working on.”\n\nSpeaking of Boozer, don’t think he didn’t have some impact as to where Korver ended up. The Bulls’ major free-agent acquisition has been in constant contact with Korver over the last week, and now Korver is trying to throw on the same recruiting pitch for another former Utah teammate, Ronnie Brewer. If the Orlando Magic match the offer sheet that the Bulls gave J.J. Redick, you can bet the Bulls will go hard after Brewer. “[Boozer] reached out to me and we talked about it for sure,” Korver said. “And I was texting Ronnie Brewer earlier, so we’re trying to start the Chicago Jazz here. I don’t know if you knew that.” The sense of humor popped up once again, before being deflected by the talk of his mindset over the last few days. “You definitely talk to different players,” he continued. “Me and Booz are good friends. I love playing with him. Obviously, he helps me out a lot in my game and I think I help him out a little bit too. We were definitely texting a lot in the last few days.”\n\nThere never will be a statue of Carlos Boozer in Salt Lake City. So it’s apparent the Utah coach has bigger concerns than the star forward bolting earlier this week to Chicago as a free agent. “Life goes on,” Sloan said in an interview with FanHouse on Friday at the Air Tran Orlando Pro Summer League. “We’ve got to coach whomever. It doesn’t make any difference. It happened before. We lost John Stockton and Karl Malone (after the 2002-03 season). We have to do our job, and coach the best that we can. You like your chances better with guys like (Boozer). But that’s part of life. You go about your business. “I’m not going to get emotionally involved. I loved coaching the guy and all that stuff. I have no control over (Boozer’s departure). I just give him my best wishes and that’s about it.”"
