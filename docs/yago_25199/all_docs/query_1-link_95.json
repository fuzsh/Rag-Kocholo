Read it, use it, read it again.” – William Germano\n\nPlenty of books tell you how to do research. This book helps you figure out WHAT to research in the first place, and why it matters.\n\nThe hardest part of research isn’t answering a question. It’s knowing what to do before you know what your question is. Where Research Begins tackles the two challenges every researcher faces with every new project: How do I find a compelling problem to investigate—one that truly matters to me, deeply and personally? How do I then design my research project so that the results will matter to anyone else?\n\nThis book will help you start your new research project the right way for you with a series of simple yet ingenious exercises. Written in a conversational style and packed with real-world examples, this easy-to-follow workbook offers an engaging guide to finding research inspiration within yourself, and in the broader world of ideas.\n\nRead this book if you (or your students):\n\nhave difficulty choosing a research topic\n\nknow your topic, but are unsure how to turn it into a research project\n\nfeel intimidated by or unqualified to do research\n\nworry that you’re asking the wrong questions about your research topic\n\nhave plenty of good ideas, but aren’t sure which one to commit to\n\nfeel like your research topic was imposed by someone else\n\nwant to learn new ways to think about how to do research.\n\nUnder the expert guidance of award-winning researchers Thomas S. Mullaney and Christopher Rea, you will find yourself on the path to a compelling and meaningful research project, one that matters to you—and the world.\n\nChinese Film Classics, 1922-1949\n\nBy Christopher Rea\n\nNew York: Columbia University Press, 2021. Publisher. Website. Amazon. Trailer. Online course. Subtitled films. Article.\n\n“These films represent for me not just the dawn of Chinese cinema, but also the visualization of my own cultural roots. They vividly established in my imagination the cinematic awakening of ancient China in a rapidly modernizing world. Rea’s sensitive reading of these films is a fascinating and insightful look into this unique cultural touchstone.” — Ang Lee\n\nChinese Film Classics, 1922–1949 is an essential guide to the first golden age of Chinese cinema. Offering detailed introductions to fourteen films, this study highlights the creative achievements of Chinese filmmakers in the decades leading up to 1949, when the Communists won the civil war and began nationalizing cultural industries.\n\nChristopher Rea reveals the uniqueness and complexity of Republican China’s cinematic masterworks, from the comedies and melodramas of the silent era to talkies and musicals of the 1930s and 1940s. Each chapter appraises the artistry of a single film, highlighting its outstanding formal elements, from cinematography to editing to sound design. Examples include the slapstick gags of Laborer’s Love (1922), Ruan Lingyu’s star turn in Goddess (1934), Zhou Xuan’s mesmerizing performance in Street Angels (1937), Eileen Chang’s urbane comedy of manners Long Live the Missus!(1947), the wartime epic Spring River Flows East (1947), and Fei Mu’s acclaimed work of cinematic lyricism, Spring in a Small Town (1948). Rea shares new insights and archival discoveries about famous films, while explaining their significance in relation to politics, society, and global cinema. Lavishly illustrated and featuring extensive guides to further viewings and readings, Chinese Film Classics, 1922–1949 offers an accessible tour of China’s early contributions to the cinematic arts.\n\nChina’s Chaplin: Comic Stories and Farces by Xu Zhuodai\n\nTranslated and with an introduction by Christopher Rea\n\nIthaca, NY: Cornell East Asia Series, 2019. Publisher. Amazon. Podcast.\n\nHoaxes! Jokes! Farces and fun! China’s Chaplin introduces the imagination of Xu Zhuodai (1880–1958), a comic dynamo who made Shanghai laugh through the tumultuous decades of the pre-Mao era. Xu was a popular and prolific literary humorist who styled himself variously as Master of the Broken Chamberpot Studio, Dr. Split-Crotch Pants, Dr. Hairy Li, and Old Man Soy Sauce. He was also an entrepreneur who founded gymnastics academies, theater troupes, film companies, magazines, and a home condiments business.\n\nChina’s Chaplin contains a selection of Xu’s best stories and stage plays (plus a smattering of jokes) that will answer the questions that keep you up at night. What is a father’s duty when he and his son are courting the same prostitute? What ingenious method might save the world from economic crisis after a world war? Who is Shanghai’s most outrageous grandmother? What is the best revenge against plagiarists, thieves, landlords, or spouses? And why should you never, never, never pull a hair from a horse’s tail?\n\nDa bujing de niandai: Jindai Zhongguo xin xiaoshi (The Age of Irreverence: A New History of Laughter in China).

Publisher. Amazon. Q&A. MCLC review.\n\nWen Yuan-ning (1900-1984) was both an insider and an outsider on the politics of celebrity in modern China. Born into a Hakka family in the Dutch East Indies, he studied law at Cambridge University before moving to China to embark on a remarkably varied career. He taught English literature at China’s top universities, including Peking and Tsinghua, contributed to leading English-language periodicals such as The China Critic and T’ien Hsia Monthly, served in China’s legislature in Nanking, worked as a wartime propagandist in Hong Kong, and eventually was appointed as China’s ambassador to Greece.\n\nDuring the heady days of Anglophone publishing in 1930s China, Wen Yuan-ning edited for the Critic a series of “Unedited Biographies” (later “Intimate Portraits”) of famous contemporary Chinese personages. Wen and his collaborators—some of whom wrote anonymously—offered readers mischievous and idiosyncratic accounts of the careers and personalities of the people in the news. These celebrity sketches proved both controversial and popular, with several of them immediately being translated into Chinese. A selection of seventeen of Wen’s own contributions to the Critic series was published to acclaim in 1935 as the book Imperfect Understanding. Yet Wen and his contributions to Chinese literary culture disappeared from the historical record after the founding of the People’s Republic, likely because Wen wrote in English and had close ties to the Chinese Nationalist Party.\n\nImperfect Understanding is both an entertaining work of literature, by turns comedic and touching, and an important historical document. Its fifty sketches represent influential Chinese historical figures warts and all, in the eyes of contemporary observers seeking to provide readers an alternative to the autobiographical puffery of popular books like Who’s Who in China. Christopher Rea’s introduction offers new research on the forgotten literary figure Wen Yuan-ning and argues that one of the essays published under his name was written anonymously by a young man who went on to become one of modern China’s literary giants: Qian Zhongshu. This edition of Imperfect Understanding also includes multiple reviews of Wen’s book, brief biographies of the subjects of the Critic series, and a bibliography of further writings by and on Wen Yuan-ning.\n\nThe Book of Swindles: Selections from a Late Ming Collection.\n\nBy Zhang Yingyu (fl. 1600s), translated by Christopher Rea and Bruce Rusk.\n\nNew York, NY: Columbia University Press, 2017. Publisher. Amazon. Ming dynasty edition. Sample story 1. Sample story 2. Q&A. Review 1. MCLC Review. Sinica Podcast interview. Audio interview. Video introduction.\n\n“What’s the oldest scam in the book? Nobody knows, but at least we have the oldest book about scams in China. It’s called The Book of Swindles, and finally, after four hundred years, Rea and Rusk have presented us with a vivid and entertaining new translation of this classic. Even the chapter titles—’Eating Human Fetuses to Fake Fasting’; ‘Swindling the Salt Commissioner While Disguised as Daoists’—are as priceless as anything else produced during the Ming dynasty.” — Peter Hessler\n\nThis is an age of deception. Con men ply the roadways. Bogus alchemists pretend to turn one piece of silver into three. Devious nuns entice young women into adultery. Sorcerers use charmed talismans for mind control and murder. A pair of dubious monks extorts money from a powerful official and then spends it on whoring. A rich student tries to bribe the chief examiner, only to hand his money to an imposter. A eunuch kidnaps boys and consumes their “essence” in an attempt to regrow his penis. These are just a few of the entertaining and surprising tales to be found in this seventeenth-century work, said to be the earliest Chinese collection of swindle stories.\n\nThe Book of Swindles, compiled by an obscure writer from southern China, presents a fascinating tableau of criminal ingenuity. The flourishing economy of the late Ming period created overnight fortunes for merchants—and gave rise to a host of smooth operators, charlatans, forgers, and imposters seeking to siphon off some of the new wealth. The Book of Swindles, which was ostensibly written as a manual for self-protection in this shifting and unstable world, also offers an expert guide to the art of deception. Each story comes with commentary by the author, Zhang Yingyu, who expounds a moral lesson while also speaking as a connoisseur of the swindle. This volume, which contains annotated translations of just over half of the eighty-odd stories in Zhang’s original collection, provides a wealth of detail on social life during the late Ming and offers words of warning for a world in peril.\n\nThe Age of Irreverence: A New History of Laughter in China.\n\nBy Christopher Rea\n\nOakland, CA: University of California Press, 2015. Publisher. Amazon. E-book. Kindle. Author Q&A. New York Times. Rorotoko. MCLC review. Video (6 min). Read excerpts here and here.\n\nWinner of the 2017 Joseph Levenson Book Prize (Post-1900 China), awarded by the Association for Asian Studies.\n\n“I am confident that it is the finest in its field to include a lyric by me.” — Eric Idle\n\nThe Age of Irreverence tells the story of why China’s entry into the modern age was not just traumatic, but uproarious. As the Qing dynasty slumped toward extinction, prominent writers compiled jokes into collections they called “histories of laughter.” In the first years of the Republic, novelists, essayists and illustrators alike used humorous allegories to make veiled critiques of the new government. But, again and again, political and cultural discussion erupted into invective, as critics gleefully jeered and derided rivals in public. Farceurs drew followings in the popular press, promoting a culture of practical joking and buffoonery. Eventually, these various expressions of hilarity proved so offensive to high-brow writers that they launched a concerted campaign to transform the tone of public discourse, hoping to displace the old forms of mirth with a new one they called youmo (humor).\n\nChristopher Rea argues that this period—from the 1890s to the 1930s—transformed how Chinese people thought and talked about what is funny. Focusing on five cultural expressions of laughter—jokes, play, mockery, farce, and humor—he reveals the textures of comedy that were a part of everyday life during modern China’s first “age of irreverence.” This new history of laughter not only offers an unprecedented and up-close look at a neglected facet of Chinese cultural modernity, but also reveals its lasting legacy in the Chinese language of the comic today and its implications for our understanding of humor as a part of human culture.\n\nHere’s a brief video interview about the book with ChinaFile.\n\nA few bonus visuals appear in this discussion (part 1 of 3) of Chinese laughter between me and Henry Jenkins.

Sample chapter (PDF). Google Books preview (HTML).\n\nFrom the late nineteenth- to the mid-twentieth century, changes in mass media, transportation, and communication technologies provided unprecedented opportunities for the entrepreneurially-minded in China and Southeast Asia.\n\nThe Business of Culture examines the rise of these “cultural entrepreneurs,” Chinese business people who risked financial well-being and reputation by investing in multiple enterprises to build cultural, social, or financial capital. Featuring ten interlinked case studies, this volume introduces readers to three distinct archetypes who emerged during this time: the cultural personality, the tycoon, and collective enterprise. These include the likes of Lü Bicheng, a famous classical poet, who parlayed her literary prestige into a career as the principal of a Beijing girls’ school and then used her business fortune to build a high-profile persona as a glamorous foreign correspondent; Aw Boon Haw, the “tiger” behind the Tiger Brand pharmaceutical company; and the Shaw Brothers, ethnic Chinese filmmakers and exhibitors who drew thousands of people out each night to watch movies in Singapore and British Malaya. Collectively, these portraits reveal how changes in social and economic conditions created the fertile soil for business success–conditions similar to those emerging in China today.\n\nTeaching\n\nResearch\n\nCURRENT PROJECTS\n\nChina on the Make: Stories of Chinese Deception.
