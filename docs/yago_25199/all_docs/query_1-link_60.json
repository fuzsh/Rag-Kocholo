        "text": "Qian, like many of the others, immersed himself in the traditions of Western literature and travelled abroad, studying in Oxford and the Sorbonne. His death has been little marked in the English-speaking world but French President Jacques Chirac wrote in a message to his widow, Yang Jiang, that he was 'the embodiment of the finest features of the Chinese nation: intelligence, elegance, kindness, openness and modesty'.\n\nEven President Jiang Zemin called Ms Yang at their home, a few weeks before Qian's death, to express the concern of the Communist Party for his well-being.\n\nThe Chinese press has been full of articles describing the couple whose odyssey through life is as fascinating as their contributions to Chinese literature. After all Qian went from being a pupil of Sir Reginald Johnson, the last emperor's English tutor, to polishing Mao's poems.\n\nDespite publishing just one major work of fiction, Fortress Besieged ('Wei Cheng'), Qian is nevertheless hailed as perhaps China's greatest 20th-century scholar and writer.\n\nFortress Besieged is a wry and humorous look at married life among the Chinese intellectuals who fled the Japanese invasion to Chongqing but, like almost everyone else in his generation, he never wrote another novel after 1949. The novel, his short stories and essays became unavailable inside China until 1979 but in the early 1990s, the novel was dramatised in a successful television series. Recently, an academic field solely devoted to 'Qian studies' has even sprung up.\n\nMuch of his life post-1949 was devoted to researching an obscure work of scholarship in five volumes, Guan Zhui Bian, which attempts to reveal the common ground between Western and Chinese cultures. It ranges through China's literary heritage and is studded with quotations from classical Chinese as well as from works in ancient Greek, Latin, medieval and modern European writings.\n\nHis widow's works are as well known. Apart from being the translator of Spanish classics such as Don Quixote and Gil Blas, Ms Yang has written books describing and mocking their life in Mao's time. One of them, Bath, describes thought reform in the 1950s, while A Cadre School Life: Six Chapters ('Gan Xiao Liu Ji'), describes what happened when they were sent down to the countryside to learn from the peasants. It is modelled on an 18th-century classic by Shen Fu - Six Chapters Of A Floating Life - who chronicles the married life of a merchant and translated into English.\n\nWhen not in the so-called May 7 Cadre School situated in poverty-stricken Henan, they spent many years living and working in a single room. Li Shenzhi, a former deputy director of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) where they worked and who knew Qian over 60 years, described it as a unique marriage.\n\n'They spoke to each other in English, French and other languages to keep their spirits alive,' he recalled.\n\nQian had a photographic memory and largely relied on this to draw his extensive references to the whole breadth of Western literature, despite the fact that his own books were burned.\n\n'Just the footnotes for Guan Zhui Bian, cover pages in Latin, English, French, Spanish. He quoted from over 2,000 Western classics,' marvels Mr Li.\n\nA fellow professor at the Literature Research Institute, He Xilai, remembers what he did even after digging wells and mucking out pigs at the cadre school: 'He took a big English dictionary and in his spare time he memorised it so he could recite the whole dictionary off by heart.' At the institute, Red Guards had pasted up posters condemning Qian for being an anti-Mao element, but he escaped becoming a key target. Those beaten in struggle sessions were the institute director and poet, He Qifang, and Yu Pingbo, an expert on the classic novel, Dream Of The Red Chamber. However, Qian's son-in-law, another scholar, was also persecuted and committed suicide.\n\nSomehow, even in a period when the Communist Party set out to destroy the foundations of traditional Chinese learning while persecuting all those with foreign connections, Qian devoted himself to research that had no chance of being published.\n\n'He was a cosmopolitan person so this was a kind of passive protest,' Li Shenzhi believes. 'And perhaps it was deliberately written in classical Chinese so most cadres could not understand it.' Although Mr Li describes himself as a communist, he admires Qian for never succumbing to the party's thought control. 'That is what makes him so outstanding. There were only two other people in the whole country who managed that,' he said, referring to the scholar Chen Yinke who showed his loyalty to the Qing dynasty by continuing to wear his hair in a queue, and Qian's wife.\n\nQian assessed his own actions more critically. In the foreword to A Cadre School, he says it lacks a chapter on remorse. 'For it was people like me who, although aware of the injustices being perpetrated on those around us, were too cowardly to take a stand and speak out against what was happening. Our only boldness was a lack of enthusiasm for the endless movements and struggles in which we participated,' he wrote.\n\nAccording to Zhang Longxi, visiting Professor of Literature and Translation at the City University of Hong Kong, Qian later took comfort from the fact that he abstained from taking part in the struggle sessions against Yu Pingbo, although he did not agree with his views.\n\n'He always tried to avoid all political confrontations,' Professor He said.\n\nAt the same time he allowed himself to be used by the party. In 1979 Qian was appointed deputy director of the CASS and lived in a residential compound near the Diaoyutai reserved for top ranking officials, thanks to his patron Hu Qiaomu. This hard-line Maoist had just been appointed head of the CASS and needed to give the newly restored organisation some credibility.\n\n'He wanted Qian to add some honour to the new CASS, but Qian insisted he had neither an office nor a secretary. In fact, he seldom went to CASS and contributed no work,' recalled Li Shenzhi.\n\nThe couple rarely went out and declined numerous opportunities to leave the country. Ms Yang went on brief trips to England and Spain while her husband travelled to America and Italy, but they refused all offers of comfortable academic posts.\n\n'They were perhaps the only real hermits in China,' Mr Li said. 'Senior leaders went to see him, but he never went to see them. This is the mark of a traditional Chinese scholar, that you never seek help from the powerful.' Speaking on the telephone, Ms Yang declined to be interviewed: 'I am ever so sorry. We never give interviews, especially to foreign journalists, that is always our rule.' Perhaps the most astonishing and mysterious aspect of their lives is simply how they survived at all in Mao's China. Despite an evident disgust for his regime, they were protected by Hu Qiaomu, a classmate of the Qians who even in the 1940s was busy helping Mao persecute and execute tens of thousands of intellectuals. During the 1942 Yanan rectification campaign, Hu took a leading role in the torture, imprisonment and execution of critical writer Wang Shiwei and many others.\n\nEven after he was appointed head of CASS in 1978 to help with the rehabilitation of intellectuals, Hu took a leading role in the 'anti-spiritual pollution campaign' and 'anti-bourgeois liberalisation campaign' when many intellectuals were hounded out for promoting 'Westernisation' and 'excessive individualism'.\n\nIt seems in the 1950s Hu, who by that time had been working for some years as Mao's ghostwriter, persuaded Qian to use his genius to translate and edit Mao's works.\n\nProfessor He Xilai claims Qian was really just a polisher.\n\n'Several English experts were invited to help and when there were debates on what words or expressions to use, Qian knew exactly how different dictionaries defined certain words. He knew which had been chosen before in Mao's works and could give the page and recite the sentence,' he said.\n\nBut Mr Li indicates Qian played a bigger role.\n\n'He translated Mao's works for four or five years. Qian felt disgusted to be called Mao's translator because he hated Mao's writings,' said Mr Li who also claimed that much of what Mao wrote, including some of his poems, were written by others.\n\n'Qian was sure Mao could never have written many of his poems and that some were composed by Hu Qiaomu,' he said. 'In his early days, Mao had his own ideas and did not depend on secretaries so much, but later on Mao was completely muddle-headed and talked only nonsense.' Although Qian struggled to maintain his self-esteem as the amanuensis to the great tyrant, none of his contemporaries kept their dignity. Some stopped writing altogether and others merely produced party propaganda.\n\nShen Congwen, author of lyrical works on life in Hunan province, became a clerk in the Forbidden City palace writing the history of Chinese costume. Even so, he was later tortured, and made to clean toilets off Tiananmen Square.\n\nLao She co-operated and, though he wrote his famous play Tea House after 1949, he wrote no more great works. He reportedly committed suicide during the Cultural Revolution by drowning in a Beijing lake.\n\nOthers like Ding Ling, Ba Jin, Mao Dun and He Qifang wrote little worth preserving and still suffered. Novelist Ding Ling spent 21 years in various camps. Ba Jin, who joined the communist cause in the 1930s, re-emerged in the 1980s calling on the party to set up Cultural Revolution museums modelled on Auschwitz.\n\nWhen Qian disappeared from view after 1949, his reputation was preserved by an American Professor T C Hsia at Columbia University who selected Qian, Shen Congwen and Chang Ailing as the three best novelists in 20th-century Chinese literature.\n\nBut had things turned out different, would Qian have contributed many more masterpieces? It is a question which still divides many from the generation educated before 1949. Retired Professor Xu Liangying, an expert on the philosophy of science and still a dissenting voice even in his 80s, has no doubts about this. 'It is quite simple. If there is no freedom of thought, you can't write,' he said. But Professor He, who is still a committed communist, does not agree. 'This was a necessity, an unavoidable policy of the party leadership,' he said."
