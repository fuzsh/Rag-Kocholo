        "text": "This article explores issues covered in Wuhan Diary, a dayby-day account by the Chinese author Fang Fang of her experiences during the height of the pandemic crisis in the city of Wuhan during the early months of 2020. It seeks to bring out what is distinctive and innovative about the text. Most notably, this concerns the mobilization of social media, such as Weibo and WeChat, as a basis for social communication and the dissemination of information within and beyond the city. The resultant text is not a diary in the conventional sense but, rather, a vast montage of diverse kinds of material that have been electronically cut up and pasted together. A particular focus of the discussion concerns ethical support and solidarity among citizens of Wuhan at this time of acute disruption. In this context, the article suggests a significant, and maybe surprising, affinity between Fang Fang's immediate concerns and issues raised in the ethical philosophies of Paul Ricoeur and Gabriel Marcel.\n\nThe International Workshop on Ming-Qing Studies, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan, July 21-22, 2016. Jin ping mei is known for its sophisticated and eclectic narrative style. It is one of the “four masterworks” of the Ming dynasty that is both indebted to Shuihu zhuan, in that the former’s narrative momentum centers on Wu Song, Ximen Qing and Pan Jinlian, but nonetheless demonstrates a clear departure from the Shuihu tradition. Yet, how should one account for the creative choice to simultaneously maintain continuity with Shuihu zhuan and also attempt a move of “discontinuity:” innovating a new narrative outside the Shuihu tradition? This issue may be better understood through a juxtaposed reading of Shuihu zhuan and Jin ping mei, by which one is positioned to appreciate one of the novelistic agendas of the latter: to redefine the concept of righteous loyalty (yi) and to reconstruct the image of the gallant fellow (haohan). This paper makes a few contentions. In Shuihu zhuan, the author valorizes the concept of righteous loyalty and the gallant fellow ideal, but in Jin ping mei, the author critiques them as lacking relevance and as impossibilities in a world dominated by the wealthy and powerful. In particular, the author of Shuihu zhuan depicts Wu Song as an authentic hero, whom is celebrated for his uninhibited expression of heroism. By contrast, the author of Jin ping mei attempts a reversal of Wu Song by re-presenting him, that is, reconfiguring Wu Song’s gallant attributes as symptomatic as a failed hero. The author draws attention to his anger, cunning, and obsession with vengeance as shortcomings to portray Wu Song as a character who may be important on the battlefield in Shuihu zhuan, but whose significance is challenged in the domestic world in Jin ping mei."
