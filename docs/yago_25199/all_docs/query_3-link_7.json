        "text": "--FILE--Chinese author and translator Yang Jiang, the wife of Qian Zhongshu, late Chinese literary scholar and writer, is pictured at an interview at her home in Beijing, China, 18 January 2012. State media say renowned Chinese writer Yang Jiang has died at age 104. The Paper, a state-owned news website, says Yang died Wednesday (25 May 2016) morning at Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beijing. It says her death was confirmed by her publisher, the People's Literature Publishing House. Hong Kong station Phoenix TV also confirmed Yang's death, the cause of which was not given. Born in 1911, Yang became a household name in China for her novels, plays, essays and translated works. In a 1981 collection of essays, she reflected on the daily lives of Chinese intellectuals during the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, when scholars and intellectuals were forced to perform hard labor. Yang's translation of \"Don Quixote\" is considered the definitive Chinese version by many."
