        "text": "Let's talk about the fact that marriage is the most important investment in life from a female perspective. Let's take a look at the views of Qian Zhongshu's wife Yang Jiang: Yang Jiang said: \"If you marry a poor person, you will be responsible for his ignorance, debt, disaster, all his harm, wrong ideas, and the stupidity, laziness, and chaos of his family. You are responsible for everything. What should you use to be responsible? Use your life, wealth, career, and the cost of your future to be responsible.\" What kind of man is worth marrying? \"There is no standard answer to this question, but one thing is certain: \"Don't marry a man who is too poor.\" Why? The life of the poor is full of endless hardships and challenges. Material poverty may destroy a person's dignity and self-esteem, while spiritual poverty can even exhaust several lifetimes of reincarnation. I once saw a letter from a mother to her daughter in the circle of friends. The letter said: \"Daughter, as your mother, I have always let you pursue what you want, give you freedom, and teach you to love yourself. But there are some things I must tell you. Last week, I met the boy you like very much. Although he has the same academic qualifications as you and looks gentle and refined. However, if I choose him as your marriage partner, I am not at ease, because: he is too \"poor\".\n\nIf he is only poor in money, there is still hope, but the bad thing is that he is also poor in spirit.\n\nMaybe, love is very happy and you can't see anything, but in the daily life, you will definitely suffer because of \"his poverty\".\n\nSeeing this, many people said that they can understand the mother's idea. After all, if you are not rich in material terms, you can start from scratch, but if you are poor in the following three aspects, it will be difficult to turn over in your life.\n\n1. A man with poor ability\n\nThe life that two people jointly run needs each other's strength as a solid backing. But when a man is stretched to the limit in terms of ability and can't take care of himself, how can he fight side by side with you and face the challenges of life together?\n\nWhat's worse is that such a man has limited ability, but he puts on a high-handed attitude at home and bosses women around.\n\nLiving with such a man means that you have to bear endless housework and endless grievances, and your life becomes a mess.\n\nIf you are always lacking in ability and make people see no hope, then such a man really needs to be reconsidered.\n\n2. Men with poor ambition\n\nNot only do they lack ambition, they will also use their negative energy to influence you and drag you down.\n\nYou can ignore the other person's family background, because ambitious men will not rely on their parents; you can also ignore the man's current economic situation, because success takes time.\n\nBut you must see clearly whether the other person has a positive and enterprising heart.\n\nIf the other person is poor and short-sighted, and muddles through, your future road is destined to be full of ups and downs if you are with such a person.\n\n3. Men with poor hearts\n\nMen with poor hearts are narrow-minded and like to be petty. Living with them for a long time, you will feel more and more tired.\n\nBecause you need to pay attention to your words and deeds at all times, so as not to \"offend\" them.\n\nThey also have no correct understanding of money. They only know to be \"stingy\" and unwilling to pay, and just want to squeeze value from others to satisfy their own selfish desires.\n\nIf they fail to get what they want, they will stand on their own standpoint and complain about everything around them.\n\nRemember! When choosing a partner, be sure to stay away from men who are \"poor in heart\".\n\nLife is full of trivialities. Find a man who is tolerant, knows how to share, and can handle things, and you will not have such a hard time for the rest of your life.\n\nMr. Yang Jiang said: \"Love is not about finding lost ribs, but about finding a resonance without any sense of disobedience. Only at the same frequency can love communicate and grow.\"\n\nA truly good marriage is a resonance of the soul and a fit in the three views.\n\nAnd people with poor three views will always be that when you tell him that the sea is beautiful, he will only say: \"The sea is beautiful.\"\n\nIf you are confused, you might as well read \"The Biography of Yang Jiang\". Mr. Yang Jiang said: \"The most torturous thing in marriage is not conflict, but boredom.\"\n\nAnd the only way to avoid boredom with each other is:\n\n\"Being with capable people,\n\nwill make your life full of expectations;\n\nBeing with people with rich hearts,\n\nEven if it is difficult, there is always light in your heart;\n\nWhen you are with people who have rich values,\n\nyou can live an ordinary life happily. ”\n\nZhang Ailing said: \"If you choose the wrong partner, every step you take in the rest of your life will be wrong.\"\n\nNo matter what age you are, no matter who you marry, you must learn to accumulate your own capital continuously, so that you have the confidence to be loved and abandoned."
