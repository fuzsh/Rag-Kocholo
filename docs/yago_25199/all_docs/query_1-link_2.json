        "text": "She once wrote: \"I married from a wealthy family to a poor family of money to be a\" daughter-in-law \". From the old customs and old manners, there was no sense of\" Marrying down \". Kowtow is nothing more than kneeling, etiquette, and bowing. If both men and women are concerned about such details, then it is not appropriate to inquire about each other's family situation as early as possible. During the Anti Japanese war in Shanghai, life was difficult. From the eldest lady to the old lady, for me, the role had changed. It was natural and I didn't feel aggrieved. Why, because of love, out of love for her husband. I love my husband more than myself. I understand the value of Qian Zhongshu. I would like to study and write for him the success of his ambition, and sacrifice myself to give full play to his potential and creativity. This kind of love is not blind, but understanding. The deeper understanding, the better feelings. Only when we understand each other can we consciously support each other. \"\n\nYang Jiang is kind and considerate in her marriage. Her role as wife is Qian Zhongshu's \"good wife\". When Yang Jiang was in Oxford, Qian Zhongshu made troubles at home from time to time. \"It doesn't matter\" if the desk lamp is broken, \"it doesn't matter\"; if the ink is dyed on the tablecloth, \"it doesn't matter\"; if the cheekbones are raw, \"it doesn't matter\"; after the event, they all solved the problem one by one. Yang Jiang's \"it doesn't matter\" accompanied Qian Zhongshu's life. \"Unique combination of the three incompatible: wife, lover, friend\", \"the most talented woman, the most virtuous wife\". This is Qian Zhongshu's \"gift speech\" to Yang Jiang, and the secret of their long-term happiness in marriage.\n\nNowadays, many people yearn for marriage, but they are afraid of marriage, because luck and misfortune happen between the two people who are bound. Marriage, in fact, is not terrible. It only needs to be fresh occasionally, not always warm, but also can bring happiness to the people who love in a lively way.\n\nThe marriage between Qian Zhongshu and Yang Jiang is the same. Qian Zhongshu often plays tricks on Yang Jiang like a child. Yang Jiang is not upset. Instead, he laughs because of the occasional \"fun\". Once, Qian Zhongshu saw Yang Jiang sleeping soundly. She had a big hair for fun and was full of thick ink. She wanted to draw a colorful face for her. It's a pity that Yang Jiang sleeps spiritually. As soon as he writes, she wakes up. Unexpectedly, her face is more inky than rice paper. She washed it with clear water and washed it again. Her skin was washed as fast as paper, and the ink marks on it were not cleaned yet. From then on, Zhongshu stopped making faces for Yang Jiang, only painted her portrait on paper, and then added glasses and beard to the portrait. He giggled and chatted for fun.\n\nOnce upon a time, marriage was usually amusing with letters and strokes. Today, our marriage can have more lively ways to choose, such as holding hands and taking a boat, to enjoy the island and the sea on kulangsu. Sitting in the cabin, driving from one side of the sea to the other side, the sun is shining, the sea is sparkling, hand in hand, stepping on the island, under the coconut forest, cool wind, walking along the sea, active in the blue sky, warmth is replaced by romance, this is a time to know each other in marriage.\n\nGo to kulangsu Shell Museum to see the displayed shells, which are the appearance of quiet time; go inside, go into the cave's adventure world, the magic star on the cave rock, all kinds of beautiful celestial phenomena; tilt the cabin, experience the sea floor dizziness and shaking; the swaying Mermaid, is also true or false... Here, the lively appearance can be naturally played, lively and interesting is the Shell Museum One of the labels of the museum is also a way of existence in marriage."
