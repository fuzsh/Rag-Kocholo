        "text": "There's a line in 《Pride and Prejudice》:\n\n\"A marriage that only thinks about money is absurd. A marriage that doesn't think about money is stupid.\"\n\nReal marriage, can not be separated from the spiritual support of mutual trust, more can not be separated from the material basis of fuel, rice, oil and salt.\n\nMoney is the most indispensable thing in marriage, dare not talk about money marriage is difficult to be happy for a long time.\n\nA good marriage is about talking about money and spending it.\n\nGood marriage, is dare to spend the husband's money.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~①~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSome people say: \"Married to a rich family to talk about money, married to no money family to talk about money.\"\n\nThat's what marriage is all about.\n\nFang Qingzhuo, a famous performing artist, was devoted to her acting career when she was young, but she didn't talk much to her husband about making money and spending money.\n\nAfter marriage, Fang Qingzhuo's career has not been on the right track, not only can't earn money, even often \"post money\", and the life of fuel, rice, oil and salt and everywhere need money, husband and wife two people because of money always quarrel.\n\nAt one point, the husband blew up:\n\n\"If you don't make money and still spend it, you can't live on. Let's get a divorce!\"\n\nHer marriage ended after only six months because of disagreements about money.\n\nDon't talk about money marriage, often because of the lack of enough trust, and eventually to break up.\n\nOn the contrary, talking about money properly doesn't hurt your relationship. It can actually lubricate it.\n\nWhen my aunt first got married, she was too shy to talk about money with her husband, so much so that most of the family expenses were spent out of her own money, and my brother-in-law, who is naive and simple, never noticed this.\n\nLong time, money is short, and it is difficult to talk to her husband, so anxious that she almost cried.\n\nFinally, one day, she gathered her courage. At the table and uncle said the cost of living.\n\nLet her not expect, uncle is very generous promise, after every month will take out half of the salary as home spending, the rest of the money as entertainment expenditure.\n\nThis commitment has been maintained to this day. My aunt and uncle have been happily married.\n\nI have heard a saying: \"A good marriage is never a single choice, neither without love, nor without money.\"\n\nHappy marriage, will put money on the table, open talk.\n\nAnd unhappy marriage, usually to money is silent, emergency is contradictory.\n\nWilling to talk about money, is truly delivered life; If you know how to talk about money, you'll make your marriage work better.\n\nOnly talk about money marriage, is a transaction; And don't talk about money marriage, is a kind of casual.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~②~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHost Tu Lei said:\n\n\"Money is not the only test of true love, but it can measure the depth of affection.\"\n\nA woman's greatest trust in marriage is to dare to spend her husband's money.\n\nThe love story between Qian Zhongshu and Yang Jiang is still talked about.\n\nThey urge each other in their career, and separate you from me in life.\n\nAt the end of 1979, Qian Zhongshu's \"Guantaper Compilation\" was published, and he received a large sum of money for it.\n\nTake a count, fully 8000 yuan! It's a huge sum of money, no doubt. It's a big surprise.\n\nWhen Qian received the money, he was so happy that he did something unexpected.\n\nHe found two bags, divided the money in half, put it in his pocket, and was about to take Yang Jiang to the mall.\n\n\"Come on, come on, let's be rich again!\" Qian Zhongshu, 69, is as happy as a child.\n\nHe wanted to spend the money he earned on his beloved wife.\n\nYang Jiang didn't even bother to follow him to the mall.\n\nQian Zhongshu has absolute trust in his wife and is never stingy, while Yang Jiang is also comfortable spending her husband's money.\n\nOne is willing to give, the other dare to spend, money has become the best way to show their love.\n\nThere is a joke on the Internet that reads as meaningful: \"Why does a wife use her husband's money?\"\n\nThe answer is: the word \"husband\" upside down is \"¥\", the husband in turn is read\" pay the bill \".\n\nThis suggests that the husband's money is as much a part of the marriage as the wife's contribution to the family.\n\nBetween husband and wife, only the division of labor is different, there is no difference.\n\nDare not spend her husband's money, the heart must be full of unease, marriage may also have a skeptical attitude.\n\nDare to spend her husband's money, a woman must be full of inner security, this is the greatest trust in marriage.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~③~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe love story between Tu Youyou and her husband Li Tingzhao in the TV drama \"Merit\" is touching.\n\nThere is a scene, the husband Li Tingzhao to go to the cadre school to study, before leaving, he put an iron box into his wife's hands.\n\nThat box contained nothing but their only worldly possessions.\n\nHe only took 20 yuan as a reserve and left the rest to Tu.\n\nHe also gave his wife a detailed plan of where to spend the money.\n\nTu Youyou was deeply moved. She spent everything on herself and took care of her family.\n\nIn order to have a little more money for her family, she has to be careful with her budget.\n\nMen are willing to give money to their wives, women can be considerate of their husbands is not easy, such a marriage to ebb and flow, mutual support.\n\nIn 1906, Lu Ying, the daughter of Lu Jingxi, a great salt merchant in Yangzhou, married Zhang Wuling, who was at the helm of the Zhang family, one of the four major families in Hefei.\n\nHeard Lu Ying intelligent and capable, just married not long, Zhang Wuling will be assured bold financial power to her, family affairs are taken care of by her hand.\n\nIn the face of Zhang's wealth, Lu Ying, who has a tutor and self-cultivation, does not have a half point of greed.\n\nShe took on the responsibility of being the head of the household, keeping a careful record of the money coming in and the money going out, and keeping a tidy schedule of household chores.\n\nNot only did her husband Zhang Wuling admire her, but her elders also spoke highly of her. Even the servants of the Zhang family loved her.\n\nUnder Lu Ying's management, the Zhang family's business is getting better and better, and the couple's affection is becoming stronger and stronger.\n\n\"Happiness in marriage depends on your partner's attitude toward you,\" Zhang said.\n\nA man who is generous to his wife will not haggle over trifles.\n\nA woman who is not greedy for money has a big right and wrong in her chest.\n\nOnly a man who is not mean can be worthy of a woman who is not greedy. Only a man who is not mean can be worthy of a good marriage.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~④~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nGood marriage, half due to love, half due to reality.\n\nA couple's attitude toward money often reflects the true nature of the family.\n\nHow well you handle your money can make all the difference between a happy marriage and even whether it lasts.\n\nDare to talk to each other about money, is the feeling of certainty, is also a brave responsibility;\n\nDare to spend each other's money, is the inner confidence, but also the greatest trust in marriage.\n\nMen are not mean, women are not greedy, is the most beautiful appearance of marriage.\n\nLet us know in the comments section"
