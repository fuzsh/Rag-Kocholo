Wiz Khalifa (feat. Snoop Dogg & Ty Dolla $ign) - 'You And Your Friends' [Music Video]

Wiz Khalifa is all smiles in the newly premiered visual for his 'You And Your Friends' collaboration with Snoop Dogg and fellow Taylor Gang member Ty Dolla $ign. Produced by DJ Mustard, the feel good track is found as a bonus cut on Wiz' third major LP 'Blacc Hollywood' released last Summer.

Wiz does a good job of matching the vibe of the audio to 'You And Your Friends' with the music video. While at first it may appear the three-minute-and-seventeen second long clip was shot in front of a green screen, the end reveals the three artists held the video shoot on a beach. Of course it's not a complete Taylor Gang music video without weed smoke and Wiz along with Ty Dolla are spotted puffing joints throughout.

'Blacc Hollywood', which features Wiz Khalifa's 'We Dem Boyz' single, has earned the Pittsburgh artist a Grammy nomination for Best Rap album. If you haven't yet, be sure to show your support for the album on iTunes and watch the colorful visual for 'You And Your Friends' below.
