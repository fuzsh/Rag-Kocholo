Wiz Khalifa has teamed up with Mustard for his smooth new single, "Bammer." While there's no word yet on whether the track is taken from a full-length project or not, but puts their collaborative chemistry on full display regardless.

Over the horn-laden instrumental, Wiz sticks to what he knows best. The release of the single follows his seven track mixtape It's Only Weed Bro, which saw him freestyling over some classic rap instrumentals. Among the cuts he went over was Common's "The 6th Sense," JAY-Z and Memphis Bleek's "Dear Summer," and Mobb Deep's "Survival of the Fittest." He even went so far as to drop an official video for "Smokin' Section," which saw him rapping over the aforementioned Common track.

Recently, Wiz also provided the Take A Daytrip-produced Sonic the Hedgehog song "Speed Me Up," which also features Ty Dolla Sign and Lil Yachty.
