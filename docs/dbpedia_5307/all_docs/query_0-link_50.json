        "text": "Belly is gearing up to release his new album, Midnight Zone, and \"4 Days\" is the first step toward the 2018 project. The Canadian rapper delivered the hazy Millicent Hailes-directed video to his YG and DJ Mustard-assisted single on Monday (March 26).\n\nThe visual opens with the 33-year-old lighting up a blunt on set, donning a multi-colored fur jacket. The clip features multiple beautiful women surrounding Belly as he attacks the tune's catchy chorus. \"4 Days\" pays homage to the XO artist's breakthrough mixtape, Up For Days.\n\nDJ Mustard joins Belly onscreen to celebrate another potential banger to add to his already decorated resume. The visual then panels to YG riding around in the driver's seat of a convertible supplying all of the West Coast vibes.\n\nThe Compton native has a special message for the women in his life. \"I tell her she can fuck up my life/Just don't fuck up my cash flow,\" YG raps. \"Walk up in this bitch, Louis, Gucci, lil Prada/Went from none to somethin', been like tada.\"\n\nBelly has recently been spotted in the studio with his idol, Jay-Z, as he continues to finish up his sophomore LP. Belly detailed what it's like to work with Hov in a recent interview. \"I've been listening to him my whole life, but he's taught me how to approach things differently and to take my words more seriously when I rap,\" he explains. \"It's dope having him there and being involved with my album.\"\n\nCheck out the \"4 Days\" video below."
