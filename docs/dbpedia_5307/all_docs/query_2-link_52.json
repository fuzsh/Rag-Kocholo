        "text": "This past weekend, Apple Music gained further ground in the ongoing war for streaming music supremacy, debuting two different albums of new work from popular R&B artist Frank Ocean.\n\nThe first of these, a self-described visual album entitled Endless, dropped late Thursday and was swiftly followed on Saturday by the audio-only Blonde. Apart from a handful of pop-up stores where Blonde could be acquired alongside a one-off print magazine, the only legitimate way to consume these records was through Apple.\n\nThis marks but the latest in a string of notable releases to premiere first and foremost via the service, often but not always in tandem with a corresponding option to purchase via iTunes. Typically expanding to a wider digital release after a week or two, other 2016 projects to follow this model include Chance The Rapper's Coloring Book and Drake's multi-platinum Views. Not unlike these two successful Apple Music exclusives, Ocean's Blonde seems certain to make a major first week impression on the Billboard 200 album charts.\n\nOf course, paid streaming competitor Tidal is no stranger to the practice. The Jay-Z affiliated platform has been the first place for fans to hear some of 2016's most highly-anticipated albums, namely Beyoncé's Lemonade, Rihanna's Anti and Kanye West's The Life Of Pablo. In June, Tidal premiered the rap impresario's new track \"Spiritual\" and will almost certainly be where he ultimately releases his forthcoming follow-up to 2013’s Magna Carta Holy Grail, rumored to come out some time before the end of the year.\n\nIncreasingly, exclusive content--particularly in hip-hop and R&B--has become essential in luring paying subscribers to streaming music services like Apple Music and Tidal, a matter complicated by companies like Spotify and Pandora that offer free advertiser-supported subscription tiers in addition to their premium options. (Spotify last reported some 30 million paid users, compared to Apple Music's 15 million and Tidal's 4.2 million.) Yet apart from the rare new full-length project like Jhene Aiko and Big Sean collaborative TWENTY88 or Desiigner's New English mixtape, Tidal appears to be lagging behind Apple Music on the exclusive front.\n\nOver the summer, Apple Music has locked in a steady stream of weekly platform exclusives, including albums and mixtapes by established hip-hop artists like Wiz Khalifa and 2 Chainz as well as up-and-comers Lil Yachty and Madeintyo. The timing of these projects in-between the releases from Drake, Chance and Ocean potentially discourage hip-hop and R&B fans from letting free trials lapse or otherwise disrupting their paid access to material they'd have to wait to hear elsewhere.\n\nIndeed, the very definition of a platform exclusive has expanded in recent months to include advance album streams ahead of an announced release date. Case in point, Snoop Dogg's Coolaid and YG's Still Brazy both appeared on Apple Music two days prior to their respective wider releases. Notably, these pre-release plays count towards sales equivalents, thus factoring into the Recording Industry Association of America's determinations for gold and platinum awards.\n\nThe strategic decision to make Internet radio programming a key aspect of the product has helped as well. Through well-received programs like Drake's OVO Sound Radio and DJ Khaled's We The Best Radio on its Beats 1 station, Apple Music regularly features new music by some of the biggest names in hip-hop and R&B, as well as lesser known acts who benefit from such celebrity imprimaturs. Fresh out of prison, Gucci Mane unveiled his new single \"Back On Road\" this way. The shows have also served as first listen events for hotly tipped rap albums like Future's EVOL and Khaled's own Major Key, both of which topped the Billboard 200 in their respective opening weeks.\n\nWhile Tidal may not be matching Apple Music's pace, it certainly isn't staying dormant until its next big exclusive. The platform currently houses much of Prince and Neil Young's official discographies, and has turned Jay-Z 's debut album Reasonable Doubt and his The Blueprint trilogy into retroactive exclusives by removing them from competing streaming services. On the music video side, the platform currently hosts fresh ones from DJ Mustard, Maxwell, and T.I., as well as more expansive documentary style projects from others.\n\nBoth companies have partnered with select major label imprints, though the scope and details of these deals are largely lacking in transparency. In addition to premiering Drake's Views and last year's commercial mixtapes If You're Reading This It's Too Late and What A Time To Be Alive, Apple's business arrangement with his OVO Sound has made Apple Music the first place to hear the label's releases, including dvsn's Sept. 5th. At least to some extent, Tidal appears to have a similar relationship with Kanye West's G.O.O.D. Music, as evidenced by The Life Of Pablo rollout as well as the release of Desiigner's tape and the music video for his Billboard chart-topping hit \"Panda.\" The service has also debuted new music by G.O.O.D. Music's Pusha T.\n\nRegardless of any possible merger or purchase, Apple Music ultimately seems likely to prevail over Tidal and prove a true competitor to Spotify. A function of the company's broader remit, Apple currently possesses a notable competitive advantage over other paid streaming services. As a provider of consumer tech products, the integration of its streaming music service with iTunes, the iPhone and Apple TV makes for a convenient and consistent music experience. Spotify and Tidal lack that infrastructural support, depending entirely on third-parties including Apple to be functional and successful. Thus, the better the company does at improving said integration, the better their chances of leveraging brand loyalty for its relative newcomer in Apple Music.\n\nThis week, it's all about Frank Ocean--until the next round of platform exclusives arrives on Friday, of course."
