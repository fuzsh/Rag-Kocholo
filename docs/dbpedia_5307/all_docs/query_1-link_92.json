        "text": "Exclusive in-depth interview with producer DJ Mustard. In part 3 Mustard talks to Nick Huff Barili about how he created “Show Me” for Kid Ink featuring Chris Brown, breaking down each element that went into the beat while at the legendary Encore Recording Studios where he records at. DJ Mustard reveals his forthcoming single will feature Ty Dolla $ign and 2 Chainz, plus discusses connecting with Kendrick Lamar for the rapper’s new album.\n\nDJ Mustard is undeniably on top of his producer game right now, having multiple hits on the Top 100 for various artists. His sound is definitely in demand, and for an in-depth interview with Hardknock TV the producer breaks down how he created one of his chart-topping hits, Kid Ink’s “Show Me” with Chris Brown. He also reveals the title and featured artists of his upcoming single, plus, he says he’ll be working on something with Kendrick Lamar for the Black Hippy rapper’s new album.\n\nMustard revealed the title of his forthcoming single, (which is not “Vato” with YG, Jeezy and Que that previously dropped),”It’s called “Down On Me” and it’s featuring Ty [Dolla $ign] and 2 Chainz. And that shit is a movie.” As for when we can expect the track, Mustard says, “Any day. Never know. I might just get crazy one day and just…you know what I’m saying, ain’t no preparation for this shit.”\n\nAs for working with Kendrick Lamar, Mustard says, “My dog, he just texted me the other day.” Will the two work together on K. Dot’s new album, which is reportedly due out in September? “Damn right. He wants me to yell on some shit. You know like I be doing some Fat Man Scoop shit.”\n\nWhile this is good news, we don’t know yet what the collaboration will sound like because the two haven’t locked down studio time. “I could not tell you. I do not know,” Mustard responds when asked what the collabo will sound like. “I don’t even know what the outcome of that is gonna be but its gonna be greatness…He told me he want me to pull up on him. So I’ma pull up, figure it out. It’s gonna be something hard.”\n\nStay tuned next week for part 4 of our conversation with DJ Mustard.Make sure to subscribe to www.youtube.com/hardknocktv for our latest videos, including more with DJ Mustard.
