After signing to independent record label Rostrum Records at a young age, Khalifa released his first mixtape Prince of the City: Welcome to Pistolvania, and his first studio album, Show and Prove (2006).[1] Following the release of Show and Prove, Warner Bros.

The latter became his first song to appear on a Billboard chart, peaking at number 20 on the US Hot Rap Songs.[1] Disagreements with Warner over the release of a purported major-label debut album led Khalifa to departed from the label, and release his second studio album Deal or No Deal in 2009 on Rostrum Records alone.[1]\n\nIn April 2010, Khalifa released a mixtape, Kush & Orange Juice, which acquired widespread attention after topping Google's Hot Search Trends list: this brought Khalifa to the attention of Atlantic Records, who promptly signed him.[1] Khalifa's first single for the label, \"Black and Yellow\", achieved significant commercial success in the United States, peaking at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 and also peaking in the top ten of both the Canadian and United Kingdom singles charts.[2][3][4] The song was later certified six-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for digital download shipments exceeding 6,000,000 copies.[5] The International Hit \"Black and Yellow\" appeared on Khalifa's first studio album for Atlantic (and third overall), Rolling Papers, which peaked at number two on the US Billboard 200 and was certified gold by the RIAA.[5] Three further singles from Rolling Papers, Billboard Singles \"Roll Up\", \"On My Level\" – a collaboration with fellow rapper Too Short – and \"No Sleep\" also charted in the United States.[2] In 2011, Khalifa recorded many collaborations with other artists that proved to be commercially successful, including \"5 O'Clock\" with T-Pain and Lily Allen, and \"Young, Wild & Free\" with Snoop Dogg. Both of these songs reached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100.[2]"
