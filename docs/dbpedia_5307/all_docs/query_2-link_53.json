        "text": "Faheem Rashad Najm (born September 30, 1985),[1] better known by his stage name T-Pain, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer . His debut album, Rappa Ternt Sanga, was released in 2005. In 2007, T-Pain released his second album Epiphany, which reached number one on the US Billboard 200 chart. His third album, Thr33 Ringz, was released in 2008. T-Pain has also released a string of hit singles, including \"I'm Sprung\", \"I'm 'n Luv (Wit a Stripper)\", \"Buy U a Drank (Shawty Snappin')\", \"Bartender\", \"Can't Believe It\", \"5 O'Clock\" and more. T-Pain has earned two Grammy Awards, alongside artists Kanye West and Jamie Foxx respectively.\n\nT-Pain is the founder of the record label imprint Nappy Boy Entertainment, established in 2005. Throughout his career as a singer, T-Pain is best known for using and popularizing the creative use of the Auto-Tune pitch correction effect, used with extreme parameter settings to create distinctive vocal sounds. From 2006 to 2010, T-Pain was featured on more than 50 chart topping singles, his most successful feature to date was on Flo Rida's debut single \"Low\", which has since been certified 6x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nEarly life[]\n\nNajm was born and raised in Tallahassee, Florida.[2] His stage name is short for \"Tallahassee Pain\", and was chosen because of the hardships he experienced while living there. Najm was brought up in a Muslim household, but he has expressed his lack of interest in the concept of religion.[3][4] At just three years old he got his first taste of the music business when a friend of the family, gospel jazz artist/producer Ben Tankard, allowed him to spend time and \"twist the knobs\" at his recording studio. At age ten, Najm turned his bedroom into a music studio, using a keyboard, a beat machine and a four-track recorder.[5][6]\n\nCareer[]\n\n2004–2006: Early career and Rappa Ternt Sanga[]\n\nT-Pain joined the rap group Nappy Headz in 2004 and later recorded \"I'm Fucked Up\", a cover version of Akon's single \"Locked Up\". Recording artist Akon heard the song and immediately signed T-Pain to Konvict Muzik, his label. After being discovered, T-Pain began singing instead of rapping. T-Pain subsequently recorded and released his debut album, Rappa Ternt Sanga, on December 6, 2005.[2] The album reached number thirty-three on the Billboard 200, and has since been certified Gold by the RIAA, for reaching sales of 500,000 units.\n\nThe album was preceded by the lead single, \"I'm Sprung\", which was released in August 2005 and reached number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and number nine on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The second single, \"I'm N Luv (Wit a Stripper)\", featuring Mike Jones, was released in December 2005 and reached number five on the Hot 100 and number ten on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The third and final single from the album, \"Studio Luv\", was released in October 2006 but failed to chart.\n\n2007–2008: Epiphany[]\n\nIn mid-2006, T-Pain began work on his second album, now with the Zomba Label Group as well as Konvict Muzik and Jive Records.

The third and final single from the album, \"Church\", was released in October 2007 but failed to chart in the United States.\n\nSpeaking in May 2007 to noted UK R&B writer Pete Lewis, of the award-winning Blues & Soul about his reason for naming his second album 'Epiphany', T-Pain stated: \"One of the two dictionary meanings of epiphany is 'a sudden moment of insight or revelation'. And to me the title 'Epiphany' signifies the moment I realized that, to make the best music I can, I needed to just go in the studio and be myself, and not concentrate so hard on following other people's formulas.\"[9]\n\nWhile promoting his second album, T-Pain made guest appearances on multiple songs by other artists. T-Pain was featured on \"I'm a Flirt\" (remix) by R.
