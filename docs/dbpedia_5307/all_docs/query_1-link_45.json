        "text": "The west coast has dominated the sound of rap and R&B in the last year and a half, largely due to two figures: DJ Mustard and his friend and occasional collaborator Ty Dolla $ign. Mustard makes the beats, and Ty Dolla, who performed at Irving Plaza in New York City on Sunday, Nov. 2, has the attitude. While Drake popularized remorse and introspection — think of the album cover for Take Care, which finds the rapper looking forlorn despite being surrounded by gold — Ty went in a different direction, embarking on a never-ending party full of ecstatic pleasure.\n\nThis has worked out well for the singer, who has appeared everywhere this year. He co-wrote Chris Brown‘s “Loyal,” one of the bigger hits of 2014. He’s hopped on tracks from Mila J, Wiz Khalifa and Stalley; he was tapped for the official remix of Dej Loaf‘s “Try Me;” he worked with Lupe Fiasco.\n\nTy Dolla $ign & DJ Mustard Hit Top 10 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nThis ubiquity doesn’t only stem from his love of a good time. Male R&B is populated by artists like Usher, Chris Brown and August Alsina — light, lithe singers. Ty possesses a thicker, more sinuous voice, with rough edges around a molten core. At a time when clean, gritless vocals are the norm in all forms of pop, Ty’s practically Teddy Pendergrass.\n\nOn top of his vocal gifts, Ty Dolla $ign’s production work is surprisingly wide-ranging — especially when compared to Mustard, who gets a lot of mileage out of one formula. Take Ty’s Beach House mixtape: you’ll find “Float,” a gauzy track that sounds like the mercurial English singer Jai Paul, and “Another One,” with a hard chug that evokes ’80s pop. The ballad “Infatuated” could compete in the top 40 if Taylor Swift‘s pal Max Martin got his hands on it, while “My Cabana” samples the ’90s funk group Mint Condition. That’s a lot of styles to cover in a short amount of time.\n\nTy Dolla $ign Doubles His Money With Two Hits & All-Star Friends\n\nThis could be a disadvantage in live performance, but it didn’t bother Ty Dolla $ign — at Irving Plaza, backed mainly by a DJ, he managed to cover all of this range with ease. He played songs off his most recent mixtape, Sign Language, and also went back to sing the hook from one of his very first hits, “Toot It And Boot It” (a track with the rapper YG). He performed a medley of sex songs (though really, all Ty songs are sex songs) that included “Ratchet In My Benz,” from the Beach House 2 tape. He brought out New York’s own Fabolous for a verse during “Type Of Shit I Hate.”\n\nTy didn’t need to trot out native New Yorkers — he looked like one already, dressed as a downtown rock star with aviators and the requisite leather jacket. For a couple songs, he picked up a bass and riffed funkily, just to show that he could. (Ty’s dad was in the ’70s funk band Lakeside, which is catnip for journalists.) A keyboardist played along on some of the tracks; when he wasn’t needed, he just danced and cheered along like everyone else. Even Ty became a cheerleader at times, plugging his friends on several occasions: DJ Mustard, Wiz Khalifa and YG.\n\nIt’s hard to think of a singer with radio hits who is more sexually explicit than Mr. Dolla $ign. His bedroom escapades sometimes appear more like math problems than physical encounters, as the singer catalogs an increasing number of one-night stands, often with multiple partners. At times on recording, the steady stream of dirty talk can start to blur tracks together. But in a live setting, Ty was a gripping singer, with no studio technology available to file the edges off his vocals. He added gruff barks and hoarse, full-chested shouts to his repertoire of croons and moans, helping him fill out songs and imbue them with more power."
