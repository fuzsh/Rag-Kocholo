        "text": "Los Angeles singer and producer Ty Dolla $ign scored a left-field local hit last year with “My Cabana”, a lightweight ode to women-- and the drugs they love-- that goofily pondered how many he could fit into his titular cabana. “My Cabana” and the accompanying mixtape Beach House made up for what they lacked in lyrical depth with dense, immersive production, which slowed EDM’s chunky synths and drops and the sinewy, hyperactive sonics of L.A.’s ratchet music scene down to screw music’s promethazine crawl, and that voice: a syrupy tenor that can contract into taut staccato sing-rap or spread out into drippy vocal runs at a moment’s notice. Ty Dolla $ign’s talents recently landed him a deal with Atlantic Records via Wiz Khalifa’s Taylor Gang imprint, and he celebrated the occasion this month with the release of Beach House 2. The sequel follows on the lead of the original, but where Beach House presented a summation of the artist’s varying talents, Beach House 2 feels like a dry run for the majors, weighted down by a glut of largely ineffectual guest raps, songs recycled from other artists’ mixtapes and remixes of songs that didn’t really need fixing.\n\nDolla $ign’s arrangements are lush and intriguing on songs like “I Bet”, which matches oceanic synths to subterranean bass in the verses before a wash of keys overtake the mix at every chorus. All of the outside producers he calls on follow his lead by striking a precarious balance between house music and Southern hip-hop, mostly to dazzling results. But his impish lyricism wages a continual warfare with the sweetness of the music, and it occasionally makes for rough listening. You can snicker at darts like “I took his main bitch away like King Koopa” on “Creez”, but you have to sneak past a minefield of “These hoes be playing games for nothing” and “These bitches ain’t shit” to get there. It gets ugly on “Bitches Ain’t Shit”, where Ty$ graces a spectral, druggy production with a yarn about stealing a guy’s girlfriend containing a bridge where he tells the girl “Your nigga laid up in the hospital, and you still think of me/ Man, I swear to God I’d kill your fucking ass if you did that shit to me”. It illuminates the extent to which the mawkish depravity of Ty’s songs feels like an end in itself. R&B knows no shortage of dirtbag auteurs, but where R. Kelly bedded paramours with searching lines like “It seems like you’re ready”, and the Weeknd’s creep tendencies are points of consternation for him, Ty Dolla $ign treats these situations like bloodless coups, full of boyfriends ripe for the beating and women who are play things rather than companions, whose fealty & attraction to him are a foregone conclusion.\n\nBeach House 2’s problems with writing aren’t confined to Ty$; its guests spots are a mixed bag. The contributions from Dolla $ign’s Cali rap cohorts rank among the best. Heart Break Gang’s Iamsu! turns in a capable performance on “Float” (off his own Kilt II), and YG and DJ Mustard inject much-needed levity into “Dolla $ign”, which cleverly flips the “All I see is dollar signs” from Rihanna’s “Pour It Up”. Joe Moses, co-star of Ty’s 2012 mixtape Whoop!, delivers the mixtape’s best verse on “Paranoid” (off DJ Mustard’s underrated Ketchup tape). By and large, though, the tracklist here is a rogue’s gallery of Atlantic Records signees, and many of them seem to appear out of label affiliation rather than genuine chemistry. Juicy J’s creepy uncle act meshes perfectly with “Ratchet in My Benz”, and Kevin Gates shines on “These Hoes” when you can hear him over the beat. But Wiz Khalifa and Drake mimic Kirko Bangz faceplant on two separate songs apiece, and Taylor Gang associate Chevy Woods is sluggish and forgettable on “Bitches Ain’t Shit”. Ty snagging Jeezy for the massive “My Cabana” remix only to have him flop by singing his verse is emblematic of Beach House 2’s frustrating misuse of star power.\n\nBeach House 2 is peppered with skeezy dirtbag narratives and cringeworthy guest raps that bring it down, but Ty Dolla $ign’s melodies and production are almost strong enough to wash them out of earshot. If you’re not picking over this thing for lyrics you might not catch some of this stuff for all the interlocking hooks and deft vocal runs, and there isn’t anything here more shocking than the offbeat sexual politics of Yeezus. What’s most off-putting about Beach House 2 is how ill-suited the dead-eyed resignation of Ty Dolla $ign’s approach is to the warmth of his voice. “I got another nigga bitch in my bed right now/ She got her legs all up in the air... right now”. Yawn. “These hoes ain’t shit, but I’ma fuck this bitch”. Stretch. Beach House 2 is gratingly drunk on its own bedroom swashbuckling, like an hour-long teenage locker room sex story set to painstakingly pretty music. Given the opportunity to tell a fascinating story, he instead opts to fixate on how cunning and virile he is to have gotten there in the first place. There’s satisfaction in the telling but not as much in the listening."
