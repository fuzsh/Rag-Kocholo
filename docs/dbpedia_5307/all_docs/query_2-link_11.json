        "text": "DJ Mustard completely owns popular rap and R&B in 2014. Both scenes (where they are separate, and where they bleed together) have long been defined by super-producers, but few—including Timbaland and the Neptunes, whose names can’t help be evoked in this conversation—have had runs as successful as Mustard’s, who has placed no less than 15 songs on various Billboard charts this year. That list includes some of the year’s most enduring songs—from Kid Ink’s “Show Me” to Tinashe’s “2 On”—but more to the point is Mustard’s total and overwhelming ubiquity. It's not uncommon this year to turn on the radio, hit \"play\" on a playlist, walk into a party or enter a store, and hear a succession of Mustard’s beats. His sound has become so attached to mainstream urban music that it’s almost impossible to decipher where DJ Mustard ends and contemporary rap and R&B begins.\n\nBut we should never confuse quantity for quality, and Mustard’s sound is too divisive for him to be hailed as a universal genius like some of his predecessors have been. The criticism of his beats is obvious even to his supporters: they are simple and repetitive, not just individually but when taken together, often just an easily digestible series of pulses and snaps. Recently, a video posted to Reddit that catalogs a series of Mustard-produced singles built around the incessant chant of “Hey!” generated a thousand-comment thread of skepticism if not derision. The criticism—that any idiot with a working brain and two hands could churn out these beats—is not lost on the man himself. “Everybody say it’s so easy to make my beats,” Mustard Tweeted a few days ago. “[Well] take a swing at it you should be rich [in] no time cause I am.” The tweet was punctuated by two emojis that are crying while laughing.\n\nYet Mustard is nothing if not an innovative producer. His innovations don’t have the creative breadth of Timbaland, no doubt, but they are innovations nonetheless, and they have helped sustain the top-level of an art form that has been floundering commercially for years. One thing Mustard doesn’t get enough credit for is solving the Rubik’s Cube that is black music in the EDM era. Prior to his rise, pairings of rap and R&B with dance music—from successful crossovers like Pitbull, Usher, and Chris Brown to mid-tier artists like Waka Flocka Flame and Just Blaze working the EDM festival circuit—were shotgun marriages borne less out of creative inspiration than survivalist instinct. These collaborations were mostly garish and sad, but Mustard found a way to bring house music (back) to rap and R&B by making it an outgrowth of his own bleepy, up-tempo beats. He did it first with Ty Dolla $ign’s “Paranoid”—which nicks the organ-like keyboard sound of many a ‘90s house song—and then with “Show Me” and Jeremih’s “Don’t Tell ‘Em”, both of which lift parts of actual ‘90s house songs. The latter two have been pop crossovers at a time when most black artists have found a ceiling over their heads, and they have positioned Mustard less as a rap strip-miner and more as a sort of spiritual heir of Afrika Bambaataa and “Planet Rock”.\n\nBut most importantly, Mustard has given rap and R&B music a center. The genesis of his sound is in Atlanta club music spanning Lil Jon to Travis Porter and parts of multiple generations of West Coast rap from Dr. Dre to Too $hort to Keak Da Sneak, so naturally, many of Mustard’s early songs acted as a bridge for the contemporary rap scenes in the South and West. But as his popularity has grown, his net has widened: not just from rap to R&B, but also from artists in Atlanta and Los Angeles to others in the Midwest (Jeremih) and East Coast (French Montana, Wiz Khalifa). Whereas producers du jour of recent vintage such as Lex Luger and Mike Will elevated a certain region’s artists over others, the simplicity of Mustard’s beats has proven to be malleable for artists with different approaches and fanbases. Though many are still suspicious of his sound, Mustard is a uniter instead of a divider.\n\nDespite all of that, it’s impossible to forget that DJ Mustard comes from Los Angeles. His music pulls from many places but its heart is L.A. and that blood pumps through its veins. You can hear it in the squelching, rubbery bass on tracks like “Show Me”, YG’s “My Nigga”, and his own “Vato”, but also in the sneering swagger adopted by many of the rappers who slide onto his beats. That Mustard is L.A. and L.A. is Mustard seems to be the motive behind 10 Summers, his first album under his own name. Though the title makes a grand claim—that Mustard will be rap’s overlord for 10 straight summers—the album itself is a small, almost humble gesture toward his hometown, a sort of epilogue to My Krazy Life, the YG album produced largely by Mustard that instantly entered the conversation of classic L.A. rap full-lengths.\n\nMustard seems to have let his poppier, dancier side dominate his productions as of late, but 10 Summers pulls his sound all the way back to the beginning, with a set of tracks that explicitly connects him to the everlasting influence of Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg’s G-funk. It opens with a trio of songs that are reverent and distinctive only in the context of contemporary rap, but Mustard and the local rappers that lead off the album—from bigger names like Nipsey Hussle and Dom Kennedy to lesser-known entities like TeeCee and RJ—are skilled and able imitators. The whiny synthesizers and quaking bass of these opening tracks is Mustard’s sound at its most elemental and it sets the table for rapping that often amounts to very good impersonations of Snoop Dogg (the hook on “Low Low”) and Too $hort (the opening verse of “Ghetto Tales”). Though some might have wanted Mustard to piece together a star-studded album, he opens 10 Summers with an argument a certain type of chef might make: that doing the classics really well can be more satisfying than constantly trying to reinvent the wheel.\n\nIn fact, it’s when all the big names show up that the album drags a bit. “No Reason”, with YG and Jeezy, is a fun little Frankenstein of “Who Do You Love” and “My Nigga”, but what follows are a pair of tracks with big names that have the stale air of DJ Khaled’s bloated projects. “Giuseppe” is just about the most average Mustard song that either 2 Chainz or Jeezy—both frequent collaborators—have ever appeared on. And “Face Down”—the big ticket item featuring Lil Wayne, Big Sean, YG, and Lil Boosie—is a poorly mastered mess that is far less than the sum of its parts. After the delightfully slinky “Down on Me”—in which Mustard draws another line, this time to New Orleans bounce music—the album dips to its lowest point with the annoyingly squeaky Iamsu! vehicle “Can’t Tell Me”.\n\n10 Summers closes with four R&B tracks—two songs and two interludes, all of which act almost as palette cleansers after the unrelenting hardness of the previous eight numbers. The two full tracks—“4 Digits”, a showcase for up-and-coming vocalist Eric Bellinger, and “Deep”, a radio-ready single if Mustard wants to push it—go down like cold beers on a hot day, memorable for their understated perfection. But more tantalizing are the interludes (which are hopefully previews of full tracks), one from Tinashe and the other from Ty Dolla $ign. They clock in at barely over a minute in total but are deeply tuneful, and they suggest that Mustard has digested the same funk and soul records that inspired a L.A. luminary like DJ Quik and that he’s more versatile than people want to believe.\n\nBoth interludes are also presented as random radio dispatches, and on the Tinashe interlude Mustard makes another reference to criticism of his omnipresence. It opens with a short skit in which a man and a woman switch on the radio only to hear a string of Mustard tracks. “I’m tired of this shit,” the man says to the woman as “Paranoid” plays in the background. She flips the dial and we hear T-Pain’s “Up Down (Do This All Day)\", to which he responds, “Hell nah, bitch, I’m tired of this nigga.” She turns the dial once more and we hear the new Tinashe track. It’s a fair warning."
