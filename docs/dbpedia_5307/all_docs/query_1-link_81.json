The Los Angeles-born native has coined the “ratchet” sound, bringing a hot, new and different sound to hip-hop. In just three years, Mustard constructed a registry of hits for the likes of Tyga (“Rack City”), 2 Chainz (“I’m Different”), Young Jeezy (“R.I.P.”), Kid Ink (“Show Me”), Y.G. (“My Hitta”), and nabbed collaborations with Fergie, Jennifer Lopez, Wiz Khalifa Trey Songz, and more. Mustard executive produced YG’s debut album “My Krazy Life” which peaked #2 on Billboard 200, #1 R&B/Hip-Hop, & #1 Rap charts. In 2014, DJ Mustard took over the airwaves with a peak of seven songs hitting the Billboard Hot 100 chart at the same time. DJ Mustard also released his debut album, 10 Summers, which was the most downloaded album during the summer of 2014 on Google Play. 10 Summers is available now at all digital retailers worldwide.\n\nShare"
