        "text": "While rap typically thrives on the new — new artists, new styles and new crews — the nominees in the Rap Field this year include a bevy of veteran artists being recognized for making some of the best music of their careers. Jay-Z and Kanye West are in the running in several categories, as well as the prolific Lil Wayne, while a troop of new voices also made the cut, including Nicki Minaj, who is also up for Best New Artist, and prolific Pittsburgh rapper Wiz Khalifa, who topped the Billboard Hot 100 with his nominated \"Black And Yellow.\"\n\nBest Rap Performance\n\nRap's diversity is recognized in this all-encompassing category. Multiple GRAMMY winners Jay-Z and Kanye West are nominated for the propulsive \"Otis\" and the blockbuster rap/R&B trio featuring Chris Brown, Lil Wayne and Busta Rhymes are up for the sonically adventurous \"Look At Me Now.\" GRAMMY newcomer Wiz Khalifa trumpets his hometown on the anthemic \"Black And Yellow\"; Nicki Minaj and Drake's \"Moment 4 Life\" encourages listeners to make the most out of their lives; and the politically minded Lupe Fiasco makes a strong case for perseverance with \"The Show Goes On.\"\n\nBest Rap/Sung Collaboration\n\nFemals make their mark in this category. Sixteen-time GRAMMY winner Beyoncé teams with OutKast's imaginative André 3000 for the celebratory \"Party.\" Beyoncé's former Destiny's Child cohort Kelly Rowland teams with the omnipresent Lil Wayne for the sensual \"Motivation,\" while Rihanna and Fergie help West and Kid Cudi navigate the frustration of a failed relationship in \"All Of The Lights.\" Rihanna makes her second appearance in the category with the suggestive \"What's My Name?\" with Drake. Changing the focus from male-female relationships to internal struggle, GRAMMY winner Dr. Dre teams with Eminem and Skylar Grey for the reflective \"I Need A Doctor.\" Rounding out the category is the boast-heavy \"I'm On One\" by DJ Khaled, Drake, Rick Ross, and Lil Wayne.\n\nBest Rap Song\n\nWordplay and sonic excellence are showcased in this category, which celebrates songwriters. There's the joy of flaunting your accomplishments on \"Otis,\" written by rap's power duo Jay-Z and West, and the satisfaction that comes with realizing your own innate power on \"Look At Me Now,\" written by Jean Baptiste, Chris Brown, Ryan Buendia, Lil Wayne, Trevor Smith, Wesley Pentz, and Nick Van De Wall. The mental struggle required to overcome adversity is exhibited on \"I Need A Doctor,\" written by Alex Da Kid, Dr. Dre, Eminem, and Grey, while enjoying your success is the message in \"Black And Yellow,\" written by Mikkel S. Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen and Wiz Khalifa. The agony that comes when love is lost is the focus of \"All Of The Lights,\" written by Jeff Bhasker, Fergie, Malik Jones, Warren Trotter, and West. Each of these songs earned a nomination in other rap categories, a testament to each song's power.\n\nBest Rap Album\n\nA year after Eminem's win in this category for Recovery, a mix of established artists and newcomers will be vying for the trophy. Titans Jay-Z and West teamed for the landmark collaborative album Watch The Throne, which is competing against West's solo album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Minaj earned her first nomination in this category for her debut album Pink Friday. Repeat nominees Lupe Fiasco and Lil Wayne are in the running again for Lasers and Tha Carter IV, respectively. All of the releases nominated for Best Rap Album this year peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.\n\nWho will take home the awards in the Rap Field? Tune in to the 54th Annual GRAMMY Awards on Feb. 12, taking place at Staples Center in Los Angeles and airing live on CBS from 8–11:30 p.m. (ET/PT).\n\nFollow GRAMMY.com for our inside look at GRAMMY news, blogs, photos, videos, and of course nominees.

Since then, African artists have gained global recognition. Do you see yourself as a pioneer for the current Afropop movement?\n\nI agree with you 100 percent, there is no way you authentically go through the history of, you know, building a bridge between Africa and the rest of the world via music without mentioning a song like \"Johnny.\" It's definitely an honor for me to be the vessel that delivers such amazing music to the world. Of course, there were people way before me who also did the same thing. We're talking about Fela [Kuti]. We're talking about King Sunny Ade. At the end of the day, yes, music is metamorphosing into so much more. And definitely, I'm a pioneer [laughs].\n\nYou have a strong sense of storytelling, especially in your music videos. \"Johnny\" has an entire storyline about a news reporter investigating a womanizer. How important is that kind of storytelling to your music?\n\nStorytelling is a big part of my artistry, because I feel everybody loves a good story. I find that even when I'm writing most times in the studio, there's always a picture I'm trying to paint, and it only makes sense for the visuals to kind of match that most of the time. Except sometimes we decide to make it a performance video because I just feel like dancing.\n\nWhat’s the most memorable video you’ve ever done?\n\nEvery one of my videos has taken a lot of pain, sweat, and even some tears. But I think \"Johnny\" is such a masterpiece, because it resonated with the entire world, and Africa especially. And it pretty much helped me to stay on my way through the industry, because it became my identity. That song and that video was the platform for the brand and everything that I am today. you know, so that is definitely the most memorable, in a good way.\n\nYou've traveled to and performed in America several times in your career. What's your overall impression?\n\nI think I've done four or five American tours. And yo, America is so big [laughs]. My first American tour had me in shambles, because of the flights. I didn't realize that to go from one city to another, I might have to connect once or twice depending on how far I'm going. So the flights had me in shambles, but the energy of the people? Oh my days, lit! America is definitely one of my favorite places. I’m always reminding my agents to make sure that they include American cities on my tours, which is why even for the album listening parties for Rebel Queen, we did the first one in Paris, then London, and then we had to come to New York as well. And then just yesterday, we had one in Lagos as well.\n\nSince you first became popular, a lot of Afrobeats artists have gained a following abroad like Burna Boy and WizKid. It seems as though, at least looking at the artists that break outside of Africa, that the genre is still very male-dominated. Do you agree with that? And do you think there’s potential for more female artists to break out internationally?\n\nHonestly, when I started out, the odds were really way more against women than they are right now, in that, there were female artists sprouting maybe once every two years, or once every year, and barely hanging around long enough. But now, the story is different. And I give kudos to all the women before me and all the women with me. Yes, in a male dominated society, it seems as though my male counterparts get their roses and their flowers for a second. And you know, once in a while someone comes back and remembers, \"Oh, there's Yemi Alade.\" Do you know what I mean?\n\nI was speaking to someone earlier today and I was saying, I think what surprises me the most is that, I feel like there are no expectations of female artists. So like, if we do or we don't, people are just moving on. But I'm not the one to play victim, never. Despite the odds, you see that the females continue to be resilient, because we know. I know deep within that my existence is definitely of value to so many people out there.\n\nWhat do you think of the upcoming generation of talent like Tems and Ayra Starr and Tyla, who recently won the first GRAMMY Award for Best African Music Performance for \"Water?\"\n\nExceptional, exceptional artists. As you just mentioned, they're doing amazingly well. And, you know, these women are unique in their own ways. And I want to just say that I believe it's just the starting point for them. There's so much to come. And there's so many other females that are still en route to greatness.\n\nHow have you seen the music industry in Africa evolve? And what sorts of challenges do you think African musicians face today?\n\nI personally feel like, with all the momentum that Afrobeats has got, we need authentic platforms that can actually check the streaming numbers that are coming in for music, especially within Africa. Because at the moment it’s mostly Apple, Spotify, etc. But there are other platforms here in Africa that most Africans use, and they have more of a database compared to Apple and Spotify. We've come to a point where we need to have more credible numbers, because there's millions of people streaming music in Africa that are not on those platforms.\n\nSo you think that these local platforms need to be counted alongside Apple and Spotify?\n\n100 percent. In Nigeria there’s two: Audiomack and Boomplay. Boomplay is a big deal.\n\nYou’re going on a decade in the industry. In all that time, what's one moment or one achievement that gives you the greatest sense of accomplishment? What are you most proud of in your career?\n\nThat’s a big question…I think I have an idea, because there've been so many moments in my life and in my career that have aligned with my dreams coming true. Number one is each time that I'm approached by a complete stranger and the stranger tells me \"Oh my God, Yemi. You don't know what your music has done for me. Your music has gotten me through so much grief.\" Some people walk up to me and tell me that they just had the biggest struggle in their life and they listen to my music, and it always sends them into a realm of joy and happiness. Honestly, I feel accomplished in those moments, because when I record my music, I always say, the thing I'm trying to spread through my music the most is love, joy and happiness. So to have people testify to that, it means to me that the magic is complete, that my job is actually effective. So that makes me feel very accomplished.\n\nOn a personal note, an accomplishment that I am most grateful to is the fact that I'm always able to comfortably take care of my family. It's something that I would never play down. You know, I'm just grateful to God for that.\n\nAnd lastly, aside from winning a GRAMMY through Angelique Kidjo — you know, I've met a lot of amazing people, and Beyoncé is one of them. So at the end of the day, it's a full circle moment for me. I'm just enjoying the ride.\n\nYou know, it’s funny you mentioned Beyoncé, I was just about to ask you what it was like to work with her.\n\nOh my days — wow, working with her, it was such an experience for myself and my team. It was like, we're literally awake, walking in the dreams that we have dreamt for so long.The process of her team contacting us was a bit weird, because my management didn't realize that Parkwood [Entertainment] was a real company, that they were emailing them and talking about Beyoncé. They assumed that it was some kind of scam artist. But when they had sent it to me, I was like \"What? Parkwood? Who doesn’t know Parkwood is Beyoncé?\"\n\nSo it turned out that it was for real, and we went to L.A. where the studio was, and I lost my voice for 24 hours — I couldn’t talk, I couldn’t sing. I just soaked up all the vitamin C's and hot teas and Throat Coats I could get. I managed to regain a little bit of my voice back and that's what I was able to record that day. That was a miracle for me. But one of the most memorable moments was actually meeting her in person. After the album, Lion King, came out, the movie was being premiered in London, and I happened to be in London at that time. We had met her in person, we met Jay Z. It was such a full circle moment. Honestly, that lady has really touched my life in a way that I will never forget. Because she could have lived her life without doing what she did, but she decided to reach out to people she felt were pillars of African music and pay homage to Africa. And I'm happy to have been part of that moment."
