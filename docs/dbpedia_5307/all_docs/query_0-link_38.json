        "text": "1.\n\nTy Dolla $ign‘s star-studded “Or Nah” remix has been everywhere for the past four months, and today, Ty finally releases an accompanying visual for the record.\n\nThe cinematic video finds Ty, Wiz Khalifa, and The Weeknd each isolated in various appropriately themed locations. Ty and Wiz deliver their respective verses from atop a picturesque hill in Los Angeles while The Weeknd appears in a white-walled bathroom, accompanied by a topless blonde female. The vibe is overtly sensual all the way through, making for an effective visual enhancement to the hit track. Watch in full above."
