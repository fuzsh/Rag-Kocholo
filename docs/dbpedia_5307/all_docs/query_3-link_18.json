Of course some familiar faces continued to reign, like Migos, Future, Drake, Gucci Mane and Kendrick Lamar. It was also a year of interesting collaborations: Pharrell had Rihanna try her hand at rapping, Jay-Z and No I.D. threw it back to the Blueprint era, and Calvin Harris competed with DJ Khaled to see who could have the most features on an album. Overall, a super eclectic and exciting year in hip-hop!\n\nTracklist: Read the rest of this entry »\n\nDOWNLOAD\n\nFor the third installment of The Producer Series, we salute two kings! Rich Harrison dominated the 2000s R&B charts, bringing back funk and go-go samples on huge hits for Amerie, Beyonce, J-Lo and Usher, among others.

D.R.A.M. and Yachty broke through with the sublimely weird “Broccoli,” Young M.A. had her moment in the spotlight with “Ouuuuu,” and Lil Uzi Vert hit radio (more from him in 2017!). Despite it being the streaming era, rap fans were blessed with some great full length albums, most notably from Chance (Coloring Book), Kanye (Pablo), and Drake (Views from the 6) plus Tribe’s comeback (We got it from here…). Top it off with a dash of Missy, a pinch of 2 Chainz, and a drop of A$AP Ferg, and you have a stellar year of hip-hop!\n\nTracklist:\n\nKanye West – Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1 (ft.

But most importantly it’s a banging mix from start to finish!\n\nTracklist:\n\nRead the rest of this entry »\n\nDownload\n\nSubscribe to Hip-Hop History in iTunes\n\n2014 was a banner year for a handful of rappers and producers who were familiar to hip-hop fans – Young Money, GOOD Music, Wiz Khalifa, Rick Ross, etc – but their music was evolving and absorbing influences from the margins. Upstarts Fetty Wap, Rae Sremmurd, Bobby Shmurda, OT Genasis, Makonnen and Dej Loaf all scored huge hits and got cosigns from the previous generation of rap stars. DJ Mustard kept chugging along with a string of top 10 radio records in a streak which may have only been preceded by The Neptunes the decade prior.\n\nHistory of Hip Hop 2014 is a rich tapestry of ATL trap, West Coast gangster rap and NYC drug dealer anthems, plus a ton of styles that defy categorization (D.R.A.M. raps over a Nintendo theme, Vic Mensa sings over deep house, Mystikal does a spot-on James Brown impression and Kanye is flipping full on gospel music). We hope you enjoy listening to the mix as much as we did making it!\n\nTracklist:\n\nRead the rest of this entry »\n\nDownload\n\nSubscribe to Hip-Hop History in iTunes\n\n2013, what a year! A$AP Mob and TDE lead the vanguard, with big records from both Rocky & Ferg, and Schoolboy Q featuring Kendrick. 2 Chainz had a hell of a year, DJ Mustard was still churning out hits left and right, Kanye dropped Yeezus and Drake answered with Nothing Was The Same. R&B and melodic rap converged to the point where it was sometimes a little hard to know which was which (Future, Rich Homie Quan, J. Cole, Ty Dolla Sign, Chance, Thug, and of course Drake). Plus Run the Jewels and Migos both debuted!\n\nTracklist:\n\nRead the rest of this entry »\n\nThere’s an argument to be made that 2012 was one of the greatest years in hip-hop. The Rub’s History of Hip Hop 2012 mix argues the case forcefully, with wall to wall bangers in a plethora of regional styles.\n\nLA’s DJ Mustard produced approximately 99.9% of the songs on hip-hop & R&B radio, and Kendrick Lamar dropped a masterpiece of an LP. Future, Macklemore, and Trinidad James blew up, Big Sean, Meek Mill and 2 Chainz had monster radio records, and Kanye’s G.O.O.D. music compilation kept him on the airwaves (alongside Jay-Z and Pusha T). NOLA bounce saw a big resurgence: Nicky Da B went from local artist to international sensation with “Express Yourself,” and the “Triggaman” beat found its way into big club singles by T.I. & Lil Wayne, Trina and Meek Mill among others. ATL-style hip-hop trap and EDM-style trap began to play nice together, and DJs like Bauuer, Diplo, Lunice & Hudson Mohawke, RL Grime and Cashmere Cat all had big hybrid hip-hop-R&B-EDM-trap records. The Bay area scene also produced a bunch of hits, especially HBK Gang. Throw in a NY renaissance – French Montana, Nicki Minaj, ASAP Mob, Action Bronson, El-P, etc – and you’ve got yourself a banner year for hip-hop.\n\nListen to all of 33 of The Rub’s History mixes, from 1979 to 2012, at http://www.itstherub.com/category/history-of-hip-hop/.\n\nDOWNLOAD The Rub – Hip Hop History 2012\n\nTracklist: Read the rest of this entry »\n\nAs The Rub’s History of Hip Hop mix series moves into the teens, the range of styles ever widens, touching on everything from classic soul samples to weird dubstep beats. (Watch The Throne had both.) Drake, Lil Wayne and Rick Ross were featured on everything; Juicy J. was putting out mixtapes at an astonishing rate, and Meek Mill had a couple of career-defining hits. J. Cole, Big Sean, Future, A$AP Mob, Odd Future and the Black Hippy crew were the new kids on the block, and Kreayshawn and YC were the year’s biggest one hit wonders. In R&B, both The Weeknd and Frank Ocean debuted in 2011. All told, it’s a pretty incredible year to revisit!\n\nSo enjoy this blast from the recent past, and remember you can catch up on all of The Rub History of Hip Hop mixes (1979 – 2011) at http://www.itstherub.com/category/history-of-hip-hop/.\n\nDOWNLOAD The Rub – Hip Hop History 2011\n\nTracklist: Read the rest of this entry »\n\nThe next movie in our Hip-Hop History Movie Series with Alamo Drafthouse is Fade To Black. Set against Jay-Z’s 2003 sold out concert at Madison Square Garden (and threatened final performance before retirement), FADE TO BLACK explores Jay’s career, creative process, and the making of “The Black Album”, interspersed with performance of so many of his bangers – “Hard Knock Life”, “Crazy in Love”, etc. – thrown in.

Kelly, Q-Tip, Usher, Rick Rubin,?uestlove, Timbaland, Kanye, Pharrell, Just Blaze, Memphis Bleek, Beanie Sigel, Freeway, and Ghostface.\n\nJoin us after the movie in House of Wax for a special set of all Jay-Z songs to celebrate his birthday two days before!\n\nGET TICKETS\n\nFans of The Rub’s History of Hip Hop series have been asking for new episodes since 2009, and your dreams have finally been fulfilled! We pick up right where we left off, and we’ll be dropping another year every month until we’re caught up.\n\n2010 was dominated by a few big stars – Young Money’s Nicki Minaj, Drake and Lil Wayne were on the radio and in clubs nonstop, along with huge hits by Rick Ross, Wiz Khalifa, and Kanye. Yelawolf, Big K.R.I.T. and J. Cole were the hot up-and-comers. It was Ludacris and Jeezy’s last really stellar year, and we also got surprising comeback singles from Dipset, Lloyd Banks, Nas and Big Boi. And 2010 was a great year for producers, including Lex Luger, AraabMuzik, Clams Casino, Stargate and of course Kanye West and Swizz Beats.\n\nSo enjoy this blast from the recent past, and remember you can catch up on all of The Rub History of Hip Hop mixes (1979 – 2010) at http://www.itstherub.com/category/history-of-hip-hop/.\n\nDOWNLOAD The Rub – Hip Hop History 2010\n\nTracklist: Read the rest of this entry »"
