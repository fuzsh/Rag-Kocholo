        "text": "Last year, the delightfully raunchy Californian R&B singer Ty Dolla $ign released his deeply enjoyable Beach House 2 mixtape, which just yesterday produced the butt-centric “Ratchet In My Benz” video. He’s just now announced plans to release a proper Beach House EP, and the first single, “Or Nah” plays up the excellent trick of singing about wanting to fuck, in the crassest terms possible, and investing a sort of smooth emotional desperation in it. Wiz Khalifa gets an Auto-Tuned singsong verse in, and the great producer DJ Mustard’s beat borrows a trick from Trillville’s “Some Cut” and uses squeaking bedsprings as part of its beat. Listen below.\n\nThe Beach House EP is out 1/21 on Atlantic."
