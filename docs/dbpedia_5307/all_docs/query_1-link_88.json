        "text": "What Is DJ Mustard's Net Worth?\n\nDJ Mustard is an American record producer and DJ who has a net worth of $20 million. According to legal filings made in January 2023 by his former wife Chanel Thierry, Mustard made well over $10 million in gross income in 2022, and expected him to make as much, perhaps more in 2023.\n\nDJ Mustard collaborates frequently with R&B artists such as Ty Dolla Sign and YG. His entrance into mainstream music was on the 2011 single \"Rack City\" with Tyga. Some of his other hit tracks include \"I'm Different,\" performed by 2 Chainz, \"HeadBand,\" performed by B.o.B featuring 2 Chainz, \"My Nigga,\" performed by YG featuring Jeezy and Rich Homie Quan, and \"Show Me,\" performed by Kid Ink featuring Chris Brown. DJ Mustard has also released his own mixtape called \"Ketchup.\"\n\nEarly Life\n\nDJ Mustard was born Dijon Isaiah McFarlane on June 5, 1990, in Los Angeles, California. His parents are Jamaican parents, and McFarlane has stated that his father was deported back to Jamaica when he was a child but that they have kept in touch over the years. He began DJing when he was in elementary school, first DJing with his uncle, a professional DJ, at family parties. He gleaned his stage name from the condiment dijon mustard.\n\nCareer\n\nDJ Mustard began to make a name for himself as a producer when he started producing mixtapes for rapper YG. His success with YG led to interest from other artists, and he began to cultivate his own sound, which is now called \"ratchet music.\" In 2010, DJ Mustard released a compilation album through Thump Records called \"Let's Jerk.\" He took the name after a style of street dance in Los Angeles called \"jerking.\"\n\nIn 2011, he produced Tyga's single \"Rack City\" from his second album titled \"Careless World: Rise of the Last King.\" It was released in December of that year and hit #1 on the hot R&B/Hip Hop chart, #7 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, and #2 on the Hot Rap Songs charts. The song was certified double platinum and gave DJ Mustard a much-needed boost in the entertainment world. DJ Mustard produced tracks from Tyga's next mixtape, as well as his song \"Hit Em Up.\" In 2012, he produced the 2 Chainz song \"I'm Different,\" which charted at #6 on the Hot R&B/Hip Hop chart and was certified gold. The song sold over 500,000 copies digitally. That summer, he produced songs for Young Jeezy and Bow Wow. DJ Mustard finally released his first mixtape, \"Ketchup,\" in 2013.\n\nDJ Mustard released his debut studio album, \"10 Summers,\" in 2014. The album reached #14 on the US Rap chart and #20 on the US R&B/Hip-Hop chart. His second album, \"Cold Summer,\" was released in 2016 and also reached #14 on the US Rap chart and #24 on the US R&B/Hip-Hop chart. Mustard produced Kid Ink's song \"Main Chick,\" and it peaked at #3 on the U.S. Rhythmic \"Billboard\" chart. He released the mixtape \"10 Summers: The Mixtape Vol. 1\" in 2015 with \"10 Summers.\" Around this time, he produced songs for B.o.B and Chris Brown. Brown's single \"Show Me\" peaked at #1 on the U.S. Rhythmic \"Billboard\" chart. DJ Mustard produced YG's debut studio single \"My Nigga,\" and it peaked at #5 on the U.S. Rhythmic \"Billboard\" chart. His second album was \"Cold Summer,\" released in 2016. He went on to release a third album, \"Perfect Ten,\" on June 28, 2019. This album spawned a Grammy-nominated single, \"Ballin.\"\n\nDJ Mustard has also produced the successful singles \"Feelin' Myself\" by Will.i.am (featuring French Montana, Miley Cyrus, and Wiz Khalifa), \"Na Na\" by Trey Songz, \"2 On\" by Tinashe (featuring Schoolboy Q), \"Who Do You Love?\" by YG (featuring Drake), \"Main Chick\" by Kid Ink (featuring Chris Brown), \"Don't Tell 'Em\" by Jeremih (featuring YG), \"No Mediocre\" by T.I. (featuring Iggy Azalea), \"I Don't Fâ€” with You\" by Big Sean (featuring E-40), \"L.A. Love (La La)\" by Fergie, \"Post to Be\" by Omarion (featuring Chris Brown and Jhene Aiko), and many more.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nWhen DJ Mustard was 19, he began dating model Chanel Thierry. The pair got engaged in 2018 and were married in October 2020. They have two sons and a daughter. Upon separating, Mustard initially agreed to provide $35,000 in monthly child support. In January 2023, she requested an increase in support to $83,000 per month. He pushed back citing a pre-marital agreement. The couple was still fighting over custody and support payments a year later.\n\nIn June 2020, Mustard revealed over Instagram that he had lost nearly 50 pounds with a photo showcasing his new, more slender physique. He captioned the photo: \"I made a promise to myself in January before the lock down that I was gonna focus more on my health, myself, get off of social media, and ignore all the distractions that i didn't need! Well here I am today, 30 years old and 47 pounds down\".\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn January 2017, DJ Mustard paid $2.36 million for a gated three-acre property in the Los Angeles suburb of Chatsworth. The property features a 7,400-square-foot mansion with six bedrooms and seven bathrooms."
