        "text": "So after last week, I was hoping for a bit of a breather this week – and believe it or not, I got it. After the storm comes a sort of calm, and we might have one of the least active weeks of the year thus far, thanks the album release schedule slowing down to give us all a breather. And considering I used most of this week to catch up on releases I wouldn’t have otherwise covered, it’s kind of nice that Billboard BREAKDOWN also feels a little easier.\n\nAnd interestingly, that trend continued into our top ten, where things were actually pretty slow this week, or at least not all that surprising. Unsurprisingly, ‘See You Again’ by Wiz Khalifa & Charlie Puth ruled the week, again with the sizeable airplay gains compensating for the shrinking sales and still ruling streaming, and considering that the song hasn’t shown the slightest signs of slowing down, I reckon unless something smashes from out of nowhere, it looks like it might have some longevity at the top. Right behind it at #2 we have ‘Trap Queen’ by Fetty Wap, which has been seen as the closest challenger with strong sales and absolutely huge streaming, but airplay did slow this week, and I’m not sure it’s got the swell to take it right to the top. Next ‘Earned It’ by The Weeknd regained its peak at #3 thanks to still holding radio dominance, but I get the feeling its less because of its strengths and more due to weaknesses lower down the charts, because even though it did have a good sales week, streaming has been mostly static and airplay has been wavering. It took over the spot of ‘Uptown Funk’ by Mark Ronson & Bruno Mars, which might have a lot of dominance on YouTube and still respectable streaming, but that’s about it, as sales dropped even further and airplay has been steadily falling away – it’s really only as high as it is thanks to extended radio inertia. But where things get interesting is ‘Shut Up And Dance’ by Walk The Moon, which was nearly matching ‘See You Again’ for radio airplay gains, is right behind it in sales… and yet feels stalled out because streaming hasn’t picked up in the same way. It’ll probably take ‘Uptown Funk’s spot in a week or two or maybe beat ‘Earned It’ if the airplay collapses, but probably not much higher. Beneath it is ‘Sugar’ by Maroon 5 somehow holding steady at #6, which slipped in every category except YouTube, but didn’t do so quickly enough to fall faster. Looks to be a similar case with ‘Love Me Like You Do’ with losses across the board, really relying on airplay to prop up against painfully weak sales numbers. And yet that airplay was enough to hold off ‘Want To Want Me’ by Jason Derulo at #8, which did have gains all week across the board… and yet, bizarrely, streaming has been inconsistent, not quite enough to really shove it over the top. Then we have ‘Thinking Out Loud’ by Ed Sheeran rising up to #9 – and let’s make this clear, it wasn’t because it had huge gains – yeah, a better than average sales week, but airplay and streaming were stalled or continuing to fall. Similar case with ‘G.D.F.R.’ by Flo Rida, Lookas, and Sage The Gemini re-entering at #10, as it lost hard this week across the board. Nope, the reasons these songs came back is because T-Wayne’s ‘Nasty Freestyle’ dropped out as streaming started to slip and radio gave it nothing – in other words, while it might have gotten high, I don’t see it lasting much longer.\n\nAnd on that note, let’s talk about our losers and dropouts, of which there was not a lot this week whatsoever. I mean, our biggest dropouts were ‘Centuries’ by Fall Out Boy, which was on its way out naturally, and ‘Legend’ by Drake, which shouldn’t have lasted as long as it did anyways. As for our losers, most aren’t all that surprising: ‘Say You Do’ by Dierks Bentley is reaching the natural end of its chart run sliding to 66, ‘Homegrown’ by the Zac Brown Band drops to 57 as the hype around its album is starting to fade, and ‘Nobody Love’ by Tori Kelly takes a sharp drop to 95 because, well, it hasn’t really caught on the way that I expected it would. The one drop that did surprise me in hindsight was ‘I Want You To Know’ by Zedd & Selena Gomez – yeah, it’s been slipping for the past few weeks, but considering Zedd’s dropping a new album, you’d think it’d have been given a little more of a push.\n\nAnd believe it or not, we had even less major gains. The first was ‘One Hell Of An Amen’ by Brantley Gilbert gaining a little traction to 85 – no surprise, Gilbert’s been missing a hit on the radio since ‘Small Town Throwdown’ left, and of his singles, this is probably the best of them. Then you had ‘Believe’ by Mumford & Sons surge up to 54 – which is no surprise, the album had a very solid opening sales week, although significantly weaker than its last album. Not exactly a surprise, because Wilder Mind is a lot worse, but you can bet the public’s response is more to the change in sound and less to any actual standard of quality. The third, and most intriguing, is ‘Cheerleader’ by OMI, which continued its rise to 47. And even though I’m kind of ambivalent on most of the song, it’s lightweight enough that I can see this easily cracking the top ten as it already has in Canada for a while now.\n\nBut that’s just a matter of time to determine, so let’s go to our returning entries… and there was none of them. Only six new songs this week, as a matter of fact, so let’s go!\n\n29. ‘Pretty Girls’ by Britney Spears & Iggy Azalea - I've been asked to cover this song ever since it dropped, and I've been delaying that effort ceaselessly because - to be honest - I really did not care. Right now Iggy Azalea has been fighting for anything that might bring her the slightest hint of relevance after the backlash hit her follow-up singles after 'Black Widow', and Britney Spears' career is a good four years past its expiration date, if not longer. And yet, I knew I'd be covering the song when I landed ont Billboard BREAKDOWN, and... oh god, I'm glad I avoided this, because this might be one of the more grating and obnoxious songs I've heard since 'Bitch Better Have My Money'. Can we start by the fact that low-synth barely passes for a melody and trying to pair it with a twinking high line sounds more creepy than enticing, especially with explosive blasts of snap percussion and blocky chunks of pitch-shifted hi-hats to match the gang vocals? In other words, I thought we already had 'Fancy' Mk. II this week! Then we get to our performers, where I'd actually argue Iggy comes out ahead in sounding slick and poised where Britney's trying to make her lower range emote with as much autotune piled on as possible trying to imitate Charli XCX's vocal inflection. Instead it sounds insufferably obnoxious, at least until we get to the verses where the multi-tracking at least helps. And lyrically... what is there to say about this? It's a song that has the substance of 'Valley Girl' trying to fuse with spacey imagery to try to make it remotely interesting - except when Frank Zappa made that song, he was spoofing this sort of vapid behavior instead of celebrating it. And it's not even hyperbolic in a ridiculous way like 'Tik Tok' was - Kesha at least understood if she was going to make this sort of song, she'd emphasize the trashiness in a way that stood a chance of being populist or at least self-aware. This song, on the other hand, is so inssufferably pleased with itself that it makes my skin crawl.\n\nSo yeah, that was this week, and really, it was pretty good, at least in terms of my workload. For the Best of the Week, 'Coffee' by Miguel easily runs away with it, but 'I Need Your Love' by Shaggy, Mohombi, Faybee, and Costi is pretty solid too. For the worst... oh, it's not even difficult, with both of our 'Fancy' wannabes snagging the slots, with Jidenna and Roman GianArthur at least rising to Dishonourable Mention for having a little more restraint. 'Pretty Girls' easily takes the worst, and good riddance. Knowing our luck, it'll probably end up sticking around thanks to the combined star power of both artists, but we can hope for better."
