        "text": "#NobodySafeTour should have been called the #EverybodyLitTour. On Friday, June 16, Future stopped in Los Angeles to take the stage at The Forum. Opening guests included Zoey Dollaz, Tory Lanez, A$AP Ferg, and Migos.\n\nBefore we jump into the night, we need to discuss the fact that I didn‚Äôt even know I was going until the morning of! With positive vibes and two of the best concert plugs I know, I received a call at 8:30AM that Friday morning. My friend on the other line said, ‚ÄúGet ready to go see Future tonight.‚Äù Best wake-up call E V E R. So clearly that‚Äôs all I was thinking about for the rest of the day.\n\nCut to the evening.\n\nThe three of us arrived at The Forum around 8PM and went to will call to pick up our tickets. We still didn‚Äôt know where we were sitting but were pumped regardless because we were seeing Future and Migos. Duh.\n\n*picks up tickets at will call*\n\nWe weren‚Äôt ready for this.\n\n7TH ROW FLOOR SEATS\n\nAre you kidding me? Happy freaking Friday. After a few ‚ÄúOMG‚Äù minutes, we made our way into The Forum to get a much needed beer and to find our seats.\n\nWalking down to the floor was surreal. Although I‚Äôve been on the ground level at The Forum for Kanye‚Äôs Saint Pablo Tour and Drake x Future‚Äôs Summer Sixteen Tour, it‚Äôs just as exciting each time, and I will be forever grateful and appreciative of these experiences.\n\nSo we missed Zoey Dollaz, Tory Lanez, and A$AP Ferg. Do it look like we stressin‚Äô? Nah. We were really there for Migos and Future.\n\nThe lights dimmed and Migos took the stage. These three guys are really living their best life. They‚Äôre the most popular rappers / rap group right now. Before you come at me and try to hit me with a ‚Äúwhat about Kendrick Lamar?‚Äù question, pause for one second. He is the best rapper but as far as popularity right now and being featured on other artist‚Äôs songs and performances‚Ä¶ Migos.\n\nAs if their set wasn‚Äôt lit enough, they brought out 21 Savage. Talk about #ForTheCulture.\n\nThat was the first time I‚Äôd seen them live, and I‚Äôd definitely go see them again. Oh wait. I am. June 24 as part of the BET Experience üôÇ\n\nTime for Future.\n\nFuture‚Äôs set started with computer malfunction visuals on a giant screen, followed by him appearing and kicking off his set with ‚ÄúDraco.‚Äù I‚Äôve seen Future a handful of times now, and each time he gets better. He‚Äôs definitely not at the same star level as The Weeknd or Drake yet, but his energy and passion for performing is up there.\n\nWith a great mix of old and new songs, Future did not disappoint. He brought out Ty Dolla $ign, A$AP Ferg, A$AP Rocky, and DJ Esco brought out ScHoolboy Q.\n\nBut nothing and I mean nothing could have prepared me for the last surprise guest. He goes by the name of‚Ä¶\n\nD R I Z Z Y D R A K E\n\nIt‚Äôs always difficult for me to put into words of what and how I feel during a Drake performance. It‚Äôs just the best. His songs mixed with his energy and stage presence just make for the ultimate time, and I am truly the happiest. Like I start rapping along and dancing then find myself pausing and just thinking, ‚ÄúI am watching m favorite artist of all time live right now.‚Äù #FangirlThoughts\n\nDrake performed ‚ÄúJumpman,‚Äù ‚ÄúPortland‚Äù (he brought out Quavo), ‚ÄúFake Love,‚Äù and ‚ÄúGyalchester‚Äù for the first time in LA.\n\nOnly performing four songs made the overall concert that much better. And while I‚Äôm a huge Future fan, the crowd‚Äôs energy during Drake‚Äôs mini set may have been a little greater than during Future‚Äôs.\n\nIn the end, this was by far the best Future concert I‚Äôve been to and probably one of the top five concerts I‚Äôve attended overall. I can‚Äôt thank my two friends enough for hooking it up with the tickets. These are experiences that mean the absolute most to me.\n\nAlso important to note that Future wore a lot of black and yellow outfits ‚Äì a #californyinz moment.\n\nUntil the next concert‚Ä¶\n\nYes, I watched the debate last night. Yes, I rolled my eyes/laughed at Donald Trump‚Äôs statements. Yes, I was drinking wine. And yes, I was still thinking about Dolla Day at the Hollywood Palladium.\n\nOn Sunday, September 25, Ty Dolla $ign hosted his inaugural Dolla Day concert. He promoted the show as Ty Dolla $ign and friends. And boiiiiiii did he bring out friends. Before I get into that though, let‚Äôs briefly talk about the show.\n\nWith today being National Voter Registration Day and Ty‚Äôs new album being titled Campaign, the concert was somewhat tailored to voting. This is a very good example of celebrities, specifically artists, using their voice (literally) to encourage people to make a move. The title of his album alone, Campaign, already gets the thought into your head. The decor inside the Palladium even had election vibes to it ‚Äì red and white balloons, banners lining the balcony, and at the very end the balloons fell from the ceiling, as did red and white confetti.\n\nTy even opened the show with about 30 men dressed in suits walking across the stage, followed by black and white visuals on the big screen with crowds of people in LA waving signs about voting as Ty was walking among them. All small yet powerful ways to encourage others, especially the younger crowds, to vote.\n\nAlright now let‚Äôs talk about the ‚Äòfriends‚Äô Mr. Dolla $ign brought with him.\n\nIn order of appearance:\n\n24hrs\n\nMadeintyo\n\nJoe Moses\n\nDJ Mustard\n\nTC\n\nBelly\n\nG-Eazy\n\nJames Fauntelory\n\nA$AP Rocky\n\nWiz Khalifa (yinzer love)\n\nKendrick Lamar\n\nOkay, but seriously. Could those ‚Äòfriends‚Äô be any more epic? I mean, look at those last three performers. What even?! Oh, and did I mention that a ticket for this concert was $5? Yes, five whole doll hairs‚Ä¶ $9.25 with tax. So incredible, and I appreciate Ty for wanting to put on this one-of-a-kind concert for the city of LA at a price where ALL were able to enjoy.\n\nIf you haven‚Äôt seen Ty Dolla $ign live or if you don‚Äôt listen to him, you should! He can rap, sing, play the guitar, pump up the crowd, serenade the crowd, and overall spread positivity throughout. Amazing.\n\nEnough rambling. Watch my Snap story below. Enjoy, yinz!\n\nWhat a time to be alive.\n\nLast Wednesday, September 7 I attended the Summer Sixteen Tour featuring Drake and Future. Now, I haven‚Äôt been to a Drake tour since May of 2012, so you can only imagine how excited I was.\n\nSix of us attended, and we all met in downtown Los Angeles for the start of an epic night. Our seats weren‚Äôt even all together, but that didn‚Äôt matter because by the end of the show, we all migrated to one section and raged there.\n\nI think I‚Äôve mentioned this before, but I tend to go into a state of celebushock during certain events and moments. Last Wednesday was one of them. I only had one beer but due to the fact I was so amped to be there and that Drake was playing banger after banger, it really had me having my moments.\n\n‚ÄúI live for the nights that I can‚Äôt remember, with the friends that I won‚Äôt forget.‚Äù -Drake\n\nWhile I love Future and his shows, I would have to say Summer Sixteen Tour was a Drake show with a side of Future. Drake and Future‚Äôs combined sets were about two and a half hours, and I really think Future took up about 45 minutes. Someone please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. #BlameItOnCelebushock\n\nIn short: Drake opened, brought out YG, Future did his thang who also brought out Ty Dolla $ign, Drake came back on with Future, Future peaced, Drake brought out Snoop Dogg, then Drake closed the show.\n\nFrom the very beginning until the end, Drake did not want the night or energy to stop. He kept saying that if the crowd was good to him, he‚Äôd be good to us and that he was. My favorite part was when he busted out a medley of all his older songs. I die. And although they were just snippets of the songs, the way he had them flowing into one another was dope and kept the crowd very engaged.\n\nI also had the opportunity to take over the WordOnRoad Snapchat. For those of you who don‚Äôt know, WordOnRoad is Drake‚Äôs official fan page and site that he actually supports and endorses. So if you‚Äôre a Drake fan, I highly encourage you to follow them on Twitter and Instagram. And follow their Snap as well! Username: ViewsOnRd\n\nEnough of the rambles. Watch my YouTube video below ‚Äì compiled Snaps from the night ‚Äì so you can better experience what the concert was like! I also made the day completely about Drake and Future (not like it‚Äôs different from any other day) so be sure to check it!\n\nFrom the energy of the crowd to the overall production to my own personal excitement, Drake outdid himself. Future, too. But more so for Drake. The production value was v. high on the Summer Sixteen Tour.\n\nUp next‚Ä¶ Beyonc√©‚Ä¶ tonight at Dodger Stadium.\n\nStay tuned on my Snap, yinz (@ergense)!\n\nHappy Wednesday! Hope yinz are having a great week.\n\nMine has been pretty chill except for last Friday, which was all the way turned up. As I mentioned in Thursday‚Äôs post, I was heading to Future‚Äôs Purple Reign Tour at the Hollywood Palladium. Let me detail the day‚Äôs events for you all.\n\nParker and Sydney met at Agatay around 1ish. We enjoyed some beverages, called the Uber, and an hour and fifteen minutes later, we arrived at Future‚Äôs pop-up shop on Fairfax. Before we went inside the store, we decided to get some food at this Italian spot right next door called Jon and Vinny‚Äôs. Wish I could tell you how the food was but we didn‚Äôt end up eating there. We never even placed our order. Once we sat down, I hopped onto Snapchat to see if Future had posted anything. Well, he did, and I‚Äôm glad I checked. His Snap read ‚ÄòFairfax 410.‚Äô Well guess where we were‚Ä¶ Fairfax 412. (412 yinz yasss).\n\nEating at this point was not an option. Getting in line for his store was. We were in the front of the line with a couple of big security dudes in suits who advised us that once we got in the store, we were not to take any pictures or videos. Fair enough. We entered the store, and the three of us all purchased some Freebandz swag. Next thing I know, Sydney tells me to look up and freaking Future is there, all 6+ feet of him. He was wearing a pair of light denim jeans and a white hoodie. He was super chill ‚Äì on his phone with two of his kids running around him. Talk about a meet and greet but sans meeting. Or really greeting. But you get it.\n\nWe then took an Uber to the Palladium where Parker got in line, which was already wrapped around the building at 5:45pm. Syd and I got some food, grabbed an order to-go for Parker and patiently waited until the doors opened. We were really close to the front ‚Äì about four rows back. The crowd wasn‚Äôt too bad. LA‚Äôs own DJ Dre Sinatra had everyone hype with club bangers. There were two opening acts before Ty Dolla $ign. Not gonna lie, I don‚Äôt know their names. Moving on. Ty came out and crushed it. I really really love seeing him perform. He‚Äôs also super talented. The man can rap and sing. He loves the fans too. He actually stage dove into the crowd and lost a shoe! He proceeded to take off his other shoe and threw it towards us. He brought out Juicy J and Joe Moses. Too dope. Watch some of his set below!\n\nTowards the end of his set, he made the mistake of telling the crowd to move as close to the stage as possible. Seriously, you could not move. I don‚Äôt do well in tight spaces where people are all up in my business to begin with, but this was just ridiculous. We were shifting as one unit, the chick‚Äôs hair in front of me was in my face/mouth area, my right arm was smooshed up against this one mass of a man. So Sydney and I stayed in our spots for as long as we could during Future‚Äôs set, but then we couldn‚Äôt take it any longer. We moved to the back, got some water (I really ‚ÄòThought It Was a Drought‚Äô) and were able to still see and dance. We left Parker up in the front and re-connected with him at the end.\n\nOkay now about Future‚Äôs performance! It. Was. Lit. He opened with ‚ÄòThought It Was a Drought‚Äô and did most of his mainstream songs mixed with some early Future. Girls and guys of all ages and races were rapping along with him. I‚Äôm even talking about a 12-year-old boy who was there with his dad. Dad, you were the real MVP. From the lights to the overall sound, the show captivated the audience and Future really made you feel part of his set. You can just tell he vibes hard with his fans and appreciates them. Future took a little break and out came DJ Esco who kept everyone going with some crowd favorites. Future came back on and ended his set with one of my personal favorites, ‚ÄòMarch Madness.‚Äô He performed for about an hour and a half in total.\n\nThe entire Purple Reign Tour was worth every penny. Not sure how he did it, but as soon as the LA show was over, Future hopped onto his tour bus to head back to Santa Ana for ANOTHER show. He performed there the night before and in Tempe, AZ even earlier that Thursday evening. Four shows in two days. That‚Äôs impressive. And I imagine his energy level was hype each show. That just proves his passion for music, touring, and the fans.\n\nNext concert‚Ä¶ Rihanna and Travi$ Scott, but that‚Äôs not until May. That‚Äôs all for today!"
