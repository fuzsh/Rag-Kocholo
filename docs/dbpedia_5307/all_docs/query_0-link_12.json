        "text": "This is probably gonna be awful. I heard it was terrible. 28 Grams was ass.\n\nTrack 1: Hope Feat. Ty$ (Prod. Ned Cameron & I.D. Labs)\n\nThis beat is nothing special. Not bad tho. Wiz is saying some shit… idk if I should call that rapping. He sounds weird. Oh never mind that was Chevy Woods. Okay, the beat just switched up. I guess that was just an intro. Here’s the real song. This hook is alright. I like this beat. He gotta average flow. Ty$ did his thing on the bridge. I fuck with this. 4/5\n\nTrack 2: We Dem Boyz (Prod. Detail)\n\nThis beat is dope. This hook is fucking stupid. Why does the beat stop if he just gon’ say the same shit he been sayin’? Of course the whole song is autotuned. Fuck nigga JUST RAP. FUCK. These lyrics are just stupid. And who the fuck are your boys, Mr. Khalifa? You only talk about yourself throughout the whole song. These lyrics are just so stupid. He’s just talkin about the same shit he’s been talking about his whole life. This song does get kinda catchy after the 7th listen. If it had some features this would be a much more interesting song. I can’t believe this nigga got the nerve to say, “All these hoes be actin so material, hol’ up hol’ up hol’ up hol’ up hol’ up hol’ up.” I ain’t even have to say why that line is hypocritical as fuck. 2/5\n\nTrack 3: Promises (Prod. Jim Jonsin)\n\nOh fuck no. Who the fuck told this nigga to sing? This shit is corny af. WTF THIS NIGGA SOUND LIKE HE ABOUT TO MAKE A SAD SONG, BUT THE SECOND BAR LITERALLY SAYS “Ima have my way with your body.” This shit is as corny as it gets from the song title to the beat to the melody. No. Stop, Wiz. Oh God. This nigga fell the fuck off HARD. NOOOOOOOO. This is awful. You’re a rapper nigga just RAP! Why the fuck all these rappers gotta try to sing on they albums? Nigga shoulda gave this beat to Chris Brown that shit would have been smoooooooooove as FUCK, my nigga. Or give it to Ty$. Isn’t he a member of Taylor Gang? How is the singer in your little “gang” harder than you? Fuck this song. Okay, he’s actually rapping now about the SAME SHIT. Tryna make a song about fuckin’ and somehow incorporating weed into the activity. This is awful. 1/5\n\nTrack 4: KK Feat. Project Pat & Juicy J (Prod. Jim Jonsin)\n\nThis beat is dope af. I fuck with this hook. Average flow from Wiz. Still talkin’ about weed, but it’s different this time because it’s Khalifa Kush. Foh, nigga. Okay Juicy J had a wack verse, but his voice sounds real good over this production and his flow wasn’t that bad. But I just can’t forgive lines like “I smoke so much KK, wish they’d of called it Juicy J.” Project Pat sounded good over this beat too, but he had some wack lines. “I’m staying with the greens… LIKE COLLARD!” I fuck with this song tho. 4/5\n\nTrack 5: House In The Hills Feat. Curren$y (Prod. I.D. Labs & Sledgren)\n\nOh no. Not Curren$y boring ass… This beat is dope af. This hook is awful. “Made a couple million and fast too. They ain’t teach a young nigga that in the classroom.” Nigga this is the real world and nobody expected (or wanted) yo wack ass to somehow become famous and make so much money. 95% of the kids in the classroom aren’t gonna get famous. And that isn’t because they’re in school it’s because nobody wants to hear anybody rap unless they have hot beats and wack bars. I swear this nigga smoked his whole brain away. Okay, here comes Curren$y. As if this song wasn’t boring enough already. Nah. Not feelin’ this shit. 2/5\n\nTrack 6: Ass Drop (Prod. Finatik N Zac)\n\nThis beat is alright I guess, but it just doesn’t work for some reason. Wiz Khalifa shouldn’t be makin’ music like this. Iamsu! should. Tyga should. I just realized how terrible of a rapper Wiz Khalifa is. The only reason he constantly does songs about weed is because he sounds corny af makin’ music about anything else. You’re a rapper and you can’t make a song about ass. How is that even possible? Wtf just happened? Is that a hook? Is that supposed to be a hook? The beat just got soft as hell and he started singin’. No. This is awful. This is just awful. The only thing good about this song is that video of amber rose twerkin’. 1/5\n\nTrack 7: Raw (Prod. Sledgren & RMB Justize)\n\nThis beat is alright. “Niggas say they want war, I’m the wrong one to play with.” Wiz Khalifa is one of the least threatening rappers ever. This hook is wack. These bars is wack. His flow wack. “Book a flight with Miley Cyrus”. Wiz Khalifa is a disgusting person, so it’s no surprise that he would consider hanging out with Miley Cyrus to be an accomplishment. 2/5\n\nTrack 8: Stayin’ Out All Night (Prod. Dr. Luke)\n\nOh God. No. NO. NOOOOOOOO! THIS SHIT IS FUCKING AWFUL. THIS BEAT ISN’T EVEN GOOD WIZ WHAT ARE YOU DOING. STOP SINGING ABOUT THIS CORNY SHIT AND RAAAAAP! THIS HOOK IS AWFUL. IT’S FUCKIN CORNY AF. OH FUCK NO SOMEONE IN THE COMMENT SECTION ON RAP GENIUS SAID “This song is a fuckin’ beautiful youth anthem. It’s like young wild and free on steroids lmao!” YOUNG WILD & FREE WAS FUCKING AWFUL. YOU ARE AWFUL. GUYS I GAVE HIS COMMENT A THUMBS DOWN. AT LEAST SOMEONE ELSE NAMED “DeeezNuutz” SAID, “Man the chorus sounds like some Miley Cyrus shit.” YES THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS SOUNDS LIKE. THIS NIGGA SMOKED HIMSELF INTO ONE OF THE DUMBEST NIGGAS IN HIP HOP. HE MIGHT EVEN BE DUMBER THAN ROZAY FOR THIS SHIT. NO WIZ. FUCK YOU. 1/5\n\nTrack 8: The Sleaze (Prod. Arthur McArthur & David Versis)\n\nI’m so sorry for using all caps, but I was pissed off and I don’t feel like going back and making it lower case. That shit was awful tho. Jesus. Okay the beat for this song isn’t bad. The hook’s alright. Apparently some “thick ass ho” is buying Wiz Khalifa stuff so that she can have sex with him. I’m sorry Wiz, but you ain’t pullin’ that off. Ain’t know woman dumb enough to sleep with yo musty ass AND buy you a playstation. I’m assuming that’s what he would get. Idk why. We all know the only reason that chick is with you is because you got money, so ain’t no way she gon buy u stuff AND give up some coochie because she know you mad stank. And even if you was lookin’ clean one day, you way too corny for her to be feelin it. That chick would have to be higher than the Kushed God himself to think that sleepin’ with Wiz is a good idea. So, yeah. Stop lyin’ to us Wiz. Hell, this nigga even told us that he was smellin’ like shit in the next bar. “Everywhere I go, I’m weed scented.” “If you a real badass, you know what I’m talkin’ about.” Okay, that’s another thing; if what you are saying is so stupid that you gotta say some shit like “If you a real nigga you gon’ fuck with this.” Then it must be pretty terrible. Wiz Khalifa fans are probably the fakest niggas in the world. What was I talkin’ about? Oh yeah, this song isn’t that bad. 3/5\n\nTrack 9: So High (Prod. Ghost Loft & StarGate)\n\nThis beat is alright. This hook could be better, but it could definitely be worse. Corny flow. This actually isn’t that bad. Not really good tho. But not bad. 3/5\n\nTrack 11: Still Down Feat. Chevy Woods & Ty$ (Prod. I.D. Labs)\n\nNot feelin’ this hook from Ty$. This beat is dope af tho. Average flow from Wiz. Chevy did his thing. It’s not that bad. The hook just kinda ruins it for me. 3/5\n\nTrack 12: No Gain (Prod. I.D. Labs)\n\nThis beat is cool. Damn. That intro was long af. This is corny as hell. This hook is wack. Nah, not feelin’ this one. And I don’t believe that “i work hard” shit at all. 2/5\n\nTrack 13: True Colors Feat. Nicki Minaj (Prod. Kane Beatz, JMike, The Order & Luca Polizzi)\n\nThis is one of the worst albums I’ve heard all year and The Pinkprint was even worse than this, so this song probably isn’t going to be very good. No this beat is wack. Why would Wiz sing the hook instead of Nicki Minaj? This hook is fucking awful. This is corny af. “All I do is smoke weed and get paid.” If I had a nickel for every time Wiz has opened a verse like that I would have like 6 dollars. This shit is terrible. Just listen to this hook. Oh no. Nicki’s singin’ her verse. Okay she’s rappin’ now. Her flow wasn’t that bad, but she ain’t sayin shit. “Can’t wait to unveil a Pinkprint cover.” If there’s one thing I liked about that album, it was the cover. Although pinkprint is just a fucking weird idea. I guess she’s obsessed with pink because she’s supposed to be for the ladies. Anyway, this shit is awful. 1/5\n\nTrack 14: We Dem Boyz Remix Feat. Rick Ross, ScHoolboy Q & Nas (Prod. RMB Justize, Sledgren & Ricky P)\n\nOf course the most repetitive song on the album gets a remix. At least the hook isn’t as bad on this version. This beat isn’t as good as the original, but it isn’t bad. Rick Ross did one of his generic “lifestyle” “we made it” “Ima bawse” “Bidness. Big bidness.” verses. Average verse from Puffy. Of course Nas had the best verse on the whole album. This song ain’t bad. I’ll give this a 4/5\n\nTrack 15: You & Your Friends Feat. Ty$ & Snoop Dogg (Prod. DJ Mustard)\n\nGeneric Mustard beat. Average hook from Ty$. Not feelin’ this verse from Wiz. Why’s he singin’? He just rhymed “lady” with “hating.” He also took up a whole bar by saying “ooh wee. baby.” I do like the way the beat got smoother when Snoop came in. He gotta boring flow on this one tho. Nah. Not feelin’ it. I hate this pop rap shit. 2/5\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nWow that shit was fucking awful. Wiz fell off hard. That might be the hardest fall a rapper has had since Weezy. I’m having trouble picking a least favorite song. Wiz just needs to either stop smoking and actually try really hard to write a verse that isn’t just fucking pathetic or just stop rapping. After this album, I would be okay with him giving up because I’m about to give up on him anyway. The only reason I would ever listen to him is if he had a lot of features on his song and a really great beat, but this shit was just terrible. He’s too poppy for me. Just like Kid Ink. Wiz Khalifa just sounds so corny when he doesn’t rap about weed and weed is one of the most boring subjects in Hip Hop.\n\nFavorite Song: KK\n\nLeast Favorite Song: Stayin’ Out All Night\n\nVerdict:\n\n46%\n\nTell me if I’m trippin’ in the comments below\n\nIf you enjoyed this article share it on Twitter & Facebook"
