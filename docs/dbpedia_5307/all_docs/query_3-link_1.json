        "text": "Grammy Award-winning, multi-Platinum producer and artist Mustard has partnered with BMG, under a new global recordings agreement, to release his fourth studio album this year. News of his upcoming album, Faith of a Mustard Seed, came earlier this month and is set to release on July 26.\n\nKnown for collaborating with some of Hip-Hop's finest (Rihanna, Kendrick Lamar, YG, Drake, Lil Wayne, The Weeknd, Chris Brown, Ella Mai, Snoop Dogg, Nipsey Hussle, Quavo, Big Sean, T.I, Wiz Khalifa), Mustard's distinctive sound transcends genres, earning widespread acclaim and accolades for his innovative productions.\n\nMost recently, Mustard produced the highly acclaimed Kendrick Lamar single 'Not Like Us'. The song was an immediate commercial success, breaking the record for the biggest single-day streams of a hip hop song in Spotify history. The track also claimed the most song streams in a week by a rapper and is the fastest rap song to surpass 100 and 200 million streams on Spotify. The single debuted atop the Billboard Global 200, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, and Streaming Songs charts simultaneously.\n\nOn the Billboard Hot 100, 'Not Like Us' debuted at No. 1, registering the highest first-week streaming figure for a hip hop song since Billboard removed YouTube song user-generated content from its chart metrics in 2020. It also became the first rap song in history to top the Hot 100 with a shortened tracking week of five days and marked Mustard's first No. 1 single and debut as a producer. The track remains as one of the only chart leaders to be penned by a sole writer.\n\nMustard said, \"I'm happy to join forces with BMG, a company known for its dedication to nurturing artistic independence, integrity, and innovation. Together, we'll continue to push the boundaries of creativity and deliver groundbreaking music that resonates with audiences worldwide.\"\n\nDan Gill, BMG Executive Vice President, Recorded Music, West Coast, said, \"Mustard's approach, coupled with a proven track record of chart-topping hits, delivers unparalleled musical experiences to audiences worldwide. We look forward to supporting and working alongside him as we continue to elevate his artistry and the impact of his music.\"\n\nTim Reid, BMG Senior Vice President, Repertoire & Marketing, said, \"Mustard's anthems have consistently orchestrated the soundtrack to the Culture. Partnering with Mustard and the 10 Summers Team on his next movement is an exciting opportunity for the BMG Team to help propel his brand and turn the ordinary into extraordinary.\n\nMustard follows previous signings of artists set to release new albums this year with BMG including YG, Logic, and Wiz Khalifa."
