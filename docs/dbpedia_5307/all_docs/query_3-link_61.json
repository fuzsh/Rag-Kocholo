        "text": "Master P Recalls How He Saved Snoop Dogg’s Life During Death Row Beef\n\nMaster P reflected on how he played a role in helping Snoop Dogg early on in his career. On Monday (May 29) the No Limit founder posted his thoughts on a situation between Snoop and his former label Death Row Records. Of course, the Doggfather rapper now owns that same label. He recalled persuading him to not post a diss record about the record company.\n\n“We have to stop thinking out of emotions! We all We Got!” he wrote in the caption. “@snoopdogg is successful & where he’s at today is because he didn’t let pride stand in his way & wasn’t afraid to change and grow, salute to my brother and partner. #GODISGOOD look how God work now he own that same record company.”\n\nRELATED: Snoop Dogg & Master P's 'Snoop Cereal' To Be Sold At Walmart Soon\n\nSnoop Dogg told the story previously in 2020 thanking Master P for “saving” his life. “Do you realize that that saved my life?” he said per HipHopDX. “Master P saved my life. I was gonna put an album out called ‘F— Death Row’ and Mack 10 was gonna give me a million dollars to put it out. I would go up there [to the office] to see Mack 10 and when I would go up there, I would have to pass by Master P’s No Limit s—. I passed by one day and Mystikal was in there.”\n\nAfter one particular studio session, Master P asked Snoop how much he wanted. He replied “15,” meaning $1,500.\n\n“I come back the next day, Master P wrote me a check for $35,000,” he continued. “So I’m like, ‘Oh, I like this n—–’s style.’ He called me to his office, he said ‘What you working on?’ I said, ‘I got this album called ‘F— Death Row.’ This muthaf—- hard.'”\n\nThe duo will be working together differently on Snoop Dogg’s cereal simply titled “Snoop Cereal” will be hitting Walmart shelves this summer.\n\nSnoop Dogg: 10 Of His Best Songs, Ranked\n\nAutumn Hawkins is the National Hip-Hop and R&B writer for Beasley Media, currently residing in New Jersey.
