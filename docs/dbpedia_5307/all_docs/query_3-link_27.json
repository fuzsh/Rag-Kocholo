        "text": "Kanye West has been known to have an eye for good collaborators, and Ty Dolla Sign is amongst one of his most frequent. West has spoken very highly of Ty and recruited him for multiple tracks off of two of his most recent projects, Ye and Kids See Ghosts.\n\nIn 2018, Ty even teased fans with the possibility of a joint album with West.\n\nNipsey Hussle’s death in March 2019 came as a shock to many. Ty Dolla Sign was at a loss for words, posting on Instagram the day of and the following day with only the word \"Speechless\" for the caption.\n\nThe two rappers had frequently collaborated on different projects and appeared to have a friendship spanning nearly the last decade, if not longer.\n\nOn August 15th, 2019, Ty made a birthday post for the late rapper, still thinking about his dear friend and fellow artist.\n\nYG and Ty Dolla Sign have long been collaborating on projects together and have maintained a friendship for over 10 years.\n\nOne of YG’s breakout hits, \"Toot It and Boot It,\" rose up the charts with the help of Ty Dolla Sign. In 2018, YG thanked Ty for 10+ years of friendship and helped celebrate his birthday in style.\n\nKid Cudi is also a close friend to Kanye West, and last year released the joint project Kids See Ghosts. Considering how often both Cudi and Ty Dolla Sign have collaborated with West, and each other, it’s clear the two have a good friendship.\n\nTy Dolla Sign has collaborated with the DJ before, but their relationship has seen some ups and downs as well.\n\nIn late 2018, Ty was arrested on drug charges while he was in Atlanta, GA. In the police footage, Skrillex is also patted down while the police search him for drugs. Ty ended up being the only one in the group to get arrested, but they all had an interesting story after that day.\n\nTy and Mac Miller collaborated on the song \"Cinderella\", but it’s clear that Miller carried more importance than just a collaborator to Ty. During an NPR Tiny Desk Concert in August 2019, Ty performed one of Miller’s songs as tribute to the late rapper, a year after Miller’s Tiny Desk concert, and almost a year after Miller’s tragic death.\n\nTy also performed during the tribute concert held to commemorate Miller, performing their collaboration in his honor."
