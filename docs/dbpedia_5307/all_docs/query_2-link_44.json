        "text": "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — The last time 50 Cent appeared at Hot 97 Summer Jam, in 2004, he was the most popular rapper of the day, the most feared, and in some circles, the most hated. But what could have been a coronation was instead a fiasco: Some old enemies started trouble in the crowd, sending chairs flying toward the stage, which 50 Cent and his crew sent flying right back before walking off with a harrumph and a ban from future Summer Jams.\n\nBut if there is one lesson taught year in and year out at Summer Jam, the annual self-celebration concert thrown by Hot 97 (WQHT 97.1 FM), the city’s leading hip-hop station, it’s that anything that has been torn asunder can always be reunited.\n\nAnd so there was 50 Cent, a decade later, performing late in the show Sunday night at MetLife Stadium here. And while bygones were being bygones, he shared the stage with Nas, a former foe, and reunited with the members of his old G-Unit crew — Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, Young Buck — all of whom he had swapped barbs with in the news media in recent years. In retrospect, that was an obvious setup for a climactic reunion, one that far outshone the new music that 50 Cent performed to an almost total lack of interest.\n\nDeclarations of war or cease-fires: Those are the great Summer Jam moments. And for years hip-hop — New York hip-hop in particular — had plenty of those on offer.\n\nBut the genre has become less tense, less overtly confrontational, and its center is nowhere near New York, which means that Summer Jam has to find new traditions, or new believers in the old ones, or accept that Summer Jam can’t be what it once was.\n\nWhich is fine, as long as it has high points like Sunday’s sometimes great show, which was often received indifferently, even at its peaks. The Los Angeles producer DJ Mustard had the thankless task of closing the show as people were streaming to the parking lot, but he persevered with an undeniable clutch of hits. His guests — the understated R&B singer Ty Dolla Sign, the wiry rapper YG and the generally blank and inexplicably popular Kid Ink — were all secondary to his beats, which throbbed with bass that literally rattled the stadium seats.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
