        "text": "If Def Jam taught us anything, it's to respect the DJ. The DJ is responsible for the perpetuation of the art form that is hip-hop. Without DJs, there'd be no medium for the streets and masses to access the music they crave.\n\nWhile many claim the title of DJ, few claim the throne, and only 30 can make the cut as the most influential tastemakers in the business. Even casual hip-hop fans may recognize most of the bigger names on this list, as they've been dominating the airwaves, clubs, and streets for quite some time. In this day and age, radio still has the power to break artists, so many of the names on the list hold positions in the industry's most influential radio and digital outlets. However, we also felt it was important to highlight the young DJs making a huge imprint on society and impacting the culture. Much respect and consideration was given to DJs who not only are holding their cities down, but taking the culture across the globe and into new important arenas. Thank you to the DJs named on this list for keeping hip-hop alive.\n\nWhile we couldn't fit everyone on the list, as it's aimed to represent who's moving right now, so shout outs are due for pioneers like DJ Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash, DJ Red Alert, Jam Master Jay, DJ Premier, DJ Jazzy Jeff, and Justo--look for them on a future list of All-Time Greats. For all other DJs that don't see your name on this list, you've got to come harder on the 1s and 2s in order to dethrone the current champs. Let the debate begin, as we present Top 30 DJ's in Hip-Hop (Right Now).\n\nDJ Square Biz\n\nTop 30 DJs In Hip-Hop Right Now\n\nDJ Square Biz\n\nDJ Square Biz has redefined breakfast with the explosive growth of his Grits & Biscuits Events nationwide. If you've been to one of the legendary rage ups in NYC, LA, or anywhere in between, you understand how much respect this Houston native commands when on stage and in the music industry.\n\nDJ Square Biz hosts the most talked about party series in the national hip-hop scene with his EZ Mo Breezy Camp. DJ Square Biz's events maintains a superb list of attendees, the creme-de-la-creme of whatever city or beachside resort he happens to be occupying at the moment, however everyone's allowed to be a lot more ratchet at these functions.\n\nWhile he has yet to release any popular mixtapes in the same vein as some of the other influential DJs on this list, he's ultimately hip-hop's festival DJ, holding it down at Jay-Z's \"Made in America.\" Also, DJ Square Biz is probably one of the most business savvy DJs on this list due to the immense and rapidly growing popularity of his live events, respect in the digital media world, and successful stint at ROC Nation.\n\nPhilly's Finest - DJ Diamond Kuts and Cosmic Kev\n\nTop 30 DJs In Hip-Hop Right Now\n\nDJ Diamond Kuts & Cosmic Kev\n\nIt's important to acknowledge Philadelphia as a city with an extremely rich musical history. The legacy of Gamble and Huff and the Philadelphia Soul Sound has helped shape the sound of popular music and its 2 leading DJs reflect a keen awareness of their city's musical roots.\n\nDJ Diamond Kuts of Power 99 could be considered the queen of East Coast DJs. Not many DJs have earned shoutouts from both President and First Lady Barack and Michelle Obama. A born leader, trailblazer, and one of the most important DJs in Philly, Diamond Kuts is heavily respected in the Baltimore club and Jersey club scene as well.\n\nDJ Cosmic Kev of Power 99 is one of the cultural ambassadors to Philadelphia as well. Earning a \"street banger\" tag from Cosmic Kev means a record is poised to, at the very least, win the hearts and minds of the streets.\n\nBoth these DJs have been at it a minute, and best believe that local stand-outs like Freeway, Meek Mill, and producer Jahlil Beats have greatly benefited from the support of these two iconic DJs at the city's leading station. Young DJs out of Philly like DJ Aktive and DJ Damage are also walking in the footsteps of the King and Queen of Philadelphia DJs.\n\nDJ Enuff\n\nTop 30 DJs In Hip-Hop Right Now\n\nDJ Enuff\n\nDJ Enuff needs no introduction. His presence in the Brooklyn streets as a youth attracted the attention of DJ Red Alert, who helped him get his start in hip-hop radio. When you get put on by DJ Red Alert, you're destined to be an all-time great. The man was Biggie's Tour DJ-- that alone should let hip-hop fans know how important the DJ Enuff legacy is to hip-hop. He helped break 50 Cent and Kanye West. Also, he is one of the biggest reasons 106 & Park became relevant, as his presence from 2003-2005 is an undeniable factor in the show's popularity, legitimacy, and growth.\n\nEnuff is more than a DJ, he is a leader of men and culture. Enuff doesn't just play or break records, he moves music, and helps shape the sound. He is the President and Founder of The Heavy Hitters, one of the largest and most influential DJ crews in America. Young DJs like DJ Wallah and DJ Drew Ski, that are affiliated with DJ Enuff, may attest to the legendary acumen and prowess of Brooklyn's finest DJ. His popular website thatsenuff.com is also a constant source of the latest and greatest in all things music and culture. In the words of Jadakiss, DJ Enuff is \"Top 5 dead or alive.\"\n\nPeep a very young J. Cole pour his soul for DJ Enuff. Enuff brings out the best in young artists in a way that other DJs can learn to emulate.\n\nDJ Clue\n\nTop 30 DJs In Hip-Hop Right Now\n\nDJ Clue\n\nIf you ask Jay-Z, Fabolous, Joe Budden, Cam'ron, or the late and great BIG Pun and Stack Bundles their opinion on DJ Clue, surely they might add that support from DJ Clue has helped them and so many more attain immense success. Clue didn't break records, he broke NY rap in the aftermath of the Death Row era. In addition, The Professional series defines one of the most heralded eras in New York's history, and his Hot 97 show, The Monday Night Mixtape, was vital to the development of the mixtape as a marketing tool.\n\nWhen you hear \"Cluemanatti\" you know it's the voice of the legend speaking. Clue will go down in history as one of the Godfathers of hip-hop. As a producer, his credits include classics such as Mariah Carey and Jay-Z's \"Heartbreaker\" in addition to Lil Mo and Fabolous on \"Superwoman Part 2.\" Recently, he gathered Future, Nicky Minaj, Juelz Santana, and French Montana for \"Rich Friday\", but he's been uniting the finest rappers in the world for decades.\n\nDJ Clue is another producer whose popularity transcends music. DJ Clue helped make Backstage so special, his presence cements the film as a hip-hop staple. DJ Clue is also an avid supporter of President Barack Obama, helping the President get re-elected in 2012 by lending his support on fundraisers and social causes. DJ Clue should know he's a living legend and one of the most important DJs in history.\n\nDJ Greg Street\n\nTop 30 DJs In Hip-Hop Right Now\n\nDJ Greg Street\n\nOver the last 20 years, Greg Street has become one of the most DJs in hip-hop. Greg Street has rocked the airwaves in Mississippi, Houston, Dallas, Alabama, and Atlanta, as a popular DJ on ATL-based Hip-Hop V103, an industry powerhouse. All across the South, DJ Greg Street is respected as leader and source of the latest & greatest in music.\n\nDJ Greg Street embodies the voice of the people. He truly is the people's DJ, and utilizes his platform to support some of the most important issues of our time. He is very active in charities, foundations, and social causes, and has created the Street Academy/Operation Correct Start in order to keep young men away from violence and the harsh realities of life in the streets. He's also quite well known for his incredible shoe collection and as a leader in Sneakerhead culture.\n\nDJ Prostyle\n\nTop 30 DJs In Hip-Hop Right Now\n\nDJ Prostyle\n\nDJ Prostyle has become a household name over the last decade. Perhaps you've seen him on ABC's Good Morning America. If not there, you've definitely seen DJ Prostyle on BET's 106 & Park and Rap City. New York has heard him on Power 105.1, and Orlando knows him well for his show on Power 95.3.\n\nDJ Prostyle has become the Derek Jeter of DJing. Few DJs could pull of a gig on a network television show as iconic as Good Morning America, especially after a 7-year run at 106 & Park. The sky is the limit for Prostyle, perhaps we'll see him run for office in the future-- he's already that popular. With over 1M+ followers on Twitter, DJ Prostyle has become a leading voice in social media.\n\nDJ Felli Fel\n\nTop 30 DJs In Hip-Hop Right Now\n\nDJ Felli Fel\n\nDJ Felli Fel is one of the biggest voices in the Golden State. As an A-list DJ at LA's Power 106, DJ Felli Fel hosts The Felli Fel show on Saturday evenings. By the way, the show is hilarious and Felli Fel looms larger than life even on the radio. He is a member of the Heavy Hitters DJs, a record producer, and also signed as a recording artist to So So Def/ Island Urban Music.\n\nDJ Felli Fel has worked with everybody-- Kanye West, Diddy, Akon, Lil Jon, to name a few. His film credits include a cameo in the 2003 comedy Malibu's Most wanted. This DJ is one of the most important men in the West Coast music scene, period, with the ability to break a hit record and constant support from the game's finest, DJ Felli Fel may continue to shine bright for quite some time.\n\nDJ Kayslay\n\nTop 30 DJs In Hip-Hop Right Now\n\nDJ Kayslay\n\nWARNING. The Drama King is in the building. DJ Kayslay is so legendary that in a recent interview on The Combat Jack Show, DJ Whoo Kid shared an epic story about avoiding drama with Kayslay on the streets of Harlem. The New York Times once referred to Kayslay as a \"one man ministry of insults.\" Kayslay means drama, but he also means one of the game's most respected titans and the voice of Uptown. Kayslay is the streets of Harlem, and there is no hip-hop without Harlem.\n\nIt's not hard to see why we'd have DJ Kayslay on the list of not just the top DJs in the game right now, but potentially an all-time list. The man was one of NYC's finest street artists. Hip-hop lives through street art, and Kay aka Dezzy Dez TFP from the legendary 1983 Style Wars had already made an impact on the culture before dropping siren after siren of straight heat, two StreetSweepers albums, and breaking records, freestyles, and giving us more drama than we knew was possible.\n\nDJ Cipha Sounds\n\nTop 30 DJs In Hip-Hop Right Now\n\nDJ Cipha Sounds\n\nWhenever hip-hop fans hear \"Cipha don't get gassed\", it's apparent that non-stop entertainment and hilarity will ensue. While he may be quite the jokester, he's very serious about his business and the art of entertaining others as a world-class DJ.\n\nDJ Cipha Sounds has evolved into more of an entertainer than most of the other DJs on this list. His numerous film/television and stage performances complement a stellar radio resume. To start, his radio experiences include hosting The Cipha Sounds Effect on Shade 45 from 2004-2008 along with Angela Yee, DJ Wonder, and the Emoticon. Perhaps he's also made you laugh or cry on The Hot 97 Morning Show, The Cipha/Rosenberg Experience, and 3 o'clock Boys! on Hot 97, replacing the legendary Angie Martinez.\n\nWhen it comes to breaking artists, he is noted as the DJ that introduced Rihanna, 50 Cent, Pitbull, Sean Paul, and Rick Ross to NYC radio. He has also served as tour DJ for Lil Kim, Mos Def, and Jay-Z. In the past, he's worked as an A&R for Tommy Boy, Rawkus Records, and Star Trak, as well as former Senior Vice-President of Jay-Z's Roc-La-Familia label.\n\nIn the television world, he was a DJ for The Chappelle Show for 3 seasons, as well as MTV's TRL and Direct Effect, which became Sucker Free. For a bit of movie history, he played DJ Dusk in Spike Lee's classic, 25th Hour. He also hosts Don't Get Gassed Comedy Series at the legendary Caroline's Comedy Club in Manhattan, a showcase in the mold of the irreplaceable Def Comedy Jam, after establishing Take It Personal Improv as well.\n\nDJ Camilo\n\nTop 30 DJs In Hip-Hop Right Now\n\nDJ Camilo\n\nDJ Camilo is hip-hop. Although he is the \"International Club King\", DJ Camilo still is New York. One of the most vibrant voices at Hot 97, not only does he keep an ear to the streets, but he is one of the most dominant DJs coming out of NYC ever. Camilo is also a member of the Heavy Hitters DJs. On top of that, he hosts two shows on Hot 97, including Heavy Hitter Hour and New at 2.\n\nDJ Camilo is more of a lifestyle DJ than others on this list. He partnered with Diddy and Ciroc Vodka to become one of the Ciroc Boys several years back. The world is DJ Camilo's oyster, and he's dishing pearls to anyone that tunes into his show or is privileged enough to see him perform live.\n\nDJ Clark Kent\n\nTop 30 DJs In Hip-Hop Right Now\n\nDJ Clark Kent\n\n\"God's Favorite DJ\", DJ Clark Kent, is a man of many wonders. He's produced some of the most well-known records in the history of the culture, including Junior M.A.F.I.A.'s featuring Biggie Smalls \"Player's Anthem\" and Mariah Carey's \"Loverboy\", as well as producing and recording legendary records for Jay-Z. His street cred is unquestionable, as he discovered Shyne rapping in a barbershop and directed him toward the Bad Boy Camp. He also is the founding member of the internationally respected \"Supermen\" DJ crew.\n\nDJ Clark Kent is a Brooklyn legend, and along with DJ Enuff, he has put Brooklyn on the map from a DJ perspective. To this day is keeping the thoroughest borough alive and popping. In addition, he is NYC's greatest DJ influencer in the Sneakerhead culture as well, and in 2010 Nike commissioned DJ Clark Kent to design a \"Nike Five Boroughs AF1 Low\" pack of special limited edition Air Force 1 sneakers. When you create NYC's official Air Forces, it's clear you've earned a special reputation in hip-hop and culture. Brooklyn stand up!\n\nDJ Wonder\n\nTop 30 DJs In Hip-Hop Right Now\n\nDJ Wonder\n\nDJ Wonder from Delaware (and later, NYC) is an international DJ Kingpin.

He resides in the top nightclubs and lounges in NYC and is a globally known tastemaker.\n\nDJ Suss-One\n\nTop 30 DJs In Hip-Hop Right Now\n\nDJ Suss-One\n\nFrom Jammin 94.5 in Boston to Power 105 in NYC, and around the globe, DJ Suss-One is a superstar DJ. He has earned the monicker The Feature Presentation by becoming one of the most important men on the East Coast, and NYC's Resident Headliner.\n\nDJ Suss-one regularly recruits the industry's elite for posse cuts, as rappers such as Flo Rida, French Montana, Jadakiss, Lloyd Banks, Joell Ortiz, and more have appeared on his records. He even got Floyd \"Money\" Mayweather to hop on the \"Champion\" track and speak a few words on the lifestyle.\n\nHoodrich ENT. - DJ Scream & DJ MLK\n\nTop 30 DJs In Hip-Hop Right Now\n\nHoodrich Ent- DJ Scream & DJ MLK\n\nIf you've heard \"Hoodrich\" before your favorite song, and chances are you have, then you have DJ Scream to thank for bringing you the latest and greatest in hip-hop.

Now, as a major part of the MMG movement, his Hunger Pains album is prime to expand his empire even more.\n\nDJ MLK out of Atlanta has been heating up the Southern scene for years. His mixtape series, GoodNight Don't Exist in Atlanta just released its 5th instalment this past August, and has been feeding the streets for quite some time now.\n\nHowever, hip-hop fans may know MLK best for being T.I.'s touring DJ, as seen on The Tonight Show and VH1 Storytellers. He's also credited for introducing Iggy Azalea to T.I. and known for being in tune with up-and-coming talent in Atlanta, as well as performing at top global venues.\n\nTony Touch\n\nTop 30 DJs In Hip-Hop Right Now\n\nTony Touch\n\nTony Touch is an original hip-hop B-boy break-dancer turned iconic DJ and MC. He is well-known for the classic mixtape series The 50 MCs 1-3, and his albums The Piece Makers 1-3. Tony Touch can hold his own as an rapper, but continues to gather hip-hop greats for prolific projects.

I'm not sure who else in the game can pull that many hip-hop heroes together for an album besides Tony Touch.\n\nEvery DJ's favorite song is his 2000 single “I Wonder Why” featuring Total, which is a timeless ode to his prowess as a DJ. He gathered an all-star cast for the music video, featuring cameos from legendary figures John Leguizamo, Rock Steady Crew, Grand Master Flash, The Awesome 2, Marley Marl, DJ Premier, and more--hence he's highly respected as a cut above the rest.\n\nStatik Selektah\n\nTop 30 DJs In Hip-Hop Right Now\n\nStatik Selektah\n\nStatik Selektah has become the stand-out DJ from Boston, holding the entire New England region down, with all due respect to DJ Big Mike in Connecticut.

The festival has brought out the likes of Meek Mill, Odd Future, and Schoolboy Q in recent years.\n\nRosenberg is not afraid to speak his mind, and everyone remembers 2012's Summer Jam controversy with Nicki Minaj. We are glad they've moved on, as Rosenberg is more than a firestarter--he is one of the most impactful, important, and busiest men in the business. His passion for the culture is apparent and admirable, and his willingness to be brutally honest proves the lengths he is willing to go in order to mold hip-hop in the way he desires.\n\nDJ Envy\n\nTop 30 DJs In Hip-Hop Right Now\n\nDJ Envy\n\nDJ Envy hosts the most influential hip-hop morning show in America (The Breakfast Club on Power 105.1 for those living under rocks), outside of Sway in the Morning and Peter Rosenberg's The Hot 97 Morning Show.

For a bit of hip-hop history, he broke Tupac's legendary \"Hit Em Up\".\n\nYou've seen him on BET's 106 & Park & Rap City, and MTV's This Week in Jams & Sucker Free Music Video Countdown, as well as Super Sweet 16s and celebrity & tastemaker events. DJ Envy has racked up Justo Mixtape awards and is known as one of the most accomplished mixtape DJs of his time. Now he's become a radio titan that shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nDJ Don Cannon\n\nTop 30 DJs In Hip-Hop Right Now\n\nDon Cannon\n\nDon Cannon probably doesn't sleep much. As a Grammy-award nominated platinum-selling producer, this Philly-native turned ATLien is in rarified company. He was once named Atlanta's best DJ by the popular Atlanta TV show \"Good Day Atlanta\" and has produced music for the major sports teams of the city including the Thrashers and Hawks. He also produced the theme song for \"Meet The Paynes\" on TBS.\n\nIn 2013, he was named Vice-President of A&R at Def Jam.

He routinely articulates intelligent and thought-provoking commentary, in addition to hosting A-list events and being one of the most in demand DJs on earth. Production credits include Jeezy, Curren$y, and Big Sean, among others.\n\nDon Cannon is as important as a DJ, executive, and trendsetter for hip-hop audiences as any other on this list.\n\nLA Leakers - DJ Sour Milk and Justin Credible\n\nTop 30 DJs In Hip-Hop Right Now\n\nThe LA Leakers\n\nThe DJ Collective known as the LA Leakers includes Power 106 DJs; DJ Sour Milk, Justin Credible, Mando Fresko, and Ryan Deelon (Hot 104.7 Maine). The LA Leakers are a hip-hop institution, a leading source of new music, and #Liftoff has become a proving ground for the most gifted artists in the industry. DJ Sour Milk and Justin Credible are hosts on Power 106 and Shade 45, while Mando Fresko holds it down at Power 106 as well as MTV2.\n\nIn particular, DJ Sour Milk and Justin Credible are two of the most important DJs on the national scene. Sour Milk has collaborated with Kanye West and Jay-Z to name a few, and hosted mixtapes for the likes of Nas and Common. Justin Credible is also the Imaging Director at Power 106.\n\nPerhaps the strength of their immense reach is accentuated by Los Angeles being the center of the hip-hop universe right now. With so many records coming out of LA, this circle's endorsement means a track is poised to reach a massive market, thus these LA Leakers are as important as any in shaping the landscape of hip-hop. They also frequently provide us with dope freestyles from some of our favorite rappers who stop by their show daily.\n\nFunkmaster Flex\n\nTop 30 DJs In Hip-Hop Right Now\n\nFunkmaster Flex\n\nFunkmaster Flex is one of the all-time most influential DJs in hip-hop. Every rapper in NYC has dreamed of Flex dropping bombs to his or her bars, and he has helped build Hot 97 into the mega-station it is today. Flex has been instrumental in developing the NYC scene, starting out as a DJ in local clubs at the age of 16. The Mix Tape series of the 1990s helped make mixtapes relevant in the way they are today. Flex DJd so many of the classic parties and venues in NYC and the world that he is partially responsible for the bottle-popping nightclub culture that originated in NYC's legendary Tunnel nightclub.\n\nWe could write an entire feature on why Flex may be the greatest DJ of all time. Suffice it to say, with the popularity of his car shows, Inflexwetrust.com, appearances on every hip-hop show since Yo! MTV Raps, a popular app, characters in video games such as Grand Theft Auto IV, Def Jam Vendetta, and NFL 2K5, Flex is a brand unlike any other DJs.\n\nDJ Whoo Kid\n\nTop 30 DJs In Hip-Hop Right Now\n\nDJ Whoo Kid\n\nDJ Whoo Kid aka The Haitian Prince, first became an international icon with the success of classic G-Unit mixtapes, G-Unit Radio. DJ Whoo Kid's rise has reflected one of the most relentless work ethics and forward thinking of any DJ on the list.\n\nAlthough the Queens native is widely known for being G-Unit's DJ and the go-to mixtape host for East Coast artists, Whoo Kid has become a global tastemaker and celebrity in a way that even leading DJs must respect. He has hosted mixtapes for a 'who's who' (no pun intended) list of rappers, from Snoop Dogg and Nipsey Hussle on the West, to Tinie Tempah overseas. In addition, Whoo Kid hosts the wildly popular and hilariously entertaining Whoolywood Shuffle on Shade 45, where he attracts top names in not just hip-hop, but culture in general.

He also manages one of the hottest rappers, Kid Ink, and has helped mold the careers of several current superstars (when they weren't yet at superstar status) through his relentless mixtape-hosting.\n\nWho in LA can forget when YG dropped Just Re'd Up hosted by DJ Ill Will along with DJ Mustard? That mixtape helped change the sound of hip-hop and put LA back on the map in a big way.\n\nDJ Ill Will is also one of the most astute businessmen in the game. Ill Will has dropped some of the industries most popular mixtapes the last couple years teaming up with rap and r'n'b stars alike, such as Tyga, Chris Brown, Meek Mill,Wiz Khalifa, Kid Ink, YG, Gudda Gudda, Bow Wow, Trina, Ace Hood, Kendrick Lamar, Schoolboy Q, Trey Songz & Drake. To name a few.\n\nDJ Skee\n\nTop 30 DJs In Hip-Hop Right Now\n\nDJ Skee\n\nDJ Skee is not only an in demand performer, playing worldwide with some of the biggest names in the industry, but he's also steadily building a business empire second to none. He may be the most entrepreneurial DJ on earth. Perhaps you've seen him on both Billboard and Forbes \"30 Under 30 List\". Born in NYC, raised in Saint Paul, Minnesota and now based in L.A., he's also a music/video producer, television host, and has worked as a radio personality on L.A.'s KIIS-FM and Sirius XM Satellite Radio until he recently announced that \"radio sucks\" and created his own digital radio station, DASH Radio.\n\nAs a mixtape DJ & producer, Skee has released over 100 mixtapes during his career. In 2008, he was nominated in eight categories, twice as much as any other DJ, at Justo’s Mixtape Awards.

As the head honcho at Fool's Gold Record label, he leads one of the most influential independent labels in the business, helping propel the careers of Kid Cudi and Danny Brown, and working with the likes of super-producers Just Blaze, Chad Hugo, and Lex Luger. With his label Fool's Gold, A-Trak is also bridging the gap between hip-hop and EDM.\n\nDefinitely do not sleep on A-Trak's competitive DJing skills. Prior to building an empire at Fool's Gold, A-Trak was the first DJ to win all three major DJ competition titles, DMC, ITF, and Vestax. He was the youngest DJ to win five World Championships, and at 15, the youngest to ever win DMC. His older brother David is also a member of the international music group Chromeo.\n\nA-Trak became popular to the masses as the personal tour DJ for Kanye West, and has performed with Mr. West at the Grammys, several MTV VMAs, and in international stadium appearances as well on Late Registration and Graduation, helping guide the sound and direction of the latter album.\n\nMore recently, he teamed up with Lex Luger for a collaborative group called Low Pros (they released a mixtape of the same name), which fused hip-hop and EDM.\n\nDJ Mustard\n\nTop 30 DJs In Hip-Hop Right Now\n\nDJ Mustard\n\nWhen Jay-Z lets you throw up that ROC Diamond, it's proof that you must be doing something extraordinary. DJ Mustard is shaping the sound of world music. The Pushaz Ink-affiliated and now ROC Nation DJ is responsible for crafting the sound to the majority of what you hear on American urban radio. DJ Mustard has transitioned from being the voice of the LA streets to being the most influential hitmakers in the business.\n\nWe're living in the DJ Mustard era. Mustard sculpted the sound of his city for global audiences, and brought LA to heights it hadn't seen since the Death Row era. He recently won the 2014 BET Awards for DJ of the Year, Producer of the Year Award, and MVP. With all due respect to everyone else, perhaps we haven't seen a West Coast Producer completely dominate the entire American cultural landscape this much since Dr. Dre (and that's not to compare the two's sounds).\n\nDJ Mustard has also helped propel the careers of his musical brothers Ty Dolla $ign and YG. His production has also helped artists like Tyga become a household name. Many West Coast artists, while undoubtedly talented on their own, have greatly benefitted from having DJ Mustard's prowess and consistency. DJ Mustard is the most influential producer in hip-hop at this very moment (just look at how many imitators he has), and for that reason has earned a spot on this list for however long he continues to excel and outperform.\n\nDJ Drama\n\nTop 30 DJs In Hip-Hop Right Now\n\nDJ Drama\n\nDJ Drama is undoubtedly one of the biggest and most well-known names in hip-hop. The ATL King is actually from Philadelphia, and was one of the creators of The Aphilliates. Drama got his start in the South as a student at Clark Atlanta University and hasn't let up as one of the most respected names in the city and industry.\n\nDrama is best known for hosting just about everybody's mixtape, and the classic mixtape series and album Gangsta Grillz. A DJ Drama co-sign means you're officially a part of (or at least, on your way) hip-hop's elite.\n\nPerhaps DJ Drama's Dedication series with Lil Wayne best chronicled the meteoric rise of both mega-superstars. The Dedication was one of the most heralded mixtape series of all-time. Especially in 2006 when The Dedication 2 dropped, every household, dorm room, street corner, barbershop, and record store that loves hip-hop was set ablaze. Fabolous, one of the most consistent rappers in hip-hop, delivered an all-star performance on the There is No Competition series as well. DJ Drama has a knack for bringing out the best in rappers.\n\nBarack Odrama recently joined the Atlantic Records team as A&R as well, and now has an even more powerful platform to break and develop talent coming out of Atlanta and the world. He is also developing the follow up to his 2012 album Quality Street Music, Quality Street Music 2, with the lead single \"Right Back.\"\n\nDJ Khaled\n\nTop 30 DJs In Hip-Hop Right Now\n\nDJ Khaled\n\nDJ Khaled's contribution to hip-hop can be summed up in three words, \"we the best.\" From his leadership at Def Jam South, to running an all-star record label, We The Best Music Group, it's clear that DJ Khaled is one of the best influencers in music. It's hard to understand where the Miami sound would be without Khaled pushing artists like Rick Ross and others.\n\nIf Khaled stops DJing tomorrow, he will still go down as one of the most astute DJs of all-time. The DJ Khaled era has brought the biggest rappers of the world together for epic records, introducing the mega-posse cut to new audiences. Khaled gave us new classics, such as 2007s \"I'm So Hood\", and promises more every day as he develops I Changed A lot.\n\nThe Miami-based DJ not only is a radio host for WEDR, but has undeniably helped put Miami at the forefront of hip-hop. He frequently collaborates with The Bawse Ricky Rozay, has long been affiliated with The Terror Squad, worked with everyone who's anyone in this business, and has helped We The Best Music Group artists such as Ace Hood, Mavado, and Vado attain greater success."
