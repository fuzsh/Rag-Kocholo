For other uses of the term \"mustard\", see Mustard.\n\nDijon Isaiah McFarlane (born June 5, 1990), known professionally as Mustard (formerly DJ Mustard), is an American record producer and DJ. A frequent collaborator of fellow California-based artists YG and Ty Dolla Sign, he has produced several singles and albums for both rappers, as well as other prominent acts in hip hop and R&B. He first saw recognition for his work on Tyga's 2011 single \"Rack City\".\n\nQuick Facts Background information, Birth name ...\n\nClose\n\nMustard's production style has been described as up-tempo and club-oriented, but also rudimentary and melodic. Most of his productions begin or end with the producer tag \"Mustard on the beat, ho!\"—a voice sample of YG (who says it at the end of \"I'm Good\", one of their early collaborations)—and include heavy use of synthesizers, claps, and reverberated, repeated utterance of a \"hey!\" voice clip.[4] His work has been credited as influential in the sound of both mainstream and West Coast hip hop productions during the early-to-mid 2010s, a style he refers to as \"ratchet music\".[11]"
