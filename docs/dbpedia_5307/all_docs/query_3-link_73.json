        "text": "The full tracklisting is out for NBA 2K16. DJ Khaled, DJ Premier (nice!), and DJ Mustard helm the production. A few rockers appear in the soundtrack, like The Ramones and The Flaming Lips, but this is mostly a hip hop affair. Much respect for kicking things off with Gang Starr. Drake has recently come under fire for allegedly using a ghostwriter, but \"0 to 100\" is a nice record, I don't care who wrote it. And if anybody was going to get Jeru The Damaja on this joint, it was Premier. Nas takes top billing, though, with two tracks penned by him: \"Made You Look\" taking it back to '02, and \"Represent\" off Illmatic.\n\nListen to most of the soundtrack on Spotify, (44 songs, over 2.5 hours of music), though Spotify is missing the six custom tracks by Khaled, Premier, and Mustard, made specifically for NBA 2K16.\n\nDJ PREMIER PLAYLIST\n\nCustom Track: Papoose Prod.
