        "text": "It’s inevitable that we’ll have to get to a definition of “ratchet,” so let’s dispense with it quickly. To act ratchet is to act foolish, or trashy, to behave in a way that makes others shield their eyes. It is the opposite of decorous. There are plenty of places one can act ratchet — in the club, in the bedroom — but it’s always about behavior that’s dubious at best, that makes people point fingers in slack-jawed astonishment and discomfort.\n\nRatchet is exactly where Ty Dolla Sign lives, and happily at that. (There is ratchet music, too, the dominant sound of Los Angeles hip-hop. That’s also a place he lives. More on that later.) On his fantastic new mixtape “Beach House 2” — available for download at datpiff.com and livemixtapes.com — is a song called “Ratchet in My Benz,” a filthy number about cycles of deception and mistrust, a love song for these dubious times. He opens it creepily:\n\nShe got his name tatted on her\n\nShe texting me like, ‘Babe, come over’\n\nI lied and said I’m out of town\n\nI’m with my other bitch right now\n\nAvert your eyes. It’s ratchet everywhere, especially, by the time the chorus comes around, in Ty Dolla Sign’s back seat.\n\n“Ratchet in My Benz” is a lewd song, but also a lustrously beautiful one, full of dreamscape synthesizers and slow-rolling drums, like a sunrise on a robot-occupied planet. Ty Dolla Sign is a deadpan singer, barely impressed by the feats of seduction that make up the whole of his interest set, but via vocal effects he sounds both heroic and sensual.\n\nThis is a trick he pulls off steadily through this often mesmerizing mixtape, one of the most arresting and alluring-sounding releases of the year. The lyrics are spiteful and raw, and sometimes downright unpleasant. They’re also almost comically simple, emphasizing plain rhyme schemes and repetition.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
