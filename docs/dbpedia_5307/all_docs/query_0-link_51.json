        "text": "Wiz and Ty continue their torrid output\n\nBoth Wiz Khalifa and Ty Dolla $ign had huge 2014’s, what with Khalifa releasing two projects, one of them being his first ever #1 album, Blacc Hollywood, and Ty Dolla $ign dropping what may be his best mixtape to date, $ign Language, in addition to contributing to one of the year’s biggest hits, Chris Brown‘s “Loyal.” (Not to mention, each graced their own cover of The Source. Wiz Khalifa brought his jubilant smile to our Power 30 cover, and Ty Dolla $ign shared Man of the Year honors with his buddies DJ Mustard and YG).\n\nIn 2015, it doesn’t appear that the dynamic duo has any plans of letting up. Wiz Khalifa has been dropping loosie after loosie, and Ty Dolla $ign has dropped his newest single–which, in our opinion, has #1 written all over it–but Wiz just made a pretty interesting announcement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere you have it. March will bring you Talk About It In The Morning, Wiz Khalifa and Ty Dolla $ign’s joint EP, anchored by the project’s first single, “Post Up,” which you can listen to below.\n\n[soundcloud url=”https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/195055773″ params=”auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true” width=”100%” height=”450″ iframe=”true” /]"
