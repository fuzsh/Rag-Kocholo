        "text": "In 2013, DJ Mustard added on to the success of the 2012 double platinum single “Rack City,” which he produced for Tyga. Mustard signed with Jay Z’s Roc Nation imprint as an artist, and the label also manages him, an arrangement he hopes will help him achieving one of his goals.\n\n“I want to be my own DJ like Fatman Scoop and Lil Jon all in one…going on tours and rocking crowds by myself,” during an exclusive interview with HipHopDX at the “Respect the West” showcase, sponsored by adidas and Cashmere Agency. “It’s not on the EDM side. It’s my own thing. It’s some Hip Hop shit, because we don’t have no DJs like that. I don’t know why nobody’s doing it. I ain’t got right yet, but once I start, it’s gonna turn some shit up and everyone’s gonna start doing it.”\n\nMustard served as the featured DJ during Respect the West, which was held December 11 in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles native rose to prominence after work with YG and Tyga. In addition to continuing his relationship with the aforementioned artists, he’s added to his discography through work with Ty Dolla $ign, R. Kelly and others.\n\n“For me, 2013 was the biggest year of my life,” Mustard said. “I got my crossover records and now to be deejaying ‘Respect the West’ is all a blessing to me. I made a lot of money off [‘Rack City’]. I made it in YG’s room in Inglewood. I was living with YG, and I made it in a small-ass room in about 10 minutes. No bullshit.”\n\nMustard worked with will.i.am, Miley Cyrus, French Montana and Wiz Khalifa on “Feelin’ Myself,” RiFF RaFF’s “How To Be The Man” and T-Pain and B.o.B.’s “Up Down (Do This All Day).” He attributes the partnership with Roc Nation to a meeting of the minds with Jay Brown, the label’s co-founder and president. DJ Mustard said he had a vision for what a Hip Hop DJ should be, and that Roc Nation was willing to help him facilitate that vision.\n\nAdditional Reporting By Justin Hunte"
