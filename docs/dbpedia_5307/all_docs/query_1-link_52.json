        "text": "The latest episode of The FADER Uncovered Season 2, the series in which host Mark Ronson talks with the world’s most impactful musicians, is up now and available for download wherever you listen to podcasts. For the fifteenth episode of the podcast Mark is joined by Ty Dolla $ign. Together they revisit Ty's appearance on The FADER cover in 2014, written off the back of his cult Beach House mixtapes and before he dropped debut album Free TC.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSince that cover story Ty has established himself as an integral part to many great hip-hop and R&B tracks, lending his distinctive vocals to songs by Kanye West, Post Malone, and Megan Thee Stallion to name just a few. Ty casts his mind back to his early days hustling in New York before returning to his native LA and finding his musical crowd, including producer DJ Mustard and rapper YG. They discuss old school R&B and house influences, the keys to a successful collaboration, plus touring with Justin Timberlake and sharing stories about how nervous meeting Stevie Wonder made them both feel.\n\nBetween them, Ronson and Premier bring up lots of music across the episode, referencing their shared love of Patrice Rushen, the underrated group Sa-Ra, '90s house music, and much, much more. To make that all easier to navigate, we’ve dropped all the artists they namecheck into a massive 86-song playlist, which you can check out below.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Prisoner Wine Company is an official sponsor of UNCOVERED.
