        "text": "N.O.R.E. has kept things much quieter on the music end lately, but after dropping off his reunion track with Pharrell Williams last year, he's giving fans a remix to tide them over. The New York native delivers the remix to his latest record, “Uno Más,” which features Williams, Miguel, Wiz Khalifa and reggaeton artist J Alvarez, and dropped March 30.\n\nThe star-studded lineup offers up a fresh new take over the Hazardis Soundz-produced remix, and even features some vocals from Pharrell, Miguel and Alvarez.\n\nThe verses are handled by both N.O.R.E. and Wiz, with the first set of bars containing new lyrics from the Drink Champs host, who continues to boasts about his two-decade-long career.\n\n\"I'ma keep bragging on how I got here/20 year career it's always sincere,\" he rhymes. \"These dudes are just one hit wonders/You don't know who I am? Go ask your mothers.\"\n\nWiz kicks off the catchy second verse, where he gives a shout out to Pharrell and N.O.R.E., who deems as \"legendary\" alongside himself.\n\n\"Talking bout legendary, talk about me/Talk about P and they know N.O.R.E.,\" he spits. \"I play the game just like I been here before/Left the team now she ain't winning no more.\"\n\nIf you recall, this is the first time that Noreaga and Pharrell have come back together to make music since N.O.R.E.'s Student of the Game album from 2013. They have worked heavily together in the past throughout both of their lengthy careers, and even have a few hip-hop classic hits under their belts.\n\nTake a listen to the official remix for “Uno Más” below to hear what the star-studded lineup cooked up."
