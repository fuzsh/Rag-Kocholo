        "text": "Jim-E Stack\n\nJim-E Stack is a producer from San Francisco who, at only 22, has developed a signature sound of buzzing synthesizers and wobbly, hand-clapped tempos that lives somewhere on the grid between dance music and something too weird to move to. His music ping-pongs around in your brain in a manner that feels precocious for a self-taught artist his age, but it also recalls the chaotic pulse of the city he grew up in. He told us how the genre-mixing of both his childhood neighborhood and his iTunes playlist has shaped his outlook on art and life.\n\n—alex frank\n\nJim-E Stack: I grew up in San Francisco. Just right in the city—Inner Richmond, near Clements Street. My mom’s house is less than a block away from Golden Gate Park. San Francisco is different now: the tech bubble is just this huge bubble of redevelopment and gentrification. But growing up in the city [when I did] meant exposure to different cultures. Our area used to be heavily Chinese and Russian immigrants; I’ve never lived out in the suburbs, but I don’t think that exists there. It’s different now, because everyone from fucking Google lives there. And it’s too clean—it’s kind of this perfect little place. It’s good for the city, all that tech stuff, but it’s also losing so much of what makes it “it.”\n\nI started to play drums when I was 11. I was just listening to like Blink-182 and whatever an 11-year-old would listen to. In high school, I had a core group of friends I played music with and they were very much into San Francisco punk and garage kind of stuff. Those friends put me on to Hüsker Dü and rock-ish stuff, like Sonic Youth. But I think what was cool was that we listened to every kind of genre. Hanging out in the park and stuff on the weekends, kids would be listening to a Clash record and Lil Wayne back-to-back. Why would that be weird? I feel like any other generation—I don’t even know what there was in the ’80s, like hair metal?—you wouldn’t listen to two things back-to-back like that. Jim-E Stack is just an amalgamation of everything I like.\n\nI just started making beats on my friend’s computer after school, an older Mac, pirated my own software, and thought, Oh, I like doing this. I guess my beats were some collision of rap and grime, like a hip-hop instrumental and a grime instrumental—but just really, really terrible. I was doing whatever came into mind. That’s kind of the beauty of it: there was no vision whatsoever. It’s just trying to make some shit. What’s embarrassing about this generation is that I probably had some stupid-ass Myspace page for just making my beats in high school, and you can find it. I don’t have any regrets, but when you’re in that teen period, every year you move forward and then look back at yourself on Facebook, you think, God I was such an idiot. Every year of your life, the year before, you were such a dumbass.\n\nI’m in Brooklyn now, taking some classes, and I know there are artists that have some barn or whatever they work out of in upstate New York, but for me, so much of being creative is just having that urban environment to be inspired by. It’s kind of daunting knowing that some of these cities are getting more expensive—I guess it’s a worry in the back of my mind, just because there’s no way I could not live in the city. But that model of, get good grades in high school, get into college, get a good job, support a family—that model is gone. Especially when tuitions are so insane and there really aren’t the jobs out there that there used to be, it’s kind of up to you to figure your shit out for yourself and not just rely on this kind of societal norm of a life path. But I think that’s a blessing and a curse for ’90s babies—having to figure it out on your own is more stressful. But since college doesn’t guar-antee you shit anymore, you might as well do something you really care about. And I don’t know what else I could do in life except music."
