        "text": "When you have the ability to swoon and croon your way into a woman’s heart, you’re able to break down a multitude of barriers within a lady. That’s a power that even the great Christopher Reeves and Peter Parker lacked in their arsenal. While some R&B heartthrobs delve in, penning records to soothe the psyche of your everyday female, Taylor Gang’s Ty Dolla $ign reaches his female audience in a different way. He injects a dose of fun in every record, in hopes of making the party rock.\n\nWith a slew of bangers and a resume rapidly growing — he’s featured on tracks with Lupe Fiasco and Meek Mill so far this year — it’s not surprising why Ty’s bank account is oozing with dollar signs. While the ever so popular hip-hop adage “Mo Money, Mo Problems” is applicable to a majority of artists in the culture, the Los Angeles crooner has been too busy performing on late night shows for Jimmy Fallon, and celebrating the success of his recent EP, entitled Beach House, to even worry about the cons of the music industry.\n\nThe multi-faceted artist is another reason why Cali continues to stampede its way onto the game. With DJ Mustard’s infectious beats and TDE’s unstoppable momentum, in the eyes of Ty Dolla Sign, his state is clamoring its way as the hottest region in the music scene. Following releases from Kendrick, ScHoolboy Q, and most recently YG, Ty’s debut album Free TC is highly anticipated… thanks to singles like “Paranoid” and the growing “Or Nah”\n\nHe sat down with us to discuss his relationship with super producer DJ Mustard, Drake’s decision to jump on “Or Nah,” his top five Cali artists, and how to remain paranoid free in a relationship.\n\nWe know that you’re a talented dude and that you play various instruments growing up, right?\n\nYes sir. I’ve always played a lot of instruments. I started off with the drums, then bass, then guitar, and then the keys. Then I got into making beats and DJ’ing and all that stuff, you know? I’m pretty fluent with basically every instrument, except like the bass and horns and stuff like that. I could even get down on the piano a little bit, you feel me? (Laughs)\n\nThat’s dope. Do you have a particular favorite instrument?\n\nNah. I just like making full songs. Like, from everything, like to the drums, all the way to the melodies, to the vocals, I like doing the whole thing. I like seeing the whole thing come to life and then going out and performing the [songs] people dance to, you know?\n\nI hear you. You’re a singer, producer, and songwriter. Which of the three do you have more enjoyment in doing?\n\nUmmm. Ahhh, all of it. Like I said, it’s the whole process. You know, all the way from the verse, to the first word of the song, to maybe the first melody of the song and then hearing a whole crowd room full of people sing it. It’s just the whole process now. I’m in love with it all. And now, even past that, like going to each radio station and kicking it with the DJ, and going up to the schools talking to kids about it. It’s all about the different audiences you could get. So, everything is fine to me. I just love doing it — the whole process.\n\nYou had the “My Cabana” track with Jeezy in 2012. Right now you have “Paranoid” with DJ Mustard, and “Or Nah” with Wiz. How does it feel to have major co-signs backing you like Wiz and Jeezy, among other notable peers?\n\nMan, it feels good man to know that my peers flex with my music and I can consider Wiz as fam. That’s crazy. Like, people like Jeezy would text me and I used to listen to his stuff for years. To have him even want to hop on one of my tracks is incredible to me. You know, seeing Mustard’s whole growth, that was like he was YG’s DJ and I was making all of YG’s beats. He kept watching me make beats and was like one day, “Tell me how this sounds.” His whole start to where he is now is crazy because it’s only been three years dog. And, he didn’t even make beats back then, like when we first started off and we made “Toot It and Boot It.” Now, he’s like taking over the whole country, you feel me? So, that’s incredible too. This whole experience is like “Wow (laughs).\n\nWhat’s the best piece of advice Wiz or any industry vet gave you coming up?\n\nWiz’s best advice was for me doing shows. It was try to do something that’ll make the crowd make noise rather than telling them, “Everybody make some noise!”, you know what I’m saying? I was like, “Ok! That’s some real [stuff].” Like you’ll hear every rapper, R&B singer, or entertainer be like, “Everybody make some f*cking noise!” Like, let your music do that for you. (Laughs) Like you’ll see somebody do some amazing sh*t, and that’ll be such a better feeling as an artist, you know?\n\nIf you had to give us your top five Cali artists right now, who would you choose and why?\n\nI’m gonna give you Kendrick. He’s the best lyricist. I’m gonna give you YG. I’m gonna give you Schoolboy Q. His album is incredible. Joe Moses, he’s also one of the most incredible dudes out there. He got the streets on lock. And then, myself, you already know.\n\nBecause you have the hit single “Paranoid”, for the lovers out there, how would you recommend the best ways in eliminating paranoia in a relationship?\n\nI think everything sums up to one thing and that’s telling the truth — keeping it real and keeping it 100. There’s like five different ways you can say that. If you go around and tell two to three girls that you love them or you’re in love with them or if you let a girl stay over and start cooking for you, washing your dishes or doing all your [things] for you, of course she’s going to think that you’re something. And, that’s where a lot of dudes mess up. When I wrote that song, I thought it was going down. But, it didn’t because I haven’t been lying. I’ve been keeping it all the way 100. I’ve been like “Yo, listen… I’m not trying to do no relationship type [stuff]. We can kick it. We can have sex. We can eat sometimes. But, I don’t need you to do none of my [things] for me. I got this by myself. I’m a grown ass man.”\n\nIn addition to Paranoid, you have your single “Or Nah”, which received the remix treatment and is set to have Drake, Weeknd, and Wiz Khalifa. Talk about how that remix came together.\n\nDrake hit me the other day, and was like, “Yo man, ‘Or Nah’ is incredible.” I was like, “Man!” I had some records I tried to get him to hop on, and he was like, “Yeah. I’m going to take a listen.” I guess he was in France or somewhere. The next day he texted me like, “Yo… this ‘Or Nah’ is haunting me dog.” I was like, “F*ck it, let’s make the official remix.” He was like, “Fo’ sho.” So, the next day he texted me like, “Yo man, I just spazzed on ‘Or Nah’.” I haven’t heard it personally, but I already know he’s going to destroy that [track]. I’m excited.\n\nThat’s going to be crazy. I know the fans can’t wait to hear it.\n\nOh yeah, me, Wiz, Drake, Weeknd, all on one song with Mustard? That’s gonna be like WHOA! (Laughs)\n\nWord is that you already started working on your debut album. What can fans expect?\n\nYeah man. I probably have like eight songs already for it. I think I’m going to keep it at 10. I’m probably gonna do some more or eliminate songs I already got for some better ones. But, I got eight definite murderers. Kendrick is on there so far. Of course, I’m gonna have DJ Mustard’s production and my production. I’m also trying to get Fergie on there from the Black Eyed Peas… hopefully. That’s the homie right there. I guess that’s it. That’s all I could talk about from the album standpoint, but it’s going to be amazing. It’s going to be called Free TC. It’s dedicated to my little bro and all the other homies locked up for [stuff] that they didn’t do and wrongly accused type [stuff]. So, I’m just trying to bring awareness to that. And it’s going to be crazy.\n\nLink.\n\nFor an artist who didn’t release an album in 2013, Wiz Khalifa doesn’t have to worry about catching up this year. While other rappers would have languidly taken the year off after getting married and having a child, Wiz singlehandedly ousted any ounce of doubt with memorable guest appearances. He teased fans with head bopping verses on Juicy J’s “Bounce It” Remix, teamed up with super extravagant producer Mike WiLL Made It in paying homage to the beloved Michael Jordan with their single “23,” and he even had time to have fun on Will I Am’s “Feelin’ Myself.” He upped the ante even more by collaborating with his old buddy Curren$y and delivered a joint EP entitled Live in Concert.\n\nWith an unimpeachable resume ranging from his classic mixtape Kush and Orange Juice to his major label debutRolling Papers eclipsing the 500,000 mark; Wiz has cemented himself among the upper echelon of hip-hop. He continued to steamroll his way into mainstream prominence by churning out hits on his sophomore endeavor ONIFCwith songs like “Work Hard, Play Hard,” and “Remember You.” While many artists struggle with relevancy and sustaining the juice needed to survive, Wiz is sailing just fine. Even though he already has five top 10 records under his belt, Wiz Khalifa is still cultivating ways to shift the culture with his third album Blacc Hollywood – slated for next year.\n\nNow that 2013 is winding down, an ardent and rejuvenated Wiz reveals to Pepsi Pulse why his album Blacc Hollywood will be his best project to date, what makes Miley Cyrus dope, experimentation with EDM, regaining his passion for music, and why he dreams of doing of a collaborative EP with the late James Brown.\n\nYou went from mixtape artist, to XXL freshman, to now being a mainstream superstar. How has that transition been for you?\n\nIt’s been really good. It’s definitely been like a journey, you know what I’m sayin’? As far as just knowing where I came from and knowing the possibilities of where to go and not being scared to really take it there and not letting certain limitations not hold me back. [Also], just being really responsible as an artist to take it to that next level and just be the best.\n\nThis year, you’ve been having a lot of fun doing features as you’ve been featured on tracks with Jhene Aiko, Juicy J, Miley Cyrus and more. Which track or verse that you’ve done this year would you label as your favorite and why?\n\nHonestly I’ve enjoyed all of them because they’re all unique and all special. Each experience was like – you know – something where I kind of went out of my way and was like, “Aight. I’m gonna do this. I’m gonna make sure that it lands and that it’s something that sticks.” You know, just the fact that people are excited about it and that I’m all over the place and I’m able to go different places and be around different people who hear my song or hear me with different people is amazing.\n\nHas your mentality and outlook towards music changed since you’ve become a husband and a father?\n\nNah. I wouldn’t say my mentality changed. If anything, being a father helped me go back to my original inspirations and what really really made me fall in love with music. You know, music is really important to a baby as well. I just always make sure I’m playing music in the house or I’m working on my music. You know, kids love singing songs, so I sing to my son all the time. It’s weird but it helps me write music. Everything is really rejuvenating [my love for music]. I’m kind of taking a newer and younger approach to it even though I’m already young. I’ve been rejuvenated by my son.\n\nSo would you say for your new album Blacc Hollywood that you’re taking a deeper and more introspective approach because of these things you just mentioned?\n\nI wouldn’t say it’s deeper. I’m in the process of creating a lot of it right now. I’m in different zones. So one day I might feel like this and another day I might feel like that. But in general, the album is really fun and anthemic to the point where any song that you turn on, it’ll be that anthem to that point in your life. It’s a whole lot of swag, a whole lot of lyricism, a whole lot of wittiness and cleverness that people really know me for and just making my stamp that people always expect from me.\n\nLooking back at your last album OFINC now, would you have made any substantial changes production wise or song wise or do you feel it was perfect the way it came out?\n\nI would have done the album exactly the way that I did just because you never really know what you can get until you tried to do a more conceptual album or more self-contained album that you believe in or something that you’re really comfortable making at that time. Me as an artist, when I was working on ONIFC, I wasn’t really listening to too much radio. There weren’t really too much outside influences, so that was just a reflection of me and where I was at that time. So I’m 100% happy with it. And moving forward, the new people that I meet and the new methods that I learn, that’s what’s going to be expressed in my most recent music.\n\nExplain your working relationship with Miley Cyrus because a lot of people were originally thrown off by the collaboration and the correlation between you two musically. What made you decide to work with her?\n\nIt’s cool because we’re super like-minded in a sense that we don’t care about what people think. You know what I mean? She’s from the country and that’s not where I’m from but her energy is insane. She puts that out there to the world. I’m a rapper, but I have a family. I’m from Pittsburgh, and my methods aren’t really known or accepted. People embrace me for who I am. So just having that kindred spirit, that’s what brings us together. And, on top of that, she’s super-duper talented man. She can sing her butt off. She can write and she has great ideas. So you can’t hold that type of person back. You know, I think when we get together we just bring the best out of each other.\n\nOutside of Hip-Hop, while working on your new album Blacc Hollywood, have you found inspirations in other genres or from any artists in particular?\n\nWell I’ve been looking at all the different scenes and seeing everybody who’s coming up and seeing who’s been popping in the EDM scene. The EDM scene is definitely an influence because I love to party and that’s what kids are partying to. So just to see people getting so excited about a genre of music or a certain handful of artists who control the music whether it’s like Afrojack or Steve Aoki or whoever it is. Or even underground cats. My little sister, she be putting me on all them dudes.\n\nMan, it’s just exciting to see brand new work come out and me not really know about it but start to learn about it. I feel like an old man and that kind of like rejuvenates me as well because coming up from being a teen, I was so used to being ahead of the curve and on top of everything brand new. Now I got my little sister and brother in law and they have been really showing me what’s popping and what’s brand new. So that’s what keeps me going as well.\n\nAside from yourself, who do you think will have the best album of 2014 and why?\n\nOh I’m going to have the best album for sure. I’m going to have the best album and the most impactful album of 2014.\n\nAre you saying this album is going to trump OFINC and Rolling Papers?\n\nDefinitely, definitely. It’s going to be better than Kush and Orange Juice.\n\nWow. That’s a bold statement right there. (Laughs)\n\nYeah I mean a lot of people think it’s hard to top your first initial burst onto the scene classic. But with so many expectations, so much love, and so much support for the movement, it’ll only make it better. It’ll only make the buildup more of an event. So I could use that as an advantage and just kill it.\n\nYou’ve worked with a number of artists of different genres, so I pose you this question: If you can choose one person to do an EP with –it could be anybody – who would it be and why?\n\nJames Brown.\n\nLink"
