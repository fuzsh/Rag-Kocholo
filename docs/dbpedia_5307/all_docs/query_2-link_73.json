        "text": "If you missed my post from yesterday on my favorite songs on the year, be sure to check it out as well. Like I wrote yesterday, 2015 was such a strong year for music and there were a bunch of great albums from different artists. It was difficult to whittle it down to what my favorites were, but after a lot of deliberation (with myself), I put this list together. I hope you enjoy. And without further ado….\n\nNumber 10:\n\nThe Weeknd: Beauty Behind the Madness\n\nFavorite Tracks: Tell Your Friends, Shameless, Acquainted\n\nSince bursting on the scene in 2011 with House of Balloons, it’s been a steady rise for The Weeknd. He became a full fledged superstar this year with Beauty Behind the Madness, his album that definitely leans more pop friendly than previous releases, thanks to his work with superproducer Max Martin. Hits like ” The Hills” and “Can’t Feel My Face” dominated pop radio, and did a great job of crossing him over while staying true to himself. The first half of the album is stellar, with tracks like opener “Real Life” and “Tell Your Friends” finding the perfect balance between showcasing Abel’s vocal talent and wonderful instrumentation. (Kudos to Kanye and Mike especially for “Tell Your Friends”) There is a bit of a lag in the last half of the album-I wasn’t a big fan of the collaborative effort with Lana Del Rey “Prisoner”-but the album succeeds thanks to The Weeknd’s matter of fact lyrics and amazing voice. It will be interesting to see where he goes from here and dives further into the pop world, or heads in another direction. Either way, he’ll have a huge legion of followers behind him.\n\nNumber 9:\n\nJeezy: Church In These Streets\n\nFavorite Tracks: Just Win, Forgive Me, Church In These Streets\n\nYa can’t ban the Snowman, and you damn sure can’t stop him either. 10 years in mainstream wise and Jeezy still has the same ability to inspire and motivate. The intro “Grind State” has Jeezy open with (“I can count a million with a blindfold!”) and it’s an hour of classic Snowman from there. Songs like “Hustlaz Holiday” and “New Clothes” have Jeezy in the familiar territory of motivation behind why you need to keep working. And it’s that word: grind, that is still the overarching theme of the majority of his work. Jeezy isn’t a great rapper in a classic sense, but his unique voice, delivery, ad libs, and style set him apart from pretty much everybody else-and I have loved it for a decade now. He is still finding ways to encourage you to work hard (“You wanna prove em all wrong in the end? Just win my n—a just win”) and his Pastor Young nickname is well earned. Tracks like “Forgive Me” illustrate Jeezy coming to terms with his shortcomings as a friend and brother (“You asked me to help with your wedding, argument in front of your kids, hurt me to this very day, lamest shit I ever did”), yet through his voice, you can tell he has made peace with all that has a happened. Heavy hitting beats from a who’s who of ATL producers (London on da Track, Zaytoven, Nard & B) and great work from small name producers (D Rich, Smurf) all comes together for my favorite Jeezy project this decade, though I loved TM 103 as well.\n\nNumber 8:\n\nTinashe: Amethyst\n\nFavorite Tracks: Worth It, Wanderer, Wrong\n\nClocking in at a little over 27 minutes, this is easily the shortest album on the list. But Tinashe’s mixtape follow up to last year’s Aquarius is just as excellent as her album. All co produced by Tinashe, with chip ins from DJ Dahi, Iamsu!, and her frequent collaborator Legacy (from the New Boyz!), the instrumentals on here are lush and just so pleasant to listen to. “Worth It“, her track with Iamsu! is the highlight for me as the song talks about a rocky relationship but that through all the problems, Tinashe says (“You’re worth it, you’re worth it, you make it all worth it baby”). The songs are here differ from her debut album by having her sing about heartbreak and relationship failings-such as “Something To Feel”, as opposed to the (mostly) upbeat Aquarius. Although she doesn’t have the most booming voice, Tinashe always does a great job of finding sounds that complement her voice really well, and that is the case here-such as the opener “Dreams Are Real.” The short running time keeps things moving along briskly, and does exactly its job as the tape serves as a perfect stopgap between Aquarius and Tinashe’s next album Joyride.\n\nNumber 7:\n\nFuture: Dirty Sprite 2\n\nFavorite Tracks: The Percocet & Stripper Joint, Thought It Was a Drought, Slave Master\n\nFuture has a legitimate claim to being the MVP of 2015. Following a torrid 3 mixtape run starting last fall with Monster, following with Beast Mode and then 56 Nights, expectations were sky high for DS2. Lo and behold, Future Hendrix delivered. For an hour, with the exception of Drake on “Where Ya At”, it’s just Future and trap beats, provided by Metro Boomin, Southside and others. There was probably no better opener this year than “Thought It Was a Drought”, with Future starting the album off with the instantly memorable (“I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops”). This is a dark and moody album though, as Future details his drug use and the missteps of his last album Honest, such as on “I Serve The Base”, (“Tryna make a pop star and they made a monster”) This being Future, we have huge and catchy hooks, like on the Drake assisted “Where Ya At” and “Rich $ex”, but nothing as ridiculous/absurd as “Slave Master”, where Future uses the word as a double meaning. Future’s had knack for hooks since “Racks” (maybe my favorite song this decade), but he’s just gotten better and better at writing verses-which he already was good at-and understanding his own limitations. It’s interesting because last year the worry was that Future had opened this wave for artists, mostly from Atlanta, but that he was getting overshadowed and pushed out. Now he is unquestionably the biggest star out of Atlanta right now and pushed himself into rap’s A list. DS2 is the culmination of Future’s run starting from Monster, and he deserves all the credit in the world.\n\nNumber 6:\n\nMiguel: Wildheart\n\nFavorite Tracks: Hollywood Dreams, Waves, gfg\n\nWildheart‘s greatness makes Miguel now 3 for 3 in my book on amazing studio albums. This album is definitely funkier than its predecessors, and that suits Miguel perfectly. Where this album differs from his previous is the pure sexuality of the album as well. While his albums have had sex songs like “Quickie” and “Use Me“, those seems like abstinence only education compared to tracks on here like “the valley” and “FLESH.” Longtime collaborators Happy Perez and Fisticuffs provide great back drops for Miguel to do his thing, notably on “Waves.” His singing on the bridge in the last half of the track is excellent, (“Yeah get wild baby, so hot God damn I need a towel baby”). It’s his ability to shift his voice, from his outright singing to his slow almost rapping voice, like the beginning of “the valley.” There aren’t any songs here as pop friendly as “Adorn”, though “Simplethings” is as close as the record gets to making a pop record in my mind. I think this might be his most complete album of the three, and although I don’t think it quite reaches the highs of Kaleidoscope Dream and All I Want Is You, it’s a much more consistent record and brings out the best in every song. Commercially it didn’t do as well as the last two, but that means nothing here, especially when it seems as though the album didn’t get as much promotion as Kaleidoscope did. Either way, Miguel keeps cranking out incredibly interesting, funky R&B, and I’ll keep listening for whatever is next from him.\n\nNumber 5:\n\nTy Dolla $ign: Free TC\n\nFavorite Songs: LA, Saved, Sittin Pretty\n\nI had been waiting for this album since I first had heard of Dolla $ign, back on “Toot It & Boot It” with YG in 2010. And through his mixtapes and singles since then, I still wanted to hear his proper debut album. Suffice to say, Free TC lived up to expectations. The most diverse album sonically outside of Kendrick’s on this list, Ty can literally make any type of song he wants to. If he wants to do an acoustic, country sounding song, he’s got that covered with “Solid“-a great collab with Babyface. If he wants to do EDM, there’s “Bring It Out Of Me,” produced by hitmakers Stargate. All through the different styles of sounds, Ty always makes sure to make it his own, rather then him trying to force himself into it. The emotional center of the album though, his phone conversations with his brother TC, is what really makes the album. TC is currently serving a life sentence, and though that weighs on the listener as you hear the skits, it’s the jokes and conversations about day to day life that are great. When informing Ty that the prison is on lockdown so they can’t shower or have food, TC jokes (“We got muscles though-still got muscles though”). That leads into the song featuring TC singing from prison, “Miracle/Wherever”, which is probably the best song off the album. Dolla $ign is like Game though where he is always able to bring the best out of his guests, most notably here with Wiz Khalifa on “Sittin Pretty” and Trey Songz on “Know Ya.” The single “Saved”-which is an update on “Captain Save a Hoe”, is produced by DJ Mustard and absolute fire, and features the timeless E40 himself spitting classic E40 lines such as (“I ain’t rescue Ronnie, I ain’t Captain-Save-A-Thot!”). Bottom line is that the whole album is a success. Dolla $ign pushed himself really hard creatively-and it paid off. Well done.\n\nNumber 4:\n\nDr. Dre: Compton\n\nFavorite Songs: For the Love of Money, Just Another Day, Animals\n\nWe knew coming into 2015 that we were getting the NWA biopic, Straight Outta Compton. What we didn’t know was that we were getting a new Dr. Dre album, and that it wasn’t Detox! Declaring that project not up to par for his own standard, Dre released Compton just a short while after announcing that it was to be released. Truth be told, I was terrified the album would be a major letdown, especially in comparison to The Chronic and 2001. It’s not as great as either of those albums, but that’s no slight to Compton, it’s just that Doc’s previous two are some of the best albums-of any genre-of the last 25 years. And though the newcomers on Compton probably won’t match Snoop or Eminem in popularity, artists like King Mez and Jon Connor handle themselves well on the records they are on. If there is going to be a star born off this album, it will Anderson .Paak-who is incredible on the socially conscious “Animals,” a great track that sees two legends on the producer Mt. Rushmore in Dre and DJ Premier come together. Paak’s voice is equal parts pleading and demanding-it’s really a job well done. (“And please don’t come around these parts-and tell me that we’re all a bunch of animals”) The rest of the album finds friends from Dre’s past (Cube, Snoop, Em) and present (Kendrick, Game) all bringing their A game to the table. Snoop himself sounds more fired up then I had heard him in years on the two tracks he is featured on, “One Shot One Kill” and “Satisfiction.” The same can be said for Game on “Just Another Day“, where he delivers a verse he’s probably waited his entire life to do-to say he killed it on a track on Dr. Dre album. If this is the swan song for the Good Doctor, then what a hell of a note to go out on. His finale, “Talking to My Diary”, seems like farewell.From the NWA days, to Death Row, to Aftermath, to the present day, Dre has always best top of the line, and he is no different here.\n\nNumber 3:\n\nKendrick Lamar: To Pimp a Butterfly\n\nFavorite Tracks: Momma, Hood Politics, Wesley’s Theory, U\n\nIf I was recapping what I thought the BEST albums of 2015 were, To Pimp a Butterfly would be easily head and shoulders above everybody. It’s not as if I don’t love this album (I do), it’s the top two I loved a little bit more. Kendrick though pushed himself harder than pretty much any other artist that is currently out. Butterfly is a heavy, difficult album, and confronts a lot of ugliness that is pervasive in culture today. America’s obsession with material possessions, race, sexuality, are just some of the topics that Kendrick covers over 79 minutes of music. It makes sense that following the records release, Kendrick said was therapeutic for him to make, as you can tell he himself is sorting through feelings and beliefs. And I understand too from the angle of it helping get through his depression, because songs like “i” do make you feel good about yourself, and saying “I love myself” in a chorus does bring relief. The flip side of “i”, “u” is the most honest song I heard all year, where Kendrick has the hook of (“Loving u is complicated, loving u is complicated”) while he faces all his inner demons and insecurities. He talks about being a poor older brother by letting his sister get pregnant, he’s a poor friend by not visiting a friend in the hospital, and he’s a poor leader because he left “Compton for profit.” As soon as the song ends though, a 180 degree turn happens with “Alright”, which has been co-opted into chants and rallies for people protesting police brutality and systematic oppression. The musical backdrop through all of this is if you threw George Clinton (who’s on “Wesley’s Theory”), Jazz and Suga Free into a blender. This fusion of sounds is stark and exciting, and keeps the listener on their toes for the entire duration of listening. Kendrick made the most ambitious, daredevil album this year. This could have been an absolute trainwreck if it didn’t pan out properly, but with Kendrick-he always makes it work. He’s the best rapper in the game by a country mile, and luckily for us fans of the genre, he takes the most risks-be it musically or lyrically. It’s great to see him paid off with a Grammy leading 11 nominations, and hopefully is able to take home the biggest prize of them all, the album of the year.\n\nNumber 2:\n\nFetty Wap: Fetty Wap\n\nFavorite Tracks: How We Do Thangs, 679, Rock My Chain, Let It Bang…To be honest it pretty much could have been all of them\n\nWhat a 2015 for Fetty. The guy came out of Paterson, New Jersey, not a exactly a hot bed for hip hop, and did it without getting put on by a fellow artist or superproducer. That’s actually a major reason why I love this self titled debut so much. We as hip hop fans are always let down when an artist who is making noise in the mixtape game gets signed and releases a conventional album that waters down their sound to appeal to a commercial audience. Fetty went the other way and had no big names on the albums, either artist or producer wise. It’s just the Remy Boy crew, and his list of local producers who helped him get big. It’s telling that the version of “My Way” on the album is the original version with Monty and not the remixed version with Drake. It’s an unconventional album from the sense that Atlantic seems like they were completely hands off and let Fetty just do this thing-which is great for an artist with a debut album. There are hundreds of ad libs of “1738”, “Remy Boyzzzz”, “YEAH BABY” and references to Robin Jeans, but it all comes across as organic and spontaneous. The album spreads out well over an hour, and there is no letdown. It’s all about partying, his crew, his love, and making money. These aren’t new topics and Fetty isn’t reinventing the wheel lyrically, but his voice is just so damn hypnotizing. He’s even tongue-in-cheek with it on “Rock My Chain.” (“Zoovier’s known for saying ‘YEAH BABYYYY'”) M80’s featured verse on the song is classic, and he is only one of two other voices on the record. Monty is the other, and although some derided his performance on the album, I really like his features on the album, particularly on “Time.” The production on here is bouncy and synth heavy, and in tune with Fetty’s voice, it’s catchy as hell. Unknowns like Yung Lan, Peoples, and Lacemode provide Fetty with the sonic backing to make his voice just sound that much better. It’s all Fetty’s show though. He is a true superstar, who has a real gift for making happy, fun music. I love the guys voice, and the run he is on is like a combination of Nelly in the early 2000’s mixed with T-Pain in mid/late 2000’s. Fetty Wap is an awesome pop rap album, and no matter how long Fetty’s run lasts, he’ll always have this moment in time.\n\nNumber 1:\n\nBig Sean: Dark Sky Paradise\n\nFavorite Songs: Research, Blessings, Deserve It, Win Some Lose Some\n\nAfter the great year in music, I’m actually kind of surprised this ended up staying my favorite album by the end of the year. But Sean made my favorite front to back project of this entire year. You have great production here from the likes of DJ Mustard, Key Wane, Kanye, DJ Dahi, and others. Sean’s always been good with punch lines and ad libs, but his bars here are so much better than his earlier work. Songs like “Deep” (“If my back against the ropes then I’ll finish Stone Cold it”) and “Win Some Lose Some” (“Damn it you did it wrong, you got time for that gig but not time for the phone”) talk about his disappointment in Hall of Fame‘s lackluster reception from the public and losing touch with friends and family. These tracks, along with “One Man Can Change The World“, reveal a level of maturity that we really hadn’t seen from Sean before. He always could make bangers, and that is still true here with “I Don’t Fuck With You” and “Blessings“, but both bookends of the regular album of the version, “Dark Sky” and “Outro”, really showcase his growth. If you’re going to pick up the album, make sure to splurge for the deluxe version with the bonus tracks. I highlighted “Research” yesterday already, but “Deserve It” with PartyNextDoor is another gem as well. The executive production by Kanye is also to be commended here, especially with his feature on “All Your Fault” and the overall sonic sound on the majority of the album. Like I said though, I’m surprised that Big Sean of all people, in such an exceptional year, ended up having my favorite album. His earnestness and relatability are a big draw for me. This album clicked for me in a way that an album hadn’t done in awhile at the time of its release. And it’s only gotten more enjoyable the more I have listened to it. Sean found his groove and executed a great album that is equal parts catchy, but technically well done too. He was always a guy who’s music I enjoyed, but never really had too much substance to his music. With the different life experiences he’s had (falling in and out of love publicly multiple times, his grandma passing), he had a wealth of content to talk about in his music. Congrats to Big Sean for an incredible album, and thank you to everybody who dropped great music week after week this year. I can only hope 2016 comes even somewhat close to the same amount of quality.\n\n2015 is my favorite year of music in a long time. In all honesty, it might be my favorite year ever. In the moment, it felt like every week this year an artist was dropping a great project-be it an album, single,music video, etc. Time will tell how much these projects hold up in the long run, but at least for in the moment, 2015 was one to remember music-wise. With the wealth of quality material out this year, it seems right to count down both my personal favorite songs and albums of the year. Today we’ll start with the top songs, and tomorrow we’ll do albums.\n\nFAVORITE SONGS\n\nBefore we dive completely into my favorite song list, I want to acknowledge my favorite music video of the year. It’s “Gold Slugs” by DJ Khaled featuring Chris Brown, August Alsina & Fetty Wap, because of course. The intro is my favorite 30 seconds of any video all year, and mainly thanks to Khaled’s absurdity, the video was instantly memorable. Shots of Miami in late summer/early fall and the infomercial vibe for Khaled’s Finga Lickin restaurant (MIAMI GARDENS LOCATION!) were perfect for his lead single. I’m a sucker for shots of people riding around on motorbikes and ATVs, and there is plenty of that in the video as well. All hats off to DJ Khaled, the best person ever on Snapchat.\n\nNOTE: I didn’t include any songs released in 2014, as they weren’t technically released in 2015 (duh!). Had I included songs from 2014, E40’s “Choices”, Tove Lo’s “Talkin Body”, Miguel’s “Hollywood Dreams” and Omarion/Chris Brown/Jhene Aiko’s “Post To Be” would have been strong contenders for the top 10. And now without further ado…\n\nNumber 10:\n\nChris Brown/Tyga “Ayo”\n\nThe lead single from the tandem’s Fan of a Fan: The Album was the perfect kickoff to the year as it dropped in early January. While DJ Mustard has gotten the lion share of attention for West Coast producers the past few years, Nic Nac has been just as consistent dropping absolute bangers for hip hop and R&B artists. He delivers here again, while Chris smashes a perfect hook that easily gets stuck in your head. Tyga managed not to screw it all up, and what we have here is a great pop/R&B/hip hop song.\n\nNumber 9:\n\nBig Sean/Ariana Grande “Research”\n\nOh what could have been had this relationship just lasted a few months longer. This aborted single from Sean’s Dark Sky Paradise had hit written all over it, until the couple called it quits and Def Jam decided to release “One Man Can Change The World” instead. I like to think of this song as the 2015 male response to Mariah Carey’s 1999 hit “Heartbreaker”, which is perfect seeing as how Ariana has been compared to Carey since jumping into music. Great, funky production from DJ Dahi and Metro Boomin complemented Sean’s verses well, and Sean himself was in top form. Oh what could have been.\n\nNumber 8:\n\nShy Glizzy/Jeezy “Funeral Remix”\n\nIt was the most 2015 way ever for me finding out about this song. A popular vine of pall bearers dancing with a casket was set to this song, and I was hooked. KE On The Track, who has (allegedly) produced some hits in the past, gives Shy Glizzy and Jeezy a beautiful back drop of piano keys and a choir to rap over. Shy raps about how much living he is doing (“I’m all around the globe, just me and Benny”), and all he’s doing for his family, while Jeezy sets the scene for his own funeral, and how epic it’s going to be (“You might see God at my funeral!”) For a song titled “Funeral”, it was the most lively song of the year.\n\nNumber 7\n\nKanye West “All Day”\n\nWhen you look at song credits and see something eye popping like 9 co-producers and 13(!) co-writers, you assume the song is going to be an over produced, bloated mess. And in the hands of anybody besides Kanye, that’d probably be the correct assessment. But if Kanye is better than anybody else in hip hop history in one category, it’s his ability to have a complete vision and see it through. Add in the memorable hook, which depending on if you’re listening to the dirty or clean version, is ALL DAY N—A or ALL DAY ALL DAY, and instant classic lines like (“You a fake Denzel like the Allstate n—a, if ya run into me better have Allstate witcha”) The song had too much swearing to be a huge hit pop wise, but it is definitely one of the best rap songs of the year. And it just keeps the audience waiting for Swish, whenever the Hell Kanye wants to drop it.\n\nNumber 6:\n\nTy Dolla $ign/Kendrick Lamar/Brandy/James Fauntleroy “LA”\n\nThe best song about the City of Angels since Pac’s “To Live & Die In LA“, “LA” was the perfect opener to Dolla $ign’s excellent Free TC. The contrast from his opening lines about how (“we still dyin over red and blue strings”) to the end (“bad bitches up at Greystone and Supper Club”) reinforce the highs and lows of the city. And in a year that saw Kendrick release the best album of the year, my favorite verse of his is this one. He shouts out his high school, the Lakers/Staples Center, the 110 freeway, and his (and mine as well) favorite era of Pac: The Makaveli period. A wonderful ode to our city by a few of the city’s most talented natives.\n\nNumber 5:\n\nDr. Dre/Jill Scott/Jon Connor/Anderson .Paak “For the Love of Money”\n\nJill Scott’s singing on here is probably my favorite of the entire year. Her voice just sounds wonderful and flows with the instrumentation in total harmony (unintentional pun I swear). A flip of Bone Thugs and Eazy’s “Foe Tha Love of $“, Dre’s 2015 version starts with a snarling, hungry verse from up-and-comer Jon Connor, who gives no fucks that he is the poorest person at the lavish party he is at, and coins the phrase “gold digger gorgeous.” Dre’s verse is the otherside of Connor’s verse, as he is the richest person at the party, and how he gives no fucks either. Scott’s outro singing (“want that, need that, root of all evil mayne”) reminded me a lot of another Dre classic, “Money” with fellow Compton legend King Tee. If there’s a small quibble I have with this song, it’s that I wish Dre had sampled a line (or at least something) from Eazy’s verse of the original song. But that’s a minor detail in what is a fabulous song.\n\nhttp://song.urbanmusicdaily.me/?link=audiorok.com/lqvzjpqrwktx\n\nNumber 4:\n\nFetty Wap/Remy Boyz “679”\n\nYEEEAAHHHHH BABBYYYYYY!!! This was the year of Big Zoowap himself, Fetty Wap.(Future can lay claim to it being his year as well) While “Trap Queen” was the spark/kick in the door of the mainstream moment for him, “679” is the ethos of Fetty’s movement. It basically says so at the beginning of the song (“REMY BOY LIFESTYLE!!!”). It is such a joyous, happy song, with its instant quotables (“I traded in my Trues for some Robins”/”I got a glock in my Rari!”) Fetty’s talent is making incredibly fun music, and he is able to come across as completely sincere in what he is doing. Monty and P-Dice complemented the song with catchy verses, and Peoples established himself as damn good producer that can produce bangers at the drop of a dime. For me, there was no better party song than “679”, and I still get hyped hearing it. All hail King Zoowap.\n\nNumber 3:\n\nGame/Ty Dolla $ign/YG/Problem “Up on the Wall”\n\nGame keeps chugging along. Maybe the most underrated rap artist this century in terms of how good his discography is, this is the peak in his Documentary 2/2.5 double album from October. The legendary producer Battlecat hooks up Game and three of the best young artists from LA with a West Coast monster beat, complete with an interpolation of Kool & The Gang’s classic jam, “Get Down On It.” The song is pretty much an ode to the gang culture in LA, particularly guys wearing red. Problem steals the show for me near the end of the song with his flow and punch lines, (“West side ride em off 3rd avenue, go at us have your shirt wet as Lake Havasu”) and Dolla $ign does justice to Kool & The Gang with the hook. Battlecat deserves all the most credit here with the immaculate production on the song. Once again though, Game finds a way to work well and bring out the best in others.\n\nNumber 2:\n\nFetty Wap/Remy Boyz “How We Do Thangs”\n\nTruth be told, this entire list could have been songs from Fetty Wap. He had the magic touch this year in my mind (similar to 50 Cent in 2003 or Lil Wayne in 2007). “How We Do Thangs” stands above all of the rest though for a couple reasons, the first being the huge hook that Fetty delivers to perfection. Dropping super catchy hooks is second nature for Fetty, and to me, this was his best one. (“Choppa kickin we call it Liu Kang baby!”) His verse is also instantly memorable with lines like (“Started on 22nd I’m from Harlem! Numba one like I’m D Rose I be scorin!”) It’s not that the lyrics are earth shattering by any means, but Fetty’s delivery is impeccable and his voice is so unique. The P Dice version is probably my favorite, mostly due to his closing line (“Up now no need to get violent-fuck round get killed for some Robins”), but Yung Lan’s remastered album version adds more bass and drums, as well synths. Hopefully Fetty and Yung Lan keep working together in the future, because those guy have amazing chemistry.\n\nNumber 1:\n\nYG “Twist My Fingaz”\n\nIf you had told me at the end of 2013 that YG would have one of my favorite albums of 2014 with My Krazy Life, and my favorite song of 2015, there is absolutely no way I would have believed young. Keenon Jackson burst on the scene 5 years ago now with Dolla $ign and “Toot It & Boot It“, and has just kept getting better ever since. “Twist My Fingaz”finds him in perfect harmony with Terrace Martin, who is a jack of all trades, with this 90’s West Coast, Battlecat-ish sounding beat. The hook encapsulates who YG is, a guy who wants to party, but is still gangbanging to the very end. Recorded and released a month after getting shot recording in Studio City, YG taunts his rivals (“I’m the only one who got hit and was walking the same day”) as well as throws a little jab to Dr. Dre (“I’m the only one to make it out the West without Dre”) , who said he wasn’t a big fan of the West Coast ratchet sound. Slim 400 deserves a shout out for his awesome post hook chant (“Do ya dance YG do ya dance”) that immediately gets lodged in your brain. The song might have been a little too West Coast for the charts, but if YG keeps coming with hits like this, his second album Still Krazy might top the surprising greatness of his first.\n\nIt’s perfect that this Saturday’s game against UCLA at the Rose Bowl is the sixth game of the season for the Ducks. I say that because earlier today it hit me how I hope the Ducks come out and play: like it’s game 6 of a series. If you watch enough basketball or baseball, in a game 6 the team trailing 3-2 has no time for messing around, hurting anybody’s feelings, or margin for error. The team is in the most literal sense on the brink, and it is (in a way) freeing because the team has nothing else to lose. There is no time to worry about tomorrow because if the game doesn’t end with a W, then there is no tomorrow. That’s why in baseball you send your best pitcher out on short rest and have him go as long as he can, and in basketball you play the starters as many minutes as possible (in the case of a LeBron or Durant, those guys play all 48)\n\nI say all of this because this is basically what the Ducks are facing Saturday. Sure there are at least 6 more games to play after this, but everything the season was built up for-winning the conference, going to the playoff, maybe (FINALLY) winning the Natty-all goes away if the Ducks leave the Rose Bowl scoring less points then the Bruins. That margin for error I mentioned left the building as soon as Arizona took a knee last Thursday up in Autzen, and now Oregon is staring down the barrel of a loaded gun for the rest of the season. I was always convinced this would be the toughest game on the schedule, and I still believe that way, because although UCLA’s o-line is worse than ours, and Mariota is a touch better then Hundley, that’s offset in my mind because UCLA has Jim Mora-who I think is building a great program at UCLA, while we have Mark Helfrich-who the jury is still out on to say the least.\n\nHelfrich’s earned leeway for guiding the Ducks to the great second half against Michigan State, and it’s not his fault the o-line has collapsed due the amount of injuries, but he didn’t motivate the team last year in their loss to Arizona, and that has me concerned going into this game. To be fair, the 2 guys who were leaders of the offense last year (De’Anthony and Josh Huff) didn’t do the best job at motivating guys leading up to that game. (An aside: Josh Huff’s attitude came from a place of seeing his senior season go up in flames thanks to Stanford. He should have put on a better face for the young guys, but it’s understandable in his disappointment. De’Anthony-although he wasn’t captain-was a leader and in all honesty he shouldn’t have been, and I say that in the best way possible. It’s because DAT legitimately views football as a game, and enjoys the hell out of it, and if you win cool, and if you lose, no big deal it was still fun. I’ve long thought that he is going to be an awesome youth coach because of this philosophy, because those are the type of people that should be coaching kids, but it’s not the best mentality to have in a competitive high stakes environment.) Mariota, Ifo and Hronnis Grasu are this years leaders, and have so far done a better job of leading the Ducks through adversity then last years squad. I honestly believe the players still believe the season can be special, but although they are the ones in control of making plays, it’s not all in their hands, which is what concerns me.\n\nThese two concerns are our coordinators-Scott Frost and Don Pellum, and the mounting injuries on both the offensive & defensive lines. After having a couple days of stewing about the Arizona loss, I realized the loss wasn’t on Helfrich as much as I thought (as seen by my Facebook status yearning for DA GAWD Chip Kelly’s return). What I am worried about is the two men surrounding Helfrich and that they might not be good enough. Frost has been handcuffed by the attrition on the o-line, but the playcalling in the third quarter, notably the three straight inside runs that resulted in a three and out, was super alarming. On the defensive side, Don Pellum has decided that his favorite formation is the 3-8, which looks even more foolish now with our best defensive lineman Arik Armstead hurt. The problem with our 3-4 as well is that it puts more linebackers on the field, which is easily our worst position group on the entire team. Joe Walker is the only decent inside linebacker and he has to split time with Derrick Malone (who is the flip side of Michael Clay) and Rodney Hardrick (who doesn’t deserve to start after tearing off Anu Solomen’s helmet and goading Tony Washington into doing the ‘Namaste’ which drew the unsportsmanlike conduct penalty.) We don’t send enough pressure to get to the QB, and are dropping too many into coverage so the D gets burned when there is a draw or delayed handoff (like in the Arizona game). Outside of the Arizona game and 2 quarters of the Civil War last year, the defense played it’s usual “pretty good” that it had been under Nick Aliotti the past few years. This year, outside of the second half against Michigan State, the defense has been alarmingly bad, and even South Dakota and Wyoming were able to move the ball against the D without much resistance. Poor tackling and lack of discipline has really hurt them on that side of the ball this year, and Pellum needs to start holding the players accountable for their poor play.\n\nThe good news about this weekend for the defense is that UCLA’s offensive line is somehow even worse than ours is, and they don’t have nearly the amount of injuries to the unit. I feel bad for both Mariota and Brett Hundley in this game though, because these guys are getting hammered nearly every time they drop back to pass. The sequence of Hundley getting sacked on three straight plays against Utah was something I’m sure most Duck fans thought looked familiar as Mariota has taken beatings the last two games. All that said, I think this is a toss up game and will go to the team that plays more desperately. This is a defacto elimination game for the college football playoff, and while for UCLA that would be awful for them to be out of it by mid-October, up in Eugene a loss is going to be the official slammed shut end of an era. To have the best quarterback the program’s ever seen (college-wise) last two years go down the drain is going to be a bitter pill to swallow and the program will have-to put it bluntly, wasted multiple chances at the elusive National Title. When Mariota leaves, and the uncertainty about the talent of our coaching staff, the window to win a National Title could be closed for some time. It would be a shame to witness all of that begin Saturday. If the Ducks play desperate and lose, then it just wasn’t meant to be. But if they play like they did against Arizona again, with unimaginative playcalling and lifeless defense, then that will be more crushing then the actual loss. Please win the day.\n\nWith it being August 1st, and college football just a day over 4 weeks away, there is no better time to put (electronic) pen to paper and discuss the upcoming Duck football season, and how this is going to end in total elation or abject failure. Not since Chip Kelly’s inaugural season in 2009 has there been more uncertainty about how the Ducks are going to do, and that leaves me very nervous with how this season could turn out. Last year didn’t end on the best terms,with the Ducks going just 3-2 down the stretch which could have easily been 2-3 were it not for a couple different breaks against Oregon State. Even beating Texas in Texas at the Alamo Bowl-which looks good in the box score at 30-7, doesn’t hold up that well because the offense only scored one touchdown. All that being said, it is a new year, with a new defensive coordinator (Don Pellum taking over for retired Nick Allioti), and everybody, especially Mark Helfrich and Scott Frost, is one year wiser. Marcus Mariota is fully healthy, which besides winning obviously, is the biggest goal for this season. If Mariota can make it through the season unscathed, then the Ducks should be in prime position to make the College Football Playoff. The question of if the Ducks are good enough to win the national title will be answered in week 2, in a game that will basically dictate the foreseeable future of the program.\n\nMake no mistake about it, the Michigan State game on September 6th is going to be (outside the 2011 National Title Game), the most important game in the program’s history. This is where we will find out if the Ducks are still on the trending upward trajectory that began in 1994, or if Mark Helfrich is going to slide the Ducks from a top-5 program back to a top-15/top-20 type of program. If Oregon beats Michigan State, they’ll probably vault into the top 3 and will not only give the player’s confidence that should carry through the season, but also reassure an antsy fanbase that is unsure if Mark Helfrich is a good enough coach to win a National Title. Lose against Michigan State however, and I honestly think the season goes into the tank. A loss against the Spartans dents national credibility of the Pac-12, probably ends Mariota’s Heisman campaign, and puts Helfrich squarely on the hot seat. And although there would be more than enough time to recover and win the Pac-12 (and probably still make the CFB Playoff), the psychological damage that loss would cause would probably lead the Ducks to a 9-3 or 8-4 record. Oregon should win the game. The Autzen factor, the chip on the shoulder factor, the fact that Michigan State graduated a lot of good players from their outstanding defense, and having the best player on the field (Mariota) should mean the Ducks come away with a victory. But I see a lot of qualities that MSU has that reminds me of a certain Pac-12 school that gives the Ducks trouble. Connor Cook isn’t a great quarterback, but he extends plays and makes them out of thin air, just like Kevin Hogan. The Spartans physical defense pounds teams into submission, which is like the teams that have given the Ducks trouble in the past. However knowing that the o-line beefed up in the offseason, combined with Mariota being healthy, I just have to believe that the Ducks win the this game.\n\nIf you ask most Duck fans though, myself included, Michigan State is not the game that Oregon most needs to win. That comes November 1st, again at Autzen, against Stanford. The team that has ruined the past two seasons, through physicality and luck (as well as Oregon shooting themselves in the foot multiple times) returns to Autzen for the first time since the 2012 game, or what I like to call “the worst loss in program history.” If you’ll remember, Oregon was number 1 in the country and on their way to kicking Notre Dame’s ass in Miami. If De’Anthony Thomas makes a block, if Maldanado makes one kick, if Ifo’s arm isn’t pulled, if Michael Clay recovers Hogan’s fumble in OT, if if if….Only one of those plays needed to happen and Oregon wins. Last year’s game saw a first quarter drive where Mariota underthrew Josh Huff who would have scored and put pressure on Stanford early, a costly De’Anthony fumble inside the 5 yard line, as well as foolishly going for a touchdown on fourth down instead of kicking a field goal. Again, Stanford played physical and wore down the Ducks defense, which actually played okay considering the offense was constantly shooting themselves in the foot. So yes, 2014’s game against Stanford is huge, especially for (once again) the psyche of the team and fanbase. Beating Stanford will get the monkey off the back and should be smooth sailing for the rest of the regular season until the Pac-12 title game. Oregon though has to play mistake free football, and not make mental mistakes that have cost them the last two years. There’s a potential worry that Oregon could be too jacked up for this game, and they play with too much emotion, and that is a concern. I think winning the first quarter is imperative to this game and if the Ducks can put up 14 points early, that will leave Stanford scrambling to keep up and score quickly-which is not in their comfort zone.\n\nAll things considered, I believe the Ducks will go 11-1 in the regular season, with the lone loss coming down here at UCLA. However, I believe the Ducks avenge the loss in the Pac-12 title game in Santa Clara where they beat UCLA and make the inaugural College Football Playoff. The Michigan State and Stanford games put the fear of God in me, and there are potential trap games at Wazzu and Utah, but I feel like the Ducks should be able to get through those with wins. I’m really high on UCLA though, and think that Jim Mora really has a great program in the works and will win in early October against the Ducks. A loss against UCLA shouldn’t hurt that much though, because UCLA should be top-10 (maybe even top-5) and with the possibility of a rematch just two months later would motivate the Ducks for the rest of the season. After the Pac-12 season concludes, it’s really all in God’s hands with regards to the playoff. There’s a multitude of teams the Ducks could play (FSU, Alabama, Ohio State,etc..), as well as venues depending on seeding (either the Rose Bowl or the Sugar Bowl) and too many variables between now and then. The plan should be to win the conference though, because there is no way the Pac-12 team is getting left out, especially with the fact the polls don’t factor into the selection committee, so East Coast Bias shouldn’t come into play. God willing it will finally be the Ducks year and we win it all, but the goal should be to get to the playoff and go from there.\n\nToday marks the 20th anniversary of my favorite album, Illmatic. Since the day it was released, Illmatic has become the standard bearer by which all great modern hip hop albums are compared. It’s the representation of the what is viewed as the best era of hip hop, the early 90’s, by a guy who would be one of the best rappers of all time, Nasir bin Olu Dara Jones, aka Nas. A prodigy since his jaw-dropping verse on Main Source’s “Live At The BBQ” in 1991 at the young age of 17, Nas had high expectations bestowed upon him for his debut, and in the pre-internet age, made the public wait three years before giving them that release. But like they say, it was well worth the wait.\n\nIt’s hard to say anything in the art world (music, films, paintings, etc…) is the greatest, because art is subjective. I can’t say that Illmatic is the greatest hip hop album ever made, because it’s a matter of taste and if someone wanted to say that it’s Paid In Full or The Chronic, well they’d have just as good an argument as I would, because it’s all subjective. Having said that, Illmatic is my favorite album, and the reasons why I love it are simple: because it’s an absolutely mind blowing front to back album. For me, it’s the closest thing to perfection in music.\n\nA huge reason this album is perfect to me is the run length of the album, which clocks in at just under 40 minutes. With 10 tracks (9 songs plus the intro), there is no time wasted. I’m all for skits and interludes, but Illmatic didn’t need any talk breaks after ‘The Genesis’, which kicks off the album perfectly with its sample from the 80’s hip hop movie Wild Style, and conversation involving Nas, his little brother Jungle, and AZ. From there it jumps into ‘NY State Of Mind’, which just shatters your mind with the amazing beat courtesy of DJ Premier, and some of the best verses of Nas’ career. “I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death” and “life is parallel to hell but I must maintain” is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the dazzling wordplay on this track. Needless to say, it’s an awesome intro song.\n\nIt’s like this for the rest of the album. There’s no weak tracks, no filler, no unnecessary features, or anything that can bog down the typical hip hop album. It’s just Nas and 5 of the best producers the genre has ever seen, all at the top of their game (DJ Premier, L.E.S., Q-Tip, Large Professor, and my personal favorite of the group-Pete Rock.) The album actually popularized the idea that multiple producers would contribute beats to an artist’s to an album, rather than have a single producer handle production for the entire album. For better or worse, this has become the M.O. for hip hop since then to have multiple producers on album.\n\nI’m just glad that Illmatic is still held up in such high regard amongst not just hip hop circles, but music in general. The album is the idealistic version of what a great hip hop album is as it has no pop sheen on it at all. There wasn’t a crossover single or big hit off this album, and that is great. It’s because the combination of these songs is greater than any one of them individually. Because’s it such a great work of art, the best way to experience it is through listening beginning to end. It flows so well (especially for the fact it was uncharted territory for a multiple producer album) and is forces you to take notice. Unlike the other life-changing 1994 New York album Ready To Die, which lets the listener enjoy it at a less engaging level because of the easy listening voice that Biggie has, Nas required you to pay attention due to the verbal dexterity that he has. Together these guys took the spotlight back from the West Coast and Death Row and make hip hop listeners pay attention again to New York.\n\nBesides the late, great Notorious B.I.G., I have no artist I enjoy more than Nas. Since seeing his “Hate Me Now” music video as a 9 year old, I’ve literally been on the bandwagon ever since. He’s had a great career and is one of the best rappers of all-time, and although he’s never made an album again as great as Illmatic, nobody else has either. It Was Written, Stillmatic, I Am…, and 2012’s Life Is Good amongst others are all pretty damn great albums in their own right, and are albums that other rappers wish they had in their own discography. But at the end, it will always be Illmatic. The most revered album from the most revered year in hip hop history, it came out at the perfect time and moment for hip hop as it was at its critical peak. The best way to demonstrate the album’s power is from Nas’ performance last week out at Coachella. Just one night after OutKast had performed to an apathetic, not exactly hip hop friendly crowd, I was worried Nas was going to get a very rude reception, especially because he doesn’t have any songs as pop friendly as OutKast does. To my pleasant surprise though, the same crowd that disrespected OutKast the night before was completely entranced with Nas and was in high energy mode the entire time as he performed the entire album. Even as he noted that the album was probably older than a lot of people in the crowd, the kids loved it because Illmatic is universal. Play it for anyone and they’ll love it if they give it a chance, because there’s so much to get out of it from its lyrics, production, and subject matter. Hip Hop is my favorite genre, and Illmatic is a huge reason why.\n\nUntil the summer of 2012, Rick Ross had never really slipped up musically. The trajectory of his career had trended upward since his 2006 debut Port of Miami. Although Rozay had suffered multiple seizures in the Fall of 2011, his Rich Forever mixtape, released right after New Year’s Day 2012, was a smash success and had whet hip hop fan’s appetite for God Forgives, I Don’t. Just the title alone meant that the album was going to be epic, and many Rozay fans, myself included, thought this would be the album to solidify him as the hottest rapper in the game. Looking back, the warning signs were there that God Forgives wouldn’t be the blockbuster we all were expecting (the singles were lukewarm, and sonically there wasn’t anything new being offered), and saw a promising beginning of 2012 kind of go down the drain by the time 2013 rolled around.\n\nSince last summer I’ve thought the Rozay ship was sinking and that MMG’s best days were in the rear view mirror. “Box Chevy” and “No Games”, both promo singles released for Mastermind, failed to gain traction and honestly made Ross seem like he was in a commercial and critical rut. Both songs are absent from the album though, and the album is much better for it. Because even though I had negative expectations going into listening to it, Mastermind is a definite comeback album for Rozay and allows him to regain his footing. I won’t go so far to say it’s what God Forgives, I Don’t should have been, but it impacts and demands more attention then GFID’s music ever did. While God Forgives saw Ross contemplate his mortality and had internal questions about his life, Mastermind goes the other way and sees Ross return to his invincible, Teflon Don persona. For nearly any other artist, I prefer the former- introspection and deep thought usually allows for a better listen because the artist is being as honest as they can. But because he is (literally) unbelievable and over-the-top, I love the unstoppable, unbeatable Rick Ross. We’re so far past the point of what he raps about being conceivable, that it’s endearing when he has the intro on “Drug Dealers Dream” read out his bank account status that says he has over 92 million dollars. Does he actually have 92 million dollars in a Bank of America account? Who knows, but the point is that he’s in this kingpin character that would have that amount of money.\n\nThe lyrics on the album are nothing new. Rozay doesn’t dwell on him being shot at early in 2013, instead through the skit “Shots Fired” and “Nobody” he seems to feel emboldened by the incident and even raps “New Mercedes as it peels off/nothing penetrates my steel doors.” The song itself is maybe the most interesting on the album. French Montana sings the hook, itself a sample of Biggie’s classic “You’re Nobody Til Somebody Kills You”, and the beat samples the song as well. Diddy is on the track, talking shit and screaming as if it is a track off of Life After Death, and Ross does his best Biggie impression. It sounds terrible in theory, but it somehow works, and is one of the high points of the album. The other high point, “War Ready”, sees former rivals Ross and Young Jeezy reunite for the first time since DJ Khaled’s “Fed Up” single. Using a anthemic beat from Mike Will Made It, this is the song that’s going to be the pump up song of 2014. Expect a lot of football and basketball teams to be coming out to this. Much credit must be giving to the newest Maybach signee Tracy T, who has a drill sergeant-like hook that gets stuck in your head the first time you hear it. Ross and Jeezy both sound right in their element, even if it’s surprising they reconciled (thanks T.I.) In classic Rozay fashion, he ends the song with a homage to Scarface, the film that has driven his entire career.\n\nAlthough the album isn’t perfect, and probably isn’t the best of his career (that’s a tossup between Port of Miami, Deeper Than Rap, or Teflon Don) it is a return to form for Miami’s Biggest Boss. Simply put, if this album failed, then the Ross run was probably over. But by doubling down on what he knows best (great beats and mafia boss raps), Ross reassumes his position in the hip hop hierarchy. By making an album with no weak tracks, Ross forces the hip hop world to take him seriously (as a musician) again. It’s the same formula he used when his correctional officer past was discovered. Ross, then and now, realized the only way to get people on his side was by making good music, and going farther and farther into a caricature that either people a) would appreciate him and the music at face value, or b) despise who he was and stood for, but bob their head anyway because the music was too damn good. For a long time I couldn’t figure out what it was about Ross that made me enjoy his music so much (I even wrote about it nearly three years ago ), and then eventually stopped caring and just enjoyed the music. Ross’ music is Scarface, and for the longest time I contemplated him like he was The Godfather. Scarface is one of my favorite movies of all-time, but it’s not really supposed to be looked at through a critical lense- instead it’s meant to be enjoyed as the dumb, over-the-top action film that it is. Ross tried too hard to make The Godfather with God Forgives, I Don’t, and that style just doesn’t work for him. The shootouts and stacking paper sky high until you buy a house with an elevator and a tiger is what Rozay is all about. And with Mastermind, he is back to that.\n\nOxymoron is finally here. During the long wait from Schoolboy Q’s 2012 excellent album, Habits & Contradictions, we saw TDE take off and Kendrick Lamar become hip hop’s biggest new star, with Q always right behind him, getting Oxymoron ready for the world. The album’s success or failure is important for TDE, who are in the midst of their ascension in the music business and another successful album would hail that the label is new great rap label, the 2010 era of Death Row, Bad Boy, Young Money, etc… But it all comes back to the most simple question, the most important factor that answers everything: is this a good album?\n\nThe answer is yes, this is a great album. I don’t think I would have said that after the first listen, but Oxymoron is a grower. When you listen to it initially, you nod your head, say it’s good, and give it a 7 out of 10. But for me, the repeat listens have really fleshed out the album. Schoolboy gives snapshots of his life, and how his family affects a large part of it. In what might be the best song on the album, “Hoover Street”, Schoolboy details his life growing up and how hectic it was. We learn about his uncle-who through small lines Q drops-sells Q’s bike, and steals Q’s stuff and makes Q’s mom start locking doors inside the house. It’s these small lines “I also notice moms be locking doors when he around\n\nBut anyways, he wife done left him and now he living with us, my bike is missing, Grandma like to hide her check every month” that allow the listener to imagine Q’s crazy uncle and what living with him would be like. And like I said, the genius of the album didn’t totally jump out to me at first. I didn’t like the first two songs off the record “Gangsta”, and “Los Awesome” at first, and now they are two of my favorite off the album. “Gangsta” has a hook that gets stuck in your head and you find yourself saying it throughout the day, while “Los Awesome” has production from Pharrell that at first doesn’t sound like it fits, but both Q and Jay Rock work their voices into the songs that make you want to blast it from your car.\n\nThe second half of the album is possibly more interesting than the first half, as “The Purge” might be the best beat on the album. Kudos to Tyler, The Creator for making a great instrumental that actually pays homage to the movie by having the blaring siren play throughout the song. “Blind Threats” is probably my favorite song right now, which sounds like a classic Wu-Tang song, especially with a guest verse from the Chef himself, Raekwon. “Hell of a Night” “Break tHe Bank” and “Man Of The Year” are all singles, either mainstream or promo, and yet none of them compromised Q’s sound or feel forced. If I had to guess, I believe that “Man Of The Year” will be the big single off the album, though “Studio” with BJ the Chicago Kid has the chance to be the most mainstream accessible. If you got the deluxe edition, the bonus tracks might be the most interesting on the entire album, mainly “His & Her Friend” and “Grooveline Pt. 2”. “His & Her Friend” is weird as hell, and feels hazy like one is under the influence (of alcohol or drugs) while listening to it. I enjoyed it because of the chopped and screwed sound, and because the production is very mellow and simple. “Grooveline Pt. 2” has easily the most surprising guest of the album, Suga Free, who although popular in LA in the 90’s, isn’t exactly an A-List LA rap legend, but he kills his verse on it, with possibly my favorite line of the whole album, “Remember Forrest Gump walked and he was pretty stupid.” The production is reminiscent of 70’s R&B and is smooth. “Fuck LA” ends the deluxe version and in classic Q fashion, he talks of running Los Angeles and how 50 Cent’s music and style influenced his own.\n\nThis is by no means a perfect album. It has a chance to be remembered as a classic, but I wouldn’t say it’s on the immediate classic level of Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City, the Kendrick opus that everyone is going to compare Oxymoron to. The comparison is faulty though because Schoolboy and Kendrick made two very different types of albums, and are two very different types of people. While Kendrick stands in the middle of the chaos in his stories, Schoolboy is either involved or is the chaos. What I like about Schoolboy though is his honesty, and that he isn’t proud of things that he has done, and does have legitimate regret. Admittedly, that regret is shown more in Habits & Contradictions, but still… It’s easy to say that he’s the bad kid to Kendrick’s good kid, but that doesn’t take into account how different their backgrounds played into who they became. Kendrick’s parents have a big influence on his album and gave him a relatively stable home life, while Schoolboy’s mom worked nights and he was being taken care of by his grandma (who showed him his first gun) while living with his crazy uncle. Schoolboy’s more of a free spirit because of this, and it shows through on the album. A lot of artists give off a “could care less” vibe, but through his music and interviews, Q really does seem like he is that type of person.\n\nAs I listen to this album again, I’m relieved that Q managed to live up to the hype while still staying true to his form. Q is not Kendrick, and that is a good thing. TDE’s calling card is that their artists are very different from one another, and that allows for a wide variety of sounds and ideas to be floated from the same camp. They’re all LA rappers (with the exception of Isiah Rashad), but they have different perspectives on life and what is going on around them. Schoolboy Q’s Oxymoron captures the struggle and hurdles that he faced getting to this point, both physically and mentally. It’ll be interesting to see where he goes from here, but for now, Q can relax and enjoy the fruits of his labor. I mentioned the 7 out of 10 initial score, but as of right now, I’d have to give it an 8.5 out of 10. Is it perfect? No, but that’s what we like out of Schoolboy Q -his honesty and imperfections."
