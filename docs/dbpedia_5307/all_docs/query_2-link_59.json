        "text": "Brianna Agyemang\n\nBillboard Women In Music, 2020 Executive of the Year, Brianna Agyemang has made it her mission during her tenure in music to move with both purpose and kindness. Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, Brianna first started in the music industry through a string of internships including Bad Boy Records, Columbia Records, as well as local nightclubs and radio stations during her college years at Carnegie Mellon University. Following graduation, she interned at Violator Management under the legendary Chris Lighty, later simultaneously interning at Roc Nation in Digital Marketing. From there, she went to Roc Nation’s International Marketing Department. Her love of music coupled with the desire to make it global became her impetus, as Brianna was the liaison between the United States and the rest of the world for artists including J. Cole, Vic Mensa, Mustard, and Justine Skye among others.\n\nBy 2015, Brianna was brought on to work with Meek Mill as his day-to-day manager at Roc Nation at the height of his groundbreaking project Dreams Worth More Than Money. She then formed the in-demand community collective The Brownies with fellow industry maven Ayanna P. Wilks, coordinating events and building artist and peer communities. By 2017, Brianna joined Atlantic Records as their Senior Director of Marketing, where her first project was the late Nipsey Hussle’s Grammy Award nominated breakthrough album Victory Lap. It was followed by Janelle Monáe’s Dirty Computer, as the Grammy nominations racked up for Brianna’s roster with the aforementioned Nipsey and Monáe, along with Meek Mill and Nigerian phenomenon Burna Boy. She continued her international momentum with UK artists like Stormzy and Mahalia.\n\nIn the Spring of 2020, Brianna joined Apple Music’s multi-faceted artist services platform Platoon, as her expertise in both domestic and international markets allow her the insight to work with artists spanning all corners of the globe. She and Wilks have taken The Brownies virtual, hosting and curating a number of events during the pandemic. A co-founder of #TheShowMustBePaused initiative, Brianna’s goal through her music career and activism is to remain consistent: “I just want to make sure that whatever I do, I stay true to myself.”\n\nToni Blackman\n\nThe first official US Hip Hop Ambassador, Toni’s work “changed the course of US cultural diplomacy”. She has served in several U.S. Department of State cultural diplomacy programs in the ACULSPEC program, as a Hip Hop Envoy, with the Bureau of Information & Education and others. Her tours: Jazz at Lincoln Center's Rhythm Road; Juror for American Music Abroad and ExchangesConnect; Touring Artist for the NextLevel Program on Team Senegal (UNC Music Dept); She has spoken at the UN, the World Social Forum in Barcelona, the ASPEN Creativity Summit in Oman, and other global events! Toni currently serves as the Alumni Outreach Director for Next Level Diplomacy project.\n\nAs Hollywood’s Spoken Word/Rap Coach Toni has both the expertise and the talent to help actors, performance artists and rappers embody what it means to be a poet. She was the only person Kwame Alexander thought of when his award-winning book, The Crossover, was picked up by Disney. Toni worked on the pilot, in pre-production and was brought on set during the taping of the first season. She has coached hundreds of performers for on-camera, concerts/tours, and events and can prep an artist for studio recording (and even MC battles). Toni works virtually and in person, conceptualizes and directs stage performances/pieces, and can co-write. She leads small groups and freestyle (improvisational intensives).\n\nToni Blackman is also one of the world’s foremost hip-hop educators. A pioneer in this lane, her influence permeates the field. Her approach to music education begins with a focus on emotional state, rather than formal or technical concepts. This approach springs from both her personal development journey and Toni’s own mastery of improvised rap. She has been a practicing emcee for several decades, has training in writing poetry and as a theater artist. Teaching for Change, an organization in Washington, D.C. was where she began formalizing her ideas while leading workshops in teacher re-certification programs. She still does a lot of professional development work. One of the first rap artists to serve as artist-in-residence at major institutions, Toni has taught thousands of workshops around the world, taught a Hip Hop course at Binghamton University, served as a Visiting Scholar at the University of Michigan and most recently NYU.\n\nSean C\n\nAs a music industry veteran of 25 years, Sean C has launched the careers of legends as a label executive, contributed to over 30 million records as a producer, and most recently focusing on music supervision and advising for television and film networks such as Netflix, Hulu, and Apple+.\n\nSean C’s music dreams began in Harlem as a founding member of the legendary DJ collective Xmen/Xecutioners. He was taught the art of DJing and song construction by Dougie Fresh’s Get Fresh Crew.\n\nSimultaneously, Sean set out to learn the business side of music while growing as a producer. He took an internship with Steve Rifkind’s Loud Records and quickly grew into a Vice President of A&R. During his tenure at Loud, he worked on groundbreaking acts like Mobb Deep, Dead Prez, Linkin Park, and more. Although an executive, Sean was a producer first. At the legendary record label Loud Records, he provided Big Pun with the Puerto Rican anthem “100%” while on the outside of Loud Records, he produced Jay-Z‘s first hit record, the Mary J Blige-featured “Can't Knock the Hustle.”\n\nIn 2002, Sean partnered with a young DJ/producer LV and launched his own production company Grind Music, which eventually secured a production deal with Bad Boy Records. Sean reunited with Steve Rifkind as VP ofA&R for his Universal-distributed label SRC Records. At SRC he facilitated Fat Joe and Terror Squad's #1-charting record Lean Back. While composing for acts like Jadakiss, GhostFace and Ice Cube, Grind Music was tapped by Jay-Z to produce the American Gangster album, including the Grammy-nominated single “Roc Boys.”\n\nWhen Sean C isn’t in the studio producing classics for icons, he can be found consulting for brands Serato, Akai, and television series such as “The Get Down” and “Luke Cage.” He was an on-set music consultant for the hit Hulu series WuTang: An American Saga, coaching actors on their rap performances, advising directors on authentic dialogue, and set design. Sean is taking on the same role in Sara Bareilles’s new JJ Abrams-produced Apple+ series Starling. Look out for his score contribution on the indie animated short film Unalienable Rights.\n\nSean recently produced \"Streams of Thought Vol3: Cane & Able\" a Black Thought project which includes features by Swizz Beats, Pusha T, Killer Mike, and Portugal the Man. He also serves as executive producer in this collaboration with the frontman of the ground-breaking group The Roots, Black Thought.\n\nIf that weren't enough, Sean is consulting on and appears in 50 Cent's Power Book 3: Raising Kanan series.\n\nSean is the music supervisor in the Liongate/hidden Empire film, Fatale, starring Hillary Swank.\n\nChief Ayanda Ifadara Clarke\n\nChief Ayanda Ifadara Clarke (respectfully known as “Chief Ayanda”) is an esteemed African American master percussionist and arts educator.

He’s intentional about intertwining music, culture, and spirituality in all endeavors. For his lifelong commitment to traditional African culture, Clarke was installed as a chief in Nigeria by his mentor Chief Agbongbon Fakayode Faniyi. He also consults as an officiant for ancestral veneration ceremonies (recent clients include Wesleyan, Princeton, SUNY Purchase, the Bowery Resident’s Committee (BRC) Advisory Group for the Inwood Sacred Sites, and others).\n\nChief Ayanda founded THE FADARA GROUP, as well as AJIBILU MUSIC to house his educational programs, public performances, community initiatives, and recorded music projects.\n\nNaima Cochrane\n\nNaima Cochrane is an award-winning music marketer and leading voice in Black music and culture whose superpower is storytelling.\n\nA music industry veteran of more than 20 years, Naima honed her craft at culture-shifting labels Bad Boy and Arista Records, then legacy majors Columbia and Epic Records, working with mold-breaking acts including Beyoncé, John Legend, and Tyler, the Creator as a marketing executive. After leaving the label side of the business, she continued her career with EGOT Legend and later Oscar-nominated, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony award-winning actress and singer Cynthia Erivo as management.\n\nIn 2017, Naima created #MusicSermon, a curated storytelling series on Twitter about pre-blog era Soul and Hip-Hop. The series was a viral hit, with Sunday “services” drawing engagement from esteemed artists, creatives, and storytellers such as Ava Duvernay, Lin Manuel Miranda, and Missy Elliot. #MusicSermon transitioned Naima into journalism, and since 2018 her voice and work have been featured in outlets including Billboard, Essence, and the NY Times, as well as published works including 2021’s Smithsonian Anthology of Hip-Hop and Rap. Partners including Spotify, LeBron James’ SpringHill Company, and Sirius XM/Pandora have tapped Naima’s unique expertise for special and scripted projects, including Sirius/Pandora’s Webby-award-winning All Music is Black Music podcast. She remains entrenched in the business side of the entertainment industry as a marketing consultant and led the creative strategy for Empire Records’ Clio Award-winning campaign for late singer Aaliyah’s highly anticipated catalog re-release in 2021.\n\nPassionate about both framing music within a broader cultural and historical context and using that work in ways that serve both current and future Black artists and executives, Naima leads mission-critical research as a founding board member of the Black Music Association, an advocacy organization of music managers and lawyers working to address systemic racism within the music business. Naima is additionally a visiting professor at The Clive Davis Institute at New York University, Tisch School of the Arts, preparing the next generation of entertainment industry creatives for the road ahead.\n\nAt home, Naima watches too much TV, weaves riveting threads as a Twitter raconteur, and teaches herself how to DJ.\n\nJohnny Cocoa\n\nGrowing up, the Texas artist was no stranger to music. Johnny Cocoa was always deeply immersed in music with his mother and sisters teaching him how to sing and going to church, but his own personal interest piqued after graduating high school. Johnny has now spent almost a decade perfecting his craft drawing inspirations from the likes of James Brown, Russ, Kendrick Lamar, Lil Wayne, Drake, and J Cole. His music is heavily focused on Black power, unity, self-love and the positive progress of society.\n\nJohnny’s continuous stream of singles and projects over the years has culminated in his debut project To The World in 2021. Throughout the project, he showcases his versatility as an artist, delivering bars and fan favorites “Thuggin’ By My Lonely” and “Man in the Mirror.” The project also features the popular song “Letters from Itachi” – inspired by one of the recording artist’s favorite anime shows, Naruto.\n\nThe Texas native followed up with his 2021 fall single release “On God” which has racked over 1.9M+ views to date, earmarking the track as his highest streamed single. The soulful track blends reggae tones and vocals with captivating storytelling told through his raps.\n\nJohnny’s latest 2022 single and visual “Free Bird,” captures a liberated world when folks fully embrace free-spirited nature to go after what’s theirs for the taking. The single release precludes the artist’s I AM WHO I AM release – a 9 track EP project that arrives in tandem with Johnny’s official record deal signing with Roc Nation which the label announced just last month.\n\nThe southern artist has already caught the attention and public support of music and pop culture icons such as Drake and Kanye West who have recognized his adept fusion of hip-hop and R&B. With his sharp sense of songcraft, hustle and drive, Johnny continues to carve out his own lane in the music industry with promise of the world's next breakthrough sound.\n\nHDBeenDope\n\nHDBeenDope doesn't follow trends — instead, he embodies a New York City energy rarely seen in hip-hop that can't be duplicated. The 28-year-old underdog makes music that forces you to believe in yourself with an unmatched sound that's both braggadocious and earnest, plus straightforward yet bold. HD's music cuts through the trendy NYC drill scene — showcasing charisma, style, and lyricism that's unmistakably his own.\n\nHis success led him to sign with Roc Nation in 2022, making him the only Brooklyn artist on Jay-Z's label. His sound got him press from Complex, Billboard, Vibe, UPROXX, and Hot 97. His music has garnered millions of views and plays from fans around the globe, with placements on Madden 2021, NBA 2K, and UFC 4. His energy has captivated arenas, performing at Barclays Center for the Brooklyn Nets and Citi Field for Rolling Loud New York 2021. Most recently, HD skills were fully displayed for Roc Nation's first \"Set the Bar\" cypher session hosted by Jadakiss and Young Guru. There isn't anything Darius can't do if he puts his mind to it. But even with his gifts, people try to count him out.\n\nHis latest EP, What Can They Say, is a culmination of his musical genius. Executive produced by Dizzy Banko, the five-track EP hits unlike any hip-hop music coming out of NYC. The in-your-face attitude bleeds through and HD raps with the confidence of a heavyweight prize fighter. HDBeenDope is well ahead of the game.\n\nWith his newest chapter in motion, HD will continue trail-blazing his lane in hip-hop with his dynamic sound and unique creative approach. \"I'm just documenting life; all my music is just human,\" HD says. \"I'm focused on growth, being the version of myself that I see.\"\n\nJazzy Lo\n\nBorn and raised in Memphis, TN, Jazzy Lo is a multimedia journalist, AR and radio host.

TTT elevates the everyday fashion item of T-shirts from commonplace to uncommon works of art. We upcycle three (sometimes more) T-shirts into one seamless flowing garment that can be configured to be worn in six unique styles. Each style—from poncho to hoodie to shawl and beyond—brings dynamic versatility to traditional T-shirts.\n\nThe concept was developed in the early 2000s when TTT creator Beau McCall was trying to find an outfit to wear to a George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic concert. While sorting through nearly one-hundred T-shirts in his collection he couldn’t settle on which one to wear. So he came up with the idea to sew together three of his favorite T-shirts. And that’s when TTT was born.\n\nInspired by the role of T-shirts as a canvas for messages, we thoughtfully curate each creation to tell celebratory, inspirational, witty, and provocative narratives. The variety of themes covers everything from pop culture to social justice.\n\nWith creativity, a malleable silhouette, and a commitment to bold statements, we are redefining the concept of a T-shirt.\n\nTTT have been featured in media outlets including The NY Times and Women’s Wear Daily. The line has also been a hit with shoppers at venues such as Nordstrom, the Brooklyn Museum, and AfroPunk. TTT are held in the private collections of celebrities such as Debbie Harry of Blondie and in the permanent collections at The Museum at FIT (New York) and Victoria and Albert Museum (London).\n\nKenneth J.

With 20 published albums to his credit and his numerous appearances with other artists, KRS-One is believed to have written the most rhymes in Hip Hop’s history. In the 1990s as “hip-hop” grew more and more commercialized and corporate, it was KRS-One that openly rejected such cultural exploitation and materialism grounding Hip Hop in its original principles of peace, love, unity and safely having fun. Teaching everything from self-creation to stopping violence; from vegetarianism to transcendental meditation, from the establishment of Hip Hop Appreciation Week (every third week in May), to establishing Hip Hop as an international culture at the United Nations (2001), KRS-One has single-handedly held the history and original arts of Hip Hop together now for over two decades.\n\nIn addition to lecturing at over 500 universities in the United States and publishing three ground-breaking books; The Science of Rap (1995), Ruminations (2003), and the Gospel of Hip Hop (2009), KRS-One has also established the Stop The Violence Movement (1989), influenced the creation of the “West-Coast All-Stars’ anti-gang anthem “We’re All In The Same Gang” (1990), warned the Hip Hop community against giving up their humanity for technological advancement (H. E. A. L.—Human Education Against Lies-1991), and has established the Temple of Hip Hop for the spiritual exploration of Hip Hop’s culture (1996). It was KRS-One who first argued that “rap is something we do; Hip Hop is something we live” and introduced the “I am Hip Hop” philosophy in 1994 which Black Entertainment Television uses as the title of their Hip Hop Lifetime Achievement Award today. Without question, KRS-One has been the loudest voice for the actual preservation and expansion of original Hip Hop worldwide.\n\nWhen he is not touring or lecturing, on his so-called “down-time”, KRS-One continues to share his unique knowledge of Hip Hop to younger audiences eager to hear the ‘teacha’ speak. Operating as a kind of “pop-up” school, KRS-One’s Temple of Hip Hop has appeared in various cities in USA also in the UK and Europe offering the more serious student of Hip Hop an effective way to live and understand the culture of Hip Hop more deeply.\n\nJorge \"Popmaster Fabel\" Pabon\n\nJorge \"Popmaster Fabel\" Pabon was born and raised in NYC’s Spanish Harlem where at an early age he developed his dance and choreography career at Hip Hop jams and clubs throughout the city.

She grew up in a small neighborhood now known as “Scrilla Hill” in a somewhat sticked two parent household. Being introduced to Disney films and Michael Jackson before the age of one she developed the love for music, dance and theater which she would later attend programs after school and junior high school for. Growing up in the 90’s hip hop and R&B was at its peak and Antha developed a love for both. In her teenage years she sang lead in her church choir. And soon began writing, arranging and singing songs on her own. At this time Antha also developed a huge love for animals, preferably cats. And most fictional characters and sounds affiliated with them\n\nApproaching the music scene with childhood friend ASAP FERG in 2019 she signed to his independent record label Sewer sounds as well as appeared on his single “Wigs” creating a major buzz for her as a new artist. Later that year she also signed a publishing deal with Roc Nation for her R&B writing skills.\n\nAntha has been working hard to perfect a new sound that she has created alongside her label mates who have become a family. Her sound is a mix of all the movies and music she had endured her entire life oh and cats, lots and lots of cats, making her sound as big as a movie. Antha is currently preparing for the release of a joint project towards the end of the year, Sewer Sounds Vol.1. This project will prepare the world for her many talents. Although she is the only female, she holds her own very well.\n\nDerrick Parker\n\nDerrick Parker is a former NYPD Detective and now #thehiphopcop, consulting on hip hop’s most notorious cases.\n\nMr. Parker has more than 20 years of experience in law enforcement, investigation, and executive protection. In the NYPD, he held the rank of detective first grade and has served as a detective for the Bronx Narcotics, the Brooklyn North Homicide, Cold Case Homicide, and the intel unit.\n\nAfter working undercover on numerous homicide cases, Mr. Parker was assigned to unsolved murder cases, including those of rap stars Biggie Smalls and Tupac Shakur. Because of his expertise, he was selected by the NYPD to design and implement a strategy to reduce violence in the rap and music industries. Subsequently, this strategy was adopted on a national level. Mr. Parker has worked closely with music stars, police departments, and federal agencies around the country to execute this first-of-its-kind strategy targeting an industry that has suffered from high-profile violence and unsolved homicides.\n\nSince retiring from the NYPD, Mr. Parker has run massive-scale events in which the security detail was wholly dependent on his skill and expertise to create a hands-on operation within the specifics of the event and in conjunction with the local police departments. Mr. Parker has also been asked to assist in high-profile cases such as the murder of the legendary hip-hop DJ Jam-Master Jay, since retiring from his post as a detective as well as other cases involving the NYC’s music industry and rap artists.\n\nTwo thousand and six welcomed the long-awaited release of Mr. Parker’s best-selling book, The Notorious C.O.P., both co-written by and about Mr. Parker’s personal life and his life as an NYPD detective and rap intelligence officer and how it all collided together, making him the nation’s leading expert concerning rap-related crimes and mysteries. Day to day, Derrick Parker is the chief investigator and CEO of Titanium Investigations, specializing in executive protection.\n\nRapsody\n\nIn the saturated market of music and entertainment, consumers live with a constant craving for outliers and one-of-ones. In the sphere of hip-hop, Rapsody is that outlier. The Jamla/Roc Nation artist has spent the better part of the present decade lapping peers and counterparts while mesmerizing fans whom still prefer their rhymes detailed and nutritious. The Snow Hill, North Carolina native has more than held her own alongside greats like Kendrick Lamar, Black Thought and the late Mac Miller (in 2011, she toured with Miller on his Incredibly Dope Tour). She has been broadcast and hailed by media giants––from NPR to USA Today to TIME Magazine to BET (2013’s Hip Hop Cypher) to NBC (The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, 2015). In 2014, XXL named her one of the 20 Greatest Female Rappers of All Time. The following year, Dr. Dre crowned her his “favorite female emcee.” In 2018, The Netflix/Mass Appeal 8 part documentary series, RAPSURE Rapsody is featured as the only female artist and role model in Episode 6. She toured with Big K.R.I.T. in 2019 and hit the road in 2020 for a tour to support her latest album Eve. The North Carolina native called the tour “A Black Woman Created This” continuing the theme of her sophomore LP of Black women empowerment. All of her hard work paid off as BET recognized her as the “Lyricist of the Year” at the 2020 Hip Hop Awards. Later in 2020, she was featured in Stevie Wonder’s song “Can't Put It In The Hands of Fate”. Rapsody is currently one the hosts for Revolt’s show “Off Top” alongside Tiger. This 4x Grammy Award winner is also active in philanthropy and plays an important role with social justice and social empowerment.\n\nThe one-of-one is Rapsody’s latest album EVE. Named after the Bible’s original woman, the summer release is dedicated to the celebration and empowerment of brown sistas worldwide. Each song is titled after a legendary black female. From the beautifully jazzy “MAYA” to the melanin-affirming “IMAN” to a summertime breezy “MICHELLE,” Rapsody’s latest–– produced primarily by 9th Wonder and Eric G of the Soul Council production team and featuring giant guests like J Cole, D’Angelo, Queen Latifah and GZA, to name a few––is a collector’s item in a current climate of disposable compositions.\n\nThe lead single “Ibtihaj” introduces the succeeding 16 tracks (including an interlude) and their historic theme. Rapsody’s pen accomplishes much as she weaves the story of the first black, Muslim woman to get an Olympic medal for fencing in the Rio 2016 games. The incomparable features of The GZA and D’Angelio make the track swing “it’s been a long time coming since we had someone swarming with the bees (Killah) the bird and the Killah bees.”\n\nThe follow-up track of “AFENI,” in the form of separate love letters to black men and women, smells award-winning. 9th Wonder’s sonic bed is made with the Deniece Williams classic “Free,” Tupac’s “Dear Mama” a capella and decorated by the golden vocals of New Orleans crooner PJ Morton. On “OPRAH,” Rapsody ensures that the girl party is as fun as it is inspiring. Over a stream of buoyant baselines, she and masked sparkler Leikeli47 spit with the freedom of ocean water. “It ain’t uncommon to borrow a dollar/Invite me over to eat with your mama/I like them checks with the commas on commas.”\n\nEVE is Rapsody’s third studio album, succeeding her 2012 debut The Idea of Beautiful and 2017’s Laila’s Wisdom, named after her grandmother, which featured a constellation of guests (Kendrick Lamar, Anderson Paak, Busta Rhymes, Musiq Soulchild, etc) and launched the spitter into a rap star. It was nominated for both a Best Rap Album and Best Rap Song GRAMMY. The groundwork laid prior to Laila’s Wisdom included her outstanding verse on Paak’s 9th Wonder-produced “Without U” (off of his beloved major label debut, Malibu) and her first GRAMMY nomination for her exceptional performance on Kendrick’s sophomore standout To Pimp A Butterfly. Rapsody would later earn an invitation from President Barack Obama and Herbie Hancock to perform at the International Jazz Fest with Aretha Franklin, Robert Glasper, Terrace Martin and Terri Lyne Carrington in honor of the late great Prince. With her finest work ready for release, the Carolinian’s horizon forecasts more triumph, success, and, most importantly, little brown girls around the world who will love themselves more. They will have Rapsody to thank.\n\nStatik Selektah\n\nStatik Selektah, the renowned DJ/Producer and mixtape maverick, has played a pivotal role in other artists’ careers, first making a name for himself through countless classic mixtapes in the early 2000s. As a full-fledged artist, Statik (the “Selektah” surname came later) has curated mixtapes for notable artists such as Akon, John Legend, Royce Da 5’9” & Q-Tip to name a few. In 2007, lawmakers started to take aim at mixtapes and anyone attempting to operate below their radar, and Statik had to pivot. As he explains, “Every month I was dropping big mixtapes, and it all just came to a halt.” Utilizing his masterful production skill set and ingenuity, Statik took his record label - Showoff Records - to the next level with the arrival of his debut album, Spell My Name Right. It was a major turning point in his flourishing career, allowing him to showcase his impressive ear for music while capturing the rising star’s ongoing journey from Massachusetts to hip-hop notoriety in New York City. Statik was consistently touring around the same time, dedicating the next eight years of his life (2009 - 2017) to the road. In 2015, he welcomed his baby girl, Harley. In that delicate dance between fatherhood and fame, he learned how to exist as a single parent during the pandemic in Brooklyn while making time for the things that mattered, like riding bikes with his daughter. From there, his prestige has grown considerably. His radio show (Showoff Radio (Sirius XM Shade 45)) is playing throughout the country; he’s produced beats for seminal figures in rap ranging from Joey Bada$$ and Wiz Khalifa, to Eminem, Action Bronson, Freddie Gibbs, late rapper’s Mac Miller, Sean Price, and Prodigy, to countless others; he’s a torchbearer of the boom-bap production style that made hip-hop a cultural movement, and the list goes on. It’s also important to note that Rockstar Games enlisted him as the DJ and Producer of Grand Theft Auto IV: “The Lost and Damned”, as well as 2 songs for Midnight Club: Los Angeles. To date, he’s released more than twenty projects, including nine studio albums (with his tenth opus and 2nd LP with Mass Appeal brewing), contributing to millions of records sold.\n\nLeBrandon Smith\n\nLeBrandon Smith (he/him) is a cultural curator and social impact leader born and raised in Brooklyn and Queens, respectively. Coming from the city, his efforts to bridge gaps, and build community have been central to his work, but most notably his passion for music has fueled his career. His programming has been seen throughout the city including historical venues like Carnegie Hall and The Museum of the City of NY.\n\nFrom an early age, LeBrandon was actively rooted in the community, his grandfather, Jacob N. Underwood, founded a church and school in the East New York section of Brooklyn— both of which still stand and operate today. After college, LeBrandon began his journey in service, landing his first job working as a Recreation Specialist at a family shelter. In this role, LeBrandon was tasked with providing children, teens, and young adults with positive, fun, and educational activities. From career-learning days at Twitter to starting a library at the shelter, the job ignited his passion for service. This fulfilling opportunity shaped some of LeBrandon’s core methods—collaboration and community decision-making.\n\nAfter working at the shelter, LeBrandon began working at Carnegie Hall in social impact and curating events and performances to spotlight artists in their programming. His work was pioneering, in 2020 he introduced the first Hip-Hop Masterclass to the venue’s 130-year history, bringing in Black Thought from The Roots. In 2021 Black Thought led the Masterclass for a second time. LeBrandon’s work garnered the attention of other institutions. For the Museum of the City of New York (MCNY), he curated “Soul of the City,” an intimate performance series showcasing live musical artists with an acoustic accompaniment that featured Topaz Jones.\n\nLeBrandon’s work remains at the intersection of Black music and the communities he serves. In 2021, he founded Really Just Hip-Hop (RJHH), a company created to help the world’s most prolific cultural institutions authentically engage with Black art. His mission is to ensure Black artists get their shine and connect them to wider audiences. LeBrandon hopes to expand programming for RJHH, and curate projects for artists and institutions around the world.\n\nEmerson Sykes\n\nEmerson is a senior staff attorney with the ACLU Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project where he focuses on First Amendment protections. He has served as counsel in multiple federal cases at the intersection of free speech and social justice. From 2019-2020, he was also host of At Liberty, the ACLU’s weekly podcast.\n\nPrior to joining the ACLU in 2018, he was a legal advisor for Africa at the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law (ICNL). In that role, he provided technical legal assistance to civil society leaders, government officials, law students, and other stakeholders from across Africa to improve the legal framework protecting the freedom of association, assembly, and expression on the regional and national levels. From 2012-13, he served as assistant general counsel to the New York City Council, where he worked to increase transparency for council members’ discretionary spending, and contributed to the council’s friend-of-the-court brief against the NYPD’s “Stop and Frisk” program. In 2011, Emerson was a senior policy fellow in the office of a Member of Parliament in Ghana. Emerson previously conducted research and wrote about U.S. foreign policy for The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, and worked for the National Democratic Institute’s Central and West Africa Team.\n\nEmerson holds a J.D. from the New York University School of Law, where he was a Root-Tilden-Kern scholar for public interest law, and a Master of Public Affairs degree from the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs. He earned his undergraduate degree in political science at Stanford.\n\nReuben Vincent\n\nReuben Vincent makes intellectual, socially conscious, and lyrically dexterous rap that firmly plants him next in line among the lineage of North Carolina MCS who’ve left their mark on the genre. Though the Charlotte rapper/producer is only 21 years old, he’s already hustled hard in his home state, releasing records with 9th Wonder, touring with Rapsody, and creating songs full of wisdom well beyond his years. In his growing catalog, Vincent deftly balances incisive social commentary, mature introspection, and sharp, allusion-heavy wordplay tailored for rap scholars. The Roc Nation signee knows where the form has been, and now he’s pushing it forward.\n\n“I want to be one of the greats,” Vincent says. “9th Wonder and Jamla Records are helping, and will continue to help me do that. Now that Roc Nation has put me on a bigger platform, I’ll get there.”\n\nLove Is War, Vincent’s first joint release with Jamla Records and Roc Nation, is a conceptual yet subtly constructed album that will put him at the forefront of debates about new rap greats. He unpacks relationships and romantic entanglements over warm, soulful beats from 9th Wonder, Young Guru, and other producers (himself included) whose work modernizes and morphs boom-bap. With polished and varied flows, he weighs the time spent on love against the hours necessary to pursue his art (“Feb13th”), examines our fascination with money (“Mon’e”), and finds the value of self-confidence (“Butterfly Doors”), a journey that he says is key to the record as a whole. “Instead of looking for love from others, I had to find the love within,” he says.\n\nVincent wouldn’t be here without both love and war. His parents fled Liberia during the country’s first civil war and settled in Charlotte, where they immersed him and his six younger siblings in West African culture and cuisine at vibrant cookouts and house parties. Afrobeat blared from the speakers, but Vincent fell in love with hip-hop while listening to 2Pac and B.I.G. in his father’s Cadillac. When two older cousins showed him Lil Bow Wow, he knew he wanted to rap. While friends played, got into mischief, or began their first steps down the wrong path, Vincent drew album covers and wrote rhymes. Even as a preteen, nothing deterred him from his goal. The stresses of being a first-generation American only fueled his desire to succeed.\n\n“Your parents sacrifice for you to have a better life, so you have to live up to that expectation,” Vincent explains. “While you’re trying to put on for your country, your ancestors, and your last name, there are all of these barriers, like racism and classism, that you encounter as a Black person. But first-generation kids are hustlers. We’re going to get it regardless.”\n\nAn honors student who kept his headphones glued to his ears, Vincent released his first mixtape at 13. Shortly after, an early fan sent his music to 9th Wonder, the celebrated North Carolina producer behind tracks for Jay-Z, Little Brother, and Kendrick Lamar. Vincent then spent high school dividing his extracurricular hours between recording at home and trekking to 9th Wonder’s studio. By the time he enrolled at North Carolina A&T, he’d released Myers Park (2017) and Boy Meets World (2020) on Jamla Records.\n\n“I don’t have memories of hanging out with my friends and getting into trouble. I was in the studio,” he says. “Instead of going to prom, I went to meet Kendrick Lamar.”\n\nNo longer in school, Vincent has traded writing essays for composing the witty, poignant, and smooth verses on Love Is War. The accolades will surely come, but for now, he’s focused on being an example to his peers and, especially, representing fellow first-generation Americans. On record and in his career, he hopes to prove you can be brilliant without sacrificing your swagger. For Vincent, being a dedicated student of your craft and your self is how you win the war.\n\nApril Walker\n\nApril Walker is a fashion icon, entrepreneur, educator, and author whose work has been featured in Forbes, In Style, Essence, The New York Times, Drink Champs, Vogue, CFDA.
