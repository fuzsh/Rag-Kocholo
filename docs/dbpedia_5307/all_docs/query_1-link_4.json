        "text": "Wiz Khalifa has enlisted the help of Mustard for a new single titled “Bammer.” The track blends jazz-based production with Mustard’s signature bounce as Wiz delivers another batch of weed raps.\n\n“Don’t give me no bammer weed/We don’t smoke that shit, it’s TGOD,” he declares on the hook.\n\nThe Taylor Gang boss’ latest song arrives a month after his It’s Only Weed Bro mixtape, which featured him rapping over classic instrumentals. Wiz put his own spin on Common’s “The 6th Sense” and Mobb Deep’s “Survival Of The Fittest” on the seven-track project.\n\nWiz also dropped a video for “Smokin Section” — his rendition of the DJ Premier-produced “6th Sense” — in February.\n\nStream the Mustard-assisted “Bammer” above and watch the “Smokin Section” video below.\n\n[apple_news_ad type=”any”]"
