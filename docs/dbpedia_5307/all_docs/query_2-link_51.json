It will hit stores at midnight (Friday) but he’s giving a chance to fans to stream the album early on soundcloud.\n\nThe album is star studded to say the least. Preceding the album, the veteran DJ released a bunch of songs including ‘Wild One‘ with Rick Ross & 2 Chainz, ‘Cold Summer‘ with Mac Miller, Kevin Gates & Kendrick Lamar, ‘Jealousy‘ with Busta Rhymes, The Game & Tech N9ne and more."
