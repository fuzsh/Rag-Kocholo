        "text": "When you have the ability to swoon and croon your way into a woman’s heart, you’re able to break down a multitude of barriers within a lady. That’s a power that even the great Christopher Reeves and Peter Parker lacked in their arsenal. While some R&B heartthrobs delve in, penning records to soothe the psyche of your everyday female, Taylor Gang’s Ty Dolla $ign reaches his female audience in a different way. He injects a dose of fun in every record, in hopes of making the party rock.\n\nWith a slew of bangers and a resume rapidly growing — he’s featured on tracks with Lupe Fiasco and Meek Mill so far this year — it’s not surprising why Ty’s bank account is oozing with dollar signs. While the ever so popular hip-hop adage “Mo Money, Mo Problems” is applicable to a majority of artists in the culture, the Los Angeles crooner has been too busy performing on late night shows for Jimmy Fallon, and celebrating the success of his recent EP, entitled Beach House, to even worry about the cons of the music industry.\n\nThe multi-faceted artist is another reason why Cali continues to stampede its way onto the game. With DJ Mustard’s infectious beats and TDE’s unstoppable momentum, in the eyes of Ty Dolla Sign, his state is clamoring its way as the hottest region in the music scene. Following releases from Kendrick, ScHoolboy Q, and most recently YG, Ty’s debut album Free TC is highly anticipated… thanks to singles like “Paranoid” and the growing “Or Nah”\n\nHe sat down with us to discuss his relationship with super producer DJ Mustard, Drake’s decision to jump on “Or Nah,” his top five Cali artists, and how to remain paranoid free in a relationship.\n\nWe know that you’re a talented dude and that you play various instruments growing up, right?\n\nYes sir. I’ve always played a lot of instruments. I started off with the drums, then bass, then guitar, and then the keys. Then I got into making beats and DJ’ing and all that stuff, you know? I’m pretty fluent with basically every instrument, except like the bass and horns and stuff like that. I could even get down on the piano a little bit, you feel me? (Laughs)\n\nThat’s dope. Do you have a particular favorite instrument?\n\nNah. I just like making full songs. Like, from everything, like to the drums, all the way to the melodies, to the vocals, I like doing the whole thing. I like seeing the whole thing come to life and then going out and performing the [songs] people dance to, you know?\n\nI hear you. You’re a singer, producer, and songwriter. Which of the three do you have more enjoyment in doing?\n\nUmmm. Ahhh, all of it. Like I said, it’s the whole process. You know, all the way from the verse, to the first word of the song, to maybe the first melody of the song and then hearing a whole crowd room full of people sing it. It’s just the whole process now. I’m in love with it all. And now, even past that, like going to each radio station and kicking it with the DJ, and going up to the schools talking to kids about it. It’s all about the different audiences you could get. So, everything is fine to me. I just love doing it — the whole process.\n\nYou had the “My Cabana” track with Jeezy in 2012. Right now you have “Paranoid” with DJ Mustard, and “Or Nah” with Wiz. How does it feel to have major co-signs backing you like Wiz and Jeezy, among other notable peers?\n\nMan, it feels good man to know that my peers flex with my music and I can consider Wiz as fam. That’s crazy. Like, people like Jeezy would text me and I used to listen to his stuff for years. To have him even want to hop on one of my tracks is incredible to me. You know, seeing Mustard’s whole growth, that was like he was YG’s DJ and I was making all of YG’s beats. He kept watching me make beats and was like one day, “Tell me how this sounds.” His whole start to where he is now is crazy because it’s only been three years dog. And, he didn’t even make beats back then, like when we first started off and we made “Toot It and Boot It.” Now, he’s like taking over the whole country, you feel me? So, that’s incredible too. This whole experience is like “Wow (laughs).\n\nWhat’s the best piece of advice Wiz or any industry vet gave you coming up?\n\nWiz’s best advice was for me doing shows. It was try to do something that’ll make the crowd make noise rather than telling them, “Everybody make some noise!”, you know what I’m saying? I was like, “Ok! That’s some real [stuff].” Like you’ll hear every rapper, R&B singer, or entertainer be like, “Everybody make some f*cking noise!” Like, let your music do that for you. (Laughs) Like you’ll see somebody do some amazing sh*t, and that’ll be such a better feeling as an artist, you know?\n\nIf you had to give us your top five Cali artists right now, who would you choose and why?\n\nI’m gonna give you Kendrick. He’s the best lyricist. I’m gonna give you YG. I’m gonna give you Schoolboy Q. His album is incredible. Joe Moses, he’s also one of the most incredible dudes out there. He got the streets on lock. And then, myself, you already know.\n\nBecause you have the hit single “Paranoid”, for the lovers out there, how would you recommend the best ways in eliminating paranoia in a relationship?\n\nI think everything sums up to one thing and that’s telling the truth — keeping it real and keeping it 100. There’s like five different ways you can say that. If you go around and tell two to three girls that you love them or you’re in love with them or if you let a girl stay over and start cooking for you, washing your dishes or doing all your [things] for you, of course she’s going to think that you’re something. And, that’s where a lot of dudes mess up. When I wrote that song, I thought it was going down. But, it didn’t because I haven’t been lying. I’ve been keeping it all the way 100. I’ve been like “Yo, listen… I’m not trying to do no relationship type [stuff]. We can kick it. We can have sex. We can eat sometimes. But, I don’t need you to do none of my [things] for me. I got this by myself. I’m a grown ass man.”\n\nIn addition to Paranoid, you have your single “Or Nah”, which received the remix treatment and is set to have Drake, Weeknd, and Wiz Khalifa. Talk about how that remix came together.\n\nDrake hit me the other day, and was like, “Yo man, ‘Or Nah’ is incredible.” I was like, “Man!” I had some records I tried to get him to hop on, and he was like, “Yeah. I’m going to take a listen.” I guess he was in France or somewhere. The next day he texted me like, “Yo… this ‘Or Nah’ is haunting me dog.” I was like, “F*ck it, let’s make the official remix.” He was like, “Fo’ sho.” So, the next day he texted me like, “Yo man, I just spazzed on ‘Or Nah’.” I haven’t heard it personally, but I already know he’s going to destroy that [track]. I’m excited.\n\nThat’s going to be crazy. I know the fans can’t wait to hear it.\n\nOh yeah, me, Wiz, Drake, Weeknd, all on one song with Mustard? That’s gonna be like WHOA! (Laughs)\n\nWord is that you already started working on your debut album. What can fans expect?\n\nYeah man. I probably have like eight songs already for it. I think I’m going to keep it at 10. I’m probably gonna do some more or eliminate songs I already got for some better ones. But, I got eight definite murderers. Kendrick is on there so far. Of course, I’m gonna have DJ Mustard’s production and my production. I’m also trying to get Fergie on there from the Black Eyed Peas… hopefully. That’s the homie right there. I guess that’s it. That’s all I could talk about from the album standpoint, but it’s going to be amazing. It’s going to be called Free TC. It’s dedicated to my little bro and all the other homies locked up for [stuff] that they didn’t do and wrongly accused type [stuff]. So, I’m just trying to bring awareness to that. And it’s going to be crazy.\n\nLink.\n\n“Bounce,” might have been the most-used command during Schoolboy Q‘s epic performance at Pitchfork Fest this weekend. When he takes the stage, he’s not there just to perform for the audience, he wants to party with them. It’s that infectious energy that makes him so much fun to watch, and it’s part of the reason no one in the music world can keep their eyes off him. As one of the signees to Top Dawg Entertainment aka T.D.E., Schoolboy has every reason to celebrate. He has played a major part in the West Coast revival for hip-hop fans. After Kendrick Lamar put out his musical opus entitled Good Kid M.A.A.D. City on the same label in 2012, he figuratively shipped the hip-hop throne back to California. With that album, Kendrick set high standards for the music industry, and for his label-mates as well.Schoolboy Q adeptly rose to the challenge.\n\nWhen Schoolboy Q released his debut studio album Oxymoron, it debuted at No. 1. That was a feat not even Kendrick’s album achieved. With massive singles like “Man of the Year,” and “Collard Greens,” Schoolboy undoubtedly solidified himself as a top tier rapper, gracing the cover of Billboard and taking off on a headlining tour. Besides his own clever, hard-hitting verses, he also linked up with former Pulse On Who’s Next feature, Tinashe to contribute a verse to her banger “2 On.” Never sleeping, he knocked out a verse for Wiz Khalifa’s summer smash “We Dem Boyz.” While it would be easy for SchoolBoy to sit back and bask in his success, he signed on for a world tour that is no joke: he’s currently in the midst of a 75-show run. You’d expect someone halfway through that kind of challenge to be conserving energy. Rest assured, Schoolboy’s got more juice than a generator. We were lucky enough to catch up with him and chat about TDE’s legacy, his favorite Cali rappers, Hunger Games’ Jennifer Lawrence, and how he feels after having a number one album. Get to know him below.\n\nIf you could give us your Top 5 California rappers of all time, who would you choose and why?\n\nTop 5 Cali rappers of all time?! Snoop Dogg, of course. I would say E-40. I would say DJ Quik. Ice Cube. Tupac ain’t from California though. He was representing the South until he moved on. But, you know what; yeah you can say he’s Cali’. So yeah, Tupac.\n\nYour group TDE is considered one of the top groups right now in hip-hop. Where do you think you rank among groups like G-Unit, Death Row, Roc-A-Fella?\n\nHopefully at the top. But, I mean, if we don’t, then it’s okay. We were successful and people loved it. As long as the people are still coming out to shows, that’s all that matters. It lets you know that you’re loved. If you can bring people out to the show, that means you’re doing something good, you know?\n\nSpeaking of your shows, what can people expect when they get tickets to see Schoolboy?\n\nI freestyle my shows. I don’t have a real show. I just feed off the people, and they already know all the words. So, I can just play the songs and let them rap. The shows are more of a hangout than anything. There’s no band, there’s no crazy background, there’s no dancey-dance, or fancy lights. I’m gonna shake hands and touch the people. It’s a way to have fun instead of going to the movies or something. People need to have fun.\n\nWhat does the success of your album Oxymoron feel like?\n\nI’m not surprised. It’s tight knowing I had a No. 1 album in the country and being the only person from California to do that since Game dropped his album. It was great for California to see that No. 1 in the country. For my name to be a part of that history – you know it was Snoop [Dogg], it was [Dr.] Dre, it was [The] Game, and then it was Q. I’m one of those dudes that had a No. 1 debut. That’s kind of tight.\n\nIf you could pick any actor to play you in your biopic, who would you choose and why?\n\nAh, man. That’s hard. Number one, they gotta be ugly. They gotta be fat. They gotta be short. You know, it’s hard to pick somebody like me.\n\nIn a past interview, you’ve admitted to having a crush on actress Jennifer Lawrence from The Hunger Games. If you had the opportunity to take her out on a date, what would a date with her be like in the eyes of SchoolBoy Q?\n\nOn a date? Probably sit on my tour bus and chill. (Laughs) But seriously, I have to reserve my energy for shows. I’m set to do 75 shows, so I don’t really go out as much. When I do go out, I like to have fun and be secluded. I like feeling like a regular guy. I don’t like to be in that light anymore when I’m out. Basically you wanna chill sometimes, you know?\n\nHow do you keep performances fresh with so many dates?\n\nIt’s more of an adrenaline rush every time I hit the stage. I can be tired as hell but when I walk on the stage and hear the people scream, they’re expecting a good show. I don’t like letting the kids down. I have a daughter. So it’s like if I don’t want to do anything, but she wants to go somewhere, she gives me a sad look. In a sense, it’s kind of like that. No matter how tired I get, I have to do it for them. So I put my heart into it.\n\nLink\n\n“I’m like Kyrie Irving,” says DJ Mustard. His confidence permeates the room. It’s not Mustard’s fault that every time you turn the dial a record of his is playing; between “Up, Down,” “Nana,” or “2 On,” we guesstimate you’re destined to hear at least two a day.\n\nMaybe because all last year, Mustard was the seasoning of choice, your new-favorite-producer’s flavorful sound transcending the underground onto bouncy, radio-friendly beats for the likes of Trey Songz, YG, Tinashe, T-Pain, Young Jeezy, Tyga, and more. Like Kyrie Irving, DJ Mustard’s moves were often imitated by others, but with little success. And then he finds new ways to flip that sound on a regular basis, making him even more unique.\n\nNowadays, many producers flutter at the sight of Mustard because he’s everything they’re striving to be right now.\n\nHe sat down with us and broke down some of his biggest hits and how each track magically came together.\n\nTinashe, “2 On,” feat. ScHoolboy Q\n\nI was in New York. I was with one of the labels. I kind of just walked into the office. They were like, “We have this girl and her name is Tinashe. She’s got a song. We want you to reproduce it.” I was like, “Uh, alright.” But I didn’t take it serious. They said it hadScHoolboy Q on it. It’s a big song.\n\nMike WiLL [Made-It] had already told me about the record. He was like, “If you don’t re-do it, it’s gonna sound like a knock-off. So when they tell you about it, you’ll know.” I was like, “Cool.”\n\nSo when I went to the label I was like, “Yo, somebody said that I need to do this.” I liked the song. I took it to the studio, rearranged some stuff, added some sound to it, and it took off. When Drake hopped on it, it was cool.\n\nT-Pain, “Up Down (Do This All Day)” feat. B.O.B\n\nHis A&R hit me and he was like, “I’m working with T-Pain. Can you send us some beats?” I was more excited when Rihanna was dancing to it than when it came out.\n\nTy Dolla $ign, “Paranoid,” ft. B.O.B.\n\n[Ty Dolla $ign]’s my bro. We do a lot of stuff together. It was one day where he was like, “I got this song,” and he played it for me. I was like, “Oh that’s cool.” Then he was like, “You could put it on your tape too.” I put it on my Ketchup tape, and he put it on his EP Beachhouse, and it just took off.\n\nTrey Songz, “Nana”\n\nThat was real smooth. I did the beat the day before I gave it to Trey. So I did a couple of beats and I went over to Trey’s crib. I was playing him beats and stuff on my computer. Then, him and Sam Hook were just vibing to it and they came up with the record so quick out of nowhere. I was like, “Man, this a hit.”\n\nI had a record on Trey’s [album] before that. I don’t know if it’s ever gonna be released. But, I had a record for him before that and it wasn’t like, “Ah, this is a smash.” You know what I’m saying? Now, this record, this record was big and it blew up real fast.\n\nYG, “My Hitta,” feat. Young Jeezy and Rich Homie Quan\n\nThat record took a long, long time. We were in Burbank, California, at the studio. We were going to the studio every day working on his album. I played him the beat. He was like, “It’s cool.” Then, months and months later, I was in Atlanta with him. We were scrolling through beats and I was like, “You remember this beat?” I said, “Man, you should do this song right here. This is the beat.” He was like, “Alright.” Then, Rich Homie Quan happened to walk in; Jeezy had sent Rich Homie Quan to the studio. Once he walked in, he just went in there and gave us the hook. And then, YG did a verse and Jeezy did his verse. Quan did his verse the same time he did the hook. Then it was gone.\n\nLink.\n\nAb-Soul is your quintessential human dictionary. Why you ask? It’s because his verbosity is unreal. Soul’s command of the human language and immaculate ability to maneuver words in scintillating fashion, has earned him the reputation of being a top-tier lyricist in rap. The rap game has encountered innumerable acts that provided an array of tongue-twisting and mind-boggling lyrics in the past, yet, they haven’t seen anything like the man birthed Herbert Anthony Stevens IV.\n\nWith TDE’s Kendrick Lamar and ScHoolBoy Q bathing in the pool of mainstream success, to say that Ab-Soul – who TDE dubs as their secret weapon – won’t be the next one to take a dip and get his feet wet, is beyond unfathomable. His previous endeavors Longterm Mentality and Control System had fans gallivanting around the web in search of more. After months of endless pushbacks, Soul was able to find the resolution he needed and is ready to deliver his new album, These Days in August.\n\nWith his gift of gab serving as his selling point, he showcased his talents on his first single “Stigmata” featuring Action Bronson. He provided fans even more excitement when he recently released “Hunnid Stax” featuring his TDE teammate, ScHoolBoy Q. As the momentum continues to tip over in Soul’s favor, it appears that Top Dawg will have another All-Star earning his just due in the world of music.\n\nAb-Soul sat down with us me discuss his new album These Days, his love for Dawson Creek, Bone Thugs and Harmony introduced him to music, his origin of his rap name, and why he would travel to Jerusalem on a date.\n\nWe know Jay Z played a big role. We know Nas played a big role. But when did you fall in love with hip-hop?\n\nAb-Soul: “Crossroads”, by Bone Thugs and Harmony. I grew up in a record shop and my perception of music as a child was probably different than most people. It was my grandpa, magic disc music. So, I was introduced to hip-hop a little later, and different, we couldn’t really play- my parents didn’t really play music at the house, cause we were listening to it all day because we were selling it. We couldn’t really listen to popular hip-hop because of the profanity. When I was like, 11 or 12, sneaking away to hear the curse words and just listen for real instead of working- that’s one of the earliest songs that touched me and I got it. I got it. I got the concept. I saw the video and I saw what the words were doing. They were real melodic and soulful.\n\nI know you didn’t really have a stereotypical “I came from the hood” – I know you were from Germany then you moved over to Cali.\n\nAb-Soul: Yeah, actually I was born in Cali (Kaiser Harbor City, for sure). My father immediately joined the army and I was living out there [Germany] for like 4 or 5 years, and then my mom and dad split and then I came right back to California.\n\nHow did your location mold you growing up?\n\nAb-Soul: Well, Carson is right between Compton and Long Beach. Carson is LA. It’s pretty much LA. There’s definitely – or a, reminiscent of the two. Carson is like, that’s the hood. It’s the spot. It’s what I love. There ain’t too many words to describe it.\n\nWe’re curious about this. Let’s take it back. Do you remember what your first punch-line was?\n\nAb-Soul: Man, that’s a good one. If I was to really go back in time. Damn. That’s tight, too. I said something like, when I was in high school; I had a freestyle that I put up on Soundclick. I think I said something like, ‘Keep trees in my boots like Timberlands.’ Like, Timberland Boots. Something like that. I see the effect. Like, those eyes light up. Yeah, that was probably around the Cassidy era, too. He was like the Punch-Line King.\n\nKendrick calls you the human dictionary. Do you feel like you have the largest vocabulary in hip-hop?\n\nAb-Soul: Ah, no. There are a lot of artists that can speak several different languages. I only got one. But nah, I just like words a lot. I talk a lot. We have a lot of conversations. I reason a lot. I like to learn. I probably have a pretty decent vocabulary-vernacular.\n\nBecause I know you said you like to read a lot. What books have inspired you?\n\nAb-Soul: I actually didn’t read that much because my eyes aren’t that great. I’m not like blind but my eyes aren’t that great. One of the first books that really got me going was the autobiography of Malcolm X. That’s something that really opened my eyes to a lot of the stuff that you hear me talk about today. It’s a great book; the Alchemist is also a great book.\n\nSo let’s talk about the name, Ab-Soul. Where did it come from? Why that name?\n\nAb-Soul: It derives from absolute. It’s actually a very long story. I would like everyone to look back to Longterm 1 for the story, full length details – that was my first project. It should be on the internet somewhere. Some nice extensive detail about how I came up, real spiritual in a sense, you know what I’m saying? You got to think, too- my name is Herbert. Herbert Anthony Stephens the IV- that’s not going to work in the game.\n\nAre you going to keep the tradition going?\n\nAb-Soul: Yes. Why not? Do you know a V?\n\nIf you could pick any classic Hollywood film you could star in, what would you star in?\n\nAb-Soul: Well, Enter the Void is my favorite movie. I would star in that.\n\nPepsi: Why?\n\nAb-Soul: It’s just a great flick. Shot entirely in first person. Just a great movie, in terms of film in general. The concept is amazing, too. The plot and everything. The film of it is just amazing.\n\nPepsi: So, let’s take it back to the music. How did it feel to see your fans on Twitter fighting to get your album out?\n\nAb-Soul: More than an agitation. I have it. I want people to know I have it. I’m a part of a business. I’m a part of a company- Top Dawg Ent. I expect them to handle it with as much care as possible. As they do. It’s been like, two years since my last project. I didn’t want anybody to think I was asleep. I had a collab project that didn’t turn out that well on the business side. I turned this one in at the top of this year. Q got a date and we wanted to push forward. So we have to push everyone. Everything we do we have to push everyone’s focus. We got some new acts with SZA and [Isaiah] Rashad. Even Jay Rock is working on his new album. We’re all taking our time.\n\nWe loved how you took the record with Action Bronson (“Stigmata”) and referenced it back to Nas with “The Cross.” What made you want to do that?\n\nAb-Soul: I mean, if you know the definition of stigmata, it’s like second nature to me. I reference Nas a lot. I probably reference him a couple times in the project. I like to reference a lot of my favorite things, quotes and stuff.\n\nFor your album These Days, what made you want to go with that title?\n\nAb-Soul: I wanted something timeless and open ended. Reflect on how you feel.\n\nWe know you said you had the album done since the top of the year. At this point, have you gone back in and touched it up?\n\nAb-Soul: Yeah, since I have more time, since we’ve decided to give it more time, I went back in and recorded some more songs. “Stigmata” was one of them.\n\nAre you happier with it?\n\nAb-Soul: Absolutely. It’s more extensive now. I think I nailed it.\n\nYou and Kendrick have a record from a while back called “Rapper S***” in which both of you two went back and forth at each other. Do you guys ever competitively go at one another in the studio, like, “Hey I’m gonna get you on this track?”\n\nAb-Soul: Nah. This is probably speaking for me and Kendrick in particular, it’s just kind of second nature to go hard. Period. It ain’t even like ‘I’m gunna kill you’- it’s just second nature to go as hard as possible and I hope you’re going to go hard. That was a while back.\n\nOff the wall, but, what was your favorite TV show from the 90s?\n\nAb-Soul: Probably like “All That.” I don’t watch too much TV. Oh! You know what’s a great show, “Dawson’s Creek.”(Starts singing) “I don’t wanna wait, for our lives to be over-“\n\nPepsi: I wouldn’t think you were a “Dawson’s Creek” fan.\n\nAb-Soul: Well, this girl I really liked was into it. So I was watching it, that type of shit. That shit was way hard. Katie Holmes was bad.\n\nIf you could pick any actress or celebrity crush to take out on a date to anywhere, who would you choose and why?\n\nAb-Soul: I would take Yaris Sanchez to Jerusalem.\n\nWhy?\n\nAb-Soul: The homie just told us he was going back to Jerusalem for his birth right. I want to go to Jerusalem.\n\nWhat’s the best studio experience you had outside of TDE?\n\nAb-Soul: Me and Mac Miller are tight. we smoke a lot of cigarettes and come up with a lot of great shit together. We joke a lot, have a lot of great laughs and good times."
