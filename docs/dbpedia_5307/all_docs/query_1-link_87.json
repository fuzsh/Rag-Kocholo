        "text": "After Wiz Khalifa announced that Rolling Papers 2: The Weed Album was in the works, ‘Burn Slow’ has appeared and is possibly the first single off the album. The track has been produced by prolific trap producer Mike Will Made-It and features Atlanta’s very own Rae Sremmurd.\n\nThe song is what you expect from a collaboration like this, a heavy trap beat, with the Sremmurd brothers singing hooks, whilst Wiz raps about his usual topics, money and weed. If ‘Burn Slow’ is appearing on Rolling Papers 2: The Weed Album then Khalifa fans have a release to readily look forward to.\n\nHave a listen to ‘Burn Slow’ in the gallery above and stay tuned for a release date of Rolling Papers 2: The Weed Album.\n\n[Via.]"
