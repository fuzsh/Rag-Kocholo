According to reports, the upcoming album will be produced by Havoc and The Alchemist. When Havok announced the upcoming album, he shared a video in the studio with The Alchemist.\n\n“R.I.P Prodigy,” said Havoc as music blared in the background. “You see Al in the background, you already know what it is. Mobb Deep coming soon, baby. Infinite.”\n\nThe upcoming album will be the duo’s ninth album. They released their last album in 2014, titled The Infamous Mobb Deep. The Alchemist began working with Mobb Deep in 1999 following an introduction by well-known recording artist Muggs.\n\nAs a producer, Havoc craved a legacy working with the biggest names in rap history, including Jay-Z, 50 Cent, Kanye West, and Nas. Havoc produced on Ye and Ty Dolla $ign’s Vultures album in 2024.\n\nMobb Deep rose to Hip-Hop prominence in the mid-90s with classic songs such as “Shook Ones, Part II,” “Quiet Storm,” and “Hell On Earth.” The duo is often referenced as one of the greatest rap groups ever. Mobb Deep’s history includes feuding with Tupac Shakur and Jay-Z and signing with 50 Cent’s G-Unit records in the early 2000s.\n\nRappers of this generation cite Prodigy as an inspiration. Wiz Khalifa, Eminem, and Joe Budden are among the rap stars who have discussed Prodigy’s influence on their music in interviews.\n\nAlthough he passed away in 2017, Prodigy has released six solo albums, the last of which was the posthumous album The Hegelian Dialectic 2: The Book of Heroine, released in September 2022. Havoc continues to carry the infamous Mobb Deep’s legacy into the next generation.\n\nThere’s no official release date on Mobb Deep’s upcoming album yet."
