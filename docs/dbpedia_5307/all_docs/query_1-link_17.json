        "text": "As many of you know, today marks the national stoner holiday 4/20, which is celebrated by many within the hip hop culture. One of the leaders of rap’s 4/20 movement is none other than Wiz Khalifa, who has been providing quality, smoke-friendly music for well over a decade. Today, he adds to his catalog with The Saga of Wiz Khalifa, a seven-track offering that sees additional appearances from Mustard, Megan Thee Stallion, Ty Dolla $ign, Quavo, Tyga, K Camp, and Logic. The project also features the previously released cuts “Bammer” and “Contact.”\n\nOne immediate standout from The Saga of Wiz Khalifa is “Still Wiz,” which — courtesy of Paul Cabbin, Tee Romano, and Hitmaka — flips a classic Dr. Dre cut for the Pittsburgh rapper to flex to:\n\n“I’m still Wiz, n***as got me in that mood, how they hatin’ when they know that I’m that dude/\n\nI hear they hatin’ ‘cause they know I got the juice, they like ooh, they watchin’ how I move/\n\nMotherf***ers, they be actin’ like we cool, f*** you, thought this was, n***a, I ain’t no fool/”\n\nAdding to the festivities, Wiz Khalifa is also headlining Weedmaps’ “Higher Together: Sessions from Home” virtual festival, which will see a DJ set and smoke session from the Taylor Gang head honcho. Ari Lennox, Dave East, Cam’ron, Stephen Marley, and more will also be showing up to the party, keeping things in the positive despite the current Coronavirus pandemic. Wiz spoke on the event via press release:\n\n“Super excited to hang with the Weedmaps smokers all over the world. I’m even more pumped to be able to share a new project on a holiday everyone loves.”"
