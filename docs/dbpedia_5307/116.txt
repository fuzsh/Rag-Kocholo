DJ and producer DJ Mustard has worked with everyone from Snoop Dogg, YG, Jamie Foxx, Jordin Sparks, French Montana, Rick Ross, Wiz Khalifa, Gucci Mane, Nipsey Hussle and Young Jeezy.

When Mustard was 11 years old, his uncle, a DJ, let him DJ at a family party. He got his DJ name from the condiment dijon mustard because his first name is also Dijon.

With the Christmas holiday here, he let me know what his most memorable Christmas was: a CDJ music player for DJing.
