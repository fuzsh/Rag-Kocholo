        "text": "“Balwant scored two goals tonight. He did what he was asked to do. He could have scored four but I will take two,” Constantine said after India’s 2-0 win in the Asian Cup Qualifier against Macau.\n\nHe termed it a “valuable win” considering the ultra- defensive tactic employed by the home team.\n\nREAD | Balwant Singh brace helps India beat Macau 2-0 in AFC Asian Cup qualifier\n\n“It was very difficult to break down their defence. It is a very valuable win for us. And we stay on top of Group A with 9 points. It was very hard as they were defending with 8 or 9 men. So we are happy with the 2-0 victory,” the Anglo-Cypriot coach said.\n\nConstantine’s boys have now remained unbeaten in eleven games on the trot since the AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers Playoff Round 1 match against Laos on June 2, 2016.\n\nIndia are scheduled to face the same opponents on October 10 in the return fixture in India."
