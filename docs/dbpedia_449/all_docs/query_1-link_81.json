        "text": "After having endured a disastrous season in the Indian Super League’s (ISL) fourth edition, ATK are in the process of revamping their squad.\n\nWith Pronay Halder and Ricky Lallawmawma already signed for the next season, the Kolkata franchise are close to roping in Balwant Singh.\n\nIt is reliably learnt that the 31-year-old, who has six goals from 1362 minutes in the ISL, will sign a two-year deal later this week.\n\nBalwant Singh will join the ‘crorepati’ club as it is believed that the Sourav Ganguly co-owned franchise have offered him a seven figure package per season.\n\nThe former JCT striker is one of the decorated players in the Indian football circuit having won the ISL and the I-League. He has also been part of the Federation Cup winning team on three occasions."
