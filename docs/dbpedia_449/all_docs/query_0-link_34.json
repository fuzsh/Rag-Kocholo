        "text": "\"In the Punjab in the sub- mountainous region the community came to be known as 'Saini'. It maintained its Rajput character despite migration.\" [1]\n\n\"The Sainis trace their origin to a Rajput clan of Chandravanshi Lineage who came from their original home near Mathura [sic] on the Jamuna, south of Delhi,They came to Panjab to thwart the repeated attacks of Ghazni's generals on this area on Hindus in the first Muhammadan invasions from there Origin land Mathura.These specific battles are said to be duly recorded in Tarikh-i-Alfi. \"[2][16]\n\nOrigin\n\nSaini(Gurmukhi-ਸੈਣੀ/Devnagri-सैनी) is a Rajput warrior caste of India and a prominent group among Sikhs. Sainis, also known as Shoorsaini in Puranic literature.The name \"Shoor\" Means 'Valiant' and \"Saini\" means 'Warrior'. Now it has been Reduced to just \"Saini\" Translating to 'Warrior'. Shoorsaini was the name of a Tomara-Yaduvanshi tribe which ruled areas surrounding Delhi, Mathura, Bayana and Bharatpur. They are now found by their original name only in Punjab(Shoorsaini's had moved to Punjab after the Mahabharata war) and in the neighboring states of Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. Sainis of Punjab and contiguous region trace their origin to a sub-tribe of the Yaduvanshi Kshatriyas/Jadon/Jadauns/Yādu/Yadava-Not to be Confused by Yadav Ahirs of Shudra Varna which embraced the Yadav Surname and started claiming association with the Ancient Yādu Dynasty much like the Mali Community who did the same with The Saini Community who are actually a sub-division of Chandravanshi/Somavanshi/Candravaṃśa/Lunar/Indu Dynasty Kshatriyas. In this sense they also share their with origin with Bhati Rajputs of Rajputana, Jadeja Rajputs of Gujrat and Seuna Yadavas of Devgiri in South India. Though it may appear strange how such culturally and geographically diverse groups could possibly have common origin, one has to keep in mind that the descendants of Yādu were a huge warrior clan distributed and diversified in many tribes and sub-tribes. After a common origin in Mathura, each Yadava tribe set on their own journey meeting varied fortunes as they chalked their unique destinies along a path of history that is at least three thousand years old. The Saini Sikhs are found in the sub-mountainous region of Punjab. They dominate in a significant number of villages in Hoshiarpur, Nawanshehr, Jalandhar, Ropar and Gurdaspur. The neighboring sub-mountainous districts of Haryana and Himachal Pradesh also have considerable Saini Sikh population. They are not found in any significant numbers in the lower and the interior Punjab, although the descendants of Sardar Nanu Singh Saini of Phulkian, who were a part of the Patiala nobility, at one time held one of the largest estates in the erstwhile princely state. Their real strongholds , however, are in the areas of Jalandhar and Bari Doabs where they exclusively own a large number of villages, and where they also held the Zaildari in the British era. They are descendant from Rajputs [3] of the Yaduvanshi [4] \"In a four-fold division of the Hindu social order, the Sainis are of Kshatriya origin. Among different groups of Kshatriya, the Sainis are the ones who are Rajputs.[5]Surasena[6] [7] lineage, originating from Yadava King Shoorsen, who was the grandfather of both Krishna and the legendary Pandava warriors and also by their folk memory of origin from Mathura which was the theo-political capital of the Shoorsaini kingdom founded by Yadava king Shoorsen in the time of Mahabharata. Sainis relocated to Punjab from Mathura and surrounding areas over different periods of time.[3] [8]\n\nThe ancient Greek traveller and ambassador to India, Megasthenes, also came across this clan in its glory days as the ruling tribe with its capital in Mathura. There is also now an academic consensus that the ancient King Porus, the celebrated opponent of Alexander the Great, belonged to this once most dominant Yadava sect. [9] [10][11] Megasthenes described this tribe as Sourasenoi. [12]\n\nŠúraséna was the grandfather of Krishna, and from him Krishna and his descendants, who held Mathura after the death of Kansa(Krishna's Uncle), derived their name as Šúrasénas or Shoorsainis.\n\nSainis ruled this kingdom ruled Mathura in a period ranging between 700 and 1100 CE(right up to the time of earliest Muhammadan invasions), is recorded by historians such as Cunningham. As per the historical and local accounts, when these Rajputs lost these battles and Lost there Rule during the war they had no choice other than facing slaughter or conversion to Islam. Now the Other Rajputs with Rule over a Province or State believed that A Rajput Without a Jagir is Not a Rajput(Jagir=Manor). And Some Rajputs converted under duress and started being addressed with the names such as Ranghars, Khanzadas, Ghauri Pathans, etc. Some, desperate to retain their estates and influence, started marrying their women to the Muslim conquerors as part of the prevalent \"Dola\" culture. This was considered a reprobate practice by the orthodox Hindus. These Rajputs among Mahtons were thus considered degraded and the inter-marriage between them and the other Rajputs stopped. This led to the birth of various endogamous groupings within the Rajputs.\n\nBefore the formation of Bharatpur state the capital of Sinsinwars was at Sinsini. Sinsini earlier was known as 'Shoor saini' and its inhabitants were known as 'Saur Sen'. The influence of Saur Sen people can be judged from the fact that the dialect of the entire north India at one time was known as 'Saursaini'. Shoor Sain people were Chandra Vanshi kshatriyas. Lord Krishna was also born in vrishni branch of Chandravansh. A group of Yadavas was follower of Shiv and Vedic God in Sindh. Some inscriptions and coins of these people have been found in 'Mohenjo Daro'. ' Shiv Shani Sevi' words have been found engraved on one inscription. Yajur Veda mentions 'Shinay Swah'. 'Sini Isar' was found on one gold coin. Atharva Veda mentions 'Sinwali' for Sini God. The above group of Yadavas came back from Sindh to Brij area and occupied Bayana in Bharatpur district. After some struggle the 'Balai' inhabitants were forced by Shodeo and Saini rulers to move out of Brij land and thus they occupied large areas.\n\nSome Rajputs living under the sword in the Muslim-ruled areas , however, took to nuancing their identities in various ways to escape conversion and \"Dola\" enforced ritual pollution targeted at the rebellious Rajput groups (and also Brahmins in some cases) . The Sainis are said to be one such Rajput group who took up agriculture in this era. Many of their clan names such as Badwal, Tirotia, Salaria, Dhamrait, Mangar, Darar, Gehlon, Tambar, Banwait and others are identical or very similar to those of the Rajputs found on the neighboring hills which suggests that both were at one time part of the same stock which later got fragmented into separate groups due to the reasons already mentioned. The comparative ABO distribution studies conducted on both the groups, which were published in the prestigious American Journal of Physical Anthropology in 1961, had confirmed identical genetic markers of both the groups, while at the same time showing significant differences between them and those of other leading castes of the area such as Jats, Aroras, etc. This also strongly indicates a common ancestry. The oral and historical accounts thus do have some scientific corroboration in this particular case.\n\nLike most other Rajput origin tribes of Punjab [13] , Saini's also took up farming during medieval period due to the Turko-Islamic political domination, and have been chiefly engaged in both agriculture and military service since then until the recent times.[14] During British period Saini's were enlisted as a statutory agricultural tribe as well as a martial class. [15] [16] [17]\n\n\"Sainis fought first as part of Rajputs and then as Sikhs. So their attire as warriors would have been indistinctive from them. Modern Sainis in the Indian Army wear the colors of their regimental units. In British era Sainis fought largely in Grenadiers , Sappers and Sikh Regiments. Subedar-Major Jagindar Singh Saini who was a hero of Battle of Loos in the World War 1 won Order of Brithish India and the title of 'Bahadur'. He wore gray and red stripes on the shoulders. Gurmukh Singh Saini won the Cross of St. George in the same battle which was worn around the neck. But these decorations were worn by all members of all groups who won military awards for gallantry.\n\nUntil recent times Saini's were strictly an endogamous Kshatriya group and inter-married only within select clans. [18] They also have a national level organization called Saini Rajput Mahasabha located at Delhi which was established in 1920. [19]\n\nSince 1931 the surname Saini is also used by Mali groups of Rajasthan and some other states. Officially started being known as Saini in 1937.These however are different from the Sainis that are found in Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu-Kashmir ,and Parts of Haryana. And have no marital links with them.\n\nTerminology\n\nPuranic and epical etymology\n\nVisnu Purana records the migration of some of the Yadava descendants and kinsmen of Lord Krishna from Mathura to Dwarka and from Dwarka to Punjab with the help of Prince Arjuna. [Visnu Purana , Section 5] These descendants and kinsmen of Lord Krishna are also referred in Puranic literature as Shaursaini or Shoorseni after Shoorsena (also spelt Sursena) who was paternal grandfather of Krishna and maternal grandfather of legendary Pandava warriors of Kuru clan.\" Saini appears to be etymologically derived from this Puranic and Mahabharta term and seems to be an abbreviated version of it.\"\n\nThe area around Mathura was also named \"Shaursena\" or Surasena in ancient time after this prominent Yadu clan chieftain. This suggests that Shoorsena , the claimed mythico-historical founder of Saini clan, must have had enough influence to have the entire principality, or \"Janapada\", named after him.\n\nNote: A later name of Surasena was also Sinsini. From which the Now Jat Clan of Sinsinwar orignated. The name Sinsinwar literally mean 'sons of Sinsini/Surseni'. The Sinsinwar clan trace their origin Maharaj Shursain of Vrishni clan. Vrishni was a clan of the ancient Yadu tribe. The Ancient Vrishni clan founded the kingdom of Suirsani in the Braj region. They abandoned the Braj region due to the frequent raids of Jarasanda (the King of Magadha) and under the leadership of Krishna migrated to the city of Dwarka (located on the Saurashtra coast). When the city of Dwarka submerged in the sea, a group of Vrishnis migrated to the Lower Sindh Valley. By the 3rd century A. D, the Vrishni made themselves master of a tract of country around Ludhiana, Punjab (several Vrishni coin dating to that era are discovered from Sunet. Ludhiana). During the 9th century this group resettled in the Braj region and made Bayana their headquarters.\n\nBefore the formation of Bharatpur state the capital of Sinsinwars was at Sinsini. Sinsini earlier was known as 'Shoor saini' and its inhabitants were known as 'Saur Sen'. The influence of Saur Sen people can be judged from the fact that the dialect of the entire north India at one time was known as 'Saursaini'. Shoor Sain people were Chandra Vanshi kshatriyas. Lord Krishna was also born in vrishni branch of Chandravansh. A group of Yadavas was follower of Shiv a Vedic God in Sindh. Some inscriptions and coins of these people have been found in 'Mohenjo Daro .... The above group of Yadavas came back from Sindh to Brij area and occupied Bayana in Bharatpur district. After some struggle the 'Balai' inhabitants were forced by Shodeo and Saini rulers to move out of Brij land and thus they occupied large areas.\"\n\n-Encyclopaedia Indica: India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Volume 100, pp 119 - 120, SS Sashi, Anmol Publications, 1996\n\nThe etymology and origin of the term can be broken down as follows:\n\nDevi Bhagvat Purana describes Kunti as the princess of Shoorseni Pradesh [Devi Bhagwat Purana, Chapter2, pp 41, Published by Diamond Pocket Books (P) Ltd.] :\n\nShaursen (also spelt in English as Surasena) ---> The kingdom ruled by Shoorsen or Sursen\n\nShaurseni (also spelt variously in English as Shoorseni and Shaursaini) ---> The Yadava clansmen and lineal descendants of Shoorsen or Sursen.\n\nSaini---> Abbreviated version of Shoorsaini or Shoorseni.\n\nIn the Mahabharta, Sage Vyasa clearly identifies Krishna as Shoorseni [Mahabharata, Book 13, Chapter 147] :\n\n\"Foremost among all the Shoorsenis , the powerful one, Krishna, residing at Dwaraka, will rule and protect the whole earth after vanquishing all her lords, conversant as he will be with the science of polity.\" It is noteworthy that Ved Vyasa identifies Krishna as Shoorseni even though he was to be in Dvarka which was far away from Shaursena, or Shoorseni Pradesh, the \"janapada\" . This signifies that Ved Vyasa is referring to a dynasty and a clan, not merely to a geographical region. It is the migration of some of the members of this very clan to Punjab that Visnu Purana records in section 5.\n\nDevi Bhagvat Purana describes Kunti as the princess of Shoorseni Pradesh [Devi Bhagwat Purana, Chapter2, pp 41, Published by Diamond Pocket Books (P) Ltd.] :\n\n\"....while the names of Pandus wives were , Kunti, the princess of Shoorseni Pradesh...\" Srimad Bhagvat Purana identifies Shoorsena as the chief of Yadu dynasty [SRIMAD BHAGAVATAM by Krsna-Dwaipayana Vyasa (Translation: A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada & others, Cantos 10, Chapter Seventeen - The Supreme Lord Agrees to Become Aditi's Son, verse 27] :\n\n\"...Formerly, Shoorsena (Surasena), the chief of the Yadu dynasty, had gone to live in the city of Mathura.

Assisted by the descendants of Bhoja, Vrsni, Andhaka, Madhu, Shoorsena, Dasarha, Kuru, Srnjaya and Pandu, Lord Krsna performed various activities...\" Yudhisthra identifies Shoorsena as his grandfather, and Krishna's father, Vasudeva, as his maternal uncle in Srimad Bhavat Purana [SRIMAD BHAGAVATAM by Krsna-Dwaipayana Vyasa (Translation: A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada & others, Chapter Eleven, Lord Krsna's Entrance into Dvaraka, verse 26] :\n\n\"...Is my respectable grandfather Shoorsena in a happy mood? And are my maternal uncle Vasudeva and his younger brothers all doing well?...\"\n\nOther Name:-(Shura Rajputs,Surasenas,Sourasenoi,Shoorsainis,Suraseni)\n\nKansa\n\nKansa(brother of Krishna's mother Devaki), the first major king of Northern India, was from this dynasty. By virtue of his might, he declared himself as the first king of Mathura. Acknowledging his superiority, the famous king Jarasandha of Magadha, who had established his lordship in the eastern region of India by subduing many independent kingdoms, offered his two daughters in marriage to Kansa. Thus, the first empire of pre-historic or Proto-history India was established by Kansa, the scion of Shoorsaini dynasty. Kansa performed the famous Ashwamedha Yagna and set his horse moving and his armies followed the horse under his personal command and was away for twelve years from the capital “Shoorpur” in the city of Mathura. The site of king Kansa's capital city was discovered by Colonel James Todd, the author of the Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan.\n\nIn the Mahabharata's 18th Parva (\"Chapter\"), the sons of king Kansa are mentioned to be alive. Moreover even after the killing of Kansa the kingdom was given back to his father, Ugrasena who ruled Mathura. Mathura still teems with the remains and relics of king Kansa. In the city of Jhajjar (Haryana), there are about 150-200 families who trace their descent from Kansa.\n\nSourasenoi: Greek account of ancient Saini royal clan\n\nA Non-Indian account of this ancient royal tribe has also survived. Megasthenes, the Greek ambassador to India in 4 BCE transliterated the name Shoorsaini into 'Greek' as 'Sourasenoi', saying that they were worshipers of Lord Krishna whom he identified as none other than the Greek Demi-God 'Herakles' (ed. Hercules).[20][17] [12]:\n\n\"This Herakles is held in special honour by the Sourasenoi, an Indian tribe, who possess two large cities, Methora and Cleisobora\"\n\nSource: James Tod, Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan [12]\n\nEvidence from Puranas and Mahabharata\n\nIbbetson's account does not reference Puranic sources.[21] [22] which provide a more compelling theory for the origin of the term 'Saini'. One thing Ibbetson's account does very well on is providing the evidence that his informant had distinct recollection of the origin of his community in Mathura, which falls in a principality originally known as Shaursena or Surasena. It would appear that if both Ibbetson and his informant had been aware of the ancient name of the region where Mathura is located, they would have been able to easily connect the term, 'Saini' with 'Shaursaini', rather than offering an unnecessary spin around the term 'Rasaini' which leaves a lot more to be explained [ There is no such word as \"Rasai\" in Hindi or Punjabi vocabularies , meaning \"skill\". It simply appears to be a concoction of the colonial informant. The term 'Saini' appears to be an abbreviated version of the term 'Shaursaini' which is used in Mahabharta and Puranas to describe the Yadava clan Krishna was born in. The term 'Saini', based on both phonetics and the geographical location of Mathura, appears to have more uncanny resemblance with the Mahabharta term 'Shaursaini' than any other term that can be imagined [Interestingly the geogpraphical location of Sainis appears to be totally corroborated by Mahabharta account of west ward migration of Shoorsenis (Shoorsainis): \"...The eighteen tribes of the Bhojas, from fear of Jarasandha, have all fled towards the west; so also have the Shoorsenis...\"(\"Mahabharata, Book 2, Chapter 14) ] [Even if Ibbetson's speculation is held to be valid for argument sake. It is contradicted by Amir Khusro's Ghurratu-L-Kamal account which records a senior Saini General in a Sisodia Rajput force as late as 14th century CE. Based on Amir Khusro's Ghurratu-L-Kamal narrative, the Rajput origin of Sainis assertion, sceptically expressed in Ibbetson's own anecdotal account, becomes more valid and plausible. Incidentally, Seuna Yadavas of Maharashtra and Karnataka also claim their descent from the Mathura region of the ancient Shaursena, whence Sainis also claim their descent. According to the Visnu Purana account cited in an ensuing section of this article, Arjuna settled \"some\" of the Yadava families in Punjab, implying that there were most likely other Yadavas from the submerged city of Dwaraka who dispersed away in other parts of the country.\n\nIt appears neither Ibbetson nor his informant were properly trained in the textual sources of ancient Indian history and mythology to make these irrisistible connections and to carry out a deeper and more informed analysis.\n\nGhazni invasion theory also indicates Rajput background of Sainis\n\nIbbetson's non-primary and non-secondary source account hints that Sainis migrated to Punjab due to Ghazni's attack on Mathura. But Ibbetson insinuates in the ensuing text that Sainis were probably Malis even in Mathura. Apart from its orgin from a non-primary or non-original textual source , this view is rendered untenable by a serious logical and factual contradiction inherent in it.\n\nFor Sainis to be targeted by Mahmud of Ghazni, they would have to be a Rajput tribe. Based on strong historical evidence, it would be highly unusual for an invading Turk army to target a Mali tribe which had no history of combat. Quite to the contrary of Ibbetson's theory, there have been recorded instances in Rajputana where Rajputs escaped the Turk and Moghul genocides by claiming to be Malis. [ The instances of Rajput gotras such as Bhati, Gehlot, Chauhan, etc among Malis of Rajputana is an example of this and points to absurdity of Ibbetson's theory. There is well recorded account about how Rajputs escaped conversion to Islam and genocide by the Turks by claiming to be Malis in the captivity of Sahabuddin Ghori after the defeat of Prithviraj Chauhan. See 'Rajasthan', pp 614, by Kumar Suresh Singh, B. K. Lavania, Dipak Kumar Samanta, S. K. Mandal, N. N. Vyas,1998, Anthropological Survey of India] [It is also noteworthy that \"Agnivanshi\" and \"Suryavanshi\" Rajput gotras found in Malis of Rajasthan are not found among the Sainis of Punjab.] This view confirms the fact that had Sainis been deemed to be a Mali tribe by invading Turks they would have had no cause to flee Mathura as Ibbetson's anecdotal account suggests. For Sainis to be caught in the crosshairs of Ghazni's army, they would necessarily have to be a Rajput tribe which was a threat to Turks in some way.\n\nMigration of Saini Rajputs to Punjab: Visnu Purana and Mahabharata provide vital clues\n\nFrom Mathura to Dwaraka and from Dwaraka to Punjab\n\nAccording to Puranic sources, the Yadava kashatriya tribes in the Shaursena principality had to be relocated to the port city of Dwarka in Gujrat due to frequent invasions by Kalyavana and Jarasandha. There they ruled for sometime under the leadership of Lord Krishna and participated in the Mahabharta war from there. But according to the same Puranic legend , the Yadava kshatriyas in Dwaraka became intoxicated with the power and acted in such manner that caused them to be cursed by the by sages.\n\nVisnu Purana records the aftermath of this event as follows:\n\n\"....As soon as Krishna died, the parijata tree and the assembly hall named Sudharma returned to heaven. The kali era began. And the city of Dvaraka was swallowed up by the sea, with the exception of Krishna’s own dwelling.\"\n\n\"Arjuna settled some of the Yadavas in Punjab. But when he was taking the Yadava women with him, the party was set upon by a band of dacoits. Arjuna tried to repel the dacoits but found that he had lost all his powers. His strength had left him with Krishna’s death.\" [Section 5, Visnu Purana]\n\nThe above passage from Visnu Purana provides the vital clue about history of Sainis. It can be acutally regarded as the slam dunk evidence of \"Yaduvanshi\" origin of Sainis of Punjab.\n\nRelative strength of Saini claim on Shoorsaini Yadava descent\n\nApart from Bhati , Bhatias and Saini clans in Punjab there is no other community which claims to be of Yadava origin. It can be ruled out that the above reference from Visnu Purana could easily apply to Bhatis as they appear on the historical scene much later as a distinct version of Yaduvanshis. Visnu Purana or any other epical source contains no reference whatsoever to the existence of a Bhati clan among Yaduvanshis. So Bhatis, if their claim of being Yaduvanshi is historically accuate, were probably a much later offshoot from some textually unaccounted for Yadava tribe, which may or may not have included Shoorsaini tribe of Yadavas. The mercantile community of Bhatias further claim their origin from Bhati Rajputs who took to commerce. So it can be ruled out that their existence could be older than Bhati Rajputs who do not appear on historical scene until 9th or 10th century CE.\n\nIt is not difficult to conclude that based on textual evidence that the Saini tribe of Punjab best fits the description of the Puranic Shoorsaini Yadavas who, according to section 5 of Visnu Purana, migrated to Punjab from Dwarka. This is because Visnu Purana and Mahabharta distinctly acknowledge the existence of Shoorsaini or Shoorseni Yadavas as Krisna's kinsmen, as opposed to anything remotely familiar with the term 'Bhati\". It is the movement of Krishna's immediate kinsmen, Shoorsainis, to Punjab that is referred in the section 5 of Visnu Purana. [Section 5, Visnu Purana] It appears implausible that Shoorsaini tribe of Yadavas vanished for at least couple of thousand years and later reappeared suddenly on the scene as Bhatis around 9th or 10th century CE [ The history of Bhati clan is shrouded in mystery. According to the most plausible view , which has been accepted by James Tod and Alexander Cunningham, Mamnenez, the King of Khorasan, drove out King Shal Bahan from Ghazni. He then established his capital at Sialkot. One of his sons was Bhatti Rao and his descendants came to be called Bhattis. However the last ruler of Ghazni is named as Subhag Sen. One can conclude from the above legend that ancestors of the Bhatti gotra, on being driven of Ghazni, came and settled down in the Punjab and their descendants came to be called Bhattis . ] . On the other hand the relation of Saini tribe with the Puranic Shoorsaini Yadavas, based on both phonetics, geography and textual evidence, appears to be much more organic and historically plausible. Bhatis, based on all the extant textual evidence, would apprear to be much later offshoot of Yaduvanshis to claim any direct continuity from Shoorsaini Yadavas whose migration to Punjab is recorded in Visnu Purana.\n\nIt is would appear from the way the Sainis are populated and distributed in Punjab, they probably settled down there as part of mass migration after their kingdom was supposedly destroyed in Dwarka. In Hoshiarpur , Ropar and Gurdaspur districts there are villages that are entirely populated with Sainis, with a Saini \"Chaudhary\" or a \"lambardar\". Living in largely self-governing villages , they do not seem to have been subordinate to any other caste in their villages, including any other tribes claming Rajput origin.\n\nPorus: An Ancient Saini King\n\nPorus or Puru, the son of King Chandra Sen, was a Shoorsaini king. He was the overlord of the fertile area of the Punjab between the rivers Jhelum and Beas. Porus is a Zoroastrian name. He was a Kshatriya Descendant of Maharaja Shoorsen of Mathura,i.e, a Shoorsaini. Porus is also known in history as the 'Lord of the Mountains.' His bravery and gallantry has become an embodiment of Indian heroism. Prof. P.D. Oak rather argues and advocates and has tried to prove in his book – “Blunders of Indian History” – (Bhartiya Itihas ki Bhari Bhulein), that in the war with Alexander the Great, Porus had in fact won and Alexander had been defeated. That is why Porus did not allow Alexander to return by the route he arrived. Alexander had to carve out a new path for his return. Prof. Oak has tried his best and has dished out very powerful and convincing arguments.\n\nThe most shrewd politician of ancient India – Chanakya (Kautilya), the architect of the Mauryan Empire heavily depended on the military help of Porus to groom and raise Chandragupta as the future ruler of Patliputra. Chanakya's plan was based on the military might of Porus and they agreed to partition the Empire into equal halves. Porus sent his son as the commander of his army to pursue the task of ousting the Nanda ruler of Patliputra. It was the fearful might of Porus' forces that cowed Nanda’s army allowing Chanakya's successful siege of the city that ended in securing a victory. But as was the temperament of Chanakya, he betrayed the son of Porus and had him treacherously assassinated. The brave Shoorsaini, true to his royal lineage fell victim to Chanakya's intrigues and evil designs.\n\nAn interesting aspect to note here, is that in addition to the Sainis, three other tribes of the Punjab claim King Porus to be one of their own. These include Janjuas, Kukhran Khatris and Mohyal Brahmins of the Vaid clan.\n\nHowever historians have now a firm consensus that Porus was a Saini in light of the following references:\n\n'\"....we have elsewhere assigned to Yadus of the Punjab the honour of furnishing the well known king named Porus\"'\n\nSource: James Tod, Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan , pp 283 [9]\n\nThere were no known Hindu textual sources regarding Porus indicating the tribe or ethnic group he belonged to. As would be evident from further analysis of scholarly opinion the academic consensus seems to be that he was a Yadava Shoorsaini king. Col. Tod was the proponent of this view which was also held by Dr. Ishwari Prashad, another renowned historian. [9] [23][24]\n\nCol. Tod went on further specifically point out Shoorsainis as the Puru tribe whose king was called Porus, the legendary Indian adversary of Alexander the Great:\n\n\"Puru became the patronymic of this branch of the Lunar race. Of this Alexander's historians made Porus. The Suraseni of Methoras (descendants of the Soor Sen of Mathura) were all Purus, the Prasioi of Megasthenes...\"\n\nSource: Annals and Antiquities of Rajast'han, Or, The Central and Western Rajpoot States of India, James Tod, pp 36 [25]\n\nAfter careful analysis a body of scholars at the Indian History Congress (…the largest professional and academic body of Indian historians with over 10,000 members. It was established in 1935.) declared that king Porus, known for his legendary bravery, belonged to the Shoorsaini tribe ('Sourasenoi' in Greek) also based on the fact that his infantry carried the image of Lord Krishna (Herakles as per the Greeks) on their banners. Lord Krishna was both the ancestor and patron deity of Shoorsainis. [10] [11][26][27] More info:-Porus\n\nSaini Yadavas and Kushan rule\n\nAfter the fall of Porus and his sons, a new barbaric tribe of Central Asia, the Kushans, crossed the Indus and established their rule in India. During this period Saini or Shoorsaini Yadava dynasty lost prominence for a few centuries only to reappear again in Mathura around the 8th century CE.\n\nPost-Kushan Saini rule of Mathura & Kaman: Chaunsat-Khamba inscription\n\n\"They had their kingdom in Karauli in Rajasthan. They were called Shoorsainis. Sri Krishna's grandfather was Shoorsen because of which the region around Mathura was known as Shoorsen and Yadavas of this region were called Shoorsainis.\" -Mangi Lal Mahecha, Rājasthāna ke Rājapūta (The Rajputs of Rajasthan) , Rajasthan, 1965 In addition to Shoorsaini genealogies received through the bards of Rajasthan, a Sanskrit inscription was dicovered on a pillar by one Pandit Bhagvan Lal Indraji in 19th century [28] on one of the well-known Chaonsat-khamba , or \" sixty-four pillars \", in Kaman. This inscription was dated by Cunningham to be of around 8th CE[3][28]\n\nThe inscription gives following genealogy of the Surasena (or Saini) dynasty extending over seven kings[29] :\n\n1. — Phakka, married Deyika.\n\n2. — Kula-abhata (son), married Drangeni.\n\n3. — Ajita (son), married Apsarapriya.\n\n4. — Durgabhata (son), married Vachchhalika.\n\n5. — Durgadaman (son), married Vachchhika.\n\n6. — Devaraja (son), married Yajnika.\n\n7. — Vatsadaman (son).\n\nThe old fort of Kaman lies between two low ranges of hills on the high road from Delhi to Bayana. Owing to its position it is conjectured that it must have fallen an early prey to the Muhammadan conquerors.[28]. This account explains well the native accounts of the Sainis of Punjab that their forefathers were the Rajputs of Mathura and migrated to Punjab after Muslim invasions of Mathura region.[30][3][31][32]\n\nKaman is situated in the Bharatpur territory, 39 miles to the north-west of Mathura, and 14 miles to the North of Dig.\n\nEstimating the probable dates of this Surasena or Saini dynasty kings, writes Cunningham [29]:\n\n\"If we place Vatsadaman in A.D. 750 to 775, the head of the family, Phakka, will date from A.D. 600, reckoning twenty five years to each generation. As none of the names agree with those of the Yadava princes of Bayana, as recorded by the bards, it seems probable that these chiefs of Kaman, or Kadamba-vana, were only a branch of the famous Surasenas of Mathura.\"\n\nIt is also believed by the archaeologists that the Visnu temple of Kaman was built by a ShoorSaini Queen — Vachchhika [29].\n\nMedieval India\n\nBanveer, the son of Queen Sheetla Saini ruled as the Rana of Mewar, from Chittor for eight years till the consecration of Udai Singh as Rana. Eventually, \"Shoorsaini\" was shortened to \"Saini\".\n\nSaini militancy during Muslim rule: Guru Har Gobind's call\n\nIt is understandable, being devout Hindus mostly, Sainis turned largely to agriculture in preference to serving the Muslim masters , or converting to Islam , until they saw a ray of hope again in the sixth Sikh Master, Guru Har Gobind.\n\nAccording to Sikh historical tradition, Guru Hargobind extensively toured the region that now falls in the present day Hoshiarpur and Ropar districts to put together a Sikh army to fight the religiously intolerant Mogul empire. All of these areas, which had a predominantly Saini population along with Jats , Kambojs and Labanas, responded with great enthusiasm to Guru's call for soldiers. After this period, all of the rekindled Saini militant prowess was totally allied with and absorbed in the Sikh forces, which were to be formally institutionalized into the Khalsa Order by tenth Sikh Master , Guru Gobind Singh. The impact of Sikh military ideal on Saini villages could be gauged from the fact that one of the volunteers for \"Panj Pyaras\" , Sahab Chand [According to some accounts , Sahab Chand , belonged to Bidar in Karnataka. However, according to another account, he was from Nangal Shahidan. See http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Hoshiarpur. If the former view is held to be valid , it simply means that there were other significant martyrs from this Saini village.], later Sahab Singh, was a barber from the village Nangal Shahidan. The village Nangal Shahidan in Hoshiarpur district was historically always entirely owned by Saini Chaudhries of Mangar \"got\", with a handful other castes in the village. Many Saini warriors were martyred from this village as part of the Khalsa army , earning the title of \"Shahidan\" or \"Martyrs\" for the village . Nihang cantonment of Harian Belan is also surrounded by Saini villages. Traditionally, Nihangs have drawn good number of recruits from Saini community of the region.\n\nSainis as a 'martial race' during British India\n\nThe martial race theory [Rand, Gavin (March 2006). \"Martial Races and Imperial Subjects: Violence and Governance in Colonial India 1857–1914\". European Review of History 13 (1): 1-20. Routledge. doi:10.1080/13507480600586726. ] propagated by British colonialists has been a very controversial subject and has rightfully been disregarded as an instrument of recruitment policy for armed forces by Government of India since the independence. It was based on the now challenged assumption that there were communities India that were naturally warlike 'races' which possessed qualities such as courage, loyalty, self sufficiency, physical strength, resilience, orderliness and fighting tenacity and were hard-working and skilled in military tactics. Further it was the assumption that these 'martial races' tended to be hunting or agricultural cultures from hilly or mountainous regions with a history of conflict, whether internally or with external groups, who were considered better capable of enduring hardship than the inhabitants of the hot, flat plains of the country who were thought to be unwarlike and unfit for military service.\n\nWrites Mazumdar [The Indian Army and the Making of Punjab, pp 15, Rajit K. Mazumder, Orient Blackswan, 2003] citing Frederick Roberts, British commander- in-chief in India (1885-1893):\n\n\" Roberts was one of the main proponents of this new policy.The main argument of the 'martial races theory' was that all natives were not equal in soldierly qualities. Some races were superior to others. 'It is not a question of efficiency' wrote Roberts, ' but of courage and physique: in these essentials sepoys of Lower India are wanting'. As he bluntly put it , ' no comparison can be made between the martial values of a regiment recruited amongst the Gurkhas of Nepal and the warlike races of nothern India, and those recruited from the effeminate peoples of the south.\" British colonialists were obviously quite impressed by the physical attributes and fighting instincts of Sainis and accordingly listed them as a martial class along with other tribes such as Janjuas, Dogras, Pashtuns, Gurkhas, etc. [The Indian Army and the Making of Punjab, By Rajit K. Mazumder, pp 99, 205] [Annual Class Return, 1919, pp 364-7] [Annual Class Return,1925, pp 96-9] . It is noteworthy that merchant castes such as Khatris and Aroras did not make it to this list. [Annual Class Return, 1925, pp 96-99] More significantly the Mali community beyond Jamna , referred in Ibbetson's controversial account [Denzil Ibbetson, Edward MacLagan, H.A. Rose \"A Glossary of The Tribes & Casts of The Punjab & North-West Frontier Province\", 1990, Page 346] , did not make it to this list either. Muslim Arains made it to this list only in 1925. This is another testimony to the fact that British officially regarded Sainis to be distinct from either of these communities.\n\nSainis in Indian National Army (INA)\n\nAccording to a native account a village in the now Nawanshahr district of Punjab was composed of almost 80-90% Saini population in 1930s. As per the unverified anecdotal account almost 300 men out of the total population of 1800-2000 were enrolled in the British Indian Army and fought in different theatres of war across Europe, Africa and Asia during the World War II. If true, this would mean that every able bodied Saini man of the village was signed up for services in the armed forces. A large number of Saini volunteers , along with these Saini armymen, some of whom ended up POWs, eventually joined Indian National Army (INA) of Subash Chandra Bose [Late Ajit Saini , the emiment Punjabi journalist was one such INA veteran and was a close lieutinant of Subash Chandra Bose , See [18] and courted martyrdom and incarceration for the independence of their motherland.\n\nThe British Period\n\nDuring British period Sainis were enlisted as a statutory agricultural tribe as well as a martial class.Sainis have a distinguished record as soldiers in the armies of pre-British princely states, British India and independent India. Sainis fought in both the World Wars and won some of the highest gallantry awards for 'conspicuous bravery'.[33] [34] [35]Subedar Joginder Singh, who won Param Vir Chakra, Indian Army's highest war time gallantry award, in 1962 India-China War was also a Saini of Sahnan sub clan.\n\nDuring the British era, several influential Saini landlords were also appointed as Zaildars, or revenue-collectors, in many districts of Punjab and modern Haryana. [36] [37][38] [39]\n\nSaini's also took active part in the freedom movement of India and many insurgents from Saini community were either martyred or imprisoned during the days of British Raj. [40][41] [42] [43] [44]\n\nDuring the revolt of 1857, the Sainis of Kurukshetra and the Rors of Karnal were among the Hindu and Muslim elements who, valiantly fought the British seeking to re-establish the sovereignty of their Princely rulers.\n\nThe principalities of Sirmaur in Himachal Pradesh as well as Jagadhri, Kirada and Hansi in Haryana are Saini strongholds.\n\nKnown Saini freedom-fighters and martyrs\n\nGurdan Saini (Rajput General- martyred in Ranthambore)\n\nMayya Singh Saini (imprisoned) [45]\n\nGurmukh Singh Saini (IOM, Cr St Geo) , a Sikh soldier from the village Gadram Badi of Ropar in district Ambala of the province of Punjab in British India, won the Indian Order of Merit 1st Class in World War I for splendid courage on the battlefield on the night of March 1, 1916.\n\nGulab Singh Saini (martyred-hanged on January 9, 1858 ) [44] [46]\n\nChaudhary Yograj Saini of Gambhowal (Kuka Movement, 13 years imprisonment) [47]\n\nBhai Bela Singh (martyr of Nankana Sahib)[19][48]\n\nHarnam Singh of village Baghpur (Jaito Morcha, martyred, died in Jail) [47]\n\nDasondha Singh Saini (martyred- died in jail) [40]\n\nKehar Singh Saini (martyred- killed in police encounter) [40]\n\nBasant Singh s/o Prabhu Saini of Mahilpur (imprisoned) [49][47]\n\nDal Singh (imprisoned) [49]\n\nGurdial Singh of village Urapar (imprisoned, INA veteran) [49]\n\nAmar Singh s/o Sant Ram of village Orhpur (INA veteran) [47]\n\nGian Singh of village Bajidpur (imprisoned, INA veteran)[49]\n\nBhan Singh of village Jalowal (imprisoned) [49]\n\nBattan Singh of village Haveli (INA veteran, imprisoned)[49]\n\nNama Saini of Fatehgarh (Ghadar movement, martyred - hanged on January 5, 1917 after 3rd Lahore Conspiracy case trial) [47][50]\n\nPritam Saini (Ghadar movement, imprisoned) [51]\n\nBachan Singh Saini (Ghadar movement, imprisoned) [52]\n\nNaik Gurdial Singh Saini (imprisoned, INA veteran)[53]\n\nGonda Singh (Babbar Akali, imprisoned and tortured) [54]\n\nMohinder Singh Saini of Pandori Ganga Singh (Babbar Akali, martyred, killed in Babeli Police encounter)[54][47]\n\nChinta Singh Saini of Pandori Ganga Singh (Babbar Akali, martyred, hanged)[54][47]\n\nHarnam Singh Saini s/o Sunder Singh of Pandori Ganga Singh (National Movement, imprisoned for 1.5 years)[54][47]\n\nHarnam Singh Saini s/o Rajmal of Pandori Ganga Singh (imprisoned for 2 years, INA veteran)[54] [47]\n\nHazara Singh Saini of Pandori Ganga Singh (Civil Disobedience, Babar Akali, imprisoned for 6 years)[54] [47]\n\nInder Singh Saini of Pandori Ganga Singh (Babar Akali, imprisoned for 7 years)[54] [47]\n\nKartar Singh Saini of Pandori Ganga Singh (Babar Akali, sentence not known)[54] [47]\n\nArjan Singh of village Sujjon, Banga (Ghadar movement activist)[55]\n\nSatya Pal Saini of Lahore (tortured and imprisoned) [56]\n\nNarain Singh Nanua (INA veteran, imprisoned)[56]\n\nIshar Singh (Babbar Akali, imprisoned and tortured)[54]\n\nLabh Singh Saini (Akali leader, martyred)\n\nHarnam Singh Saini (Ghadar movement, martyred - hanged on March 16 , 1917 after Lahore Conspiracy Case trial) [41] [57]\n\nMahan Singh Gahunia of Phillipines (noted INA civilian organizer-donated his entire wealth to INA) [42]\n\nSadhu Ram Saini (veteran Gandhian, imprisoned) [58] [59]\n\nAjit Saini of Punjab (INA veteran, imprisoned) a Freedom fighter and an acclaimed writer and columnist, also a close lieutenant of Subhas Chandra Bose who assigned him the duty to propagate the slogan “Jai hind,” among the common masses. [43]\n\nAmar Singh (imprisoned)[58] [59]\n\nNote: This list is not exhaustive.\n\nInam-holding Saini feudals during British era\n\nZaildar was a native officer in charge of a Zail in the colonial rural administration of Punjab in British India. Each Zail was an administrative unit, extending between 2 to 40 villages.\n\nA Zaildar was more influential than a lambardar (village headman) because a Zail included many villages under it. Zaildars represented the Chaudharis of the former times and were hand picked by the deputy commissioner only after consideration of ‘caste’ or ‘tribe’ , local influence, extent of landholding, services rendered to the state by him or his family, and lastly personal character and ability.\n\nZaildars were essentially revenue collectors and village level representatives of the state who enjoyed remuneration for their duties, life grants equal to one per cent, of the revenue of their zails from the assessment of any single village that they chose.\n\nThe following is the list of some of the known Saini Zaildars of 1880s of British Punjab:\n\nChaudhari Jawahir Singh of Hoshiarpur [36] had 19 villages under him.\n\nChaudhari Jaimal Singh of Dasuya [36] had 22 villages under him.\n\nChaudhari Mohan Lal of Hissar\n\nChaudhari Nand Ram Saini of Hissar.[38]\n\nSardar Surjan Singh Saini of Phulkiyan Riyasat (Patiala State) was among the biggest landlords in Phulkiyan. He was the son of Sardar Jai Singh Saini who was a part of nobility of Patiala state. Sardar Jai Singh was a descendant of Sardar Nanu Singh Saini and was the royal poet and a close advisor of Maharaja Karam Singh. Sardar Sujan Singh’s estate was the second largest in Phulkiyan riyasat in terms of land that any nobleman owned.\n\nChaudhari Bhola Ram of Bhola Chak 178 , Baria (Punjab-Pakistan) Retired Saini soldiers from British Indian Army owned as much as 20 villages in Lyallpur. Such great was their influence these these areas were called Saini Bar, with a Saini as their Zaildar (Chaudhary Bhola Ram).\n\nChaudhary Takth Mal Bhondi of Bhogpur Bhondiyan in Jalandhar District. Chaudhary Takth Mal was a Saini of Bhondi got and a leading Zamindar of Jalandhar district. He and his brother Chaudhary Raj Mal owned 5 villages between them around Bhondiyan and Bhogpur. Chaudhary Raj Mal was built like a wrestler and stood well over 6 feet . He had a dominating persona and it is said that local freebooters and robbers of Jalandhar would spare these villages because of his fear. Noted Bollywood song writer and former Dean of Kurukshetra University, Dr. M.G. Hashmat, who wrote the lyrics of award winning film “Kora Kagaz” was in Chaudhary Takth Mal’s line. This Saini zamindar family patronized the local Sufi shrine of Madali Sharif. Madali Sharif was equally patronized by Hindu and Muslim populaces of Jalandhar. Under the influence of this shrine, the eldest son of every Hindu family had a Muslim name and the eldest son of every Muslim family had Hindu name. Some of the descendants of Chaudhary Takth Mal were accordingly named as Mehtab Gulshan Hashmat, Chaudhary Khidmat Rai, Chaudhary Mushtaq Rai , etc even though they were all observant Hindus. Chaudhary Takth Mal’s decendants are now settled in western countries and are very prosperous. In 1992 a scholar wrote the following about the Sainis of Bhogpur: “The village Sarpanch belongs to Saini caste. The Sainis are not very large in numbers but they play significant role in village as they are very rich and also well educated.”\n\nZaildar Chaudhary Ganda Ram Saini of Haveli Khurd, Ropar. Chaudhary Ganda Ram Saini of Haveli Khurd was a Zaildar of Ropar in 19th century.\n\nSaini Rai Bahadur-Besides the above the below mentioned Saini personality received the title of ”Rai Bahadur”. The rank of the Rai Bahadur was much higher than that of Zaildar. Only one person per district received this title.\n\nRai Bahadur Chaudhari Dewan Chand Saini of Gurdaspur [37] [39] was a well-known Saini safedposh during 20th century.[60] He was a highly reputed criminal lawyer of Lahore High Court who later became the leader of Criminal Bar. He was also subsequently awarded the title of 'Rai Bahadur' by the British government.[37] [39]\n\nNote: This list is not exhaustive. More information is needed for Ropar , Jalandhar, and Gurdaspur districts, and also for Hoshiarpur, over different periods of time before 1947.\n\nEpical Saini warriors\n\nLord Krishna and Balrama\n\ncquote| \"Foremost among all the Shoorsenis (Sainis) , the powerful one, Krishna, residing at Dwaraka, will rule and protect the whole earth after vanquishing all her lords, conversant as he will be with the science of polity.\" |30px|30px| Ved Vyasa on Shoorseni Krishna [Mahabharata, Book 13, Chapter 147]\n\nThe story of the epic Saini warriors begins with the mention of Lord Krishna and his elder brother Balrama. Krishna was a warrior-statesman who gave the Yadavas leadership at a very critical juncture. Krishna's and Balrama's exploits as warriors, mentioned in various hagiographies, are too numerous and too popular to need any mention here.\n\nSome critics trained in the Western scholastic traditions have doubted the existence of a historical Krishna but such commentaries are now clearly contradicted by archaeological evidence found in the recent underwater excavations in the Arabian sea which have revealed a submerged ancient city[61] as described in Visnu Purana. This evidence along with myriads of sites and clans found all over India claiming association with Krishna indicate the distinct possibility of a historical Krishna.\n\nVisnu Purana vividly describes in detail various military expeditions that Krisna led. Incidentally this text also gives clear proof that Shoorsaini Yadavas, whence Sainis of Punjab claim descent, moved to Dwarka and eventually some of them moved to Punjab after submersion of Dwarka into the sea.[8]\n\nKrishna defined the warrior-statesman and saint-soldier ideal not only for his kinsmen and descendants, distributed in diverse clans all over India now, which also include Sainis of Punjab, but also for the entire mankind. His military exploits and warrior spirit are even invoked in an anachronistic way in the Sikh tradition in the Chobis avatar section of Sri Dasam Granth.\n\nIn the Shaster Naam Mala section of Sri Dasam Granth, the names of Balrama and Krisna are invoked as follow to instill the warrior spirit.[62]\n\nਹਲਧਰ ਸਬਦ ਬਖਾਨਿ ਕੈ ਅਨੁਜ ਉਚਰਿ ਅਰਿ ਭਾਖੁ ॥ ਸਕਲ ਨਾਮ ਸ੍ਰੀ ਬਾਨ ਕੇ ਚੀਨਿ ਚਤੁਰ ਚਿਤ ਰਾਖੁ ॥੧੪੧॥\n\nहलधर शबद बखानि कै अनढ़ज उचरि अरि भाखढ़ ॥ सकल नाम सढ़री बान के चीन चतढ़र चित राखढ़ ॥१४१॥\n\nAfter speaking the word \"Haldhar\" (Balrama), then adding \"Anuj\" (Krishna) and afterwards saying \"Ari\" (Foe), the wise people know all the names of \"Baan\" (Arrow).\n\nUddhava Shoorsaini\n\nAccording to some texts Uddhava was Krishna's cousin, being the son of Devabhaga, who was the brother of Vasudeva, Krishna's father. His physical appearance was so similar to Krishna that in some cases, that some times he was mistaken for the latter. Mahabharata mentions that Uddhav was the minister of Vrishnis, whom all respected. Bhagwat Purana mentions that Uddhav was a disciple of Jupiter.\n\nSatyaki\n\n[20] From Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJump to: navigation, search Satyaki in Javanese Wayang Satyaki (Sanskrit: सत्यकि), also called Yuyudhana, is a powerful warrior belong to the Yadava-Vrishni dynasty of Lord Krishna, in the Mahābhārata epic.\n\nSatyaki is devoted to Krishna and his best friend Arjuna, with whom he trained under Drona in military arts. He was born in the line of Shini of the Vrishni clan, and was a son of Satyaka. He strongly and passionately favored the cause of the Pandavas over the Kauravas in the Kurukshetra War. Satyaki accompanied Krishna to the Kuru capital, with Krishna as the emissary of peace which was ridiculed and turned down by Duryodhana.\n\nIn the Kurukshetra war, Satyaki and Kritavarma were two important Yadava heroes who fought on the opposing sides. Satyaki fought on the side of the Pandavas, whereas Kritavarma joined the Kauravas. Satyaki was a valiant warrior and on one particular occasion, stunned Drona by allegedly breaking his bow for a successive 101 times. In the course of the fourteenth day of the conflict, Satyaki fights an intense battle with his archrival Bhurisravas with whom he has a long standing family feud. After a long and bloody battle, Satyaki begins to tire, and Bhurisravas batters him and drags him across the battlefield. Arjuna is warned by Lord Krishna of what is happening. Bhurisravas prepares to kill Satyaki, but he is rescued from death by Arjuna, who shoots an arrow cutting off Bhurisravas' arm.\n\nBhurisrava wails out that by striking him without warning, Arjuna had disgraced the honor between warriors. Arjuna rebukes him for attacking a defenseless Satyaki. He reiterates that protecting Satyaki's life at all costs was his responsibility as a friend and comrade in arms.\n\nSatyaki emerges from his swoon, and swiftly decapitates his enemy. He is condemned for this rash act, but every soldier present realizes that the power of Krishna made Satyaki end Bhurisravas' life, which was going to happen anyway.\n\nSatyaki and Kritavarma both survived the Kurukshetra conflict . Kritavarma is involved in the slaughter of the Panchalas and the sons of the Pandavas in the undeclared night attack with Kripacharya and Ashwatthama. 36 years after the war, the Yadavas, including Satyaki and Kritavarma are involved in a drunken brawl with Satyaki accusing Kritavarma of killing sleeping soldiers and Kritavarma citicizing Satyaki for his beheading of the unarmed Bhurisravas. In the ensuing melee, Satyaki, Kritavarma and the rest of the Yadavas are exterminated, as it was ordained by Gandhari's curse. Krishna desired to remove the Yadava clan from earth at the same time as his Avatara is fulfilled, so that the earth may be free of any possibly sinful and aggressive warriors, which was the wider purpose of the Kurukshetra war.\n\nSatyaki, the grand son of Rajan Saini, ruled the Sura-Sen kingdom in the north-west of India. Rajan Saini founded Saini vansh, which is one of the eleven vanshas of Yadus and one of the tribes of the Yadavas.\n\nRajan Sini\n\n[21] Rajan Saini (Sini), a character in the great Indian epic, the Mahabharata. Sini is the uncle of Vasudeva, the father of Sri Krishna. When Devaki, the mother of Krishna, was a maiden, many princes competed for her hand in marriage. This led to a dispute. In the end, a great battle ensued between two princes of different families over it: Somadatta and Rajan Sini. In this fierce battle Rajan Sini won, and on behalf of Vasudeva he carried Devaki in his chariot and drove her away.Reference FE pargiter's book Ancient indian historical traditions, pages 105 to 107This incident led to a feud between the two clans, the Sini family and that of Somadatta.\n\nThe rivalry came to the fore one last time on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, where Sini's grandson, Satyaki, who was a peer and friend of Arjuna and a famed archer, clashed with Bhurisravas, Somadatta's son, who was on the Kaurava side, resulting in the slaying of Bhurisravas by Satyaki.\n\nRaja Dhampal: Tomara-Yaduvanshi King\n\nAnother significant Jadhav sept found among Marathas is Dhampal. The reviver of Shoorsaini kingdom in around 6-7 AD is also described as Dhampal (Skt. Dharampal) in the genaologies of Karauli royals (Cunningham, 1883) . Saini clan of Dhamrait and Pathania clan of Dhamrial or Dhamial are in all probability linked with this eponymous Yaduvanshi Rajput patriarch. The town of Dhameri (earlier name of Nurpur,Himachal Pradesh) in Gurdaspur district was the captial of common ancestors of Saini and Pathania Rajputs who had moved to Punjab from near Delhi and Mathura under Raja Jeth Pal ( Charles Francis Massy, 1890) , a Tomara-Yaduvanshi monarch described in the line of Dhampal as Jaitapal.\n\nSignificance of \"Dhameri\": No Random Name\n\nDhameri is said to have been founded by Jeth Pal in 1095 AD (Cunningham, 1889). It is noteworthy that the name \"Dhameri\" is far from a random name picked by migrant Rajputs from Delhi and Mathura. It is in all probability derived from the name of Saini patriarch Dhampal, who was ancestor of Raja Jeth or Jait Pal. Some other variations of Dhameri in diferrent historical epigraphs are as follows: Dahmal, Damal, Dahmari, Damehri, Dhamari, Dhammeri, etc. In Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri it is metioned as \"Dhameri\" only and Alberuni, a source closer to the date of the said Rajput migration from Mathura and Delhi, actually describes it as \"Dahmala\", which looks certain to be a distortion of the name of Dhampal, the ancestor of Jait Pal.\n\nThe fort of Dhameri fell to Ibrahim Ghaznavi after a long siege according to Tarikh-i-Alfi. Since the dates of this Ghaznavide raider are stated to be between 1058 AD and 1089 AD, we can be certain that Dhameri was founded atleast as early as this period. Incidentally, the account of Sainis i.e that their Rajput ancestors moved to Punjab to fight Ghazni's army, an account which was duly recorded by English ethnographers in late 19th century, fully tallies with these historical facts gathered from independent sources of which the 19th century informants giving these accounts had no knowledge. They were merely repeating a folklore which had passed down to them from generation after generation from the time when battles between Saini Rajputs or Shoorsainis and Ghaznavides had taken place in roughly around 1100 AD. As already pointed out, Dhamrait , which could mean both a resident of Dhameri or a descendant of the eponymous Shoorsaini patriarch Dhampal, is a major clan of Sainis in Gurdaspur, Hoshiarpur and Ropar districts , all within 20 miles to 100 miles proximity to the historical fort of Dhameri near Pathankot.\n\nIt is interesting to note that here is another \"Dhameri\" in North Rajputana (about 100 miles west of Delhi) which fell in areas traditionally ruled by Saini rulers of Delhi and Mathura. There still exists a large population of Tomara-Yaduvanshi clans in this area. Meos, a Rajput origin Muslim group, who derive their ancestry from the same lineage also have a similar sounding \"Demrot\" sept (Cunningham, 1885).\n\nSource: The History of India: As Told by Its Own Historians. The Muhammadan Period, p. 162, Volume V,Sir Henry Miers Elliot, Trübner, 1867\n\nMedieval Saini warriors\n\nRana Gurdan Singh Saini\n\nNoted historians Henry Miers Elliot and John Dowson on page 541 of their work \"The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians. The Muhammadan Period\" [63] citing Ghurratu-L-Kamal , a work by Khalji dynasty's royal poet-scholar Amir Khusro, provide the following account of a distinguished Saini general in the Sisodia Rajput army of Rana Hamir that took on Alauddin Khilji's Turk army:\n\nThe rai was in affright, and sent for Gurdan Saini, who was the most experienced warrior amongst the 40,000 rawats under the rai, and had seen many fights among the Hindus. \"Sometimes he had gone with the advance to Malwa ; sometimes he had gone plundering in Gujarat.\" The Saini took 10,000 rawats with him from Jhain, and advanced against the Turks, and, after a severe action, he was slain...\n\n\"Gurdan\" appears to be an \"apabhransha\" or distortion of the name Govardhan which is a very common Hindu name. \"Gurdan\" name is also common among Sikhs of Punjab, although in the era of Gurdan Saini, Sikhism was not yet born.\n\nThe account of this Saini general who commanded a force of 10,000 Rajput fighters and achieved martyrdom almost reads like an unqualified eulogy even from a hostile Turk perspective.\n\nA Saini Commander of a premier Sisodia Rajput force Gurdan or Govardhan Saini could not have been an indegenous inhabitant of Rajputana and was most likely an immigrant from some Saini clan of Punjab or its contiguous region. This can be categorically stated due to a very obvious fact that until the the census of 1881 [W.Chichele Plowden , ( 1883 ), The Indian Empire Census of 1881 Statistics of Population Vol. II. , Calcutta , Superintendent of Government Printing India, pp 243-258 ] there was no such community as \"Saini\" outside Punjab (both British territory and feudatory states).\n\nGurdan Saini was most likely linked with the famed Yaduvanshi Surasenas of Mathura, some of whom disperesed to Jalandhar doab in Punjab after the Turk invasion of Mathura. [31] [64] [3] The term 'Surasena' (also spelt Shurasena) is a Sanskrit version of Prakrit 'Shoorsaini'. 'Shoorsaini' further gets abbreviated to just 'Saini' in layman usage.\n\nJarnail Sardar Nanu Singh Saini, Jagirdar, Phulkiyan\n\nSardar Nanu Singh Saini was a Sikh army general and a well-known jagirdar in Phulkian riyasat. He was a close associate of Maharaja Ala Singh who founded the Patiala state in 1753 AD.\n\nThe family of Nanu Singh Saini owned 27000 Bigha estate in Patiala state which was the second largest estate that any noble family owned in the princely state of Patiala.\n\nHe gained this jagir from Maharaja Ala Singh as a recognition and reward for having liberated him from the Sunam prison in 1747 where he had been incarcerated by Ali Muhammad Khan for over two years. More in:-\n\nMain article: Sardar Nanu Singh Saini\n\nJarnail Sardar Sangat Singh Saini\n\nSardar Sangat Singh Saini was a distinguished and highly ranked General in Khalsa army of the Sikh Empire under Maharaja Ranjit Singh. He inspected the operations in Gurdaspur district. Their headquarters were in Batala. It is said that the Maharaja was so impressed with his contributions in the military campaigns that he granted him a fief. Sardar Sangat Singh was rewarded with 300 acres (1.2 km 2) property from Maharaja Ranjit Singh for bravery in the war when Sangat Singh conquered a outpost in Afghan region and returned the golden sword of Afghan ruler Maharaja Ranjit Singh Brought it on. This property is now known as Sangatpur named after this illustrious Saini General in Batala of Gurdaspur district of India. [65]\n\nIncidentally, Gurdaspur is another area of Saini concentration in Punjab.\n\nBhai Jamala Singh Nanua\n\nNanua Bairagi , also known as Nanua Bhagat and Jamala Singh, was a renowned mystic, humanitarian and Sikh warrior of Punjab. He was a stalwart of Saini community and was a close associate and disciple of last three Sikh gurus , whom he had the honour of serving in person.He Wrote his Own 'Saini Bani'. More in:-\n\nMain article: Nanua Bairagi\n\nBibi Sharan Kaur Pabla\n\nSharan Kaur Pabla was a Sikh martyr who was slain in 1705 by Mughal soldiers while cremating the bodies of the two older sons of Guru Gobind Singh, the 10th Sikh Guru, after the battle of Chamkaur. She was from the village Raipur Rani which is 2 KM from the famous town of Chamkaur. More in:-\n\nMain article: Bibi Sharan Kaur Pabla\n\nMayya Singh Saini\n\nMaya Singh Saini , sometimes spelt as Mayya Singh Saini, [66] [67] [68] [69][70] [71] was a Saini cavalryman and a notable freedom-fighter from Naushahra in Amritsar district of the Punjab. Mayya Singh was an ace horseman and fought in the battle of Ramnagar on 22 November 1848 during the second Anglo-Sikh war. Although the battle of Ramnagar was inconclusive , the Sikh cavalry caused heavy damage to the British forces, which proved to be a great morale booster for the Sikhs.\n\nThereafter he joined volunteer corps of Bhai Maharaj Singh[22] leader of the popular revolt against the British. He participated in the battles of Sa`dullapur and Gujrat. After the defeat of the Sikh forces, Mayya Singh was in Bhai Maharaj Singh`s train at Sujoval near Balala. From the latter place he was sent to Lahore on a mission, and thus escaped arrest when Maharaj Singh and his companions were captured on the night of 28 and 29 December 1849. He, however, fell into the hands of the British soon afterwards.\n\nIt is not clear from the account available whether Mayya Singh was a commander or just an ordinary cavalryman. But given the fact that his contributions were significant enough for his account to have survived in the history texts, there is a strong possibility that he held a significant rank in the Khalsa army. However, his major contributions came after the Anglo-Sikh war as armed insurgent against the rule of East India Company.[72]\n\nMayya Singh is among many other unsung Saini heroes who fought as part of the Khalsa armies since the time of the 6th Sikh Guru Hargobind. Mayya Singh is fortunate in the sense that his account survived while other Saini heroes just faded into oblivion after selfless service to their motherland. This could be due to two factors. First of them being poor record keeping by Saini community about their foremost men. This neglect continues even to this day. The second factor being the casteless character of the Khalsa order itself which downplayed caste identities.\n\nSenapati Shaheed Gulab Singh Saini\n\nGulab Singh Saini [73] , son of Jodh Singh Saini, was a close companion of a Jat chief Nahar Singh of Ballabhgarh and laid down his life fighting the British in 1858. Raja Nahar Singh had also lost his life heroically in the process. Gulab Singh Saini was one of the prominent leaders of the native insurrection against the British during the mutiny in his role as the commander-in-chief [73] of the princely state of Ballabhgarh.\n\nHe was hanged , along with Jat chief Nahar Singh, in the Chandni Chowk of New Delhi on January 9, 1858 . Thereupon, all of his property and land was confiscated by the British colonialists and all public records pertaining to him and his companions were burnt down to erase the influence of their martyrdom on the natives [73] but the tales of patriotism , gallantry and sacrifice of these heroes of India's first war of freedom still managed to endure in the popular memory despite the twin scourge of colonial oppression and time.\n\nShaheed Gulab Singh Saini's descendant, Ranjit Singh Saini, is a distinguished scholar of Sanskrit who has authored several books on Sanskrit grammar and historical manuscripts.\n\nAlong with Mayya Singh, Gulab Singh was the second prominent Saini hero of the 1857 mutiny and before who fought the East India Company and faced either incarceration or martyrdom.\n\nSaini , Jat and Ror communities around the area of Kurukshetra are reported to have put up a very brave resistance to the forces of East India Company during the mutiny.\n\nRaja Sher Singh Salaria\n\nThis incident is from the time of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb! At that time India was divided into small kings! Haripur was a small state in Syalkot (Pakistan) and Jammu region! Whose name is now Sohagpur! King Sohag Singh Saini Salaria ruled in Haripur state! King Sohag Singh Saini (Salaria)'s wife's name was Sundarvati. All the people of Haripur were from Hindu religion! For some reason King Sohag Singh Saini (Salaria) died untimely! At that time King Sohag Singh Saini (Salaria) had only one son, Mr. Sher Singh Saini (Salaria)! Sher Singh Saini Salaria was a teenager at the time of his father's demise! The end mother Sundarvati ji took over Haripur state's gutter after the death of her husband Maharaja Sohag Singh Saini (Salaria)! But after 2-3 years, when his son Mr. Sher Singh Saini (Salaria) became young, the whole burden of the state was given to him! At that time the Mughal emperor was changing the religion of Hindus! Hindus of Kashmir had changed their religion and in Jammu, some Hindu religion had changed to Muslims! During the time of Aurangzeb, Chak Majra, Chak Kim, Pasgal, Murchapur, Wadipur, Shekhopur, Adlair, Fatehgarh, Kirchpur Khawaspur etc. Hindu Muslims of the villages had accepted religion! All these villages are present in Tehsil Bishnah (Jammu) and the Muslims here have left India in 1947 and moved to Pakistan! Mother Sundarwati named Haripur state after her late husband Maharaj Sohag Singh Saini (Salaria) and this village now lies in Arnia sector! This whole village belongs to soldiers who are the descendants of Sher Singh Saini Salaria.\n\nIt is said that one day Mughals were stealing cows and Raja Sher Singh Saini (Salaria) got reported through a scattered Brahmin. Then King Sher Singh Saini (Salaria) took the blessings of his mother, riding on a horse and set the mother cow free. Elderly says that there was a terrible encounter between Mughals and Raja Sher Singh Saini (Salaria) at a place of white chak salt! King Sher Singh won that battle with his bravery and bravery and was bringing back the cow mother with respect. That time an injured Muslim cheatedly attacked him from behind and King Sher Singh's head fell into the battlefield. In Sohagpur, where the funeral of this brave soldier was held, there is currently the tomb of King Sher Singh Saini (Salaria)! Here every year the full moon of the month has a huge stock and in today's time this place is known as a historic and sacrificial place! All the salarias of Jammu, Pathankot, Kathua and Gurdaspur consider Kshatriya/Rajput Sher Singh Saini Salaria their Jathera and bow down to the tomb of this brave man. This is a pilgrimage place for the soldiers of Jammu (especially the soldiers of Salaria clan). Before the division of India, Syalkot's salarias also used to come to Sohagpur for pilgrimage. The holy declaration of \"Jai Date Di\" can be heard on this land of God.\n\nCurrently Retired Inspector General (IG) Mr. Kamal Singh Saini (IPS) from Jammu & Kashmir Police is the Chief Manager of this holy place.\n\nIn Syalkot, soldiers were also called Dogra Saini. Muslim Rajputs named \"Sainiwal\" and \"Mughal Saini\" are also recorded in the 1901 census. Their clans (Salaria, Dhamdiel, Badla, Badwal, etc) are from Hindu and Sikh soldiers. English administrator, Denzil Ibbetsin, who also spread illusions about Saini and Mehta Rajputs, admits that these Muslims Rajput soldiers changed their religion to call themselves \"Mughal Saini\". Muslims Kiyani and Gakhar Rajputs also started calling themselves \"Mughal\" after religion change and they had marital relations with these Muslim Sainiwal Rajputs.\n\nSalaria Kshatriya, son of Tomar Raja Anangpal, Delhi, is the descendant of Salaria Pal. This is the largest branch of soldiers and they have about 15-20 villages in Jammu and Gurdaspur districts. Remember Tomar dynasty has been considered as Yaduvanshi by historians like Colonel Todd and Cunningham. Delhi and Indraprastha where Tomars ruled was in the middle of Shursen Republic. So these tomaras have no anomaly in being called Saini (i.e. it's natural). According to mythology, after the Mahabharata war, Yudhishthira had made Shri Krishna's greatson Vajranabh the king of Indraprastha and the greatson of Satyaki the king of the East of Saraswati river (which is today's Haryana province).\n\nA Temple was made for Kuldevta Saini Salaria Biradari known as Data Sher Singh Saini Salaria Maharaj Temple in Bishnah,Jammu District. Jammu & Kashmir State in India. Pincode is 181131(Tehsil: Arnia ). Near by railway Stations. It is in 28 Km distance to Jammu City.\n\nModern Saini warriors (only decorated Saini armymen and policemen)\n\nThe awards list given below is not exhaustive. Not all Sainis use their clan or sub clan names and go by the last names such as 'Chaudhry', 'Singh', 'Kumar', etc. Since these names are shared by many other groups (some of which overlap Sainis) such as Jats, Dogras and Other Rajputs etc , it is not possible to isolate Sainis among them just by their last names. The following list pertains only to those decorated armymen and policemen who are confirmed to be Sainis. The actual list of decorated Saini army and police personnel might be much longer. More quality research is needed in this reference.\n\nThe following list only contains only those army men and policemen who won have major wartime and peacetime awards. The list of Sainis in Indian Army is very large and needs no inclusion here. Army and police have traditionally been major sources of employment for Sainis. British had classified Sainis as a 'martial race' Listed Seperately from other Rajput Clans.\n\nSainis are merely a sub-tribe of Yaduvanshi Kshatriyas (or Jadon Rajputs) who took to agriculture in Punjab and spun-off with a distinct identity local predominantly to Punjab and bordering regions. Saini Yaduvanshi clan lost their rule, during war with muslim invaders. They trace their lineage from Yaduvanshi clan of Kshatriya rajputs just like Clans of Jadon, Bhati, Jadeja.\n\nAnother fact that needs to be born in mind is comparison of Sainis with Dogras, Pushtuns, Jats and Mahtons is not an apples to apples comparison. Their numbers are relatively very small compared with these groups. For example according to the 1881 census, the entire Saini population in the whole of undivided Punjab- also all of pre-partition India for that matter- was only 132,000 while the population of just a single Jat clan of Sidhus was 208,000. The Saini population was reduced to 106,000 in 1901 census after mistakes of 1881 census were corrected.[74] [75] The best way to gauge proportionate Saini contribution to feats of gallantry in armed forces would be by comparing them individually with other Rajput sub tribes such as Bhati, Pathania, Chauhan, Sisodia, etc rather than Mahtons, Jats, Khatri or Dogras as integrated groups which are extremely large and heterogeneous when compared to Sainis.\n\n\"A district-by-district classification was published. The 'agricultural tribes' included were Ahir, Arain, Baluch, Dogar, Gakhar, Gujar, Janjua, Jat, Kamboh, Khattar, Khokhar, Labana, Mahton, Mughal, 'Musalman Jat', Pathan, Quereshi, Rajput, Saini, Sial, Syed, Thakur. The significance of 'agricultural tribes' is that ones so notified were synonymous with the 'martial races' which the army almost exclusively recruited from. -Source: The Indian army and the making of Punjab, pp 105, Rajit K. Mazumder. Orient Blackswan, 2003\n\n\" Most of the nearly one million men who served at one time or another were drawn from traditional martial groups - Sikhs, Dogras, Rajputs, Muslims and Gurkhas. After a serious manpower shortage developed from March 1916, 75 new classes of recruits were also tried. Many of these (such as Punjabi Brahmins and Christians, south and west Muslims, Awadh Rajputs, Saini and Khatri Sikhs, Nandbansi Ahirs, Tamang Gurkhas and Dogra Jats) were from classes closely related - in social, religious or geographical terms- to groups already recruited;...\" -Recruiting, drafting, and enlisting: two sides of the raising of military forces , pp120, Peter Karsten\n\n\"The tribes chiefly recruited are - Sikh and Hindu Jats, Kambohs, Ahluwalias, Mahtons (Sikh Rajput), Sainis....\" -Punjab District Gazetteers, Volume XIV A. , Jullundur District with Maps, pp 269, 1904 , Lahore, Printed at the \"Civil and Military Gazette\" Press\n\nCitation by Governor General of Punjab for Subedar-Major Jagindar Singh 'Bahadur', who was a Saini and was decorated with two major gallantry awards Order of British India and Indian Order of Merit for his 'conspicuous bravery' on 17th November 1914 in the Battle of Loos: \" ..for his conspicuous gallantry in action on the 17th November 1914 when with a party of Sappers under the command of a British Officer he was always to the fore and led his men with great determination into the enemy's trenches.
