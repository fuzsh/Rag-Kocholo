        "text": "Obituary:\n\nWashington: May 19, 2011\n\nCrusader for Freedom-Fighters; Messenger of Laughter, No More\n\nR. I. P.\n\nKomagata Maru's Advocate died peacefully\n\nWashington, May 24, 2011: Over 800 friends, family and well wishers bid affectionate farewell to Dr. Balwant Singh, father of Dr. Rajwant Singh, at a three hour program of paath – bhog of Guru Granth Sahib, Kirtan, glowing tributes, antim ardaas (final and last prayer) at Guru Gobind Singh Foundation here on May 22 for the eternal peace of the departed soul.\n\nDr. Balwant Singh, father of Dr. Rajwant Singh, passed away on Monday, May 16, 2011 at the Washington Hospital Center amidst prayers and Sikh hymn recitations. He was a crusader for the people who had sacrificed for India's independence. He had formed an organization called Komagata Maru Memorial Committee which was headed by famous Punjabi and Bengali veterans of India's freedom struggle which worked to create awareness about this historical event in the world history.\n\nDr. Balwant Singh was born on October 5, 1925 in Calcutta, India. His parents, Sardarni Bishan Kaur and Sardar Amar Singh, had moved from Punjab to West Bengal, shortly before his birth for their family business. Although he lost his mother when he was thirteen, he finished his early education in Punjab and later pursued degree in Medicine at the National Medical College in Calcutta. After completing his MBBS, he moved to Burma to work as medical officer. He served the country for 5 years.\n\nDr. Singh had a passion for the plight of freedom-fighters of India. His brother was incarcerated by the British in Calcutta in the fight for India’s independence. This very incident kept him motivated to speak for the people who had sacrificed themselves for India and her freedom.\n\nDuring his lifetime he organized many events to create awareness about freedom fighters and their right to have a quality life with support from the government. He even formed an organization to lobby for their rights. He had special bonds with the Bengali freedom fighters and especially with Kiran Das, the brother of Jatin Das in Bengal and the brothers of Shahid Bhagat Singh, namely Kultar Singh in Punjab, who were hung by the British in India. Often freedom fighters from all over would visit Dr. Balwant Singh’s home for support, inspiration and, free medical treatment.\n\nDr. Balwant Singh lobbied the government of West Bengal to have a memorial built in the memory of victims of famous Komagata Maru incident. A ship named ‘Komagata Maru’, carrying Indian travelers mostly Sikhs, was not allowed to port in Vancouver, Canada in 1914. After months of blockade, the ship reached India at Budge Budge port where the British troops opened fire on unarmed travelers of this ship. Many died at this spot but there was no memory of this powerful moment of history. Dr. Balwant Singh worked tirelessly to erect this memorial. He organized annual events that would mark this long forgotten incident. Buses were organized from the Gurdwaras of West Bengal for people to come to Budge Budge Ghat to mark this occasion. This work had earned him much respect among many political leaders and masses and had the succeeding chief ministers of West Bengal visit this historical site to inaugurate the commemoration. Today, Budge Budge Ghat has a memorial for Komaghata Maru because of Dr. Balwant Singh.\n\nMemorial in Budge Budge, West Bengal, India\n\nDr. Singh was also involved in cultural activities such as being involved in Punjabi Baradari, an organization which promoted Punjabi cultural events in Calcutta. In addition, he was part of a Bengali cultural organization called Rupantar, an art and drama club. He was also part of the South Calcutta Doctor’s Club, which brought together doctors of all backgrounds to organize events. He would often visit his own village, Kanjla, in Sangrur District of Punjab, where he would offer free medical advice and medical tests to villagers. He was the first medical graduate from his village. Sant Attar Singh ji Mastuana, a pillar of the Sikh community in the early 20th century from the neighboring village of Mastuana and his protégé Sant Bishan Singh Kanjla (family relative) also had major impact on him as well and shaped his life.\n\nDr. Balwant Singh had an immense love for Punjabi and Urdu poetry. In his youth, he used to compose Punjabi poetry and used ‘Balwant Singh Baagi’ as his pen name. He used to recite Punjabi poems with his friends or in small gatherings and these poems were of high literate quality. Many of his friends were Punjabi poets and writers and he had a great collection of Punjabi literature.\n\nDr, Singh was known to take an adamant stand against injustice or wrong-doings. He had an innate quality of standing up for what he believed in, even in the face of unpopularity. He stood firmly for his stand and for what he believed in and did not care about the consequences. Often his position and rigidity would put him in a difficult situation because his friends and family would urge him to back down. Seldom they would succeed in making him change his position.\n\nHis father and grandfather, both deeply devout Sikhs, influenced Balwant Singh’s personality. They were honest, simple, and humble people and yet had the desire to have their children become highly educated. For Balwant Singh, education was the most important thing, along with his multi-dimensional view on life.\n\nBalwant Singh took Amrit (Sikh baptism) in his middle age and remained a devoted Sikh till the end of this life. He lead life as a true Gursikh and raised his kids as such. As a medical professional, he decided to leave his beard open, even when it was unfashionable to be spiritual or religiously oriented.\n\nHis wife of 56 years, Surinder Kaur, was truly the “wind beneath his wings.” She provided the support and infrastructure on which he was able to achieve so many things. She cooked and hosted an uncountable number of people with a smile and the most amazing attitude, anytime of the day or night!\n\nBoth husband and wife wished and successfully too, that their children and grandchildren would develop a deep and profound connection with the Sikh faith. He started kirtan class for his kids and other Sikh students at his own home and encouraged kids to memorize the Gurbani. He worked to improve the organizational structure in Khalsa Girls High School in Calcutta, and helped appoint qualified staff. He would organize visits of dignitaries and accomplished individuals to inspire youth.\n\nHe had a hospitable heart for guests at home. One day, by sheer accident he came in contact with some visitors from USA and South Africa who were studying at Shanti Niketan, an art university founded by Rabinder Nath Tagore. These students started visiting his home to get unlimited hospitality and unconditional love. Many of these students have become part of his larger family. He touched many lives with his generosity and warmth towards friends and strangers alike.\n\nDr. Balwant Singh had the tremendous tact of creating lasting friendships with people anywhere he lived or interacted with. He formed relationships with people of various backgrounds; from taxi-drivers to millionaires, from illiterate to highly literate, anywhere he lived.\n\nHe would visit people who were suffering and would make them feel good about themselves and bring a smile to their faces. He would use various dialects and speaking styles to make them comfortable enough to converse with him. He had Bengali and Punjabi friends in addition to having friends from various other communities in Calcutta. He had no sister but had become a brother to many women that affectionately remember him, He shared so much love, with so many in so many places.\n\nDr. Singh loved making people laugh, a strength that he acquired at a young age. He would joke with people of all ages and leave an indelible mark on them with this remarkable quality. His narrations of numerous incidents of his youth kept people entertained. This one quality touched many people in the Washington area too. He volunteered at the Holy Cross Senior Center for many years and kept the seniors of all races and various backgrounds entertained and amused with his smile and his loving affection. People will remember him for many years. Everyone from youngsters to senior citizens at Guru Gobind Singh Foundation has been touched by his contagious laughter and joking gestures.\n\nFor the past few years he was suffering from Alzheimer's. The disease did not succeed in incapacitating him. It may have weakened him neurologically, but his strong spirit did not allow him to become dysfunctional. He had the knack of camouflaging his ailment with his infectious laughter. He would become like an innocent child while playing with a child. He would force many to give up their stiffness and become part of his joyful celebration of life.\n\nThe last thing that people will remember about him was his jokes and the false yet funny acquisitions he would make on his wife. It would make people laugh right after langar, especially in the senior corner at Guru Gobind Singh Foundation in Washington, for which he will always be remembered and deeply missed.\n\nTo keep his memory alive, let us make laughter a central part of our lives :\n\nSome simple sayings of Dr. Balwant Singh:\n\nDo not take yourself too seriously.\n\nDo not give yourself too much importance.\n\nBe honest and straightforward; you will always be happy.\n\nAlways take care of your own health and body.\n\nBe happy and do not have any resentment.\n\nDo not put off things.\n\nFulfill your responsibilities first, than have fun.\n\nSpeak with love and affection for everyone, what is the gain in keeping anger for anyone?\n\nEnjoy life with children.\n\nSlow down and have peace.\n\nAlways go for a morning walk. Keep a dog.\n\nHe leaves behind his wife Surinder Kaur.
