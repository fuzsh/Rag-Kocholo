The former JCT striker has been in rich vein of form for the national team having scored thrice in his last three outings.\n\nMeanwhile, Manvir Singh has been recalled into the Indian team as a replacement. The FC Goa striker has been in rich vein of form during the pre-season with his most latest goal coming against Kolkata’s East Bengal.\n\nIndia are already without the services of Nikhil Poojary, who has been ruled out for at least four months following an ACL injury and Rowllin Borges, who has a knock in his knee and is expected to be out of NorthEast United’s opening ISL game against Jamshedpur FC on October 18."
