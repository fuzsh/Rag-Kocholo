        "text": "On the outskirts of Amritsar, a 10-minute ride off NH-3, lies Jallupur Khera. Till a year ago, it was just another quiet hamlet on the Majha continuum, typical of the soil-born prosperity of this northwestern frontier belt of Punjab. Soothing acres of flat greens, swanky SUVs parked in palatial bungalows, cheek by jowl with big tractors. Not the hub of any activity larger than farming, except on Sangrand—or Sankranti—when Sandhu Jat Sikhs in the vicinity come visiting to pay obeisance at the gurdwara on the premises of the dera of their medieval-age patron saint, Baba Kala Mehar. That changed in the middle of August last year, when Jallupur Khera registe­red on Punjab’s consciousness in a way that reawakened mem­ories of a dark, stormy past. The man responsible for it: a 30-year-old Dubai-returned Sikh radical, Amritpal Singh Sandhu."
