Since EGF was also localized in porcine cumulus and granulosa cells, the presence of two ligands which trigger a similar signal transduction cascade after binding to the EGF-R may indicate ligand redundancy.;In conclusion, evidence is provided that EGF of follicular origin may play a vital role in bringing a complete physiological maturation to the porcine oocyte, including expansion of the surrounding cumulus cells.
