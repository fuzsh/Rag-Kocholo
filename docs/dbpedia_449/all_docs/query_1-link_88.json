        "text": "The Indian football team is preparing for the big test against China in the current iinternationalbreak, but coach Stephen Constantine has been dealt with a bitter blow ahead of the mega showdown as striker Balwant Singh has had to drop out because of a passport issue. As part of the preparatory camp for the AFC Asia Cup in UAE, India are set to face higher-ranked China on October 13.\n\nWhile India's rivals from the AFC Asian Cup group are playing two matches each in this internatinoal break, the Men in Blue have only the China match lined up for themselves. What has left coach Constantine rather frustrated is the fact that he wouldn't have the services of Balwant despite being impressed by the striker's recent progress.\n\n\"Balwant Singh had to drop out of the squad because his passport is not exactly six months, it's five months and a week and that's frustrating. Balwant has done really well in the last 18 months with me and he's a player we value very well. Of course, he would have had some game time but there you go,\" Constantine said at the preparatory camp in New Delhi ahead of the team's departure to China.\n\nAs per the Chinese laws, the passport of an incoming traveller must have more than 6 months of validity or the person wouldn't be allowed to enter the country. It's this rule that has struck Balwant down.\n\n\"You wake up in the morning and say this is your XI and then something happens today and it's not the XI. May be we have a Balwant situation and 'okay, may be he was going to be in the XI but now he's not', so it fluctuates. But I have an XI in my head but if I don't have them all, we have enough players and for me, there's always like if I have an opportunity to put a younger player, I will do that,\" Constantine added.\n\nThe 22-member squad is as follows:\n\nGOALKEEPERS: Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, Amrinder Singh, Karanjit Singh.\n\nDEFENDERS: Pritam Kotal, Sarthak Golui, Sandesh Jhingan, Anas Edathodika, Salam Ranjan Singh, Subhasish Bose, Narayan Das.\n\nMIDFIELDERS: Udanta Singh, Nikhil Poojary, Pronay Halder, Rowllin Borges, Anirudh Thapa, Vinit Rai, Halicharan Narzary, Ashique Kuruniyan.\n\nFORWARDS: Sunil Chhetri, Jeje Lalpekhlua, Sumeet Passi, Farukh Choudhary."
