        "text": "Mohun Bagan's prolific forward Balwant Singh is the latest player to sign up for the ISL draft, Goal can confirm.\n\nThe Punjab-born striker, who was rumoured to be on the receiving end of a massive offer from The Mariners to extend his tenure, changed his mind to opt for ISL.\n\nRivals East Bengal were also rumoured to be extremely interested in capturing the signature of the 30-year old, who has won the ISL, I-League and Federation Cup in less than a decade of professional career.\n\nIndian Super League Special: The head coaches of all teams\n\nBalwant has previously taken part in the Indian Super League with Chennaiyin FC, on loan from Mohun Bagan. The striker can now be picked up on a permanent contract by any of the 10 ISL teams from the draft, which is likely to be held on July 23.\n\nTata Steel and Delhi Dynamos will have an advantage over the other teams during the initial rounds of the draft. The former because they are new entrants building a team from scratch and the latter because they chose to not retain any of their players.\n\nISL: Blasters appoint former Man United coach Rene Meulensteen as head coach\n\nBalwant's decision to sign up for the draft shifts the balance in the 'tug of war' between the Kolkata-based clubs and the ISL and it will be interesting to see which ISL club gets the goal machine's signature."
