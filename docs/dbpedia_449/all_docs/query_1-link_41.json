        "text": "In the world of football, there are not many shining stars. In the football nursery of Mahilpur area, colorful flowers often bloom. Khalsa Senior Secondary School has produced dozens of national-level footballers. Mahilpur's AES Khalsa School, Paladi, Baddo, and Mahilpur are actively involved in producing talented footballers. What can be said about Sri Guru Gobind Singh Khalsa College, Mahilpur? This land has the distinction of producing numerous athletes who have won the Arjuna Award, such as Jarnail Singh and Gurdev Singh Gill, among many other accomplished sports personalities. The footballers from this region often participate in renowned clubs and contribute to the development of Indian football.\n\nHe is currently playing for Kolkata's Mohun Bagan club, a star player in Indian football. He has achieved several records in his sporting career. He has also represented India in various competitions, including the Indian Super League, showcasing his exceptional skills. In 2017, he announced himself as the best player of the Bengal Club. Mahilpur's community celebrated this achievement and honored him.\n\nThis dedicated and determined player began his sporting journey from Khalsa Secondary School. It is astonishing that he started playing football in the tenth grade under the inspiration of Prin. Jagmohan Singh. The principal recognized his hidden talent and nurtured it. He never left any shortcomings in his game. If he played for the school, he would be selected for the TFA Academy, Fagwara. There, Coach Sukhwinder Singh Sukhi provided him with coaching to become a national-level footballer. However, his elder brother, Sukhwinder Singh, who worked in the BSF, did not support him in pursuing a career in BSF. Nevertheless, his career in football continued to rise, and he achieved great success day by day.\n\nFootball player Balwant Singh, who was selected as the Best Indian Player of the Year for the 2013-14 season by the All India Football Players Association, showcased his playing skills impressively. He scored 17 goals during that season. Balwant Singh also participated in the Santosh Trophy, a national football championship, three times, representing the team from Shrinagar and winning the championship. In the 2014-15 I-League, he emerged as the top scorer. In the 2016-17 season, he was declared the Best Player of his team by Mohun Bagan. He also played for the Indian national team and won the Intercontinental Cup with them. In the AFC Cup qualifying match against Macau, he scored two goals, further highlighting his exceptional gameplay. In the 2018-19 season, he became a champion in the Indian Super League playing for ATK Kolkata. Unfortunately, his career was hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Despite his remarkable achievements, Balwant Singh feels that the media in Punjab does not pay enough attention to football compared to the popularity it receives in Bengal. Balwant Singh was born on December 15, 1986, to S. Sarvan Singh and Mata Ravinder Kaur in the village Rahalli. He completed his education until the 12th grade from Khalsa Secondary School and then continued playing football for Khalsa College, Mahilpur, where he displayed excellent skills, especially in speed, stamina, and power. He also played for various clubs, including Air India, Churchill Brothers Goa, and Mohammedan Sporting, showcasing exceptional gameplay. Balwant Singh honed his playing skills at the Tata Football Academy, which led to his selection for the Indian national team. He was also sent to England for training purposes. In the SAF Cup held in Bangladesh, his team defeated the Maldives to win the SAFF Championship.\n\nIn 2010, he became a member of the Indian team in the Asian Games held in China. The Indian team reached the quarterfinals but was defeated by Japan and eventually finished fourth. After participating in the Salgaocar Cup in Goa, he took a year to recover his health. In the Goa League, he made a name for himself by scoring ten goals in 2013. He won the Best Player of the Year Award by scoring three goals in the AFC Cup, four goals in the Federation Cup, and a total of 17 goals. In a friendly match with Bangladesh, he proved that he is truly a goal lover striker by scoring five goals against the Indian team. He has never let his fame get to his head and continues to dedicate himself to football day and night, contemplating and practicing new techniques. The saying holds true for him, \"When God bestows beauty, elegance follows.\"\n\nIn 2014, Balwant Singh achieved remarkable feats in his football career, which captivated football enthusiasts and the media alike. He set a record by scoring 9 goals for Kolkata League, 4 goals in the Federation Cup, 2 goals in the AFC (Asian Football Confederation) Cup, and 11 goals in the Indian Super League, earning praise from football pundits. He also scored a hat-trick in a match during his time in Kolkata. In the Indian Super League, he became the first goal scorer and won the Hero of the Match award, which included a cash prize of 50,000. Additionally, he received the Emerging Player of the Match award worth 25,000. Playing for Churchill Brothers Club, Balwant Singh established a record by scoring 10 goals in 22 league matches. He made a name for himself in the inaugural season of the Indian Football League with his outstanding performance. Playing for Bengal in the domestic league, he also had the fortune of scoring 7 goals in 9 matches. These remarkable achievements led the All India Football Federation to nominate him for the Footballer of the Year 2014 award. He has collected several records in his career as a prolific goal scorer. Balwant Singh believes that with firm determination, he can achieve every goal. When there is focus and determination in the heart and mind, one can easily earn the blessings of the Almighty. He suggests that football academies should be established in Punjab, starting from the nursery level, with proper coaching management, forming teams for competitions, paying attention to media, and working with governments honestly to create a favorable environment for sports. He also advised emerging athletes and the younger generation to make proper use of mobile phones. Balwant Singh, who enjoys driving and going on trips, is paving the way for a new generation in the field of sports."
