        "text": "When Baba Balwant Singh Ji was just one and a half years old, he contracted chickenpox. The situation became critical, affecting both of their eyes, ultimately leading to the loss of their eyesight.\n\nBaba Balwant Singh Ji, along with their parents, relocated to Village Maksodra in the Ludhiana district two years before the India-Pakistan Partition.\n\nDuring Baba Balwant Singh Ji’s childhood, he cherished listening to Baba Nand Singh Ji (Bhorle Wale), whose gentle Sikhism teachings deeply inspired their young heart. From that point forward, he became a part of Baba Nand Singh Ji’s company and relocated to the village of Bhorla with their group.\n\nBaba Nand Singh Ji developed a fondness for the little boy and took care of him. In their presence, Baba Balwant Singh Ji learned Gurbani Sangeet and recited Gurbani. Additionally, Baba Balwant Singh Ji acquired proficiency in playing musical instruments like the Harmonium and Tabla, becoming adept in the art of Gurbani Kirtan.\n\nAfter a considerable period, as Baba Balwant Singh Ji matured, and with the blessings of Baba Nand Singh Ji, they returned to Village Maksodra. During this time, they had the opportunity to meet with “Baba Puran Singh Ji” (Jothewal, dist. Amritsar). Baba Balwant Singh Ji joined Baba Puran Singh Ji’s company and accompanied them to Amritsar.\n\nOver the next few years, Baba Balwant Singh Ji perfected the art of Shabad Kirtan. During their travels, they began reciting Gurbani Kirtan. On one such journey, while walking from Amritsar, they reached Pathankot.\n\nAt Pathankot Baba Gurdial Singh met with S. Gurcharan Singh Bali. S. Gurcharan Singh Bali Ji impressed with their religious thoughts and works. They offered them to marry with Bibi Kiran Kaur ji. Then Baba ji accepted their offer and marry with Bibi Kiran Kaur ji.\n\nAfter Marriage Bibi Kiran Kaur ji got the AMRITPAN (KHANDE BATE DI PAHUL) and turned to Mata Ranjit Kaur Ji. They both moved to Tanda Urmur. At Tanda they lived at S. Sohan Singh ji Niwas for at least one year.\n\nDuring that time they purchased the land of One Kenal at Village Darapur, Tanda and established a religious place named “DUKH BHANJAN TERA NAAM”.\n\nAt that relious place thousands of people started to gather and organised gurbani kirtan sabha. Many People got AMRITPAN at that place and turned as sikhs.\n\nBaba Gurdial Singh ji started to organise 100 AKHAN PATH SAHIB and named it EKOTRI SAMAGAM.The EKOTRI SAMAGAMS are still countinued by Baba Balwant Singh ji at same place. The Samagam is organised every year at Month of OCTOBER for 21 days.\n\nBaba Balwant Singh Ji and Mata Ranjit Kaur ji used to serve the poor and needy people. Baba Ji’s Aim was to serve each Poor for their better treatment or medicines during their illness. Their Moto was ‘NO ILL SHOULD BE WITHOUT TREATMENT OR MEDICINE’.\n\nThe aim of Baba Balwant Singh was fullfilled by Present Baba ji – Baba Gurdial Singh Ji. They established a Hospital name by Baba Gurdial Singh ji Charitable Hospital."
