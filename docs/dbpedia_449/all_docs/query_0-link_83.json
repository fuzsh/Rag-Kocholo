        "text": "By Shoubhik Mukhopadhyay\n\nI-League Media Team\n\nNEW DELHI: The Scintillating Singh of Hero I-League, none other than Balwant, mesmerizes the fans day in and day out with his deceptive brutality inside the opposition box. The Green & Maroon striker has already netted 6 goals in the ongoing Hero I-League and is in no mood to pull the plug having not clinched the coveted silverware. Amongst the star-studded devastating forward lineup comprising of Pierre Boya, Katsumi Yusa and Sony Norde, ‘Punjab da Puttar’ Balwant is nothing less than a fresh Indian Breeze. At the first appearance he might not appear as an intimidating striker, but he is an astute ‘fox-in-the-box’ with a clever football brain.\n\nHowever, the uncanny football talent is a die-hard Akshay Kumar fan, who himself relates too much with the land of five rivers. Had Balwant not been a footballer, he could have ended as a successful model. The stud Singh unfolded a lot to www.i-league.org, which were undisclosed to the fans till date, ahead of the pulsating tie against Flaming Oranjes in Goa.\n\nEXCERPTS:\n\nWhat will be there in your bucket list if you have just 24 hours left in life?\n\nOh god! Just 24 hours (laughs)…First thing I’ll trademark my name- I really love mine; I would fly back to my home to spend the remaining hours with my family; On a serious note I’ll donate blood as I think it’s one of the few ways to serve the human being; If still a few hours are left with me, I’ll go for bungee jumping and finally send out a message in a bottle which might be found someday, somewhere by someone who has never heard of me.\n\nWhat will be the message in the bottle? Can you give us a hint please?\n\nHow can I say right now? It will be for the last 24 hours of my life, right?\n\nWhat is your dream destination with your date?\n\nNowhere except Miami Beach. And obviously with my partner. I don’t prefer to be in utopia.\n\nOne fine morning you find yourself in Jail. What will be the first thing you’d do?\n\nOMG Jail!!! I’ll be shocked and wonder what blunder I had made to go behind the bars.\n\nShahrukh Khan & Preity Zinta both want to sign you in their respective IPL teams. Who will you choose? (Role might be disclosed later)\n\nAny time Preity Zinta. I admire her so much since my childhood. You can’t deny that all of us loved her bubbly-type characters in the movies. She is so outspoken, jovial and obviously the Diva of Bollywood.\n\nName a movie where you would like to act as the main protagonist?\n\nMac in Garam Masala. Akki bhai portrayed the character so beautifully, it’s just amazing. I just play the movie whenever I feel low, and believe me, it works. The spontaneous dialogues, amazing acting skills and the Casanova character of Akshay Kumar makes me watch the movie again and again.\n\nTees Maar Khan, Aap ka Suroor, Ragini MMS 2- out of these three movies you are compelled to watch one ahead of a high-octane deciding match. Which one would you pick?\n\nTees Maar Khan. No matter how bad is the movie, I’ll always pick the Akshay Kumar movie while there is a choice.\n\nActing in Bollywood film/ Modelling/ Politician – What will be your choice as a career option?\n\nModelling. Won’t it suit me? (winks)\n\nHad there be incarnation, whom would you want to be in your next birth?\n\nBill Gates. He is one of the pioneers of our generation. I read a lot about him and his thinking process, positive attitude is what I applaud so much. Lastly, who doesn’t love the chunk of money that he owns, right?\n\nYou are permitted to take one person along with you in the Big Boss House. Whom will you?\n\nUndoubtedly Lionel Messi. I don’t want to step into any sort of debate,but I just worship him as the best footballer of the world. I think it’ll be the best opportunity for me to learn from him while there is no intruder and no poking from the other part of the world."
