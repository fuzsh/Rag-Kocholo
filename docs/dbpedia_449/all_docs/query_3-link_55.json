        "text": "Ms Pretam Kaur was born in Malaya where an English education was only considered for male students, and the community where Ms Kaur lived made it difficult for her parents to send her to an English learning school.\n\nAfter a battle with the community, they managed to send her where they had hoped and supported her education even though the family was facing severe financial hardship. Ms Kuar later was able to attend University and further her education.\n\nThis scholarship is in memory of Ms Kaur’s parents, Santa Singh and Balwant Kaur. The love and devotion from her parents helped support her in obtaining the best education they could provide for their daughter.\n\nMy parents’ gift of education changed my life. The story of their courage and determination has defined me. The scholarships for Indigenous women come from my parents to you, colonised and impoverished as they were, to connect to the oldest culture, and join with your dreaming.”\n\nPretam Kaur\n\nValue & benefits\n\nThis scholarship is valued at a maximum amount of up to $20,000* and over no more than 3 years.\n\nScholarships will be paid in two instalments per year, subject to satisfactory academic progression.\n\n* Each student’s final scholarship value will depend on the duration of your course at the time the scholarship is awarded."
