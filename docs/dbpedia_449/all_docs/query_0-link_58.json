That it achieved despite having top contender Belgium in its pool was hailed. However, this time India struggled with goals, failing to score any against England and then could not go beyond a brace against Spain in the opener. When forced to score a big against Wales it expectedly failed. On the other hand, scoring five goals each against Wales and Spain, England topped the pool after managing to draw strong India goalless.\n\nSpeedy Tigers coach takes a breather before tough match with Spain\n\nBy Jugjet Singh\n\nNational hockey coach Arul Selvaraj in Bhubaneswar.\n\nBHUBANESWAR: The Jagannath hindu temple in Puri was the chosen destination of Malaysian coach Arul Selvaraj to relax his mind today ahead of their encounter with Spain on Sunday.\n\nSpeedy Tigers set to be a pain to Spain\n\nBy Jugjet Singh\n\nMalaysian team players celebrate a goal during the FIH Men's Field Hockey World Cup match between Malaysia and Chile in Rourkela, India, 16 January 2023. -EPA file pic\n\nBHUBANESWAR: Spain are ranked one rung higher than Malaysia, and they stand on the Speedy Tigers' way leading to the World Cup quarter-finals.\n\nMalaysia rise to World No 9\n\nBy Jugjet Singh\n\nMalaysia’s Faizal Saari celebrates after scoring a goal during the FIH Men's Field Hockey World Cup match between Malaysia and New Zealand in Bhubaneswar, India. - EPA PIC\n\nBHUBANESWAR: Malaysia have moved up to World No 9 after beating New Zealand 3-2 in hockey's World Cup in Bhubaneswar, India, on Thursday.\n\nIndia to face Belgium in quarters if they win crossover match against NZ\n\nThe top team of each of the four pools directly qualify for the quarterfinals while the second and third-placed sides feature in crossover matches to qualify.\n\nIndia will play New Zealand in crossover match.

In 1967, 12 of the 30 games in the London Pre-Olympic Hockey tournament were held on the hallowed turf.\n\nThis tournament was billed as the first big international hockey event in England since the London 1948 Olympic Games. Twelve teams, all preparing for Mexico 1968 Olympic Games were invited with matches scheduled at Lords and the Oval.\n\nThe pitch markings at Lord's Cricket ground in 1967\n\nThe opening match of this six day tournament was at Lord’s between Great Britain and India on Monday 16 October 1967. Two pitches were laid at Lord’s. The other match, scheduled at the same time, was between Spain and German Democratic Republic (GDR).\n\nIndia were the reigning Olympic champions, having won the Gold at Tokyo 1964 Olympic Games. They were also reigning Asian Champions, having won the Gold in Bangkok in December 1966.\n\nThe Duchess of Kent was presented to both teams before the start of the match. Gurbux Singh, the Indian captain, had the pleasure of introducing his team, which included seven Sikh players to the Duchess.\n\nIndia v Great Britain match at Lords\n\nTimothy Lawson from Tulse Hill gave Great Britain the lead after 16 minutes, thus becoming the first man to score an international goal at Lord’s. Jerry Barcham of Dulwich increased the lead to put Britain 2 – 0 up at half time.\n\nSikhs score goals in the first international at Lord’s.\n\nInder Singh, India’s inside left scored within three minutes of the start of the second half and minutes later Harbinder Singh, India’s centre forward and Tokyo 1964 Gold medallist levelled the scores. Victor John Peter scored the winning goal for India.\n\nThis was, however, not the first international goal scored by a Sikh in England. This honour went to Balbir Singh Dosanjh (senior) who scored the first of his six goals in the match against Argentina at Guinness Sports Ground at Park Royal on 4 August 1948 during the London 1948 Olympic Games.\n\nGreat Britain team: D A Savage (Oxton); D. Prosser (Old Kingstonians) (captain); R Oliver (Hounslow); G.
