        "text": "Balwant Singh Â Rajoana is the prime accused in the assasination of Punjab CM Beant Singh in 31 August, 1995.Â He was born in Rajoana villageÂ in Raikot district of Punjab in a traditional Sikh Family. When he was small his Father was killedÂ by terrorists. Two motorcyclists had attacked his house but his father and his three uncles overpowered them. One of the Terrorists shot at Balwantâ€™s father, who later died.\n\nHis elder brotherÂ Kulwant Singh says that, “Â He was an intelligent boy, fond of reading novels, ghazals and poetry. He wrote too. In 1986, he joined the Punjab Police and did not come home too often”.\n\nAccording to his brother, he always said that, ” Khalsa Raj has to be brought about peacefully. We do not want violence of any kind. Even now, we have been telling the jathas to move around peacefully”.\n\nBaltej Singh, who has been Balwantâ€™s friend since childhood, remembers him as a cool, calm and shy boy. â€œWe can never believe that he joined the hardliners. Only he alone can explain how and when he became a hardliner. For us, he is the son of this village and my friend.\n\nBalwant Singh Rajoana was a constable and Â a close friend of Shaheed Dilawar Singh, another serving police officer in the Punjab Police who on 31 August, 1995 assissinated the then Chief Minister of Punjab, Beant Singh. Â Rajoana was the second human bomb to be used in case if Dilawar had failed in his mission.\n\nThe blast claimed the lives of 17 others including 3 Indian commandos. Beant Singh was accompanied by his close friend Ranjodh Singh Mann on the day of assassination, who also succumbed.\n\nThe blast occurred as Mr. Beant Singh was stepping into a heavily armored car at the the main government building in Chandigarh, the capital.Â It is Â said that the explosion threw human remains and debris more than 100 yards, and wounded 23 people, some of whom were in critical condition.\n\nJagtar Singh Hawara, Balwant Singh Rajoana, Paramjeet Singh Bheora and Â Jagtar Singh Tara were the prominent among those charged for assassinating CM Beant Singh.\n\nBalwant Singh Rajoana had â€œopenly confessedâ€ an involvement and strongly expressed no faith in Indian judiciary. He refused to defend himself in the court and accepted the sentence. He accused Indian courts for applying dual standards of law and accused Indian system for shielding culprits of Sikh genocide 1984. Â “Asking for mercy from them is not even in my distant dreams,” Rajoana said in a open letter to Media.\n\nIn his will, Â Balwant Singh expressed desire that his eyes should be transplanted to Hazoori Ragi of Darbar Sahib and Â visually impaired Lakhwinder Singh."
