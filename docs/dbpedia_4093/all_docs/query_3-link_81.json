        "text": "Share this:\n\nIt’s time for another Q&A with Alex Perez, with questions from members of The Cosmic Circus Discord! Check out his answers below, organized by topic. Questions in part one range from Avengers: Doomsday to Blade, Captain America, Daredevil, Fantastic Four, the Hulk, to name just a few. Thanks to all our Discord members for your great questions about these Marvel Studios movies and shows!\n\nBe sure to join our email list and follow The Cosmic Circus on social media to keep up with the latest articles, interviews, and reviews!\n\n[Editor’s Note: some questions below have been lightly edited for spelling/clarity.]\n\nAvengers: Doomsday & Avengers: Secret Wars\n\nrapsfan: Other than Fantastic Four, Cap4 and Thunderbolts, what other projects will lead into the Avengers movies? Thank you!\n\nAlex: Moviewise: The Marvels, Deadpool & Wolverine, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Shang-Chi & The Legend of the 10 Rings & Spider-Man 4 could be considered important. Originally, Quantumania would have been an important one to consider, now not so sure. TV-wise, Loki & What If…? are definitely up there.\n\nGodEmperorBoss: What are the comics you recommend to read before Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars?\n\nAlex: Secret Wars will always be at the top of the list. Time Runs Out could also prove to be very important. There is one comic run that I actually didn’t mention before, but I’m hearing will be very important for these films, titled Ultimate End.\n\nI could recommend more storylines to read, the problem this time around, especially with directors like the Russos, there isn’t really a comic or storyline that could properly anticipate what’s coming next because they really just build their own story using thematics from the comics as source material, rarely ever a loyal page for page adaptation of a comic run. The near exception would be Captain America: Civil War and even then, the story differed a lot from what the comic run was.\n\njadedletohater: Any chance we see James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender reprise their roles in Doomsday or Secret Wars?\n\nAlex: I really wouldn’t know this early in the game whether or not these actors would come back to reprise their roles for either of these movies.\n\nchance32252: Hey Alex, will we have an answer for who the New Avengers team members are before Doomsday?\n\nAlex: There is a strong chance you might via cast announcements and trailers, but if you’re looking for the answer in one of the upcoming projects, you’re not going to find it. The most likely scenario I’m predicting for Avengers: Doomsday is that it will mirror Avengers: Infinity War in the sense that the Avengers were also disbanded at that point in time and tried their best to come together and face the imminent threat but ultimately failed, before coming up with a new plan and team for Endgame.\n\nRJ: Hey Alex, Since Kevin Feige said not every new character that was introduced from Phase 4 would return in Avengers: Doomsday, What new characters should we expect to show up from Phase 4?\n\nAlex: Hi. It’s still kind of early to handle that type of question, since there are over a hundred characters now in the MCU. It’d be easier for me to say who we shouldn’t expect. I’d say that it’s very likely that the characters who are “isolated” so to speak, like Moon Knight, Scarlet Scarab, Werewolf by Night, Man Thing, the Eternals, Dane Whitman, & Agatha Harkness, would most likely not appear in Doomsday. I’d say the characters who could show up that are from Phase 4 are Kamala Khan, Monica Rambeau, Shang-Chi, She-Hulk, Kate Bishop, Loki and the TVA, Sylvie, & the new Guardians of the Galaxy.\n\nRJ: Is there a high chance that Kate Bishop will appear in Avengers: Doomsday?\n\nAlex: Very high chance you’ll see Kate Bishop in Avengers: Doomsday.\n\nPol: Hi Alex. How are you?\n\nAlex: I’ve been better, but I’ve also been worse. And each time, I’ve gotten up with my head held high. It’s probably been said before, but it’s important for us to get back up when we fall down, and if we can’t get back up, take a time out, but don’t give up. ❤️\n\nPol: How do you imagine Secret Wars? Could it be a send-off to previous Marvel film versions of characters?\n\nAlex: Secret Wars will probably be to Marvel what Deadpool & Wolverine was to the 20th Century Fox franchises. A proper love letter to the legacy of Marvel and everything that’s come before it.\n\nPr0tato: Hi Alex! Hope even with your busy schedule that you’ve been treating yourself well. Considering Marvel has 15-19 projects (I counted) in some state of development, do you have any idea how they’re going to release all of it before 2027‘s Secret Wars?\n\nAlex: No shot they release it all before Secret Wars. Some of these will have to be saved for post-Secret Wars.\n\nPr0tato: Is that image from Ryan Reynolds our first look at Doomsday and/or Secret Wars?\n\nAlex: What image? The one of Deadpool crying in Thor’s arms? I think it was a gag reusing the Thor: The Dark World footage, but now I think they might really have to answer that question.\n\ndirtdiver82_: Do you have any idea what changes the Russos/McFeeley are going to add to their version of Doomsday/Secret Wars?\n\nAlex: I’d be lying to you if I said I knew at this time what they were going to do.\n\nfreitxs: Hi Alex, Will Secret Wars start with the last incursion as in the comics?\n\nAlex: I think Doomsday ends with the final incursion taking place.\n\nfreitxs: There are a lot of rumors and theories saying the void will be the MCU Battleworld, is that true?\n\nAlex: I don’t doubt that we will revisit the Void again because there is so much unexplored territory out there, but I don’t know for sure that it will be Battleworld.\n\nVic: Nicolas Cage as Ghost Rider, 2005 Fantastic 4, Ben Affleck as Daredevil, Thomas Jane as Punisher, Channing Tatum as Gambit – Which one of these you want to see in Secret Wars the most, or anyone else you’d want to see?\n\nAlex: I personally would love only 1 character from these legacy films, and that is, Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards. His take on Reed Richards was one of the earliest memories I have of comic book movies, so having him back for one of these movies would legit make me cry. There are many reasons why I want him back for Secret Wars, but the main reason is because they sort of set him up in Deadpool & Wolverine. He’s named dropped by Johnny, talking about the Void as a metaphysical junkyard, so we know he was with Johnny when they arrived at the Void. Chances are the rest of the 2005 Fantastic Four were there too. But this also sets up a lot of questions. Why wasn’t he pronounced among the dead for the rebellion in the Void? Did Johnny go solo with the rebellion and the rest are just in hiding in the Void? Where is Sue? Where is Ben? I know there have been talks about getting Ioan back as Reed Richards for many ideas, one of them includes the possibility of re-introducing him as the Maker, a variant of Reed Richards, who coincidentally, has a very important role in a comics run titled Ultimate Comics: Doomsday, but regardless, the idea of having him show up for Secret Wars would be an absolute blast.\n\nVic: Is there any chance they’ll split Secret Wars into 2/3 part movies in order to set more projects on Battleworld/Give people more cameos etc. before the restart, or just make Elseworld movies thanks to this opportunity?\n\nAlex: I don’t think they’re splitting Secret Wars, mainly because originally, The Kang Dynasty felt like a part 1 of the story they were trying to build. So it stands to reason that Doomsday may follow suit.\n\nVinny: Hello Alex, I hope all is well! Will there be characters grouped together in Avengers: Doomsday like it was for Avengers: Infinity War where there is a Fantastic Four team, a Peter Parker led Spider-verse team, a Sam/Bucky led team featuring characters from Brave New World and Thunderbolts, a Carol/Bruce/Wong led team featuring Shang-Chi, Rhodey, Shuri etc, a Doctor Strange led team featuring sorcerers/magic users, a Daredevil led team featuring street level characters, a Wolverine/Deadpool led team featuring mutants, a Thor/Star-Lord led team featuring cosmic characters, a Blade led team featuring the Midnight Suns, an Eternals team and a Kate Bishop/Kamala led team featuring the Young Avengers?\n\nAlex: That’s… quite the pairing. Too many if you ask me. But I see where you’re going with it. And yeah, originally for The Kang Dynasty, you would have seen different groups taking on different variants of Kang at the same time.\n\nRebel: Hello! Which Guardians of the Galaxy characters will appear in the upcoming Avengers films, and can we expect their role to be substantial?\n\nAlex: I don’t really know right now. I think Rocket and his Guardians have a fair shot, but I’m not 100% sure yet. There was one particular rumor about Star-Lord forming the Annihilators, but I don’t know if that’s something they’re planning for one of the Avengers movies or later on down the road. Who knows? Maybe we get a Multiversal Star-Lord who is more loyal to the serious version from the comics prior to the release of the 2014 movie and get a very serious Star-Lord who formed the Annihilators and takes on Rocket’s Guardians of the Galaxy. That could be a cool premise.\n\nSecret Wars Comics Reading Guide\n\nBlack Panther\n\nchance32252: What’s next for Wakanda in the MCU?\n\nCamCam: Is there anything you can offer about a third Black Panther film?\n\nAlex: Wakanda, as I understand it, is being ruled by M’Baku and is under Jabari law. I don’t know if the plan is to antagonize him and make him a villain, but the idea is to have T’Challa II challenge M’Baku for the throne of Wakanda, and the storyline possibilities that could stem from that would be amazing if done right.\n\nBlade, Ghost Rider, Midnight Sons/Suns\n\nFluffyRafi116: Any word on Blade?\n\nAlex: It’s in a limbo state.\n\nVin: Is Blade dead?\n\nAlex: No, but it is in a weird limbo state.\n\ncandyman.brims: Hey Alex! any details on Blade‘s new plot and if everything is finally looking better in terms of its production and maybe if a director has been chosen?\n\nAlex: Nothing yet. I understand that the story they are working on is near close to completion, but IDK anything beyond that.\n\nNerdpower88🇩🇪: Hi Alex what’s the future of Blade because we didn’t hear anything new from this at the SDCC panel?\n\nAlex: The decision to not address the entire upcoming slate of Marvel movies and shows, as I understand it, stems from an idea to have audiences focus more on the immediate upcoming releases rather than focus too far ahead in the future. The reason why Doomsday and RDJ as Doom was revealed is because they wanted to tackle the whole Avengers 5 thing in one fair swoop, but Marvel’s main focus right now is Captain America: Brave New World, Thunderbolts* and Fantastic 4 for the film side, Ironheart & Daredevil: Born Again for television.\n\nEcko: Outside of Mahershala Ali reprising his role as Blade from Eternals, what connections are Blade expected to have to previous MCU projects?\n\nAlex: Think of him as the Nick Fury of the Supernatural part of the MCU.\n\nKURIKA: Hey Alex, Any news on Midnight Sons? Particularly Ghost Rider and Ryan Gosling?\n\nAlex: Aside that it’s very early in development, no. As for Ghost Rider, still deciding on how to introduce him. And I don’t know anything about actors being cast in that role.\n\nEdfleak: I’m a huge marvel and horror fan, and I’m so hyped for Agatha and Blade. I want to know if Marvel is going take more chances on horror? (I know you said there was a Midnight Sons project in development)\n\nAlex: They have some really cool ideas for horror stories in the MCU, primarily having to do with Mephisto and Lilith, so we can expect demons and vampires to kind of dominate that aspect for a bit. Agatha will also lean heavily into some horror aspects, dealing with witches and paranormal stuff so that might also pique your fancy.\n\nRedGyarados2010: Any chance that the supernatural/Midnight Suns characters, such as Werewolf By Night and Man-Thing, will appear in Avengers 5 and 6?\n\nAlex: Very unlikely at this point in time because most of these characters are detached from the rest of the MCU, even though they’re in the same universe.\n\nCaptain America: Brave New World\n\nZayKilla: Is Captain America: BWN being a Winter Soldier clone really a bad thing?\n\nAlex: I wouldn’t mind it being a Captain America: The Winter Soldier clone… if done right. Don’t get me wrong. I personally like the story they’re presenting in Captain America: Brave New World. This political thriller story with President Ross’s assassination attempt and Sam trying to uncover the mystery behind it, all under the shadow of an impending arms/world war race to get to the adamantium in Tiamut Island is a fascinating concept. Add Red Hulk into the mix just for kicks, and it sounds great on paper. But I know people will find reasons to argue and claim “The MCU is dead” after it releases.\n\nZayKilla: Also, will Sam be and/or the leader of the Avengers in Doomsday/Secret Wars?\n\nAlex: You can consider Sam as one of the leaders for the Avengers in these upcoming films.\n\nCaptain America Sam Wilson Comics Reading Guide\n\nCaptain Marvel, Monica Rambeau, S.W.O.R.D.\n\njjlouis: Hi Alex. What are the chances of a third Captain Marvel movie?\n\nAlex: No plans currently exist for a 3rd Captain Marvel movie.\n\ndaofeiboy: Will Phyla-Vell storyline ever cross with Carol Danvers?\n\nAlex: No clue. Both characters exist in the MCU, so maybe their paths might cross soon.\n\ndaofeiboy: When are we seeing Monica Rambeau again?\n\nAlex: Avengers films for sure.\n\nwd172: I hope you’re feeling better Alex! Will S.W.O.R.D return?\n\nAlex: Yeah, S.W.O.R.D will return.\n\nDaredevil: Born Again, friends and enemies\n\nVacanus: Hi Alex! I hope you’re doing well, and I’m happy to hear we’ll be seeing you on Discord more! I just have a couple of DDBA questions. How large of an impact do you expect Muse to have on Daredevil, Fisk, or even the city of NY?\n\nAlex: Muse is going to be an interesting antagonist in the sense that he’ll put Daredevil and Fisk in a position we haven’t seen before with their portrayals, having a common enemy. He’ll introduce a very interesting dynamic that will have repercussions to come, especially for “vigilantes”.\n\nVacanus: One thing that made Muse so unique in the comics was how “creative”, albeit sick, he was with his crimes. Do you think the show will be willing to show off how sadistic Muse is as a character?\n\nAlex: I think so. One thing Marvel is doing is broadening their horizons by allowing more mature themes to be established. Just look at Echo and Deadpool & Wolverine.\n\nMAYKRAWAEV: Hi Alex. Do you know if Bullseye will have an expanded role in Daredevil: Born Again season 2?\n\nAlex: Too early to say.\n\nSeid: Hey Alex, I hope you’re doing well. Would Daredevil S1 pt. 2 release before or after Spider-Man 4? They are both filming this fall at the same time & location.\n\nAlex: I would say after, but again, we’ll have to wait and see.\n\nHifive326: You’ve previously mentioned before Marvel has potential plans for Luke Cage. Any hope of seeing him and the other Defenders in Daredevil:Born Again s2 (besides the previously rumored Jessica Jones)?\n\nAlex: I have no info on that atm.\n\nCool51: Hello! Hope all is going well! There’s been a lot of talk on street level action between SM4, a potential Hawkeye season 2, DDBA, and I was curious if Marvel had any plans of bringing in some more villains to go along with it, since we only know of Fisk being the main overarching one as of now, along with Muse in DDBA?\n\nAlex: There are a lot of street-level rogues Marvel Studios wants to incorporate. Off the top of my head, I know they want to bring back Scorpion. And I know they want to introduce the Maggia.\n\nKingpin Reading Guide\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine (spoilers)\n\nLukeb4577: Hi Alex! Hope you’re doing well. Did Paradox intend to eliminate Earth 10005 because Logan was going to die in the future? As opposed to him having already died in that world.\n\nAlex: The only reason why Paradox wanted to eliminate that timeline was because he didn’t want to wait around thousands of years for it to slowly die and decay, hence using the time ripper. To answer your question, it really is a matter of perspective relating to Logan’s death because time works differently in the TVA as opposed to other timelines.\n\nThe TVA has the ability to oversee a timeline at different points in its existence. The timeline Deadpool & Wolverine is set in, Earth-10005, has a fixed point in 2029, which is Logan’s death at the end of Logan. For Paradox (and the audience), this event already happened. But for Deadpool and his friends, it’s something that’s yet to happen, because the film is set in 2024. The problem with Deadpool is with his 4th-wall break, he could acknowledge these events already happened because he doesn’t follow normal rules of character writing.\n\nLukeb4577: If there are multiple anchor beings in a universe (example being Deadpool and Wolverine for Earth 10005), do they BOTH need to die for the universe to decay?\n\nAlex: It’s way too early to tell how exactly two anchor beings affect the space-time matrix of Earth-10005. All we know for certain is that right now, Deadpool and Wolverine’s actions at the end of the movie made them the new anchor beings, preventing the disintegration of their timeline, and even regenerating their timeline, which introduces a lot of interesting new concepts heading into Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars.\n\nAn_Anomaly: Hi Alex, What is Deadpool’s universe future, will it be destroyed? Or collide with the main 616 earth?\n\nAlex: We will revisit Earth-10005 soon. As to its fate, who’s to say?\n\nAn_Anomaly: What happen to the other members of the resistance? Did they survive?\n\nAlex: Yeah. Fun fact, I think you can see Gambit returning to his home universe in the PCS of Deadpool & Wolverine.\n\nAfter Hours Media: Hey, Alex. Is there any exact info you’ve had regarding the Deadpool timeline – or is it just an educated guess? The continuity in the movies don’t work. Especially that of Logan being canon to Deadpool.\n\nAlex: Respectfully, the exact info you’re going to get is the movies. Let’s start with Days of Future Past. That movie takes place in 3 different time periods, Dystopian-2023, 1973 and the new 2023. When Logan goes back in time from Dystopian-23 to 1973, the point in time he has to change to save his world is Mystique killing Bolivar Trask. In the original X-Men continuity, Mystique kills Trask, leading to the timeline where we have X-Men, X2, X-Men: The Last Stand, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, The Wolverine and the dystopian future in Days of Future Past.\n\nWhen Mystique changed her mind and didn’t kill Trask, a new timeline was made, the one where we see Logan inside the X-Mansion on Thursday, June 29th, 2023. At the same time, thanks to the events of Days of Future Past, the events of X-Men Origins: Wolverine never happened, rewriting the origin and birth of Deadpool, who now exists in this new timeline of films. The main bulk of Deadpool takes place in 2016 and Deadpool 2 takes place in 2018. That same year, Wade uses Cable’s Time Device to mess around with his timeline and somehow ends up on Earth-616 to have his interview with Happy Hogan, which then jumps to the 6 years later bit in Earth-10005, making the year Deadpool & Wolverine is set in is 2024.\n\nNow, to answer your question about how canon Logan is to Deadpool, yes it is. It’s confirmed twice. First, it was confirmed years ago by Logan’s director, James Mangold, that the events of Logan occurred in 2029, and it is set a few years after Days of Future Past. Then, it’s confirmed by Paradox in Deadpool & Wolverine that Logan was the anchor being of that timeline that Deadpool & Wolverine is set in, making the events of Logan being set in the same universe as the Deadpool threequel.\n\nTherefore, with Mangold confirming that the events of Days of Future Past occurred in the same timeline that Logan, and with Deadpool and Wolverine confirming that the events of Logan did indeed occur in the same timeline, then by the transient property of equality, it stands to reason that the continuity of Earth-10005 is as follows:\n\nDays of Future Past (2023)\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine (2024)\n\nThe Westchester Incident (2028)\n\nLogan (2029)\n\nIf your main argument, is that Deadpool complains about Logan’s death in Deadpool 2, or that the X-Men from Apocalypse and Dark Phoenix films show up in that film and not making it canon, the simplest answer is that it’s a 4th wall break meant as a gag and not something that should be considered when taking into account the canon of the timeline.\n\nMAYKRAWAEV: Do you think Deadpool will appear in something other than the future Avengers films? Maybe DP4 or X-Men?\n\nAlex: I think so. Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool is a guaranteed box office hit.\n\nreju.: Hi Alex, I’ve always been your fan. I have questions… There was information from Sneider that Mobius will appear in Deadpool & Wolverine. Was this true? If so, what was the original plot of this movie supposed to look like?\n\nAlex: It was true at one point, yes. The plot of Deadpool & Wolverine had a lot of ideas and changes that ultimately didn’t make the final cut or ever left the drawing board.\n\njadedletohater: Why was Thor crying?\n\nAlex: I really don’t know. To me, it was just a gag using footage from Thor: The Dark World, but now I’m sure they’ll probably make something out of it.\n\njestrogogo: Hey Alex! Thanks for doing the Q&A! What trailers will be released online from D23 next week, maybe Born Again teaser and another Agatha trailer also an Ironheart trailer?!\n\nAlex: I have no way of knowing what will come out online and what will be kept private. Most likely they’ll make it public, since they’ve done so in the past, but we’ll see.\n\njestrogogo: Will Wolverine and Deadpool come back before the avengers movies, or we will have to wait until Avengers: Doomsday and Secret Wars?\n\nAlex: Most likely we’ll wait until Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars.\n\njoshua: Hi Alex, What’s the deal with two Wolverines on Earth-10005 now, is there a possibility of Hugh Jackman playing both of them in Secret Wars, or will they just ignore him to preserve the ending of Logan?\n\nAlex: I really don’t know how they’ll address it if they even do. The way I would handle it is by saying that what Deadpool and Wolverine did at the end of the movie essentially rewrote the space-time matrix of Earth-10005, making him the prime Wolverine and the other one just doesn’t exist anymore since the universe was at the literal edge of spaghettification. Having two Wolverines on Earth-10005 just seems like such a hassle to deal with going into Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine Discussion (Cosmic Circle Ep. 60)\n\nDoctor Doom and Robert Downey Jr.’s return at SDCC\n\narn0_20: Is RDJ’s Doom really… Doom?\n\nAlex: Robert Downey Jr. is playing a variant of Doctor Doom, i.e., not the one set in Earth-616. Whether this variant is Victor Von Doom or Tony Stark, there’s still way too much debate. Inside scoopers who knew about this before SDCC say RDJ is a Tony Stark variant being Doctor Doom, trades say Victor because of what the Russos’ said at SDCC. The truth is, we won’t know until much later.\n\nElyse✨ – Shoalsandsuch: Hi Alex! Hope you’re feeling better! Will Doom’s role be similar to what was originally planned for Kang?\n\nAlex: In the sense that he’ll have an antagonistic presence, yes, but I think it’ll be far bigger than what was originally planned for Kang.\n\ncapelli: Hey Alex, hope you’re doing well! How will Doctor Doom get enough power to possibly fight Loki and become the King of the Multiverse? Especially since, we haven’t been introduced to the Beyonders or Molecule Man in the MCU.\n\nAlex: Doom has always been a resourceful individual in the comics. I’m certain Marvel Studios will adapt him in a similar fashion.\n\nCym: Hey there Alex! Hope you’ve been well thank you for doing these for us, they’re greatly appreciated! Why did Marvel decide to debut Doctor Doom this early and as a variant?\n\nAlex: I’ve been asking myself that very same question since the announcement. Because for the longest time, they were looking into recasting Kang given how much they invested into the storyline with him. Now with Doom being shoehorned in at the last minute, it’s gonna feel slightly odd, but I’ll give it a chance to cook.\n\nCym: Is Kang still going to be the final villain for Secret Wars, or is Marvel really done using this character?\n\nAlex: It appears they may be done, but I personally wouldn’t be surprised if the character returns as someone or something else, and then take the opportunity to recast the character. There are still too many story gaps left unfinished.\n\nLiam | Kate Bishop Fan: Is it possible that with Doom now in the mix, marvel might combine certain projects (specifically Young Avengers, Scarlet Witch and Wiccan show) and do the Children’s crusade storyline properly?\n\nAlex: There is a potential for that relationship to be explored with Doom now seeking to create Battleworld, but we’ll see what happens.\n\nPierre Chanliau: Alex, do you believe (or know) if Doctor Doom (not specifically the Doom in Doomsday and Secret Wars) will become a recurring presence in the MCU even after Secret Wars?\n\nAlex: I can confirm that they had plans for Doom post-Secret Wars before he was confirmed to be appearing in Doomsday and Secret Wars, and it’s very likely those storylines they had planned will continue to be used. One of those included even the possibility of a spinoff project in the very far distant future, but it’s because Doom is currently on a similar playing field to Loki in the sense that he is beloved by fans. The main issue here is that I don’t think that RDJ will be the Doom we see in 616 moving forward, and he’ll be recast with a new variant.\n\nRebel: Hello! Do you expect Dr. Doom to show up anywhere else in the MCU besides a pcs for The Fantastic Four before Avengers: Doomsday?\n\nAlex: No. I don’t really see Doom popping up anywhere else.\n\nSungate: Hey Alex, thanks for all the scoops and this Q&A Are we gonna see a live action adaptation of Latveria?\n\nAlex: Like in Doomsday and Secret Wars? I’m not sure. Maybe?\n\nSungate: Is Doom in any way related to Tony Stark?\n\nAlex: Look, there is so much mystery as to whether or not RDJ is Victor or if he’s Tony. Trades say Victor. Scoopers say Stark. I say Tony would be a better fit, but we’ll have to wait and see.\n\nLouai Turkmani: Hey Alex do you think a Cillian Murphy Doctor Doom is still possible? RDJ isn’t sticking around forever.\n\nAlex: It’s possible.\n\nDoctor Strange\n\ndirtdiver82_: Hey Alex, is Doctor Strange 3 still going to be a pre-Secret Wars film and still possibly adapt elements of Time Runs Out?\n\nAlex: I’m not entirely sure. A lot of the ideas they had for it certainly looked like could work for a third Doctor Strange movie. And what made it work was that it would justify Strange’s absence in Avengers 5 before returning for Secret Wars. Now, I’m not so sure. But I hope it is made. Strange was poised to have one of the biggest roles in the Multiverse Saga against Kang, and they had some really good story ideas for the character, one of which raised the question as to whether or not Strange was actually a hero in the grand scheme of the Multiverse. His words say one thing, but his actions in the Multiverse say otherwise. The more “help” he wants to do, the more damage he does to the fabric of reality.\n\nEternals\n\nmatisha: Hi, Alex! Kevin stated that there are no immediate plans for the Eternals sequel, but is it in the works after Secret Wars or Doomsday, can we expect appearances here and then with some Eternals?\n\nAlex: I know Eternals will be in Marvel Zombies and in What If…?, so that might be the closest you get to seeing them again for the time being.\n\nNothingMovesTheBlob: Hi, Alex! Hope you are doing well and getting the time and space you need. With the Eternals not getting a sequel, there are some loose ends there. How will they affect the future of the MCU moving forward? Will Eros and Pip return? Thanks for all that you do!\n\nAlex: Thanks! Idk how they’ll handle the Eternals storyline moving forward. I know ideas for a sequel already exist, but whether or not they’re explored remains to be seen.\n\nFantastic Four\n\nAgent Alex Mahone: Hello Alex, I hope you are fine and well. Will Marvel Games or Activision finally release Marvel Ultimate Alliance and X-Men Legends back on Steam, if there’s something you might know about it?\n\nAlex: I have no idea, but now I’ll have to look into it because I loved those games.\n\nAgent Alex Mahone: If Galactus is the only one in the Multiverse, are those other Galactuses just him travelling from one place to another in different form, or is it like with Darkseid from Final Crisis?\n\nAlex: So, I spoke out of turn when I was discussing Galactus in the podcast and referred to him as the only being in the multiverse. I take full blame for that and want to say right now I was wrong in that aspect. I was course corrected by my source after the podcast, and they explained that he’s not the only Galactus in the Multiverse, but rather, he emerged from another universe, particularly following along to a comic run that released in 2013 titled Hunger. So I highly recommend that everyone read that comic run in preparation for Fantastic Four.\n\nGeral_dark: Hi Alex! There are so many productions to expand this multiverse saga further like Spider-Man 4, Blade, Young Avengers, Doctor Strange 3, etc. How are they going to do it in less than 2/3 years?\n\nAlex: Guess we’ll have to see.\n\nGeral_dark: Recently, the insider M3 apparently leaked some parts about the script of Fantastic Four, and he said that Galactus would not be defeated in this film. If this rumor is true, could Galactus be one of the villains along with Doctor Doom in Avengers: Doomsday and Secret Wars, or will he only be exploited after Secret Wars?\n\nAlex: I’ve only heard Galactus will be dealt with in Fantastic Four. There is credence to the rumor of Galactus not being defeated by the heroes, HOWEVER, Galactus’ story, at least for that universe, will end there. Although, sacrifices will have to be made.\n\nEcko: I’m worried about H.E.R.B.I.E. not being confirmed for Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars, despite The Fantastic Four and Doctor Doom returning.\n\nAlex: We’ll have to wait and see.\n\nFantastic Four Reading Guide: 1998-2024\n\nHulk\n\nTonystarsR_40k: Hi Alex! When do you think we will have a fight between Hulk vs Wolverine? (a film about them is possible?)\n\nAlex: Marvel wants the Avengers and the X-Men to face off before the Multiverse Saga ends, and they really want for Wolverine and Hulk to have their fight scene moment.\n\nTonystarsR_40k: will Hulk/Bruce have an important role in the next Marvel films and in which ones?\n\nAlex: Yes, in Avengers.\n\nThe one below all: Hi Alex, how are you? Still sick when you wrote the article?\n\nAlex: Feeling slightly better! Thank you!\n\nThe one below all: Next appearance and story for Bruce Banner (Hulk) and Skaar in the MCU?\n\nAlex: Possibly Cap 4 if they managed to pull it off, but definitely in Avengers for Bruce. Skaar, no clue.\n\nThe one below all: What do you think is their best way for Hulk to once again become the pillar of Marvel, like Iron Man and Captain America? What would you do, taking into account, of course, the existing projects (with current projects)?\n\nAlex: I would adapt a World War Hulk project in which Banner would face off against Thunderbolt Ross & the US Government for creating an artificial serum that can replicate the Hulk’s powers. Really get introspective about Banner and Hulk, why Banner wanted to keep the Hulk and his powers out of government hands, and just dive deep into his psyche.\n\nBraveFire: I heard you talk about Multiversal Masters of Evil team, and I had also heard quite a few rumors about the possibility of adapting Maestro in live action. Since now Doom is the villain of the Avengers films I said to myself that it was now possible that Maestro (evil version of Hulk) could play a major role in the Avengers films given his importance in the secret wars comics and his close link with Dr doom (he has faced several times and has already united with him in SW)?\n\nAlex: I had made a theory a while back about World War Hulk being set in Battleworld, with Maestro as the villain. I say it’s definitely plausible.\n\nBraveFire: Will the Leader, Red Hulk and Betty Ross be there only for Cap4, and will they have the opportunity to confront Hulk and Banner again?\n\nAlex: One of them will have their story end in Captain America: Brave New World. The other two have potential to continue moving forward.\n\nThat’s it for now! You can read some of Alex Perez’s past articles and reports here and then discuss with others in the Discord.
