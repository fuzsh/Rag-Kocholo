        "text": "The grand lobby at the entrance to the Petersen Events Center has been renamed the Thomas E. Richards Family lobby in honor of the member of Pitt’s 1974 Elite Eight team who later became chair of the university’s board of trustees.\n\nRichards died in October, and his wife, Mary Beth, fulfilled his wish in making a $5 million donation from the couple to the basketball program that was formally announced Tuesday.\n\nA Moon native who starred at Moon Area High School, Richards was at Pitt from 1972-76, playing on the Panthers team that went 25-4 in 1973-74 and earning the prestigious Blue-Gold Award (honoring Pitt athletes who excel in academics, athletics, leadership and citizenship) as a senior.\n\n“Tom Richards’ legacy shines brightly at the University of Pittsburgh and beyond,” Pitt athletics director Heather Lyke said in a prepared statement. “He was a leader throughout his life — as a star point guard, an accomplished (CEO) and, most importantly, as a husband, father and cherished friend. Tom inspired and impacted so many people, and that was especially true at Pitt. This extraordinary gift is yet another example.”\n\nMary Beth also played basketball at Pitt, and their children, Lindsay and Jason, spent time on the coaching staffs for the women’s and men’s programs, respectively.\n\n“The Richards Family has been important part of the Pitt Basketball community and has made a tremendous impact on the lives of so many,” Pitt coach Jeff Capel said in a statement. “I am grateful for the relationship I was able to build with Tom before his passing and for the friendships that we maintain with Jason and the Richards family. Pitt Basketball is extremely thankful for the generous gift to the program but even more thankful for the impact Tom and his family continue to have here at the University of Pittsburgh.”\n\nRichards spent 45 years in the technology industry before retiring from a post as the CEO of CDW in 2018. He was part of Pitt’s board of trustees from 2011-21, serving as its chair beginning in 2019.\n\n“This lobby, which sits at the heart of the action, is a fitting tribute for a man who put the University of Pittsburgh at the heart of his life,” Pitt chancellor Patrick Gallagher said."
