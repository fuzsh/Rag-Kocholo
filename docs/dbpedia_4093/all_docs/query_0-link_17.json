        "text": "Cory Richards was about to attempt an unclimbed route up the seventh-highest mountain in the world when he realized he needed to stop before he started.\n\nHe was crying uncontrollably in his tent at base camp. The world was so loud, he said, it was as if he was standing between two freight trains going in opposite directions. And yet, Richards, who has long suffered from bipolar disorder, was exhilarated.\n\n“I might actually die and that is really exciting to me,” Richards, 40, recalls thinking in early April as he looked up 26,795-foot Dhaulagiri, in west-central Nepal.\n\nTwo days from the nearest village and alarmed by his deteriorating mental health, he reached out to his therapist back home. That night, he told his teammates — Carla Perez and Esteban Mena, professional alpinists from Ecuador, and Tommy Joyce, a filmmaker documenting the expedition — that he was leaving, a decision his therapist supported.\n\n“He told us he didn’t have it in him anymore and that he was going to go home,” Joyce wrote in an email.\n\nRichards would fly by helicopter to Kathmandu before boarding a plane to his home in Boulder, Colo., leaving his teammates five days after the team arrived in base camp to attempt the climb.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
