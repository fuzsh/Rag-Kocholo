        "text": "This year marks the 40th anniversary of the debut of Channel 7 drama series Sons and Daughters which made household names of stars such as Peter Phelps, Ally Fowler and Cornelia Francis.\n\nAnd who could forget Rowena Wallace for her Gold Logie-winning performance as the infamous ‘Pat the Rat’.\n\nWatch as Tom Richards talks about TV classic Sons and Daughters\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\nAnother star was Tom Richards who played the role of David Palmer on the show for six seasons before it eventually wound up in 1987.\n\nTom joined The Morning Show and recalled being cast in the soap after a four year-run on drama Matlock Police.\n\nHe said had did not expect the series to become such a hit with its various plot twists and turns that it even has online fan pages more than three decades after it ended.\n\n“There were some funny things in it, and some good things, some dramatic things and you think ‘My god can that really happen?’ but you trust the writers, they all did a good job and the show was well-received,” he said.\n\n“The good thing about Sons and Daughters is ... I made a DVD where I interviewed one of the fans and she had books and photos (of the show) and she said really she just related to the Palmers as a working-class family.”\n\nThe actor also revealed how behind the scenes, the cast and crew were almost like family, spending time together after filming to have a few drinks and even going on several trips together overseas to the UK and Europe where they were mobbed by thousands of fans.\n\nWhen asked if rebooting Sons and Daughters for a new generation could work, Richards agreed.\n\n“I think I would be good, different cast, get some old folks in there like myself ... I think it could work, it’s a nice little family show,” he said."
