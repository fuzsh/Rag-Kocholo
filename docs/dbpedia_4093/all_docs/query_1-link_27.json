        "text": "One of the UK's top stunt men, Terry Richards, who starred in more than 100 films including Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark has died aged 81.\n\nHe played the Cairo Swordsman in the first Indiana Jones film, famously trying to goad Harrison Ford into a sword fight only to be shot dead.\n\nIn a 50-year career, Richards worked on nine 007 films, opposite four different Bonds, before retiring in 1999.\n\nHe also doubled for Donald Sutherland, Tom Selleck and Christopher Lee.\n\n\"He fought Indiana Jones, James Bond, Luke Skywalker and Rambo - there's not many people who can say that,\" his son Terry Richards Junior told the BBC.\n\nHis final film was Bond adventure Tomorrow Never Dies, which saw him beating up Pierce Brosnan in a recording studio, while other films included The Avengers, The Princess Bride, Zulu and The Dirty Dozen.\n\n\"He was a great character, a good story teller, very charming and full of humour, and was well loved and respected in the film industry,\" said his family.\n\nRichards was born David Terence Richards in south London in 1932, but was known to everyone as Terry.\n\nHe joined the film industry in 1957, when a friend in the Welsh Guards told him they needed extras with military training.\n\n\"He was paid extra to fall off some scaffolding in a riot scene, which he did for a few extra pounds, and that was the beginning of his stunt career,\" said his daughter in law, Lisa Thomas.\n\nRichards was soon working with stars like Kirk Douglas in The Vikings (1958) and became a founding member of The Stunt Register in 1960.\n\nHis family revealed he died suddenly last Saturday 14 June, and his funeral is scheduled to take place in Ruislip, north west London, later.\n\n\"He was still in good health but he was more ill than he thought,\" said Mr Richards.\n\nMr Richards said his father had enjoyed \"a good life\" travelling all over the world.\n\n\"He'd been dragged behind cars, fallen off buildings, shot, punched. He always used to get up, but this time sadly he wasn't getting up.\""
