        "meta_description": "Victor Navasky, highly regarded journalist, editor, author and educator, is best known for his close association with The Nation, America's longest continuously published weekly magazine. He was its editor from 1978-1995, publisher and editorial director from 1995-2005, and is now publisher emeritus. He has also written a number of award-winning books and contributed articles and reviews to numerous magazines and journals. Navasky is Professor of Journalism and Director of the George Delacorte Center for Magazine Journalism at Columbia University and serves as Chairman of the Columbia Journalism Review. The collection provides a broad view of Victor Navasky's life, his interests, and his work. It contains many items of a personal nature such as school and military records, family correspondence, and photographs. Biographical articles, interviews and resumes are included, along with materials reflecting the history of The Nation and Navasky's association with the magazine. His books, articles, essays, plays, and speeches are represented, along with extensive research, intermediate writing products, and other related items. Materials drawn from his continuing career at Columbia University, as well as a large series of varied subject files, form a significant part of the collection. There is a small audio-visual series containing, for example, audio recordings of a number of interviews Navasky conducted for his book, Naming Names, and an event honoring I.F. Stone on his 80th birthday.",

        "text": "This subseries contains research material of various types including correspondence; articles (many annotated by Navasky); court documents; bibliographic note cards, topical research (e.g., censorship, anti-Communism, Smith Act); and interviews or parts of interviews in various formats. (Note that in Series X: Audio-Visual Materials, researchers may access a number of recorded interviews with individuals such as Albert Maltz, Fred Donner, Estelle Foreman, and Leo Townsend.)\n\nOf those affected by the blacklist, the most extensively represented in the subseries are Elia Kazan, Arthur Miller, Albert Maltz, and Tony Kraber, although there is a wealth of material on numerous others. Copies of HUAC testimony are available for a number of those who were called to appear before the Committee.\n\nOf particular note is a series of questionnaires whose respondents include Ring Lardner Jr., Will Geer, Elia Kazan, John Houseman, Lester Cole, and many others. These documents were made available by Robert Vaughn, the American actor best known for his television role in the 1960s series The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and his Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor (1960) in The Young Philadelphians. Vaughn had continued his education during his acting career, earning a PhD from the University of Southern California in 1970. His dissertation, which he published as a book in 1972 (Only Victims: A Study of Show Business Blacklisting) was based on original research, primarily questionnaires and interviews. Duplicates of the questionnaire responses were given to Victor Navasky in 1975.\n\nIn addition to actual research, this subseries contains materials created in support of the research. Examples include his address book at the time, calendar pages, correspondence, expense sheets, and documentation of a trip he made to California in June of 1976."
