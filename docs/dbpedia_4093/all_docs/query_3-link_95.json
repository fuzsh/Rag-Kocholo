At the first U.S. census. Md. By U.S. Bureau of the Census. Washington, 1907. (189p.): 97\n\nCaesar was charged in August 1777 of disturbing the peace of the body of Thomas Waters and John Smith. He was convicted in March 1778. Two men, Benjamin Smith and William Richards, pledged security to ensure that the fine would be paid; we assume the William Richards was his Caesar’s brother, but we don’t know who John Smith was. Baseless theories: it was during the time of fidelity oaths and routing out of the Loyalists (my thought and Michael Hait's independently). Perhaps one of them had a sister Priscilla (wouldn't that simplify things--or complicate it, not sure)? Alan and I both independently wondered if perhaps one or both of them commented on the race of his wife and/or kids if Priscilla were Peck. Maybe something entirely more pedestrian like the best police reports on the news with \"alcohol may have been involved.\" There was an Obediah Smith who was a Corporal in the Maryland Loyalists regiment [pp 9 (May 1778) and 111 (September 30th, 1778)]. And a Lt. Col. Wm. S. Smith helped command the Eastern Department May-Oct 1777 (p. 125). No idea yet of any connections. “In May, 1778, [Maryland gentleman James] Chalmers’ regiment was stated to number 336 in all, and it probable that, cut off from its recruiting base by the evacuation of Philadelphia in the next month, it never numbered more.” [partial list of regiment, but commission officers is believed to be complete] p.7 https:/archive.org/detailsorderlybookofmar00mary Orderly book of the \"Maryland loyalists regiment,\" June 18th, 1778, to October 12th, 1778.

I have included correspondence with others so it doesn't flow well. I do have further information, my email is aalan@@enol.com Alan\n\nCharles Co Wills, 1780-1791\n\nPage 436.Martha Richards, Will. I, Martha Richards of CC, am weak of body but of perfect mind and memory.Firstly, all my debts are to be paid.To my son Thomas Richards - 1 feather bed & furniture, 1 hand mill, 1 gray horse called Silve, 1 large iron pot, and 1 pewter dish. To my son Caesar Richards - 1 feather bed & furniture, 1 gray mare called Starling, and 1 middle sized shallow pewter dish. To my son Richard Richards - 1 Negro girl named Lavina and middle sized deep pewter dish. To my daughter Francess Bean - 7 shillings and 6 pence. To my 3 granddaughters bearing my Christian name - the best of my wearing clothes, to be equally divided between them. To my 4 sons, namely, Thomas, Caeasar, Richard, and William - all my ready cash, with what remains on book, to be equally divided between them. To my son William Richards - my best feather bed and furniture and 1 bay mare and colt and all the crop now made or making, and the rest of my estate.Executors: my sons Thomas and William. Signed Oct 5, 1784 - Martha (X her mark) Richards.Wit - G. Adams, George Adams Jr, Milburn (X his mark) Mahawny. Probated on Dec 14, 1784 by the oaths of both executors and by the oaths of witnesses George Adams Sr, George Adams Jr. and Milburn Mahoney.\n\nI have the children of Caesar Richards as: Richard B., James H. who married Ann Marlow, 20 Dec 1796; Thomas, Gabriel who married Sarah Robey 12 May 1812 in Prince Georges Co., Md.; Leonard Ramsey, b. 1794 and died 7 May 1830- (his tombstone ) another *source says he was born 2 Dec 1787. He married Christina Montgomery; Ann who married Charles Robey; Mary who married Samuel Marlow, 19 Jan 1797; Sarah, b. 19 Aug 1794 and married Thomas Padgett; Delilah;Orphans Court Records, Charles Co. 1823-24, p. 291, Reps of Caesar Richards: Delilah, Richard B., Charles Robey, Elizabeth Montgomery. 1815-1818, p. 560 Accounts & Inventories, Charles Co., Md. Distribution of estate to wife and 8 children, Elizabeth Montgomery, Admin., DBN. There is a good book in the DAR Library called \"The Richards Family of Charles Co., Md.\" by Louise Hancock Graves, July 1978. She has referenced her material. I can't find out where she got Leonard's birthdate which does not match with his tombstone. She has listed the children in the order that I have given them to you. Mary comes before Sarah, b. 1794 - so how could Sarah and Leonard been born in the same year? A source she also used was a \"Mudd\" Genealogy Book. The *\"Revolutionary Patriots of Charles Co., Md.\" says Caesar was born 1758-and died Dec. 14, 1813. It says his son, Leonard was born 1787 and died 1830. I'm inclined to think that whomever did the tombstones was wrong! The Rev. Patriots book uses as their source: S=Maryland Society, Sons of the American Revolution and J=DAR patriot Index.\n\nIndex to register of King George's Parish 1689-1801 > >Leonard Richard b.

John Weems was paid for the sermon. Rev. Weems was the priest at Port Tobacco Parish, an Episcopal Church.
