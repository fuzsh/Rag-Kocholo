Although I do NOT question the age of this small silver nutmeg grater, my concern is that the makerâs mark is unlike any other hallmark that I have seen and that under magnification, it seems that the bedding (back portion) of the mark consists of parallel vertical (cut??) lines rather than â??stamped??â[SEE image #1 & #3].\n\nWhy would there be parallel lines?\n\nWhy is there a halo line (mark) above the hallmark?[SEE image #3]. There also is a non-alignment of the features within the mark; is this due to a double stamping with the marking tool?[SEE all images, but seen best in Image #2].\n\nI seek to verify the mark as genuinely that of âSayre & Richardsâ and would welcome any suggestions how I might do this.\n\nThanks\n\nJim K.\n\nP.S. I have added a fourth image containing known \"Sayre & Richards\" hallmarks from three public sources.\n\nP.P.S. I HAVE ADDED A FIFTH IMAGE OF THE NUTMEG GRATER. I have no question regarding the age of this item. The opposing hinges making the lids open in opposite directions is a rather unusual feature. Construction methods are first half nineteenth century, most likely first quarter: 1800 ~ 1825.\n\n[CLOSED MEASURES 1 1/4\" LONG / 1\" DIAM.]\n\nIP: Logged\n\nwev\n\nModerator\n\nPosts: 4121\n\nRegistered: Apr 99\n\nposted 06-09-2008 08:21 PM Hmmmm.\n\nThe typeface used in the mark is very close to Century Schoolbook designed by Benton for Collier's Magazine in 1890. It is not at all what I would expect to see -- in terms of letterform -- in a punch cut c 1805, when most all were based on some variant of Caslon, Baskerville, or Bodoni. I am also disturbed by the inconsistency of the double strike -- the shift of the oval is not nearly enough to account for the large shift of the & and R. And where is the remnants of the first S?\n\nIP: Logged\n\njim klopfer\n\nPosts: 5\n\nRegistered: Jun 2008\n\nposted 06-09-2008 10:46 PM Thank you for your thoughts. I added an additional image containing three known \"sayre & Richards\" hallmarks from publically available sources. The lettering is very similar, but not exact. Note image #2; the tail of the \"R\" turns up. Did early silversmiths have several hallmarking tools, so that the marks vary???

Made by the partnership of John Sayre and Thomas Richards of New York City, it measures approximately 4-1/8\" in diameter and is about 1-1/2\" tall. The key hole handle is typical of the American form and is marked on the back S & R in a rounded rectangular punch. There is a feather script monogram G B W on the front of the handle and a later presentation inscription Francis Philip Nash August 14th on the front of the bowl. This porringer is in excellent condition with no dents or apparent repairs. Early Sayre family coin silver is always very collectible, and this porringer will make an excellent addition to any collection of early Sayre family silver!\n\nIP: Logged\n\nswarter\n\nModerator\n\nPosts: 2920\n\nRegistered: May 2003\n\nposted 06-09-2008 11:45 PM I don't know what to make of the mark on the grater, either - it is hard to intterpret from photographs alone. As far as the ebay porringer is concerned, the fact that it did not receive any bids at that reasonable price might tell you something (unless it is just a reflection of today's economy).\n\nIP: Logged\n\nahwt\n\nPosts: 2334\n\nRegistered: Mar 2003\n\nposted 06-10-2008 12:06 AM\n\nAbove is the mark from Belden for Sayre and Richards which I think is the same as your first mark. I think the ovals are different in height from the one on your mark your letters appear to me to be thicker in the middle portions.\n\nWould it be possible to see the grater?\n\nIP: Logged\n\nwev\n\nModerator\n\nPosts: 4121\n\nRegistered: Apr 99\n\nposted 06-10-2008 01:05 AM re the [auction] item, Francis Philip Nash was born in February of 1897; the other monogram is not readable enough to trace reliably, though the GBW is certainly not correct -- it is more likely GBFN.\n\nIP: Logged\n\nScott Martin\n\nForum Master\n\nPosts: 11520\n\nRegistered: Apr 93\n\nposted 06-10-2008 08:19 AM I was wondering if any of our silversmith members have seen this post? I don't know but something suggests that the porringer was made using techniques not really used until well after 1813.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nIP: Logged\n\nagleopar\n\nPosts: 850\n\nRegistered: Jun 2004\n\nposted 06-10-2008 09:54 AM âUnder magnification, it seems that the bedding (back portion) of the mark consists of parallel vertical (cut??) lines rather than â??stamped??â[SEE image #1 & #3].

There also is a non-alignment of the features within the mark; is this due to a double stamping with the marking tool?[SEE all images, but seen best in Image #2].â\n\nThe back ground of the punch is the surface that the letters are cut into on the punch and usually it is polished flat but some times it is left with file marks that would give the parallel lines. It seems though that another possibility is that the area where the mark is was filed very roughly and it was marked over the file marks, which did not disappear but remained (in line with the file marks out side the punched area.\n\nThe halo could be evidence of a double strike like in image #2.\n\nI feel that from what I can tell from the images (and I canât tell that much) that there is nothing out of the ordinary with any of them. It seems that often the simple realities of physical work are confused by folks who have never seen it done. By that I mean that it is not rocket science but if one has not seen it it tends to be over analyzed.\n\nThe question of thick vs. thin letters is a great example â the same punch struck lightly or heavily and then the struck mark is hammered either lightly or heavily and then polished lightly or...and throw in 200 years of wear, you get 6 different looking marks (thin, fat, full, flat letters etc.). Throw in double strikes (very easy to do) and also maybe there is more than one punch in the workshop...\n\nYes fake punches can be made but is this so valuable that one would go to the time, trouble and expense? One last thing is that different levels of work were done at different times and a smith in NYC being paid top dollar might have more resources to have more punches and do better work than his provincial peers.\n\nIP: Logged\n\nScott Martin\n\nForum Master\n\nPosts: 11520\n\nRegistered: Apr 93\n\nposted 06-10-2008 10:27 AM agleopar,\n\nThanks for a silversmith's view about the mark. What about the porringer itself -- post 1813 work?\n\nAs to why go to the trouble of making up such a die? There is a lot of unmarked coin silver around but if the unmarked silver were struck with such an early mark then the silver could become worth 10 to 100+ times more then an unmarked piece.\n\nIP: Logged\n\nFWG\n\nPosts: 845\n\nRegistered: Aug 2005\n\nposted 06-10-2008 11:16 AM As I've mentioned before, there was a table-full - literally - of faked Michael Shaver silver floating around in the Virginia - North Carolina - Kentucky area some years back. Apparently someone either found his punch or made a decent copy of it and marked everything they could find, from correct period spoons to spun holloware. I personally only saw a few such pieces, but had the account of a table-full from several reliable sources. So yes, I'd say once one has or has made a suitable punch it's likely to be used over and over.\n\nShould've added, I'm not asserting there's anything wrong with these pieces, just pointing out a case in which there was....\n\n[This message has been edited by FWG (edited 06-10-2008).]\n\nIP: Logged\n\nPaul Lemieux\n\nPosts: 1792\n\nRegistered: Apr 2000\n\nposted 06-10-2008 02:31 PM jim klopfer, will you please post a picture of your nutmeg grater?

Because the porringer is so extremely in good condition I have my doubt about his age. The key hole handle and the bowl of the porringer gives to me a reaction that it isn't a totally silver object, but a silvered or re-silvered porringer.\n\nI good be wrong but that's my opinion.\n\nIt was a interesting reaction Agleopar my compliment and FWG also thanks for reaction good to know all the facts.\n\nI shouldn't buy this one thinking about is it a real one?\n\nIP: Logged\n\nsilverhunter\n\nPosts: 704\n\nRegistered: Jul 2007\n\nposted 06-11-2008 03:00 AM I just forgot to show a pattern which was made around 1900 in Holland, only for to give a indication about another pattern, perhaps the pattern also changed into the U.S.A seeing the showed pattern in the topic.\n\nIP: Logged\n\nbascall\n\nPosts: 1629\n\nRegistered: Nov 99\n\nposted 06-11-2008 06:09 AM The father of a Francis Phillip Nash that was born in February 1897 in New York was born in Austria, so he seems an unlikely fit.

R. Ward. This one has the mark of Ebenezer Moulton and is in the form of a barrel. The construction would appear to me to test the skills of a silversmith, although I have never understood why the barrel shape was picked up by silversmiths as a form to copy. I suspect that the barrel represented something to folks in that era that is not apparent to me.\n\nThe âSilver in the Americansâ book is heavily discounted on the internet and is well worth buying. Perhaps the early discounting is a sign of the economy of today.\n\nThe nutmeg grater never gained the popularity in the U.S. that the porringer did, either during the time period that they were actually used or later during the reproduction stage.\n\nThe porringer makes a great ice cream bowl, but I feel that the ubiquitous reproduction of this form has taken away its mystery.\n\nOne question on porringers - were the handles cast?\n\nAlso thanks Jim for posting a picture of your lovely nutmeg grater.

While I am not an expert in Sayer and Richards or their markings, my sense is the markings on the porringer seem a bit 'off' compared to the known markings and so my initial reaction is to be chary as to its authenticity, especially when one thinks about the amount of profit one can obtain for a relatively minor cost of making a die of a well known maker and banging it on all kinds of older unmarked and less valuable things to dramatically increase their values. Doing this on genuinely old objects is far harder to spot than making a complete forgery from scratch. I do not know the seller and I do not suggest that he or she has any part in such an activity, but I also know that auctions on this site are unregulated, the vast majority of sellers simply copy material from reference sources as sales pitches rather than being true experts in the material they sell, and the auctions are very caveat emptor. There are many such forgeries in the market these days - not just in silver but in all kinds of antiques.\n\nIP: Logged\n\nsilverhunter\n\nPosts: 704\n\nRegistered: Jul 2007\n\nposted 06-11-2008 02:35 PM AHWT,\n\nI'm sorry I don't own this one, please let me continue dreaming about silver objects!\n\nIP: Logged\n\nbascall\n\nPosts: 1629\n\nRegistered: Nov 99\n\nposted 06-11-2008 05:41 PM Once again about Francis Phillip Nash, wev and I are off a generation and mismatched on birth states for Francis Phillip Nash's (the first) parents, Massachusetts vice New York.

Would that fit Sayre & Richards?

Although I kept no records of the makers, all were well known, established makers, and I had no reason to doubt their authenticity. Those that I remember were of the typical classical bulbous form, rather than the less common straight-sided form of the one in question here. Most of the later porringers made more recently (except for reproductions) have a flat bottom, as opposed to the domed bottom of the older, hand-raised ones.\n\nIP: Logged"
