        "text": "Sr. Video Editor - Producer\n\nStephanie was educated at San Francisco State University, where she received her Bachelor of Arts degree in Fiction Filmmaking. During her four years at San Francisco State University, she was an active member of the Professional Gender Inclusive Cinematic Arts Fraternity, Delta Kappa Alpha. There she collaborated with her fellow members on various films and projects.\n\nCommunity Manager - Writer\n\nGrowing up NOT in civilization in the mountains of West Virginia, Michelle found adventure in books, movies and games. She was raised very untraditionally on Star Trek: The Original Series, and Monty Python’s Flying Circus. She found the Harry Potter books to be her one true obsession, and discovered gaming with her family would be some of the best memories she could hope for. Now living in Texas, she is still trying to find her passion in her career, but her hobbies remain the same.\n\nSenior Editor - Writer\n\nBrandy grew up in a small suburb outside Houston, Texas, in a time when MTV still had music videos and before video game consoles in homes were a thing. She may be the only one in her town that owned a ColecoVision instead of an Atari. She also has a knack for finding the humor in everything even in situations where maybe she shouldn’t.\n\nEditor - Writer - Creator\n\nYou may recognize Dan from The Replayer Podcast, which he Co-created and Co-hosts. Dan is a deadpan gamer and nerd obsessing over every video game he can get in his hands. For some reason, Dan lives and breathes Godzilla and other silly (men in monster suits) movies. It is believed that Dan is actually dead inside as he never seems to have any emotional or lively reaction to anything. Some say his resting bitch face is a permanent condition due to desensitization from having played too many survival horror games as a child.\n\nActor, Producer, VO Wizard\n\nAn acclaimed American actor and voice actor recently honored with BAFTA award for outstanding contribution to performance in games.
