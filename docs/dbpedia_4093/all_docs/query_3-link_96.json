        "text": "Why did you start your video production company WILD?\n\nWILD is the antidote to the expensive agency and the unreliable, low-cost freelancer. I noticed that for clients seeking good quality video content, there seemed to be such a gulf between one end of the spectrum and the other. I wanted to fill a gap in the market by starting a company that could deliver high production value in a more efficient and streamlined way.\n\nI was a freelance editor and cinematographer for 7 years, working alongside inspiring directors and creatives. I felt it was time to take everything I’d learned (and my network of incredible photographers, filmmakers, strategists) to show clients that they can make engaging content more effectively. We pride ourselves on being able to respond to our clients needs, from nimble crews to 50 person productions.\n\nWhen did you start the company?\n\nI and Jordan Richards started WILD in December 2019. We had just worked on our first project in January/Feb 2020 when COVID-19 hit. All production across the UK shut down. It was scary and demoralising. We considered writing off the whole year, but with every cloud, there is a silver lining, and one of our biggest (newest) clients came out of the pandemic and their need to communicate to their audience.\n\nDescribe how you felt developing a business during that time?\n\nStrange. So much of the type of work that defined me had been branded content shoots abroad, telling stories in remote places like Iceland and Peru. The business has had to adapt to filming locally in the UK and embracing more user-generated content. We made a series of internal films for Google combining mobile phone footage and animation. This showed us that there is an honesty and authenticity with intimate phone footage that we might have ignored, always trying to seek the perfect image.\n\nHow did the nature of the business of filmmaking change during that time?\n\nI think one of the biggest challenges for me has been maintaining the psychological resilience to pursue (and grow) a business during a tough year when a lot of businesses are closing down, and clients are less inclined to spend lots of money on marketing. As a business we’ve had to become more flexible in our approach and offering as well as finding opportunities in a rapidly changing world.\n\nWhat changed a lot for me was finding myself more office-based than ever. I’ve always been quite active and regularly on shoots, so I missed meeting and collaborating with new people on a daily basis. However, more time at my desk gave me the necessary time to develop the systems and processes for the business and build a small but experienced team at WILD. An important priority that might otherwise have taken longer with shoots and enduring schedules underway.\n\nI think clients have realised that they can get the same results with less people. Often you don’t need 20–30 people on set and can achieve more with 6–8 people. Smaller crews can work faster to capture the moment and contributors often feel more comfortable in front of the camera.\n\nWhat were the benefits of facing those challenges?\n\nIt has given me the confidence and self-belief that as a team we have the fortitude to get through tough situations by being adaptable and hard working. Seeing Jordan (business partner and CEO of our sister company RCCO) plowing on through the pandemic, unflustered by the strains on his business, made me realise that if you keep putting in the hard work, taking action, and shifting to a mindset of possibility, you will find success in all sorts of surprising places. Facing these challenges has taught me that it is important to have positive, driven people around you to show you the possibilities through example.\n\nCan you give me an example of how you kept your creative spirits up during these challenging times?\n\nMy director friend Malcolm and I knocked heads together and decided to make a film called ‘Love is Immune’. It is a video dedicated to the brides and grooms whose weddings had been cancelled that year. Malcolm wrote the words, my fiance recorded the voiceover and I edited together the footage which was sourced UGC content from the internet. The film gained over 2 Million views on social media and spread positive cheer to so many. What is interesting is that there was no brief for this video, it was simply born out of a difficult situation. We tried our best to continue to be creative, setting our own briefs and inspiring each other to make an impact on audiences. The film has since helped us to pitch for and win more social campaigns and stories.\n\nWhat’s next for WILD?\n\nStarting a business in a pandemic was the most ambitious thing I’ve ever done. Who knows when it will all truly end, but as the UK starts to open up, getting out on shoots and collaborating with talented people has given us a renewed momentum. I’m excited to continue to overdeliver for all our clients every step of the way which means anticipating their needs and continuing to come up with original ideas and responses.\n\nIn addition, we are developing our independent work, such as a self-funded documentary based in Namibia. We’re in a fortunate position now to be growing the team which means bringing together like-minded people and creating a culture of inclusion and creativity.\n\nWe’re currently hiring for a mid-weight editor, if you think you have the skills or just want to grab a coffee, don’t hesitate to reach out."
