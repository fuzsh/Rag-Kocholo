        "text": "I am obsessed with the comfy, cozy, iconic murder mystery television series Murder, She Wrote, starring Dame Angela Lansbury (may she rest in peace).\n\nI fell in love with it while watching it with my mom growing up, and as an adult, I have seen the full series several times over. It's that perfect rainy-day binge.\n\nAs you know, the character Jessica Fletcher (played by Lansbury) is a teacher-turned-mystery novelist and sleuth who solves some 60 murders in her (fictional) hometown of Cabot Cove, Maine, according to the CBR website.\n\nHere's the latest surrounding the charming Maine fishing village as the set of a new theatrical film version with big behind-the-scenes names attached.\n\nAccording to Town and Country magazine, the classic show is in the works at Universal. Writers Lauren Schuker Blum and Rebecca Angelo, known for Orange is the New Black and Dumb Money, confirmed they've even finished the script.\n\nSo when can we expect it?\n\nREAD ON: Watch the 'Friends Reunited' Trailer Called 'The One With Chandler's Funeral'\n\nAccording to , Lauren and Rebecca excitedly signed on for the movie before that writers strike last year, so the project is now behind schedule by nearly a year.\n\nMeanwhile, who will play Jessica Fletcher, since Angela Lansbury passed away in October of 2022 at aged 96? Or will there be a new character? Maybe a relative of Jessica's will solve a murder or two.\n\nAccording to the Screen Rant website, the producer is Academy Award-winning Amy Pascal. Pascal Pictures is known for the 2016 Ghostbusters reboot, Spider-Man: Homecoming, Molly's Game, The Post, and Little Women.\n\nOther than that, we haven't heard any new updates about this film adaptation."
