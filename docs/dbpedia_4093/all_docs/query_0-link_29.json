        "text": "“ Come back here, you slut! It's time to get your medicine, you fucking whore! „ ~ Thomas Richards to Andrea while trying to kill her\n\nThomas Richards is a minor antagonist in the comic series The Walking Dead, serving as the main antagonist of \"Volume 3: Safety Behind Bars\" and also a mentioned villain in Telltale's The Walking Dead: Season One. He is a convict imprisoned in the Meriwether Country Correctional Facility who claimed to be inside for tax evasion, but in reality is actually secretly a serial killer.\n\nWhat Makes Him Hated?[]\n\nHe was first mentioned to be in prison for tax evasion, however, he was really there for murdering his own wife.\n\nOn his way to prison, he pathetically claims to the officer taking him there that he did not commit the above crime, even though the police caught him in the act.\n\nHe is a vicious misogynist who deliberately chooses to target women and children.\n\nDecapitates Hershel's twin daughters with a knife.\n\nAttempts to decapitate Andrea but only manages to scar her earlobe and cheek.\n\nHypocritically berates Andrea for using a swear word, only to scream a misogynistic slur while trying to kill her.\n\nWhen Patricia attempts to free her under the belief that he is insane and not evil, he immediately tries to kill her, calling her a \"whore\".\n\nWhile the zombies can't really be hated due to acting on instinct, he shows full awareness of his actions and proves that other humans can be even more dangerous than the zombies.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThomas was originally planned to stab a pregnant Lori Grimes in the stomach, along with the baby, but it was scrapped due to being too dark for the comics. Had the scene been kept in, he would have become even more hated.\n\n[]\n\nThomas Richards on the Villains Wiki\n\nThomas Richards on the Walking Dead Wiki\n\nThomas Richards on the Villainous Benchmark Wiki"
