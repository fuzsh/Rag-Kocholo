        "text": "1In London, from May to October 1851, countless shoppers and strollers walked the aisles of the Crystal Palace, specially designed and built to house the Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations, to admire the displays of commodities which had been mostly produced in Great Britain and its colonies—representing more than half of the exhibited consumer goods. The Crystal Palace was an architectural feat, an awe-inspiring structure of glass and iron ; as for the Great Exhibition, it quickly became a defining moment for the British nation in the nineteenth century, between the battle of Waterloo in 1851 and the Diamond Jubilee in 1897, as Jeffrey A. Auerbach outlined in The Great Exhibition of 1851 : A Nation on Display (1999). None of the goods in the glass structure were for sale, but visitors could admire them at will—the showcased goods were mostly middle-class commodities such as cutlery, furniture, and clothing, as well as industrial inventions and machinery meant to show how Great Britain advanced towards its future.\n\n5The contributors to this issue discuss this fundamental myth of the consumer society, whose contours and occurrences in the contemporary world they seek to map. The aim of this set of articles is to examine the links that are made between visual culture and consumer culture and between images and consumer goods, and outline how these links illuminate the society of the spectacle in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, which were marked by the increased use of various media—from the cinema to the television and the internet. This special issue raises the following questions : How have the imagery and imaginary of our consumption practices evolved over time ? What kinds of displays and representational systems prevail in our consumer society ? How does this society reflect on itself through visual culture ? What are the national and transnational stakes of such mises-en-scène, particularly in the English-speaking world ? How did the transformation of mass media beget new codes, power relations and consuming habits ? How do industries and companies appropriate the tools of visual culture to promote and display their products ?\n\n7This volume seeks to interrogate the links between consumption, nationhood, and spectacle, extending Lussault’s analysis to other modes of representation, geographical locations, and media. Karine Chambefort-Kay studies Martin Parr’s perception of British national tastes and consumer psyche in Signs of the Times : a Portrait of the Nation’s Tastes (1995). Chambefort-Kay explains that the photographer’s work operates both as an explanation of the motivations to buy certain items but also as a strong criticism of over-consumption. Martine Lambert-Charbonnier focuses on the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London, which was created by filmmaker Danny Boyle. Lambert-Charbonnier argues that the show conformed to the Olympic ethos and presented evolving images of British cultural and technological contributions. Lambert-Charbonnier demonstrates that Boyle used symbols which promoted British values, which were then spread across cultural borders as part of British nation-building. Emilie Cheyroux surveys the consuming habits of Latinos and their desire to be part of US consumer culture with a close analysis of two major documentaries, Shopping to Belong (Irene Sosa, 2007) and ¿Tacos o Tacos ? (Robert Lemon, 2011). She addresses the issues of assimilation and hybridization, arguing that Latinos contribute to the economy and the culture of the United States, which allows them to integrate American society while reinforcing their original cultural identity.\n\n9The contributors to this volume examine the ways in which such visual displays of consumption either install, accommodate, or criticize dominant ideologies, especially in gender terms. Thibaut Clément’s analysis of the Disney theme parks explores the celebration of consumption in the parks and the development of commercial partnerships with companies whose products are promoted there. Clément argues that the presence of brand names could impact the design and operation of the parks and attractions. Over the years, US corporations have become part of the landscape of Disney parks and consumption is consubstantial with the entertainment experience. Eléonore Obis’s article discusses the way wine labels help target specific customers and participate in creating an identity for Californian wines. They reveal the expectations of the customers regarding a certain sense of tradition and terroir but also new tastes, as labels introduce elements from popular culture which can appeal to consumers. Obis contends that Californian wine labels today promote a return to nature, so as to emphasize the authenticity and quality of wines. Alice Morin explores perfume editorials in high-end fashion magazines of the 1970s, and shows that perfumes were used, as displays, to negotiate the tensions of the troubled 1970s and particularly women’s emancipation. Morin shows that perfumes thus opposed traditional mechanisms of commodification in that decade. Anne Lesme’s work on American Dolls offers an observation of material culture in the US. The production and circulation of these dolls by Mattel questions the construction of a certain sense of history and vision of girlhood. To conclude this volume, Stéphanie Mercier’s article explores the commodification of women in the plays of Shakespeare, the issue of prostitution and the representation of the brothel as a central place of commercial exchanges, new identity boundaries and power struggles in the early modern city. Mercier’s article powerfully echoes Lussault’s contemporary preoccupations with “hyper-places” in today’s globalized world—showing how the Shakespearean stage worked as one of the first mass media tools involved in the myth of consumerism—and perhaps as a first example of a “hyper-place” well before the advent of globalization."
