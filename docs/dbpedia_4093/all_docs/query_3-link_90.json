The resulting documentary, interspersed with footage of Hog Caller's nightmarish realities, contaminated music videos, pig/human hybrid births, and toxic lyrics, candidly follows a reporter, a cast of locals and this elusive band towards crisis, confusion, and several more questions than answers - in one of the most disturbing documents ever committed to film.",

        "text": "I know I recently declared the coolest thing you can do with a camera to be making a psychodrama in an empty mansion with your friends but abusing a bunch of pig carcasses with your friends for a visual album for your grindcore band that hasn’t released a new track in 18 years (including 5 or 6 before this came out) is up there too. Feels like Trigger Happy TV and Wonder Showzen, a relic from an era where you weren’t making weird shit because weird was trending, but because it was funny to your IRL small group of friends. Full of choices like using a guy in a shitty costume beard instead of your friend with the massive real…\n\nWhen you advertise yourself as a grindcore band (and have someone explicitly state that) in the opening monologue and then open with a piece that tops out at about 72bpm, I'm gonna question your understanding of the term grindcore. That said, I really dug the Saint Vitus* influence in that first track.\n\n[side note: until I started watching this I had no idea Hog Caller were an actual band. I mean, tell me that's not a great nickname for a serial killer.]\n\nThings do definitely get more grindy as we go along (though the stoner-rock does rear its head some as well). The videos are about what you'd expect. I don't have a problem with that at all--if you've got…\n\nThe temptation to get more Letterboxd likes has me wanting to call this \"the best movie to ever come out of Middletown, PA haw haw\" and be done with it. That said, there's something strangely cozy about this weird (but perhaps not weird enough) experiment, which integrates footage of central-PA institutions like Three Mile Island (there's a whole \"subplot\" about irradiated weed), Saturday's Market, and even the State Capitol as a local reporter attempts to track down Satanic stoner grindcore band Hog Caller (led by The Dirtfarmer and Vomitrocious). The visual aesthetic is akin to Jim VanBebber directing a Necrophagia music video, but the artistry is even cruder and the \"plot\" weighed down by a couple repetitive scenes (Vomitrocious feeds…"
