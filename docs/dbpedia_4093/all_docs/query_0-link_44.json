        "text": "It has long been thought that this Thomas Richards is the first husband of actress Glenda Farrell and the father of Thomas \"Tommy\" Farrell, a character actor referred to as \"the last of the cowboy sidekicks.\"\n\nThat is incorrect. Thanks to a FindAGrave volunteer, Charles Johnston (#48850826) who helped set the record straight. Johnston provided us with a marriage record that showed Glenda Farrell married a different Thomas Richards. That man's name was Thomas John Richards.\n\nThat Thomas John Richards is the father of film actor Thomas \"Tommy\" Farrell who was born in 1921 (Thomas took his mother's maiden name a few years after his parents' divorce in 1929).\n\nFurther research showed that Thomas John Richards later married Gwendolyn Bayley in Culver City, CA where both were dancers. The couple moved to Philadelphia. Thomas John Richards died in 1939. Here is his FindAGrave memorial.\n\nI have asked FindAGrave (the managers of the Glenda and Thomas Farrell memorials) to remove the links to Glenda and Thomas Farrell.\n\nThe Thomas Albert Richards of this memorial is the son of Thomas Albert Richards and Elizabeth [Foulkes] Richards. He immigrated to the US with his mother and three siblings in 1905, when he was six years old. His father had immigrated two months earlier.\n\nHis father was a below ground miner in England and a laborer in the US.\n\nThe family initially lived in Jasper, Missouri. They moved to San Francisco before 1920. Thomas' parents separated around that time.\n\nThomas Albert Richards went on to work as a film editor for Warner Bros. He worked on more than 30 films including The Maltese Falcon (1941), Each Dawn I Die (1939), Dangerous (1935) and The Seventh Cross (1944).\n\nThomas Albert Richards was a Pacific Coast lightweight champion boxer. He fought in 84 bouts. Thomas was quoted in \"The Boxing Filmography.\" When asked how well Jimmy Cagney boxed in the film \"Winner Takes All,\" Richards said that Cagney \"can box with the best of them. He's the best actor-boxer I have seen in ten years.\"\n\nThomas Albert Richards married Frances Harns Williams February 14, 1935.\n\nFrances and Thomas had twins: Mary Elizabeth Richards and Jacob Leonard Richards, b. August 12, 1935 in Los Angeles. Jacob died six weeks later. Cause: \"Twin, immaturity.\"\n\nThey had a third child, a girl, who was still born on November 26, 1936.\n\nBy April 1930 Frances and Thomas were divorced. Frances was living in Los Angeles with her daughter, Mary Elizabeth Richards, and her widowed mother, Mary M Sweet.\n\nThomas Albert Richards died in 1946 of a heart attack (other sources say appendicitis). His sister, Elizabeth Jane [Richards] Barrett, is interred with Thomas in his crypt. Thomas's parents are interred in the same mausoleum.\n\nIt has long been thought that this Thomas Richards is the first husband of actress Glenda Farrell and the father of Thomas \"Tommy\" Farrell, a character actor referred to as \"the last of the cowboy sidekicks.\"\n\nThat is incorrect.
