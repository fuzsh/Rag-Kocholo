        "text": "December 6, 2009\n\nAlthough this book is cast as a Love-Inspired Suspense, I would categorize it as a Love-Inspired Thriller!\n\nThe danger is so intense, partly because Levon Rivers’ murder happened during broad daylight in open farmland next to a cornfield and partly because April Presley witnessed the murder first hand. Her hand-covered screams caught the killer’s attention, and as he chased her through the cornfield, a neighboring lady, Aunt Suke, came and rescued her.\n\nDuring all the subsequent questionings by Sheriff Ray Taylor and others, she only remembers a blur of the person; it happened so fast, and she was concentrating on escaping the killer.\n\nDaniel Rivers, a deputy sheriff, wants to know who killed his father, and he believes April remembers more than she’s saying, but only needs some extra prodding to bring out the memory.\n\nThe killer is stalking April surreptitiously, and they need to find the truth before the killer finds her. Even Daniel gets shot in the midst of all the chaos; a bullet that was meant for April. Daniel is the only one she trusts to keep her safe. Would their faith uphold them in the midst of such evil?\n\nThis was one book I could not put down til I found out who did it and why. It’s powerfully written with many plots and twists to keep you guessing and gripping your seat until the end! I grew up on a farm and always felt safe out in the field–until now!\n\nI want to thank Ramona for a free copy of her book for review. I review books for the sole purpose of encouraging people to read good fiction.\n\nJanuary 25, 2010\n\nMy sister lent me this book, and I only took it because of how short it was. I thought it was an OK book, not fantastic or anything... sure there are some parts that had twists to them, however, those twists are the only thing that kept me going. Without that, I would have gave her book back the next day! The characters were rather bland...\n\nA little bit more romance in it wouldn't have hurt, but hence \"inspired\", it's from a religious-related book publishing (Steeple Hill), so I am assuming there might be some rules on how much romance you can write?\n\nOh, well... it passed the time.\n\nOctober 6, 2017\n\nThis quick read had a good mix of suspense and romance. Set in the small community of Caralinda, Tennessee our main character, April Presley witnessed a murder in the middle of a corn field.\n\nFebruary 24, 2022\n\nI could not get into this book at all.\n\nMay 18, 2023\n\nGood read.\n\nLiked the complete book. With all the arguments and hurtful words I am surprised they would marry. suspense and mystery.\n\nJuly 21, 2010\n\nField of Danger\n\nRamona Richards\n\nLove Inspired Suspense\n\nSteeple Hill\n\n2009\n\nISBN-13:978-0-373-44366-6\n\nReviewed by Cindy Loven\n\nApril Presley loves the small town of Caralinda Tennessee. Moving there after a particularly nasty and bitter divorce, she loves the fact that the people of the town truly care for each other. Imagine her horror as one morning when she takes lemonade out to her friend Levon Rivers in the cornfield, she sees someone shoot him point blank with a shotgun. In that instant April's life takes on a horrific nightmarish realm. The murderer is now after her, determined to kill her, as the only witness to his crime.\n\nDaniel Rivers, Levon's son is crushed that his father has been murdered. Who would want to kill his father? He is beloved in the small town of Caralinda. As a police officer on the force, his chief keeps trying to make him stay off the case, insisting he is too close to the victim. He just can't leave it alone though, this is his father who was murdered, and April is a friend he feels he needs to protect.\n\nThey both realize quickly that the murderer must be a local, April did not see the face of the killer. Daniel is convinced that she can remember more, and as she tries it just comes to her in small details, bits and pieces. Will she remember enough to discover who killed Levon Rivers? Will this murder draw two people who loved Levon together? Will romance bloom in the face of death?\n\nI enjoyed this novel very much. It was easy to read, the writing style flowed very well. April and Daniel's faith in God shone throughout the story, and it was very easy to recognize that their faith and their church were very important to each of them. I would recommend this book to my friends. A wonderful suspense filled story. Discussion questions at the end of the book for book clubs. 212 pages $5.50 US 4 stars.\n\nThis book was provided by Suspense Zone for review purposes only. No payment was received for this review.\n\nMay 23, 2010\n\nI love Love Inspired Suspense books and Ramona Richards has penned one that I especially loved because of the Tennessee setting.\n\nApril Presley witnesses the murder of her beloved neighbor,Levon Rivers. The murderer not only sees her, too, but pursues her until she reaches safety at the plantation home of Aunt Suke Stockard. While deputy sheriff, Daniel Rivers, is the victim's son and has been told by his supervisor to stay out of the investigation of his father's death, he finds himself drawn to the beautiful April and wants her to remember what she saw that day in the field.\n\nRacing against a murderer who now also wants April dead, and trying to keep her safe while probing her memory, tension reigns high.\n\nDecember 13, 2015\n\nThe Presley sisters\n\nBook 1\n\nIn this first book of the three Presley sisters, we meet April as she's running away from the murderer who just killed her best friend. Her friend's son is devastated when he arrives at the scene and learns his father is dead. Immediately, the two are thrown into a mystery full of violence as someone desperately tries to kill April to shut her up for good!\n\nThe suspense was GREAT! There are a few surprises along the way. The author did great keeping me guessing. The romance was sweet as well. I really loved Daniel! I really liked Ray as well, and am happy to see he gets his own story!\n\nNovember 7, 2010\n\nThis is about a divorced women that moves to a small farm town in Tennessee to start over. She befriends her neighbor that is like a father to her. She witnesses his murder. His son is a sheriff in town. It is his job to protect her while also doing his own digging to find out who is responsible for his father's death. Though it was a quick read, i found it interesting. Weren't many characters to choose as the who dun it, but still wasn't the ending i was expecting. and in that case (for me) well done.\n\nMay 9, 2011\n\nAs April Presley goes on her regular mission to bring Levon Rivers some lemonade as he works in his field, she comes upon him being shot. She runs from the murderer and is led to Aunt Suke's house, an elderly neighbor lady.\n\nDaniel Rivers is sure that April can remember more then she thinks so he sticks with her to find out who murdered his dad. He has wanted to date April since he first met her but she turned him down when he first asked, she was fresh out of bad divorce and needed time.\n\nThe murderer is determined to get to April and they are sure it is someone from the area.\n\nJune 19, 2010\n\nThis was a very enjoyable book. The author did a great job writing characters that you could relate with and care about. She also did a good job at keeping me guessing \"whodunit.\" Looking for the ACFW discussion that starts on Monday!\n\nJanuary 19, 2016\n\nHave you guessing 'til the end!"
