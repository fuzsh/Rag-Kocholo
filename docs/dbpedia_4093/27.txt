Our aim is to document your wedding in a laid-back and natural manner, capturing memories of your family and friends to treasure for years to come. As a photographer, I am committed to capturing the most important moments throughout your wedding in a relaxed and friendly way. Bringing you and the mood and style of your wedding into focus.

After your wedding you will receive all images professionally edited and ready for you to share and print as you wish.

I have been passionate about photography my whole life. After graduating from De Montfort University in 2008 with a BA Hons in photography & video, I explored the world as a travel photographer and developed my own unique approach as a lifestyle photographer.

On returning to the UK in 2012 I helped establish 'Stepping Stone Studios,' an art collective aiming to support and connect local artists and small businesses in Kent. From here I started Thomas Richards Photography, specialising in family portraits, weddings and events. I have since developed a commercial arm to my business, working with clients both in the UK and around the world. Including; G-Forces, Informa, Merkle, TickleBerries, Chelsea Flower Show, London 2012 Olympics, Chevrolet, Imago, as well as various musicians, actors, small businesses and countless weddings and events.

We focus on capturing your special day with a natural and creative photojournalism style. In order to tell your story and capture the unique mood and style of your wedding. Our approach is relaxed, friendly and sensitive to the needs of such an important day.

​

Since getting married in August 2013 I fully understand what a special day this is, from all the details and touches you have painstakingly planned to the precious moments with friends and family.

We work with you to develop a unique approach to your wedding. And all our packages offer pre-wedding or engagement photo-shoots. A great way for us to meet, and get you relaxed in front of the camera ready for the big day.​
