Biography[]

Thomas Richards from the Roxxon Corporation performed in a mock execution. In one of his lessons, the Mandarin threatened to kill Richards if the United States President Matthew Ellis failed to call him within thirty seconds. Although the President complied with the request, the Mandarin ignored the call and, in a mock execution, pretended to shoot Richards in the head, leading the President and all other viewers to believe Richards had been executed.[1]

Following the broadcast, Richards and Slattery shook hands, and parted ways.[2]
