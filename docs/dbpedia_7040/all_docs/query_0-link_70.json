        "text": "PROLOGUE\n\nThe Only War We Had\n\nThe American air war over Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia spanned twenty-five years, and included a wide variety of pilots, planes, missions, and bases. By the war’s end in 1975, more than half of the money America spent on it had gone to Air Force, Army, and Navy air operations. The United States dropped over eight million tons of bombs on the Southeast Asian countryside, and lost over 8,500 aircraft, both fixed-wing and helicopters. For all this investment, air power, though occasionally influential, did not enable America to win the war.\n\nAlthough much has been written about the tactics and strategies of the air war, few books examine the individuals who fought it. Fast Movers will attempt to fill this void by revealing the hidden, personal side of the air war as seen by its primary combatants: the fast movers, the men who flew jet fighters and attack aircraft. The product of nearly three hundred interviews and extensive documentary research, Fast Movers explores the lives and wartime experiences of some of the most famous men of the air war, pilots such as Colonel Robin Olds and Captain Steve Ritchie, as well as a host of unknown but equally intriguing aviators.\n\nThe United States Air Force dates its involvement in Vietnam to the summer of 1950, when it sent advisors to help France maintain and operate U.S.-manufactured aircraft in the war with the Viet Minh. After the Viet Minh victory and the partition of the country into North and South Vietnam in 1954, America continued sending air advisors to South Vietnam. By the end of 1961, six South Vietnamese squadrons were ready for combat, supported by an American combat-training detachment known as Farm Gate. By the end of 1962, more than 3,000 Air Force advisors were serving in Vietnam. American pilots not only flew close air support and reconnaissance missions but also transported South Vietnamese troops around the country and defoliated jungle areas with C-123 Ranch Hand aircraft. During the latter program, which lasted over ten years, the Air Force sprayed 19.22 million gallons of herbicides and defoliants over nearly six million acres of South Vietnamese jungle and farmland.\n\nThe alleged August 1964 attacks on two American destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin ushered in a new phase of the air war in Southeast Asia. Then-president Lyndon Johnson called these incidents open aggression on the high seas and received broad authorization from Congress to widen the war in Vietnam, beginning with retaliatory naval air strikes against naval facilities and oil storage facilities in North Vietnam. Near the end of 1964, Johnson initiated Operation Barrel Roll, a series of interdiction missions flown along the Communist supply routes developing in the Laotian panhandle. After the Viet Cong attacked the U.S. air base at Pleiku in February 1965, Johnson retaliated with raids against targets just north of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). Initially known as Flaming Dart, these reprisal missions evolved into a sustained air campaign, beginning in March 1965.\n\nOperation Rolling Thunder was the longest air campaign in American military history. Between 2 March 1965 and 31 October 1968, Navy, Air Force, and Marine aviation flew one million sorties and dropped one-half million tons of bombs on North Vietnam. Rolling Thunder had several objectives. One was to persuade Hanoi to abandon its support of the South’s insurgency; another was to raise the morale of the military and political elites in South Vietnam; and a third was interdiction—strikes against logistics targets such as bridges, roads, and railroads, designed to reduce Hanoi’s ability to support the war in the South.\n\nThe majority of Rolling Thunder missions were carried out by U.S. Air Force tactical fighters based in Thailand and U.S. Navy fighter and attack squadrons based on carriers in the Gulf of Tonkin (called Yankee Station). Pilots and air crew members of these units suffered a disproportionately high share of the armed services’ combat losses. Of the 532 prisoners of war (POWs) returned by North Vietnam in 1973, 501 were aviators downed over the North, most of them during Rolling Thunder.\n\nThe campaign was marked by a basic dispute between senior American military leaders, who argued for a brief, intense campaign to isolate North Vietnam from external supply sources and destroy its production and transportation systems, and President Johnson and his defense secretary, Robert McNamara, who chose to alternate escalation with bombing halts in the hope of compelling the North Vietnamese to negotiate. During the three years of the campaign, Johnson and McNamara ordered a total of seven such pauses. They also insisted on unprecedented civilian tactical control, dictating the numbers and types of aircraft, kinds of ordnance, and even the flight paths to be flown. Targets were chosen by Johnson, McNamara, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, and presidential assistant for national security affairs McGeorge Bundy (and his successor Walt Rostow) during Tuesday lunch meetings.\n\nRolling Thunder strikes were initially limited to southern North Vietnam, just north of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The bomb line, a line just below the city of Vinh, formed the northern boundary of the strike zone, beyond which attacks were forbidden. As the campaign dragged on, the bomb line moved progressively further north, reaching to thirty miles south and west of Hanoi by September 1965, and by July 1966 encompassing all of North Vietnam except the prohibited areas of Hanoi and Haiphong, as well as a buffer zone along North Vietnam’s border with the People’s Republic of China.\n\nBy November of 1965, this system of bomb lines and zones was formalized into six interdiction areas called Route Packages, or Packs. Most American aircraft losses occurred in Pack 6, the area near Hanoi and Haiphong. Status within the pilot corps became defined by the number of missions one had flown in that zone. Eighth Tactical Wing Commander Robin Olds, for example, boasted of having flown 58 Pack 6 missions—more than were flown by any other Air Force wing commander in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe North Vietnamese used the prohibited areas in and around Hanoi and Haiphong as sanctuaries in which to base surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and Soviet-manufactured MiG fighters. During Rolling Thunder, 919 U.S. aircraft fell victim to SAMs, MiGs, and anti-aircraft guns of various caliber. The North, employing an air-denial strategy, used high-altitude SAMs to compel American aircraft to fly low, thereby bringing them within range of their anti-aircraft guns. MiGs were used very sparingly; usually, they made just one pass at a strike package before retreating home.\n\nThroughout the campaign, American pilots clamored to go downtown (i.e., bomb military targets in Hanoi), but President Johnson, his advisors, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff turned down these requests. The Johnson Administration believed that the threat of more intensive destruction implicit in limited, incremental bombing would have a greater impact on Hanoi’s willingness to negotiate than would an all-out terror offensive. They also believed that this gradualist approach would forestall possible Chinese intervention.\n\nRolling Thunder’s climax came between August and October 1967 when Johnson, bowing to military pressure, ordered attacks on critical petroleum storage, electrical power generation, and transportation targets in Hanoi and Haiphong. Despite the success of these attacks, Rolling Thunder failed to accomplish its major objectives. The bombing caused an estimated $600 million worth of damage in North Vietnam and killed over 52,000 North Vietnamese civilians,¹ but it did not prevent the Communist forces from launching the Tet offensive early in 1968, nor did it bring North Vietnam’s leaders to the negotiating table. It also cost the United States 919 aircraft and over $2 billion. Frustrated by the failure of air power to bring about a peace settlement, President Johnson scaled back the Rolling Thunder campaign after the Tet offensive, and eventually halted all offensive air operations against North Vietnam on 31 October 1968.²\n\nBetween the fall of 1968 and President Richard Nixon’s resumption of offensive air operations against North Vietnam during the spring of 1972, air-strategy planners shifted the focus of the bombing campaign from North Vietnam to the supply traffic moving down the loose network of trails in Laos known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail. This logistics network eventually became the major target of the post-Rolling Thunder Air Force interdiction strategy known as Commando Hunt. What made Commando Hunt different from earlier efforts was its extensive use of aerial dropped sensors. Commando Hunt covered large stretches of the Ho Chi Minh Trail with acoustical and seismic sensors, with the greatest concentrations being located at the strategic passes into Vietnam: the Nape, Mu Gia, Ban Karai, and Ban Raving passes. The system, code-named Igloo White, consisted of three principal elements: sensors sowed by aircraft along the infiltration routes; the airborne relay aircraft that received and transmitted the signals; and the all-important nerve center of the system, the infiltration surveillance system at Nakhon Phanom, code-named Task Force Alpha. Analysts at Task Force Alpha analyzed sensor data as well as human intelligence from Special Forces teams operating in Laos under the code name Prairie Fire. This voluminous data, in turn, was fed into an IBM mainframe to produce daily interdiction-bombing orders. Each squadron received a fragment of that order, called a frag. When the system functioned smoothly, the resulting intelligence became part of a targeting process that moved rapidly from an assessment officer manning a scope to another officer who directed the airborne command post and called in strikes on specific targets.\n\nThe centerpiece weapon of Commando Hunt was the AC-130 Specter Gunship. Sporting 20-mm Gatling guns and 40-mm Bofors cannons and equipped with low-light television, laser range-finders, and infrared detection systems to seek out hot spots associated with truck systems, the AC-130 boosted the statistical success of Commando Hunt operations. In 1968, for example, the Air Force claimed 7,332 trucks destroyed or damaged, compared to 3,291 the previous year. Another significant weapon in Commando Hunt was the B-52 heavy bomber. B-52 Arc Light strikes cratered road systems and caused landslides in the strategic mountain-pass areas on the border between Laos and Vietnam. Other aircraft (A-1s, F-4s, F-100s, C-130s) laid millions of small gravel mines along roads to hamper the efforts of North Vietnamese repair crews and to disable their vehicles.\n\nFor all its technological wizardry, Commando Hunt had little impact upon the Communists’ ability to wage war. Every year of the campaign American forces, either alone or with their South Vietnamese allies, had to take drastic action on the ground to prevent them from launching a major offensive. The campaign in the A Shau Valley in 1969 by the U.S. Marines, the Cambodian incursions in the spring of 1970, and the South Vietnamese invasion of Laos in February and March of 1971 all demonstrate that Commando Hunt was not as successful as official Air Force figures led many to believe. But the most serious challenge to the effort was the massive North Vietnamese invasion of South Vietnam in the spring of 1972.\n\nLinebacker I was President Richard Nixon’s response to this invasion, known as the Easter offensive. Linebacker’s goals were much clearer than those of Rolling Thunder: to halt the invasion of South Vietnam and force North Vietnam to resume peace negotiations. Consequently, unlike during Rolling Thunder, commanders were given wide latitude to achieve those goals. American air power was employed with full intensity from the outset; U.S. military commanders exercised full control of tactics and targeting within broad White House guidelines; laser-guided bombs (LGBs) were available in quantity; and categories of targets previously off limits were attacked.\n\nDuring Linebacker I, tactical fighters from Thailand attacked transportation, power-generation, and petroleum targets. In particular, the new laser-guided bomb technology proved highly effective against bridges. By mid-October, with war materiél depleted, the North’s transportation net in shambles, and the People’s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) forces withdrawing, North Vietnam communicated its willingness to negotiate and Linebacker I was terminated.\n\nLinebacker II, the subsequent Christmas bombings, was Nixon’s iron-willed response to the diplomatic unwillingness of the North Vietnamese to come to a peace agreement acceptable to U.S. negotiators. For the first time in the war, B-52s attacked targets near Hanoi.³ During the first three nights of the campaign, the bombers attacked in three plane formations at evenly spaced intervals using the same altitudes and ground tracks for their approaches. On the first night of the campaign, three B-52s were lost, and on the third night a staggering six planes went down in a 9-hour period. The loss of these aircraft produced discontent among crews stationed in Thailand and Guam, and Strategic Air Command planners in Omaha, Nebraska. For the next four nights the campaign was run at a reduced level while tactics were changed. The strikes on 26 December 1972 decided the entire air war over North Vietnam: 220 air force and navy aircraft hit a variety of targets all within a fifteen minute window. Only two B-52s went down that day, but the North Vietnamese air defense system was shattered. Their largest missile-assembly facility was destroyed, their ground-based radar early warning and intercept system (GCI) was degraded, and their MiG bases were rendered temporarily unusable. North Vietnam was virtually defenseless against further B-52 attacks, and Hanoi quickly proposed a resumption of peace talks in Paris on 8 January 1973. Although the air attacks continued for the next three days and 4 more B-52s went down before the bombing north of the 20th parallel stopped on 29 December, the air battle was essentially won on 26 December. If U.S. losses had proved unacceptable on the 26th, Nixon would have been compelled to cancel the attacks and no negotiated settlement on acceptable terms would have been achieved in Paris.\n\nThe general outlines and major difference of the two major strategic air campaigns of the Vietnam War, Rolling Thunder and Linebacker, are well known; less well understood is the fact that beneath the differences between the campaigns lay a common, un-Vietnam-like, fast-mover culture—a success-oriented culture based on airmanship and membership in an elite group. Far from despising the Vietnam war, most fast movers viewed it as the high point of their careers. The war challenged and affirmed their skills, but more importantly, it united them with a group of like-minded men who shared a common success ethic.\n\nRolling Thunder was the longest air campaign and the greatest failure of air power in the war. It is this campaign that most aviators think of when they discuss the futility of American air power in Vietnam. During the Gulf war 24 years later, Colonel John Warden, then the Air Force’s chief strategist, constantly reminded coalition commander General H. Norman Schwarzkopf during briefings that This is not your Rolling Thunder. This is real war, and one of the things we want to emphasize right from the beginning is that this is not Vietnam! This is doing it right. This is using airpower!⁴\n\nThe men who flew during Rolling Thunder risked their lives in this futile campaign not because they believed in the cause but because they took pride in their service, their units, and their unique fast-mover culture. By stressing the importance and status of this culture, a World War II veteran named Robin Olds managed to take a unit that had been thoroughly discouraged by the poor management of its previous commander and turn it into one of the Air Force’s top MiG-killing outfits. His story, therefore, opens this book.\n\nFrom there the narrative turns to a very different example, which nonetheless also demonstrates the success of the fast-mover Gemeinschaft or collective culture. Ed Rasimus, a relatively unknown but earnest pilot, joined the Air Force because he loved the idea of flying. He never thought he would end up in Vietnam, however, and when he learned of his assignment to Southeast Asia he became almost paralyzed with dread. What is intriguing about Rasimus’s story is that at any point in the process he could have extricated himself from combat status. Unlike members of the other combat arms, pilots are permitted to remove themselves from flight duty and combat at any time and often, after having done so, continue to serve in the military in ground jobs. As one naval aviator aptly put it, An airman enjoys a luxury which the infantryman never knows. It’s the easiest thing in the world to get grounded temporarily or removed from flight status entirely. And it needn’t be anything so dramatic as marching into the CO’s office and dropping your wings on the desk. All it took was the merest hint that flying had lost some of its appeal, a casual remark at the O Club, or a couple of aborted flights, and you were out.\n\nLike Robin Olds, Ed Rasimus got through the experience of war bolstered by the stimulation of combat and a respect and love for the men with whom he flew. In particular, acceptance within the unit proved to be of paramount importance to Rasimus. To be accepted, a pilot did not have to believe in the war or support the Johnson or Nixon Administrations in a political sense. He did need to be patriotic and love the U.S. military. Even more important, he had to be willing to make his squadron and its well-being his number one priority in life. Careerism and self-interest were the ultimate taboos of this group; the supreme honor was to die for a squadron-mate, or better yet for some poor grunt on the ground. This is what Vietnam-era pilots mean when they refer to themselves as professionals. Professional in their lexicon had nothing to do with their officer status, degrees, or pilot’s rating; it had everything to do with their willingness to expose themselves to extreme danger and adversity, even death, to ensure the survival of their comrades and brothers in arms.\n\nTo illustrate that this fast-mover culture extended across campaigns and even across services, this narrative next turns to a group of Marine aviators. The collective culture of the Marines who flew off the aircraft carrier USS Coral Sea in 1972 was not markedly different from that of the Air Force units who flew similar missions out of Thailand and South Vietnam. Like their Air Force compatriots, the Marines took tremendous pride in their group—especially after the charismatic naval officer Roger Sheets took command of the Coral Sea’s air wing in the middle of its cruise. Different campaigns, a different service branch; yet, again, a charismatic leader made a big difference and inspired a fierce culture of success.\n\nNo single event during the war reveals the collective, cross-service nature of the fast-mover Gemeinschaft more vividly than the history of the Fourth Allied POW Wing. When taken prisoner the airmen generally conducted themselves with dignity and heroism. Though often perceived by other arms of the service as spoiled individualists who would fall apart when removed from the creature comforts of their bases and aircraft carriers, these pilots and navigators were as committed to the basic military tenets of organization, leadership, discipline, and unit cohesiveness as any other group of military professionals.\n\nAs the POW experience demonstrates, there was a paradoxical quality to the air war that makes its social history very difficult to characterize in general terms. Vietnam War pilots often behaved outrageously in base officers’ Clubs but then demonstrated iron discipline while incarcerated or when flying missions. Some of America’s best pilots were also notorious drinkers and womanizers. Leadership at the highest levels tended to be inadequate, but wing and squadron leaders often proved to be some of the finest air leaders America has ever sent to war. Pilots hated the war but loved flying individual missions.\n\nNo missions were more satisfying to pilots than those they flew against MiGs. MiG engagements allowed a pilot to pit his skill against another aviator just like himself. Admittedly, many kills were straightforward missile shots from the rear quarter, which required very little maneuvering. Nonetheless, some MiG engagements demanded every ounce of a pilot’s stick and rudder skills. It also took a profound desire to hunt and kill. Not surprisingly, the war became personal for the MiG killers. Theirs was not simply a tour of duty but a quest for personal excellence. For some, this quest could lead to burnout or—worse—death or a bailout. But for the lucky few (like Steve Ritchie from North Carolina, discussed in chapter 6), a quest for personal excellence turned a small-town boy into a world-renowned ace.\n\nBut it was the camaraderie more than the killing that kept pilots going. The search-and-rescue missions (SARs) form perhaps the most powerful example of the strength of this bond. As pilot and historian Darrel D. Whitcomb aptly put it, in a war without end or purpose, there was one mission with which every aircrew member could identify: the rescue of one’s own.⁵ SAR became a metaphor for the entire air war. The Linebacker II campaign, for example, in the end became nothing but a large-scale SAR effort to secure the release of American POWs in Hanoi—hence its great popularity with airmen. More than any previous American air war, Vietnam became a war fought for the airmen’s buddies. The ultimate irony of the air war in Vietnam was that for all the bitterness and hatred they expressed for the overall war and for campaigns such as Rolling Thunder, these men also loved the war. They loved certain missions and certain unit commanders, but most of all they loved the men they fought beside.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nOLD LIONHEART\n\nRobin Olds and the Eighth Tactical Fighter Wing, 1966–1967\n\nUbon, Thailand, October 1966\n\nFor the men of the Eighth Tactical Fighter Wing at Ubon, the summer of 1966 was a season of bitterness. Mired in the fruitless bombing campaign known as Rolling Thunder, the Eighth Wing pined to strike the North Vietnamese airfields, factories, and command-and-control facilities in Hanoi, but neither the political leadership in Washington nor the local Air Force commanders in Saigon and Ubon would hear of it.\n\nTo President Lyndon Johnson and his key advisors, the bombing of North Vietnam was primarily a political tool, its purpose being to convince the North Vietnamese to give up their support of the insurgency in the South. One accomplished this aim, reasoned Johnson, by attacking the North’s supply routes to the South, not by waging total war against its urban and industrial areas. But for the U.S. military pilots this strategy proved exasperating. Rolling Thunder’s limited portfolio of targets meant that the North Vietnamese military could easily predict where U.S. planes would attack and could concentrate their defenses accordingly, leaving other areas undefended.¹\n\nIf that were not enough, the Eighth Wing’s lackluster commander, Colonel Joe Wilson, compelled his pilots to fly standard routes and times, and to carry standard bombloads. Anxious to please his superiors in Saigon and Washington, Wilson believed that such standardization would result in a higher sortie rate for the Eighth Wing. Higher sortie rates, in turn, would allow Air Force Secretary Harold Brown to petition Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara for more money for the Air Force. This program to increase sortie rates, called Rapid Roger, ran from August 1966 through February 1967, and greatly undermined morale at the Eighth Wing.\n\nIt was shitty, it wasn’t the way to efficiently win a war, recalled slick-wing Captain John Stone about Rapid Roger. (Junior pilots in the Air Force call themselves slick wings because their wing insignias didn’t have a star above them like those of senior and command pilots.) The predictability of the missions annoyed Stone the most: There were no tactics, everyone went the same route, the same time of day, the enemy knew we were coming. Another junior captain, Ralph Wetterhahn, complained that to achieve a rate of 1.25 sorties per aircraft per day Rapid Roger compelled the men of the Eighth to fly night missions—dangerous missions usually flown by specialized night squadrons. Moreover daytime sleeping, in un-air-conditioned quarters with no blackout curtains, meant that in the hot, humid, mosquito-ridden conditions of Thailand pilots simply could not get enough sleep.\n\nThe extra night sorties also strained the aircraft maintenance system to its breaking point.² Airman First Class Robert Clinton, a member of an Eighth Wing load crew, remembered maintenance teams working around the clock and breaking every safety rule in the book to keep up with the demands of Rapid Roger. We would unload live bombs right on the taxi-way and just roll them to the side rather than sending the planes to the ordnance-disarming area.³\n\nColonel Joe Wilson cared little for his maintenance crews and their problems. An administrator more comfortable in a starched tropical khaki uniform than in a flight suit, Wilson could not think very far beyond his career. When Wetterhahn lost four feet off his right engine tailpipe from flak, he got his ass chewed out by Wilson.⁴ This from a commander who flew so rarely that his subordinate pilots even began to question whether he was flight qualified. How dare someone who never flew chastise a pilot for getting shot at in wartime? Did he not understand that junior birdmen like Wetterhahn and Stone were leading flights against some 4,400 guns, 150 surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites, and over 70 MiG fighter aircraft, with no guidance from above and with tactics designed not to save lives and put bombs on target, but to please civilian bureaucrats in the Pentagon and the White House? According to the pilots, Wilson did not; instead, he just sat in his office and raised hell when planes got shot down.⁵\n\nThere was a lot of hell to be dispensed. In July 1966 North Vietnamese defenses claimed 43 American aircraft, the highest monthly total since the start of Rolling Thunder in March 1965. During the first ten months of 1966 the MiGs alone forced 77 fighter-bombers to jettison their heavy bombs and flee before reaching their targets. More significantly, they shot down nine U.S. aircraft. American pilots, by comparison, only downed 24 MiGs during this period—a favorable kill ratio of 2.6 to 1, but one far lower than the 7 to 1 ratio achieved by the U.S. Air Force in Korea.⁶\n\nClearly something drastic needed to be done, and in late summer 1966, the Seventh Air Force Commander in Saigon, General William Spike Momyer, himself a former fighter pilot, began thinking about replacing Wilson with someone who would lead from the cockpit. Warrior colonels, however, were almost an extinct species in the USAF tactical-fighter community by the summer of 1996. Indeed, 40 percent of the pilots in the Air Force were over forty years old late in that year, and most of these men did not have good enough stamina or reflexes to perform well in a high-performance tactical fighter like the F-4.⁷ Many older fighter pilots instead could be found performing crew duties in bombers and transports. Others worked in limited resource specialties such as development, engineering, and procurement, and could not be replaced.⁸ Still others were leaving the Air Force to take lucrative jobs with civilian airlines; in the mid-1960s, the U.S. Air Force was losing over 1,400 pilots a year to the rapidly expanding commercial-aviation sector.⁹\n\nThere was, however, one iconoclastic colonel left at Shaw Air Force Base in South Carolina who had no aspirations to be an airline pilot, or even a general officer. This pilot embodied the best and the worst qualities of America’s jet-pilot elite. On the one hand, he could inspire young men to kill by leading from the front—a rare skill that can never be overvalued, in a profession dedicated to violence and the force of arms—but he also drank too much, spoke his mind at every opportunity, loved using abusive language, occasionally interpreted orders loosely, and often failed to show appropriate deference towards his superiors. The man, in short, was a loose cannon, and General Momyer knew it. He didn’t care. The Eighth Wing needed to be jump-started—and Colonel Robin Olds, with his cockpit style of leadership, might just do the trick.\n\nRobin Olds’ story stands out as one of the most interesting examples of true flight-suit leadership in modern air-power history. In 1967 the Eighth Wing did not possess a more talented group of pilots than any other F-4 wing in Vietnam. The 366th Wing, based at Da Nang in South Vietnam, for example, had just as many skilled pilots, but this unit only achieved 18 aerial victories during the war compared to the Eighth Wing’s 38.5. What transformed the Eighth from an ordinary line outfit into the premier MiG-killing wing of the period was Robin Olds’ leadership and the sheer force of his personality.\n\nOlds’ tremendous success as a combat leader stemmed from three elements in his personality: his loyalty to his men, his desire to share danger with his men, and his willingness to socialize and interact casually with his troops. Olds never asked someone else to do something that he wouldn’t do himself. He also did his utmost to shield his men from policies and orders that he deemed nonsensical or downright dangerous. This last characteristic made him a controversial figure with his superiors and hurt his career in the long run. His tendency to fraternize with his men also hurt his reputation. The old pilot adage, Live by the throttle, die by the bottle, certainly applied to Robin Olds. His love for drink bordered on alcoholism. However, given the Zeitgeist of the Vietnam War, where most U.S. servicemen didn’t quite understand why they were there or what they were fighting for, seeing their charismatic leader shooting down MiGs in the air and later drinking with them at the bar helped created an esprit de corps difficult for non-combatants to understand. As one aviator put it:\n\nWe weren’t fighting to defend our country, no one was threatening our country. We weren’t fighting to defend the South Vietnamese. On the contrary, we were disgusted by the pictures and stories of those long-haired, Honda-riding, drug-dealing, draft-dodging, duck-legged little bastards living their corrupt lives in Saigon, actually buying their way out of the draft, while our guys were being sent over to die for them. For what actual purpose we were over there, I don’t know even today, 26 years later.¹⁰\n\nOlds, in short, made his men want to fight for him and the unit rather than for the unpopular cause of the war. For his men, he transformed the war from a vague cause to a personal crusade.\n\nA Tradition of Arms: Robin Olds’s Childhood and Early Career\n\nShortly after Robin Olds retired from the Air Force in 1977, he was invited to give a speech at Davis-Monthan AFB in Arizona to a mixed audience of fighter pilots and Strategic Air Command (SAC) personnel. He began his speech by saying, \"My name is Robin Olds and I want to identify myself to everybody in this room: Peace is not my profession!¹¹ The SAC members of the audience turned red in the face. In front of them stood one of the most decorated officers from the Vietnam War making fun of their beloved motto, Peace is our profession.\" Who was this warmonger, this Prussian, this relic? The answers to these questions lie in Olds’ unique background.\n\nBorn in Hawaii in 1922, Robin Olds grew up steeped in the culture of American airpower. The first sounds I remembered, he recalled, were the cough of Liberty engines warming up at dawn and the slap of the ropes in the night wind against the flagpole on the parade ground.¹² During his childhood, he crossed paths with a veritable Who’s Who of American aviation. His father, Major General Robert Olds, was General Billy Mitchell’s aide during Mitchell’s court-martial in 1925.¹³ General Tooey Spaatz [commander of the Eighth Air Force in World War II], then a major, remembered Robin, lived nearby, and I used to chase his daughters to the front door and out the back. Robin’s greatest childhood memory, his ultimate thrill, was meeting Captain Eddie Rickenbacker, the World War I ace and Medal of Honor recipient who could lay claim to 26 confirmed aerial victories.¹⁴\n\nRobin Olds, in short, grew up surrounded by a small but very famous group of pilots. To these men, and ultimately to Robin, the air service was not a paycheck, a stepping stone to the airlines, an opportunity to attend schools and gain training, or a bureaucracy dedicated to expanding its empire. Rather, it was a small priesthood of warriors dedicated to fighting and winning America’s wars. The 1,200 officers in the U.S. Army Air Corps in the early 1930s served their country with almost no potential for promotion and at half pay because of the Depression. Throughout his life, Olds would take great umbrage at officers of any rank who did not possess this level of dedication to the service.\n\nAfter high school in 1939, Robin Olds attempted to join the Royal Canadian Air Force to fight in World War II.\n\nHow old are you son? The recruiter asked him.\n\nNineteen, Sir!\n\nWe need your parents’ permission to recruit you.¹⁵\n\nRobin then went home and petitioned his father to sign his recruitment papers. General Olds hit the roof. For him, there was only one acceptable route to military service—the United States Military Academy at West Point. West Point would guarantee Robin a regular commission, and with it accelerated promotions for the rest of his career.\n\nRobin Olds entered West Point during a unique period in that institution’s history. Due to the wartime emergency, cadets who started classes in 1940 would graduate a year early. Furthermore, those destined for the Army Air Corps would earn both their wings and their gold lieutenant’s bars in a mere three years. Robin did his basic and advanced flight training at Stewart Field, just 17 miles north of the academy, played football, and passed all his academic courses. It was a tough schedule but we didn’t care, he explained. All we wanted was a piece of the action before the war ended.\n\nOlds has mixed memories about West Point. He enjoyed flying, his classmates, and playing football as an All-American offensive right tackle in 1942, but he despised the school’s tactical officers (the men who taught nonacademic military courses such as drill and marksmanship). The place was full of nonentity tac officers and other people who thought they were great because they were assigned to West Point. They weren’t.¹⁶ Olds wanted to be a fighter pilot; he learned very early in his career to judge people not on their intelligence, rank, or status but for their competence and valor in a combat situation. The staff at West Point disappointed him in this regard—very few had ever heard a shot fired in anger.\n\nAnother aspect of the place that left a bitter taste in Olds’ mouth was its strong emphasis on alumni networking. When asked if he ever engaged in ring knocking (the practice of showing your class ring to gain special treatment from commanders), Olds recoiled. \"Bullshit, no! That might be"
