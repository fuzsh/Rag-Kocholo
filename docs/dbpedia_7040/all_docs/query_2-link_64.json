Naval History and Heritage Command has assembled collections of imagery, artifacts, art, and numerous other resources that commemorate the academy's often-colorful history. The Naval Academy has weathered the storms, rocks, and shoals of the United States' evolution as a nation and society, and has graduated scores of dedicated sea services officers who have made their marks in U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps annalsâ€”and in the history of our nation."
