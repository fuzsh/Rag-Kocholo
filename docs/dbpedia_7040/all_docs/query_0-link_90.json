This 20 acre tract was called 'Sherwood's Island,' and was in Talbot county, on the north side of the Great Choptank river, in Broad creek; and on the same date another tract of 130 acres was laid out for him and called 'Crooked Intent.'--Annapolis Land Office, Vol. XXI, p. 173.\n\nHugh Sherwood deposes in 1707, aged 75 years,--Annapolis, Md., Chancery Court Records, Vol. P.

He himself has told us under oath when he was born, which was in 1632; and while we do not and may never know the place of his nativity, we have it that he died at his home in Huntington, Md., in 1710, at the age of 78. We know that he with two others, supposedly his brothers (Edward and Francis), after having been 'transported' into Maryland, were in Talbot county in 1661; where, from the records in the Land Office at Annapolis (Vol. VII, p. 370), we conclude that they were reimbursed for their traveling expenses, by gifts of lands from the State. We know, too, that he was a member of the House of Delegates, and a member of the Lower House of Assembly, and that he once signed himself 'a true Englishman, a good subject of the Crown of England--our native land.' Which is rather significant, we think, as indicating the country from which he had come.\" It should be noted that Talbot County was not formed until 1662.

Hambleton, Hugh Sherwood, Rich. Feddeman. Bk. 13. pg. 142.\n\nIt appears from the original will that John Brooke died in March of 1692 (1693 N. S.). At that time his wife, Judith, was apparently pregnant since she made a will the following July naming an unborn child. Unfortunately, both she and the child appear to have died the following fall. Subsequently, John's original will seems to have been modified to reflect these events and recorded again, but the estate was not settled until 1710. Within this context, John Brooke identified grandchildren having surnames \"Cooke\" and \"Ennalls\". Concomitantly, Judith Brooke named Ann Cooke and Mary Ennalls as daughters-in-law. In seventeenth century usage this would be equivalent to step-daughters and strongly suggests that Judith was the second wife of John Brooke and, probably considerably younger. Moreover, John Brooke appears to have had no sons as direct heirs. In any case, it is clear that his daughter, Mary, was not the wife of Hugh Sherwood. Nevertheless, the context strongly suggests the existence of some family relationship between Hugh and Mary Sherwood and John and Judith Brooke. Indeed, Judith named Hugh Sherwood, Sr., as executor and made bequests to his daughters Catherine and Margaret, as well as Mrs. Mary Sherwood, who was probably Hugh's wife (which, if so, would indicate that they had an additional daughter, Mary, who apparently did not survive to adulthood.) Taken together, the most likely possibilities would be that Judith Brooke was a sister or, perhaps, a niece of Mary Sherwood or, perhaps, John Brooke's first wife was Hugh Sherwood's sister. Of course, other relationships are possible, even likely. In passing, it should be noted that Judith Brooke identified Barbara Throp as her sister, apparently unmarried, which if so would, perhaps, imply that Judith's maiden name was Throp.
