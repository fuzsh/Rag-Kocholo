        "text": "Craig D. Campbell Lake Conway Reservoir\n\nFor the most up-to-date lake level, visit the U.S. Geological Survey’s Lake Conway water level site.\n\nNOTE: Lake Conway recently experienced a fish kill due to low oxygen levels. Most fish affected were non-game fish (such as drum, shad and yellow bass), but some game fish also died. Fish kills like this are likely to happen throughout a lake renovation when water levels are low and temperatures are high. Daily limits are still lifted, and harvest of catches is highly encouraged. The AGFC thanks anglers for their support and patience. For more Lake Conway renovation project updates, see https://agfc.attn.tv/aQNV63-BKBEL\n\n(updated 8-1-2024) Bates Field and Stream (501-470-1846) said minnows are the bait now. “We’ve been selling the fire out of minnows. That’s what they’ve been catching the crappie on.” Crappie and catfish are still being caught in decent numbers. Water level is like a yo-yo at the lake with rainfall making it rise noticeably, then it falls out with a few days of no rain.\n\nLake Conway has no creel or length limits while the lake is in its drawdown phase as part of the AGFC’s renovation project. All fish may be kept; in fact, it’s encouraged, hence the no limit regulation. Still chances to stock up on crappie and others for the freezer.\n\nAlso, the Lake Conway nursery pond is open for fishing with the AGFC stocking various sport fish there. The pond is more than 60 acres and has bass, crappie and bream.\n\nLittle Red River\n\nFor the Army Corps of Engineers’ real-time outflow report from Greers Ferry Dam, visit the Corps’ Little Rock office website or by calling (501) 362-5150). Also check the Southwestern Power Administration website to see forecast generation schedule.\n\n(updated 8-1-2024) Mike Winkler of Little Red River Fly Fishing Trips (501-507-3688) said Thursday that the generation schedule has been pretty consistent lately, with the Southwestern Power Administration projecting water releases starting around 1 p.m. They’ve been running two units for about 7-10 hours each day.\n\nFishing has been good, especially if you get out there early in the morning before the temperature starts to rise. During these early hours, the water has a nice flow and is dropping from the previous day’s release.\n\nFish have been holding in the deeper sections with moss beds and around shoals with nearby deep water. For flies, you can’t go wrong with Pheasant Tail Nymphs, Hare’s Ear and Midges. These have been the hot flies lately.\n\n(updated 7-25-2024) Fish ’N Stuff (501-834-5733) in Sherwood said Thursday that the Little Red has been fishing better than it has been lately because they have been running water out of Greers Ferry Lake. Trout anglers are mostly catching them on chartreuse-colored Rooster Tails, Marabou Jigs and a small crankbait (like a No. 5 Shad Rap). More fish are being caught on the top and bottom end of the shoals than anywhere else. The fish tend to stay in those spots than on top where it’s warmer or the deeper parts where there isn’t as much current.\n\nAnglers also are catching trout on Carolina-rigged PowerBait in chartreuse or pink.\n\nGreers Ferry Lake For the Army Corps of Engineers’ real-time lake level and outflow report from Greers Ferry Dam, visit the Corps’ Little Rock office website.\n\n(updated 8-1-2024) Tommy Cauley of Fishfinder Guide Service (501-940-1318) said the water level at Greers Ferry Lake is at 462.24 feet msl, 0.3 feet below normal pool of 462.54 for this time of year. It was 460.80 on Tuesday, and that’s 1.74 feet below normal pool, so with runoff from rains looks like it will come up some more going forward.\n\nNot much else has changed other than more fish coming up on top schooling in different parts of the lake and rivers. Power generation has picked up with the Southwestern Power Administration generating 4 or 5 hours in the afternoon, which will help oxygenation in the lake and the Little Red River below as well. Also it will help with the bite for all species of game fish as are eating off and on at opportune times. Now most species are getting and staying out where they will summer, staying on structure where you can work on them.\n\nTry super shallow and out to 30 feet for crappie and use jigs, minnows or crankbaits. Many fish are migrating to cooler areas in timber where a lot of bait will spend the summer, so fishing straight up and down is a must when fishing for these. Walleye are eating in the main lake, with a few still left up in rivers and scattered throughout the lake. Drag crawler or crankbait in 28-50 feet of water. Some walleye are following under big schools of whites and hybrids; use a spoon for those, and just like crappie it’s time for a lot of them to head to the timber and hang out the rest of summer into fall as water is cooler and more bait fish are there as well. A spoon is best for that vertical fishing required now, targeting 10-50 feet.\n\nNext week I will detail the history of our walleye fishery that was taught to me by Carl Perrin, a past biologist for 30 years here. He was first and foremost in the way our walleye fishery was managed, the reason we have two different-acting species in the lake now, and the reason we have a bigger population of walleye in the south end of the lake. Stay tuned.\n\nHybrid bass and white bass are trying to get set up in main lake for the summer, and some are roaming and schooling on top. But ones that are set, use spoons, inline spinners, grubs and swim baits in 25-60 feet of water. The usual stuff is working in the lakes and rivers for catfish as more show up. Some bream are shallow but most still around 8-30 feet; crickets and crawlers are working fine as well as inline spinners. Some solo black bass are but most are out or roaming shallow and schooling; use Carolina rigs, topwater lures, wake baits, drop-shots, crankbaits and spinnerbaits for best action shallow out to 60 feet. Be safe and wear your life jacket.\n\n(updated 8-1-2024) Fish ’N Stuff (501-834-5733) in Sherwood said the walleye fishing has been good. The fish are concentrating around standing timber at around 25-30 feet of water. Anglers have been catching walleye using bottom bouncer rigs with a nightcrawler on the back, or throwing a nightcrawler on a jighead. The bass fishing, though, has been hit or miss. Early mornings and late evenings are best for the bass anglers because of the pleasure boating throughout the day on the lake. Successful anglers are targeting schooling fish, throwing clear Zara Spooks, small swimbaits and the like.\n\nWater clarity is clear and the lake level is normal.\n\nHarris Brake Lake\n\n(updated 7-25-2024) Harris Brake Lake Resort (501-889-2745) said people have caught a lot of catfish lately. Trotlines are being baited with minnows and some cut bait, and that’s paying off for a few regulars around the lake. One regular caught 10 one day and six the next, including a few flatheads that were around 15 pounds.\n\nBream are doing “pretty good,” they say. People are catching a lot of bream off the bank on redworms and crickets, and the full moon this past weekend helped. An angler also reported catching some crappie in the deeper area of the lake; he suggested 10 feet or more depth and fishing with minnows. The crappie he caught were in the 13- to 14-inch size.\n\nBass are slow with no reports coming in the past couple of weeks.\n\nThe water clarity on Thursday was muddy. The lake is at a normal level. Harris Brake received some rain earlier this week and more is expected in coming days, they say. So, expect to target bream or catfish.\n\nLake Overcup(updated 8-1-2024) John “Catfish” Banks at Overcup Landing off Arkansas Highway 9 said in his most recent report that bass are doing well on Cajun Spin and buzzbaits and plastic worms. Crappie are in the deeper water; nobody has been fishing for them lately. Catfish are doing well on trotlines and jugs using bass minnows and bream. Bream were doing well on crickets and redworms before all this water. One family came out and caught 130 in about 5 hours.\n\nBrewer Lake\n\n(update 7-18-2024) David Hall at Dad’s Bait Shop (501-289-2210), a 24/7 self-serve bait shop at the lake, said, “The lake is sitting at normal water level, and a lot of people are coming throughout the day. Anglers have been having the best luck for crappie and catfish around the dam area. Bass fishing has been reported to be at its best in the late afternoon or evenings. For crappie it seems that tri-color jigs are doing the trick for most anglers on the boats, with a white Rooster Tail working for bass.\n\nLake Maumelle\n\n(updated 7-25-2024) WestRock Landing in Roland (501-658-5598) said water has been consistently in the 85- to 87-degree range, not bad for mid-July. The largemouth bass continue to bite well. Anglers still report bass schooling in the mornings and evenings. They can be found shallow in the mornings and evenings at 2-4 feet, with others being found deeper, 12-20 feet. Try points and drop-offs, and use drop-shots, Texas-rigged worms, topwater baits, jigs and crankbaits. Spotted bass are good, too, making the black bass bite good in general. Reports have the Kentucky bass around points in 8-20 feet as well as relating to drop-offs. Use those drop-shots and crankbaits for spots, too. The black bass bite in the Tuesday night weekly tournament continues to be good for those anglers, with Cody Bryant and Brad Lequieu pulling in a 16.06-pound, five-bass stringer, edging Brad Edwards and Billy Wright, whose 15.94-pound stringer included the Big Bass of a whopping 7.26 pounds.\n\nCrappie was just fair this last week. Still hearing of crappie being found suspended around brush anywhere from 16-21 feet with decent size to them. Jigs and minnows are steadily getting their attention. Bream are good and there were reports before the full moon of them being in prespawn/spawn mode. Look for them around 6-10 feet of water as well as in shallow areas at 3-5 feet. Most of the anglers this last week were fishing in 16 feet of water and casting toward the shoreline. Anglers are using crickets, worms and drop-shots.\n\nCatfish finally made an appearance, or at least were reported by the angers. There has been fair fishing from the shoreline with bream, liver and worms. No reports on white bass, but you can always try a twister tail to get their attention.\n\nArkansas River at Morrilton\n\nFor the real-time water flow at the Ormond Lock and Dam and Morrilton stage level, visit the Corps’ Little Rock office website.\n\nLittle Maumelle River\n\n(update 7-25-2024) Ray Hudson at River Valley Marina (501-517-1250) said fishing has been pretty good this week. Water is clear and at a normal pool. The surface water temperature was about 78-79 degrees earlier this week, he says.\n\nThe black bass were “on fire,” he said, seeing it firsthand himself earlier this week. “Don’t know what the deal was, but they were biting. Bream, same thing. People are catching a lot of big bream. The people here at the marina are still catching catfish on hotdogs. Still not much on the crappie, it’s just here and there.”\n\nTopwater baits or soft plastic worms are suggest for bass. Bass are in 2-3 feet of water after the water cooled down from last week’s front. Crickets and redworms are both working for bream. With the full moon through the past weekend, the bream were biting in the middle of the day up shallow (2 feet of water or less).\n\nArkansas River (Maumelle Pool) For the real-time water flow at the Toad Suck Lock and Dam, visit the Corps’ Little Rock office website.\n\nArkansas River (Little Rock Area Pools)\n\nFor the real-time water flow at the Murray Lock and Dam and David D. Terry Lock and Dam, as well as the Little Rock pool stage level, visit the Corps’ Little Rock office website.\n\n(updated 7-25-2024) Fish ’N Stuff (501-834-5733) reports that the bass fishing has been tougher because of summer heat. You can catch some, they say, but the fish are mostly little ones.\n\nAnglers are having best success catching them on small crankbaits like Bandit 200 or Bandit 300 Series. Best colors are something in a shad pattern, and chartreuses have been doing well — such as a chartreuse blue back or chartreuse black back. Anglers are mostly targeting ends of jetties or sand drops on the main river. For fishing a bottom bait in those same areas, throw a Texas-rigged worm or shaky head worm.\n\nEarly or late, a bone-colored Zara Spook is a good bait to try at the ends of jetties. If you’re working around the grass, a small buzzbait has been doing really well.\n\nThey have heard nothing on crappie. Catfish are biting below the Murray Lock and Dam on nightcrawlers.\n\nThe water level is pretty level, the clarity is stained (definitely not muddy now).\n\nPeckerwood Lake\n\n(updated 7-18-2024) Donna Mulherin at Herman’s Landing (501-626-6899) said anglers say that “right now the hot species of the lake are the catfish and bream.” As for crappie, some are having success trolling and others are spider-rigging underwater structure for bites.\n\nCatfish are biting hot dogs and liver, and also some live bait such as shiners, shad and bream are great to use.\n\nEarly morning and evening topwater is working now for the black bass. Donna also said, “Right now it seems that the bass anglers are the ones that are rarely left empty-handed.”\n\nBream have seen an increase in overall activity, the full moon playing its part. Crickets and worms are the most popular bait for bream.\n\n“We’re level full and a little dingy, but not that bad. About normal for Peckerwood,” she said of the water conditions.\n\nWhite River(updated 8-1-2024) Cotter Trout Dock (870-435-6525) said mornings on the White River at Cotter are blissful – even when the afternoon forecast warns of record highs, we’re wearing light jackets for early morning departures. Often you’ll float through a pocket of cool air on the river that feels like a blast of air conditioning.\n\nBull Shoals Lake, at 660.7 feet msl, is below power pool and continues to drop as the Army Corps of Engineers keeps a steady release of water through the dam. Minimum flow (700 cfs) has been the norm lately, but we’re seeing big rises in the late afternoon through midnight, as high as 18,000 cfs. If you’re on the river later in the day, stay alert to increases in the flow. The river can sneak up on an angler and swamp you.\n\nThe browns keep surprising us with a steady bite even this late in the summer. Fresh crawdads and sculpins have received the most attention. We’ve had another egg pattern/shrimp success week. Garlic-scented PowerBait (add your own garlic powder or fresh minced) and a nugget of shrimp appeal to our local rainbow population.\n\n“Visitors say the peace they find on the river keeps them coming back for more. Add to that the possibility of catching a bunch of trout and you’ve got yourself a great day in the Arkansas Ozarks. Hope to see you soon.”\n\n(updated 8-1-2024) Dave McCulley, owner of Jenkins Fishing Service in Calico Rock, said that this last week they saw consistently high water between 8-9 feet Thursday through Saturday. Water started dropping Sunday with a high of 6 feet and low of 3 feet with low water again Monday. “Tuesday and Wednesday we saw highs over 7 feet with lows around 4 feet. With the many different water levels and clarity, fishing was tough at times with the best fishing Monday with the low and clear water. During higher and dingy water silver inline spinners with 2 Uncommon Baits ultra violet eggs worked best with corn or shrimp. With the low and clear water, quarter-ounce Thompson Colorado spoons in nickel/gold worked extremely well. We also saw success with other quarter-ounce spoons such as the Thompson Buoyant in gold or Little Cleo gold.\n\n“With the heat returning on Monday there was increased generation from Bull Shoals Dam resulting in high and dirty/dingy water in Calico Rock in the morning and dropping throughout the day. The river was fishable and it took some patience to catch a limit. Wednesday saw similar depths but cleaner water with good fishing.\n\nBull Shoals Lake\n\nFor the Army Corps of Engineers’ real-time outflow report from Bull Shoals Dam, visit the Corps’ Little Rock office website.\n\n(updated 8-1-2024) Fishing guide Del Colvin at Bull Shoals Lake (815-592-4302) said late Wednesday that the lake level is around 660 feet msl. Water temperature is still around 85 degrees, give or take, with warmer temp in the stained water. Bass are set up on summer areas and patterns, and the bite has been better during generation. The thermocline is set up in 30-32 feet. Shad are spread out from the back of the creeks out to the main lake. Check deeper water, points, ledges, drop-offs and channel swings and saddles that are close to deep water. The topwater bite has been random!\n\nThe bite will definitely slow down as the sun gets up. Use a Flutter spoon — that will keep the bite going. Once the sun gets high up, a lot the fish will move into piles and ledges. They can be stubborn. Try a drop-shot or Jewel Scuba or big worm. If you get one or two to bite, you might as well go to the next pile. These fish can be tougher to fire but a finesse approach will help. You can still catch them off points with small Jewel Peewee Jig in green pumpkin orange, PB&J or tube or a shaky head fished in 10-20 feet depth early, then 25-30 feet. Keep the boat out deep for long casts. There’s still a lot of activity around the 30-feet range.\n\n“Overall, the summer patterns are here! Dang, it’s been hot!”\n\nDel regularly posts new YouTube videos. Visit his YouTube site (Bull Shoals Lake Fishing Report) for more information and tips on fishing Bull Shoals Lake.\n\n(updated 8-1-2024) Southernwalleye Guide Service (501-365-1606) says fishing for walleye has been fair on the lower end of lake. They are pulling nightcrawler harnesses in 30-35 feet slowly, .8 to .9 mph, with 2-ounce bottom bouncers on the sides of primary and secondary points. Fishing with 1.5 Smile Butterfly Blades in gold or orange and chartreuse with orange bead patterns is working. Also, still just a No. 4 split shot and No. 2 Aberdeen hook and a nightcrawler, worked slowly around groups of fish or on deeper sides of brush piles, will catch some. Lots of fish in the 16- to 17-inch size are still being caught at this time.\n\nSpooning with a three-quarter-ounce white spoon in water off main lake points in 30-35 feet will also get some fish.\n\n(updated 8-1-2024) Crappie 101 Guide Service (870-577-2045) says crappie are starting to show up on a little deeper brush piles in that 25- to 30-feet range in the creeks. They are also still finding a lot in the 20-feet range scattered in the creek arms “and I have seen this all over the lake the last week, the quality is still pretty mixed up and the bluegill have also appeared since the lake dropped, so that can be a whole another challenge if they’re above the crappie. The jig bite has been OK but you will have to really be patient. I’ve been throwing a 1/32-ounce with a Tater Shad Jr. in a variety of colors and, of course, minnows. Quality seems to be deeper in the brush.”\n\nNorfork Lake\n\nFor the Army Corps of Engineers’ real-time outflow report from Norfork Dam, visit the Corps’ Little Rock office website.\n\n(updated 8-1-2024) Lou Gabric at Hummingbird Hideaway Resort (870-492-5113) said had no new reports, but he posts fishing reports nearly every day to his blog on the Hummingbird Hideaway Resort webpage.\n\nMillwood Lake For the Army Corps of Engineers’ real-time lake level and outflow report from Millwood Lake Dam, visit the Corps Little Rock office website.\n\n(updated 8-1-2024) Mike Siefert at Millwood Lake Guide Service said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Little Rock District continues its 2-foot drawdown conditions of Millwood Lake to improve shoreline vegetation and promote sediment compaction. The drawdown will expose an extensive area of shoreline for revegetation to allow the planting of millet, which promotes water quality, increases fish production and provides habitat for wintering waterfowl. The lake will be held near an elevation of 257.2 feet until Sept. 13 when it will be raised 6 inches. The lake will be raised to its normal conservation pool of 259.2 feet by Nov. 1. Boaters are encouraged to wear a life jacket and exercise caution during the drawdown as submerged stumps and shallow areas will be more prominent, especially in boat lanes. For more information, contact the Millwood Project Office at 870-898-3343.\n\nAlso, the AGFC recently stocked the remaining 120,000 pure-bred Florida bass fingerlings from the hatchery into Millwood Lake last week, Mike notes, bringing the total Florida bass fingerlings stocked this year to about 300,000.\n\nSurface temps are stable, ranging 86 degrees early to 91 degrees later in the day along Little River, depending on location and the time of day. Clarity along Little River remains buddy in many locations, but also continues to improve this week with decreased river current. Normal to moderate stain is found in most locations; some areas further up Little River are heaviest stain, with river clarity ranging 5-8 inches visibility depending on location. Clarity and visibility of the oxbows will vary widely from normal stained to good visibility from 20-30 inches.\n\nMike provided these specifics of the fishing this week on Millwood:\n\n* The best bite of the day for largemouth bass over the past few weeks continues to be from dawn to around 9 a.m. The mouths of creeks dumping into Little River, where the thermocline resides between 10-15 feet, are holding nice groups of largemouths. Bass for the past several weeks have been active early up to 2-4 pounds on topwaters, and cloud-cover mornings continue to see the best activity starting at dawn. Feeding activity levels have slowed with the increase of surface temperature in the mid- to low-90-degree range over the past couple weeks.\n\nBest baits drawing early morning reactions continue to be buzzbaits, soft plastic frogs, Cordell Crazy Shads, Baby Torpedoes and Chuggers fished near pads and vegetation. Buzzbait colors drawing the best reactions are black/blue, Hot Firecracker or Hot Cotton Candy. The best buzzbait bite working is along Little River depths and drops across points, and also flats near creek channel swings, with stumps and laydowns and around lily pads. Chuggers, Cordell Crazy Shads, Arbogast Jitterbugs and plastic frogs continue working in the slop — all are getting fair to good reactions in creek channels near stumps, cypress trees and near lily pads stands along Little River. Topwater activity levels drop off after 9-10 a.m. Then there is very little topwater activity until dusk.\n\nAfter the topwater action diminishes, a fairly decent and random bite can be had near creek dumps into Little River with a custom painted, shad pattern, shallow-running square-bill crankbait, 2.0 & 3.0 & S-cranks and Bill Lewis Echo 1.75s by deflecting and banging/deflecting them off stumps from 8-10 feet deep in creek channels and points. Bass around 14-15 inches in length are randomly responding to crankbaits in shad and bream colors. Best color of cranks in the oxbows for the past couple weeks or so have been the Bold Bluegill, Millwood Magic and Ghost. Increasing size up to a three-quarter-ounce Rat-L-Trap, fished much slower and deeper, will draw a few random hits during late mornings in creek channels and across points converging with Little River. Best colors of Traps over the past week or so have been Millwood Magic and White Smoke.\n\nThe drawdown is pulling a lot of fish to the mouths of creeks. Working crankbaits in a stop-and-go slow retrieve will draw a better reaction than fast retrieves. The drawdown will bring the majority of largemouths to creek mouths and points meeting up with Little River in short order.\n\nSeveral groups of juvenile schooling bass have been found in Horseshoe and McGuire oxbows up Little River over the past week around daybreak. Largemouths, spotted bass and white bass have been randomly schooling over the past week in various locations at dawn running river shad. Kastmaster and Cordell spoons, Rat-L-Traps and Little Georges all were catching the surface schoolers over the past week. These fish appear to be juvenile and adolescent in age distribution, ranging in size from 1-2.5 pounds each.\n\nSchools of spots and largemouths feeding on river shad in Little River behind points and washouts will hit vertical-jigged spoons with abandon once the topwater bite subsides late in the morning. We have been using Cotton Cordell Hammered Spoons over the past couple weeks with added bucktails. Some mornings a white bucktail is best, and it seems like on cloudy mornings that a red bucktail works better. You’ll find the most aggressive feeders between Jack’s Isle and Hurricane Creek along Little River, in 10-15 foot of depth where broken timber and stumps are. Hurricane Creek had some spoon-feeding bass early one morning last week, and surface-schooling Kentucky bass and white bass were around for several days where bends of creeks contained deeper water in the 10- to 15-feet depth range.\n\n* White bass continue hitting vertical-jigged half-ounce to 1-ounce slab spoons in Little River between Jack’s Isle and first entrance into Mud Lake, and also in Hurricane Creek from 10-15 feet deep. Little River has improved clarity, and the bite over the past couple weeks and the reduced current has clarity much improved on primary or secondary points. White bass are roaming back down Little River to their summer spots in the main lake, but pausing on these points in the process, and roaming in and out of creek dumps, too. With the drawdown in effect, many whites are found in close proximity to the Kentucky (spotted bass) and largemouth bass, all feeding on threadfin shad.\n\nHeavy three-quarter-ounce Cordell Hammered Spoons, Kastmaster chrome/blue spoons with white bucktails, or Bomber Fat Free Guppy or Fingerling crankbaits, and the Bill Lewis MR-6 Crankbaits in Citrus Shad, Tennessee Shad and Millwood Magic colors will draw reactions from white bass. Little George’s, Rocket Shads and red/white Rooster Tails continue to work.\n\n* Crappie continue to improve with water clarity improving in many locations. Locating planted brush piles in Pugh Slough, Horseshoe, Bee Lake, Millwood State Park or Saratoga continue to hold nice 12- to 15-inch crappie, and gave up some nice 2-pound slabs over the past few weeks. Minnows may work one day, jigs the next. Also try jigs tipped with a minnow, and fish these in planted brush piles at 10-16 feet of depth. Best colors for jigs over the past few weeks have been chartreuse/blue, chartreuse/black, Monkey Milk or Electric Chicken. Cordell smoke-colored grubs with a chartreuse tip tail on a light wire jighead will pick up a few extra bites.\n\n* We are getting good reports of large Mason bream and bluegills biting well at the Millwood State Park and at Jack’s Isle over the past week using redworms and crickets. These aggressive bream were biting from the bank and the floating dock from 4-8 feet of depth.\n\n* No report on catfish.\n\nLake Columbia\n\nNo reports.\n\nLake Erling\n\nNo reports.\n\nLake Greeson Tailwater\n\nFor the most updated Narrows Dam generation schedule from SWEPCO, click here.\n\nLake Greeson\n\nFor the most updated lake level at Lake Greeson, click here.\n\nNo reports.\n\nDeGray Lake\n\nFor the most updated lake level at DeGray Lake, click here.\n\nDe Queen Lake\n\nFor the Army Corps of Engineers’ real-time lake level and outflow report from De Queen Lake, visit the Corps’ Little Rock office website.\n\nDierks Lake\n\nFor the Army Corps of Engineers’ real-time lake level and outflow report from Dierks Lake, visit the Corps’ Little Rock office website.\n\nLake Catherine Tailwater (Below Carpenter Dam)\n\nFor weekly flow releases from Carpenter Dam, visit www.entergy.com/hydro\n\n(updated 8-1-2024) Shane Goodner, owner of Catch’em All Guide Service, reports that water temperature is 63 degrees with clear conditions in the tailrace. Entergy has scheduled 8-hour generation times during the week with special periods of flow on the weekends for downstream activities. Tailrace conditions are very good for this time of year as moss and grass growth has been kept at a minimum by the consistent flow of water from the dam. Rainbow trout fishing has hit rock bottom with experienced guides recording zero catches around the dam to the bridge. This occurs every year around this time, but was forced earlier by the spring flooding that displaced thousands of trout downstream that never returned. Trout fishing will return to the area in November when the stocking schedule resumes for the fall season.\n\nThousands of threadfin shad have migrated into the tailrace in huge schools. These baitfish are easily spotted as they congregate near the top of the water column. Striper and hybrid bass activity has been observed in the early morning times, which intensifies during times of generation. Anglers can catch numbers of fish casting topwater lures into areas of activity, such as Zara Spooks and Alabama rigs that closely match the size of the shad. Too large of a presentation is ignored and rarely produces results.\n\nSummertime fishing reports below Carpenter Dam usually resemble a broken record with the absence of rainbow trout and the walleye, crappie, white bass and catfish spawn complete. The doldrums of summer heat go on for months in Arkansas and it appears that a void is created in the area for catchable fish. There will be times where good numbers of white and hybrid bass feed near the dam due to the huge numbers of shad present, and fishermen will have to be diligent in search for these fish as action is short-lived and sporadic. Big stripers move in and out of the tailrace seeking cooler water and forage and can be seen feeding below the bridge in deeper water in the main channel. Always wear a life jacket when on the water and remember to follow all park and boating regulations as law enforcement is present and checking for violations.\n\nLake Dardanelle\n\nFor the Army Corps of Engineers’ outflow and gauge level reports from Dardanelle, visit the Corps’ Little Rock office website.\n\n(updated 7-18-2024) Seth Boone, superintendent at Lake Dardanelle State Park (479-890-7474), reported that Lake Dardanelle has had some tough fishing the last few weeks with the heat and low water. Black bass seem to be deeper and more likely to be caught while breaking on shad. White bass seem to be doing well around shad spawns in shallow water. Anglers appear to be catching them on spoons and jigs. Catfish are doing OK on chicken liver and worms in the deeper water. “Crappie, I have had no word on,” he said. “Bream are doing well on crickets and worms.”\n\nLake Hamilton\n\nNo reports.\n\nLake Nimrod\n\nFor the Army Corps of Engineers’ real-time lake level and outflow reports from Nimrod Lake, visit the Corps’ Little Rock office website.\n\nLake Ouachita\n\nFor the current lake level at Blakely Dam, click here.\n\n(updated 8-1-2024) Todd Gadberry at Mountain Harbor Resort and Spa (870-867-2191/800-832-2276 out-of-state) said black bass are slow. Try a topwater bait near main lake and secondary points or a Texas-rigged Ole Monster worm near brush after dark. Walleye are good and being caught on nightcrawlers near structure with a drop-shot rig or jigging spoon.\n\nStripers are good. These fish are being caught in the eastern portions of the lake and can be caught on umbrella rigs or live bait. Bream are good and being caught on crickets and worms in the 15- to 25-feet range. Crappie are still fair. Try minnows or small jigs over structure in the 20- to 40-feet range. For catfish, try stink bait or cut bait on a rod-and-reel setup in the 15- to 25-feet range, especially near structure and brush.\n\nWater temperature stayed the same as recent weeks, ranging 82-86 degrees. The clarity is clear. Lake level is still on a slight fall and Wednesday was 574.73 feet msl. Call the Mountain Harbor fishing guides (Mike Wurm, 501-622-7717, or Chris Darby, 870-867-7822) for more information.\n\nBlue Mountain Lake\n\nFor the Army Corps of Engineers’ real-time lake level and outflow reports from Blue Mountain Lake, visit the Corps’ Little Rock office website."
