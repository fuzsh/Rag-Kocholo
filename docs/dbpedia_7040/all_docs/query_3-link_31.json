        "text": "Moe Cully, of Port Arthur, Texas, took his last breath at Oak Grove Nursing Home, in Groves, Texas, on May 8, 2022. The love of his life, Henny, and his children were gathered around him, holding his hands, just as they hoped to.\n\nMoe was born in Teaneck, New Jersey, on August 19, 1941 to the late John D. and Ethel (Waldron) O’Berry. About the age of 10, his family moved to St. Petersburg, FL. Shortly after this, Moe discovered a neighbor’s printing press in his garage that he found very interesting. This is what got him started in the printing industry. After schooling and training, Moe went to work for a chain of newspapers and worked for many of them around the country. He settled in Port Arthur in 1973 and worked for the Port Arthur News as a pressroom superintendent. Moe met his bride of 47 years at this job. In his words…“Henny was the best thing that happened to me” and “together we have a wonderful daughter, Felicia”. Moe was a dedicated member of the Lions Club since December 1976. He held many offices in the District since 1978. He was involved in the Texas Lions Camp in Kerrville, TX. Over the past 40 years he served on several boards in the Nederland and Port Arthur area. When time permitted, he enjoyed fishing with his grandchildren and listening to nature. He was also known for jumping in the car and taking a road trip! HE ALWAYS LOVED TO TALK ABOUT LIONISM! Per Moe- “IT IS GREAT TO BE A LION”\n\nSurvivors include the love of his life, Henriette “Henny” (Cushion) Cully; daughter, Felicia (Mike) Simmons; grandchildren, Michael “Clay” and Chyann Simmons, of LaBelle, Texas; Mason Nichting, of Minnesota– daughter, Janette (Jeff) Lindsey, of Nome, Texas; Annette (Randall) Carson of Tatum, Texas; son, Kevin (Rhonda) Bass of Rose City, Texas; grandchildren, Whitney and Chance Lindsey, Brian and David Carson, Cory and Krista Bass, Hunter and Caytelyn Block and five great-grandchildren.\n\nPreceded in death by his parents, John D and Ethel (Waldron) O’Berry; daughter, Cheryl Lynn (Cully) Nichting, of Blooming, Minnesota; brother, Warren H Cully, of Marrero, Louisiana; and sister, Sandra Renee Boice, of Iverness, Florida.\n\nA gathering of Mr. Cully’s family and friends will begin at 9:00 a.m., with his memorial service at 11:00 a.m., Saturday, May 14, 2022, at Proctor Baptist Church, 4401 Jimmy Johnson Boulevard, Port Arthur.
