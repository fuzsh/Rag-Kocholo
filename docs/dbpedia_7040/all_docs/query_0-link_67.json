        "text": "Stephen Coonts author of Flight of the Intruder Back before the earth cooled I had the extreme good fortune to fly A-6 Intruders from the deck of the Enterprise during the Vietnam War, an extraordinary experience that I have carried with me every day of my life since. The flying, the flak, the SAMs, the brotherhood of rare and honorable men -- John Sherwood captures the raw essence of the great American adventure that was the Vietnam air war in this thoughtful, informative look at some of the legendary aerial warriors of that age. Fast Movers is the next best thing to being there.\n\nWalter J. Boyne author of Beyond the Wild Blue: A History of the United States Air Force, 1947-1997 Fast Movers is the best thing ever done on the personalities of the men who flew jet fighters in Vietnam. John Sherwood's trenchant analysis of emotions, motives, triumphs, and defeats of the men who fought the air war belongs on every book shelf.\n\nBarrett Tillman author of MiG Master and co-author of On Yankee Station: The Naval Air War Over Vietnam Fast Movers is one of the most intriguing books to emerge from the Vietnam air war. Having known several of the major players since they returned from combat. I can say that John Sherwood portrays them accurately, candidly, and objectively. His selection of individuals, personalities, and tactical aircraft does credit to the Vietnam generation of aerial tigers: men who willingly went Up North, survived flak, SAMs, MiGs, and their own politicians -- and came back for seconds. Fast Movers not only describes what they did, but more importantly, it answers Lord Tennyson's fabled question: The Reason Why.\n\nMark Berent author of Eagle Station and Phantom Leader Fast Movers names names, warriors, and wings. The leadership and dedication of its air warriors are brilliantly brought to heroic life by John Sherwood. He has captured the unadulterated essence of air warriors -- what makes them tick, and what makes them stick to missions thought impossible.\n\nDarrel Whitcomb author of The Rescue of Bat 21 Desperate men in desperate situations -- held together by a special bond. John Sherwood has captured the real stories of some of the finest Air Force, Marine, and Navy aviators of our long war in Southeast Asia. Up close and personal, he reminds us that war is a uniquely human endeavor and that the man, not the aircraft he \"straps on,\" is really the weapon."
