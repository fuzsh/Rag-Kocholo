        "text": "If you fancy yourself as an undiscovered artist, or you are actually a much-discovered artist, then why not contribute to the rather fun charity Quiz Book on Robin of Sherwood? Chinbeard Books are looking for submissions!\n\n“This will be an official release but a charity publication, so we can’t offer fees, says Barnaby Eaton-Jones at Chinbeard. “So sorry”.\n\nThere’s a dedicated Facebook group – Sherwood Quiz, unsurprisingly! – with more information.\n\n“I guess you probably have to like Robin of Sherwood to contribute, Barnaby continues, “but, well, now’s as good a time as any to delve into the show, in the 40th anniversary year.\n\n“Everyone is welcome to share this news” he continues with other artistically minded fans. It would be lovely to have a broad range of illustrations.”\n\nChinbeard publish a range of Robin of Sherwood titles. Check them out here on the show’s website.\n\nRobin of Sherwood was an HTV production in association with Goldcrest Television Ltd. and first broadcasted in the UK on the ITV network and in the United States on Showtime cable channel and various PBS stations. It was written by Richard Carpenter, produced by Paul Knight and directed by Ian Sharp.\n\nMade from 1983-1985, it ran for three seasons, from 1984 to 1986. The first season (five episodes, including one two-hour/part) and second season (six episodes, also including one two-hour/part) starred Michael Praed as Robin of Loxley, the third season (11 episodes, including two two-hour/part) featured Jason Connery as his successor, Robert of Huntingdon. It was shot on film, and almost entirely on location, mostly in the north east and south west of England as HTV was based in Bristol.\n\nRobin of Sherwood has since become a cult series and is for many people the definitive version of the Robin Hood legend.\n\n• Check out the Facebook Sherwood Quiz page\n\nCategories: Art and Illustration, downthetubes News, Other Worlds, Television"
