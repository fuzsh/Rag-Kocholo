What is this New York Yankees Logo?

The New York Yankees road jersey logo worn for over 40 years, from 1931 to 1972. It showed NEW YORK arched in midnight navy blue on a grey button-up jersey. The Yankees would update this logo, adding white trim, in 1973 before eventually removing it and returning to a style very similar to this one in 2024.
