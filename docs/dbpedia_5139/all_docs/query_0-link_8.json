        "text": "When one thinks of the New York Yankees, most people think of the pinstriped uniform with the letters \"NY\" combined on the cap and shirt. The 'NY' was adapted from a design by Louis B. Tiffany.\n\nBut the primary team logo consists of a red and white striped top hat with blue band and stars, on top of a baseball bat. And now a Yonkers woman is suing the Yankees for trademark infringement over that team symbol.\n\nTanit Buday claims her uncle, Kenneth Timur, was commissioned to create a team logo in 1936 and was never paid for his work. Buday is seeking unspecified damages in the lawsuit.\n\nAlice McGillion, spokesperson for the New York Yankees, told CNN that \"this is a wonderful country where anybody can sue for anything, even when the allegations are over 70 years old.\""
