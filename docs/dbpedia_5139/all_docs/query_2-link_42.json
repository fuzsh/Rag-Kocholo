        "text": "The Yankees are famously averse to change when it comes to their uniforms. But in a move that qualifies as earthshaking news, at least by Yankees standards, the Bronx Bombers appear to be planning a change to their road greys for this season.\n\nAs you’re no doubt aware, the Yanks’ road jerseys have long featured white outlining on the chest lettering and back number, along with decorative trim on the sleeve cuffs. The white outlining and sleeve trim were both added in 1973, when the team transitioned from flannels to stretch knits. But according to a page from the 2024 MLB Style Guide, which was provided to me by a source, the white outlining and sleeve trim are both being eliminated this season:\n\nIf this is really happening, it would make a plain design even plainer. But the Yanks could probably sell it as a legacy move, since it matches what the team wore for many decades in the flannel era:\n\nThe last time the Yankees tinkered with their road uniform was in 2016, when they tightened up the space between “New” and “York”:\n\nAbout two months into that same season, they also changed their road batting helmets from glossy to matte. But I’d say these new changes shown in the Style Guide are more significant than those 2016 changes.\n\nOne other thing: It’s worth noting that the Style Guide shows the sleeve ads for the Mets and Angels, but not for the Yankees. Before we all get too excited, remember that the Yanks’ sleeve ad was announced as running through 2031, so this is probably just a bookkeeping omission in the Guide, not a sign of the ad’s demise.\n\nTo see all my reports on the 2024 MLB Style Guide, look here. I hope to have more MLB news to share soon. Meanwhile, if anyone knows more about the thinking behind these new moves by the Yanks, feel free to be in touch. Anonymity assured, of course.\n\nFinally: To all the Yankees blogs that will be tweeting about this, it would be nice if you could please link to this article instead of just lifting the graphics and saying “per @UniWatch.” Thanks!"
