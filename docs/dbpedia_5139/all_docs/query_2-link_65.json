        "text": "When the New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox take the field in Dyersville next week, the two teams will pay homage to the baseball players of yesteryear by wearing custom throwback-inspired uniforms.\n\nChicago’s uniform will be white with navy pinstripes and the vintage “SOX” monogram stitched onto the left of the jersey. The cap for the White Sox will be a matching white cap with navy pinstripes.\n\nThe Yankees’ uniform will be gray with the “New York” wordmark stitched across the chest in navy blue. The team’s hat is also navy blue and has a larger interlocking “NY” logo in white.\n\nThe White Sox clearly got into the spirit of the Field of Dreams by taking their photos in front of a cornfield backdrop and Twitter thread, asking if they were in heaven — a reference to the 1989 movie.\n\nReplica jerseys and other \"Field of Dreams\" collection items are on sale and can be found at the MLB Shop website.\n\nThe contest, which will take place near the site of the hit movie “Field of Dreams” starring Kevin Costner, will be the first official Major League Baseball regular season game to be played in Iowa.\n\nMore Field of Dreams coverage:\n\n'I'm not missing out on this game': Iowans pay top dollar for MLB's 'Field of Dreams' game tickets\n\nWatch the Register's 20-minute documentary about Iowa's iconic Field of Dreams\n\nPhotos: Aerial views of MLB field at 'Field of Dreams' movie site\n\nHow a 2016 trip to 'Field of Dreams' site convinced MLB commissioner Rob Manfred to hold game there\n\nIf you weren't a lucky Iowan who was able to get tickets through the lottery, the MLB at Field of Dreams game will be televised on Fox at 6 p.m. CT on Aug. 12."
