        "text": "8 iconic NYC venues still hosting live music\n\nBy Aaron Ginsburg\n\nLive music has always been an integral part of New York City's identity, with many of the last century's cultural movements taking root in the basements and stages of iconic music venues. While many of these historic spots have disappeared, a few continue to host live performances today.

The Landmarks Preservation Commission this week designated the Heckscher Building at 730 Fifth Avenue as an individual landmark, officially recognizing the tower's ornate French Renaissance style, influence on Midtown's iconic commercial corridor, and overall impact on the New York City skyline. The tower, built 100 years ago and renamed the Crown Building in the 1980s for its gilded appearance, is now home to Aman New York, a luxe hotel-condo with 83 hotel rooms and 22 residences.\n\ndetails here\n\nVintage photos look back on the futuristic 1964 New York World’s Fair in Queens\n\nBy Aaron Ginsburg\n\nThis year marks the 60th anniversary of the 1964-1965 New York World’s Fair in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens. Taking place just 25 years after the 1939 World’s Fair in the same location, the World’s Fair was the largest international exhibition ever constructed in the United States, with 140 pavilions representing 80 nations, 24 U.S. states, and more than 45 corporations across 656 acres. The event, which took place for two six-month seasons between April 1964 and October 1965, provided a sense of optimism for a country embroiled in unrest both at home and abroad. Led by \"master-builder\" Robert Moses, the fair embraced the Space Age era, which included a creative, futuristic aesthetic inspired by advancing technologies and innovative architecture. Ahead, explore the World’s Fair with historic photos and hear from World's Fair expert, Bill Cotter, on the lasting legacy of the event in New York and beyond.\n\nSEE WHAT THE FAIR WAS LIKE\n\nBook fair will feature rare photos of the chaotic and complex early construction of the NYC subway\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nThe ABAA New York International Antiquarian Book Fair (NYIABF) will be back at the Park Avenue Armory for its 64th year this month. A highlight of the fair is Capitol Hill Books' photographic archive of 37 albumen photographs that show the very first branch of the NYC subway system being built. Taken in 1901 and 1902, the photos reveal the complex first stages of the city's transit system, which has been running without interruption since it opened to the public in 1904. The rare photos show now-defunct sections like the Elm Street Route and the laborers who built the system, largely by hand.\n\nMore NYC Subway construction photos\n\nNew-York Historical Society exhibit looks back at NYC’s lost landmarks\n\nBy Aaron Ginsburg\n\nA new installation at the New-York Historical Society explores the forgotten places that once defined New York City.

The shop, located at 110 Seventh Avenue and Christopher Street within a distinctive red triangle-shaped building, shut its doors amid an alleged rent dispute between owner Andy Singh and landlord Jon Posner, as reported by Curbed.

It was reported that 1,800 vehicles and 150,300 people total crossed what was then the only land passage between Brooklyn and Manhattan. The bridge--later dubbed the Brooklyn Bridge, a name that stuck--went on to become one of the most iconic landmarks in New York. There's been plenty of history, and secrets, along the way. Lesser-known facts about the bridge include everything from hidden wine cellars to a parade of 21 elephants crossing in 1884.\n\nAll the secrets right this way\n\n7 historic places in NYC recommended for state and national designation\n\nBy Aaron Ginsburg\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul last week announced the 36 properties and places in New York nominated for potential placement on the State and National Register of Historic Places. The seven New York City recommendations include Bushwick's historic William Ulmer Brewery, the city's first cast-iron office building, and a new historic district in Central Harlem that illustrates the neighborhood's development as a Black working-class residential neighborhood.\n\nget the details\n\nIn the 1800s, a group of NYC artists and writers created the modern-day Santa Claus\n\nBy Lucie Levine\n\nSaint Nicholas arrived in New York with the Dutch and became the Patron Saint of New York City in the early 19th century, but Santa, as we know him, is a hometown boy. New York’s writers and artists were the first to depict the modern Santa Claus, transforming the figure of Dutch lore into a cheerful holiday hero. The illustrious Claus gained his sleigh in Chelsea and his red suit on Franklin Square. With a little help from the likes of Washington Irving, Clement Clarke Moore, and Thomas Nast, jolly old St. Nick became the merriest man in Manhattan.\n\nMore about Santa's New York Roots!"
