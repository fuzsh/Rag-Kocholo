        "text": "The loyal readers of the blog have most assuredly realized that Yankee Yapping has been conspicuous by its long absence.\n\nThere hasn’t been a new post in nearly three years, for a variety of reasons. Responsibilities of life. Commitments. Errands. Downtime.\n\nIt’s been a struggle to balance it all and make time for Yankee Yapping.\n\nWhen I first started Yankee Yapping in July of 2009, I was an ambitious, aspiring sports reporter with a year left in college. I was encouraged by an interview subject (who happened to be Rick Wolff, son of the late Bob Wolff, who called Don Larsen’s perfect game in the 1956 World Series) to start my own blog and to write about topics that interest me. And so the journey began.\n\nI was able to maintain the blog when I began my career as a professional sports reporter, working for The North County News and subsequently, The Examiner, in Westchester County. Both being hyper-local weekly newspapers, deadlines were generous and thus, there was plenty of time for blogging.\n\nWhen I started working full-time at the daily Poughkeepsie Journal over four years ago, I knew my time for Yankee Yapping was going to become limited, at best. The original schedule I worked was 2:30 p.m. until 10:30 p.m., five – sometimes six – days a week. My schedule has since changed, but the workload hasn’t.\n\nIn fact, over the past year, I’ve been asked to take up news reporting one day a week. It’s made sports reporting a little more challenging, trying to balance the time for creating good, compelling sports stories while standing on my tip-toes and being ready to run at a moment’s notice for breaking news.\n\nHowever, I do feel I’ve evolved as a journalist. And, the work has been worth the rewards.\n\nI won first place in the 2017 New York State Associated Press contest for my story Sidelined: Men outnumber women in coaching roles. The same story won the Distinguished Sports Writing Award of Excellence in the New York News Publishers Association contest. On top of that, myself and two of my colleagues won the NYNPA Distinguished Live Sports Coverage Award of Excellence.\n\nIt’s good to know the work I’m doing is making an impact and people are reading. And while there really isn’t much time to enjoy the fruits of your labor as a sports reporter, as once you finish one story it’s right on to the next one, much of the sports work I’ve been assigned these past few years has been enjoyable.\n\nAmong my personal favorite stories, both baseball and non-baseball related include:\n\nCovering a rehab start made by none other than Matt Harvey, with the New York Mets at the time.\n\nInterviewing Dennis Haskins, AKA Mr. Belding of “Saved by the Bell” fame, at a Minor League Baseball team’s promotional night.\n\nCovering Brendan McKay, the fourth overall pick in the 2017 MLB Draft. McKay is a hybrid pitcher/first baseman, and obvious comparisons have been drawn between him and Shohei Otani.\n\nWriting a feature on Blake Butera, who at 25 last year, was the youngest manager in all of pro baseball.\n\nCovering the budding career of Lenny Torres, a local flamethrower drafted 41st overall last June by the Cleveland Indians. (Look out for this kid; he’s only 18 and his cackling fastball can touch 98 mph. If that’s not enough, he can throw footballs almost the length of the field!)\n\nWriting a story on how minor league baseball players adjust when living with host families.\n\nAn interview and story on former New York Jets and current Seattle Seahawks kicker Jason Myers (although he was with the Jacksonville Jaguars when I did the story).\n\nAn interview and story on New York Giants General Manager Dave Gettleman (As a note, he got the job with the Giants after I interviewed him; he was in between jobs at the time, following his firing by the Carolina Panthers).\n\nAn interview with Rey Mysterio, former world wrestling champion of WWE and WCW fame.\n\nBasically becoming a beat writer for Tyler Adams, formerly of the New York Red Bulls and U.S. Men’s National Team, now with RB Leipzig in Germany.\n\nAnd recently, a story on Lucio Battista, a man with a crazy mustache who will attempt to make waves on the TV show “American Ninja Warrior” later this month.\n\nOh, and if you’re wondering what it’s like to dive feet-first into a breaking news assignment, well… Sometimes there are alligators. Yes, alligators.\n\nOf course, none of these are stories about the Yankees. But as a sports reporter I’ve learned, the reality is, you often don’t get to pick what you want to write about; what your passions are. Still, there are ways to have fun with your beat and have fun with the job, even if you’re not writing about the Yankees.\n\nThat being said, my Yankee fandom hasn’t waned. I still watch as many games as I can and have attended a handful of games since the last Yankee Yapping post.\n\nI actually checked off an item from the bucket list on Aug. 12, 2016, attending the Yankees’ game against the Tampa Bay Rays. Kevin Kiermaier or Steven Souza Jr. – still don’t know which player – tossed me a ball during batting practice.\n\nThat game also happened to be Alex Rodriguez’s last hurrah, and it came on the eve of the Yankees calling up Aaron Judge.\n\nWhat I haven’t done, though, is sit in the Yankee Stadium press box to cover a game. Or interview Derek Jeter. And obviously, I am not working for MLB.com. So, yes. There are some unrealized dreams out there.\n\nPerhaps, if I remain as lucky as I’ve been, one day those dreams will come true. But, even if they don’t, I’ve already been blessed with a fine career that’s spanned almost a decade and has included great stories, interviews with great people and feedback from great readers.\n\nNo, I may not have landed the Jeter interview or coverage of a Yankee game, yet I’m proud of the hard work I have done – and that includes Yankee Yapping.\n\nMLB.com recognized Yankee Yapping several times. David Cone mentioned Yankee Yapping during the telecast of a game on the YES Network. Author Danny Peary even included an excerpt from Yankee Yapping in a book he wrote about Jeter.\n\nIt’s been amazing. And now… Can I say it’s over? Is Yankee Yapping officially going into the Monument Park of blogs and retiring?\n\nI don’t know. What I do know is, for now, it will remain on pause as my full-time job at The Poughkeepsie Journal and USA Today Network continues.\n\nMaybe in a month, I’ll get the itch to talk about why I think Judge deserves to be the American League’s Most Valuable Player.\n\nMaybe at the end of the season, if the Yanks win the World Series, I’ll want to write about the thrill of number 28 and what the title would mean to me.\n\nMaybe at the end of 2019, or in 2020 or beyond, I’ll be writing to let everyone know MLB.com has hired me as a staff writer.\n\nAnything can happen.\n\nI occasionally still tweet on the Yankee Yapping Twitter account (@YankeeYapping) and feel free to follow me on my (hopefully soon-to-be verified!) professional account, @AJ_Martelli, where I tweet about games I’m covering and stories I’m doing, but still tweet about the Yankees, from time to time.\n\nI can’t thank the readers of Yankee Yapping enough. It has been appreciated, even after all this time!\n\nI’m bad at goodbyes. So I’m not saying goodbye. It’s not goodbye.\n\nI’ll see you later.\n\nI was holding my nephew in the standing room behind the right field wall.\n\nWe were on Yankee Stadium’s main level, looking down at Carlos Beltran. The Bombers were getting slaughtered by Tampa Ray late in the game. The Rays were on the verge of avoiding a sweep.\n\n“Someday, we’ll be watching you down there, buddy,” I told him.\n\nThat’s what my dad said to me at my first game.\n\nDo you remember your first time?\n\nMaybe it was with your dad in the 1950s, when you walked into the old Yankee Stadium. You saw Mickey Mantle get on his horse and chase down fly balls in the outfield, only to later have that topped by watching him smash a 500-foot home run.\n\nPerhaps, like this writer, it was with your family sometime in the 1990s, when you excitedly marched into the House that Ruth Built. You witnessed Don Mattingly make web gem after web gem at first base, and were then treated to his grandiose power with the bat.\n\nWhichever game it was, you’ll never forget it. That game likely got you hooked as a Yankee fan for life.\n\nThat type of journey began for someone very close to me yesterday. That would be my 4-year-old nephew, Ryan.\n\nMy sister sent me a text message around 10:30 p.m. Friday night.\n\n“You want to go to the Yankee game Sunday? We’re thinking of taking Ryan for his first game, and I’m sure he would love it if his uncle was there.”\n\nOf course, I obliged. I’m not one to pass up a Yankee game, especially one so meaningful.\n\nRyan was very excited I was joining him, his mom and his dad (his mom and dad being my sister and her boyfriend) for the day. The excitement began in the car, long before we arrived in the Bronx.\n\nBut, we eventually got there without wearing ourselves out too much.\n\nWe walked into the Great Hall. I held Ryan’s hand as we walked towards our seats in the left-center field bleachers. We sat down and right away Ryan was cheering.\n\n“Go Yankees!” he shouted.\n\nIn short, I thought the Yanks might win this one. I had that “we’re going to win today” mentality. What better way to introduce him to the Yankees than by a win?\n\nThose high hopes were dashed pretty quickly, however.\n\nStarting pitcher Michael Pineda got two quick outs in the first inning, only to get absolutely shelled thereafter. Just when it appeared it would be a fast, 1-2-3 frame, he fell apart and let up two two-run home runs and an RBI double. The hitting barrage gave Tampa Bay a 5-0 lead after just one half-inning.\n\nPineda finished the day having allowed 10 hits in five innings. Four of those 10 hits ended up in the seats.\n\nThe Yanks mustered just one run in the form of an RBI double in the bottom of the fourth off the bat of Alex Rodriguez, as the Rays avoided the sweep and took an 8-1 win from New York.\n\nDespite the loss, I think Ryan enjoyed himself and wasn’t so concerned with the final score.\n\nHe took in the little things.\n\nIn particular, he was fond of how the stadium plays the “Stars Wars” theme during the lineup introductions — as we all know, the Imperial March for the visitors and the main theme for the Yanks.\n\nIn fact, I tried to use Ryan’s love of “Star Wars” in order to show him which team we were rooting for.\n\n“The Yankees are the team in white. The team in grey – they’re the bad guys,” I told him.\n\nNot saying it backfired, but he then thought Tampa Bay had Darth Vader-like evil status.\n\nWhat I was most proud of was his behavior. There were other children his age in our section, moving all over the place and misbehaving. Ryan, on the other hand, sat still for most of the game and drew the attention of some of the other fans.\n\nThey compli mented him on how well-behaved he was.\n\nFor the future, we now know we can take him to a game and can expect good conduct from him.\n\nAnd hopefully, his good behavior can be rewarded at his next game with a Yankee win.\n\nTwitter: @YankeeYapping\n\nEver since 2009, the Yankees have put on what they call HOPE Week.\n\nHope. Helping Others Persevere and Excel.\n\nOne week out of the summer, the Bronx Bombers spotlight individuals, families or organizations worthy of support and recognition. Each day during HOPE Week, honorees share their inspirational stories with the Yankee players, the fans and of course the media.\n\nThey are then treated to a special day courtesy of the Yankees — almost becoming like full-on members of the team, participating in team activities, in addition to the Yankees’ outreach. The experience is complete with a ceremony at Yankee Stadium before the start of the game. The Yankees have yet to announce when HOPE Week will take place this season.\n\nWhenever HOPE Week happens, it impacts everyone. The interviews with the honorees and players alone are enough to tug at your heart strings.\n\nYankees.com says “all (HOPE Week) events are designed to generate attention and raise the profile of serious social issues affecting our nation and the world.”\n\nWe all have problems. A bad day. A career not going in the upward direction you may want it to. A breakup with a significant other. Trifles with paying bills. Whatever it may be.\n\nThen you take a look at the folks involved with something like HOPE Week, and it puts everything into perspective. Take for example the first-ever HOPE Week honoree: a United States Army veteran who lost the use of his arms and legs to Lou Gehrig’s disease.\n\nImagine how hard this hero has to battle every day.\n\nAgain, perspective.\n\nMy experience in terms of putting everything into perspective came nine days ago.\n\nAs part of my job, I covered the figure skating event of New York’s winter Special Olympics. That day, I was battling a lot of pain from an agonizing toothache. I had been toiling with a long feature story I was working on, and recently I’ve been coming to grips with the loss of someone I care about.\n\nIt’s been challenging. And not so fun. Enough to get me feeling bad.\n\nThen I met a few of the athletes of the Special Olympics. Young men, women older than me. All with difficulties. I watched as some of them struggled to just get out onto the ice and perform. A few of them fell down, but when they did, they regained their vertical base, brushed off the slush and kept skating.\n\nI wound up interviewing a skater from Rochester, New York. I could tell she had a hard time getting through the interview. She seemed a little overwhelmed talking to a reporter, but within a few minutes she got the words out as articulately as she could.\n\nShe never gave up. That’s what I was most impressed with.\n\nWhatever problems I have, I now know first-hand there are others with difficulties that surpass mine. Others who have to handle those difficulties in everyday life and in everything they do, yet they still find courage to do the things that make them happy, like figure skating.\n\nAnd even when they fall down doing what they love, they get back up and finish.\n\nThey persevere. They excel.\n\nI can only guess the Yankee players feel the same way during HOPE Week every year. They likely gain that same perspective. They hear stories and meet folks who make an 0-for seem quite inconsequential.\n\nAs for me. The toothache? I went to the dentist. I’m no longer in pain. The feature? It got done. You can read it here. The loss of that person I care about? Eh. That remains to nag me day and night.\n\nBut then I consider that figure skater who never gave up. How she competed then got through my interview with her, despite it clearly being an obstacle.\n\nIf she can keep going, so can I. So can all of us.\n\nTwitter: @YankeeYapping\n\nSunday marked the final day of the 2015 regular Major League Baseball season. Which, figuratively speaking, meant all 30 clubs used their might to push the sun back up into the sky and give us one more day of summer.\n\nEven though it was a blustery October day.\n\nThe baseball world also learned the layout of this year’s postseason; who’s in the dance and who’s not. After days of waiting, we now know the Yankees will host the Houston Astros at 8:08 p.m. on Tuesday in a do-or-die Wild Card game. The defending American League champions and winners of the American League Central division, the Kansas City Royals, will take on whoever emerges victorious Tuesday night.\n\nThe road is going to be anything but easy for the pinstripers, who in terms of the playoffs, aren’t on the outside looking in for the first time since 2012.\n\nBut the playoffs start Tuesday. Now is yearly time for regular season reflection. A chance to tout the achievements of the 2015 Yankee team.\n\nYes, the annual awards.\n\nYankee Yapping Rookie of the Year\n\nWinner: Greg Bird\n\nGreg Bird flew in on Aug. 13, and could not have landed at a better time. Four days after he was promoted to the big club, first baseman Mark Teixeira fouled a ball off his leg and was injured. Bird was thrust into the role of everyday first baseman, and to say the least, he rose to the occasion and produced.\n\nIn his short time with the club (45 games), Bird knocked in 30 runs, slugged .523 and generated an on-base-plus-slugging percentage of .862. What’s more, he flexed his muscles with 11 homers. This writer, in fact, saw one of those round-trippers live on Sept. 7, when he crushed a home run in the Yankees’ 8-6 win over the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nThe 22-year-old Bird truly soared like an eagle since his arrival. And if the Yankees want a deep run in the postseason this month, he really must spread his wings.\n\nYankee Yapping Comeback Player of the Year\n\nWinner: Alex Rodriguez\n\nThe type of season Alex Rodriguez put together was nothing short of remarkable. Perhaps the most stunning aspect of his 33-home run, 86-RBI campaign is that no one predicted it.\n\nIf you would have asked even the staunchest proponent of A-Rod’s at the beginning of the season, they likely would have said his ceiling was 20 homers and 55 RBI.\n\nRodriguez not only proved the naysayers (including this writer) wrong, but he did so in historic fashion. On May 7 Rodriguez passed Willie Mays on the all-time home runs list, mashing a tater off Chris Tillman of the Orioles.\n\nA month and 12 days later, Rodriguez blasted a first-inning home run off Justin Verlander of the visiting Detroit Tigers. It was his 3,000th career hit, and only the third time in baseball history (behind Wade Boggs and Derek Jeter) a player hit the ball into the stands for his 3,000th career hit.\n\nRodriguez also set an AL record for most career RBI, passed 2,000 career RBI, and passed Roberto Clemente on baseball’s all-time hits list.\n\nOh, and with three homers in one game against the Minnesota Twins on July 25, Rodriguez became the fifth-oldest player to hit three homers in a single game.\n\nSome possible attribution to Rodriguez’s success: making him, at age 40, the full-time designated hitter. That decision by the Yankees has paid dividends. Rodriguez appearing in 150 games this season is proof of that.\n\nEither way, the type of season he had – I’d call that a comeback. A comeback with a vengeance.\n\nYankee Yapping Ace of the Year\n\nWinner: Masahiro Tanaka\n\nAdmit it. You thought Masahiro Tanaka’s elbow was going to fall off.\n\nLast summer when it was revealed the Yankees’ big-ticket starting pitcher had a partial tear of his ulnar collateral ligament in his pitching arm, most Yankee fans panicked. They feared the three words that are as common as a routine fly ball in this day and age: Tommy John surgery.\n\nTanaka opted to treat his tear with a platelet rich plasma injection, and came back to pitch in 2014. Before the season began, Yankee manager Joe Girardi said he expected Tanaka to make 34 starts.\n\nSkip’ was 10 numbers off, as Tanaka made 24 starts. Forearm and wrist soreness sidelined him early in the season, plus when the opportunities arose, Girardi rested him.\n\nDespite missing those 10 games and spending time on the disabled list, the man from Japan proved to be pretty effective when he needed to be.\n\nOn Sept. 13 in particular, he hurled seven shutout innings in the Bronx as the Yankees blanked the Toronto Blue Jays, 5-0. Although Toronto went on to win the AL East, the game was important in terms of staying in the race for the division title.\n\nAgainst those same Jays at Rogers Centre on Aug. 15, Tanaka put on a virtuoso performance. He tossed a complete game five-hitter, and the Yanks beat the Jays, 4-1.\n\nTanaka’s won-lost record isn’t reflective of a very dominant season: 12-7. His season earned run average wasn’t bad, but not the lowest number out there: 3.51. He gave up 25 home runs over the course of the year, which in the eyes of many armchair managers, is probably too many.\n\nBut he gave the Yankees 150-plus innings. Tanaka kept the ball in the strike zone by fanning 139 hitters – and only issuing 27 walks. He performed when they needed him to perform.\n\nAnd he will need to bring his maestro-like skills on Tuesday and serenade the Bronx with another rendition of the tune “Tanaka wins.”\n\nYankee Yapping Platinum Sluggers of the Year\n\nWinners: Mark Teixeira and Carlos Beltran\n\nThe Yankees suffered a devastating blow on Aug. 17 when Mark Teixeira fouled a ball off his leg. The first baseman sustained a fracture, and the injury –a freak injury, at that – ended his season.\n\nBut before he was forced to watch the rest of the 2015 from the bench, Teixeira was raking. He crushed 31 homers and drove in 79 runs. He was on pace to smash 40 or more homers, drive in over 100 runs and analysts put his name and the term “American League Most Valuable Player” in the same sentence at certain times.\n\nThe injury may have negated it all, but make no mistake about it: Teixeira played well.\n\nCarlos Beltran on the other hand avoided major injuries, and turned on the jets during the second half of the season. After the All-Star break, Beltran clubbed 12 of his 19 home runs. He finished with 67 RBI, 37 of which came after the midway point.\n\nBeltran’s best may be yet to come, as he’s a well-known stud in the playoffs. So much so, in fact, that he’s earned the nickname “Senor Octubre” among some folks.\n\nIn the postseason, Beltran is a lifetime .333 hitter with 16 homers and 40 RBI. He’s also scored 45 runs, slugged .683 and owns a .445 on-base percentage.\n\nIn less than 48 hours we’ll see if he delivers, but he went out with a bang: three hits in the Yanks’ 9-4 loss to Baltimore in the season finale Sunday.\n\nYankee Yapping Reliever of the Year\n\nWinner: Dellin Betances\n\nAlthough he’s been struggling of late, Dellin Betances was as consistent as they come this year.\n\nAn almost automatic eighth inning shutdown machine, Betances struck out 131 hitters in just 84 innings pitched. Of those 84 innings, he only allowed 45 hits. However, his walk total was a bit high: he issued 40 free passes. But most of the time, he was able to wiggle out of danger.\n\nCase in point: Sept. 7.\n\nBetances walked the first three he faced, but bounced back to strike out the next three in order.\n\nWhat’s more, he showed maneuverability. Betances took on the closer role when needed, and saved nine games.\n\nYankee Yapping Most Valuable Player\n\nWinner: Andrew Miller\n\nThe formula was simple. A song with a statement played, the closer came in and then slammed the door.\n\n“You can run on for a long time. Run on for a long time. Run on for a long time. Sooner or later, God’ll cut you down.”\n\nThe words heard each time Andrew Miller came in to finish off the opposing team.\n\nFightin’ words. One might even say words a little harsher than the lyrics to “Enter Sandman,” used by Mariano Rivera, one of Miller’s predecessors.\n\nHarsher words, perhaps, but when the sweet sounds of Johnny Cash came blaring through the Yankee Stadium speakers, you knew the game was over.\n\nMiller saved 36 games in 38 opportunities this season, striking out 100 batters in 61 2/3 innings. He held opponents to a .151 batting average, and tested hitters while attacking them.\n\nA tactic Troy Tulowitzki knows about.\n\nOn Aug. 14 with the game on the line, the Blue Jays shortstop stood between the Yankees and a pivotal win. It took 12 pitches and the dramatic at-bat put the baseball world on the edge of its collective seat, but Miller got the job done.\n\nHis whiff of Tulowitzki was one of the most clutch performances of the season, and one of the many examples of how valuable he truly was.\n\nYankee Yapping Lifetime Achievement Award\n\nWinner: Yogi Berra\n\nThe world – not just the baseball world, the world in general – lost a treasure the morning of Sept. 22.\n\nLawrence Peter “Yogi” Berra, the Yankees’ famed catcher and legendary philosopher, passed away at the age of 90.\n\nBerra won the most World Series of any player in history with 13 (10 as a player, three as a coach). He smacked 358 home runs and possessed a lifetime batting average of .285. It’d be easy to sit here and write out every noted accolade Berra amassed over the course of his career.\n\nBut let’s talk about the man for a second.\n\nLet’s mention how in love he was with his wife Carmen, and his family. Let’s mention how he served our great country as a gunner’s mate in the United States Navy during World War II. Let’s mention how his wit and easygoing personality impacted everyone around him, even those he didn’t personally know.\n\nHis fantastic “Yogi-isms” will be a part of our culture forever. Our millennial generation can now pass on his wisdom. The next era needs to know that you can observe a lot by watching, and that baseball is 90 percent half mental.\n\nThe rest is physical.\n\nThe YES Network publicly aired Berra’s funeral – a beautiful sendoff for a beautiful man. I noticed the gospel passage, which was elegantly read by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, was the same gospel passage read at my grandfather’s funeral on April 15 last year. John 14:1-7, a reading that explores comfort in a time of impending sadness.\n\nI felt that only fitting, especially because I read an article with the headline “Yogi Berra, ‘everyone’s grandfather,’ dies.”\n\nAgain, fitting. Grandfathers have a way about them, brightening the lives of their grandchildren. How many lives has Berra illuminated with his wit and charm?\n\nToo many to count.\n\nBerra has a prime seat in Heaven now for the postseason. Maybe the proverbial fork in the road is the World Series.\n\nGo ahead, Yankees. Take it.\n\nTwitter: @YankeeYapping\n\nYankees vs. Houston Astros\n\nWhat: American League Wild Card game\n\nWhen: 8:08 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 6\n\nWhere: Yankee Stadium, Bronx, New York\n\nHouston probable pitcher: Dallas Keuchel (20-8, 2.48 ERA)\n\nNew York probable pitcher: Masahiro Tanaka (12-7, 3.51 ERA)\n\nTV: ESPN"
