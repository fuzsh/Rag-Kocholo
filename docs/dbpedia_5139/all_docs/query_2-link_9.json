        "text": "The Yankees Quietly Have New Road Uniforms, And Made Them Even More Boring\n\nIt’s just one week into the 2024 MLB season, and if you’re a New York Yankees fan, you may have notice something different about the Bronx Bombers. True, they’ve come out of the gates hot and are undefeated. The Yankees new uniforms have also been part of their opening-week activity.\n\nThe team opened on the road with four games in Houston and now have been facing the defending National League champion Arizona Diamondbacks. Without an alternate jersey in their uniform rotation, of course this means that Yanks wearing their typical road greys. Except something is different.\n\nIt’s a well-known fact that the Yankees franchise is all about preserving history and tradition. From pinstripes, to no names on the back of their jerseys, to no facial hair, the are some expectations with the brand that are a given.\n\nThis often raises a polarizing point. Some fans love the tradition as it honors all the greats who have put on a Yankee uniform. However, some fans would prefer they keep up with the times a bit. The MLB has made efforts to appeal to younger generations with initiatives like the City Connect uniforms. In addition, alternate-color jerseys have been widely popular amongst almost every other organization.\n\nNow Yankees fans can hang their hat on the fact that the team very quietly adjusted their road look. The challenge is, they essentially toned them down.\n\nThe new look is more reflective of the Babe Ruth years than the Juan Soto years. This begs the question, did these uniforms somehow get worse?\n\nHere Is What Is Going On With The Yankees New Uniforms\n\nAgain, this is specific to just the grey set the team wears on the road. The first thing you will notice is the “New York” insignia across the chest. The navy letters are no longer outlined in white. There is no two-tone at all, it’s simply navy blue New York stitched onto the jersey. The same holds true for the numeral on the back of the jersey. It is no longer outlined in white.\n\nThen, on the sleeves, the white and navy trim cuffs are also gone. This essentially looked like bands around the bicep portion of the sleeve. Now, it’s simply just the grey with cuff.\n\nThis style has a legacy look to it. It’s very similar to what Mickey Mantle wore in the Bronx or even Babe Ruth. Except that was 100 years ago.\n\nPrior to spring training, MLB detailed how Nike was bringing an innovative approach to MLB uniforms. The new Nike Vapor uniform style was more comfortable, breathable, and lighter weight to maximize comfort and durability for the players.\n\nThe only problem is, for the Yankees, in a heavy sweat these new road greys look like a soaked t-shirt that was just worn in a marathon.\n\nUni Watch recently explained how the white trim that has been removed first premiered on the Yankees uniform in 1973. The team might have gone back to a look from 52 years ago, but for whatever the reason, it is working. You may disagree from a fashion perspective, but you can’t argue with their winning percentage (so far).\n\nThe Yankees have started the season 5-0 for just the fourth time in franchise history, and the first time since 1992.\n\n4 Bold Predictions For The 2024 MLB Season\n\nJeff Gorra is a Boston-based writer who has been with Beasley Media Group since the beginning of 2023. He writes about restaurants and food, as well as sports and rock music. His experience also includes show hosting and in-depth creative writing in rock and reggae dub music. Jeff’s an avid surfer, New York Giants, and Pearl Jam fan, however, if you make unforgettable pizza, he is sure to find you."
