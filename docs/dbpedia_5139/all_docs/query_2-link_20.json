        "text": "Katelyn Mulcahy/MLB Photos via Getty Images\n\nThe New York Yankees are reportedly going to look a bit different when they hit the road during the 2024 campaign.\n\nPaul Lukas of Uni Watch cited the 2024 MLB Style Guide and noted the \"white outlining on the chest lettering and back number\" and the \"decorative trim on the sleeve cuffs\" that have been in place since 1973 on the Yankees' road jerseys will be eliminated during the upcoming season.\n\nThis will be the first time New York changes its road uniform since 2016 when the team decreased the amount of space between \"New\" and \"York\" on the front and also changed the helmets from glossy to matte.\n\n\"If this is really happening, it would make a plain design even plainer,\" Lukas wrote. \"But the Yanks could probably sell it as a legacy move, since it matches what the team wore for many decades in the flannel era.\"\n\nThe Yankees are built on tradition with 27 World Series titles and some of the most iconic players to ever play the game.\n\nThat tradition means they often don't make many changes, including to the uniforms. But fans will surely be fine with it if they get over the hump and win championship No. 28 after coming so close in recent years.\n\nNew York missed the playoffs in 2023 but reached the postseason the previous six years. It lost in the American League Championship Series three times in that stretch, making five ALCS losses for the franchise since it last reached the Fall Classic in 2009.\n\nA 14-year title drought isn't that long for many organizations, but it might as well be a lifetime for the Yankees.\n\nThey notably traded for Juan Soto this offseason as they attempt to take the next step and will look to change their recent postseason fortunes in a new road uniform."
