        "text": "The Yankees appear to be making a small but noticeable change to their road uniforms this season.\n\nThe club is ditching the white piping around the navy blue letters and numbers on its road grays along with the navy blue and white sleeve trim, Uni Watch reported Tuesday.\n\nThe changes would return the Yankees’ road jerseys to look more like they did prior to 1973, when the organization added the white outline around “NEW YORK” and around the numbers on the back.\n\nKnown for their classic style and minimal changes, the Yankees’ uniforms have had other small tweaks in recent years: adding the Nike swoosh to the chest of their jerseys in 2020 and a Starr Insurance patch to their sleeves in 2023.\n\nThey also shortened the space between “NEW” and “YORK” on their road jerseys in 2016, per Uni Watch.\n\nThe Yankees won’t have to wait long to debut the new look, as they open the season on the road against the Astros at Minute Maid Park on March 28.\n\nWhile other organizations have undergone their fair share of uniform changes over the years, the Yankees have largely stood pat.\n\nMost teams also have at least one alternate jersey, but the Yankees have stuck to just their home and road uniforms.\n\nThe only time in recent years they have worn something else during the regular season was for the MLB Players Weekend from 2017-19 and when they wore throwbacks — essentially what the tweaked uniforms will look like — for the “Field of Dreams” game in 2021."
