Starr has been a partner of the Yankees since 2018 and will retain its existing billboard signage above the right-field bleachers as part of the extension.\n\nComment:\n\n“Having had Starr as an insurance carrier of ours for the last decade and having worked closely with their leadership team as part of our preestablished partnership, it is clear that Starr is the right company to embark with on this landmark relationship,” said Hal Steinbrenner, New York Yankees managing general partner.\n\n“There were many aspects of Starr that aligned with our organisation, including their century-plus history, significant New York presence, worldwide reach and unparalleled commitment to the community.”\n\nComing next:\n\nThe Starr Insurance logo will debut on the Yankees’ uniform on 21st July."
