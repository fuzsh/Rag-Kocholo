The New York Yankees, one of the most hallowed organizations in all of sports, are changing up their classing uniforms.

Coming on July 21, the Yankees will be the latest team to add a uniform sponsor to their look: Starr Insurance.

Sports Uniform expert Paul Lukas says the Yankees are the 13th team in baseball to have a uniform sponsor, with others surely to come.

You can see the pictures of the uniform within the confines of the tweet below from the team.

Per a release:

Building on the successful partnership that the two organizations have had since 2018, this exclusive agreement extends through the 2031 season.

As part of the expanded relationship, Starr will continue as the Official Commercial Insurance Company of the New York Yankees and become the team’s first jersey patch partner, with the Starr Insurance logo debuting on Yankees uniforms on July 21. Additionally, Starr signage will be placed on the Yankee Stadium outfield wall in front of both the home and visiting team bullpens, complementing Starr’s existing billboard signage above the right-field bleachers. Starr will also become the Official Presenting Sponsor of the Yankees’ game-day lineup post on social media and will work closely with the New York Yankees Foundation on upcoming community initiatives in the New York metropolitan area.

This is just this writer's opinion, but this is gross. While I'm all for making money, and I understand teams need to be money-making entities, the New York Yankees need to be above this. The Yankees uniform look has been so classic that the team has yet to put player names on jerseys, and have yet to add an alternate uniform, but they'll do this?
