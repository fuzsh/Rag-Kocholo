It wouldn’t take long until the heads of DC and Marvel recognized his immense talent, quickly putting him to work.\n\nAfter penciling John Carter, Warlord of Mars #18, Miller saw opportunity knocking at the door with the blind superhero Daredevil.\n\nFrank’s Daredevil debut was with Daredevil #158, which he only illustrated. Starting with Daredevil #168, Frank was supplying both art and scripts, causing a meteoric rise in sales of the once struggling title.\n\nFrank’s last issue from this time period was Daredevil #191. He would return to Daredevil sporadically over the years.\n\nIn 1986, Miller cemented his legacy with Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, a gritty and dark tale of an aged Batman who returns to crime fighting.\n\nReleased around the same time as Watchmen, Dark Knight Returns adult-oriented themes helped transform the comic industry. Later, Frank followed Dark Knight Returns with Batman: Year One.\n\nIn the 90s, Miller worked mostly for Dark Horse Comics, creating 300 and Sin City. He also continued to work on Daredevil and Batman titles, including Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again."
