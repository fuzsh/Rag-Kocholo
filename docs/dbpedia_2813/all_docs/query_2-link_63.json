        "text": "Post by brutalis on\n\nCould also be one of those \"you had to be there\" at the time. Miller's DD was an amazing \"new\" look after all the years of \"sameness\" the series endured and was stagnating from IMOP. Miller brought in new ideas and his art quickly took Hornhead into becoming more a creature of the night (like Batman) prowling and hunting the somber streets of the city. With Janson on inks Miller's art improved quickly and became all the more stylized and \"noirish\" as well. Add in the ninja's and making Bullseye into an even stronger villain and then Kingpin comes along. Goooooood stuff. Hang in there and read more....\n\nPost by brianf on\n\nreading comics in the 70's I was never a fan of Daredevil, until miller came around.\n\nI think the first miller drawn issue I picked up was #161 (vs bullseye on the roller coaster) and the art just popped.\n\nbut #163 sold me - DD vs the Hulk - such a cool issue!\n\nWhen miller took over scripting and got more funky with his use of shadows and other visual goodies, I remember having to re-read the issues a few times to really get it.\n\nhis work on those DD issues really opened my eyes to a different way to see comic art.\n\nI'm still a fan of his original DD run, 100%\n\nToo bad everything I've read by him in the last 10-15 years has been bad, it's like the tank ran dry.\n\nPost by shaxper on\n\nAh, so it's mostly the art and the tone. I definitely see those things working, but I'm still waiting to get invested in the characters. When Daredevil and Elektra are crying over each other in #168, the art is gorgeous, but I'm not invested yet. The flashback Miller gave them wasn't enough to make me long for the past they were suddenly trapped by. I really hope to see that improve in the following issues.\n\nBut yes, the art and style are impressive. I just tend to see those qualities as icing on the proverbial comic book cake, as opposed to chief ingredients that I crave in a story.\n\nPost by shaxper on\n\nDid you start with #168, or some point earlier?\n\nPersonally, I'd recommend starting right from Miller's first issue as artist, #158, or if it bothers you that that's the conclusion of a longer story, #159 - when Roger McKenzie was still scripting the series. I know there's a bunch of purists who claimed that DD only got good when Miller took over as writer, but I think those initial 10 or so issues written by McKenzie are quite good, and they set the stage for what came later. By the time #168 rolled around I was deeply committed to the series.\n\nI have and read #161 and #162. #161 has extremely different characterizations for Turk and his employer from what comes later on. #162 was a filler issue (though a decent one). What I have after that is the Elektra arc and (much later on) Born Again, so that's what I am reading.\n\nPost by codystarbuck on\n\nI read and enjoyed much of Marv Wolfman's run, which still had the swashbuckling daredevil and introduced Bullseye. I also enjoyed the Gil Kane and Jim Shooter co-plotted run on Daredevil, with Heather Glen's father manipulated by The Purple Man. It does much to add a darker edge to DD, which foreshadows some of Miller. It also has Heather learning Matt Murdock's secret, as Daredevil.\n\nI find that Miller evolves as he goes along and that Roger MacKenzie helps plant those seeds. The first Elektra issue is actually a deliberate homage to the Spirit story Sand Saref. It really does take her return to get you invested, as you see how DD reacts to her amorality and how it affects her relationship to the Kingpin. It kaes the overall arc to fully appreciate it.\n\nThat said, not all of Miller's material is as good. Some issues are better than others and the background subplots are more interesting than the main plot of some issues. I'm not so high on Miller's end sequence, with the theft of Elektra's body and possible revival, via The Hand.\n\nWhile I enjoyed Miller's work, I hated how everyone that followed kept it that dark world and forgot all about the wisecracking, swashbuckling Daredevil. Even Miller had him crack jokes, now and then. Batman had similar problems, after Dark Knight and Year One. I really missed the Batman of the Bronze Age, who occasionally smiled.\n\nOne thing that does get glossed over is how much Josef Rubinstein and Klaus Janson added to Miller's art. A lot of hat people attributed to Miller came in the inking/finishing stage.\n\nAlso worth checking out is the black & white Elektra story from Marvel Preview/Bizarre Adventures #28 (the book was retitled BA, with issue 25, after using that as a theme title in Marvel preview #20 and 23). That was recolored and included in the Frank Miller Daredevil and in The Elektra Saga, which reprinted the Elektra components of the Daredevil series, in a 4-issue mini-series."
