I agree it is really underrated, it is an epic story, well told, that introduces major changes for the character, some of which are done so subtly that even today writers seem to tread daintily around them so they don't ruin what Miller did.\n\nIt is a story that just screams to be made into a movie - but then you need back story for it to work as well as it does.\n\nIf choosing my all time top ten story arcs/graphic novels it would be definitely in there.\n\niansales\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nMay 8, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n3,447\n\nJan 22, 2012\n\n#3\n\nAfter Miller's recent meltdown, I've no desire to read anything written by him. Some things writers should keep to themselves...\n\nBrian G Turner\n\nFantasist & Futurist\n\nJoined\n\nNov 23, 2002\n\nMessages\n\n26,569\n\nLocation\n\nUK\n\nJan 23, 2012\n\n#4\n\nBatman: Dark Knight Returns and Daredevil: Born Again I think show Miller at his peak. Not surprising that they are both early works from the 1980's.\n\nIn the early 1990's I read Hard Boiled and found it irrelevant and gratuitous, and Give Me Liberty, which was fairly standard comic fare.\n\nThe films Sin City and 300 I found to be homo-erotic machoistic crap."
