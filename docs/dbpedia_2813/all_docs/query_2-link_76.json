        "text": "May 1, 2011\n\nFifteen years ago, Frank Miller blazed onto the Batscene with THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, an important work that not only brought new life to an aging and retired Bruce Wayne but also forced the comic book industry to grow up ... and, consequently, he reinvigorated the industry to the level of an art form.\n\nFifteen years later, methinks Frank has lost his mind.\n\nThe first installment of THE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN was gratuitous in its portrayal of violence for the sake of violence, but, in this second issue (of three), the ensuing chaos surrounding Batman's return from a self-imposed retirement (once more) is nothing but stupid silliness. The tale focuses on the return of not just the Bats but an entire slew of superheroes ... who've been where? While he chooses not to tell us EXACTLY, he does hint that the world has become a kinder, gentler place under the totalitarian reign of Superman.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if Frank's reputation emerges from this outing unscathed. One would think it ironic that the same character who really put Frank Miller on the cultural map might very well be the same character that puts the nail in his coffin.\n\nTHE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN #2 is to be avoided ... at all costs.\n\nMay 20, 2012\n\n\"Segunda parte de DK2 que no pienso leer hasta no conseguir el tomo 3. Si pude esperar 9 años, ¿qué es un tiempito más hasta dar con el dichoso tomo, no? Cuando lo lea íntegro, seguro se gane su correspondiente reseña.\" decía entonces. Ahora que sí tengo los tres números, no me animo a ponerme con el tercero por miedo a que la decepción sea mayor que con este. ¿Qué decir de un comic de Batman cuya mejor escena es un garche estratosférico entre Superman y Wonder Woman? El dibujo me sigue gustando, aunque acá se pasa de caricaturesco, pero si es para narrar una historia que va en contramano todo el trayecto, no sirve de mucho. Y el coloreado... Ay, ese coloreado. Qué lástima que Miller y Varley no se hayan divorciado antes de engendrar este collage que me hizo sangrar los ojos... En fin, cuando me mande al tercero blablablá...\n\nJuly 12, 2015\n\nEasily the worst graphic novel I've ever read, not a hyperbole, not an exaggeration . Volume on was bad, but volume two sinks even deeper. The art work is still painfully awful, like a shitty Andy Warhol painting. Nothing makes sense, no in an \"Oh, it's just complicated and you're too stupid to understand\" but in a \"What the fuck is happening, I literally cannot make out what is going on because the art is so bad and disorganized and the story is complete shit.\" Brainiac comes in, because why not, and Superman is still wrecked from getting his ass handed to him by Batman last earlier, but Batman is keeping out of the spotlight and making some kind of shady alliance with some of the characters, I honestly can't even tell which ones. I'm not even sure that Batman is the \"good guy\" anymore. Not in an existential way, but again in a \"Seriously, what the hell is happening; I know even less page-by-page.\" Also, Wonder Woman and Superman have a grown child? The terrible inter-cutting of news reports and interviews returns and it is just awful. I can't emphasis enough how bad everything is. Maybe it's just personal preference, but I found DKSA V2 unforgivably bad. Of course I hated Dark Knight Returns, but this takes everything I hated about that and amplifies it to the Nth degree. Even the artwork of the characters is so bad that you can't always tell who they are supposed to be. They introduce Martian Manhunter and I thought for sure it had to be Solomon Grundy or maybe like a really sick Killer Croc. Terrible, just awful.\n\nAugust 3, 2024\n\nI like the story well enough, as it is typical of Miller's frenetic pacing and verve, but the art is distracting. Not quite as detailed as Miller's earlier work, the art ventures into the abstract and nearly beyond into absurdism. Perhaps the absurd and abstract is the end goal, but as a sequel to Dark Knight Returns, this series falls somewhat short so far. I don't dislike the story, nor do I find it exceptional. I appreciate Miller as an artist, but this story is not a classic like some of his other works. Recommended for dedicated Miller fans.\n\nRead\n\nJuly 3, 2023\n\nBad\n\nFrank's dark knight art was stylistic and subpar but the story was able to excuse it. This piece of shit has both terrible writting and unexcusibly amature third grade level art. Skip this one.\n\nNovember 23, 2022\n\nStory 4\n\nArt 2\n\n3.49 stars\n\nGreat action packed story, wish it was at least on the level of the original TDKR\n\nApril 19, 2013\n\n(Re-reading) This is the eagerly-awaited sequel to the dark knight story. I found it entertaining with occasional good ideas but too steeped in easy politics and flashy visuals for my (admitedly older) tastes.\n\nMay 19, 2014\n\nThe story is starting to get better than volume 1. Still the story doesn't quite connect with me. The artwork seems rushed, the coloring is not very good, and the story seems forced together. Going to finish volume 3 and see how this all wraps up.\n\nSeptember 6, 2014\n\nNot sure why Batman didn't kill Luthor when he had the chance rather than marking his face with a \"Z\" ...\n\nJuly 15, 2016\n\nOdotin enemmän. Nyt meni melkein Miller-parodian puolelle eikä tietokoneella tehdyt sivut oikein toimineet.\n\nMay 1, 2018\n\nMe ha gustado incluso más que el anterior, es todo como ¡vamos equipo! ¡a por ellos!\n\nLo que si que me ha parecido vastante malillo es el estilo de dibujo."
