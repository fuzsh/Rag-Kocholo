        "text": "The art of creating comic books and the craft of making films are very much dependent on range of trades to complete a finished work. Creating a comic book, like making a motion picture, is ultimately about telling a story. The nature of the comic book and motion picture industry puts a certain amount of pressure on an author of a work to see his or her vision though to the end of production. Comic books like the motion picture medium require many roles to complete a project. Simply look at the title pages on any comic book and you see credits for a writer, penciler, inker, colorist, letterer, editor and editor and chief. The same can be understood as you watch the credits roll at the end of a movie. There are many roles to play in the final production of such works. But there are a few authors in the profession of comic books and in film making that have made a point to control the process by establishing close visionary relationships with collaborators in this process.\n\nWill Eisner, considered a founding father of comic art had noted. “The comic book form has suffered greatly because the discipline has been broken into an assembly line process. The best work is done by one author”.\n\nFrank Miller, a student of Will Eisner, has taken this idea to heart in his own professional work in the comic book industry. Miller like Eisner is at his best both an author and an artist. This has allowed him to explore his own vision of what the comic book medium can produce. Utilizing the franchised characters in the big two publishers, Marvel and DC, Miller was able to establish a popular fan base and eventually transform the medium. Collaborating with ground breaking artists in the field allowed Miller to explore and expand the traditional art of comic book story telling. Very few artists in the field are able to comment on pop culture, social morality and politics as Miller has. When he found the industry codes to confining to his vision, he had the distinction to move to the independent publishers to explore new ground breaking work. As an artist Frank Miller is always looking in new directions for storytelling and by its very nature film making has become his most recent pursuit. As film director Miller will face many challenges in defining his own authorship throughout the process. His success will be found in continuing his close collaboration efforts with artists in the field that can share his vision and produce a signature work.\n\nExhibited Titles:\n\nEisner / Miller: a one on one interview by Charles Brownstein (Dark Horse Books) (2005)\n\nAmazing Heroes #69 (Fantagraphics) (1982)\n\nAmazing Heroes #99 (Fantagraphics) (1982)\n\nAmazing Heroes #102 (Fantagraphics) (1982)\n\nBatman: Black and White #2 (DC Comics) (1995)\n\nCaptain America #241 (Marvel Comics) (1968)\n\nCaptain America #255 (Marvel Comics) (1968)\n\nComics Interview #2 (1983)\n\nIncredible Hulk #268 (Marvel Comics) (1962)\n\nMarvel Fanfare #18 (Marvel Comics) (1982)\n\nMarvel Team-Up #100 (Marvel Comics) (1972)\n\nPower Man and Iron Fist #74 (Marvel Comics) (1972)\n\nSpectacular Spider-Man #60 (Marvel Comics) (1976)\n\nSpider-Woman #32 (Marvel Comics) (1978)\n\nStar Trek #5 (Marvel Comics) (1980)\n\nDaredevil #158 May 1979 was Frank Miller’s first work on a commercial series with Marvel comics. It was as the time a low selling title and was given to the new talent in the industry.\n\nFrank Miller originally co-authored Daredevil with Roger McKenzie. Later Miller took over writing chores and the title took off in sales. One of the features attributed to this rise in readership was the introduction of a strong female character Elektra in Daredevil #168. Aside from the established character of Wonder Woman most female roles in comics were illustrated as mother figures or sexual objects. Elektra had a unique appeal as being both sexual and heroic. Something not really explored before in the comic medium.\n\nFrank Miller collaborated very closely with some key artists over time to create a signature style. Klaus Jansen inked most of Frank Miller’s layouts in during his run on Daredevil. The heavy black lines of ink Klaus Jansen used to embellish Frank Millers ground breaking layouts became a signature of his work throughout his career.\n\nAnother artist Frank Miller collaborated with on the Daredevil series was David Mazzuchelli. The Born Again story arc in Daredevil #227 – 233 written by Miller, pushes the main characters to the point of breaking down then finding resolution and redemption. This tension is exaggerated by Mazzuchelli’s sinuous inks. As the pressure builds in the story, the characters physically take on an abstraction of emotion. An interesting example involves a page of panels that display a rich background of dialog and actions, as the tension builds for the central character the next panel noise seems to drop off to silence and the focus is drawn in to close up facial expression in reaction what is going on off screen. The cinematic elements are clearly displayed in this sequence of panels in the comic book.\n\nExhibited Titles:\n\nDaredevil # 178-191, 227-233 (Marvel Comics) (1964)\n\nFrank Miller along with Chris Claremont penciled and co-authored the 4 issue limited series Wolverine (1982) for Marvel Comics. This spinoff of the popular character Wolverine from the Uncanny X-Men title allowed Frank Miller to explore his interest in foreign comics. In this case Manga representing Feudal Japan, and the discipline of the Ronin or masterless Samurai.\n\nRonin was Frank Miller’s first author owned creation for DC Comics. It ran as a six issue mini-series for DC Comics (1983). It was his first artistic collaborative effort with Lynn Varley who inked and colored this work. This mini-series was printed on a higher quality prestige format paper allowing the artist to express the details of line ink and painterly coloring in a way not previously explored.\n\n“Almost everything about the Ronin will be different from my previous work. I’m exploring brand new ground. That sort of concept is the very thing that turns me on and gets me very involved, but the overall look of Ronin is much less stark and much more textural. Because of the way it’s being printed and the way it’s being covered. I’ve developed a different way to render it. A different way to approach it. This is getting the finest production that you can get. Consequently everything from writing to the art to the coloring has to be changed radically to accommodate it. It’s as if I’m doing bw tv movies and all of a sudden I’m doing full color films. “ -Frank Miller Comics Feature #25 (1983).\n\nIn this comic book the color has as much of an expressive meaning as the language throughout the work. Further, dialog and wording are major elements in controlling pace. Breakdowns and page layouts are profound departures from Miller’s previous work. Double page horizontal panels, vertical panels, one panel over a double page layout are just a few of the techniques that Miller uses to punctuate his signature style.\n\nExhibited Titles:\n\nLone Wolf and Cub # 1-6 (First Comics) (1987)\n\nRonin # 1-6 (DC Comics) (1984)\n\nWolverine #1-4 (Marvel Comics) (1982)\n\nElektra Lives Again (1990) was a graphic novel published by Epic, a mature audience subsidiary of Marvel Comics. This work was written and drawn by Frank Miller and colored by Lynn Varley. This graphic novel doesn’t really resurrect the mysterious character Elektra for some wild new team-up adventure, rather it awakens her spirit in Matt Murdock’s (Daredevil’s) dreams. This is a very hallucinary tale of haunting dreams. Defying what is real or not in Matt Murdock’s past. Miller’s meticulous draftsmanship is perfectly complimented by Lynn Varley’s washed out grey and blood red water coloring. Miller notes:\n\n“Working with Lynn Varley, particularly on the Elektra book, my lines are so vastly amplified and reinterpreted that the book is much more defined as a horror story than it would have been. Lynn gave the art in Elektra Lives Again its lightning, its temp, its tone. I’m touching up the script to take advantage of her work. “ – Comics Interview #82 (1983).\n\nElektra Assassin (1986) was co-authored with artist Bill Sienkiewicz . Up until this Limited Series, Frank Miller had collaborated with artists that gave his books a signature style or look. This work, along with the graphic novel Daredevil: Love and War (1986), was the first time Miller collaborated with an artist and allowed him the freedom to interpret his authorship in a radically new artistic direction. This level of trust would take the art of the book into an abstract almost surreal direction. Sienkiewicz explored the exaggerated presence of characters. Frank Millers use of multiple narrative voices as a mechanism to introduce characters by impression or action is as if he was directing a movie. Elektra Assassin is an expressive painted art comic book. Radical at the time, it allowed the artist Bill Sienkiewicz to freely run with Miller’s over the top Elektra story line of corrupt politics, double agents and ninja assassins.\n\nExhibited Titles:\n\nDaredevil : Love and War by: Frank Miller Bill Sienkiewicz (Marvel Comics Graphic Novel) (1986)\n\nElektra Lives Again by: Frank Miller (Epic Comics Hardcover) (1991)\n\nElektra Assassin # 1-8 (Epic Comics) (1986)\n\nBatman: The Dark Knight Returns (1986) tells the story of a 55 year old Batman who has come back to fight crime in violent urban future. The four issue limited series from DC comics was printed in the “prestige format” square bound on heavy stock paper rather than news print. This format perfectly represented Miller’s pencils, Klaus Janson‘s use of heavy ink lines that defined dramatic positive and negative space, as well as Lynn Varley’s dark and rich color palate. Miller organizes great chunks of running narration throughout the book emitting from television screens in panel layouts. These talking head segments appear to inform the reader with real time news and events yet at the same time advance the storyline with subtle commentary. Miller’s work can be described as highly cinematic with the ability to juxtapose simultaneous events within the context of one frame in an overall layout on the comic book page. Batman : the Dark Knight Returns remains one of the most popular works of the author and demonstrates his long term commitment to collaboration with artists that illustrate his signature style.\n\nBatman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again (2001) had been a standing offer from DC since the success of Batman: The Dark Knight Returns. Published again in the prestige format Miller once again took the helm to write, draw, ink and work with long time collaborator Lynn Varley as colorist. Miller and initially approached this project as satirical, reinterpreting various characters by the nature of their powers and how they affect their personal lives. Working with these trademark characters owned by DC is a way of playing with pop culture. Exploring relationships, interests, politics, etc., were considered a humorous parody of what the readers expected from these characters. However, there is also a contradictory nature in this book which can be attributed to the September 11 attacks in 2001. Living in New York City at the time of writing this book FM recalls,\n\n“And then 9/11 happened, and I had just run a flying Bat mobile into a skyscraper and blowup downtown metropolis.” “Well I couldn’t keep going without addressing it. So I had to stop the story and make it take a darker tone. Somehow, I found that in a certain way, dramatically, the darker you get the funnier you get, because after a while you have to laugh”. – Comics Journal Library Frank Miller Interviews #6 (2003).\n\nExhibited Titles:\n\nBatman: The Dark Knight Returns #1-4 (DC Comics) (1986)\n\nBatman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again #1-3(DC Comics) (2001)\n\nComics Interview #31 (1983)\n\nAfter the success of The Dark Knight Series at DC Comics Frank Miller was looking for a creative change in direction. It was clear that over time Hollywood was becoming more and more interested in the comic book medium for source material on screen. When the producer of RoboCop 2 , Jon Davidson called Miller it was clear he had recently seen his work on The Dark Knight and wanted that cynical view of violence and nature in this story. Frank Miller was initially interested in the project and the similarity of RoboCop and the character of Frankenstein. Though frustrated by the amount of re-writes, Miller was invited to work on set as the production was filming to make changes to the screenplay. As Miller notes “The Screenplay is the most scrutinized piece of writing I’ve ever done.” The millions of dollars at stake require a collaborative effort from director, writer and actor. There must be a comfort in collaboration to make a work successful. Ultimately the final script penned by Miller vaguely resembled his first draft of the work and upon release was a critical flop at the box office. Miller was not happy with this outcome and criticized the studio as interfering with his vision of the script.\n\nWilliam Christensen the publisher of Avatar Press had eventually acquired the lost screenplay of Frank Miller’s RoboCop 2. Miller agreed to have this work published and collaborated with Steven Grant to write the comic book adaption and Juan Jose Ryp to illustrate the book. Frank Miller did the cover art for the nine issue series running from July 2003 to March 2004.\n\nExhibited Titles:\n\nFrank Miller RoboCop # 1-9 (Avatar Press) (2003)\n\nComics Interview #82 (1983)\n\nRoboCop 2 directed by: Irvin Kershner (MGM Home Video DVD) (2004)\n\nIn the early 1990’s Frank Miller decided to take control of his own properties and release work through the publishing house Dark Horse Comics. Miller’s next project, Sin City, premiered in Dark Horse Presents #51 (1991) and was subsequently collected in a trade paperback titled The Hard Goodbye in 2005. For the first time Miller was able to explore new narrative techniques without being bound by the conventional narrative requirements and editorial restrictions of the traditional superhero characters he worked on for Marvel and DC. Not since Ronin, has Frank Miller explored such expressionistic territory on his own. Sin City is a very personal work and demonstrates how the artist explores new techniques to express the narrative.\n\nThe stark black and white imagery clearly reflects the film noir elements of crime drama. This dark and brooding technique visually carries the narrative along. Many panels are wordless because they clearly express the author’s intention. Some panels are very simple, as though something has been left out of the frame. Miller allows the reader to fill in the empty spaces making for a more complex experience. Deep shadows blanket the pages while certain defined characters and objects are highlighted by single light source. Later in the Sin City series of books we find Miller reversing the darkness into light, bathing the page in white hot backgrounds where characters are just silhouettes. Toward the end of the series we find Lynn Varley’s contribution of color adding yet another punctuation to the expressively dark work.\n\nAfter Frank Miller’s frustration with Hollywood system making the movie Robocop 2 it would be hard to believe he would accept the challenge again. It wasn’t until Robert Rodriguez asked him to co-direct an adaption of Sin City for the screen that he again showed interest. Rodriguez, a big fan of Miller’s work, shot a proof of concept short to show how he could produce a translation of his work, following the source material as close as possible. Rodriguez was inspired by the visual layouts of Miller’s Sin City books. The film is based on three of Miller’s works: The Hard Goodbye 1991, The Big Fat Kill 1995, and That Yellow Bastard 1996. Rodriguez wanted to work directly from the comic book panels as storyboards for the motion picture. He understood the photographic qualities of lighting and effects and was able to produce the look and feel of the world of Sin City on film. The inks of Miller’s comic book work literally jumps off the screen in this collaboration. The shadow and light play Miller used so effectively in the Comic Book is genuinely stunning on screen. The film was released in 2005 to critical attention.\n\nExhibited Titles:\n\nSin City That Yellow Bastard #1-6 (Dark Horse Comics) (1996)\n\nSin City The Big Fat Kill # 1-5 (Dark Horse Comics) (1994)\n\nA Dame To Kill For: A Tale From Sin City by: Frank Miller (Dark Horse Comics Trade Paperback) (1995)\n\nFrank Milller: The Art of Sin City by: Diana Schultz (Dark Horse Books Hardcover) (2002)\n\nFrank Miller’s Sin City: The Making of the Movie by: Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez (Trouble Maker Publishers) (2005)\n\nSin City: Recut Extended Unrated directed by: Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller (Mirimax Lionsgate DVD) (2011)\n\nThe 300 Spartans referrers to the ancient battle of Thermopylae, where 300 outnumbered Spartans held off the Persian army in 480 B.C . Frank Miller’s interest in this story can be attributed to the values and honor he had explored in stories of the Samurai in ancient feudal Japan. Working once again with longtime collaborator Lynn Varley , Miller wrote on this five part limited series for Dark Horse Comics beginning in May of 1998. Miller took a unique approach to layouts using both the left and right pages folded open as one large canvas to work with. The work can be seen as mimicking a wide screen motion picture lens. Carefully composing each panel as he would direct each shot, characters have a bold relief to them. This deliberate line quality is complimented by Lynn Varley’s use of red accents and cepia tone that grounds the work in ancient times, like an old photograph.\n\nDirector Zack Snyder was also a fan of Frank Miller’s work and insisted on working with the author in faithfully translating his work from page to screen. Frank Miller was retained as consultant and executive producer of the film. The pages of 300 are as much a work of art as a template for which the director calls upon to bring this motion picture to life. Many months went by shooting on blue and green screen sets. Snyder had recruited numerous animators, designers and technicians to capture the tone and essence of Miller’s work. Again, through close collaborative efforts, Frank Miller has been able to guide the process and successfully translate the original vision of the book to the motion picture screen. The film was released 2007 to highly critical praise.\n\nExhibited Titles:\n\n300 # 1-5 (Dark Horse Comics) (1998)\n\n300 by: Frank Miller, Lynn Varley (Dark Horse Books Hardcover) (1999)\n\n300: the art of the film by: Tara DiLullo, Zack Snyder (Dark Horse Books Hardcover) (2007)\n\n300 directed by: Zack Snyder (Warner Home Video DVD) ( 2008)"
