        "text": "\"To be an artist is to speak your truth as loudly as you can.\" Picturehouse has revealed an official trailer for a documentary film titled Frank Miller: American Genius, opening soon. This film originally premiered back in 2021 at the Rome Film Festival but has laid low since then. Now it's finally out in June - playing at Cinemark theaters one night. \"My life has been driven by a relentless passion for drawing and storytelling, and it's also led to incredible friendships and experiences along the way,\" states Frank Miller (creator of Daredevil: Born Again, The Dark Knight Returns, Batman: Year One, Sin City, 300). \"Sharing this passion with the fans is what matters most and that’s why I’m incredibly excited to bring this film to audiences all across the nation in June.\" Frank Miller: American Genius explores the near half-century career of Frank Miller, the legendary comic book artist and writer, and features interviews and cameos from his admirers, students, and collaborators, including Neal Adams, Robert Rodriguez, Jessica Alba, Jim Lee, Zack Snyder, Stan Lee, and more. It's produced, written and directed by Silenn Thomas for Frank Miller Ink. Check it out.\n\nHere's the trailer (+ poster) for Silenn Thomas's doc Frank Miller: American Genius, from YouTube:"
