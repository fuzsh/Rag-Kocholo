        "text": "Written By: Bob Miller\n\nLast month, I wrote about creating a healthy environment in your home for your family and pets by using products made from American Hardwoods. This month I will explain why these products come from one of the most sustainable and environmentally friendly resources.\n\nHardwood forests are prevalent in every state, in the U.S. mainland. However, the eastern half of the U.S. grows the majority of hardwoods. This region extends from Minnesota down to Texas, all the way over to Florida, up to Maine, and all states in between.\n\nThe hardwood forests in the U.S. are very sustainable. Sustainability occurs when there is an ecological balance when a resource is removed yet that resource is not being depleted for future generations. Each year we have more growth in our forests than what is removed through timber harvests. The American Hardwood Export Council has done an excellent job representing the U.S. Forest Service, Department of Agriculture’s data, by state. Indiana is growing almost twice the volume than is harvested. The U.S. is growing two and a half times more volume than is harvested. Refer to www.americanhardwood.org/environmental-profile/interactive-forest-map to see this data.\n\nHardwood forests and the products manufactured from the hardwood trees are environmentally friendly. Hardwood trees are constantly consuming carbon dioxide (CO2) to assist with the production of a glucose substance that trees use as food. The tree will break the carbon dioxide compound down, utilizing the carbon molecule to produce the glucose substance, and emit the oxygen molecules into the atmosphere. Carbon is a greenhouse gas that negatively impacts the environment; therefore, trees are essentially improving our world.\n\nHardwood trees have a life cycle, and that life cycle is dependent on the tree species. Typically, most tree species can live to be approximately 150 years old. Disease (viruses and fungi), weather (lightning and wind), fire, or insect infestations will eventually take the life of the tree. When a tree dies and begins decomposing in the forest, it will release the unused carbon back into the atmosphere, further contributing to negatively impacting our environment. Forest management is the practice where timber, wildlife, and plant life are managed to maintain or improve the overall forest ecosystem. When a tree is at the end of its life cycle, it will be harvested to open the canopy to get sunlight to the forest floor. Tree saplings grow close to the forest floor and need sunlight to grow. Sunlight gives saplings the opportunity to become bigger trees.\n\nThe tree that was harvested in the prior example will also produce income to the landowner since it has value to the lumber industry. The value in that tree will disappear once the tree falls and begins to decompose in the forest. In addition, forest management creates jobs. Jobs are created when the trees are manufactured into lumber, and when that lumber is utilized to manufacture furniture, flooring, cabinetry, and millwork. In 2016, an economic impact study was completed that showed the economic output of the hardwood industry in Indiana was over $10 billion and that industry employed over 61,000 people. Refer to http://hardwoodfederation.com/Hardwood-Industry-Economic-Impact to see this data.\n\nLet us circle back to the carbon stored in the tree, which is now in the lumber that was used to produce the furniture, flooring, cabinetry, and millwork. That carbon will always be stored in those products while those products are in use. Did you know 50% of the wood’s weight in the furniture, flooring, cabinetry, and millwork is the stored carbon? Be a part of positively impacting our environment by purchasing products made from American Hardwoods.\n\nWe have been blessed with a sustainable and environmentally friendly resource when it comes to the hardwood forests in the U.S. Forest management will keep our forests healthy, reduce our carbon emissions, and improve the forest ecosystems. The products manufactured from these trees are beautiful, resilient, environmentally friendly, and can be enjoyed for generations.\n\nWritten By: Bob Miller – Director of Strategic Planning (Photo Credit: Wendy Silverstein)\n\nThe pandemic has changed our lives dramatically. More people are working at home in spare rooms functioning as office space, hybrid school models have turned dining rooms into classrooms, and for many, vacations are being spent grilling, chilling, and playing in the back yard. All this at-home time has led to a home remodeling frenzy.\n\nAnd just like the rest of the world, my wife and I are looking to upgrade many of the rooms in our home – from the features and materials to the room’s functionality. We have determined our number one priority is the health of our family – just how healthy and environmentally sound are the product choices we make?\n\nAlthough cost is important, we will not sacrifice our health, or the health of the environment for a less expensive product.\n\nI am sure you are asking yourself; what products are unhealthy choices for my family, which also includes my pets? First consider floor coverings. Hardwood floors do not emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs), they do not trap allergens, or contain unwanted chemicals. Hardwoods are essentially organic! Other flooring options trap mold which enhances allergies, emit VOCs, and require harsh cleaning solutions to maintain. It is important to do your own research on the many flooring options before making the purchase. Do not limit your research – become knowledgeable about the adhesives used to install the product, as well as any underlayment/moisture barrier materials. Choose low-VOC or no-VOC products for the health and well-being of your family!\n\nAs a family member of Frank Miller Lumber Company, I have grown-up surrounded by hardwood products in both my home and work environment. I love the warmth and beauty of hardwoods in my home, and I enjoy the calming environment it creates in our offices.\n\nI have found great information to help me with my healthy material choice selections on the internet and through various social media sources. Visit www.HardwoodInfo.com specifically https://www.hardwoodinfo.com/consumer/treasured-for-generations/creating-a-naturally-healthy-home/ ) to learn more about the benefits of using Real American Hardwood products. You can search Instagram and Facebook for #RealAmericanHardwood and #AmericanHardwoods to find many home remodeling ideas. Your family will thank you and so will Mother Earth!\n\nYou can be confident knowing American hardwood products are one of the healthiest material choices for flooring, cabinetry, millwork, and furniture. They are extremely easy to maintain and will last for generations. Next month, I’ll explain why they are also one of the most environmentally friendly resources.\n\nAre you concerned about our climate? This is what Frank Miller Lumber is doing to ease your concerns.\n\nMost people have heard trees are the best asset when it comes to protecting our environment from changes in the climate. Climate change is often debated. Some say we are not experiencing a change in our climate and that we are going through historical weather cycles we once experienced; others tend to say the opposite. Regardless of your position on climate change, maintaining healthy forests is key to improving the world we live in. Trees consume carbon dioxide to convert that compound into a food source for the tree. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. As trees consume and convert this compound using the carbon to help create its food, the trees respire the oxygen molecules for us to breath.\n\nTrees have a life cycle.\n\nA life cycle is nothing more than the number of years something is expected to live, be present, or exist before it dies, decomposes, or breaks down. Through forest management, we remove the trees that are close to the end of their life cycle. These trees will be manufactured into lumber to produce furniture, flooring, cabinetry, and millwork. Better yet, you remember the carbon in these trees. This carbon will be stored in these products indefinitely as long as these products are in use. If a tree falls over and decomposes in the forest, it will release the unused carbon that it once stored. That carbon will go back into the atmosphere.\n\nNot only do trees help us by taking a greenhouse gas out of the atmosphere and provide us with oxygen, but did you know trees are also a renewable resource? A renewable resource is anything that can replenish itself. So, when forest management is performed where trees are removed, new trees will grow from the stumps and root systems that remain in the forest.\n\nOur nation has been truly blessed with some of the best forests in the world. For these forests to be enjoyed on into the future and for us to have a better environment to live in, we must understand that forest management is essential in these forests.\n\nLearn more about FSC-certified Hardwood.\n\nSince the dawn of time, humans have argued over a very pressing issue: hardwood or carpet flooring? The debate continues to this day – some will praise the comfort a carpet provides while others prefer the more polished look of hardwood floors. But we hold a firm belief that, no matter what, hardwood floors are the way to go. Below is a list of reasons why you should consider hardwood flooring exposed.\n\n1. Hardwood floors are easier to clean and maintain.\n\nCarpets are prone to holding dust, skin, and hair. To get rid of these stomach-churning particles, you’ll need to vacuum. If you want them eliminated almost entirely, professional carpet cleaning services might be necessary. Luckily, hardwood floors don’t hold on to these particles. A quick sweep or mop will do the trick to keep your floor clean. We also all know the dreaded feeling of spilling a drink on carpet – it’s nearly impossible to get rid of the whole stain unless you call in professional Carpet Cleaning Melbourne or any other place for that matter. With hardwood floors, just grab a paper towel or rag, and you’re good!\n\n2. Hardwood floors are more durable and longer lasting.\n\nAs long as your hardwood floor is properly maintained, it can last for decades. Even a dent in the floor can be alleviated easily with a minor repair. They can be refined and polished to keep fresh and clean. Hardwood floors also take much longer to go out of style – remember shag carpets? Yeah, we’d like to forget that, too.\n\n3. Hardwood floors are more sustainable and environmentally friendly.\n\nWhile carpeting is usually manufactured with synthetic fabrics like nylon or polyester, hardwood floors come from nature’s greatest gift: trees. They are produced naturally and created using the most abundant renewable resource in the world. You also have the option to research how sustainable your hardwood flooring really is using industry standards set by the Forest Stewardship Council and other like-minded organizations.\n\n4. Hardwood floors can help you save energy.\n\nSince wood is a conductor, hardwood floors allow the heat to pass through and circulate in your home, unlike carpet which acts as a barrier for hot air. This means longer-lasting heat, and consequently, less work from your furnace, and most importantly, lower heating bills.\n\n5. Hardwood floors simply look more stylish.\n\nHardwood flooring is becoming trendier as the years go on. There is a seemingly endless amount of wood types, colors, and designs you can choose from that can bring out your inner interior designer. Different stains and polishes can help make your floors even more unique. Plus, a rug can really tie a room together.\n\nLet’s face it: carpets are losing their popularity. If you want to keep current, hardwood flooring is the most logical option. For environmentally-conscious folk, there is nothing better for a home than a nature-friendly material like hardwood. And for those who love interior design, there are more opportunities to use your creativity and imagination, enabling you to put together a perfectly styled home. If you are currently building or planning on building a home, definitely think about installing hardwood instead of carpet – maybe, soon enough, this debate will end for good.\n\nWhen pondering over the current state of our environment, many people begin to envision a futuristic world consisting of chrome and steel. In this version of a future reality (often seen in post-apocalyptic films and TV shows), humanity has wiped out forests in their entirety. Land that was once full of life is now a desolate wasteland. Natural geography is vastly unrecognizable from what it was long ago. Construction and development needs are put above the ecosystem — but now, it’s too late to go back and warn everyone of the dark path ahead. Learn more about the unusual myths about the lumber industry below.\n\nWe understand — it is not easy to be optimistic. But remain calm! In reality, the forests of the world, especially in the United States, have proven to remain sustainable and usable for the foreseeable future. Specifically, the lumber industry — though seemingly contradictory — has created clear initiatives to ensure that this haunting vision of a post-apocalyptic world won’t happen.\n\nStill, many misconceptions remain. Let’s take a look at some of the biggest myths about forest management and the lumber industry’s impact on our environment. We hope that by the time you’ve finished reading, your perception of the future will change for the better.\n\nMyth: Cities and urban areas are taking over forests and trees\n\nFact: The volume of U.S. hardwoods has actually increased by more than 90 percent in the last half-century while forest acreage has increased by 18 percent. And despite a 165 percent growth in population since 1920, U.S. forest acreage has continued to remain stable.\n\nMyth: The only easy way to obtain wood is through clear-cutting entire forests\n\nFact: The preferred method of harvesting hardwoods is in fact single-tree selection, as opposed to clear-cutting. With single-tree selection, trees are carefully selected for harvest, most of them aged to maturity. This careful removal of selected trees creates openings in the forest canopy, allowing more precipitation, nutrients and sunlight to reach the forest floor. Seedlings are then free to sprout and grow naturally. This results in a much more sustainable outcome than solely using the clear-cutting method.\n\nMyth: Using steel, aluminum, and concrete for construction is better for the environment\n\nFact: Wood represents 47 percent of all raw materials used in the US, but the energy to produce wood products accounts for just 4 percent of the energy used to make all manufactured materials. In fact, using materials like steel, aluminum, and concrete require significantly more energy to produce, install and dispose of at the end of their natural life cycles as compared to American hardwoods.\n\nMyth: Wood may have been a great choice in the past, but we’re in the future now\n\nFact: Sometimes, the oldest way is the best way. To this day, wood proves to be the best material for construction. Of course, we don’t use the same old tricks anymore — modern wood manufacturing processes have become extraordinarily efficient. Virtually every part of the log is used as lumber or valuable by-products, while finished wood products are reusable, recyclable and biodegradable. Forest sustainability organizations now reach far and wide.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nAmerican hardwood harvesting is efficient, sustainable, and environmentally friendly. We know it sounds contradictory, but it is the truth — using lumber from America’s lively forests can actually help save the world as a whole.\n\nFrank Miller Lumber is dedicated to this idea of sustainable forest management. Our FSC-certified lumber is used in many projects that meet LEED standards and we continue to run a “zero-waste facility” at our sawmill. Not only does our lumber come out beautiful, authentic, and durable, it also adds to our mission of sustainability.\n\nHopefully, this cleared up a few misconceptions about the lumber industry and the use of wood products. Next time you build a new home or simply buy a new desk for your study, remember: you could have a role in saving the environment.\n\nFor more information on sustainability initiatives within Frank Miller Lumber and the American hardwood industry, go to our Sustainability page.\n\nFrank Miller Lumber social media followers who have been with us for the last year might have noticed some major changes in our activity on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. We are now more committed than ever to engaging more often with the community and Frank Miller Lumber customers across the nation and around the world. Something we did not expect to do was discover an extremely creative group of people who have a deep passion for woodworking.\n\nWoodwork Wednesday was met with immediate popularity when we began the push for submissions earlier this year. We started by calling on our followers to send in their woodworking projects which, as of today, has given us a wide range of results: nightstands, bed frames, tables, chairs, and even a Star Wars lightsaber replica. Tapping into this woodworking community has also showed how important our lumber is for handmade furniture, decor, and passion projects, in addition to the large architectural projects for which we are known. It showed us that Frank Miller Lumber can be used from the smallest of projects (like a bunk bed set for grandchildren), to the largest, (like the Barnes Museum in Philadelphia).\n\nAll of us are amazed by the hard work our friends and customers from the Frank Miller Lumber community have put into these passion projects. It’s our goal to create an entire page on our website dedicated to all of the Woodwork Wednesday submissions and the stories behind each piece. For the remainder of this blog, we’d like to share some of our favorites so far.\n\nThe first Woodwork Wednesday submission we received blew us away and exceeded all expectations. Matt Carter from our own Union City, IN, created this unbelievable replica of Luke Skywalker’s lightsaber using our retail store’s cherry hardwood. (See image above).\n\nBernie Spencer sent us a red oak constructed round etagere perfect for displaying decorations in any setting ― made with Frank Miller Lumber hardwood.\n\nRalph Walker from Columbus, Ohio, was featured for his folding chairs made with Frank Miller Lumber’s quartersawn white oak. Ralph built 16 of these at the time of this submission, with a plan to build 14 more. Not only were the chairs remarkable, but the photos looked equally spectacular!\n\nOne of the more endearing feats of construction that we showcased were Keith Mealy’s bunk beds built for his twin granddaughters, which could also be unbunked and used as single beds!\n\nThese are just a few examples we have showcased over the course of the last few months, which you can see through our weekly social media posts. It has been an inspirational experience seeing how much Frank Miller Lumber impacts the community with our wood in home projects, and woodworking businesses.\n\nPlease send us your work via a Facebook message or our email (frankmillerlumber@gmail.com). We love hearing the stories behind some of them, so remember to include a quick description of the piece along with where the lumber was bought (which we hope is from Frank Miller Lumber!). Stay tuned in the coming months for a new web page including all past, present, and future submissions ― your work could be showcased and archived on the official Frank Miller Lumber website!\n\nKeep on woodworking ― you continue to amaze us.\n\nJust how durable is wood as a construction material? Consider Hōryū-ji, the Temple of the Flourishing Law, in Ikaruga, Japan. Recognized by the United Nations as a World Heritage Site and a national treasure of Japan, Hōryū-ji was built in the year 711 as a Buddhist temple. It eventually came to be known as one of the Seven Great Temples. At over 1300 years old, the temple is one of the oldest surviving wooden buildings in the world.\n\nHōryū-ji is an expanse of many wooden structures with some of the wood structural elements being considerably older than the overall finished complex. A five-story pagoda on the grounds includes a central wooden pillar that is believed to have been felled in the year 594. It is so old that a fragment of one of Buddha’s actual bones is believed to be enshrined at its base.\n\nThe pure age of this beautiful structure is not the only testament to the durability of its wooden composition. Hōryū-ji is not just a piece of wooden history preserved in a climate-controlled museum or protected in a glass case – it is a well-used, functional building. The temple has enjoyed continuous observance of Buddhist traditions for the last fourteen centuries. But it’s not just human wear and tear this beautiful wood building has tolerated – it is an ironman of environmental endurance as well. Since construction was completed, Hōryū-ji has survived at least 46 different earthquakes of magnitude 7.0 or greater. When you take into consideration that this was all accomplished without the aid of modern construction equipment, computerized engineering, or advanced synthetic material treatments, it is hard not to be inspired by this wooden marvel. Of course, nowadays construction materials are different and the use of modern equipment has built some amazing structures with basic necessities like ladders (learn more about folding ladders over at platformsandladders.com) as well as newly developed materials that have added to the protection of the environment rather than take away from it. So those that are in construction should look at implementing past and present practices to ensure safety and a solid structure, whether that be wood or new and improved eco-friendly materials.\n\nWood is both a modern, high-tech, environmentally-friendly architectural construction material, and a proven building material of lasting strength, durability and beauty that is unrivaled by any other material on earth.\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.horyuji.or.jp/horyuji_e.htm\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hōryū-ji\n\nhttps://gizmodo.com/5846501/how-japans-oldest-wooden-building-is-still-standing"
