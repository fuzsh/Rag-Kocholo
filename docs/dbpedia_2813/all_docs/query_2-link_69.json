When it hit issue #27, DC celebrated with a series of variant covers celebrating the significance of the issue. “Naturally, Miller was asked to participate, and he provided a wraparound cover featuring a stark, sexy depiction of Catwoman which we’re proud to bring to auction.”\n\nIn the early 90s, Miller banded together with a group of like-minded creators to form the Legends imprint at Dark Horse Comics. There, Miller created the wildly successful Sin City, progenitor of two feature films. Invited to add characters to a jam drawing cover to celebrate the launch of Wizard magazine, Miller drew contributed Sin City characters. ComicConnect is offering his drawing of Marv, the flawed hero at the center of the first Sin City story, “The Hard Goodbye.”\n\nPlus, find a selection of Miller sketches that reveals a side of his process that is not often seen. “Working out ideas and having fun with some of the characters he’s illustrated over the years, Superman, Daredevil, Elektra, and even a dinosaur makes an appearance,” Zurzolo added, “This is an exciting peek behind the curtain into the mind of a master creator.”\n\nBidding on these pieces is currently underway, and the original art session ends December 14th.
