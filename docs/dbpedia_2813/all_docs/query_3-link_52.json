In addition to his comics work, Miller is famous for comics such as Sin City and 300, both of which were adapted as popular movies in the 2000’s.\n\nDespite Miller’s less-than-respectable critical reception throughout the 2000’s, the author of The Dark Knight Returns and Daredevil: Born Again is still frequently considered one of the greatest comic book creators the medium has known.\n\nBelow you’ll find a complete guide to Miller’s collected comics works to date.\n\nRelated Reading Orders:\n\nBatman\n\nBest comics writers of all time\n\nFrank Miller Comic Books & Graphic Novels\n\nFrank Miller’s Marvel Comics\n\nDaredevil by Frank Miller & Klaus Jason Omnibus\n\nCollects: Daredevil 158-161, 163-191; What If? 28\n\nDaredevil: Born Again\n\nCollects: Daredevil #226-233\n\nDaredevil by Frank Miller Omnibus Companion\n\nCollects: Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spiderman 27-28; Daredevil 219, 226-233; Daredevil: The Man Without Fear 1-5; Marvel Graphic Novel 24 – Daredevil: Love And War\n\nI’d note that this second Frank Miller / Daredevil omnibus overlaps the collection of Born Again listed above.\n\nMarvel Universe by Frank Miller Omnibus\n\nCollects: Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man (1976) #27-28;Marvel Two-In-One (1974) #51; Marvel Spotlight (1979) #8; Amazing Spider-Man Annual #14-15; Marvel Team-Up Annual #4; Wolverine (1982)#1-4; Marvel Fanfare (1982) #18 — And Material From Marvel Preview #23; Marvel Team-Up (1972) #100; Power Man And Iron Fist (1978) #76; Incredible Hulk Annual #11; And Official Handbook Of The Marvel Universe (1983) #2-6, #8 And #10\n\nElektra by Frank Miller Omnibus\n\nCollects: Elektra: Assassin 1-8, Elektra Lives Again, Bizarre Adventures 28, What If? 35\n\nFrank Miller’s DC Batman Graphic Novels\n\nBatman Year One\n\nCollects: Batman #404 To #407\n\n1986’s “Year One,” launching out of DC’s Crisis on Infinite Earths with career defining work by Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli\n\nAll-Star Batman & Robin, The Boy Wonder\n\nCollects: All-Star Batman & Robin, The Boy Wonder #1-9\n\nComics have rarely seen such a discrepancy between expectations and reality, as Frank Miller and Jim Lee teamed up to deliver what still seems like a comic that should have been an all-timer. Instead, it’s an all time laughing stock (cue up the “I’m the goddamned Batman” memes”).\n\nSpawn: Batman\n\nCollects:\n\n1994 crossover between Frank Miller and Todd McFarlane.\n\nBatman: The Dark Knight Returns\n\nCollects: Batman: The Dark Knight Returns #1 To #4\n\nThe Dark Knight Returns: The Last Crusade\n\nCollects: Dark Knight Returns: The Last Crusade #1\n\nFrank Miller teams up with John Romita Jr and co-writer Brian Azarello with this prequel story. Chronologically, the story is clearly set before The Dark Knight Returns, but I’d strongly advise against reading it before the all-time great.\n\nBatman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again\n\nCollects: Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again #1 To #3\n\nBatman: The Dark Knight: Master Race\n\nCollects: Batman The Dark Knight: Master Race #1 To #9\n\nFrank Miller’s Solo Comics – Sin City, 300, And More!\n\nThe Comics Journal Library: Frank Miller : The Interviews : 1981-2003\n\nEisner/Miller\n\nCollects: An interview transcription on the medium of comics\n\nFrank Miller’s Ronin\n\nCollects: Graphic novel\n\nThe Life and Times of Martha Washington in the Twenty-first Century\n\nCollects: Graphic novel\n\nThe Hard Goodbye (Sin City)\n\nSin City Volume 2: A Dame to Kill For\n\nSin City, Vol. 3: The Big Fat Kill\n\nSin City Volume 4: That Yellow Bastard\n\nSin City Volume 5: Family Values\n\nSin City Volume 6: Booze, Broads, & Bullets\n\nSin City Volume 7: Hell and Back\n\nCollects: The complete Sin City graphic novel collection\n\nFrank Miller Robocop\n\nCollects: Frank Miller’s uncut adapted scripts for Robocop 2 and Robocop 3\n\nTerminator vs Robocop\n\nCollects: 4 issue crossover series\n\nFrank Miller and Walt Simonson collaborating!
