        "text": "300 and Sin City creator (and all-round legend) Frank Miller addressed how he thinks A.I. will impact comic book creation at this year’s Lucca Comics & Games and it turns out… he doesn’t think they have anything to worry about at all.\n\n“I don’t think about A.I,” he said when asked. “I am interested in hearing what it can do to facilitate certain functions. But I don’t believe it can draw and I know it can’t make up a story. There’s no way it can talk like a human and have the quirks and errors and missteps and sneezes and all of that.\n\n“Also I’m not particularly excited by anything that’s going to replace people like me.”\n\nMiller, who has been writing comics since 1978, is probably most famous for his work on Daredevil (for which he created the character Elektra), and subsequent Daredevil: Born Again, The Dark Knight Returns, Batman: Year One. He also created Sin City in 1991 and 300 in 1998.\n\nFurther to this, Miller wrote the scripts RoboCop 2 and RoboCop 3, and he also addressed whether comics and cinema were at odds at the Italian pop culture festival, saying: “I think that the power and the scope of cinema have freed up comics and the print medium to become more true to what they are. The difference between comics and other media is one that must be celebrated, not avoided.”\n\nMiller was at the festival celebrating 25 years since the release 300, which was made into a movie in 2006, directed by Zack Snyder.\n\n“Movies are the most powerful medium the world has ever seen,” Miller continued. “Nothing can compete with movies. They are more intimate in terms of the actual physicality of the real actors. Flash Gordon was transformed into Star Wars which was sweeping; a completely believable exploration of a galaxy. And even Superman – the baby of comics – took off in the most breathtaking way on the big screen.\n\n“So I’m not going to do a debate over which medium is more potent or better. I’m just saying they have different strengths and there’s plenty of room for both of these happy siblings to be working separately or together, the more creative a world is, the better!”"
