        "text": "Overview:\n\nFrank Miller is an American writer and artist, known mainly for his work in the comic book and graphic novel industry. His legacy began in the 1970's and continues to this day, with his work spanning multiple media formats. He is most noted for the changes he brought to many already established comic book characters, like Batman and Daredevil, as well as many original comic works, some of which have seen film adaptations.\n\nBiography:\n\nFrank Miller was born January 27, 1957. He grew up in Maryland and Vermont and has been a comic fan from a young age. As an adult, he sought a career in the comic industry and got his start as an artist for The Twilight Zone comic series by Gold Key Comics. This experience allowed him to pursue careers in more mainstream publishing companies and eventually got jobs from both DC Comics and Marvel Comics . His first breakout comic series was reworking the character Daredevil for Marvel Comics and making the character much more commercially and critically successful.\n\nBy proving himself with the Daredevil series, in the 1980's he was given more control as both a writer and as an artist for his own new spinoff series, which gave rise to the new Marvel character Elektra. Since Miller was given more creative control over the character as well as the overall plot, he took the story in a darker direction than what was typical in the industry at the time. It is this dark tone that helped establish his most noticeable literary style, which helped push the industry into the Modern Age of comics.\n\nFrank Miller was given the opportunity to work with DC Comics and redesign one of their flagship characters, Batman, which resulted in his arguably most famous work The Dark Knight Returns. The Dark Knight Returns along with other similar graphic novels of the mid 1980's set a new standard for what can expressed through the comic medium. The characters became darker, the setting was more gritty and despairing, and the plot lines would take morally questionable turns. Miller reworked Batman into a now old and disgruntled man made this way from decades of crime fighting. Batman no longer wishes to continue on as a vigilante, but takes to the streets anyway out of an almost primal instinct to clean up the rough streets of Gotham City.\n\n\"I realized that I was about to turn 30, and Batman was permanently 29. And I was going to be damned if I was older than Batman.\"\n\n-Frank Miller\n\nFrank Miller's new take on the Batman character with The Dark Knight Returns and his later graphic novel Batman: Year One, helped redefine one of DC's biggest and most famous characters as well as earn him the respect as one of the industry's best writer/artist in history.\n\nDespite the fact that the comic industry began to decline rapidly during the 1990's, Miller still continued to work on new graphic novels as to build up his legacy. It is during this time that he developed more individual and personal stories, separate from any previously established intellectual property. During the 1990's Frank Miller wrote and drew Sin City , a neo-noir styled series not too unlike his previous work with Batman. He also created the graphic novel 300 , based off of the Greek Battle of Thermopylae . Both Sin City and 300 have been adapted into films in the 2000's.\n\n\"The Spartans were a paradoxical people. They were the biggest slave owners in Greece. But at the same time, Spartan women had an unusual level of rights. It's a paradox that they were a bunch of people who in many ways were fascist, but they were the bulwark against the fall of democracy.\"\n\n-Frank Miller\n\nSince the viability of the comic book industry has rapidly declined in the past two decades, Frank Miller has taken to movie production by adapting his own as well as other's comic book stories into films.\n\n\"Hollywood is a town; it's not a medium. And cinema is a medium you can practice anywhere.\"\n\n-Frank Miller\n\nInfluences:\n\nA lot of Miller's influence came mostly from older Noir films as well as westerns of his childhood time period. Anything with a morally questionable protagonist with a \"tough as nails\" persona was instantly intriguing to him. These types of stories and protagonists influenced a lot of Miller's later works, such as Sin City.\n\n\"I grew up on the crime stuff. Spillane, Chandler, Jim Thompson, and noir movies like Fuller, Orson Welles , Fritz Lang. When I first showed up in New York to write comics back in the late 1970s, I came with a bunch of crime stories but everybody just wanted men in tights.\"\n\n-Frank Miller\n\nFrank Miller grew up on comic books, but due to his innovation he didn't have examples of the stories he wanted to create. One of his biggest influences in the medium itself is The Spirit series of comic books by Will Eisner. The characters and stories were set in a noir-styled world that Miller loved and respected. Works like The Spirit provided some of the biggest inspiration for Miller to get into the industry. Miller actually ended up directing a film adaptation of the character in 2008.\n\n\"The comics I read as a kid were all about guys in tights. But here was a guy who wore a fedora. He fought crime like they did in Marvel and DC, but he did it in the real world. I had just turned 12 when I met the Spirit and it was a strange coincidence. At the same time I discovered girls I fell out of love with guys in tights.\"\n\n-Frank Miller\n\nMovements:\n\nFrank Miller began his work during the Bronze Age of comics , but he helped establish and usher in the Modern Age of comics. The Bronze age was defined as more \"open minded\" than the Silver Age, with lots of Silver Age works being over censured and often childish. Starting in the Bronze Age allowed Miller more freedom for his creativity and helped him establish his personal style.\n\nAlong with other innovators, like Alan Moore and his own graphic novel Watchmen, Frank Miller was able to transition the industry into a wide-ranged medium and change to the Modern Age of comics. The Modern Age even more \"open minded\" than the Bronze age, where the subject material that could be expressed in comics could really be anything. Comics were not just about superheroes anymore and often took darker and more controversial tones. In the Modern Age, comics were no longer just for children and some could easily be considered mature content for adults only.\n\nStyle:\n\nFrank Miller's style can best be summed up as \"dark\" and \"gritty\". He mostly uses darkness in both as a literal artistic style and as a storytelling element. From a writing standpoint, a lot of his characters are abrasive in personality and tough both physically and mentally.\n\n\"The noir hero is a knight in blood caked armor. He's dirty and he does his best to deny the fact that he's a hero the whole time.\"\n\n-Frank Miller\n\nIn Miller's stories, he doesn't shy away from showing how bad life can be for some characters, and also doesn't shy away from writing tragic endings. When he reworked already established characters, he would have them do things almost unheard of in that character's history. For example, in The Dark Knight Returns, Miller has Batman kill a villain and use military styled technology to fight crime, which was very uncommon for Batman's character up to that period.\n\nHis art style is consistent throughout his years of publishing. Everything is drawn in a rough, almost sketchbook styled appearance and most of his characters are physically unattractive, with certain design features frequently added to give a sense of weariness to his characters. By doing this, he gives his characters and settings a look of unease and makes their outward appearances match their inner intentions and darker personalities.\n\nThemes:\n\nMiller's stories are typically not written with themes or morals in the forefront. Since most of his stories are in a comic setting, the common theme is usually good versus evil, but not in the typical sense. Miller's version of evil is usually far more disturbing than what was common in comics of the period, and leaves the protagonists of his stories to have to make hard decisions to overcome any challenges along the way.\n\nMost of Miller's protagonists could be considered \"antiheroes\" rather than a typical hero, with the line between good and bad being fuzzy at best- and nonexistent at worst. Miller's antiheroes frequently have to compromise on their own morals or ideologies in order to survive and/or accomplish their goals, and often have a 'lesser of two evils' concept tied to them- They aren't exactly good, but they're better than the alternative.\n\nSelected Works:\n\n• Twilight Zone (1978)\n\n• Daredevil (various issues 1979-1983)\n\n• Elektra (various issues 1981-1991)\n\n• Wolverine (1982)\n\n• The Dark Knight Returns (1986)\n\n• Batman: Year One (1987)\n\n• Ronin (1987)\n\n• Sin City (1993-2000)\n\n• 300 (1998)\n\nLegacy:\n\nFrank Miller's legacy and influence reaches far and wide, and not just within the comic book medium. By helping to establish the Modern Age of comics, Frank Miller helped change the face of the industry forever and helped broaden the audience of comic books. Many of his works have been directly adapted into commercially successful films in recent years, while other works of Miller's have various elements taken from them and used in the many superhero adaptation films that are produced today. Along with all the influence, his works do stand up on their own, many of which are considered the best of their kind whether it's Batman, Daredevil, or individual works.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nLiterary Analysis on The Dark Knight Returns:\n\nhttp://go.galegroup.com.library.icc.edu/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA196442100&v=2.1&u=peor81815&it=r&p=AONE&sw=w&authCount=1\n\nWorks Cited:\n\nNayar, Pramod. \"Popular culture and the ecological gothic: Frank Miller's Batman: The Dark Knight Returns.\" Nebula 6.1 (2009): 39+.
