Jekyll Island Museum\n\nJekyll Island Museum's Notes\n\nGet Notes via RSS\n\nThis Day in Jekyll History, February 6, 1899 by Jekyll Island Museum on Friday, February 6, 2009 at 10:34am ·\n\nOn This Day in Jekyll History…\n\nFebruary 6, 1899, Club Member Frank Miller Gould is born in New York City.\n\nFrank was the son of Jekyll Island Club Member Edwin Gould and Sarah “Sally” Cantine Shrady, and brother of Edwin “Eddie” Gould. He was educated at the Browning School in NY and from 1917 to 1920 at Yale in the ROTC. From 1918 to 1920 he was a 2nd Lt. in the U.S.Army, but was discharged after two months active duty due to signing of the armistice. He served as 2nd Lt in the 212th Artillery of the NY National Guard in 1921 and 1922.\n\nIn 1920, Frank went to work as Assistant Secretary for the St.Louis & Southwestern RR, originally developed by his grandfather, Jay Gould. In 1924 he was promoted to Vice President, a position he held until his death in 1945. He married Florence “Betsy” Amelia Bacon in 1924. She was the daughter of William Bacon, Highland Park, Dallas, TX and the niece of Daniel Upthegrove, President of the St.Louis & Southwestern RR. They settled in New York and had two children: Marianne in 1926 and Edwin Jay in 1932.\n\nFrank’s brother, Eddie, died in 1917 in a tragic hunting accident while at Jekyll Island, and his mother stopped coming to the island. His father returned only a few more times over the years. Frank maintained his interest in the Jekyll Club, however and returned in 1921 and 1924 with friends and his grandmother Hester Shrady. From 1925 through 1927 Frank and his wife Betsy stayed at “Chichota” and then he contracted for his own cottage.\n\nIn 1929 Villa Marianna, named in honor of his daughter was ready for its inaugural season. From 1929 to 1932 and again from 1939 to 1942 the Goulds were very active at the Club. In 1942, Frank opened Latham Hammock to Club members for hunting of Wild Turkey and Quail. In March of 1942, he was commissioned as a Captain in the U.S. Army Air Corps and served at Cochran Field, Macon, GA. until 1944. The absence strained his marriage and he and Betsy divorced in 1944. The same year he married, in Macon, Helen Roosen Curran. They honeymooned at “Villa Marianna” and returned to the Gould home at Oyster Bay, Long Island, New York.\n\nIn 1945, Frank joined a syndicate of Bernon Prentice - the Jekyll Island Club President -and Bill Jones owner and operator of the Cloister on Sea Island to buy the outstanding club bonds of $185,000 at 10% value, intending to build a causeway to the island and operate the club as a resort like the Cloister. Frank’s death in 1945 derailed the plan due to loss of his potential financing. His wife, Helen, considered resuming the deal with her lawyer Lawrence Condon. Condon wound up acquiring Frank’s interests in the Club from the estate and tried to continue the project but the State of Georgia became involved and bought the island for a State Park. Both Condon and Jones became members of the Jekyll Island Club as a result of their ownership of the bonds."
