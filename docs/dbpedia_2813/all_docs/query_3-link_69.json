        "text": "“Talk about talent, he writes, he draws, he screenwrites, and he directs, and he is tops at all those things.” That’s comic book Marvel icon Stan Lee talking about another legend in the comic book and film world, Frank Miller, who is lauded in the upcoming doc “Frank Miller: American Genius.”\n\nKnown for a celebrated run at Marvel and DC Comics, the former most notably with “Daredevil,” and “Wolverine,” the latter more known for his “The Dark Knight Returns” series and “Batman: Year One,” Frank Miller is definitely comic book royalty. He’s also moved into the world of movies, writing “RoboCop 2” and ‘3,’ early on, and then moving into co-directed on the “Sin City” movies with Robert Rodriguez, executive producing Zack Snyder’s “300,” based on his comic and solo directing his own feature with 2008’s “The Spirit.” This immense career is all tacked in ‘American Genius,’ coming to theaters, briefly, next month.\n\nREAD MORE: Summer Movie Preview: 50 Must-See Films To Watch\n\nToday, Picturehouse announced a special one-night-only theatrical showing of the feature docu and released the official trailer. Set to screen simultaneously in Cinemark theaters nationwide on Monday, June 10, “Frank Miller: American Genius” will feature a live introduction with Miller moderated by Rosario Dawson (“Sin City”), and all ticket holders will receive an exclusive custom collectible.\n\nThe film will feature appearances by comic book artists Neal Adams, Jim Lee, and Stan Lee, filmmakers Robert Rodriguez and Zack Snyder, actress Jessica Alba and more.\n\n“My life has been driven by a relentless passion for drawing and storytelling, and it’s also led to incredible friendships and experiences along the way,” Miller said in a statement. “Sharing this passion with the fans is what matters most, and that’s why I’m incredibly excited to bring this film to audiences all across the nation on June 10.”\n\nHere’s the official synopsis:\n\nFRANK MILLER: AMERICAN GENIUS explores the near half-century career of Frank Miller, the legendary comic book artist, and writer, and features interviews and cameos from his admirers, students, and collaborators, including Neal Adams, Robert Rodriguez, Jessica Alba, Jim Lee, Zack Snyder, Stan Lee, and more. The film was produced, written, and directed by Silenn Thomas for Frank Miller Ink.\n\n“Frank Miller: American Genius” opens Monday, June 10, for a one-night event via Picturehouse. Watch the trailer below."
