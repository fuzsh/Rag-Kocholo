        "text": "LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA: 'Frank Miller: American Genius', directed by Miller's long-term associate Silenn Thomas, is an upcoming documentary that promises a deeper look into the life of America's legendary comic book artist and writer.\n\nFrank Miller, 67, is widely known for combining film noir and manga influences in his comic art creations. The characters created by him have been adored by fans across the globe.\n\nAhead of the release of his documentary that would explore fifty decades of his remarkable career, here's a look at top 6 characters of his comics that would live on for generations to come.\n\n1. Batman\n\nBatman, the beloved character in DC Comics, was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and was introduced to the readers of 'Detective Comics' in 1939.\n\nOver the years, various creators have reworked on this character but Frank Miller's Batman has been most tough and gritty so far. He introduced Batman as a slightly older man with grey hair, who even struggles with some physical pains like any ordinary older man.\n\nDespite bringing more brutality, he ensured to balance the humane and superhuman qualities in Batman.\n\nFans can revisit Frank Miller's vision of the superhero in 'Batman: Year One' and 'Batman: The Dark Knight Returns'.\n\n2. Daredevil\n\nOriginally created by Stan Lee and artist Bill Everett, 'Daredevil' first appeared in 'Daredevil' #1 (April 1964).\n\nIn 1980, 23-year-old Miller gained control over the writing and drawing of Daredevil, turning around the character's fate in Marvel Universe.\n\nIt is Miller's influential tenure on the character that has made it a widely popular and central character in Marvel. A few months after Miller's 'Daredevil' hit the shelves, he introduced his own creation- Elektra.\n\n'Daredevil: Born Again' is a popular comic book among fans from different generations.\n\n3. Elektra\n\nElektra appears as a supporting character in Marvel Comics. Created by Frank Miller, she first appeared in Daredevil #168 (January 1981). Apart from featuring alongside Daredevil, she has also appeared as a supporting character of the X-Men's Wolverine.\n\nShe has a strong knowledge of martial arts and weaponry. Her ability to temporarily \"borrow\" people's minds helps her to understand their psyche and intentions.\n\nIn 'King in Black' and 'Daredevil Vol. 7' she appeared as the second Daredevil.\n\n4. John Hartigan\n\nJohn Hartigan is one of the main protagonists in 'Sin City' graphic novels. Miller introduced John Hartigan as a cynical yet selfless police detective who doesn't think once before putting his safety at risk in order to save others.\n\nHe is the central character in 'That Yellow Bastard' (1996), followed by a small cameo in 'Just Another Saturday Night'.\n\n5. Carrie Kelley/ Robin\n\nCarrie Kelley, the superheroine in Frank Miller's graphic novels becomes the new Robin in 'The Dark Knight Returns' when she saves Batman's life.\n\nThis character continues to gain prominence in DC Comics as she later adopts the identity of Catgirl in 'The Dark Knight Strikes Again, followed by being identified as Batwoman in 'Dark Knight III: The Master Race'.\n\nThis character is skilled in hand-to-hand combat and is able to efficiently use high-tech equipment and weapons.\n\n6. Dwight McCarthy\n\nAnother notable character in 'Sin City' universe is Dwight McCarthy. Created by Frank Miller, this character first appeared in 'Dame to Kill For' followed by 'The Big Fat Kill', 'The Babe Wore Red' and 'That Yellow Bastard'.\n\nIn 2005 film 'Sin City', he was portrayed by Clive Owen and by Josh Brolin in the 2014 prequel.\n\nDespite having a history of bad tempers and wild drinking, he behaves with chivalry, treating all women with utmost respect.\n\nWhen and where to watch 'Frank Miller: American Genius'?\n\nThe upcoming documentary promises an intriguing look into Frank Miller's life accompanied by heartfelt interviews and cameos from his admirers, students and collaborators.\n\nIt will shed light on Miller's contribution to art and storytelling through his creative imagination and persistent hard work.\n\n'Frank Miller: American Genius' is getting a one-night-only theatrical showing with a simultaneous screening in Cinemark theaters on June 10, as mentioned by Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe screening will commence at 5 pm PT at the Cinemark Playa Vista in Los Angeles which will be live streamed to all other theaters across the country.\n\n'Frank Miller: American Genius' trailer"
