        "text": "Frank Miller (born 1957) is a comic book writer and artist, most famous for helping to popularize Batman's return to his dark and gritty roots. He specializes in gritty, over-the-top noir, and usually draws in an immediately recognizable style - replete with stark black-and-whites and often no color at all. Most of his work is narrated in first-person, usually by a macho Sociopathic Hero. Pretty much all of his work is incredibly violent and bloody, sometimes to the point of Refuge in Audacity. Could be described as the \"Patron Saint of Badass\" - his heroes will be brutalized to the point of Heroic BSOD, but they will also ultimately prove that a single Righteous Badass is superior (or at least equal) to ANY number of evil mooks.\n\nMiller has recently been the center of controversy and has earned the hatred of a very vocal sector of the Internet population, mostly due to his perceived over-representation of prostitutes, sadistic violence (seen as violence for the sake of it), and his libertarian and hawkish political views - though many people like his works for the same reasons. Claims about the reasons for the decline in the quality of his work are the exaggeration of his signature style to ridiculous levels, too much emphasis on satire and his political views, exploration of particular storylines or premises to the detriment of characters, or just plain laziness as time has gone on. While his work today is generally considered below the level it was at height of his career, his fame is quite justified, as he has won multiple Eisner, Kirby and Harvey Awards, as well as a nomination for the Palm d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for Sin City.\n\nNobody does blood splatter like Frank Miller.\n\nFrank Miller has written the following comics, amongst others:\n\nBatman in general - The Dark Knight Returns and Batman: Year One, famously. All Star Batman and Robin and The Dark Knight Strikes Again, infamously. He writes Batman excellently - it's just that WMDs should be used to keep him away from non-Badass Normals.\n\nDaredevil- Whatever Frank Miller did for Batman, he did twice over for Daredevil, or so the saying (roughly) goes. Introduced nearly all of the major elements we associate with the character today, apart from the costume and Bullseye, though the latter got some defining moments under his run too. In his run, Miller created Elektra, and The Hand, added Spider-Man nemesis Kingpin as a new Arch Enemy, made Catholicism a fundamental part of the character of Matt Murdock, added a bigger focus on martial arts in the combat and brought a noir sensibility to the storytelling that's stayed with the series ever since. See Daredevil: Born Again for the magnum opus of the run.\n\nRonin\n\nSin City\n\nGive Me Liberty and the various Martha Washington sequels (with Dave Gibbons)\n\n300\n\nThe Big Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot and Hard Boiled (with Geof Darrow)\n\nWolverine's first limited series\n\nFrank Miller is also known for writing RoboCop 2 and 3 (though is at pains to point out both suffered from extensive Executive Meddling). He also co-directed and wrote the film adaptation of Sin City (he didn't technically do any directing work, but the film's look was based so closely on his art that Rodriguez gave him credit). And he's directed a movie adaptation of The Spirit, which it may or may not have turned out well, depending on who you ask and whether or not they're fans of the Spirit's comics and Frank (The comics are actually very over-the-top like the movie, though Frank did add some of his signature grittiness).\n\nNot to be confused with fellow comic book author Mark Millar, or with the crook that tries to kill Will Kane in High Noon (incidentally one of Miller's favourite films).\n\nFrank Miller provides examples of the following tropes:"
