        "text": "[on Batman Begins (2005)] \"I totally thought they did a damned good job. It was the first \"Batman' movie I've genuinely liked. I sat there, I watched it, and I came out of there going, 'Well done, man.' Sure, they used my stuff - they used everybody's stuff, but they used my stuff a lot - but they did it well, and that's all I care about. It was Batman. What I mean by that is, I thought the character was true. You understand, when I work on a character, I have a very, very hard time seeing anybody else's interpretation. I get very possessive. But when I went out to see this thing, I said, 'This is a pretty cool Batman.' I wasn't sitting there going, 'This is a merchandising tool.' I felt like it really had heart and substance, and Christian Bale with no doubt performed the best Batman I have ever seen\".\n\nWhat I'm after when I draw my pictures is your guts, I want you to feel something. I don't want you to like me necessarily. Its the same with my characters. And what I'm after when I draw is evocation, it's not pretty. I love beauty, I don't care about pretty.\n\n\"The comics I read as a kid were all about guys in tights. But here was a guy who wore a fedora. He fought crime like they did in Marvel and DC. But he did it in the real world. I had just turned 12 when I discovered The Spirit, and it was a strange coincidence. At the same time I discovered girls I feel out of love with guys in tights.\n\n{On moving to Hollywood} I'm a spoiled brat. I thought I was just going to walk in and make movies. But I'd been my own boss for so long that all of a sudden to be facing a roomful of people who were niggling over every little scene... I just thought I'd go back and draw my comics and have a happy life."
