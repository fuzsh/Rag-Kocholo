        "text": "SATURDAY, OCTOBER 29\n\n10:30 – 12:30 Gold Package Signing (room #347-348)\n\n1:00 – 2:00 – Panel (room #339- 342)\n\n3:45 – 6:00 – Silver Package Signing (room #347-348)\n\nFrank Miller is a comic book writer and artist, a screenwriter, a film director, and a movie producer. Originally from just down the street in Olney, MD, Frank was raised in Montpelier, VT, and eventually found his way to New York City and the comic book industry in the late 1970s. Finding work in Gold Key Comics initially, he went on to work with DC and Marvel. At the latter, after recurring fill-in and cover artist gigs, he took over art and, eventually, writing duties on Daredevil. He co-plotted the Wolverine Limited Series with Chris Claremont, and would continue working on titles (his own and those of the companies for which he worked) including Ronin, Daredevil: Born Again, Elektra Lives Again, The Dark Knight Returns, Sin City, and 300. In addition to his comic book work, Miller wrote the scripts for Robocop 2 and 3, directed the film version of The Spirit, shared directing duties with Robert Rodriguez on the Palme d’Or-nominated Sin City and Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, and produced the film 300. Eagle-eyed viewers can spot him in cameo roles in Robocop 2, Daredevil, Sin City, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, and The Spirit. Miller is known for creating Elektra for Marvel Comics’ Daredevil series, and a female version of the Robin character, Carrie Kelley, for DC Comics."
