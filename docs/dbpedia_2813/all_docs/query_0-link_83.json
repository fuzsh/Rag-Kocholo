        "meta_description": "Philippe Labaune Gallery is delighted to announce a special event celebrating its collaboration with Frank Miller. The event features two lithographs and two silkscreens signed by the artist at the time of their creation in France's oldest printmaking workshop specializing in lithography: Atelier Idem, as well as in France's leading silkscreen workshop: Atelier Tchikebe. Philippe Labaune Gallery offers in exclusivity artist's proofs lithographs and silkscreens numbered (Roman numerals) VI to X. Proofs numbered I to V remain the property of Frank Miller. Author, cartoonist, screenwriter and film director, Miller is one of our generation's masters of the graphic novel. The artist is undoubtedly one of the most influential innovators of the \"Ninth Art\" of the 20th century. Frank Miller is a complete artist, brilliant in both writing and drawing. Two of his written masterpieces, Batman: Year One and Daredevil: Born Again, illustrated by Mazzucchelli, remain emblematic monuments of the genre. In addition to his unique style, he surrounded himself with the most atypical and brilliant artists of his generation. With Bill Sienkiewicz, he renewed \"Elektra\"; with Dave Gibbons, he created the mini-series \"Give me Liberty\". Among many others in his collection of impressive works, he has drawn incredible graphic novels such as \"The Dark Knight Returns\", \"Ronin\", \"Sin City\", \"Daredevil\", \"Elektra\", \"300\", \"Wolverine\"... His graphic style remains inimitable, often copied but never equalled. In short, Frank Miller has fundamentally renewed the codes of comics, both narratively and graphically! In late 2021, Philippe Labaune was contacted by Michel E. Leclerc, founder of the publishing house MEL, to express his desire to work with the American icon. Over dinner one evening, Philippe pitched Frank Miller the idea of traveling to Paris together and producing a very limited series of high-quality XL lithographs in the French capital's oldest atelier: L'atelier Idem, as well as working with Atelier Tchikebe, a silkscreen workshop based in Marseille, for two series of smaller prints. And what do you know? Frank loved the idea! Located in the heart of the Montparnasse district of Paris and built in 1880, Atelier Idem is the oldest printmaking workshop in France, specializing in lithography. It houses six Voirin & Marinoni lithographic presses, which created works for Matisse, Picasso, Miro, Chagall, Calder, Braque, Giacometti and many other major 20th-century artists. A new generation of contemporary artists has followed in the footsteps of this prestigious lineage, including JR, Izumi Kato, William Kentridge, David Lynch, Paul McCarthy and Raymond Pettibon. The press on which Miller's lithographs were printed dates back to 1892. Weighing over 8 tons, it was long used to print movie posters, which explains the extraordinary size of the lithographs. For Miller's silkscreens, it was decided without hesitation to collaborate with the leading workshop for this medium: Atelier Tchikebe, based in Marseille. Founded by two brothers, Olivier and Julien Ludwig-Legardez, this workshop is considered one of the most important in Europe for its quality, craftmanship and expertise. Philippe Labaune is delighted to present the results of this exceptional partnership, and we look forward to answering any questions you may have about these masterpieces.",
