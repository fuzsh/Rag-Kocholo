        "text": "Several recent studies highlight John Stuart Mill’s role as a “teacher of the people” in liberal societies committed to the principle of individual freedom and representative government.Footnote 1 However, his reflections on the political significance of higher education have received little attention. This is perhaps not surprising given the common impression that Mill did not see the British universities of his time as sources of progress in national life, and his well-known admonition against a government monopoly over education, which he feared would produce “despotic power” over the opinions and sentiments of the public.Footnote 2 It would be inaccurate, however, to conclude that Mill either dismissed the importance of university education per se or rejected the positive impact of educational reform on political life. Even though Mill was the product of an elaborate utilitarian pedagogy supervised by his philosopher father, James Mill, and was later the doyen of Victorian intellectuals, he famously never attended or taught in a university; thus, his relation to issues of higher education was long-standing and complicated.\n\nIn one of his earliest writings, “Reform in Education” (1834), Mill encouraged the Parliamentary Committee on National Education to imitate the “spirit of the Prussian government,” a reference to the Prussian Ministry of Public Instruction’s approach of working with local committees in a collaborative framework that integrated the modern research university and secondary and elementary schools into a complex, mutually supporting system of national education.Footnote 3 In the article “Civilization” (1836), Mill excoriated the “existing constitution of the two Universities” in England, by which he meant both their organizational structure and intellectual ethos, for being incapable of producing minds “not the creatures of their age, but capable of being its improvers and regenerators.”Footnote 4 In this piece Mill directly correlated conservative opposition to the 1832 Reform Act with the cultural impact of “the principle which has always been the foundation of the English universities”; namely, that “our business is not to make thinkers or inquirers, but disciples.”Footnote 5 Moreover, given the sectarian character of the English universities, Mill concluded that, as a potential means of educating a political class capable of representing the entire nation, “the Universities are absolutely null.”Footnote 6 Decades later, on the eve of the university reforms of 1854 that effectively ended the Anglican monopoly over higher education in Oxford and Cambridge, Mill continued to insist that in “the English universities no thought can find place, except that which can reconcile itself with orthodoxy” as defined by these “ecclesiastical institutions.”Footnote 7\n\nMill applauded the reforms introduced by the 1854 Act, even going so far as to include a note in the 1859 reprint of “Civilization” indicating his satisfaction with Parliament for having exercised its “right of interference” to help reduce the sectarian character of English higher education and to modernize the curriculum by reserving more fellowships in science and math.Footnote 8 But it was in the midst of the Irish university controversy during Mill’s tenure as a member of Parliament in the mid-1860s that he was most directly involved in the politics of higher education in Victorian Britain. In the 1840s, in response to Irish Catholic and Presbyterian complaints against the Anglican control over the only university in the country, Trinity College in Dublin, the government of Prime Minister Robert Peel established the Queen’s College system, with non-denominational institutions of higher education in Galway, Cork, and Belfast. However, this legislation proved to be yet another thorny aspect of Victorian-era Anglo-Irish relations that predictably was reduced to a sectarian dispute over whether to charter a Roman Catholic university or to require Catholic students to attend non-denominational schools in the Queen’s College system. When the Irish university controversy roared back to life in 1866 with William Gladstone’s outreach to Catholic voters as the Liberal Party leader in the House of Commons, including a proposal for reform of the Queen’s College system allowing greater autonomy for institutions of Catholic higher education, Mill expressed deep concern about any attenuation of the principle of non-denominational higher education. In a March 1868 House of Commons debate, Mill even concluded that “an unsectarian education of the highest branches” of Irish society “is by far the greatest benefit we have yet conferred on that island.”Footnote 9\n\nIt was in this historical and political context that Mill offered his most important considerations on the role of higher education in liberal society in his 1867 “Inaugural Address Delivered to the University of St. Andrews.” By the 1860s, Mill’s System of Logic (1843) and Principles of Political Economy (1848) had become standard texts in British universities, and in 1865 the student body of St. Andrews in Scotland elected Mill, despite his protestations, to serve a three-year term in the largely, but not purely, honorary role of rector of the University.Footnote 10 At the time a busy member of Parliament, Mill delayed performing the only obligation actually attached to this honor until some two years later. The “Inaugural Address” is both one of Mill’s later works (of his major writings published in his lifetime, only The Subjection of Women [1869] would follow), and also his most extensive reflection upon the meaning and mission of the university. The St. Andrews Address has been characterized by commentators in various ways: as a rather disappointing and pedestrian argument for generic intellectual freedom;Footnote 11 as a bold appeal for incorporating the Socratic method into higher education;Footnote 12 as a stirring defense of classical education;Footnote 13 as a formula to replicate Mill’s own idiosyncratic education,Footnote 14 and, on the contrary, as a critique of utilitarian ideas on education;Footnote 15 and as a proposal that in scope is wildly unrealistic for any actual university curriculum.Footnote 16\n\nI propose that Mill’s intention in the St. Andrews Address was more emphatically political and more directly engaged in Victorian-era debates about higher education than these commentators suppose. While Mill’s call for plural voting rights for educated people as a means to improve the intelligence of the electorate is well documented,Footnote 17 what goes largely unnoticed today is his prescription in the St. Andrews Address to transform the university as an institution into an instrument of liberal statecraft.Footnote 18 That is to say, Mill employed his most thorough treatment of higher education as a blueprint for the university, presenting it as one of the central institutions responsible for forming a political elite capable of molding public opinion in support of liberal politics among Britain’s newly enfranchised classes."
