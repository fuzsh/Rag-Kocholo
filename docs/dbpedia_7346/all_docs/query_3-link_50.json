His first book, Principles of Psychology (1855), suggested that mind developed from biological necessities. Commenced in 1860, Spencer's system of synthetic philosophy endeavored to find a universal principle that underlies all phenomena and encompasses all areas of human knowledge. From the formless mass of undifferentiated primal energy emerged galaxies in which the vital force became ever more specific and individual. The Darwinian theory of evolution harmonized with Spencer's cast of thought; he coined the phrases \"struggle for existence\" and \"survival of the fittest\" as keys to life on our planet. Spencer warned that the drift to centralization in human society endangered the individual who was both the measure and the means of progress.\n\nThrough his many essays Spencer exerted a tremendous influence. His materialistic views and conviction of inexorable forces working through universal laws appealed alike to pathfinders in science, proponents of laissez-faire economics, fighters for emancipation from convention, and radicals intent on future utopias."
