        "text": "1820 – 1903. English classical liberal political theorist, sociology theorist\n\nPhotograph of H. Spencer\n\nStrengths: Enthusiastic learner who influenced thought in the fields of ethics, religions, politics, philosophy, biology, sociology, and psychology.\n\nWeaknesses: Focused on Lamarckism instead of natural selection, thought the poor were a natural necessity to progress\n\nSpecial Features: Coined the term “survival of the fittest”, self-taught; got most of his knowledge from conversations with friends\n\nStar sign: Taurus\n\nCalled the “philosopher of universal evolution” by Garbarino, Herbert Spencer believed evolution dictated every aspect of our lives, society, and the universe. He believed that societies were evolving on a progressive path from simpler to more complex forms of organization. He is also credited with the idea of the ‘superorganic’; that individuals and society exist on a higher level of complexity than natural organisms, but are nonetheless subject to natural laws. His ideas created the philosophy of “Social Darwinism,” which was used by various European governments and the United States as justification for their imperialism, colonialism, and racism, and free enterprise capitalism, respectively. He died at the age of 83 after declining support and readership, which sent him into depression.\n\nSELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHY:\n\nThe Social Organism (1860)\n\nPrinciples of Biology (1864)\n\nBy Heddy Waters"
