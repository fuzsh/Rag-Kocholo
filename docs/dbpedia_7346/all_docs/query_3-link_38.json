        "text": "(1820–1903). It was the English philosopher Herbert Spencer, not Charles Darwin, who coined the phrase “survival of the fittest.” Although Spencer’s development of a theory of evolution preceded publication of Darwin’s ‘Origin of Species’, Spencer is today regarded as one of the leading social Darwinists of the 19th century. The theory, based on Darwin’s conclusions, suggests that people and societies are subject to the same laws of natural selection as plants and animals are in nature.\n\nSpencer is remembered today as author of ‘Social Statics’ (1851), in which he argued that it is the business of government to uphold and defend natural rights. Beyond this, government should not interfere with the economic functioning of society at all. He saw his main task as developing a philosophy that would link the principles of many areas of knowledge into a grand scientific synthesis to replace the theological systems of the Middle Ages. His work ‘The Synthetic Philosophy’ was published in several volumes from 1862 to 1896.\n\nSpencer was born in Derby, England, on April 27, 1820, where his father was a schoolmaster. He declined an offer to attend Cambridge University. Most of his higher education came through reading. He taught school for a few months, and from 1837 to 1841 he was a railway engineer. In 1842 he contributed a series of letters to a magazine, The Nonconformist. These letters were later published as ‘The Proper Sphere of Government’. He worked in various journalistic positions until 1848, when he became an editor of The Economist. He published ‘The Principles of Psychology’ in 1855. Other books, apart from those included in his synthesis, are ‘The Study of Sociology’ (1872), ‘The Man Versus the State’ (1884), and his posthumous ‘Autobiography’ (1904).\n\nSpencer was one of the most opinionated and argumentative English thinkers of his time. He was a friend of such other writers as George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans), Thomas Henry Huxley, John Stuart Mill, and Beatrice Webb. Webb recorded Spencer’s last years in her work, ‘My Apprenticeship’ (1926). Spencer died in Brighton on Dec. 8, 1903."
