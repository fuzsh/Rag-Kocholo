        "text": "Definition\n\nSociology is the study of human social relationships and institutions. Sociologists examine topics as diverse as crime and religion, family and the state, the divisions of race and social class, the shared beliefs of cultures, and social stability and radical changes throughout entire societies.\n\nSociology”s examination of these subjects is underlined by an emphasis on understanding how the actions of people and the way they think both shape and are shaped by surrounding social and cultural structures (Giddens & Sutton, 2006).\n\nSociology analyzes and explains the world both on a small and large scale. At the personal level, sociology can investigate the social causes and consequences of things such as romantic and platonic love, race and gender identity, family conflict, deviant behavior, aging, and religious faith.\n\nAt the societal level, sociology examines matters like crime and law, poverty and wealth, prejudice and discrimination, education, businesses, urban structure, and social movements.\n\nBeyond the level of individual society, sociology studies phenomena such as population growth and migration, war and peace, and economic development (Giddens & Sutton, 2006).\n\nOrigins: Auguste Comte\n\nThe first person to coin the term sociology was the French essayist Emannuel-Joseph Sieyes (Griffiths et al., 2012). However, it was not until August Comte reinvented Sieye”s term in 1838 that the word sociology came to be used as it is now.\n\nAuguste Comte studied to be an engineer before becoming the student of the social philosopher Claude Henri de Rouvroy Comte de Saint-Simon.\n\nBoth Comte and Henri believed that social scientists could use the same scientific methods utilized in the natural sciences — like physics, or biology — to study societies. Comte believed in the potential of social scientists to better society.\n\nThat is to say, he believed that, once scholars identified the laws that governed society, sociologies could address problems as far-ranging as poor education and poverty (Griffiths et al. 2000). Comte is widely considered to be the “father” of sociology today.\n\nComte named his scientific study of social patterns positivism, and that using scientific methods to reveal the laws by which societies and individuals interact would create a “positivist” age of history.\n\nMethods\n\nSociology was conceived as having methods in parallel with the natural sciences. As a result, the field has a distinct set of methods suited to different situations. There are four major kinds of sociological research methods: surveys, field research, experiments, and secondary data analysis.\n\nSurvey Method\n\nSurveys collect data from participants who respond to a series of questions about behaviors and opinions, often in the form of a questionnaire. This allows participants anonymity in expressing their personal ideas.\n\nOne major example of a survey that sociologists have used is the U.S. census, which identifies people living in the United States based on their location, ethnicity, social status, and a number of other factors. Although surveys are flawed in capturing the ways that people actually behave in social situations, they give insight into how people say they think and feel (Giddens et al., 1991).\n\nField Research\n\nField research, on the other hand, refers to gathering primary data from the world outside of a lab experiment or survey. In conducting field research, sociologists step into new environments, and observe and participate in the world of others.\n\nThis research can take place in locations ranging from a coffee shop to a remote tribal island.\n\nSociological experiments can be conducted either in the lab or in the field. In a lab, experiments can be controlled in a way that produces more data in a set period of time.\n\nExperiments\n\nMeanwhile, in a field-based experiment, the information generated may be considered to be more accurate due to it being collected without the intervention of a researcher (Giddens et al., 1991).\n\nIn setting up experiments, sociologists create artificial situations that allow them to manipulate variables.\n\nSociologists typically select a group of people with similar characteristics, such as age, class, race, or education, and create an experimental and control group. While the experimental group is exposed to a variable that the researcher has and can change, the control group is not.\n\nSecondary Data Analysis\n\nFinally, secondary data analysis is the analysis based on work already completed by other researchers. These researchers can be historians, economists, teachers, or other sociologists, and can come from periodicals, newspapers, magazines, or some other source (Giddens et al., 1991).\n\nOftentimes, secondary data analysis can lead to sociologists interpreting findings in a way that was not part of the author”s original purpose or attention. For example, a sociologist looking to investigate social attitudes toward propaganda in the second world war may read newspaper articles and watch briefings from the early 1940s.\n\nUsing already available data is useful for sociologists in that it is nonreactive or unobtrusive research. Because sociologists do not have direct contact with the people who created the media they are examining, they cannot alter or influence people”s behaviors.\n\nHowever, the sheer mass of previously existing sociological data presents its own set of challenges in finding a systematic way to sort through vast libraries of materials to glean information related to what a particular sociologist is looking to study (Giddens et al., 1991).\n\nNotable Figures\n\nSociology vs. Psychology\n\nSociology and Psychology both seek to understand behavior — however, they do so on different scales. While psychology focuses on understanding the individual, sociology focuses on social groups, communities, and cultures.\n\nPsychologists focus on researching, analyzing, and managing the factors that drive or impact the behavior of individuals. These can include mental illness, mood disorders, or relationships.\n\nMeanwhile, sociologists tend to work with large-scale societal issues such as poverty, race and social divides, and public health concerns.\n\nAlthough a sociologist may study the behavior of individuals, they more often do so in the context of understanding how outside forces influence that individual than the individual”s own brain processes and possible pathologies."
