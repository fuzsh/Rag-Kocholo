        "text": "Herbert Spencer, 1820-1903.\n\nThe Victorian biologist and early social philosopher Herbert Spencer was a great rival of Charles Darwin's. His theory of evolution preceded Darwin's own, but was soon overshadowed because of the absence of an effective theory of natural selection - although it was Spencer, and not Darwin, who popularized the term \"evolution\" itself and coined the now-ubiquitous phrase, \"survival of the fittest\". Although no longer influential in biology, his extension of his theory of evolution to psychology and sociology remains important. His \"Social Darwinism\" was particularly influential on early evolutionary economists such as Thorstein Veblen, but, more contemporaneously, it was adopted with gusto by American apologists such as William Graham Sumner and Simon Nelson Patten."
