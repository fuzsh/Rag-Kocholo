Jevons' thought was shaped by three ideas, which can be traced back to Spencer: the idea that individuals were no tabula rasa ; the belief that evolution was a beneficent process; and the idea that moral sentiment evolved towards perfection. I will also show why Jevons supported the idea of interventionist social reform, which Spencer rejected, and I will argue that this disagreement stemmed from Jevons' commitment to Jeremy Bentham's utilitarianism.\n\nNo References\n\nNo Citations\n\nNo Supplementary Data\n\nNo Article Media\n\nNo Metrics\n\nKeywords: CHARACTER; HERBERT SPENCER; MORAL CONSCIENCE; SOCIAL ENGINEERING; STATE INTERVENTION; TABULA RASA; UTILITARIANISM; VICTORIAN AGE; WILLIAM STANLEY JEVONS\n\nDocument Type: Research Article\n\nAffiliations: Laboratoire SPH, UMRU 4574 University of Bordeaux and University of Bordeaux-Montaigne\n\nPublication date: 2023\n\nShare Content\n\nAccess Key\n\nFree content\n\nPartial Free content\n\nNew content\n\nOpen access content\n\nPartial Open access content\n\nSubscribed content\n\nPartial Subscribed content\n\nFree trial content"
