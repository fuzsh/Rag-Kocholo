The Wolf Prize is an international award granted in Israel to outstanding scientists and artists, for achievements in the interest of humankind and friendly relations among peoples. The prize in each field consists of a certificate and a monetary award of $100,000. Laureates receive their awards from the President of the State of Israel at a special ceremony at the Knesset in Jerusalem. Since 1978 the Wolf Foundation has awarded five or six prizes annually in the fields of Agriculture, Chemistry, Mathematics, Medicine and Physics. The arts prize rotates annually among Architecture, Music, Painting and Sculpture. Wolf Prizes in various fields are considered the most prestigious awards after the Nobel Prize, and many Wolf Prize winners have gone on to win a Nobel.
