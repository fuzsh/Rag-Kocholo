Recognition from organisations such as the Financial Times and The Lawyer only confirm what we’ve always said: broad regional experience and focused practice depth help our clients meet their goals.\n\nOver the years, we’ve been consistently ranked among the leading law firms in CEE/SEE and we’ve won numerous awards.\n\nHere are just a few."
