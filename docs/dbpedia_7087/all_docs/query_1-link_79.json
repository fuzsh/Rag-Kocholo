        "text": "2013 Red Wolf Owned by Herrington Cattle Co., Red Wolf placed second in 1997 for PBR Bull of the Finals and PBR Bull of the Year. He had one of the longest careers of any high-level bucking bull, being born in 1988 and not retiring until the age of 12 in 2000. The 2000 PBR World Finals, where Red Wolf made his last out, marked his sixth consecutive appearance at the Finals. Red Wolf had a career buckoff percentage of 58.97 percent in Built Ford Tough Series events. He was ridden 16 times in 39 outs, including seven round wins, and his average bull score was 45.54 points. Red Wolf is among the Top 20 bulls in PBR history in terms of both average bull score and average ride score, as well as Top 10 in number of 90-point rides produced."
