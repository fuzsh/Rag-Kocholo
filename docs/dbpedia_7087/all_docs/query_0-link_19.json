        "text": "The most important discovery of Prof. Jacob Bekenstein, The 2012 Wolf Prize Laureate in Physics, is his realization that black holes have a temperature and carry entropy proportional to the area of their event horizon. This has sparked the creation of an entire field devoted to the study of black hole thermodynamics where the theories of quantum mechanics, general relativity and statistical mechanics are deeply intertwined. This has led to advances in quantum gravity and string theory. He also demonstrated that it is not possible for an observer to measure anything about the black hole except their total mass, angular momentum and electromagnetic charge. This discovery led to the current description of black holes as very simple objects and provides constraints on theories that modify general relativity. These seminal advances have been used by many others and continue to have vast influence in cosmology and theoretical physics.\n\nGeorge Snell, one of the first Wolf Prize Laureates in medicine, was awarded the Wolf Prize for his major breakthrough in the understanding of modern genetics, which opened new avenues for adequate matching of organ and tissue transplantation and for the possible control and prevention of certain diseases. Snell was pivotal in identifying and characterizing the H-2 antigens in mice, which are crucial for encoding the major genes responsible for transplantation antigens. These genes play a vital role in initiating immune responses, which are key to our body's defense mechanisms. Our immune system is designed to reject damaged or abnormal cells, ensuring proper bodily function. This rejection mechanism also applies to foreign cells during transplants. Through his research on mice with closely related genetic backgrounds, Snell demonstrated that this rejection is due to molecular complexes present on cell surfaces. In 1951, he further discovered that this rejection process is controlled by a specific group of genes located on a particular chromosome. His findings have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of transplant biology.\n\nPhyllis Lambert, the 2016 Wolf Prize Laureate in architecture, embodies versatility and excellence across various roles in the field. As a designer, planner, artist, writer, photographer, curator, museum director, patron, and philanthropist, she champions professional rigor, aesthetic elegance, intellectual inquiry, and political critique. Since the mid-1950s, Lambert has been actively involved in realizing groundbreaking buildings, urban preservation projects, and leading architectural research institutes. Her architectural journey began with commissioning Ludwig Mies van der Rohe for the iconic Seagram Building in New York, where she also served as director of planning. Throughout the 1960s, she designed the Saidye Bronfman Centre in Montreal and contributed as a consultant to the Toronto-Dominion Center project. In the 1970s, Lambert collaborated as an architect-developer for the renovation of the historic Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles. Lambert's profound impact extends to her founding and leadership roles at the Canadian Centre for Architecture (CCA) in Montreal, completed in 1989. The CCA, renowned as a museum and study center, houses extensive collections of architectural artifacts and literature, hosts scholars and curators, and fosters architectural discourse through publications and exhibitions. As both a repository of historical treasures and a hub of intellectual exchange, the CCA stands as a testament to Lambert's enduring influence on the architectural landscape.
