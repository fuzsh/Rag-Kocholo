        "text": "Wolf-Gor­don con­grat­u­lates our Chief Cre­ative Offi­cer, Mary­beth Shaw, who was award­ed the 2024 All­man Award by the Wall­cov­er­ings Association!\n\nThe All­man has been award­ed annu­al­ly by the Wall­cov­er­ings Asso­ci­a­tion since 1946 to acknowl­edge and cel­e­brate indi­vid­u­als who have made out­stand­ing con­tri­bu­tions in the form of per­son­al, cor­po­rate, tech­ni­cal, prod­uct, or mar­ket­ing achieve­ments that have ben­e­fit­ed the wall­cov­er­ing industry.\n\nDur­ing her tenure at Wolf-Gor­don (1997 – 2003 and 2011 – present), Shaw spear­head­ed a com­pre­hen­sive rebrand­ing that enlivened the brand and refreshed Wolf-Gordon’s iden­ti­ty as an Amer­i­can design com­pa­ny. The WA rec­og­nized Shaw for her design-cen­tered ini­tia­tives, which, in the words of the nom­i­nat­ing com­mit­tee, have ​“demon­strat­ed the con­cep­tu­al poten­tial of com­mer­cial wall­cov­er­ing.” Shaw’s licensed design pro­gram, which began in 2001 with Lau­rin­da Spear’s provoca­tive col­lec­tion ​“Linework,” has trans­formed design approach­es indus­try-wide. Fur­ther col­lab­o­ra­tions with design­ers such as Karim Rashid, Mae Engel­geer, and Bradley L Bow­ers, as well as Shaw’s con­cep­tu­al projects, includ­ing 2023’s PROJECT: HI > AI, have expand­ed the com­mer­cial wall­cov­er­ing field into new realms of design excellence.\n\nIn addi­tion to rec­og­niz­ing her advance­ment of design, the WA also cites Shaw’s long­time com­mit­ment to sus­tain­abil­i­ty, both at Wolf-Gor­don and beyond. She has served as a board mem­ber of the WA since 2021 and is cur­rent­ly co-chair of the Tech­ni­cal Com­mit­tee, work­ing to fur­ther explore recy­cla­bil­i­ty. She traces her pas­sion for sus­tain­abil­i­ty to the work her own design stu­dio exe­cut­ed dur­ing 2004-11 for the U.S. Green Build­ing Coun­cil — her firm, Shaw Jelveh Design, com­plet­ed over 80 graph­ic, dig­i­tal, and inte­ri­ors projects, sig­nif­i­cant­ly con­tribut­ing to the growth of the USG­BC and LEED. Shaw con­sis­tent­ly seeks to improve sus­tain­abil­i­ty stan­dards at Wolf-Gor­don and industry-wide.\n\nCon­grat­u­la­tions to Mary­beth Shaw on this well-deserved honor!\n\nPho­tos Cour­tesy of Haley Smith"
