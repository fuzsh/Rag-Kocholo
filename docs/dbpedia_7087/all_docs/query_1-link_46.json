        "text": "Established in 1978 by Richard Wolf, the prize is awarded annually to researchers and musicians who have made lasting contributions to the fields of mathematics, medicine, physics, agriculture and music. There are two Hungarians among this year's nine awardees, along with György Kurtág, neurobiologist Roska Botond (shared with José-Alain Sahel) received the prestigious award.\n\n'For his contribution to the world’s cultural heritage, which is fundamentally inspirational and human' – the international jury commented on its decision. – 'His music, which deals with the existential questions of the human soul, focuses on fundamental emotions such as love and sorrow, fear, anxiety, despair, and a desire for harmony and reconciliation. His art ranges from small forms, such as his short piano works, to a large-scale cantata or opera, and it reflects the past and present of the entire history of Western music. Kurtág’s immense influence on numerous musicians is simply magical. His scholarly environment has always been lucky to absorb from him a unique spirit of devotion to music, structural thinking and harmony and hence experiencing his tutorial work as a torch of humanity.'"
