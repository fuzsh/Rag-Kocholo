        "text": "Synopsis\n\nPierre Agostini, Ferenc Krausz, and Anne L’Huillier have been awarded the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physics for their experimental methods in generating attosecond pulses of light. This enables the study of electron dynamics in matter. The Nobel Prize for Physics has historically seen limited representation for women, with only four female winners since 1901.\n\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physics to Pierre Agostini, Ferenc Krausz and Anne L’Huillier “for experimental methods that generate attosecond pulses of light for the study of electron dynamics in matter.”\n\nL’Huillier discovered that many different overtones of light arose when she transmitted infrared laser light through a noble gas. Only four women have won the Nobel Physics Prize since the award was first handed out in 1901: Marie Curie (1903), Maria Goeppert Mayer (1963), Donna Strickland (2018) and Andrea Ghez (2020).\n\nL'Huillier was one of the recipients of last year's prestigious Wolf Prize, whose laureates occasionally go on to win the Nobel.\n\nEach overtone is a light wave with a given number of cycles for each cycle in the laser light. They are caused by the laser light interacting with atoms in the gas; it gives some electrons extra energy that is then emitted as light. L’Huillier has continued to explore this phenomenon, laying the ground for subsequent breakthroughs.\n\nIt was earlier tipped that research into light, new materials and cosmic exploration may win the award.\n\nThe Nobel Prize for physics has been presented one day after Hungarian-American Katalin Karikó and American Drew Weissman received the Nobel Prize in medicine for their groundbreaking discoveries that paved the way for the development of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19, a disease that caused a deadly pandemic.\n\nLast year, three scientists jointly received the physics prize for demonstrating that minuscule particles could maintain a connection with each other even when separated. Alain Aspect of France, John Clauser of the United States and Austria's Anton Zeilinger won the Nobel for their work into quantum entanglement, a concept once dismissed by Albert Einstein as \"spooky action\". This phenomenon is now being explored for potential practical applications, such as information encryption.\n\nNobel Prize for chemistry and literature will be presented on Wednesday and Thursday each with the Peace Prize being revealed on Friday. Finally, the economics prize will be announced on October 9, closing out the 2023 Nobel season.\n\n.\n\nHere is a list of the 10 most recent Nobel Physics Prize winners:\n\n2022: Alain Aspect (France), John Clauser (US) and Anton Zeilinger (Austria) for groundbreaking work in the field of quantum mechanics.\n\n2021: Syukuro Manabe (US-Japan) and Klaus Hasselmann (Germany) for climate models, and Giorgio Parisi (Italy) for work on the theory of disordered materials and random processes.\n\n2020: Roger Penrose (Britain), Reinhard Genzel (Germany) and Andrea Ghez (US) for their research into black holes.\n\n2019: James Peebles (Canada-US) for discoveries explaining the universe's evolution after the Big Bang, and Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz (Switzerland) for the first discovery of an exoplanet.\n\n2018: Arthur Ashkin (US), Gerard Mourou (France) and Donna Strickland (Canada) for inventions in the laser field used for advanced precision instruments in corrective eye surgery and industry.\n\n2017: Barry Barish, Kip Thorne and Rainer Weiss (US) for the discovery of gravitational waves, a phenomenon predicted by Albert Einstein a century ago as part of his theory of general relativity.\n\n2016: David Thouless, Duncan Haldane and Michael Kosterlitz (Britain) for their study of strange phenomena in unusual phases, or states, of matter, such as superconductors, superfluids or thin magnetic films.\n\n2015: Takaaki Kajita (Japan) and Arthur McDonald (Canada) for their work on neutrinos.\n\n2014: Isamu Akasaki (Japan), Hiroshi Amano (Japan) and Shuji Nakamura (US) for their work on LED lamps.\n\n2013: Peter Higgs (Britain) and Francois Englert (Belgium) for their work on the so-called Higgs boson, a subatomic particle that gives mass to other particles\n\nThe prizes come with a monetary reward of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million), sourced from the endowment left by the prize's founder, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel, who passed away in 1896.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nWhat’s India drinking?
