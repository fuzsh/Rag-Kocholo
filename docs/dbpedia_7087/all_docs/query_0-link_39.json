        "text": "Each year the Wolf Foundation honors the best scholars, scientists, and artists by awarding them with the prestigious Wolf Prize. Laureates are celebrated for their achievements and unique contribution to the world.\n\nHeld annually at the Knesset in Jerusalem, distinguished laureates of the Wolf Prize attend a ceremony to receive the accolade from the President of the State of Israel. Unfortunately, due to restrictions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, holding the ceremony at the Knesset has not been possible for the past two years.\n\nThe Wolf Foundation therefore embarked on a journey around the world, reaching out to 2020 and 2021 laureate to hold personalized ceremonies. Whether at their respective universities or their place of residence.\n\nThese ceremonies will be broadcast on the Haaretz website and Wolf Prize Facebook page at 8:30pm. Honoring us with their presence will be President of the State of Israel, Mr. Reuven Rivlin, and Chairperson of the Wolf Foundation Council and Minister of Education and Higher Education, Dr. Yifat Shasha-Bitton."
