        "text": "I suspect awardees do not use the award money to do research in the majority of instances. My opinion is not judgemental: in most cases, it would not make much sense to spend that money for research purpose.\n\nIn fact, the average Nobel (or Fundamental Physics Prize, probably the largest sum awarded as prize to scientists) is shared among several people, and amounts to a few hundred of thousands of US dollars each. While that is a large sum for personal purpose, it is not necessarily a large sum for research purpose.\n\nMore importantly, a Nobel medalist is certainly in the league, and with much better prospects of success, to obtain research grants that range in the millions (European research council grant for example). If you can fetch millions of research money every 5 - 10 years, what difference your ten times smaller, once-in-a lifetime Nobel prize sum would make? Of course the argument above is even stronger for the Fields medal, given its relatively low monetary value.\n\nOther have noted that it depends upon the Award. In the case of MacArthur \"Genius Grants\", popular press articles have examined how recipients spend this prize.\n\nThis New York Times article describes how most recipients used the money for things such as their charities, own research, debts, and other causes.\n\nThis Time article examined how 6 recipients used their prizes.\n\nAnother important factor to consider is the tax policy of the country the winner is a tax resident of, and issues of international taxation.\n\nI personally know of someone who was wealthy enough and living in a country to be in the tax bracket that a large portion of a monetary award to that person would have gone to tax. That tax was avoided by using the money for research instead. It funded a few PhD students for several years, and sufficient lab resources."
