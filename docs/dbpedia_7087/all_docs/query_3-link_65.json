        "text": "The 2016 Wolf Prize in Chemistry has been awarded to Professor Kyriacos Costa Nicolaou, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA (pictured left), and Professor Stuart L. Schreiber, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA (pictured right).\n\nThe Wolf Prize has been awarded anually by the Wolf Foundation since 1978 and honors contributions to the sciences and to the arts “in the interest of mankind and friendly relations among people”. It comes with $100,000 prize money, to be divided equally among the honorees. The award was presented during a ceremony at the Knesset in Jerusalem, Israel, on June 2, 2016.\n\nProfessor Nicolaou is honored “for advancing the field of chemical synthesis to the extremes of molecular complexity, linking structure and function and expanding our dominion over the interface of chemistry, biology, and medicine.” Professor Schreiber receives the award “for pioneering chemical insights into the logic of signal transduction and gene regulation that led to important new therapeutics, and for advancing chemical biology and medicine through the discovery of small-molecule probes.”\n\nKyriacos Costa Nicolaou studied chemistry at the University of London, UK, where he received his Ph.D. in 1972. After postdoctoral stays at Columbia University, New York, USA, and at Harvard University, he joined the faculty at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA. In 1989, he was appointed as Professor of Chemistry both at the University of California, San Diego, USA, and at the Scripps Research Institute, San Diego. In 2013, Nicolaou joined Rice University as Harry C. and Olga K. Wiess Professor of Chemistry.\n\nAmong numerous other honors, Professor Nicolaou has received the ACS Award for Creative Work in Synthetic Organic Chemistry by the American Chemical Society in 1993, the Yamada-Koga Prize in 1999, the Nagoya Gold Medal of Organic Chemistry from Nagoya University, Japan, in 2001, the ACS A. C. Cope Award in 2005, and several honorary degrees. He serves on the advisory boards of numerous scientific journals, including Chemistry – An Asian Journal and ChemistryOpen.\n\nStuart L. Schreiber studied chemistry at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, USA, and received his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1981. He then joined the faculty at Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, and was promoted to Associate Professor in 1984 and Full Professor in 1986. He returned to Harvard University in 1988. Today, he is Morris Loeb Professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University, as well as Director of Chemical Biology the Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA.\n\nProfessor Schreiber has received the Arthur C. Cope Scholar Award by the ACS in 1986, the Thieme-IUPAC Award in Synthetic Organic Chemistry in 1992, the ACS Award for Creative Work in Synthetic Chemistry in 1994, the Tetrahedron Prize for Creativity in Organic Chemistry in 1997, and the Wheland Medal, by the University of Chicago in 2010, among many other honors.\n\nSelected Publications by K.
