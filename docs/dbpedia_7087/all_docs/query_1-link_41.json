        "text": "I often failed at assimilation but learned all of the skills along the way through trial and error. Sometimes the people I wanted to assimilate with didn’t see me, but I still got the practice. I’m not saying it’s a positive thing. It just is. Therefore, I’m nobody, who are you? Yet, I’m also everybody.\n\nThe year before I was old enough to drive, [my mother] let me practice steering the car on long stretches of empty highway. I’d reach across the center console and take the wheel, leaning into her, my back against her chest, following the arc of the sun west toward home.\n\nNot only did Brown do heroic work in his original scholarship, but he escaped the insular world of academese and presented it in an accessible and appealing form. It’s a major accomplishment.\n\nI chose English because no one in my family or friends knew it – no one I spoke to could read what I wrote. I myself did not know the language. It was a parallel reality, an insanely beautiful freedom. It still is.\n\nThis book is about the women and men who found themselves on the front lines of the greatest moral battle of our time, the struggle to prove that—despite differences of skin color, gender, ability or custom—humanity is one undivided thing.\n\nMy parents speak two different Bantu languages, and even my sister and I speak different languages; so, we all speak to each other in English. We speak Nyanja, Namwanga, Mambwe and Bemba. I tend, when I think in Zambian words, to think in Bemba, not Nyanja.\n\nAs a scholar and writer, his footprint is vast, and no one, since the great W.E.B. Du Bois, has done more to reframe the narrative of his field away from the ‘Lost Cause’ myth of white supremacy, toward interracial democracy, truth, and justice.\n\nThere’s been a lot of reservation literature written. I wanted to have my characters struggle in the way that I struggled, and the way that I see other Native people struggle, with identity and authenticity.\n\nSince her encounter with Dickinson, Smith has gravitated to poetry that employs plain language to probe the eternal, similar to the work of Elizabeth Bishop and Philip Larkin.\n\nWhat I attempted to do, and I think all the other black arts poets attempted to do, is that we were about putting the African American and African back on the world stage.\n\nWith a combination of deep learning, eloquence and a deft, original way of considering our national history and literature, [Delbanco] documents the human mise-en-scène in a way that matters today.\n\nIn its three sections, the reader finds prose memoir and poems in historical persona, including the voice of Jim Limber, the mixed-race son whom Jefferson Davis adopted during the last year of the Civil War.\n\nGrowing up in DeLisle, Mississippi has influenced me in many ways. Growing up here taught me to appreciate beauty, the beauty of the bayous and of the forests and of the Gulf. Growing up in this community taught me to appreciate storytelling, taught me to appreciate language.\n\nThe word “bunk” itself comes from politics, sourced to a congressional debate over the Missouri Compromise and slavery. Young connects the timing of the development of our modern notion of race—itself a falsehood—with the coining of the word ‘hoax.’\n\nThis is what it felt like to be a bomb. You were coiled up, majestic with blackness, unaware that the universe outside you existed, and then a wire snapped and ripped open your eyelids all the way around and you had a vision of the world in 360 degrees, and everything in your purview was doomed by seeing.\n\nWhat I wanted was for them to have the grand, sweeping narrative that they deserved, the kind of American history that belongs to the Wright Brothers and the astronauts.\n\nThis roller-coaster mélange of poetry, anecdote, songs, interviews and transcripts is thoroughly entertaining yet requires every ounce of your concentration as he doubles back, bolts ahead or code-switches his way through the briar patch.\n\nThis sounds very corny but my life has been determined by two things that have been extremely important: love and violence. There is sorrow, pain and death, but there’s another parallel dimension, and that is love.\n\nFaderman crystalizes this trajectory in the words of activist Frank Kameny: ‘We started with nothing, and look what we have wrought!’\n\nMorris is deeply interested in the tensions of home and away, which can be seen in the immigrant and Great Migration characters populating “The Jazz Palace,” both fictional and actual.\n\nHe begins with that moment in Swing 46, which threw him into exploring a tradition that “works very hard to create an illusion of ease” and spontaneity, but also illuminates centuries of complex American culture.\n\nPhillips’ words insists on the strangeness of difference—the classics haunt his poems, but so do roosters in Ohio, Led Zeppelin riffs in the basement and the Wu-Tang Clan.\n\nSo I found myself going to this place with the smell of brand-new books, and I could take any book I wanted. It was amazing! I used to go there, and read and read and read. That was a transformative experience.\n\nA scrupulous, revelatory archival investigation of some 2,000 people enslaved across three generations: roughly half on a Jamaican sugar plantation called Mesopotamia and half on Mount Airy, a Virginia tidewater plantation growing tobacco and grain.\n\nAn epic chorus-in-the-round, with some 30 narrators, each in various patois, telling their story as it intersects with the Singer, as James calls the reggae legend over these 700 pages.\n\nMarra takes his title from a medical dictionary definition of life and his inspiration, in part, from the fact that no previous English language novel was set in a region that has been fertile soil for Leo Tolstoy, Mikhail Lermontov and Alexandr Pushkin.\n\nEncouraged by New Yorker Editor David Remnick, Shavit spent five years writing “My Promised Land” in English and Hebrew simultaneously. It asks basic questions: Why was Israel created? What has it achieved? What went wrong? Will it survive?\n\nThe interior of Guyana came alive to me, and seemed like another planet […] the great waterfalls and trees—so different from the coast where I was born.\n\nI am always feeling terrified of being known; not because they really know you, but simply because their claim to knowledge is a concealed attempt to destroy you.\n\nIn awarding him its literature prize in 1986, the Nobel Jury cited him as a writer ‘who in a wide cultural perspective and with poetic overtones fashions the drama of existence.’\n\nThis is a monumental book, the kind that appears once in a decade. It could not be a better example of the literature of diversity.\n\nWriter Kevin Powers, who joined the Army at age 17 and served as a machine gunner in Iraq, creates a tightly focused, hypnotic story that spirals around his central character’s isolation. Powers has created a piercing portrayal of war.\n\nIn understated prose, the story tells of two slave sisters who turn tables on their mistress and take her captive after her Kentucky farmer husband dies.\n\nLoyalties were always mixed and the world inside the walls of my home was significantly different from the world beyond it.\n\nAn elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Blight works in many capacities in the world of public history, including on boards of museums and historical societies, and as a member of a small team of advisers to the 9/11 Memorial and Museum team of curators.\n\nThese studies introduced me to the significance of evolutionary biology for understanding human nature, enabling me to come full circle by fusing my interest in the human mind with my earlier love of the natural world.\n\nGrowing up as a schoolboy in Trinidad, I received an education in literature that some people might dismiss as ‘colonial.’ It nevertheless served me well in dealing with the complexities of American biography.\n\nMore than 20 years ago, David Eltis and David Richardson decided to combine their studies of the transatlantic slave trade and their data collection efforts into one database, which they posted on the internet.\n\n‘Great House,’ her third novel, was a finalist for a National Book Award for Fiction, short-listed for the Orange Prize, and featured on the cover of the New York Times Book Review.\n\nA graduate of Marquette University and the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, Stefaniak has taught in the Master of Fine Arts programs at Pacific University in Oregon and the University of Nebraska.\n\nWideman is a widely celebrated author.

In addition, the novel was short listed for the Man Booker Prize and was selected by The New York Times as one of the 10 Best Books of 2005.\n\n‘The Dew Breaker’ is a beautifully constructed novel that spirals back to the reformed prison guard at the end, while holding unanswered the question of redemption.\n\nThe word “macnolia,” he tellingly suggests, means “a Negro who spells and reads as well as [if not better than] any white”—and it gives him a convincing way to concentrate on an individual life while also exploring social attitudes and racial prejudices of Depression-era America.\n\nWard brings us back into Johnson’s life and times with exquisitely rendered details, and the fight scenes themselves are gripping: fights so bloody that referees have to change shirts midbout, for instance, and a manager who pulls a gun on his fighter to keep him from quitting.\n\nBerlin has long been concerned with studying what he termed the “striking diversity” in African-American life under slavery—a diversity that, he argues, is especially evident when one is attentive to differences over space and time.\n\nImpossible to rush through, “The Known World” is a complex, beautifully written novel with a large cast of characters, rewarding the patient reader with unexpected connections, some reaching into the present day.\n\nMore than anything, LeBlanc shows how demanding poverty is.

The novel is a chilling and tight monologue, a haunting expression of the protagonist’s isolation.\n\nThe story of life lived on both sides of the color line, McBride’s memoir gives equal space to the voice of his white mother […] and his own questions about navigating black identity as a mixed-race person.\n\nHe presents himself as an ardent critic of theories that contend that African Americans are subservient to white social infrastructures. Murray views African American culture as an advantageous extension of the American self.\n\nBell dips into the chaos like a colonial Bret Easton Ellis, providing us all the details with an almost deviant relish. It’s only when the noble slave Touissant Louverture takes control of the African mob that a bit of civility returns to the war-torn country.\n\nWhen everything breaks down in a neighborhood, how is a family or children supposed to proper? When the pipes and electricity don’t work, and asthma runs rampant because of an incinerator strategically placed in the poorest and weakest of places, how does the spirit survive?\n\nIn 1926 West, then living in New York among the luminaries of the Harlem Renaissance, shared second place honors with Zora Neale Hurston in a national writing competition organized by Opportunity, the magazine of the National Urban League.\n\nTimely in the subject of interracial love, this authentic, richly detailed novel plumbs sacrifice, fear, and the loss of one’s identity, bringing the anguish of the two young lovers to life.\n\nAs if reflecting the dislocations of his 1960s youth, Staples sketches numerous fragments: his older sister slipping toward delinquency, the challenge by bullies at a new school, the untimely shooting death of his cousin.\n\nTucker’s accessible book focuses on the intrusion of these “scientists” into public and political life, the methodological problems with their research, and often the politics which underpinned their work.\n\nHer stories celebrate, mourn, and honor Latinas, collectively and individually, and also consider the influential men in her own life: the author’s beloved, unknowable, philandering father; the first boy she loved; her heartbreakingly deteriorating grandfather.\n\nA work of keen scholarship that will appeal to the general reader responsive to graceful, lucid prose by an author with an eye for ironic situations and complex emotions.\n\nRon Takaki elevated and popularized the study of America’s multiracial past and present like no other scholar, and in doing so had an indelible impact on a generation of students and researchers across the nation and world.\n\nMy first memories are of a place called ‘Mbrom,’ a small neighborhood in Kumasi, capital of Asante, as that kingdom turned from being part of the British Gold Coast colony to being a region of the Republic of Ghana.\n\nHer work delves into the unheralded inner lives of women through chronicles of migration, urban dislocation and deprivation in borderland arroyos and urban barrios.

These tests, they argue, serve to maintain the status quo of unequal educational opportunities.\n\nAngela and I feel when we come back to the Western world that we’ve really lost the important rituals that teach us so many things. We really hope that our book will rekindle an awareness of these values as we all move into the millennium.\n\nMyrdal came to argue that the “Negro problem” was really a “white problem,” a moral dilemma of a most complex sort that had not only economic dimensions but cultural, political, and structural dimensions as well.\n\nChristianity, in the five centuries since its message was first carried to the peoples of the New World—and, in particular, to the natives and the transplanted Africans of English North America and the United States—has been fundamentally racist in its ideology, organization, and practice.\n\nHonour places each work in its social context, yet his study refuses to treat works of art merely as historical documents. Instead, it inquires into how social realities enable and constrain the possibilities of art.\n\nTold in an earthy and uncontrived dialect, these memorable poems offer, not remote, idealized victims, but American black women of the 19th century making folksong poetry out of a terrible destiny: to be denied freedom, dignity, and humanity.\n\nGates has been a central figure in opening the canon of American literature to include work of the highest quality not only by African Americans, but also by women, gays and lesbians, and other traditionally excluded writers.\n\nUsing oral histories and extensive archival research, George Lipsitz examines the culture of opposition through the events of Perry’s life of commitment and illumines the social and political changes and conflicts that have convulsed the United States during the past fifty years.\n\nThe Dreamtime of the Aborigines’ bark paintings, acrylics, ceremonial objects and sculptures is both the sacred, life-giving dimension of the present and the realm in which ancestral spirits roam the landscape.\n\nMyths, legends, and songs are explained and depicted, and there is a special emphasis on the Maya’s weaving, the one art form to have persisted virtually unchanged throughout the last 2000 years.\n\nIn her novels and short stories Gordimer has captured the “flesh and blood of individual behavior” in minute and sentient detail, chronicling daily life in South Africa under apartheid, and portraying the human face of resistance.\n\nAbove all, Morrison is known for her rich, lyrical prose, which fuses the rhythms and imagery of African American speech and music with other literary influences to create a discourse of its own.\n\nThernstrom shows how a measure carefully crafted to open the polling booths to southern blacks has evolved into a powerful tool for affirmative action in the electoral sphere—a means to promote black and Hispanic office holding by creating “safe” seats for minority candidates.\n\nGail Sheehy has rocked the culture and changed the way millions of women and men around the world look at the stages of their lives.\n\nThis volume is an essential for kachina collectors. Author Barton Wright is known as the authority on Hopi kachinas and this book, his major work, shows why.\n\nIn this controversial work, he suggests, with good cause, that a combination of anti-Semitism and indifference to anything not perceived as being of direct strategic importance to the United States indirectly led to countless deaths.\n\nAlcina Franch developed an interest in archaeology, initially with a historical bias, soon to be transformed into a consideration of anthropology as a science.\n\nIt is his coming-of-age story, he notes, ‘the story of the scholarship boy who returns home one summer to discover the bewildering silence, facing his parents.

These basic principles become the means to understanding the form of human life that has been obscured by the developments and complications of societies during the last few thousand years.\n\nRichard Kluger provides the fullest possible view of the human and legal drama in the years before 1954, the cumulative assaults on the white power structure that defended segregation, and the step-by-step establishment of a team of inspired black lawyers that could successfully challenge the law.\n\nPersuaded that the enormity of a bygone injustice has been only partially perceived, I have taken upon myself the task of piecing together what might be called the ‘forgotten’ or ignored parts of the tapestry of those years.\n\nDawidowicz allows the coolly accumulated weight of detail—the growing force of the Nazi’s anti-Semitic juggernaut, the evolution of the camps as places of scientific murder, the efforts by the victims to hold onto fragments of normal life—to create its emotional and intellectual impact.\n\nParamount in his analysis is the importance of Islam, the principal Middle Eastern religion, and how it has helped mould the character and proclivities of the ‘elusive, self-contradictory Arab mentality.’\n\nThis is a necessary transcendence of many other historians’ dehumanizing view of both slaves and slaveholders, and to it Genovese brings his intellectual expansiveness and depth of feeling.\n\n‘Doctor and the Aborigines’ tells the story of Dr Duguids’ life, from his birth in Scotland to his eventual arrival in Australia, and then to taking up of the aboriginal cause the 1930’s.\n\nA profound and thorough interpretation of Wright’s work. It is at once affective and human, very moving and complete.

Braithwaite described feeling “caught like an insect in the tweezers grip of prejudice.” Teaching became the cure to set him free.\n\nIn defending his country, he was also surprised at how often the fact that he was an American seemed much more important than the color of his skin.\n\nDavidson traces the exciting development of the rich kingdoms of the lost cities of Africa, fifteen hundred years before European ships first came to African shores.\n\nValid analysis of prejudice and discrimination must rest squarely on broader principles of human behavior. Every proposition concerning intergroup relations should be harmonized with, in fact a part of, the general principles being developed in social science.\n\n‘White Mother’ is an unusual, colorfully told true tale that transcends the barriers of racial prejudice. It is the story of the power of love, one that will renew your faith in the inherent goodness of human nature.\n\nWith astonishing erudition, a commanding sense of style, and a gift for gripping narrative, Senhor Freyre has applied all the modern techniques of social study to the remarkably successful melting-pot culture of “medieval” Brazil.\n\nSaunders presents the book as a general account of Spanish-American culture “to enable professional people who work with members of the Spanish-speaking group to have some insights into factors that may underlie some of their behavior.” He succeeds admirably.\n\nAs a poet, playwright, fiction writer, autobiographer, and anthologist, Hughes captured the moods and rhythms of the black communities he knew and loved—and translated those rhythms to the printed page.\n\nMowat refers to himself as a “saga man,” or one who earns his living as a roving bard, retelling ancient tales in the Norse tradition.\n\nI write as an Asian, with all the pent-up emotions of my people. What I say will annoy many people who prefer the more conventional myths brought back by writers on the Orient. All I can say is that I try to tell the truth. Truth, like surgery, may hurt, but it cures.\n\nInstead, his venture to the interior is more existential, and he isn’t afraid to muse in the manner of St. Exupery—a refreshing break from much of today’s vapid extreme outdoor culture. [….] The book has a resonance beyond its clean, quiet prose—a kind of melancholic self-reflection.\n\nJohn Richard Hersey was a Pulitzer Prize-winning American writer and journalist considered one of the earliest practitioners of the so-called New Journalism, in which storytelling devices of the novel are fused with non-fiction reportage.\n\n‘In quick succession I knew the glory of motherhood and the pain of deep sorrow,’ she wrote later. ‘For the years immediately following, everything I did […] was motivated by my passionate desire to make a good life for my sons.’\n\nBy writing in the language of all Jews about everyday Jewish life, Sholem Asch, along with other pioneers of Yiddish literature, sought to preserve a sense of culture and community among his kinsmen despite their dispersal throughout the world and lack of a common homeland.\n\nKibbe called for a constitutional amendment prohibiting segregation and discrimination, the institutionalization of the GNC as a permanent state agency, the abolition of the poll tax, and the reapportionment of school funds. Everett Ross Clinchy, Jr., called the book ‘angry.’\n\nDrake and Cayton’s findings not only offer a generalized analysis of black migration, settlement, community structure, and black-white race relations in the early part of the twentieth century, but also tell us what has changed in the last hundred years and what has not.\n\nA decade before the wider white society had begun to think seriously about race relations, Stegner’s work targeted racial prejudice as one of the country’s most profound ills.\n\nWith rare perceptiveness, Gwethalyn Graham takes the reader into the lives of Erica Drake and Marc Reiser, whose two worlds are separated by families and conventions.

He felt he had an obligation to help the science in Poland recover from the ravages of the Second World War.\n\nThe central thesis of the book is that Haitian society is divided into two segments, the yeomanry and the elite, and that the national institutional structure has not allowed any alteration in that division in the course of Haiti’s history as a sovereign nation.\n\n‘No more school for me.
