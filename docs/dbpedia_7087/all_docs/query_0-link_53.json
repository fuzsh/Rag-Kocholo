        "text": "German Brand Award 2019 Gold & Winner\n\nAt the German Brand Award 2019, Richard Wolf received two awards in the category “Excellent Brands”. Richard Wolf was awarded “Gold” in the category “Excellent Brands – Health & Pharmaceuticals” and “Winner” in the category “Excellent Brands – Digital Brand of the Year”.\n\nThe German Brand Award recognizes a modern, successful market launch in Germany. It is awarded by the German Brand Institute, initiated by the German Design Council and the brand consultancy GMK Markenberatung. The German Brand Institute identifies, presents and awards excellent brands and brand makers. The panel is made up of high-ranking experts from brand economy and brand science.\n\nThe aim of the initiators is to boost the significance of the brand as a key success factor for companies in the national and international competitive environment. The foundation grants the German Brand Award as a unique prize in recognition of professional brand competence and quality in the Product and Corporate Brand category.\n\nOn June 6, 2019, representatives of the company received the prestigious prize at a celebratory gala.\n\n“Excellent brand work and, at the same time, a big, important step in strategic corporate communication,” was the jury's statement.\n\nRichard Wolf GmbH was awarded the title of “Global Market Leader 2018” in the segment “Products for Endoscopy and Endoscopic Imaging”.\n\nFor Richard Wolf, the last few years have been primarily shaped by the expansion of its global activities and the founding of new subsidiaries. For the globally active company, it is particularly important to found new subsidiaries in order to have a local presence in the most important markets. In recent years, the company has also undergone significant transformation in the field of communication. The Richard Wolf brand’s new position on the market has already had a positive effect on existing and potential customers’ perceptions. Over time, the brand has become a central building block of strategic company communications and has delivered a demonstrably positive impact on return on investment.\n\nRight from the start, Richard Wolf has built up core skills and extensive experience over many years in endoscopic products and systems that are designed for a wide variety of disciplines in human medicine. The company has already brought to market several innovative camera systems for endoscopic imaging in the past. The most recent addition to this is the ENDOCAM Logic 4K, which features ultra-advanced technology and full 4K resolution. The high-resolution imaging allows operators to identify even smaller and more delicate structures extremely clearly. The wealth of detail creates a visual impression that is so vivid, it provides the operator with a spatial orientation and a depth effect that are better than ever before.\n\nIn future, Richard Wolf will continue to focus on developing innovative and pioneering endoscopy products.\n\nThe medical technology company Richard Wolf, as part of the renowned `Deutschland-Test´ carried out by the well-known magazine \"Focus Money,\" was announced as the sector winner by a large margin, and may now bear the seal of \"Digital Champion\". What was found to be particularly striking was the strong general level of digitalization in the company and the high digital competence of its workforce.\n\nThe overall judgment: Richard Wolf has undertaken the challenges of digitalization more actively than any other company in the German medical technology market.\n\nWithin the medical technology industry, Richard Wolf, with 100 points, won first place and was named \"Digital Champion\" of the industry. Richard Wolf was evaluated as being particularly good in communication with customers and stakeholders. Over the last few years, the company's focus has been on expanding ways to digitally address customers, interested parties, and sales partners. In the re-launch of the new website and app, in addition to modern design, emphasis was placed on user-friendly operation, optimized presentation for various end devices, and discoverability in search engines. By creating an account on the Richard Wolf website and the app, prospective and existing customers and sales partners can gain access to extra content. Users can then benefit from adapted content tailored specifically to the relevant target group, as well as practical functions such as creating a wish list and sending download packages. In registering, the user also has the opportunity to sign up for the Richard Wolf newsletter as well as the e-learning tool.\n\nPress Release\n\nRichard Wolf GmbH has won the GERMAN MEDICAL AWARD in the category “Medical Communication Award”. On 25 November 2017, the gala presentation of the award was held at the Sheraton Grand Hotel Esplanade in Berlin with guests from medicine, business and government. Instrument maker Richard Wolf was privileged to be present at the ceremony to accept the award.\n\nRichard Wolf received the accolade of the “Medical Communication Award” for the company’s brand strategy.\n\nThe medicine and management prize – GERMAN MEDICAL AWARD is bestowed on innovative physicians, medical practices, hospitals and research projects, companies and organizations, which are committed to sustainable improvement of quality in medical provision for patients.
