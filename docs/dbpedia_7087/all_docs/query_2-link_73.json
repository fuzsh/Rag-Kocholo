The prize is awarded to the paper that best demonstrates an anthropological approach to the study of work in the tradition of political-economic scholarship modeled and encouraged by Eric Wolf.\n\nPast recipients\n\nThe Conrad M. Arensberg Award recognizes outstanding contributions to the anthropology of work, from inside the discipline and beyond. Since 2002, it has been awarded in even-numbered years.\n\nPast recipients\n\nThe Diana Forsythe Prize celebrates the best book or series of published articles in the spirit of Diana Forsytheâs feminist anthropological research on work, science, and/or technology, including biomedicine.
