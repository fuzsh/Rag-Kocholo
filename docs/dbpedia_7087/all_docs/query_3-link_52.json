        "text": "Dr. Richard M. Wolf studied at Antioch College for his B.A. and at the University of Buffalo for his Ed.M. He spent some time as a teacher in the Central Schools in Clarence, New Yorkâ€”an experience that served him in good stead for his work as a researcher.\n\nIn 1962, Dr. Wolf was a graduate student in the Measurement, Evaluation and Statistical Analysis (MESA) program at the University of Chicago, studying under Dr. Benjamin Bloom, one of the founding fathers of the IEA. Dr. Bloom appointed Dr. Wolf to be in charge of data processing for the First International Mathematics Study, which had just begun. In addition to this work, Dr. Wolf also conducted many of the analyses and interpretations for Dr. Bloom's book Stability and Change in Human Characteristics. Upon the completion of his doctoral thesis on the relationship between home environments and achievement, Dr. Wolf took up a position as an assistant professor at the School of Education at the University of Southern California in 1965. In 1968 he became an associate professor of psychology and education at the Teachers College of Columbia University. He served as Chair of the Department of Measurement, Evaluation and Statistics for 12 years and retired in 1998.\n\nDr. Wolf was the United States General Assembly representative for IEA from 1976 to 1990, an individual member of IEA, and the Chair of the IEA Publications and Editorial Committee from 1983 until his death. In 1977, Dr. Wolf wrote a national report Achievement in America, and, in 1979, he authored the textbook Evaluation in Education, considered a classic in the field. In addition to his extensive publication record, he has also helped national and international organizations in the areas of nursing, medical education, and accounting, and was a consultant to business and industry on a variety of measurement, evaluation, and data analytic matters. He continued to publish until his death.\n\nDr. Wolf passed away in Larchmont, New York, on 17 June 2004."
