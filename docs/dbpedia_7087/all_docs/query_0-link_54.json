        "text": "I will attend the II Conesul Symposium on Biomolecular Simulation meeting in Buenos Aires, Argentina (https://lnkd.in/eGwF7EMZ), August 8-10 and give a talk \"How artificial intelligence is reshaping protein structure prediction and therapeutic design - from small molecules to new modalities\". Registration and Abstract deadline is coming up June 30th! The meeting is intended to bring together researchers and fellows from different countries of the Southern Cone who develop their research in the area of biomolecular simulation, including the areas of molecular dynamics, quantum-classical hybrid models, coarse-grained models, drug design and bioinformatics.\n\n🗣️ We are looking forward to hosting Prof. @Peter G. Schultz (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA) with an invited lecture \"Playing with the Molecules of Life\": \"Our research program combines the tools and principles of chemistry with the molecules and processes of living cells to synthesize new molecules and molecular assemblies with novel physical, chemical and biological functions. By studying the structure and function of the resulting molecules, new insights can be gained into the mechanisms of complex biological and chemical systems. Examples will include our work on an expanded genetic code, chimeric RNA-DNA bacterial genomes, laboratory-based evolution of mitochondria, and bacteria with synthetic cell wall crosslinks.\" Learn more at ► https://lnkd.in/dZMVWPGD ⤵ Find the next #IOCBInvitedLecture ► https://lnkd.in/dzHMFX4X ⤵\n\nI'm thrilled to announce that my first scientific paper has been published! 🎉 This achievement is the result of months of hard work, research, and dedication. 💪 The paper, 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝗡𝘂𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗣𝗼𝗹𝘆𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗽𝗵𝗶𝗰 α-𝗦𝘆𝗻𝘂𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗶𝗻 𝗗𝗶𝗺𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗗𝗲𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗱𝘀 𝗼𝗻 𝗖𝗼𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗿 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗗𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗿-𝗕𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗦𝗶𝘁𝗲, explores the interactions of a-Synuclein dimers with copper, which are directly linked to the pathology of 𝗣𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗶𝗻𝘀𝗼𝗻'𝘀 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲.

It was my first bigger conference talk in front of 100+ people of my peers and it was very inspiring presenting amongst PIs and PostDocs. Thanks to everyone for an engaging conference and fascinating discussions. #Phytochromes #ilCiocco #StructuralBiochemistry\n\nCelebrating Four Great Scientists and Chemists Today, let's celebrate the birthdays and accomplishments of four remarkable scientists whose work has significantly shaped modern chemistry and biology. 👨🔬 1) Francis Crick (Born 1916) Crick, alongside James Watson, deciphered the double-helix structure of DNA, a discovery that earned him the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1962. This monumental finding has been fundamental in understanding genetic coding and heredity, laying the groundwork for modern genetics and biotechnology. 2) Jacques Dubochet (Born 1942) Dubochet's pioneering work in cryo-electron microscopy earned him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2017, allows scientists to visualize biomolecules in their native state at atomic resolution. This advancement has been critical in drug development, enabling the detailed study of protein structures and interactions, which is essential for designing targeted therapies. 3) John Roberts (Born 1918) Roberts made significant contributions to physical organic chemistry, focusing on reaction mechanisms, small-ring compounds, and the effects of substituents on reactivity. His insights help chemists design more effective and efficient synthetic routes for drug molecules. 4) Kenneth Geddes Wilson (Born 1936) Wilson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1982 for his work on phase transitions and the renormalization group. This knowledge aids in the development of new materials and pharmaceuticals, particularly in understanding how drugs interact with complex biological systems at different scales. #Chemistry #Biology #BioChemistry #Biotechnology #DNA #CryoElectroMicroscopy #SmallMolecules #TransitionGroups #RenormalizationGroups #Pharmaceutical #DrugDevelopment\n\nNominate a Fluorescence Applications Researcher for the 2024 Gregorio Weber Award!

Hello LinkedIn community, I am thrilled to share that I had the opportunity to attend a captivating talk by the esteemed Professor Morten Meldal (Nobel laureate in Chemistry 2022) at CSIR-IGIB on February 2, 2024. As a Structural Bioinformatician, I found immense inspiration in Prof. Meldal's groundbreaking work, particularly his contributions to the CuACC click reaction and the incorporation of molecular dynamics simulations in his recent projects. Prof. Morten Meldal 's expertise in the CuACC click reaction, a powerful tool for bioconjugation, opens up exciting possibilities in biology. The precision and efficiency of this reaction have far-reaching implications for studying molecular interactions, and beyond. Furthermore, his incorporation of molecular dynamics simulations in recent research is particularly intriguing. The ability to observe and analyze the dynamic behaviour of biomolecules at the atomic level provides invaluable insights for someone like me, working in the realm of structural bioinformatics. It enhances our understanding of biological systems and paves the way for designing targeted experiments and interventions. I am grateful for the opportunity to gain deeper insights into these methodologies and their applications during Prof. Meldal's talk. This event was a remarkable opportunity for knowledge exchange and networking. Kudos to CSIR-IGIB for hosting such impactful sessions, and a big thanks to Prof. Meldal for sharing his expertise! #StructuralBioinformatics #CuACCClickReaction #MolecularDynamics #CSIRIGIB #Bioinformatics #ScienceTalks #ResearchInnovation\n\nI'm very happy that this manuscript, which originated from my work during my previous position as a Ph.D. student, is finally out! Biochemistry is fascinating. Even in a constant environment, the concentrations of proteins and metabolites in a biological cell are constantly changing. Imagine a car in which the number of bolts, nuts, cylinders, speedometer readings, and every component you can imagine is constantly and randomly changing over time! Thanks to experiments in which we tracked single bacteria over time, and mathematical modeling, we now understand better why this is happening, and in addition what types of mechanisms our bacteria could employ to deal with this. This work, which will help us to better understand the fundamentals of biological regulation, was a wonderful interdisciplinary team effort by myself, Laurens Krah, Benjamin Towbin, Rutger Hermsen (Utrecht University) and Sander Tans (AMOLF).

With the grace of Almighty Iam thrilled to announce that My research article entitled \"Exploring the antibiofilm and toxicity of tin oxide nanoparticles: Insights from in vitro and in vivo investigations\" has been published in\"Microbial Pathogenesis\" journal with the IF-3. 8 This research delves into the antibiofilm properties and toxicity of tin oxide nanoparticles through in vitro and in vivo experiments. It aims to understand how these nanoparticles interact with biofilms and their potential impact on living organisms. The findings likely shed light on the efficacy of tin oxide nanoparticles against biofilms and their safety profile, including any adverse effects observed in living organisms. All thanks to Almighty, Guide, colleagues and friends for their constant support and encouragement. #alhamdulilah #publication #published #researcharticle #criteria #phD #الحمدللہ #velloreinstituteoftechnology #vitvellore\n\n✴️ I would like to share exciting news with you 🤩 This week I defended my master's thesis 🎉 🧑🔬 My science work was title as a question: \"Can modification of cisplatin molecule by flavonoid ligands improve the therapeuric effect of the drug?\" During my reaserch: ⚗️ I obtained three analogs of cisplatin and characterized them chemically 🧪 I conducted experiments on 3 different cell cultures to check their cytotoxicity in vitro 🧬 I examined the mechanism of activity of those compunds I can proundly say that results of my work are promising for future reaserch! 🤓"
