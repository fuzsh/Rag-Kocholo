As the Silver Wolf was a British National Award, Baden-Powell was later asked to create a special award to recognise this service. This led to the establishment of the Bronze Wolf Award in 1935.\n\nPast Awardees\n\nFor nearly 90 years, the Bronze Wolf Award has been given to incredible Scouts who have dedicated themselves to the ideals and values of the Movement.
