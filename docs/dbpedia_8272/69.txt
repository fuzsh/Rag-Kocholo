Investigative reporter Joe Strombel (Ian McShane) has just been handed the best “Scoop” of his career: Lord Lyman’s son Peter (Hugh Jackman), a rising politician, may be involved with the “Tarot Card Murders,” a series of Jack the Ripper type murders that have been plaguing London residents. This is a great story, the type of story a reporter can’t wait to write. The only problem is Strombel got the story after he died and now he has to hunt for a reporter that can follow up on his leads and bring the story to the press. In a twist of fate that can only happen in a Woody Allen film, the dead reporter contacts Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson), a college student reporter, while she is participating in a magic trick performed by a magician, Sid Waterman (Allen). Pransky then investigates the murder and Peter Lyman, who she can’t help fall in love with.

“Scoop,” written and directed by Woody Allen, is a wonderful story with great locations and talented actors. Allen and Johansson have an easy chemistry; they act as if they have been friends for years. Jackman’s character is charming and kind, a retrospect from old films where the mystery man was a regular guy with a secret. Much like Rex Harrison in “Midnight Lace” or Ray Milland in “Dial M For Murder.”

There are no special effects, no one fires a gun and even the gory facts of the murders are not paraded across the screen. The laughs come from Allen’s observation of the situation, which means you really have to listen to the dialogue. This film is for those who want to watch a story unfold through acting and dialogue. The story has a beginning, middle and an end, an unusual occurrence with the tendencies for sequels in Hollywood today.

Films with pirate adventures or spelunking dangers are fun but for those who would like to just watch a clever story well told, this film is for you.

“Scoop” stars Hugh Jackman, Scarlett Johansson, Ian McShane and Woody Allen. It is written and directed by Woody Allen.
