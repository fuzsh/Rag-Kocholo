This one missed us by. It still seems a bit weird, but it looks like Scoop, the 2006 film written and directed by Woody Allen, is out on DVD for the first time in the UK. Of course, the film that stars Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson was filmed in the UK.

The DVD set comes from Icon Distribution and was released on 9th February 2015.

Scoop has a strange history in the UK, and was part financed by the BBC and first released on TV. Despite the big stars, it was never released on DVD in the UK until now.

The new DVD has a slightly different cover from the other versions. It kind of looks like they’ve used an approximation of the Woody Allen font (Windsor light) as the logo.

You can buy the new DVD at Amazon UK

As Sondra and Sidney try to uncover whether there is any truth to these claims, Sondra begins to fall in love with the suspect, British aristocrat Peter Lyman (Jackman)…
