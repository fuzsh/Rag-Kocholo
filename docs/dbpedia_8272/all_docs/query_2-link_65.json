        "text": "The English actor Ian McShane guest-starred in Sunday night’s episode of Game of Thrones, playing Brother Ray, a philosophical reformed killer who is ultimately himself killed. He’s there to help reform the Hound — the Hound being Sandor Clegane, who last appeared in the show’s fourth season.\n\n“I think my main use was to re-introduce a character people thought was long gone and who needed some humanity,” McShane told Entertainment Weekly. “The Hound has not been shown much humanity in his life, and he gets a little from Brother Ray and carries that forward into his character, which makes it more interesting for those who watch him.”"
