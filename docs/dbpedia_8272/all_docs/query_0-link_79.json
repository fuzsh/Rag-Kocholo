        "text": "With the sexist, contrived and bland “Scoop,” Woody Allen shows almost as much disregard for journalism as he had for step-parenting. What was Allen thinking when he wrote this London-set picture about a bubbly American college journalism student (Scarlett Johansson of “Lost in Translation”) who embarks on her first big assignment to interview a rock star, sleeps with him right away and then forgets to ask him any questions? Soon after, she’s involved in writing an investigative story that could identify a wealthy British aristocrat (Hugh Jackman of “X-Men: The Last Stand”) as a serial killer.\n\nHow does she get to the bottom of that mystery? She handles him in a similar fashion – and learns nothing.\n\nAllen obviously intended “Scoop” as a bubbly, 1930s’-type picture with snappy dialogue, outlandish twists and romantic contrivances, but one walks away wondering how the Oscar-winning filmmaker (“Annie Hall”) could put so much effort into something so slight.\n\nIn the PG-13 picture, aspiring journalist Sondra Pransky (Johansson) is visiting wealthy friends in London and attends a show in which American magician Sid Waterman (Allen) asks for a volunteer from the audience. Pransky steps forward, is placed in a box that’s supposed to make her disappear and while inside is visited by the spirit of Joe Strombel (Ian McShane of HBO’s “Deadwood”), a hardnosed reporter who died while following a hot tip to the identity of the Tarot Card Killer who preys on young brunettes.\n\nPransky convinces Waterman to help her follow the tips from the ghostly Strombel, leading them to Peter Lyman (Jackman), a handsome bachelor of royal blood. Strombel insists that Lyman is the guilty party, something that the American woman finds hard to believe as she falls under his romantic spell.\n\nAllen works in some tributes to Alfred Hitchcock’s “Frenzy” (1972), a thriller about a London strangler who preys on women, but everything in it registers as more forced than funny.\n\nThe 70-year-old Allen and the 21-year-old Johansson teamed successfully as director and star in the acclaimed drama about fate and greed, “Match Point,” also shot in London, and it was hoped that their second joint effort would bring out the best in both of them. Instead, the simplistic “Scoop” often causes Johansson to look foolish, and most of the time makes Allen’s humor seem more dated than a Smith Corona antique typewriter.\n\nFILM REVIEW\n\n“Scoop”\n\nGrade: C-\n\nStarring: Scarlett Johansson, Hugh Jackman, Ian McShane and Woody Allen; produced by Jack Rollins and Charles H. Joffe; written and directed by Allen.\n\nRunning Time: 96 minutes.\n\nParental Guide: PG-13 rating (sexual content, adult themes).\n\nWeb site: scoopmovie.net."
