        "text": "I was startled to read that you were in the original cast of Joe Orton's Loot. What are your memories of that?\n\nIt was amazing. We did a six-week pre-West End tour, and like a lot of productions, they fucked up the author's second play. They tried to make it into, \"Oooh it's the second great play\" instead of just doing the play. They tried to dress it up and get a fancy director in Peter Wood, and I didn't think he knew what he was doing. The star was the wonderful English comic Kenneth Williams. It was a great cast. Geraldine McEwan played the nurse, a Scottish comic Duncan McCrae was in it. I played Hal. But there was a lot of insecurity, and people were constantly bitching that it wasn't funny enough. It's a very difficult play; instead of playing it as black comedy they kept arguing about it.\n\nWhat was Joe Orton like?\n\nHe was incredible. He would just keep giving them sheaves of lines, more and more stuff. \"How's this?\" He was totally unfazed by any of the kerfluffle that went on. Eventually we died in Wimbledon; instead of going into the West End, they decided the production wasn't going to go anywhere. I always thought it was an opportunity missed, and it didn't surprise me that a year later they did exactly the same play with a cast of relatively unknown people, like an off-off-Broadway play, and it was a huge hit in the West End. Kenneth Cranham played my part and he's going to be playing Max in The Homecoming next year at the Almeida in London.\n\nTell me about your experience with The Witches of Eastwick.\n\nThat taught me a lot. It taught me never to do a musical again [laughs]. I say that glibly, but it was a sadly missed opportunity. I'd never done a musical, so when they ask you to do it, you jump and think, \"That's going to be great.\" But I don't think the book was ever strong enough and the director [Eric Schaeffer] wasn't strong enough. It was one of those \"too many cooks spoil the broth.\" I think you have to have one strong hand at the helm.\n\nHad you been known as a singer?\n\nNo, but I did an album when my [British TV] series Lovejoy was on called Both Sides Now. You can probably find it on K-Tel [laughs]. They gave me a gold record for it! I had sung in TV shows; I had done a black comedy about a crooner, and early on I did a thing about a rock-and-roller, so I could carry a tune, but a musical is different. I just felt that The Witches of Eastwick was never dark enough all around. It should have been a lot nastier, and at the end, with musicals, they tend to throw everything in. You want to say, \"Why don't you throw in another kitchen sink and see if that works?\" Also, they didn't concentrate on the acting. You'd have to say, \"Excuse me, can we go into the part where people talk to each other? I know you want to have this little dance there, but there are times when people do need to speak, particularly in The Witches of Eastwick.\" But we did okay; it ran for a year, playing to about 80 percent in a barn of a theater. It's good for your soul to have done something like that, so you never look at anything as a disaster. It was enormously instructive for me to have worked in that milieu.\n\nLet's talk about Deadwood, a show that became a cult hit. Did your scary performance in Sexy Beast lead HBO to cast you as Al Swearengen?\n\nI'm sure the casting people who suggested me for the part had that in mind. David Milch wasn't looking for me to play the lead in the show, but they couldn't find an American. I read the script, and when they said, \"Walter Hill is directing it and David Milch wrote the script for HBO,\" I said, \"Jesus!\"\n\nDid you realize that Deadwood would be a something special?\n\nI knew that we'd done something good, but you can never foretell the reaction. The actors were extraordinary; some of them came to the theater the other night and we went out. It was a really great group of people, rather like this one [in The Homecoming]. They parked their egos at the door when they went into that soundstage in the desert. We had a great time.\n\nI always thought the name \"Swearengen\" was a joke [since the character cursed constantly]. But I read that he was a real person.\n\nAnd he had a twin brother. Can you imagine? I said. \"Don't even go there!\"\n\nDid you have any idea that the character would be hailed as TV's \"sexiest villain\" in People magazine?\n\nNo, no. It's hilarious all that, isn't it? Rolling Stone called me, what was it? \"Hot barkeep\"? They'll invent anything to sell a magazine [laughs].\n\nWhen Deadwood was canceled abruptly, there was talk of a couple of two-hour films to tie up loose ends. Will those ever get made?\n\nI have no idea, I truly don't. One would like to think so, but I wouldn't hold my breath. David's got a new series that he's working on, a 1970s New York cop show; he always had other series in the works. [HBO] didn't expect the disappointed response when Deadwood was dropped by some number-crunching idiots.\n\nYou obviously enjoy working in America—you've gone back and forth for your whole career.\n\nIt's like having the best of both worlds. I've produced and starred in TV there [in England], but at the moment, America is my favorite. I think the quality of work here is better. American TV—I'm talking about cable—has been of the highest quality for the past few years. Shows like The Wire, The Sopranos, Dexter, Sex and the City in a different kind of way—they're much superior to what is crossing the channel the other way.\n\nIn many cases these days, TV is better than feature films.\n\nFilm studios are not studios anymore, they're conglomerates, and they just produce product. The director is not king anymore. Nobody is king; nobody knows who's making the movie, whereas on TV the writer is the king."
