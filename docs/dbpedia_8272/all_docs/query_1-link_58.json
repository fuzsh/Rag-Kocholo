        "text": "Many of the devoted fans remember the first three Pirates of the Caribbean movies with fondness. The lovable antics of Captain Jack Sparrow kept fans begging for more.\n\nHowever, at the end of the third movie, it was widely acknowledged that the saga would end there.\n\nSurprising the rest of the world, Jack Sparrow is back. The favorite of many Pirates fans, Sparrow is one of the many reasons for seeing this new movie, which will open on May 20.\n\nThe fourth movie “Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tide” focuses on the same theme the previous movies focused on: cheating death.\n\nWithout the charming romance of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan, played by Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly, the pirates cast has received many new comers. Among these are Penelope Cruz and Ian McShane, who will be playing Angelica and Black Beard.\n\nBlack Beard is a universally recognized pirate from the 18th century, who sailed around the West Indies and the East American colonies. Cruz plays Black Bear’s rebellious daughter, who has a romantic history with Captain Jack.\n\nThe new movie will explore more pirate myths and with the help of Johnny Depp, it’s sure to be a hysterical adventure.\n\n[media-credit id=13 align=”alignleft” width=”275″] [creative commons]"
