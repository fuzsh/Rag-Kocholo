        "text": "Share this Article:\n\nWith cameras rolling this week, the upcoming John Wick spin-off Ballerina is bringing Keanu Reeves and Ian McShane along. The John Wick universe continues to expand, as the series first spin-off, Ballerina went into production in Prague yesterday. On top of that, John Wick: Chapter 4 is on the way and will arrive in March. Furthermore, we have the TV series prequel spin-off, The Continental which, it was recently announced, will be airing on Amazon Prime Video here in the UK. Whilst we are somewhat curious about the latter project, we’re definitely liking the sound of the series’ first movie spin-off, Ballerina. Not only does the project boast a brilliant lead in the form of Ana de Armas, but Promising Young Woman's Emerald Fennell has co-written the script. There’s more too. It has now been announced that both Keanu Reeves and Ian McShane will both be appearing in the film as Wick and Winston respectively. Whether their appearances are quick cameos or more extended parts, we don’t know, but the project will surely earn a little more juice by including appearances from the series’ two biggest hitters. With Reeves in the Czech Republic shooting for the film as we speak, it will be interesting to see just how long the actor is out there for as it will give us an idea as to the size of his role. Still, even before his involvement was announced, this looked set to be a project to watch and we’re excited to see how this one develops. We’ll bring you more as we hear it.
