        "text": "Ian McShane—former Deadwood star, current American Gods star, and forever the guy who summed up Game of Thrones by reminding us not to get worked up about the show, because “it’s only tits and dragons”—is teasing details from the upcoming Deadwood movie, which will bring him back to South Dakota as saloon and brothel proprietor Al Swearengen. When asked how the film will end, the actor also teased the possibility of a second Deadwood movie down the line.\n\nThe original series, which ran for three seasons on HBO from 2004 to 2006, was a Western set in 1870s South Dakota; it was named for the real-life mining camp Deadwood, and characters including McShane’s Swearengen, Timothy Olyphant’s Sheriff Seth Bullock, John Hawkes’s Sol Star, and Gerald McRaney’s villainous mining mogul George Hearst were based on real people. The film will jump ahead one decade from where the series left off in its finale.\n\nAt T.C.A., McShane teased the film to Deadline: “Deadwood is celebrating South Dakota as a state, and Hearst has come back and Alma has come back in town, so you have all the main characters converging and how they changed in 10 years,” McShane said. (When we last saw George and Alma, George had forced Alma to sell her bank to him and flee the camp.) “Now Hearst wants to put telegraphs in town, which isn’t going too well,” McShane continued. “Al has had a little bit too much of that over the years. There’s a surprise for Trixie and Star.” (Trixie was one of Al’s favorite girls at his saloon/brothel the Gem; in Season 2, she entered into a relationship with Sol Star, which lasted through the end of the series.)\n\nWhen the show first ended back in 2006, two films were already in the works—but they never materialized, and for years it seemed they had been scrapped completely. Now, fans can at least rest assured they’ll get one film in spring. “It ends leaving you wondering,” McShane said of the upcoming film’s ending—adding that there is always a chance that a second movie could also see the light of day: “If it makes $115M, HBO will somehow find a way to do another one.”\n\nMore Great Stories from Vanity Fair\n\n— The worst-kept secret of Trump’s presidency\n\n— Is Silicon Valley suffocating the media?
