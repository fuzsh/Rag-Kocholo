        "text": "Today marks the 10th anniversary of Woody Allen’s murder mystery romp, Scoop. The film followed the darkly sexy Match Point, reuniting the director with star Scarlett Johansson. Unfortunately, critics and audiences were less dazzled by the pair’s second feature together, and Scoop joined the ranks of Allen’s lesser films.\n\nStill, I have a soft spot for this quirky little film. It’s not perfect, but it’s a fun; a confection (more dessert than entree). It’s a movie you can put on in the background while working on a project or as a pick-me-up after a bad day. So in honor of its anniversary, here are ten things to love about the mostly unloved Scoop.\n\n10 THINGS TO LOVE ABOUT SCOOP\n\nby Steven Fenton\n\n10. GILES!\n\nEveryone’s favorite Watcher (Anthony Stewart Head), appears in a brief cameo as a detective interviewing Peter Lyman. It always a thrill to see that discerning furrowed brow.\n\n09. THE IMPERFECT SCIENCE OF MAKING SCARLETT NERDY\n\nJohansson’s Sondra Pransky attends a swanky London party in a little black dress and...a scrunchie! Carrie Bradshaw would die. The costumers had the unenviable task of making Scarlett Johnasson a nerd. They put her in wire-rim glasses, frumpy brown capris, and truly unflattering button-downs. Their attempts do nothing to mitigate Scarlett’s sex appeal, but it’s a delight watching them try...\n\n8. HUGH JACKMAN: BEYOND GREEN SCREEN\n\nFollowing his Tony (The Boy From Oz) and Emmy (for hosting the Tonys) wins, Jackman’s acting career faltered. After the one-two punch of critically panned Van Helsing and X-Men: The Last Stand, the Aussie superstar needed to reset and Scoop offered him that chance. It was a nice change to see him act alongside non-CG humans and flash that 1000-watt smile. He should do it more often.\n\n7. THE SCENES OF THE CRIMES\n\nMaria Djurkovic (Production Design), Nick Palmer (Art Direction), and Philippa Hart (Set Decoration), are the unsung heroes of Scoop. They showcase elegantly appointed homes that capture the difference between traditional, rural and modern, urban English life. They brighten their sets with sprays of gorgeous flowers, and created an appropriately amateur stage set for Sidney, that still manages to be cinematic in scale.\n\n6. DEATH BECOMES HIM\n\nThe great Ian McShane plays recently deceased reporter Joe Strombel. When we meet Joe, he is on a ferry traveling down the river Styx, reminding viewers of the Greek chorus in Mighty Aphrodite. Without this element, Scoop would be a simple whodunit with a plucky heroine, but bringing in the supernatural lends the film just the right amount of zany.\n\n5. HANDSOME HUGH\n\n(Yes he gets two top ten placements) Hugh Jackman looks. so. good. in this movie. The film goes out of its way to point out his dashing good looks and Sondra is blinded by his beauty. I can’t recall any recent performances where Jackman looked this suave. Could Scoop really be the last time he played Contemporary Handsome?\n\n4. “AND NOW YOU’RE GOING TO HAVE TO DROWN”\n\nWhile on a romantic boat ride, the cheery music screeches to a halt when Peter announces his plan to kill Sondra. Allen’s films always make great use of classical works, but I particularly love the way he plays with music in Scoop. In another film, Peter’s confession would make for a spine tingling moment, but with the accompaniment, it’s played to hilarious effect.\n\n3. SCREWBALL SCARLETT\n\n2006 was a strange period in Johansson’s career. With her early well-received performances behind her, she had dipped her toe into the unforgiving waters of stardom. At this point, we’d seen Scarlett be serious, stoic, sexy, and sociopathic, but Scoop gave us Screwball Scarlett. Yes, there are some awkward line readings, but overall Johansson showed major comedic promise. It wasn’t until Don Jon, that she really took hold of the skills first showcased here.\n\n2. JOKES ON JOKES\n\nIt’s debateable where Scoop ranks in Allen’s filmography, but I’d argue it contains some of his best banter from recent work:\n\nSidney: I was in the lounge. I heard you drowning. I finished my tea and scones and came immediately!\n\nSondra: You are a cynical crapehanger who always sees the glass half-empty!\n\nSidney: I see the glass half full, but of poison\n\nSondra: I wouldn’t be surprised if he asked me to marry him someday.\n\nSidney: You come from an orthodox family. Would they accept a serial killer?\n\n1. SIDNEY WATERMAN\n\nAfter starring in his own work for much of his career, Woody began limiting his on-screen roles around this time. He’ll often use a nebbish stand-in for parts he might have previously played. With Scarlett filling that role, Allen had to do something different with Sidney Waterman. At his core, Sidney is a mensch with a heart of gold. His crotchety nature is chipped away as he grows more fond of Sondra. It’s rare for Allen to cast himself as a mentor, but Sidney suits him. Personal feelings about him aside, he’s charming in the role, and I’d argue it’s one of his best performances."
