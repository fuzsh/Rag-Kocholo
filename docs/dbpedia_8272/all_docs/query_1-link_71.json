Universal will release the film in theaters June 1, 2012.\n\nRelativity Moves Up Snow White Film to March to Beat Universal\n\nMcShane will play Caesar, the leader of the dwarfs. Universal is in the process of casting the rest of his crew. With Universal and Relativity Media racing separate Snow White projects into theaters next year (Relativity’s untitled project also is ramping up production and is currently set to hit theaters in March), there could be serious competition to find strong character actors to fill the roles.\n\n‘Thor’ Star Chris Hemsworth in Talks to Join Kristen Stewart in ‘Snow White and the Huntsman’\n\nMcShane, repped by ICM, Gallant Management, Independent Talent, and attorney Mark Wetzstein, is currently shooting Bryan Singer and New Line’s Jack the Giant Killer, in which he plays a benevolent king."
