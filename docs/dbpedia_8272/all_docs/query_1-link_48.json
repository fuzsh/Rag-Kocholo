        "text": "You would think a film about getting the scoop on a mass serial killer would be anything but entertaining and hilarious, but in Woody Allen’s new film Scoop, those words were exactly what came to my mind after I saw the screening. It was truly a joy to watch Johansson (playing ditzy college journalism student) banter on stage with Woody (a crazy magician named Splendini), trying to find the mysterious Tarot Card Killer who they got a lead on from the late Ian McShane (world-renowned journalist).\n\nUnfortunately, the suspect is one of London’s most beloved aristocrats played by Hugh Jackman. Through their investigation, and consequently snowballed lies, Johansson and Woody investigate Jackman’s personal life, but unfortunately that comes with a price and instead of finding out more information on Jackman, Johansson begins to fall head-over-heels for him. While watching the film, I had wondered what inspired Woody to create such a light-hearted film about a murderer, because even in the film you never really see what goes on behind the murders (although we do get close to a victim's apartment door). But the thing is, the focus isn’t really on who the murderer is, but the chase involved for a great story and a blossoming fraudulent father/daughter relationship. You wish that you could hang out with Woody and hear his comedic magic tricks all day, laughing your butt off while he’s telling you how wonderful you are and how much he loves you. Even the setting of the film is done perfectly: subtle, seductive, and moody. Set in London, Woody commented that he loved the natural lighting over there, which is always cloudy and gray. But, genius as he is, it truly added to the ambiance of the different scenes which moved back and forth between the hunt for clues about the Tarot Card Killer (Johansson and Woody), to the connection between Johansson and Jackman as lovers; two different moods in one cloudy atmosphere.\n\nSo humorous and witty, Woody keeps you guessing right till the end and even then you can’t help but laugh at how everything turns out. This trio of characters, with the help of their ghost (McShane) exude how truly sticky the inside scoop of any story can get."
