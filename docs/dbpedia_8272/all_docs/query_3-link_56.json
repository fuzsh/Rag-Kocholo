        "text": "The real question is: what do you know Ian McShane from? Trust me, you have seen him in something. His presence always looms large, whether it’s in Game of Thrones, Deadwood, Pirates of the Caribbean, or his legendary work in the John Wick series, you never forget Ian McShane. His newest film American Star is some of his best work yet. McShane plays a hitman, taking one more job before he hangs up his gun, but when he gets too close to someone in town, things become complicated. I was incredibly grateful to get to chat with Ian, where he talks about getting his start as an actor, working with director Gonzalo López-Gallego, playing a cold killer, and being best friends with the legendary John Hurt.
