        "text": "Featured Blu-ray and DVD Review: John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum\n\nSeptember 2nd, 2019\n\nThe John Wick franchise has experienced phenomenal growth. The second film earned more domestically than the first film earned worldwide. Meanwhile, John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum earned more worldwide than the first two films combined. Is the franchise also experiencing high quality? Or should fans of these movies be worried about the upcoming fourth film?

It wasn’t a particularly good year for high quality monster hits. Sadly, TV on DVD releases look even worse. That’s not to say there were no good TV shows that debuted last year; however, there haven’t been many TV shows that made their DVD / Blu-ray debuts recently.

My favorite truly new show was GLOW, but again, there’s no DVD / Blu-ray release yet. Likewise, Stranger Things has no regular Blu-ray release. You know what, just assume anything from Netflix isn’t on this list, because there’s no DVD / Blu-ray, or the release is nearly featureless (as is the case with Jessica Jones). On a side note, my favorite new non-screening show was Speechless, which again has no DVD / Blu-ray release, so it’s not just Netflix that’s ignoring physical media. There are also not a lot of megasets to compensate, meaning this list might be a bit short compared to most years. I’ve even had to break my usual rule when it comes to megasets.
