        "text": "Welcome to “Not Couple Goals” where co-hosts Allie Nelson and Tyler McCarthy do a deep dive into a different ridiculous romantic thriller from the vantage point of their long-term relationship.\n\nAllie, a TV writer/producer and actress, has an affinity for romantic thrillers, the more salacious the better. Tyler, an entertainment reporter and critic, often finds himself drawn in despite his better judgment. Join them as they explore all the ways it’s possible to love too hard… like WAY too hard.\n\nIn this episode, Allie and Tyler tackle the 2006 movie Scoop starring Scarlett Johansson, Hugh Jackman and, unfortunately, Woody Allen. Don’t worry, though, they have nothing but bad things to say about him. Join them as they unapologetically lambaste this under-baked monstrosity and do some pretty fantastic impressions. Will Allen’s career ever recover from their mockery? Let’s hope not.\n\nScoop also stars Ian McShane (John Wick), Charles Dance (Game of Thrones), Julian Glover (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade), and Anthony Stewart Head (Buffy the Vampire Slayer).\n\nSpecial thanks to Mallory Johns for the introduction music.\n\nTo see more of our hosts, check out Tyler’s writing at USA Insider, SYFY and NBC Insider. Find Allie’s work at Parade and Business Insider!\n\nAnd don’t forget to follow us on social media —\n\nAllie: Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and TikTok\n\nTyler: Twitter"
