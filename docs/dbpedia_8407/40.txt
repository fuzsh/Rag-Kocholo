Population development in Spain since 1960

(Data in millions of inhabitants) Population figures in Spain vary greatly compared with other western industrialized nations. While the population grew at a largely constant rate until 1980, growth slowed considerably until the beginning of this millennium. From 2002 to 2008, there was a sharp increase, which was partly due to a rising birth rate. A major factor at that time, however, was an excessively high proportion of immigrants. In just a few years, more than 5 million foreigners moved to Spain. From today's perspective, the migrant share of 14.1 % of the total population, although increased, is still largely moderate. Before that, however, relatively few residents of foreign origin lived permanently in the country. Just a few years later, from 2013 to 2015, the population actually declined. This is an effect that rarely occurs in Europe.

Risk of aging and depopulation

The majority of today's 48.37 million Spaniards are between 40 and 60 years old. This means that there is a high risk of ageing in the coming decades. Many Spaniards will retire in the next few years, while the younger generations are already insufficient in number to fill the pension coffers. The birth rate has been declining for decades; since 2011 it has been below 10%, and most recently only 7.1%. This is one of the lowest birth rates in the European Union. Four decades ago, there were over 3 births per woman of childbearing age, but today there are only 1.16 births. This is also a strikingly low figure compared with other countries. According to the experts, the optimum fertility rate is 2.1. In comparison, the mortality rate (apart from the Covid years 2020 and 2021) is almost constant at around 9 percent. However, this figure is likely to increase in the coming decades.

Demographic forecasts today predict that Spain's population will fall drastically in the coming years. Around 90% of the population now lives in about 30% of the country's land area. Rural exodus is a major issue, thousands of villages in the interior of the country have already been abandoned and the metropolitan areas around Bilbao, Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia are becoming larger but also more expensive. Already today, the effects are also evident in an exodus to other countries. By 2035, some demographers predict that there will be 1 million fewer inhabitants in the country.

Annual growth rates in percent

On average, 2.5 people live together per household in Spain.

Birth and death rate in Spain

Population growth is the result of the birth rate, the mortality rate and the migration rate. For example, the year 2021 in the graph: The population in Spain increased by about 50,100 inhabitants. In the same year, the death rate was 9.5 per 1,000 people (~ 450,000 deaths) and the birth rate was 7.1 per 1,000 people (~ 336,000 births). As a result, around 164,100 inhabitants have to be added by migration from other countries.

Over the past 10 years, the number of average deaths per year was 422,369 in Spain. The number of births was 392,962 annually.

The changes in births and deaths is displayed in the following graph. All data refer to births or deaths per 1,000 inhabitants.
