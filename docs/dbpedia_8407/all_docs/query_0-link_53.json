        "meta_description": "Coastal zones are exposed to a range of coastal hazards including sea-level rise with its related effects. At the same time, they are more densely populated than the hinterland and exhibit higher rates of population growth and urbanisation. As this trend is expected to continue into the future, we investigate how coastal populations will be affected by such impacts at global and regional scales by the years 2030 and 2060. Starting from baseline population estimates for the year 2000, we assess future population change in the low-elevation coastal zone and trends in exposure to 100-year coastal floods based on four different sea-level and socio-economic scenarios. Our method accounts for differential growth of coastal areas against the land-locked hinterland and for trends of urbanisation and expansive urban growth, as currently observed, but does not explicitly consider possible displacement or out-migration due to factors such as sea-level rise. We combine spatially explicit estimates of the baseline population with demographic data in order to derive scenario-driven projections of coastal population development. Our scenarios show that the number of people living in the low-elevation coastal zone, as well as the number of people exposed to flooding from 1-in-100 year storm surge events, is highest in Asia. China, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Viet Nam are estimated to have the highest total coastal population exposure in the baseline year and this ranking is expected to remain largely unchanged in the future. However, Africa is expected to experience the highest rates of population growth and urbanisation in the coastal zone, particularly in Egypt and sub-Saharan countries in Western and Eastern Africa. The results highlight countries and regions with a high degree of exposure to coastal flooding and help identifying regions where policies and adaptive planning for building resilient coastal communities are not only desirable but essential. Furthermore, we identify needs for further research and scope for improvement in this kind of scenario-based exposure analysis.",

        "text": "Population in the LECZ in 2000, 2030 and 2060\n\nThe LECZ comprised only 2.3% (2,599 thousand km2) of the total land area of all coastal countries, but 10.9% (625 million) of their population in the year 2000 (Table 4; S1 Table). The majority (83%) of the global LECZ population lived in less developed countries. The average LECZ population density in the year 2000 was 241 people/km2, which was more than five times higher than the global mean (47 people/km2). The highest average population densities in terms of development status were found in the LECZ of least developed countries (382 people/km2). Our results suggest a growth of the population in the LECZ from 625 million (year 2000; global population of 6.1 billion) to between 879 million (scenario B; global population: 7.8 billion) and 949 million people (scenario C; global population: 8.7 billion) in the year 2030 (Table 4 and Table 5; Fig. 2; S3 Table). By 2060, the LECZ population is likely to approach 1.4 billion people (534 people/km2) under the highest-end growth assumption, which would be 12% of the world’s population of 11.3 billion (scenario C). Even when assuming population growth at the lowest end of the forecasts (scenario B), we estimate there to be more than one billion people in the LECZ globally by 2060 with an average population density of 405 people/km2.\n\nAsia had the largest LECZ population in the year 2000 (461 million or 73% of the total LECZ population; Table 4 and Fig. 2; S2 Table), and this will also be the case in 2030 and 2060, under all scenarios. By 2060, between 729 million (scenario B) and 983 million (scenario C) people will be living in the LECZ in Asia, which amounts to around 70% of the world’s LECZ population. Within Asia, Eastern Asia (China, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Macao Special Administrative Region, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Republic of Korea, Japan) had the largest proportion of population in the LECZ and showed the highest LECZ population density worldwide in the year 2000 (839 people/km2; Fig. 3 and S1 Table). However, the projections suggest that South–Central Asia (Bangladesh, India, Islamic Republic of Iran, Maldives, Pakistan, Sri Lanka) will contribute more to the overall coastal population growth than Eastern Asia in the next decades and is projected to have the highest population totals in the LECZ of all Asian regions by 2060 (Fig. 3; S2 Table). This is mainly due to the large populations of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, in conjunction with significantly higher rates of change as implied in the underlying demographic data sets [48, 50, 51].\n\nThough China represented the largest proportion of people in the LECZ in the year 2000 (144 million people, 11.3% of its total population and 23% of the global LECZ population), its population growth is projected to slow down after 2030 (Table 6). Nevertheless, China could still grow to reach between 200 million (scenario B) and 245 million (scenario C; 16.7% of their total population) people in the LECZ by the year 2060, more than any other nation (Table 7; S2 Table). China is closely followed by India, which could experience a three-fold increase of its LECZ population between the baseline year 2000 (64 million; 6.1% of its total population) and the year 2060 (216 million; 10.3% of its total population) under the high-growth scenario C (Table 6 and Table 7). The LECZ population of Bangladesh (63 million) was similar to India (64 million) in the baseline year 2000 (Table 6). However, the LECZ of Bangladesh comprises over 40% of the country’s total land area (India: 2.6% of the total land area) and had a much larger share of the country’s total population (49%) than India (6.1%) in 2000. Further, the LECZ population was predominantly non-urban (96%) and the population density was considerably higher (1,154 people/km2) than the respective of India (777 people/km2) in the baseline year. Nevertheless, the projections for Bangladesh under scenario C assume a slower growth for its LECZ population, which can be explained by relatively lower non-urban coastal growth (in comparison to other scenarios) in conjunction with the very large share of non-urban population (see Table 1 and Table 7 and Table 1). Pakistan, the third country in South-Central Asia that ranks among the top-25 countries in terms of LECZ population both in the 2000 and in 2060, is projected to encounter the strongest population growth in this region under scenario C (Table 6 and Table 7). In the year 2000, not a very large share of the Pakistani population was located in low-lying coastal areas (3.2% or 4.6 million people). However, the LECZ population could increase six-fold to reach 30 million people by 2060.\n\nChina, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Viet Nam represent the five countries with the largest share of population in the LECZ worldwide (Table 6). All these countries are located in Eastern, South-Central and South-Eastern Asia and belong to the less and least developed nations of the world. Together they accounted for 56% of the global LECZ population in the year 2000 (353 million people; 5.8% of the world population). From these countries, Bangladesh had the highest proportion of people living in low-lying coastal areas (49% of their total population respectively). All countries were characterised by very large extends of non-urban settlements in the LECZ, between 70% (Indonesia) and 96% (Bangladesh). According to our population projections, these countries will maintain the top five positions in the future and count up to 745 million people in the LECZ by 2060, 6.6% of the world population (scenario C; Table 7).\n\nIn contrast to Asia, Africa’s LECZ population (54 million in 2000, 8.7% of the African coastal countries’ population) and coastal land area in the LECZ (194 thousand km2; 0.9% of the African coastal countries land area) are considerably smaller (Table 4, Fig. 2 and Fig. 3; S2 Table). However, Africa will be the continent to experience the highest rates of growth and urbanisation in the LECZ across all scenarios. In particular, the LECZ population of Sub-Saharan Africa (all of Africa except Northern Africa; includes the Sudan), which represented 45% of the African nations’ LECZ population in 2000, could grow from 24 million (2000) to 66 million by 2030 and to 174 million by 2060 (both scenario C) due to an average coastal growth rate of up to 3.3% (2000–2030) and 3.2% (2030–2060). These rates are considerably higher than in Asia, where annual rates of growth are expected to reach 1.4% in the first three decades (2000–2030) and afterwards drop to 1.2% (scenario C).\n\nAmong the African regions, coastal population growth is projected to be highest in Eastern and Western Africa, especially in the urban centres of Western Africa where between 72 million (scenario B) and 94 million (scenario C) people will reside by 2060 (Fig. 4; S2 Table). Northern Africa (Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, Western Sahara) had the largest LECZ population in the year 2000 (30 million), but will not keep pace with the coastal growth in Western Africa where nations like Nigeria, Benin, Côte d'Ivoire and Senegal are growing considerably faster. According to our projections, all four countries will be among the top-25 countries in terms of LECZ population totals by 2060 (Table 7), while in the baseline year 2000 only Nigeria was present in this top-25 ranking with 58 million people (11% of its population). All of them will experience a considerable population increase. A characteristic example is Senegal, which had a small LECZ population in the year 2000 (2.9 million) and where 50% of the country’s total population could live on low-lying coastal land by 2060 (19 million people; Table 7). In Eastern Africa, the countries of Tanzania, Somalia and Mozambique boost the regional development through strong coastal growth. These three countries are expected to feature among the top-25 countries with the highest population in the LECZ by the year 2060 (scenario C; Table 7), in stark contrast with their comparatively low LECZ population in 2000 (Table 6 and Table 7). The United Republic of Tanzania is projected to undergo a 22-fold rise in LECZ population numbers and Somalia a 16-fold increase, while Mozambique is expected to triple its LECZ population (all scenario C). Southern Africa, which comprises the coastal countries Namibia and South Africa, exhibited the smallest LECZ population with 0.5 million people in the year 2000, increasing to 1.7 million by 2060 (Scenarios C; Fig. 3).\n\nEgypt (26 million; 38% of its total population) and Nigeria (7.4 million; 5.9% of its total population) were the countries with the highest population in the LECZ in the African continent in 2000, ranking at places 6 and 7 globally (Table 6). The Egyptian LECZ along the Mediterranean coast and the Nile delta (1,075 people/km2) was almost as densely populated as the LECZ of Japan (1,250 people/km2) or Bangladesh (1,154 people/km2) in 2000. However, only 15% of the LECZ population actually lived in dense urban areas in the year 2000. By 2030, population density along the Egyptian coast is expected to increase to 1,902 people/km2 and to 2,681 people/km2 by 2060.\n\nIn Europe, the total population in the LECZ (50 million) was similar to that in Africa (54 million) in the year 2000, while the LECZ area was more than double in size (Europe: 471 thousand km2; Africa: 194 thousand km2; S1 Table). This resulted in an average population density of only 106 people/km2 in the in European LECZ, as opposed to the 280 people/km2 in the LECZ of Africa or to the global average of 241 people/km2. Also, the proportion of urban population in the LECZ in Europe (40%) was significantly higher than in Asia (20%) or Africa (16.5%) in the year 2000 (Table 4). Among the European regions, Western Europe stands out with about 21 million people living in a LECZ that is quite densely populated (328 people/km2 respectively), half of which is located in the Netherlands (12 million; 73% of its total population). However, the LECZ of Europe, as a region that is characterised by richer economies, is projected to experience only low to moderate population growth towards 56 million people by the year 2060, at most (scenario D). In contrast to Europe, Africa could more than quadruple its LECZ population in the same period. From the six European countries with the highest population in the LECZ in the year 2000 (Netherlands, United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Spain and the Russian Federation), only the Netherlands and the United Kingdom will, according to our projections, rank among the top-25 countries in 2060, though dropping in rank compared to the year 2000 (Table 6 and Table 7). The Russian Federation has the largest LECZ (272 thousand km2) of all countries worldwide. In 2000, 3.51 million people (2.4% of the national total; Table 6) were living in the Russian LECZ, but little change is expected here with LECZ population reaching at maximum 3.55 million by 2060 (scenario C). In accordance with the UN’s classification, the Russian Federation is assigned to Eastern Europe [46].\n\nNorthern America (Bermuda, Canada, Greenland, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, United States of America) has the second largest extent of LECZ after Asia with over 507 thousand km2 (see S2 Table). However, the overall number of people in the LECZ was significantly lower than in most other continents in the year 2000 (24 million or 3.7% of the global LECZ population). Compared to Europe, coastal growth is expected to be higher in Northern America with rates of up to 1.2% (2000–2030), dropping to 0.8% in the decades thereafter (2030–2060), while Europe shows growth rates of 0.3% to 0.1%, respectively (scenario C). The Northern American LECZ population is growing faster than the Latin American one and by 2060 up to 46 million people could be living in the LECZ of Northern America (S2 Table). The U.S. had the largest share of coastal population with 23 million in 2000, rising to 44 million in 2060 (scenario C), ranking eighth among LECZ countries in both years (Table 6 and Table 7). Canada, despite having a much larger LECZ, is sparsely populated along its long northern coastline. Here, a maximum of 1.6 million people could be living below 10 m of elevation by 2060. An interesting feature of the Northern American LECZ is the high number of people in dense urban areas, which reached already almost 60% in 2000 (Table 4).\n\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean, the LECZ area is about half the size of the Asian LECZ with 424 thousand km2 in total, whereas the LECZ population was only about 7% (32 million) of that in Asia in the year 2000. South America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Falkland Islands/Malvinas, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, Uruguay, Venezuela) contributed the largest share of coastal population in the year 2000 and is also expected to do so in future: Starting from 22 million in the year 2000, the population in the LECZ could reach between 28 million (scenario B) and 38 million (scenario C) by 2060. In this region, Brazil and Argentina are the two nations with the highest number of people in the LECZ, both in the year 2000 and in future projections (Table 6 and Table 7). In Brazil, 12 million people were living in the LECZ (1.4% of the land area) in the year 2000, corresponding to 6.6% of its total population (Table 6). At the same time Argentina had about 3.6 million people living the LECZ (about 1.9% of the land area). By 2060, the LECZ population of the two nations could grow to 19 million (Brazil) and 7.6 million (Argentina) (Table 7).\n\nThe smallest portion of the global LECZ population is found in Oceania. In the year 2000, the LECZ population amounted to 0.5% of the global LECZ population (Table 4; S1 Table). However, this represents at least 11% of the total population of the region, making the proportion higher compared to other regions. Most of these people were living in the LECZ of Australia and New Zealand (2.7 million or 80% of Oceania’s LECZ population in 2000). Growth is projected to be comparatively low in Oceania and could lead to LECZ population totals between 5.0 million and 6.1 million people by 2060 (Scenarios B and C respectively; Table 4). We must note that the results for Oceania do not include data for Tokelau (total population in 2000 [48]: 1,552), Pitcairn (included in Polynesia in the UN data [48], but no separate population records) and for the Federated State of Micronesia (total population in 2000 [48]: 107,103), both for the LECZ and the flood plain analysis. This is due to missing information in the employed data sets, as explained in the section Uncertainties, limitations and evaluation of results. Nevertheless, although highly significant for the respective nations, these numbers would have no major impact on our results at continental or global scale.\n\nCoastal population development and aspects of coastal migration\n\nOur projections show that, even under the lowest growth assumptions, the global LECZ population could rise by more than 50% between the baseline year 2000 and 2030 (scenario B), from 625 million to 880 million; by 2060, more than a billion people worldwide could be living in the LECZ. Under scenario C the world would face an overall high population growth due to stagnant economic development and exclusive social, political and economic governance (see Fig. 1 and Table 1). In this scenario, the global LECZ would bear 763 million additional people by 2060, compared to the situation in the year 2000, which would be an increase of 122%. For the same scenario between 315 million and 411 million people would be living in the 100-year flood plain by 2060, compared to 189 million in the year 2000. It must be noted that considering for subsidence in deltaic areas and in cities prone to subsidence due to drainage and groundwater pumping would further enhance these numbers [59, 60]. However, this factor was not considered in the present study.\n\nThe results also demonstrate that the less developed countries outnumber the more developed regions in terms of population in the LECZ and in the flood plain, with Asia having had the highest land area, total number of people and urban population in the LECZ in the year 2000 and prevailing in the future (Fig. 5). In Africa, we see a rapid coastal development in terms of overall population growth and urbanisation, which will exacerbate the already high vulnerability of many African coastal countries [33]. By 2060, Egypt and Nigeria are expected to rank in the top ten countries globally, following directly the five Asian countries with the highest exposure: China, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Viet Nam. Hanson et al. [18] identified twelve port cities located in these Asian coastal countries to be among the top 20 of the world’s large port cities exposed to 100-year flood levels by 2070 in terms of population. In an assessment of 136 coastal cities by Hallegatte et al. [25], several of these cities were also rated as being highly vulnerable in terms of expected annual damages (flood risk) in 2005 as well as under future scenarios (2050). However, Hanson et al. [18] found 40 million people in urban locations in the 100-year flood plain, considering all coastal cities with more than one million people in 2005. Comparing these figures to our total flood plain population estimates of 189 million (in the year 2000) suggests that most of the flood plain population is actually located in smaller coastal cities, less densely populated urban areas and rural settings.\n\nPopulation estimates (year 2010) and projections (year 2025) for selected megacities (> 8 million people) located in the LECZ were derived from the UN’s World Urbanization Prospects [79].\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0118571.g005\n\nNevertheless, among the 25 countries we project to have the largest portion of people in the LECZ in 2060, there are also several developed countries, including the United States of America. The U.S. was already among the 25 countries with the highest LECZ population in the year 2000. Due to the large number of people living in the LECZ (23 million in 2000) and the fact that 61% of these were located in dense urban areas, the U.S. exhibit a relatively strong growth of the total LECZ population in comparison to other developed countries. The U.S. recently encountered major coastal disasters with the Hurricanes Katrina in 2005 and Sandy in 2012, indicating the—possibly increasing—vulnerability and risks associated with settling in low-lying coastal areas of the U.S. [20, 25, 61].\n\nOur projections reflect the scenario assumptions made concerning the socio-economic development pathways of the coastal regions and coastal migration, as well as the underlying low, medium and high growth variants of the UN’s population prospects (see Fig. 1 and Table 1). Scenario B with its lowest-end-of-growth assumptions (10th percentile or low growth variant) produces the lowest projections of coastal growth, despite a coastal correction factor of 2.0 assigned to coastal urban areas in the developing world to account for massive migration to regional growth poles. The scenarios A and C project the highest population growth in the LECZ for the “less developed regions”. Nevertheless, assumptions of increased migration from poorer countries to richer countries in combination with a high population growth variant for the developing world (90th percentile or high growth variant) in scenario C result in overall higher coastal growth compared to scenario A. In this scenario, we translated the assumed patterns of more rapid internal migration in faster growing developing countries into slightly higher coastal urban growth, while coastal non-urban growth is reduced due to stagnant economy and migration to regional growth poles in comparison to scenario A. Only Africa exhibits a different behaviour in the period between 2000 and 2030 with strongest growth under scenario A. This is explained by a high percentage of non-urban coastal population in the African countries and the assumption that developing countries partially experience rapid coastal migration with expansive urban growth. In contrast to this, the “richer economies” in Europe, Northern America, Japan and Australia/New Zealand would face the highest coastal growth under scenario D. Although in this scenario inclusive governance is assumed to keep the global population growth at the low end of forecasts (50th percentile or medium growth variant), richer economies exhibit relatively strong coastal growth due to an increased demand for migrants to fill in the labour market for the aging population [39]. It has to be noted, though, that due to the methodology employed, we cannot explicitly differentiate between urban and non-urban population numbers in our projections, as the latter also include a certain proportion of urban population. This is due to the fact that we did not account spatially for transitions between dense urban, suburban and rural areas. However, these transitions are considered implicitly through our assumptions of coastal urban growth. We are therefore confident that the total numbers produced in this study constitute reliable projections of people in the LECZ and in the 100-year flood plain.\n\nNet migration from developing to developed countries, as well as assumptions on fertility, are inherently included in the employed UN’s population prospect variants [46]. General effects of environmental pressures and disasters on migration are considered in the Foresight Project’s socio-economic scenarios [39]. However, possible out-migration and displacement as a response to increased flood risks or inundation was not considered spatially in our assessment. More explicit consideration of these factors in future work is important, especially when considering that the areas at risk, i.e. coastal flood plains and deltaic areas, are at the same time a “major migrant destinations since they offer better economic opportunities through their concentration of industry and services” [62]. The UK’s Government Office for Science [38] concludes that environmental change in the LECZ, such as sea-level rise and increasing occurrence extreme events, will affect the existing structural drivers of migration through the induced socio-economic impacts. However, as Black et al. [63] and Warner [64] point out, the factors that drive environmental migration are complex and multi-layered, and migration as well as displacement are some of the possible responses. The role of adaptation to coastal flooding and sea-level rise will also need to be considered [16, 21, 25, 65]. Curtis and Schneider [66] stress that migration networks between coastal and inland areas or between inundated and not-inundated coastal counties may be another essential factor to account for when assessing future coastal population. Socio-demographic, economic and environmental characteristics as well as the political setting of a coastal area or region determine the response to coastal hazards. Yet, such a level of detail is hard to achieve in global to regional scale studies.\n\nUncertainties, limitations and evaluation of results\n\nOur estimates of total land area and population in the LECZ for the year 2000 are in agreement with the findings of previous studies [1, 5], with deviations being in the order of 4% for the global total and between 1% and 10% when comparing continental totals (see Table 9). However, our assessments suggest a significantly smaller proportion of urban population within the LECZ. This deviation can be explained by the different data used for the identification of urban areas and the resulting differences in the definitions of “urban”. While McGranahan et al. [5] and Balk et al. [1] used the urban extent grids of the Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project GRUMP (GRUMP alpha), we employed the higher resolution MODIS 500-m Map of Global Urban Extent (see Material and Methods; Table 2). This decision was based on the work of Potere and Schneider [67], Schneider et al. [42] and Seto et al. [7] who found GRUMP to overestimate urban land in comparison to other global urban maps and the MODIS 500-m map to have the highest overall accuracy [42, 67]. In addition, we conducted extensive visual checks of urban areas to compare their representation in both data sets, also using satellite imagery for validation (Google Earth; ArcGIS World Imagery). For most regions, the urban extent of the MODIS data set appeared to be considerably more representative of built-up urban areas than GRUMP. The latter seems to overestimate urban extent and city size but captures other types of settlements such as urban slums, which the MODIS grid excludes. We also observed that both MODIS and GRUMP urban extent grids are likely to include non-residential built-up areas such as industrial districts or commercial centres. At the same time, by using the MODIS urban extent grid in combination with the GRUMP population count grid to approximate urban population, specific types of possibly densely populated residential areas within urban administrative units, such as informal settlements and urban slums, might have been classified as non-urban population in our assessment.\n\nFurther uncertainties may have been introduced when combining the MODIS urban extent data [42, 43] with the GRUMP population data [44], where resampling may have led to incorrect allocation of population into urban and non-urban classes. These uncertainties could not be quantified in the context of this work, but we expect them to have only minor influence on the population figures. Overall we are confident to have produced representative global estimates of LECZ population, though we have to stress that our urban population refers to people living in dense urban areas (see Material and Methods). We may underestimate urban population for less densely built-up urban areas, for cities with large vegetated areas or for urban settlements in less developed countries with structures that resemble rural areas, such as dirt roads. For this reason our baseline estimates of urban population are likely to be at the lower bound for the year 2000, compared to e.g. the results of McGranahan et al. [5] and Balk et al. [1].\n\nAs discussed by Balk et al. [68], amongst others, there are further issues related to the criteria and methods whereby populations and the respective areas are identified as urban or non-urban in spatial data and census data. For census data, there is no common set of criteria and definitions for classifying urban and non-urban (or rural) population between countries [69, 70]. In a similar way, spatial population and urban extent data are also based on specific (but possibly different) criteria and methods for differentiating between urban and non-urban areas and for spatially allocating people [42, 43, 67, 70]. These issues need to be considered when combining spatial population and urban extent data with census-based data. Nevertheless, we are confident that by combining spatial and non-spatial population data we did not introduce additional uncertainty. The UN’s population and urbanisation data were used to derive annual rates of coastal urban and non-urban growth, as explained in Material and Methods. These rates were then applied to the mapped urban and non-urban baseline population shares.\n\nAs a result of the resolution and scale of this analysis, some issues with small coastal countries occurred, such as missing information and mis-registration issues between spatial data layers. This became particularly evident when analysing data of small islands and island states in this global approach. Several of these could not be considered in this study because of missing information in the GRUMP population count grid [44] (St. Helena, French Southern Territories, Tokelau and Pitcairn Islands) and in the land area data set [71] (Norfolk Island and the Federated State of Micronesia). In the flood plain analysis we identified spatial mis-matches between the GRUMP data sets [44, 71] and the more detailed GADM boundaries [72]. Similar issues due to mismatches between elevation and population data sets had been reported by McGranahan et al. [5] and Lichter et al [6].\n\nNevertheless, despite addressing those mis-matches (see Material and Methods), we may still underestimate the number of people in the flood plain. For instance, we estimated 189 million people to have been living in the 100-year flood plain in the year 2000, globally, while Jongman et al. [73] estimated 271 million people exposed to 1-in-100-year coastal flood events in 2010. They projected 345 million people to be living in the 100-year flood plain in 2050, based on the Medium Fertility projections of the United Nations’ 2006 Revision of the World Population Prospects, while our results suggest a coastal growth to 340 million people by 2060 under a medium growth variant (scenario D). Although these numbers do compare well, we must note that there is a difference of ten years between the baseline years and the projections and that Jongman et al. [73] did not account for upward displacement of the flood plain from sea-level rise. The observed differences between their study and our assessment can further result from variations in the base data employed: Jongman et al. [73] used a finer resolution SRTM grid at 3 arc sec resolution but coarser resolution population density data at 5 arc min resolution and, as mentioned earlier, an older version of the UN’s demographic data.\n\nThe issues discussed above constitute inherent characteristics of analysis that integrate global data sets from different sources, as discussed by several authors [6, 27, 56, 68, 74]. Despite these common uncertainties and limitations, we are confident that our results present improved first order estimates of the population development and exposure of land and people in coastal regions. These estimates can provide a reliable basis for exploring and comparing future development trends and pathways at regional, continental and global levels. However, we also see scope for improvement regarding the differential projection of urban and non-urban population in the coastal zone. The use of dynamic spatial models of land-use change in the analysis would allow for explicit consideration of the expansive dimension of urban growth and the spatial transitions between different land use categories. Such a model could then be combined with more detailed scenarios and country-specific coastal correction factors to spatially differentiate between urban growth in density, urban expansion including peri-urbanisation and rural population change.\n\nHowever, as outlined above, the categorisation of urban and non-urban (or rural) areas and populations currently suffers from a lack of unambiguous and consistent definitions of the respective classes, or other forms of land use and settlement structures, and their representation in global land use/land cover maps, population maps and census data. Thus, looking at the importance of global data sets for assessing global- and climate-change related impacts and with the encountered limitations and uncertainties in mind, we strongly support Mondal and Tatem [35] in their pleading for “spatial population datasets built on accurate, contemporary and detailed census data”. In fact, there is an urgent need for a more detailed approximation of population and settlement structures. These could possibly be based upon existing data models such as GRUMP and MODIS for improved and consistent global population and land use data. Further, we recommend detailed explorations of both data sets with respect to capturing settlements of different types and the respective population shares, for example introducing a third class of peri-urban and comparing different combinations of global urban extent data and population data. Also, when analysing the future flood plain population, the role of subsidence should be considered in addition to sea-level rise. Finally, this first-order assessment could also be improved in future studies by accounting for migration and displacement due to environmental changes and climate change-related effects such as sea-level rise. Yet, this would require employing other spatial assessment methods in order to relocate people from the flood plain and consider migration networks, as discussed by Curtis and Schneider [66].\n\nAs outlined above, our results are based on a series of assumptions (e.g. with regard to coastal growth) and data sets (e.g. MODIS urban extent data, GRUMP population count data and the UN’s 2009 and 2010 urbanisation and population data), and the overall assessment is confined by certain limitations and uncertainties. We recommend that continued studies on this topic are needed. By employing more recent or improved data and refining methods and scenarios or accounting for the discussed uncertainties and limitations, the results will inevitably evolve. For example, new population projections and scenarios come to different conclusions whether population growth will level off before 2100 [75, 76] or continue to grow [77] and how population will change in China or in fast-growing countries of Africa. But for the time being, our assessment represents plausible scenarios of future population exposure in coastal zones."
