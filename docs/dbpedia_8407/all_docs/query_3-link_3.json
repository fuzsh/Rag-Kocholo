The difference for this age group is 28.1 percentage points between the lowest educational level ( less than first stage of secondary education) and the highest (higher education) in 2010 and 10.02 points in 2022.\n\nAs age increases, the difference in unemployment rates by educational level becomes smaller.\n\nThe greatest improvement in the unemployment rate between 2010 and 2022 is found in the 35-44 age bracket and educational level below the first stage of secondary education (from 32.9% to 24.5%), while the greatest increase in unemployment is found in the 55-64 age group with the same educational level (from 20.4% to 23.8%).\n\nThe 55-64 age group is the only one to experience a deterioration in the unemployment rate for all educational levels separately, although the total rate for this age group decreases.\n\nYoung population not in education, employment or training\n\nYoungsters (15-29 years) not in education, employment or training by educational attainment level and time span\n\nLess than 2nd stage of secondary education 2nd stage of secondary education Total 2005 2010 2022 2005 2010 2022 2005 2010 2022 TOTAL 18.1 26.2 17.0 10.3 13.9 9.9 14.0 20.0 12.7\n\nSource: MEFD Subdirectorate General for Statistics and Studies.

Organic Law 2/2006 (LOE), as amended by Organic Law 3/2020 (LOMLOE), states that:\n\nthe educational administrations shall guarantee the right of students to be taught in Spanish and in the other co-official languages in their respective territories, in accordance with the Spanish Constitution, the Statutes of Autonomy and all applicable regulations.\n\nat the end of their basic education, all students shall achieve full and equivalent proficiency in Spanish and, where appropriate, in the corresponding co-official language.\n\nReligions\n\nAccording to data from the Centre for Sociological Research (CIS), in November 2022 55.4 % of citizens declared to be Catholic, 2.6 % believers of other religion, 12.3 % agnostic, and 28.0 % non-believers, atheists or indifferent. 1.8 % of respondents did not answer.\n\nIn Spain, no denomination has an official status.
