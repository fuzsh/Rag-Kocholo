        "text": "Health Systems in Transition, Vol. 20 No. 2\n\n| Country report\n\nOverview\n\nThe underlying principles and goals of the Spanish national health system continue to focus on universality, free access, equity and fairness of financing. The evolution of performance measures over the last decade shows the resilience of the health system to macroeconomic conditions, although some structural reforms may be required to improve chronic-care management and the reallocation of resources to high-value interventions.\n\nOverall health status continues to improve\n\nLife expectancy in Spain is the highest in the European Union (EU). Inequalities in self-reported health have also declined in the last decade, although long-standing disability and chronic conditions are increasing due to an ageing population.\n\nAfter decreasing in 2009–2015, public health-care spending is on the rise\n\nPublic expenditure in health prevails, with public sources accounting for over 71.1% of total health financing. Yet private spending, mainly related to out-of-pocket payments, has increased over time, and it is now above the EU average.\n\nService provision characterized by the strength of primary care\n\nPrimary care remains the core element of the health system. Public health efforts over the last decade have focused on increasing health system coordination and providing guidance on addressing chronic conditions and lifestyle factors such as obesity.\n\nResilient health system despite economic crisis\n\nHealth system-specific measures to maintain the sustainability of the Spanish health system were implemented in the last decade, with no short-term impact on health outcomes. Structural measures, however, are needed to improve resource allocation and technical efficiency, as well as patients’ participation in decisions on their care.\n\nWHO Team\n\nEuropean Observatory on Health Systems and Policies\n\nEditors\n\nEnrique Bernal-Delgado, Sandra García-Armesto, Juan Oliva, Fernando Ignacio Sánchez Martínez, José Ramón Repullo, Luz María Peña-Longobardo, Manuel Ridao-López, Cristina Hernández-Quevedo\n\nReference numbers\n\nISBN: 1817-6119"
