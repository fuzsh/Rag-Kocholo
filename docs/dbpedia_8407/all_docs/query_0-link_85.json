The methods used to estimate the abundance of this group of dogs are more complex than the ones used with domiciled owned dogs. In this systematic review, we analyze the techniques and the results obtained in studies that seek to estimate the size of free-ranging dog populations. Twenty-six studies were reviewed regarding the quality of execution and their capacity to generate valid estimates. Seven of the eight publications that take a simple count of the animal population did not consider the different probabilities of animal detection; only one study used methods based on distances; twelve relied on capture-recapture models for closed populations without considering heterogeneities in capture probabilities; six studies applied their own methods with different potential and limitations. Potential sources of bias in the studies were related to the inadequate description or implementation of animal capturing or viewing procedures and to inadequacies in the identification and registration of dogs. Thus, there was a predominance of estimates with low validity. Abundance and density estimates carried high variability, and all studies identified a greater number of male dogs. We point to enhancements necessary for the implementation of future studies and to potential updates and revisions to the recommendations of the World Health Organization with respect to the estimation of free-ranging dog populations.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn Ecology, the term “population” defines a group of organisms of one species that interbreed and live in the same place at the same time [1]. Plenty of estimates of abundance have been obtained, especially for populations of wild animals, for example, elephants [2], frogs [3], birds [4], wales [5], insects [6] and foxes [7]. In relation to dogs, although a great percentage of them are domiciliary and restricted animals, there is still a great percentage of animals continuously circulating on the street [8] forming specific population groups which are named free-roaming, stray, wandering, not domiciled or unrestricted. Even though publications with free roaming dogs were less frequent than with domiciliary dogs [9], non-restricted dogs also had their population size estimated in different studies [10].\n\nStray dogs can be considered the primary victims of irresponsible owners who reject their pets into the streets [10, 11]. The abandonment of dogs might be related to irresponsible breeding and religious, cultural and socioeconomic factors. The existence of free-roaming dogs is considered an important problem, not only for the animal welfare but also for Public Health [12, 13].\n\nIssues related to non-domiciliary dogs refer to incidents such as bites, transmission of diseases to humans, damage to wildlife populations, accidents and pollution [14–17].\n\nAdequate estimates of the size and of the characteristics of the population of free-roaming dogs are essential in planning and monitoring the effectiveness of strategies adopted for the control and for the welfare of the population [18, 19], for the management of risks associated with their presence [20] and to quantify the prevalence of zoonosis and other diseases present in these animals.\n\nThe methods used to estimate the abundance of domiciliary dogs, such as the assessment of veterinary records or sampling based on questionnaires applied to owners, are not useful to estimate the abundance of free-ranging dogs [21]. On the contrary, it is more appropriate to rely on the same methods developed for the estimation of abundance of the population of wild animals [9]. Nowadays, a wide variety of techniques can be applied, including indirect methods, sample surveys based on counts, lines, transects or points; radio telemetry and plenty of other different forms of capture and recapture [22, 23]. The development of such techniques continues to grow [24],but despite all the recent methodological advances, the WHO [25] and the World Animal Protection [26] recommend only four techniques to be used in the estimation of the abundance of unrestricted dogs: total or indirect counts, regression method, estimates of recaptures and the Beck method. Even though such methods have the advantage of being easier to understand and apply [19], in many cases, their premises [27] cannot be met in the studies of the dynamics of the population of free-roaming dogs, when the application of more appropriate techniques is required. Besides, it is necessary that the methods used be up to date with the advances made in this field of study [23, 28, 29].\n\nA recent systematic review of methods used to estimate the size of restricted domiciliary dogs showed that these were, in general, considered questionable [30]. This limitation was due to a large number of biases and constraints found in most publications and highlighted the importance of a critical evaluation of the knowledge produced and used in the field of veterinary medicine [30]. Given the additional complexities involved in the estimation of the abundance of free-roaming dogs, and the need to choose the appropriate procedures, with known statistical properties and assumptions [22], we systematically review the literature on the estimation of the size of this population. In particular, we assess the methodological framework under which these estimates were carried out as well as the patterns obtained in the estimates in terms of gender, age, breed and socioeconomic factors.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis review analyzed the methods and results of twenty-six studies that estimated the abundance, density or the ratio of human to dogs of the free-ranging dog populations. It is difficult to indicate ideal methods to estimate the size of animal populations. The choice of an optimum strategy depends on the circumstances and the resources available in each area as well as the susceptibility to bias of each technique. The papers reviewed in this work used methods that have well-known limitations and did not incorporate alternative strategies that could lead to improved estimates of animal abundance.\n\nDogs are territorial animals, tend to concentrate in areas with increased availability of food and have varying patterns of behavior towards people, so their individual probabilities of being captured differ. Thus, the use of counts by mean of census would only apply if one could look at the same moment the dogs in all areas of the territory [19]. In opposition to this latter recommendation, eight studies used census to estimate abundance. On the other hand, methods based on counting individuals belonging to sampling units representing the study area, and where all dogs can be counted or the sampling fraction can be estimated, are widely described in the literature [10, 57, 65, 66] but have been used only in one study reviewed [37]. Assuming that censuses were used more often because they are faster and less costly, they do not outperform sampling methods. The latter approach is capable of generating better information, and its implementation is as complex as the census, just requiring prior planning to choose the most appropriate model [65]. Also, sampling methods are cheaper when large areas need to be covered. Therefore, such methods ought to be considered in future research and, even, in regular surveillance activities requiring estimates of the abundance and density of dogs. On the other hand, counts by mean of censuses should be carried out only in rare instances when no other alternative becomes available, for a short period and, preferably, implemented along with calibration procedures and statistical tests for the presence of heterogeneities of detection probabilities [22, 66].\n\nRegarding the twelve studies using capture-recapture techniques, only one [35] addressed the presence of heterogeneities in the analysis. None of the studies reviewed considered the populations sampled as open, although this approach were feasible and could have provided relevant information regarding the estimates of parameters such as survival and recruitment in populations of free-roaming dogs [57, 67]. It is advisable that future capture-recapture studies take advantage of the various methods available for the analysis of open populations [22, 68]. The same advice applies to the methods of analyses of closed populations that take into account heterogeneous probabilities of animal capture [60]. In this context, we call the readers´ attention to Pollock´s Robust Design, whose methodology is described in different publications [22, 69, 70], and which incorporates the advantages of both approaches developed for open and closed populations. Although being more difficult to implement due to its complexity, this technique deserves the attention of future academic research in this field.\n\nThe vast majority of the studies followed WHO recommendations, first published in 1990 [25] and the most recent document by the World Animal Protection [26]. These publications suggested the use of census, of Lincoln Petersen estimator and of Beck´s method. Both documents highlight the assumptions and limitations of these techniques but do not refer to the alternative approaches recommended otherwise. These approaches would be useful, when the assumptions are not tenable, and when the limitations are present, and could lead to adequate estimates of the size of populations of free-roaming dogs. Parameters related to the canine population dynamics, such as abundance, can have a major impact on animal welfare, animal disease control and the monitoring of the effectiveness of population control measures [18, 19]. The importance of having access to proper estimates of these parameters should be overlooked. It is, therefore, essential that WHO updates its recommendations by describing sampling techniques based on distances or count, and methods that allow for the analysis of capture probabilities of dogs in models applicable to closed populations. Such methods do not add complexity to the fieldwork data collection process and generate more valid and reliable information. Previous training on the development of the study protocol and analysis is all that is required for their implementation. Equally important is the need to raise the awareness about methods based on open populations and their role in the estimation of survival and abundance.\n\nMore expensive or complex methods, in turn, might be difficult to implement in a more general context but are certainly useful in a research context. A short list of such methods include: spatially explicit capture-recapture [32], known-fate models with individuals carrying radio markers [71, 72], Pollock´s Robust Design and Mark-resight that make use of tools to know exactly the number of marked dogs, as well as methods developed and/or used more recently to sample animal populations other than dogs [73–76]. Methods introduced in the studies by Matter et al. [50] and Hiby et al. [43] deserve further evaluation since they can prove to be useful tools for estimating the canine abundance.\n\nIn addition to the limitations introduced by the choice of the analytical methods, a second source of concerns that might affect the studies reviewed in this work is their susceptibility to biases due to the study implementation. The approaches used may experience failure to identify the dogs due to the use of inappropriate markers or lack of photographs [77]. Different markers and the photographic method can be used with canine populations [25]. Photos in adequate numbers and in different positions for the same dog may have high sensitivity and specificity [10; 78] without the need for physical contact between the researcher and the animal. Future studies should expand the description of the photographic method to better assess their suitability and reproducibility. On the other hand, biases and limitations arising from the study implementation or the description of the capturing procedures or animal visualization can benefit from tools analogous to those developed to improve the description of the results of epidemiological studies [79]. These latter guidelines have yet to be adapted to the context of studies aimed at estimating animal populations. Once available they might help in conceiving proper studies with a transparent and standardized description of the results.\n\nDensity estimates reported in the studies reviewed in this work displayed a large variation. This statement is true even in studies performed in the same country, as it is the case of India [35, 51]. As discussed by Shimozako and Junio [10], this variability prevents that a single value of the ratio of human to dogs be extrapolated to estimate the populations of different areas. Observed differences in population abundance can be considered normal, and even expected, given that the density of dogs is strongly influenced by social, economic, demographic, environmental and cultural factors [9]. We noted, however, that the modeling procedures in all the studies reviewed did not account for additional factors possibly related to the parameters describing the dynamics of the canine population [80]. Only a few of those studies provided additional descriptive information. Such analyzes should also be implemented in future research since these factors might play a key role in understanding the canine population dynamics [22].\n\nMale animals outnumber female animals in the population of free-roaming dogs. This statement derives from the descriptive data presented in the studies. This pattern is also observed among restricted dogs [81], and may be explained by the use of male animals as guard dogs [44] and by a higher mortality among female animals due to pregnancy and childbirth [82].\n\nThe present review is also limited in various aspects. Given the geographic diversity of the studies analyzed, our search strategy did not cover all sources of information, and differential selection of studies should be reminded. We searched different bases as well as Google Scholar to minimize this source of bias. However, studies that took place in non-academic environments may have been lost. The diagnosis of susceptibility to biases in reviews requires specific tools that are not available yet in the field of animal population dynamics. Therefore, our review should be seen as a “quality review” of a theoretical nature instead of a quantitative review aiming at more precise parameter estimates by pooling together the data published by the various studies. The successful experience in using the various tools of this type in the medical field [31] should serve as an example and guidance leading to similar initiatives in the field of Ecology.\n\nOur review examined different studies that report estimates on the abundance or density of the population of free-ranging dogs. The validity of the estimates reported is the subject of concerns due to the limitations identified in our work. Valid estimates of abundance and density are the only way to achieve a proper understanding of the canine population dynamics, a prerequisite for the planning, execution and evaluation of control actions preserving animal welfare."
