        "text": "Not to be confused with Historical projections of population growth.\n\nThis article lists current estimates of the world population in history. In summary, estimates for the progression of world population since the Late Middle Ages are in the following ranges:\n\nYear 1400 1500 1600 1700 1800 1900 2000 2100 population\n\n(in billions) 0.35–0.40 0.43–0.50 0.50–0.58 0.60–0.68 0.89–0.98 1.56–1.71 6.06–6.15 c. 10–13 growth p.a.[1] >0% <0.12% 0.15–0.3% 0.1–0.15% 0.3–0.5% 0.5–0.6% 1.3–1.4% 0.7–0.8%\n\nEstimates for pre-modern times are necessarily fraught with great uncertainties, and few of the published estimates have confidence intervals; in the absence of a straightforward means to assess the error of such estimates, a rough idea of expert consensus can be gained by comparing the values given in independent publications. Population estimates cannot be considered accurate to more than two decimal digits; for example, the world population for the year 2012 was estimated at 7.02, 7.06, and 7.08 billion by the United States Census Bureau, the Population Reference Bureau, and the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, respectively, corresponding to a spread of estimates of the order of 0.8%.\n\nDeep prehistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Prehistoric demography\n\nAs a general rule, the confidence of estimates on historical world population decreases for the more distant past. Robust population data exist only for the last two or three centuries. Until the late 18th century, few governments had ever performed an accurate census. In many early attempts, such as in Ancient Egypt and the Persian Empire, the focus was on counting merely a subset of the population for purposes of taxation or military service.[2] Published estimates for the 1st century (\"AD 1\") suggest uncertainty of the order of 50% (estimates range between 150 and 330 million). Some estimates extend their timeline into deep prehistory, to \"10,000 BC\", i.e., the early Holocene, when world population estimates range roughly between 1 and 10 million (with an uncertainty of up to an order of magnitude).[3][4]\n\nEstimates for yet deeper prehistory, into the Paleolithic, are of a different nature. At this time, human populations consisted entirely of non-sedentary hunter-gatherer populations, with anatomically modern humans existing alongside archaic human varieties, some of which are still ancestral to the modern human population due to interbreeding with modern humans during the Upper Paleolithic. Estimates of the size of these populations are a topic of paleoanthropology. A late human population bottleneck is postulated by some scholars at approximately 70,000 years ago, during the Toba catastrophe, when Homo sapiens population may have dropped to as low as between 1,000 and 10,000 individuals.[5][6] For the time of speciation of Homo sapiens, some 200,000 years ago, an effective population size of the order of 10,000 to 30,000 individuals has been estimated, with an actual \"census population\" of early Homo sapiens of roughly 100,000 to 300,000 individuals.[7]\n\nEstimates regarding the questions of \"how many people have ever lived?\" or \"what percentage of people who have ever lived are alive today?\" can be traced to the 1970s.[8] The more dramatic phrasing of \"the living outnumber the dead\" also dates to the 1970s, a time of population explosion and growing fears of human overpopulation in the wake of decolonization and before the adoption of China's one-child policy. The claim that \"the living outnumber the dead\" was never accurate. Arthur C. Clarke in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) has the claim that \"Behind every man, now alive stand 30 ghosts, for that is the ratio by which the dead outnumber the living\", which was roughly accurate at the time of writing.[9][10]\n\nRecent estimates of the \"total number of people who have ever lived\" are in the order of 100 billion.[10][11] The answer depends on the definition of \"people\", i.e., whether only Homo sapiens are to be counted, or all of the genus Homo; due to the small population sizes in the Lower Paleolithic, however, the order of magnitude of the estimate is not affected by the choice of cut-off date substantially more than by the uncertainty of estimates throughout the Neolithic to Iron Age.[12] Importantly, the estimate is also affected by the estimate of infant mortalities vs. stillborn infants, due to the very high rate of infant mortality throughout the pre-modern period. An estimate on the \"total number of people who have ever lived\" as of 1995 was calculated by Haub (1995) at \"about 105 billion births since the dawn of the human race\" with a cut-off date at 50,000 BC (beginning of the Upper Paleolithic), and inclusion of a high infant mortality rate throughout pre-modern history.[13]\n\nHistorical population\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore 1950\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following table uses astronomical year numbering for dates, negative numbers corresponding roughly to the corresponding year BC (for example, −8,000 = 8,000 BC, etc.). The table starts counting approximately 10,000 years before present, or around 8,000 BC, during the middle Greenlandian, about 1,700 years after the end of the Younger Dryas and 1,800 years before the 8.2-kiloyear event.\n\nFrom the beginning of the early modern period until the 20th century, world population has been characterized by a faster-than-exponential growth. For the period of Classical antiquity to the Middle Ages, roughly 500 BC to AD 1500, there was also a general tendency of growth (estimated at a factor 4 to 5 over the 2,000-year period), but not strictly monotonic: A noticeable dip in world population is assumed due to the Black Death in the mid-14th century.[14]\n\nYear PRB\n\n(1973–2016)[15] UN\n\n(2015)[16] Maddison\n\n(2008)[17] HYDE\n\n(2010)[18] Tanton\n\n(1994)[19] Biraben\n\n(1980)[20] McEvedy &\n\nJones (1978)[21] Thomlinson\n\n(1975)[22] Durand\n\n(1974)[23] Clark\n\n(1967)[24] Gapminder −10000 2M[25] 4M 1–10M 4M −9000 4M −8000 5M 5M 5–10M −7000 7M 8M −6000 14M 11M −5000 27M 18M[25] 5M 5–20M 5M −4000 50M 28M 7M 7M −3000 100M 45M 14M 14M −2000 72M 27M 27M −1000 100M 115M 50M 50M −500 150M −200 227M 150M 150M 1 300M[26] 300M 231M[27] 188M[25] 150M 255M 170M 200M 270–330M 256M[28] 170M 100 195M 200 202M 256M 190M 190M 300 205M 350 254M 400 209M 206M 190M 190M 500 280M 210M[25] 206M 190M 190M 600 213M 206M 200M 237M 200M 700 226M 207M 210M 207M 800 240M 224M 220M 261M 224M 900 269M 226M 240M 226M 1000 400M 310M 267M 295M[25] 254M 265M 275–345M 280M 254M 1100 450M 353M 301M 320M 301M 1200 500M 393M 400M 360M 384M 400M 1250 400M 416M 416M 1300 500M 392M 300M 432M 360M 400M 432M 1340 443M 378M 443M 1400 500M 390M 374M 350M 374M 1500 600M 500M 438M 461M[25] 460M 425M 440–540M 427M 460M 1600 600M 556M 554M[25] 579M 545M 498M 579M 1650 (<700M)[14] 545M 500M 516M 579M 1700 660M 1000M 603M[25] 1000M 1079M 1000M 1041M 1079M 1750 791M 814M 700M 770M 1800 1,000M 978M 989M[25] 900M 900M 985M 1820 1,042M 1,093M 1850 1,265M 1,262M 1,263M 1,241M 1,200M 1,200M 1,278M 1870 1,276M 1,347M 1875 1,325M 1,383M 1900 1,656M 1,650M 1,563M 1,654M[25] 1,600M 1,633M 1,625M 1,600M 1,650–1,710M 1,668M 1,645M 1910 1,750M 1,777M 1,790M 1913 1,793M 1,829M 1920 1,860M 1,863M 1,912M 1,968M 1,924M 1925 2,000M 2,000M 2,007M 1930 2,070M 2,092M 2,145M 2,100M 1940 2,300M 2,299M 2,307M 2,340M 2,324M\n\n1950 to 2016\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter World War II, demographic data of some accuracy becomes available for a significant number of countries, and population estimates are often given as grand totals of numbers (typically given by country) of widely diverging accuracies.
