        "text": "Estimates of current population size, known as abundance estimates, are derived from a combination of fieldwork and computer modelling. Vessel-based and aerial sighting surveys, acoustic monitoring, and analysis of individual animal markings are techniques used independently or in conjunction with each other to count whales. The information gathered from this fieldwork is used as the basis for population modelling which produces an abundance estimate.\n\nIn 2017, the IWC Scientific Committee established a new expert group to review and agree all the Abundance Estimates submitted to the Scientific Committee. This new process ensures quality and consistency across all the estimates used by the IWC.\n\nClick here to read more about the establishment and work of the Scientific Committee’s Working Group on Abundance Estimates (ASI).\n\nIt is impossible for cetacean abundance estimates to be completely precise and IWC estimates are presented as a ‘best estimate’ figure, accompanied by a 95% Confidence Interval, showing a range of plausible values for the population's actual abundance. As an example, the table below shows that the 1991/92-2003/4 abundance estimate for Southern Hemisphere blue whales is 2,300 with a 95% confidence interval of 1,150-4,500. This means that the range 1,150-4,500 was computed using a method that has a 95% chance of including the population's actual abundance.\n\nIncreases or decreases in population are indicated within the table, where these have been identified.\n\nAt present the IWC has agreed estimates only for some species/areas. With the establishment of the ASI group it is planned to update this table and fill in the gaps where possible.\n\nThe IWC’s most recent Abundance Estimates\n\nMINKE WHALES\n\nYear(s) to which estimate applies estimate Approximate 95% CI\n\nSouthern Hemisphere\n\n1985/86-1990/91\n\n720,000\n\n510,000 – 1,010,000\n\n1991/92-2003/04\n\n515,000\n\n360,000 – 730,000\n\nNorth Atlantic\n\n- Northeast & Central\n\n2014-2019\n\n150,000\n\n112,000 –201,000\n\n- Northeast\n\n1989\n\n65,000\n\n44,000 – 95,000\n\n1995\n\n112,000\n\n91,000 – 138,000\n\n1996-2000\n\n80,000\n\n59,000 – 108,000\n\n2003-2007\n\n81,000\n\n51,000 – 128,000\n\n2008-2013\n\n90,000\n\n62,000 – 128,000\n\n2014-2019\n\n104,700\n\n75,200 –145,750\n\n- Central\n\n2005-2007\n\n50,000\n\n30,000 – 83,000\n\n2015-2016\n\n64,000\n\n43,000 –93,000\n\n- West Greenland\n\n2007\n\n9,100\n\n4,300 – 19,000\n\n2015\n\n5,100\n\n2,100 – 12,000\n\nNorth Pacific\n\n- North West Pacific and Okhotsk Sea\n\n1990-91\n\n28,000\n\n17,000 – 45,000\n\n2003\n\n20,000\n\n13,000 – 30,000\n\n- Sea of Japan\n\n2004-2006\n\n4,200\n\n2,700 – 6,300\n\nBLUE WHALES\n\nYear(s) to which estimate applies Approximate point estimate Approximate 95% CI\n\nSouthern Hemisphere\n\n(excluding pygmy blue)\n\n1978/79-1983/84 450\n\n200 – 1,000\n\n1985/86-1990/91\n\n560\n\n200 – 1,400\n\n1991/92-2003/04\n\n2,300\n\n1,150 – 4,500\n\nThe estimated rate of increase of Southern Hemisphere Blue whales is 8.2% (95% confidence interval 3.8-12.5%) per year between 1978/79 and 2003/04\n\nNorth Pacific\n\n- Eastern\n\n2008\n\n2,500\n\n1,700 – 3,600\n\nFIN WHALES"
