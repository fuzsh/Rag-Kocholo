Spain population 2024

During 2024 Spain population is projected to decrease by -95,965 people and reach 46,264,011 in the beginning of 2025. The natural increase is expected to be positive, as the number of births will exceed the number of deaths by 22,716. If external migration will remain on the previous year level, the population will be declined by 118,682 due to the migration reasons. It means that the number of people who leave Spain to settle permanently in another country (emigrants) will prevail over the number of people who move into the country (to which they are not native) in order to settle there as permanent residents (immigrants).

Population change rates in 2024

According to our estimations, daily change rates of Spain population in 2024 will be the following:

1,181 live births average per day (49.22 in an hour)

1,119 deaths average per day (46.62 in an hour)

-325 emigrants average per day (-13.55 in an hour)

The population of Spain will be declining by 263 persons daily in 2024.

Demographics of Spain 2023

As of 1 January 2024, the population of Spain was estimated to be 46,359,976 people. This is a decrease of -0.21 % (-96,164 people) compared to population of 46,456,140 the year before. In 2023 the natural increase was positive, as the number of births exceeded the number of deaths by 22,764. Due to external migration, the population declined by 118,928. The sex ratio of the total population was 0.976 (976 males per 1,000 females) which is lower than global sex ratio. The global sex ratio in the world was approximately 1,016 males to 1,000 females as of 2023.

Spain population density

Spain population density is 91.7 people per square kilometer (237.6/mi2) as of August 2024. Density of population is calculated as permanently settled population of Spain divided by total area of the country. Total area is the sum of land and water areas within international boundaries and coastlines of Spain. The total area of Spain is 505,370 km2 (195,124 mi2) according to the United Nations Statistics Division .

Spain age structure

As of the beginning of 2024 according to our estimates Spain had the following population age distribution:

15.1 67.7 17.1

- percentage of population under 15 - percentage of population between 15 and 64 years old - percentage of population 65+

In absolute figures (estimate):

7,022,146 young people under 15 years old ( 3,615,615 males / 3,406,531 females)

31,406,102 persons between 15 and 64 years old ( 15,901,008 males / 15,505,094 females)

7,931,728 persons above 64 years old ( 3,361,098 males / 4,570,630 females)

We prepared a simplified model of the population distribution pyramid which is broken down into 3 main age groups. The groups are the same as we used above: population under 15, between 15 and 64 and population which is over 65 year old.

65+

15-64

0-14

male female

Note: The pyramid provided is not corresponding to data given above because the age groups have different number of years.

As we can see the Spain population pyramid has a contracting type. This type of pyramid is more common for highly developed countries with low birth and death rates. Usually countries with such kind of population age distribution model have long life expectancy, high level of education and good health care.

Age dependency ratio

Dependency ratio of population is a ratio of people who are generally not in the labor force (the dependents) to workforce of a country (the productive part of population). The dependent part includes the population under 15 years old and people aged 65 and over. The productive part of population accordingly consists of population between 15 and 64 years.

This ratio shows the pressure on productive population produced by the dependent part of population.

The total dependency ratio of population in Spain is 47.6 %.

The value of 47.6 % is relatively low. It shows that the dependent part of population is less than a half of the working part. In other words the working population (labor force) in Spain must provide goods for itself and cover expenditure on children and aged persons. And this part of population is less than 50% of working population. The value of less than 50% means that the pressure on productive population in Spain is relatively low.

Child dependency ratio

Child dependency ratio is a ratio of people below working age (under 15) to workforce of a country.

Child dependency ratio in Spain is 22.4 %.

Aged dependency ratio

Aged dependency ratio is a ratio of people above working age (65+) to workforce of a country.

Aged dependency ratio in Spain is 25.3 %.

Life expectancy

Life expectancy at birth is one of the most important demographic indicator. It shows the number of years a newborn infant would live assuming that birth and death rates will remain at the same level during the whole lifetime.

Total life expectancy (both sexes) at birth for Spain is 81.2 years.

This is above the average life expectancy at birth of the global population which is about 71 years (according to Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations).

Male life expectancy at birth is 78.2 years.

Female life expectancy at birth is 84.4 years.

Literacy of population

According to our estimates 38,589,170 persons or 98.1% of adult population (aged 15 years and above) in Spain are able to read and write. Accordingly about 748,660 adults are illiterate.

Literacy rate for adult male population is 98.75% (19,020,559 persons). 241,547 are illiterate.

Literacy rate for adult female population is 97.47% (19,568,611 persons). 507,113 are illiterate.

Youth literacy rates are 99.72% and 99.77% for males and females accordingly. The overall youth literacy rate is 99.74%. Youth literacy rate definition covers the population between the ages of 15 to 24 years.
