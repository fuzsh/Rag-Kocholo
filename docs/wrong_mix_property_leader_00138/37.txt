The difference was only 12 votes, but Cape Verde finally has a new president.

After an 11-day wait since the election runoff Feb. 25, officials announced yesterday that Pedro Pires is the new president of Cape Verde, according to Portuguese news agency LUSA.

Mr. Pires, who was backed by the ruling PAICV party of Prime Minister Jose Maria Neves, won the highly contested election over former Prime Minister Carlos Veiga. The difference was only 12 votes out of more than 150,000 cast.

Mr. Pires had also won the first round of the elections Feb. 11.

The formal announcement of victory for Mr. Pires followed Supreme Court rulings Wednesday on results of several precincts contested by both Mr. Pires and his opposition-backed rival

No date has yet been set for Pires to take office.

Local Cape Verdeans felt relieved by the announcement after waiting anxiously for the past two weeks.

Cape Verdeans worldwide, including here, were able to vote in the country's third presidential election.

"I watched it on the news today," said Jose Semedo of New Bedford. "I was worried because we didn't know who won and who lost, but everything worked out in the end."

Mr. Semedo is one of the many local Cape Verdeans who supported Mr. Pires for president.

Yesterday it was unclear if Mr. Pires won a majority of votes in New Bedford or the United States. Election officials in Boston weren't available yesterday to comment on the issue.

Mr. Pires had obtained more votes in New Bedford during the first round of the election. He had also won overall in the United States.

Mr. Semedo thinks Mr. Pires got more votes, but he said it didn't make a difference who won.

"The other candidate wasn't bad," he said. "This one may have just a bit more experience because he is older."

After learning of the court's rulings late Wednesday, Mr. Pires said he pledged "to give my best" toward promoting unity and reconciliation after the bitterly fought elections.
