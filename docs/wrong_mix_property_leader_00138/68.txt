On 31 July 1945, Cape Verdean writer, publisher and lawyer Germano de Almeida (also known as Germano Almeida) was born on the island of Boa Vista, Portuguese Cape Verde. After completing elementary school on Boa Vista, he attended various secondary schools in the capital Praia (on the island of Santiago) and on the island of São Vicente.

At the age of 18, Almeida joined the armed forces and served his duty in Angola. In 1972, he won a scholarship to study law in Lisbon. After completing his studies, he returned to Cape Verde. Almeida was appointed Attorney General of the archipelago in 1976. He held this office until 1979, after which he moved to Mindelo (São Vicente Island) to practice law there.

While working as lawyer, Almeida developed a penchant for writing. In 1983, he founded the magazine Ponto & Vírgula and in the same year published his first work Estórias (Stories) under the pseudonym Romualdo Cruz. In 1989, he joined the publishing house Ilhéu, through which he then published most of his works.

Almeida's works have been translated into numerous languages. He is one of the best-known writers in the Portuguese-speaking world outside of Portugal and Brazil. He is known for his writing style, in which he interweaves real or autobiographical elements with fictional and humorous elements.

In 2010, the then Cape Verdean President Pedro Pires honoured him with an award for literary excellence. In 2018, Almeida was the second Cape Verdean author to receive the annual Prémio Camões, the most important literary prize in the Portuguese-speaking world, after the poet Arménio Vieira.
