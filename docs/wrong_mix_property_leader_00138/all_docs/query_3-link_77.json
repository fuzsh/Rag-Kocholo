Without proper rendering support, you may see question marks, boxes, or other symbols instead of Unicode characters. For an introductory guide on IPA symbols, see Help:IPA.\n\nCape Verdean Creole is a Portuguese-based creole language spoken on the islands of Cape Verde.[4] It is the native creole language of virtually all Cape Verdeans and is used as a second language by the Cape Verdean diaspora.\n\nThe creole has particular importance for creolistics studies since it is the oldest living creole.[5] It is the most widely spoken Portuguese-based creole language.\n\nThe full, formal name is Cape Verdean Creole (kabuverdianu), but in everyday usage the creole is simply called \"Creole\" (kriolu/kriol) by its speakers.\n\nThe history of Cape Verdean Creole is hard to trace due to a lack of written documentation and to ostracism during the Portuguese administration of Cape Verde.\n\nThere are presently three theories about the formation of Creole.[6] The monogenetic theory claims that the creole was formed by the Portuguese by simplifying the Portuguese language in order to make it accessible to enslaved African people. That is the point of view of authors like Prudent, Waldman, Chaudenson and Lopes da Silva. Authors like Adam and Quint argue that Creole was formed by enslaved African people using the grammar of Western African languages and replacing the African lexicon with the Portuguese one. Linguists like Chomsky and Bickerton argue that Creole was formed spontaneously, not by enslaved people from continental Africa, but by the population born in the islands, using the grammar with which all human beings are born; this would explain how creoles located many miles apart have similar grammatical structures, even though they have a different lexical basis.\n\nAccording to A. Carreira,[7] Cape Verdean Creole was formed from a Portuguese pidgin, on the island of Santiago, starting from the 15th century. That pidgin was then transported to the west coast of Africa by the lançados. From there, that pidgin diverged into two proto-Creoles, one that was the base of all Cape Verdean Creoles, and another that was the base of the Guinea-Bissau Creole.\n\nCross referencing information regarding the settlement of each island with the linguistic comparisons, it is possible to form some conjectures. The spreading of Cape Verdean Creole within the islands was done in three phases:[8]\n\nIn a first phase, the island of Santiago was occupied (2nd half of the 15th century), followed by Fogo (end of the 16th century).\n\nIn a second phase, the island of São Nicolau was occupied (mostly in the 2nd half of the 17th century), followed by Santo Antão (mostly in the 2nd half of the 17th century).\n\nIn a third phase, the remaining islands were occupied by settlers from the first islands: Brava was occupied by people from Fogo (mostly in the beginning of the 18th century), Boa Vista by people from São Nicolau and Santiago (mostly in the 1st half of the 18th century), Maio by people from Santiago and Boa Vista (mostly in the 2nd half of the 18th century), São Vicente by people from Santo Antão and São Nicolau (mostly in the 19th century), Sal by people from São Nicolau and Boa Vista (mostly in the 19th century).\n\nIn spite of Creole being the first language of nearly all the population in Cape Verde, Portuguese is still the official language. As Portuguese is used in everyday life (at school, in administration, in official acts, in relations with foreign countries, etc.), Portuguese and Cape Verdean Creole live in a state of diglossia,[9] and code switching occurs between the creole and standard Portuguese in informal speech. Due to this overall presence of Portuguese, a decreolization process occurs for all the different Cape Verdean Creole variants.\n\nCheck in this fictional text:\n\nSantiago variant:\n\nQuêl mudjêr cú quêm m' encôntra ónti stába priocupáda púrqui êl sqêci dí sês minínus nâ scóla, í cándu êl bâi procurâ-'s êl câ olhâ-'s.

Alguém lembrou-lhe que as suas crianças estavam a precisar de material para uma pesquisa, então ela foi encontrá-las na biblioteca a procurar o que elas queriam. Para agradecer a todos os que ajudaram-na, ela começou a falar, dizendo como ela estava contente do fundo do coração.\n\nTranslation to English:\n\nThat woman with whom I met yesterday was worried because she forgot her children at school, and when she went to seek them she didn't see them. Someone reminded her that her children were needing some material for a research, and so she found them at the library searching what they needed. To thank to everyone who helped her, she started speaking, telling how she was glad from the bottom of her heart.\n\nIn this text, several cases of decreolization / Portuguese intromission can be noted:\n\ncú quêm / c' quêm – Portuguese order of words com quem;\n\nencôntra / encontrá – Portuguese lexicon, in Creole it would be more commonly átcha / otchá;\n\npriocupáda – Portuguese lexicon, in Creole it would be more commonly fadigáda;\n\npúrqui / púrq' – Portuguese lexicon, in Creole it would be more commonly pamódi / pamód';\n\nsês minínus / sês m'nín's – Portuguese influence (plural marker on both words);\n\nprocurâ-'s / procurá-'s – Portuguese lexicon, in Creole it would be more commonly spiâ-'s / spiá-'s;\n\nolhâ-'s / olhá-'s – Portuguese phonetics (intromission of the phoneme /ʎ/);\n\nquí / qu’ – Portuguese lexicon, the integrant conjunction in Creole is ’mâ;\n\nsâ tâ pricisába / táva ta pr'cisá – Portuguese lexicon, in Creole it would be more commonly sâ tâ mestêba / táva tâ mestê;\n\nmaterial, pesquisa, biblioteca – words pretty uncommon in a basilect; if they are Portuguese words used when speaking Creole they should be pronounced in Portuguese and written in italic or between quotation marks;\n\núqui / úq' – intromission of Portuguese o que;\n\ngradêci â / gradecê â – wrong preposition, the Portuguese preposition \"a\" does not exist in Creole;\n\nfála – this form (from contemporary Portuguese falar) is only used in São Vicente and Santo Antão, in the other islands the word is papiâ (from old Portuguese papear);\n\ncômu / côm' – intromission of Portuguese como;\n\ncuraçãu – Portuguese phonetics (reduction of the phoneme /o/ to /u/ and Portuguese pronunciation /ɐ̃w/ instead of Creole /õ/);\n\nThe same text \"corrected\":\n\nSantiago variant:\n\nQuêl mudjêr quí m' encôntra cú êl ónti stába fadigáda pamódi êl sqêci sês minínu nâ scóla, í cándu quí êl bâi spiâ-'s êl câ odjâ-'s.

Pâ gradecê pâ túd' quêm qu' j'dá-'l, êl c'meçá tâ fála, tâ dzê qu' manêra qu' êl táva contênt' d' fúnd' d' coraçõ.\n\nAs a consequence there is a continuum between basilectal and acrolectal varieties.\n\nIn spite of Creole not being officialized, a 2005 government resolution[10] put forth the necessary conditions for the officialization of Creole, which in turn has been superseded by a 2015 resolution.[11] This officialization has not yet occurred, mostly because the language is not yet standardized, for several reasons:\n\nThere is significant dialectal fragmentation. Speakers are reluctant to speak a variant that is not their own.\n\nAbsence of rules to establish which is the right form (and also the right spelling) to be adopted for each word. For example, for the word corresponding to the Portuguese word algibeira (\"pocket\"), A. Fernandes[12] records the forms algibêra, agibêra, albigêra, aljubêra, alj'bêra, gilbêra, julbêra, lijbêra.\n\nAbsence of rules to establish which are the lexical limits to be adopted. It is frequent for speakers of Creole, when writing, to join different grammatical classes.[13] For ex.: pâm... instead of pâ m'... \"for me to...\".\n\nAbsence of rules to establish which are the grammatical structures to be adopted. It is not just about dialectal differences; even within a single variant there are fluctuations. For ex.: in the Santiago variant, when there are two sentences and one is subordinated to the other, there is a tense agreement in the verbs (bú cría pâ m' dába \"you wanted me to give\" – both cría and dába are past tense), but some speakers do not practice it (bú cría pâ m' dâ – past then present – or bú crê pâ m' dába – present then past).\n\nThe writing system (ALUPEC) has not been well accepted by all Creole users.\n\nThe language levels (formal, informal, scientific, slang, etc.) are not well differentiated yet.\n\nThat is the reason why each speaker when speaking (or writing) uses their own dialect, their own sociolect, and their own idiolect.\n\nTo overcome these problems, some Creole advocates[14] propose the development of two standards: a North (Barlavento) standard, centered on the São Vicente variant, and a South (Sotavento) standard, centered on that of Santiago. If so, Creole would become a pluricentric language.\n\nThere exists no complete translation of the Bible. However, the \"Asosiason Kabuverdianu pa Traduson di Bíblia\" was established with the goal of translating the entire Bible in Kabuverdianu-Sotaventu and Kabuverdianu-Barlaventu.[15] They have translated approximately 40% of the New Testament in the Kabuverdianu-Sotaventu, and they have published Luke and Acts. The publication of Luke has won two awards in Cape Verde. Sérgio Frusoni translated Bartolomeo Rossetti's version of the Romanesco Italian poem Er Vangelo Seconno Noantri, which is a poem based on the Four Gospels. Frusoni translated the poem in the São Vicente Creole, Vangêle contód d'nôs móda.\n\nMain article: ALUPEC\n\nThe only writing system officially recognized by the authorities in Cape Verde is called the Alfabeto Unificado para a Escrita da Língua Cabo-verdiana (ALUPEC, lit. 'Unified Alphabet for the Writing of the Cape Verdean Language'), which was approved for official use on an experimental basis in 1998 by Decree-Law No. 67/98.[16] In 2009, Decree-Law No. 8/2009 officially institutionalized the use of the ALUPEC.[17] In spite of having been officially recognized by the government, the ALUPEC is neither required nor mandatorily used.[citation needed]\n\nIn spite of being the only system officially recognized, the same law allows the use of alternative writing models, \"as long as they are presented in a systematic and scientific way\". As not all users are familiarized with ALUPEC or the IPA, in this article a slightly different system will be used to make it easier for the reader:\n\nThe sound [s] will be represented in an etymological way (\"s\" when in Portuguese is \"s\", \"ss\" when in Portuguese is \"ss\", \"c\" when in Portuguese is \"c\", \"ç\" when in Portuguese is \"ç\") instead of ALUPEC always \"s\".\n\nThe sound [z] will be represented in an etymological way (\"s\" when in Portuguese is \"s\", \"z\" when in Portuguese is \"z\") instead of ALUPEC always \"z\".\n\nThe sound [tʃ] will be represented by \"tch\" instead of ALUPEC \"tx\".\n\nThe sound [ʃ] will be represented in an etymological way (\"x\" when in Portuguese is \"x\", \"ch\" when in Portuguese is \"ch\") instead of ALUPEC always \"x\".\n\nThe sound [ʒ] will be represented in an etymological way (\"j\" when in Portuguese is \"j\", \"g\" when in Portuguese is \"g\") instead of ALUPEC always \"j\".\n\nThe sound [k] will be represented in an etymological way (\"c\" when in Portuguese is \"c\", \"qu\" when in Portuguese is \"qu\") instead of ALUPEC always \"k\".\n\nThe sound [ɡ] will be represented in an etymological way (\"g\" when in Portuguese is \"g\", \"gu\" when in Portuguese is \"gu\") instead of ALUPEC always \"g\".\n\nThe nasality of the vowels will be represented by an \"m\" after the vowel, when this vowel is at the end of the word or before the letters \"p\" and \"b\". In the other cases the nasality will be represented by the letter \"n\".\n\nThe words will always have a graphic accent. This will be an overwhelming use of accents, but it is the only way to effectively represent both the stressed syllable and vowel aperture.\n\nTo show an elided vowel in certain variants an apostrophe ' will be used.\n\nThe vocabulary of Cape Verdean Creole comes mainly from Portuguese. Although several sources do not agree, the figures oscillate between 90 and 95% of words from Portuguese. The remaining comes from several languages from Western Africa (Mandingo, Wolof, Fulani, Temne, Balanta, Mandjak, etc.), and the vocabulary from other languages (English, French, Latin) is negligible.\n\nCape Verdean Creole's phonological system comes mainly from 15th-through-17th-century Portuguese. In terms of conservative features, Creole has kept the affricate consonants /dʒ/ and /tʃ/ (written \"j\" (in the beginning of words) and \"ch\", in old Portuguese) which are not in use in today's Portuguese, and the pre-tonic vowels were not reduced as in today's European Portuguese. In terms of innovative features, the phoneme /ʎ/ (written \"lh\" in Portuguese) has evolved to /dʒ/ and the vowels have undergone several phonetic phenomena.\n\nThere are eight oral vowels and their corresponding nasal counterparts, making a total of sixteen vowels:\n\nFront Central Back oral nasal oral nasal oral nasal Close i ĩ u ũ Close-mid e ẽ o õ Open-mid ɛ ɛ̃ ɐ ɐ̃ ɔ ɔ̃ Open a ã\n\nLabial Dental/\n\nAlveolar Postalveolar/\n\nPalatal Velar Uvular Nasal m n ɲ ŋ Plosive p b t d k ɡ Affricate tʃ dʒ Fricative f v s z ʃ ʒ (ʁ) Tap ɾ Trill (r) ʀ Approximant w j Lateral l ʎ\n\nNote: The sounds [r], [ʁ] and [ʀ] are variants of the same phoneme /ʀ/.\n\nThe personal pronoun that represents the subject form of the first person singular has a variable pronunciation according to the islands.\n\nThis pronoun comes from the object form of the first person singular in Portuguese mim, and it is phonetically reduced to the sound [m].\n\nThis pronunciation is nowadays found in the Barlavento variants. In the Sotavento variants that consonant [m] was reduced to a simple nasality [n̩]. For example: m' andâ [n̩ ɐ̃ˈdɐ] ('I have walked'), m' stâ tâ sintí [n̩ stɐ tɐ sĩˈti] ('I am feeling'), m' labába [n̩ lɐˈbabɐ] ('I had washed'). Before plosive or affricate consonants this nasality becomes homorganic nasal of the following consonant. For ex.: m' bêm [m bẽ] ('I came'), m' têm [n tẽ] ('I have'), m' tchigâ [ɲ tʃiˈɡɐ] ('I arrived'), m' crê [ŋ kɾe] ('I want').\n\nSpeakers who are strongly influenced by the Portuguese language tend to pronounce this pronoun as a nasal vowel úm [ũ] instead of m' [m].\n\nBefore some forms of the verb sêr this pronoun takes back its full form mí [mi], in whatever variant: mí ê [mi e] ('I am'), mí éra [mi ˈɛɾɐ] ('I was').\n\nIn this article, this pronoun is conventionally written m', no matter the variant.\n\nEven though over 90% of Cape Verdean Creole words are derived from Portuguese, the grammar is very different, which makes it extremely difficult for an untrained Portuguese native speaker even to understand a basic conversation. On the other hand, the grammar shows a lot of similarities with other creoles, Portuguese-based or not (see syntactic similarities of creoles).\n\nThe basic sentence structure in Creole is Subject – Verb – Object. Ex.:\n\nÊl tâ cumê pêxi. \"He eats fish.\"\n\nWhen there are two objects, the indirect object comes first while the direct object comes after, and the sentence structure becomes Subject – Verb – Indirect Object – Direct Object. Ex.:\n\nÊl tâ dâ pêxi cumída. \"He gives food to the fish.\"\n\nA feature that makes Cape Verdean Creole closer to other creoles is the possibility of double negation (ex.: Náda m' câ atchâ. liter. \"Nothing I didn't find.\"), or sometimes even triple negation (ex.: Núnca ninguêm câ tâ bába lâ. liter. \"Never nobody didn't go there.\"). Although double negation is common in Portuguese (e.g. \"Nunca ninguém foi lá\"), triple negation is a little bit uncommon.\n\nOnly the animated nouns (human beings and animals) have gender inflection. Ex.:\n\ninglês / inglésa \"Englishman / Englishwoman\"\n\npôrcu / pórca \"pig (male) / pig (female)\"\n\nIn some cases the distinction between sexes is made putting the adjectives mátchu \"male\" and fémia \"female\" after the nouns. Ex.:\n\nfídju-mátchu / fídju-fémia \"son / daughter\"\n\ncatchôrr'-mátchu / catchôrr'-fémia \"dog (male) / dog (female)\"\n\nThe nouns in Creole have number inflection (plural marks) only when they are well determined or known in the context. Ex.:\n\nMinínus dí Bía ê bêm comportádu. (\"The children of Bia are well behaved.\")\n\nWhen the noun refers to something in general that noun does not have number inflection. Ex.:\n\nMinínu devê ruspetâ alguêm grándi. (\"Children must respect grown up people.\")\n\nIf in a sentence there are several grammatical categories, only the first bears the plural marker. Ex.:\n\nminínus (\"boys\")\n\nnhâs minína (\"my girls\")\n\nminínus bunítu (\"beautiful boys\")\n\nnhâs dôs minína buníta í simpática (\"my two kind and beautiful girls\")\n\nFurther reading: Manuel Veiga. \"5.2 – Flexões dos substantivos\". Introdução à Gramática do Crioulo (in Portuguese) (2 ed.). pp. 139–141.\n\nAccording to their function, the pronouns can be subject pronouns or object pronouns. Furthermore, in each of these functions, according to the position within the sentence the pronouns can be unstressed or stressed.\n\nThe unstressed subject pronouns generally bear the function of the subject and come before the verb. Ex.:\n\nNú crê. \"We want.\"\n\nThe stressed subject pronouns bear the function of some kind of vocative and usually are separated from the verb (disjunctive pronouns). Ex.:\n\nMí, m' stâ lí, í bô, bú stâ lâ. \"Me, I am here, and you, you are there.\"\n\nThe object pronouns, as the name shows, bear the function of the object (direct or indirect). The unstressed object pronouns are used with the present-tense forms of verbs. Ex.:\n\nM' odjá-'l. \"I have seen it.\"\n\nM' tâ bejá-bu. \"I kiss you.\"\n\nThe stressed object pronouns are used with the past-tense forms of verbs, when they are the second pronoun in a series of two pronouns, and after prepositions (prepositional pronouns). Ex.:\n\nÊs tâ odjába-êl. \"They saw it.\"\n\nBú dâ-m'-êl. \"You gave it to me.\"\n\nM' stâ fártu dí bô! \"I'm fed up of you!\"\n\nWhen there are two object pronouns, the indirect pronoun comes first while the direct pronoun comes after, and the sentence structure becomes Subject – Verb – Indirect Pronoun – Direct Pronoun.\n\nThere are no reflexive pronouns. To indicate reflexivity, Creole uses the expression cabéça (\"head\") after the possessive determiner. Ex.:\n\nÊs mordê sês cabéça. \"They have bitten themselves.\"\n\nThere are no reciprocal pronouns. To indicate reciprocity, Creole uses the expression cumpanhêru (\"companion\"). Ex.:\n\nÊs mordê cumpanhêru. \"They have bitten each other.\"\n\nThe verbs have only minimal inflection (two forms). They have the same form for all the persons, and the notions of tense, mood and aspect are expressed through the presence (or absence) of certain morphemes (called \"verbal actualizers\" by Veiga[14]), as in the majority of creoles.\n\nThe verbs are generally reduced to two base forms, one for the present, another for the past. The form for the present is the same as the form for the infinitive (exception: sêr \"to be\"), that in turn comes, in the majority of the verbs, from the infinitive in Portuguese but without the final r. Ex.: cantâ /kɐ̃ˈtɐ/ (from Portuguese cantar), mexê /meˈʃe/ (from Portuguese mexer), partí /pɐɾˈti/ (from Portuguese partir), compô /kõˈpo/ (from Portuguese compor), *lumbú /lũˈbu/ (from Portuguese lombo). The form for the past is formed from the infinitive to which is joined the particle for the past ~ba. Ex.: cantába /kɐ̃ˈtabɐ/, mexêba /meˈʃebɐ/, partíba /pɐɾˈtibɐ/, compôba /kõˈpobɐ/, *lumbúba /lũˈbubɐ/ (in the Barlavento variants, the particle for the past ~va (or ~ba) is joined to the imperfective actualizer, and not to the verb). It is noteworthy that the Upper Guinea creoles (Cape Verdean Creole and Guinea-Bissau Creole) put the past tense marker after the verbs, and not before like the majority of creoles (check syntactic similarities of creoles).\n\nIt is important to mention that in the Santiago variant, the stress goes back to before the last syllable in the present tense forms of the verbs. Therefore, we have: cánta /ˈkãtɐ/ instead of cantâ /kɐ̃ˈtɐ/, mêxe /ˈmeʃe/ or mêxi /ˈmeʃi/ instead of mexê /meˈʃe/, pârti /ˈpɐɾti/ instead of partí /pɐɾˈti/, cômpo /ˈkõpo/ or cômpu /ˈkõpu/ instead of compô /kõˈpo/, búmbu /ˈbũbu/ instead of bumbú /bũˈbu/. In the pronominal forms, however, the stress remains on the last syllable: cantâ-m' /kɐ̃ˈtɐ̃/, mexê-bu /meˈʃebu/, partí-'l /pɐɾˈtil/, compô-nu /kõˈponu/, bumbú-'s /bũˈbuz/.\n\nAs said before, the regular verbs are reduced to a form for the present tense and a form for the past tense, and the notions of mood and aspect are expressed through verbal actualizers.\n\nThe following table shows a paradigm of the indicative mood with the verb dâ \"to give\" in the first-person singular:\n\nPresent Tense Past Tense Perfective aspect M' dâ M' dába Imperfective aspect M' tâ dâ M' tâ dába Progressive aspect M' stâ tâ dâ M' stába tâ da\n\nThe perfective aspect of the present is used when the speech refers to present situations, but that are finished, that are complete. Ex.:\n\nM' dâ. [m dɐ] \"I gave. / I have given.\"\n\nIt corresponds roughly, according to context, to the past tense or present perfect in English.\n\nThe imperfective aspect of the present is used when the speech refers to present situations, but that are not finished yet, that are incomplete. Ex.:\n\nM' tâ dâ. [m tɐ dɐ] \"I give.\"\n\nIt corresponds roughly to the present tense in English.\n\nThe progressive aspect of the present is used when the speech refers to present situations that are happening in a continuous, uninterrupted way. Ex.:\n\nM' stâ tâ dâ. [m stɐ tɐ dɐ] \"I am giving.\"\n\nIt corresponds roughly to the present continuous tense in English.\n\nNote: Actually, this model doesn't exist anymore. It has evolved to M' stâ dâ. [n stɐ dɐ] in Brava Fogo and Maio, to M' sâ tâ dâ. [n sɐ tɐ dɐ] in Santiago, to M' tâ tâ dâ. [m tɐ tɐ dɐ] in Boa Vista, Sal and São Nicolau and to M' ti tâ dá. [m ti tɐ da] in São Vicente and Santo Antão.\n\nThere is no specific form for the future. The future of the present may be expressed through three resources:\n\nUsing the imperfective of the present but bearing the function of the future. Ex.: M' tâ dâ manhã. [m tɐ dɐ mɐˈɲɐ̃] liter. \"I give tomorrow.\"\n\nUsing the auxiliary verb \"to go\". Ex.: M' tâ bái dâ. [m tɐ baj dɐ] liter. \"I go to give.\"\n\nUsing a periphrasis showing an eventuality. Ex.: M' ál dâ. [m al dɐ] \"I will give.\"\n\nIt corresponds roughly to the future tense in English.\n\nThe perfective aspect of the past is used when the speech refers to past situations that were finished, or complete. Ex.:\n\nM' dába. [m ˈdabɐ] \"I had given.\"\n\nIt corresponds roughly to the past perfect in English.\n\nNote: This form does not exist in the Barlavento variants.\n\nThe imperfective aspect of the past is used when the speech refers to past situations that were not finished yet, or incomplete. Ex.:\n\nM' tâ dába. [m tɐ ˈdabɐ] \"I gave. / I used to give.\"\n\nIt corresponds roughly to the past tense in English.\n\nNote: In the Barlavento variants the particle for the past is joined to the imperfective actualizer and not to the verb: M' táva dâ. [m ˈtavɐ dɐ]. In São Nicolau, along with M' táva dâ also subsists the older form M' tá dába [m ta ˈdabɐ].\n\nThe progressive aspect of the past is used when the speech refers to past situations that were happening in a continuous and uninterrupted way. Ex.:\n\nM' stába tâ dâ. [m ˈstabɐ tɐ dɐ] \"I was giving.\"\n\nIt corresponds roughly to the past continuous tense in English.\n\nNote: Actually, this model only exists in Brava and Fogo. It has evolved to M' sâ tâ dába. [n sɐ tɐ ˈdabɐ] in Santiago and Maio and to M' táva tâ dâ. [m ˈtavɐ tɐ dɐ] in Boa Vista, Sal, São Nicolau, São Vicente and Santo Antão.\n\nThere is no specific form for the future. The future of the past may be expressed through three resources:\n\nUsing the imperfective of the past but bearing the function of the future. Ex.: M' tâ dába manhã. [m tɐ ˈdabɐ mɐˈɲɐ̃] liter. \"I gave tomorrow.\"\n\nUsing the auxiliary verb \"to go\". Ex.: M' tâ bába dâ. [m tɐ ˈbabɐ dɐ] liter. \"I went to give.\"\n\nUsing a periphrasis showing an eventuality. Ex.: M' ál dába. [m al ˈdabɐ] \"I would give.\"\n\nIt corresponds roughly to the conditional in English.\n\nThe remaining moods – subjunctive, conditional (not the same as \"conditional\" in English), eventual – do not have different aspects, only present and past tense, except the injunctive (imperative) mood which has only the present tense.\n\nThere is a group of verbs that do not follow the paradigmatic model presented above. They are the auxiliary verbs sêr /seɾ/ \"to be\", stâ /stɐ/ \"to be\", têm /tẽ/ \"to have\" and tenê /teˈne/ \"to have\", and the modal verbs crê /kɾe/ \"to want\", sabê /sɐˈbe/ \"to know\", podê /poˈde/ \"can\", devê /deˈve/ \"must\" and mestê /mesˈte/ \"to need\".\n\nNote.: The designation \"auxiliary verbs\" is not consensual.\n\nThere exist two registers for these verbs.\n\nIn the first register (in older speakers, in rural areas speakers or in speakers with little exposure to Portuguese) there are only two forms for the verbs: one for the present (ê /e/, stâ /stɐ/, têm /tẽ/, tenê /teˈne/, crê /kɾe/, sabê /sɐˈbe/, podê /poˈde/, devê /deˈve/, mestê /mesˈte/) and one for the past (éra /ˈɛɾɐ/, stába /stabɐ/, têmba /tẽbɐ/, tenêba /teˈnebɐ/, crêba /kɾebɐ/, sabêba /sɐˈbebɐ/, podêba /poˈdebɐ/, devêba /deˈvebɐ/, mestêba /mesˈtebɐ/). However, on the contrary of regular verbs, when the base form is used alone it represents the imperfective aspect and not the perfective aspect. Therefore, mí ê, m' têm, m' crê, m' sabê mean \"I am, I have, I want, I know\", and not \"I've been, I've had, I've wanted, I've known\", as it would be expected. Parallelly, mí éra, m' têmba, m' crêba, m' sabêba mean \"I was, I had, I wanted, I knew\", and not \"I had been, I had had, I had wanted, I had known\", as would be expected.\n\nIn the second register (among younger speakers, in urban areas or in speakers with more exposure to Portuguese) the system has been enriched with other forms influenced by Portuguese. Therefore, we have:\n\nê /e/, stâ /stɐ/, têm /tẽ/, crê /kɾe/, sabê /sɐˈbe/, podê /poˈde/, devê /deˈve/, mestê /mesˈte/ for the imperfective of the present;\n\nfôi /foj/, stêvi /ˈstevi/, têvi /ˈtevi/, crís /kɾis/, sôbi /ˈsobi/, púdi /ˈpudi/ for the perfective of the present;\n\néra /ˈɛɾɐ/, stába /ˈstabɐ/, tínha /ˈtiɲɐ/, cría /ˈkɾiɐ/, sabía /sɐˈbiɐ/, pudía /puˈdiɐ/, divía /diˈviɐ/, mistía /misˈtiɐ/ for the imperfective of the past;\n\nsêrba /ˈseɾbɐ/, stába /ˈstabɐ/, têmba /ˈtẽbɐ/, crêba /ˈkɾebɐ/, sabêba /sɐˈbebɐ/, podêba /poˈdebɐ/, devêba /deˈvebɐ/, mestêba /mesˈtebɐ/ for the perfective of the past;\n\nNote.: Some authors[18] call these verbs \"stative verbs\" and to these verbs they add others: gostâ, conxê, merecê, morâ, tchomâ, valê. However that designation is contested: not all those verbs are in fact stative; not all those verbs are irregular (for ex. morâ); some of those verbs are regular in some variants (m' tâ gostâ – imperfective of the present with tâ), and irregulars in other variants (m' gostâ – imperfective of the present but without tâ).\n\nThere is a parallelism between the pair of the verbs sêr / stâ \"to be\" and the pair of the verbs têm / tenê \"to have\".\n\nThe verb sêr is a copulative verb that expresses a permanent quality. Ex.:\n\nMí ê úm ómi. /mi e ũ ˈɔmi/ \"I am (I've always been and I will always be) a man.\"\n\nThe verb stâ is a copulative verb that expresses a temporary state. Ex.:\n\nÊl stâ trísti. /el stɐ ˈtɾisti/ \"He is (in this precise moment) sad.\"\n\nThe verb têm is a possessive verb that expresses a permanent quality. Ex.:\n\nM' têm péli scúru. /m tẽ ˈpɛli ˈskuɾu/ \"I have (I had and I will always have) dark skin.\"\n\nThe verb tenê is a possessive verb that expresses a temporary possession. Ex.:\n\nM' tenê úm canéta nâ bôlsu. /m teˈne ũ kɐˈnɛtɐ nɐ ˈbolsu/ \"I have (in this precise moment) a pen in the pocket.\"\n\npermanent temporary copulative verbs sêr stâ possessive verbs têm tenê\n\nNote.: The verbs stâ and tenê do not have the progressive aspect: forms like *m' stâ tâ stâ or *m' stâ tâ tenê do not exist. The verb tenê does not exist in the Barlavento variants. In São Vicente and Santo Antão the verb stâ has the form stód' for the infinitive, tâ for the imperfective of the present, tív' for the perfective of the present, and táva for the imperfective of the past.\n\nCape Verdean Creole has two voices. The active voice is used when the subject is explicit. The passive voice is used when the subject is indeterminate or unknown. There is also two forms for the passive. The form for the present is made with the infinitive to which is joined the particle ~du. The form for the past is made with the infinitive to which is joined the particle ~da. Ex.:\n\nTâ papiádu inglês nâ Mérca. /tɐ pɐpiˈadu ĩˈɡlez nɐ ˈmɛɾkɐ/ \"English is spoken in America.\"\n\nM' inxinádu tâ andâ. /m ĩʃiˈnadu tɐ ɐ̃ˈdɐ/ \"I was taught to walk.\"\n\nÚm vêz, tâ cumêda tchêu mídju. /ũ vez tɐ kuˈmedɐ tʃew ˈmidʒu/ \"Once, one used to eat a lot of corn.\"\n\nNote.: In the Barlavento variants the form for the past does not exist.\n\nTo negate a verb, the negative adverb câ /kɐ/ is used after the subject and before any verbal actualizer. Ex.:\n\nNú câ tâ bebê. /nu kɐ tɐ beˈbe/ \"We don't drink.\"\n\nÊl câ tâ odjába. /el kɐ tɐ oˈdʒabɐ/ \"He didn't see.\"\n\nBú câ bái. /bu kɐ baj/ \"You haven't gone.\"\n\nIn the Santo Antão variant, the negative adverb is n' /n/. Ex.:\n\nNô n' dâ bibê. /no n dɐ biˈbe/ \"We don't drink.\"\n\nÊl n' dáva o'á. /el n davɐ oˈa/ \"He didn't see.\"\n\nBô n' bé. /bo n bɛ/ \"You haven't gone.\"\n\nIn imperative sentences the negative adverb câ /kɐ/ is always in the beginning. Ex.:\n\nCâ bú bái! /kɐ bu baj/ \"Don't go!\" (you – singular)\n\nCâ nhôs fazê! /kɐ ɲoz fɐˈze/ (Sotavento), Câ b'sôt' fazê! /kɐ bzot fɐˈze/ (Barlavento) \"Don't do!\" (you-plural)\n\nAnd in the Santo Antão variant:\n\nN' bô bé! /n bo bɛ/ \"Don't go!\" (you – singular)\n\nN' b'sôt' fezê! /n bzot feˈze/ \"Don't do!\" (you – plural)\n\nAdjectives in Creole almost always come after the noun. Only the animated nouns (human beings and animals) demand gender inflection in their adjectives. Ex.:\n\nómi fêiu / mudjêr fêia \"ugly man / ugly woman\"\n\nbódi prêtu / cábra préta \"black buck / black goat\"\n\nThe adjectives for unanimated nouns have the same form as the masculine adjectives. Ex.:\n\nbistídu bráncu \"white dress\"\n\ncamísa bráncu \"white shirt\"\n\nIn general the plural marker does not appear on adjectives since it comes in a preceding grammatical category.\n\nIn Creole there are no definite articles. If it is absolutely necessary to determine the noun, the demonstrative determiners are used instead.\n\nFor the indefinite articles there are two forms, one for the singular, another for the plural:\n\núm... /ũ/ \"a, an (singular)\", úns... /ũz/ \"a, an (plural)\"\n\nThe possessive determiners have number inflexion, but the plural refers to the objects possessed, and not to the owners. Ex.:\n\nnhâ cárru \"my car\"\n\nnhâs cárru \"my cars\"\n\nnôs cárru can be either \"our car\" or \"our cars\"\n\nThe demonstrative determiners have only two degrees of proximity: close to the speaker (êss \"this, these\") and away from the speaker (quêl \"that\", quês \"those\").\n\nNote.: Only the São Vicente and Santo Antão Creoles make a phonetic distinction between the singular êss /es/ (\"this\") and the plural ês /eʒ/ (\"these\").\n\nCreole possesses a special grammatical category for presenting or announcing something. It appears in two forms, one to present something near, (alí... /ɐˈli/) and another to present something far (alâ... /ɐˈlɐ/). Ex.:\n\nAlí nhâ fídju. \"Here is my son.\"\n\nAlá-'l tâ bái. \"There he goes.\"\n\nIn spite of Cape Verde's small size, each island has developed its own way of speaking Creole. Each of these nine ways (there are 10 islands, one of which is uninhabited) is justifiably a different dialect, but the scholars in Cape Verde usually call them \"variants\". These variants can be classified into two branches: in the South there are the Sotavento Creoles, which comprise the Brava, Fogo, Santiago and Maio variants; in the North there are the Barlavento Creoles, which comprise the Boa Vista, Sal, São Nicolau, São Vicente and Santo Antão variants.\n\nSince some lexical forms of Cape Verdean Creole can be different according to each variant, the words and the sentences in this article will be presented in compromise model, a kind of \"middle Creole\", in order to ease the understanding and in order not to favor any variant. Whenever it will be necessary the phonemic transcription (or sometimes the phonetic transcription) will be shown immediately after the word.\n\nFor the writing system, check the section Writing system.\n\nFrom a linguistic point of view, the most important variants are the Fogo, Santiago, São Nicolau and Santo Antão ones, and any deep study of Creole should approach at least these four. They are the only islands that have received slaves directly from the African continent, that possess the most conservative linguistic features, and that are the most distinct from each other.\n\nFrom a social point of view, the most important variants are the Santiago and São Vicente ones, and any light study of Creole should approach at least these two. They are the variants of the two bigger cities (Praia and Mindelo), the variants with the greatest number of speakers, and the variants with a glottophagist tendency over the neighboring ones.\n\nThese variants have significant literature:\n\nBrava: Eugénio Tavares\n\nFogo: Elsie Clews Parsons\n\nSantiago: Carlos Barbosa, Tomé Varela da Silva, Daniel Spínola\n\nSão Vicente: Sérgio Frusoni, Ovídio Martins\n\nSanto Antão: Luís Romano Madeira de Melo\n\nSotavento Creoles Barlavento Creoles English Fogo Santiago São Nicolau São Vicente Santo Antão Ês frâ-m'.\n\n[es fɾɐ̃] Ês flâ-m'.\n\n[es flɐ̃] Ês fló-m'.\n\n[es flɔm] Ês dzê-m'.\n\n[eʒ dzem] Ês dzê-m'.\n\n[eʒ dzem] They told me.

Some characteristics:\n\nThe imperfective aspect of the past is formed joining the particle for the past ~ba to the verb: tâ + V+ba.\n\nThe personal pronoun for the second person of the plural is nhôs.\n\nThe subject form of the personal pronoun for the first person of the singular is represented by a nasalization. Ex.: m' andâ pronounced /n̩ ɐ̃ˈdɐ/ instead of /m ɐ̃ˈdɐ/ \"I have walked\", m' stâ tâ sintí pronounced /n̩ stɐ tɐ sĩˈti/ instead of /m stɐ tɐ sĩˈti/ \"I am feeling\", m' labába pronounced /n̩ lɐˈbabɐ/ instead of /m lɐˈbabɐ/ \"I had washed\".\n\nThe object form of the personal pronoun for the first person of the singular disappears but nasalizes the preceding vowel. Ex.: lebâ-m' pronounced /leˈbɐ̃/ instead of /leˈbɐm/ \"take me\", metê-m' pronounced /meˈtẽ/ instead of /meˈtem/ \"put me\", cudí-m' pronounced /kuˈdĩ/ instead of /kuˈdim/ \"answer me\", compô-m' pronounced /kõˈpõ/ instead of /kõˈpom/ \"fix me\", bumbú-m' pronounced /bũˈbũ/ instead of /bũˈbum/ \"put me on the back\".\n\nBrava Creole is spoken mainly on Brava Island. Speakers number 8,000[citation needed]. One of the least spoken being seventh place and one of the firsts to have written literature, in which Eugénio Tavares wrote some of his poems.\n\nBesides the main characteristics of Sotavento Creoles, Brava Creole has the following:\n\nThe progressive aspect of the present is formed by putting stâ before the verbs: stâ + V.\n\nThe sound that originates from Portuguese /ɐ̃w/ (written ão) is /ɐ̃/ rather than /õ/. For example, coraçã /koɾɐˈsɐ̃/, not coraçõ /koɾɐˈsõ/ \"heart\"; mã /ˈmɐ̃/, not mõ /ˈmõ/ \"hand\"; razã /ʀɐˈzɐ̃/, not razõ /ʀɐˈzõ/ \"reason\".\n\nFogo Creole is spoken mainly in the Fogo of Cape Verde. It has around 50,000[citation needed] speakers or nearly 5% of Cape Verdean Creole speakers including the diaspora's second language speakers. The rankings of this form of Cape Verdean Creole is fourth after Santo Antão and ahead of Sal.\n\nBesides the main characteristics of Sotavento Creoles, Fogo has the following:\n\nThe progressive aspect of the present is formed by putting stâ before the verbs: stâ + V.\n\nThe sound that originates from Portuguese /ɐ̃w/ (written ão) is represented by /ɐ̃/ instead of /õ/. Ex. coraçã /koɾɐˈsɐ̃/ instead of coraçõ /koɾɐˈsõ/ \"heart\", mã /mɐ̃/ instead of mõ /mõ/ \"hand\", razã /ʀɐˈzɐ̃/ instead of razõ /ʀɐˈzõ/ \"reason\".\n\nThe sound /l/ switches to /ɾ/ when it is at the end of syllables. Ex. ártu /ˈaɾtu/ instead of áltu /ˈaltu/ \"tall\", curpâ /kuɾˈpɐ/ instead of culpâ /kulˈpɐ/ \"to blame\", burcã /buɾˈkɐ̃/ instead of vulcõ /vulˈkõ/ \"volcano\".\n\nThe sound /ɾ/ disappears when it is at the end of words. Ex.: lugá' /luˈɡa/ instead of lugár /luˈɡaɾ/ \"place\", midjô' /miˈdʒo/ instead of midjôr /miˈdʒoɾ/ \"better\", mudjê' /muˈdʒe/ instead of mudjêr /muˈdʒeɾ/ \"woman\".\n\nThe diphthongs (oral or nasal) are in general pronounced as vowels. Ex.: mã' /mɒ̃/ instead of mãi /mɐ̃j/ \"mother\", nã' /nɐ̃/ instead of nãu /nɐ̃w/ \"no\", pá' /pɒ/ instead of pái /paj/ \"father\", rê' /re/ instead of rêi /rej/ \"king\", tchapê' /tʃɐˈpe/ instead of tchapêu /tʃɐˈpew/ \"hat\".\n\nThe pre-tonic sound /a/ is velarized near labial or velar consonants. Ex.: badjâ \"to dance\" pronounced [bɒˈdʒɐ], cabêlu \"hair\" pronounced [kɒˈbelu], catchô' \"dog\" pronounced [kɒˈtʃo].\n\nMaio Creole is spoken mainly on Maio Island. It numbers the entire island population which includes a small part which also speaks Portuguese.\n\nIt is one of the least spoken Cape Verdean Creole and is after Brava and ahead of Boa Vista.\n\nBesides the main characteristics of Sotavento Creoles, Maio Creole has the following:\n\nThe progressive aspect of the present is formed by putting stâ before the verbs: stâ + V.\n\nThe unstressed final vowels /i/ and /u/ frequently disappear. Ex.: cumádr' /kuˈmadɾ/ instead of cumádri /kuˈmadɾi/ \"midwife\", vilúd' /viˈlud/ instead of vilúdu /viˈludu/ \"velvet\", bunít' /buˈnit/ instead of bunítu /buˈnitu/ \"beautiful\", cantád' /kɐ̃ˈtad/ instead of cantádu /kɐ̃ˈtadu/ \"sung\".\n\nThe sound /dʒ/ (that originates from old Portuguese, written j in the beginning of words) is partially represented by /ʒ/. Ex. jantâ /ʒɐ̃ˈtɐ/ instead of djantâ /dʒɐ̃ˈtɐ/ \"to dine\", jôg' /ʒoɡ/ instead of djôgu /ˈdʒoɡu/ \"game\", but in words like djâ /dʒɐ/ \"already\", Djõ /dʒõ/ \"John\" the sound /dʒ/ remains.\n\nSantiago Creole is spoken mainly on the Santiago Island of Cape Verde, including the capital of the country, Praia.\n\nBesides the main characteristics of Sotavento Creoles, Santiago Creole has the following:\n\nThe progressive aspect of the present is formed by putting sâ tâ before the verbs: sâ tâ + V.\n\nIn the verbs, the stress goes back to the before the last syllable in the forms for the present. Ex.: cánta /ˈkãtɐ/ instead of cantâ /kɐ̃ˈtɐ/ \"to sing\", mêxe /ˈmeʃe/ or mêxi /ˈmeʃi/ instead of mexê /meˈʃe/ \"to move\", pârti /ˈpɐɾti/ instead of partí /pɐɾˈti/ \"to leave\", cômpo /ˈkõpo/ or cômpu /ˈkõpu/ instead of compô /kõˈpo/ \"to fix\", búmbu /ˈbũbu/ instead of bumbú /bũˈbu/ \"to put on the back\".\n\nSome speakers pronounce the voiced sibilants as voiceless. Ex. cássa /ˈkasɐ/ instead of cása /ˈkazɐ/ \"house\", ôxi /ˈoʃi/ instead of ôji /ˈoʒi/ \"today\".\n\nSome speakers pronounce the sound /ʀ/ as /ɾ/. Ex.: cáru /ˈkaɾu/ instead of cárru /ˈkaʀu/ \"car\", féru /ˈfɛɾu/ instead of férru /ˈfɛʀu/ \"iron\", curâl /kuˈɾɐl/ instead of currál /kuˈʀal/ \"corral\".\n\nThe sound /ɾ/ is slightly aspirated [ɾʰ].\n\nThe sounds /n/, /t/ and /d/ are pronounced as alveolars [n͇], [t͇], [d͇] and not as dentals [n̪], [t̪], [d̪]\n\nThe nasal diphthongs are de-nasalized. Ex.: mâi /mɐj/ instead of mãi /mɐ̃j/ \"mother\", nâu /nɐw/ instead of nãu /nɐ̃w/ \"no\".\n\nThe stressed sound /a/ is pronounced /ɐ/ when it is before the sound /l/ at the end of words. Ex.: curâl /kuˈɾɐl/ instead of currál /kuˈʀal/ \"corral\", mâl /mɐl/ instead of mál /mal/ \"bad\", Tarrafâl /tɐɾɐˈfɐl/ instead of Tarrafál /tɐʀɐˈfal/ \"Tarrafal\" (place name).\n\nThe Barlavento Creoles are spoken in the Barlavento Islands. Some characteristics:\n\nThe imperfective aspect of the past is formed joining the particle for the past ~va to the verbal actualizer tâ: táva + V.\n\nNote: In São Nicolau, along with táva + V also subsists the older form tá V+ba.\n\nThe personal pronoun for the second person of the plural is b'sôt'.\n\nThe unstressed vowels /i/ and /u/ frequently disappear. Ex.: c'mádr' /ˈkmadɾ/ for cumádri /kuˈmadɾi/ \"midwife\", v'lúd' /ˈvlud/ for vilúdu /viˈludu/ \"velvet\", c'dí /ˈkdi/ for cudí /kuˈdi/ \"to answer\", tch'gâ /ˈtʃɡɐ/ for tchigâ /tʃiˈɡɐ/ \"to arrive\".\n\nRaising of the stressed /a/ sound (oral or nasal) to /ɔ/ in words that used to end with the sound /u/.
