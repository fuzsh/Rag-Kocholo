It is one of the few times no one really worries about which variation, and just feel the feels, but it is difficult to translate the full emotions. I tried to capture the sentiments in English that Paulo Ver√≠ssimo depicts in his poem, N Skesi di Fla-u. Kriolu Basics begins September 2024. Learn how to read, write, speak and even feel in Kriolu. üòâ\n\n#freeyourmindfriday If language is part of identity, why was Kriolu literally beaten out of Capeverdeans?
