        "text": "Baltasar Lopes (born April 23, 1907, Calejão, São Nicolau, Cape Verde Islands—died May 28, 1989, São Vicente, Cape Verde) was an African poet, novelist, and short-story writer, who was instrumental in the shaping of modern Cape Verdean literature.\n\nLopes was educated at the University of Lisbon, where he took a degree in law and in Romance philology. He then returned to Cape Verde and became a high-school teacher and later principal of the Liceu Gil Eanes in São Vicente (retired 1972). His one novel, Chiquinho (1947), written in Portuguese, re-creates the experiences of a Cape Verdean who grows up to understand that, in his land, life is a prolonged tragedy given meaning by the assertion of human courage, unselfishness, and dignity. Chiquinho, marking the beginning of realism in the Cape Verdean novel, is now a classic.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nA Study of Poetry"
