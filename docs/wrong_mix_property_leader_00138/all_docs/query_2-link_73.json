        "text": "NEW BEDFORD – Despite growing up in a large Cabo Verdean community in Massachusetts, Dr. Aminah Fernandes Pilgrim said it wasn’t until she enrolled at Duke University that she finally heard talk about Cabo Verdean women in class.\n\n“Imagine my surprise, going all the way to North Carolina to finally hear in an academic setting an acknowledgement of the importance of my heritage,” said Dr. Pilgrim, a professor of Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies and Critical Ethnic and Community Studies at UMass Boston and one of three guest speakers at LusoCentro’s celebration of International Women’s History Month and Cabo Verdean Women’s Day held March 23 at the New Bedford campus of Bristol Community College.\n\nDr. Pilgrim said women have been silent pillars of Cabo Verdean society for a long time, and they’ve mostly stood in the shadows. That’s something she is hoping a new book she co-wrote with other Cabo Verdean women will help reverse.\n\nEdited by Dr. Pilgrim and Dr. Terza A. Silva Lima-Neves, an associate professor of political science at Johnson C. Smith University, “Cabo Verdean Women Writing Remembrance, Resistance, and Revolution: Kriolas Poderozas” documents the work and stories told by Cabo Verdean women to refocus the narratives about Cabo Verde, on Cabo Verdean women and their experiences.\n\n“Kriolas Poderozas” roughly translated means “Empowered Cabo Verdean Women.”\n\nThrough exploring the literary and musical contributions of Cabo Verdean women, the Cabo Verdean state and its transnational relations, food and cooking traditions, migration and diaspora, and the oral histories of Cabo Verde, several contributors analyze in this book themes of community, race, sexuality, migration, gender, and tradition.\n\n“This book has been about rebranding the Cabo Verdean women and giving voice to our experiences in our own words and our own testimonies,” Dr. Pilgrim said. “It’s about creating a legacy for them and putting that legacy on paper.”\n\nThe chapter she wrote is a letter to her grandmother.\n\n“So much work on this book is based upon our personal and political struggles,” she said.\n\nWhen a little girl in the audience caught her eye, she had a message for her: “This project is about you, so that when you grow up you know how special you are, how much you matter and how important you are.”\n\nAward-winning author, artist, and poet Iva Brito, the inaugural Director of Bristol Community College Women’s Center, wrote a chapter titled “Kriolas’ work through poetry.”\n\n“In this book, we are telling our stories through the history that has not been told,” said Brito, a native of Cabo Verde. “We are the offsprings of our ancestors’ perseverance, resistance, love and commitment for change. And we continue with the work of knitting and weaving ourselves together in this tapestry of this lineage of courage.”\n\nAnd while carrying out that work, she said one must continue to ask: “Who’s not at the table? Whose voice is not being heard?”\n\n“This book is an answer to that and shows the voices of the Cabo Verdean women that for so many reasons have not been told throughout history,” she said. “It takes a decolonized approach to the feminine ideology and languages inclusive of the Kriolas’ identities, challenges and triumphs, balancing scholarly language with activism, the beauty of storytelling and personal essays.”\n\nInvoking an African proverb, she cautioned: “When we lose an elder, we lose a library.”\n\n“If we don’t do the work and tell these stories, they’ll get lost,” she said. “Ask the stories of your mothers and grandmothers.”\n\nVocalist, songwriter and cultural educator Candida Rose Baptista — known to her fans as simply Candida Rose — wrote a chapter highlighting the contributions of Cabo Verdean musicians and singers, among them Vickie Tavares Vieira, Gardenia Benros, Belinda Lima, Celina Pereira, Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes from the group TLC.\n\n“We need to honor those who come before us,” said the second generation Cabo Verdean born in New Bedford, who likes to combine her Cabo Verdean roots with Jazz influences in her music, often performing what she likes to call Cabo Jazz.\n\n“There’s so much work that needs to be done in terms of researching the Cabo Verdean women and researching our history and let our voices be heard,” she said. “What I’ve found is that we are not necessarily the ones who are speaking for us. We need to continue speaking for us.”\n\nDr. Carlos Almeida, the director of the LusoCentro who served as master of ceremonies, said he was “very grateful and honored to be part of this important celebration in helping promote Cabo Verdean history, literature and culture.”\n\n“It is my utmost pleasure to be presenting to you three outstanding Kriolas Poderosas and the incredible work they have been doing for the empowerment of the Cabo Verdean community.”\n\nDuring a Q&A session, the three guest speakers received great praise from members of the audience.\n\n“You’re doing such a tribute to our culture, our heritage and our history. I applaud that,” said Jeanne Costa, a writer and historian.\n\nDr. João Rosa, academic director of the Pedro Pires Institute for Cape Verdean Studies at Bridgewater State University, emphasized the relevance of the work being done by these women.\n\n“This is one more pillar of the legacy that you leave,” he said. “We can look back and see these people were trailblazers.”\n\nVanussa Vera Cruz Lima, a native of São Vicente, Cabo Verde, who is pursuing a doctorate degree at UMass Dartmouth, said she felt really inspired by these women.\n\n“Sometimes I feel a little awkward and discouraged because I don’t see anybody like me in class&mldr; no Cabo Verdean women or even men,” she said. “Sometimes, I wonder why I am doing this. And today, being here, I feel it wasn’t in vain. I feel so inspired when I see you doing this work.”\n\nLusoCentro’s “Cabo Verdean Women Writing Remembrance, Resistance, and Revolution” event was presented in collaboration with Pedro Pires Institute for Cape Verdean Studies at Bridgewater State University, Cape Verdean Association in New Bedford, New Bedford Whaling Museum Cape Verdean Advisory Committee, Bristol Women’s Center, Bristol Holocaust and Genocide Center, Bristol Multicultural Center, Bristol Portuguese Club and Bristol Division of Arts and Humanities.\n\nThe book “Cabo Verdean Women Writing Remembrance, Resistance, and Revolution: Kriolas Poderozas” is available for purchase on Amazon. It is also available for check out at the New Bedford Public Library.\n\nLurdes C. da Silva may be reached at ldasilva@ojornal.com.
