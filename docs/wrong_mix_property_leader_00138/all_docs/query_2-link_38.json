        "text": "Charismatic cape verde\n\nLying 600 miles southwest of the Canary Islands and around 300 miles from the Senegal coast, this archipelago of ten volcanic islands has a climate, topography and mood completely unlike anywhere else in Africa.\n\nwords and all images (c) Gilly Pickup\n\nTravel Snapshot\n\nDirect flights from the UK mean the Atlantic islands of Cape Verde are easy to reach while unique landscapes, culture and carefree mood make this a holiday destination with a difference. Although linked to Africa historically and geographically, European influences are obvious in architecture and Portuguese language. Most visitors who come,stay on the main and most developed island of Sal, home to the largest concentration of tourist hotels.\n\n​Insider's Guide\n\nMillions of years old and fabled in antiquity as the ‘Islands of the Blessed’ , this is a land where the sun never takes a day off. Temperatures stay around 25C though the almost constant breeze takes the edge off the heat. Remember to bring a sun hat and slather on the sun cream, you will need it! A main attraction of this mosquito free environment is the laid back lifestyle, ‘no stress’ is the local mantra.\n\nWildlife Wonders\n\nYou may spot one of Cape Verde’s fifteen species of lizards, a giant gecko or some gorgeous black-winged stilts, they of the supermodel-length legs and long pointy beaks. The ngon-ngon bird and red-billed tropicbird are both on the endangered species list, though there are still plenty of helmeted guineafowl around. No large mammals or snakes live here, but green monkeys thrive on the island of Santiago. Manta rays and whale sharks can be spotted and Sal has the world’s third-biggest community of loggerhead turtles.\n\n​Don't Miss .....\n\nStrolling along the beach to the island’s main town, Santa Maria, awash with rainbow coloured cafes and bars which spring alive in the evenings with traditional guitar based Cape Verdean music. Street markets and a string of shops and stalls sell locally carved wooden items, colourful pots made from local clay, woven baskets and t-shirts bearing the motto ‘No Stress’.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nThe 307 room Robinson’s Club is an all inclusive beach resort a short drive from the main airport. The main restaurant is buffet style while there is also a specialty restaurant in the form of a Tapas Bar if guests want to indulge in something a little more special.\n\nThe club has a gym, sauna, fitness centre, spa, two swimming pools and a water sport station."
