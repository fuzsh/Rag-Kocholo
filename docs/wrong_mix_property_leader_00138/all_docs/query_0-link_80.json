It has also opened paths for politically productive and transformative forms of localized resistance(s). We write this book out of sheer outrage over the continuing evaporation of democracy and the conviction that the documenting and denouncing of this state of affairs must be sustained. Dominant forces mutate, and at every turn they must be exposed and named. The mutation of oppressive forces is a certainty because hegemony is an ongoing pedagogical project (Giroux, 2005) and contestation, in some form, is inevitable (Leitner et al., 2007; Harvey, 2012). No one in a power relationship is ever totally powerless; hence our title: Capitalism’s Educational Catastrophe and the Advancing Endgame Revolt!\n\nThe increased plutocratic authoritarianism, militarization, unprecedented forms of citizen surveillance, policing, and detention (Giroux, 2012) are signals that the overseers are in disarray. Trade unionist Nicholas Klein, in a 1918 speech delivered at the Third Biennial Convention of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, theorized the trajectory of the dialectical relationship between domination and resistance: “First they ignore you. Then they ridicule you. And then they attack you and want to burn you. And then they build monuments to you” (Klein; cited in Bunch, 2014, para. 1).”2 Counter-struggles are won when the attacks are vociferous enough to produce enough despair, and when discourses of the elite become sufficiently irrational to set the masses in motion. Although we are hopeful about the diverse forms of popular insurgencies on the ground, we also remain careful not to idealize social movements. Resistance is also capable of ← 1 | 2 → reifying oppressive social forces (Rose, 2002). Monuments are usually built after they have been co-opted.\n\nThis book examines neoliberal capitalism and processes of racialization as interdependent. The neoliberalization of education is having disproportionate negative implications for communities of color. More profoundly, neoliberal ideology is reworking processes of racialization and the way race is inscribed in discourse and bodies. It is the predominant veneer of current color-blindness, where color-blindness functions to deepen the hegemony of neoliberalism. Following Roberts and Mahtani (2010), we shift “from analyses of race and neoliberalism towards analyses that race neoliberalism” (p. 250).\n\nThe book underscores the urgency to focus more constantly on the wider structures of current capitalism, which is marked most profoundly by monopoly-finance capital (Foster & McChesney, 2012). Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis’s classic work Schooling in Capitalist America (1976), despite its determinism, continues to provide us with a powerful compass to navigate the future (Foster, 2011). “Great” schools are only possible for a fraction of the population under neoliberal capitalism’s reign over school policy. The continued work of building more culturally responsive and democratic schools should not be dismissed, but we need to design them for everyone and not be distracted by exceptional “choice” models, which really serve as token spaces to keep the masses compliant and current power structures intact. We are witnessing far too many critical colleagues running into the arms of capital to initiate programs that are supposedly more liberating. Although their embrace may be an uncomfortable one, we question the viability of struggling in such arenas.\n\nWe question school personnel who misplace their rage by blaming victims. It is not poor parenting but rather poverty, greed, and organizational cultures steeped in ruling-class ideology, patriarchy, and Whiteness that have caused all of the devastation in education. In propagating these discourses and the vicious racism that flows from them, teachers and administrators who would otherwise be forceful opponents of neoliberalism actually reproduce its power by driving families into market reforms and disrupting any effort to build solid alliances. Continued work on culturally relevant pedagogies and critical multicultural education should continue. Yet it is an incomplete path for the road ahead. Simultaneous resistance against capitalism more broadly is both crucial and unavoidable. The argument avoids an either/or and is, rather, centered on a both/and.\n\nThe predatory tactics of current capitalism have been more detrimental to communities of color given the disproportionate accumulation of wealth and its operation within the wider social circuits of color-blindness (Bonilla-Silva, 2010; Brown, 2013). The color-blindness not only manifests in the policy environment allowing for voracious acts by business and the financial products they push. It also operates in the mainstream media and the social perception that people of color ← 2 | 3 → are somehow more financially illiterate than the White middle and upper-middle classes. Such racist displays contradict social science research (Cohen-Cole, 2011).\n\nThese wider economic tactics are crucial to the process of “accumulation by dispossession” (Harvey, 2003), which in turn has profound effects on the educational trajectory of poor and working-class youths of color. Current market fundamentalist practices are not all that at work, though. Philanthropic ventures with strings attached are more difficult to reject in disinvested communities—proportionally more pronounced in areas inhabited by poor people of color. The very fact that mainstream schools have been color-blind and unresponsive to communities of color, the poor, immigrants, and people who are indigenous further feeds the momentum of neoliberal rationality in education. The lack of cultural responsiveness in mainstream schools creates the condition for families and community-based activists to run into the arms of neoliberal alternatives such as charter schools. It is no coincidence that neoliberal policies such as No Child Left Behind (NCLB) and Race to the Top (RTTT) seized on the lack of cultural responsiveness to further engineer a politics and practice of standardization to render the market reforms more appealing."
