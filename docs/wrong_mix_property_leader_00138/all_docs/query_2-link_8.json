        "text": "Manuel Lopes (born Dec. 23, 1907, São Vicente Island, Cape Verde Islands—died Jan. 25, 2005, Lisbon, Port.) was an African poet and novelist, who portrayed the struggle of his people to live in a land besieged by drought, famine, and unemployment.\n\nLopes studied at the University of Coimbra in Portugal, then returned to Cape Verde. In 1944 he took up work for Western Telegraph, and in 1951 he was transferred to the Azores. Subsequently he worked in Portugal, where he continued to live even after retirement.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPoetry: First Lines\n\nLopes was one of the founders of the journal Claridade, which in 1936 gave birth to modern Cape Verdean literature. Lopes’s story “O galo que cantou na baía” (1936; “The Cock That Crowed in the Bay”) is the first prose narrative in Cape Verde rooted in a social reality that includes traditional folk elements. Two prizewinning novels, Chuva braba (1956; “Torrential Rains”) and Os flagelados do vento leste (1960; “Victims of the East Wind”), reflect both the anguish and the hope of his people."
