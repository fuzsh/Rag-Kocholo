        "text": "This blog starts with two posts on the links between Cape Verdean poetry pre- and post- independence and the environmental problems that the country faces due to its geographic location.\n\nToday’s post focuses on the work of the Claridade group of poets in the 1930s, who established modern Cape Verdean poetry. The second post will cover the influence of this group in the work of contemporary writers.\n\nCape Verde is a small island country off the African coast, around 650 km from Senegal. It is independent since 1975, when it ceased to be a Portuguese colony. The archipelago was uninhabited when the Portuguese arrived in 1456. As a result, the Cape Verdean society is more ethnically diverse than other African nations, as it was settled by people from Europe and Africa.\n\nI have written several posts about the country in my other blog, focusing on aspects of local environment, urbanism and mobility in the capital city (Praia).\n\nThe climate of the archipelago suffers the influence of the Sahara desert. The islands are then subject to recurrent droughts, or more precisely, to the cycle of droughts and flooding.\n\nTraditionally, the subjects and styles of Cape Verdean literature were aligned with those of Portuguese writers, and presented what was essentially an alien, Westernised, and unoriginal vision of the world. In any case, the output of native writers, living in Cape Verde, was very limited.\n\nThe panorama of Cape Verdean literature was forever changed after the 1930s, with the work of a group of poets known as Claridade [Clarity], who published in a journal with the same name in the city of Mindelo in São Vicente Island.\n\nAlthough only nine numbers of this journal were published, from 1936 to 1966, they had a long-lasting influence on Cape Verdean culture. The originals of this journal are now rarities but a good part of their content has been included in several collections published over the years. The nine numbers were republished in 1986 to celebrate the 50 years of the first number.\n\nJorge Barbosa (1902-1971) is one of the names credited with the establishment of the group and is considered as one of the most important writers in the history of the country. Other often-cited names are Manuel Lopes (1907-2005), the first director of the Claridade journal, and Baltasar Lopes (also know by his pen name Osvaldo Alcântara) (1907-1989).\n\nThe work of this group had an important role in shaping Cape Verdean identity, because it signalled the cultural independence of the country. It presented a distinctive voice, free from literary models copied from the western tradition. More importantly, the themes explored were specific to the Cape Verdean reality and to the feelings of its population. The work is usually of a realist nature, inspired in the natural and social conditions of the islands, and includes many elements of local life and culture such as racial diversity, oral traditions, and local folklore. These developments occurred simultaneously with the emergence of a distinctive style of Cape Verdean music, the morna, with features the same mixture of sadness and rhythm.\n\nThe environment was one of the main themes of the Claridade movement. In fact, Jorge Barbosa entitled one of his poem collections as Ambiente (Environment). The island environment is presented by the Claridosos as a series of constraints to human life: geographic isolation, the omnipresence of the sun and the sea, and the recurrent droughts. These constraints define the fate of the Cape Verdean man and his vulnerability to famine and poverty.\n\nexcerpt from Jorge Barbosa – A Terra [The Land]. First published in 1935, included in Barbosa (1989). My translation (same for other poems in this post).\n\nAs a colonized country, Cape Verde was dependent on solutions provided by the colonizer for mitigating the impact of droughts. Food distributions were organised, but were often marred by violence and corruption\n\nWaiting for food distribution (1903), in Carreira (1984).\n\nAlthough the way in which the natural and social environment is described seems fatalistic, the poems also emphasize the resilience of local people. In an essay on the environmental aspects of Jorge Barbosa’s poetry, published in Revista Cultura n.2 (1998) (also in Bettencourt and Silva 2010), Manuel Veiga writes that “drought wears and kills, but it also fertilizes resistance. The smallness of the islands suffocates and crushes, but it also gives rise to dreams, departures and returns”.\n\nThe poems also implicitly support the idea of independence of the islanders, both economic (through emigration) and political (through freedom from colonial rule). The islands were compared to a prison, surrounded by the sea and subject to the rule of a foreign country. But at the same time, the sea also showed that there is a way out and provided hope to the islander.\n\nJorge Barbosa – Prisão [Prison]. First published in 1941, also in Barbosa (1989)\n\nexcerpt from Jorge Barbosa – O mar [The sea]. First published in 1935,also in Barbosa (1989)\n\nJorge could not be more explicit at that time when every word was closely scrutinised by the fascist regime that ruled Portugal. Poems such as the one below, where the plight of the islanders is more closely related to colonial rule, were published much later:\n\nJorge Barbosa-Meio milénio [Half a millenium]. Written in 1960, published in Barbosa (1993).\n\nThe links between the constraints posed by environment and subjugation to colonial rule are more obvious when we hear the authors speaking about their work. The book below is an excellent resource as it collects interviews (in Portuguese) with the major writers of the Claridade and post-Claridade periods.\n\nIn his interview, Baltasar Lopes admits that the work of the Claridade group was pessimistic, as it defined national identify based on poverty, solitude, and despair; and offered only one explicit solution for the social and environmental problems of the islanders: emigration [Laban 1992, vol. 1, p.28-29].\n\nA similar view is given by Manuel Lopes in his interview (p.86-87). However, he also balances the influence of man and environment in the fate of the Cape Verdeans, mentioning the inadequacy of the Portuguese government in addressing famines in the islands (p.89).\n\nThe social and political inequality in the colony is illustrated in one of his poems, “O menino do cais” [The boy on the pier], included in the same interview (p.91):\n\nManuel comments that there is a “boy on the pier” whenever a minority imposes its power and ideology to the national majority, and where weapons are pointed to the “convicts” who try to break the bonds and be free.\n\nThe relationships between environmental conditions, colonial rule and poverty in the islands are also explored in the prose works of the Claridade group, most notably in Osvaldo Alcântara’s Chiquinho (1947) and Manuel Lopes’ Chuva Braba [Strong Rain] (1956) and Os Flagelados do Vento Leste [The Victims of the East Wind] (1959).\n\nWas the work of the Claridosos totally original? Not really. In fact, the group borrowed heavily from subjects and styles developed by writers from the Brazilian North-East. Like Cape Verde, this region is also vulnerable to drought conditions. In the 1930s, authors such as Graciliano Ramos, Jorge Amado, and José Lins do Rego started to write about the social and political dimensions of this geographic determinism. This work was a source of inspiration for Portuguese-speaking writers in Cape Verde.\n\nexcerpt from Jorge Barbosa – Você Brasil [You, Brazil], first published in 1956, included in Barbosa (1989).\n\nSo although the work of the Claridade group was innovative in the literary context of Cape Verde, it is sometimes criticised as still being derivative, only now not of European literary traditions but of the new Brazilian literature.\n\nNevertheless, the influence of this work in shaping Cape Verdean national identity cannot be denied. This is because the poets did not write only about their own sorrows but also about the problems of the whole nation.\n\nIn addition, the use of literature for relating environmental and social aspects represents a significant contribution to environmental thought, decades before these relationships were analysed in more formal ways by political philosophers in the social ecology movement.\n\nThe next post will focus on the influence of the Claridade group in the themes of younger writers and give some examples of authors who treated the same social and environmental issues as the Claridade and the problems arising in the later part of the 20th century, such as chaotic urban growth.\n\nReferences\n\nBarbosa, J.
