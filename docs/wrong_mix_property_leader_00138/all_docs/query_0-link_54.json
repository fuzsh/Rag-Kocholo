Sharing his love of offset and letterpress printing is a blessing. He believes in the power of printing to change just about anything. With three decades of a career in commercial printing to draw upon for your printing solutions, he founded the Bidon Community Print and Design Studio. \"What makes us unique is that you have the option to be part of the print process from start to finish if you choose to. We also offer 1 on 1 classes where you can learn how to print your project on the offset and letterpress.\" In his spare time when he's not working on someone else's project he makes his own art using traditional and non-traditional print mediums like the letterpress, etching presses and offset. He also mentore some of the kids from the youth program and some that aren’t from the youth program when they come to the print shop. If you have a print project you would like to work on, you can contact him at ​jacque@as220.org​."
