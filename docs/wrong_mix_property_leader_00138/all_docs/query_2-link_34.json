Tiagu is determined to have the house be labelless by the end of summer until he attends school in his new city! He is at first nervous and worried but his Vovo tells him that he is ready!\n\nReluctantly, Tiagu enters his classroom to see what the day would bring. To his surprise his day went better than he had expected, thanks to Vovo’s help.\n\nRelease Date: February 20, 2022"
