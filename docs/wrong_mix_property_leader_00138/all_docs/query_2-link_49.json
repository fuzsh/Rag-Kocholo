Reading inspires me. When I write I feel like I'm in the shoes of the characters, which helps me express my emotions”, he commented, challenging the children to let their imagination run wild.\n\nAs her mother explained, Lauryn is in Cape Verde at the invitation of the Ministry of Culture and Creative Industries to launch her book, on the 12th at the Palácio da Cultura Ildo Lobo, having expressed interest in meeting the President of the Republic, whose wish was cherished by José Maria Neves.\n\n“Being here in Cape Verde means coming to our roots, and for a very special reason, which is to share the book she wrote. I think we are here on a mission, because Lauryn is an activist and she wants to donate her book to children who cannot buy it in bookstores”, says proudly of her daughter who, as she highlighted, pays homage to all single mothers with her story.\n\nAccording to a note from the Presidency of the Republic, the work, entitled “Lauryn, that's Me: The Journey of a Powerful African Girl” tells the story of Lauryn, a 9-year-old girl from London, raised by a single mother, who is proud of her her African Portuguese roots and shares her journey of courage, hope, black representation and self-love as well as her dream of living in a world where everyone is treated equally.\n\nThis first book, according to the same source, is available in “large bookstores” in London and on renowned digital platforms in four languages, English, Portuguese, Spanish and French.\n\nThe little writer, who is currently finishing her second book, dedicated to culinary recipes, using Artificial Intelligence, also wants to see her books translated into Creole."
