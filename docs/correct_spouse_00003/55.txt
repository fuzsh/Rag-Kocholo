Jennifer Lopez, a global icon known for her iconic status in music, film, and business, has had a storied romantic history that has captured the fascination of the public. As of 2023, her recent marriage to Ben Affleck marks a significant chapter in her love life. But in the past, the superstar has been married and engaged quite some times which excludes the men she dated in the past.

Jennifer Lopez has been married four times

Jennifer Lopez has officially tied the knot four times, each union contributing to the intricate tapestry of her life. Lopez in the past, has been married to Ojani Noa (1997–1998), Cris Judd (2001–2003), and Marc Anthony (2004–2014), while she is currently navigating her marital journey with Ben Affleck. From Cris Judd to her current hubby Ben Affleck, her marital journey is as diverse as her professional portfolio.

Ojani Noa, a waiter-turned-performer, became Lopez's first husband in 1997. Their marriage, lasting even less than a year, marked her initial foray into the realm of matrimony. Lopez eventually took solace in the arms of Cris Judd, one of her former backup dancers. Their marriage, lasting from 2001 to 2002, faced the challenges of rebounding from a high-profile relationship. “Coming out of a torrid relationship, I meet this sweet person who's so refreshing. But marriage is not just about love. I thought I had learned that in my first marriage . . . . I loved Cris, still love him, he's one of the best people. This wasn't an easy thing to walk away from, but we didn't have what it takes to make a marriage work . . . . Cris knows the last thing I ever wanted in this f—— world was to hurt him,” Lopez stated, as per Pop Sugar.

Her relationship with Marc Anthony, lasting from 2004 to 2011, brought stability and family life into focus. Despite the challenges, they co-parented their twins, Max and Emme, showcasing a commitment to family life even after separation. Lopez is now married to Ben Affleck, whom she even dated back in the early 2000s. The duo back then even got engaged but couldn’t convert their relationship into marital bliss.
