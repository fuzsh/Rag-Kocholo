Jennifer Lopez and her ex-husband Marc Anthony were seen getting coffee together in Miami on Thursday, a source told People.

“A lot of hotel guests recognized her and she was super nice and upbeat with anyone who approached,” the source said. “They ordered coffee.”

Anthony and Lopez got married in 2004, split in 2011, and finalized their divorce in 2014. They continue to co-parent their twins, Max and Emme, 13, and another source told People that Anthony helped her after her split from Alex Rodriguez.

“Jennifer is doing well. She is still filming in the Dominican Republic. The kids have visited her and they make her the happiest,” the source said at the time. “Jennifer and Marc Anthony have a great relationship. Having Marc around while she has had to work abroad has been very comforting for Jennifer.”

While Lopez and Anthony continue to co-parent Max and Emme, Lopez has been seen spending a lot of time with her ex-fiancé, Ben Affleck. A source told Us Weekly this week that the two “are full-on dating and very happy together.”

“Ben and Jen feel so close to each other very quickly,” the source said. “The old flame is absolutely rekindled. They picked up where they left off in terms of affection for each other.”

E! and Page Six have both reported that things are going well for the rekindled couple as they make a long-distance relationship work. Lopez has been in Miami while Affleck has been in Los Angeles.

Affleck visited Lopez last weekend in Miami and “is happy to be a part of her life in Miami, where they spent a lot of time at home being low-key and relaxing together. They have had a great few days that feels effortless and easy.”
