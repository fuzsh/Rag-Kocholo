        "text": "\"I didn't know that you and Marc were good friends,\" J. Lo says in a clip\n\nAnthony Ramos is putting his friendship with Marc Anthony first, even if it means dropping out of a Jennifer Lopez project.\n\nThe Transformers: Rise of the Beasts actor, 32, was set to star in The Greatest Love Story Never Told, a behind-the-scenes documentary that chronicles the making of Lopez's This Is Me… Now: A Love Story.\n\nHowever, according to Ramos, there was a conflict of interest.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nA scene from the film, which is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video, shows the “Jenny From the Block” hitmaker, 54, having a phone conversation with Ramos.\n\nAlthough he does not appear in the clip, it is implied that J. Lo is on the line with him.\n\n\"I didn't know that you and Marc were good friends, I didn't know that. But that's nice,\" she told Ramos after he stated he was uncomfortable working with her for that particular project due to his closeness to Anthony (born Marco Anthonio Muniz), 55.\n\nRelated: Anthony Ramos on His 'Love' for Lin-Manuel Miranda: 'I'm Really Grateful' (Exclusive)\n\nThe singers got married in 2004, separated in 2011, and finalized their divorce in 2014. Together, they share 16-year-old twins, Maximilian \"Max\" David Muniz and Emme Maribel Muniz.\n\n\"He's the father of my kids, obviously. I'm never going to do anything that's going to really pinpoint him out, but it is very meta. It's kind of about the 20-year journey between that last album and this album, and a lot of things happened. There were a lot of relationships that I was in. The thing you're playing is representative of many relationships, not one specific relationship,” Lopez explained to Ramos.\n\nThe scene that the Hamilton actor was set to star in is called “Rebound.”\n\nIt shows the Selena alum in a toxic relationship, and features her dancing with said partner in a glass house as it shattered — all the while ropes would continue pulling the dysfunctional couple back together again.\n\n“Rebound” symbolizes the inability to break free from an unhealthy love.\n\nWhen Ramos’ starred as the lead in In the Heights in 2021, Anthony was present to support the budding talent at the Tribeca Festival at United Palace Theater in New York City.\n\nLopez ultimately got dancer Gilbert Saldivar to fill the “Rebound” role.\n\nThe Maid in Manhattan actress' musical is a film adaptation of her ninth studio album, This Is Me... Now, a follow-up to her 2002 LP This Is Me... Then.\n\nThe Amazon Prime Video project follows J. Lo as she goes on a journey of self-love that leads her to find her soulmate — her husband Ben Affleck.\n\nRelated: Emotional Jennifer Lopez Chokes Up as She Thanks Ben Affleck During This Is Me...Now Film Screening in L.A.\n\nShe and the Justice League actor, 51, began dating in 2002 and got engaged that same year before they postponed their wedding in 2003 and split in January 2004.\n\nLopez and Affleck began dating again in April 2021 and got married in July 2022.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
