        "text": "Jennifer Lopez says working with her ex-husband Marc Anthony on her upcoming Spanish album healed their relationship.\n\n“[Collaborating on ‘Por Primera Vez’] actually kind of repaired certain parts of our relationship that had been fractured from our marriage and our divorce and it kind of made us friends again,” Lopez told Entertainment Tonight.\n\nLopez, 48 and Anthony, 49, tied the knot in 2004 and welcomed twins Emme and Max in 2008. They split in 2011 after seven years of marriage. Their divorce wouldn’t be finalized until 2014.\n\n“Because when we first started working together, it’s how we met … we met working,” Lopez added. “And so we remembered that like, oh right, we connect on this level of music.”\n\n“We have that. And that’s what the album came out of,” she explained.\n\nAlthough they’ve since moved on to other people, Lopez still has a lot of respect for his family — especially Anthony’s late mother Guillermina Quiñones.\n\nTo honor her, Lopez re-recorded Anthony’s “Vivir Mi Vida” with her own twist.\n\n“Not in the kind of up-tempo, rhythmic, salsa way that Marc did it, but in a way where you really hear the words to that song, which is, you know, you have one life and you have to live it,” she said."
