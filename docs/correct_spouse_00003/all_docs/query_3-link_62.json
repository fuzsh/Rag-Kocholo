The source emphasizes that all parents are doing their best to adapt to the new circumstances.\n\n\"They're trying to present themselves in a positive way for their kids,\" the source adds.\n\nOn Saturday, the This Is Me...Now star shared an Instagram video from her girls outing with Affleck and Jennifer Garner's daughter, Violet, and her friend, Cassidey Fralin.\n\n\"Summertime,\" Lopez, 54, captioned the clip.\n\nIn the Instagram Story, Lopez smiles as she records the video with her hair blowing in the wind as the car is in motion and Violet, 18, and Fralin gaze out of the window behind her. Adding some fun sounds to the moment, Lopez used The Kid LAROI's hit, \"Girls,\" to the post.\n\nThe \"Dear Ben\" singer also puts her wedding ring on display in the video.\n\nNot pictured during the moment was Affleck or his and Garner's other children, Seraphina, 15, and Samuel, 12. Lopez's twins, Max and Emme, 16, whom she shares with Marc Anthony, also weren't pictured.\n\nLopez's latest post comes amid rumors of tension in her and the Oscar-winning actor's relationship. Most recently, the couple spent the Fourth of July holiday apart. Lopez shared photos on Instagram showcasing her holiday activities. She was seen walking through fields of gorgeous flowers in the Hamptons and posing on a fence, all while wearing her wedding ring. The Instagram photos were captioned, \"Happy Fourth üåπüá∫üá∏.\"\n\nFor his part, Affleck was spotted having dinner with two of his children in Los Angeles on Wednesday, July 3. Photos published by The Daily Mail showed Affleck also wearing his wedding ring during the outing. Prior to the holiday, Lopez was spotted having some sun in the sun during a European vacation with friends.\n\nOn Thursday, it was revealed that the couplepublicly listed their Beverly Hills home for $68 million, one month after ET learned they were trying to \"quietly sell\" the home.\n\nLast month, a source told ET that Lopez and Affleck, 51, are \"trying to be as amicable as possible.\"\n\n\"They still want the best for everyone involved,\" the source said at the time, \"including their kids, the rest of their families, and shared friends.\"\n\nLopez and Affleck have left fans with questions about the status of their romance as they are sometimes seen with (and without) their respective wedding bands. The pair rekindled their love in 2022, and tied the knot during two wedding ceremonies in 2023.\n\nThe same source noted that the couple could care less if people are looking at their fingers.\n\n\"Ben and Jen are aware that their fans are paying attention to see if they're wearing their rings or not,\" the source said.\n\nFor more on Jen and Ben's romance, click below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nBen Affleck and Jennifer Lopez Reunite at His Office Amid Relationship Struggles\n\nJennifer Lopez Has 'Summertime' Car Ride With Ben Affleck's Daughter\n\nJennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck Publicly List Home Amid Divorce Rumors\n\nJennifer Lopez Marks Anniversary of Song About an Undeserving Man\n\nJennifer Lopez Poses Solo in July 4th Photos In The Hamptons"
