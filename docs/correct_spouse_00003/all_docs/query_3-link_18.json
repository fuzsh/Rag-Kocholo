        "text": "I'm not a follower of the celebrities forum, but this topic interests me. I have a great amount of respect for both of them, in different areas.\n\nI have seen Marc Anthony go from a freestyle club singer to a Latin superstar (and he has always looked way too thin to be healthy, so I'm pretty sure that's just how he's built). If any of you think Jennifer carried him, think again. He was huge before she came along and will continue to be long after she is gone. He has multiple Grammys as well as many other awards and is the best selling Salsa artist of all time. He has real, raw talent that will carry him a long way with his fans. He needs no reinventing, no career boosting and, as you can see, he doesn't even need to be Hollywood sexy.\n\nJennifer busted her pretty booty to get where she is. I admire that. She is beautiful, a great dancer and a hard worker but she is a mediocre singer and actress. I don't think she has staying power, she's more of a girl of the moment and she is on an upswing. I could be wrong, but that's the way I see it. The fact that she is branching out to other areas is a smart move, financially.\n\nAs to the divorce, who really knows what happened? They both have exhibited questionable character in their marriages and relationships. Maybe it's karma. Maybe they really loved each other and it ran its course. Unless one of them talks, and Marc probably won't, no one will really know. There are lots of rumors going around. But the idea that he is a cheater/beater/drug addict because of the way he LOOKS is just ridiculous.\n\nWow... some outright horrible things being said about Mark Anthony.\n\nI have worked in venues where Mark A was present and have even seen his Father, who he is practically a clone of. His body type is genetics - very lean and sinewy.\n\nThe \"hiv\" thing was totally ignorant and uncalled for.\n\nAlso, he is not in any way being supported by JLO because he is a real Star and worth alot of money. He does not need hers. He has real talent unlike her.\n\nJenny is from the block. She is a diva who tried not to look like one.\n\nHer and Mark know each other from the block and he really loved her. He's been in love with her since they were young. He should have never hooked up with her."
