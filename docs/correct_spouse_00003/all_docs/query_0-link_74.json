        "text": "Los Angeles Superior Court Judge John Sandoz finalized the couple’s breakup on Monday, awarding the former couple joint legal custody of their 6-year-old twin children, court records show.\n\nPHOTOS Jennifer Lopez’s Style: 10 Top Looks From the Past Year\n\nThe pair agreed that Lopez will have their son and daughter most of time, with Anthony caring for them for seven days a month. The singers also agreed that no child or spousal support was necessary.\n\nThe singers also agreed to do whatever they can to shield their children from paparazzi and reporters. The judgment states both Lopez and Anthony recognize “that exposing the children to public spectacle and failing to shield the children from aggressive news organizations, photographers, etc. is not the children’s best interest.”\n\nPHOTOS ‘American Idol’ Season 13\n\nThe judgment was first reported Wednesday by TMZ.\n\nAnthony filed for divorce in April 2012, but the pair separated in July 2011.\n\nAnthony’s latest Spanish album 3.0 has been a hit, and he announced earlier this year that he’s working on an English-language pop album. Lopez released her latest album A.K.A. this week.\n\nPHOTOS Billboard Latin Music Awards\n\nA judge hearing a dispute between Anthony and his ex-wife Dayanara Torres issued a proposed ruling on June 11 that, if finalized, would require the Latin crooner to increase his child support to their two sons, ages 10 and 13, to nearly $27,000 a month. Anthony is also required to pay $12,000 a year for Torres’ and their sons’ vacation expenses, plus medical expenses and tuition costs.\n\nThe proposed order will become official in early July unless attorneys raise new valid legal issues."
