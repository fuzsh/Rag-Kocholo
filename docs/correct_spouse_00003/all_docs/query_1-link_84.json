        "text": "There are few pairs that have embodied the frenzied obsession with celebrity duos quite like Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez, one of the super couples of the early-aughts tabloid era, whose rekindled romance after 20-plus years has delighted hopeless romantics and pop-culture fanatics alike. Over the course of two decades, Affleck and Lopez’s relationship has touched on nearly every storyline of a Hollywood romance, from their flashy early courtship and messy breakup to their fairy-tale reconciliation and eventual marriage. The public fascination with their relationship has inspired everything from a South Park episode to the creation of a joint moniker (hello, Bennifer!), making the duo a cultural touchstone in the process.\n\nWhich might explain why Lopez (and a seemingly begrudging but loving Affleck) decided to tell the story of their relationship in a recent documentary, The Greatest Love Story Never Told. The film, streaming on Amazon Prime and drawing its name from a description of their romance in one of the real-life love letters Affleck wrote Lopez, is ostensibly about the making of her bombastic musical movie This Is Me…Now and its accompanying album, released in February. But really, it sets out to make the case that Bennifer might be one of the greatest love stories of our time.\n\nRead more: Why Jennifer Lopez Remains the Patron Saint of Romantic Comedies\n\nLike This Is Me…Now, The Greatest Love Story Never Told can be bewildering in its ambition and chaotic in its storytelling, but there was one scene that shocked me into seriously examining the epic romance between Affleck and Lopez. Early on in the documentary, Lopez shares with her team the Christmas gift that Affleck gave to her in 2021, an extensive scrapbook chronicling every picture, email and letter the two have shared since they first met in 2001. The moment itself, though casual, is breathtaking when you realize that Affleck, a two-time Oscar winner so known for his seemingly downtrodden stoicism that he inspired a meme, retrieved every piece of correspondence with a woman he fell in love with over 20 years ago, then presented it all to her when they reunited two decades later. Perhaps even more astounding is that Lopez uses this as the jumping-off point for her new album and film, basically offering the most private and vulnerable part of a highly public relationship for her art.\n\nThe couple met in 2001 on the set of the objectively bad film Gigli, where their workplace romance grew into one of the most emblematic celebrity couplings of the era—Lopez, a pop star and rom-com golden girl from the Bronx and Affleck, the Oscar-winning bad boy from Boston. Their relationship blossomed under the watchful eye of the tabloids, and in spite of it, solidifying them as true A-listers whose personal lives were as compelling as their work on-screen. While cynics may have pointed to the high-profile pairing as a ploy to boost their celebrity, Lopez and Affleck’s displays of affection came off as pure romance, authentic if outsized. How else to explain Affleck taking out full-page ads in trade rags to congratulate Lopez after she won an award, or Lopez penning a love song on her 2002 album This Is Me…Then, titled, “Dear Ben,” and dedicating the entire album to him? Or what about Affleck proposing to Lopez, after just over a year of dating, with a 6.1 carat pink diamond from Harry Winston? Their whirlwind romance was fantastical, heady, even giddy, the equivalent of watching a rom-com in real time.\n\nRead more: The 16 Best J. Lo Movies Of All Time\n\nLopez famously poked fun of the relentless media scrutiny around Bennifer in her 2002 music video for “Jenny from the Block,” in which Affleck cameoed as himself, notoriously kissing her bikini-clad posterior on a yacht, as the paparazzi swarmed. But in real life, it led to the couple postponing their wedding in September 2003, just three days before their planned nuptials. “Due to the excessive media attention surrounding our wedding, we have decided to postpone the date,\" they said in a statement. \"When we found ourselves seriously contemplating hiring three separate 'decoy brides' at three different locations, we realized that something was awry.”\n\nThe pair broke up in early 2004, before swiftly jumping into new relationships—Lopez married singer Marc Anthony in June 2004, while Affleck wed actor Jennifer Garner in June 2005. Over the next two decades, they both welcomed children, went through divorces, and weathered undue media scrutiny. This came for things as insignificant as a back tattoo and smoking while looking disinterested, and as sobering as a rumored cheating scandal (Affleck's divorce from Garner came on the heels of an alleged affair with their one-time nanny, Christine Ouzonian; Affleck denied any romantic or sexual relationship with her) and the breaking of an engagement (Lopez called off her engagement to baseball star Alex Rodriguez amid reports of his infidelity). They lived, arguably, an entire lifetime without each other before they gloriously, miraculously, reentered each other’s lives in mid-2021, in the ultimate pandemic reconnection with an ex.\n\nRead more: A Guide to All the Cameos in Jennifer Lopez’s Star-Studded This Is Me…Now: A Love Story\n\nOnce again, their romance captivated like a real-life rom-com, providing endless thrills to those watching while socially distancing at home as Lopez went Instagram official with Affleck by posting photos of the couple on a yacht for her birthday that summer, seemingly recreating their scenes from “Jenny from the Block.” Like its OG counterpart, Bennifer 2.0 has had no shortage of delights, from corny couples Dunkin’ Donuts commercials and gushing interviews to its very whirlwind nature—the pair were engaged by April 2022 before getting married not just once, but twice. While their rekindled romance has given us many things, This Is Me…Now and The Greatest Love Story Never Told among them, it’s been a reminder that as long as Bennifer is in this world, romance is alive and well.\n\nHere, a comprehensive look back at Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck’s relationship history.\n\nDecember 2001: Affleck and Lopez meet on the set of Gigli\n\nWhile Lopez and Affleck said they had been at parties together in the past, they didn’t formally meet until they began working together on the set of the romantic comedy Gigli. Affleck played the titular role of Larry Gigli, an L.A. mobster who hires Ricki, a hit-woman, played by Lopez.\n\nIn a 2003 interview with Vanity Fair, Affleck says that while he and Lopez connected quickly on the set of Gigli, it was entirely platonic because she was married at the time. In the fall of 2001, Lopez married Chris Judd, one of the back-up dancers in her \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" music video.\n\n“When I met her, we became really, really, really good friends,” he said. “But at first, because she was married, there was no thought of a romantic relationship, so that created the opportunity to get to know each other without any of the falseness that goes with courtship because you're trying to make a good impression.\"\n\nMarch 2002: Affleck places full-page ads in trade publications in support of Lopez\n\nAfter Lopez was named ShoWest's Female Star of the Year, Affleck took out full-page ads in the Hollywood Reporter and Variety in support of her. While Affleck claimed that his ads for Lopez were written to counteract narratives that she was a diva or difficult to work with, his glowing message to her piqued interest in their relationship.\n\n“You have shown kindness, dedication, diligence, humility, graciousness of spirit, beauty in courage, great empathy, astonishing talent, real poise and true grace,” he wrote. “It has been nothing but an honor and a pleasure to work with you. I only wish I were lucky enough to be in all your movies. With love, respect and gratitude, Ben Affleck.''\n\nJuly 2002: Lopez divorces husband Cris Judd\n\nLopez divorced Judd after nine months of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences. Judd was her second husband (she was previously married to actor Ojani Noa).\n\nWhile Affleck emphasized in his Vanity Fair interview that he didn’t think about Lopez romantically when they met, he said things changed after she told him that she was splitting from her husband.\n\n\"It changed when she told me she was getting separated,\" Affleck said. \"At that point, it became a possibility; doors were opened.\"\n\nNovember 2002: Affleck and Lopez star in her music video for “Jenny from the Block”\n\nFor her music video for “Jenny from the Block,” a single off her then upcoming album, This Is Me…Then, Lopez and Affleck appeared as versions of themselves, trying to escape the paparazzi.
