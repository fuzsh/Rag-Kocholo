        "text": "Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are reportedly \"taking a second\" to figure things out amid rumors that there is trouble and \"tension\" in their marriage.\n\nThe \"On the Floor\" singer and Academy Award winner have recently sparked speculation that they could be heading for a split after reportedly not being seen together in more than a month, along with Affleck being photographed by TMZ without his wedding ring and Lopez reacting to cryptic online posts about unhealthy relationships. A source familiar with the couple known as Bennifer told Entertainment Tonight that despite increased \"tension\" for the couple, they are \"not over yet.\"\n\n\"Jen and Ben's relationship is not over yet, but they have been staying in separate homes and the tension has been high,\" the source said. \"They are taking a second to figure out what each of them is going through and wants. Both of them have been very down.\"\n\nAnother source recently told ET that the couple has their \"ups and downs,\" noting that \"they're not always on the same page\" and \"they both have so much going on between taking care of their families and their work commitments and it can be a lot for them.\"\n\nThe couple were spotted together on Sunday (May 19) smiling outside the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica, California, and the Argo director was notably wearing his wedding band, People reports. Their outing came days after they were seen arriving separately to an event on Wednesday (May 16) to support their children; however they were both reportedly wearing their wedding rings and left the event together."
