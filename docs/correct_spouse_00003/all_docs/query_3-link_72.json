        "text": "Nothing but love from Lopez! Jennifer Lopez stayed upbeat when asked about ex-husband Marc Anthonyâs recent engagement to model Shannon De Lima.\n\nâIâm happy for him,â she told New York Daily News (via Philly.com) of his impending nuptials. âI am totally single. Itâs not going to be forever. Someone great will come along.â\n\nUs broke news earlier this week that Anthony, 46, proposed to De Lima back in March, and the couple are set to walk down the aisle in mid-November in the Dominican Republic.\n\nAs the Latin singer prepares to wed, Lopez has been making the rounds promoting her new tell-all memoir, True Love. In it, she gives details on her relationship with Anthony and how their marriage fell apart.\n\nThank You!\n\nYou have successfully subscribed.\n\nâThings between Marc and me werenât perfect,â she admitted in the book. âOur marriage was never the kind to glide along peacefully. From the beginning it was tumultuous, passionate and explosive.â\n\nAnthony waited in the wings for years after first meeting Lopez in the late â90s. Lopez divorced her first husband Ojani Noa in 1998, married backup dancer Cris Judd in 2001, had a two-year romance with P. Diddy, and was engaged to Ben Affleck in 2002 before settling down with Anthony. The couple welcomed twins Max and Emme in 2008, and announced their split in 2011.\n\nAnthony has four other children from his previous relationships with Dayanara Torres and Debbie Rosado. This will be his third marriage.\n\nncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGepp6es6a%2BjKWmqZ2qYr%2BmrcKtqmasn2K6or7CZpinrJiku7q%2FjJ6loJmXmrqmutNmq6hlo52ur7rOp2SdnV2htq6tjGtnamxoZn4%3D\n\nShare!"
