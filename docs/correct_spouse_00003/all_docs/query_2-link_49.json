        "text": "Marc Anthony laughed off a report that Alex Rodriguez thinks his ex Jennifer Lopez “might miss what they had together.”\n\nAnthony — who was married to Lopez from 2004 to 2014 — commented on an OK magazine report with a series of laughing emojis in response to a story about the former Yankee slugger still pining over Lopez.\n\n“He believes Jen might start to miss what they had together, but she’s ready to put him in her rearview mirror,” a source is quoted in the tabloid as saying of Anthony.\n\nPage Six broke the news in March 2021 that Lopez and Rodriguez called off their engagement. We also were first to report that Lopez and ex Ben Affleck had rekindled their early-aughts relationship in April 2021.\n\nLopez has made it clear she’s happier than ever after getting back together with the “Good Will Hunting” actor.\n\n“I don’t think anybody was more surprised than us,” Lopez said on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” last week. “You never could imagine that something like that could happen. It’s a beautiful thing.”\n\nThe pair dated in 2002 and got engaged but called it quits in 2004.\n\nShe admitted to DeGeneres, 64, that she is “in love” with Affleck again, adding, “We’re older now, we’re smarter, we have more experience, we’re at different places in our lives, we have kids now, and we have to be very conscious of those things.”\n\n“We’re so protective because it is such a beautiful time for all of us.”\n\nLopez shares her 13-year-old twins, Max and Emme, with Anthony, while Affleck has three children — Violet, 16, Seraphina, 13, and Samuel, 9 — with ex-wife Jennifer Garner.\n\nRodriguez, for his part, is still on the market."
