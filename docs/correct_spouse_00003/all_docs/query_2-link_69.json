        "text": "Marc Anthony has fuelled speculation that his split from wife of seven years Jennifer Lopez was less of an amicable decision than it has been made out.\n\nIn a joint statement released on Friday, the couple stated: \"We have decided to end our marriage. This was a very difficult decision. We have come to an amicable conclusion on all matters.\n\n\"It is a painful time for all involved, and we appreciate the respect of our privacy at this time.\"\n\nBut Anthony made subtle reference to his personal life during his concert in Colombia last night, telling the crowd: \"They say I'm a single man.\"\n\nIt was the 42-year-old's only comment on the subject at the event.\n\nHowever, his statement comes amid reports that he and Jennifer Lopez are currently fighting over who should feature un new reality TV show Q'Viva! The Chosen.\n\nMedia mogul Simon Fuller wanted both of them to front the programmes. However, it now appears that J-Lo is likely to pull out of the show as the pair can barely speak to each other about their children.\n\nColombian TV network Caracol reported that Anthony's management went to lengths to ensure that he was shielded from the press at the Parque Simon Bolivar stadium last night, even claiming that security measures to stop him asking questions were \"extreme\".\n\nThe singer opened the show with a rendition of Aguanile, too - the single he performed with J-Lo on the American Idol finale in May.\n\nIt has since emerged that J-Lo broke it off with Marc Anthony just hours before attending the BAFTA Brits To Watch event last weekend, where Jennifer met Prince William and Kate Middleton alone.\n\nWhile the news came as a shock to many, friends of the couple told reporters that it has been a long time coming.\n\nJ-Lo's stylist, Phillip Bloch, said: \"This is not a surprise.\n\n\"Marc is very controlling. In the beginning she liked that because he stood up to her, and in the early days he was very much in love with her and she was with him.\"\n\nHowever, cracks are said to have formed in the relationship after J-Lo's mother moved into their Long Island mansion in 2008 to help look after newborn twins, Max and Emme.\n\n\"They also clashed when she learned he owed millions in unpaid taxes on the Long Island estate,\" said film-maker Ed Meyer, a friend of J-Lo's first husband, Ojani Noa.\n\n\"The other problem was that they couldn't agree where to live.\n\n\"J-Lo's career is in Hollywood and she wanted to live in their Malibu mansion and Marc loved New York. She was going to move to New York in a last-ditch effort to save the marriage. But last Monday I heard it was all over.\"\n\nIn a documentary recorded last year, Lopez revealed that she dated Anthony briefly in her youth, but ended it because neither of them were ready to settle down.\n\nThe pair got back together to record a track for Lopez's movie Shall We Dance.\n\n\"We reconnected like we had never been apart,\" she said.\n\nSOURCE: DAILY MAIL\n\nA-LIST LOVE LIVES\n\nCELEBRITY STYLE WARS - J-LO Vs CHERYL COLE"
