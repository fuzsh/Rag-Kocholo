        "text": "Ben Affleck (2002 - 2005, 2021-present)\n\nLopez and Affleck were previously engaged in 2003, after meeting on the set of the RomCom Gigli. The couple called it quits in 2004. “I am confirming the report that Jennifer Lopez has ended her engagement to Ben Affleck,” J-Lo’s rep said in a statement at the time. “At this difficult time, we ask that you respect her privacy.” In her 2014 memoir, True Love, J-Lo referred to her and Ben’s breakup as the “first real heartbreak” she experienced. “Ben and I split up at the moment when I thought we were committing to each other forever,” she wrote.“It was my first real heartbreak, it felt like my heart had been torn out of my chest.”\n\nHowever, things got back on track when Ben and Jennifer reunited in 2021 after sixteen years apart. The pair rekindled their relationship in April 2021 following J-Lo’s split from Alex Rodriguez, whom she broke up with after four years together. At this time, Ben was already divorced from his ex-wife Jennifer Garner, in which they were together from 2005 to 2018.\n\nBen proposed to J-Lo in April 2022. In an installment of her OntheJLo fan newsletter, J-Lo revealed that she and Affleck were engaged again. “Did you ever imagine your biggest dream could come true? Saturday night while at my favorite place on earth (in the bubble bath), my beautiful love got on one knee and proposed,” Lopez wrote in her newsletter. “I was taken totally off guard and just looked in his eyes smiling and crying at the same time trying to get my head around the fact that after 20 years this was happening all over again.” She continued, “I was quite literally speechless and he said, ‘Is that a yes?’ I said, ‘YES of course that’s a YES,’” she wrote. Lopez continued, “I was smiling so big and tears were coming down my face, feeling so incredibly happy and whole. It was nothing fancy at all, but it was the most romantic thing I could’ve ever imagined…just a quiet Saturday night at home, two people promising to always be there for each other.”\n\nTMZ first reported that Bennifer is officially married. The news outlet obtained the couple’s marriage license in Clark County, Nevada on July 16, 2022. The marriage license includes both of their legal names: Benjamin Geza Affleck and Jennifer Lynn Lopez. Sources close to the couple also confirm that the two did indeed get married in Las Vegas.\n\nJ-Lo and Ben had their second wedding at his estate in Riceboro, Georgia. The wedding was held on the weekend of August 19, 2022. According to Page Six, the second wedding was held for three days. There was a rehearsal dinner on Friday, and the actual ceremony took place on Saturday. On Sunday, the wedding concluded with a barbecue and picnic on Sunday. As for who attended the intimate wedding, friends like Matt Damon, Jimmy Kimmel, George Clooney, Renee Zellweger, Jane Fonda and Drea de Matteo were in attendance. J-Lo and Ben’s longtime friend and podcaster Jay Shetty officiated the wedding. Everyone in J-Lo and Ben’s blended family was there. Ben’s kids: Violet, 16, Seraphina, 13 and Samuel, 10, and Jennifer’s twins with ex-husband Marc Anthony: Emme and Maximilian, 14.\n\nMarc Anthony (2004 - 2014)\n\nJennifer Lopez was married to Marc Anthony for ten years. The “Jenny From The Block” singer met Anthony at the Broadway musical The Capeman where he starred in 1998. In J-Lo’s book True Love, the singer revealed that Marc Anthony said to her, “One day you’re going to be my wife.” The two reportedly dated in the early 2000s but nothing serious came out of it. They also collaborated on J-Lo’s first album with the song “No Me Ames” in 1999. The pair reunited in 2004 and secretly tied the knot in June of that year.\n\nBy 2008, the married couple welcomed their twins—Emme Maribel Muniz and Maximilian David Minuz. Unfortunately, J-Lo and Marc’s marriage didn’t last. The pair announced their separation in July 2011, saying in a statement at the time, “This was a very difficult decision. We have come to an amicable conclusion.” It was Marc who eventually went on to file for divorce from Jen in 2012, citing “irreconcilable differences” at the time.\n\nA source told HollywoodLife in 2021 that Marc didn’t “care” about who J-Lo is dating after she reunited with Ben following her breakup with Alex Rodriguez. “Marc just wants Jennifer to be happy. He doesn’t care who she is with or where she is living,” the insider said. “He’s fine with her spending more time in L.A. and they’ll have an arrangement for the kids that works. They support each other’s wants and needs and make it work.”\n\nThe source continued, “They’re very close and act like the best of friends. They are a family unit for everything. They have such a healthy, open relationship and tell each other a lot. He looks at this as if Ben makes her happy, then she should be with Ben. He wants her to live a life that brings her happiness and he really means that. All exes should be like them!”\n\nA source also told Entertainment Tonight in 2021 that Marc supported J-Lo and Ben’s relationship as long as his kids with his ex-wife were also happy. “Marc just wants Jen to be happy and fulfilled,” the insider said. “His main concern is the well-being of J.Lo and their kids. As long as Ben keeps her and their kids happy, he has Marc’s stamp of approval.”\n\nOjani Noa(1997-1998)\n\nOjani Noa was Jennifer Lopez’s first husband from 1997-1998. In an interview with The Daily Mail, Ajoani—a Cuban refugee who fled his home when he was 15 in an inflatable boat—explained that he met J-Lo when he was 22 years old while he worked as a dishwasher and waiter at Gloria Estefan’s Ocean Drive restaurant Lario’s On The Beach. “Miami was buzzing. I did some modelling. I hustled. I wanted the American dream – and I found it when Jen walked into Lario’s,” he said. “I had no idea who she was. Our eyes glanced at each other and I thought she was the most beautiful woman I’d ever seen.”\n\nThe next night J-Lo returned to the restaurant, where Noa served her another customer’s French fries after the “On the Floor” singer said they looked “yummy.” “I was smitten. She was wearing a white top and trousers, and I remember thinking she had the best body I’d ever seen. She later told me she knew that first night she was going to marry me,” he said. That night, J-Lo and Ojani partied at the club Commune, where he learned from J-Lo’s friend that she was interested in him.”When we got to the club my friend Leo took Jen to the dance floor, and I thought, ‘Oh man, you’re a lucky guy.’ Then [her friend] said, ‘When they get back, take Jen out there. It’s you she’s interested in,’” he said. “They get back and I take her hand and lead her on to the floor, and a slow song comes on. It was electric. She was shaking and said, ‘You make me nervous.’ “We could both feel the romantic energy. It was instant and intense. Like it was surging through our bodies. I said, ‘I feel the same way you’re feeling.’ I lifted her chin and gave her a kiss – it was a kiss like we’d known each other forever.”\n\nAfter 11 months of marriage, J-Lo and Ojani divorced. J-Lo went on to date P. Diddy soon after. In his settlement agreement with J-Lo, Ojani was left with $50,000 and kept his wedding ring.“There were times she told me she wanted to get back together. In quiet moments she would say, ‘I need you in my life. I don’t want to lose you,’” Ojani said. In 2002, four years after their divorce, J-Lo hired Ojani to manage a restaurant she owned in Los Angeles. After she fired him three years later, Ojani sued J-Lo, settled with her and moved back to Florida, where he remains single. Ojani also told The Daily Mail that he thinks his marriage with J-Lo would have lasted if it were not for “parasites who feed off celebrities” and reports that characterized him as a “penniless waiter.”"
