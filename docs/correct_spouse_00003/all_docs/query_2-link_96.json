        "text": "Jennifer Lopez's exes are opening up about how they really feel about her.\n\nThe \"On The Floor\" singer graced the May cover of InStyle magazine Monday, which also included comments from exes Ben Affleck and Marc Anthony about her work ethic, talent and career.\n\nAnthony, who was married to Lopez from 2004 to 2014, commended his ex-wife for her \"ability to see and understand things before they happen.\"\n\n\"Before she even brings an idea up, she has visualized it a thousand times. And if anyone says it might not be the greatest idea, she'll say, 'You just don't see it yet.' Nine times out of 10, she'll nail it.\"\n\nMore: Jennifer Lopez and ex-husband Marc Anthony share a kiss at the Latin Grammys\n\nHe continued, calling her \"the hardest worker I've ever met.\"\n\n\"When we were together, it was quite the opposite for me. That has changed since. I learned so much from her. She's the original!\"\n\nSimilarly, Affleck also offered words of support for his ex-fianc√©e. Known to the tabloids as \"Bennifer,\" Lopez and Affleck started dating in the early 2000s and starred together in 2003's \"Gigli\" and 2004's \"Jersey Girl.\"\n\n\"I thought I had a good work ethic, but I was completely humbled and blown away by what she was committed to doing day in and day out, the seriousness in which she took her work, the quiet and dedicated way she went about accomplishing her goals, and then how she would go back and redouble her efforts,\" Affleck said.\n\nJennifer Lopez, Alex Rodriguez: say they're still a couple: 'We are working through some things'\n\n\"She remains, to this day, the hardest-working person I've come across in this business. She has great talent, but she has also worked very hard for her success, and I'm so happy for her that she seems, at long last, to be getting the credit she deserves.\"\n\nIn addition of praising her talent, Affleck also pointed out her seeming inability to age.\n\n\"Where are you keeping the fountain of youth? Why do you look the same as you did in 2003 and it kind of looks like I'm in my 40s&mldr;at best?\" he joked.\n\nLopez was previously married to waiter Ojani Noa (1997 to 1998) and dancer Cris Judd (2001 to 2003) before marrying Anthony, with whom she shares 13-year-old twins, Maximilian \"Max\" David and Emme Maribel. Lopez got engaged to Alex Rodriguez in March 2019.\n\n'The more the merrier': Alex Rodriguez says exes will be invited to his, Jennifer Lopez's wedding\n\nContributing: Hannah Yasharoff"
