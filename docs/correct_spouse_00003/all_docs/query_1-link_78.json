        "text": "Fans are aghast: another divorce for Jennifer Lopez? Sources are reporting that the popular actress known for her hectic love life, and her recent hubby Ben Affleck, may be heading for splitsville after less than two years of marriage.\n\nThe celebrity couple, affectionately known as “Bennifer,” were last seen together seven weeks ago, at the end of March, while grabbing lunch in New York City. In the meantime, it seems that they have been going their separate ways.\n\nJennifer Lopez’s romantic history is as publicized as her career, marked by a series of high-profile relationships, marriages, and subsequent divorces. Lopez’s first marriage was to Ojani Noa in 1997, a union that lasted less than a year but seemed to set the pattern for her tumultuous love life. Following Noa, she found companionship with Cris Judd, a dancer she met on the set of her music video, leading to a marriage from 2001 to 2003. The pattern of her relationships often intertwining with her career continued when she married singer Marc Anthony in 2004, with whom she shares two children; this relationship defied the pattern and lasted a decade before also concluding in divorce.\n\nLopez’s engagements have also been a topic of interest, including her first high-profile engagement to actor Ben Affleck in the early 2000s, which ended before they walked down the aisle. However, in a twist that delighted fans, Lopez and Affleck rekindled their romance nearly two decades later, leading to a marriage that now seems to be headed for the rocky shore of divorce.\n\nLopez remains optimistic and undeterred. Whether discussing her past relationships or her current marital status, Lopez approaches the subject with a blend of humor, candor, and an appreciation of love’s many possibilities.\n\nBen Affleck too has had a highly publicized personal life, but his 2005 marriage to popular actress Jennifer Garner lasted a decade; they announced their separation in 2015, and finalized their divorce in 2018. While they were married, they became one of Hollywood’s most beloved couples. Garner and Affleck share three children.\n\nIn 2021, Affleck rekindled his romance with Lopez and married in 2022 amidst a firestorm of media attention and promises of everlasting love. Inside sources are now claiming that Affleck has already moved out of their marital home. “They just couldn’t make it work”, the source added.\n\n“He’s focusing on his work and his kids now. Ben already moved out and they’ll likely have to sell the dream house they spent two years searching for,” the insider went on to say.\n\nReportedly, part of the trouble stems from their disagreement about the public nature of their relationship. While Ben believes that, “Things that are private, I’d always felt are sacred and special because in part they’re private…” Jennifer released her Amazon Prime documentary, “The Greatest Love Story Never Told”, in February, which chronicled her love story with Ben, with all its highs and lows. For Affleck this may have been the last nail in the coffin of their foundering marriage.\n\nJennifer has already been spotted house hunting."
