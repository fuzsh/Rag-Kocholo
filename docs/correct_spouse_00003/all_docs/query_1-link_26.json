        "text": "Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are reportedly on “two different pages” in their marriage amid rumors they are headed toward divorce.\n\n“Jen and Ben are having issues in their marriage,” a source told Us Weekly Thursday. “They started having issues a few months ago as Jen had started ramping up work commitments and prepping for her tour.”\n\nPer the insider, the “On the Floor” songstress “is very focused on work” as she is set to start her “This is Me … Now: A Love Story” world tour in Orlando, Fla., next month.\n\n“They are on two completely different pages most of the time,” the source added.\n\nWhile Lopez, 54, was recently spotted house hunting in Los Angeles, Calif., on Tuesday, the insider insisted she was merely searching for an investment property.\n\nHowever, another source told the outlet that Affleck, 51, was living in a separate home from the “Let’s Get Loud” singer.\n\nThey also alleged the A-list couple isn’t ready to throw in the towel yet as another echoed they are working on their marriage.\n\nAccording to InTouch, Affleck and Lopez are also in couples therapy.\n\n“Ben believes in therapy, to a point, and is willing to be a good sport about participating with an open mind, even though he hates the whole humiliating process,” an insider told the outlet.\n\n“He’s never going to gauge the success of this marriage by what happens in the therapist’s office. He also has a higher tolerance for conflict and having to fight to get his way than the average guy.”\n\nThe source alleged they’ve known the “Argo” star for more than 10 years and “everything is a fight” between him and the pop star.\n\nReps for the duo weren’t immediately available to Page Six for comment.\n\nOn Thursday, the “Gone Girl” star was seen in photos obtained by Page Six leaving a Brentwood neighborhood as TMZ reported he was staying in a house nearby.\n\nThe actor rode in his black sports car with his arm out the window and his wedding ring noticeably on his finger.\n\nAffleck has been reportedly staying at the Brentwood home — which is near his ex-wife Jennifer Garner’s house — for the “past week or so.”\n\nLopez and the father of three haven’t been photographed together for the past 47 days as the “Can’t Get Enough” singer attended the 2024 Met Gala alone last week.\n\nPer TMZ, the “Good Will Hunting” star couldn’t make it to the A-list event of the year because he was working on his forthcoming film, “The Accountant 2.”\n\nHowever, the night before the Met, Affleck made an appearance at Tom Brady’s Netflix roast on May 5.\n\nLopez — who tied the knot with Affleck in July 2022 — was previously wed to ex-husband Marc Anthony.\n\nShe and the “Vivir Mi Vida” crooner share 16-year-old twins Emme and Max.\n\nAs for Affleck, he shares kids Violet, 18, Seraphina, 15, and Samuel, 12, with Garner, 52."
