        "text": "Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck’s marriage has been in flux for a while now.\n\nA source told Page Six Monday that they’ve been apart since March, but Affleck is “very protective of Jennifer.” Reps for the couple did not comment.\n\n“Bennifer” have been at the center of divorce rumors for months.\n\nOn Monday, Page Six also reported that the A-listers are selling pieces of art from their $60 million Beverly Hills home, which is also on the market.\n\nCollectors and interested buyers were reportedly purchasing “art and some pieces” that were “newly on sale” from their house in early June.\n\nThe rumors about the couple’s marriage began in early May, when Lopez attended the 2024 Met Gala without her husband.\n\nSoon after, Affleck was reported to be staying at a separate house from Lopez.\n\nInTouch reported that the pair were in therapy to work on their marital issues.\n\n“Ben believes in therapy, to a point, and is willing to be a good sport about participating with an open mind, even though he hates the whole humiliating process,” a source told the outlet.\n\nMore recently, Affleck and Lopez’s million Beverly Hills mansion was listed on Zillow in June. Affleck has since moved his belongings out of the house, according to People.\n\nThe stars have spent the start of the summer mostly apart, with Lopez taking a trip to Italy without the “Argo” actor, who stayed home in Los Angeles.\n\nThe “Let’s Get Loud” singer enjoyed a boat ride and a dinner with friends in Positano during the trip. Afterwards, she took a commercial flight to Paris Fashion Week with her bodyguard.\n\nA source told People that the “Hustlers” star — who canceled her world tour amid the marital woes — was “grateful” for time to herself, and that she and Affleck are “doing their own thing so far this summer.”\n\nWhile his wife was in Europe, Affleck made headlines for confronting paparazzi who were using flash cameras as he was behind the wheel pulling out of the couple’s mansion. He got out of his car and chastised the photographers, warning them that they’re putting his life in danger.\n\nDespite the ongoing rumors about their marriage, Lopez did make it a point to praise Affleck on Father’s Day on June 19.\n\nShe called Affleck her “hero” with an old photo of her husband.\n\nLopez and Affleck were initially together from 2002 to 2004. They ended their engagement in January 2004 after delaying their wedding “due to the excessive media attention” that surrounded the couple at the time.\n\nFollowing the breakup, they went on to marry and have kids with other partners. Affleck had three children with Jennifer Garner, while Lopez had twins with Marc Anthony."
