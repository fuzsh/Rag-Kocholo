        "text": "Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez have listed their shared Beverley Hills mansion amidst swirling gossip about their marriage issues, hinting at a potentially quick sale.\n\nThe Hollywood couple's recent latest move has further ignited rumors concerning troubles in their marriage. The duo were reported by CNN on Tuesday to be selling their colossal 12-bedroom, 24-bathroom California mansion - a property refurbished to the highest standards over the last four months.\n\nThe public real estate listing describes the vast 38,000-square-foot residence as: \"Recently renovated with the highest level of quality within the last four months.\"\n\nClick here to follow the Mirror US on Google News to stay up to date with all the latest news, sport and entertainment stories.\n\nREAD MORE: Jennifer Lopez furious over Ben Affleck's secret exit and massive 'slap in the face'\n\nREAD MORE: Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck publicly list $68 million Beverly Hills mansion amid divorce rumors\n\nAdditionally, their luxurious property is strictly termed as \"Nestled in one of Beverly Hills's most exclusive and secure enclaves...the magnificent Crestview Manor.\"\n\nReflecting upon recent headlines, it seems that their reported relationship difficulties have triggered the imminent sale of the \"masterpiece\" mansion hopefully sooner rather than later. The couple, affectionately dubbed \"Bennifer\" by fans, first sparked romance rumors in the early 2000s. They later got engaged in November 2002 but called it quits before tying the knot.\n\nBoth went on to marry and start families with others - Affleck has three children, Violet, 18, Seraphina, 15, and Samuel, 12, with ex-wife Jennifer Garner, while Lopez is mum to twins Max and Emme, 16, with ex-husband Marc Anthony.\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, both found themselves single again and rekindled their romance in 2021, before saying 'I do' in a Las Vegas ceremony in 2022. However, whispers about trouble in paradise began circulating in May 2024. These rumors surfaced around the same time Lopez was preparing for her fifth concert tour, This is Me, in support of her ninth studio album.\n\nThe 30-date tour, which reportedly put a strain on their relationship, has since been cancelled. On 31 May 2024, J-Lo issued a heartfelt statement expressing her devastation over the decision. She said: \"Please know that I wouldn't do this if I didn't feel that it was absolutely necessary.\"\n\nSince then, there have been reports suggesting Affleck \"never felt comfortable\" in their family home. The listing of their house seems to hint that home isn't where the heart is for the pair.\n\nUS Weekly reported that the couple were eager to sell, stating: \"They decided to list the house very recently, within the last week. They thought they could sell it off-market but made a game-time decision in order to put more eyes on the property.\" They went on to say: \"Ben especially wants to be done with the house. He was never happy there.\" The publication also disclosed that the couple were \"still living separately,\" adding: \"Nothing has been decided yet as far as the divorce.\"\n\nDespite buying the property (which boasts a 5,000-square-foot guest penthouse, caretaker house, two-bedroom guardhouse, 12-car garage and parking for up to 80 vehicles) for $60 million in June 2023, it was publicly listed on Thursday 11 July 2024 for a whopping $68 million.\n\n* An AI tool was used to add an extra layer to the editing process for this story."
