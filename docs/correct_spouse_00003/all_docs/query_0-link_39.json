        "text": "Here’s Jennifer Lopez basking in wedded bliss moments after marrying hubby No. 3, Marc Anthony, over the weekend.\n\nBut bliss might not be the word for the hunky salsa star after the whirlwind wedding – a new report says he was pressured by the twice-divorced diva.\n\nUS Weekly reports that J.Lo put the screws to Anthony to divorce his wife, former Miss Universe Dayanara Torres, so they could get hitched – and he buckled under the pressure.\n\nThe bombshell wed the Latin heartthrob in a surprise service at her posh Los Angeles estate.\n\nThe ink was only four days dry on Anthony’s divorce papers when he and J.Lo walked down the aisle in front of 30 guests early Saturday night.\n\nThe Post scooped the world on the future Lopez-Anthony nuptials back on May 10.\n\nPage Six reported how the singer-actress had started wearing a diamond engagement ring from Anthony, shortly after returning ex-love Ben Affleck’s pink diamond engagement ring.\n\nTo the strains of Vivaldi’s “Four Seasons” played by a string quartet, J.Lo, 33, and Anthony, 34, stood at a flower-covered altar under a white canopy and said their “I do’s.”\n\nLopez’s off-white gown was ankle-length, off-the-shoulder, fitted at the top with layers of ruffles covering her legs.\n\nHer hair was up in a modified beehive with a veil streaming down her back, and she carried a bouquet of white and pink flowers.\n\nBeforehand, Lopez was fitted with baubles by jeweler Neil Lane, and spruced up by makeup artist Scott Barnes and hairstylist Oribe, US said.\n\nStylists from Dolce & Gabbana applied the finishing touches.\n\n“She looked happy and beautiful,” an eyewitness told the mag.\n\nThe groom was dapper – decked out in a cream-colored suit with a striped gray and yellow tie. Bridesmaids wore turquoise dresses.\n\nThe ceremony ended with the newlyweds walking up the aisle with a white umbrella as friends and family members cheered.\n\nLopez and wedding dresses have a long history together.\n\nLast September, she was set to marry Affleck, and had ordered a $15,000 gown from Vera Wang – but the ceremony was cancelled just days before it was scheduled.\n\nShe also had blink-and-you’ll-miss-it marriages to waiter Ojani Noa and dancer Cris Judd.\n\nAs Lopez and Anthony partied at a small reception afterward, Affleck was recuperating from “a nasty case of bronchitis” at his mom’s home, US Weekly said, but he gave his ex-love’s latest hookup “two thumbs up.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Paula Froelich"
