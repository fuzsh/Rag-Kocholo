        "text": "Marc Anthony and his wife, Nadia Ferreira, delighted fans on Tuesday by sharing the first glimpse of their baby boy's face as he reached the milestone of nine months old.\n\nThe couple welcomed their son last June and took to Instagram to commemorate the occasion with a heartwarming post.\n\n\"Happy 9 months. my everything mommy and daddy love you!!!!\" read the joint caption accompanying the adorable snapshot, translated from Spanish to English.\n\nThe romance between the 55-year-old music icon and the 24-year-old beauty queen sparked speculation following a public outing in Mexico City in 2022.\n\nConfirming their relationship later that year via Instagram with a cozy selfie taken aboard an airplane in March, the couple expressed their wishes for divine blessings in the caption, setting the stage for their journey together.\n\nTheir love story progressed swiftly, with the couple announcing their engagement just three months later during a lavish celebration at Miami's Sexy Fish restaurant. The excitement peaked on Jan. 28, 2023, when Ferreira and Anthony exchanged vows in a star-studded ceremony at the Pérez Art Museum in Miami, Florida.\n\nAmong the esteemed guests attending the nuptials were David and Victoria Beckham, Salma Hayek, Lin Manuel Miranda and Luis Fonsi.\n\nAnthony, born Marco Antonio Muñiz, is already a father to six children from previous relationships. He shares daughter Arianna, 30, and son Chase, 28, with ex-girlfriend Debbie Rosado; sons Cristian, 23, and Ryan, 20, with ex-wife Dayanara Torres; and twins Emme and Maximilian, 16, with ex-wife Jennifer Lopez.\n\nDespite his monumental success in the entertainment industry, Anthony confessed to CBS Sunday Morning about his one regret: being unable to spend more time as a stay-at-home dad.\n\n\"The one regret would be that what I chose to do took so much of my time,\" he shared. \"What I would have done to have been a stay-at-home dad, and you know, witnessed every second of everything. I would have loved that. Didn't work out that way.\"\n\nReflecting on his career's demands, Anthony expressed his longing to witness every moment of his children's lives, lamenting the sacrifices made in pursuit of his passion. \"It's the one thing that just tugs at me going and -- that's the biggest sacrifice,\" he shared. \"And you start to wonder was it all worth it. Was it worth it? You know, on that level.\""
