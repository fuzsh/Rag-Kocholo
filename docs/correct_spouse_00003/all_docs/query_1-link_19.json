        "text": "How do you like them apples?\n\nAmid the rumors that Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez are on the rocks, a Prime Video documentary covers how Affleck had one demand when they rekindled their romance.\n\nIn Lopez’s doc, “The Greatest Love Story Never Told,” (now streaming), Affleck said that he refused to have their relationship broadcast on social media.\n\n“Getting back together, I said, ‘Listen, one of the things I don’t want is a relationship on social media,’” he said in the film.\n\n“Then I sort of realized it’s not a fair thing to ask. It’s sort of like you’re going to marry a boat captain and (you’re like), ‘Well, I don’t like the water.’”\n\nLopez has posted about Affleck on social media frequently, such as a photo of the couple kissing or cuddling on vacation.\n\nAffleck, 51, and Lopez, 54, were initially together from 2002 to 2004. They ended their engagement in 2004, and went on to marry and have kids with other people – respectively, Jennifer Garner and Marc Anthony.\n\nAffleck and Lopez rekindled their flame in 2021, and tied the knot in 2022. They share a blended family of five kids. He shares kids Violet, 18, Seraphina, 15, and Samuel, 12, with Garner, 52, while Lopez is mom to 16-year-old twins Emme and Max with ex-husband Anthony.\n\nBut now, there are rumors that they may be on the rocks.\n\nThe rumors began surfacing when she attended the 2024 Met Gala solo last week.\n\nThen, it was reported that Affleck is staying at a separate house from Lopez.\n\nPage Six obtained photos of the “Good Will Hunting” actor riding in his sports car Thursday morning in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, where TMZ reported he left a house that he’d been staying the night in.\n\nEarlier this week, Lopez was seen house hunting, without Affleck.\n\nInTouch reported that Lopez and the “Gone Girl” actor are in therapy to work on their marital issues.\n\n“Ben believes in therapy, to a point, and is willing to be a good sport about participating with an open mind, even though he hates the whole humiliating process,” a source told the outlet.\n\nTo add fuel to the fire, on Thursday, the “Jenny From the Block” singer “liked” an Instagram post detailing the qualities of a partner that could lead to an unhealthy relationship.\n\nThe post explained that “you cannot build a healthy relationship with somebody” who “lacks integrity and emotional safety,” “doesn’t respect your time,” lacks “communication skills” and doesn’t have a strong sense of self.\n\nAffleck has frequently looked unhappy when he’s accompanied Lopez to splashy music industry events like the Grammys – his less-than-enthusiastic demeanor even became a meme at the 2023 ceremony.\n\nThe couple hasn’t been photographed together since March, but both were still spotted wearing their wedding rings.\n\n“They started having issues a few months ago as Jen had started ramping up work commitments and prepping for her tour … They are on two completely different pages most of the time,” a source told Us Weekly on Thursday.\n\nIn the Prime Video film, Affleck also said, “We’re just two people with … different approaches, trying to learn to compromise.”"
