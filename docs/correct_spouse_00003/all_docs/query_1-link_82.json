Now\" with at least two tracks written specifically for her husband: \"Dear Ben\" (from 2002's \"This Is Me...Then\" album) and \"Dear Ben Pt. II.\"\n\nLopez announces the couple, and their children, moved in together.\n\nThe pair marries in a Las Vegas ceremony and in August has a party to celebrate at Affleck's Georgia estate.\n\nThe couple announces their engagement and Lopez shows off photos of a 8.5 carat natural green diamond ring.\n\nThe pair makes their red carpet re-debut at the 2021 Venice Film Festival and follow it up with a Met Gala appearance.\n\nRumors that Affleck and Lopez are back together are reported by Us Weekly and later confirmed by E! News and People.\n\nAffleck speaks to \"InStyle\" for the magazine's cover story about Lopez, calling her \"the hardest-working person I’ve come across in this business.\"\n\nLopez and Rodriguez officially split one month after calling off their engagement.\n\nAffleck and de Armas break up.\n\nAffleck and his \"Deep Water\" co-star Ana de Armas are spotted kissing in Costa Rica.\n\nAffleck and Shookus break up.\n\nJennifer Lopez announces she and Rodriguez are engaged.\n\nAffleck begins dating \"Saturday Night Live” producer Lindsay Shookus.\n\nLopez starts dating former Yankees player Alex Rodriguez.\n\nLopez tells People there was \"genuine love\" in their then decade-old relationship and says tabloid attention put \"a lot of pressure\" on the pair.\n\nGarner and Affleck, who have three children, announce their divorce days after their 10th wedding anniversary.\n\nLopez and Anthony finalize their divorce.\n\nAnthony and Lopez, who had two children together, announce their separation\n\nAffleck marries actress Jennifer Garner, who he met on the set of “Pearl Harbor” four years earlier and started dating in the summer of 2004.\n\nLopez marries singer Marc Anthony, who she first met in 1998.\n\nLopez and Affleck officially called it quits.\n\nThe couple postpone their wedding one day before the planned ceremony, citing \"excessive media attention.\"\n\nAffleck proposes to Lopez on a trip to Boston to visit his family and the proposal leads Lopez to cry “incredible purging tears of happiness,” she says at the time (the 6.1-carat pink diamond Harry Winston ring is reported to have cost $2.5 million).\n\nAffleck has a steamy cameo in Lopez's “Jenny from the Block” music video, which he later says he regretted: \"It not only makes me look like a petulant fool, but it surely qualifies as ungentlemanly.\"\n\nLopez is spotted kissing Affleck at her 32nd birthday party and files for divorce from Judd two days later.\n\nLopez and Affleck meet on the set of crime comedy \"Gigli\" (Lopez is married to Cris Judd at the time).\n\nForbes Valuation\n\nAffleck, 51, was ranked at No. 37 on Forbes' list of highest-paid celebrities in 2020, making $55 million that year. He's starred in box office hits like \"Batman v. Superman,\" \"Pearl Harbor\" and \"Armageddon\" over his decades-long career, and scored eight-figure salaries for recent films like \"The Last Duel\" and \"Hypnotic.\" Lopez, 54, was ranked at No. 56 on the highest-paid celebrities list that same year. It's estimated she made $47.5 million thanks to deals with Versace, DSW, Quay sunglasses and her own fragrance. She's built her fortune through eight studio albums, a Las Vegas residency and a series of world tours, including a 2019 world tour that grossed $55 million.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nForbesWhat To Know About Jennifer Lopez's Tour: Rebrand, Canceled Dates And Low Ticket And Album SalesForbesJennifer Lopez's New Album Is The Lowest-Charting Of Her Career ForbesTikTok's Jennifer Lopez 'The Bronx' Controversy, ExplainedForbesJennifer Lopez Reflects On Past Relationships, 'This Is Me...
