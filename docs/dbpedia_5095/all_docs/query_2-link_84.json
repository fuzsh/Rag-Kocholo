        "meta_description": "Although his work was almost entirely focused on the model of painting and literary description, Théophile Gautier heard the call of photography quite clearly. This can be seen from his commentary on the mountain photographs of the brothers Bisson, which he published in the early 1860s in Le Moniteur Universel and then republished in 1869 in Les Vacances du Lundi as an introduction to his accounts of his travels in the French and Swiss Alps. In this text, Gautier describes the novelty, power, and even violence of images that usher in a new kind of vision and a new conception of humanity’s relationship with the world. Through photography, we henceforth understand that the fissures and rents, chaos, and exteriority of material things, which these images display with a concreteness and precision that had never before been achieved, represent the ineluctable horizon of our existence. Far from the suggestive ‘softness’ and spirituality of paintings and descriptions, photography – and mountain photography in particular – turns disjunction and temporal and spatial caesuras into the contradictory and negative modes of all signification.",

        "text": "What are you doing here?\n\n–Théophile Gautier,\n\nLes Vacances du lundi. Tableaux de montagnes*\n\n4As Gautier contemplates these panoramic views, which the Bissons began to take around 1853 at the urging of the geologist and orographer Daniel Dollfus-Ausset – these large and astonishingly clear images depicting the Glacier du Géant, the Aiguilles de Chamonix, and the summit of Mont Blanc with remarkable accuracy and precision – the challenge in question appears to him as a set of three closely related problems, all of which are clearly discernible in this just quoted passage.\n\n6According to this view, photography is modern because it is dangerous and because its danger lies in four characteristics that shatter the classical conception of the arts by introducing into art a negativity that turns it into an astonishing object, in the philosophical sense of an object that is fantastic and disturbing because of the aporias it evokes. These are four highly problematic characteristics: art’s descent into the regions of pure physicality and pure sight without any imagination or suggestion; the subjection of works of art to the logic of the trace, of the indexical sign, and hence of tautology; an idea of the work as less an object than an event, whose fleeting occurrence the work of art captures and preserves; and finally, the paradoxical creation of the work through movements of disconnection, collage, montage, friction, and separation. It is this consciousness of a dehiscence of the world and its photographic image that is noted and developed by Théophile Gautier. It is this crease, or rather this fissure, that he seeks to show and invoke in his own text.\n\n8In the battle that at one and the same time separates and connects man and the mountain, in this struggle that joins them together by means of opposition itself, the photographic gaze thus possesses the deep and fascinating quality of being incessantly and simultaneously a victory and a defeat, just like the confrontation of black and white of which it consists.\n\n10These photographs expose reality – in the strict sense of putting it directly in front of us – and it is a real reality, simply consisting of space and time: space that is bent into bodies that collide and rebound, and time that is folded into fleeting instants or long exposures. By a process of subtraction, unveiling, or reduction, the Bissons’ photographs thus embody an objective and abstract (in the sense of separated) vision that presents the world as alien and distant because the thoughts, symbols, and feelings that human beings project onto the earth in order to live there have disappeared. Thus the photographed earth and the human beings that perch on it (who are animalized, turned into ants) are seen as if through a telescope. The latter is a device for looking at other worlds. But when it is pointed at our own, it causes us to see it as an alien place, uninhabited and uninhabitable.\n\n15Every photograph thus contains something violent and inhuman, not just because it reduces existence to the surface expanse of a visible world that is completely exposed, not just because it tends to turn the creator of images into a technician, the image into a document, and the spectator into a cold eye that observes without interpreting, but because it operates even more fundamentally. It confronts the mastery of the world by gaping silently at its failure and its constant endless overflow. The ‘vast photograph,’ as Gautier writes of the Bissons’ plates, is always open in two different senses at once: beyond its frame, its temporal and spatial cropping implies the existence off-camera of what is beside, before, or after it; and within its frame, the implacable precision and accuracy of the photograph, which is equally clear in all of its parts, suggests an infinite number of haphazard and even scattered details that proliferate endlessly before our eyes, as can clearly be seen in the Bissons’ photographs of seracs from 1859 and 1862.\n\n18In the mid-nineteenth century, the painting still embodies a dianoia or cosa mentale, since its arché is an idea. The photograph, by contrast, belongs to the order of the isolated excerpt or even the scrap or shred, that is, the fragment, and the product of tearing. The absence of logic is the principle of its extravagance, in the literal sense of something that operates on the outside. This extravagance is also its eccentricity, its idiocy, and its madness, all perfectly equivalent to the disorder of the landscape itself, which can only be looked at rather than read or interpreted because it has become impossible to paint it with words or brushes. In 1839, the year in which Daguerre’s discovery was announced, Victor Hugo, having climbed to the summit of a modest mountain of 1800 meters, put it well:\n\n23The photographic image thus seems to offer us the truth of modern man’s condition: in a world without transcendence, a world that is purely material and has no ‘afterworld’ or other world behind it, there is no way that human meanings could possibly remain unaffected by the disorder, instability, meaninglessness, and imperfection of the things that surround us. On the contrary, meanings are intimately woven out of those very things and can only appear and be conceived of as fragile constellations, shifting, ephemeral, and always proliferating. For the human being who grasps them, beauty no longer resides in an elsewhere or in the eternity of an idea or an ideal; it remains ineluctably here, within the immanence or the brief span of our ‘life, which it is impossible to go beyond,’ as Mallarmé writes. Therefore, beauty is not the opposite of ugliness, because it contains it and because its traditional names – harmony, simplicity, expression, and pleasure – are teetering on their pedestals. It is not the opposite of ugliness because it does not transcend but merely displaces it. Subject to a different logic from that of painting and poetry, which withdraw into a spontaneous interiority, affectivity, and spirituality which are those of the painting or poem itself, photography is rooted in an ‘insane’ logic of extension, serialization, and proliferation; of the clipping, the sample, and the specimen; of overflow and heterogeneity, since everything in it is cut out, captured, or ‘picked up,’ without the electio that had always governed the image and was the basis of what might be called its softness or sweetness [douceur]. Henceforth, as Mallarmé writes in 1894:\n\n26Photography may be seen as a complete inversion of Platonism, not just because it contradicts the scalar conception of reality; not just because the image becomes an instrument of truth, whereas, for the Socrates of the Republic, it was merely a simulacrum; not just because it abolishes the opposition of essence and appearance; but ultimately because it shows us, even more fundamentally, that light makes it possible to understand the world not by dispelling the darkness of matter and the images associated with it, but, on the contrary, by the burning and blackening it causes in the photosensitive coating of the photographic paper or metal plate. Of course, this burning and blackening are the chemical processes of photography, but they may also be seen as its emblem. Thanks to them, knowledge and beauty know that they must henceforth pass – necessarily and contradictorily – through the dark night of a camera obscura, the dark night of images that are chaotic and refractory to vision (and even more so to reading), while knowledge and beauty are wholly confined within the horizon of the visible. They know that they must undergo the painful and frightening ordeal of recognizing the mystery and confusion that are the essence of the world, a world whose exploration is a never-ending process.\n\n27This is the lesson of those vertical photographs of ‘La Crevasse sur le Chemin du Grand Plateau’ (1862), from which everything picturesque or poetic (in the true sense of these words) has disappeared. Around the dark fissures of a crevasse ‘as wide and deep as an abyss,’ off-center and oblique, the men, who look like shadows or anonymous shapes in dangerous positions, seem to be made of the same material as the chasms of the glacier onto which they are awkwardly and dangerously grafted: here there is no specific essence, no interiority giving rise to empathy, no suprasensuous purpose, no triumphant idea, and no participation in a divine order that does not exist. In these fissures and on this clinamen, men and their images are not ‘an empire within an empire,’ for they display the same precariousness as things and bodies, and their recorded traces, in a suspended moment of time that is itself absolutely fragile."
