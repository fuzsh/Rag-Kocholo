        "text": "Which of these books looks more interesting? On the left, \"The adventures of a woman who sets out to discover men, and discovers them thoroughly\" - boy, that does not sound like the sort of thing I read. And what's up with the perspective of those balconies?\n\nOn the right, what's that? Maybe it's a Surrealist novel, or some Weimar decadence. How does Penguin describe it? \"An influential novelist's shocking tale of sexual deception draws readers into the bedrooms and boudoirs of a French château in a compelling exploration of desire and sexual intrigue.\" Wow, how dull (and, it turns out, inaccurate). I'll go back to the first one.\n\nThe punchline is obivous, right, that they're the same novel, Théophile Gautier's Mademoiselle de Maupin (1835), written at the age of 24 by that dandified Bohemian on the left. It's a dirty-book classic, in at least two scenes actually kind of steamy. There's some fairly direct Lesbian stuff. One of the women is disguised as the world's most beautiful man, but the reader knows the score. I mean, it's not Zane, but Mademoiselle de Maupin is one of the reasons \"French literature\" became associated with dirty books.\n\nHow about Chapter IX, from a letter by the novel's hero, D'Albert, which begins:\n\n\"It is so. I love a man, Silvio. I long sought to delude myself; I gave a different name to the feeling that I experienced; I clothed it in the garment of pure and disinterested friendship... but I now recognize the profound and terrible road to which I am pledged.\"\n\nBy the end of the letter D'Albert has realized that the man he loves is actually a woman in disguise, so Gautier does not pursue the idea all the way to it's end. But still, 1835! The obscenity trials of Madame Bovary and The Flowers of Evil are more than twenty years later. Mademoiselle de Maupin never ran into that sort of trouble.\n\nOne reason why: the entire novel is an elaborate gag, an explication of an aesthetic theory. None of its surface is meant to be taken quite seriously. It's, I say, it's a joke, son, a funny. I'll try to write about that tomorrow."
