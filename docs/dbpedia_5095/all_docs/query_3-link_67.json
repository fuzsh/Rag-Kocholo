How do the representations of food, fashion, le chic, la laïcité, strikes, colonialism and post-colonialism, etc., in contemporary novels and films still define France today?\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: OPT\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN222 Love and Loss in Medieval and Early Modern French Literature and Culture\n\nThe interconnected themes of love and loss encompass others such as desire, passion, friendship, death, separation, and grief. This course introduces students to the uses of these themes in French literature of the medieval and early modern periods by reading a range of texts, from the courtly romance and lyric poetry, to the essay, the novella, and theater. We will examine how men and women treat these themes, and we will be especially sensitive to the ways in which women write in genres traditionally dominated by men. Topics of study will include the body, virtues and vices, marriage, sexuality, seduction, chastity, and violence. We will also place emphasis on improving French pronunciation and on developing oral presentation and written skills. Readings, papers, and discussions will be in French.\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: A-F\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nIdentical With: COL217, MDST220\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN223 French Way(s)\n\nWhat are \"French\" ways? What is important to the French, and how do they view themselves? What do they think about issues facing their country, Europe, and the world at large? What relationship does France have with the francophone world? What does it even mean to be \"French?\" Students in this course will explore these questions by examining a variety of materials including the press, comic strips, films, music, vlogs, television and radio broadcasts, and other selected readings. This course is designed for highly motivated students with a firm foundation in French who wish to refine their skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing while gaining more insight into French life and culture.\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: A-F\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN224 Cultural Mo(uve)ments from the 19th to 21st Centuries\n\nThe purpose of this course is to familiarize students with movements such as romanticism, realism, surrealism, and the Nouveau Roman, to name a few. Some of these movements stem directly from the political context, while others seem to have grown almost organically. Though the course will primarily rely on literary texts, it will also examine the \"passerelles\" between literature, music, and painting.\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: OPT\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN226 From the Diary to the Graphic Novel, Women Writers from the 17th to the 21st Centuries\n\nWhile women in France were for a long time not welcomed in the literary sphere, they have nonetheless participated in the various movements that have affected literature from the 17th century on. The purpose of this course is to discuss women's space within the literary field. Through the study of various texts, this course will examine women's compliance and defiance towards literary trends. Far from only writing diaries and fairy tales, French women writers have considerably expanded their presence in genres that seemed resolutely closed to them.\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: A-F\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN227 Trailblazing French Women in Science, Food, and the Arts\n\nOne could argue that all fields are mined for women, but certain domains are more closed than others. Such is the case for \"haute\" cuisine, haute couture, cinema, and the political sphere among others. This course seeks to examine the destiny of a group of women who established themselves in spaces traditionally reserved for men. Besides retracing and discussing their work, we will examine the discrimination they suffered and their strategies to overcome the norms. Finally, we will study the representations which were or are made of them through texts, articles, and films. These women include known figures such as Simone de Beauvoir and Marie Curie, but also others like the artist Annette Messager, the cook Hélène Darroze, the designer Coco Chanel, and more.\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: A-F\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nIdentical With: FGSS229\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN228 Fight like the French: Debates, Quarrels and Polemics in French Culture\n\nIn the age of \"fake news\" and polarization, knowing how to debate is essential. The French are notoriously practiced in debate; the importance of public opinion and the figure of the public intellectual have made French society as a whole particularly prone to the agonistic discussion of ideas. This course will survey foundational aesthetic and political debates in French culture from the 15th century to this day, focusing on those that were led by writers, philosophers, and intellectuals and that have entered French literary and cultural history. The course will show how controversies mark and make paradigmatic changes in the cultural landscape, advancing the arts and sciences and voicing political dissent. Throughout the course we will read literary works, treatises, letters, and newspapers.\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: OPT\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nIdentical With: MDST229\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN229 What Can the Middle Ages Teach Us About Nature?\n\nToday nature is at the center of our preoccupations. This course will go back to a time before human beings thought they were the masters of nature, when nature was at the same time teaching and allegory, metaphor and science. We will explore the different functions of nature in bestiaries, poems, romances, and herbaria from the Middle Ages to the beginning of the Early-Modern period (in modern French translation). We will be able to see a real herbarium in the Special Collections & Archives. Students will also visit the Davison Center for the Arts and the Joe Webb Peoples Museum to explore visual representations of nature as well as scientific displays. During the semester, students will put together a herbarium that will be displayed in an exhibition at the end of the semester.\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: A-F\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nIdentical With: MDST227, ENVS229\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN230 Knights, Fools, and Lovers: An Introduction to Medieval and Renaissance French Culture\n\nThe study of history and past literature provides intellectual, psychological and emotional resources that make one more resilient in adapting to new circumstances, enable one to see new possibilities of being-in-the-world, and provide new capacities for self-understanding. A knowledge of the European past, moreover, can be an advantage for people seeking to study, live, or work in Europe. This course will help students develop those resources and knowledge through a study of various forms of short fiction and poetry from the French Middle Ages and the Renaissance (12th-16th centuries). We will focus on the representations of human relations, above all romantic relations and their inherent conflicts of power, in these works. We will also view a couple of historical films in order to develop our visual imagination.\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: A-F\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nIdentical With: MDST257\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN231 By Sword, By Cross, and By Pen: An Introduction to Early Modern French Literature and Culture\n\nThis course introduces French literature and culture from the 15th to the 17th centuries, when the French territory expanded to its present borders with the rise of the French monarchy. Historical developments include religious upheaval and civil war, overseas exploration and conquest, and the greater dissemination of written works with the invention of the printing press. In this evolving context we will read a variety of literary works of prose and poetry. We will follow the emergence of genres such as the essay and the novel, and observe how different literary forms served to express ideas ranging from personal experiences to sociopolitical aspects of contemporary society. Several film representations of this period will also help us consider how we envision the past.\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: OPT\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN232 French Society in Music From the Roaring Twenties to Today\n\nMusic has kept the beat of French history through its ordinary and extraordinary chapters. How has music supported France's cultural power and interacted with its external influences? How do songs guard dominant narratives or rally people under revolutionary banners of protest? Over the course of the semester, we will explore music (and its multimodal nature) as a site of cultural expression and a means of understanding social and political movements of modern French society over the last 100 years.\n\nIn the first part of this course, we will situate the music of artists such as Josephine Baker, Edith Piaf, Boris Vian, and Serge Gainsbourg in relation to major 20th-century events, from post-World War I Annés folles to May '68. We will consider how songs engage political events and discover the ways in which music shapes and is being shaped by its society. The second part of the course focuses on contemporary music of French expression (Indochine, Orelsan, Yseult, Angèle, Stromae) as related to questions of gender and sexuality, the legacy of decolonization, immigration, technology, and consumerism. Listening to the voices of France and its \"others,\" we will examine expressions of belonging and alienation within a society that constantly reinvents itself while endeavoring to preserve its \"inherent\" characteristics. Close readings of lyrics paired with historical contextualization will be supplemented with theoretical and literary texts, excerpts from films and documentaries, posters, and photography.\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: A-F\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN233 French and Francophone Gastronomy\n\nThis course explores the variety of French and Francophone gastronomy through texts, recipes, and other media such as films and cooking shows. Through these materials, students will reflect on the relationship between food and culture and the shape it takes in French and Francophone cultures. They will develop a deeper knowledge and appreciation for various foods and dishes.\n\nThe course will include a hands-on component through which students will cook and taste foods from various areas in the Francophone world. The course will culminate in a final public event during which students will introduce and share foods from the Francophone world, which attendees will have the opportunity to taste.\n\nThis course is a CLAC course conducted entirely in French. In addition to weekly meetings, there will be a few cooking workshops. Grade will be based on class participation, weekly reflection journals, a final presentation, and a final paper.\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: A-F\n\nCredits: 0.50\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nIdentical With: CGST226\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN234 Francophone Belgian Culture\n\nThe Kingdom of Belgium gained its independence from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands after the Belgian revolution of 1830 and has since then developed as one of the central powers of the European Union, of which it was a founding member and whose principal institutions are located in the Belgian capitol, Brussels. The kingdom contains four linguistic regions: Dutch-speaking Flanders, French-speaking Wallonia, German-speaking Eupen-Malmedy, and bilingual (French-Dutch) Brussels. This course will study the development of Francophone Belgian culture since the mid-20th century. We will focus on authors like Georges Simenon, Marguerite Yourcenar, Jean Bofane, Joseph Ndwaniye, Amélie Nothomb, Nicolas Ancion, and Bernard Quiriny; musicians like Toots Thielemans, Jacques Brel, Cecile Kayirebwa, Princesse Mansia M'Bila, Dieudonné Kabongo, Zap Mama, Hooverphonic, Stromae, Damso, Romeo Elvis, and Angèle; and cineastes like Chantal Akerman, Jaco Van Dormael, Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, Lucas Belvaux and Bouli Lanners. The course will also include a unit on the well-known bandes dessinées (comic books) created by Belgian authors and artists, like Herge (Tintin), Morris et Goscinny (Lucky Luke), Jean Van Hamme (Thorgal, XIII, Largo Winch), Hermann (Jeremiah), and Spenale (Wonder Pony).\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: A-F\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN236 Going South: \"Le Sud\" and Its Representations in French Literature and Culture\n\nThe course explores representations of \"le Sud\" across media, from myths and legends to songs, literature, film, and television. We will learn the origins of Provençal identity and how its portrayal has evolved over time. We will gain a greater knowledge of the many artists and thinkers who have been drawn to the South. Eventually, we will work out a new definition of \"le Sud,\" from Provence to one that includes other Souths such as the global South represented by immigrants from former French colonies.\n\nAlthough a geographical denomination, a cardinal point, \"le Sud\" is a contradictory and moving space. The French anthem was first sung on one of Marseille's streets (rue Thubaneau), and the city remains a cosmopolitan port, open to migrations. The 2005 riots did not affect Marseille, yet the first elected mayors from the far-right Front National were in Orange, Toulon, and Vitrolles. The South remains a place of light and sun that attracted numerous painters and a place of dark and shady business run by local and international mafias. How have these contradictions shaped \"le Sud\" as territory, community, and idea, and how do they function within definitions of French identity?\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: A-F\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN238 Representing the Self, Representing Yourself\n\nIn our digital age, with the pervasiveness of Facebook, Instagram, and other forms of social media, what can testimony do? What stories are told? How are they told? What do they mean? How do writers, artists, musicians, intellectuals, and politicians represent themselves? As students, how can you give your memories material substance? How do others' narratives influence the way you interpret your own being? In this course, we will begin to answer these questions by reading, watching, and examining a vast selection of French and Francophone texts, films, and images that recount the self from the Middle Ages to today. There will be a particular focus on queer people, women, and people of color, and how they negotiate difference and alterity in their work. Throughout the course, you will also journal your own experiences and imitate other writers' modes of expression (e.g., memoires, autobiographies, autofiction, the graphic novel, film, documentary, theater, poetry, music, photography). The course will culminate in the creation of your own story, which will in turn prepare you to think critically about the world around you and how to tell your story in interesting, creative, and provocative ways. We will also place emphasis on improving French pronunciation and on developing oral presentation and written skills. Readings, papers, and discussions will be in French.\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: A-F\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN239 A Virtual Semester in Paris\n\nThis course will introduce students to different aspects of life in Paris.

We will read four plays and view a selection of films, along with commentary by directors, playwrights, and actors on their craft. Coursework will focus on the development of literary and visual analysis, the acquisition of terminology related to theater and film, and the appreciation of these two art forms in their past and current contexts.\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: A-F\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN241 Seeing Is Believing?: The Search for Cinematic Truth\n\nThe French director Jean-Luc Godard once remarked that, \"Cinema is the truth 24 times per second.\" Godard refers here to an interplay between truth, time, and the mechanics of film. But does cinema really show us the truth? What kind of reality is it able to capture and how does \"truth\" relate to its means of representation? This course examines how Francophone film treats the relationship of cinema to truth, covering aspects of film history, theory, and its technical construction. The course is organized around four main areas of inquiry: we first consider the role fantasy and spectacle in the early films from Georges Méliès and the Lumière Brothers, before exploring how cinema re-orients its relationship to the \"real\" via social realism and the experimental documentary style of the French New Wave. We then discover how cinematic \"truth\" is reclaimed by filmmakers outside of France, before finally turning to the highly-aestheticized, non-narrative films of \"Cinéma du look.\"\n\nThis course will familiarize students with the basics of film analysis and critique, while also providing a foundation in the technical aspects of cinema and how it has evolved as both an art and a science. Each film will be accompanied by readings, and the theoretical framework of the course will derive from André Bazin's Qu'est-ce que le cinéma? and excerpts from Gilles Deleuze's Cinéma II: L'Image-temps. For their final project, students may submit either a traditional research paper or an original film project that engages with cinematic theories and techniques discussed over the course of the semester.\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: A-F\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN254 Paris to Saigon: French Representations of Asia\n\nThe course explores the ways in which French explorers, writers, and artists traveled to Asian countries, such as Japan, China, and Vietnam, in the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries and represented \"Extrême-Orient,\" a Eurocentric designation. Attentive analysis of their works will allow us to question the colonial construction of the Far East as \"other\"; examine Asian influences on cultural, aesthetic, and literary expressions; and discuss Asian presence in postcolonial France. Issues such as orientalization, eroticization, and hybridization of genres and identities will be the subjects of our study.\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: A-F\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN273 The Business of Letters: The French Epistolary Novel\n\nBefore the 18th century, the first-person narrative was often perceived as self-indulgent, not to mention distasteful. Eighteenth-century readers, however, became fascinated with the intimacy, immediacy, realism, and confessional aspect of highly charged first-person perspectives. It comes as no surprise, then, that this was the golden age of the ROMAN EPISTOLAIRE, the novel composed entirely of letters. In this class we will read a number of epistolary novels that allowed for the development of highly subjective, and often challenging, points of view. Sample works include Madame de Graffigny's critique of European society (LETTRES D'UNE PERUVIENNE), Mme de Charriere's praise of female independence (LETTRES DE MISTRISS HENLEY), Montesquieu's political satire of French life (LETTRES PERSANES), and Laclos's tale of seduction and aristocratic libertinage (LES LIAISONS DANGEREUSES). We will also read one example of the epistolary novel's stylistic counterpart, the ROMAN-MEMOIRE.\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: OPT\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN275 Histories of Race: Science and Slavery in an Age of Enlightenment\n\nThe concept of race was first \"invented\" during the 18th century by anatomists, natural historians, and, ultimately, the century's classifiers. This class will come to grips with the birth of this concept in two ways. First, we will read excerpts from travelogues to Africa and the Caribbean (as well as short excerpts from natural history) in order to chart the slow and halting creation of the concept of race as it crystallized in European thought during the 18th century. Having studied this \"proto-raciology,\" the class will then examine 16 unpublished manuscripts that were submitted to a contest on the source of \"blackness\" organized by the Bordeaux Royal Academy of Sciences in 1739. These include essays submitted by priests, anatomists, and partisans of climate theory. Students in this class will actively engage with these materials by producing glossary definitions that will be published along with the entire collection of essays. The ultimate goal of this course is to provide students with an understanding of the concept of race that will inform their reactions to this question as both a historical concept . . . and an ongoing problem that affects all of us in the present.\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: A-F\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: SBS-RLAN\n\nIdentical With: COL281\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN281 French and Francophone Theater in Performance\n\nThis course introduces students to the richness of the French and Francophone dramatic repertories, on the one hand, and, on the other, invites them to discover acting techniques (such as movement, physicalization, memorization, mise en scène, and so forth). Students will thus put their language skills into motion, and the course will culminate in a public performance at the end of the semester.

We will become familiar with a French king and the signatory of the Code Noir (Louis XIV), the Swedish inventor of the term Homo sapiens (Linnaeus), the theorist of human degeneration from a white prototype (Buffon), the most famous philosopher of the eighteenth century (Voltaire), the theorist of human stage theory (Robertson), a skull-measuring naturalist (Blumenbach), and an American president, in Thomas Jefferson. The class will also examine 16 manuscripts that were submitted to a contest on the source of \"blackness\" organized by the Bordeaux Royal Academy of Sciences in 1739. The goal of this course is to provide students with an understanding of the origins of race that will inform their reactions to this question as both a historical concept, and an ongoing problem that affects all of us in the present.\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: A-F\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: SBS-RLAN\n\nIdentical With: SISP303\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN302 West African Literatures and Cultures in French\n\nThis course explores major texts in modern and contemporary Francophone African literature by delving into four major themes that traverse the recent cultural, literary, and political history of Francophone West Africa.\n\nThe course starts by investigating the relationships between orality and literature through the lens of often-intersecting debates around tradition and modernity; the focus will then shift to articulations of nation, liberation, and the promises of independence, war, and memory, and finally the ruptures and continuities of the post-colonial, neoliberal present.\n\nBy spending significant time with primary sources that span over a century of literary and cultural production from and about Francophone Africa, students will have a deep understanding of the urgencies animating writers wrestling with the weight of the colonial past, the violence of decolonization, the brightness of independence, and the uncertainty of the present. A thorough engagement with some of the most important authors of the 60 years--C. H. Kane, B. Diop, Y. Ouloguem, M. Condé, among others--will allow us to deep-dive into the possibilities of literary expression as well as questions of belonging, nation, and evolving ideas of \"Africa.\"\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: A-F\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nIdentical With: RL&L302\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN304 The Art of the Essay\n\nThis is both a creative writing and literature seminar, a hybrid experience where students will read some of the most momentous and important examples of the essay genre while simultaneously producing their own interpretative compositions. We will read essays by Montaigne (who covered a myriad of subjects) before moving onto later authors from the French and Francophone world (e.g., Baudelaire, Voltaire, Césaire, Cixous) who gravitated to this open and highly personal way of writing to further their own artistic or ideological positions.\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: A-F\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN305 Negotiating French Identity: Migration and Identity in Contemporary France\n\nWith the largest minority in France being of Maghrebi origin, Islam has become the second largest religion in France today.

What do members of the growing Franco-Maghrebi community add to the ongoing dialogue surrounding France's republican and secular identity?

The tragedies that emerged from these bloody conflicts--many of which staged physical violence--not only reflected but also actively participated in the debates surrounding the 'troubles civils.' In this advanced seminar, we will study such tragedies in order to examine the uses, functions, and ethics of spectacular violence, in plays that adapt mythological stories (e.g., Medea), religious narratives (e.g. David and Goliath, Saint Cecilia), and current events (e.g., executions, assassinations, and regicides) for the stage. We will read the plays alongside and against the competing theoretical frameworks of violence found in various poetic treatises of the time period, yet we will also keep in mind the practical constraints and conditions of performance in early modern France. Finally, we will reflect on why we should read these plays today and how they inform our contemporary moment.

It is designed to encourage students to question prevalent stereotypes and controversial contemporary issues related to the region.\n\nThroughout the course, students will examine various topics such as migration, ethnic and social segregation, economic growth, safety, the environment, housing, transportation, urban planning, metropolization, education, and culture. By using Marseille as a case study, students will reflect on the notion of scale in the context of French and European governance.\n\nStudents will engage with a range of materials, including novels, short stories, graphic novels, journalistic investigations, films, archival footage, and testimonials from residents, association representatives, experts, and researchers. Additionally, the course will include a comparative analysis with Paris, other French cities, and Mediterranean regions.\n\nBy the end of the course, students will gain a deeper understanding of the region's place in French politics, society, and culture, while also developing critical thinking, research, and analytical skills.\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: A-F\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN309 Writing Childhood in Contemporary French Literature\n\nIn the 20th century, children's literature and writings about childhood expanded alongside commercial book publishing, greater literacy, and theories on childhood. This course will follow the development of formal and creative expressions of childhood by turning first toward children's literature, including picture and comic books and classic works such as \"Le Petit Prince.\" Literary depictions of childhood, as memory, testimony, and social commentary, will compose the second half of the course. Visual imagery (book illustrations, films) will be studied as well to consider the connections between childhood and its representations--for example, how children's literature reflects modernity and how childhood is a means to make sense of adulthood.\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: OPT\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN310 French Crowds, Mobs, and Mobilities\n\nUnder the date of 14th July 1789, Louis XVI entered in his diary but one word: \"Rien.\" That day, a crowd of sans-culottes flooded the streets of Paris, overwhelmed the guards, and captured the Bastille. What the king could not foresee is the political power of a mob, a \"foule,\" deriving its etymology and strength from the pressure of thousands of feet pounding the pavement. From this founding event on, the building of the French nation could be read as a history of mobile crowds kept alive today in yearly student and union demonstrations. How does \"rien\" become the emblematic event of French national identity? What moves a crowd, and what does a crowd move? What do such gatherings accomplish, and how do they form in France and why? Can governments bring crowds to a stop? What does immobility mean for the French?\n\nDrawing on French sociology and literature, this course will explore the influence that crowds have exerted on French politics, society, and aesthetics. We will discuss the power of numbers by focusing on major events in French history from the 18th century to contemporary France: the French Revolution, the Paris Commune, May 1968, the 1983 March for Equality and Against Racism, the Yellow Vests, and the COVID-19 lockdowns. Students will be encouraged to relate the course to their own experience of mobile crowds, in concerts or sports events, on more quotidian moves such as commuting, and to draw comparisons across time and space.\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: A-F\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN312 Clandestins, Sans-Papiers, Migrant/e/s: 100 Years of Illegalization in the Francophone Mediterranean\n\nWho is illegal, and why? When did \"migrating illegally\" across the Mediterranean start, and how? How did we come to think about certain ways of moving across borders as a criminal act?\n\nUsing sources and literature on and about empire, borders, citizenship, seafaring, smuggling, and human rights, the course will attempt to answer these questions in the specific context of the Francophone Mediterranean, intended here as a space of migration much broader than the sea itself.\n\nWe will read about Algerian workers hidden in the hull of steamships at the turn of the century, watch Tunisian border policemen helplessly patrol an endless stretch of desert in a sandstorm, and read from \"illegal\" Africans seeking refuge inside the church of St. Bernard, in Northern Paris, in the hot summer of 1986, before police broke in.\n\nThrough this heterogenous set of encounters, students will be able to explore, engage critically, and respond to some of the discursive, legal, and logistical devices that made and still make people on the move \"illegal\" in contemporary France and in the long wake of its colonial empire.\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: A-F\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN314 From the Diary to the Graphic novel, Women Writers from the 17th to the 21st Centuries\n\nWhile women in France were for a long time not welcomed in the literary sphere, they have nonetheless participated in the various movements that have affected literature from the 17th century on. The purpose of this course is to discuss women's space within the literary field. Through the study of various texts, this course will examine women's compliance and defiance towards literary trends. Far from only writing diaries and fairy tales, French women writers have considerably expanded their presence in genres that seemed resolutely closed to them.\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: A-F\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN315 The Politics of the French Language and the Birth of the French State\n\nToday, the advantages of national borders and monolinguistic language policies are being trumpeted all across the world. And yet, the study of premodern languages and literatures reveals that the history of national languages has always been a multicultural affair. In this course, we will look at the case of the French language, particularly the establishment of French as a literary language through strategies of legitimization. Starting with an examination of the first text written in the language that would later become French, from the 9th century, we will then go on to study (in modern French) a series of medieval and early-modern poems, plays, treatises and essays that borrow from other languages and literatures, even as they establish French as a literary and a national language. The final portion of this class will include a meditation on the status of French language in contemporary Francophone countries based on Derrida's essay \"Le monolinguisme de l'autre.\"\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: OPT\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nIdentical With: MDST315\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN316 Women Writing in the Renaissance\n\nWomen writing in 16th-century France--the French Renaissance period--had the recent advantage of print publication to circulate their works despite great social limitations on women's roles and education. This course explores their writing--including fiction, poetry, epistolary, and polemic--and choices of subject matter with a focus on references to writing as/by women. We will situate these writers in their historical, cultural, and literary environments and read critical scholarship on this field of study. We will also take a comparative approach by looking at 15th- and 17th-century authorship to see how circumstances evolved and at several contemporary perspectives to consider the currency and perhaps continuity of early modern women's literary production and creations.\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: A-F\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN317 The New World Bites Back: Cannibalism and the Colonial Encounter\n\nWhat is the cannibal?

This advanced seminar will compare and contrast styles of expedition and conquest among the European nations, though the course will focus on the French context and the various events and encounters that occurred in the early modern Americas, particularly between 1492 and 1610, a period that laid the groundwork for the subsequent colonial project. Throughout the course, we will pay special attention to the Amerindians' points of view. In turn, students will examine the insights and blind spots in 16th-century French navigators', cosmographers', cartographers', and intellectuals' interpretations, representations, and negotiations of difference by critically engaging with concepts such as nature, culture, alterity, gender, sexuality, marriage, religion, exchange, possession, conquest, and war.

Although these influences from Asia were at times the fruit of solid knowledge, they were also often the result of imagination. In addition to attracting French intellectuals and artists, Asia also contributed very concretely to the economic development of modern France and its geopolitical position in the world. This relationship relied on voluntary exchanges but also on violence and French exploitation of Asian territories and people. Through the study of historical documents, films, and literary texts, this course aims to understand the various ways Asia shaped France. We will consider the various representations of Asia conveyed in 19th- and 20th-century France and the historical context of their production by focusing on key moments such as the Opium Wars in China, French colonialism in Indochina, and the two world wars.

Many of the most-recognized names in the art world were active there during that time: Debussy, Monet, Picasso, Stravinsky, Matisse, Baudelaire, Van Gogh...and many of them collaborated across media. In this course, we'll dig deep into the music, visual arts, and literature of the period, relying on contemporaneous primary sources (literature, of course, but also newspapers and popular periodicals, artists' letters and manifestos, performance reviews and notes, etc) as well as relevant secondary analyses, to get a sense of the competing energies of liberation and decadence that nourished so many remarkable and influential works of art.\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: OPT\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN356 From the Diary to the Stage: Women Writers and Literary Genres from the 17th to the 21st Centuries\n\nWhile women in France were not welcomed in the literary sphere, they have nonetheless participated in the various movements that have radically affected literature from the 17th century on.

In this course, we will examine the various roles of photography in autobiography. Is photography a way to trigger memory? Is it more referential than the word? How is the reader to read the coexistence of word and image?

While in Bourges, these actors performed a variety of different kinds of plays, including tragedies, comedies, tragicomedies, pastorals, and farces. Although these performances were often met with hostility from the city's religious authorities, Drummond attended several plays during his stay and, lucky for us, took rather detailed notes about them. His observations from the 1607 \"season\" are preserved in his personal papers in the National Library of Scotland.\n\nThis course will use Drummond's notes as a guide to discover and examine other forms of evidence--both traditional and nontraditional--that help us understand what was at stake in theater, performance, and (un)popular culture in late 16th- and early 17th-century France. We will study the ways the past has been organized and cataloged, how traditional sources and research have shaped our view of the past, and how unconventional methodologies can help us locate new sites of knowledge and culture.

We will then move onto his famous 74,000 article Encyclopédie, a book that not only dragged sacrilege and freethinking out into the open, but triggered a decades-long scandal that involved the Sorbonne, the Paris Parliament, the King, and the Pope. (During this portion of the class, students will undertake translations of select entries [from French to English] of the \"dictionnaire\" for possible publication.) In the second half of the semester, we will also study the writer's freewheeling art criticism. Finally, we will read two groundbreaking novels. The first of these, \"La Religieuse\", is a gripping pseudo-memoir of a nun who suffers unspeakably cruel abuse after she announces that she wants to leave her convent. The second, \"Jacques le Fataliste\", is a freewheeling anti-novel where Diderot used fiction to take up the problem of free will.

Students will also watch 20th- and 21st-century film and theatrical adaptations of selected works. By the end of the course, students will have acquired an appreciation for a central but often neglected dimension of francophone literature and culture, become familiar with a method combining a historical approach with the use of essential theoretical concepts, explored how attention to noncanonical and/or \"nonliterary\" material can extend their knowledge of the period, and provided evidence of competence in critical reading and in the presentation of independent research.\n\nOffering: Host\n\nGrading: A-F\n\nCredits: 1.00\n\nGen Ed Area: HA-RLAN\n\nPrereq: None\n\nFREN399 French Histories: National Identity and Narratives since the Third Republic\n\nAt the end of the nineteenth century, schooling became free and mandatory in France. Since then, politicians have often considered the teaching of history as key to the construction of French national identity. Even today, some argue that the role of school is to equip children with a national narrative. French historians have questioned and resisted this instrumentalization, denouncing oversimplifications and ideological distortions. They also acknowledge that some biases have pervaded French history.\n\nThrough readings of historical novels, biographies, essays, and graphic novels as well as selected film and documentary viewings, this course will explore some of these national narratives and the way French historians, philosophers, and artists have participated in the construction of a French national identity.\n\nThe course will focus on France and its colonies since the 1870's and the Third Republic. Preliminary knowledge of the period is not required for this class. The final project will be a re-telling of a French historical event through students' preferred medium (video, graphic novel, essay, or podcast).
