        "text": "First published in 1915, this volume contains Theophile Gautier's biography of the French poet, art critic, and essayist Charles Pierre Baudelaire (1821-1867). Baudelaire's wonderful poems are known for their masterful use of rhyme and rhythm which, together with their Romantic exoticism, inspired a whole generation of poets including Arthur Rimbaud, Paul Verlaine and Stephane Mallarme. In \"Charles Baudelaire - His Life\", Gautier provides a detailed sketch of Baudelaire's life and memoirs together with some of his best poetry and notable correspondence, offering a unique glimpse into the life and work of one of France's most influential writers. Contents include: \"Charles Pierre Baudelaire\", \"The Life and Intimate Memoirs of Charles Baudelaire, by Theophile Gautier\", \"Selected Poems of Charles Baudelaire\", \"Little Poems in Prose\", and \"Correspondence of Baudelaire\". Pierre Jules Theophile Gautier (1811-1872) was a French dramatist, poet, journalist, novelist, and critic. A vocal proponent of Romanticism, he was held in high esteem by many great writers including Wilde, Flaubert, Balzac, Eliot, and many others. Notable works by this author include: \"La Comedie de la Mort\" (1838), \"Une Larme du Diable\" (1839), and \"Le Pied de Momie\" (1840). Ragged Hand is proudly republishing this classic work now complete with a specially commissioned new biography of the author."
