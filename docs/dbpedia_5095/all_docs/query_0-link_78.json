        "text": "Lolita, light and fire of my bookshelves\n\nThis already old novel (1955!) has made its way to the pantheon of the world most celebrated literature, despite its controversial nature, and continues to draw the attention of a constant number of readers throughout the world.\n\nThe prose of Nabokov alone is enkough to fall under the spell of his witty text, but the charm of the novel is decupled by the amount of cultural references, symbolic images – and let’s not forget its humour! Also, Nabokov, as he admitted, left a riddle-game for the benefit of the deserving reader (although made for his own satisfaction): Lolita’s riddle.\n\nHow many new readers realize the richness of what they have between their hands? Nabokov’s sophisticated playful mind left enough dark matter for curious minds to ponder and delve into it sixty years later.\n\nWe would think that such a scrutinized book would have given up its soul long ago, but we would be wrong. Secrets still lie within shadows hidden between the lines. Despite the cleverness and thickness of literary references of Alfred Appel’s « The Annotated Lolita« , one can’t help thinking something’s missing. Some recurring (and sometimes almost out of place) elements in the book seem to beg for attention, and yet they’re left ignored and mute with their untold secrets.\n\nHere’s a big part of what I have gathered. The work of collection of the references is far from complete I believe (there are even references behind references).\n\nNabokov, as he admitted it, had hidden a riddle-game left for the benefit of the deserving reader. Lolita’s riddle.\n\nIn an interview in 1962 for the BBC when asked on why he wrote “Lolita”: “(…) I’ve no general ideas to exploit, I just like composing riddles with elegant solutions.”. Two years later, in an interview with Playboy in 1964, about the writing of « Lolita », he confessed « She was like the composition of a beautiful puzzle – its composition and its solution at the same time, since one is mirror view of the other, depending on the way you look. ».\n\nThe basic core of the riddle is now, I believe, mostly solved (even though there are still much to say about it. And there is also still MUCH to discover. It’s still a raw sketch in a way) and I propose to my reader to take a trip in the depth of « Lolita », a novel that you had read without knowing that there was a « phantom chapter », only deciphered by a careful scrutiny of the text, allowing to reach a second level of reading.\n\nIn order to say that we resolved Lolita’s riddle we have to find a solution that addresses efficiently all the persistent references and mysterious recurring elements (numbers and words). And of course, it must work in every instances.\n\nIn order to lead us to his intended hidden goal, Nabokov has « sprinkled » his text with hints hidden in « plain sight ». The solution of the puzzle has to be reached by collecting all the specific references and keywords left by the author. The similar nature of these references won’t leave any room for doubts and the possibility of a conjunction of coincidences will be safely discarded.\n\nThere are direct references, but there are also sometimes references behind references, multi-references on one « textual object », and cross-references all pointing directly or indirectly to the same direction (the synesthetic Nabokov was by nature particularly used to experience things embedded within things, where they were not supposed to be)).\n\nThese hints, left by Nabokov, are basically « tags » which are either recurring dates or recurring words. These dates and keywords can be rattached to a specific context that we recognize as omnipresent when we have identified it.\n\nOnce this context is identified, the key is known.\n\nEvery time you use the key (the sesame to a subjacent level of reading) in a textual keyhole (there are moments in the text when there are salliant mentions: a strange book title, a weird lastname or any sort of incongruity – this is Nabokov nudging and winking to you), it opens and more is to be seen, confirming each time even more that the puzzle has been solved.\n\nIn fact the key can basically be reduced to one name. One person. With this name, all the rest follows.\n\nAnd when we know this key, we realize that the solution of the riddle had been ostensibly agitated by Humbert (Or more exactly Vladimir Nabokov) right in front of our unsuspecting eyes.\n\nThis key « with its numbered dangler of carved wood« , bearing the number 342.\n\n[From now on, all the page numbers tagged TAL are a reference to Alfred Appel’s « The Annotated Lolita »]\n\nI shall not exist if you do not imagine me\n\nThe beginning of the story is set on La Côte d’Azur (more precisely, probably Monaco – a principality by the sea). This latter allusion is made in reference to Egar Allan Poe‘s (1809-1849) poem « Annabel Lee« , and indeed, the beginning of « Lolita » is full of references to this work: for instance, Humbert’s love is named Annabel Leigh (like Poe’s Annabel Lee), there are direct alluions to the poem (« the misinformed, simple, noble-winged seraphs, envied » p.9 TAL, even his use of the spelling “lo-LEE-ta” seems to be a discreet allusion to the character of the poem). In Nabokov’s mind, these Poe allusions are directly linked to the fact this famous American author was in love with Virginia Clemm, a thirteen years old girl (even the date when Humbert stops searching for Lolita, on 09/18/49 is also a reference to Edgar Allan Poe and his « Annabel Lee » (but in reality, Nabokov’s intent is to allude to Lorina Liddell – more on this later)).\n\nAs this is a Nabokov Novel there are also many allusions to butterflies (the powdered Vanessa Van Ness (a vaness is a colorful butterfly and butterflies have « powder » on their body), miss Phalen (French “phalène” (= moth)), Falter (German for “butterfly”), schmetterling (german for “butterfly”), Avis Chapman (named after the south-european butterfly Callopbrys avis Chapman (Chapman was a famous lepidopterist)), Edusa Gold (colias Edusa was the name of an European golden-orange butterfly), etc…). Nabokov was a fervent lepidopterist, a specialist of butterflies, insects that sometimes have the ability to deceive their observers, which is rather apt for a novel that toys with his reader and lures him more than once. And as we will see, there is also probably a little link with the riddle itself. [ To note: Butterfly names are quite often references to Greek, Roman and even Egyptian Mythology (examples for the latter: Osiris, Sphinx (which is also a reference to Greek mythology), etc…). Names/words/keywords in the novel are often references to butterfly names in English, Latin or French (a few butterfly names in French (all relevant to the riddle): Diane, Faune (faun), Driade (dryad), Miroir (mirror), Azuré, Sphinx, Damier (chessboard pattern), Tristan (Tristram), etc… ]\n\nThe constant allusions to fairy-tales and supernatural creatures is omnipresent throughout the novel (e.g. the town in which Lolita was born is name Pisky (pixie), Briceland is a reference to the legendary mysterious forest Broceliande (an Arthurian legend element), Elphinstone (elfin stone) also alludes to elves, supernatural legendary beings – to whom Humbert directly alludes, obviously nymphets, etc… Even the several reference to « haze » is there to recall a fairy tales’ general context). This supernatural fairy-tales’ context is the reflection of Humbert’s own subjective description of the situation. That’s Humbert’s constant insinuation that he was like a victim of a spell. His preaching is that there seem to exist female “demoniac” “supernatural” children that possesses the “magical” power to put a spell on older males having the required sensitivity and character disposition.\n\nSome allusions by Nabokov seem to be autobiographical. The following comment from Humbert “(…) amid a civilization which allows a man of twenty-five to court a girl of sixteen (…)” (p.18 TAL) might be a personal reference by Nabokov to his former wish to marry Svetlana Siewert, then 16, when he was himself 23, which was denied by her fiancée’s family.\n\nOther salliant bits seem to be personnal comments (More on this later).\n\nNevertheless, a non-negligible amount of these references are actually used as tags intended to lead to the solving of the riddle. I propose now to prove my point by enumerating the diverse instances, which one by one, depict a very specific context.\n\nThe sheer accumulation of concordant references will prove the nature of the riddle by knitting a net of undeniable evidences.\n\nThe coming work will be divided in two parts followed by a conclusive final chapter exposing precisely the nature of the riddle and its total correspondance to the description of his creator.\n\nAll the elements in bold have a special importance and will be almost all treated at some point.\n\nHer Alice-in-wonderland hair\n\n« I always call him Lewis Carroll Carroll because he was the first Humbert Humbert » -V. Nabokov\n\n« In common with many other English children (I was an English child) I always have been very fond of Carroll. (…) He has a pathetic affinity with Humbert Humbert but some odd scruple prevented me fom alluding in lolita to his wretched perversion and to his ambiguous photograph it took in dim rooms. He got away with it, as so many Victorians got away with pederasty and nympholepsy. His were sad scrawny little nymphets, bedraggled and half-undressed, or rather semi-undraped, as if participating in some dusty and dreadful charade. » -V. Nabokov\n\nIndeed, Nabokov didn’t allude much in overt manner to Lewis Carroll (2 or 3 direct « Alice in Wonderland » references), but he actually did it a lot more in sneaky barely recognizable ways throughout his book.\n\nNabokov obviouly did have strong certitudes on the nature of Lewis Carroll’s attachment to little girls (admittedly, with good reasons), and we will see that Lolita’s riddle is actually about this specific Carrollian context.\n\nDespite Nabokov’s conspicuous careful efforts to stand aside from Lewis Carroll in the previous quotes, the two authors do have a few common points.\n\nAs Nabokov said himself, Lewis Carroll was an old friend that accompanied him since his childhood, and we can find many mentions of Carroll and his books in Nabokov’s own novels, from books as different and distant in time as « The real Life of Sebastian Knight » (1941) or « Ada or Ardor » (1969).\n\nNabokov didn’t pursue studies in Oxford like Charles L. Dodgson (the real name of Lewis Carroll) did, but he did go to the Trinity College of Cambridge from 1919 to 1923, which is the sister college of Christ church of Oxford were the reverend Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) taught mathematics, and Vladimir Nabokov could taste a little of the atmosphere of this environment only a few decades after Carroll had left Oxford. It is also important to mention that in 1923, Nabokov did himself a translation of « Alice in Wonderland » in Russian, published in Berlin, where he was then living.\n\nWe know they shared a taste for chess, riddles [ Nabokov published verbal riddles (cf. article The condescending smile of the supreme enchanter by John Simon; I suppose we can add the use of an acrostic in Nabokov’s famous short story « The Vane Sisters« , who gives the « solution » of the story and that went unnoticed by the New Yorker to which Nabokov had submitted the text) ] and butterflies (for the latter, see the words of Mrs. Maitland, a former child-friend of Lewis Carroll: « I always attribute my love for animals to the teaching of Mr. Dodgson (a.k.a. Lewis Carroll): his stories about them, his knowledge of their lives and histories, his enthusiasm about birds and butterflies enlivened many a dull hour« ).\n\nIt is also difficult to not notice that Nabokov’s book « Poems and Problems » (notice the P/P) seem to mirror Carroll’s « Rhyme and Reason » (notice the R/R) published in 1883, even by the meanings (You need « rhymes » for your « poems » and you need « reason » to solve « problems »). Notice that in cyrillic (the Russian alphabet), R is written P.\n\nAh, yes. Carroll and Nabokov also shared a love for poetry, portmanteau words (Lewis Carroll even coined the term) and alliterations. But don’t we all?\n\nLewis Carroll (January 27, 1832 – January 14, 1898), whose real name was Charles Lutwidge Dodgson – etymologically, « Lewis » is related to « Lutwidge » and « Carroll » to « Charles » – was a young mathematical lecturer at Christ Church college in Oxford.\n\nHe soon met the family of the new dean, Henry Liddell (1811–1898) who was married to Lorina Reeve (1825-1910). It was the beginning of a long relationship with the Liddell family. It is precisely on April 25, 1856 that he saw for the first time Alice Pleasance Liddell (May 4, 1852 – November 16, 1934), that would become his favorite Liddell girl. He was quite fond of photography and he often photographed the three Liddell sisters (among the many photographs he took in his life, there is a particularly important number of little girls). He also went several times on a boat trip on the Thames with the girls to pick-nick, on which occasion he would tell a story, generally improvised to amuse the girls.\n\nIt is on such occasion that Lewis Carroll invented and told for the first time the story that would become « Alice in Wonderland« , on July 4, 1862. After this trip, Alice Liddell asked him to write down the story and eventually « Alice in Wonderland » ended up published on July 4, 1865. « Through the looking-glass« , the sequel, would follow in 1871. The relationship with the Liddell family had stopped suddenly in 1863.\n\nIn the year 1880, the reverend Dodgson, up to then a fervent amateur of photography suddenly forgo his passion. 1880 is the year Alice Liddell married and became Mrs Hargreaves. In 1881, he left Oxford and went in a girl’s school to teach logics. He saw Alice Liddell for the last time on November 1, 1888.\n\nLewis Carroll died of pneumonia in January 14, 1898, in a house, located in Guildford on castle hill, that he rented since 1868, the Chestnuts.\n\nIt is well-known that the pages of Lewis Carroll’s diaries between April 16, 1858 and May 8, 1862 are missing (a period of time running throughout the time Carroll regularly frequented the Liddell) – presumably removed by a family member after his death. This, of course, only served to amplify the suspicions about an ambiguous relationship with the Liddell, especially with Alice Liddell.\n\nThe fact that Alice’s mother burnt all the letters Lewis Carroll had sent to the little girl, tends to prove she considered his relationship with her daughter more than ambiguous as well.\n\nThere is really no doubt at all that she was the inspiration for the Alice wandering in wonderland.\n\nIt is well-known that this story was invented and told on a trip on the Thames with the three Liddell sisters, in the summer 1862, after which Alice asked carroll to write the story down.\n\nThe Liddell sisters are Prima (Lorina), secunda (Alice) and tertia (Edith) in the little introductory poem before the story.\n\nBeside the name of the eponymous heroine, the birthdate of Alice Liddell (4th of May (1852)) is alluded in the narrative itself: « perhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad » and « What day of the month is it? he said turning to Alice (…) Alice considered a little, and then said « the fourth. » « . So we have it, the 4th of May.\n\nThe three Liddell sisters are also semi-cryptically alluded in the three little (pun with « Liddell ») sisters living in the bottom of a treacle-well, in the story told by the dormouse, in « Alice in Wonderland« .\n\nTheir firstnames Elsie, Lacie and Tilly are references to the firstnames of the dean Liddell’s daughters: Elsie stands for L.C., the initials of Lorina Charlotte Liddell, Lacie is an anagram of Alice and Tilly was an affectionate nickname of Edith Liddell.\n\nThey are also present in the pool of tears’ scene (Lorina the lory, Edith the eaglet – but also the reverend Duckworth, that accompanied them on the river, as the duck and Lewis Carroll himself as the dodo (Carroll stammered and « do-do » would represent himself trying to say his name, Dodgson)).\n\nThe last line of the poem right before « Through the Looking-Glass« , i.e. « The pleasance of our fairy-tale » is a clever allusion to the middle-name of Alice Pleasance Liddell, that could mean (to the attention of the only Alice Liddell) « the Alice of our fairy-tale ».\n\nThe final poem of « Through the Looking-Glass » contains too a clear dedication to Alice Liddell, his « muse », so to speak. This poem is in fact an acrostic spelling Alice Liddell’s full name.\n\nLet’s see, now, what may be the hidden references to Lewis Carroll and Alice P. Liddell, his « nymphet ») throughout the book and how they might designate Humbert Humbert as a literary « echo », a reflection of the famous Victorian author and Lolita as a distorted reflection of Alice Liddell (We do read in p.3 TAL “(…) this mask–through which two hypnotic eyes seem to glow (…)”, in the foreword. This “mask” allusion might be a clue that Humbert Humbert is really intended to represent someone else in Nabokov‘s mind, and similarly, Humbert’s « Is mask the keyword? » (p.53 TAL) (A wink by Nabokov. It can be read as refering to the riddle) as well. YES, definitely. Humbert is a mask for Lewis Carroll, in the novel.\n\nThe first thing to note in order to ascertain the nature of the relation between Dolores Haze and Alice Liddell and confirm the omnipresence of the Carrollian context of the riddle is, in my opinion, the weird ressemblance of the first names of the women of the Haze family (Lolita and her mother – Lolita and Charlotte) with the first names of Lorina Charlotte Liddell, the big sister of Alice P. Liddell, who was the first Liddell girl to be photographed by Lewis Carroll.\n\n“Lorina” is very close to “Lolita” (only two different letters) and is thus a perfect echo, barely distorted (like in a mirror which reflects reality but distorted (left is right and right is left) and we will see how apt is this term, in the context of the riddle embedded in « Lolita« ), of the girl and woman alluded here (It is also possible that the story of Lita Grey (16 yrs old; real name Lillita Louise MacMurray) and Charlie Chaplin (35 yrs old; real name Charles Spencer Chaplin), could have influenced Nabokov’s choice of a firstname. The scandal of the Grey/Chaplin couple, implicating a middle-aged man (whose firstname does begins like Charlotte, as these firstnames are related – notice also that the French name of Chaplin’s famous movie character is Charlot, a male version of Charlotte (you will see the relevance of that remark a bit later)) and very young girl, might have seemed a good choice of reference. Maybe Lolita’s fascination for movies and movie stars is a way to allude to miss Grey, a very young actress (Chaplin could have been charged with statutory rape under California law) marrying a (then) very famous movie star, and Charlotte is several times compared to Marlene Dietrich, a very famous movie star – probably another allusion to the aforementionned context, but all the hidden allusions to movies and actors in « Lolita » (« Hollywood harlot » (p.90 TAL) and many others) likely point toward another specific direction (more about this later)). We can remark as well that Lolita (Lorina too) and Charlotte forms the L. C. of the initials of Lewis Carroll.\n\nLet’s note that Charlotte Haze, the mother of Lolita, lost a two years old boy, and Lorina Reeve (Liddell), the mother of Alice Liddell, lost a two years old boy as well in 1853, James Arthur Charles Liddell.\n\nHarold E. Haze (Dolores’ father and Charlotte’s husband) is also another very discreet reference to the Liddell family, precisely to E. Harry Liddell, the big brother of the Liddell girls, and even if « Harry » is not actually related to « Harold » but to « Henry », the presence of the E. (Edward in the case of Harry Liddell) can confirm the suspicion – Harold E. and E. Harry can be seen as a barely distorted reflexion of of one another (this principle of distorted reflexion is used throughout the riddle, as hinted by Nabokov in his comment about the riddle in interviews in the 60s).\n\nThe parents of Lolita are a reference to the older siblings of Alice Liddell, despite the fact that her big sister and big brother have the same firstnames than their parents (her mother is Lorina Reeve and her father is Henry Liddell (Harry is related to Henry) – a man whose taste and judgment gained him the admiration and friendship of John Ruskin (more on this later). Henry Liddell was co-author (with Robert Scott) of the monumental work « A Greek–English Lexicon« , known as « Liddell and Scott« , which is still widely used by students of Greek). The confirmation comes from the middle names of her sister and brother. The first Liddell girl was named Lorina Charlotte in memory of Henry Liddell’s mother Charlotte Lyon (who died in 1871; reference in « Lycée in Lyon » p.11 TAL – there is a set of references of Lyon/Lyons/Lyonesse in the background of the riddle) who was herself the daughter of Mary Wren (who died in 1811).\n\nHenry Liddell (1811–1898) and Lorina Reeve (March 1826-1910) had 10 children:\n\n– Edward Harry Liddell (6 September 1847 – 14 June 1911)\n\n– Lorina Charlotte Liddell (11 May 1849 – 29 October 1930)\n\n– James Arthur Charles Liddell (28 December 1850 – 27 November 1853)\n\n– Alice Pleasance Liddell (4 May 1852 – 16 November 1934)\n\n– Edith Mary Liddell (Spring, 1854 – 26 June 1876)\n\n– Rhoda Caroline Anne Liddell (1859 – 19 May 1949; The meaning of Rhoda in ancient Greek is Rose)\n\n– Albert Edward Arthur Liddell (1863 – 28 May 1863)\n\n– Violet Constance Liddell (10 March 1864 – 9 December 1927)\n\n– Sir Frederick Francis Liddell (7 June 1865 – 19 March 1950)\n\n– Lionel Charles Liddell (22 May 1868 – 21 March 1942); he was British Consul to Lyons and Copenhagen (Denmark).\n\nHumbert Humbert dies a November 16 (of 1952, therefore 11/16/1952), just like Alice Hargreaves (Née Alice Pleasance Liddell), who was Carroll‘s “muse”, his model for his stories featuring the little Alice, who died a November 16 (11/16/1934 – barely a month and a half before Lolita‘s birth, on 1/1/1935 – perfect to suggest a literary reincarnation, one legendary real “nymphet” (Alice Liddell) symbolically rematerialized into another legendary nymphet, fictitious this time, Dolores Haze, a.k.a. Lolita)).\n\n1952 is a capital year in the novel and the number 52 is omnipresent and thus loaded with a mysterious meaning in the mind of Nabokov, in the context of this novel. It must be a central symbolic element in the Lolita’s riddle.\n\nAlice P. Liddell (Lewis Carroll’s “child-friend” as he called the children he befriended) was born in 1852. This date is an Alice liddell « tag » there are many hidden references implicating 1852 throughout the novel and this recurring 52 is also an Alice Liddell tag.\n\nAs we mentionned Humbert Humbert dies a November 16, 1952. This date is a reference to both the birth and the death of Alice Liddell. As we will see more thoroughly further, Humbert Humbert is a reflection of Lewis Carroll and the fact that his date of death has written “Alice Liddell” all over it, is one element to prove it ( 11/16/_ + _/_/52 ).\n\nThe “sly” playful Vladimir Nabokov went as far as giving as date of his “On a book Entitled Lolita” (p.311 TAL) published in summer 1957, November 12, 1956 – only two figures to swap to get November 16, 1952! (Notice also in the text, the mention of the town of Telluride (founded in 1878) whose name comes from Tellurium, an element whose atomic number is 52)\n\nDiverse elements are found throughout the novel to confirm the nature of the context of the riddle:\n\nHumbert Humbert receive Lolita’s final letter on September 18, 1952, i.e. 09/18/52 (the last part of the date is 1852 – and the first part is 9 (a recurrent number too, in the book) i.e. 3+4+2, so this date is particularly loaded, symbolically)\n\n« Pierre Point in Melville Sound » (p.33 TAL): A reference to « Pierre or the Ambiguities » a Novel by Herman Melville (1819-1891; notice the 19/91) published in 1852.\n\n« brun adolescent (…) se tordre-oh Baudelaire! » (p.162 TAL): Charles Baudelaire (1821-1867; one of the most famous French poet who tranlated Edgar A. Poe in French). A part of « Le Crépuscule du Matin » (1852).\n\nHumbert refering to the hunchbacked hoary black groom at the « Enchanted Hunters » Hotel: « Handed over to uncle Tom » (p.118 TAL): « Uncle Tom’s Cabin » by Harriet Beecher Stowe (1811-1896) is from 1852.\n\nEtc… the list is non-negligible.\n\n52 reappears many times, like for instance in the fake license plates left on purpose in the motels’ registers by Quilty for Humbert‘s benefit (Q32888, CU88322).\n\nThe addition of all these figures gives us “52”, a number obviously important in the eyes of Nabokov at a symbolic level.\n\nHumbert‘s poem to Lolita (p.255 TAL) is 52 lines long (maybe another hidden Lewis Carroll‘s reference: Lewis Carroll wrote a poem secretly destined to Alice Liddell at the end of his book “Through the Looking-glass”, an acrostic spelling her full name).\n\nIt also seems that Humbert and Lolita spend 52 weeks on the road during their first trip throughout the USA (one year). Before their second road trip Humbert mentionned that Lolita is now 60 inches tall (« my little concubine who was now sixty inches tall » (p. 208 TAL)), which in the European standard unit Humbert is used to would be 1 meter 52 tall (1,52 meter tall).\n\nThe fact that Quilty is the author of 52 scenarios also has to be noted.\n\nThe mention of « smog » in Lolita’s final letter to Humbert « You can’t see the morons for the smog » (p.266 TAL) might also be a « keyword » hinting to the Great Smog of ‘52, an salliant event of this year that is now believed to have caused about 12,000 victims in London.\n\nThe fatidic year for Humbert, when his fate is sealed, when Lolita reappears, when he kills Quilty, when he goes to prison and eventually dies, is 1952. It’s also the year of death of both Lolita and Quilty.\n\nThe mention (p.289 TAL) of the case abduction and rape of the 11 years old Florence Sally Horner by a 50 years old man. In 1948, the 11-year-old Horner stole a 5-cent notebook from a store in Camden, New Jersey. Frank La Salle, a 50-year-old mechanic, caught her stealing, told her that he was an FBI agent, and threatened to send her to « a place for girls like you« . Then he abducted the girl and spent 21 months traveling with her over different American states and raping her. Florence Horner died in a car accident (p.288 TAL, « a routine highway accident« ) near Woodbine, New Jersey, in 1952. It seems clear that the case inspired partly « Lolita » (even though this theme existed long before in Nabokov’s works (see for instance his 1939 work « Volshebnik » (i.e. « The Enchanter« ))).\n\nWe can probably add the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1952 (married in 1947 to Prince Philip (whose uncle was King Constantine I of Greece, father was Andrew, prince of Greece and Denmark and mother was Princess Alice of Battenberg) who was born in 1921 during the Greco-Turkish war (1919-1922). Elizabeth met and fell in love with Philip in 1939) [ the different keywords (« keyword » p.53 TAL) includes: « Queen« , « King« , « Greece« , « Scarlet Guards or Beaver Eaters » (p.90 TAL), « wedding« , etc… ].\n\nNabokov actually used most of the references in « Lolita » to help to the identification of the context of the riddle, and once the context is discovered, to confirm the theory.\n\nA certain number of secret tags in the novel are there to point to Lewis Carroll as part of the riddle:\n\n1811: A Liddell tag. Both the date of birth of Henry Liddell, the father of Alice Liddell and the date of death of Mary Wren, mother of Charlotte Lyon, herself mother of Henry Liddell .\n\n1832: Birth of Lewis Carroll in Daresbury.\n\n1842: (more elements needed)\n\n1849: Birth of Lorina Charlotte Liddell, the first of the Liddell girls to be photographed by Lewis Carroll.\n\n1852: Birth of Alice Pleasance Liddell (on May 4th)\n\n1853: Death of the two years old brother of Alice Liddell (James Arthur Charles Liddell) hinted in the two years old deceased brother of Lolita.\n\n1856: Lewis Carroll meets Alice Liddell for the first time. It’s also the year Carroll started photography.\n\n1862: Invention of the story that will « Alice in Wonderland » on the 4th of July on a boat trip on the thames withe the three Liddell sisters.\n\n1863: Lewis Carroll ceases suddenly his relationship with the Liddell family.\n\n1865: Publication of « Alice in Wonderland« , on the 4th of July.\n\n1867: Lewis Carroll travels to Russia and John Ruskin propose to Rose La Touche.\n\n1868: This is precisely right between the publication of “Alice in Wonderland” (1865) and the publication of “Through the Looking-Glass” (1871), the sequel of the first Alice story (1865+3= 1868 +3=1871), the two prominent books that made of this rather shy man a celebrity in the whole world, even after 150 years. The two most representative landmarks of his life, for everyone. Birth of Lionel Charles Liddell, brother of Alice.\n\nThat is also the year Lewis Carroll rent his house in Guildford, Castle Hill, « The Chestnuts » in which he’ll die. Death of Lewis Carroll’s father.\n\n1871: Publication of « Through-the-Looking-Glass« . Of major importance in about what lies in the shadow of this book. Death of Charlotte Lyon, mother of Henry Liddell.\n\n1878: Date of revealing elements in the context of the riddle. (Nabokov gave an importance to this date because of two excerpts in « The life and letters of Lewis Carroll » and a acrostic poem by Lewis Carroll, « Love among the roses » (a title that in the context of the riddle can be interpreted in a specific manner), that all seemed to reveal much about Lewis Carroll’s nature.)\n\n1882: Date of « Dreamland », an important hint in the riddle.\n\n1888: Date of the last encounter between Lewis Carroll and Alice P. Liddell, on November 1st.\n\n1898: Death of Lewis Carroll, in « The Chestnuts » (also the death of Henry Liddell, father of Alice Liddell).\n\n1910: Death of Lorina Reeve, mother of Alice Liddell.\n\nThe references to these dates (as direct references, references behind references and indirect references) are much more numerous in Lolita than what I’ve put there. I just wanted to highlight a few significant one. I have no time right now to fill this section with a comprehensive list. There are also a few other recurrent significant dates that are not directly linked to Lewis Carroll (namely 1819, 1900, 1911, 1919, 1923 and 1939) and they will be treated later.\n\n——–\n\n1811 (Both the date of birth of Henry Liddell, the father of Alice Liddell and the date of death of Mary Wren, mother of Charlotte Lyon, herself mother of Henry Liddell)\n\nBirth of Harriet Beecher Stowe (1811-1896), author of « Uncle Tom’s Cabin » (1852), alluded in p.118 TAL.\n\nPage 235 TAL, in context of the fake phone call: 2-8282 -> 2 are 1+1. We got: 1181 1811 , i.e. 1811 and its reflection, 1181 (this trick alluding to mirror (looking-glass would be apter, as it is used as a reference to Lewis Carroll) will be find several times in the riddles embedded in this book. This is hinted to the reader in « Lolita » by overt instances of reflexion in the narrative (e.g. Trapp/Pratt; Blanche Schwarzman/Melanie Weiss (etymologically, a pair white-black / black-white: (from (French) blanche = white and (German) schwarz = black (and man = man) and (ancient Greek) Melanie = black/dark, (German) weiss = white, ); widow Haze/widow Hays), etc…).\n\nThe fairy-tale « Undine » (*) by Friedrich de la Motte-Fouqué is published. The rivals of the author applied a sobriquet of « Don Quixote of Romanticism » to him. An opera « Undine » was made by E. T. A. Hoffmann (the author of the novella « The Nutcracker and the Mouse King« , on which the famous ballet « The Nutcracker » is based) with the libretto by Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué, based on his own story « Undine » (It was Hoffmann’s greatest operatic success and a major influence on the development of German Romantic opera).\n\nFouqué’s play Der Sängerkrieg auf der Wartburg (The Song Contest on the Wartburg) is likely one of the sources for Wagner‘s Tannhäuser. Goethe was not impressed by it, remarking to Eckermann: « We both agreed that all his life this poet had engaged in old Germanic studies, however without being able to develop this into a culture of his own making. » Robert Louis Stevenson admired Fouqué’s story « The Bottle Imp » and wrote his own version (The Bottle Imp) with a Hawaiian setting. John Henry Newman and Charlotte Mary Yonge both praised « Sintram and his Companions ». William Morris also became an admirer of « Sintram and his Companions », and it influenced Morris’ own fiction. « Sintram and his Companions » and « Undine » are also referred to in « Little Women » by Louisa May Alcott; the character Jo mentions wanting them for Christmas in the first chapter of the book and finally receives them in chapter 22. Furthermore, « Aslauga’s Knight« , as well as « Sintram and his Companions » and « Undine » are referred to in « Jo’s Boys« , the final book in Alcott’s « Little Women » series, where the story of « Aslauga’s Knight » mirrors the character Dan and his affection for gentle Bess. Fouqué’s Undine also exerted an influence on Hans Christian Andersen‘s « The Little Mermaid » (1837). Edgar Allan Poe was profoundly influenced by Fouqué’s tale, according to Pollin, which may have come about through Poe’s broad reading of Walter Scott. The 1939 play « Ondine » by French dramatist Jean Giraudoux is also based upon Fouqué’s novella.\n\n(*) The story was inspired by the French legend of Melusine, a figure of the European folklore, a feminine spirit of fresh waters in sacred springs and rivers (A fairy of the waters, like the Lady of the Lake. Kind of a water nymph). She is usually depicted as a woman who is a serpent or fish from the waist down (much like a mermaid or a siren) who had been exiled from Avalon (Arthurian context). There was a prose version named « Chronique de la princesse » (Chronicle of the Princess) derived from the most famous literary version of Melusine tales, that of Jean d’Arras (« Roman de Mélusine »), compiled about 1382-1394 (1382 is an anagram of 1832). She is connected with Cyprus, where the French Lusignan royal house that ruled the island from 1192 to 1489 (1489 is an anagram of 1849) claimed to be descended from Melusine (among the well known individuals concerned by this context were Guy of Lusignan and Charlotte of Cyprus (Charlotte of Lusignan), Princess of Antioch and Queen of Cyprus and Melisende of Lusignan, Princess of Antioch, who had a half-sister named Alice of Champagne (in this Outremer context, let’s mention Melisende, Queen of Jerusalem (reign: 1131-1153; Jerusalem is the capital of the Jewish state and quite associated with the Jewish people; many references to Jews and Judaism are found in « Lolita » (more on this later)), who had as sister Alice of Antioch, Princess of Jerusalem, then Princess of Antioch. Melisende (or Mélisande, as it is spelled in French) is a kind of distorted echo of Melusine, and it’s not a coincidence that Maeterlinck‘s Melisande in « Pelleas and Melisande » was apparently inspired by Melusine). Note that the House of Plantagenet also claims shared ancestry from Melusine. Melusine had been sculpted by Ludwig Michael Schwanthaler who also sculpted a « Nymph of the Rhine« , a « Loreley » and a « Nyx« . There is also a well known painting, « Die Schöne Melusine » (the Fair Melusine), by Julius Hübner (1806-1882).\n\n(Pierre Jules) Théophile Gautier (1811-1872) was a French poet, dramatist, novelist, journalist, and art and literary critic. While Gautier was an ardent defender of Romanticism, his work is difficult to classify and remains a point of reference for many subsequent literary traditions such as Parnassianism, Symbolism, Decadence and Modernism. He was widely esteemed by writers as diverse as Balzac, Baudelaire, the Goncourt brothers, Flaubert, Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, Henry James, Marcel Proust and Oscar Wilde. He was a pupil at the Collège Charlemagne. His daughters were named Estelle (a cognate of Stella) and Judith. He was introduced to Victor Hugo via Gérard de Nerval who was a lifelong friend of Gautier. Among his works : « Albertus » (1832), « Pâquerette » (1851; i.e. « Daysies« ), « Le Roman de la Momie » (French ‘momie’ means ‘mummy’ (p. TAL); Marius Petipa‘s « Pharaoh’s Daughter » (1862; revival in 1898 – more about this later) was based on it and there was also a movie based on the book in 1911), « Caprices et Zigzag » (1852), « Emaux et Camées » (1852),« Italia » (1852), « L’Art Moderne » (1856), « Le Captaine Fracasse » (1863), « Romans et Contes« (1863; conte means fairy tale in French), « De Profundis Morpionibus » (1863; Gautier preferred to keep that satirical work anonymous), « Loin de Paris« (1865), « Voyage en Russie » (1867; i.e. ‘Journey to Russia’which is the year Lewis Carrol travelled to Russia), « Tableaux de Siège: Paris 1870-1871″ (1871). Gautier also wrote a verse named « Le Spectre de la rose« . Charles Baudelaire‘s famous « Les Fleurs du Mal« , alluded in « Lolita« , was dedicated to him.\n\n11/18/49 (p.248 TAL): If we use the date format Humbert was used to (the French one, ie. 18/11) it gives us 1811, while the last gives 1849.\n\netc… More references to this year are present in the novel.\n\n—-\n\n1832 (Birth of Lewis Carroll)\n\nBirth of Louisa May Alcott (1832–1888), author of « Little Women » (p.173 TAL).\n\n« Le roi s’amuse » by Victor Hugo in 1832 (« roi » means king in French) is alluded in p.256 TAL (« Bien fol est qui s’y fie! » is a well-known sentence from this play (who was quickly banned in France and would not be performed again until 1882 and which inspired Verdi‘s opera « Rigoletto » that triumphally premiered in Venice in 1851), which was originally pronounced by Francis I ((*) the most emblematic Renaissance French king (who is a character in a French silent movie in 1910), and famous enemy of Charles V – to be counted in the references to French Renaissance Litterature (For his role in the development and promotion of a standardized French language, he became known as le Père et Restaurateur des Lettres (the « Father and Restorer of Letters »))) (Hugo’s most famous novel, worldwide is « Les misérables » (mentionned p.10 TAL) published in 1862 (a story whose most important moments occur in 1823 and 1832 (a 23/32 that certainly caught Nabokov’s attention). There is a 9 years gap between both dates), and one of the writing that has the most impact on Hugo’s life (because of his political content) was « Napoléon le Petit » (1852), a political pamphlet about Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte (a.k.a. Napoléon III, full name Charles-Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte; « Rue Bonaparte » p.26 TAL, « The Emperor » p. 201 TAL, French Emperor between 1852 and 1870). His wife Adèle died in 1868. He had a son named Charles who died in March 1871. Hugo is also known for poetry, especially « Les Contemplations » (1856) and « Les Châtiments » (1853). Among his travel writings « Le Rhin » (1842). One of his play « Inez de Castro » was from 1819 while « Le château du diable » was published posthumely in 1939. He was also a friend of Prosper Mérimée))\n\n(*) François Ier (his firstname means Frenchman. It’s the old spelling of Français (p.25 TAL)): He was alo known as the Knight–king and built an alliance with the Ottoman (Turkish) Sultan). Among his children we find Charlotte, Louise, Charles, Henri and Marguerite. In France he is also particularly known for his victory at the battle of Marignano in September 14 (9/14), 1515 against the Swiss. The coast of Florida (scouted in 1523 in an expedition by Giovanni da Verrazano) was originally called Franciscane in his honor by the French.\n\nJohann Wolgang von Goethe (1749-1832) is alluded several times (the « Erlkönig« , « The Sorrows of Young Werther » inspired by Charlotte Buff, a novel also alluded in the reference to Kreutzer (“The Kreutzer Sonata” by René Prinet (1898) that made an opera named « Werther »). Goethe wrote « Heidenröslein » or « Heideröslein » (« Rose on the Heath » or « Little Rose of the Field » (ref. Dutch/Flemish roosevelt)) is a poem of a young man’s rejected love in which the woman is represented by a rose (There is a companion poem by Goethe, « Das Veilchen », in which the man is represented by a violet). Goethe also wrote « Faust« , a tragic play in two parts (the second part was published posthumously in 1832), « Italian Journey » and an idyll named « Hermann and Dorothea » set at the beginning of the French Revolutionary Wars (an idyll is a short poem, descriptive of rustic life, written in the style of Theocritus’ short pastoral poems, the « Idylls« . Later famous examples include the Roman poets Virgil and Catullus (both mentionned in « Lolita » because of the importance of the keyword « Idyll » in the subjacent context of « Lolita » pointing to Tennyson’s « Idylls of the King« ), and the English poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson (« Idylls of the King« ). A good example of that kind of theme in paintings would be « The Shepherdess » by Bouguereau) that Friedrich Schiller (who became a friend. He was referenced in « Lolita« , especially with Dick Schiller, who gives his last name to Lolita) considered the very climax in Goethe’s production. In 1776, Goethe formed a close relationship to Charlotte von Stein, an older, married woman. Hegel (mentionned in p.259 TAL; he married in 1811 and his sister Christian Luise died in 1832) was fascinated by Goethe (and also by Jean-jacques Rousseau (allusion to him in p. TAL « Jean-jacques Humbert« ) and the French Revolution). Goethe published a « Theory of Colours » concerning the light spectrum (a hint, more about this in the final conclusion part). There are recurrent mentions of Goethe in Freud‘s writings. Schopenhauer cited Goethe’s novel « Wilhelm Meister’s Apprenticeship » as one of the four greatest novels ever written, along with « Tristram Shandy« , « La Nouvelle Heloïse« , and « Don Quixote« . In Wilhelm Meister’s Journeyman Years, Goethe re-tells the Melusine tale in a short story titled « The New Melusine« .\n\nWalter Scott (1771-1832), Scottish author of « The Lady of the Lake » (1810 – it inspired Rossini’s « La Donna Del Lago » (1819)), « Ivanhoe » (1819; John Ruskin (1819–1900; more on this important person important in the riddle later) credited Scott and his « Ivanhoe » for the increased interest in medieval times at this time), or « The Pirate » (1822). He also authored « The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border« , recounting the legend of Melusine. The references to sir Walter Scott are in « Duncan, Walter » and « Scott, Donald » (p.52 TAL): with it, we can get Walter Scott, then remains « Duncan » who is a leading member of Clan Alpine who has just died in « The Lady of the Lake » (the lady of the lake is secretly alluded in « Lolita » (more on this later) and Donald a Gaelic Scottish name (note that Dolly (one of Lolita’s nickname) is also a Scottish pet name for the female version of the firstname Donald ((and Dorothy, also a keyword, a reference in « Lolita« , sometimes directly, sometimes quite indirectly like with the mention of Schlegel (p.259 TAL) who actually points to Dorothea von Schlegel, his wife, who was the author of an unfinished romance named « Florentin« . Schleger himself authored writings such as « Lucinde« , « Über die Philosophie. An Dorothea » and « Kritische Fragmente » („Lyceums“-Fragmente). Schlegel was a pioneer in Indo-European studies, comparative linguistics, in what became known as Grimm‘s law)))). Nevertheless, Duncan refers more directly to the Scottish painter John Duncan (1866-1945) who painted a « Bedivere and dying Arthur« , « Hymn to the Rose » (1907) and a « Tristan and Isolde » (1912) – you will see the relevance of all this later. His work is rooted in the Pre-Raphaelite movement and has yet a certain closeness with Art Nouveau.\n\nGustave Eiffel (1832–1923; there is a famous 1888 photograph of him by Nadar (1820-1910) and another one dated 1910; notice the 32/23). The reference is in the anecdote about the taylor (p. TAL; an Austrian-born French taylor (and a specific reference in p.274 TAL, « an Austrian tailor’s flat finger tips« ) that had moved in Paris in 1898, hence the presence of the anecdote in « Lolita« ) jumping from the Eiffel Tower with a parachute of his own design (in 1911, Colonel Lalance wrote to the Aéro-Club de France, offering a prize of 10,000 francs for a safety parachute for aviators, which decided the taylor, Franz Reichelt, to participate. the mention of Lenormand (p.201 TAL, « echoes from Lenormand« ) might also indirectly point to another Lenormand, besides the playwright Henri René Lenormand (born in May 1882), Louis-Sébastien Lenormand, considered the first pioneer in modern parachuting in the world. He is considered as the first man to make a witnessed descent with a parachute and is also credited with coining the term parachute). It is the Exposition Universelle in 1878 that firmly established his reputation as one of the leading engineers of the time. His first important realisation was the Railway station at Toulouse, France in 1862. Among his other works we can mention the Théâtre les Folies in Paris (1868), Grand Hotel Traian, in Iaşi, Romania (1882), Colbert Bridge in Dieppe, France (1888), Aérodynamique EIFFEL (wind tunnel) in Paris (1911) and he also particpated to the realisation of the Statue of Liberty. We can also mention about the Eiffel Tower that in 1910, Father Theodor Wulf measured radiant energy at the top and bottom of the tower and found more at the top than expected, incidentally discovering what are known today as cosmic rays. William-Adolphe Bouguerau was part of the numerous known individuals that was against the building of the Eiffel Tower. There is also a early short « movie » « Panoramic view during ascent of the Eiffel Tower » by the Lumière brothers, dated 1898. Famous photographs of the different stages of progression (e.g. 20 March 1888, 15 May 1888) of the Eiffel tower construction were published in « La tour de 300 mètres » (1900).\n\nGustave Doré (1832-1883), a French artist who illustrated many books (by such authors as Rabelais, Balzac, Dante Alighieri, Shakespeare’s « The Tempest« , les contes de Charles Perrault (1862), Chateaubriand’s « Atala« , « Don Quixotte de la Mancha » by Cervantes (references in « Don Quixotte » (p.10 TAL) and in « Donald Quix, Sierra, Nev. » p.251 TAL, « Moulinet » (p. TAL; its means « little mill » in French. Old Miss Opposite, a reflexion of « old mill opposite » (which is found in « The Life and Letters of Lewis Carroll« , like several other elements of the riddle) might be counted in the « mill » references as well)), Edgar Allan Poe and Alfred Tennyson’s « Idylls of the King« – all alluded to some extent in the novel). In 1856, he made a twelve folio-size illustrations of The Legend of the wandering Jew. In 1876 (the year was published Carroll’s « The Hunting of the Snark » (March 1876)), was published « The Rime of the Ancient Mariner« , with his illustrations.\n\nÉdouard Manet (1832 – 1883) was a French painter. He was one of the first 19th-century artists to paint modern life, and a pivotal figure in the transition from Realism to Impressionism. His early masterworks, The « Luncheon on the Grass » (Le déjeuner sur l’herbe) and « Olympia » (showing a naked prostitute), both in 1863, caused great controversy and served as rallying points for the young painters who would create Impressionism (it is said that the photograph of Evelyn Hatch naked (Evelyn Maud Hatch was born in 1871 (or 1874?) and was the sister of Beatrice Hatch – more about her later) made by Lewis Carroll could have been inspired by Manet’s « Olympia« ). Today, these are considered watershed paintings that mark the genesis of modern art. In 1856, Manet opened a studio. After the death of his father in 1862, Manet married Suzanne Leenhoff in 1863. Leenhoff was a Dutch-born piano teacher of Manet’s age with whom he had been romantically involved for approximately ten years. Leenhoff initially had been employed by Manet’s father, Auguste, to teach Manet and his younger brother piano. She also may have been Auguste’s mistress. In 1852, Leenhoff gave birth, out of wedlock, to a son, Leon Koella Leenhoff. In 1875, a book-length French edition of Edgar Allan Poe‘s « The Raven » included lithographs by Manet and translation by Mallarmé (1842–1898). In 1881, with pressure from his friend Antonin Proust (Minister for the Arts from 1881 to 1882), the French government awarded Manet the Légion d’honneur. He was painted by Carolus-Duran (a French painter whose real name was Charles Auguste Émile Durand) in 1880.\n\nAmong his notable works:\n\n« The surprised nymph » (1861), « Music in the Tuileries » (1862), « Berthe Morisot with a Bouquet of Violets » (1872), « Le Bar aux Folies-Bergère » (1882), « Garden Path in Rueil » (1882), « The Execution of Emperor Maximilian » (1867 and and another in 1868), « The Barricade (Civil War) » (1871), « The grand canal of Venice (Blue Venice) » (1875), « The Cafe Concert » (1878), « The Plum » (1878), « Still Life, Lilac Bouquet » (1883) and « Gypsy with a Cigarette« . He also painted Rosita Mauri, a famous dancer (who died in Paris in December 3, 1923) in « Jeune femme en rose » (1880).\n\n« Otto Otto » (p.308 TAL) and the several allusion to Greece (e.g. among many others: « El Greco » (p.152 TAL; « the Greek » (he was from Crete)), « Greeks repulse a heavy guerilla assault » (p.262 TAL), « Corfu » (p. TAL, a Greek island), etc…) are poiting to King Otto of Greece who became the first modern King of Greece in May 1832 under the Convention of London and who reigned until he was deposed in 1862. The crown was offered to Edward George Earle Lytton Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton but he declined the offer.\n\nAlso « .32 automatic » in p.62 TAL.\n\nMore references to this year are present in the novel.\n\n—-\n\n1842: (more elements needed)\n\n« Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister » (alluded by Humbert in “While Brown Dolores” (p.245 TAL)) in 1842 by Robert Browning (born in May; an author directly mentionned in p. 117 TAL), an author alluded several other times in “Lolita” (notably with allusions to the play “Pippa passes” (p.207 TAL)). R. Browning was the author of « Bells and Pomegranates No. II: King Victor and King Charles« and « Bells and Pomegranates No. III: Dramatic Lyrics » both in 1842 (it’s the number 3 issue and in ‘42 (again 3-42), in which we find a « Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister« , « The Pied Piper of Hamelin« , « Porpohyria’s Lover » (a poem that received its definitive title in 1863; we can see a mirror effect in Porphyria’s modelling of the persona in the first half; We can see similar ideas in Tennyson‘s « Lady of Shalott » (more about this later)) and « My Last Duchess« ) but also « Dramatic Idylls: Second Series » in which we find « Pan and Luna » and “The Ring and the Book” (1868; his genesis came from Florence, and the subject was proposed to Alfred Tennyson at some point).\n\nCarl (or Karl) Joseph Millöcker (1842-1899) was an Austrian composer of operettas and a conductor. He was born in Vienna, where he studied the flute at the Vienna Conservatory. While holding various conducting posts in the city, he began to compose operettas. The first was « Der tote Gast« , an operetta in one act, premiered in 1865 with libretto by Ludwig Harisch, after the novel by Heinrich Zschokke. The international success of « Der Bettelstudent » (1882; It was revived in New York at least three times, the first time in 1898 at the American Theatre), partly based on Edward Bullwer-Lytton’s « The Lady of Lyons » (and libretto partly from « Le Guitarréro » by Fromental Halévy (May 1799-March 1865) and Eugène Scribe), enabled him to retire from conducting. However, he never achieved a comparable success afterward. Among his other works: « Die beiden Binder » (1865), « Diana » (1867),« Die Fraueninsel » (1868-69 – after « Le royaume des femmes » (i.e. The Women’s Kingdom) by Théodore and Hippolyte Cogniard) and « Das verwunschene Schloss » (March 1878).\n\nEmma Livry (1842–1863) was one of the last ballerinas of the Romantic ballet era and a protégée of Marie Taglioni (reference to the Opéra de Paris and the « Petits Rats » (name of the little dancer at the Opéra de Paris) by Humbert in « Lolita« ). Livry was the illegitimate daughter of Célestine Emarot, a ballet dancer, and Baron Charles de Chassiron (*), which prompted the following rhyming verse:\n\n« Can so skinny a rat\n\nBe the daughter of so round a cat? » (« so round a cat » in French is « Chat si rond » which sounds exactly like « Chassiron » in this language)(*) [ Le Baron Charles Gustave Martin de Chassiron died in 1871. He was married to Princess Caroline Murat, Granddaughter of King of Naples (« Naples » p. TAL) Joachim Murat (Marshal of France and Admiral of France under the reign of Napoleon Bonaparte (Famous French emperor (who died in May), whose son Napoleon II (Napoléon François Joseph Charles Bonaparte; his mother was Marie-Louise of Austria, duchess of Parma) was born in march 1811 and died in 1832 in Vienna, Austria posthumously nicknamed l’Aiglon (French for the Eaglet) after it was popularized by Edmond Rostand’s play « L’Aiglon » in 1900). Famous for his bravery, he was also known as the Dandy King (a dandy lion? (« dandelion » p.73 TAL)). He was also the 1st Prince Murat, Grand Duke of Berg (« Humberg« , p. TAL). He received his titles in part by being Napoleon’s brother-in-law through marriage to his younger sister, Caroline Bonaparte). Charles de Chassiron’s father was Gustave de Chassiron (1791-1868) ]\n\nAt the age of sixteen, she made her debut with the Paris Opera Ballet at the Salle Le Peletier as the sylph (*) in La Sylphide (a ballet from march 1832 in which appears for the first time the tutu). Her talent brought her fame and she became a widely respected ballerina. Livry had the title-role of Farfalla (Butterfly) in « Le Papillon » (‘papillon’ means ‘butterfly‘ in French), the only full-length ballet composed by Jacques Offenbach. On 15 November 1862, Livry’s skirts caught fire on a gaslight. She died from complications after burn injuries.\n\n(*) Also called Sylphid, it’s an air spirit. The word is possibly a portmanteau from Latin sylvestris and nympha, sylvestris being a common synonym for sylph in Paracelsus. Anthon and Trollope note a similar usage in the Aeneid, where silvestris is taken as an elliptical form of nympha silvestris[5] (« forest nymph« ).\n\nCarl Rosa (March 1842 – 1889) was a German-born musical impresario best remembered for founding an English opera company known as the Carl Rosa Opera Company (He started his company in 1869 together with his wife, Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa and the company’s first London season opened at the Princess‘s Theatre in 9/1875) and he popularised opera in Britain and America, performing standard repertory in English, as well as operas by English composers. Rosa was born Karl August Nikolaus Rose in Hamburg, Germany, the son of Ludwig Rose (Ludwig is a cognate of Lewis (and Louis)). he studied at the Conservatorium at Leipzig (where he met and became lifelong friends with Arthur Sullivan) and, in 1862, in Paris. In 1863, Rosa was appointed Konzertmeister at Hamburg and three years later he visited England, appearing as a soloist at the Crystal Palace. During this tour, on 26 February 1867 in New York City, he married Parepa, who became known as Madame Parepa-Rosa. Rosa died suddenly in Paris, on 30 April 1889, and was buried in Highgate Cemetery, London. Rosa’s place in English music was indicated by the number of leading musicians who attended his funeral, including Sullivan, Stanford, Mackenzie and George Grove, together with Richard D’Oyly Carte, George Edwardes and Augustus Harris.\n\nHis company gave the first performance of Puccini’s « La Bohème » (1897; having a prominent character named « Mimi« . Notice that both operas about Gypsies/Bohemians were from79/97) in Great Britain (after his death) and the first English-language production of « Carmen » (1879). It also gave « Tannhäuser » (1882), « Rienzi« , « The Flying Dutchman« , « The Canterbury Pilgrims », « Esmeralda » and Frederic’s Hymen Cowan’s « Pauline » among others.\n\nAmong the singers associated with this company: Rose Hersee who toured the USA with the company from 1865 to 1871 and died in 1924, Charles Santley, Blanche Cole (1851-1888), William Ludwig (who died in 1923) and Alice Esty (1864 – 1935 (the year Lolita was born)) an American soprano born in Massachussets.\n\nMore references to this year are present in the novel.\n\n—-\n\n1849: Birth of Lorina Charlotte Liddell in May, the first of the Liddell girls to be photographed by Lewis Carroll.\n\nEdgar Allan Poe (1809-1849), was an American writer, editor, and literary critic. He was alluded several times in « Lolita« . In 1835, he married Virginia Clemm, his 13-year-old cousin, when he was 26. She died in 1847 and had probably inspired Poe’s poem « Annabel Lee » (1849), overtly alluded in « Lolita« , especially in the character Annabel Leigh. Poe is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction. He is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre. Edgar Poe is particularly respected in France, in part due to early translations by Charles Baudelaire. Baudelaire’s translations became definitive renditions of Poe’s work throughout Europe. There is a homonymous Edgar Allan Poe named after him (the famous author was his second cousin, twice removed), who was born in 1871 and was Attorney General of the State of Maryland from 1911 to 1915.\n\nFrances Hodgson Burnett (1849-1924), an English writer (more will be said about her later).\n\nJohn William Waterhouse (1849-1917; a Pre-raphaelite painter).

Among John William Waterhouse’s paintings are also « The Siren » (1900), « The Mermaid » (1901), « Ulysses and the Sirens » (1891), « Ondine » (1872; French for « Undine » (allusion in « repressed undinist » (p.250 TAL). Jean Gireaudoux‘s play « Ondine » is from 1939)), « A Naiad or Hylas with a Nymph » (1893; Naiads are water Nymphs, allusion in « water nymphs in the Styx » p.250 TAL), « Hylas and the Nymphs » (1896), « Nymphs Finding the Head of Orpheus » (1900), « The Lady Clare » (1900), « Miranda » (1875), « Miranda – The Tempest » (1916), « La belle dame sans merci » (1893), « The Lady of Shalott Looking at Lancelot » (1894), « Dante and Matilda« (formerly called « Dante and Beatrice » – Circa 1914-17), Matilda (study) (formerly called « Beatrice » – Circa 1915), « Gather Ye Rosebuds or Ophelia » (1908), »Gather Ye Rosebuds While Ye May… » (1908; “a rosebud degenerated mouth” (p.218 TAL)), « The Soul of the Rose or My Sweet Rose » (1908) and « Tristan and Isolde » (1916).\n\nJohn Reinhard Weguelin (1849-1927). He was an English painter . Among his recurrent themes: Mermaids, Nymphs and pastoral scenes. Weguelin attended the Slade School of Fine Art, then headed by Edward Poynter.

He also produced illustrations for several books, including a volume of poems by Catullus and Hans Christian Andersen‘s stories in « The Little Mermaid and other Tales« .\n\nAmong the references linked to the keyword « indian » (and the references to physics): the element Indium (atomic number: 49; symbol: IN). I and N are respectively the 9th and 14th letters of the alphabet. Indium was discovered by German scientists Ferdinand Reich (died in 1882) and Hieronymous Theodor Richter (died in september (9) 1898) in 1863.\n\n« spare cot in 49 » (p.118 TAL).\n\nMore references to this year are present in the novel.\n\n—-\n\n1852 (Year of birth of Alice Pleasance Liddell, on May, 4th)\n\nMatthew Arnold (more on him later) wrote a poem “Tristram and Yseult” in 1852 (references to Tristram are omnipresent in the book, with a good reason as we will see).

He was born Hymen Frederick Cohen and his siblings were Elizabeth Rose Cohen (b. 1843); actress, Henrietta Sophia Cohen (b. 1845); painter, Lionel Jonas Cohen (b. 1847) and Emma Magnay Cohen (b. 1849). In 1865 he was sent to Germany to further his musical education. In 1884 he conducted five concerts of the Philharmonic Society of London, and in 1888, on the resignation of Arthur Sullivan, became the regular conductor of that society. Cowen received honorary doctorates from Cambridge and Edinburgh in 1900 and 1910 respectively, and was knighted at St. James’s Palace on 6 July 1911. He married a woman who was 30 years his junior.

More about this later.\n\n« Sylvie » a 1853 novella by Gérard de Nerval (May 1808-1855). It is an idyll written in the form of a reminiscence, the story is about a hero’s love for three women, all of whom he loses; a hymn to unattainable, unrequited love. He also wrote « Lorely, souvenirs d’Allemagne » (1852; « Lorelei » p. TAL), « Voyage en Orient » (1851; partly about his journeys in Egypt and Turkey), « La Bohème Galante » (1852). In 1822 Gérard de Nerval had begun classes at the collège Charlemagne alongside Théophile Gautier (1811-1872), who became a lifelong friend. In his second year at collège Charlemagne he wrote one poem of his, in praise of emperor Napoleon, « Napoléon ou la France guerrière, élégies nationales » that was published. His prose translation of Goethe‘s « Faust« , published in 1828, established his reputation. Goethe himself read Nerval’s translation and called it « very successful, » even claiming that he preferred it to the original. On 22 December 1842 Nerval set off for the Near East, traveling to Alexandria and Cairo (Egypt), Beirut, Constantinople (Turkey), Malta and Naples. Increasingly poverty-stricken and disoriented, he committed suicide during the night of 26 January 1855, by hanging himself from the bar of a cellar window in a narrow lane in a squalid section of Paris. He left a brief note to his aunt: « Do not wait up for me this evening, for the night will be black and white.« . The poet Charles Baudelaire observed that Nerval had « delivered his soul in the darkest street that he could find. »\n\n« La Traviata« , an opera by Giuseppe Verdi (« vert »? (p. and p.186 TAL; always the same trick: vert/Verdi, russet/Rossetti, …)) that premiered in Teatro La Fenice in Venice (note the fenice/venice reflexion effect) in March 1853. It was originally titled « Violetta » after its main female charachter, Violetta Valéry (« violet », « Valeria » (p. TAL)). The opera is based on 1852 French play « La Dame aux camélias », from the earlier novel of the same title, both written by Alexandre Dumas Fils (born in 1824). The central female character of the novel and play, Marguerite Gautier (made in Violetta Valéry in « La Traviata ») is based on the deceased real life love of the author, Marie Duplessis (real name Alphonsine Rose Plessis (born in 1824)) a young courtesan in Paris, France. The Opera, like the original novel and play, are set in Paris. Among the characters of the opera, a Gastone de Letorières and a Flora Bervoix (and among the cast, a Carlotta Berini and a Lodovico Graziani (Lodovico (cognate of Lewis) and Carlotta (cognate of Charlotte (and Carroll))). In France, the opera was first played in Paris in 1856 with Christina Nilsson in the title role (a Swedish soprano that retired in 1888, that got the title of Countess De Casa Miranda through marriage of a Spanish nobleman born in 1832 (The wedding took place in church of La Madeleine, Paris; They had been involved in a relationship since 1882, and Casa Miranda’s daughter, Rosita, had accompanied Nilsson on her 1882–1883 trip to the USA)). The French adaptation of the libretto was published in 1865.\n\n« Cumberland Sheep-Shearers » (1853; « humberland » p.166 TAL) by Elizabeth Gaskell.\n\nElizabeth Gaskell (1810-1865) was an English novelist and short story writer. Among her daughters there are a Marianne and Florence Elizabeth. She became popular for her writing, especially her ghost stories in the « Gothic » vein, aided by Charles Dickens, who published her work in his magazine Household Words.\n\nAmong her works: « Sylvia’s Lovers » (1863), « Wives and Daughters: An Everyday Story » (1865), « The Old Nurse’s Story » (1852), « Hand and Heart » (1849), « The Old Nurse’s Story » (1852), « Cumberland Sheep-Shearers » (1853), « My French Master » (1853), « The Poor Clare » (1856), « Crowley Castle« (1863), « An Accursed Race » (1855), « The Life of Charlotte Brontë » (1857), and « French Life » (1864).\n\nEtc… Many references to this year are present in the novel.\n\n—-\n\n1856 (First encounter between Lewis Carroll and Alice Liddell and it’s also the year Carroll started photography):\n\n« James Mavor Morell, Hoaxton, England » (p.251 TAL) contains references to the play « Candida » (in « Plays Pleasant » published in 1898) by George Bernard Shaw (1856-1950), in which there are a James Mavor Morell and a Hoxton.

In relation with the Carrollian context of the riddle, it should be mentionned that Shaw bought his first camera in 1898 and was an active amateur photographer until his death. Before 1898, Shaw had been an early supporter of photography as a serious art form. His letters to actress Ellen Terry (a friend of Lewis Carroll) by Shaw had been published. The British Prime Minister David Lloyd George was considering recommending to the King Shaw’s admission to the Order of Merit, but the place was instead given to J. M. Barrie.\n\nThe several allusions to Sigmund Freud (May 1856–1939).\n\n« Emma Bovary » by Gustave Flaubert, several times alluded in « Lolita« , was published in 1856.\n\n« The Fisherman and the Siren » (1856-1858) by Frederic Leighton, who also painted « Actaea, the Nymph of the Shore » (1868), « Nausicaa » (1878), « Winding the Skein » (1878), « Mother and Child » (1865), « Wedded » (1881-1882), « Greek Girls Picking up Pebbles by the Sea » (1871), « Captive Andromache » (1888), « Death of Brunelleschi » (1852), « Light of the Harem » and « Idyll« . In 1860, he moved to London, where he associated with the Pre-Raphaelites. He designed Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s tomb for Robert Browning in the English Cemetery, Florence. He had an intense and romantically tinged relationship with the poet Henry William Greville whom he met in Florence in 1856. Leighton was knighted in 1878. He became the president of the Royal Academy in 1878. Leighton was painted by George Frederic Watts who was a popular English Victorian painter and sculptor that also painted Dante Gabriel Rossetti in 1871.\n\nHenri-Edmond Cross, born Henri-Edmond-Joseph Delacroix, (May 1856 – May 1910) was a French painter and printmaker. He is most acclaimed as a master of Neo-Impressionism, and he played an important role in shaping the second phase of that movement. He was a significant influence on Henri Matisse and many other artists, and his work was instrumental in the development of Fauvism. His parents were Alcide Delacroix (Alcide contains an angram of Alice), a French adventurer, and British Fanny Woollett. In 1865 the family moved to a location near Lille, a northern French city close to the Belgian border. Alcide’s cousin, Dr. Auguste Soins, recognized Henri’s artistic talent and was very supportive of his artistic inclinations, even financing the boy’s first drawing instructions under painter Carolus-Duran the following year. Henri was Duran’s protégé for a year. His studies continued for a short time in Paris in 1875 with François Bonvin before returning to Lille. He studied at the École des Beaux-Arts, and in 1878 he enrolled at the Écoles Académiques de Dessin et d’Architecture, studying for 3 years in the studio of Alphonse Colas. In 1891 Cross began painting in the Neo-Impressionist style, and exhibited his first large piece using this technique in an Indépendants show. That painting was a divisionist portrait of Madame Hector France, née Irma Clare, whom Cross had met in 1888 and would marry in 1893. Edouard Manet is to be counted among his influences.\n\nAmong his works: « La fuite des nymphes« , « Sunset on the Lagoon, Venice » (1893-1898), « Regatta in Venice » (1898-1908), « La barque bleue » (« bateau bleu » (i.e. blue boat), p.250 TAL), « La maison rose« , « La Plage de Saint-Clair » (French « clair » sounds very close to English « Clare« ) and « Dormeuse nue dans la clairière« .\n\nHumbert writes « Lolita or the confession of white widowed male » that is about to become « Lolita » in 56 days (« What I started, fifty-six days ago, to write Lolita« , p.308 TAL).\n\netc…more references to this year are present in the novel.\n\n—-\n\n1862 (« Alice in Wonderland » is invented and told for the first time to the Liddell girls)\n\nMaurice Maeterlinck (1862 – May 1949; mentionned as the « pastiche » name « Morris Schmetterling » p.250 TAL; German Schmetterling means « butterfly »). Also intended as an allusion to William Morris (Maurice sounds almost the same in French) who has an importance in the riddle (more on this later). His play « Pelléas and Mélisande » was inspired by the myth of Undines (Naiads, water Nymphs), especially of the legend of Melusine. He is the author of « Oiseau Bleu » alluded by Nabokov in the novel. He received the Nobel Prize in literature in 1911 (there are references to laureates of Nobel Prize in literature in « Lolita« , for a more global view, see this page).\n\n« a replica of the Grotto of Lourdes » p.151 TAL makes reference to a famous site of pilgrimage to a grotto in Lourdes (known for a certain numbers of miraculous healings (so far, 69)) where the 14 years old (the eldest of 9 children of Louise, her mother) Bernadette Soubirous (1844-1879) alledgely had visions of the Virgin Mary. After thorough investigation Church authorities confirmed the authenticity of the apparitions in 1862. After her death, she was exhumed several times and her body seemed preserved from decomposition (the second time was in 1919). Her father died in 1871 and two of her brothers died respectively in 1865 and 1919. Note that Bernadette claimed that feet of the Virgin Mary was covered by yellow roses in her visions. In 1863 Joseph-Hugues Fabisch was charged to create a statue of the Virgin according to Bernadette’s description (Fabisch also made for instance the Golden virgin consecrated on 8 December 1852 on top of the chapel of the Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvière in Lyon (note that basilica is a latin adjective coming from ancient greek Basilike meaning « royal« ), and in 1855 « Beatrix« , a white marble at the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon. In 1868, Fabisch created another Madonna, this one with the Child, for the crypt of the Basilica of the Immaculate Conception in Lourdes).\n\nAlice B. Woodward (1862-1951) was known as one of the most prolific illustrators of the turn of the 20th century. She is known mainly for her work in children’s literature. She succeeded Aubrey Beardsley as illustrator of W.C. Jerrold’s « Bon-Mots of the Eighteenth Century« , and then his « Bon-Mots of the Nineteenth Century« . From 1907 on, her main publisher was George Bell & Sons for whom she illustrated « The Peter Pan Picture Book » written by Daniel O’Connor, creating 28 coloured plates. She illustrated the stories of two Gilbert and Sullivan operas, Lewis Carroll’s « Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland« . Her sister, Gertrude Mary Woodward, also worked in anatomical lithography, and was a lifelong friend of Beatrix Potter, author of the Cildren’s book « The Tale of Peter Rabbit , daughter of Rupert William Potter (1832-1914), photographer.\n\nElizabeth Robins (August 1862 – May 1952; born in Louisville, Kentucky), an actress, playwright, novelist and suffragette (there are quite a few feminists, suffragettes and free thinking women secretly alluded in « Lolita« ). The mention of Ibsen‘s « Hedda Gabler« (p.229 TAL; the mention of Eugene O’neill not long after, has a resonance with James O’neill that helped her join Edwin Booth’s theatre) is actually hinting to her: She brought to the stage, with Marion Lea, Ibsen’s « Hedda Gabler » for the first time ever in England (Hedda became synonymous with Robins in England). After arriving in New York, as a young women she had started touring as soon as 1882. She married George Parks who killed himself in 1888 leaving a suicide note where was written « I will not stand in your light any longer« . The same year she moved to London. She played in Frances Hodgson Burnett‘s « The Real Lord Fauntleroy » in 1889. Robins and Lea brought strong female characters to the scene. She later became friend with George Bernard Shaw who had said because of her work « what is called the Woman Question has begun to agitate the stage ». In 1898, with her new lover William Archer, she started the New Century theatre and produced non-profit Ibsen plays. She stopped her cating carrer at the age of forty.\n\n[ « Who’s Who in the Limelight – actors, producers, playwrights » (p.31 TAL) is an incentive to search references in the domain of actors in order to get the chain of references (the same trick is used by Nabokov for painters, dancers, etc…(more about this later)). ]\n\nEdward Everett Rose (1862–1939) was an American playwright. He adapted a number of popular novels into plays, including « Alice of Old Vincennes » (written by Maurice Thompson in 1900; Vincennes is the name of a French town in the outskirts of Paris where lies a famous castle (« French castles« , p.252 TAL) built by Charles V in the 14th c. and particularly associated with Louis IX (i.e. 9)), and « The Rosary« , »David Harum » and the Penrod stories of Booth Tarkington (Alluded in the town Parkington in « Lolita« , author of « Alice Adams » (Pulitzer Price of 1922), « Cherry« , « Harlequin and Columbine« (see p.242 TAL) and Pulitzer price of 1919 with « The Magnificent Ambersons« ; notice that there is an Alice Adams in the list of the classmates of Lolita in Beardsley (p.224 TAL)).\n\nElizabeth Siddal (1829-1862) was an English artists’ model, poet and artist. She was painted and drawn extensively by artists of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, including Walter Deverell, William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais (including his notable 1852 painting Ophelia) and her husband, Dante Gabriel Rossetti. She was first noticed by Walter Deverell in 1849. Elizabeth Siddal was the primary muse for Dante Gabriel Rossetti throughout most of his youth. Rossetti had met her in 1849, when she was modelling for Deverell and by 1851, she was sitting for Rossetti and he began to paint her to the exclusion of almost all other models and stopped her from modelling for the other Pre-Raphaelites. The number of paintings he did of her are said to number in the thousands. Rossetti’s drawings and paintings of Siddal culminated in « Beata Beatrix » which shows a praying Beatrice (from Dante Alighieri) painted in 1863, a year after her death. Perhaps Rossetti’s most abundant and personal works were pencil sketches of Siddal at home. He began them in 1852, when he moved into Chatham Place with her. In 1855, art critic John Ruskin began to subsidize her career and paid £150 per year in exchange for all the drawings and paintings she produced. Ruskin admonished Rossetti in his letters for not marrying Siddal and giving her security. Siddal overdosed on laudanum in the early months of 1862. Rossetti discovered her unconscious and dying in bed after having had dinner with her and his friend Algernon Charles Swinburne. She died on February 11, 1862 at their home at 14 Chatham Place. Another famous work he produced toward the end of their marriage was his « Regina Cordium » (or « The Queen of Hearts« ). After Siddal’s death in 1862, Fanny Cornforth moved into the widowed Rossetti’s home as his housekeeper and became his model and mistress (she was the model in « Fair Rosamund » and « Lady Lilith« ).\n\nEdith Wharton (1862-1937) is alluded in the mention of « The Age of Innocence » (*) (p.198 TAL; which is actually a reference to Lewis Carroll as you will see in the Addendum part, in the end of the page. The title of the novel was likely inspired by a painting by Joshua Reynolds (the picture was presented to the National Gallery by Robert Vernon (1774-1849)) that Lewis Carroll had parodied), a novel of hers that won the Pulitzer Price for literature in 1921. In 1877, at the age of 15, she secretly wrote a 30,000 word novella « Fast and Loose » and In 1878 her father arranged for a collection of two dozen original poems and five translations, Verses, to be privately published. She was engaged to Henry Stevens in 1882 after a two-year courtship but the month the two were to marry, the engagement abruptly ended. She travelled a lot in France and Italy. Wharton designed The Mount, her estate in Lenox, Massachusetts, that became her primary residence until 1911. She had a lifelong friendship with her Rhinelander niece, landscape architect Beatrix Farrand.\n\n(*) Sinclair Lewis‘ « Main Street: The Story of Carol Kennicott » (notice the Lewis(‘s The Story of) Carol (Kennicott)) was initially awarded the 1921 Pulitzer Prize for literature, but was rejected by the Board of Trustees, who overturned the jury’s decision, and the prize went, instead, to Edith Wharton for « The Age of Innocence » (reference p.198 TAL). Lewis (also author of « The Enchanted Hour » (1919)) was part of the trend toward increasingly critical depictions of rural America (in which are to be counted (Grant Wood‘s (mentionned p.199 TAL) « American Gothic » (a title kind of pointing toward E. A. Poe) or Sherwood Anderson’s « Winesburg, Ohio: A Group of Tales of Ohio Small-Town Life » (1919)).\n\nFromental Halévy (May 1799-March 1862), French composer known for such works as « La Tentation » (i.e. ‘The Temptation’, 1832, having a Miranda as character, played/danced by Pauline Duvernay (immortalised by a 1888 portrait by Carolus-Duran, who have had as a pupil, John Singer Sargent (1856-1925), painter of « Ellen Terry as Lady Macbeth« ), who had made her debut in london in « Sleeping Beauty » (p.201 TAL)), « La Juive » (i.e. « The Jewess » (taking place in 1414) who was a success at the same time in Paris than his 3 acts opéra comique « L’éclair » (The Lightning Flash; the story taking place in Boston and having such characters as Henriette and Lyonel) in 1835 (It remained popular in the 19th century (Emma Calvé sang in it in 1885) )), « La Reine de Chypre » (i.e. « The Queen of Cyprus » (Cyprus was then ruled by the French dynasty of the House of Lusignan) – 1841, starring Marius Petipa), « La Fée aux Roses » (meaning ‘The Roses Fairy‘; 1849), « La Tempesta » (after Shakespeare‘s « The Tempest« ), « Le Juif Errant » (1852; i.e. ‘The Wandering Jew‘), « Jaguarita l’indienne » (French indienne = indian), « Clari« , « Ludovic » (cognate of Louis), « Charles VI« , « La dame de pique » (i.e. ‘The Queen Of Spades‘), « La magicienne » (i.e. ‘The Sorceress‘, based on the legend of Mélusine (supposedly linked to the Lusignan family). The supernatural themes were reflected in several scenes populated by large numbers of mythical creatures. One of the ballets in the first act specified 40 fairies and 6 genies. The fourth act ballet had an even greater variety of creatures: 18 nymphs, 18 naiads and sirens, 14 fairies, 8 genies, and an assortment of butterflies, salamanders, gnomes (e.g. p.254 TAL, « (kiddoid) gnomide« ), and ondines. References for instance in « dancing nymphs, and elves, and monsters« , p.201 TAL) and « Noé » (i.e. ‘Noah’; 1858-1862; uncompleted at Halévy’s death and finished by Georges Bizet who would become later famous with his « Carmen » (whose libretto was written by Ludovic Halévy (nephew of Fromental Halévy – let’s notice that Ludovic is etymologically related to Lewis/Louis) and Henry Mailhac. Amongst the most celebrated works of the joint authors were « La belle Hélène » (1864), « Barbe-bleue » (1866; i.e. « Blue beard« ), « La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein » (1867), « La Périchole » (1868). Ludovic Halévy’s increasing popularity as an author enabled him to retire from the public service in 1865 that he had entered in 1852. He married in 1868, the year he also authored « Fanny Lear » with Meilhac. Halévy and Mailhac also wrote « Le Roi Candaule » (a subject also treated in 1868 in a grand ballet choreographed by Marius Petipa at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre, St. Petersburg, Russia – we have a photography of Olga Preobrajenska as Diana in the Pas de Diane in relation with that ballet), « Rose et Rosette« , « Le Photographe » (i.e. the photographer), « Le Train de minuit » (i.e. midnight train, 1863), « Lolotte« (kind of a mix between Lolita and Charlotte). Ludovic Halévy also wrote the succsesful « The Abbot Constantine » (1882) and also a novella « Princesse« ).\n\netc… more references to this year are present in the novel (there’s obviously more to find)\n\n—-\n\n1863 (Lewis Carroll ceases suddenly his relationship with the Liddell family)\n\n« A girl of the Limberlost » (p.173 TAL) was written by Gene Stratton-Porter (1863-1924)\n\nAlison Skipworth (1863–1952) was an English stage and screen actress, born Alison Mary Eliott Margaret Groom, who married Frank Markham Skipworth in 1882, a painter (who was a pupil of William Adolphe Bouguereau) whose most famous painting is probably « The Mirror » (1911). In a light opera, « An Artist’s Model« , she served as understudy to Marie Tempest. In 1905 and 1906 she toured with Viola Allen in three productions of Shakespeare. She had joined the company of Daniel Frohman at the Lyceum (« lycée » p.11 TAL) in which she made her debut in « The Princess and the Butterfly » as Mrs. Ware. She also featured in other productions such as « The Enchanted April » and « The Grand Duchess and the Waiter« . She appeared in many movies such as for instance, « A Mardi Gras Mix-Up« , « 39 East« , « Alice in Wonderland« , « Wharf Angel« , « The Girl From 10th Avenue« , « The Princess Comes Across » and « White Hunter« .\n\nDeath of Jacob Ludwig Carl Grimm (1785-1863), one of the brothers Grimm. The Grimm Brothers’ Fairy Tales are several times alluded in « Lolita« , directly or indirectly. One of the tales included in their collection « Deutsche Sagen » is « The Piper of Hamelin », the story of a piper that lures children away from their parents (pretty apt in « Lolita« ), had been also used by Robert Browning in a poem in « Dramatic Lyrics » (1842) and by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe who wrote a poem on the theme in 1803 and incoroporated references to the story in his version of Faust (The second part of the drama was published in 1832 (reference in « Omen Faustum » (p.262 TAL))). They also wrote « Little briar Rose » (a version of the « Sleeping Beauty » (p.201 TAL)), of importance in the riddle (more about this later). Two volumes of the second edition of the the Grimm’s Faity Tales were published in 1819.\n\n« shorn Baudelaire » (p.284 TAL): a reference to a famous photograph of the French novelist Charles Baudelaire, taken in 1863 by Carjat (but also to a well-known sculpture by Raymond Duchamp Villon from 1911).\n\n« Death of Marat« (*) is a painting by Edvard Munch (1863-1944), a famous Norwegian painter that studied painting in Paris. He is famous for « The Scream » (there are two versions: 1893 and 1910). He also made some photographs, among them the photograph of a naked woman titled « Rosa Meissner at the Hotel Rohn in Warnemünde« .\n\n(*) (reference in « I felt like Marat but with no white-necked maiden to stab me » p.26 TAL; In Munch’s painting we can see a naked Charlotte Corday beside a dead Marat)\n\nCharles Aubrey Smith (1863-1948), English actor.

Directly alluded in « Lolita« , some of his major works are « The Man Who Would Be King » (1888), « If— » (1910) and « The Gods of the Copybook Headings » (1919). He was the youngest person to receive a Nobel Prize in literature at 42 years old (there are references to laureates of Nobel Prize in literature in « Lolita« , for a more global view, see this page).\n\n« Tristan und Isolde » (1865) by Richard Wagner (born in May) is sometimes described as marking the start of modern music. « Tristram and Yseult » (Tristan is another spelling for Tristram) are an important reference in the novel in relation with the riddle (The theme of “Tristram and Yseult” was for instance depicted in the Oxford Union Murals by William Morris (author of « A Dream of John Ball » (1888)), a major element of the riddle. Morris’ verses in the « The Legend of Briar Rose« , « About the tangle of the rose; But lo! the fated hand and heart » (referenced in « Look at this tangle of thorns » p.9 TAL (roses, probably the main object of reference and main symbolical element in the riddle, are flowers with thorns) is of major importance in the riddle; more on this later)).\n\nW. B. Yeats (1865–1939; Nobel Prize in literature of 1923 ; there are references to laureates of Nobel Prize in literature in « Lolita« , for a more global view, see this page), author of « The Secret Rose » (1897). His poetry is known to owe to the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. He was in love with Maud Gonne who had daughter named Iseult Gonne who Yeats affirmed had been molested by her stepfather John mcBride, in a letter. His brother Jack Butler Yeats (1871-1957) was a painter that drew comic strips, including the Sherlock Holmes parody « Chubb-Lock Homes » for « Comic Cuts« , and wrote articles for « Punch » under the pseudonym « W. Bird« . He also had interest in literature and wrote novels in a stream of consciousness style that James Joyce was famous for.\n\n« Fata Morgana » (1865; « fatamorganas« , p.239 TAL; More will be said later about Morgan Le Fay (sometimes refered as Fata Morgana (her Italian name))) by George Frederic Watts (1817-1904), English Victorian painter and sculptor associated with the Symbolist movement. Watts was born in Marylebone, London. In 1847, whilst still in Italy, Watts entered a new competition for the Houses of Parliament with his image of Alfred the Great, « Alfred Inciting the Saxons to Prevent the Landing of the Danes by Encountering them at Sea« , on a patriotic subject but using Phidean inspiration. Leaving Florence in April 1847 for what was intended to be a brief return to London, he ended up staying. Back in Britain he was unable to obtain a building in which to carry out his plan of a grand fresco based on his Italian experiences, though he did produce a 45 ft by 40 ft fresco on the upper part of the east wall of the Great Hall of Lincoln‘s Inn entitled « Justice, A Hemicycle of Lawgivers » (completed 1859), inspired by Raphael‘s « The School of Athens« . In his studio he met Henry Thoby Prinsep (1793-1878; brother of Charles Robert Prinsep (a graduate of St John’s College, Cambridge and Lincoln‘s Inn barrister and economist; his son Henry Charles Prinsep, was an artist, and his daughter was ‘May‘ Prinsep); Charles was painted in 1871 by Watts) and his wife Sara and susequently joined the Prinsep circle of bohemians, including Sara’s seven sisters (including Virginia, with whom Watts fell in love but who married Charles, Viscount Eastnor in 1850), and Julia Margaret Cameron (sister-in-law of Henry (and sister of Sara)). Previously staying at 48 Cambridge Street, and then in Mayfair, in 1850 he helped the Prinseps into a 21-year lease on Little Holland House, and stayed there with them and their salon for the next 21 years. One of only two pupils Watts ever accepted was Henry’s son Valentine Cameron Prinsep; the other was John Roddam Spencer Stanhope. He painted « The Triumph of the Red Cross Knight » (from « The Faerie Queene« ) in 1852–1853. He also took a short trip back to Italy in 1853 (including Venice, where Titian became yet more of an inspiration) and with Charles Thomas Newton to excavate Halicarnassus in 1856-57, via Constantinople (Turkey) and the Greek islands. In the 1860s, Watts’ work shows the influence of the pre-Raphaelite Dante Gabriel Rossetti (that Watts painted in 1871), often emphasising sensuous pleasure and rich colour.\n\nAmong his works: « Fata Morgana » (1865), « Sir Galahad » (an Arthurian knight; 1888), « Little Red Riding Hood » (a fairy-tale narrated both by Charles Perrault and the brothers Grimm), « Miss May Prinsep » (daughter of Charles Robert Prinsep who married Hallam Tennyson, elder son of Alfred, Lord Tennyson); there exists a photograph of her by the famous photographer Julia Margaret Cameron), « Hope » (1886; a Symbolist oil painting that became widely popular and that Theodore Roosevelt displayed a copy at his Sagamore Hill home in New York) and « Portrait of Hannah Primrose, Countess of Rosebery« . He married Ellen Alice Terry (an actress who became a friend of Lewis Carroll; Watts had met her via Tom Taylor), 16 years old, when he was 46. He painted her in a painting named « Choosing » (it’s to be counted among the paintings showing the influence of Rossetti). When she eloped with another man after less than a year of marriage, Watts was obliged to divorce her.\n\nRemy Belleau’s « un petit mont feutré (…) filet escarlatte » (p.47 TAL) is found in the Leyden reprint (1865) of « Recueil de pièces choisies rassemblées par les soins du cosmopolite », duc d’Aiguillon, ed.(1735) « The Cornell Library owns a copy, noted Nabokov » (p. 359 TAL).\n\n« Croquet Players » (1865) and « Croquet Match » (1868-69) by Winslow Homer (1836-1910; a well-known American painter, who among other things painted pastoral themes, e.g. « Bo-Peep » (1878), « Shepherdess Tending Sheep » (1878) and « Warm Afternoon (Shepherdess) » (1878). Among his other well-known works we find for instance « Crossing the Pasture » (1871-1872), « A Visit of the Old Mistress » (picturing a former slave owner visiting her freed slaves), « Artists Sketching in the White Mountains » (1868), « Peach Blossoms » (1878) or « Girl with Red Stockings » (1882). He did a lithography apprenticeship in 1855-1856, and attended the National Academy of Design in 1863. Homer also spent two years (1881-1882), outside of the USA, in the English coastal village of Cullercoats, Tyne and Wear). [ About the keyword « croquet »: « Castle Croquet »: Was a game of croquet invented in 1863 by Lewis Carroll. “Castle Croquet” published anonymously by Carroll in 1863, as “Croquet Castles” was republished in this version in “Aunt Judy’s Magazine,” No. XVI, August 1867, pp. 221-224. ]\n\n« A Sleeping Faun » (1865) by Harriet Hosmer (1830-1908), a famous female sculptor (« statue« , p.253 TAL).

She moved in Rome, Italy, in 1852 and had a lesbian affair with Emma Stebbins (1815-1882; (*)) another famous woman sculptor (Her bronze statue of educator Horace Mann was installed outside the State House in Boston in 1865). In Rome there was a colony of artists and writers (among them Edmonia Lewis, an African-american female sculptor) and she was part of the artists described in Nathaniel Hawthorne‘s book « The Marble Faun« . When in Florence, she was frequently the guest of Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning at Casa Guidi.\n\n(*) Stebbins eventually fell in love with actress Charlotte Cushman (who had just ended a relationship with journalist and writer Matilda Hays (a translator of the French « lady writer » (p.44 TAL) with a male pen name, George Sand). In her carrer Cushman had played in the New York premiere of « The Lady of Lyons » a play that inspired the operetta « Der Bettelstudent » (1882) that was revived in New York at least three times, the first time in 1898 at the American Theatre), and quickly became involved in the bohemian and feminist lesbian lifestyle. Stebbins released the correspondence, « Charlotte Cushman: Her Letters and Memories of Her Life » in 1878.\n\nCharles Hudson (4 October 1828 – 14 July 1865 ; among the keywords « alpinist » (p.10 TAL), « swiss« , « Alps« , « mountain« , etc…) was an Anglican chaplain and mountain climber from Skillington, Lincolnshire, England. During the first ascent of the Matterhorn (located in Switzerland; a.k.a. Mont Cervin, in French), on 14 July 1865, Hudson was killed in a notorious accident during the descent. Amongst his guided climbs were the first ascent of Monte Rosa in 1855 (in French massif du Mont Rose) located between Switzerland and Italy. Hudson was one of the most important climbers of the golden age of alpinism. An immensely strong walker, he is considered a pioneer of guideless and winter climbing in the western Alps.\n\nEdward Whymper (The first ascent of the Matterhorn was made by Edward Whymper and a few others, among them, Charles Hudson) ultimately succeeded in making the mountain’s first ascent in July 1865 while his rival Jean-Antoine Carrel led the party that achieved the second ascent three days later.\n\nPiz Roseg, a mountain in the Swiss Alps was first climbed to the top by Horace Walker (1838-1908) in 1865 (he was also the first to climb and to reach the top of diverse peaks in the Alps in France and Switzerland during 1865 and 1868).\n\nMarie Geneviève van Goethem (or Goetham or Goeuthen; born 7 June 1865) was a French ballet student and dancer with the Paris Opera Ballet, and the model for Edgar Degas’s statue « Little Dancer of Fourteen Years » (i.e. a 14 years old « petit rat » (p. 230 TAL; French, litterally « little rat » (a very young ballet student at the Paris opera))) (Fr: La Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans).

Among other things he wrote « Le Peintre de la Vie Moderne » (1863), « Curiosités Esthétiques » (1868), « L’art romantique » (1868), « Les Fleurs du mal » (1857; i.e. The flower of evil [ Baudelaire dedicated the book to Théophile Gautier (1811-1872), describing him as « a perfect magician of French letters« . With this book, Baudelaire and his publisher were prosecuted under the regime of the Second Empire as an outrage aux bonnes mœurs (« an insult to public decency »). Upon reading « The Swan » (or « Le Cygne« ) from « Les Fleurs du mal« , Victor Hugo announced that Baudelaire had created « un nouveau frisson » (a new shudder, a new thrill) in literature; a poem « Lesbos » is to be found in it. A « definitive » edition appeared in 1868 with a preface by Théophile Gautier ] ), « Les paradis artificiels » (1860) and posthumously « Mirror of Art » (1955; granted not to be counted in the riddle).
