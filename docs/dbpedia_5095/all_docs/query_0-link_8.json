        "text": "Théophile Gautier (1811 - 1872)\n\nPierre Jules Théophile Gautier was a French poet, dramatist, novelist, journalist, art critic and literary critic. While Gautier was an ardent defender of Romanticism, his work is difficult to classify and remains a point of reference for many subsequent literary traditions such as Parnassianism, Symbolism, Decadence and Modernism."
