        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nFor some years we have been looking to our seven sister-tongues besides English (each of which possesses an Academy and a 'Dictionary' which is not merely a jeu d'esprit) to rescue us from the slang which some English purists would have us accept as English, and to retain the French influence at its best, so that an international parlance may at all times offer the emulation of perfect expression. French literature is, in fact, an open book for the lover of English, for his Shakespeare was greatly influenced by French drama—a debt of which he is himself most proud. As a consequence, the resources of the French theater, upon which kingly patronage was constantly lavished, had their influence upon England before the English drama came into being. The play, which, as has been said by a Frenchman, 'defines in itself the entire mystery of the theater,' has been called, like another notable rival of the English (which, technically speaking, is dramatic only in character, and 'silent'), the ballet of action, so constituted as to call into activity all the resources of the stage. It was therefore to be expected that the first great English dramatist in philosophically adopting the play, and employing it as an influence of lives well hid, should have used the arsenal of the theater so often and so greatly. Not that human actions were new with the Christianity that condemned the theater: the philosopher's flights constructed as it were from something almost tangible betokens their own origin. In his day, the other Shakespeare, noted for royal partiality, wrote a treatise on the 'pompant use of the theater, and a defense of the theater against the attacks of some puritans. The true spirit of the theater was already accepted among cultivated people; as wise Claudian had read its ultimate opinions for the poet, and Pierre de, Sir Philip Sidney and Bacon were to transcribe them. We have but to reconstruct the virile concepts to understand the immense influence of the contemporary stage upon the English playwright.\n\n2. Shakespeare's Impact on French Literature\n\nIn studying the impact of Shakespeare on French literature, one can consider either the plays or the poems of the English writer. Let us begin with his plays. They constitute the most direct form of his influence, that is to say, the form most likely to be diffused outside England. However, even though the translation of Shakespeare's works is clearly an important factor in his influence, it has made less impact on French literature than the plays themselves, which have been imitated, adapted, and imitated, rather than closely translated. The translation of Shakespeare's plays did not really begin until the nineteenth century, for prior to that time it could do little to contribute to the French knowledge of English style or vocabulary. Nevertheless, the appearance of Shakespeare in French translation is an important event which tends to occur as a form of event. A play is performed on the stage or the frameworks of a performance before it may be printed. It is usually staged in a national language. Even though translations of their works are often censored, playwrights have hitherto been spared the task of trying to compose a piece in a foreign language. To ask them to do so is to challenge an unequivocal characteristic of the theatrical genre. In the seventeenth century, for example, foreign plays underwent myriad adventures on the French stage, but the overwhelming majority were written in French. On a practical level, a play intended for the stage must be written by someone who commands the language of the theatre and the public. For many reasons, that author is generally a native. If a foreigner wanted to write for the stage, he or she needed the ability to master the language of the locale where the play would be performed.\n\n3. Key Themes and Motifs in French Literature Inspired by Shakespeare\n\nThe French attraction to Shakespeare is not only explained by the universal nature of the questions and critical issues raised in the work of the English playwright, but also by the kinship between the great French classical authors and Shakespeare. French and English authors share common themes and motifs vitally linked to their era. They both interact in the domain of intelligence. French tragic authors, especially Jean Racine and Pierre Corneille, represent the crown of the French classical period of literature with their emphasis on the eternal struggle and conflict of the individual torn from his or her own truth. This constant battle of the will likes to compete with psychological perturbations and mischievousness. In addition to that, Racine contemplated all the works of Shakespeare after his last play, and it is very probable that his heroes, his desire to maintain the tragic tension until the end of his plays, the rhythm of his writing and his declamations are inspired by a profound study of the Anglo-Saxon author. In order to distribute so much influence to the English author, Racine must have recognized, through his translations, some of his principal scenes. The same kinship is present with the French classical tragedies from a poetological point of view. By his refusal of anti-theatricalism and the adoption of a redundant bias, complete with the concept of meaning, Racine found, in Shakespeare’s models, the place that he coveted and whose aesthetic beauty he preached. It is in this sense that the recent discovery of the first page of ‘La Peinture’ illustrates this writer’s thought. Racine refuses that the painter is content to represent a beautiful body. In Racine's eyes, reason represents alone the art of the beautiful and must adapt to an intelligible representation and tied up to the human. Consequently, a representation not linked to our everyday studies no longer has any poetic value. So Racine, more than ever, loves intelligent painting and accentuates, in a strange way, the psychological challenges inherent in the work of Shakespeare.\n\n4. Notable French Authors Influenced by Shakespeare\n\nAmong the authors of the 19th century, the names most generally associated with Shakespeare include those of Chateaubriand, whose mystical imagination found a particular affinity with the romances; Victor Hugo, who at various periods of his inspiration was inspired by Richard III, Henry IV, Othello, Macbeth, Coriolan; Sainte-Beuve, who wrote a comprehensive study of the author that attracted considerable attention in his own day; Victor Hugo’s most distinguished disciple, Theophile Gautier, who wrote a monograph on him; and Francois-Victor Hugo, the poet’s son and literary executor, whose comprehensive edition of The Complete Works of Shakespeare in twelve volumes stands as a landmark in the history of critical editions of this author. Then later, more recent authors, it is worth mentioning the names of Baudelaire, Swinburne, Leconte de Lisle, Heredia, Mallarme, Theophile de Banville, and Paul Valery. The influence of Shakespeare on other great French authors is to be seen both in the numerous novelists and in playwrights and poets. In addition to Victor Hugo, Dumas, at one period of his work, adapted himself to the Shakespearian example and was particularly fond of Antony and Cleopatra. Alexandre, in whom French naturalism reaches the highest point, not only knew Shakespeare’s works by heart but wrote a preface to Antony and Cleopatra. Likewise, Emile Zola was also familiar with the Shakespearian heritage. Concerning Eugène Scribe, a prolific and popular playwright, it is known that he adapted four plays of Shakespeare in collaboration with Pixerect. Henri Becque also quoted Shakespeare’s words: “Une foule de faits choisis avec prudence et dangereusement entrelacé et à moi ne sembleront qu’un songe.” as an example. In addition, Eugène Vermont, Anatole France, Alfred de Musset influenced by Othello, and the Comtesse de Noailles, who was deeply imbued with Shakespeare, often attended performances of his plays in England.\n\n5. Comparative Analysis of Shakespearean Works and French Literary Adaptations\n\nWe distinguish two categories of French literary works associated with Shakespeare's plays: adaptations-fillets that are followed closely along with the original script and very small modifications, and adaptations-remakes whose influence, references, and evocations are sparser and not coherent in the text. The major difficulty we have encountered while looking for these adaptations is to find a strict French equivalent for the term 'adaptation,' which might also denote a simple title change. Numerous plays have been presented on national stages that use their substantial Shakespearean influence, but which have obviously broken free of any significant reliance on the original text. One can clearly notice that the Coulisses Goupil editions omit the preface in their publications because the editor considers that it contributes to the creation of a literary illusion 'qui nous aveuglent pour nous empêcher de voir que ces drames sont des adaptations, aptes à séduire un public ayant une culture médiocre.' That is the reason why I have trusted adaptation, transferring it to the French versions of Shakespearean works. The frequent productive use of French classics for the creation of new works of literature has facilitated the adaptation of Shakespeare's writings. The history of French classic use is not due merely to the desire to incorporate foreign literary creations in national literature. There are three main theatrical ways through which non-French plays have exerted an influence on dramatists, the first being the adaptations and remakes of these foreign plays, and only secondly the importance of the tradition and of the presence of these models on stage. There are two ways through which the French work becomes an adaptation: either the original text is rewritten with minute changes so that a new play is created, or the foreign source is merged with elements from French works. Some rewriting adaptations can feature the subtitle: a comedy by... after...; others appear under the name of the French adapter. The adapter, having the original play at his disposal, can fully participate in this transcription of text into the national language. The development of types of adaptations indicates that the original is well-known and fairly respected by the French literary world in search of replay schemes and cultural references. The secondary material, the prologue, the epilogue, the list of characters, the indications of scenic material, are adapted in harmony with the French version. With so many fundamental changes to the original, we might say that the reinterpreter has become a transformer, claiming the work as his.\n\n6. Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the reaction of Frenchmen, and those who learned from Frenchmen, toward Shakespeare may well seem to deserve more esteem than it has received. Those few who knew his work early seem to have progressed toward a consideration of it that is less amateurish than many French attitudes toward modern literature - \"bad,\" \"pretentious,\" and other such general terms, or else merely gossipy - would lead us to expect. Perhaps, as the rationalists expect. But people are rational only in fits and starts. A third point worth noting is that the ideas found in Shakespeare are particularly dangerous to men in transition who acknowledge some truths held by other men. Specifically, the Shakespearean ideas have a particular maîtres, both classical and Christian, and the notions of liberty, justice, and fraternity. Finally, some matter belonging to a subsequent article may be suggested by noting that while for other reasons we in our own age would expect to find in the eighteenth-century French almost all of the special quality of a Shakespeare rather than that of a Pope - in classical form though he may be - those who love human beings, then and now, find something immensely reassuring about the well-balanced Pope."
