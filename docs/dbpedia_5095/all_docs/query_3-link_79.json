        "text": "The first French literature work translated into Japanese from the original French was Jules Verne's (1828-1905) Around the World in Eighty Days translated by KAWASHIMA ChÅ«nosuke (1853-1938) in 1878. Thereafter a variety of works were translated from both the originals and English translations, including popular literature by the likes of Dumas father and son (father 1802-1870, son 1824-1895) and Victor-Marie Hugo (1802-1885), and naturalism literature by Ãmile Zola (1840-1902) and Guy de Maupassant (1850-1893), and became widely popular. However, at times these translations greatly abridged the originals, changed the character names to Japanese ones and changed the setting to Japan, making many of them more proper to be called adaptations (rough adaptations) rather than translations. It can be seen that the translators repeated trials and errors to attempt to convey to the readers the stories of other countries, with which they were little familiar at the time, without losing the purport and effect of the originals.\n\nThe beginnings of translation\n\nDumas father and son\n\nÃmile Zola and naturalism\n\nTranslation of Les MisÃ©rables\n\nPierre Loti's visit to Japan\n\nChildren's literature\n\nTranslation of French poetry"
