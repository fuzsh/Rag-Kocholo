        "text": "Heine and the French Symbolists\n\nHaskell M. Block\n\nHeinrich Heine has been rightly proclaimed as one of the major forces in the development of French poetics and poetry in the middle and later years of the nineteenth century.1 He lived for the last twenty-five years of his life, from 1831 to 1856, in Paris, and, both during his lifetime and afterwards, he enjoyed immense popularity among the French reading public. It has been estimated that more collections of Heine’s poetry were published in French translation in the second half of the nineteenth century than of all other German poets combined.2 Unquestionably, his personal relations with such French friends and admirers as Nerval and Gautier played a large role in the diffusion of his work. Younger contemporaries, such as Baudelaire and Banville, drew on Heine’s thought and art, and helped to direct and sustain an interest in Heine on the part of their symbolist followers. Mallarmé and Villiers de l’Isle-Adam, Verlaine and Laforgue, these and others responded in different ways to the appeal of Heine’s poetry and, to at least some extent, incorporated his themes and processes into their own art.\n\nIt would be excessive to see Heine as a symbolist poet. His early and best-known lyrics are squarely part of the Romantic tradition: direct and poignant expressions of deeply felt personal emotion. His late poems, especially those of his very last years, are more religious and philosophical in theme and implication, and to this extent point to an affinity with some of the poetry of the symbolists; but the intensely personal note is ever present, and the complex interiorization of experience characteristic of the symbolists is quite removed from Heine’s more concrete and objective rendering of reality. Nevertheless, the French symbolists and their predecessors elaborated an image of Heine in many ways akin to the norms and values they set forth for their own poetry and indeed for poetry generally. This selective appropriation was possible because of real and important anticipations of symbolist doctrines and styles in Heine’s work, but these exist along with other elements and preoccupations that are poles apart from those of the symbolists. In examining Heine in a symbolist perspective, we must not lose sight of the manysidedness of his art.\n\nGérard de Nerval’s interest in translating Heine’s poetry extended for over two decades. As a letter of 1840 from Nerval to Heine indicates, the process of translation was marked by a close and warm personal collaboration.3 Nerval’s command of German was uneven; perforce, his translations tended to stress those themes and experiences in Heine’s poetry most in accord with his own sensibility. The result is a somewhat symbolist version of Heine.4 Nerval’s translations tend to reduce Heine’s ironic and satiric edge in favor of an assertion of dream, nostalgia, and reverie.\n\nNerval’s translations of Heine were first published, with an elaborate introductory essay, in two parts in the Revue des Deux Mondes for 15 July and 15 September 1848. Recent study has shown that large sections of the introduction and commentary were actually written by Gautier and were then subjected to minor alteration by Nerval.5 This collaboration makes the introductory essay all the more interesting in the light of Gautier’s importance for Baudelaire and his followers. Nerval is aware of the rich variety of themes in Heine’s poetry, but emphasizes the legendary and supernatural elements rather than the satiric and political: “Nous préférons vous offrir un simple bouquet de fleurs de fantaisie, aux parfums pénétrants, aux couleurs éclatantes.”6 Gautier, on the other hand, stresses the mixture of antithetical attitudes and styles in Heine, and his miraculous plastic powers of expression: “Heine est naturellement sensible, idéal, plastique, et avant tout spirituel.” Above all, for Gautier, Heine’s is a poetry of suggestiveness, mystery, and magic: “Les mots chez lui ne désignent pas les objets, ils les évoquent.”7 Gautier’s account of Heine’s art provides a striking example of a symbolist view of Heine avant la lettre; the opposition of naming and evoking in Gautier’s formulation came to be elaborated by Baudelaire and Mallarmé as a distinguishing element of symbolist aesthetics.\n\nWhile Gautier and Nerval accentuated qualities that were in fact present in Heine’s art, Nerval’s French translation tended to expand Heine’s diction at the expense of the metaphorical compression of the original text. In part, this elaboration may reflect Nerval’s replacement of Heine’s verse by a highly charged poetic prose, but it may also indicate a particular way of viewing Heine’s poetry. As an illustration, we may compare Heine’s “Abenddämmerung” from the cycle Die Nordsee with Nerval’s translation. The French text reads very much like a symbolist poème en prose:\n\nAbenddämmerung\n\nAm blassen Meeresstrande\n\nSaß ich gedankenbekümmert und einsam.\n\nDie Sonne neigte sich tiefer und warf\n\nGlührote Streifen auf das Wasser,\n\nUnd die weißen, weiten Wellen,\n\nVon der Flut gedrängt,\n\nSchäumten und rauschten näher und näher—\n\nEin seltsam Geräusch, ein Flüstern und Pfeifen,\n\nEin Lachen und Murmeln, Seufzen und Sausen,\n\nDazwischen ein wiegenliedheimliches Singen—\n\nMir war, als hört’ ich verschollne Sagen,\n\nUralte, liebliche Märchen,\n\nDie ich einst als Knabe\n\nVon Nachbarskindern vernahm,\n\nWenn wir am Sommerabend\n\nAuf den Treppensteinen der Hausthür\n\nZum stillen Erzählen niederkauerten,\n\nMit kleinen, horchenden Herzen\n\nUnd neugierklugen Augen;\n\nWährend die großen Mädchen\n\nNeben duftenden Blumentöpfen\n\nGegenüber am Fenster saßen,\n\nRosengesichter,\n\nLächelnd und mondbeglänzt.\n\nLe Crépuscule\n\nSur le pâle rivage de la mer je m’assis rêveur et solitaire. Le soleil déclinait et jetait des rayons ardents sur l’eau, et les blanches, larges vagues, poussées par le reflux, s’avançaient écumeuses et mugissantes. C’était un fracas étrange, un chuchotement et un sifflement, des rires et des murmures, des soupirs et des râles, entremêlés de sons caressants comme des chants de berceuses.—Il me semblait ouïr les récits du vieux temps, les charmants contes des féeries qu’autrefois, tout petit encore, j’entendais raconter aux enfants du voisinage alors que, par une soirée d’été, accroupis sur les degrés de pierre de la porte, nous écoutions en silence le narrateur, avec nos jeunes coeurs attentifs et nos yeux tout ouverts par la curiosité, pendant que les grandes filles, assises à la fenêtre au-dessus de nous, près des pots de fleurs odorantes, et semblables à des roses, souriaient aux lueurs du clair de lune.\n\nIt will be recognized that “Abenddämmerung” is in fact a mingling of sensations and memories in an aura of dream-like nostalgia. The poem expresses three distinct phases of time: the vantage point of the present; the retrospective account of events in the past; and the suggestion by these past events of a still more remote past, in the poet’s childhood. A similar movement may be noted in Mallarmé’s “Apparition,” all due allowance made for the more concrete and sensuous quality of Heine’s imagery. Nerval is not able to retain in French the vigorous power of compound words in German. Thus, Heine’s “wiegenliedheimliches Singen” (1. 10) is rendered by Nerval as “de sons caressants comme des chants de berceuses”; similarly, in the last line of the poem, “Lächelnd und mondbeglänzt” becomes “souriaient aux lueurs du clair de lune.” The active predication of Heine’s final lines is converted into a state or mode of being. Nerval’s static rendering of the poem reflects a more symbolist style than the original text would support.\n\nIt should be noted that while Heine was aware of Nerval’s inadequacies as a translator, he genuinely admired his renditions. In the preface to his collection, Poëmes et Légendes, penned shortly after Nerval’s death, Heine paid a moving tribute to his late friend and collaborator: “sans comprendre beaucoup la langue allemande, Gérard devinait mieux le sens d’une poésie écrite en allemand, que ceux qui avaient fait de cet idiome l’étude de toute leur vie.”8 It was Heine’s good fortune to attract the admiration and friendship of generous as well as gifted French poets.\n\nGautier was probably Heine’s most kindred spirit among his French friends, and more than once, over a period of several decades, he defended Heine as both man and poet against the calumny of detractors.9 In an essay published soon after Heine’s death, Gautier declared: “Nul écrivain n’eut à la fois tant de poésie et tant d’esprit.”10 He had read and reread Heine’s poetry and found that, even in prose translation, it moved and disturbed him in its mingling of love and death, nostalgia and suffering, the voluptuous and the exotic. Allusions to Heine’s poetry in essays on other poets make it clear that Gautier knew Heine’s work very well. Gautier’s special importance for the symbolists is attested to in many ways, in Baudelaire’s dedication of Les Fleurs du Mal, in his special praise of Gautier’s gift of correspondences, in Mallarmé’s noble tribute to Gautier in “Toast funèbre,”—“Magnifique, total et solitaire”—to cite only a few indications. His impact on the symbolists deserves more detailed study.11 Gautier’s role as champion of Heine in France is summed up eloquently by an account of Banville of a conversation with Gautier shortly before the latter’s death:\n\n—Enfin, dis-je à Gautier, … quel rang donnez-vous à Henri Heine, parmi les poètes contemporains?\n\n—Mais le premier! me répondit sans hésitation le divin Théo …12\n\nIt is noteworthy that Banville, one of the formative influences on Mallarmé and his contemporaries, shared the enthusiasm of Nerval and Gautier for Heine. Unlike them, he never met the German poet; yet he felt impelled to compose an elegy, “A Henri Heine,” published a week after Heine’s death.13 Banville sees death for Heine as a liberation and a transformation, the end of the poet’s suffering and his rejuvenation in the realm of pure music: “Tu montes dans l’azur en chantant des louanges!” For Banville, Heine is the greatest poet of the century after Victor Hugo:\n\nLa première fois que je lus L’Intermezzo, le plus beau poème d’amour qui ait jamais été écrit, il me sembla qu’un voile se déchirait devant mes yeux et que je voyais pour la première fois une chose longtemps rêvée et cherchée. Quoi! ce n’était pas un impossible désir! cela se pouvait donc, un poème exempt de toute convention et de toute rhétorique, où le chanteur est si sincère que, lorsqu’il me montre son coeur déchiré et saignant, je me sens en même temps inondé par le sang qui coule de mon coeur!14\n\nBanville’s appreciation of the sincerity and directness of Heine’s personal expression is characteristic of the response of French poets generally. Like his contemporaries, Banville prefers the Lyrisches Intermezzo to Heine’s other work. Again, Nerval’s translation played a decisive role in shaping French response. It is interesting to note that Banville saw Heine much as Baudelaire would view himself, as the poet of modern life. Heine, Banville insists, is “en même temps le plus parisien et le plus moderne des hommes.” His image of Heine is marked by a deep sense of the martyrdom of the modern poet in a society hostile or indifferent to his art. Heine’s physical infirmity in his last years as well as his exile from his native land served for Banville to invest him with exemplary significance. In a commemorative essay on Banville, Mallarmé raises the question: “Qui, des modernes, à côté ou comparable” and answers: “Je nomme Heine, sa lecture préférée, si autre!”15 For Mallarmé, only Poe among all other modern poets can be placed alongside Heine in relation to Banville.\n\nThese preferences clearly indicate that the symbolist poets and their predecessors looked on Heine as a fellow “poète maudit.” Heine himself was acutely conscious of the wretched lot of the modern German poet, doomed for the most part to a tragic fate. The conjunction of poetry and suffering, along with the figure of the poet as victim of exile, made Heine particularly sympathetic to the symbolists and helped to invest him with broad representative significance.\n\nDuring the 1850s and 1860s it would have been virtually impossible for any reader in France concerned with poetry to escape the presence of Heine. Largely owing to the labors of Saint-René Taillandier, substantial selections of both poetry and prose appeared in several issues of the Revue des Deux Mondes. All during the 1860s Michel Lévy was publishing volumes of Heine in French translation, so that in 1867 Sainte-Beuve could write of him: “Il est fort à la mode en ce moment chez nous.”16 Heine provided the French reading public with an abundance and variety of both poetry and prose in harmonious accord with the emerging literary values of the later nineteenth century.\n\nThe response of Baudelaire to Heine is more ambivalent than that of his predecessors and also more intricate, for it is in Baudelaire’s critical statements that Heine emerges as a major force in the assimilation of the symbolist aesthetics of German Romanticism.17 Baudelaire was familiar with Heine’s poetry and had read much of Heine’s prose, in translation. The similarities and parallels between Baudelaire and Heine are striking,18 and Baudelaire late in life may have been aware of them: a common irony, ambiguity, and alienation; a preoccupation with the themes of unfulfillment, death, and decay; and a consequent melancholy and brooding pessimism. Yet, despite these affinities, Heine is not a major force in shaping Baudelaire’s poetics or poetry. His art and thought have none of the seminal importance for Baudelaire of Hugo, Poe, or Gautier, to cite only a few. The similarities of Heine and Baudelaire are far more impressive than any conscious affiliation or influence in their relationship. For Baudelaire, Heine was but one of many figures on the literary scene, not always of immediate or central interest, but striking and worthy of attention.\n\nAmong Heine’s first journalistic activities in Paris were chronicles for German newspapers, subsequently collected in the volume, De la France (Paris, 1833). These essays included an account of the Salon of 1831, which Baudelaire read with care by way of preparing himself to write his Salons of 1845 and 1846. In the first of these, Heine is quoted only briefly, but in the second, he is cited at great length by way of illustrating and clarifying Baudelaire’s aesthetic premises and Delacroix’s method. The crucial passage, taken from Heine’s essay on Decamps in the Salon of 1831, reads as follows:\n\nVoici quelques lignes de M. Henri Heine qui expliquent assez bien la méthode de Delacroix, méthode qui est, comme chez tous les hommes vigoureusement constitués, le résultat de son tempérament: “En fait d’art, je suis surnaturaliste. Je crois que l’artiste ne peut trouver dans la nature tous ses types, mais que les plus remarquables lui sont révélés dans son âme, comme la symbolique innée d’idées innées, et au même instant.”19\n\nIt is interesting to note that in his review of De la France in 1833, Sainte-Beuve praised Heine for his magical and symbolizing power and cited the very passage alluded to by Baudelaire;20 however, Sainte-Beuve quotes Heine incompletely in a way that Baudelaire does not.21 Clearly, Baudelaire read the French text of Heine’s Salon, and we may assume that he gave careful attention to the whole of Heine’s discussion of artistic creativity and judgment.\n\nMuch of what Heine asserts in his essay on Decamps must have served to confirm concepts that Baudelaire derived from Diderot, Sainte-Beuve, or Poe, among a variety of sources, or that he developed for himself. Thus, Heine insists on the supreme role of the imagination in artistic creation.22 Works must be judged in relation to the artist’s aims and imagination, rather than according to abstract rules. Each truly great artist, Heine declares, creates his own aesthetic; his artistry must therefore be viewed in relation to the adequacy of his artistic means.\n\nIt is in elaborating the artist’s means that Heine sets forth a symbolist aesthetic that was by then commonplace in German Romanticism but was only beginning to gain ground in France: “Sons et paroles, couleurs et formes, le visible surtout, ne sont pourtant que des symboles de l’idée, symboles qui naissent dans l’âme de l’artiste quand il est agité par le saint-esprit du monde; ses æuvres ne sont que des symboles à l’aide desquels il communique aux autres âmes ses propres idées.”23 It is shortly after this general account of artistic works as symbols that Heine asserts, in the passage cited by Baudelaire, that the artist’s models are revealed in his soul “comme la symbolique innée d’idées innées, et au même instant.”\n\nWe should look more closely at Heine’s vocabulary and his concept of the symbolic character of artistic expression in order to appreciate the importance of Baudelaire’s appropriation of Heine’s thought. Not only is Heine arguing for the artist’s complete imaginative freedom; he is also asserting, in this essay, the essential spirituality of art in the language of transcendental idealism. This is perhaps evident in the German text of the passage cited above in French: “Töne und Worte, Farben und Formen, das Erscheinende überhaupt, sind jedoch nur Symbole der Idee, Symbole, die in dem Gemüthe des Künstlers aufsteigen, wenn es der heilige Weltgeist bewegt….”24 Underlying Heine’s aesthetic is the Neo-Kantian concept of the autonomy of the symbol. More precisely, the cosmic origin of works of art as “Symbole der Idee” is strikingly suggestive of Schelling’s philosophy of art, despite Heine’s denigration of Schelling in Zur Geschichte der Religion und Philosophie in Deutschland.\n\nFor Schelling, an Idea is an objective reflection of the Absolute. This reflection must perforce be symbolic. Art, which Schelling defines as the finite representation of the infinite, reveals Absolute form only in symbols. Art in the modern world fulfills the function of mythology in the ancient world. As Schelling points out in his Vorlesungen über die Methode des akademischen Studiums (1803), “Die Mythologie der Griechen war eine geschlossene Welt von Symbolen der Ideen.”25 Similarly, in the essay, “Philosophie und Religion” (1804), Schelling declares: “Wahre Mythologie ist eine Symbolik der Ideen….”26 Schelling’s definition of the relationship of symbol and myth was taken over by Friedrich Creuzer in his Symbolik und Mythologie der alten Völker, besonders der Griechen (1810), wherein the symbol is defined as the visible representation of the Idea or, as Creuzer puts it, “der verkörperten Idee.”27 The translation into French of Creuzer’s work by J. D. Guigniaut, published as Religions de l’antiquité in 1825 and 1829 with extensive commentary by the translator, is of central importance in the development of the aesthetic of French symbolism.28 For Creuzer, the symbol is distinct from allegory in being self-constitutive: “le symbole est l’idée même, rendue sensible et personnifiée.”29 The same notion of the autonomy of the symbol, “die Existenz der Idee selbst,” again probably derived from Schelling, occurs in Solger’s Vorlesungen über Ästhetik (1829), in a philosophical context more appealing to Heine than that of Schelling.30 That Baudelaire was aware of the historical and philosophical background of the passage he cited from Heine may be doubted, but there can be no question of Heine’s reflection of currents of transcendental idealism in his assertion of the autonomy of the symbol and the spirituality of art. These concepts confirmed and supported an aesthetic that Baudelaire developed from a wide variety of philosophical, religious, and literary sources. Heine’s “supernaturalism” in his essay on Decamps is at a far remove from the Swedenborgian mysticism that Baudelaire also appropriated and used for his own ends, for Heine is concerned essentially with the relationship of art to nature in the process of artistic creation. It is significant that Baudelaire could adopt Heine’s views without in any way repudiating his own reliance on a mystical theory of the nature and function of poetic creation. Apart from Novalis, German Romantic symbolism is generally philosophical rather than mystical, viewing symbols as expressions of mental processes rather than as magical signs or hieroglyphs. In Baudelaire, in part through the mediation of Heine, a Neo-Platonic and mystical tradition of symbolic speculation is reinforced by the formulations of Neo-Kantian idealism. The fact that Neo-Platonic concepts dominated symbolist aesthetics in France does not diminish the importance of German Romantic symbolism as part of the groundwork of modern French poetry.\n\nBaudelaire’s subsequent attitudes toward Heine are quite varied. In an essay of 1852, “L’Ecole païenne,” Baudelaire sharply attacked the divorce between literature and religion, which he saw as increasingly dominant in the modern world. The celebration of antique beauty and pagan sensuality, which he decries in this essay, is not wholly absent in Baudelaire’s earlier writings,31 but here he strikes out vigorously at contemporary notions of l’art pour l’art. It is altogether likely that this attack was aimed at Nerval and Banville, as well as other contemporaries, but the chief object of condemnation is Heine, and the empty paganism of the day “est le fait d’un homme qui a trop lu et mal lu Henri Heine et sa littérature pourrie de sentimentalisme matérialiste.”32 This is not Baudelaire at his critical best. Clearly, Heine’s anti-clericalism infuriated him. Despite his praise for Voltaire over Heine, Baudelaire had no sympathy with the Voltairean and libertarian aspects of Heine’s art. Heine’s spacious conception of the poet combined social and political functions with the notion of the poet as prophet and seer. Baudelaire could accept the poet as “mage” far more readily than the poet as revolutionary, yet his subsequent writings make it clear that he admired Heine as a poet even while rejecting his critique of religion. In his “Exposition Universelle 1855,” Baudelaire draws on Heine in deriding doctrinaire aestheticians and refers to Heine as “ce charmant esprit, qui serait un génie s’il se tournait plus souvent vers le divin.”33 We do not know if Baudelaire and Heine ever met, but they had many friends and literary relationships in common, and it is reasonable to suppose that Baudelaire was aware of Heine, not only through the efforts of Nerval and Gautier and the pages of the Revue des Deux Mondes, but also in the translation of Intermezzo by Paul Ristelhuber, published by Poulet-Malassis in 1857. A sense of kinship with Heine must have grown on Baudelaire during the last years of his life, for among his last projected writings was a response to an essay by Jules Janin on Heine, drafted by Baudelaire in February 1865. Baudelaire decries Janin’s attack on Heine as both man and poet, and the critic’s condemnation of Heine’s preoccupation with death, suffering, and the transience of human existence. For Baudelaire, Heine’s difficult personality is part of his character as a poet. France, he insists, has very few poets; “elle n’en a pas un seul à opposer à Henri Heine.”34 This final judgment of Baudelaire reflects the growing awareness in France, in the years immediately preceding and following Heine’s death, of the originality and richness of his achievement. Baudelaire defends Heine’s character with the same justification he had employed for Poe: “genus irritabile vatum.”35 For Baudelaire as for Mallarmé, Heine and Poe are conjoined as representatives of the modern poet.\n\nMallarmé’s response to Heine illustrates the continuing fascination with the author of Intermezzo of the generation of poets that followed Baudelaire. The young Mallarmé was an avid reader of the poetry of his day, English and German as well as French, and he seems to have read and reread translations of Heine around 1860.36 Mallarmé alludes to Heine briefly in a letter of April 1864, and more extensively in a letter of May of the following year in acknowledging poems of his friend, Henri Cazalis: “Je ne t’ai rien dit de charmants poèmes amoureux que tu m’as envoyés en avril, je les adore dans leur brièveté, à l’égal des délicieux soupirs de Heine.”37 These remarks would suggest that Mallarmé, like other French poets, responded most fully in Heine’s work to the Lyrisches Intermezzo. He owned a copy of translations of Heine’s poetry, probably Poëmes et Légendes (1855), which he lent to his friend Des Essarts, and presumably to other young poets as well. In a letter to Mallarmé of October 1864, Des Essarts alludes to Heine’s appealing mixture of humor and melancholy.38 Heine for Mallarmé and his confrères was essentially a lyric poet of simple and tender feeling, although there is evidence that Mallarmé knew his satirical work from an allusion to Atta Troll in “Un spectacle interrompu,” written perhaps several years before its publication in 1875.39 In later years, Mallarmé does not seem to have reread Heine frequently, but it is evident that Heine was a continuing part of his literary experience and came to be viewed by him as a classic poet. This is apparent from a letter to Dr. Thomas W. Evans, friend of Mallarmé’s admired Méry Laurent and translator of Heine’s memoirs into English. In thanking Dr. Evans for a copy of the Heine volume, Mallarmé declares: “l’homme et le poëte que fut Heine s’entourent de notre sympathie à ce point que toute page retrouvée prend, pour nous, l’importance exquise d’une relique.”40 Dr. Evans’s translation included a long and detailed introductory essay, illuminating Heine by way of a sustained comparison with Byron that Mallarmé especially praised, and describing the gothic and macabre elements in Heine’s work as “manifested in a like manner only perhaps in some of the poems of Edgar A. Poe.”41 Mallarmé himself conjoined Heine and Poe in his essay of 1892 on Banville. Evans’s account of Heine’s life in France, his role in the French literary scene, and his stature as “the greatest poet of modern Germany” cannot have failed to arrest Mallarmé’s attention. For Mallarmé, “cet admirable lyrique,” like Poe, is an enduring part of the pantheon of letters.\n\nWhile Mallarmé came to view Heine as an exemplary poet, Mallarmé’s poetry does not seem to be profoundly marked by Heine’s art. Mailarmé’s best-known early poems are strikingly Baudelairean in theme and style, but Heine’s ironic and parodistic vein may be seen in early occasional poems, such as “Contre un poëte parisien.”42 Mallarmé’s later poetry with its intricate syntax and complex interiorization of experience is stylistically quite apart from Heine’s work, but there may be underlying similarities between Mallarmé’s probing examination of philosophical ultimates in his magnificent tombeaux, and Heine’s anguished interrogation into the meaning of existence in the poetry written near the very end of his life. It may well be that Mallarmé compared Banville to Heine because he had heard Banville speak of Heine as among his favorite poets. For Mallarmé, Heine and Banville, like Hugo and Poe and indeed all great poets, testify to man’s spirituality and transforming power: “La divine transposition, pour l’accomplissement de quoi existe l’homme, va du fait à l’idéal.”43 This idealization is the poet’s office, a celebration of the mystery and grandeur of existence. Heine for Mallarmé is unmistakably a descendent of “notre aïeul Orphée,” a permanent part of man’s poetic endeavor and achievement.\n\nWe should note in passing the limited but real impact of Heine on members of Mallarmé’s poetic circle. During the early 1860s Catulle Mendès translated Heine’s dramatic works and imitated his love poems.44 Mallarmé’s lifelong friend, Villiers de l’Isle-Adam, emulated Heine’s Romantic manner in many of his ealy poems, with their themes of martyrdom, exile, and unfulfilled love. Villiers’s early poetry is simple and transparent, closer in manner to Hugo or Musset than to Mallarmé. The last poem in the series, “Les Préludes,” begins with an epigraph from Heine’s Intermezzo, but the fascination of vice and the abyss, as well as the poet’s acute sense of the flight of time and his consciousness of his own damnation, all point more immediately to Baudelaire as the dominant source of inspiration. Heine is but one of many examples animating the young Villiers, a model of genuine but partial and transient import.\n\nThe relationship of Verlaine to Heine is more complex. Not only through the poetry of Mendès, but directly, as part of voluminous reading in his youth, Verlaine acquired a familiarity with Heine’s poetry.45 A good deal of the writing of both poets is in the vein of popular poetry. Many of their poems share a naive simplicity, tenderness, and charm. The frank assertion of passion, the direct expression of the poet’s longings and sufferings, the feelings of nostalgia and regret for a vanished moment of delight, all point to a deep affinity between Heine and Verlaine.46 Camille Mauclair has insisted that Verlaine’s essential role in France is as a continuator of Heine in a poetry of open subjectivity and musicality, combining the resources of folk poetry and the lyric of personal artistry.47 It is reasonable to suppose that Heine’s example helped significantly to shape Verlaine’s art at the beginning of the latter’s career, although Verlaine’s first volume, Les Poèmes saturniens (1866), seems on the whole less personal than Heine’s love lyrics. Verlaine’s later work is more consciously concerned with delicate nuances of feeling and mood creation in a manner that only partially resembles Heine’s more direct mode of utterance. Verlaine seems to have viewed Heine in the same way as did many of his elder contemporaries, as a poète maudit. In an essay on Baudelaire of 1865, Verlaine declares that in his extreme sensitivity and nervousness, Baudelaire exceeds even Heine.48 For the young Verlaine, both poets incarnate the turbulent and anguished spirit of modernity, in a society in which dream and art are separated and in which the poet must pursue pure beauty in the realm of the ideal. Verlaine’s conception of the poet’s nature and function is more restricted than that of Heine, yet quite apart from any question of imitation or influence, both poets share common themes and processes to a markedly significant degree.\n\nMost of the symbolist poets read Heine solely in translation, and most of them regarded Heine largely as the poet of the Lyrisches Intermezzo. The most striking exception to this tendency is Jules Laforgue. Not only did Laforgue read and cite Heine in German; he drew consciously on the ironic, satiric, and parodistic manner of Heine, which is on the whole more typical of his art than the early poetry in the Romantic sentimental mode. The lively conversational and colloquial idiom of Laforgue, along with his spirited irony and deft humor, is in no way representative of the poetry of the young symbolists who followed Mallarmé. Laforgue’s participation in the symbolist enterprise is more apparent in his personal relationships and in his aesthetic speculations than in his poetic style. The distance between Laforgue and the more conventional symbolists is indicated in part by their very different appreciations of Heine. In an early poem, “Epicuréisme,” published in the Toulouse weekly, La Guêpe in 1879, Laforgue describes the lighthearted vagabondage of a flâneur in Paris, whose preferred reading includes Heine:\n\n“Ce buffon de génie” a dit Schopenhauer\n\nQui sanglote et sourit, mais d’un sourire amer!49\n\nLaforgue’s early image of Heine is in part that of a buffoon or a pierrot, akin perhaps to Laforgue’s image of himself or of the poet generally. In both Paris and Berlin, Laforgue was an admiring and impassioned reader of Heine. In closing a letter of December 1880 to Gustave Kahn, he declares: “Je vous quitte pour relire mon ami H. Heine,”50 and in a letter from Berlin to Charles Henry in December 1881, Laforgue quotes in German from three of the poems in the Lyrisches Intermezzo, all expressive of the longing for love, and speaks of his heart as “Pourri, pourri de tristesse.”51 The mockery, irreverence, playfulness, and whimsy of Laforgue’s Complaintes led reviewers of his poetry and prose poems to compare him to Heine.52 Mauclair subsequently declared categorically: “l’ironie de Jules Laforgue est issue de celle de Heine, et Laforgue, s’il eût vécu plus longtemps, eût été le Heine français.”53 Whether Laforgue thought of himself as “the French Heine” may be doubted. Warren Ramsey has concluded, more cautiously: “It is impossible to say whether years of development, filling in youthfully spare outlines, would have given to Laforgue’s works the substance of Heine’s; but at least he was of the same race of poets.”54 While Laforgue is essentially more personal, less political or social in his satiric poetry than Heine, their similarities in tone and style are real and pervasive.55 It is not surprising to find the French poet’s sympathy for Heine embracing the man as well as his work. In notes for an unwritten essay on Baudelaire, Laforgue contends that the poet of Les Fleurs du Mal created a manner in keeping with the ideal of Poe and literary martyrdom, while Heine endured his martyrdom intensely and fully, without Baudelaire’s obsessive self-consciousness: “pour bien le comprendre songez un instant au pôle opposé, à l’enfant malade et christ—point créole—mais ayant vraiment sondé la pensée philosophique humaine—obéissant à ses crises, pas de pose, pas maître de lui-même—Heine.”56 It is striking to note that for Laforgue, Heine and Baudelaire are at opposite extremes as men and as poets, the one yielding to the crises and pain of existence, the other imposing a manner as a shield to mitigate the harshness of reality. Laforgue’s admiration of Heine for having plumbed the depths of human philosophic thought may well refer to the Heine of the Romanzero and Das Buch Lazarus, to the poet’s heroic confrontation of the meaning of life and death at the ultimate margin of existence, wherein perhaps his greatest literary achievement is to be found.\n\nWe do wrong to both Heine and ourselves to view him simply as a French symbolist avant la lettre. Despite abundant parallels in themes and styles, Heine is in important ways quite different from the French symbolists. In particular, he does not seem to have shared the recurrent mystical and esoteric view of poetry pervading the symbolist tradition. To be sure, Heine was aware of the role of mystery, suggestiveness, and musicality as poetic techniques, but nowhere does he seem to elaborate an account of these processes as part of a formulated credo or program. Heine’s awareness of spiritual themes and implications in poetry is quite independent of the Neo-Platonic mysticism that symbolist aesthetics reflects. On the other hand, the fascination of Heine for the French symbolists and their genuine admiration of his art point to the profoundly human commitment of both Heine and the symbolists. Contrary to fashionable misconceptions of the French symbolists, they did not reject the claims of perceptible reality or the here and now, any more than did Heine reject universal values in the name of an obsessive preoccupation with political and social issues of his day. The symbolists and their predecessors may have selected and absorbed those values of Heine’s art that corresponded most closely to their own needs and predilections, but this selectivity is a necessary part of the way in which all literature is assimilated and transformed. It is in large measure through the efforts of a gifted line of French poets, from Nerval to Laforgue and beyond, that Heine has become not only a German but also a European poet, calling on us to participate in the great tradition of European and world literature. This tradition Heine enriched and ennobled magnificently.\n\nNOTES\n\n1 See Louis P.
