        "text": "Three private Christian schools are suing Gov. Kate Brown, challenging her executive order limiting faith-based gatherings of more than 25 people due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHorizon Christian School, McMinnville Christian Academy and Life Christian School filed the suit on Monday, calling Brown's executive orders \"unconstitutional.\"\n\nThe suit claims that Brown violated the First Amendment by saying public universities can remain open for in-person classes if they comply with safety measures, while houses of worship and faith-based gatherings are still limited.\n\nThey claim there are no differences between these two types of gatherings.\n\nHorizon Christian School, McMinnville Christian Academy and Life Christian School also argue that the schools would lose money if they cannot continue in-person classes.\n\nCourt documents say the schools also believe “Students cannot truly learn the Christian faith from home without forfeiting many of the great spiritual and religious benefits and comforts they receive from Plaintiffs.”\n\nThey add “Zoom meetings are not the same as attending a Christian school in person in fellowship with other students and the faculty.”\n\nThe schools are seeking a court order to reopen later this month or in September with proper physical distancing, mask wearing and other safety measures in place.\n\nChris Shortell, a professor at Portland State University, says it's unlikely the lawsuit will reverse the governor's order.\n\n\"It’s difficult for me to see a federal district court judge in Oregon agreeing with the arguments,\" said Shortell. \"We will see what the state's response is. They’ll file a response, but my guess is that they are going to push heavily for a change between K-12 education and higher-ed.\"\n\nWe have reached out to the governor's office for comment and have not heard back."
