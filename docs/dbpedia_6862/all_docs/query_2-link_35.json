        "text": "College-Level Courses\n\nExpectations for dual-credit courses are higher than for other courses in your high school. You will be taking college-level courses and your teacher will expect the same quality of work from you as we do from students on an Ivy Tech campus.\n\nYou Choose: Career-Focused Courses and General Education\n\nCourses are offered in a wide variety of subjects, including:\n\nCareer and technical education (CTE) – manufacturing, healthcare, and information technology\n\nGeneral education – English, mathematics, social and behavioral sciences, life and physical sciences, and humanities/arts\n\nCourse List\n\nEvery high school partner offers a different combination of dual credit courses across a variety of subjects. To see which classes are available at your high school, contact your high school guidance counselor. If you’d like to get an idea of the types of courses that might be available, click the link below to see the dual credit courses being taught at high schools around Indiana this year.\n\nView Dual Credit Course List\n\nCore Transfer Library (CTL)\n\nOur high school partners commonly offer courses that are part of the Core Transfer Library (CTL), which is a list of pre-approved courses that transfer between all Indiana public colleges and universities.\n\nStart College as a Sophomore: Indiana College Core\n\nMany of the dual credit courses offered are also part of the Indiana College Core. The core consists of a block of 30 hours of transferable college credit covering six different academic categories that fulfill general education requirements for a bachelor’s degree. Any student who satisfactorily completes the core can transfer that coursework to another public college or university in Indiana.\n\nAt Ivy Tech, we also call this approach “Start as a Sophomore” because the completion of these 30 credit hours allows you to start your college education as a sophomore at any public (and many private) Indiana four-year college or university.\n\nDeveloped to NACEP Standards\n\nTo ensure high-quality dual credit coursework, Ivy Tech aligns its policies and practices with the National Alliance of Concurrent Enrollment Partnerships (NACEP). NACEP is a national accrediting body with standards that ensure the academic rigor of dual credit courses and their alignment with on-campus programming while advancing college in high school initiatives and policy.\n\nEvery participating high school works with its nearby Ivy Tech campus to develop the list of dual credit courses it will offer and the short-term and long-term certificates from Ivy Tech that its high school students can pursue. Check with your high school counselor to see what your options are.\n\nBelow are some examples of Ivy Tech credentials for which many of our dual credit high school partners offer courses:\n\nSHORT-TERM CERTIFICATES\n\nMany of the certificates you can earn while attending Ivy Tech in high school align with career and technical education (CTE) pathways and Indiana’s Next Level Jobs program, which prepares students for high-wage, high-demand jobs in Indiana.\n\nExample short-term certificates you can earn:\n\nPre-Nursing Studies - Students pursuing this 18-credit-hour track can graduate with the qualifications to become a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA), or apply directly to the Ivy Tech Nursing program right after high school.\n\nMedical Assisting - Students can pursue one of three 18-credit-hour certificates in the Ivy Tech Medical Assisting program, including Medical Office Administration, Medical Scribe Professional, or Outpatient Insurance Coding.\n\nIndustrial Technology - Ivy Tech offers 4 different 18-credit-hour certificates in this area, including Industrial Coatings and Finishes, Industrial Electrical, Industrial Mechanical, Materials Technology, along with Structural Welding for 21 credit hours.\n\nInformatics - Be a part of this growing industry by pursuing an Informatics (20 credits) or Salesforce Administrator (22 credits) certificate.\n\nBusiness Administration - Ivy Tech offers a variety of short-term certificates related to business, ranging from 9-21 credits each. Highlights include Digital Marketing, Human Resources Management, Business Information Technology, and Insurance.\n\nLONG-TERM CERTIFICATE\n\nIndiana College Core - Many high school students taking classes at Ivy Tech pursue the Indiana College Core. The core consists of a block of 30 hours of transferable college credit covering six different academic categories that fulfill general education requirements for a bachelor’s degree. The six categories are written communication, speaking and listening, quantitative reasoning, scientific ways of knowing, and social and behavioral ways of knowing. Any student who satisfactorily completes the core can transfer that coursework to another public college or university in Indiana.\n\nWe’ve put together a handy checklist (PDF) to help track a student’s progress toward the Indiana College core:\n\nVIEW INDIANA COLLEGE CORE CREDIT CHECKLIST\n\nCAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION CAREER GUIDE\n\nNot sure which career direction to head? We understand that choosing a career pathway can be difficult work. Check out this helpful, easy-to-read career guide (in the format of an online flip book) developed by the Indiana Governor’s Workforce Cabinet. It contains information to help you navigate your way through your career and technical education (CTE) choices and descriptions for 15 different in-demand fields in Indiana.\n\nVIEW CAREER GUIDE\n\nCollege Readiness\n\nSome dual credit courses require students to submit qualifying score(s) before they are deemed “college-ready.” Depending on the course, this college-ready score could be:\n\nA PSAT 10 score, SAT score, or ACT score\n\nA cumulative GPA of 2.6 or higher for juniors and seniors\n\nNOTE: GPA alone will not qualify students for: MATH 135, 136, 137, 201, 211, 212, CHEM 101, PHYS 101, or SDEV 140.\n\nKnowledge Assessment\n\nIf you do not have previous college credit, an ACT, SAT or PSAT score, or a cumulative high school GPA that satisfies the assessment requirement, you will need to complete the Knowledge Assessment. The Knowledge Assessment assesses your level in reading, writing, and mathematics. The assessment is free and your score will be accepted up to four years after you take the assessment.\n\nTo learn how to access Knowledge Assessment through your student MyIvy account to meet prerequisite requirements for dual credit courses, watch this helpful video tutorial:\n\nHow to Use the Knowledge Assessment Tool\n\nView Knowledge Assessment Instructions (PDF)\n\nPrerequisites\n\nA prerequisite is a requirement that a student must have taken prior to enrolling in a specific course or program. Some dual credit courses require students to take prerequisites before they can register for a course. Prerequisites vary by course and some courses do not have prerequisites, so it’s important to work with a high school or Ivy Tech staff member who can assist you.\n\nSee the Dual Credit Prerequisite Chart for a complete list of the prerequisite courses and qualifying scores for each dual credit course.\n\n1.

All requirements and deadlines are aligned to ensure high quality for the student. Course content is identical to on-campus offerings and incorporates the same syllabi, class assignments, and examinations while utilizing comparable textbooks. Dual credit can be run simultaneously with AP classes to ensure students have an option; however, two separate college partners can’t run a simultaneous dual credit class at the high school.\n\nCourses are Free\n\nNo tuition is charged to students or to the school. Ivy Tech covers the cost.\n\nMemorandums of Understanding\n\nHigh schools must complete agreements (memorandums of understanding) with local Ivy Tech campuses in order for courses to be offered for dual credit.\n\nView 2023-2024 Memorandum of Understanding Template\n\nIvy Tech Dual Credit Crosswalk\n\nIvy Tech Community College works with Indiana high schools to deliver college-level courses that align with high school standards.
