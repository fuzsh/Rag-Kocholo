I especially appreciate their focus on social emotional learning, their mindfulness curriculum, and their proactive use of conflict resolution among students.\n\nBeth Hillel Day School\n\nValley Village\n\nWebsite: www.tbhla.com\n\nGrades Served: Elementary school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: General population with no specific support but does well for certainNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted, ASD, ADHD, learning differences, 2e / twice exceptional, behavioral challenges\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good teacher to student ratio, use of technology to support different learning styles, teachers have experience with differently wired learners, opportunities for parent education\n\nBridges Academy\n\nStudio City\n\nWebsite: www.bridges.edu\n\nGrades Served: Elementary, middle school, high school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical children\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted, ASD, ADHD, learning disabilities, 2e / twice exceptional\n\nCurriculum: Progressive, strength-based, 2e expert\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good teacher to student ratio, speech language pathologist or occupational therapists on site, social skills groups, executive function coaching, alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), use of technology to support different learning styles, teachers have experience with differently wired learners, opportunities for parent education\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nThis school has changed my child’s life. Bridges is a truly safe and welcoming space for 2e kids, where they are finally free to be exactly who they are without worrying about how others see them, and where they are fully supported in their academic endeavors.\n\nOnly here a year and while it has been bumpy they have held our hands during the bumpy parts and assured us they are on our and our son’s side even when his anxiety kept him from attending school regularly.\n\nBig Minds Unschool\n\nPinole, Pleasanton\n\nWebsite: www.bigmindsunschool.org\n\nGrades Served: Elementary school, middle school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students, inclusion program with extra support for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: 2e/twice exceptional\n\nCurriculum: Unschooling, student-led schoolingSchool Features: Small class size, Good teacher to student ratio, Social skills groups, Executive function coaching, Alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), Use of technology to support differently learning styles, Teachers have experience with differently wired learners, Opportunities for parent education, Teachers are trained in social emotional processing issues kids can have.\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nThis school has made a huge difference for my child. He is exceptionally gifted and has exceptional learning differences, which made schooling frustrating at its best and demoralizing at its worst. Big Minds has made a huge change in him, even in how he views himself. When the teachers talk about the whole child, they really mean it. They support the peaks and valleys of an asynchronous child in a way I have never seen a school do.\n\nThe Burkard School\n\nSan Mateo\n\nWebsite: www.theburkardschool.org\n\nGrades Served: Elementary school, middle school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: ASD, ADHD, Anxiety, 2e/twice exceptional\n\nSchool Features:Specializing in self-regulation, class size no larger than 10 students, good staff to student ratio, each classroom has a general education teacher and a designated Behavioral Specialist\n\nChartwell School\n\nSeaside\n\nWebsite: www.chartwell.org\n\nGrades Served: Elementary school, middle school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted, ADHD, learning differences, 2e / twice exceptional, behavioral challenges\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good student to teach ratio, speech language pathologist or occupational therapists on site, social skills groups, executive function coaching, use of technology to support different learning styles, alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), teachers have experience with differently wired learners, opportunities for parent education\n\nThe Children’s Place Montessori School\n\nTorrance\n\nWebsite: www.childrensplaceschool.com\n\nGrades Served: Preschool, elementary school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: General population with no specific support but does well for certainNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted, ASD, ADHD, learning disabilities, 2e / twice exceptional, behavioral challenges\n\nCurriculum: Montessori\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good teacher to student ratio, alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), teachers have experience with differently wired learners\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nMy 2e kid (dyslexic) loved the self directed nature of the Montessori approach and the fact that there were multiple ways to learn and show her creativity. The school is a micro school with no more than 20 kids and two teachers. It was a mixed age classroom with grades 1-6 in the one room classroom. There was no homework which allowed her to pursue a more balanced lifestyle of after school enrichment activities. The principal is an amazingly gifted teacher who knows how to work with neurodivergent children. She is also the main teacher in that school.\n\nChime Institute\n\nNorthridge\n\nWoodland Hills\n\nWebsite: www.chimeinstitute.org\n\nGrades Served: Preschool, elementary school, middle school\n\nType of School: Charter\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Inclusion program with extra support for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted, ASD, ADHD, learning differences, 2e / twice exceptional, behavioral challenges\n\nCompass High School\n\nSan Mateo\n\nWebsite: www.compasshigh.org\n\nGrades Served: High school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted, ADHD, learning differences, 2e / twice exceptional\n\nCurriculum:Supportive, individualized approach not only includes a college preparatory program, but also offers students and their families integrated services and support\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good teacher to student ratio, speech language pathologist or occupational therapist on site, social skills group, executive function coaching, use of technology to support different learning styles, teachers have experience with differently wired learners, opportunities for parent education\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nThis school has changed my child’s life.\n\nBridges is a truly safe and welcoming space for 2e kids, where they are finally free to be exactly who they are without worrying about how others see them, and where they are fully supported in their academic endeavors.\n\nCORE Education Academy\n\nConcord\n\nWebsite: www.coreacademy.net\n\nGrades Served: 3rd – 8th Grades\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted, ASD, ADHD, 2e / twice exceptional, Learning differences, Anxiety\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, Good teacher to student ratio, Social skills groups, Executive function coaching, Alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), Teachers have experience with differently wired learners, Educational psychologist on staff\n\nCreative Arts Charter School\n\nSan Francisco\n\nWebsite: www.creativeartscharter.org\n\nGrades Served: Elementary school, middle school\n\nType of School: Charter\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: General population with no specific support but does well for certain kids\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted, ASD, ADHD, 2e / twice exceptional\n\nSchool Features: Alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), use of technology to support different learning styles, teachers have experience with differently wired learners, differentiated homework for dyslexia and ADHD\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nAfter homeschooling for a couple of years my son wanted to attend middle school.

Wonderful teachers, excellent administrators, and a great relationship with the school district. They handle their own transportation with mini vans. Great for kids who are nervous on the bus.\n\nFusion Academy\n\nBay Area: Los Gatos, Palo Alto, San Francisco, San Mateo, Marin, Berkeley, Walnut Creek\n\nLos Angeles Area: Rancho Palos Verdes, Los Angeles, Pasadena, Miracle Mile, South Bay, Warner Center\n\nOrange County Area: Huntington Beach, Mission Viejo\n\nSan Diego Area: Solana Beach, San Diego\n\nWebsite: www.fusionacademy.com\n\nGrades Served: Middle school, high school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted, ASD, ADHD, learning differences, 2e / twice exceptional, behavioral challenges\n\nCurriculum: Love, Motivate, Teach\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good teacher to student ratio, executive function coaching, alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), use of technology to support different learning styles, teachers have experience with differently wired learners, opportunities for parent education\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nMy daughter struggled with anxiety, ADD and executive functioning as soon as she started middle school. The pace was so fast and every day she went to school she was further behind & more confused. So she refused to go. We did a tour/open house at Fusion and she walked out saying, “This where I want to go to school. When can I start?” The down side is that some children are there because of behavioral issues, not because of learning issues. But that’s real-world and the school is very responsive. It’s a very creative atmosphere with young, friendly teachers. Also to note, the teachers need only a BA to work there. Technically not a certified therapy school, so it’s not always easy to get your school district to help with tuition, which is high.\n\nFrostig School\n\nPasadena, West LA\n\nWebsite: www.frostigschool.org\n\nGrades Served: Elementary school, middle school, high school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: ASD, ADHD, learning differences, 2e / twice exceptional, behavioral challenges,\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good teacher to student ratio, social skills groups, speech language pathologist or occupational therapists on site, teachers have experience with differently wired learners, opportunities for parent education\n\nGoogle Children’s Center\n\nEast Palo Alto\n\nGrades Served: Elementary school, middle school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Inclusion program with extra support for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: ASD, ADHD, behavioral challenges\n\nCurriculum: Reggio Emilia\n\nSchool Features: Good teacher to student ratio, social skills groups, use of technology to support different learning styles, teachers have experience with differently wired learners, opportunities for parent education\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nGoogle Children’s Center has an experienced preschool teacher who became the Center’s Inclusion Program Manager. The school’s handbook has a 2-page explanation of inclusion and concrete examples of what accommodations have been used to enhance the school-parent-student partnership. Strong accountability with team meetings at least one a month to check-in on student with parents. The school’s mission is of course to serve the student’s needs but also to allow parents bring their best selves to work. Strong peace of mind. This is available as an employee benefit but it’s oversubscribed by lottery and waitlist starting with babies at 4 months old.\n\nThe Help Group\n\nLos Angeles\n\nWebsite: www.thehelpgroup.org\n\nGrades Served: Preschool, elementary school, middle school, high school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted, ASD, ADHD, learning differences, 2e / twice exceptional, behavioral challenges\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good teacher to student ratio, speech language pathologist or occupational therapists on site, alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), teachers have experience with differently wired learners\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nThe school takes private pay tuition and also takes NPS referrals. They have about 7-8 different campuses for a variety of special needs populations. Some of their programs work well for some students, it depends on the needs and the fit. I thought the admin would be more supportive but it was the same resistance I had received in the public school system. It was a better fit for my son but still stressful for me.\n\nHilldale School\n\nDaly City\n\nWebsite: www.hilldaleschool.org\n\nGrades Served: Elementary school, middle school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted, 2e / twice exceptional\n\nCurriculum: Hilldale is academically-accelerated to meet the needs of bright and gifted kids, but it teaches social-emotional learning at grade level.\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good teacher to student ratio, social skills groups, alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), use of technology to support different learning styles, teachers have experience with differently wired learners\n\nKinship Academy\n\nSan Jose\n\nWebsite: www.kinshipacademy.org\n\nGrades Served: Elementary, middle school, high school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: ASD, ADHD, learning differences, 2e / twice exceptional, behavioral challenges\n\nCurriculum: Strength-based learning for children who learn differently\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good teacher to student ratio, alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), use of technology to support different learning styles, teachers have experience with differently wired learners\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nMy son is only 3 months in, but it’s clear Kinship is the only school he could be in now after suffering severe trauma from public school and being out of school for several months due to severe anxiety. They are understanding of differently wired kiddos, and the need to take a slow approach to school for him, however long it may need for him to recover from his trauma.\n\nLindamood-Bell Academy\n\nSan Rafael\n\nWebsite: www./lindamoodbell.com/academy\n\nGrades Served: Elementary school, middle school, high school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Inclusion program with extra support for atypical students (“We believe, passionately, that all children and adults can be taught to read, comprehend, and do math to their potential.”)\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted, ADHD, learning differences\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good teacher to student ratio, speech language pathologist or occupational therapist on site, alernative academy expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), use of technology to support different learning styles, teachers have experience with differently wired learners, opportunities for parent education\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nOur son has made amazing progress at Linda Mood Bell Academy. His teacher ratio is 1:1. He is supported in areas that he needs help and is thriving at grade level for normal curriculum.\n\nMid-Peninsula High School\n\nMenlo Park\n\nWebsite: www.mid-pen.org\n\nGrades Served: High school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Inclusion program with extra support for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: ASD, ADHD, learning differences, 2e / twice exceptional\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good teacher to student ratio, teachers have experience with differently wired learners\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nMid-Pen is very small (averaging 30 students per grade level), with class sizes around 15 students. About 60% of students have an IEP. The curriculum is fairly traditional, but they are intentionally light on homework, and their motto is “college prep, less stress.” The school day starts at 9:30 am. It is a small, supportive environment where all students are known. There is a fantastic arts program, including visual arts, drama, and music. Both ASL (American sign language) and Spanish are offered. Many students take Caltrain, and then the city shuttle takes them directly to and from school from the train station.\n\nNew Roads School Spectrum Program\n\nSanta Monica\n\nWebsite:

Our son is in his third year here, and started as a 2nd grader. The founder and lead teacher, Anna Cencioso, has transformed our child and our family. Through her we learned he was 2e, and began to understand him in new ways. He started as an anxious kid who hated books and is now a confident student who is proud of his superpowers.\n\nUrban Montessori Charter School\n\nOakland\n\nWebsite: www.urbanmontessori.org\n\nGrades Served: Elementary school, middle school\n\nType of School: Charter\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Inclusion program with extra support for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Learning differences, behavioral challenges\n\nCurriculum: Montessori\n\nSchool Features: Good teacher to student ratio, Speech language pathologist or occupational therapists on site, social skills group, alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), teachers have experience with differently wired learners\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nMy son has not received an evaluation but struggles with trauma, anxiety and social/ relational issues, as well as negative self-image.

My oldest has Asperger’s and is high function but on the spectrum. He was lost in a big public school atmosphere. His counselor was AMAZING and gave him all sorts of support and encouragement. Ann Cochran, who runs the school, set it up to get kids through the high school curriculum that give heavy emphasis on counseling the kids to advocate for themselves but also help them to pick colleges that are right for each of them. He ended up attending Oregon Tech and is studying engineering. My younger son is “neurotypical” and was a shy kid who would have been invisible at our local high school. He found his place and his people in the speech and debate program at VIP. Led by an amazing “Pied Piper” of debate, the program at VIP has gone from non existent five years ago to top ten in the. country four years ago, top eight three years ago, top six two years ago and top 5 this year! They are building rock stars with so much confidence and team support. If you would have told me that my shy kid would be competing at national competitions at Yale, Stanford, Berkeley, UCLA and at high schools all over the country…all the while keeping up his grades and organizing his own travel and hotels, I would have laughed at you, but his story is not unusual at VIP. He’s turned into a very vocally loquacious and intellectually inspiring young man. College aps and SAT soon to come! If you live in the San Fernando Valley and have a kid who isn’t built for the public machine, give VIP a good look!\n\nVista Verde\n\nIrvine\n\nWebsite: www.vistaverde.iusd.org\n\nGrades Served: Elementary, middle school\n\nType of School: Public\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: General population with no specific support but does well for certain kids\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Learning differences\n\nCurriculum: School-wide Positive Behavior Interventions and Support\n\nSchool Features: Speech language pathologist or occupational therapists on site\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nOur public school has a part time speech therapists, and a full time education specialist, who work with our child’s IEP. We find the speech therapist particularly gifted at her role of observing a student’s behaviors and finding opportunities to practice social techniques in her natural settings. But the school’s principal has disappointed several families by his lack of responsiveness to parent communications on a range of issues. Such as a parent’s email asking to meet on behalf of a school PTA subcommittee on special education; several parents whose kids experienced bullying; lack of visible leadership/school commitment for inclusion and respecting diverse members. The Vice Principal sits in our child’s IEP and has expressed support for Special Education, but the school website doesn’t list our district’s Special Education page on its resources.\n\nWestmark School\n\nEncino\n\nWebsite: www.westmarkschool.org\n\nGrades Served: Elementary, middle school, high school (grades 2-12)\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: ADHD, learning differences\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good teacher to student ratio, teachers have experience with differently wired learners\n\nThe Willow Community School\n\nCulver City\n\nWebsite: www.thewillows.org\n\nGrades Served: Elementary schools, middle school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: General population with no specific support but does well for certain kids\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted, ASD, ADHD, learning differences, 2e / twice exceptional\n\nCurriculum: Progressive curriculum rooted in experiential learning and social values\n\nSchool Features: Good teacher to student ratio, speech language pathologist or occupational therapists on site, alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), use of technology to support different learning styles, opportunities for parent education\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nThe Willows Community School is a wonderful, unique, and supportive environment. We have a 4th grader that has attended the school since kindergarten, and they have always been supportive and open to who our son is and his unique challenges. Our son is gifted and diagnosed in 1st grade with ADHD, Dyslexia, and Dysgraphia. In 3rd grade, a math disability was discovered, and the next year in 4th grade, he was given a diagnosis of HFA. They do not provide services or any neuropsychological testing but do provide the space for OT and learning therapy and will incorporate this into your child’s day at school. They are also very willing to work with the support people we have in place, and teachers are wonderful in seeing the strengths in children and building them up. The school has also incorporated mindfulness and social-emotional learning in their curriculum.\n\nAscend Micro School\n\nColorado Springs\n\nWebsite: www.ascendmicroschool.com\n\nGrades Served: Preschool, elementary school\n\nType of School: Microschool\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted, ADHD, learning differences, 2e / twice exceptional\n\nCurriculum: Learner-centered\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good teacher to student ratio, social skills groups, alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), use of technology to support different learning styles, teachers have experience with differently wired learners, opportunities for parent education\n\nFusion Academy\n\nDenver\n\nWebsite: www.fusionacademy.com\n\nGrades Served: Middle school, high school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted, ASD, ADHD, learning differences, 2e / twice exceptional, behavioral challenges\n\nCurriculum: Love, Motivate, Teach\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good teacher to student ratio, executive function coaching, alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), use of technology to support different learning styles, teachers have experience with differently wired learners, opportunities for parent education\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nMy daughter struggled with anxiety, ADD and executive functioning as soon as she started middle school. The pace was so fast and every day she went to school she was further behind & more confused. So she refused to go. We did a tour/open house at Fusion and she walked out saying, “This where I want to go to school. When can I start?” The down side is that some children are there because of behavioral issues, not because of learning issues. But that’s real-world and the school is very responsive. It’s a very creative atmosphere with young, friendly teachers. Also to note, the teachers need only a BA to work there. Technically not a certified therapy school, so it’s not always easy to get your school district to help with tuition, which is high.\n\nNiwot Elementary School\n\nLongmont\n\nWebsite: www.niwotes.svvsd.org\n\nGrades Served: Elementary school\n\nType of School: Public\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Inclusion program with extra support for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported:Gifted, ASD, ADHD, 2e / twice exceptional\n\nSchool Features: Speech language pathologist or occupational therapists on site, social skills groups, Use of technology to support differently learning styles, teachers have experience with differently wired learners, teachers adapt to each student, very little to no homework.\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nMy daughter had a complex dx of ASD, ADHD, CAPD, and anxiety. She is also highly gifted. She received a lot of benefit from having daily gifted math and language classes, while also getting support in social skills, writing, speech and OT as per her IEP. What I appreciated most is that her mainstream classroom teachers, GT and Special Ed teachers were very calm and patient with my enigmatic child and often were adept at improvising ways of reaching my kid. She also skipped 2nd grade (her choice) via Iowa Scales of Acceleration. Her behavior improved after that, as it was a good decision on her part. She shone most in her GT classes, which included project-led learning and various opportunities to shine such as equations tournaments and student- actors participating in Shakespeare performances in the park.I decided to also send my younger daughter who is more typically developed there just because I appreciated the calmer atmosphere and confidence in the school’s ability to address kids of many stripes.\n\nProspect Academy of Colorado\n\nArvada\n\nWebsite: www.prospectacademyco.org\n\nGrades Served: Middle school\n\nType of School: Charter\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted, ASD, ADHD, 2e / twice exceptional, learning differences\n\nCurriculum: Precision teaching, Orton Gillingham\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, Good teacher to student ratio, Speech language pathologist or occupational therapists on site, Social skills groups, Alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), Use of technology to support differently learning styles, Teachers have experience with differently wired learners, Opportunities for parent education\n\nThe Liberty School\n\nDurango\n\nWebsite: www.thelibertyschool.org\n\nGrades Served: Elementary school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: 2e / twice exceptional\n\nCurriculum: Gifted curriculum with Orton Gillingham support for dyslexia / dysgraphia\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, Good teacher to student ratio, Alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), Use of technology to support differently learning styles, Teachers have experience with differently wired learners, Opportunities for parent education\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nThe Liberty School has changed everything for our 2e daughter. She was in a dyslexia focused school which was helping with her learning disability, but she wasn’t thriving and still felt a bit dead inside about school. We tried looking into other 2e programs but most of them were at schools for gifted students and they didn’t have bespoke support for learning disabilities – instead they wanted us to wait to enroll until she was able to participate at grade level with reading and writing. We needed to find a place where she could benefit from the challenges and engaging content of a gifted curriculum but with specific support for the areas where she needs more. We found that at The Liberty School. The school is intentionally designed to help students go as fast as they can and as slow as they must. After even two months at Liberty, our daughter was a whole different kid – confident, engaged, excited to go to school, and feeling energized about life in general. It felt like she came back to life. The school has made such a huge impact on her, it takes our breath away. We are so grateful to this school, their amazing and highly trained teaching staff, and the incredible community around it.

Angier is top-notch. The inclusion team is excellent, as are services — which, if your child needs it, can include home ABA services, BT support, OT, Extended school year, transportation, etc. The building was built with break-out rooms/sensory rooms. Throughout Newton, kids participate in “Understanding our Differences” curriculum which teaches children about all forms of disabilities, learning differences, and neurodiversity. It is normal to see kids of all abilities at school. Inclusion is a top priority for school leadership.\n\nHowever, some things to note: 1)Real estate is expensive, so you need to consider long-term options, even if you start by renting 2) There is no gifted education in MA, so differentiation for 2E students is missing.\n\nBard Academy at Simon’s Rock\n\nGreat Barrington\n\nWebsite: www.bardacademy.simons-rock.edu\n\nGrades Served:Grades 10 / early college\n\nType of School:Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: General population with no specific support but does well for certain kids\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: 2e / twice exceptional\n\nSchool Features: Small class size\n\nTiLT Parenting / Community Review:\n\nThis is an excellent school for 2e learners.

Kids move up to the next division when they demonstrate mastery of the material, so it is common for some kids to move ahead early, and others to stay in the earlier divisions for longer. There is no stigma attached to “skipping a grade” or “being held back”; in fact, these terms are not used, or even relevant to the school. Kids can also move to the higher division in just one subject if they want to. One of my children was bored in elementary school science and has decided that she wants to “gateway” (move to the next division) early in this subject. She is motivated to pursue this goal for herself. My other child suffers from severe depression and anxiety and needed extra space and time, which she received at Parker. When she was ready to gateway, she did the work and achieved the goal with support from her outstanding teachers, and it is no problem that she did so a year after most of her peers. A lot of the work is project based, with seniors working on a major project as a prerequisite for graduation. Seniors choose their own project based on their interests, naturally pulling our differently wired kid’s special interests into their schooling. Traditional public schools were not a fit for my neurodivergent kids, and we feel very lucky that they are able to attend Parker (a free public school) where their differences are celebrated and supported.\n\nFour Winds School\n\nGill\n\nWebsite: www.fourwindsschool.info\n\nGrades Served: Middle school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: General population with no specific support but does well for certain kids\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted, ASD, ADHD, learning differences, 2e / twice exceptional\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good teacher to student ratio, social skills groups, executive function coaching, alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), use of technology to support different learning styles, teachers have experience with differently wired learners\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nFour Winds has been an amazing middle school for my differently wired (high functioning autism and ADD) son. First of all, it is small (9-13 students, depending on the year). The ratio of teacher to students is high (with 2 full-time teachers and 2 more part-time support staff). Every student learns at their own pace. There is no such thing as “grade level” at Four Winds. There are middle school aged kids doing high school level math. There are also middle school aged kids still working on math basics (i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Kids don’t advance to the next level until they feel comfortable doing so. Academics are organized and rigorous, yet the school is informal and very humane… there are no desks, there is a “quiet room” with couches and bean bag chairs… there are no hall passes… no homework. Almost every other week there is a field trip. There are special “seminars” dealing with middle school aged issues (puberty, relationships, social responsibility, civics, etc.). It’s a wonderful community for the students, where inclusion is taken seriously. I no longer have to worry that my kid is spending recess alone. He has thrived here, and our entire family is better off because of it.\n\nFUSE Preschool and Early Elementary School\n\nLexington\n\nNorwood\n\nWebsite: www.fuseprogram.com\n\nGrades Served: Preschool, elementary\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: ASD, ADHD, 2e / twice exceptional, anxiety\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good teacher to student ratio, speech language pathologist or occupational therapists on site, social skills groups, executive function coaching, alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), use of technology to support different learning styles, teachers have experience with differently wired learners, opportunities for parent education\n\nCurriculum: FUSE School has an innovative curriculum focusing on mindfulness, social collaboration, perspective taking, sensory integration and emotional regulation.\n\nFusion Academy\n\nHingham\n\nNewton\n\nBurlington\n\nAndover\n\nWebsite: www.fusionacademy.com\n\nGrades Served: Middle school, high school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted, ASD, ADHD, learning differences, 2e / twice exceptional, behavioral challenges\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good teacher to student ratio, executive function coaching, alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), use of technology to support different learning styles, teachers have experience with differently wired learners, opportunities for parent education\n\nCurriculum: Love, Motivate, Teach\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nMy daughter struggled with anxiety, ADD and executive functioning as soon as she started middle school.

This school is best for kids who would not fit well in a therapeutic environment but need more support than an IEP in a public school can offer. By focusing on strengths and using those strengths to support weaknesses, Barnstable is giving my 2e learner what he needs to both succeed and feel “normal”!They do not currently offer scholarships but may in the near future. It is a Naples placement. Regardless of what you are told you absolutely can fight your district to obtain placement or reimbursement for tuition. In the tri-state area we are just now starting to see “2e schools” get it right. I have also heard good things about Quad in NYC and FlexSchool has an incredible founder & vision but is still working out big kinks like finding great teachers and the right student population.\n\nCornerstone Day School\n\nCranford\n\nWebsite: www.cornerstonedayschool.com\n\nGrades Served: Middle school, high school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specific support for kids with mental illness\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good student to teach ratio, social skills groups, alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), use of technology to support different learning styles, teachers have experience with differently wired learners, opportunities for parent education, therapeutic and psychiatric support\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nCornerstone is the only school environment in which our son has thrived.

He came from multiple school environments in which the emphasis was on his deficits, and where his gifts were not acknowledged. FlexSchool’s fundamental belief that children should be educated where they are and their use of ability based groupings is incredibly successful. My 10 year old is in a math class with high school students, and at the same time, he is receiving support for his struggles with executive functioning skills. His anxiety is practically gone. He has become more confident in his own abilities and has learned to advocate for himself in an articulate and appropriate way. He looks forward to school and we have animated discussions about the things he is learning. All of the classes are honors level classes with minimal homework and no “busy work”.\n\nFusion Academy\n\nEnglewood\n\nPrinceton\n\nMontclair\n\nCherry Hill\n\nMorristown\n\nWebsite: www.fusionacademy.com\n\nGrades Served: Middle school, high school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted, ASD, ADHD, learning differences, 2e / twice exceptional, behavioral challenges\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good teacher to student ratio, executive function coaching, alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), use of technology to support different learning styles, teachers have experience with differently wired learners, opportunities for parent education\n\nCurriculum: Love, Motivate, Teach\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nMy daughter struggled with anxiety, ADD and executive functioning as soon as she started middle school.

The teachers and administration are amazing and do everything they can to help their students succeed.\n\nMendham Country Day School\n\nBasking Ridge\n\nWebsite: www.mendhamcountrydayschool.com\n\nGrades Served: Preschool, elementary, middle school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Inclusion program with extra support for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, Good teacher to student ratio, Executive function coaching, Alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), Use of technology to support differently learning styles, Teachers have experience with differently wired learners, Opportunities for parent education\n\nPrimoris Academy\n\nWestwood\n\nWebsite: www.primorisacademy.org\n\nGrades Served: Elementary, middle school, high school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good student to teach ratio, teachers have experience with differently wired learners\n\nRaritan High School\n\nHazlet\n\nWebsite: www.hazlet.org\n\nGrades Served: High school\n\nType of School: Public\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Inclusion program with extra support for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Learning differences\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, speech language pathologist or occupational therapists on site, social skills groups\n\nAndrus – The Orchard School\n\nYonkers\n\nWebsite: www.andruscc.org/orchard-school\n\nGrades Served: Preschool, elementary, middle school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: ASD, ADHD, learning differences, 2e / twice exceptional, behavioral challenges\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good teacher to student ratio, social skills groups, teachers have experience with differently wired learners\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nThere is a huge amount of support which I found rewarding. Huge campus with many activities. There is a separate program for children on the spectrum and they are all within a specific iq range. It was important that my son be around children like him. small classrooms and lots of feedback and communication from staff. Lots of children with behavioral issues in this school. There is also a residential program. It can get pretty loud and aggressive at times.\n\nAvenue School\n\nNew York City\n\nWebsite: www.acboe.org/Domain/12\n\nGrades Served: Middle school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Inclusion program with extra support for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted\n\nSchool Features: Good teacher to student ratio, Alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), Use of technology to support differently learning styles, Teachers have experience with differently wired learners\n\nBrooklyn Autism Center\n\nBrooklyn\n\nWebsite: www.brooklynautismcenter.org\n\nGrades Served: Elementary, middle school, high school, up to age 21\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: ASD\n\nCurriculum: Applied Behavioral Analysis\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good teacher to student ratio, alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), use of technology to support differently learning styles, teachers have experience with differently wired learners, 1-to-1 learning\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nBAC has been nothing but supportive. It started the second we signed up my son – they asked a million questions to help guide the individual instruction he would receive. They offered to create a social story to help ease his first day at school, and continue to provide support for activities in our life that go beyond the classroom. The school does group activities such as music, theater, cardio/ gym, dance, and therapeutic horseback riding (seasonally). Once a week, a neurotypical private school comes over to “play” with the kids in this small school, which is so meaningful to the kids there. The big downside is that there are no related services in school, but we are getting around that. My son is thriving in the personalized learning he is receiving, and actually making friends. I was worried that a 1-to-1 ABA program would mean less socialization (because it was that way in another ABA school my son attended), but I am pleasantly surprised that this is not the case!\n\nBrooklyn Free School\n\nBrooklyn\n\nWebsite: www.brooklynfreeschool.org\n\nGrades Served: Preschool, elementary, middle school, high school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: General population with no specific support but does well for certain kids\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted, ASD, ADHD, learning differences, 2e / twice exceptional, behavioral challenges\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, social skills groups, executive function coaching, alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), use of technology to support different learning styles, teachers have experience with differently wired learners\n\nCurriculum: Social justice\n\nEPIC Academy\n\nBrooklyn\n\nWebsite: www.abetterschool.org\n\nGrades Served: Elementary\n\nType of School: Private, micro-school\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted, ASD, ADHD, learning differences, 2e / twice exceptional\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, Good teacher to student ratio, Speech language pathologist or occupational therapists on site, Social skills groups, Executive function coaching, Alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), Use of technology to support differently learning styles, Teachers have experience with differently wired learners, Opportunities for parent education\n\nFlex School\n\nBronxville\n\nWebsite: www.flexschool.net\n\nGrades Served: Middle school, high school, post-graduate\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students, general population with no specific support but does well for certain kids\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted, ASD, ADHD, learning differences, 2e / twice exceptional, behavioral challenges (but no behavioral issues that will not resolve as a result of being in this environment)\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good student to teacher ratio, social skills group, executive functioning coaching, alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), use of technology to support different learning styles, teachers have experience with differently wired learners, minimized homework, discussion-based classes, applied engineering, art therapy, Vermont trip, speaker/field trip most Fridays\n\nCurriculum: Talent and mastery-based program with support for challenges/anxiety as needed.\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nFlex School is the first school where my son is celebrated for who he is. He looks forward to going to school and is challenged for the first time in his academic career. The school supports different learning styles, has flexible seating, no homework and a variety of ways of showing mastery of material other than traditional tests. The kids have a block of time for in-depth study of a topic that interests them on Fridays as well as weekly field trips or guest speakers on Friday afternoons.\n\nFusion Academy\n\nLong Island\n\nPark Avenue\n\nBrooklyn\n\nUpper West Side\n\nWestchester\n\nWebsite: www.fusionacademy.com\n\nGrades Served: Middle school, high school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted, ASD, ADHD, learning differences, 2e / twice exceptional, behavioral challenges\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good teacher to student ratio, executive function coaching, alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), use of technology to support different learning styles, teachers have experience with differently wired learners, opportunities for parent education\n\nCurriculum: Love, Motivate, Teach\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nMy daughter struggled with anxiety, ADD and executive functioning as soon as she started middle school. The pace was so fast and every day she went to school she was further behind & more confused. So she refused to go. We did a tour/open house at Fusion and she walked out saying, “This where I want to go to school. When can I start?” The down side is that some children are there because of behavioral issues, not because of learning issues. But that’s real-world and the school is very responsive. It’s a very creative atmosphere with young, friendly teachers. Also to note, the teachers need only a BA to work there. Technically not a certified therapy school, so it’s not always easy to get your school district to help with tuition, which is high.\n\nThe Gateway School\n\nNew York City\n\nWebsite: www.gatewayschool.org\n\nGrades Served: Elementary, middle school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Learning differences\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, Good teacher to student ratio, Speech language pathologist or occupational therapists on site, Social skills groups, Executive function coaching, Use of technology to support differently learning styles, Teachers have experience with differently wired learners, Opportunities for parent education\n\nCurriculum: Multi-sensory, Orton-Gillingham\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nWe’ve been at Gateway for two years and seen our once closed off dyslexic child bloom academically and socially. I’d encourage anyone interested in the school to watch the exceptional Speaker Series they did in the Spring of 2021. They had the impressive Flom’s (founding family), Harold Koplewicz of Child Mind Institute, two exceptional actresses, both women of color and parents speak to learning differences in children. Most impressive was the alumni panel. That alone will have you sending your child there. We love the teachers and division director. Very grateful parent of a lower school child.\n\nHigh Meadow School\n\nStone Ridge\n\nWebsite: www.highmeadowschool.org\n\nGrades Served: Preschool, elementary, middle school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted, ADHD, 2e / twice exceptional\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good teacher to student ratio, alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), use of technology to support different learning styles, teachers have experience with differently wired learners, opportunities for parent education\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nOur twice-exceptional daughter, whose ADHD, anxiety, and learning disabilities made public school a challenge she could not overcome, has thrived at High Meadow School. Through close relationships with teachers who know her quirks and her learning style, a focus on student agency, plenty of opportunities for outdoor exploration, arts, and play (even at the middle school level) have all contributed to her positive experience. It is a deeply nurturing community that celebrates the differences in all kids, and responds dynamically to the changing needs of different wired students in particular.\n\nThe Lang School\n\nNew York\n\nWebsite: www.thelangschool.org\n\nGrades Served: Elementary, middle school, high school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted, ASD, ADHD, 2e / twice exceptional\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good teacher to student ratio, speech language pathologist or occupational therapists on site, social skills groups, executive function coaching, alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), use of technology to support different learning styles, teachers have experience with differently wired learners\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nJust entered and so far, my daughter thinks “it’s better for her”. Happier child now. When school sees an issue they say it followed by “so, what we’re doing is…”.

They are working with him on academics as well as executive functioning, emotional self-regulation and bolstering his self-esteem.

It’s an incredible model which was first piloted at this school. They are looking for a specific profile who they serve well. The school specifically has seen it all. They tend to work with parents, taking a restorative justice approach, and don’t pathologize behavior. It is a public school, so budget is tight and fundraising help is always needed. Check your implicit bias before considering this school. It’s a place where families from many different backgrounds learn to get along with each other.\n\nSpark Elementary\n\nLindenhurst\n\nWebsite: www.sparkelementary.com\n\nGrades Served: Preschool, elementary school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students, inclusion program with extra support for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: All differently learning children\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good teacher to student ratio, speech language pathologist or occupational therapists on site, social skills groups, executive function coaching, alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), use of technology to support differently learning styles, teachers have experience with differently wired learners, opportunities for parent education\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nMy son is 2e with a high IQ, anxiety, and possibly ADHD or sensory processing disorder.

One thing is particular that I love is the fact that everyone is trained in Michelle Garcia Winner’s Social Thinking curriculum, so the staff members all speak the same language when it comes to social support. We see so clearly the lessons coming through when she engages with friends and family – she’s a different kid – still her beautiful amazing self, but happier and more easily able to navigate the wider world. The school’s administration is not always the best at communicating important information or changes – but they’re growing a lot. Hopefully that will improve as things even out.\n\nThe Co-Op School\n\nBrooklyn\n\nWebsite: www.thecoopschool.org\n\nGrades Served: Preschool, elementary school, middle school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: General population with no specific support but does well for certain kids\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: ADHD, 2e / twice exceptional, learning differences\n\nCurriculum: Progressive, constructionist approach with Reggio-Emilia foundations\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good teacher to student ratio, speech language pathologist or occupational therapists on site, social skills groups, executive function coaching, teachers have experience with differently wired learners\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nThe school has been a wonderful environment for my 2e son with ADHD. He has blossomed here with a small class size and all the support we could ask for (OT, SETTS, and a social skills groups in particular). The school is not specifically marketing itself as supporting neurodivergent learners but they welcome all children and do their very best to support them and meet with where they are.\n\nCharlotte Lab\n\nCharlotte\n\nWebsite: www.charlottelabschool.org\n\nGrades Served: Elementary school, middle school, high school\n\nType of School: Charter\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Inclusion program with extra support for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted ASD, ADHD, learning differences, 2e / twice exceptional\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good student to teach ratio, speech language pathologist on site, use of technology to support differently learning styles, teachers have experience with differently wired learners\n\nFlaming Sword Christian Academy\n\nHope Mills\n\nWebsite: www.flamingswordcampus.org\n\nGrades Served: Preschool, elementary school, middle school, high school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Inclusion program with extra support for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted ASD, ADHD, learning differences, 2e / twice exceptional\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good student to teach ratio, speech language pathologist or occupational therapists on site, use of technology to support differently learning styles, teachers have experience with differently wired learners\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nMy son is 2e – gifted with autism and adhd. Public school did not work for him and his behaviors were out of control. Flaming Sword was an answer to our prayers! He is challenged academically while receiving the support he needs for behaviors and social/emotional difficulties. One of the things that makes me happiest is that he has FRIENDS! He is happy and successful and isn’t made to feel weird or different. My son is making progress academically, behaviorally, socially and emotionally. I truly could not ask for more.I am a seasoned special education teacher for our public school system. There are kids who just don’t fit into our programs.

Conflict is handled by looking for a lack of skill and teaching that skill rather than a behavioral choice.\n\nWestlawn School\n\nWinston-Salem\n\nWebsite: www.westlawnschool.org\n\nGrades Served: Grades 3 – 7\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted, 2e / twice-exceptional\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, Good teacher to student ratio, Social skills groups, Alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), Use of technology to support differently learning styles, Teachers have experience with differently wired learners, Opportunities for parent education\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nOur child started at Westlawn a month ago and it has already been life-changing for him. The staff work closely with each student to provide a tailored approach to their learning needs. The program includes a good balance of behavioral and academic focus, emphasizing accomplishments and use of a growth mindset to set and achieve goals. Our son’s entire outlook on life and his potential for success in school and in the future has completely changed for the better. He loves going to school every day and his passion for learning has returned. He is thinking about his future and communicating his life goals again, goals he knows he can achieve if he works hard. The Westlawn team communicates with us frequently, sharing pictures of our son working and providing updates on his work each week. They also provide good feedback on at-home efforts we can implement to support our young learner and help reinforce school teachings and behavioral tools. We are so grateful to be part of this community and cannot speak highly enough about this school!\n\nChagrin Valley School\n\nChagrin Falls\n\nWebsite: www.chagrinvalleyschool.org\n\nGrades Served: Preschool, elementary school, middle school, high school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: General population with no specific support but does well for certain kids\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted, ADHD\n\nSchool Features: Alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.)\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nMy son attended public School through second grade. He started telling me he didn’t like school when he was in kindergarten. I didn’t know about alternative schools, so we stuck it out through 2nd grade. He does well academically, but there was a lot he wasn’t interested in, and he struggled socially, due to ASD. Finally, I came across this school using the Democratic method, which I had never heard of before. He’s allowed freedom to do as he pleases at the school. He can pursue what he wants to learn, games he wants to play, whether he wants to be indoor or outdoor, etc. The kids are not forced to do any specific subject, and there is no homework and no testing. The school deals with behavioral issues through a judiciary process, where a child can write up another child if there was an issue. It is then worked out through a meeting.\n\nThe school is actually set on a farm, so there are animals around as well. If you attend the school, you will have to register as a homeschooler, as the school is not an official ‘school’. You can go full-time, or part-time, and it’s great social interaction for kids who may not fit into a typical School. my son just finished his first year there, technically third grade, and he loved it. He didn’t want school to end!\n\nCinDay Academy\n\nSpringboro\n\nWebsite: www.cindayacademy.com\n\nGrades Served: Preschool, elementary school, middle school, high school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Inclusion program with extra support for atypical students, general population with no specific support but does well for certain kids\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: ADHD\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good teacher to student ratio, alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), teachers have experience with differently wired learners\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nMy son has ADHD inattentive, and may be gifted. Public school would not work with him on anything, therefore holding him back. He’s been at Cinday Academy for 3 weeks now, and has grown leaps & bounds due to the environment. The philosophy fits him including the ability for him to be in the high school environment when he is technically in 8th grade. He’s now challenged & wants to try hard. This is still a new experience for him, but I would definitely recommend this school!\n\nLawrence School\n\nBroadview Heights (grades K-6)\n\nSagamore (grades 7-12)\n\nCleveland\n\nWebsite: www.lawrenceschool.org\n\nGrades Served: Elementary school, middle school, high school\n\nType of School: Private\n\nApproach to Neurodivergence: Specifically for atypical students\n\nNeurodifferences Supported: Gifted, ADHD, learning differences, 2e / twice exceptional\n\nSchool Features: Small class size, good student to teach ratio, executive function coaching, alternative academic expectations (such as no homework, no testing, no grades, etc.), teachers have experience with differently wired learners, use of technology to support different learning styles, opportunities for parent education\n\nCurriculum: Orton-Gillingham\n\nTiLT Parent / Community Review:\n\nLawrence School will change the life of every person in your family.

He made so much progress on his reading skills he doesn’t even have an IEP goal for reading anymore. All of the teachers at Marburn are trained in OG and meet each child where he/she is academically. Each child receives 50 minutes of small group intervention DAILY specifically designed to meet his/her needs. My son has had the opportunity to join a competitive robotics team, be part of 2 school musicals, learn rock climbing, and join a running club which culminated in running in a community 5K race. I don’t think he would have had nearly the same types of opportunities at our public middle school. Marburn saved our son. If you are an Ohio resident and your child has an IEP, you can take advantage of a state scholarship to help with tuition but it is still very expensive."
