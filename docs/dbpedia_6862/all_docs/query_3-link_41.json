        "text": "This school used to be a fantastic place where everyone felt like family. In recent years, it has gone incredibly downhill. While most of the teachers are compassionate, talented, caring individuals, the administration is lacking those qualities. Bullying is prevalent but swept under the rug; no official investigations are conducted. Title IX funds are being used but the laws regulating them are not being followed. Test scores are embarrassingly low. Several teachers either don't have a teaching license or are licensed inappropriately for the content in which they are teaching. The older students know how to (and frequently do) manipulate administrators into giving them privileges that other students do not have -- favoritism is rampant, especially among the young men. The church is running the show here, the school is definitely NOT a top priority. The school seems to be more of a money-making project for the church, rather than a mission to serve families. This is especially evident when you walk through the halls and see no evidence of learning (no student work, no banners, etc.). The \"Head of School\" is concerned more with the bottom line and how things appear than the emotional and educational well-being of his students. Not a single person on the administration team, nor the school board, has an administrator license. Most have never taught full-time (or even have a teaching license/been through a teaching program), yet they feel comfortable making decisions that impact classroom learning.My children wanted to be at this school more than anything. Then they couldn't wait to get out. Until there are major changes, I would HIGHLY encourage you to avoid this school.\n\nPosted by a parent on 7/28/2022\n\nI was a student at this school for a while. I could see the way it changed from a kind, loving, and community-like school into a place where bullying, favoritism, and sexism thrive. Administration should be cracking down on this, since it is such a huge issue, but instead they do nothing. In fact, the administration are the ones doing the favoritism and the sexism. The teachers would be the only reason I would even think about entering that building again. Though, while most of them are great people, they aren't exactly the best teachers. A lot of times, it seems like they don't exactly know what they are doing and seem under-qualified for the class that they are teaching. It seems to me like the administration doesn't get the people they need, so they throw in people who may or may not understand the topics at hand. Oh, you liked math in high school? You're hired. Oh, you went to Spain on a mission's trip and picked up some things? New Spanish teacher. This school started out with such a heart for families and the students' educations, but it went bad quick. I know most of the people I went to school with will never set foot in that building again, and I don't blame them. If you ask any of the older students that have been there a while what they think about this school, they will give about the same review that I did. The administration has no clue what they are doing, and half of the time, neither do the teachers. I highly encourage you not to go to this school.\n\nPosted by a community member on 7/28/2022"
