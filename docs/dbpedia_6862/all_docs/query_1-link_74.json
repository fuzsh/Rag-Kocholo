        "text": "Where else but in Hollywood would elementary school fundraisers feature Beyonce and Chris Martin as performers or Tom Hanks as a live auctioneer? These days, industry moms and dads are just as likely to obsess over which institutions are right for their kids (and how to get them in) as they are over the weekend box office or Nielsen live-plus-3s — if not more. According to Private School Review, which analyzes private-school data from all U.S. markets, there are more than 1,000 private schools in Los Angeles County serving more than 200,000 students, with high school tuitions in the city running 56 percent higher than the national average. \"Getting into private school is no walk in the park — the application process can be draining,\" says top school consultant Betsy Brown Braun. \"The uneven nature of public schools, the size of their classrooms and our growing school-age population has put private schools in great demand.\" As many kids head back to school in late August (and with parent tours beginning for the 2018-19 school year), THR offers its first insider's guide to the best private institutions in L.A. (as well as schools both public and religious) that the entertainment industry clamors to get their kids into. Just don't send the nanny to any pre-admissions events or think making a fat donation will help your chances. Says education consultant Harriett Bay: \"When I hear, 'Tell them I can buy a library,' I say, 'There are so many people that could do that, stand in line.' \"\n\nWritten by Scott Johnson, Amanda Eberstein and Degen Pener"
