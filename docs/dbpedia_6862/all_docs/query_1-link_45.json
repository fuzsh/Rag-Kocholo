        "text": "Athlete? Thespian? Or Engineer?\n\nAt Maret, you don’t have to know what direction you’ll take in life or fit into someone else’s expectation of who you should be. You’ll have so many opportunities to try new things, make discoveries about who you are, and be part of something bigger than yourself—whether that’s a sports team, a social action initiative, or Cheese and Tea Club. The best learning experiences are never in a straight line. Whether you come to Maret in kindergarten, Middle School, or ninth grade, our wide array of co- and extracurriculars mean that you’ll never run out of things to explore and ways to stretch and grow.\n\nGoing Far, Going Together\n\nFor more than 100 years, students of all grades have learned together on Maret’s campus. We foster meaningful interactions between older and younger students that strengthen our close-knit community. It's a hallmark of Maret’s K–12 experience. Highlights of the year include the day that Upper School biology students and first graders release shad fry into the Anacostia River as part of a restoration project with the Anacostia Watershed Society; the carnival organized by eighth graders for Lower School students; programs like Reading Buddies and Math Buddies; the Middle School House system; and the all-school sing in December. These are just a few of the many intentional ways that Maret students connect with one another throughout the school year!\n\nConnecting with Students Across the Country\n\nMaret is one of 28 schools in the country, and the only school in Washington, DC, to be a member of the Malone Schools Online Network (MSON), which offers a variety of online courses taught by experts to highly motivated high school students. These courses span the humanities, social sciences, STEM, and world languages and augment Maret’s own innovative upper school curriculum. The program’s commitment to excellence, college-level classes, and small class sizes are among the benefits of MSON, but Maret students say that one of the biggest highlights is building relationships and learning from students across the country."
