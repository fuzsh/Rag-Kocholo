        "text": "\"AHG means so much to our family! My girls get to spend time with a wonderful group of girls, young women, and leaders who invest their time in these growing women. I love that the Mission Statement is: Building women of integrity through service to God, family, community, and country. This is a program that truly follows their Mission Statement and I am so proud that we are American Heritage Girls.\"\n\n- Samantha B., AHG Mom -\n\n\"I don’t have the words to express how important AHG is to me. Because of this incredible organization, I have learned survival skills, and I adore camping and hiking. I have begun to understand what it means to be a godly leader… I have developed relationships with adults, girls and Jesus that I wouldn’t trade for the world. This program has helped me understand who I am both as a person and in Christ.\"\n\n- Kylee M., AHG Girl Member -\n\n\"In my first year of high school, I desired the close-knit community (AHG) offered and the exciting adventures that occurred. Throughout my time in the program, I learned what it meant to be a Godly woman through the (example of) my leaders… I learned how to repair and upkeep an automobile, how to identify poisonous plants, first aid, electrical repairs within a home, etc. In adulthood, all of (these) have been tremendously helpful.\"\n\n- Hannah B., AHG Alumna -\n\n\"I love that all four of my daughters, different ages, are all in the same Troop—so family friendly. We have high adventure activities, service, badges, friendship, and fun, all while building women of integrity—what we want our leaders to be! The best part is that it is completely Christ-centered and SO respectful of our Catholic faith.\"\n\n- Johanne N., AHG Mom -"
