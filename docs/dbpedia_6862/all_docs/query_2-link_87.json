The program, titled Hawk EYES, is modeled after the\n\n. The national program is an initiative of the National Center for Fathering that encourages fathers to help step up security in schools.\n\nHorizon's localized version is similar but with a tweaked name to reflect the school's mascot, said Principal Judi Smith.\n\nSmith said the faculty took a look at the program after\n\n, in which 26 people, mostly children, were killed. She said it's an added bonus to have dads help the one Tualatin Police officer who patrols the area.\n\nShe proposed the program to parents during a school security meeting in early January.\n\n\"Everyone was nodding their heads,\" she said. \"I just knew this would be great because it can be hard to get dads involved in schools.\"\n\nThe dads who volunteer go through a background check and an orientation, in which they receive schedules, walkie-talkies, keys to every campus door and a map of the school. Smith and other staff walk them through the rounds, and the police officer teaches self-defense.\n\nDepending on their schedules, some dads work in the mornings from around 8 a.m. to noon, and others work from noon to 3 p.m. During the shifts, the dads patrol the 6-acre campus, monitor recess, open car doors in the carpool line, direct visitors to the front desk, check locked doors and spend half an hour in a class, usually with their child.\n\n\"These dads are not looking for recognition,\" Smith said. \"It's out of the goodness of their hearts.\"\n\nDwayne Scales, a dad of two, volunteers on Fridays during the 8 a.m. shift. He makes sure to pop into both his kids' classes.\n\n\"When you look at what's going on in the world today, whatever we can do to deflect those problems while we still can is important,\" he said.\n\nEven 3,000 miles away from Newtown, schools felt the pressure to beef up security and address parental worries after the shooting.\n\ncreated a committee of school employees to make safety recommendations for the school board's consideration in April.\n\nBut Smith said Horizon is the only school in the Portland metro area to use the Watch D.O.G.S program to address those same concerns.\n\nSmith said she will continue the program into the foreseeable future.\n\n\"The dads want it, the students want it,\" she said. \"The appreciation is deep and wide.\"\n\n--"
