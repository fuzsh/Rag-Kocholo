        "text": "My grandchildren go to HCS. They transferred from Beaverton public schools. The best decision their parents made! They are now learning at school! Learning spelling, math, geography, science, actual school subjects! They offer extra curricular activities and sports for the children to participate, if they choose to. The teachers are fabulous and the children love them! They have holiday parties in class that were not allowed in the public schools ! And parents are encouraged to help out and volunteer in class and for other activities. Unlike public school where the parents are not allowed in the classrooms. Highly recommend Horizon Christian School !\n\nPosted by a community member on 2/23/2024\n\nBesides the fact that this school has poor academics, the leadership at this school does a very poor job integrating the Bible into how they deal with discipline and their employees. We know of a parent whose child was kicked out of the school and the school contacted DHS on them. The parent was blindsided by this and had no idea the child was even having problems. I taught at the school for 1.75 years and resigned based on the fact that the leadership had betrayed my families trust for reasons I can not get into right now. Avoid this school at all cost.\n\nPosted by a teacher on 4/30/2023\n\nHorizon is full of truly incredible, dedicated and loving teachers but the integrity of the administrators is questionable. My son made such incredible academic, social and personal growth during his time at Horizon. Unfortunately I was forced to remove my first grader due to outrageous mid year changes to their approach to behavioral expectations. Had I left him enrolled it would have resulted in him essentially being sent home daily if he had to be reminded more than three times to cease an unfavorable behavior- like blurting or being off task in the classroom. Completely unreasonable for a first grader. It’s truly heartbreaking, my son loved this school and his teacher, who was truly the most selfless and passionate teacher I have ever met. She deserves nothing but praise and we will miss her terribly.The administration is intentionally creating an environment inhospitable to divergent or atypical learning styles. It feels like nothing short of thinning the herd of undesirables by using a system that was anecdotally successful in a public school environment. I was also encouraged by the principal to medicate my son to make him more compliant and successful with the new behavioral expectations. TL;DR- don’t send your child here if they have even a hint of emotional, social, or focus difficulties- certainly not a child with adhd or anxiety issues. They will not be welcomed if they don’t conform quickly under their new behavioral expectations.\n\nPosted by a parent on 12/21/2018\n\nWe have enrolled all three of our kids at Horizon Christian School. We could not be more thrilled with the experience they have had thus far. Our kids have come out of a great public school environment that was rich with opportunity. While our kids did well in that environment, the piece that was missing for us was a Christ-centered foundation and class sizes that enabled our kids to be supported. Our kids are thriving in their new environment academically, socially, athletically, and most importantly, spiritually. I can certainly understand where some of the negative feedback may come from, however, I have yet to find a perfect school that meets every need perfectly. We are grateful for the experience our kids are having and will continue to work to do our part as supportive parents.\n\nPosted by a parent on 12/12/2016"
