        "text": "A federal judge denied an emergency motion sought by three Christian schools in Oregon that want to reopen this fall, finding Gov. Kate Brown’s executive order for K-12 schools during the coronavirus holds up constitutionally.\n\n“In my view the religious institutions here in K-through-12 aren’t being treated in any way differently than public K-through-12 institutions,” U.S. District Judge Michael W. Mosman ruled Thursday after hearing nearly two hours of testimony.\n\nAttorney John Kaempf, representing Horizon Christian School, McMinnville Christian Academy and Life Christian School, had urged the judge to grant a temporary restraining order that would have halted the governor’s order and allowed the three schools to reopen with in-person classes this fall.\n\n“We want to be treated the same as universities and daycare centers,” Kaempf said.\n\n“Zoom learning is not what Christian learning is about,” he said. “My clients are called to communal in person faith-based learning.”\n\nAttorney Marc Abrams, for the governor, argued that health concerns are paramount and the temporary limitations on in-school learning are necessary to avoid the potential loss of life and a “potential super spreader site.”\n\nThe judge found the Christian schools made it clear that they have been and will be “irreparably harmed,” adding there’s “near certainty” that one or more of the schools might fold.\n\nYet Mosman said he needs to examine the law in place and finds the state’s public health concerns due to the pandemic outweigh the schools’ interests.\n\n“The harm the state is trying to prevent is death and not just death as in a few, but the possibility of a widespread pandemic killing our most vulnerable citizens,” Mosman said.\n\nAccording to the state, the governor on June 24 issued Executive Order 20-29, which provided that on-site instruction may take place in public and private K-12 schools only if it meets guidance issued by the Oregon Health Authority and Oregon Department of Education.\n\nThat order was extended by a subsequent one called Executive Order 20-30. Public and private schools may reopen for on-site instruction after 5% or less of COVID-19 tests are positive statewide for three consecutive weeks; 5% or less of COVID-19 tests are positive in the school’s county for three consecutive weeks; and there are 10 or fewer new cases per 100,000 population, according to the Oregon Health Authority and Education Department.\n\nFor K-3 on-site instruction to resume, the school’s county must have positive COVID-19 tests of 5% or less and fewer than 30 new cases per 100,000 population for three consecutive weeks and no confirmed cases of COVID-19 among school staff or students in the prior 14 days.\n\nMosman said he recognized the positive role of religious education in public life.\n\n“It’s an understandable position and surely frustrating to see marijuana dispensaries and taverns granted the right to open and church schools told there’s serious limitations before opening,” the judge said.\n\nBut he said he couldn’t compare the Christian K-8 schools to the governor’s orders that affect other facilities, such as laundromats, bars or universities.\n\n“Universities and day cares are qualitatively different and aren’t covered by this general rule of neutral terms and general applicability to the group it attempts to govern,” Mosman said.\n\nKaempf had submitted a sworn statement to the court from Yamhill County Commissioner Mary Starrett, who shared that during a July 29 weekly call with two of the governor’s representatives, one answered her question when she asked why private and parochial schools weren’t allowed to reopen.\n\nAccording to Starrett, Leah Horner, the governor’s jobs and economic policy adviser, told her there was a concern about a “mass exodus from public schools” if private schools were permitted to reopen and public schools weren’t.\n\nLawyers for the governor responded that Horner’s statement was taken out of context.\n\n“I did not mean to imply that there would be an exodus from public schools if private schools reopened and public schools did not,” Horner wrote in her own response to the court. “I was merely mentioning the possibility that if, for whatever reason, students disenrolled from a public school, that school would lose some of its state school funds. I was just trying to educate the officials on the conference call as to what these decisions look like on broader scale.”\n\nThe judge found the back-and-forth irrelevant to his decision. He called the remarks “double hearsay’' and insufficient to show a motivating factor for the governor’s order.\n\nThe three churches named as plaintiffs in the federal suit are McMinnville Christian Academy, which offers K-8 classes; Horizon Christian School, a pre-K-12 private school within 30 miles of Hood River, and Life Christian School in Aloha, which offers K-12 classes.\n\n-- Maxine Bernstein\n\nEmail at mbernstein@oregonian.com; 503-221-8212\n\nFollow on Twitter @maxoregonian\n\nSubscribe to Facebook page"
