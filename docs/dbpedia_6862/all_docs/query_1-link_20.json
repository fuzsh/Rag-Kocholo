No matter where you are on your educational journey, whether strapping on boots or sprinting to the finish line, MPCS guides your child with high expectations and generous support — in an environment where each child is truly known and loved.\n\n“At Mount Paran, I’m not only gaining a great education, but am also being poured into spiritually.”\n\nThough the path is sometimes rocky, MPCS is here so that your child can reach new heights, and develop a faith that can move mountains. (Matthew 17:20)"
