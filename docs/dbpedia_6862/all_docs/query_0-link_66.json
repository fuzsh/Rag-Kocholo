Now every game for every other team is going to seem like homecoming for them. We just have to be prepared, and it’s a mental thing too, so I’m trying to get them prepared for that as well.”\n\nA few of the players who helped Horizon make history last year graduated, including Malachi Mathis, who stepped in at quarterback during the Warriors playoff run.\n\nHowever, Horizon’s roster features 19 players who have their sights set on defending their title.\n\n“This year’s team looks really good, to say the least,” Taylor said. “We lost a big part of our offense in Malachi Mathis and Camden Moore, and also Isaac Bond. We lost Luke Sell early in the year – I think in the Pinecrest game – but Malachi Mathis and Camden Moore were huge parts of both sides of the ball. These guys have stepped up. We’ve got some new kids coming in that are also stepping up, so I’m looking forward to those guys stepping up to help fill that gap.”\n\nZane Lamonde returns after tearing his labrum last season and will play quarterback and linebacker.\n\nLamonde totaled 787 yards and 15 touchdown through the air last season, adding 294 yards and a pair of scores on the ground.\n\n“I had to get full shoulder reconstruction,” Lamonde said. “I tore my labrum, so I ended up moving from quarterback to running back for the playoffs. I’m still kind of rehabbing through it, but I’m pretty much 100 percent now. It’s been about a six- to seven-month process, just starting with light movement and working up to throwing. I feel really good – actually, I feel better now than I probably did halfway through last year.\n\nSee HORIZON | 28\n\n*GAPPS Region 1-1A game\n\n2020 results\n\n5-4 Overall, 0-2 GAPPS Division I\n\n*GAPPS Region 1-1A game **Playoff game\n\nthe coach Damon Taylor"
