BCS has been like a second family to us and we love that Christian values are infused in every aspect of the academic training. We know that the curriculum is the best around and our children are being well equipped for whatever their future may hold. We are thankful for the faculty and staff that love our children everyday, and help us to raise our children to know Jesus and make Him known.\n\nJason and Tannis Knighton\n\nThe Magallanes Family\n\nParent\n\nAs a product of a private high school education myself, it has always been a dream to provide a similar experience for my own children. This is our second year at BCS and my (3) children are thriving! I couldn’t be happier with the educational content they teach and how they tie everything together with a biblical worldview. The small classes allow the kids to be more than just a number, and they get to know their classmates more intimately. It truly feels like an extension of family here on campus.\n\nAnna Magallanes\n\nThe Rhone Family\n\nParent\n\nOur son has been attending BCS for over 4 years now. It has been amazing to see the growth at BCS. We are very thankful for the BCS teachers and staff working with our son and taking time to help him when asked or needed. BCS provides a quality education along with the spiritual guidance needed in today’s world. The students at the school seem to be very respectful and accepting of each other which creates a positive atmosphere for learning and growing. We look forward to the next two years and praise God for bringing our family to BCS.\n\nDenise Rhone\n\nThe Rhyne Family\n\nParent\n\nBrazosport Christian School has been a wonderful option for my daughters. Not only is it a school, but it is a family. What I love about BCS is that the administration and staff hold the students to a high level of academic rigor while not losing focus of the most important component of their life, their spiritual walk. The students are encouraged to serve, lead, and instilled with character traits that will help them be successful for years to come. The small class sizes allow your child to receive one on one instruction. The staff is dedicated to teaching, coaching, mentoring, loving, and supporting your child and family.\n\nTessa Rhyne\n\nTake the Next Step!"
