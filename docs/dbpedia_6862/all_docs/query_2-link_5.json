        "text": "Horizon Christian High School is a little oasis in a huge desert. It is refreshing to know my kids are very safe, learning college-prep subjects, getting close attention and help from their teachers, making close friends in a connected community-feeling Christian environment. The school really does live out its motto of “Everybody Is Somebody and Jesus Is All”. Staff and teachers go out of their way to make each kid feel special, loved, and understood. There is a healthy balance of fun and engaging school activities mixed with rigorous studying and learning mixed with appropriate rules and discipline. The students themselves also work to make newcomers and international students feel welcome and seen. One reason why I think the school is so successful is that there is a high level of parent involvement. Parents not only volunteer to help their students, but they volunteer to show appreciation for the teachers and staff as well. This school truly is amazing!\n\nHorizon Christian High School is an amazing school. The Thing that stands out the most by far is the Staff. They are always willing to put in extra time to ensure the success of their students. They go out of their way to create a positive relationship with each of the students. Personally, accepting the offer to work outside of class with a teacher has always proved to be beneficial. They contain a plethora of knowledge, and are always willing to share with their students. Horizon has been a wonderful place to spend my high school career and i could not be more grateful for them. That being said, I do think that Horizon could improve their math department. There has been a change in math teachers for most of the years I have been there. Some stability and consistently would benefit that program and its students."
