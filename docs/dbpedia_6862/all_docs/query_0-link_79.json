        "text": "Our Mission\n\nHorizon University enables students seeking Christ-centered instruction to develop critical thinking skills, a broad knowledge base, and a biblically integrated understanding of their vocation, so that they will successfully inspire servant leadership as they excel in their profession and as they win, disciple, and send others for Jesus Christ.\n\nOur History\n\nIn November of 1993, classes were officially offered under the name Horizon Bible Institute (HBI). The State of California Bureau for Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education awarded HBI a religious exemption to operate as a non-accredited school. Since 1993, many students have graduated and gone on to fruitful ministries as well as further schooling.\n\nIn April of 2000, HBI began a relationship with Azusa Pacific University’s Haggard Graduate School of Theology, wherein our graduates would be accepted into their accredited graduate program. Several students have since taken advantage of this relationship and have obtained their graduate degrees. In 2005 HCSD began the same relationship with Bethel Seminary in San Diego, and in 2007 with Southern California Bible College and Seminary.\n\nAt the beginning of 2004, the name of Horizon Bible Institute was officially changed to Horizon College San Diego to better reflect the comprehensive nature of our degree programs and our future plans for growth.\n\nIn August 2004, HCSD added a traditional full-time college program, with classes meeting during the day Monday through Thursday. In January 2005, HCSD began offering classes online as well.\n\nIn August 2006, HCSD moved to a facility in the Scripps Ranch area of San Diego. This facility incorporated all of our class rooms, library, administration offices, and student lounge in one location.\n\nIn August 2010, Horizon College San Diego experienced the Lord preparing a new set of wine skins to carry on the faithful work of the original founding team.\n\nIn 2013, accreditation was granted by the Association of Biblical Higher Education (ABHE) and the school name re-established as Horizon University.\n\nIn 2017, ABHE and the Indiana Commission for Higher Education approved relocation of the University’s main campus to Indianapolis, IN.\n\nIn 2019, the ABHE Commission on Accreditation reaffirmed accreditation for Horizon University until 2028.\n\nIn 2020, Horizon University was approved to offer accredited graduate programs, initially a Master of Arts in Biblical Studies, and additionally a Master of Arts in Leadership & Ministry as well as a Master of Divinity with emphases in Biblical Studies or Leadership & Ministry."
