        "text": "OUR BEGINNINGS - Changing Lives to Change the World\n\nHorizon Christian Schools is a ministry of Horizon Community Church. We began in 1981 with a few preschool classes held in a renovated barn. Since our school's humble inception, our student body has grown to over 500 students serving children from grades preschool through 12th grade on two school campuses: Horizon Christian Elementary and Middle School and Horizon Christian High School. We serve the suburban Portland, Oregon market by offering a well-rounded, rigorous education delivered within a Christian-centered worldview. We provide a Christian teaching environment without denominational restrictions and believe that \"whoever will, may come.\" We only ask that students and families have both the heart and the desire to learn and the willingness to explore a Christian worldview.\n\nThe Horizon Christian High School was founded in October 2006, as a ministry of Grace (now Horizon) Community Church. It began with a vision: in 1994, Pastor Stan Russell felt called by God to create a Christ-centered community in Tualatin. In 1999, the vision expanded to include a high school to further glorify God's name. By 2000, the church had obtained community support in the form of both faith and gifts, and the dream began to be a reality. In June 2001, 38 acres of land were acquired; construction began a few years later. In October 2006, Horizon Christian High School opened its doors to the first students.\n\nFACULTY AND STAFF\n\nOur faculty is chosen based on the quality and breadth of their training and their commitment to Christ-centered principles. Many feel they have been called to serve at Horizon Christian Schools, and all of them are committed to identifying and nurturing each student's God-given gifts and unique talents. Most teachers are accredited through the Teachers Standards and Practices Commission or the Association of Christian Schools International.\n\nCAMPUS LIFE\n\nThe Horizon Christian Elementary and Middle School campuses are located on Sagert Street in Tualatin, Oregon, near Legacy Meridian Park Hospital. With easy I-5 access, the campus safely back up to a green way providing for a beautiful academic setting. K-6 classes meet from 8:30AM to 3:00PM and our middle grade meet from 8:15AM to 3:15PM. A carefully executed car line provides for safe and easy access to the school. In addition to regular classes, Horizon students enjoy a number of specialist classes to round out their educational experience, including Foreign Language, Computer Lab, Fine Arts, Choral Music Performance, Theater Arts, and PE. Weekly participation at every grade level is integral to fulfilling our educating the whole child philosophy in the Christ Centered education received at Horizon Christian Schools.\n\nAt Horizon Christian, we believe that every student is talented and gifted, and therefore provide opportunities for all upper grade students to develop and expand their area of '\"Smart\" while exploring all 8 Kinds of Smart. We call our unique program, iSmart. Beginning with introduction, exploration and assessment in 4th grade, Horizon students participate in special programs focused in their top 2 areas of \"Smart\". As students advance to 5th and 6th Grade they are grouped together with each other according to their strongest areas of \"Smart\" and participate in 2 different 4 week long modules facilitated by a staff member especially gifted in that area of \"Smart\".\n\nEach iSmart module guides students in exploring, enhancing and celebrating their kind of Smart through special guest speakers, demonstrations, off campus experiences and community service projects.\n\nHorizon's iSmart program allows students to grow in confidence knowing that they are deliberately and beautifully made by our Creator and can look brightly toward the future knowing that because of their God designed strengths they will not only succeed but excel in academics and in life.\n\nThe Horizon Christian High School campus is located on 38 acres of property at the intersection of Boones Ferry and Norwood Roads in Tualatin, Oregon. We offer a wide range of specialty classes including foreign language, computer labs, fine arts, choral music performance, theatre arts, and physical education. 3A Championship athletics include football, basketball, baseball, soccer, volleyball, softball, cross country, and track, and our athletic training facilities and coaches are state of the art. Over time and as part of our ongoing Hawk Heritage Giving Society and Horizon Campus Campaign, we intend to expand campus to include up to 60 classrooms, a chapel, art studios, computer and science labs, an athletic training facility, a variety of sports fields, and a 5,000 seat football and track and field stadium.\n\nATHLETICS\n\nHorizon Christian Middle School Athletic program includes: Fall - Football, Volleyball, Cross Country; Winter â€“ Basketball; Spring; Track and Field.\n\nHorizon Christian High School is registered with the Oregon State Activities Association (OSAA) to compete as a 3A school in District 2. Our athletic program includes: Fall - Football, Soccer (girls), Cross Country, and Volleyball; Winter - Basketball (boys and girls); Spring - Baseball, and Track and Field."
