        "text": "I had nine years at this school. The kids are perfectly fine and overall, they aren't nearly as bad as in a public school. The dress code isn't the greatest, but it's not the worst possible situation. What gave it a 2/5 is the administration and the head of school. A lot happened, and I do not agree at all with the way they handled it. My mother was also a teacher here and they fired her for not being a good enough christian, though they said she was an amazing teacher. They also backed up a coach who wasn't going to let me be involved in senior night for volleyball, even though I was a senior. Now, my sisters are leaving the system because of how much they hate it. There is also slight racism, I would say. One kid got expelled for having a nose peircing who was mixed, and another kid can get off with a warning if they're white. Overall, I don't want to go back to this school anymore, after everything that they had done to my family and I over this past year at the school.\n\nHorizon is pathetic when it comes to academic standards. It is important to understand that I graduated five years ago so what I am saying should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nHorizon is a good place when you agree with everything that they teach. Dissenting is frowned upon and changes the way people are treated. We were taught to view people that were not conservative evangelicals as projects to convert. The information that we were taught about other religions and even non-evangelical Christianity was extremely inaccurate and grounded in Anti-Catholicism, Anti-Semitism, and Islamophobia.\n\nScience education was taught through religious beliefs any engagement with Science (i.e. Evolution) was \"Hitler believed it\", and \"the Bible says so\" with zero credible evidence to back their claims.\n\nWe walked out unprepared to engage with the world around us and we were brainwashed to believed non-Evangelicals were enemies."
