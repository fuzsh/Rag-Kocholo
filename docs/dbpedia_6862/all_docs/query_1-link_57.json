        "text": "A charter school is a public school that must operate with a governing board, independently of any school committee under a five year charter granted by the Iowa State Board of Education (State Board). It has the freedom to organize around a core mission, curriculum, theme, and/or teaching method and to control its own budget and hire (and fire) teachers and staff. In return for this freedom, a charter school must attract students and produce positive results within five years or risk losing its charter. There are two categories of charter schools in Iowa:\n\nSchool board model. A school board may create a founding group to apply to the state board for approval to establish and operate a charter school within and as a part of the school district by (i) establishing a new attendance center, (ii) creating a new school within an existing attendance center, or (iii) converting an existing attendance center to charter status.\n\nFounding group model. A founding group may apply to the state board for approval to establish and operate a charter school within the boundaries of the state that operates as a new attendance center independently from a public school district.\n\nAll potential charter schools must complete an application to establish charter school status the year prior to operation. [256E.1, 256E4, 256E.5]\n\nBack to top\n\nGeneral Information\n\nCharter school laws were established in 2002 under Iowa Code 256F, which resulted in the authorization of two charter schools in Iowa. On July 1, 2021, Iowa Code 256E as well as House File 813 and 847, and Senate File 2368 were signed into law. Any entity that seeks charter school authorization in the state of Iowa must follow all codes and regulations under Iowa Code 256E. Note that charter schools established prior to July 1, 2021 are subject to requirements under Iowa Code 256F; no other charter schools may be established under this law.\n\nIowa Charter School General FAQ - More information about charter schools.\n\nBack to top\n\nParent Support\n\nParents have a variety of educational choice options for their children to obtain a high quality education in Iowa. Attending a charter school is one option. Open enrollment does not apply to charter schools, therefore parents may enroll students based on the charter school’s enrollment procedures, including deadlines (if any). See Authorized Charter Schools.\n\nBack to top\n\nApplication\n\nAny founding group may apply to establish a public charter school. If a founding group is created by a school board, the charter may be established in three ways: as a new attendance center, developing a new school within an existing attendance center, or converting an existing attendance center to a charter. If a founding group is created independent of a school district, the charter may be established and operate within the boundaries of the state [256E.1(2)].\n\n2024-25 Charter School Application Timeline\n\n2024-25 Charter School Application TimelineActionDue Date\n\nNotice of Intent to Apply\n\nAug. 2 - Sept. 3, 2024\n\nApplication Support Webinar\n\nAug. 21, 2024\n\nApplicant Office Hours\n\nSeptember - October 2024\n\nApplication Deadline\n\nNov. 1, 2024\n\nApplication Review\n\nCompleted 75 calendar days after submission\n\nNovember 2024 - January 2025\n\nAuthorization occurs during the January 2025 State Board meeting\n\nPublic Forums and Applicant Capacity Interviews\n\nNovember 2024 - January 2025\n\nContract Established\n\nCompleted 30 days after authorization\n\nFeb. 14, 2025\n\nContract approval occurs during the February 2025 State Board meeting\n\n1.
