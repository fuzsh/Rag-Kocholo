        "text": "Horizon Christian School, serving Southwest Portland for 44 years, is dedicated to glorifying God through a Christ-centered educational experience. We empower students to overcome challenges, embrace opportunities, and foster a genuine love for God, others, and their communities.\n\nOur journey began in 1980 when Horizon Community Church established the Christ-centered elementary school, known as Community Christian School (CCS). CCS quickly gained recognition as one of the finest primary schools in the Tualatin Valley, leading to increased enrollment. In 1987, we expanded with the addition of our licensed Learning Center. As demands grew, we further expanded in 1996, incorporating 7th and 8th-grade classes onto the Sagert Campus. In 1999, Pastor Stan and the church leadership envisioned a Christian high school. In 2006, Horizon Christian High School relocated to the spacious Boones Ferry Campus in Tualatin.\n\nIn 2007, the Learning Center, Elementary School, Middle School, and the High School were unified under the name Horizon Christian School. Today, we provide a safe and nurturing environment for approximately 715 students across our two campuses. Our comprehensive programs encompass academics, athletics, arts, activities, and spiritual formation. Both campuses offer excellent facilities designed to enhance the learning experience. The Sagert Campus spans six acres and hosts our kinger-8th grade students, while the Boones Ferry Campus, occupying 38.5 acres, is home to the Learning Center, preschool, and high school.\n\nSchool Sponsorship\n\nHorizon Christian School is a ministry of Horizon Community Church. We are a non-profit corporation organized under the laws of the State of Oregon. The school is parent-sponsored and governed by the Elder Board of Horizon Community Church. They set policy and direct the schools.\n\nHorizon Christian School's Accreditation\n\nHorizon Christian High School is accredited by AdvancED/Cognia and meets the requirements for graduation of the Oregon State Department of Education. Acceptance by the Oregon University System guarantees that Horizon Christian High School graduates will have full access to the college and/or university of their choice.\n\nHORIZON CHRISTIAN SCHOOL CULTURAL COMMITMENTS\n\nInterdenominational\n\nThe vision of Horizon Christian School is to develop a great school system, devoid of denominational distinctiveness, for the glory of God and as a ministry to the greater Portland metro area.\n\nWhoever Will May Come\n\nWe are not just open to current Jesus followers, but to every student who feels called here and is willing to abide by our student covenant, realizing that Jesus and Scripture will be intentionally and boldly taught at all levels.\n\nChanged Lives\n\nWe believe that the power, purpose, presence, and people of Jesus will change lives. We will use every opportunity to declare the good news of Jesus and the life-changing value of Scripture.\n\nDeveloping Greatness\n\nWe have high expectations of students and seek to develop and unleash their potential, with the understanding and belief that Jesus has greatness in mind!\n\nStaff Members\n\nStaff members are selected based in large part on their calling and commitment. We desire to have the best (character) and the brightest (competence) in the classroom and in our support and leadership positions. Horizon staff are challenged to be culturally relevant, decidedly relational and academically rigorous. We make it a priority to hire staff that are innovative, life-long learners and who are ready to pour their hearts into students.\n\nInterdenominational Position"
