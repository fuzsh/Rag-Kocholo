At Horizon Christian School we believe that educating a child is of the highest calling. Since 1977, we have made that calling our priority by providing quality Christian education for families in the Columbia Gorge area. At Horizon, we are dedicated to helping each student develop their full potential by educating Academic achievement, Biblical truth, and Christian character development. We stress a challenging academic program taught by caring, experienced teachers using the highest quality curriculum integrated with a biblical worldview.

Everything we are about at Horizon centers around our mission to build a solid foundation for life by providing students with an excellent education that integrates Academic achievement, Biblical truth, and Christian Character development.
