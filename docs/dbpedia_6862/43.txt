Quick Facts

About Us

Horizon Christian School is a pre-K through 12th grade private Christian school located centrally in the beautiful Columbia River Gorge, just 60 miles east of Portland, OR. Views of the mighty Columbia, majestic Mt. Adams to the north and Mt. Hood to the south provide a picturesque setting for the valley known for its fruit and recreational opportunities. Students come from a radius of 30 miles in all directions-across the river in Washington state to Trout Lake and Stevenson, east to The Dalles, south to Parkdale and Mt. Hood, and west to Cascade Locks. A bus service provides transportation for those students across the river and to the east.
