S.B

Rabenau was not in the very first group of sailors to go down to the peninsula, but was added to their strength sometime later.

“... an action which took place on the left of Zığındere. …...the Turkish troops in the trench had withdrawn early during the attack of 4 June and only the German machine guns were being fired, until their ammunition ran out or the guns were unserviceable. In the end, the men who were now only able to defend themselves with their pistols, were taken prisoner by soldiers of the Kings Own Scottish Borderers. Lieutenant von Rabenau had been seriously wounded in this engagement, but he was fortunate enough to make a full recovery later as a prisoner of war on Malta.”

Rabenau is mentioned by Admiral Souchon in his telegram (of 9th August 1915) to Berlin requesting replacements.

Others mentioned were “Sub Lieutenant Branconi repatriated for health reasons, Sub Lieutenant Hildebrandt, German Naval Shore Detachment, killed in action.”
