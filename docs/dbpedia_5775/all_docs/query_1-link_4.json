        "text": "Rabenau, Friedrich von, born 10-10-1884 in Berlin to the physician Friedrich von Rabenau, 1847–1885 and Wally, born Noebel.\n\nHis eight years older brother Karl Wilhelm Friedrich von Rabenau (born 24-05-1876 in Vienenburg / Harz; died 22-11-1952 in Werchow / Kreis Calau) was a German naval, colonial and army officer and farmer who from 1904 Took part in the Battle of Kub of the Hottentot War in the German protected area of German South West Africa until 1905.
