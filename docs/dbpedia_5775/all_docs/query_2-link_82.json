        "text": "The WWII entries in the index below were derived from 59 pages of POW deaths in America compiled by the Office of the Quartermaster General of the US Army and dated 10 August 1946 and revised at a later date (probably February 1947 to show the changes in grave locations necessary for permanent location at a government installation). A copy of this cover letter can be seen at www.gentracer.org/gravelocationsletter.html. The index is merged with current lists from each cemetery listed, as well as additional documents found in the National Archives in College Park, MD. WWI entries are incorporated in with WWII entries for a more complete index.\n\nAnalysis of Database: A total of 901 Germans (includes 3 Russians, 4 Austrians, 1 Yugoslavian, 1 Czech and 1 Turk, 21 from WWI), 172 Italians, 23 Japanese (includes 1 Korean) soldiers of 1,175 POWs who died while held in the US during World Wars I & II. The 78 WWI German POWs buried at Chattanooga National Cemetery have not yet been incorporated into this index. The earliest WWII death date that appears is 9 May 1942 and the latest is 23 June 1946, however many death dates are not shown and at least 18 dead POW's were buried on 18 April 1942. The cemetery containing the largest number of POW burials is the Chattanooga National Cemetery.\n\nPlace of Burial (in the United States): A total of 90 U.S. Military and POW cemeteries are listed. Some of the places may have changed since this listing when the government land containing the cemetery was privatized, causing those graves to be relocated to a federal installation. Notations regarding current locations are made when known on the list of cemeteries. Some of these cemeteries also contain the graves of World War I German POWs.\n\nThe WWII German soldiers in this list were generously indexed by John Movius of the Continental European Family History Association\n\nAre You Seeking More Information?: Please send an email using the link at the bottom of this page to see what has been learned and/or where to gain more information.\n\nAbbreviations Used Below:\n\n(1),e (2), etc. = different POW's with the same full name\n\n(a), (b), etc. = different unkown POW's\n\nFNU = First Name Unknown\n\nLNU = Last Name Unknown\n\nPage # * = Page number of the 56 page attachment letter to the International Red Cross.\n\nAdditional sources of the information on these pages are at the NARA in RG 389, Entry 467, Box 1513 + 1529 and Entry 461, Box 2562.\n\nSurname, Given Name ...
