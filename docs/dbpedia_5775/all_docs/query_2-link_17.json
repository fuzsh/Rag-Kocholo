On 30 April 1945 after the evacuation of Brno garrison, Schauschütz was named the commander of Gestapo \"Aussenstelle\" (outer office) in Velke Mezirici in Moravia. His task was to help the military garrison secure the town which was on the important escape route of Heeresgruppe Mittte. There was a large uprising in the town on 6 May 1945. Schauschütz was among several German officers which conferred with the revolutionary group and assured it that no actions would be taken against the Czechs if they wouldn´t use weapons. The treaty was betrayed as Schauschütz informed neighboring garrisons and the town was retaken with probably 100 local men taken prisoner. On 7 May 1945, the execution of 60 civilian men took place. According to one of several versions, Schauschütz personally ordered the mass murder. Thereafter, Schauschütz made it to the U.S. zone and pretended to be a Wehrmacht officer coming back from the field hospital, possessing no personal ID. Later he had obtained counterfeit documents \"proofing\" he was a Heer member and sent to a POW camp where all the POWs were given over to the Russians; Schauschütz was identified as high ranking Gestapo officer.
