        "text": "The communist-era secret police archives have a peculiar afterlife in postsocialist Eastern Europe. On the one hand, those archives have become the site to articulate different visions of justice and social transformation and harboured the modernist promise of transparency, and, on the other, the secret police archives, especially in Poland, have become the object of popular suspicions of treachery and secrecy, with respect to their informational content, political instrumentalization, and highly restricted public access. This article focuses on the contentious popular cultural-political life of the communist-era secret police archives in postsocialist Poland. It examines the way those archives have come to produce such ambivalent desires and attachments across social groups and classes, and become part of hegemonic political struggles. Specifically, I focus on Poland’s state-run Institute of National Remembrance, which manages those archives and prosecutes the ‘crimes against the Polish nation.’ By drawing on my ethnographic research at this Institute and analysing popular cultural productions, especially, the ‘documentary-play’ called ‘Files,’ performed by the well-known ex-dissident ‘Theater of the Eighth Day,’ my article shows how this Institute and theatre performance seek to popularize different understandings of the archive and forms of knowing, feeling, and doing.\n\nOn December 7, 1999, the Law no. 187, on access to one’s own file and the disclosure of Securitate as a political police, was adopted by the Romanian Parliament. The law established the creation of an institution (Consiliul Național pentru Studierea Arhivelor Securității-The National Council for the Study of Securitate Archives-CNSAS) whose mission is to collect all documents issued by the former Communist Secret Police (the notorious Securitate) and made them available to the researchers and the larger audience upon request as well as to reveal the agents of the repression. My article deals with the creation, its functionning, and the controversies which surrounded this institution from 2000 onwards. I argue that the archive of the Securitate was instrumentalized by various actors of the public space in their struggle for power, namely for controlling the cultural, economic, and political fields of power (les champs du pouvoir) and did not accomplish its mission to reveal the agent..."
