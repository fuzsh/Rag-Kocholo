Subayi (Reserve battalion in Canakkale 2 subunit) 1915- WIA & PoW 4-6-15 at Gully Ravine\n\nI can't find who he is can you fill some gaps?\n\nThere also appears to be this man\n\nPeters Wilhelm Pte Naval Naval MG Sects Marine-Landungsabteilung at Gallipoli 1915- reported PoW by British escaped 4-6-15 died 7-9-15 reason not stated\n\nAny ideas\n\nS.B\n\nRabenau was not in the very first group of sailors to go down to the peninsula, but was added to their strength sometime later.\n\n“... an action which took place on the left of Zığındere. …...the Turkish troops in the trench had withdrawn early during the attack of 4 June and only the German machine guns were being fired, until their ammunition ran out or the guns were unserviceable. In the end, the men who were now only able to defend themselves with their pistols, were taken prisoner by soldiers of the Kings Own Scottish Borderers. Lieutenant von Rabenau had been seriously wounded in this engagement, but he was fortunate enough to make a full recovery later as a prisoner of war on Malta.”\n\nRabenau is mentioned by Admiral Souchon in his telegram (of 9th August 1915) to Berlin requesting replacements.\n\nOthers mentioned were “Sub Lieutenant Branconi repatriated for health reasons, Sub Lieutenant Hildebrandt, German Naval Shore Detachment, killed in action.”\n\nDetails from Col. Klaus Wolf's book\n\nEdited 11 February , 2019 by michaeldr"
