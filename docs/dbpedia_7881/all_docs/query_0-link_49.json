        "text": "Hater\n\nAfter leaving Monster Magnet, McBain moved to Washington State to create the garage-rock group Hater, along with Matt Cameron (Soundgarden, Pearl Jam), Ben Shepherd (Soundgarden) and Brian Wood (brother of Mother Love Bone vocalist Andrew Wood). The band released two albums of their brand of garage/psychedelic rock: their self-titled debut in 1993 and their follow-up, The 2nd, which was recorded in 1995 but released in 2005.\n\nIn 1997, after Hater broke up, McBain participated in the first Desert Sessions, a musical project led by Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme. There he befriended ex-Kyuss/Fu Manchu drummer Brant Bjork.\n\nHe was a live member of the Queens of the Stone Age for their first three shows, and co-wrote the song \"Regular John\" which appears on their self-titled debut album.\n\nWellwater Conspiracy\n\nIn 1997, McBain and Matt Cameron created the Wellwater Conspiracy along with Ben Shepherd. Their debut release was Declaration of Conformity, released in 1997 on the Third Gear label. Shortly after the release, Cameron was chosen to replace Jack Irons as drummer for rock group Pearl Jam. However, Cameron maintained both groups, contributing to a further three Wellwater Conspiracy albums. Notable appearances include keyboardist Glenn Slater of folk rock group The Walkabouts, Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam and Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age and Kyuss.\n\nSolo career\n\nIn 2004, John moved to San Francisco, refining material that he had accumulated which he believed wasn't in step with the Wellwater Conspiracy's garage rock style. In February 2006 he released The In-Flight Feature on Duna Records (founded by Brant Bjork). In 2012 McBain collaborated with Carlton Melton on their Smoke Drip 12 inch LP\n\nDiscography\n\nWith Monster Magnet:\n\nMonster Magnet - 1990 (EP)\n\nTab - 1991 (EP)\n\nSpine of God - 1991\n\nWith Hater:\n\nHater - 1993\n\nThe 2nd - 2005\n\nWith Devilhead\n\nPest Control - 1996\n\nWith Wellwater Conspiracy:\n\nDeclaration of Conformity - 1997\n\nBrotherhood of Electric: Operational Directives - 1999\n\nThe Scroll and Its Combinations - 2001\n\nWellwater Conspiracy - 2003\n\nSolo work:\n\nThe In-Flight Feature - 2006\n\nOther Contributions:\n\nDesert Sessions Vol 1 & 2 - 1998\n\nDesert Sessions Vol 3 & 4 - 1998\n\nThe Freeks - The Freeks - 2008"
