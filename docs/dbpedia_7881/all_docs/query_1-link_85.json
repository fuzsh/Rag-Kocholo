        "text": "I got a new computer and I had to transfer all my old files from the last computer. So, as I’m going through all my files and personal data, I’m deciding what needs to be salvaged and saved. I have over 120GBs of music and it’s all from ripped CDs. I still collect some CDs from used record stores but I won’t pay over 10$ (and it has to be a really awesome CD for me to go that high). Now that the history of the entire world, all of art and expression, and the whole summation of our complete human existence is accessible for next to nothing in mere seconds via the internet, I don’t really see why I would need to copy that 120GBs of music to my new computer. So, I decided that I would only copy music NOT on Spotify, but it very well may be on YouTube or Apple Music (but I doubt Apple Music because they don’t have the same breadth of genre and eccentricity as Spotify).\n\nI reluctantly switched to Spotify from physical copies back in 2016, but I see now that it makes so much more sense nowadays. I haven’t looked back. But I have looked closely and investigated what music Spotify has yet to collect the distribution rights for. As I’ve looked, I’ve found that some albums are incomplete and certain songs are blacked out (like ‘T.V. Age’ on Joe Jackson’s 1982 album Night and Day which is a song about technology and mocks modern conveniences and I always thought Jackson purposefully made that one track unavailable as some sort of commentary or inside joke about streaming services but alas even now that song is free to use). I wonder why certain songs on certain albums would be unavailable. I don’t know.\n\nSo I will give you my observations and list of what music is currently unavailable on Spotify at the time of this post. Please comment if you find others not available. There are probably plenty of Jazz, Classical, Rap, and Folk musicians missing on Spotify that I am unaware of. I focus mostly on Rock, Electronic/Techno, and Pop music.\n\nSome other people have already cataloged what’s missing from Spotify but I don’t find them very complete. I can remember some big artists holding out (Neil Young, Prince, Taylor Swift, The Beatles, Jason Aldean, Thom Yorke) but at the moment of this writing, all of those artists have given in without so much a yelp… and I LOL, where are their principles!\n\nI’m sure there’s a person or a team of people at Spotify whose job it is to find and acquire past music still missing from their digital libraries (or maybe there’s not and they will just outsource that job to me upon discovering my blog post!)\n\nHere’s my list of music NOT on Spotify:\n\nGarth Brooks – Probably the biggest name whose music is still not on Spotify (and neither is his alter ego), but I don’t know his music so I don’t really care. But he’s held out the longest!\n\nJoanna Newsom – Great singer/songwriter/lyricist/harpist. All her albums are absent from Spotify. She is apparently adamantly against streaming services. But is on Apple Music? Dang. She’s great. Most of her albums are engineered by Steve Albini.\n\nMy Bloody Valentine – Their most recent album MBV (2013) is oddly missing. I wish I could hear it!\n\nJohn Frusciante – His second druggie album Smile from the Streets You Hold (1997) is not there. But his first one is Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-shirt (1994). Why? Beats me. I appreciate his weirdness.\n\nThe Cowboy Bebop Soundtrack – Good collection of songs for an even greater show; too bad you can’t listen to it without keeping YouTube open and running out your iPhone battery!\n\nJaco Pastorius – Poor guy died in a bar brawl back in the 80s. Regarded as one of, if not THE best bassists of rock music. His solo album (1976) is sadly not available on Spotify. It will show up but is missing all but two songs (the first and last song lol).\n\nScott Weiland – His album after Velvet Underground Happy in Galoshes (2008) is not found, which is strange since he was so popular and visible and I don’t really get why it wouldn’t be here. Also engineered by Steve Albini.\n\nBeavis and Butthead Do America – This movie soundtrack (1996) can be found on Spotify but has about half of the tracks inaccessible, most notably RHCP’s cover of Ohio Players’ “Love Rollercoaster.” Such a rad rendition! I can rap the whole interlude.\n\nNo Alternative – This is a token of the CD era. It’s a compilation of ‘alternative’ rock artists and some original songs (1993) that benefited the AIDS relief. About half of the songs are blotted out of Spotify and those songs are available in various forms on their respective artists’ pages, check out Smashing Pumpkins’ “Glynis” and Nirvana’s “Verse Chorus Verse”\n\nSpeedy J – Obscure but transcendent electronic musician grouped in with Aphex Twin, Warp Records, and the IDM scene of the 90s. Unfortunately, Spotify is missing the best of his discography, especially his album Public Energy No.1 (1997).\n\nDJ Shadow – I finally picked up his debut album Endtroducing (1996) almost a year and a half ago and I blasted that thing for weeks. Such a good album. And so I hunted for more of his stuff of CD and I found the follow-up EP Preemptive Strike (1998) and I was overjoyed. On Spotify, a few months ago, I saw that about a third of the EP’s tracks were missing. Now, as I look, I see that every track is available except for track 7 “What Does Your Soul Look Like – Part 4” but thankfully my favorite track is “What Does Your Soul Look Like – Part 2” clocking in at 13min.\n\nThe Orb – One of my favorite electronic groups around, still pumping out the stuff decades later! Right on! But I see that almost all of their Live ’93 album is blacked out.\n\nWagon Christ – Another lesser-known-in-the-states breakbeat/drum-n-bass artist from the UK but so singular, funny, and textured. I found his 1998 album Tally Ho! for .99 cents in a junk rack ina Goodwill in lower Manhattan. I flipped my shit. I couldn’t believe they were selling this thing for less than a dollar. I felt like I was stealing a priceless piece of art. It’s weird how it’s the only album of his not found on Spotify. But I have it hahahaha!\n\nCaustic Window – I got this one through an Aphex Twin fanclub in TX. Not on Spotify.\n\nSnatch – One of my favorite movies. Soundtrack unavailable (2001). It is a great, eclectic mix. Tracks by the band Klint and a rendition of “Hernando’s Hideaway” by the Johnston Brothers you cannot hear on your precious Spotify\n\nGlobal Communication – Their only album 76:14 is on Spotify and you should def listen if you haven’t because it’s life-changing, but it’s missing the second disc that came in the 10th anniversary reissue. But I have it after I bought it used for 13$ at Amoeba in LA! Siiick. Some good supplemental tracks and original compositions. It made my trip to downtown LA all worth it.\n\nExcursions in Ambience – Another excellent product of the 90s CD era. A compilation by the US electronic imprint Astralwerks. There were three comps made. I have the third one. And from what I can remember, most of it’s long track list was ho-hum except for the last song: Aphex Twin’s “No. 19” (better known as “Stone in Focus”). It was left off of his 1994 album Selected Ambient Works II and is not available on Spotify either. A sublime track.\n\nAFX – You’ll see that a good bit of these involve Aphex Twin and that’s because he has so much music and so many aliases and makes songs available through all different sources (Soundcloud, his own website, Spotify). His landmark EP Analogue Bubblebath (1991) is not on Spotify and it’s got some chill tracks for IDM lovers.\n\nDeconstruction – Horribly underrated, tragically overlooked, very impressive album. Produced by Rick Rubin. It was the experimental aftermath of Jane’s Addiction with the bassist and guitarist coming together to write some epic 90s rock. I’m proud to say I own two copies of this CD. I hope it’s never put on streaming services. So there.\n\nSpacemen 3 – First band of Spiritualized’s Jason Pierce. I don’t really know them. I have never found their stuff on CD either.\n\nDesert Sessions – Josh Homme’s jam collab project. Sadly, the best volumes (1-8) are not on Spotify. Vols 1-2 are incredible.\n\nPat Smear – Germs guitarist, Nirvana touring member. Put out a solo album So You Fell in Love with a Musician… in 1992 on SST and it is wacky, dirty, and excellent. No track is alike. Missing out, friends!\n\nBorn to Choose – Another token 90s alternative rock compilation benefiting women’s rights, pro-choice organizations, and about sexual freedom (1993). I bought it for Soundgarden’s song “HIV Baby” and that song (and this comp) are not readily available on Spotify.\n\nCaptain Beefheart – How is every other piece of his discography up on Spotify except his most notorious and famous album Trout Mask Replica (1969)? Some body bungled the rights, maybe? I’ve listened to it all the way through twice and I still don’t know it. I gotta go back.\n\nBasketball Diaries – A soundtrack to a 90s movie starring a young Leonardo DiCaprio (1995). I never saw it. But I got the soundtrack because it has original songs by Flea “I’ve Been Down”, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden “Blind Dogs”; all of which cannot be found on Spotify. The album is on there but is missing some of the best songs.\n\nMoby Grape – Influential California classic rock group. Their most famous debut eponymous album (1967) is mostly absent on Spotify. I don’t understand.\n\nDrive Like Jehu – Their eponymous debut album (1991) is also gone.\n\nRickie Lee Jones – It seems the only album missing is my favorite: Ghostyhead (1997). It is mesmerizing, confounding, dreamy, beautiful. It’s like an American country-ish Kid A before Radiohead even did Kid A, in my opinion. Sorry you can’t save it.\n\nAtaxia – Side project of John Frusciante, Joe Lally, and Josh Klinghoffer. Missing.\n\nCurve – Grimy shoegaze rock from UK. Their most acclaimed 90s albums ain’t here. I’m still trying to get into them.\n\nSub Pop 200 – Seattle indie record imprint sampler from 1988 that predates grunge but has some of the most recognizable names: Nirvana, Soundgarden, Screaming Trees, Green River. Not on Spotify.\n\nEchobrain – The band that broke up Metallica! Their previously-much-anticipated debut album (2002) is not accessible on Spotify. It’s a pretty good album. Doesn’t sound like Metallica much at all. And that’s good!\n\nFuck Buttons – Their debut album Street Horrrsing (2008) not here. Too bad because I think it’s their best and most original. I tried to go see them but my friend bailed on me. Great album if you trudge through it with an open mind.\n\nIndio – One guy: Gordon Peterson. Canadian. Released his only album under this name on A&M 1989 titled Big Harvest. Even Joni Mitchell was on it! I found it after Eddie Vedder covered Indio song “Hard Sun” for the movie “Into the Wild.” I need to listen to it again because I don’t remember digging it all that much.\n\nJames Iha – Rhythm guitarist for Smashing Pumpkins. Put out a solo acoustic folky lovey-dovey album Let it Come Down in 1998. Not on Spotify. And I don’t think that’s too much of a crime. It was meh.\n\nPsi Com – First raw 80s punk band of Jane’s Addiction’s lead man Perry Farrell. Their discography isn’t available. It’s good.\n\nRapeman – Much maligned name for a band, but Steve Albini is an instigator. Name aside, their only album Two Nuns and a Pack Mule from 1988 is killer. Not on Spotify, possibly for obvious/censorship reasons? Has a cool cover of ZZ Top\n\nThree Fish – Jangly, hypnotic, bleak, ethereal, natural. Side project of Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament. Has some Eastern vibes. Both their late 90s albums aren’t included on Spotify. I suggest their first album and song “Zagreb.”\n\nWellwater Conspiracy – Spotify has about half of their material, but still missing their self-titled (2003), first album Declarations of Conformity (1997), and The Scroll and it’s Combinations (2001). Mostly good stuff, off-shoot of grunge.\n\nXTC – Hard-to-put-your-finger-on 80s band. They changed considerably from their onset to their hiatus. Their final two albums (Apple Venus Volume 1 (1999) and Wasp Star Apple Venus Volume 2 (2000)) aren’t on Spotify. They are very mature, confident, and unique records.\n\nZwan – Goofy project band after Smashing Pumpkins. One album in 2003 Mary Star of the Sea. Milquetoast. If you search the name on Spotify, you’ll find some euro/Russian electronic producer instead.\n\nPage & Plant – Second reunion album of Led Zeppelin’s most known members, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant. Walking into Clarksdale (1998). Engineered by Steve Albini. Great mixture of rock, blues, and relevant Zep vibes.\n\nDr. Dre – I can’t believe The Chronic is not on Spotify. It’s so heavy, so gangsta, so Dre, so LA, so 90s. Why? Why not? C’mon, put it on there now!"
