        "text": "Ace Frehley, born Paul Daniel Frehley on April 27, 1951, is a celebrated figure in the world of rock music. Known for his distinctive style and energetic performances, Frehley gained fame as the lead guitarist for the iconic band, KISS. He was instrumental in defining the group's sound with his powerful guitar riffs and solos, and his character, \"the Spaceman,\" added a unique element to the band's theatrical performances. Born and raised in The Bronx, New York, Frehley was introduced to music at a young age, his love for the guitar ignited by artists like Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton. Frehley's career with KISS began in 1973, marking the start of a significant period of musical innovation and success for him. As part of KISS, he co-wrote and performed on several of the band's hits, including \"Cold Gin,\" \"Parasite,\" and \"Shock Me.\" His contributions played a key role in helping KISS achieve multi-platinum status and international acclaim. Despite personal struggles with substance abuse, Frehley's influence remained strong throughout his tenure with KISS which lasted until 1982. He later returned to the band from 1996 to 2002 before fully committing to his solo career. As a solo artist, Ace Frehley enjoyed considerable success. His 1978 self-titled album, released during his initial run with KISS, produced the hit single \"New York Groove,\" which reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100. Following his departure from KISS, Frehley released multiple albums that showcased his songwriting skills and virtuosic guitar playing. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of KISS in 2014, cementing his legacy as a rock icon.\n\nAnthrax is an American thrash metal band from New York City, formed in 1981 by guitarist Scott Ian and bassist Dan Lilker. The group was considered one of the leaders of the thrash metal scene during the 1980s. When the genre's popularity increased, Anthrax was one of its \"big four\" with Metallica, Megadeth and Slayer. As of 2014 the band has released ten studio albums, a number of singles and an EP with American hip hop group Public Enemy. According to Nielsen SoundScan Anthrax sold 2.5 million records in the United States from 1991 to 2004, with worldwide sales of over 15 million. Noted for its live performances, Anthrax signed with the independent label Megaforce Records. Lilker soon left the band to form Nuclear Assault, and was replaced by roadie Frank Bello. Vocalist Neil Turbin left shortly after and was replaced by Joey Belladonna. With a new lineup, the band recorded Spreading the Disease in 1985. Anthrax's third album, Among the Living, was released in 1987 to critical praise. The band experienced another lineup change in 1992, when John Bush replaced Belladonna as lead vocalist.\n\nBad Brains are an American rock band formed in Washington, D.C. in 1976. Originally a jazz fusion band under the name Mind Power, they are widely regarded as pioneers of hardcore punk, though the band's members have objected to the use of this term to describe their music. They are also an adept reggae band, while later recordings featured elements of other genres like funk, heavy metal, hip hop, and soul. Rolling Stone magazine called them \"the mother of all black hard-rock bands\", and they have been cited as a seminal influence to numerous subgenres of heavy metal, including thrash/speed metal, alternative metal, funk metal and rap/nu metal. Bad Brains are followers of the Rastafari movement. Bad Brains have released nine studio albums. They have broken up and reformed several times over their career, sometimes with different singers or drummers. Their classic lineup includes singer H.R., guitarist Dr. Know, bassist Darryl Jenifer, and drummer Earl Hudson.\n\nBlue Cheer was an American rock band that initially performed and recorded in the late 1960s and early 1970s and was sporadically active until 2009. Based in San Francisco, Blue Cheer played in a psychedelic blues rock or acid rock style, and are also credited as being some of the earliest pioneers of heavy metal, with their cover of \"Summertime Blues\" sometimes cited as the first in the genre. They have also been noted as influential in the development of genres as disparate as punk rock, stoner rock, doom metal, experimental rock, and grunge.\"Blue Cheer\" was the name of a variety of LSD made by chemist and Grateful Dead patron Owsley Stanley and the band was probably named after that, although the name existed earlier, as the name of a laundry detergent after which the LSD variety itself was named."
