        "text": "Hard rock outfit Queens Of The Stone Age has confirmed an extensive slate of tour dates that will take the band to the Far East, Down Under, and across the U.S. Things get underway tonight (Jan. 10) in Fukuoka, Japan, to be followed by a previously announced stint on the annual Big Day Out tour of Australia and New Zealand. U.S. dates begin Feb. 22 in Las Vegas and wrap March 24 in Norfolk, Va.\n\nThe group is touring in support of its second Interscope album “Songs for the Deaf,” which is No. 51 in its 19th week on The Billboard 200. The single “No One Knows” is No. 3 on Billboard’s Modern Rock Tracks chart and No. 14 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks tally.\n\nEarlier this week, the song was nominated for a best hard performance Grammy, battling such competition as the Foo Fighters’ “All My Life,” Godsmack’s “I Stand Alone,” P.O.D.’s “Youth of the Nation,” and System Of A Down’s “Aerials.”\n\nIn the midst of the upcoming tour, QOTSA will perform Jan. 18 on the Fox show “MADtv.” During the three-week break between its last Big Day Out show and the Vegas U.S. tour opener, the members of Queens plan to record the ninth installment of the “Desert Sessions” CD series, which has previously featured guest shots by Screaming Trees frontman (and current QOTSA member) Mark Lanegan, Soundgarden bassist Ben Shepherd, Dwarves vocalist Blag Jesus, and Monster Magnet/Wellwater Conspiracy principal John McBain, among others.
