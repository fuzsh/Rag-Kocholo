        "text": "Eddie Vedder showed up by surprise during a recent set from The Strokes, who are on the road with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.\n\nVedder appeared during The Strokes’ opening set for the Chili Peppers at T-Mobile Park in Seattle yesterday (August 3) and provided vocals on “Juicebox.”\n\nMore importantly, look at Vedder going “full Dad” with his dance moves. Sure, he is an actual dad, but that’s easy to forget about because he’s Eddie Vedder.\n\nEither way, enjoy the fan-shot video below, if only to see just how much fun Vedder is having.\n\nEddie Vedder - His 28 Best Songs, Outside Of Pearl Jam\n\nEddie Vedder hasn’t been as prolific with side-projects as his Pearl Jam bandmates: Stone Gossard used to have a band called Brad (R.I.P. Shawn Smith) and currently is a band called Painted Shield; he’s also done solo records. Jeff Ament has been part of Three Fish, Tres Mtns. and RNDM, and has put out a bunch of solo songs. Matt Cameron’s discography includes a number of projects including Hater, Wellwater Conspiracy, Harrybu McCage and Ten Commandos. Mike McCready, meanwhile, has been a member of Mad Season and the Rockfords.\n\nVedder, meanwhile, has just three solo albums to his name, so far: but it turns out that he has a pretty impressive discography outside of the band. He’s frequently contributed songs to various artist compilations, done one-off singles, and collaborated with other artists. Here are some of our favorite Vedder moments outside of Pearl Jam.\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014. The coolest event she's ever covered in person was the 2021 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony. (Sir Paul McCartney inducting Foo Fighters? C'mon now!) She's also well-versed in etiquette and extraordinarily nice. #TransRightsAreHumanRights\n\nSign me up for the ROCK 92.9 email newsletter!\n\nBe the first to know about rock news, upcoming shows, plus exclusive prizes, giveaways, and more!\n\nFirst Name *\n\nLast Name\n\nEmail *\n\nBy clicking \"Subscribe\" I agree to the website's terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
