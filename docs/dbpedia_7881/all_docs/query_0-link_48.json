        "text": "Wellwater Conspiracy (feat members of Monster Magnet/Soundgarden/Pearl Jam) reissue debut album ‘Declaration Of Conformity’ via God Unknown Records\n\nFormed by Monster Magnet’s John McBain and Soundgarden’s Matt Cameron & Ben Shepherd in 1993 during some downtime from their day jobs and side project Hater (who released a self-titled album in 1993), Wellwater Conspiracy set about immersing themselves in the dayglo world of sixties psychedelia, channelling the vibrations of Syd Barrett’s Pink Floyd and the 13th Floor Elevators to produce the garage lo-fi-lysergic assault on the senses that is their debut album ‘Declaration of Conformity’. Originally issued on Mudhoney’s Steve Turners Super Electro label in 1997, the album was met with critical acclaim upon its release and Rolling Stone magazine said, “Declaration’s tinny, fuzzed-out sonics decidedly evoke the Summer of Love.”\n\nGod Unknown Records are proud to be welcoming the album back into print and on all digital platforms, and this coming September 22nd will see the release of a remastered vinyl pressing with extra tracks and new artwork taking influence from Blue Note Records fabled artwork.\n\nThe pre-order link for the album is here: https://godunknownrecords.bandcamp.com/album/declaration-of-conformity\n\nThe Bandcamp link will also feature two bonus download only tracks, a cover of ‘Akka Ragga’ by Shocking Blue and ‘Late Night’ by Syd Barrett. Both tracks feature Josh Homme on guitar and bass.\n\nWatch the new video created by John McBain for ‘The Ending’ – Wellwater Conspiracy – The Ending (Monster Magnet / Soundgarden / Pearl Jam) God Unknown Records – YouTube"
