        "text": "Could you not have gone to Lolla in '96 when you were 16?\n\nAs mentioned upthread, that was my first concert, me a skinny kid of 16. Very rowdy crowd, people crowd surfing / landing on my head, and it seemed like oceans of beer got spilled on me. My friend and I basically came for Soundgarden, and when Metallica played afterward, we just walked around the grounds and mostly ignored them. And Soundgarden certainly didn't disappoint (I'd have to look but their set was heavy on Upside / Superunknown).\n\nThat was a great year, Screaming Trees also played (but I didn't know their stuff then, and it mostly went over my head; Josh Homme was playing second guitar with them live back then), Violent Femmes, and Ramones as well.\n\nMan, the shift in the band's sound was tangible when Shepherd came along. The bass is absolutely pulverizing on Badmotorfinger in the best way. Nothing against Hiro Y, who was also awesome, but Shepherd was like the missing piece of their sound. And he wrote some interesting and quirky songs as well.\n\nHow long has Cameron been going now after joining up with Pearl Jam, 30+ years? Dude is a rock vet if there ever was one. And he has his Wellwater Conspiracy albums, and a solo record from like 2017 that's pretty good!\n\nAll that he's seen and done, I'm sure Cameron could write a book.\n\nI was still too scared in 1996 to go to concerts and Loloploozo was a long drive away my parents would have had to drive. My first concert was Megadeth in 1995 and it too scary for me. Saw The Jesus Lizard in 1997 with a fake ID and that still too scary. Wasn’t comfortable to see metal shows until 1998. That’s why I’m mad cause my friends and I shouldn’t have been such wimps and missed all our favorite bands.\n\nI got into them early through my punk rock friends and still celebrate their whole catalog. I got to see them play several times throughout the years. For me there was always a feeling that I was lucky to be able to see them. I felt as though I would be in the presence of greatness and really didn't deserve to be. The last time I saw them was May 14th 2017. It was without a doubt the best I had ever heard them. Texted a friend who was also at the show and who I had seen them with before from the parking lot. He agreed it was their best show by far that we had seen. I was so excited to see what would come next as far as new music. 4 days later I turned on the morning news from bed as I always do and Chris's passing was the very first thing we heard. It affected me.\n\nI consider Karaoke, Cold Bitch, Toy Box, Kyle Petty Son Of Richard, Heretic and HIV Baby as some of the band's best songs in their catalog and all of them are b-sides, and I'm not even mentioning the amazing live versions of songs like Beyond The Wheel, Kickstand, Jesus Christ Pose, Fell On Black Days and stuff from the Louder Than Live promo CD that were also released as b-sides, as well as some covers (Show Me, Into The Void, Stray Cat Blues) are also solid material. Sure there are some nonsensical stuff and remix as b-sides but it's mostly solid stuff.\n\nOther stuff that appears on compilations like Birth Ritual, Blind Dogs, Sub Pop Rock City and the New Damage version featuring Brian May is something I come back to frequently as well.\n\nOne of my favorite live recordings of them was in January ‘95 in Eddie Vedder’s house. Pearl Jam put on a radio broadcast called Self Pollution Radio, and any station could pick it up live and air it. My station in East Lansing carried it, and I taped it. One of my most cherished cassettes for years. Mad Season played stuff from the forthcoming Above, and Mudhoney played stuff from My Brother the Cow. Of course Pearl Jam played a bunch from Vitalogy. Every set was killer with just raw, garage like sound.\n\nSoundgarden was between records, so they played some unreleased stuff, including Blind Dogs, Kyle Petty son of Richard, No Attention and the alternate version of Fell on Black Days (known as Black Days III now). Other than the lyrics to the chorus, it bears no resemblance to Fell on Black Days. It’s a totally different song. There’s a studio version on Echo of Miles, but to me this Self Pollution version is the definitive version. Apparently video footage emerged at some point (see below). The footage mostly captures Matt, but nothing wrong with that!\n\nI remember that radio program well, I also taped it. So cool to hear the early Mad Season songs. If I’m not mistaken, that’s also where Dave Grohl debuted the early Foo Fighters stuff as well.\n\nYes, check out Echoes of Miles box set, it has a great deal of b-sides, covers and appearances on other albums. If you want a couple of songs to start with check out the ones I mentioned above: Karaoke, Cold Bitch, Toy Box, Kyle Petty Son Of Richard, Heretic and HIV Baby. Non-album songs you need to check out are Bleed Together, Birth Ritual, Blind Dogs, Sub Pop Rock City and the New Damage version featuring Brian May.\n\nLive performances that appear on b-sides you have to listen to are Beyond The Wheel, Kickstand, Jesus Christ Pose, Fell On Black Days and My Wave. Excellent covers worth checking out are Big Bottom / Earache My Eye (live Spinal Tap / Cheech & Chong cover) Into the Void (Sealth), Stray Cat Blues and I Can't Give You anything. You're good to go from there!\n\nThanks for the detailed response. I'm stoked to have this to look forward to!"
