Cool new interview with Matt:

I'm sorry if this is common knowledge, but I had no idea. I think Matt would have been a fantastic fit for QOTSA, his style would have really suited the band (not that I don't like Matt in PJ).

"I was in a band called The Wellwater Conspiracy with John McBain. We met on a Monster Magnet tour in 1993, I believe, and we formed that band. Josh Homme was just coming off tour with The Screaming Trees, and he was writing a bunch of material, so we knew Josh from playing in The Screaming Trees and from playing around town. He recruited me and John to work out some new music, which eventually became Queens of the Stone Age.

I guess the first incarnation was me, McBain, Josh and Mike, the bass player who used to be in Dinosaur Jr. We played one show together at OK Hotel. I guess it just sort of felt like we were subbing for Josh until he found permanent bandmates. But I love that band, I think they're great. It was really fun times and Josh played on a Wellwater Conspiracy record with us. I've played with The Queens in '07 or '06 for a benefit concert for a friend of ours who passed away. Josh is a great guy and we've kept in touch. He's a lovely fellow."
