John and Ben kick off 2021 by going back to 1999 and discussing Wellwater Conspiracy's sophomore album, Brotherhood of Electric: Operational Directives. Steeped in 1960s psych and trading off between hooky garage tracks and instrumental interludes, Brotherhood of Electric displays a breadth of songwriting and layered accompaniment which rewards repeat listens. Something of a supergroup, the band consists of the two man lineup of John McBain (ex-Monster Magnet) and Matt Cameron (Soundgarden, Pearl Jam) along with several guest musicians including frequent contributions from Josh Homme of Kyuss and a then nascent Queens of the Stone Age.

The compilation we mentioned in the episode was called Succour - The Terrascope Benefit Album.
