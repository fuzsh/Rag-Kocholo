        "text": "LEWIS E. BOGGS\n\nLewis E. Boggs, age 69, of rural Kahoka, MO, died Monday, August 22, 2016 following a boating incident on the Mississippi River near Alexandria the previous day.\n\nLewie was born March 10, 1947 at Fort Madison, IA, the son of Clifford Eugene and Charlotte H. Kramer Boggs.\n\nHe was married to Susie Parsons and they were the parents of two children, Melody \"George\" and Bernard Boggs. On August 21, 2002 he was united in marriage to Wendy Kemper.\n\nSurvivors include his wife, Wendy, of the home; mother-in-law, Joyce Kemper of Kahoka; one daughter, Melody Ann (Sheldon) Robinson of Fort Madison: one son, Bernard Boggs of Revere; six grandchildren: Austen Brand, Jalen and Blake Kutcher, De'Shon and Janessa Robinson and Sherry Boggs; a great-grandaughter, Adalynn Brand; one sister, Rebecca Wright of Fort Madison; brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law: Dana Kemper of Kahoka, Robb and Lisa Kemper of St. Patrick, and Kelly Kemper and Gary Rawls, Sr. of Norfolk, VA; as well as nieces, nephews, and other relatives.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents; step-father, John Sanders; father-in-law, Donald Kemper; and two brothers.\n\nLewis graduated from Fort Madison High School in 1967. He entered the U. S. Army shortly thereafter and served the next two years.\n\nHe moved to Missouri in 1970 where he owned his own business doing primarily concrete work, and putting in sewer systems and water lines. He was a member of Local 18 Concrete Finishers at Macomb. There wasn't anything that he couldn't do and that he couldn't figure out. He did a lot of work for others without pay because he knew they needed a helping hand and he was always willing to give it.\n\nLewie was a lifetime member of the NRA and of Ayer-Boatman Post # 4342, V.F.W. and a member of the Herman Blum Post # 192 of the American Legion. He considered it an honor to be part of the Military Rites given to deceased veterans. Additional memberships included the Clark Co. Moose, the Missouri Longriders, Clark Co. Mule Festival Committee, and the Southside Boat Club in Keokuk. Lewie was City Marshal of Revere for over 20 years as well as former Fire Chief.\n\nLewie loved his family and friends. He loved riding horses, 4-wheelers and side by sides, and boating on the river. Weekends were spent camping along the Mississippi at Alexandria and he enjoyed cooking for all who came, also fishing, banking lines, and the fellowship there. He loved fishing, second only to hunting for deer. He loved camping at the Clark Co. Mule Festival, the Clark Co. Fair, the Ft. Madison Rodeo, and any time he could get together with his family and friends. Lewie believed in doing for others without expecting anything in return. He was generous with his time and talents.\n\nFuneral services were held Friday, August 26, 2016 at 10 a.m. at Wilson Funeral Home in Kahoka with Pastor Ray Gilbert officiating. Recorded musical selections included: \"Four Walls\", \"Huntin', Fishin' and Lovin' Everyday\", \"Pretty Good At Drinkin' Beer\", and \"You're My Hero\". Pallbearers were: Francis Shipley, Gary Whitaker, Jason Overhulser, Richard Overhulser, Carl Whitaker and Tim Ball. Honorary bearers were: Bill Hayden, Jed Soper, Pete Yates, Rowdy Yates, Roy Boltz, Jerry Kinkeade and Richard Parsons. Burial followed in the National Cemetery in Keokuk, IA with full military honors.\n\nFriends called at Wilson Funeral Home in Kahoka after noon Thursday, August 25, 2016 with family receiving friends from 5-8 p.m.\n\nMemorials may be made to Wendy Boggs.\n\nTo send a flower arrangement to the family of Lewis E.
