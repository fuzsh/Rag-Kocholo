        "text": "We open on Kristen next to an urn. Timothy is there, in a crib. Kristen seems very happy to have him.\n\nLeland is in jail and seems to be thinking “do they give out Nobel prizes for attempted chemistry? Do they?” silently. He is not having a good time of it. Dr. Boggs has Sheryl’s letter for Andy to deliver but some weird Shining shit is happening, and Andy has managed to cheat on Kristen while in the mental hospital. Father Ignatius is retiring, and the Archdiocese wants David to take over, and David seems less than delighted. He believes this is only happening because the parish isn’t doing well.\n\nSheryl’s memorial. Holy shit, it’s Anna Chlumsky! Kristen is laughing it up with her and is generally disturbingly positive. Ellie, Chlumsky’s character, is talking to the girls and I think we’re meant to be suspicious of her. Kristen is having a hard time believing that a deathbed confession/conversion is enough, and I agree with her.\n\nLeland’s counsel is John Carroll Lynch and the judge is Richard Kind! So many fun guest stars. Leland is charged with lots of things, including two new counts of murder.\n\nEllie is being very intrusive and also implying she might be a time traveler. But I’ve been watching Dark so that might just be on my mind? Nope, she’s a time traveler. She tells Kristen that six months from now, David will move in with Kristen, and she’ll divorce Andy. Also, she’s Laura, Kristen’s daughter. She stepped through a wormhole in the particle accelerator and came back to talk to Kristen. Lynn will become a nun, Lila is queer (knew it) and will be rich. The most believable part of this is that Kristen would only be sad for 20 days about Andy cheating. But Kristen doesn’t buy any of it and kicks Ellie out.\n\nCREDITS! We get a fun little title card. Only 14 minutes to credits which might be one of the shortest times ever. “Skip the intro and the show will be cancelled. Oops”. Aww.\n\nKristen is having a nightmare or vision and seeing a demon Sheryl who likes to snort ashes. The vision inspires Kristen to call Andy, who is truly terrible at this lying and cheating game and immediately admits to having “met someone”. Kristen drives right to him to yell at him. And also tell him about Timothy. And tell him she’s no longer paying for him to be in this facility and he’s on his own.\n\nLeland and his amazing lawyer! Lynch with this hair is legitimately one of the most amazing things I’ve ever seen in my life. Leland wants Boggs.\n\nKristen is not handling things well. She tells Ben about Ellie and of course Laura is listening from the staircase. What a way to find out your dad cheated. Kristen talks to the girls, says she’ll always be honest with them, then tells them a bunch of bullshit.\n\nDavid shows to comfort Kristen. They have an extremely sensual hug.\n\nSome guy shows up to confirm David’s fear that the parish isn’t doing well and say they’ll need to close down the assessor program and fire Ben and Kristen. They’d prefer a call center to answer questions about possessions, which is a hilarious idea. David tells Ben immediately but hasn’t told Kristen yet because she’s going through enough. Ben has a Go Away From Jesus talk with David about how he’s obviously in love with Kristen. David’s implication that he sticks with God because the world is too depressing otherwise is interesting to me.\n\nEllie is at Kristen’s house and talks to Laura. Laura is smart as hell and takes a picture of her license plate for further investigation. Ellie says she wants to warn Lexis of something that will happen in 20 years.\n\nLeland is talking to Dr. Boggs and wants an insanity defense. He also wants to change representation. Which is too bad because apparently Henry Stick is also a demon, specifically “the evil coming to New York”. Why can’t Lynch ever play a good guy? Anyway, change of representation cancelled.\n\nKristen and the girls open the gift from Ellie. It’s baby clothes. Kristen gives them to Ben for testing and they’ve covered in a nerve agent.\n\nLynn is seeing spirits again on her app. This one takes her to the backyard, but instead of a spirit being behind her it’s Ellie. She tells her when Lexis is 35 and Timothy is 23, they will bring about a battle that will destroy the world. I like the “you may not realize it now” phrasing. Yeah, of course. Why would she? Ellie says Lexis has some evil inside her and will act as Timothy’s right hand woman. Kristen is in bed hearing Lynn calling for her but is in sleep paralysis. Ellie makes it up to Kristen’s bedroom and is going after Timothy, but Laura stops her with an airhorn and Kristen tases her. No one checks to make sure she’s out so of course she escapes. Why did you not already keep the doors and windows locked, Kristen?!\n\nThe license plate belongs to one of the female patients at Andy’s hospital. Twist! Andy and Ellie left the institute that same morning. A nurse gives Kristen a USB which includes Sheryl’s warning video. David tells Kristen about the assessor program being shut down. Kristen sings to Timothy. THE END!"
