        "text": "This petition calls for immediate resignations from Cleveland School District School Board President George Evans, and Board Members Todd Fuller, Richard Boggs, and Chesteen Seals! This petition expresses NO CONFIDENCE in their leadership or their WILL (heart) to provide equitable, integrated learning opportunities for all students in the Cleveland School District. The Board's lack of action in this matter is clearly motivated by race!\n\nThe Cleveland School District has operated a dual education system for more than 60 years! Although the district has been ordered to desegregate by several federal judges since 1969, little has changed! The current School Board lacks the will, integrity, or intent to make decisions in the best interest of all children in the district! Consequently, students are being denied access to an integrated, bias-free public education as guaranteed by the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments.\n\nThis petition is important because public schools should be safe havens for equity and quality. All students deserve to learn, grow, and thrive in integrated environments where their diversity is respected and their unique academic needs are met. All students deserve 21st century learning opportunities. This is not the case in the Cleveland School District. Substandard facilities, resources, supports, and services perpetuate our students' failure, while millions of dollars are invested fighting desegregation and federal court orders.\n\nCleveland is located in Bolivar County Mississippi in the heart of the Mississippi Delta region of our state. Bolivar County is home to approximately 33,000 residents, 64% black, 34% white, and 2% other. Bolivar County is plagued by limited economic development, high unemployment, and numerous residents living at or below the poverty level. Cleveland is the largest city in the Bolivar County with approximately 12,000 residents, of which 50% are black, 48% are white, and 2% other. Cleveland is home to Delta State University, the Bologna Performing Arts Center, and the new Grammy Museum.\n\nThe Cleveland School District serves about 3,700 students in grades Pre-K through 12. There are 10 schools in the district, 6 elementary schools, 2 middle schools, and 2 high schools. Two of the elementary schools are magnets, supposedly created and designed to address school segregation in the district. The other 4 elementary schools are primarily neighborhood schools serving students in attendance zones defined by the city’s former railroad tracks, where most black residents live on the east side of the tracks, and most white residents live on the west side of the tracks. The attendance zones for the 2 middle schools and 2 high schools are also defined by the railroad tracks, where one middle school and one high school are traditionally known as “white schools” located on the west side of the tracks and one middle school and one high school are traditionally known as “black schools” located on the east side of the tracks.\n\nJust recently, the school district was ordered yet again to desegregate its schools by a federal court order issued on May 13, 2016. Since then, the School Board has appealed this ruling and has filed numerous other legal maneuvers to circumvent and/or revisit the May 13th order and opinion. The district has now submitted a Modified Desegregation Plan that clearly demonstrates their intent to discriminate against black students and their families by distributing the sole burdens of desegregation on black stakeholders. The district's Modified plan calls for the CLOSURE OF THE BLACK SCHOOLS while keeping the WHITE SCHOOLS OPEN! In other words, this Modified Plan calls for racially motivated school closures, perpetuates the stigma attached to the Black schools and community by the unconstitutional de jure system, and fails to satisfy the principal of equal protection under the law.\n\nIn her May 13, 2016 opinion and order, Judge Debra M. Brown found that for decades, the district failed to meet its obligation of eradicating all vestiges of the dual system, thereby operating in bastions of segregation long after other school systems similarly situated nationwide had been declared unitary. “More important and of far greater harm,” opined Judge Brown, “the delay in desegregation has deprived generations of students of the constitutionally-guaranteed right of an integration education.”\n\nState-sponsored segregation continues to thrive in the Cleveland, Mississippi, during these 21st century times, and will continue as long as Board Members George Evans, Todd Fuller, Richard Boggs, and Chresteen Seals are allowed to serve. The path to justice can only be cleared through the removal of these bigoted, elected school officials. Their removal must happen for the good of all children today and for the generations to come. We will stand, affirmed by the words of the late, great Dr. Martin Luther King, “Justice delayed, is justice denied”, and “Injustice anywhere, is a threat to justice everywhere”.\n\nWe were led to start this petition when it became blazingly apparent that the Board is resigned to promote racial segregation and practice racial discrimination regardless the cost. Despite the passionate pleas for relief from black community stakeholders, voluminous data showing the academic needs of all students and achievement gaps, and reports of the millions of dollars wasted on legal fees, the Board refuses to listen to the will of the people. The Board has demeaned and humiliated black stakeholders seeking to be engaged in Board Meetings by remanding 100-plus black citizens outside the building in 100+ degree weather while they engage in an executive session in the comforts of air conditioning in the building. The Board has blatantly defied their own policies to promote their racist acts. The Board and its administration have harassed, threatened and intimidated stakeholders to silence their voices. The Board has expressed their lack of will in desegregating the schools.\n\nThe success of this petition will provide equal educational opportunities and equal protections for all students in the Cleveland School District by removing the officials who continue to block this progress. In addition, the success of this petition will send a convincing message to the Cleveland School Board and school officials that discrimination in any form in public education is wrong and will not be tolerated. Finally, this petition will pave the way to implementing Judge Debra Brown’s May 13, 2016 Order and Opinion with fidelity! Numerous judges have concluded that the Board lacks the will to desegregate! The involvement of anyone lacking the will in this effort will only allow them the forum to undermine the fidelity of this desegregation effort.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Education (2016), “Every child in America deserves an education that opens opportunities—especially the opportunity to join a thriving middle class.” These opportunities have yet to be provided for all students in the Cleveland School District, decades after the 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education ruling. As Judge Debra M. Brown so eloquently expressed in her recent court order and opinion, “although no court order can right the wrongs” of delaying desegregation and depriving generations of students of the constitutionally-guaranteed right of an integrated education, “it is the duty of the [Cleveland School] District to ensure that not one more student suffers under this burden.”\n\nIt is our hope that Board President George Evans, Board Member Todd Fuller, Board Member Richard Boggs, and Board Member Chesteen Seals will RESIGN IMMEDIATELY FROM THE CLEVELAND SCHOOL DISTRICT SCHOOL BOARD. Only then can we pave to the way to consolidation and reconciliation in the Cleveland School District in Cleveland, MS!"
