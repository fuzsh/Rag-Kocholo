        "text": "Vladimir Putin’s nuclear threat shows how much is going wrong for him in Ukraine: No plan of battle survives contact with the enemy, but his has fared worse than many; One measure of Mr. Putin’s lack of confidence and shock at Western opposition: the announcement on February 27th that Russia’s nuclear forces have been put on a heightened level of alertness. xxxxxxxxxx As Adam Roberts of The Economist argues, \"Making predictions in the heat of war is usually a fool’s errand—something that may be dawning on Vladimir Putin. The first few days of fighting have not gone as the Russian autocrat would have forecast. Especially in their cities, Ukrainians have mounted a brave defence. The leadership of Volodymyr Zelensky, somewhat unexpectedly, has proved inspiring. Mr Putin has blundered, both in launching a murderous—and unprovoked—attack on a democratic neighbour, but also in his misconduct of the war so far. Russian control of Ukrainian airspace is still not achieved. Nonetheless, given Russia’s overwhelming forces and Mr Putin’s ruthless nature, expect the invaders to make gains in the coming days. The attacks on Kyiv will grow fiercer. One consequence of that? Growing anger in the West—among ordinary people as well as national leaders. More military gear, including, remarkably, anti-tank rockets and Stinger missiles from Germany, is heading to Ukraine. Sanctions on Russia are becoming more severe. Beyond the exclusion of some Russian banks from the SWIFT system, more serious are the efforts by Europe and America to stop Russia’s central bank accessing much of its $600bn-plus in foreign reserves. Watch on Monday how markets react to that. It’s unlikely to be pretty for Russia, especially the rouble. Some sort of Russian retaliation towards the West should be expected. The price of oil and gas could yet surge.\" Comment: Like many who were part of Ukraine's large Canadian diaspora, my maternal grandparents emigrated to Canada in the late 1910s and were immersed in Montreal's Ukrainian community most of their lives, including a retirement centre. My grandfather experienced the oppression of the Russians thru the first 20+ years of his life. My 85-year old disabled mom and my Aunt are heartbroken by the invasion of their beloved homeland. Some argue that \"it is wrong to put all the blame for this war on Putin\" and instead suggest that NATO’s eastward expansion as somehow the cause of Russia’s “bunker mentality”. However, invading a sovereign country because you don’t like its elected government is entirely unjustified. Professor Jan Maciejowski, from Cambridge, \"suggests Mr. Putin is only guided by fellow military and security officials and fails to realise how big a mistake he has made.\" #putin #ukraine #ukrainecrisis #nuclear #military #canada #leadership #swift"
