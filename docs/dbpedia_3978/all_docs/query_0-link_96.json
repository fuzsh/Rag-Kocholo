        "text": "Here we are on April 15 and you don’t have the dough to pay your taxes. You would not be alone. Don’t panic, but don’t sit there and pretend it’s OK, either. The Internal Revenue Service takes a dim view of that.\n\nReuters reported:\n\n“‘Our calls are up 280 percent,’ said Richard Boggs, founder and chief executive of Los Angeles-based Nationwide Tax Relief, a firm that helps delinquent taxpayers resolve tax issues.\n\n“‘We’ve seen a huge rise in what we call the rookie delinquent taxpayer,’ he said. ‘They are incredibly scared, and they have no idea what’s going to happen to them because, God bless them, they’ve never owed before.'”\n\nThe story went on to say that the IRS is trying to be especially understanding this year:\n\n“‘We recognize the economic realities that are out there,’ IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman told reporters. “We’re available to work with people.’\n\n“Critics are skeptical this will happen. The agency collects much of the $3 trillion that funds the government.\n\n“IRS agents were given more flexibility in their collection actions, including the ability to reduce or suspend monthly payments on back taxes so those hit hard by the financial downturn are not forced to default on their tax payments.”\n\nThe IRS won’t be as gentle, though, if a person doesn’t file any paperwork:\n\n“…there is a failure-to-file penalty for taxpayers who don’t file their tax returns by April 15 and who owe taxes. Filing by the deadline allows taxpayers to avoid this penalty, even if they can’t pay all or some of their taxes by the deadline. Taxpayers who can’t meet the filing deadline can request an extension of time to file. However, an extension of time to file is not an extension of time to pay.\n\n“Taxpayers who can’t pay the full amount would still benefit from filing their return and paying as much as they can by April 15. Interest and failure-to-pay penalties are due on any unpaid balance and increase the amount that the taxpayer owes.”\n\nSome states, such as California, Connecticut, Delaware and Wisconsin post the names of the biggest tax deadbeats. InvestmentNews.com said:\n\n“It has paid off big-time. Patrick Carter, Delaware’s director of revenue, said that the state has collected almost $4 million in back taxes from hundreds of businesses and individuals who were placed on the list. Shame works, he explained in a published report, recounting how one accounting firm that was on the Delaware list ponied up after losing several clients. He also said that many state residents somehow managed to settle their tax bills because they were publicly embarrassed.\n\n“This shaming technique works because it relies on a time-tested method: a vocal condemnation of cheating followed by a display of the cheater’s bad acts for all to see.”"
