        "text": "The Outsiders\n\nBy Richard Feldman\n\nAs I continue to think about the emerging movement and actions of young people engaged with Black Lives Matter and the rebellions that emerged in Ferguson, Baltimore as well as the most recent racist murders in Charleston I have asked myself the question: What is missing in the conversation?\n\nAs I listen to the debate over the Confederate flag and the focus on the south, I wonder about the north and the US Flag.\n\nWhen I am reminded of the fact that Detroit is one of the only major majority black cities our country and we face 67,000 foreclosures and 40,000 water shutoffs which is essentially an ethnic cleansing to re-establish cities as playgrounds for wealthy and white, I asked myself what are we missing.\n\nWe are not only missing an economic analysis that links racism and capitalism but we are missing the historical understanding of the rise of the outsiders, the permanent technologically displaced and the increased numbers of the underclass in our society. James Boggs in his 1963 classic: The American Revolution: Pages from a Negro Workers notebook has a chapter dedicated to “the outsiders.” His bold and courageous thinking inspired this book.\n\nAs i reread this chapter it reminded me of the historical moment of qualitative change taking place in 1963 in our country and the need for new theories of revolution, community building and transformation.\n\nToday we live in another historically significant moment in human history and a movement moment. The chapter “The outsiders” exemplifies dialectical thinking and the prophetic incite to acknowledge the relationship of racism and capitalism to technological change and social movements.\n\nHe says; “We need a new declaration of human rights in an age of abundance”…..\n\nToday, we say “We not only need a new value system, we need a new concept of work which is different from JOBS and a new culture which takes us far beyond the industrial age.\n\nReading this chapter will evoke questions, reflections and re-conceptualization for today and tomorrow. We need to think with the kind of courage and boldness when James Boggs wrote this chapter and this little book.\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nTHE AMERICAN REVOLUTI0N\n\nPAGES FROM NEGRO WORKERS NOTEBOOK\n\nCHAPTER 4 The Outsiders\n\nMany people in the United States are aware that, with\n\nautomation, enough could be easily produced in this country so\n\nthat there would be no need for the majority of Americans to\n\nwork. But the right to live has always been so tied up with\n\nthe necessity to Produce that it is hard for the average person\n\nto visualize a workless society. The result is that when people\n\nface the perspective of their jobs being eliminated by automa-\n\ntion, all they can think of is learning a new trade or a new\n\nprofession, hoping that in this way they can maintain their\n\nright to live.\n\nAs long as this country was in the situation that most\n\nunderdeveloped countries are in today, it was natural to tie\n\ntogether the right to live with the ability to produce. But when\n\na country reaches the stage that this country has now reached,\n\nproductivity can no longer be the measure of an individual’s\n\nright to life. When you travel around this country and see new\n\nautomated plants springing up in one area after another, it\n\nbecomes apparent that the era when man had to earn his right\n\nto live through work is rapidly drawing to a close. Within a\n\nfew years, man as a productive force will be as obsolete as the\n\nmule.\n\nIt is in this serious light that we have to look at the ques-\n\ntion of the growing army of unemployed. We have to stop\n\nlooking for solutions in pump-priming, feather-bedding, public\n\nworks, war contracts, and all the other gimmicks that are al-\n\nwars being proposed by labor leaders and well-meaning liberals.\n\nNor is there any solution through production to aid the under-\n\ndeveloped countries. Perhaps this would be a possibility if we\n\nlived in a world society where the whole world was working in\n\na unified way to advance the welfare of all. But the fact is that\n\nwe are living in a nation-state society in which millions of\n\nThe Outsiders 47\n\ndollars worth of goods rot away unless they can be used abroad\n\nto further the foreign policy of this particular nation-state\n\nSo there is no way to avoid facing the fundamental\n\nproblems. What we need today is a new Declaration of Human\n\nRights to fit the new Age of Abundance.\n\nThis nation cannot long endure short on rights and long on\n\ngoods. We must accept the plain fact that we are moving\n\ntowards an automated society and act on the basis of this fact.\n\nThe first principle that has to be established is that every-\n\none has a. right to a frill life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi-\n\nness, whether he is working or not, The question of the right to\n\na full life has to be divorced completely from the question of\n\nwork.\n\nSociety must recognize that the magnificent productive\n\ntools of our day are the result of the accumulated labors of all.\n\nof us and not the exclusive property of any group or class.\n\nNow that our productive machinery has been developed to the\n\npoint that it can do the tasks which have heretofore been done\n\nby men, everyone, regardless of class, regardless of background,\n\nis entitled to the enjoyment of the fruits of that development,\n\njust as all men are entitled to warm themselves in the heat of\n\nthe sun.\n\nOnce it is recognized that all men have the right to a full\n\nlife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, whether they are\n\nworking or not working, have worked or have not worked, it\n\nwill be necessary for society to create a completely new set of\n\nvalues. Up to now, because productivity has been low, a man’s\n\nvalue has been determined by his labor from day to day, by\n\nhow much he could produce both to sustain himself and to\n\npermit investment in new machinery. Now that man is being\n\neliminated from the productive process, a new standard of\n\nvalue must be found. This can only be man’s value as a.\n\nhuman being.\n\nUp to now it has always been possible if not always easy\n\nto cast aside the productive forces that have become obsolete.\n\nWork animals were put to pasture; tools, machinery, factories,\n\nand even whole industries have been simply scrapped or put\n\nto the torch. It has been said that capitalism wages wars so\n\nthat it can get rid of surplus manpower that has become ob-\n\n98 THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION\n\nsolete. Whether or not this has been true in the past, no capitalist\n\nin these days of nuclear warfare would be foolish enough to\n\ntake this way out. The key question therefore is what should be\n\ndone with man who is being made obsolete in the new stage\n\nof production Obviously no ordinary solution is possible. This\n\nis the social dilemma of our time.\n\nNo one understands better than a worker the humiliation\n\nand sense of personal degradation that is involved when some\n\nbig shot is coming through the shop and the superintendent tells\n\nhim to look busy in order to prove that there is useful work\n\ngoing on. That is what our whole society is like today. By all\n\nkinds of gimmicks–including war work, which may end up by\n\nkilling off those for whom jobs are being created, and a host\n\nof government agencies set up to study the problems of “full\n\nemployment”–the American government is now trying to\n\nmake work when we are already on the threshold of a workless\n\nsociety.\n\nIn the fall of 1961 as Chrysler workers were streaming\n\nout of the plant, they were telling one another: “This could\n\nbe a long strike because the company don’t need us at all. They\n\ngot plenty of cars in storage.” That these workers practically\n\nto a man felt this way is a sign of the work situation in the\n\nUnited States, not only in the auto plants but in the TV plants,\n\nappliance plants, the furniture industry, the clothing industry,\n\nand in every domestic industry. It is a known fact that one\n\nsingle auto company like GM or Ford, or a single refrigerator\n\ncompany like General Electric or Westinghouse, or any major\n\nsteel firm like U. S. Steel or Bethlehem, could produce enough\n\nso that all their competitors could close down. All they would\n\nhave to do is bring in a little more automation and cybernation\n\n(automation plus computers). What they are doing today is\n\ncompeting” with one another and splitting up the profit. Only in\n\nwar work, and particularly in missiles, can workers feel\n\nsure that if they go on strike they will be missed. This is the\n\ndilemma of the United States: What is to be done with the\n\nand women who are being made obsolete by the new stage\n\nof production?\n\nThe American economy is kept going today by the pump-\n\npriming of war contracts. This kind of work produces no goods\n\nThe Outsiders 49\n\nthat will reach the consumer market, because what is produced\n\nis blown up or stored–some of it at the bottom of the sea.\n\nHowever, by this means money is put into the hands of the\n\nlarge corporations to pay out to their employees, who in turn\n\nbuy consumer goods.\n\nIt is when you begin to think of a peacetime economy that\n\neverybody, from the average worker to the labor leader, from\n\nthe government official to the big capitalist begins to have night-\n\nmares. Each may have a different view of what should hap-\n\npen to the unemployed, but they all have one thing in common:\n\nthey believe that man must work.\n\nThe average worker believes this because that is the only\n\nway he or she has been able to live. The labor leaders believe\n\nit because if workers didn’t have to work, labor leaders wouldn’t\n\nhave anyone to lead. The government official believes it be-\n\ncause the role of the government has become that of regulating\n\nrelations between management and labor, both of whom must\n\nexist in order for government to play its part. Thus, as Ken-\n\nnedy’s speech to the UAW convention and his overtures to\n\nindustry show so clearly, government alternately appeases and\n\nrebukes both wage-earners and capitalists. Finally, the big\n\ncapitalists can only see themselves growing richer and more\n\npowerful if they are in control of the destinies of the workers\n\n50 THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION\n\nelectronic experts. Already there are over 850,000 scientists\n\nin industry, without counting all those outside of industry who\n\nare working toward much the same goals. What they are\n\ncreating is a mode of production which, as long as the present\n\nsystem continues, excludes more and more people from playing\n\nany productive role in society. This means that our society, as\n\nwe have known it, is just as finished as feudal society was\n\nfinished by the time capitalism arrived on the scene. It means\n\nnot only that hundreds of thousands are yearly being displaced\n\nfrom production, but also that millions are outsiders to begin\n\nwith. These millions have never been and never can be can be absorbed\n\ninto this society at all. They can only be absorbed into a totally\n\nnew type of society whose\n\nman is the master and not the servant of things.\n\nToday in the United States there is no doubt that those\n\nat the bottom are growing in numbers much faster than the\n\nsystem will ever be able to absorb. This reflects the population\n\nexplosion which is taking place right here inside the United\n\nStates. Already there are millions of young men and women\n\nwho have never held any jobs at all and who live from hand\n\nto mouth, either by charity or by petty crime: in other words\n\nat the expense of those who are working. They cannot be\n\nintegrated into society unless they work, and there is no prospect\n\nof any work for them. What is more, the social measures which\n\nmade work for such people in the days of the New Deal are\n\ncompletely silly in an age when you can dig ditches, lay\n\nbridges, and build buildings merely by pushing a few buttons.\n\nAll this means that there can be no smag plan for re-\n\nforming this system. Because when you add to those who are\n\ndaily being displaced from the plant the millions who have never\n\neven had a chance to work inside a plant, what you have is\n\nno longer just the unemployed and the castaways, but a revolu-\n\ntionary force or army of outsiders and rejects who are totally\n\nalienated from this society.\n\nWe must have no illusions that there will be any easy\n\nunity between these outsiders and those who are inside the\n\nsystem because they are still working. Already, as we have\n\nnoted above, the labor organizations themselves are separating\n\noff the employed from the unemployed for whom they can do\n\nThe Outsiders 51\n\nnothing. The present work force is itself a product of the old\n\nsociety and struggling to survive within it. This means that we\n\nmust look to the outsiders for the most radical, that is the\n\ndeepest, thinking as to the changes that are needed. What ideas\n\nwill they have? They have not yet expressed them clearly, but\n\ntheir target is very clear. It is not any particular company or\n\nany particular persons but the government itself. Just how they\n\nwill approach or penetrate this target I do not know nor do\n\nI know what will happen when they have done what they must\n\ndo. But I know that the army of outsiders which is growing by\n\nleaps and bounds in this country is more of a threat to the\n\npresent “American way of life” than any foreign power.\n\nAsk the average American what is the biggest threat to\n\nour way of life and the chances are that he will blurt out\n\n“Communism.” He sees the threat as coming from a foreign\n\npower. Yet the fact that, after all these years of capitalism, he\n\nisso of another means that capitalism has definite-\n\nly not proved itself to be the system which man must have to\n\nlive his life as a full and equal human being. )\n\nIf you can once get the average American to stop blaming\n\neverything on the Communists (or the Negroes, or the Jews,\n\nor the Italians) and finally face up to the fact that there is a\n\ncrisis in his own country, and then ask him what the real\n\ncrisis is, the chances are good that he will say “Automation.”\n\nBut when he says this, he still has a distant look in his eyes as\n\nif automation, too, is something that will pass without creating\n\nor demanding too great a change in the present system of\n\nhaving to work for a living.\n\nBut for the outsiders who have never been and can never\n\nbe involved in this system, regardless of how much free enter-\n\nprise or initiative they show, automation means something much\n\ndeeper. It means that they have to find a new concept of how\n\nto live and let live among human beings. A new generation of\n\nthese “workless people” is rapidly growing up in this country.\n\nFor them, the simple formula of “more schools and more educa-\n\ntion and more training” is already outmoded. We already\n\nhave with us a generation of youth who have completed high\n\nschool and had some kind of training and yet have found no\n\nmode of production into which they can fit. Because as fast\n\n52 THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION\n\nas they are trained for a higher technical stage of production,\n\nlust as fast does a new technical revolution take place. Whereas\n\nthe old workers used to hope that they could pit their bodies\n\nagainst iron and outlast the iron, this new generation of work-\n\nless people knows that even their brains are being outwitted\n\nby the iron brains of automation and cybernation. To tell\n\nthese people that they must work to earn their living is like\n\ntelling a man in the big city that he should hunt big game for\n\nthe meat on his table.\n\nThis means that the new generation, outsiders the\n\nworkless people now have to turn their thoughts irwav from try-\n\ning to outwit the machines and instead toward the organization\n\nand reorganization of society and of human relations inside\n\nsociety. The revolution which is within these people will have\n\nto be a revolution of their minds and hearts, directed not\n\ntoward increasing production but toward the management and\n\ndistribution of things and toward the control of relations among\n\npeople, tasks which up to now have been left to chance or in\n\nthe hands of an elite.\n\nThere are some people among the older generation who\n\nrecognize that this is the threat or promise contained in automa-\n\ntion and cybernation, but most of them are afraid to face the\n\nreality and continue to hope that the old house can still be\n\npatched up. The outsiders, in contrast, owe no allegiance to\n\nany system but only to themselves. Being workless, they are also\n\nstateless. They have grown up like a colonial people who no\n\nlonger feel any allegiance to the old imperial power and are\n\neach day searching for new means to overthrow it.\n\nI am not saying that this new generation of outsiders is as\n\nof now an organized force. It is not as simple as that. In fact,\n\nno existing organization would even think of organizing them,\n\nwhich means that they will have to organize themselves and\n\nthat the need to organize themselves will soon be forced upon\n\nthem as they grow in numbers like the beggars on the streets\n\nof India. The big difference between them and Indian beggars\n\nis that in India the means to live without having to work are\n\nnot available, while in the United States these means are all\n\naround them, before their very eyes. The only question, the\n\ntrick, is how to take them.\n\nThe Outsiders 53\n\nThe forces of a cold war are thus taking shape inside\n\nthe United States: the war between those who are setting up\n\nall kinds of social agencies, training bureaus and the like to\n\nhead off the stateless and workless people, and those who are\n\nlearning every day that these stop-gaps offer no solution to their\n\nproblems. Just as the natural wealth and technical advances of\n\nthis country have meant that a lot more People here can share\n\nin the material things of life than anywhere else, so the erup-\n\ntion of this new group Will pose radical concepts beyond the\n\nimagination of us all, but certainly founded on the principle\n\nthat people should be able to enjoy everything in life and from\n\nlife, with out being fettered or limited by any system.\n\nThese radical concepts cannot come from organized labor.\n\nIn the 30’s the class struggle of the American workers, united,\n\norganized, and disciplined by the process of production, reached\n\nits greatest height in the organization of the CIO. Today in the\n\n60’s the American labor movement has reached the end of the\n\nroad in the face of the social and ideological adjustments that\n\nare necessary to meet the revolutionary changes that have\n\ntaken place in technology, organized labor is as reactionary to-\n\nday as organized capital was thirty years ago. The fundamental\n\nreason for this is that organized labor continues to cherish the\n\nidea that man must work in order to live, in an age when it is\n\ntechnologically possible for men simply to walk out on the\n\nstreets and get their milk and honey. To talk about full em-\n\nployment and getting the unemployed back to work at this\n\npoint when we are on the threshold of the workless society, is as\n\nreactionary as it was for the “rugged individualists” to say in\n\nthe 30’s that the only reason why a man wasn’t working was\n\nthat he didn’t have the initiative to go out and get himself a job\n\nEven in their best days, it should be remembered, the CIO\n\nand AFL were not able to do much about unemployment. In\n\n1939 when the Second World War began, there were still more\n\nthan 9 million unemployed, well over twice today’s official\n\nfigure. With the war, millions of old and new workers went into\n\nthe plants and the last layer of the population, which had up to\n\nthen been completely outside of industry–the Negroes–was\n\nfinally brought in. Following the war the pent-up purchasing\n\nPower of the population kept employment high for several\n\n54 THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION\n\nyears. But after the Korean War management started a two-\n\npronged attack, automating the plants and tightening up on\n\nwork rules. At about the same time, unemployment began\n\ncreeping up again.\n\nOrganized labor, instead of facing the challenge inherent\n\nin automation and the potentiality of material abundance, re-\n\nsponded by continuing to seek ways and means to achieve full\n\nemployment–ranging all the way from demands for a shorter\n\nwork week and retraining programs to appeals for bigger tax\n\ncuts and fatter war contracts.\n\nWhy is organized labor Unable to face the issues posed by\n\nthe 60’s? To answer this Question we have to look at the\n\nchanges that have taken place in this country, industrially and\n\nsocially, over the last quarter century.\n\nAs long as the vast majority of a population has not be-\n\ngun to acquire the consumption goods that are possible under\n\nconditions of modern technology, the employers are producing\n\nnot only for profit but also for social use. The people actually\n\nneed the goods that are being produced, the refrigerators, the\n\ncars, the radios, the TVs. These goods provide the material\n\nBut once the point is reached where the vast majority have\n\nacquired these goods, then the manufacturers are no longer producing\n\nfor social use. Apart from a reduced need for service and replace-\n\nment, they are producing for a market which has been created\n\nnot by the needs of the people but by the needs of the manu-\n\nfacturers. They continue producing so that they can continue\n\nto make profits and to stimulate the necessary demand, they\n\nproduce shoddy goods, plan obsolescence, and above all “sell”\n\nthe population, stimulating its appetite for more and more\n\nuseless commodities, propagandizing and corrupting it.\n\nOrganized labor shares the concern of the employers to\n\nkeep production going. It, motive is different but the aim is\n\nthe same The manufacturers want to maintain production for\n\nthe sake of profits; the unions want to maintain it to keep up\n\ntheir memberships. Thus the labor organizations have in effect\n\nbecome partners with management in a system of corrupting\n\nthe population. Each needs the other because each is faced\n\nwith the same insoluble Predicament of capitalism today–that\n\nThe Outsiders 55\n\nthrough the use of machines enough can now be produced for\n\neverybody without any need either for millions of dollars in\n\nprofits or millions of people at work.\n\nIn order to continue with its philosophy of full employ-\n\nment, organized labor has become part and parcel of the\n\n“American way of life.” It has become partners with the\n\nmilitary in establishing and maintaining a war machine the\n\nonly purpose of which is to threaten the destruction of all\n\nhumanity.\n\nThe philosophy of “Solidarity Forever” on which the\n\nlabor movement was built is today in rags and tatters. There\n\nis a never-ending dog-eat-dog fight going on between inter-\n\nnational unions over the available work–who is going to build\n\na new factory, who has jurisdiction in a new construction pro-\n\nject, who is going to do the electrical work or transport the\n\nequipment. There is a never-ending dog-eat-dog fight going on\n\nbetween locals of the same union over which plant is actually\n\ngoing to get a particular operation or which local will have\n\njurisdiction in a new construction project, who is going to do\n\nthe electrical work or transport the equipment. There is a\n\nnever-ending dog-eat-dog fight going on between those workers\n\nwho want to work only 40 hours a week and the money-hungry\n\nones who spend all their time catering to the boss and stool-\n\npigeoning on their fellow-workers in order to get the fat $150-\n\n$200-a-week checks that come from working 50, 60, and 70\n\nhours. Meanwhile those inside the plant become ever more\n\nremoved from those outside.\n\nThe philosophy of “Workers of the World Unite” is also\n\nin rags and tatters. The AFL-CIO has official connections with\n\norganized labor in other countries and periodically sends a\n\ntoken sum to support a strike. But American organized labor’s\n\nattitude to the workers of the world is essentially the same as\n\nits attitude to the outsiders at home. They should be thrown a\n\nbone now and then, but if they were to make any real progress\n\nit would be a threat to the insiders. Thus, organized labor is\n\nas opposed to imports from foreign countries and as anxious\n\nabout America’s future in relation to the European Common\n\nMarket as the most reactionary employer. It is as opposed as\n\nthe American government to the independent development of\n\n56 THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION\n\nthe economy of the underdeveloped countries and as ready to\n\nact as a counter-revolutionary force against all revolutions in\n\nthe underdeveloped countries.\n\nWhat about the union militants? Every few months\n\naround any auto shop, groups of workers are getting together\n\nto discuss how to “bring the union back to the shop.” The\n\nunion is already there, officially. It is recognized by the com-\n\npany; a contract exists between the company and the inter-\n\nnational governing that particular plant. Yet these workers are\n\nconstantly getting together with the expressed purpose of “bring-\n\ning: the union back.” For them “bringing the union back” means\n\nbringing back the atmosphere that existed in the late 30’s and\n\nthe early 40’s-when they would shut down the plant over a\n\nproduction dispute and settle the issue then and there; when\n\nthey could talk back to the supervisor without being penalized;\n\nwhen they could go to the toilet whenever they needed to;\n\nwhen they could get a day off to attend someone’s funeral with-\n\nout begging the foreman, as they have to do nowadays.\n\nThese are very natural and human rights, rights which\n\nthe workers themselves know they have lost. Yet these groups at-\n\ntract very little support. In fact, the more militant they are the\n\nless support they get. Instead, the groups who more or less\n\nfollow the union machine usually win majority support, easily\n\ncoming out on top in union elections without even making any\n\npromises to the workers except to support the policies of the\n\ninternational\n\nThe militants who are always meeting and discussing and\n\ndevising ways and means of “bringing back the union” are\n\ngenerally the most advanced workers in the sense that they are\n\nready to struggle for better working conditions. Yet when you\n\ntell these militants that they are never going to bring the union\n\nback to where it was, because the union that they are thinking\n\nabout and hoping for has already outlived its usefulness and\n\nthat the workers are never again going to struggle for and\n\nthrough this kind of organization, they can’t understand why.\n\nThey have become so accustomed to what used to happen in\n\nthe early days of the union, when large numbers of workers\n\nwere very militant, that they still believe that there are plenty\n\nof militant workers left in the shop and that all they have to do\n\nThe Outsiders 57\n\nis to get together and organize them. They face the\n\nchanges that have taken place in production since the 30″s. They\n\ncannot get it into their heads that these old workers who used\n\nto be so militant are now a vanishing herd who know that they\n\nare a vanishing herd, who know that, because of automation,\n\nthe days of workers like themselves in manufacturing are\n\nnumbered, and who have therefore decided that ah they can do\n\nnow is fight to protect their pensions and seniority and hope\n\nthat the company will need them to work until they are old\n\nenough to retire or die, whichever comes first.\n\nYou would think that in this restless group of militants\n\nwho have fought so hard for progress, there would be some\n\nwho could see the handwriting on the wall and realize that\n\nwork as they have known it, and the mobilization of people in\n\nstruggle over working conditions, have become obsolete. But it\n\nis in this group of militants that you find the greatest re-\n\nluctance to accept the inevitability of the workless society. In\n\nthis refusal to face reality, these militants who are so advanced\n\nare really behind the average worker who has reconciled him-\n\nself to eventual oblivion. Why?\n\nIt is precisely because these workers are more advanced,\n\nin the sense of wanting to struggle for progress, that they cling\n\nto the idea of organizing the struggle through work. The fact\n\nis that it is through the struggle over work that social reforms\n\nhave been won over the last four years, and especially in this\n\ncountry from the middle 30’s to the middle 40’s. The struggle\n\naround working conditions has been the most progressive factor\n\nin American society, educating and organizing people to fight\n\nfor human rights as nothing else in this society has been able\n\nto do. These militants know this because they have lived through\n\nit. Most of them, without ever having read a word of Marx,\n\nhave experienced in life what Marx analyzed in theory. They\n\ncannot give up an idea or a method on which they have de-\n\npended for progress until they can see another one, and they\n\nhave not yet seen or figured out another way to fight for human\n\nneeds and human rights.\n\n58 THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION\n\nbecause they are not in the shop and therefore do not have the\n\nopportunity to organize themselves into little groups so easily.\n\nBut these liberals and radicals are also hoping and waiting on\n\nthe workers to struggle. Even those who attack Marx most\n\nviciously still think like Marx, because what Marx thought was\n\nso true until only a few short years ago when the new age\n\nof nuclear energy, automation, and cybernation began.\n\nActually these union militants will go down fighting for\n\nthings like a shorter work week (30-for-40), or two months\n\npaid vacation, or six months paid furlough, or the four-hour\n\nday–all of which demands are within the framework of keep\n\ning the work force intact. Even when there is no longer any\n\nreason, because of the development of automation and cyberna-\n\ntion, to keep the work force intact, they will still fight to keep\n\nit intact. Therefore it is hopeless to look to them as the ones\n\nto lead the fight for a workless society. The workless society is\n\nsomething that can only be brought about by actions and\n\nforces outside the work process.\n\nGovernment officials, labor officials, and the university\n\nprofessors whom they both hire to help them beat their brains\n\nare working overtime, trying to find some scheme to create\n\nfull employment. But whatever schemes they come up with,\n\nwhether the 35-hour week, new training programs, bigger and\n\nbadder war contracts, or bigger and better public works pro-\n\njects, they are playing a losing game. America is headed toward\n\nfull unemployment, not full employment\n\nIn 1962 I visited the West Coast where a large percentage\n\nof the country’s war work is concentrated and the newspapers\n\nrejoice every time a new war contract is awarded to the area.\n\nYet, talking to guys who work in the plant like myself, I found\n\nthat their main worry is what to do about automation and the\n\npeople it is throwing out of work A friend of mine told me\n\nabout a Mexican-American who works in the plant with him\n\nand who describes automation as a beast of the world which\n\nis moving in on people and nobody knows what to do about\n\nit.” This worker has come to the conclusion that the only\n\nsensible solution is for the company to put in new machines as\n\nfast as it can, while every guy who is displaced by these new\n\nmachines continues to receive his weekly paycheck. His idea\n\nThe Outsiders 59\n\nis that the sooner the machines become fully employed and\n\nthe people become fully employed, the better.\n\nMy friend has put some thought into how this would\n\nwork and has decided that if the old philosophy that man has\n\nto go to work must be retained, then the displaced workers\n\ncould continue to go to the plant and just sit around and\n\nwatch the machines. He was quite sure that if this happened\n\nthe workers would be continually putting forward new sug-\n\ngestions as to how to redesign the machines to make them\n\nmore efficient and displace more men, instead of doing what\n\nthey are now doing, constantly trying to think up new ways\n\nto fight the machine so as to keep their jobs. We both agreed\n\nthat there is nothing more agonizing than holding back the\n\nideas that every worker is constantly getting as to how to increase\n\nproductivity.\n\nI told him that I could fore see a time when machines\n\nwould be so perfected that there would be no need for the\n\ngreat maioritv of people to go into the plant except occasionally,\n\nand that I was quite sure that, once released from the neces-\n\nsitv to work, men and women would come up with new ideas\n\nfor increasing productivity that would astonish the world. Fish-\n\nermen just fishing for fun would come up with new ideas for\n\nfishing, guys puttering around their lawns would think up new\n\nways to grow grass, people with nothing to do but sit around\n\nand observe would be constantly producing-new ideas and\n\nbursting to share them with others. It is only the necessity to\n\nwork, forced labor. that has created in man the need to fight\n\nnew modes of production and to keep new ideas about in-\n\ncreasing production to himself.\n\nOne immediate step out of the dilemma would be to\n\nemploy the seniority system in reverse. As new machines are\n\nbrought in, those who have been working longest, instead of\n\nbeing kept on the job, should be eased out of work. Every\n\ncompany, even if it has to get subsidies from the government\n\nto do so, should put in the most modern equipment available,\n\nand as this is done those workers with the highest seniority\n\nshould be laid off with continued full pay equal to that of\n\nthose still working.\n\nThis would be very far from being a solution, however,\n\n60 THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION\n\nsince it does not take into consideration the million and a half\n\nyoung people who are entering the adult world every year plus\n\nthe millions like them who, being unemployed, have no claim\n\non any company. It is in connection with this group of out-\n\nsiders that those who hope for full employment are really\n\ncaught in a dilemma. These millions can never become part of\n\nany work force in the sense that we know it. There is no Siberia\n\nto which they can be sent, and even if there were they wouldn’t\n\ngo. They have seen too much of what is possible in this society;\n\nthey also know that there are enough of them around to be a\n\nthreat. Already the big question in cities like Detroit is whether\n\na way can be found for these outsiders to live before they kill\n\noff those of us who are still working. How long can we leave\n\nthem hanging out in the streets ready to knock the brains out\n\nof those still working in order to get a little spending money?\n\nObviously it would be far better to give these outsiders a\n\nweekly check also, rather than leave them with no alternative\n\nbut to look for guns and knives to use against the insiders. But\n\ngiving them a check is not enough. There has to be some way\n\nin which to develop their creative abilities and sense of re-\n\nsponsibility, because without this they can become completely\n\nempty creatures. What makes it so easy to propose a weekly\n\npay check for those who have worked all their lives is that\n\nthey have already acquired some discipline and sense of re-\n\nsponsibility from their work. But those who have never worked\n\nand will never get a chance to in this society will have to find\n\nsome other way to develop their creative abilities before these\n\nare destroyed by forced idleness.\n\nThis is one of the great challenges facing our society to-\n\nday. Another is the question of peace and war to which we\n\nnow turn.\n\n________________________\n\nthrough this kind of organization, they can’t understand why.\n\nThey have become so accustomed to what used to happen in\n\nthe early days of the union, when large numbers of workers\n\nsince it does not take into consideration the million and a half\n\nyoung people who are entering the adult world every year plus\n\nthe millions like them who, being unemployed, have no claim"
