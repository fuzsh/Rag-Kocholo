        "text": "Just Sweats Chronology\n\n(“Mistaken for Dead,” Forensic Files)\n\nLast week’s post provided a cheat sheet for the principal characters in a murder-insurance fraud case perpetrated by a trio of friends.\n\nThe conspirators were grown men who really should have known better: Dr. Richard Boggs, Gene Hanson, and John Hawkins.\n\nDr. Boggs was a California neurologist with a Harvard degree and, at one time, a good reputation and lots of money.\n\nOhio residents Hawkins and Hanson staked their own glory on Just Sweats, a chain of stores they opened to sell workout clothes.\n\nHawkins and Hanson were also lovers, although some sources suggest that the boyishly handsome Hawkins preferred women and was just using Hanson.\n\nOnce Just Sweats faltered, they should have simply filed for bankruptcy and gotten jobs selling health club memberships or real estate.\n\nInstead, they hooked up with Dr. Boggs in California, took the life of an innocent fourth party, and ruined all their own lives.\n\nA number of viewers who left reader comments on the YouTube webpage for “Mistaken for Dead” — the Forensic Files episode about the case — mentioned the plot of the murder-insurance fraud case was hard to follow. So a timeline seems in order.\n\n1970\n\nDr. Richard Boggs, a respected neurologist, helps create Satellite Health Systems, one of the first HMOs in the United States.\n\n1971 to 1976\n\nSatellite Health Systems grows spectacularly but fails to make a profit. Dr. Boggs is millions of dollars in debt.\n\n1977\n\nDr. Boggs declares bankruptcy. Friends say he is never the same afterward.\n\n1978\n\nLola Boggs leaves Dr. Boggs after a marriage of more than 20 years and four children.\n\nHe moves out of the couple’s luxurious Tudor-style house in Glendale, California, and gets an apartment in West Hollywood. He begins partying with young men there.\n\n1981\n\nLola Boggs takes her ex-husband to court over $33,000 in unpaid child support.\n\n1981 to 1988\n\nDr. Boggs continues to spend lavishly, buying a Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith II. He incurs huge debts.\n\nHe is accused of performing unnecessary surgeries on patients. Medical organizations expel him.\n\nAt some point in the 1980s, he meets the two Just Sweats entrepreneurs from Ohio: sexy high school dropout John Hawkins and middle-aged former department-store shoe buyer Melvin Eugene “Gene” Hanson.\n\nHanson becomes Dr. Boggs’ patient.\n\n1985\n\nHawkins and Hanson open their first Just Sweats store, in Columbus, Ohio. It carries a large inventory of colorful exercise clothing.\n\nThe store is a huge success.\n\n1986\n\nThe duo open more Just Sweats for a total of 22 stores in Ohio and Kentucky. They offer such deals as Lycra bike shorts for $4.99.\n\nHawkins appears in TV commercials for the business and becomes “a household name across central Ohio,” according to the Columbus Dispatch.\n\nBut Hawkins and Hanson begin mismanaging the business. They start selling off the stores’ assets for cash.\n\nAt some point, the two men begin plotting a crime that will relieve them of the financial hellhole Just Sweats has become.\n\nHanson starts applying for life insurance. He ultimately obtains three policies totaling $1.5 million and names Hawkins sole beneficiary. The plan is to fake Hanson’s death and get their hands on the insurance money.\n\nThey invite Dr. Boggs in on their plan. His assignment: to procure a body to pass off as Hanson’s.\n\n1988\n\nMeanwhile, Hawkins and Hanson do a Herculean job of hiding the financial problems at Just Sweats. As a Columbus Dispatch story stated:\n\n“Propelled by a series of seemingly ubiquitous TV commercials — all of which featured the wavy-haired, always-smiling entrepreneur — the chain’s annual sales were approaching $10 million. Would-be franchisees were lining up, and major players in the athletic-wear industry were looking to invest.”\n\n1988\n\nRealizing that any prospective Just Sweats investor would require to see an audit — which they cannot allow — Hawkins and Hanson begin looking for an illicit way out.\n\nGene Hanson starts telling people that he has AIDS and is dying. Neither claim is true: Hanson is setting up a story to make his upcoming “death” believable.\n\nApril 9, 1988\n\nDr. Boggs makes his first attempt at acquiring a dead body by killing someone.\n\nThe would-be victim, a computer professional named Barry Pomeroy, complains to the Glendale police that Dr. Boggs tried to murder him by prodding him with an electric device after meeting him at a bar called The Spike and inviting him to his office for an EKG.\n\nThe district attorney declines to press charges because of a lack of corroboration. At least one source says authorities dismissed the incident as a lovers’ spat.\n\nAlso, Dr. Boggs retains some remnants of his former success: A detective who hears of Pomeroy’s claim notes that Dr. Boggs has an excellent reputation in town.\n\nApril 15, 1988\n\nAnother try: Dr. Boggs — and possibly Hanson as well — chat up a stranger named Ellis Greene and somehow entice him to Dr. Boggs’ office. The doctor tasers Greene and murders him by suffocation, then puts Gene Hanson’s driver’s license, credit card, and birth certificate in the dead man’s wallet.\n\nApril 16, 1988\n\nDr. Boggs calls 911 and says a longtime patient named Gene Hanson (who was in reality alive and well and hiding) died from a heart attack in his office; he tried CPR, but it was no use.\n\nParamedics note that rigor mortis already set in. Dr. Boggs claims he tried to call 911 earlier but the line was busy.\n\nLate April 1988\n\nJohn Hawkins jets to California, identifies Greene’s body as Hanson’s, and puts in a claim for $1 million of the insurance money.\n\nAt some point, Hawkins has “Gene Hanson’s body” cremated to destroy evidence.\n\nJuly 1988\n\nFarmers New World Life Insurance sends Hawkins a check for $1 million.\n\nA few days later, a case worker at the insurance company discovers Ellis Greene’s thumbprint taken at the morgue doesn’t match Gene Hanson’s thumbprint on record at the DMV.\n\nTwo other insurers deny claims filed by Hawkins.\n\nHawkins panics. He withdraws $400,000 from Just Sweats accounts and flees to Amsterdam. He buys a boat so he can travel freely.\n\nHanson also abandons Just Sweats stores, and flees separately.\n\n1989\n\nSecurity workers at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport notice a nervous-looking man with plastic surgery scars on his face.\n\nSuspecting he’s a drug courier, they detain the man and find he’s carrying $14,000 in cash.\n\nAlthough he gives his name as either Wolfgang von Snowden or George Soule (sources vary), he has Ellis Greene’s driver’s license. He’s also carrying a Dade County library book called How to Change Your Identity.\n\nHe is Gene Hanson. Police take him into custody.\n\nHanson claims he paid Dr. Boggs $50,000 to supply a corpse but had nothing to do with the murder of Ellis Greene.\n\nJohn Hawkins is still at large.\n\nOctober 10, 1989\n\nThe Los Angeles Times runs an in-depth article called “The Rise and Fall of Dr. Boggs.”\n\n1990\n\nDr. Boggs claims that he didn’t kill Greene; he was already dead. He also said that he only took part in the insurance fraud scheme because Hanson threatened to out him as gay.\n\nRegardless, Dr. Boggs is convicted of murder and insurance fraud and gets a life sentence.\n\nApril 29, 1990\n\nWith John Hawkins still missing, America’s Most Wanted airs a segment about the sweatpants gang’s crime and asks for help locating him.\n\nOprah Winfrey has America’s Most Wanted host John Walsh on her show to discuss the manhunt.\n\nA former girlfriend of Hawkins in Amsterdam sees the Oprah episode and offers info about his whereabouts.\n\nAugust 1991\n\nAuthorities find Hawkins off the coast of Sardinia in a red catamaran named Carpe Diem. He angrily denies that he’s John Hawkins. They seize him anyway.\n\nAugust 8, 1995\n\nGene Hanson goes to trial. He maintains that he thought Dr. Boggs was going to use a cadaver, not murder someone.\n\nNonetheless, a jury convicts him of murder and insurance fraud.\n\nAugust 10, 1995\n\nIt’s Hawkins’ turn to go to trial. Like Hanson, he claims that Dr. Boggs was supposed to use a cadaver; the state drops the murder charge against Hawkins.\n\nBut Hawkins is found guilty of insurance fraud.\n\nAugust 21, 1995\n\nGene Hanson receives life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nOctober 13, 1995\n\nLos Angeles Superior Court Judge Paul G. Flynn gives John Hawkins 25 years to life — a lighter sentence than what his associates got.\n\n2003\n\nDr. Boggs dies in Corcoran State Prison in California at age 69.\n\nMarch 2012\n\nHawkins wins early release from Donovan State Prison in San Diego in part because he participated in Convicts Reaching Out to People, or CROP, a program to help teens stay out of trouble.\n\nMay 2014\n\nA Columbus Dispatch story reveals Hawkins lives with his mother in a San Diego recreational vehicle park and continues to work with troubled young people.\n\nIn a Columbus TV station WBNS-10 interview, Hawkins says he was an arrogant youth. He admits to participating in the insurance fraud scheme but again insists no one was supposed to die.\n\nHawkins tears up on camera and says he’s glad to have a second chance.\n\n2017\n\nHanson remains in prison at Men’s Colony in San Luis Obispo, California.\n\nThat’s all for this post. True Crime Truant will be on vacation next week and back the following Thursday with a post about John Hawkins’ dubious legacy today. Until then, cheers.\n\nUpdate: Read Part 3."
