        "text": "A trendsetting, serial entrepreneur, Rich Boggs has been building multi-million dollar organizations for more than 25 years.\n\nWith a unique talent for fusing creativity, cutting edge business systems, and heart-centered sales, he has been a featured business expert in dozens of global media outlets, including CNN, CBS Evening News, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Fox Business News, ABC World News Tonight, and more.\n\nIn addition to his business success, Richâ€™s passion for both comedy and innovative storytelling led to a successful 10 year acting career. Performing under the stage name Richard Cody, he has shared the screen with a long list of award winning actors including Christian Bale, Reese Witherspoon, Paul Rudd, and others.\n\nRich joined the Brave Thinking Institute as a co-founder in 2012, serving as Creative Director and Expert Enrollment Faculty.\n\nRich is a licensed pilot and spends his free time flying, running half-marathons, and pretending he can surf (this last one keeps his acting skills sharp). He lives in Rancho Santa Fe, California with his two children and his wife Kelli, to whom he has been happily married since 1993."
