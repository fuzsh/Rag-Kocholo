        "text": "278: Insurance Fraud\n\nMelvin Eugene Hanson was dead. The 46-year-old had apparently passed away in his doctor’s office after he’d called to complain about chest pain. Right away, investigators were suspicious. Why had Melvin’s doctor encouraged him to come into the office? Why not tell him to go to the emergency room? Dr. Richard Boggs was quick to provide an answer. He said that Melvin didn’t trust other doctors. But investigators couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off.
