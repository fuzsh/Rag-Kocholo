        "text": "In one of Burke County’s darkest times, three men with a vision turned on a light.\n\nIt went up board by board on the countryside of Keysville.\n\nThey named it Boggs Academy, and for eight decades it stood strong for African-American youth from all over the world who wanted to learn.\n\nBoggs Academy was established in 1906 by Presbyterian Minister the Rev. Dr. John Lawrence Phelps during the days of the Atlanta Race Riots. When things seemed to be falling apart for blacks across the South, Rev. Phelps envisioned a school for African-American youth in Burke County. A trip to Burke County and the sharing of his dream with brothers Rodney and Moses Walker prompted them to donate the two acres of land on which Boggs Academy was established.\n\nFor 80 years, Boggs was a beacon of light and hope for thousands of students who crossed its threshold. The memory of Boggs Academy continues to resonate in the hearts of those who had contact with the institution. Dr. Ruby Saxon- Myles, District 1 School Board representative and a Boggs graduate, tells the story of her mother as a young girl passing by Boggs, stating that her children someday would attend Boggs Academy. That dream became a reality when her six daughters and one son graduated from the institution. By the time Boggs closed its doors in 1986, students from Bermuda, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Gambia, West Africa had enrolled with inquiries coming from as far away as China.\n\nEach year, the Boggs Academy National Alumni Association sends out the call for former students, faculty, and staff to gather, reminisce, and sing the praises of Dear Old BA (Boggs Academy). Responses come from alumni across the nation who credit their success to the Boggs Experience. Many who attended Boggs had a Presbyterian Church [USA] connection. In some cases, they either attended Presbyterian churches in their communities or had relatives who attended\n\nPresbyterian affiliated schools and colleges. The message was also carried by word of mouth. The school’s reputation prompted prominent African-Americans to send their children to Boggs. Alveda King, the niece of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the daughter of Rev. A.D. King, attended Boggs in 1965. Civil Rights leader Hosea Williams’ daughter, Elizabeth Williams, attended and graduated from Boggs in 1969. Mrs. Essie Mae Washington-Williams, daughter of Senator Strom Thurmond, sent her sons Ronald and Julius Williams to Boggs for the 1963-64 school year. Julius Thomas Williams III died in 2012, and his brother Dr. Ronald Williams is an emergency room physician in Centralia, Wash.\n\nBoggs Rural Life Center, Inc. was organized to carry on a tradition of community service and to honor the Boggs Academy mission of “Christian Purpose, Preparation and Performance.”\n\nThe Boggs Rural Life Center continues the tradition of local and community use of the property. Farm land is leased to local famers, residences and buildings are made available for community gatherings and to house the Boggs Intensive Residential Adolescent Boys Treatment Program [West Care]. Various ideas and proposals that flowered in Burke County over the years were planted in the soil of Boggs Academy.\n\nWhile Boggs provided students with a quality education that received high recognition and gained accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, it also rattled the doors of a segregated society. While the lines between black and white were strictly drawn, Boggs had an interracial faculty and, at times, an interracial student body. The Boggs faculty and administration inspired students to look segregation squarely in the face and not blink. Mr. Ralph Luker, a chaplain-intern at the time, writes that Boggs students sent letters to segregationist Georgia Senators Richard B. Russell and Herman Talmadge urging them to support President Johnson’s civil rights legislation. Other students tested an Augusta movie theater’s integration policy, and two Episcopalian students took communion at St. Michael’s Episcopal Church when doing so could have produced a strong community reaction. With the exception of getting Senators Russell and Talmadge to support civil rights legislation, most actions occurred without incident. Mr. Luker, upon reflection, commented that his students were remarkably courageous.\n\nBoggs administrators held interracial meetings on campus, served on public boards, and organized groups that brought federal funding to Burke County. On one occasion, Boggs activities prompted the Ku Klux Klan to burn a cross on the corner of the Boggs campus. Yet, neither the Klan nor local opposition could slow or stop the school’s challenge to segregation. Social Studies teacher Richard Swanson stated that one of his students sent a letter to Georgia Governor Lester Maddox. Mr. Swanson had not paid that much attention to the letter until a G.B.I. agent visited him on campus. The agent pointed out a phrase in the letter that stated if Governor Maddox didn’t start treating black people better, “we’re going to get you.” It took a while for Mr. Swanson to allay the concerns of the agent that the phrase did not constitute a threat.\n\nDirector of the Early Head Start Program, Mrs. Allene Bessent- Reed shared stories of riding the bus to Boggs as a day student. Day students arrived at 8 a.m. and left school at 3 p.m. While Mrs. Reed did not have the advantage of boarding at Boggs, she found ways not only to meet the requirements, but to exceed them. While Boggs had encyclopedias on campus, as a day student she had limited time to use them. Mrs. Reed’s mother was a friend with a local white teacher who hand-copied a section of an encyclopedia at her school in order for Allene to complete an English assignment. While acts of kindness crossed racial lines, many in the African-American community believed that personal initiative was key to long-term success. Mrs. Allene Bessent-Reed, after completing 9th and 10th grades at Boggs, received early admission to Paine College and credits her success in life to the educational foundation she received at Boggs Academy.\n\nWhen Mrs. Glenda Murray-Farrell, President of Boggs Academy National Alumni Association, first visited Boggs it was a culture shock. After an 18-hour bus ride from Chester, Pa., she found herself riding a flatbed truck deep into the Burke County woods. As a city girl, she found the sound of croaking frogs strange and disturbing, but the transition was eased by aunts and cousins who taught and lived on campus. Mrs. Farrell came to love the campus as she met students with similar life experiences who appreciated the academic challenges and the promise of a more fulfilling life that accompanied a Boggs education.\n\nBoggs students were granted a higher status in the Burke County community, a recognition that opened doors of opportunities. It was often commented in Waynesboro that “you knew Boggs students because of the way they comported themselves.” While high academic achievement was its principal goal, another accomplishment put Boggs on the national stage. The Boggs Academy Acapella Choir, under the direction of Mr. C. W. Francis, gained a reputation not usually accorded a high school choir. The Boggs Acapella Choir performed both locally and nationally and was given the distinct honor of performing before the General Assembly of Presbyterian Church [USA]. Another opportunity provided Boggs students was attending an interpretive dance class conducted by choreographer, dancer and actor Geoffrey Holder.\n\nMr. George Roberson, while employed as Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds, saw the transition that took place for students entering Boggs. Mr. Roberson said it was the 24-hour/7 days a week attention the students received that had a major impact on their lives. It gave students time to develop an academic, emotional and moral grounding. It was seeing the impact that Boggs had on students that prompted him to send three of his daughters to school there. When asked if he believed Boggs made a difference, he mused that two of his daughters had earned Ph.D.s and the other one had two Master’s degrees and was only a few hours shy of her Ph.D. After his comment, he smiled and laughed as if their achievements proved the point.\n\nThe candle lit by Rev. Phelps has grown into a festival of lights that can be seen in the activities of those who were touched by Boggs Academy. Even those who did not graduate often instilled in their children a desire for a better life. Dr. Ruby Saxon-Myles when asked which students stood out in her mind, said several students impressed her with their intelligence, strength of character and determination. She noted that Mrs. Rosa Williams, the mother of former Waynesboro Police Chief Alfonzo Williams, was one such student. Dr. Saxon- Myles stated while Rosa Williams did not graduate from Boggs, she inspired her children to reach higher, and her influence is reflected in the accomplishment of her entire family. Dr. Saxon-Myles also mentioned a local pastor, the Rev. C.I. Benefield, who felt his children were not receiving the kind of education they needed and sent his three daughters and son to Boggs. All four graduated and one daughter, Mrs. Arrie Charlesetta Benefield-Jackson, currently teaches First Grade in the Burke County School System.\n\nFrom a brush harbor along a dirt road to a renowned educational institution, Boggs was a stone hewed out of hope that laid the foundation for succeeding generations.\n\nPassing along Quaker Road today, one can only imagine what Burke County was like during the first half of the 20th century, and it’s even harder to imagine what Burke County and the world would have been without Boggs Academy.\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE: author Michael Searles is a retired college professor and an expert on African American history and the Black West. He was a teacher at Boggs Academy from 1977 to 1982.\n\nDid you know?"
