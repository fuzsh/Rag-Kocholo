        "text": "A Richland County man has been convicted of tax evasion.\n\nRichard Boggs, of Irmo, was convicted following a jury trial in federal court for five counts of tax evasion.\n\nAccording to documents and evidence presented at trial, Boggs evaded $274,461 of his 2015 through 2019 individual income taxes by submitting to his employers an IRS Forms W-4 falsely stating he was exempt from federal income tax withholding.\n\nHe also did not file a 2015 through 2019 tax return, even though he was legally required to do so based on the amount of income he earned.\n\n“The Defendant effectively stole more than a quarter million dollars from American taxpayers, and he has earned the punishment he will receive,” said U.S. Attorney Adair F. Boroughs. “I appreciate the hard work of our partners at the IRS to identify and investigate those who seek to illegally manipulate the tax system to enrich themselves.”\n\n“The law is clear on the issue of who is required to file and pay taxes: there is no gray area on the subject,” said Donald “Trey” Eakins, IRS-Criminal Investigation Special Agent in Charge, Charlotte Field Office. “We should not forget that the ultimate victims in tax fraud cases are the people of the United States – those honest taxpayers who diligently file tax returns each year. This conviction sends a message that the IRS is working to make sure that all taxpayers file and pay their fair share of taxes.”"
