Herb was born in Jacksonville, Florida, the son of Sally (Gibson) Boggs and Herbert Richard Boggs Jr., and has lived in Macclenny/Glen St. Mary most of his life. He was a loving son, father, grandfather, brother, and uncle who enjoyed spending time with his family. Herb’s biggest passion was hunting. He loved hunting with his father and was a former Hunt Master with the Macclenny Hunting Club. He was preceded in death by his father, Herbert R. Boggs Jr. in 2011.\n\nHerb had a great sense of humor and could moon-walk at his infamous cookouts like no other.
