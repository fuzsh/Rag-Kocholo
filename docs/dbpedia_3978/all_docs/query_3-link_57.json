        "text": "It has recently been reported that unauthorized trail construction is taking place in the forest. Most recently a new trail alignment was discovered off of Thinner trail near the fork with Gail’s Trail. Please understand that all trail construction must be approved by Cal Fire. FOBM goes through a painstaking process of professional design and development prior to a shovel hitting the ground taking into consideration grade, soils, water runoff and erosion. Most importantly we want to build trails that are fun to hike or ride. Trails randomly constructed actually delay our goal of restoring the trails since we must deconstruct unapproved trails requiring volunteer hours and cost.\n\nWe all want to expedite trail construction with the goal of fully restoring all the trails destroyed in the Valley Fire. If you want to help us please join one of our volunteer trail days. Trail days are posted in advance on our website and Facebook page. Better yet, become a member and receive an email invitation for all trail work and other activities. A membership application can be found here.\n\nJuly 20, 2024\n\nWork has begun on Nate’s Cutoff trail\n\nEagle Scout candidate Ivo Nuti has chosen the rebuilding of Nate’s Cutoff trail as his Eagle Project. The Eagle Scout project is a major service project required to achieve the Eagle Scout rank and must benefit the community or a religious organization. Ivo has worked with FOBM on several trail work days in preparation for the start and on Saturday July 20 the work began. Nate’s Cutoff is a trail connecting Gail’s trail to Boggs Peak trail enabling users to avoid having to hike on road 540 between the two trails. This will be one more trail restored at Boggs Mountain Demonstration State Forest. Many thanks to Ivo and FOBM for this important work!\n\nFriends of Boggs Mountain this year participated in Middletown High School’s “Reach a\n\nDream” scholarship program. The program is community funded and was founded to\n\nprovide scholarships for graduating Middletown High School seniors who are moving on\n\nto higher education, trade schools or entering the Armed Forces. Each applicant goes\n\nthrough a rigorous application and interview process. The Friends of Boggs Mountain\n\nscholarship was established to provide financial assistant to students aspiring to enter\n\ncareers in the outdoors. The awards ceremony was held on May 30, 2024 at\n\nMiddletown High School. In its inaugural year The Friends of Boggs Mountain\n\nscholarship was proudly awarded to three deserving students: Isabella Barriga, Jacob\n\nBrown and Dominick Clark. These students all excelled academically, were active in\n\nathletics, school activities, and provided hundreds of hours of service to their\n\ncommunity. Congratulations to these outstanding students on a job well done.\n\nNearly 100 people gathered at Boggs Mountain Demonstration State Forest on Saturday to celebrate the 75th anniversary of BMDSF. The event sponsored by Friends of Boggs Mountain was a treat for everyone including live music, a delicious lunch, and raffle. Norm Benson, the Forest Manager from 2000 – 2004 and one of the founders of Friends of Boggs Mountain, spoke on the history of Boggs Mountain and current goals for the Forest. The highlight of the event was the presentation of a $15,000 dollar check from Calpine Corp. to FOBM to be used for reconstruction of hiking trails destroyed by the Valley Fire. Thank you to all who made it happen and to all who participated!\n\nUnfortunately, the hike planned for our 75th anniversary celebration is cancelled due to Calfire personnel being committed to fires. The luncheon and the rest of the festivities will continue as planned, so please join us for lunch, music, and a raffle to help fund further trail construction at Boggs Demonstration State Forest if you have already RSVP’d. Lunch will start at around 11:30am at Calso Camp in Boggs Forest."
