Boggs of the Charles County Sheriff’s Office Homeland Security Section was honored by the American Legion’s Southern Maryland District as the first runner-up for the National Law Enforcement Officer of the Year.

In this assignment, he is responsible for coordinating regional responses to terrorism and other threats as well as formulating local intelligence information to share with State and local law enforcement agencies.\n\nM/Cpl. Boggs was nominated for the American Legion’s National Law Enforcement Officer of the Year award based upon his distinguished career with the Sheriff’s Office, which has included many awards and commendations. In 2015, M/Cpl. Boggs was commended for his role in the visit to the CCSO by the U.S. State Department and the Tajikistan Ministry of Internal Affairs. During the visit, he briefed the delegation on domestic terrorism and intelligence gathering and analysis protocols. He has also been recognized for his service in the past on the Special Events Response Team (SERT) as well as the agency’s Honor Guard. In 2008 and 2009, M/Cpl.

Upon graduation from Frostburg State in 1991, he was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Maryland Army National Guard. During his 27 years serving in the Maryland Army National Guard, he was called to active duty on two occasions. From 2006 to 2007, he was deployed to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, where he served as a Detainee Operations Officer and was responsible for movement and treatment of terrorist detainees. After completion of that deployment, he was again activated and deployed to Afghanistan from 2010 to 2011. While on this deployment, M/Cpl. Boggs served as an Afghan National Army Assessment Officer. His responsibilities included assessing the readiness and capabilities of the Afghan National Army. During his military service, M/Cpl.

Boggs is a youth leader with the Boy Scouts of America Venture Crew #1321 program, where he organizes outings and supervises the activities of the Venture Crew.\n\n“I was very proud to nominate M/Cpl. Boggs for this honor,” said Lt. Jon Norris, Commander of the CCSO’s Homeland Security/Intelligence Section. “He has excelled, and continues to excel, in his career with the CCSO. His tireless work in serving and protecting our county and our nation is unparalleled.”\n\n“M/Cpl. Boggs’ dedication to serving others in any capacity is truly humbling,” said Sheriff Troy Berry. “We are grateful for his service here in Charles County, and I anticipate his impact on our community will continue to grow.”"
