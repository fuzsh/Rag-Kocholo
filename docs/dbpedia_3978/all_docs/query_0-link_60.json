        "text": "Michael Kent Boggs was born Sept. 8, 1956, to Don and Judy Boggs and grew up in Cyril. He served as president of the senior class of 1974 and president of his FFA chapter. He desired to become an ag teacher because of the positive influence of his ag ed instructor, Travis Wollenberg.\n\nBoggs enrolled in agricultural education at Oklahoma State University in fall 1974. He served as president of Alpha Tau Alpha, received one of two ag ed student teaching scholarships and in spring 1978 was named Outstanding Ag Ed Student Teacher. He did his student teaching at Marlow under the direction of Ernest Muncrief, who offered Boggs a job to stay and become Marlow’s first-ever second ag teacher. That additional year of mentorship under Muncrief had a profound impact on Boggs’ career success.\n\nBoggs served as an agricultural education instructor and FFA adviser for two years at Marlow (1978-80) and five years at Elgin (1980-85). Elgin was the dream job, but in 1985, when the state FFA executive secretary position opened at the Oklahoma Department of CareerTech, Boggs was encouraged to apply for the position by Muncrief and his district supervisor, Raymond Cockrum. A short time later, Ralph Dreessen offered Boggs the job.\n\nBoggs served for 33 years (1985-2018) as executive secretary of the Oklahoma FFA Association and as a staff member in the ag ed division. He is most proud of coaching and mentoring 232 state FFA officers. He was also responsible for planning and coordinating the statewide leadership component of the student organization, including membership development, marketing and public relations, camps, conferences and the state FFA convention, the largest annual convention held in Oklahoma. He served on the Oklahoma FFA Alumni Council and the National FFA Board of Directors and as secretary of the Oklahoma FFA Foundation.\n\nHonors include Oklahoma and National FFA VIP, Arch Alexander Award, OSU Alumni Association Distinguished Alumni, OSU Agricultural Education Graduate of Distinction, Oklahoma Youth Expo and Tulsa State Fair Show Honoree, Oklahoma Farm Bureau Distinguished Service to Oklahoma Agriculture, National Association of Supervisors in Agricultural Education Outstanding FFA Executive Secretary and National Association of Agricultural Educators Lifetime Achievement.\n\nBoggs had the opportunity to judge market lamb shows all over the United States including three times at the Houston Livestock Show. He was honored to represent the Oklahoma Department of CareerTech as a board member for the Stillwater Area United Way.\n\nHe is extremely appreciative of his numerous friends and colleagues that contributed to the establishment of the Kent Boggs Endowed Trust in both the Oklahoma FFA Foundation and OSU Agricultural Education Scholarship Inc.\n\nKent Boggs was inducted into the CareerTech Hall of Fame in 2022."
