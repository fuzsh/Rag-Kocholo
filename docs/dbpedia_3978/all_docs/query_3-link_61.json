        "text": "Share\n\nElizabeth Jane (Boggs) McCullors, 58, died peacefully at Tidwell Hospice, Venice, Florida on August 1, 2022. Jane was born July 17, 1964, in Parkersburg, WV, to Anna Marie and Arthur Boggs. Jane was a 1982 graduate of St. Marys High School and subsequently West Virginia University. While at WVU, she was a proud member of the WVU Marching Band flag corps. Growing up in a river town, she loved and found joy in the Ohio River. After graduation and before her illness, she worked for The Becky Thatcher riverboat, was a tour bus guide, worked at JoAnn Fabrics, Highmark BCBS and H&R Block. She had many interests, but she especially loved sewing, needlework and crochet. She was a loyal fan of the WVU Mountaineers, Pittsburgh Steelers and Nebraska Cornhuskers. In 2011, Jane was a double lung transplant recipient at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and became a strong supporter of organ donation. Jane had a strong Christian faith and was a member of Venice Presbyterian Church.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her parents and husband, Glen McCullors. She is survived by brothers Mike (Judith) Boggs of Canton, NC, David (Becky) Boggs of Mt. Vernon, IN and Dale Boggs of Venice, FL. She is also survived by nephews Paul Boggs, Richard (Chrystie) Boggs, Matthew Boggs, Jonathan Boggs, John Boggs and James Boggs. Surviving nieces are Kate (Svend) Matheson and Liz (Josh) Guthrie. She had three great nephews and three great nieces. She loved being Aunt Jane. She also leaves behind her beloved “boys”, Frankie and Sniffy.\n\nPer Jane’s wishes, there will be a celebration of life in West Virginia for friends and family at a future date. Jane very much believed in organ donation. Those wishing to honor Jane’s memory with a donation to Help Hope Live can do so by visiting https://helphopelive.org/campaign/2447/\n\nThe funds can be used to help with her final expenses along with helping other transplant recipients."
