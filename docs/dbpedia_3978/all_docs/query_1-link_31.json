        "text": "In historical records, there are surnames that incorporate \"Bog\" or similar root words. We have have learned with Y-DNA testing that similar names may not be related. We have also learned that some surnames with different spellings are related. We have found that some Bogue and Boggs share the same common ancestor. We have found that most Boggs, Bogle, and Bogart have a common ancestor. We have found that some Boggess, Bauguess, and Bogues have a common ancestor. At this point, no relationship has been found between Scot/Irish Boggs and Bogg of England. Beggs and Biggs are likely related. A primary goal at this point would be to get Y-DNA test for Boag of Scotland and Bogue from Ireland to determine where they fit in to the Y-DNA tree.\n\nMales with surnames Baggs, Beggs, Boag, Boags, Bodge, Boegs, Box, Bogg, Boggas, Bogges, Boggis, Boggs, Bogle, Boggus, Bogs, Bogue, Bogart, and Bogues are invited to join.\n\nSNPs have been found to be a key in linking Boggs lines. Most Boggs's fall under the Z18000 haplogroup. Here is a list of kits that have tested for a confirmed final SNP haplogroup at FTDNA or YSEQ or assumed to be based on testing of a close relative.\n\nZ18000 - 424295 Confirmed FTDNA\n\nZ29953 - 266266 Confirmed FTDNA\n\nBY3361 - 447832 Confirmed FTDNA\n\n118306 Known Relative\n\nZ4685 - 191742 Confirmed FTDNA\n\n130781 Known Relative\n\nBY3354 -109371 Confirmed FTDNA\n\n44138 Confirmed FTDNA\n\n110162 Confirmed YSEQ\n\n83602 Confirmed YSEQ\n\n79085 Confirmed FTDNA\n\n150832 Known Relative\n\nBY4015 - 270909 Confirmed FTDNA\n\n118354 Confirmed FTDNA\n\n16304 Confirmed FTDNA\n\n524031 Confirmed FTDNA\n\n264139 Confirmed FTDNA\n\nN61247 Known Relative\n\n55973 Known Relative\n\n61367 Known Relative\n\n130780 Known Relative\n\n394350 Known Relative\n\nBY3349 27994 Confirmed FTDNA\n\n346777 Confirmed FTDNA\n\n131624 Confirmed YSEQ\n\n132790 Confirmed YSEQ\n\n177050 Known Relative\n\n132721 Confirmed YSEQ\n\nLivingston\n\nZ36749 - 217646 Confirmed FTDNA\n\n19255 Confirmed FTDNA\n\n514512 Confirmed FTDNA\n\n181556 Known Relative\n\n87600 Known Relative\n\nBogle\n\nZ36748 - 385777 Confirmed FTDNA\n\nB1417 Confirmed FTDNA\n\n313060 Confirmed FTDNA"
