        "text": "Long before his name became synonymous with the chivalry in the modern world, Richard Boggs was working 60-70 hours a week as the third generation of his family to run Boggs Industries, a leading specialty chemical company, squeezing in time to work on his hobby--writing his first book. Born on August 15, 1968, to a private investigator and a school teacher, Richard Boggs as a child loved history and dreamed of being a soldier and serving his country. After falling in love and marrying his college sweetheart, he shifted gears and majored in Business Administration at Furman University. After graduating from Furman in 1986, summa cum laude, he went on to work for Andersen Consulting and Ernst and Young, specializing in Healthcare consulting. After returning to the family business in 1994, working alongside his sister, he helped expand the company into one of the largest independent specialty chemical companies in the state of Florida. Throughout the next dozen years, he continued his life time love of history, reading and studying the great books of Western Civilization. One day his wife, Dr. Elizabeth Boggs, brought him home an application package for the Masters of Liberal Studies program at Rollins College and that changed his life. As he pursued his passion for the humanities, he became increasingly drawn to the code of the gentleman and the code of chivalry, which he saw as one of the foundational cornerstones of Western Culture. His Master's thesis concentrated on how chivalric ideals from the Iliad to the current day, offer an antidote to the aggressive and violent passions that have plagued men throughout the ages. That thesis was the genesis of his first book, The Unbought Grace of Life: Chivalry in Western Literature.\n\nRead full bio"
