His philosophy on the treatment of trauma and addiction is that it often must go hand in hand. Historically addiction treatment has not adequately addressed the impact of trauma. The trauma narrative must be clearly understood along with the complex connection to addictive behaviors. Predominant is the depressed and anxious client with self-medicating and self-sabotaging behaviors. If the treatment plan does not adequately tend to the underlying intense emotional issues, long-term sobriety may be impacted.
