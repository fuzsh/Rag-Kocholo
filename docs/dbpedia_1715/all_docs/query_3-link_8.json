        "text": "English girl group\n\nLittle Mix are an English girl group that formed on the seventh series of The X Factor. They are the first group and the only girl group to win the original UK series.[1] The lineup consisted of Leigh-Anne Pinnock, Jade Thirlwall, Perrie Edwards, and originally Jesy Nelson, before her departure from the group in 2020. Regarded as the show's most successful winning act, their success led to a girl band renaissance in the UK. Little Mix's vocals and harmonies have garnered critical acclaim[2] and the group have been ranked as one of the best vocal girl groups.[3][4] They were often dubbed, by some media, as the \"biggest girl group in the world\", before going on a hiatus in 2022, allowing its members to pursue solo projects.[5]\n\nLittle Mix rose to prominence with their debut single \"Wings\" (2012), achieving five number-one singles, and nineteen top ten entries on the UK Singles Chart. Launched into mainstream recognition after the release of \"Black Magic\", becoming the first song by a girl group since 2008 to spend multiple weeks at number one. In 2023, it also became the first music video by a British girl group to surpass one billion streams on YouTube and was ranked by Billboard as one of the \"Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time\".[6] The group has broken various records during their career, including becoming the first girl group to spend over 100 weeks inside the top ten of the UK Singles Chart, the first to accumulate six top five entries on the UK Albums Chart, and for holding the record for the highest chart entry for a debut album by a UK girl group on the US Billboard 200.\n\nThe group achieved moderate success in America and retained a popular following in Europe, South America, Asia and other regions with Forbes naming them as one of the most influential acts in Europe. Little Mix also made appearances on Debrett's list of the most influential people in the UK, the Forbes \"30 Under 30\", and the Sunday Times \"Young Rich List\". Their music has amassed over 15 billion streams worldwide, making them one of the most streamed girl groups on Spotify. Since their debut, their music has been cited as gay anthems, girl power anthems, and feminist anthems, while gaining popularity in South Korea, with Pitchfork describing them as \"the girl group who has captured K-pop's spirit better than any other western girl group\".[7][8] Little Mix have sold over 3 million concert tickets worldwide, and performed in over 20 countries across their tours, with the Confetti Tour, being their most critically acclaimed.[9][10][11]\n\nIn 2021, Little Mix became the first girl group in 41 years to win the British Group award at the Brit Awards. Their other accolades include a Madame Tussauds figure, three Brit Awards, seven MTV Europe Music Awards (the most wins for Best UK & Ireland Act), four Glamour Awards, a iHeartRadio Music Award, two Japanese Gold Disc Awards and three Guinness World Records. They have amassed a huge following of LGBTQ+ fans winning a British LGBT Award, an Attitude Award, and were named as Glamour's \"Women of the Year and Game-changers in music\". Often named as one of the greatest girl groups of all time, Little Mix have sold over an estimated 60 million records worldwide,[12][13][14][15] making then one of the best-selling girl groups of all time, and one of Britain's biggest selling acts.[16]\n\nHistory\n\n2011–2012: Formation and The X Factor\n\nIn 2011, Edwards, Thirlwall, Pinnock and Nelson individually auditioned successfully as soloists for the eighth series of the UK version of The X Factor in front of judges Louis Walsh, Gary Barlow, Tulisa and Kelly Rowland,[17] but failed the first challenge of the \"bootcamp\" section.[18] They were allowed another chance to compete when they were placed in two separate ensembles by the judges during the \"group bootcamp\" stage, with Edwards and Nelson in four-member group Faux Pas and Thirlwall and Pinnock in three-member group Orion.[18][19] Both groups failed to make it through to the next stage. A later decision by the judges recalled two members from each group to form the four-piece group Rhythmix, sending them through to the \"judges' houses\" section.[20] Footage released in November 2022 revealed that Rowland alone was the judge who formed the group.[21]\n\nThey reached the live shows section and were mentored by Tulisa.[22] During the first live show on 8 October 2011, Rhythmix performed \"Super Bass\" by American recording artist Nicki Minaj. Their rendition was praised by the judges with Barlow calling them the \"best girl band that's ever been on The X Factor.\"[23] On 26 October 2011, it was announced that they would change their name following a dispute with Rhythmix, a Brighton-based children's music charity of the same name, after the programme tried to trademark \"Rhythmix\".[24][25] A spokesman for The X Factor said, \"At the request of the charity Rhythmix, the members of the girl group Rhythmix have decided to change their name, a decision which has the support of Syco and TalkbackTHAMES.\"[26] It was reported that the group decided to make the change, with no legal requirement to do so, to avoid any difficulties for the charity.[26] On 28 October 2011, it was announced that the group's new name would be \"Little Mix\".[27]\n\nOn 20 November 2011, Little Mix became the first girl group in the show's eight-year history to progress past the seventh live show. The previous longest-surviving girl groups were The Conway Sisters (series 2) and Hope (series 4), who had both lasted until week 7. Through the remaining course of the competition the group generally received positive feedback. On 3 December 2011, during the semi-final stage of the show, Little Mix performed The Supremes's \"You Keep Me Hangin' On\" for their Motown classic as well as Beyoncé's hit \"If I Were a Boy\" for a song they believe it can get them to the final. Their performance of \"You Keep Me Hangin' On\" received mostly negative feedback from the judges with Walsh stating that they \"lost their mojo\" and Rowland telling them she had seen them do \"better vocal performances.\" Their second performance of the night, \"If I Were a Boy\", was generally acclaimed by the judges with Walsh telling them they have \"amazing potential\" and calling them the \"next big girlband.\" Rowland also told them they could be \"incredibly dynamic\" and \"change the world\" when they find the strength within each other. On 4 December 2011, Little Mix made X Factor history by becoming the first girlband ever to make the final of the show. They advanced to the final alongside Marcus Collins and Amelia Lily.\n\nOn 11 December 2011, Little Mix were announced as the winners of The X Factor 2011, the first time that a group had won the UK show and the second (of five) in the worldwide franchise (after Random on the first series of the Australian version).[28][29] Their winner's single was a cover of Damien Rice's song \"Cannonball\", which was released via digital download on 11 December 2011 and on CD on 14 December 2011.[30][31] The Xtra Factor: The Winner's Story was shown on ITV2 on 17 December 2011.[32] Their debut single topped the UK Singles Chart on 18 December 2011.[33] They made the Christmas number one spot on the Irish Singles Chart, beating novelty songs by The Saw Doctors and Ryan Sheridan.[34]\n\nThe X Factor Performances And Results Show Song Choice Theme Result Perrie Edwards Jesy Nelson Leigh-Anne Pinnock Jade Thirlwall Auditions \"You Oughta Know\" \"Bust Your Windows\" \"Only Girl (in the World)\" \"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\" Free Choice Advanced To bootcamp Bootcamp 1 \"Breakeven\" \"Price Tag\" \"Price Tag\" \"Firework\" Bootcamp challenge Transferred to the groups category Bootcamp 2 \"Survivor\" (with 'Faux Pas') \"Yeah 3x\" (with 'Orion') Bootcamp songs Regrouped/Advanced To Judges' houses Judges' houses \"Big Girls Don't Cry\" Free choice Advanced to live shows \"Cry Me a River\" Live Show 1 \"Super Bass\" Britain vs America Saved by Tulisa Live Show 2 \"I'm Like a Bird\" Love and Heartbreak Safe (4th) - 8.7% Live Show 3 \"Tik Tok\"/\"Push It\" Rock Safe (6th) - 6.0% Live Show 4 \"E.T.\" Halloween Safe (2nd) - 13.7% Live show 5 \"Don't Stop the Music\" Dancefloor fillers Safe (4th) - 11.9% Live Show 6 \"Radio Ga Ga\"/\"Telephone\" Lady Gaga vs. Queen Safe (3rd) - 15.3% Live Show 7 \"Don't Let Go (Love)\" Movies Safe (1st) - 26.1% Quarter-Final \"Baby\"/\"Where Did Our Love Go\" Guilty pleasures Safe (2nd) - 22.4% \"Beautiful\" Musical heroes Semi-Final \"You Keep Me Hangin' On\" Motown Safe (1st) - 34.4% \"If I Were a Boy\" Song to get you to the final Final \"You've Got the Love\"[citation needed] Free Choice Safe (1st) - 39.0% \"If I Ain't Got You\"/\"Empire State of Mind\" (with Tulisa Contostavlos)[citation needed] Mentor Duet \"Don't Let Go (Love)\" Favourite Performance Winner (1st) - 48.3% \"Silent Night\" Christmas \"Cannonball\"[35] Winner's Single\n\n2012–2013: DNA and international breakthrough\n\nOn 25 January 2012, Little Mix made an appearance at the National Television Awards and performed the En Vogue song \"Don't Let Go (Love)\". They also accompanied fellow judges Gary Barlow and Tulisa Contostavlos on stage to receive the Best Talent Show award that had been won by The X Factor.[36] In May 2012, Little Mix reportedly signed a deal with Vivid and Bravado to release signature products including dolls, puzzles, accessories and games.[37] Prior to their debut single release, the group covered an a cappella version of Beyoncé's \"End of Time\" and uploaded it on YouTube; the cover was publicly praised, especially for the group's impressive harmonies.[38] Later in August, they also uploaded another cover, this time an acoustic cover of \"We Are Young\" by Fun ft. Janelle Monáe which again received positive feedback, generally, for the group's harmonies. On 1 June, a snippet of their debut single \"Wings\" previewed on chat show Alan Carr: Chatty Man before its later release date in August.[39]\n\nLittle Mix performed their debut single \"Wings\" for the first time at the T4 on the Beach concert on 1 July.[40] The single debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart.[41] On 31 August 2012, the group's autobiography, titled Ready to Fly, was released by HarperCollins.[42][43] In October 2012, the group went on a promotional visit to Australia due to their expanding fan base there, destinations included Melbourne and Sydney. The trip lasted a week and the group visited radio stations to promote the single and debut album. They performed their single \"Wings\" on Australian The X Factor and on Australian breakfast-television show Sunrise. \"Wings\" subsequently reached number 2 on the Australian iTunes chart and number 3 on the ARIA charts.[44] Their debut album, DNA, was released in November 2012. Nicola Roberts co-penned a track called \"Going Nowhere\" on the DNA album. The album reached number 3 in both Ireland and the UK. A second single, \"DNA\", was released in October,[45] and in January 2013 they signed a record deal with Columbia Records in North America.[46] \"Wings\" was released as their debut single in America on 5 February 2013. In the US, the single reached number 79 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart while the album reached number 4 on the Billboard 200.[47] On 3 February 2013, they released \"Change Your Life\" as the album's third single, which charted at number 12 on the UK Singles Chart.[48] On 4 March 2013, it was announced that \"How Ya Doin'?\" would be released as the fourth and final single from their debut album.[49]\n\nOn 21 March, they announced that their next single, \"How Ya Doin'?\", would feature Grammy Award-winning musician Missy Elliott.[50] On 4 April 2013, the group revealed that Schwarzkopf hair dye Live Colour XXL would be promoted through their music video for \"How Ya Doin'?\" in a new sponsorship deal.[51] \"How Ya Doin'?\" debuted at number 57 on the UK Singles Chart on 20 April 2013, before ascending to number 23 the week after.[52] In its third week, the song peaked at number 16,[53] marking Little Mix's fifth consecutive UK top 20 hit.[54] It charted for a further seven weeks.[54] \"How Ya Doin'?\" sold 120,000 copies in the UK. The single debuted at number 55 on the Irish Singles Chart on 11 April 2013.[55] It then climbed the chart to peak at number 26. Consequently, \"How Ya Doin'?\" became Little Mix's first single to miss the top 20 in Ireland, but spent a total of seven weeks on the chart.[56] The single peaked at number 16 on the Scottish Singles Chart on 11 May 2013,[57] marking the group's fifth consecutive top 20 hit in Scotland.[58]\n\n2013–2014: Salute and \"Word Up!\"\n\nIn March 2013, Little Mix began their first promotional campaign in the US. In an interview with Digital Spy in March 2013, they stated that they wanted their second album to have a more R&B sound.[59] Nelson added: \"I personally want to put a lot more dancey stuff in there. As in, one of the songs that comes on in a club that makes you want to dance. Not that David Guetta sound, but more R&B – a bit like Eve and Gwen Stefani's 'Let Me Blow Ya Mind'.\" They also revealed that they would be starting to write material for the new album in the coming months.[59] On 4 October, they uploaded a video to their official YouTube page, announcing that their second album would be called Salute and would be available for pre-order on 7 October.[60] The album was released on 11 November 2013 in the United Kingdom and was released in the United States on 4 February 2014. Throughout the recording process, Little Mix worked with several producers, including TMS, Future Cut, Fred Ball, Duvall and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. The album was largely co-written by Little Mix, who stated that they were more involved in the development of this album than with their debut.\n\nOn 23 September 2013, \"Move\" was premiered on BBC Radio 1. For the single, Little Mix worked with Nathan Duvall, an up-and-coming R&B producer and Maegan Cottone, the girl's vocal coach. \"Move\" was released on 7 October in Australia and New Zealand. It was later released in the UK and Ireland on 3 November. It was sent to Mainstream Radio in the US on 18 February 2014 and reached number 38 on that chart. The song peaked at number three in the UK, number five in Ireland, number 19 in Japan and number 12 in New Zealand. The single also charted in Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands and Slovakia. Since then, \"Move\" has been certified gold in Australia for sales of 35,000[62] and gold in the UK for sales of 400,000.[63] \"Little Me\" was selected as the second single from the album. The song was co-written by TMS and Iain James and produced by TMS. On 21 November 2013, Little Mix revealed via a YouTube video message that they decided to release it as the second single because it held a lot meaning to them and was written with their fans in mind.[64] The song reached number 14 in the UK, number fifteen in Iceland and number 16 in the Netherlands. It also charted in Australia, Ireland and Lebanon. The band released a cover version of Cameo's song \"Word Up!\" as the official single for Sport Relief 2014.[65][66] The song reached number six in the UK and number thirteen in Ireland while also charting in Australia, Austria, Denmark and France.\n\nLittle Mix announced on 5 April 2014 that the title track \"Salute\" will be released as the album's third single.
