The band's name did come from a sculpture.\n\nWe Are All Made Of StarsMoby\n\nMoby says that \"We Are All Made Of Stars\" is scientifically accurate, since all matter originates from stardust.\n\nFool In The RainLed Zeppelin\n\nIn Led Zeppelin's \"Fool In The Rain,\" the guy goes into a funk when he thinks he's been stood up, but is elated when he realizes he's been standing on the wrong corner, and it's all a terrible mess.\n\nSongs in Famous Movie Scenes: '80s EditionMusic Quiz\n\nYou know the scenes - Tom Cruise in his own pants-off dance off, Molly Ringwald celebrating her birthday - but do you remember what song is playing?\n\nBilly Steinberg - \"Like A Virgin\"They're Playing My Song\n\nThe first of Billy's five #1 hits was the song that propelled Madonna to stardom. You'd think that would get you a backstage pass, wouldn't you?\n\nSpooner OldhamSongwriter Interviews\n\nHis keyboard work helped define the Muscle Shoals sound and make him an integral part of many Neil Young recordings. Spooner is also an accomplished songwriter, whose hits include \"I'm Your Puppet\" and \"Cry Like A Baby.\""
