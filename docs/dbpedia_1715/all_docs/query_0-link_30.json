        "text": "Resources\n\nARTIST :\n\nConfession : I used to be a purist ‚Äì my #MercrediMusique songs had to be in French only. But I have long let go of this unnecessary limitation and now quite a few of the songs that I feature include lyrics in more than one language. My students are better off because of this not only due to their exposure to Arabic, Lingala, or Wolof that showcase the richness and interconnectedness of the francophone world and the fact that languages don‚Äôt exist in a vacuum. Rest assured, they do know about colonialism. And if the song is in both French and English, you have more chances of the kids connecting with it which is always a win in my book.\n\nThe unexpected bonus of this song choice in one of my classes showed up in this way ‚Äì ‚ÄúMadame, Stormzy IS one of my favorite artists!‚Äù said my British immigrant who‚Äôs also a fan of Aya. I knew she would appreciate this collaboration but I could not predict that that she‚Äôd give us an in-depth explanation of all the reasons why she appreciates Stormzy in perfectly imperfect franglais.\n\nI am certain that you know of Aya Nakamura and may have your doubts about including her songs in your lessons. Let me assure you, both lyrics and videoclip are clean, not even a double entendre which is *very* strange if you are familiar with Aya üôÇ In case you want to learn more about the artists, here are some links :\n\nNRJ about Aya Nakamura\n\nALL Music ‚Äì Stormzy biography\n\nABOUT THE SONG :\n\nPURE Break Charts about the clip\n\nMOUV‚Äô about the clip\n\nGreatSong ‚Äì lyrics + explanations + subtitled video\n\nSLIDES :\n\nClick here to make your own editable copy of the slides above.\n\nSUGGESTIONS :\n\nSlide 3 : Artists\n\nTell students about the artists in simple comprehensible language. Make sure to include your not so hidden geography agenda by asking about where Mali and Ghana are located and following up by clicking on the links and allowing students to interpret Wikipedia articles based on their readiness ‚Äì basic facts for Novices, intro paragraph for Intermediates. This is where you zoom in on the part in the right column that states the independence date and from which country to remind them of colonialism. If you have time, you can also explain what ‚Äúgriots‚Äù are through the link as well.\n\nSlide 4 : Anticipation\n\nThis is a very clear story that students pick up right away. Even better! Insiste that they explain how they came to their conclusions by engaging them in See-Think-Wonder routine. Provide sentence starters as needed for Novices; you can also ask Intermediates to imagine what happened that lead to this situation.\n\nSlide 5 : Lyrics\n\nThe lyrics are Novice friendly because of cognates, repetition and the words that your students most likely already know by this time of the year (j‚Äôai, jamais, mon coeur, j‚Äôsais, donner, etc). No, they won‚Äôt be able to understand everything but you can definitely ask them (before showing the English version) if the lyrics fit the predictions they made based on the pictures in Anticipation. Intermediates will be more successful in interpreting the lyrics, of course. In both cases, ask students cite the words/lines to support their predictions about the song. If you want, you can also explain to them what verlan is on the example of ‚Äúc‚Äôest relou‚Äù (feel free to adjust my translation as well). Finally, click on Paroles on the slide and follow the link to play subtitled clip.\n\nSlide 6: Les avis\n\nAs usual, after the viewing, ask the students to express their opinions about the song and the artists in writing or orally. While Novices can work on stating opinions and simple reactions of agreeing and disagreeing with peers, Intermediates can definitely have a lively discussion about their preferences.\n\nVoil√†, c‚Äôest tout. √Ä la prochaine.\n\nP.S. We listened to this song in February. And since I have a self-imposed rule that I don‚Äôt repeat an artist in a given semester for a variety of reasons, there are times that I come across a song of the artist that has already been featured and make an executive decision to play it in addition to the day‚Äôs featured clip and *outside* of the regular #MercrediMusique playlist for a class or two that has hard core fans of that artist. I even announce it as ‚ÄúC‚Äôest une chanson hors notre liste officiel. Je l‚Äôai choisie pour [nom de l‚Äô√©l√®ve qui est fan]‚Äù And they smile wide while the class enjoys a few extra minutes of music. If you‚Äôre the same way, here is a clip that I just played for my Aya fans. Je vous le recommande. We had such a beautiful discussion about this song with my Intermediates who had already heard a few of Aya‚Äôs songs about the genres that influenced it and what it made them feel and think. This is where you see your efforts pay off as the kids have the vocabulary and confidence discussing various aspects of a song on the spot."
