She’s expert in ballads and music that blends classic French chanson, folk, and pop. In English, I’m not much for ballads, except for the handful that I stand on and listen to incessantly (Whole Lotta History, A Million Lights, and you’ll all have noticed that Out From Under has pushed its way into the “sadgirls” playlist).",

        "text": "Isabelle Boulay is a francophone Canadian singer whose material is outside my usual genre. She’s expert in ballads and music that blends classic French chanson, folk, and pop. In English, I’m not much for ballads, except for the handful that I stand on and listen to incessantly (Whole Lotta History, A Million Lights, and you’ll all have noticed that Out From Under has pushed its way into the “sadgirls” playlist).\n\nOne unfortunate trait that The Neighbour and The Empress share is a fondness for Céline Dion. I have been gentle with The Empress on this, though The White Rabbit has not. The White Rabbit pulls no punches; she once said Taylor Swift had the face of a weasel and did nothing but whine and collect squad members, and she seemed truly surprised at our annoyance.\n\nThe Neighbour tried to trick me by saying that Céline’s French output was a fair bit better than her English-language and that I should give it a listen, but I never bit.\n\nThis song is a classic example of Isabelle Boulay’s oeuvre. I attempted to translate in meter, but there are sections with double meaning — especially “Je veux laisser mon coeur,” whose repetition sounds like a lead-up to “I want to let it fly” except that while laisser does mean “let/allow/permit,” it also means “set free/liberate”, which means this stanza is too complex to properly translate."
