        "text": "My wife and I often listen to Radio Paradise, a listener-supported, ad-free radio station from California. They've been playing this song by Zaz recently. I like it and maybe your students would too. I shouldn't really reproduce the lyrics here for copyright reasons, but I am going to translate them (with the help of another video). You could copy and paste this translation and set it for classwork (not homework, I suggest, since students could just go and find the lyrics online). The song was released in 2015 and gotr to number 11 in the French charts - only number 11!\n\nHere we go:\n\nRemind me of the day and the year\n\nRemind me of the weather\n\nAnd if I've forgotten, you can shake me\n\nAnd if I want to take myself away\n\nLock me up and throw away the key\n\nWith pricks of memory\n\nTell me what my name is\n\nIf I ever forget the nights I spent, the guitars, the cries\n\nRemind me who I am, why I am alive\n\nIf I ever forget, if I ever take to my heels\n\nIf one day I run away\n\nRemind me who I am, what I'd promised myself\n\nRemind me of my wildest dreams\n\nRemind me of those tears on my cheeks\n\nAnd if I've forgotten how much I love to sing\n\nIf I ever forget the nights I spent, the guitars, the cries\n\nRemind me who I am, why I am alive\n\nIf I ever forget, if I ever take to my heels\n\nIf one day I run away\n\nRemind me who I am, what I'd promised myself\n\nRemind me who I am if ever I forget\n\netc"
