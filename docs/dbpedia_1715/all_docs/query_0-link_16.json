        "text": "Quality Lyrics Translation + Free French Lesson\n\nDesireless\n\nVoyage, Voyage\n\n(1986)\n\nWord for word French to English lyrics translation\n\nDifficult meanings explained\n\nVideo 1: Official video\n\nVideo 2: Lyrics video\n\nBefore we start, here are some other song based French lessons I've done\n\nStromae Alor On Danse, Serge Gainsbourg Je T'aime (moi non plus) , Edith Piaf Je Ne Regrette Rien, Malicorne Le Luneux, Zaz Je Veux, Olivia Ruiz La Femme Chocolat\n\nFOR THE REST CLICK HERE\n\nPART ONE\n\n​\n\n​Au-dessus des vieux volcans\n\nOver the old volcanos OR\n\nAbove old volcano's OR\n\nUp above the old volcanos\n\nAu-dessus = [above. over/ overhead/ higher than] RANT WARNING: ARRRRGGGGHH! This one word caused me more trouble when learning and practicing French then any other word in the rest of their entire language. Why? Because for some insane deluded reason the French decided to attribute polar opposite meanings to two words that to any johnny foreign ears would sound exactly the same: au-dessus [over/ above] sounds very very similar (atleast to the unaccomplished) to au-dessous [under/ underneath/ below]. (note that the same problem arises with dessous and dessus) It is the inablity (particularly among anglophones) to distinguish between the 'u' sound (/y/ in phonetics), and the 'ou' sound (confusingly /u/ in phonetics), which is at the heart of the problem. You think I'm exagerating? Listen to the first ten seconds of this trailer for Sens Dessous Dessus [upside down] and all you will hear from this Quebecoise saying these two opposite meaning words is: 'dsoo dsoo.'\n\nNow, of course, when pronounced very slowly and well enunciated you can (after some experience) tell the difference:\n\nHowever, when you are on a building site (like I was), and your screaming to someone in a noisy JCB instructions on whether to dig above or below an electricity cable that was revealed in a trench in the ground, (as I did) whilst standing at the top of that trench (as I stupidly was) then, this subtle difference in pronunciation can become a question of life and death. I survived the incident, but not without cursing 'Moliere' and all his kind for not having made the French words for below and above COMPLETELY FECKING DIFFERENT!!! So, if you are struggling with these two than try this: the 'ou' sound is similar to an orangutan going 'oou' 'oou' 'oou.' On the other hand, the 'u' sound is similar to the sound someone makes when, in reaction to someone else being grouchy, they do an impression of a posh old lady holding her handbag with both hands up high in front of her going 'uuuwww'. Perhaps this video will explain it better:\n\nEND OF RANT: let's continue with...\n\n​des = [of the] NOTE: 'des' has more or less two meanings depending on context. The first (as here) is as the contracted form of de + les [of + the/ from + the]. The second (as seen below in the second line of PART THREE) is also as the contraction of de + les but the meaning is different. Very roughly, this second meaning is 'some'. This translation is so rough in fact, that it sticks out like a saw thumb and you end up simply not translating it half the time. (see below)\n\nvieux = [old]\n\nvolcans = [volcanos]\n\nGlisse tes ailes sous le tapis du vent\n\nSlide your wings under the carpet of the wind OR\n\nslip your wings under a blanket like wind\n\nGlisse = [slip/ slide/ glide (not as in 'air' but as in 'along runners)] NOTE: the fact that 'tes' [your (familiar)] which follows and yet glisse has no 's' at the end is a good indication that we are dealing with the IPERATIF. This is the form of a verb used when you are telling/ordering somebody to do or refrain from doing something. (hence the exclamation mark)\n\n...IMPERATIF forms of glisser\n\n(tu) glisse!\n\n(nous) glissons!\n\n(vous) glissez!\n\ntes = [your] familar (tu) form\n\nailes = [wings] Re pronuciation, this word is designed to trip you up. it is pronounced /ɛl/ i.e. take the 'e' from bed and stick an 'l' on the end of it. I always use to get this word mixed up (pronunciation wise) with ail [garlic] which is pronounced /aj/ (sounds a bit like the 'ay' in 'hay'). This word I would inturn mix up with aille (subjonctif of aller) which is pronounced exactly the same.\n\nsous = [under] SEE RANT. Though happily enough, the opposite of 'sous' is 'sur' as seen in line six of part four below. NOTE: the latter could sound similiar to the former if you forget to pronounce the 'r' at the end, which sounds a bit like how a scouser pronounces 'ck'\n\nle = [the]\n\ntapis = [carpet/ rug/ mat] NOTE: that a large wall to wall carpet attached to the floor is called a moquette. NOTE: Confusion can arise with the verb tapisser which actually means 'to wallpaper'\n\ndu = [of the]\n\nvent = [wind]\n\nVoyage, voyage, éternellement\n\nTravel, Travel, eternally OR\n\nGo and travel, go and travel, eternally OR\n\nvoyage, voyage, eternally\n\nVoyage = [travel/ go travel around/ go voyage] 2nd person singular of the verb...\n\n...voyager in the IMPERATIF\n\n(tu) voyage\n\n(nous) voyagons\n\n(vous) voyagez\n\nNOTE: when I first heard this song I thought she was using the noun voyage [a journey/ a voyage] but this is clearly stupid. What she is actually doing (which continues through-out the song) is telling an individual that she knows well (because she uses the 'tu' form) to go off and see the world. We know she is telling them because she uses the impertif form (otherwise, voyage would have an 's' on the end) Though when I say 'tell' it is clear that it is in a motherly/fatherly kind of way.\n\nNOTE: To save time, we are going to stick with 'travel' as the translation of 'voyage'\n\nvoyage = (see above)\n\n​éternellement = [eternally]\n\nPART TWO\n\nDe nuages en marécages\n\nFrom clouds to swamps OR\n\nFrom clouds to marshes/fens\n\nDe = [of/ from]\n\nnuages = [clouds]\n\nen = [to] NOTE: the translation of this word in this context is a bit tenuous, I admit it. Generally speaking, 'en' has two meanings: 'of it' and 'in.' However, being a preposition, it multitasks. As used in the set phrase 'de _____ en _____, [from______ to_____] you have to read it as 'to' , like it or lump it.\n\nmarécages = [swamps/ marshes/ fens]\n\nDe vents d'Espagne en pluies d'Équateur\n\nFrom Spanish winds to Ecuadorian rains OR\n\nFrom winds of Spain to rains of Ecuador\n\nOR IS IT...\n\n... equatorial rains\n\nDe = [from/ of]\n\nvents = [winds]\n\nd' = [of/ from]\n\nEspagne = [spain]\n\nen = [(read as 'to')]\n\npluies = [rains]\n\nd' = [of]\n\nÉquateur = [Ecuador (though without the capital letter you would have to read as 'equatorial']\n\nVoyage, voyage, vole dans les hauteurs\n\nGo travel, go travel; fly up on high OR\n\ntravel, travel; fly in the skies OR\n\nVoyage, voyage; and fly in the open skies\n\nVoyage = [travel ...etc (see above)\n\n​voyage = [(see above)]\n\nvole = [fly] 2nd person singular of the verb...\n\n...voler in IMPERATIF\n\n(tu) vole!\n\n(nous) volons!\n\n(vous) volez!\n\ndans = [in]\n\nles = [the]\n\nhauteurs = [heights/ upland regions]\n\nPART THREE\n\n​\n\nAu-dessus des capitales,\n\nAbove the capitals OR\n\nUp above the capital cities\n\nAu-dessus =[above/ over]\n\ndes = [of the]\n\ncapitales = [capitals/ capital cities]\n\n​des idées fatales\n\n(are) Fatal ideas OR\n\n(are) Inevitable/fated ideas OR\n\n(are) Iresistable ideas\n\n​des = [some (or leave untranslated)]\n\nidées = [ideas]\n\nfatales = [fated/ fatal/ iresistable]\n\nRegarde l'océan\n\nOR IS IT...\n\nRegardent l'ocean\n\nLook at the ocean OR\n\nJust see the ocean! OR\n\nCheck out the ocean!\n\nOR IS IT...\n\n(who) are watching the ocean\n\nRegarde(nt) [look!/ just see!/ watch!] OR [(they) look to/ (they) watch] NOTE: Because of the way regarde (2nd person singular IMPERATIF) and regardent (3rd person plural PRÉSENT) sound exactly the same (phonetically written /ʀ(ə)gaʀd/) the only way of knowing which (other than when the final 't' of the latter makes a liaison with a following word, but only if that other word starts with a vowel sound) is by using context. The only problem with context being the deciding factor, as here, is that the context can also be ambiguous. You could interpret the last three lines as the first two and the last being seperate from each other. i.e.\n\n~~above the capitals are fated ideas. Just look at the ocean!\n\nOr you could read them as one unique sentence\n\n~~above the capitals are fated ideas watching the ocean\n\nTo be honest, both work. Most of the lyrics as written on the net write 'regarde' rather than 'regardent' but 'majority rules' is often synonymous with 'majority stupid' so I'll leave it to you to decide.\n\nl' = [the]\n\nocéan ​= [ocean]\n\nContinued below, but first...\n\nLet me know what you think of my site.\n\nThe advertising revenue doesn't even pay for the internet connection so I'm clearly not doing this for the money. I'd really appreciate if you could let me know if the site is helping you as it's taking up quite a lot of my free time and a little encouragement would help. Even a simple 'thank you' would be much appreciated.\n\nName (use a fake one if you want) *\n\nCountry/Region/City (optional) *\n\nE-mail (optional) *\n\nTick the box below if you don't mind me publishing your comment (alongside the name you gave) on this website. *\n\nI don't mind.\n\n* Indicates required field\n\nComment (optio... well, kinda the point really) *\n\nPART FOUR(chorus)\n\nVoyage, voyage,\n\nTravel, travel OR\n\nGo travel, go travel OR\n\nVoyage, voyage\n\nVoyage = [travel (see above)]\n\nvoyage, = [(see above)]\n\nPlus loin que la nuit et le jour\n\nFurther than the night and the day OR\n\nPlus = [more]\n\nloin = [far/ far away/ distant]\n\nque = [than]\n\nla = [the]\n\nnuit = [night]\n\net = [and]\n\nle = [the]\n\njour = [day]\n\nNOTE: I think this bit refers to the fact that when you voyage far enough time itself changes (well not really, your just changing arbitrary set time zones), even to the point that by passing over the international date line you can go back a day.\n\nVoyage,\n\n(see above)\n\nDans l'espace inouï de l'amour\n\nInto the incredible space of love OR\n\nInto the unheard of place of love OR\n\nInto love's virgin territory\n\nOR IS IT...\n\nInto places unheard of by love\n\nDans = [in(to)] NOTE: 'dedans' is really the word for 'into' but it is rarely used by the French who much prefer to use 'dans' ubiquitously\n\nl' = [the]\n\nespace = [space (as in room)/ space (as in area)/ space (as in cosmos)/ space (as in keyboard)]\n\ninouï = [unheard of/ extra-ordinary] NOTE: the literal meaning is 'unheard of' as the 'ouï' part derives from the word 'ouïe' meaning 'hearing'.\n\nde = [of]\n\nl' = [the]\n\namour = [love]\n\nVoyage, voyage,\n\n(see above)\n\nSur l'eau sacrée d'un fleuve indien\n\nOn the sacred waters of an indian river.\n\nSur = [on] NOTE: see what I wrote about sous and sur above in part one.\n\nl' = [the] By the way, all these l or d + apostrohpes are the result of what is called an elision. They were originally either 'la/le or de' before this happened, but I've just bored myself, let alone you, so continuons.\n\neau = [water] NOTE. Everybody I knew called water 'la flotte,' at least where drinking water was concerned.\n\nsacrée = [sacred]\n\nd' = [of]\n\nun = [a]\n\nfleuve = [river] NOTE: a fleuve is a main river that runs into the sea, a riviere is a smaller river that runs into either a fleuve or some other water thing (lake, pool ...etc), and ruisseau is a stream/brook.\n\nindien = [indian]\n\nVoyage,\n\n(see above)\n\nEt jamais ne reviens\n\nAnd never return OR\n\nAnd don't come back\n\n​Et = [and]\n\njamais = [never/ ever]\n\nne = [(negation) no/don't]\n\n​reviens = [return/ come back] 2nd person singular of the verb...\n\n...revenir in the IMPERATIF\n\n(tu) reviens\n\n(nous) revenons\n\n(vous) revenez\n\nNOTE: this is one of those irregular imperatif forms that keeps the 's' in the 2nd person singular\n\nNOTE: The construction of the above line is much more rarer than the more usual 'et ne reviens jamais'\n\nPART FIVE\n\nSur le Gange ou l'Amazone\n\nOn the Ganges or the Amazon\n\nSur = [on] NOTE: see what I wrote above about this and 'sous'\n\nle = [the]\n\nGange = [ganges]\n\nou = [or]\n\nl' = [the]\n\nAmazone = [amazon river]\n\nChez les blacks, chez les Sikhs, chez les jaunes\n\nAt home with the sub-saharan africans, the sikhs, the orientals OR\n\nIn the sub-saharan african homelands, in the sikh homelands, in the oriental-asian homelands.\n\n(these are the more politically correct translations. But in the interests of art and language learning, here goes nothing...)\n\nWith the blacks, with the sikhs, with the (gulp!) yellows (i.e. yellow skins) (god, I feel dirty!!!)\n\nChez = [at the place of/ to the place of (i.a.)]\n\nles = [the]\n\nblacks = [blacks]\n\nchez = [(see above)]\n\nles = [the]\n\nSikhs = [sikhs]\n\nchez = [(see above)]\n\nles = [the]\n\njaunes = [yellows (i.e. as in 'skin colour')/ (more politely put) oriental-asians]\n\nNOTE: I'm sure this was not intended to be a slur, France being far less politically correct than the uk, particularly in the 80. If you look to the song as whole, it is quite clearly about embracing different lands and different cultures.\n\nANECDOTE: I was once at a gathering when I stepped out for a cigarette. Whilst enjoying my 'fag' as us brits call it, someone popped their head out of a window and, in a friendly way, shouted 'hey, toi, tu fume en juif?\" I couldn't believe what I was hearing. He was basically saying I was smoking like a jew ergo smoking solo or selfishly smoking. Another thing that also shocked me was that there is only one translation availible for the english term 'ghost writer' and that word is 'nègre' [negro]. Need I draw a picture...\n\nVoyage, voyage, dans tout le royaume\n\nTravel, travel, throughout the kingdom\n\nVoyage, = [travel]\n\nvoyage = [travel]\n\ndans = [in]\n\ntout = [all]\n\nle = [the]\n\n​royaume = [kingdom]\n\nPART SIX\n\nSur les dunes du Sahara\n\nOn the dunes of the Sahara\n\nSur = [on]\n\nles = [the]\n\ndunes = [dunes]\n\ndu = [of the]\n\nSahara = [Sahara]\n\nDes îles Fidji au Fujiyama\n\nFrom (on) the Fiji islands to Fujiyama\n\nDes = [from the]\n\nîles = [islands/ iles]\n\nFidji = [Fiji]\n\nau = [to the] NOTE: obligatory contraction of à le\n\nFujiyama = [Fujiyama] Still confused? Its a mountain in Japan.\n\nVoyage, voyage, ne t'arrête pas\n\nTravel, travel, and don't you stop OR\n\nGo travel, go travel: do not stop\n\nVoyage, = [(do I bloody well have to type this again!!)]\n\nvoyage = [(see above)]\n\nne = [(negation) no/don't)\n\nt'arrête = [stop (yourself)/ to stop doing/ to give up doing/ to stop/ to give up/ to quit i.a.] 2nd person singular of the verb...\n\n... s'arrêter int the IMPERATIF\n\n(tu) arrête-toi !\n\n(nous) arrêtons-nous !\n\n(vous) arrêtez-vous !\n\nNOTE: If I'm right, it's the fact that it ne t'arrete pas is the negative of arrette-toi which causes the reflexive pronoun to change places and form.\n\npas = [not]\n\nPART SEVEN\n\n​Au-dessus des barbelés,\n\nAbove (the) barbed wires\n\nAu-dessus = [above]\n\ndes = [of the]\n\nbarbelés [barbed (as in barbed wires)]\n\ndes cœurs bombardés\n\n(are the) bombarded hearts\n\ndes = [some (or simply don't translate)]\n\ncœurs = [hearts] NOTE: this is also the same word for 'choirs' and I have no idea why.\n\n​bombardés​ = [bombarded/ bombed] Not that your really interested, but this the past participle of bombarder used as an adjective. The extra s is due to the fact that adjectives have match in sex and number with the noun they are describing. Coeurs is the plural of coeur and therfore... pff... I lost you at \"not that your really interested\" didn't I.\n\nRegarde l'océan\n\n(see above)\n\n​\n\nThen repeat of CHORUS\n\nThen repeat of PART THREE\n\nThen repeat of CHORUS\n\nThen...\n\nLa Fin\n\nKenavo, and fanks for the thish\n\nMy god, you actually did scroll down this far. As your reward, here's absolutley nothing more...\n\nBelow is the simple lyrics translation. For the French lesson based on these lyrics, see below left.\n\nPART ONE\n\n​Au-dessus des vieux volcans\n\nOver the old volcanos OR\n\nAbove old volcano's OR\n\nUp above the old volcanos\n\nGlisse tes ailes sous le tapis du vent\n\nSlide your wings under the carpet of the wind OR\n\nslip your wings under a blanket like wind\n\nVoyage, voyage, éternellement\n\nTravel, Travel, eternally OR\n\nGo and travel, go and travel, eternally OR\n\nvoyage, voyage, eternally\n\nCONTINUED BELOW\n\nPART TWO\n\nDe nuages en marécages\n\nFrom clouds to swamps OR\n\nFrom clouds to marshes/fens\n\nDe vents d'Espagne en pluies d'Équateur\n\nFrom Spanish winds to Ecuadorian rains OR\n\nFrom winds of Spain to rains of Ecuador\n\nOR IS IT...\n\n... equatorial rains\n\nVoyage, voyage, vole dans les hauteurs\n\nGo travel, go travel; fly up on high OR\n\ntravel, travel; fly in the skies OR\n\nVoyage, voyage; and fly in the open skies\n\nCONTINUED BELOW\n\nPART THREE\n\n​Au-dessus des capitales,\n\nAbove the capitals OR\n\nUp above the capital cities\n\n​des idées fatales\n\n(are) Inevitable/fated ideas OR\n\n(are) Iresistable ideas OR\n\n(are) Fatal ideas\n\nRegarde l'océan\n\nOR IS IT...\n\nRegardent l'ocean\n\nLook at the ocean OR\n\nJust see the ocean!

To rebuke those accusations I therefore present some shockingly good modern era music artists (Frenchies who still sing in French, who'd have thought..). The list is accompanied with individually playable YouTube videos so you can quickly sample and decide for yourselves.\n\nI have also written a ditty on each artist, not that anyone reads now-a-days.\n\nFREE FRENCH LESSON\n\nIntermediate-Advanced\n\nBrigitte\n\nA Bouche Que Veut-Tu\n\n(2014)\n\nIf you were to ask me who I'm mostly listening to these days my honest answer would be Brigitte. This pair of super hipster femmes fatales found success late in the game but there making up for it now. This particular track never fails to hit the sweet spot.\n\nFREE FRENCH LESSON\n\nIntermediate Level\n\nCharles Aznavour\n\nLa Bohème\n\n(1965)\n\nIf ever I'm feeling down there is always one song guaranteed to sooth my soul. This one. The song so beautifully describes the life of poor Parisian artists scraping a living together and finding comfort in each other and their own art that you'll feel like you are sharing the experience with them. Aznavour himself was born to Armenian immigrants but has attained legendary status to the point that you'll find him written within the DNA of every French man, woman and child alive.\n\nFREE FRENCH LESSON\n\nIntermediate Level\n\nCharles Trenet\n\nDouce France\n\n(1947)\n\nIt may be old but despite the age gap many of you will will be familiar with this song, particularly the melody. Hands up, I find many of the songs from this period a bit samey but a few by Charles Trenet stand out from the crowd. The reasons you should get to know this particular song yourselves are two fold. First, this song is almost a national anthem packed with nostalgia enriched images of France at it's most chocolate box period. Second, despite his idiosyncratic singing style, Trenet enunciates well so you'll be able to follow what he's singing with ease.\n\nFREE FRENCH LESSON\n\nBeginner-Intermediate Level\n\nGilbert Bécaud\n\nEt Maintenant\n\n(1961)\n\nBe prepared for pain, passion and anger... and then some. If you watch the clip I chose of Bécaud singing this song live, then you'll find it hard to believe that he hasn't just come straight from a mental asylum. However, when you start to understand the bitter words spat forth you'll come to realize his genius in capturing the feeling of utter rejection that most of us have experienced at least once in our lives.\n\nWatch the madness in the eyes...\n\nFREE FRENCH LESSON\n\nBeginner-Intermediate Level\n\nLa Godinette\n\nOR\n\nGael Lefevere +\n\nNicolas Quemener\n\nJ'étais Lassée D’être Jeune Fille\n\n(????)\n\nWhen Gael Lefevere, the guy responsible for introducing me to the real French music scene, had interpreted this traditional Breton song with fellow musician Nicolas Quemener, I remembered thinking to myself that it was possibly the most moving piece of French language music I had ever come across. Like all songs from this region of France, the lyrics are hard and biting, yet all the more interesting for it, and you'll see just how deep the Celtic roots run in listening to the original version by La Godinette, a version that I have also come to love. Now it's your turn.\n\nFREE FRENCH LESSON\n\nIntermediate Level\n\nStromea\n\nAlors On Danse\n\n(2013)\n\nThis is the song that started it all off for Stromea. I used to flick on the music channels when drinking my bowl of coffee in the mornings and when this song came out, it was on EVERY morning for what felt like a year. It became one of those songs that would play in my head all day long. Be careful, it may have the same effect on you.\n\nPs. In the lesson you'll witness how I trash almost every other translation of this song that exists!\n\nFREE FRENCH LESSON\n\nBeginner-Intermediate Level\n\nEdith Piaf\n\nJe Ne Regrette Rien\n\n(1960)\n\nProbably the only French song that the average Joe knows. Well, at least it's a good one. Emotionally charged and yet short and simple song, and hence good for beginners. No extremely metaphorical lyrics, just nice and direct, which helps.\n\nFREE FRENCH LESSON\n\nBeginner-Intermediate Level\n\nSerge Gainsbourg &\n\nJane Birkin\n\nJe T'aime...\n\nMoi Non Plus\n\n(1969)\n\nVery very naughty. The controversial French lyrical genius begat a controversial sexy French song. You all know this one so there's not much more for me to add... except, if you thought it was a tad risqué beforehand, just wait until you understand the 'ins and outs' (ha ha!/ lol) of the lyrics.\n\nFREE FRENCH LESSON\n\nBeginner-Intermediate Level\n\nClaude François\n\nComme D'habitude\n\n(1967)\n\nConfession: I hate every song this artist ever did except this one which was truly a chef d'oeuvre. After being seen on TV by a Canadian artist, the song was bought and its lyrics re-written in English once the song had been given totally different theme. The finished product was then sung by Frank Sinatra and thus was born: 'I Did It My Way'\n\nFREE FRENCH LESSON\n\nBeginner-Intermediate Level\n\nIndila\n\nDernière Danse\n\n(2014)\n\nThis was on the free to view music channels every morning for the whole of spring 2014. A hit that came out of nowhere which now has 73 million YouTube hits. Vevo wouldn't let me use the official video so I used an excellent remix in place. (burn-Vevo-burn)\n\nFREE FRENCH LESSON\n\nBeginner-Intermediate Level\n\nZaz\n\nJe Veux\n\n(2010)\n\nThis was the song that led to Zaz becoming Frances top selling artist abroad in 2010 (or was it another year?) The album from which it came (called Zaz as it happens) ranked high in the charts all over Europe (except, of course, the UK). Simple but potent lyrics whose meaning hit home with me. Plenty of slang phrases within so if you need to work on that then this is your song.\n\nFREE FRENCH LESSON\n\nIntermediate Level\n\nStromae\n\nPapaoutai\n\n(2013)\n\nRecent hit all over europe and the world (152 million YouTube Hits) by the now established king of electro-urban-geek music. This song is not the easiest of ones but has a very strong lyrical narrative, if not message (as do all his songs). Note that I've put in the phonetics for this lesson using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).\n\nFREE FRENCH LESSON\n\nIntermediate Level\n\nBenjamin Biolay\n\nTon Héritage\n\n(2009)\n\nModern Classic chanson Française. One man, one piano, one haunting tune, and a bunch of stirring lines. This one always gives me goose pimples when I hear it on the radio. The word for word translations are there but I have left it light on the grammar notes.\n\nFREE FRENCH LESSON\n\nIntermediate Level\n\nJacques Brel\n\nNe Me Quitte Pas\n\n(1959)\n\nThis song is considered by many to be the all time greatest chanson française that has ever existed. Always at the top of meta-critic polls and a personal favorite of my own (I only do songs that I like). It's an oldie (circa 1959) and yet so timeless...\n\nP.s. I have done the phonetics for this one\n\nFREE FRENCH LESSON\n\nIntermediate-Advanced Level\n\nMalicorne\n\nLe Luneux\n\n(1977?)\n\nFrom the album Almanach, this traditional French folk song reconstructed by the experimental headonism of Malicorne in the late seventies will make you shiver with delight. I'm not sure whether the melody came from another song, but who cares when it's this good. Some oldie style wording but my notes will help you understand it.\n\nFREE FRENCH LESSON\n\nIntermediate-Advanced Level\n\nOlivia Ruiz\n\nLa Femme Chocolat\n\n(2006)\n\nUnique voice, unique style of music, unique lyrics and unique looks help this artist stand far out from the often samey nouvelle scene crowd. This particular song demonstrates well her quirkiness with lyrics that are just damnright trippy.\n\nFREE FRENCH LESSON\n\nIntermediate Level\n\nSerge Lama\n\nJe Suis Malade\n\n(1973)\n\nPossibly the most melancholic song in the history of mankind... and I love it. It's all about the words dude and Mr Lama paints such a stark yet poignant picture with them that you can't help putting yourself in his boots. Get a glass of whisky, light up cigarette and think of the lovers that have hurt you... you are now ready for this lesson.\n\nDO YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO\n\nMy Spotify Playlists\n\nof French Language music\n\nNow for a musical interlude.

Once finished, and to my horror, I realized that my carefully crafted creation was rather old-fashioned and quite the bit complicated. Still, I think it's good but then again I would say that, wouldn't I.\n\nPlot twist is free, but the broken fourth wall is non-refundable."
