        "text": "Hi ya'll. My 1st time here / just signed-up / my 1st post.\n\nI have been writing lists like these for years. (Songs that have the flute featured (featured, not just there once),\n\nSongs about Native North American Indians, Movies that have waffles in them, Song/movies w/sexiest Legs, etc....!\n\nI am a lyricist & have studied German and Russian language, but French I only learned the most basic (for when I drive up to Montreal).\n\nBut I am also a music nut, and have friends that study French - so I started working on my list- then I bumped into this page / forum\n\nhere. Of course most everything on my list has been covered (isn't nice that I shan't repeat what was already written!),\n\nhere are a few (22) left over:\n\n\"Blue Angel\" (part of \"Lavender\") by Marillion. It is just one lyric of, \" 'J'entend ton coeur, J'entend ton coeur, I can hear your heart...\"\n\n(short but a beautiful song - make sure to hear \"Lavender\" (the 1st part of it) first. (\"Lavender\" is also connected to their hit song, \"Kayleigh\").\n\n\"Montreal\" by Marillion. Marillion, from England, are so welcomed in Montreal (they have their \"Marillion weekend\"s there every 2 years) that\n\nthey wrote a song for Montreal as a bit of a thank you. (A 14 minute thank you). This also does not have a lot of French in it, but thanks\n\nvarious French things as well as the one or two lyrics.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOGgbaiDvbU\n\n\" France was singing in the air of High-Rise North America /\n\nI'll go shopping for shoes or whatever ensues, Je T'aime my darling Je T'aime my darling, See you soon /\n\nin the Café of the Cirque 'Soleil, We bought easter eggs from outer space, 40 different languages are spoken in this place /\n\nThe Fleur de Lis was always kind to me, I'll make the time if ever you should call / Je T'aime my darling... \"\n\n\"Beautiful\" (or is it \"Cannibal surf babe\") by Marillion. The spoken French part by a young Woman is heard either at the end of\n\n\"Cannibal Surf Babe\" (a slightly beach boys sounding rocker) or at the beginning of the single, \"Beautiful\" (a Love song about seeing beauty\n\ninstead of looking for fault). You can find both on youtube - and I have seen singles released with both. (end of 1 song or beginning of another?).\n\nWhat is spoken in French is also spoken in English in \"Cannibal Surf Babe\".\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYBmaWSbTJA\n\nEnglish: \"And the sun came up over the mountain\n\nAnd the waves rolled in across the bay\n\nAnd the fabulous brightly colored birds\n\nFlew up out of the forest\n\nAnd she said, \"Well, we're all heaven's\n\nBeautiful children living together in paradise\n\nLie down my dear, you're going to enjoy this\"\n\nFrancais: (copy/pasted from 'freeTranslation.com' as lyrics were not available)\n\n\"Et le soleil s'est levé sur la montagne\n\net les vagues laminés en traversant la baie\n\net le fabuleux oiseaux colorés\n\na volé jusqu'hors de la forêt,\n\net elle a dit, \"Bien, nous sommes tous Heaven's\n\nbeaux enfants vivant ensemble dans le paradis\n\ns'allonger mon cher, vous allez profiter de cette \"\n\n\"Force Ten\" by Rush\n\nJust one lyric in this one:\n\n\"We can wear the rose of romance\n\nAn air of joie de vivre\" (Joy of life / memory of happiness).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBKCg25RBpQ\n\n\"Ne t'enfuis pas\" by Kate Bush (don't fly away)\n\n99% of the song is in French\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sreFD4yGVIs\n\n\"Un baiser d'enfant\" by Kate Bush (The Infant Kiss)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWSevsMRmJI\n\nGenius in France! by 'Weird Al' Yankovic\n\nThis is one of Al's longest songs. It is a homage to the Frank Zappa Band & has the flavour of \"why do the French LOVE Jerry Lewis?\"\n\n:) The French lyrics are thrown-in at simple points so the English speaking (American especially) audience will not become too confused.\n\nYou have to listen to this fun song in its entirety - but some of the French lyrics are:\n\n\"But when the Mademoiselles see me, they all swoon and shriek\n\nThey dig my mystique, they think I'm c'est magnifique\n\nWhen I'm in Paris ('Paree'), I'm the chicest of the chic---\n\nAnd when I'm sipping on a Perrier\n\nIn some cafe town in St. Tropez\n\nIt's hard to keep the fans at bay\n\nThey say, \"Sign my poodle, s'il vous plait\"\n\n\"Sign my poodle, s'il vous plait\"\n\nBut when I'm in Provence, I get free croissants\n\nYeah, I'm the guy every French lady wants\n\nThey say, \"Bonjour, Monsieur\n\nWould you take ze picture with me?\"\n\nI say, \"Oui, oui\"\n\nThat's right\n\nI say, \"Oui, oui\"\n\nLike a fine Renoir, I've got that je me c'est quoi\n\nLike a fine Renoir, I've got that je me c'est\n\nQuoi quoi quoi quoi quoi, oo we oo-\n\n-Entre nous, it's very true....\n\nEvery Frenchie that I meet\n\nJust can't wait to kiss my feet\n\nGet in line, pucker up! Tout Suite!\n\nSay, would you pass the Grey Poupon?\n\nMerci beaucoup.\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQTNBWIdLeI\n\nCeline Dion - Being a French Canadian from Quebec, and French is her 1st language, Celine has done many songs in French. One that sticks-out to me, because\n\nmost people that do not speak a word of French still like it, is, \"\n\n\"Les cloches du hameau\". (The bells of the village). I think her many sisters & brothers and other family sing with her on this. It is mostly in French with different version giving more English. http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Céline_Dion:Les_Cloches_Du_Hameau\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/French-Album-Celine-Dion/dp/B000002B45\n\n(Samples from her French album are on this page)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hez7Vv6BSuU\n\nErasure - \"Oh L'Amour\"\n\nJust this one lyric, though a very popular song-\n\n\"Oh l'amour broke my heart\n\nNow I'm aching for you, mon amour...\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjdt6pSVMKg\n\nFeist - \"L'amour ne dure pas toujours\" AND \"Tout Doucement\"\n\nLeslie Feist is a Canadian that has done a few songs in French. \"1,2,3,4...\" is her most popular as it was in a tv commercial - \"apple\" i think - that one is in English but there is also one with French in it... somewhere.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fGszse311s\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7h4xATpv6A\n\nMika - \"Grace Kelly\" As French as his 2nd of 4 languages, Mika took his most popular song and did a French version with it. He also has a version where it is half English and half French and other versions where either language lingers a little longer. He has other songs with French as well.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xuow-2cyew\n\nPink Martini - \"Je Ne Veux Pas Travailler\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lle_GA1cg20\n\nEnigma – “Sadeness part 1”\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F9DxYhqmKw\n\n“Mademoiselle” by STYX\n\n“Je t'aime Mademoiselle, ooh la la” is the only French lyric.\n\nSarah Brightman The lovely Sarah Brightman has done many songs in French (also songs in Italian, Spanish, German, Japanese, Latin, English, Arabic, Turkish, Russian, ..... - Some of the French ones, or ones including French are:\n\nFleurs du mal (Flowers of saddness) This symphonic/Hard Rock song is mostly in English with the chorus and a few bits en Francais:\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/57302198\n\n\"We run 'til it's gone\n\nEt les fleurs du mal...\n\nLes fleurs du mal unfold\n\nComme les fleurs du mal\n\nDark demons of my soul\n\nUn amour fatal\n\nBeen tryin' hard to fight\n\nComme les fleurs du mal\n\nLes fleurs du mal inside\n\nUn amour fatal\n\nWe live and we pray\n\nPour les fleurs du mal...\"\n\nOthers are:\n\nTout ce que je sais (everything that I know)\n\nGueri de toi ('something' of thee)\n\nLa Lune (of the Moon)\n\nLa Luna (the Moon)\n\nIl mio cuore va (My heart will go on)\n\nUn jour il viendra (one day he'll come)"
