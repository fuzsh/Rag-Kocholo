        "text": "When we wound up recording it at Echo Mountain in 2015, we were messing around with it, and for some reason, we did a really long intro and a really long outro, and it increased the mood of the thing. We thought it would be cool if we faded it in like the way “Low Spark” fades in on the Traffic record and then fades out again, like something that just passed you by in the fog—you saw it while you saw it, and then it disappeared into the mist again. And I thought, “These are two very unique, original songs—let’s make them into one long chunk.”\n\nhouses would have conferences and songwriters would just parade through.\n\nA few years ago, my dad got this group of two other older dudes from the scene and started performing. I got the chance to finally sit down and play with him and this was one of the songs he showed me. I said, “What’s the story on this song?” And he told me that a friend of his had reminded him about it and then he went and sort of reworked it. I went down to LA and recorded the three of them playing it— you can find it on YouTube.\n\nSo we copped his arrangement and started playing it a couple of years ago live, but we didn’t really know what to do with it. It didn’t seem to have a home yet. I knew that the words would have some impact, and I knew they would resonate with John Bell. And I knew he would deliver them beautifully—it was a matter of intent, a shared group intent that would frame the song properly.\n\nOnce we started playing it with Duane, we slowed it down and made it guttural and grungy. What Duane brought [to the studio], beyond his enthusiasm, which is great and always welcomed, was he is really cool with sensing the vibe of something. And once we kicked it down a notch or two, tempowise, it opened up and the intent arrived. Duane likes that kind of stuff. He can play slow and build in dynamics so that it doesn’t ever drag, but also so it doesn’t race up against the front end of the beat, and that’s what’s required on a song like this.\n\nI suggested updating the words from “Nam” to “Iraq” because the song is just about a guy that can’t help but fuck up his life, and the Honky Red that he drinks adds a lot to it. I think it’s an extraordinarily successful studio song for us, and Murray McLauchlan would say, “OK, I never envisioned my song being framed this way, but it works.”\n\nsome references to a restless head not being able to go to sleep but the comfort of the angels nearby—they’re present whether you know it or not—help smooth out those moments. The music is very insistent in the beginning and then moves to a shuffle, which has a little less intensity but a little more lightheartedness. Then it goes to a drifting back-and- forth waltz, swaying feeling and finishes out. It lends itself to that feeling of mayhem before chilling out."
