        "text": "You’re vibing to a slow tune with an iridescent filter, when suddenly, the beat drops and methodological rhythms with a French rapper going off follow. The rap genre is exploding in France at the moment, and it’s no surprise why. In the last few years, French rap has become like caviar: the lyrics, beats and sound are a unique mix that can only be explained as a musical reflection of the French youth. Le Rap Français mixes pop production, Afrobeats, trap, and cloud rap to produce a smooth flow, and lyrics in the sweet language of love make the bars sound even better than those of its English-speaking counterparts. The influence of American New Wave rap on the style and lyricism exhibits how different cultures can identify with certain aspects of hip-hop to create something totally new and exciting. This revolution is sending French rap upwards on a universal trajectory.\n\nFrance’s rap style stems from its youths dominating the hip-hop scene, most of whom are all children of immigrants from Africa. Colonization spread the French language to countries like the Congo, where French is still recognized as a national language. This history of Francophone countries in Africa and Europe has led many to seek refuge in France and Belgium. France’s community of African descent is vibrant, and the children of those immigrants are using their culture to create a new, revolutionary style. This meshing of cultures is where the sounds of the new style stem from. Its infectious beats that make you want to dance are derived from the West African Afrobeats genre, while the flow of the French language is the essence of this genre’s uniqueness. Cultural clashes in these countries have also caused tension — tension that is released through music — and the evolution of the rap genre in France has created a movement in which immigrant voices are being heard worldwide.\n\nThis musical movement began in 2017, when young Parisian rapper Niska released a song that single-handedly shook the French rap world and changed it forever. With his single “Reseaux,” the newcomer gained icon status. The catchy beat and memorable lyrics take from American rap styles — the song opens up with a “skrrrt” before the rapper puts his own spin on Migos-style ad-libs with the French slang word “pouloulou.” His music has the trademark Afro-trap rap elements, such as drumkit polyrhythms that make French rap so distinguishable, while his husky, Parisian accent allows his lyrics to flow well with them. The young rapper’s style is raw and intense, transporting his listeners to the cold suburbs of Paris where everyone’s donning Adidas and has a cigarette in hand. Niska was born in one of these Parisian suburbs to Congolese parents and has collaborated with Damso, Kaaris, and Ninho, other French rappers whose families also immigrated from West Africa.\n\nDespite language barriers, French rappers have lyrically taken a lot from new American rap styles. Artists like Travis Scott, Migos, and A$AP Ferg have gritty lyrics that resemble Niska’s vibe. This can be heard on A$AP Ferg and MadeinTYO’s collab, “WAM,” a bop with bounce and ad-libs just like Niska’s. “WAM” is explicit, and while “Reseaux” by Niska isn’t as raunchy, the lyricism is similar:\n\nBalle dans la tête, tu t'retrouves à terre (tiens)\n\nJe ferme pas ma gueule, mais qu'est-ce tu vas faire? (squa)\n\n[Bullet in the head, you fall down\n\nI won't shut up, what are you gonna do?]\n\nWhen translated to English, Niska sounds like any American rapper flexing their guns and complaining about how everyone’s “all talk, no walk.” A line in “WAM” sounds similar: “I'ma kill all you rappers / I'ma aim with precision (Damn).” This similarity could explain the popularity of his music, as he has arguably created the French counterpart to popular American rap. His cultural struggles are different from American ones, but strife is strife, and it's relatable nonetheless.\n\nDamso, a Belgian rapper from the Congo, has also been dominating the French rap scene. The suave lyricist has been creating music since he moved to Brussels and released his first solo album, Batterie Fallible, in 2017. His style is smoother than Niska’s, as it reflects the cooler, softer “Brusselois” style that many Brussels-based singers use in their music. The unhurried, defined beats in his music contrast Niska’s fast-paced, loud production style. Inspired by his Congolese heritage, Damso sings about the conflicts he faced throughout his life in his home country, as well the friction he faces as an immigrant. Much of his lyrics discuss local social strife in his country and in France. In songs like “BruxellesVie” and “Dieu ne ment jamais,” Damso discusses the conflicts among the immigrant population and French society, reflecting on his feelings about them.\n\nAs one of the most successful Belgian rappers of all time, he has worked with almost every notable French rapper in his generation, including Dadju and Orelsan. With his most recent album, “QALF” (which stands for “Qui Aime Like Follow”), he has perfected his signature blend of chill, low vocals that hum over his playful beats. Just like his music, all of Damso’s collaborations are melodious masterpieces. In 2017, he collaborated with Kalash, a French rapper from Martinique, on the single “Mwaka Moon.” The song topped the French singles chart, peaking at number two and remaining in the Top 10 for nine consecutive weeks. Kalash’s Caribbean style fused well with Damso’s catchy rhythms, creating a feel-good record perfect to listen to on a train to Brussels. Straying from less serious topics, Damso raps about Amsterdam weed, money and women:\n\nUne bouffée d'oxygène dans la kush (yaw yaw yaw)\n\nDans le vide je respire à peine, le succès m'a donné des ailes\n\nLa même b-tch qui me tournait le dos m'a en photo dans l'appareil\n\n[A breath of fresh air in the kush (yaw yaw yaw)\n\nIn the void I barely breathe, success gave me wings\n\nThe same b-tch who had her back to me took a picture of me in the camera]\n\nWith its dreamy, ethereal beats, Damso’s music can be categorized as cloud rap. However, he incorporates rhythmic African drums with atmospheric sounds similar to the ones used by popular American rappers like Drake or A$AP Rocky. Despite adding his own flair, the Brussels native’s music retains its polished French coolness.\n\nBefore this generation, French rappers followed their American counterparts closely but lacked their own twist on the genre. A younger generation of rappers has taken the struggles of French culture to create a fresh, exciting sound. The children of immigrants are heading this revolution, bringing together the French and Belgian youth through eloquent art. “Le Rap Français” is a reflection of the new youth culture in the big French cities, but looking deep into its history uncovers the intertwining relationship that American rap has with other countries. With a mixture of immigrant stories, cultural fusions, and new exploration, French rap is the loud voice that perfectly reflects the emotions of the newer generations."
