It often moves around a lot, for example to play very low notes.\n\nThe hands move around a lot.\n\nNumber of years of piano playing: about 5+ years Expert Level The right hand often plays in octaves and even chords. Some sequences require very good technical and physical dexterity.\n\nThe left hand develops very extensive arpeggios and rhythmic formulas, sometimes very elaborate, even at a high tempo.\n\nThe hands make significant movements, for example to alternate notes in different keys.\n\nNumber of years of piano playing: approximately 6-10 years. Very good conservatory level.\n\nDo you need more information? Contact us!\n\nIf you wish to have your sheet music in another key, we can offer this transposition service specifically for you.\n\nAll you have to do is buy the score as it appears on our website, then go to your account to see which transpositions are already available.\n\nIf the transposition you want is not listed, you can send us your request directly from your account.\n\nWe will then transpose the score for you, make it available in your account and notify you by email.\n\nSome websites allow you to transpose your sheet music yourself but we prefer to proceed differently, for two reasons:\n\nAs our music sheets have fingering to make it easier for you to play, this becomes invalid if you change key and often interferes with the legibility of the notes that have been transposed.\n\nAs our arrangements are the result of meticulous work to make them sound as good as possible, we wish to have control over the chosen key, as transposing into keys that are too far apart would make the arrangement too low or too high, to the detriment of the musical quality. We will work with you to ensure that the desired key is not too far off so that the arrangement will still sound great."
