Oh such fond memories!\n\nJAMAIS Vu went on to win—not 1–but 2 #1 Cigar of the Year Awards!\n\nFor you true cigar nerds out there...you might remember the Jamais VU was originally called \"Inception\". Honestly, the name doesn't matter...because no matter what you call it, it will rock your face off.\n\nFull-bodied. Med/Full strength. Wrapper is a 12-year-aged Corojo rosado leaf. Fillers are all Nicaraguan and feature the illustrious Medio Tiempo!\n\nExpect flavors of dark chocolate, cedar wood, heavy cream, dark leather, brown sugar, cloves, cinnamon stick, vanilla, black peppercorn, graham crackers, and caramel.\n\nYa...kinda the best cigar ever IMO."
