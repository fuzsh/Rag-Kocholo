        "text": "So this is a lyric from a song:\n\nTombent les nuits à la lueurs de bougies qui fondent\n\nEt que la lumière soit\n\nPassent les heures que s'écoulent à jamais les secondes\n\nEt que la lumière soit\n\n[...]\n\nI couldn't figure out what this \"que\" in \"Passent les heures que s'écoulent à jamais les secondes\" is doing, is it a pronom or a conjonction? Is it correct to translate it into something like: \"the hours and the seconds who're fleeing for ever, pass\"? Most likely I am wrong. Thanks for helping\n\nI believe that \"Passent les heures\" and \"que s'écoulent à jamais les secondes\" express indirect commands. \"Let the hours pass\" and \"Let the seconds go by forever\".\n\nThese sentences use the subjunctive to express indirect commands or exhortations. Other well-known examples in French would be \"Vive le roi\" and \"Que Dieu vous bénisse.\"\n\nthank you atcheque for helping, here's another verse that goes pretty much the same, I don't think that \"passent\" is meant to be subjunctive, but my French is rather basic, so I'm not sure...\n\nTombent les feuilles et les larmes sur tes joues qui roulent\n\nEt que la lumière soit\n\nPassent les anges et les orages au dessus des foules\n\nEt que la lumière soit\n\nHello snoosnoo,\n\nYou don't necessarily need the que to express this idea. I think the it can be considered to be implied, as in \"Vive le roi\". In this song, there are several examples of this usage with and without the que. Even \"Tombent les nuits....\" is an example.\n\nThey are considered to be indirect commands. The author is not speaking directly to the hours and saying \"Pass, hours!\", or to the seconds saying \"Go by, seconds!\", etc. throughout the song. The ideas expressed are \"May/Let the hours pass\", \"May/Let the seconds go by\", etc.\n\nHi,\n\nI agree with Marget, the two clauses are independant, not linked with que. On the other hand, I take the first one (\"Passent les heures\") to be an affirmative sentence with a poetic inversion: to me, it means the same as Les heures passent. It reminds me a lot of Jean-Jacques Goldman's song Tournent les violons.\n\nThe second one is definitely an indirect command, as pointed out by Marget.\n\nI hope I haven't confused you, snoosnoo. Oddmania's suggestion of poetic inversion is perfect. The clauses that begin without que can be translated as declarative statements using the indicative mood.\n\nOther examples of poetic inversion might be found in Guillaume Apollinaire's poem Le Pont Mirabeau: \"Sous le Pont Mirabeau coule la Seine...\"\n\nhi Oddmania,\n\nthe language is very hard to grasp indeed! I incline to think the first one is (les heures passent), as all the other inversions in this song, I'm still having difficulty understanding the (que les second s'écoulent) as in an impressive sentence, by any chance it could be understood as: the hours of which it's seconds are flying and never to return, pass? that is, \"que\" as a \"dont\"? that would make things so much easier for my poor brain )\n\nhi marget, I guess this confused state is an inevitable one for a new learner, hopefully not too long an one. I'm OK with all the other verbs, but my head is still hopelessly turning over on that (que les seconds s'écoulent)...\n\nIf you consider \"Passent les heures\" as one verse and then put \"Que s'écoulent à jamais les secondes\" on a separate line, I think you'll understand it better.\n\nPassent les heures (The hours pass)\n\nQue s'écoulent à jamais les secondes (May the seconds go by ...)\n\n\"Que s'écoulent ....\" is an example of the same structure as \"Et que la lumière soit.\"\n\nIt seems that the author is following a pattern of respecting a certain number of syllables in each verse, which explains why \"que s'écoulent:...\" is part of the third verse.\n\nthank you marget, i am still having difficulty to take this que as a subjunctive precursor, but I guess I'll understand better when I have studied further, after all lyrics and poems are fickle and tricky for language learners, so I'll just commit this sentence into my brain and come back to it later.\n\nand thanks for all the help, this is a wonderful forum!"
