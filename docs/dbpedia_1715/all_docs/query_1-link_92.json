        "text": "Lacuzon, yes clearer. By imagining it as replacing pas, it makes it easier. However, to be picky, why doesn't ne + pas become a double negative? (I've done french for 5 years up to GCSE level, but the question only just occured, because of the introduction of negatives such as ne...jamais etc.)\n\nHow can ne + anything remain a single negative? My question seems awkward because of the fact that informally the ne is often omitted (native French, i assume correctly, no?) and the ne itself can often be sufficient to present a negative.\n\nSo both ne and pas can do the job alone. Then why together do they not cancel each other out?\n\nThanks Lacuzon\n\nHistorically, the \"ne\" was the only negative. \"Personne\" used to mean \"a person/anybody.\" \"Rien\" (from the Latin \"res\") used to mean \"a thing/anything.\" \"Jamais\" still means \"ever.\" French speakers could drop the \"pas\" but not the \"ne\" in a \"ne... pas\" construction.\n\nBut then semantically the emphasis of the negation shifted away from the \"ne\" and towards all the things that used to be associated with it. So \"rien\" came to mean \"nothing\" and \"personne\" \"nobody.\"\n\nFrench speakers don't view these as \"double negations\" since the \"ne\" now only serves to introduce negations - it can't (well, it can, but rarely) negate sentences by itself. And, yes, French stacks negatives in really weird ways: \"Personne n'a rien vu\" doesn't mean \"Nobody saw nothing = Everybody saw something\" but instead \"Nobody saw anything.\" This is because the negatives are fundamentally ambivalent in a fun, strange way. Basically in French, once you start negating you're building a single negative.\n\nIf you really want to make a double negative, you have to work pretty hard, and it sounds bad: \"Je ne suggère absolument pas qu'on ne fasse pas ce projet.\""
