        "text": "Track 06 on MOTS: Persona album and Track 04 on MOTS: 7 album.\n\nWritten by:\n\nMarcus McCoan, Owen Roberts, Matty Thomson, Max Lynedoch Graham, Camilla Anne Stewart, RM, j-hope, Hitman Bang\n\nI’ve always liked this song, especially its lyrics. The game metaphor that runs throughout the song was really nice. It’s strange that games resemble real life so much – you overcome one level of struggles and then another harder level appears. And you repeat…\n\nIn addition, now I have a new appreciation for this song after listening to the Map of the Soul: 7 album, especially the song “Black Swan.” Both songs talk about the heart no longer beating, and the overlap of the imagery is only a little bit, but enough to give the album a feeling of cohesive continuation. It’s also interesting that the two songs deal with this idea very differently.\n\nI seem to have lost again\n\nYou seem to be angry\n\nFlickering “Game over over over”\n\nThe fact that the first line says “I seem to have lost again” and not simple “I seem to have lost” is interesting. It implies repeated failures to meet expectations and gives feeling of “I’m always causing disappointment.”\n\nIf this were a game\n\nI would just have to “load” again, but\n\nI guess I gotta deal with this, deal with this\n\nReal World\n\nIt would be nice it it were a game\n\nBecause it hurts so much\n\nI need to heal my medic\n\nBut I’m another star\n\nIt hurts so much, so you need the Medic to heal you, but even the Medic needs healing first. So you need to heal the medic first, but you can’t… Sounds so defeated and hopeless.\n\nMedic is a character in the game StarCraft. I like that they used a gaming term (out of many terms for medical personnel) to add to the gaming imagery.\n\nNot exactly sure what “But I’m another star” means…. I wonder if it’s a StarCraft related thing. I’m assuming it’s “I’m a star/celeb” mixed with some kind of StarCraft imagery, but I’m not a gamer, so I don’t know.\n\nBlame me who couldn’t be perfect\n\nOR: Blame me who couldn’t be whole\n\nBrake in my head, brake in my step, always\n\nI think the “brake” is used as both “break (broken)” and “brake (stop).” eg.\n\nCouldn’t be whole because of the breaks in the head, breaks in the steps. (eg. broken)\n\nCouldn’t be a perfect (performer) because of brakes in the head and steps (eg. stopped), so couldn’t go on and perform.\n\nI just wanted to do well\n\nAnd I wanted to make you smile… damn\n\nPlease give me a remedy\n\nA remedy that will make my stopped heart beat again\n\nThis part reminds me of “Black Swan,” which follows just a few songs later in the album.\n\nHere, they’re still asking someone else what to do, and sounds like they haven’t come to terms with it yet.\n\nWhat am I to do now?\n\nPlease save me, give me another chance\n\nPlease give me a\n\nA remedy, a melody\n\nThat memory that only I will remember\n\nIf I give up at this point\n\nIf I turn it off, will I be able to rest in peace?\n\nThis part, I kind of did an adaptation in above section, rather than a literal translation. Literally, it’s more like:\n\nA remedy, a melody\n\nThat memory that will only be left to me\n\nIf I stop at this point\n\nIf I turn it off, will it all become more comfortable?\n\nIt sounds so desolate in Korean. Like a memory is something that you share but you’re the only one who remembers it and it’s really lonely.\n\nThe obvious metaphor is turning off the game and stopping. And subtly, there’s is suggestion of death as metaphor for giving up. It’s more subtle here than in “Black Swan,” where they talk about how losing artistic passion is the first death for an artist.\n\nThe lines ask whether you’ll be able to rest in peace if you succumb to this and give up. The Korean phrase, “become more comfortable” is used similarly to “rest in peace” in English. However, this is not used as exclusively in people dying, and can just mean the person simply wants some peace. It works well as a metaphor that sounds weary but not necessarily too depressing.\n\nEarlier, the song indicated that the protagonist is hurt and needs a medic, but the medic needs healing too. And then the song states he needs a remedy that will make his stopped heart beat again. But then says maybe just giving up will allow him to rest in peace. So the song has a progression of being hurt, wanting to be treated, but wondering if they should just give up/whether dying will give them peace.\n\nBefore the MOT:7 was released, I thought this was about being a celebrity with fame. You’re always in spotlight, there’s one challenge after another, and if you make a mistake, it’s very hard to to go back and try again. It’s so easy to feel like you’re repeatedly disappointing people. The “medic” (who could be fans or reaching goals in your career, or whatever else that used to give you energy) can no longer heal you because you’re so broken. And the only way to be peaceful is to give up on that fame.\n\nBut now, I think the song can also be seen as not being able to feel good enough about their artistry and feeling repeated self-disappointment. And I think “medic” can be music too, which has healed them in past. But the music itself has become unwell. And if you’re in a slump, repeatedly struggling to overcome it, sometimes you wander if giving it all up and accepting defeat will give you peace.\n\nIt’s really interesting. As a part of the album MOTS: Persona, the song deals with struggles as a celebrity with public persona. But the same song can deal with struggles with your inner shadows when you listen to it as part of MOTS: 7 album.\n\nIt’s alright, but it’s not alright\n\nI’ve told myself that I’m used to this\n\nBut it always hurts like first time.\n\nA gamer that’s not good enough,\n\nRight, I can’t control “me”\n\nWhere “me” is a game character, if the real life were a “game”\n\nIt keeps hurting, ’cause of trial and error, and tens of thousands\n\n..this part doesn’t say what tens of thousands specifically (whether it applies to trial and errors, the lyrics, words, etc)\n\nMy lyrics, each of my gestures\n\nEach of my words, all become frightening in my feeling of jamais vu\n\nAnd I try to run away again\n\nBut catch me, you still do\n\nEven if my shadows get bigger, my life and you are equal sign\n\nSo my remedy is your remedy\n\nPlease give me a remedy\n\nA remedy that will make my stopped heart beat again\n\nWhat am I to do now?\n\nPlease save me, give me another chance\n\nPlease give me a\n\n(Remedy)\n\nRun again, Fall again\n\n(Honestly)\n\nEven if it repeats endlessly\n\nI’m going to run again\n\nSo give me a remedy\n\nA remedy that will make my stopped heart beat again\n\nWhat am I to do now?\n\nPlease save me, give me another chance\n\nPlease give me a remedy\n\n(Is it a success? Came back)\n\nA remedy that will make my stopped heart beat again\n\n(I’ll focus and I’ll reach you no matter what. Crashing and falling)\n\nWhat am I to do now?\n\n(The familiar pain covers me the same)\n\nPlease save me\n\n(It’s not easy this time either)\n\nGive me another chance\n\n(Will I give up? No, no never)\n\nI won’t give up.\n\nThe parts in brackets are sung/spoken very softly in the background. I like it that they were so soft and subtle, because if they were louder, I think it would have been too much of a sudden change in the song. But even a song that seemed so defeated like this, they like to put the hint of struggle back up. BTS sad songs are never all sad (and happy songs are not all happy), and that’s why I like BTS songs."
