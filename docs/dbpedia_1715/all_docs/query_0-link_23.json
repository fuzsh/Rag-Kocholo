        "text": "Audio transcription :\n\nHello, I hope you're well and that you had a very good week.\n\nToday we're meeting for a listening comprehension video on the most famous song of Aya Nakamura who is the most listened to French singer on Spotify in the world.\n\nI'm sure you've probably already listened to one of her songs and surely you didn't understand everything. To be honest, for some French speakers the lyrics are not easy to understand because there is a lot of French and non-French slang so for you who are learning French I can't even imagine.\n\nSo I thought of you and I thought I would help you understand the song Djadja by Aya Nakamura.\n\nHere we go!\n\nJ'entends des bails atroces sur moi\n\nIn common parlance, we talk about \"bails\" to designate things, things without really naming them. In fact, she says she hears terrible things about her.\n\nMais Ã§a va pas mais t'es tarÃ© ouais\n\nHere there is a lot of oral language and language tics and for the word \"tarÃ©\" which may be unknown to you, it is a familiar way of referring to someone who is crazy.\n\nMais comment Ã§a le monde est ti-pe\n\nThe verlan for recall is a type of slang used especially by young people and consists of inverting the syllables of a word.\n\nFor example : meuf is the verlan of femme.\n\nTu croyais quoi? qu'on s'verra plus jamais. J'pourrais t'afficher mais c'est pas mon dÃ©lire\n\nSeveral things here. The first: J'pourrais t'afficher\n\nAfficher quelqu'un. What does that mean? Afficher quelqu'un is to show someone's true personality to the public. For example, she's talking about someone who lied to her and she's saying \"J'pourrais t'afficher\", that is, I could show everyone how you really are because I know how you really are.\n\nThe second thing: Ce n'est pas mon dÃ©lire is an expression to say \"it's not my thing\"; \"it's not my kind of thing\"; \"it's not me\"; \"it's not something I would do\".\n\nOne of the things that you often say to me and that is very difficult to understand French is this.\n\nIn France, we like to eat so much that we even eat the words! It's true that we do it a lot orally and it can be more complicated to understand what someone says. How can you understand?\n\nNo secret, you have to get your ear used to it and listen to a lot of content in French. Be careful, you have to listen to authentic French.\n\nOh Djadja y'a pas moyen ah Djadja\n\nDjadja : According to the singer: It's a guy, a man who will tell lies about a girl. A djadja is a liar.\n\nY a pas moyen : is an expression to say: it is not possible. In English, it sounds like: No way.\n\nJ'suis pas ta catin ah Djadja\n\nSo, une catin is a very vulgar word that designates a woman who offers her body to men in exchange for money. I'm trying to explain this in a correct way. She actually means that she is not submissive, that she is not at the disposal of this man.\n\nGenre en catchana baby tu dead Ã§a\n\nIn catchana, basically nobody really understood what it was until the singer herself explained what it meant. I'll let you watch her explanation.\n\nJ'suis pas ta daronne j'te fais pas la moral\n\nHere, the words \"daronne\" and \"daron\" are a familiar way of calling one's parents.\n\nSo, a daronne is a mother.\n\nAnd a daron is a daddy.\n\nTu parles sur moi, y a R, Craches encore, y a R\n\nSo here are two things.\n\nThere is R. It is the letter \"r\", it is the abbreviation of \"nothing\". When we say \"You talk about me there is R\", it means \"You talk about me there is nothing\". So, you talk about me, but there is nothing to say about me. So what you're actually saying is just talk.\n\nCracher sur quelqu'un = In English, it's \"to spit\". And when you use it in that sense, when someone spits on someone else, it's not in the literal sense. Cracher actually means here, to criticize someone through words.\n\nLe jour oÃ¹ on se croise, faut pas tchouffer\n\nSo, the term \"tchouffer\". Even I didn't know what it meant and I had to do a little research to find the definition of this word. Tchouffer is a nouchi term which is a form of slang found in Ivory Coast. Tchouffer means to miss everything, to spoil everything. So, the day we meet, don't ruin everything, behave yourself.\n\nI hope you liked this video and that everything will be clearer when you listen to the song Djadja by Aka Nakamura.\n\nTo be sure that you have understood my explanations, I want you to tell me, as a comment, what this song is about, what is the story, what is the message that Aya Nakamura tells in this song. Here we go, put that in commentary and it allows you to work a little on your written expression.\n\nDon't forget to subscribe and put a \"I like\", it's always a pleasure. See you soon for new adventures in French of course! ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·"
