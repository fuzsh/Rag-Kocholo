        "text": "On aura toujours rendez-vous\n\nWelcome to Jamais Plus, a one page shrine dedicated to the French musical adaptation of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s novella Le Petit Prince (The Little Prince) from 2002, created as part of Amassment’s One Page, One Month: ENCORE Marathon.\n\nThis shrine offers an in-depth look into one of numerous musical interpretations of Le Petit Prince and assumes that you are already familiar with the work itself — if you aren’t, I urge you to go on that brief, but profound journey. The musical has been fully uploaded to YouTube, with English subtitles provided by roughdiamond5. Whether DVDs of the musical can still be acquired from primary sources I do not know, though Amazon seems to have some in stock depending on where you live (prices may vary drastically), but the soundtrack is available for purchase on the iTunes Store.\n\nOn this shrine, I outline the different stages of the prince’s journey, describe how each song is embedded and comment on the musical’s execution and its unique qualities; included are excerpts of the lyrics of some of my favourite songs along with my own English translations. Clicking on icons takes you to the part of the musical where the respective musical number starts playing (within the YouTube playlist linked above), icons lead to the full lyrics on frmusique.ru, and icons mark my favourites. [Square brackets] in the English translations are additional literal translations because I am obnoxious when it comes to each language’s subtleties. English terms and passages used to refer to the novella (such as the designations of the persons the little prince meets on his journey, or song titles and lines based on specific lines of the novella) are taken from Katherine Woods’ published translation.\n\nThe site is intended to be viewed at a minimum resolution of 1024x768.\n\nIf there are any thoughts you’d like to share, I’d be delighted about any feedback in my guestbook. Thanks a lot for your visit! ❤\n\nlast update: June 2022\n\nIntroduction\n\nCreators\n\nComponist: Riccardo (Richard) Cocciante\n\nSongwriter: Elisabeth Anaïs\n\nDirector: Jean-Louis Martinoty\n\nProducer: Victor Bosch/NODO Productions\n\nCostume Designer: Jean-Charles de Castelbajac\n\nSet Designer: Hans Shavernoch\n\nLighting Designer: Jean Kalman Performers\n\nThe Pilot: Daniel Lavoie\n\nThe Little Prince: Jeff\n\nThe Rose: Cathialine Andria\n\nThe King: Stéphane Neville\n\nThe Conceited Man: Laurent Ban\n\nThe Tippler: Gérard Nicaud\n\nThe Businessman: Sébastien Izambard\n\nThe Lamplighter: Thomas Gérome\n\nThe Geographer: Christophe Cerino\n\nThe Fox: Romain Cortèse\n\nThe Railway Switchman: Nicolas Saje\n\nThe Pill Merchant: Désir Bastareaud\n\nThe Snake: Sylvaine Charrier\n\nThe musical premiered in October 2002 at the Casino de Paris (a performance venue, not a casino), where it ran until January 2003. I discovered it by chance in June 2013, when a link led me to the song C’est un chapeau! , a song I immediately fell in love with and that unexpectedly became one of my favourites on the soundtrack. When I looked for more tracks on YouTube, believing the song to be part of a tribute disc, it surprised me to find out that it was part of an entire musical. I was skeptical at first, not quite sure whether I ought to watch it in its entirety. As I have read the novella many, many times in three languages and hold it very dear (not just its story or messages, but also its syntax, its pacing, single lines — and you know how adaptations usually omit a fair amount of lines, all the more so when the original is narrated from a first person perspective), I thought that no visualization could possibly do it justice, what with its hauntingly lonely mood, its melancholic, thought-provoking journey and the quiet, reserved dialogues that pass judgement nevertheless.\n\nThough I cannot evaluate the musical in relation to other musicals (I’m only familiar with Sera Myu, and the only musical I’ve ever experienced live is Mamma Mia! because it was a school event), I must say that this one filled me with awe due to the creative capacity and dedication of its creators and contributors — it’s plainly visible how much love went into this and how much they wanted it to stay true to the original work. The way they try to preserve and integrate as many lines of the novella as possible is something you notice from the beginning: Its first musical number is Dédicace , which, as you may have guessed, is the adaptation of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s actual dedication in Le Petit Prince (one with thematic ties to the novella’s story).\n\nThe stage, the costumes, the lyrics, the singing, the acting — they’re all very beautiful and fitting, but I can’t cease being amazed at how accurately the performers portray the figures of the novella, especially the little prince himself. He may initially be a difficult character to grasp (his nuances and his manner of speech), but Jeff manages to capture his essence perfectly: There’s a certain fragility to him, an awareness for the values that are truly important in spite of — or due to — his naïveté, his innocence; there’s the sensitivity he has gained in the course of his journey, the tenderness with which he holds the abandoned rose in his thoughts. You need to see the stage design for yourself (well, in the video) to understand how beautiful it is: the backdrop featuring space, the ever-changing lighting, the various planets that the prince visits, each with their own peculiarities…\n\nThe musical touched me so deeply that I immediately rewatched various scenes over and over (during a finals period! some songs are so very comforting ❤), to the point of memorizing gestures, facial expressions and pauses because they go so well with the respective scenes. Whether or not you know French, I do recommend having a look, even if it’s only a select few songs singled out further below.\n\nLes Chansons\n\nAct I\n\nDédicace / Dedication\n\nC’est un chapeau! / It’s a hat!\n\nDroit devant soi / Straight ahead of you\n\nLes grandes personnes sont comme ça / Grown-ups are like that\n\nLes baobabs / The baobabs\n\nPrès d’elle / Near her\n\nLa rose / The rose\n\nAdieu (et tâche d’être heureux) / Farewell (and try to be happy)\n\nJe t’ordonne / I command you\n\nMoi, je / [Me,] I\n\nJe bois pour oublier / I drink to forget\n\nJe suis un homme sérieux / I am a serious man\n\nC’est la consigne / That’s the instruction\n\nJe prends note / I take note\n\nLa terre / The Earth Act II\n\nEphémères / Ephemeral\n\nLe serpent / The snake\n\nL’echo / The echo\n\nLe jardin des roses / The garden of roses\n\nApprivoise-moi / Tame me\n\nPuisque c’est ma rose / Because it is my rose\n\nL’aiguilleur / The railway switchman\n\nChercher la source / Looking for the well\n\nOn aura toujours rendez-vous / We will always meet\n\nLe plus beau et le plus triste paysage du monde / The loveliest [most beautiful] and saddest landscape in the world\n\nMany of these songs incorporate a good amount of rhymes (something you’ll notice when reading the lyrics below). ❤ Spoken scenes and ambient pieces aside, the musical comprises twenty-four songs, not counting La rose , which is curiously not listed on the back cover of the DVD case; perhaps it’s not considered a full song due to the constant interruption of spoken parts and because it gradually dies off due to the dialogue that takes place while it plays. On the other hand, Le serpent is listed even though it’s an instrumental piece — perhaps because each figure has a defining piece, with this one being the snake’s, and the rose’s isn’t actually La rose, but Adieu (et tâche d’être heureux) , which is sung without interruptions?\n\nIf you’d like to gauge whether the musical might be of interest to you, here’s a list of my favourite and recommended songs: C’est un chapeau! , Près d’elle , La rose , Adieu (et tâche d’être heureux) ,\n\nLe jardin des roses , Apprivoise-moi , Puisque c’est ma rose ,\n\nLe plus beau et le plus triste paysage du monde\n\nClick on the headings below for a comprehensive breakdown of the musical, specific musical numbers and their execution.\n\nLe Desert\n\nL’Asteroid B-612\n\nLe Voyage\n\nLa Terre\n\nL’Adieu\n\nEn Coulisses\n\nBonus material for the musical include a Making Of video as well as two music videos; you can watch them here, although there are no subtitles for the Making Of video (the music videos feature Puisque c’est ma rose and On aura toujours rendez-vous respectively, which are fully translated in the musical playlist). I appreciate it just as much as the musical itself, so I do recommend watching it — perhaps not in full if you don’t understand French (I can’t catch all of it either), but I’ll point out my observations below.\n\nThe Making Of video is edited in a way that allows you to relive the entire story; its music and clips are well-placed as the commentary is interlaced with corresponding tracks of the musical that fade in and out. The transition from space to the scenes that take place on Earth is particularly beautiful. It’s also very fun to watch because you get to see the performers close-up in different roles and without make-up (I like the performer who plays the rose better in the video than in the musical itself; perhaps the stage make-up is just too dramatic), and you get to see how well some of them get along. There are also some things you don’t get to see in the musical itself, such as the girl who plays the snake, or how everyone plays around with the Bilboquet, or the fox unmasked (WHO IS REALLY HANDSOME).\n\nAbove all, however, it’s insightful. Each performer/character has an individual feature in the clip, showing how they act out their role and train both their acting and singing so as to best convey the respective scene, repeatedly rehearsing the same scene differently; all the while, the composer gives a rundown on the songs and talks about the impressions he wanted to convey so that each piece has its own symbolism. You also hear the thoughts behind the directing and the creation of stage props and the costumes. The performer of the little prince also points out an interesting detail: The first encounter between the prince and the pilot is an application of the fox’ teachings, something that only exists in this form in the musical version due to the visual element. The fox taught the prince about the importance of rites and gradually closing the physical distance (rather than all at once), which is what we see when the little prince approaches the pilot hesitantly when asking him to draw a sheep.\n\nOne of the two music videos at the end is an edited clip that is a visual summary of the musical, whereas the other doesn’t take place on stage and instead features a scene in the desert between the pilot and the prince as they spend time together and walk hand in hand. It’s not clear whether it’s supposed to take place during the story or whether it’s an alternate ending altogether, though I do believe it to be the latter as there’s no sign of an airplane crash. I like to think of it as an alternate future where the two of them are able to meet again.\n\nLe Site\n\nThis shrine was created in September 2015. A documentation of its creation process can be found at Song Cradle, the network’s repository.\n\nJe ne t’oublierai jamais plus is a line from On aura toujours rendez-vous , the last duet between the narrator and the prince, and means I will never ever forget you. Jamais plus on its own can mean both never again (nevermore) as well as never ever. This fits the note on which the novella and the musical conclude — from the narrator’s and from the reader’s/viewer’s perspective considering how the story ends, but also considering what important messages Le Petit Prince conveys. The narrator and the reader won’t forget those messages even if they cannot see the prince ever again, but at the same time, they have gained things of importance: Never again will the narrator look up to the starry sky to find it as before, void of meaning and personal connections; the stars, the roses, the well — it is in the things he has come to associate with the little prince that the little prince will live on, and that is how they will always meet. It is by establishing bonds that we enrich our world, even if they aren’t everlasting.\n\nI chose the colours of the content text with elements of Le Petit Prince in mind. The narrator is the colour of the desert at night, which is when he first meets the prince; the little prince is the figure who changes and grows as he makes new realizations and learns new things on his journey; the fox, represented by the colour of the wheat fields that signify his personal connection with the prince, teaches him the most important lessons; the rose, striking and sporting thorns, only maintains a strong physical presence at the beginning, though it is her to whom the prince (see mouseover colour change 8D) is linked at all times; and lastly, the well in the last part of the story is a symbol for something that has accompanied the prince on his entire journey even when he didn’t consciously connect it to the rose: his responsibility and his feelings for her, a result of having been invested in her — they are what colour his experiences and they are what give his world meaning, just as the well becomes a symbol for the things that colour each individual’s world: “What makes the desert beautiful,” said the little prince, “is that somewhere it hides a well…”\n\nThe header images are taken from one of the two music videos mentioned above. Special thanks to Mikari for looking into some code I had trouble with and successfully googling Bilboquet when I failed. 8D\n\nJamais Plus won Amassment’s Shrine Spotlight in May 2016!\n\nLes Liens\n\nIf you would like to link this shrine, feel free to use one of the following buttons and direct it to https://prince.oubliette.nu.
