        "text": "An earlier post dealt with the formation of the basic negative in French (“ne… pas”). But as in all languages there is a wide range of negative expressions, either reinforcing or shading the simple negative. In this post – rather longer than the normal entry – I’ll review the main ones, with examples to illustrate the subtly different meanings.\n\nIn fact, when I tried first to publish this post the system failed – maybe a question of length? So this time I’m going to split it into two parts, reflected in the title. And to make it easier to navigate I’ll list here a basic index of the topics covered, and then if you are looking for something in particular you can quickly scroll down. Otherwise, of course, just browse…\n\n1 Pas du tout\n\n2 Rien\n\n3 Personne\n\n4 Jamais\n\nThose are the big ones, all pretty definite, and they’ll be quite enough for this post. In the second part (next post) I’ll add these:\n\n5 Plus\n\n6 Guère\n\n7 Ni… ni\n\n8 Aucun\n\n9 Ne… que\n\n10 Summary and illustrations\n\n1 Pas du tout\n\nThe point here is that negatives are constantly in danger of becoming weak and lost, and so have to keep intensifying themselves. We can see this in English, with its tendency to build up negative forms like “No way!”, “Not in the slightest” or “In no way, shape or form”. When French people want to beef up the basic negative marker “pas” they typically add “du tout”; “pas du tout” simply and pretty literally means “not at all”. It’s a matter of choice whether you express a dislike of seafood by saying “Je déteste les fruits de mer” or “Je n’aime pas du tout les fruits de mer”.\n\n2 Rien\n\nYou may well have seen the word for “nothing” in Customs signs indicating “Rien à déclarer” at airports or ferry terminals. The expression for “Nothing to declare” is obviously quite literal. What have got in your pocket, sir? Nothing (Rien). It also means “nothing” in phrases such as “tout ou rien” (all or nothing).\n\nThere are two basic ways in which rien can be used to express the idea of nothing.\n\nThe first will be very much like the “ne…pas” form we have seen, with “rien” merely replacing “pas”. As the song says, “Je ne regrette rien”. Similarly, “I eat nothing at midday” (more colloquially: “I don’t eat anything…”) is “Je ne mange rien à midi”.\n\nThe word “rien” can also be the subject of a verb, just as it is in English (“Nothing hurts me more than to say that… “). In this case, we still have to use the negative “ne” to ensure that “rien” means “nothing”, rather than “anything”, and a typical formulation would be: “Rien ne compte comme le bonheur” (Nothing counts as much as happiness).\n\n3 Personne\n\n“Une personne”, unsurprisingly, means a person (whether that person is male or female). Used on its own, however, the word will show similar patterns to “rien” in that it can mean “anyone” or “no one” depending on whether the negative “ne” is used with it. Entering an apparently empty house one might call out “Est-ce qu’il y a personne?” But much more frequently, one will use it in negative connotations, matching the uses seen for “rien” above.\n\nIf we want to say that we don’t like anybody in a particular group or club (let’s not argue why one would still be in the club!) we would say “je n’aime personne dans ce club”. The thing that must be stressed here, as in other words in this sub-section, is that “personne” replaces “pas” – it is not added to it.\n\nAgain matching the uses seen above in “rien”, the word “personne” can be used as the subject of a sentence. But because we are speaking about Nobody, it absolutely needs the negative “ne” to indicate the meaning. “Personne dans le village ne parle français”.\n\nI should add that if the word is used on its own it will have a negative meaning. This is well illustrated in a little exchange from Némirovsky’s novel Une vie française in which a former girlfriend asks a guy whether he is seeing anybody at the moment. Despite her surprise (“Really, nobody?”) the answer is emphatic: “nobody”:\n\n“Et toi, tu vois quelqu’un?\n\n– Non\n\n– Vraiment personne?\n\n– Personne.”\n\n4 Jamais\n\nYet again we have a word that is essentially negative, and marked with “ne” to prove it, in the sense of “never”, but which can also appear on its own in forms that equate to the English “ever”. If this appears strange, you may reflect that the procedure is not really very far from the way in which English adds a negative n to “ever”…\n\nExactly as for rien and personne, we simply remember that jamais replaces pas when one wants to say that one never does something, rather than does not do something. “Je ne mange jamais à midi”. The more positive sense of “ever” has the word being used without “ne” – the French for “more than ever” is “plus que jamais”. This meaning is most often seen in question form: “Est-ce que tu as jamais entendu une histoire pareille?” (“Have you ever heard such a story?”). .\n\nThe fact that such negative expressions may often seem to translate as positive words in English needn’t cause you any anxiety. Context and intonation will always make clear what is meant. Besides, if you fluent in English you’ll be used to handling two optional ways of expressing ideas: “je ne cache rien” could be either “I’m hiding nothing”, or “I’m not hiding anything”) although the meaning is the same.\n\nWhen we are use compound tenses such as the perfect tense the tendency would be to place the negative word (jamais etc) after the variable part of the verb, just as we do in English: “Je n’ai jamais aimé les professeurs” (I have never liked teachers). I should add that that statement is not mine, but again is taken from Une vie française. Later in the same novel, however, we see how word order can shift for emphasis: when the narrator wishes to stress his antipathy to religion, he assures us that even when faced with a near-fatal illness, “jamais je n’ai prié” (maybe, here: “I never once prayed”).\n\nOccasionally one may wish to express two of these negative ideas together, and this is quite possible as long as the introductory “ne” sets the agenda. The best example here would involve the verb “connaître”, which we shall meet properly in a later post but which merits an informal introduction here. For all that he was famed for long (and, according to one critic, “transatlantic”) sentences, Marcel Proust knew how to adapt his style for maximum effect. One of the very shortest sentences in A la recherche du temps perdu sums up the narrator’s reaction after a very surprising action by one of the other characters: “On ne connaît jamais personne.” Whether we translate that as “You never really know anyone” or “You never get to know other people” the French construction is one that might usefully be remembered as a template.\n\nIs there a difference between “I’ll not write any more today” and “I’ll write no more today”? No, I don’t know either. Whatever, I’ll end the post here and come back to some other total or shaded negatives next time."
