        "text": "Making negative statements and asking questions is fairly easy in Portuguese (at last, something easy!). To make a sentence negative, you can just prefix the verb with the word ‘não’. That's it. There are of course, other ways of making things negative, but using ‘não’ is by far the most common, and easiest.\n\nHere are some examples of making negative statements using ‘não’:\n\nThere are a few more things you should know about negatives. One thing you may come across is the negative usage of a strange little word: ‘algum’. This word literally means ‘some’ (as in ‘some day’) or ‘one’ (‘one day’). The feminine form of the word is ‘alguma’, and the plurals are ‘alguns’ and ‘algumas’ respectively. The equivalent of the English word ‘something’ is ‘alguma coisa’.\n\nWhy am I telling you this? Well, ‘algum’ can sometimes be used to form a negative, which seems (to me at least) a little odd. For example:\n\nStrange eh? Especially how swapping the words ‘alguma’ and ‘coisa’ yields completely the opposite result. I’m glad you agree. Sorry, I don't have an explanation for it - you just have to get used to it!\n\nHere are a few more negative words that you should be aware of:\n\nSome explanation is in order! Let's take the word ‘nada’. A literal translation of this would be ‘nothing’. As a one-word answer to a question, this would be acceptable (e.g. – ‘O que comes?’ – ‘Nada’. = ‘What are you eating?’ – ‘Nothing.’). However, ‘nada’ is often used in conjunction with ‘não’ – which might seem to us like a double negative, but is normal practice in Portuguese.\n\nFor example: ‘Não comemos nada’ (We are not eating anything).\n\nIn fact, in this type of sentence, the word ‘não’ is essential to make sense in Portuguese. Effectively then, the word ‘nada’ is being used in a way that we might use the word ‘anything’ – ‘we are not eating anything’ makes a little more sense (grammatically) than ‘we are not eating nothing’.\n\nNote though, that ‘nada’ is only used to mean ‘anything’ when the sentence is negative. If a positive statement is being made (e.g. ‘I eat anything’), the words ‘qualquer coisa’ are used rather than ‘nada’ (‘Eu como qualquer coisa’), although often, the Portuguese will use ‘something’ (alguma coisa) in places where the English would use ‘anything’ (qualquer coisa). Perhaps a few more examples will help…\n\nSimilarly, the words ‘nunca’ and ‘jamais’ can mean ‘never’ or ‘ever’:\n\nBy the way, ‘nunca ‘is used more often than ‘jamais’ – ‘jamais’ being rather more emphatic than ‘nunca’.\n\nNote that the word ‘nem’ can be used in place of both ‘neither’ and ‘nor’ – so when we say ‘neither x nor y’ in English, the Portuguese translation could be ‘nem x nem y’ (an alternative translation would be ‘não x nem y’)."
