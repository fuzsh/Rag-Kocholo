        "text": "Palais Jamais is moor and heath in a bottle: highlands with high rains and lowlands with blazing sun. It starts damp, fertile, grasses, hay, dewy citrus and sun showers. The petitgrain is muted in pewter mist and smoky clary sage, the imagery in mind includes that of plants with tendrils, ivy perhaps, clinging to ancient stone or abandoned wooden structures. I have this view from a porch, sipping tea, overcoming the shellshock of a far too frenzied and hectic world we live in, and I get to come home to this.\n\nSome music that accompanies the Palais Jamais: Brian Eno and Harmonia's \"Luneberg Heath,\" mid-70s Genesis albums.\n\nThe heart has hints of jasmine in its tea and smoked woods. As the morning turns to mid-day, the sun sheds the dampness and dries the landscape, including the mosses, and the vetiver comes into relief, but is tempered by all the tea and leathery birch, oaky bark, the vegetal, sunny heath. The mist is now completely clear and the dry down reveals the rawness of the oakmoss and vetiver fully immersed in auric musk. Dusty, smoky, faded greens, and an ever changing landscape is what we find in this \"Never Palace\" and it's singular. What a scent.\n\nI'm Irish and I have a secret: I don't like the color green. Maybe it's because it's the color of the uniform that I had to wear day in, day out for eight years under the unforgiving glare of the nuns at the convent school I attended. Or maybe it's because it's the color of the grass in Ireland, which only got that way because it never stops bloody raining. Personally, I blame my mother (don't we all?) for making me ingest boiled-to-death kale at least twice a week until I was old enough to say, No thanks, I'll be having some of those French fries instead.\n\nIn perfume terms, a green perfume is either one of two things to me  an idealized representation of a bucolic meadow in springtime (Le Temps d'Une Fete, Chamade), or a bitchy, cold green chypre or green floral designed to put the fear of God into you (Cristalle, No. 19, Gucci No. 3). The first is pretty and elegant, but a little too pastoral for this urban chick. The second, well, I find green chypres to be excessively formal and more than a little unfriendly.\n\nBut last year, in an effort to be more rounded or Catholic' in my tastes, I went on a bit of a green perfume spree to try to find one that clicked with me. Patrica de Nicolai's wonderful Vie de Chateau Intense came very close, but Palais Jamais was the one that won out in the end. In a way, I could say that Palais Jamais chose me, and not the other way around. It has such a definite character of its own that you suspect that it might have native intelligence and chooses to cooperate with your skin (or not).\n\nPalais Jamais is urban. It is a moody creature of tea, smoke, rubber, tobacco, moss, leather, vetiver, and birch. Green it may be, but it is the green of collected urban habits  smoking cigarettes, wearing a black leather jacket, and smelling the scorched rubber smell of the motorbike you boyfriend just left on. It is kind of kinky, actually. On the one hand, it is silky smooth in texture, so I get an image of a silk paisley tie and a conservative silk suit. But the smoke, leather, and all-round badass attitude kind of brings to mind a man in a rubber sex mask in an East Berlin gay bar. So, Palais Jamais = both urban and urbane.\n\nPalais Jamais chose me. And sometimes it still chooses me. But it acts kind of like those mood rings we used to wear back in the day  you know, the ones that turn red for angry, and blue for sad, and so on. Some days, this smells downright glorious on me. On other days, it surrounds me with a poisonous cloud of bad attitude. With Palais Jamais, you just have to judge the moment.\n\nMy review is based on a vintage EDT bottle of this. Incredible, unique opening of oak moss (great, earthy, stale), vetiver, herbaceous notes, tobacco, a light leather note, dense and humid floral notes (the typical \"masculine\" ones, like lavender and carnation), a genius tea note providing a beautiful thin fruity aroma, then a nuance of licorice, which I also smell in Etro Vetiver. A real triumph of natural mysticism, hard to describe but easy to love, powerful and deep, \"rural\" somehow but incredibly charming and refined it its woody silkiness. There is also a slightly salty-animalic base note which adds ambiguous and dark sensuality to an already decadent and elegant carnal scent  a concoction which effortlessly manages to appear Oriental, exotic, savage and mysterious but at the same time, amazingly sophisticated, gentle, \"European\" in its austere, aristocratic meaning. The notes themselves may appear common, but this scent is truly unique, enigmatic, elusive, dense  to sum up and give you a \"rough figure\", however, a mossy-woody-tobacco Oriental blend with resins, flowers (as I said, the typical fougère ones), and an aromatic fog comprising nuances of leather and licorice. A bit linear and quite long-lasting, so be sure to try it before wearing it  otherwise you may get bored after a while. To me, an incredible gem totally worth at least a try (one of those scents which truly smell \"niche\" to me... you need gallons of today's niche stuff to reach such a creative zenith!).\n\n9/10\n\nGenre: Leather\n\nIf you like Yatagan or Parfum d'Habit, try Palais Jamais. It's of the same testosterone-drenched wood and leather clan, though it does manage to walk its own path.\n\nWhile Yatagan and Parfum d'Habit lean heavily on conifer notes, Palais Jamais surrounds its leather with a veil of smoke. The other two are very much rugged, outdoor scents, not too far removed from the forest. Palais Jamais is more urbane: a shot of whiskey and a Cuban cigar enjoyed in a leather chair. Except for its brief, citrus sweetened opening salvo, this is a dry, and I mean bone-dry scent. Even the green notes at the heart are crisp and desiccated.\n\nInterestingly for something so aggressively masculine, my wife smelled it on me and pronounced emphatically that it was NOT sexy. Too much of the stuffy men's club, as opposed to the caveman vibe? Beats me. If you are looking for a mucho macho leather scent with a strong dose of smoke, I suggest a test of Ayala Moriel's brilliant Rebellius. Now that's sexy!\n\nAnother Etro that being a component of this wonderful brand is a bit poetic, indolent, aristocratic, evocative, nostalgic and Victorian. Those are the qualities of fragrances as Vicolo dei Fiori and Patchouly, Shaal Nur and Royal Pavillon, Eliotrope and Sandalo. This one is a silent aromatic leathery scent of the morning. The opening is citrusy and floral with a starring tangerine, some aromatic greens and notable violet and jasmine than the fragrance becomes mossy and characterized by a sheer note of tobacco and the final boise' touch of vetiver. The combination of tobacco, moss, vetiver, musk and leather (also civet is listed) turns it very intimate and corporeal but not in an aggressive way. Apart from the usual dustiness of Etro (cardamom), the woodsy and tobacco dry down is not aggressive o powerful but smoothed by a leathery note similar to suede. The note of tobacco is dominant but is cleverly combined with greens and citrus in the way the smell turns out light, fresh and a bit indolent. The smell is multifaceted, bitter-sweet, grassy-floral and very natural as a deep breath of cool air in the middle of the country early at morning. Coming from far shelters and angles, sheds and farm houses you can inhale the smell of fire and flowers, wood and moss, roasted meat and plants. I agree with Shamu1, this is a pleasant fragrance but is basically tranquil, evocative and nostalgic. It's dry and discreet and has nothing of muscular. Another great work from Etro Milano, grazie di esistere.\n\nThis is a vivid, sparkling fragrance. Although it doesn't change dramatically towards the drydown, it simply changes its face every time I try to pay deeper attention to it. \"Rubber leaves\", or \"rubber soft floral\" - is there such thing? I mean not a combination of rubber and florals, but something that smells like a single note. In fact that's what's great here: it always smells very homogeneous. I can also notice citrus and vetiver but again, they're not \"natural\" or \"real\" - more like surreal, rubberized, more classy than nature can ever be. Earl Grey tea seems the most natural reference. But once I notice it, and it turns to some expensive lemon detergent, then into a incense stick before being burned. A playful fragrance.I tried Palais Jamais in the summer but then some sour notes made it too heavy on my skin. I wear it now in the mild winter and it cheers up the air around me without ever settling to a tranquil state. It's light and dark at the same time and while in hot weather the dark notes seem somehow unbalanced and the green/citrusy notes can seem banal, cooler temperatures reveal its true paradoxical nature. Perfect."
