(Download)\n\n1. “Le passé” by Aya Nakamura\n\nEnglish title: The Past\n\nReleased: 2018\n\nThis danceable number from Aya Nakamura is about letting bygones be bygones in a relationship. The chorus states le passé, c’est le passé (the past is the past). The singer implores her lover to return because they’re destined to be together:\n\nFrench lyricsEnglish translationT'as pris mon cœurYou've taken my heartT'as pris ma têteYou've taken my headTu m'a rendu dingue, dingue, dingueYou've made me crazy, crazy, crazyEmmène-moi loinTake me far awayElles veulent t'avoir mais t'es à moi, à moiThey want you but you're mine, mine\n\nFor more from Aya Nakamura, check out “Djadja,” a chart-topper that hit number one not just in France, but also in Romania and the Netherlands.\n\n2. “Je ne peux vivre sans t’aimer” by Alex Beaupain\n\nEnglish title: I Can’t Live Without Loving You\n\nReleased: 2014\n\nThis song by French singer-songwriter Alex Beaupain is also featured in the 2012 film “Les bien-aimés” (Beloved), where it’s sung by the famous actress Catherine Deneuve. Something about Beaupain’s songwriting tends to make even the deepest heartache feel cozy:\n\nFrench lyricsEnglish translationTu n’es plus là, rien n’a changéYou’re no longer here, nothing has changedLe problème est le même tu saisThe problem is the same, you knowJe peux vivre sans toi, oui maisI can live without you, yes butCe qui me tue, mon amour, c’estWhat kills me, my love, isQue je ne peux vivre sans t’aimerThat I can’t live without loving you\n\n3. “La vie en rose” by Édith Piaf\n\nEnglish title: Life in Pink\n\nReleased: 1947\n\nThis is one of the most classic and all-time popular French love songs by legendary French singer and songwriter Édith Piaf. Known as La Môme Piaf (The Little Sparrow), her emotive voice and powerful performances made her an international icon.\n\nFrench lyricsEnglish translationQuand il me prend dans ses bras,When he takes me in his arms,il me parle tout bas,he whispers softly to me,je vois la vie en rose.I see life in rosy hues.\n\nIf you’re a fan of Édith Piaf, you should check out the 2007 film “La Vie en Rose,” starring Marion Cotillard as Piaf and the brilliant Sylvie Testud in a supporting role.\n\n4. “Comme moi” by Édith Piaf\n\nEnglish title: Like Me\n\nReleased: 1958\n\n“Comme moi” is another spectacular love song by Édith Piaf. It’s grand, soaring and unapologetically over the top. In the song, Piaf paints a dramatic picture of a woman comme moi (“like me”) awaiting and imagining the arrival of her lover:\n\nFrench lyricsEnglish translationPeut-être bien qu'ailleurs,Maybe someplace elseUne femme a le cœurThere’s a womanEperdu de bonheurWith a heart overwhelmed by joyComme moi...Like me...\n\n5. “Et si” by Shy’m\n\nEnglish title: And If\n\nReleased: 2012\n\nHere’s a slicker, more contemporary example of a French pop song. This song reflects on the riskiness of love and the emotions that come along with wanting to abandon oneself to it:\n\nFrench lyricsEnglish translationÉtrange cette envie de te dire ce que je ressens pour toiStrange, this want to tell you what I feel for youAu plus fort de mes désirs de ce cœur qui bat pour toiAt the height of my desires this heart beating for youMoi qui ne dévoile que si peu, à mi-voix, à petit feuMe, who only reveals so little, softly, slowly\n\nIf you like this song, check out Shy’m’s “Si tu m’aimes encore” (If You Still Love Me).\n\n6. “Mon amour, mon ami” by Marie Laforêt\n\nEnglish title: My Love, My Friend\n\nReleased: 1968\n\nThis song by Marie Laforêt proclaims a special love for a particular someone and has an obsessive and delightfully weird quality about it. The lyrics are extremely simple and the tune is so easy to get stuck in your head:\n\nFrench lyricsEnglish translationQuand je rêve c’est de toiWhen I dream it’s of youMon amour, mon amiMy love, my friendQuand je chante c’est pour toiWhen I sing it’s for youMon amour, mon amiMy love, my friendJe ne peux vivre sans toiI can’t live without you\n\nThe song appears in the François Ozon film “8 femmes” (8 Women), which is a musical murder mystery, and it matches the tone perfectly.\n\n7. “Ne me quitte pas” by Jacques Brel\n\nEnglish title: Don’t Leave Me\n\nReleased: 1959\n\nThis classic by the Belgian songwriter Jacques Brel speaks of abject heartbreak. As in the Nakamura song at the beginning of the list, the singer is imploring a beloved to stay and arguing for letting the past go, only the tone here is decidedly more desperate:\n\nFrench lyricsEnglish translationJe ferai un domaineI will make a domainOù l’amour sera roi, où l’amour sera loiWhere love will be king, where love will be lawOù tu seras reineWhere you will be queenNe me quitte pas…Don’t leave me…\n\nNina Simone also did a gorgeous cover of this song.\n\n8. “Proverbes” by Jacques Dutronc\n\nEnglish title: Proverbs\n\nReleased: 1969\n\nThis rich, folksy love ballad has a deep, devoted quality about it that sounds almost mournful but also assured. Here, the singer talks about how he doesn’t believe the more cynical (or realistic, depending on how you see it) sayings about love and he believes the woman he loves will return to him:\n\nFrench lyricsEnglish translationJe t'en supplie reviens moi, reviensI beg you to come back to me, come backAvec toi je veux voir le matinWith you I want to see the morningCar sans toi le matinBecause without you the morningEst tout noirIs in darkness\n\n9. “Je t’aime trop tôt” by Vendredi sur Mer\n\nEnglish title: I Love You Too Soon\n\nReleased: 2019\n\nVendredi de Mer, a.k.a. Charline Mignot, is a fascinating Swiss artist known for what might be described as experimental lounge-pop, or as she puts it, “delicate rap.” In this song, she describes the experience of letting “Je t’aime” (I love you) slip too soon:\n\nFrench lyricsEnglish translationJ'ai dit \"je t'aime\" trop tôtI said \"I love you\" too soonJe sais pas ce qui m'a prisI don't know what came over meElle m'a tourné le dos le reste de la nuitShe turned her back on me for the rest of the night\n\nTo hear more from Vendredi sur Mer, check out her album Premiers émois (First Emotions).\n\n10. “Non non non” by Camélia Jordana\n\nEnglish title: No No No\n\nReleased: 2010\n\nCamélia Jordana came to fame after appearing on a music competition show, Nouvelle Star (New Star) and has collaborated with Alex Beaupain (see #2) on the song “Avant la haine” (Before the Hate). She put out this delightful track about not wanting to do anything when you’re pining over someone:\n\nFrench lyricsEnglish translationJ’veux juste aller malI just want to feel badY a pas de mal à çaThere’s nothing bad about thatTraîner, manger que dalleHang around, eat nothingÉcouter BarbaraListen to BarbaraPeut-être qu’il reviendraMaybe he’ll come back\n\n11. “Quelqu’un m’a dit” by Carla Bruni\n\nEnglish title: Someone Told Me\n\nReleased: 2002\n\nThis is a very fun song to sing along with. Incidentally, this song helped Camélia Jordana (above) launch her career when she sang it on Nouvelle Star. In the lyrics, the singer brushes off the negative things people say about life and chooses to focus on just one positive:\n\nFrench lyricsEnglish translationPourtant quelqu’un m’a ditBut someone told meQue tu m’aimais encoreThat you still loved meC’est quelqu’un qui m’a dit que tu m’aimais encoreSomeone told me that you still loved meSerait-ce possible alors?So could this be possible?\n\n12. “Je l’aime à mourir” by Francis Cabrel\n\nEnglish title: I Love Her to Death\n\nReleased: 1979\n\nThis poignant love ballad expresses an overwhelming love that transcends time, using vivid imagery to convey the depth of emotion. The song’s acoustic charm and heartfelt storytelling have made it an enduring classic, capturing the essence of timeless and all-encompassing love.\n\nFrench lyricsEnglish translationVous pouvez détruireYou can destroyTout ce qu’il vous plairaAnything you wantElle n’aura qu’à ouvrirShe only needs to openL’espace de ses brasThe span of her armsPour tout reconstruireTo rebuild everything\n\n13. “Pour que tu m’aimes encore” by Céline Dion\n\nEnglish title: So That You’ll Love Me Again\n\nReleased: 1995\n\nThis song was written by Jean-Jacques Goldman and sung by the internationally famous Canadian singer Céline Dion. Céline’s powerhouse vocals convey the depths of love and longing, and the lyrics express the relatable willingness to do whatever it takes for a second chance at love:\n\nFrench lyricsEnglish translationJ’irai chercher ton cœur si tu l’emportes ailleurs,I’ll look for your heart if you take it somewhere elsemême si dans tes danses d’autres dansent tes heures.even if when you dance, others are dancing with you.J’irai chercher ton âme dans les froids dans les flammes.I’ll look for your soul in the cold, in the flame.Je te jetterai des sorts pour que tu m’aimes encore.I’ll cast a spell on you, so that you love me still.\n\nIf you grew up in the 90s or earlier, the music video for this song might bring you some nostalgia. Lara Fabian’s “Je t’aime” is a powerful declaration of love with emotive vocals and evocative lyrics. The song’s sweeping orchestration and Fabian’s passionate delivery reflect the intensity and vulnerability of deep love.\n\nEnglish title: And if You Didn’t Exist\n\nReleased: 1975\n\nEnglish title: Indian Summer\n\nReleased: 1975\n\nThis is another classic French love song from American-French singer Joe Dassin. The song nostalgically recalls a past romance that blossomed during an Indian summer, lamenting that they have since lost contact:\n\nFrench lyricsEnglish translationOn ira où tu voudras, quand tu voudrasWe'll go wherever you want, whenever you wantet l'on s'aimera encore, lorsque l'amour sera mort.and we will still love each other when love is dead.Toute la vie sera pareille à ce matinAll life will be the same as this morningaux couleurs de l'été indien.in the colors of Indian summer.\n\n20. “Mais je t’aime” by Grand Corps Malade & Camille Lellouche\n\nEnglish title: But I Love You\n\nReleased: 2020\n\nThis captivating French duet offers poignant verses and harmonious melodies that explore the complexities of love with its highs and lows. The song weaves a heartfelt narrative with a mix of singing and spoken words. Its lyrics compare love and relationship to a burning fire:\n\nFrench lyricsEnglish translationNous on a craqué l'allumette pour l'étincelle de nos débutsWe lit the match for sparks of our beginningsOn a alimenté ce foyer de tous nos excès, de nos abusWe fed this fireplace with our overindulgence, with our exaggerationsOn s'est aimé plus que tout, seul au monde dans notre bulleWe loved each other more than anything, alone in our own little worldCes flammes nous ont rendus fousThese flames drove us crazyOn a oublié qu'au final, le feu ça brûleWe forgot that in the end, the fire burns\n\n23. “Ce soir” by Kyo\n\nHow Love Songs Can Focus Your French Studies\n\nIf you happen to be a French learner or someone who’s considering acquiring the language, love songs have specific applications when it comes to learning French. Let’s briefly look at how exactly they can help you:\n\nPractice your personal pronouns. Love songs are often directly addressed to another person, which makes them great for practicing personal pronouns, specifically first-person and second-person (often informal) ones. Keep an eye out for your tus and your tois (second person informal “you” as subject pronoun and stressed pronoun) as well as your jes and your mois (“I” and “me”).\n\nSee different tenses in use. Many sad French love songs use the imperfect to talk about the past, while others describe their current feelings in the present. Some also use future tenses to imagine what will happen with their lover. You’ll be able to find plenty of examples in the songs above.\n\nPick up on possessive adjectives. Possessive adjectives, or possessive pronouns, are often used to show your relationship to another person, such as in ma petite amie (my girlfriend). Possessive adjectives may also be used in love narratives in a variety of other ways, such as when reflecting on the searing gaze of tes yeux (your eyes).\n\nIn short, learning French with love songs is a great method because it helps you master tricky grammar topics through immersion. And songs are so catchy, so they’ll stick in your memory!\n\nYou can get more exposure to French grammar and vocabulary through an immersive language learning program like FluentU.\n\nThe artists above give you a great glimpse into the world of Francophone love songs, past and present.\n\nIf you explore them in more depth, you’ll only find more beautiful music that tugs on your heartstrings."
