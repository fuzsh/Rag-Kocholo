        "text": "Another Milestone achieved!!!3 years in row I have crossed 300 days with Marriott Bonvoy. 421 nights in 2022, 417 nights in 2023 & now 300 nights this year with Marriott International. Am I happy with Marriott Hotels? HELL NO!!! Is my immense Loyalty Reciprocated by Marriott as a company & by its employees? You would think that would be the case, bar some few exceptions, the majority of the Marriott hotels have staff with the horrible attitude & the hotel itself in bad shape. Let me tell you about my last stay where I achieved this Landmark 300 nights. It was at a Courtyard by Marriott & I was there for 3 nights. I told the RDM in the morning to arrange a car for me to drop me at the airport by 7 30 PM. When I came down to the lobby to leave, the CAR wasn't there. After 30 minutes, the car finally came at 8 pm. I called the RDM, he didn't pick up the call which was utterly irresponsible & the staff were not particularly helpful. Due to my good fortune, I didn't miss my flight!!The restaurant in that hotel was also in such bad shape, disgusting carpets, tables that looked like they were 100 years old & FLIES all around. I am paranoid about Food poisoning in this part of the world, the first day I had a fly in my water & the second day, there were a couple of flies in my apple juice. DISGUSTING!! Ergo, As I reach this milestone, there is NOTHING, not even remotely any reason for me to be HAPPY ABOUT the service & treatment I receive at Marriott hotels. How does Anthony Capuano, Rajeev Menon, Tina Edmundson, David Marriott, Satya Anand, Peggy Roe get away with this? It's really sad and pathetic how 5 star legacy hotels have ruined the guest experience. All I can do as a customer is to shine a light on these disasters and bring them out into the open. Will anything change? Most unlikely!! Speaking of my famous posts here on LinkedIn, I used to have so many Marriott/ Ex- Marriott employees try to act smart & comment rubbish on my posts. I would screenshot those, send it to consumer affairs to make sure such useless & horrible hoteliers never work with Marriott again & they assured me that would be the case and also repost their 'comments' here to make sure they are 'Renowned' for their charm and service...Haha...This stopped after a while & now I see a new trend where these same people, make fake profiles & try to again write even worse rubbish. What a bunch of losers. All it will take for me is Less than a second, to literally delete that comment and block your profile. All that effort for what? NOTHING!!Loser. You achieved NOTHING!! So pathetic. I will continue to write what I have to till the end of time. As someone born & raised in Saudi Arabia & now based in US, I am a child of two worlds. The Arab Toughness combined with American Freedom and liberty in my blood is a DEADLY COMBO!!I am a LION among men and if nothing else, I will continue to call out the nonsense in Marriott hotels for as long as I stay with them!!Make no mistake about that!!\n\nI am delighted to see the opening of Courtyard by Marriott Makkah in my beloved SAUDI ARABIA, the land I was born and raised. This Courtyard by Marriott looks sleek and modern and has 438 rooms and 20 suites. What I really like are the price points. I see the average price about 300 SAR which is roughly $80!!Fantastic....This property is about 5 mins from the Grand Mosque which is quite convenient. Marriott International should invest in more Select properties in the area. I hear the World's biggest Aloft Hotels which has about 1000 rooms is soon to open to Makkah which is also a step in the right direction. There are also plans to open two Fairfield by Marriott hotels in Makkah of 4000 keys which is fantastic and the best price point for budget travelers. The Marriott Hotels already in the Holy city include Four Points By Sheraton Makkah, Le Meridien Towers Makkah, Le Meridien Makkah, Jabal Omar Marriott Hotel, Makkah and Sheraton Makkah Jabal Al Kaaba Hotel. This is not even scratching the surface of possibilities. With the Saudi Vision 2030 planning to increase Haj and Umrah pilgrimage yearly to 30 million from 2030, the potential is enormous!!!Combined with the power of Marriott Bonvoy, it will not only be profitable but be industry leader in providing a comfortable and safe experience to millions of pilgrims. Courtyard by Makkah like most hotels in the city have 'Quad Twin Beds' which I think is so cool. Whether its hospitality or aviation, every single project that finishes shows the remarkable vision and potential of our great nation. My father lived here for 40 years and I stayed for 20 years before moving to America, so I know first hand how important and epochal these changes are. Seeing all the developmental projects come to life, whether its The St. Regis Red Sea Resort in the Red Sea Global region, Or Riyadh Air | طيران الرياض debuting the livery and uniforms and set to fly next year or seeing the progress videos of NEOM, Qiddiya | القدية, Diriyah Company l شركة الدرعية, Trojena, The Royal Commission for AlUla or the soon to be opened BACS Riyadh Metro Project or even the Courtyard by Marriott Makkah opening fills my heart with pride. Every single step, whether small or big, fulfills the promise of Saudi Vision 2030 and I have said this many times, seeing change especially in your lifetime is so powerful and moving. Congrats to the General Manager Hassan Warda and the entire team for the successful opening of this beautiful property. I wish you all good luck!!! Sandra Schulze-Potgieter, Satya Anand, Anthony Capuano, David Marriott, Peggy Roe, Bill Marriott, Debbie Marriott Harrison, JW Marriott, The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, L.L.C., Le Méridien Hotels & Resorts, Sheraton Hotels & Resorts, Westin Hotels & Resorts, St. Regis Hotels & Resorts, Saudi Tourism Authority | الهيئة السعودية للسياحة, Ministry of Tourism of Saudi Arabia, وزارة الثقافة Ministry of Culture\n\nAs the World's Greatest Ambassador elite with Marriott Bonvoy, you'd imagine that I would have at least a Decent time with Marriott International, if not great...WRONG!!It's been a nightmare the last 2 months, echoing the earlier part of the year & let me take you through the 'Horrors' quickly. We begin in July where I was at JW Marriott & they gave me PEANUTS despite being severely allergic to it. It is only my Supreme Intellect & Watchful eye that keeps me ALIVE and I mean it Literally, not figuratively. (Tina Edmundson, Instead of going on great jaunts around the world, vis a vis The The Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection & watching Formula 1 races, I suggest you spend some time training your staff in Luxury hotels to do their job properly!!After all, your the President of Luxury right?) I then went to Courtyard by Marriott where the same thing happened again, this time I was given CORN, also which I am highly allergic to. The Assistant F and B manager was a LIAR who lied not only to me but to his Boss, the Director of Operations, who then personally apologized to me. (Anthony Capuano, your employees have such Honor and Dignity right? Talk about upholding high standards of your illustrious company...What a JOKE!!) After that I went to Marriott Hotels resort & spa where I had a disgusting & abhorrent encounter with a LOSER Room's Division Manager who was under the illusion that he could 'throw attitude' to me after making a bunch of mistakes. Let's just say I taught him MANNERS and HUMILITY!!! (Ty Breland, as the Chief Human Officer, DO YOUR JOB BETTER & hire people with humility & right attitude). I then went to The Luxury Collection where the top part of the walls in the curtain region were falling out & flies all over my food when I was having lunch. Disgusting to say the least. (Peggy Roe, the Chief Customer officer, what a lofty title, if only your employees cared about the customer, that would be nice!!!) After that I visited Courtyard again where I had Massive Food Poisoning, Had to endure Sewage smell when the AC was turned on, Mouldy odor from the walls, Flushes in the bathroom that were unfixable & a host of other problems. Did I also mention that there were insects in my room? (Rajeev Menon, I really don't know what you do in the Role of President of APEC except appearing frequently on CNBC and trying to increase the number of hotels with no concern for quality of product/staff. This guy is the WORST!!) I say all of this because after the 2 month torture and hell I endured, it was so Nice to see one of my closest friends in Marriott, Director of Rooms, the Great Neha Kapoor!!!We could catch up only for 90 minutes, because I had an extremely short stay at her hotel, but for those almost 2 hours, I forgot all my Marriott related problems. It was so good to sit with a dear friend, chat, reminisce, laugh, gossip and relax. Thank you for being a great hotelier and an awesome friend!!!Your the best...Marriott is lucky to have you!!\n\nMy goal with the CLASSIC 'Tearing to Shreds' Videos that I make of the Narcissistic, Egotistical, meaningless, WORTHLESS card of Rajeev Menon is to ultimately put an END TO THIS PRACTICE!!!Speaking for me personally, I would say about 50% of the Marriott International hotels I go to now avoid placing the card to save themselves the embarrassment of this being posted on LinkedIn. My goal is to make that 100% of Marriott Hotels not only Stopping it for me, but for every other AMBASSADOR member of Marriott Bonvoy. We deserve better and I highly encourage the General manager's to write a thoughtful note that serves the purpose and makes it more meaningful. I love tearing this card to shreds with the backdrop of my favorite music. This time I have chosen the ICONIC 'Staying Alive' by the BEE GEES which was released in 1977 and put them on the path of super stardom and Kings of the disco era ( Though it all came crumbling down with disco backlash of 1979 which is a topic for another day).....If I had to pick my favorite song of all time, it would be this...For 20 years, starting with my Nokia 3310 to my Current Samsung Electronics Galaxy S23, this has been my ringtone. Saturday Night fever directed by John Badham and written by the great Norman Wexler was the first time I heard this track in its now seminal opening scene where John Travolta struts around the streets of Brooklyn with his paint can. That instant hook you hear was created by a drum loop because the Drummer the Bee gees hired left quickly. Talk about turning a problem into a record smashing hit. Some critics deride this track as a disco piece but they are missing the point, this song is heavy stuff. If one focuses on the lyrics, it talks about survival in a tough city like New York. But I digress. Let's get back to the matter at hand. The Courtyard by Marriott where I found this was actually for a change, a pretty good hotel. Their GM, FOM right up to the DM were filled with capable & most importantly, HUMBLE folks!!!I liked that. In fact, I was checking out earlier today to shift to a JW Marriott and being a SUNDAY, the GM is generally off work. As I was checking out, I saw the GM coming to me wearing casuals unlike his usual suit and I asked him what he was doing here on his day off and he was like, \"Sir, I came only to meet you and bid you goodbye\"!!!Very nice touch and according me the respect as befits the World's Greatest Ambassador elite...If only Rajeev Menon, and as a matter of fact, Anthony Capuano, Erika Alexander, Satya Anand, Ty Breland, Peggy Roe, Leeny Oberg, Tina Edmundson, Tricia Primrose, Drew Pinto knew what HUMILITY was, it would go a long way in restoring the reputation of the brand. In any case, I will do what I have do and If find this nonsense in The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, L.L.C., St. Regis Hotels & Resorts, W Hotels, The Luxury Collection, EDITION, Sheraton Hotels & Resorts, Le Méridien Hotels & Resorts, Westin Hotels & Resorts, I WILL TEAR TO SHREDS!!!!\n\nI already have crossed 294 nights this year with Marriott Bonvoy!!!Last year in 2023, I stayed 417 nights with Marriott Hotels and the year before that in 2022, I stayed 421 nights with Marriott International which was an OFFICIAL RECORD!!!Simply put, I am the GREATEST AMBASSADOR ELITE in the World!!! What have these 294 nights this year taught me? Oh boy, where do I even begin? When I was a kid, Hotels were MAGICAL Places where Dreams would come true. You had the bellman with the white glove greeting you perfectly, You had the dazzling chandeliers in the lobby, a grand Steinway piano at the center of it exuding class, the lady at the counter would be impeccably dressed and welcome you with such grace, the rooms would be surreal, the General manager would lord over his palace so to speak with a benevolent air and one would leave the premises Happier than you entered, satisfied and craving for that next visit. Now, when you enter a Marriott hotel, one wishes TO WITHER and WILT away because of the agony of the whole ordeal. Incompetent employees, useless associates, arrogant managers, inept GM's, a marked deterioration in standards both in the hard and soft product, shift away from customer satisfaction to enriching the pocket of owners. A hotel was initially created to provide comfort and rest to weary travelers, a safe haven if you will. Now it is place for garish weddings, boorish behavior, disgusting parties and unwelcome antics. They have become the very antithesis for what they were built. Cesar ritz, founder of The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, L.L.C. and the Sarkies brother, founder of Raffles Hotels & Resorts would be so horrified if they knew what the state of hotels have become in the 21st century. The question is why did this happen and who do we blame? Let's look at other service industries and see how they evolved over time. Your local barber in the 1500's and now your hair stylist in West Village NYC, there is MARKED Difference. People purchasing groceries or vegetables in 1700's from your local market now to going to these gigantic hypermarkets like Carrefour, Publix Super Markets, or Tesco, HUGE Improvement!!!Doctors like me, we are able to give a higher standard of care and the use of latest technologies. Even the much aligned Airline industry, It is still in awesome shape thanks to Singapore Airlines, Emirates. The only service industry that has declined over time is the HOSPITALITY Industry a.k.a hotels and I really can't fathom why. Who do I blame? Speaking for myself and because I stay only with Marriott, I hold Anthony Capuano, Rajeev Menon, Tina Edmundson, Satya Anand, Erika Alexander, Leeny Oberg, Ty Breland, Carlton Ervin, Jim Connelly, Peggy Roe, Yibing Mao, Tricia Primrose, Karen Finberg, Brian King, Carla Murray, Drew Pinto, Noah Silverman, David Marriott, Bill Marriott RESPONSIBLE!!! Congrats on destroying what used to be stuff of dreams for many of us. Going to a Marriott hotel now is a NIGHTMARE to say the least!!\n\nIt is no secret that the only C suite executive of Marriott Hotels that I like and respect is Liam Brown, Group President US and Canada Marriott International and this is the reason why. Just look at this post he put up 2 days ago...The guy is so humble and he won the hospitality of the year award at the LendingCon - Hospitality Investors Conference and if you look at the 3 photos that he posted, including the one with the award, There is NO picture of him alone, cinematic, basking in the glory like Anthony Capuano, Rajeev Menon and new entrant to the game, Sandeep Walia does. Notice the picture where he has the award. He looks so simple. No chest thumping, no fierce wave as Tony and his cohorts would have done...His entire post screams HUMILITY!!!Bravo Liam.... I always like to think Big picture and what worries me is who will be the next CEO of Marriott...It is no secret that Bill Marriott and David Marriott screwed Stephanie Linnartz who was the 'Rightful Heir' if you will to the CEO post and installed Tony. I hope they correct their mistake next time and hire someone with an operations background, someone who has washed dishes, cleaned rooms, or taken a check in...I don't want to see a developmental guy like Tony or some Sales dude as the CEO. Liam oversees 6000 hotels by virtue of being President of US and Canada. He has also looked after the EMEA region, vast experience. Most importantly, he is HUMBLE!!!It is only right and just that LIAM BROWN be the Next CEO after Tony. If Marriott messes this up, I am not kidding, I will become a BILLIONAIRE and become an activist investor like Elliott Investment Management L.P. in the mould of Paul Singer and buy a substantial stake in Marriott and then force change. I love what Elliott did with Starbucks. Horribly mismanaged with the nagging influence of its founder Howard Schultz who just can't seem to let go of his baby so to speak. Bringing in Brian Niccol was inspired stuff, great choice. What he did with Chipotle Mexican Grill, turning the whole thing around was Legendary. More importantly, he will be free from the stranglehold of Howard which plagued other CEO's. As much as I love all this, I hate what Elliott is doing to Southwest Airlines, I think its a huge mistake. But I digress. If Liam or someone similar is not chosen as the CEO of Marriott, then I would have to do something like this. If that fails, I will work even harder to become a Multi- Billionaire and do what ELON did by buying X, erstwhile Twitter, I will buy out Marriott and take it Private like how Bill Gates with his Cascade Investment Group, Inc. bought the Iconic Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts. HOTELS are my life, I have been living every single day for the last 20 years in Marriott, Hyatt Hotels Corporation, Hilton, IHG Hotels & Resorts or Accor and I cannot see a company like Marriott get decimated by greed and lack of customer service. One way or another, I will keep up the Fight!!!Congrats Liam, your a good one!!!\n\nThis is an EXCELLENT VIDEO, unlike the Narcissistic ones that Anthony Capuano, Rajeev Menon and new member to the group, Sandeep Walia puts out regularly that is self serving and nothing to do with the Marriott Hotels in question. It's all about them, them and them!!!On the other hand, This video provided insight, was informative and most importantly, HUMBLE!!!Not tooting your own horn like the above mentioned 'luminaries' of Marriott International!!! Bernd Knaier, the recently appointed GM of The Ritz-Carlton, Wolfsburg and being his first stint with The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, L.L.C. was sent to The Ritz-Carlton, Baku to learn the Ritz Carlton culture so to speak. I guess his Tutelage if one can call that, was overseen by the Director of HR Sevinj Purvis. She is interviewing him about his experience regarding the immersion into Ritz Culture. First off, Bernd comes off as extremely humble when he NEED NOT BE. I had a look at his career and it is STELLAR!!He started his career with Raffles Hotels & Resorts and in 13 years, rose the ranks to become Acting GM of Raffles Doha , one of the finest hotels in the world. He worked for 7 years in their Iconic and Flagship Raffles Hotel Singapore ( One of my all time favorite hotel on the planet) and also had a 3 year stint with Raffles Beijing. Started in housekeeping and then moved to the Front office as FOM. Fantastic career!!! While Ritz is my favorite brand and Cesar Ritz is considered the Greatest hotelier in the World and rightly so, I would argue that the Legacy of Raffles is even greater than Ritz for the simple fact that it started earlier than Ritz Paris (1898) and The Ritz London (1906), Raffles Singapore was founded by the Sarkies brother in 1887. Also in the years that ensured, there are more than 100 Ritz carlton hotels in the world now, compared to 23 of Raffles. So you can definitely say, quality over quantity. So when Bernd is being Humble, he really doesn't have to, because he has trained and learned from the GREATEST in the world. To be honest, Marriott should learn from him. I also liked the fact that Sevinj asked him what areas he thinks Ritz can improve. Great question and not arrogant like the bosses that run this company. My only question is, why was Bernd sent to Ritz Baku. Don't get me wrong, the property looks fantastic, but its barely 2 years old. It would have made more sense to go to property that's older and steeped deeply in the Ritz Tradition like The Ritz-Carlton, Vienna or even The Ritz-Carlton Hotel de la Paix, Geneva if Europe was the focus. In fact, I am surprised they didn't send him to The Ritz-Carlton, Astana where he could learn from Master Yoda himself a.k.a Karim Tayach, a 25 year old veteran of the Ritz Brand. In any case, Bernd, Welcome to the Ritz Family and as a lifelong aficionado of the Ritz Brand, I send you best wishes. I really liked that in the video you said 'Short meetings and more focus on the guest'. Exactly the right attitude. Good luck!!\n\nI am a Man of my word and as TRADITION dictates, every single Marriott International hotel that I go to that places this useless, meaningless, egotistical card by that 'Rajeev Menon' will be ripped to shreds. This time, I did by giving an oral history of one of my favorite tracks of all time, George Michael's 'CARELESS WHISPER'!!! I found this card at Courtyard by Marriott which was the WORST stay ever!!That's saying something coming from the World's greatest Ambassador elite of Marriott Bonvoy who stays in Marriott Hotels every single day. Let me list out the litany of problems I faced in this hotel. 1. Every Marriott hotel I stay with, I arrange Airport pick up & for the first time in my life, THERE WAS NO ONE from the hotel standing outside the departure gate. Coming from a long overnight flight, I was particularly Pissed. 2. I enter the room & there is a musty, mouldy smell emanating from the wood in the room. I switch on the AC and a sewage smell blasts from the vents. Disgusting. As someone who is asthmatic which is triggered by scents like this, my stay was a literal nightmare. Even the bath towels in the washroom had a rotten fish smell to it. Everything screams health hazard. 3. I got MASSIVE FOOD POISOINING & is it any surprise? In addition to all the above health hazards I mentioned, I notice a multitude of flies in the restaurant. So many reviews on Tripadvisor & Google lambast the hygiene and quality of food. I am finicky about hygiene and the reason I stay in 5 star hotels in this part of the world is to avoid food poison and a 5 star hotel gives it to me. This is OUTRAGEOUS!! 4. I gave my clothes for laundry & they are returned to me wet, with a foul odor. Unbelievable. The wifi in the room is pathetic, very patchy connection. There are so many insects in my room and this type of fly is attracted to sewage which makes sense since my room smells like one. 5. There was a problem with the FLUSH in my bathroom & I called the plumber who repaired it 3 different times, I repeat 3 times and the problem continued to happen. I mean, what kind of incompetent people do Marriott have working for them? That cannot fix a simple issue? 6. The service is pathetic, they forgot my ice bucket. Even the ice is so bad. Every single thing in this hotel is a disaster. I wasn't spared even during check out because they didn't know how to properly generate a tax invoice. RAJEEV, I know your at a conference today at JW Marriott no doubt feeding your ego and Narcissism. May I suggest you go to hotels like this and check for yourself the dire situation the hotels that are supposedly under your purview. SHAME ON YOU!!!And shame on Anthony Capuano, Satya Anand, Erika Alexander, Ty Breland, Tina Edmundson, Ty Breland, Karen Finberg, Brian King, Yibing Mao, Leeny Oberg, Tricia Primrose, Drew Pinto and Peggy Roe. Get off your IVORY TOWERS and walk around one of your properties and see first hand the decimation of customer service & the pathetic standards.\n\nThe Luxury Collection of Marriott International has roughly 120 hotels in 35 countries. It's history is quite fascinating. For those of you who don't know, for a lack of a better word, they trace their lineage back to Venice in 1906 where CIGA hotels were formed and they came into their modern incarnation of Luxury collection in 1994. In fact, some of the finest hotels in Italy of the original CIGA collection is still among Marriott Hotels portfolio vis a vis Luxury collection which are the Iconic The Gritti Palace, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Venice and Cala di Volpe, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Costa Smeralda. Heading this group is this Gentleman pictured below, Philipp Weghmann, Vice President and Global Brand Leader. As the World's greatest AMBASSADOR ELITE of Marriott Bonvoy, someone who stays every single day in Marriott hotels, it is in my own interest to know the entire leadership team, the powers that be if you will. Most of them are losers & are of no interest to me...I hold them responsible for being in the numbers game, decimating customer service and having an arrogant attitude...People like Anthony Capuano, Rajeev Menon, Satya Anand, Peggy Roe, I have NO RESPECT whatsoever. I really like Liam Brown, the man seems genuine and really humble and tries to improve customer service, but how much he is successful at that is a big question. Philipp on the other hand, had my interest piqued. He's a new guy at Marriott, so that's promising. He worked at Preferred Hotels & Resorts for almost 15 years rising up to EVP Europe. That's the official biography. I dug deeper as a part of my comprehensive research and the more I read about the guy, the more I am liking him. First off, he's not a sales or developmental guy. He's made beds as a housekeeping assistant, worked as a pool boy and bartender, meaning he's gotten his hands dirty and knows the hotel industry. Second, he hails from Germany which produces some of the Finest hoteliers in the world ( Horst Schulze, Karim Tayach) and been traveling frequently since his childhood owing to his mother being a luxury travel agent. One can say its in his DNA. Since Philipp joined Luxury collection more than 3 years ago on April 2021, the brand has been on a roll. TA'AKTANA, a Luxury Collection Resort & Spa, Labuan Bajo opened in Flores Island, gateway to Komodo Park and I wrote earlier about this brilliant property. I was supposed to go to Paragraph Freedom Square, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Tbilisi which also opened recently that I think is a fantastic addition in the country of Georgia. And the 'piece de resistance' of this three year tenure, the crown jewel if you will, in my opinion was getting one of my favorite hotels in the world, the Bellagio under the Luxury collection. I have stayed there countless times and it will be so cool to stay there again as a Bonvoy Member. Philipp, I have high hopes from you. Don't become a numbers guy like Tony and Rajeev. Stay true to your roots. Good Luck!!!\n\nI initially wasn't a big fan of The Luxury Collection, Classic luxury like The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, L.L.C. is my favorite. But luxury collection are quirky and independent hotels that have a distinct character. For me personally, its a hit & miss. But after staying in 6 of them, with Al Maha Desert Resort & Spa being an OUTSTANDING product, I have certainly warmed to their style. I just stayed at my 6th Luxury collection property a few days ago & while the stay was unsatisfactory and below par, an interesting thing happened. I was having LUNCH at the PDR a.k.a Private dining area which is normally a 12 seater table in most hotels, but in this one, its an ENTIRE HALL, practically 60 chairs, if not more. I was the only person enjoying my meal in the quiet surroundings & was talking to the Chef who prepared my food when a GENTLEMEN suddenly walks into the PDR and was keenly examining it. I had one look at his face and I was like, I know this guy. One of my great talents, among many, is my almost photographic memory and It quickly dawned on me, this guy was Nilesh Singh, GM of The Ritz-Carlton, Baku. I have never met the guy, only emailed him twice regarding my stay at Ritz Baku which I had to cancel due to circumstances beyond my control. I saw his picture on LinkedIn and that was enough for me to recognize him and I said,\" Nilesh, how are you? This is Ivin Oommen and we corresponded on email earlier regarding my stay that I had to cancel\". He immediately turned around and I could see that it took a while for him to register who I was and then he said that I was supposed to come for my Birthday which was true and I ended up instead of going to Kazakhstan & celebrated at The Ritz-Carlton, Astana. I was in an obscure city traveling for a day or two and what are the chances that I bump into the GM of a hotel in Azerbaijan in that very city, at that luxury hotel, at that particular time. What a coincidence. I told him that I look forward to come to his property soon & enjoy the hospitality of his hotel and the beautiful and wonderful Azerbaijani people. I also told him that the Ritz Baku must be busy in November with COP29 Azerbaijan & I will avoid coming that month and target either October or Late December. Nilesh seemed a little aloof & rather unfriendly, But I don't hold it against him. I found that he was in town with the Director of Sales of either Ritz or JW Marriott Absheron Baku of which he is the Cluster GM for a meeting. Maybe that meeting didn't go well, maybe he had a rough day, I don't know for sure, but what I do know is that he worked under Karim Tayach for whom I have the greatest respect for, the finest hotelier I rank alongside Cesar Ritz, Horst Schulze himself & Karim himself told me when I stayed at Ritz Astana that Nilesh is a good guy and I will take his word for it. P.S Philipp Weghmann, VP and global brand leader of Luxury collection, Great Job on this Coffee table book detailing your Brand!!Loved Reading it..."
