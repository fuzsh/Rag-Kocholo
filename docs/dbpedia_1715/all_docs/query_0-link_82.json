        "text": "Note: Hippolyte Guillaume Sulpice Chevalier - much better known to the world as 'Gavarni' or 'Paul Gavarni' -- is second only to Daumier as the greatest social commentator and satirical artist of nineteenth century France. Beginning his career as an engineer's assistant he first exhibited signs of his future genius in the late 1820's as a fashion designer and illustrator. Paul Gavarni's talent for caricature and satirical art, however, led him to the editorship of Les Gens du Monde in 1835. He afterwards took charge of the influential periodical, Charivari, and was then forced to live and work in England in the late 1840's in order to avoid political persecution. One of the most clever caricaturists of any age, Gavarni's draughtsmanship was without equal. With the greatest economy of line he captured the follies and foibles of his age. \"On n'a Jamais Compris son Coeur!\" (One can never Understand One's Heart!) was the first of an 1844 set Gavarni produced under the title of \"Phisionomies des Chanteurs\"(Physiognomy of Singers) . This wonderful Paul Gavarni lithograph depicts the strained, most surely heart-felt, features of a young and lanky woman at song. Behind her a scruffy pianist holds a long, solemn note. Most of Paul Gavarni's great art, such as \"Phisionomies des Chanteurs\" was published in series form. Recently wed to the singer, Jeanne Leonie Martin de Bonabry, Paul Gavarni must have gleaned much first hand experience upon this subject. Published by the \"Revue et Gazette Musicale\" (Review and Musical Gazette), the series, \"Phisionomies des Chanteurs\" consisted of seventeen original lithographs. Each lithographs in this series represented a half-length or three quarter-length figure, with the exception of numbers 1, 5 and 11 which depicted full-length figures surrounded by a triple border, however, the numerical prints numbered higher than 1, 2, 4 and 5, are slatted. The serial number of each piece is printed in the upper margin just below the text; \"Phisionomies de Chanteurs\". The text; \"Revue et Gazette Musicale\" is printed to the left and the volume number is printed to the right within the upper margin. The text; \"Par Gavarni\" is placed between the first border and second border under the lower part of the image. The title describing the subject is placed below the last border in the lower margin. This original lithograph is a 3rd state impression bearing the \"Phisionomies des Chanteurs\", \"No 1\", and the \"Revue et Gazette Musicale\", \"No 7\" in the upper and lower margin. As well as the text, \"Par Gavarni\" within the borders surrounding the protrait, and the full title, \"On n'a Jamais Compris son Coeur!\" in the lower margin as published in 1844. It is a fine, original example of the lithographic portraiture created by the French artist, Paul Gavarni."
