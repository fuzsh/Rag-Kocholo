        "text": "The concept of negatives in French isn’t much different from expressing negative concepts in English. In both languages you’re pointing out the absence of a thing, action, place, ec.\n\nForming negatives in French sentences\n\nThe major difference in French is that negative phrases come with two parts (ne + another word). In most sentences the ne and the other word get placed on either side of the verb they’re referring to. (In spoken French the ne is often dropped, but it’s important to understand how to formally form negatives in French.)\n\nUsing Ne…Pas\n\nThe most common negative construction in French is ne…pas, which forms a “sandwich” around the verb in the present tense and means the verb does NOT happen. For example, in the present tense you might say:\n\nJe veux le livre. (“I want the book.”) → Je ne veux pas le livre. (“I do not want the book.”)\n\nIn imperative sentences, this pattern holds true, and the negation goes around the verb command. For example:\n\nMentez à vos parents! → Ne mentez pas à vos parents! (“Do not lie to your parents!”)\n\nUsing Ne…Pas De\n\nWhen you are negating a sentence that has either an indefinite article (un/une) or a partitive article (du/de la/des), the original article gets dropped and is replaced by de, regardless of whether the noun it’s referring to is feminine or masculine, and singular or plural.\n\nThe pas de basically translates to “not any”.\n\nJ’ai mangé une cerise. → Je n’ai pas mangé de cerises. (“I did not eat any cherries.”)\n\nJ’aime les chansons américains. → Je n’aime pas de chansons américains. (“I do not like any American songs.”)\n\nWhere to place negatives in French sentences\n\nThe order and position of negatives in French changes for certain types of verbs and sentence structures.\n\nIn compound verb tenses…\n\nIn compound (two-part) verb tenses, the negation goes around the first (conjugated) verb, not the past participle. For example, in the passé composé past tense:\n\nJ’ai fait mes devoirs. → Je n‘ai pas fait mes devoirs. (“I did not do my homework.”)\n\nThe same order holds for the plus-que-parfait past tense:\n\nLa voiture avait été lavée. → La voiture n‘avait pas été lavée. (“The car had not been washed.”)\n\nIn the immediate future (le future proche)\n\nThe immediate future construction is not its own tense (it uses the conjugated form of aller + a verb infinitive), but its negation also goes around the first (conjugated) verb. For example:\n\nIls vont regarder le film ce soir. → Ils ne vont pas regarder le film ce soir. (“They are not going to watch the movie tonight.”)\n\nNe… pas in Infinitives\n\nSpeaking of infinitives, to convey the message that you are not doing a verb described in its infinitive form, use ne pas + the infinitive form.\n\nJ’apprends à mentir → J’apprends à ne pas mentir (“I am learning not to lie.”)\n\nIl est important d’écrire dans votre livre → Il est important de ne pas écrire dans votre livre. (“It is important not to write in your book.”)\n\nNegatives in French Vocabulary Words\n\nThere are several other French negative forms that follow the same general construction as in ne…pas, but replacing pas with one of the negatives below. They can serve as adverbs, adjectives, or pronouns in sentences.\n\nNegative Adverbs\n\nIn general, negative adverbs in French refer to how a verb is NOT done.\n\nThe ne should precede the verb, and like other adverbs, the second part of the negative phrase should be placed immediately after the verb or other adverb they are modifying. For example:\n\nMa sœur ne danse qu‘avec son petit ami. (“My sister only dances with her boyfriend.”)\n\nIl ne pleure jamais. (“He never cries.”)\n\nIf the verb takes a direct object, keep the verb and direct object together (just like you would with any other adverb). For example:\n\nOn ne voit le chien nulle part. (“We don’t see the dog anywhere.”)\n\nNegative Adjectives\n\nNegative adjectives refer to what a noun or pronoun is NOT like.\n\nJust like any other adjective in French, negative adjectives take the gender of the noun they’re modifying (but not the number, because negative constructions are always conjugated in the singular). For example, notice the difference between referring to un ordinateur portable:\n\nJe ne vois aucun ordinateur portable ici. (“I do not see any laptops here.”)\n\nCompared to using the feminine noun une robe (“a dress”):\n\nJe n‘aime pas une seule robe de ce magasin. (“I don’t like a single dress from this store.”)\n\nThe phrase ne…nul(le) applies to nouns that are uncountable. For example:\n\nJe n‘ai nul espoir. (“I have no hope.”)\n\nNegative Pronouns\n\nFrench negative constructions can be used as the subject, direct object, or object of the preposition of a sentence. The following negative phrases from above can also be used as pronouns:\n\nVous ne savez rien de ce sujet. (“You know nothing about this topic.”)\n\nJe n‘entends personne dans la maison (“I don’t hear anyone in the house.”)\n\nNegative Phrases as the Subject of a Sentence\n\nFor cases where the negative pronoun is the subject of the sentence, both parts of the negative construction go together at the beginning of the sentence. For example:\n\nPersonne ne sait pourquoi. (“No one knows why.”)\n\nNulle part n‘est aussi confortable que ma maison. (“Nowhere is as comfortable as my house.”)\n\nWhen a negative adjective phrase is the subject of the sentence, the first part of the negative phrase precedes the subject of the sentence, and the ne follows the subject. For example:\n\nPas un seul de mes collègues ne travaille aujourd’hui. (“Not a single one of my coworkers is working today.”)\n\nAucun de mes coéquipiers ne sait comment jouer à ce jeu. (“None of my teammates know how to play this game.”)\n\nNotice that these negative adjectives follow the ne… pas de construction mentioned earlier: the de never changes to des, du, or de la.\n\nNegatives in French Word Order in Compound Sentences\n\nIn most two-part verb phrases, the ne goes first, followed by the first verb and then either the infinitive or the second verb (in compound verb tenses), followed by the second part of the negative form.\n\nFor example, in the present tense + infinitive form and in the immediate future:\n\nJe ne veux aller nulle part. (“I do not want to go anywhere.”)\n\nJe ne vais trouver aucun. (“I am not going to find any”)\n\nAn exception to this order is that when the negative phrase is an adverb, it generally goes after the first verb. For example:\n\nJe ne vais jamais essayer ça. (“I am never going to try that.”)\n\nIn compound verb tenses like the passé composé and the past conditional, negative adjectives and pronouns go after both verbs. For example:\n\nJe n‘ai dit personne (“I told no one”)\n\nJe n‘aurais été heureux nulle part. (“I would not have been happy anywhere.”)\n\nHowever, with negative adverbs, again the adverb will generally follow the first verb.\n\nIls n‘auraient plus ri. (“They would not have laughed anymore.”)\n\nJe n‘aurais jamais dit que si j’avais su. (“I would never have said that if I had known.”)\n\nSpecial word order rules for rien\n\nWith rien, in two-part verb constructions like the immediate future and the present + infinitive, rien goes immediately after the infinitive verb. For example:\n\nElle ne va rien acheter aujourd’hui. (“She’s not going to buy anything today.”)\n\nIl ne peut rien voir. (“He can’t see anything.)\n\nSimilarly, in compound verb tenses, the rien goes immediately after the first verb. For example:\n\nJe n‘ai rien dit. (“I did not say anything.”)\n\nJe n‘ai rien découvert. (“I discovered nothing.”)\n\nWhen the negative is the subject of the sentence in two-part sentences\n\nFinally, when you have a negative, two-part phrase that’s also the subject of the sentence, the two parts of the negative phrase precede both verbs, with the ne coming second. For example:\n\nPersonne n‘est venu. (“No one came.”)\n\nRien n’a été livré. (“Nothing has been delivered.”)\n\nNi la lecture ni l’écriture n‘ont rendu mon ami heureux. (“Neither reading nor writing made my friend happy.”)\n\nNegatives in French and Direct and Indirect Object Pronouns\n\nThere’s one more factor to consider when you’re mastering French negation: where to fit in the object pronouns?\n\nWhen you are using “normal” nouns, their location in the sentence almost always matches up with where you would place the noun in English. But with French object pronouns, you’ll need to think through where to place them in any sentence with a negative construction.\n\nIn our direct and indirect object pronouns lesson, we discuss object pronouns and negation more thoroughly, but the most important thing to learn is the order that object pronouns are used in sentences (which is the same order for both normal and imperative sentences when you’re using negation).\n\nThis chart shows the order that is used in both simple and compound tenses. For example:\n\nElle ne m‘a présenté personne. (“She introduced me to no one.”)\n\nNous n‘y allons plus (“We don’t go there anymore”)\n\nIl ne nous le montre pas. (“He does not show us it.”)\n\nJe ne les vois pas (“I do not see them.”)\n\nJe ne leur montrerai rien. (“I will show them nothing.”)\n\nWith the immediate future and verb + infinitive\n\nHowever, in the immediate future and present tense + infinitive constructions, the ne…pas (or other negation) goes around the conjugated present tense verb (which is always aller for the immediate future) and before the object pronoun and the verb infinitive. For example:\n\nIls ne vont pas nous appeler. (“They are not going to call us.”)\n\nNous n‘allons pas le prendre (“We are not going to take it.”)\n\nJe ne peux pas l‘attraper. (“I can’t catch it.”)\n\nNext Steps after Negatives in French"
