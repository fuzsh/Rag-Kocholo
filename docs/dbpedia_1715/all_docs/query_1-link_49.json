        "text": "Rock may be on its last legs in the UK, but France is en fête at the release of a new single by the country's favourite rock'n'roller, a year after a near-death experience.\n\nJohnny Hallyday, whose early career won him the sobriquet the French Elvis, has never found success on the British side of La Manche, but for 50 years he has been the most influential figure in French pop and rock.\n\nNow, just one year after he was at death's door, Hallyday, 67, has made a comeback with a new record. Called Jamais Seul (Never Alone) the song, released yesterday, is described as a \"blues number\" and delivered in a voice tempered by half a century of smoking. It has a dark, funereal tone and was produced with another French star largely unknown outside his homeland, Matthieu Chedid.\n\nThe record cover, signed JH, features the singer's hand wearing a skull and crossbones ring – possibly a reference to his recent experience. In December 2009 he was put into a coma following an operation on his back.\n\nHallyday, born Jean-Philippe Smet, who started singing at the age of 15, has been a music and screen icon in France since the early 1960s when he began belting out rock-and-roll numbers in French.\n\nOver the years he became France's Peter Pan of pop changing his image from Teddy Boy to swinger to leather-clad biker, to wrinkly warbler, completing 100 tours, selling more than 100 million records and winning 18 platinum discs. Presenting him with the Legion d'Honneur in 1997, former president Jacques Chirac praised Hallyday for \"resisting just copying the Anglo Saxons while bringing French songs to the rock offensive\".\n\nEven when he turned his back on France (for tax reasons) and demanded to be recognised as a Belgian citizen, thus giving him the right to live in tax-free Monaco,his loyal fans forgave him.\n\nJohnny's quiff may be more grey than blond these days and his cosmetically enhanced face more leathery than the studded skin-tight trousers he likes to sport, but the new record provoked spontaneous outbursts of joy in France."
