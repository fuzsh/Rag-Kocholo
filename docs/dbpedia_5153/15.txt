OPINION

CONNOR, Justice.

In this case, the Gold Bondholders Protective Council (hereafter referred to as Bondholders) appeals the superior court's award of $15,551.22 in attorneys' fees and costs to appellee, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company (hereafter referred to as Santa Fe).

The facts of the case from which this appeal arises are as follows:

In 1895, Santa Fe issued bonds for public sale. The bonds contained a "gold clause" which promised to pay to bondholders in the year 1995, the face amount in "gold coin of the United States, of the present standard of weight and fineness, or its equivalent," together with interest calculated at 4% annually, "payable in like gold coin" semi-annually until the principal became due.

On June 5, 1933 Congress enacted a Joint Resolution, now codified as 31 U.S.C. ยง 463, which in effect annulled all gold clauses such as that contained in the Santa Fe bonds. In 1980, appellants, the Bondholders, purchased some of the Santa Fe bonds. The Bondholders subsequently demanded that interest owing on the bonds be paid in gold coin or its equivalent pursuant to the gold clause provision. When Santa Fe refused to honor this demand, appellants commenced an action for breach of contract. The superior court dismissed the appellants' amended complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted, thereby precluding a determination as to whether the suit would be certified as a class action. 1
