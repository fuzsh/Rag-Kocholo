        "text": "Facts\n\nIn 1911, a neighborhood in St. Louis, Missouri enacted a racially restrictive covenant designed to prevent African-Americans and Asian-Americans (\"people of the Negro or Asian Race\") from occupying property in the community. More than three decades later, in 1945, an African-American family named Shelley moved into the neighborhood without being informed that the covenant existed. Another resident of the community, Louis Kraemer, brought a suit to enforce the covenant and prevent the Shelleys from moving into their house, even though he lived several blocks away.\n\nMeanwhile, an African-American family named McGhee purchased property in a neighborhood in Detroit, Michigan that also was subject to a racially restrictive covenant. Like the Shelleys, the McGhees were unaware of its existence at the time of the transaction. Like Kraemer, one of the other inhabitants of the community, named Sipes, brought a case to enforce the covenant.\n\nBoth covenants were enforced at the level of the state supreme courts because they were private agreements rather than state action and thus did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. They also found them to be valid under principles of property law such that they were enforceable against later owners and third parties. When the cases were appealed, the Supreme Court consolidated them for review.\n\nIssues & Holdings\n\nIssue: Whether courts could enforce similar covenants that restricted against the rights of whites without violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\n\nHolding: Yes\n\nOpinions\n\nMajority\n\nFrederick Moore Vinson (Author)\n\nHugo Lafayette Black\n\nFelix Frankfurter\n\nWilliam Orville Douglas\n\nFrank Murphy\n\nHarold Hitz Burton\n\nThe Court noted that individuals are free to voluntarily abide by the terms of a racially restrictive covenant. It found that state action would occur, however, if a government entity like a court intervened to enforce a policy that was devised by private parties. However, courts would be allowed to enforce similar covenants against whites without violating the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nRecused\n\nRobert Houghwout Jackson\n\nWiley Blount Rutledge\n\nStanley Forman Reed\n\nCase Commentary\n\nThis was a groundbreaking case at the time because it expanded the scope of what conduct can be considered state action under the Fourteenth Amendment. Since then, many laws at federal, state, and local levels have unambiguously banned discrimination in private residential housing."
