DECISIONS OF COURTS AFFECTING LABOR, 1915. INTRODUCTION. This is the fourth bulletin in the series presenting court decisions, the preceding numbers being 112, 152, and 169. Prior to the year 1912 decisions were noted in practically every issue of the bimonthly bulletins, ending with No. 100, since which date the publications of decisions have been annual. The decisions reproduced are mainly those rendered by the Federal courts or by the State courts of last resort, though in some States the opinions of subordinate courts of appellate jurisdiction have been used, notably for the State of New York; the opinions reported in the New York Supplement of the National Reporter System are this year, for the first time, made use of. No effort has been made to reproduce all cases appearing in the sources used, representative types being usually sought after, though a more general inclusiveness was practiced in connection with cases affecting the constitutionality and construction of workmen’s com­ pensation laws and those affecting the status and activities of labor organizations; considerable attention has also been paid to the de­ cisions construing the Federal Employers’ Liability Act. As was the case last year, no opinion of the Attorney General of the United States construing Federal labor legislation has appeared. As heretofore, the opinions have been abridged, the facts usually being stated in brief, and quotations made setting forth the conclu­ sions reached and the grounds therefor, though in a number of cases findings of the court have been stated in the editor’s own words with­ out direct quotation. The same sources have been used as in the past, i. e., the National Reporter System, published by the West Publish­ ing Co., and the Washington Law Reporter for the District of Columbia. With one or two exceptions the cases appearing are those which were published during the calendar year 1915, the volumes covered being as follows: Supreme Court Reporter, volume 35, page 26, to volume 36, page 93. 26071®—Bull. 189—16----- 2 17 18 BU LLETIN OF TH E BTTBEATT OP LABOR STATISTICS.

New York Supplement, volume 150, page 433, to volume 155, page 1151. Opinions of Attorney General, volume 30, pages 289 to 336. Washington Law Reporter, volume 43. As already indicated, the largest single group of cases is that relating to the subject of workmen’s compensation, since, though simple and summary methods of procedure are contemplated by the acts establishing this system, many questions remain unsolved as yet, for the determination of which reference must be had to the courts. Other decisions of interest relate to the employment of aliens, a restrictive statute of Arizona on this subject having been held un­ constitutional by the Supreme Court. A contract-labor law of Alabama was likewise declared unconstitutional; while interesting decisions as to the rights of members of labor organizations and em­ ployers’ associations and as to the effect of collective agreements appear. Of special interest among the workmen’s compensation decisions are those discussing the extraterritorial effect of the stat­ utes and their relation to the Federal law relative to interstate commerce. MINIMUM WAGE. The constitutionality of the Oregon minimum-wage law was argued before the Supreme Court of the United States, but the opinion had not been rendered at the time of the publication of this bulletin. REVIEW OP DECISIONS. The court decisions are divided into two groups, statutory and common law, though in the following review cases are grouped ac­ cording to the subject matter considered without making this dis­ tinction. CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT. ENFORCEMENT. Cases coming up under statutes are two, under the laws of Ala­ bama and Georgia, respectively, in which workmen were convicted of fraudulent contracts, procuring advances and failing to carry out the terms of the contract. In Thomas v. State (p. 58) the constitu­ tionality of a penal statute on the subject of fraudulent contract was upheld by the Court of Appeals of Alabama, and it was declared applicable to the case of a minor, who though not capable of making a binding contract was nevertheless declared possessed of the requisite guilty knowledge of wrong to authorize his conviction of crime. In Paschal v. State (p. 59), a conviction was reversed on the ground that a general tender of the amount advanced had been made, though another defense, i. e., that there was a conflicting existing contract, was held not to be valid. A statute of Alabama authorizing the pay­ ment of fines of misdemeanants by one subsequently accepting the service of the convicted person under contract to work out fines and costs was held in United States v. Keynolds (p. 177) to be uncon­ stitutional, the Supreme Court of the United States finding that in practical effect, if not in original intent, it was in conflict with the Federal statutes abolishing peonage. BREACH. Questions of breach of contract were passed upon in several cases. In Koch v. Siff (p. 296), the plaintiff endeavored to recover unearned wages after leaving service by mutual consent on account of his fear of injury from strikers; the court disallowed recovery, but it also rejected the employer’s contention that he should be allowed to retain a deposit for faithful performance. In Silbert v. Katz (p. 296) an employee was held not to be entitled to a return of his deposit on a showing that he had refused to render the services contracted for, to the employer’s injury. 19 20 BU LLETIN OP TH E BUREAU OP LABOR STATISTICS. Breach by the employer was held to afford ground for a recovery in Gabriel v. Opoznauer (p. 299), under a written contract, further supported by remarks of the employer; much the same conditions and results appear in Halpem v. Langrcck Bros. (p. 300). Where hiring was for an indefinite term, and workmen refused to continue labor after having worked continuously for a day and part of the night and were discharged, it was held (The J. P. Schuh, p. 303) that the men were entitled to all wages earned. The general principles on which recovery may be had for discharge and the remedies avail­ able are announced in Continental Aid Association v. Lee (p. 297 Where there is an implied renewal of contract after the expiration of a fixed term, discharge may not be justified on grounds known to the employer at the time of the implied renewal (Akron Milling Co. v. Leiter, p. 297). In case of a contract for life employment given in consideration of a release of a claim for damages, it was held a written contract could be added to by oral agreement made at the same time (Swanson v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., p. 298). RESTRICTIONS ON DISCHARGE. A statute requiring statement of cause of discharge had been in effect in Texas for some years, but was declared unconstitutional in St. Louis Southwestern Railway Co. v. Griffin (p. 61), as violating the right of silence, the correlative of the liberty of speech. Where a certificate of discharge has been given which is injurious and de­ famatory, proof must be complete as to damages resulting from the unlawful act interfering with employment; this rule, however, does not make it impossible that a suit for libel can be maintained (Dick v. Northern Pacific Railway Co., p. 64). The question of the right of an employee to demand a hearing where he is threatened with discharge by reason of information given concerning him was before the Massachusetts Legislature, which requested an opinion of the supreme judicial court as to the constitutionality of the proposed measure, the decision of the court being adverse thereto (In re Opinions of the Justices, p. 60). EMPLOYMENT STATUS. The status of a man boarding a train used exclusively to carry workmen, himself not an employee but seeking employment, was held in Schifalaqua v. Atlantic City Railroad Co. (p. 303) to be that of neither employee nor passenger, so that no damages could be re­ covered for injuries incurred in the act. Another case involving the status of employer and employee, though of a very different nature, is that of Pennsylvania Mining Co. v. Jamigan (p. 293), in which it was held that the company was DECISIONS OF COURTS AFFECTING LABOR. 21 liable for the acts of armed guards hired by it, the superintendent of the company having ratified and apparently instigated assaults by the guards employed. A similar question arose as to the status of armed guards appointed under a statute of Pennsylvania (Ruffner v. Jamison Coal & Coke Co., p. 57). No public funds were available for the wages of these appointees, and they were paid by the com­ pany; they were held, however, not to be employees of the company, but to act in a public capacity, so that the company was not liable for injurious acts done beyond the proper scope of their authority. INTERFERENCE WITH EMPLOYMENT—BLACKLISTS. A statute of Alabama penalizes interference with employment by hiring away the workman of another under contract with him for service. The conditions under which the law applies are set forth in Lambert v. State (p. 155). In Scott v. Prudential Outfitting Co. (p. 322) and Kennedy v. Hub Manufacturing Co. (p. 323) courts of New York and Massachusetts respectively sustained judgment in favor of employees whose discharge was procured by false or unau­ thorized statements as to assignments of wages by them. A party placed on a blacklist by associated business men on the ground that his dealings are inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade can not claim damages as for wrongful or malicious inter­ ference where nothing more is done than to give information in accordance with a mutual agreement without coercion (McCarter v. Baltimore Chamber of Commerce, p. 317). In a Massachusetts case also, Comellier v. Haverhill Shoe Manufacturers Association (p. 318), a striker who had indulged in unlawful acts was held not to have “ clean hands ” so as to secure redress in a court of equity, where employment had been lost because of his being placed on a blacklist. A third case that may be considered in this group is that of a physician against whom notice had been given that he should not be called “ in any case” of accident to railroad employees in the locality; it was decided in this case (Peek v. Northern Pacific Rail­ way Co., p. 294), that there was a technical liability for damages against some of the parties defendant by reason of their action. WAGES. MODE AND TIME OF PAYMENT. A law of California fixing periods of wage payment was declared unconstitutional (Ex parte Crane, p. 174), on the ground that its enforcement might lead to imprisonment for debt, this being a pos­ sibility under the penal procedure of the State. In People v. Inter­ borough Rapid Transit Co. (p. 196) a New York statute prescribing 22 BU LLETIN OF TH E BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS. the weekly payment of wages was construed, the question involved being as to whether various employees of the company were within the definition fixing the application of the act. A law penalizing the nonpayment of wages due on the discharge of a workman was considered in Trammell v. Victor Manufacturing Co. (p. 175), and was held to apply to a case where a company has fixed regular pay days. Another phase of the wages question was involved in Atkins v. Grey Eagle Co. (p. 176), in which a law of West Virginia requir­ ing redemption in cash at full value of scrip or money orders was affirmed, the orders in this case being payable in merchandise. PREFERENCE. The preference of wage debts was discussed in two cases, in one of which, Central Trust Co. v. George Lueders & Co. (p. 191), the Kentucky insolvency law was attacked as unconstitutional and in conflict with the Federal statute; this and other questions were de­ cided adversely to the contestant, and the law upheld. In the second case, Blessing v. Blanchard (p. 193), the Federal statute was con­ strued, and distinctions made as to the persons included thereunder as “ wage earners.” Appropriate for mention here, though resting on a different basis, is the case of Faraum v. Harrison (p. 191), in which a bookkeeper was held to be within the preferred classes of em­ ployees for the wage debts of whom stockholders of insolvent corpo­ rations are liable. The mechanic’s lien law of Minnesota was construed in Lyons v. Jarnberg (p. 170), the superiority of liens over a mortgage being affirmed, ordinary lighting fixtures being held not to give a lien, not being part of the structure, and the padding of one item being held to invalidate the whole of the party’s claim. A statute of the same State providing for the exemption of wages from execution was passed upon in Bofferding v. Mengelkoch (p. 127), and a section making certain exceptions declared unconstitutional. BASIS. The Ohio statute prohibiting the screening of coal before weighing where wages are paid according to the weight of coal mined was de­ clared constitutional in the case of Rail & River Coal Co. v. Yaple (p. 194), the decision being by the Supreme Court of the United States. HOURS OF LABOR. GENERAL LAWS. The decisions under this head are unusually numerous this year, as well as of unusual importance, involving both general employ­ ment and special classes of employees. In the first group is the case, DECISIONS OP COURTS AFFECTING LABOR. 23 Saville v. Corless (p. 128), in which a novel statute of Utah fixing a 6 o’clock closing hoar for mercantile establishments with certain exceptions was held unconstitutional. A similar fate befell a Louisi­ ana statute fixing at eight per day, in cities having a population of 50,000 or more, the hours of labor of stationary firemen (State Legendre, p. 130). The Oregon statute prescribing a general 10-hour day in factories, etc., was considered in State v. Young (p. 131), ordi­ nary repair work not being classed as of the type of “ necessary re­ pairs ” which are made an exception under the act. RAILROADS. A number of cases construe the Federal statute fixing the hours of service of railroad employees. In United States v. Great Northern Railway Co. (p. 144) carefully drawn definitions are given of certain terms used in the proviso as to exceptions, and a judgment relieving the company from liability was reversed. In United States v. Den­ ver & Bio Grande Railroad Co. (p. 146), the discharge of an insub­ ordinate and defiant employee, whose place could not be filled immedi­ ately, was held to constitute an emergency justifying overtime work. A similar conclusion was reached in case of the illness of an operator in San Pedro, etc., Railroad Co. v. United States (p. 147), as was true of an operator detained by the wreck of a train; another violation charged in the same case was held culpable, where a change of crew might have been made during a run prolonged by heavy rains, but was not. The engineer of a work train operating entirely intrastate was held not to be one of the employees engaged in the transportation of passengers or property by railroad from one State to another within the scope of the Hours-of-Service Act (United States v. Chicago, Mil­ waukee & Puget Sound Railway Co., p. 148). Questions of classifica­ tion also arose in United States v. Florida East Coast Railway Co. (p. 152), in which it was held that a train conductor who at certain stations used the telephone to receive orders relative to the movement of trains was not an “ operator” limited to 13 hours’ employment; and in Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Co. v. United States (p. 153), in which it was held that switchmen who were regularly re­ quired to telephone to a towerman as to the arrival or position of certain trains were sufficiently identified with the group of employees classed as operators, etc., to require the limitation of their service to nine hours as a maximum at a point where service was continuous. In Delano v. United States (p. 153), the question arose as to whether a train dispatcher having completed his term of service might subse­ quently serve as ticket seller or in other capacities for which the hours of service are not restricted; the determination of the court was ad­ verse to such supplementary employment. 24 BU LLETIN OP TH E BTTBEATX OP LABOR STATISTICS. That the enforcement of the observance of the Hours-of-Service Act is an absolute duty is held in United States v. Oregon-Washing­ ton Railroad &. Navigation Co. (p. 148), where a penalty was enforced against the company in a case where the operator remained on duty in violation of instructions and without the knowledge of any officer or agent of the company other than himself. The question of whether certain offices were operated continuously night and day arose in the case, United States v. Grand Rapids & Indiana Railway Co. (p. 150), the office being closed at intervals in addition to longer periods of seven and seven and one-half hours respectively late at night. In another case, United States v. Chicago & Northwestern Railway Co. (p. 151), it was the practice to allow regular hours off for dinner and for supper, though it appeared that the operators were on call during such times; overtime was found to be worked tinder such circum­ stances, and the offered defense of emergency in a specific instance was rejected as being nothing more than an ordinary accident. The question of reporting overtime work was considered in United States v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. (p. 154), in which the court insisted that all overtime should be reported, even though worked under emergency conditions which would justify the act. The inad­ vertent omission of reports of overtime work, however, was held in Oregon-Washington Eailroad & Navigation Co. v. United States (p. 154) not to subject the company to penalties. A State statute which undertook to regulate the hours of service of certain employees of railroads to nine per day was held in Com­ monwealth v. Boston & Maine Railroad (p. 149) to be unconstitu­ tional; it applied to baggagemen, laborers, crossing tenders, and the like, the court regarding these classes of workmen as not engaged in an occupation calling for special legislative protection. WOMEN. The remainder of the cases to be considered under this head relate to the hours of labor of women. In Miller v. Wilson (p. 133), the Supreme Court of the United States sustained as constitutional the eight-hour law of California for women, the case in hand being that of a chambermaid employed in a hotel. In Bosley v. McLaughlin (p. 136), the same court upheld the same law as amended to extend to hospitals. A very similar statute affecting the District of Columbia} but limiting labor to six days in the week, was sustained as con­ stitutional in Eamshaw v. Newman (p. 138); while in Hotchkiss v. District of Columbia (p. 140), this law was held to include a dress­ making establishment, against the defendant’s'claim that she was rot conducting a manufacturing establishment. The Massachusetts law fixing an eight-hour day for women “ employed in labor” was held to apply to a cashier in a grocery store, who also gave out trad­ DECISIONS OF COURTS AFFECTING LABOB 25 ing stamps and did a little bookkeeping (Commonwealth v. J. T. Connor Co. [p. 140]). The question of the constitutionality of a New York Statute forbidding nightwork for women was before the court in People v. Charles Schweinler Press (p. 141), the law being upheld. An Arizona statute prescribing an eight-hour day for women, and making certain apportionments of time, different for different classes of employment, was upheld as constitutional in State v. Dominion Hotel (p. 1S2). SUNDAY LABOR. The constitutionality of a statute of Oregon restricting Sunday labor was passed upon in State v. Nicholls (p. 190), the contention being that the law was unconstitutional as discriminatory between classes of business permitted and those forbidden; the classification was held to be reasonable, however, and the law sustained. Similar contentions were involved in the case People v. C. Klinck Packing Co. (p. 197), in which the weekly day of rest law of New York was sustained as constitutional in its general scope, the classifications contained therein being held reasonable; a delegation of authority to the commissioner of labor to make certain exemptions in his discretion was held not to be valid, but this fact did not affect the validity of the remainder of the law. The construction of the Indiana statute was passed upon in Stellhom v. Board of Com­ missioners (p. 189), the work of an assessor of property in checking up lists, etc., on Sunday being held not to be a labor of necessity, so that no payment could be collected for services rendered on Sunday. FACTORY REGULATIONS. The cases noted under this head all involve the question of the employer’s liability for injuries alleged to be due to his negligence in failing to comply with the requirements of the law as to safety. FK E ESCAPES. In Goetz v. Duffy (p. 71), the court determined the liability of owner, lessee, and sublessee for failure to maintain suitable fire escapes in an unobstructed condition as required by the laws of New York. This statute was also considered in Amberg v. Kinley (p. 73), where the employer’s liability for death by burning was affirmed on the ground that the employer’s negligence in failing to provide fire escapes constituted liability per se. GUARDS. The guarding of dangerous machinery and its practicability were before the Minnesota court in Puls v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy 26 BU LLETIN OF TH E BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS. Railroad Co. (p. 74), construing a Wisconsin statute and orders of the industrial commission of that State, and a judgment based on violations was affirmed; so also in the case, Ronca v. Wendall & Evans Co. (p. 75), involving the guarding of a steam mangle. INSPECTION—SUITABLE EQUIPMENT. In Burk v. Hobart Mill & Elevator Co. (p. 70), the Supreme Court of Oklahoma held that it was proper to admit evidence, as a de­ fense for the company, that its mill had been inspected by a State factory inspector as relieving the company from the charge of negli­ gence in the matter of equipment. Under this head may be noted the case Wiley v. Solway Process Co. (p. 67), in which the failure of the employer to furnish a punch for punching holes in barrel hoops before driving nails was made a basis of liability on the ground that it was a defect in the ways, works, machinery, and plant of the employer. RAILROADS. SAFETY APPLIANCES. Under the safety appliance acts of the United States a case of considerable interest was passed upon by the Supreme Court of the United States (United States v. Erie Railroad Co., p. 187), in which a protracted dispute as to the definition of a railroad yard was decided adversely to the company, and a new trial ordered in accord­ ance with the ruling that a single yard could not be construed to extend over a territory 2 or 3 miles in length, embracing separate important points and covering a part of the through trackage of the company. Quite a similar question was passed upon by the same court in United States v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Co. (p. 183), in which it was held that transfer trains crossing the Missouri River at Kansas City must be equipped under the safety law as trains in commerce. The law in question requires a suffi­ cient supply of automatic brakes to control the train without the use of hand brakes; in Virginian Railway Co. v. United States (p. 184) the inability of the company to control certain heavy trains without the use of hand brakes was held not to excuse infractions of the law, the conditions being those of the company’s own making, and capable of such modification as to permit compliance with the law. Neces­ sary movements for repairs are permitted by the law, and the de­ cision in United States v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Co. (p. 185), turned upon the interpretation of the word “ necessary” as used in the statute, the court holding that it could not be held to be the mere equivalent of “ convenient ” or other qualifying expression. In Southern Railway Co. v. Railroad Commission of Indiana (p. 186), DECISIONS OP COTJBTS AFFECTING LABOR. 27 the Supreme Court of the United States held invalid State safety regulations supplementing the Federal statute, holding that there could be neither added requirements as to equipment nor modifica­ tions of penalties. FULL CREWS. Another statute affecting railroads is one of Arkansas prescribing “ full crews,” making exceptions for railroads of a length of less than 50 miles. In Kansas City Southern Railway Co. v. State (p. 180), the contention of the railroad that since, though it was more than 50 miles in length, it had less than 50 miles within the State, it was exempt, was rejected by the court. MINES. WASH BOOHS. Statutes of Indiana and Kansas requiring the establishment of wash rooms for the use of mine employees under certain conditions were passed upon in Booth v. Indiana (p. 171) and State v. Reaser (p. 173). In both cases the constitutionality of the act in question was challenged, and in both cases it was upheld; in one instance by the Supreme Court of the United States, and in tie other by the Supreme Court of the State of Kansas. RESTRICTION OF EMPLOYMENT. EXAMINATION AND LICENSING. Provisions of the charter of New York require persons engaged in the business of plumbing to be licensed, and in Gottesman v. Barer (p. 126) it was held that a person not so licensed could not recover for services rendered. ALIENS. Other cases that may be mentioned here involve attempts of State legislatures to limit the employment of aliens. A statute of New York forbade the employment of aliens on public works, and this was upheld as constitutional by the court of appeals of that State in People v. Crane (p. 52), and on appeal, by the Supreme Court of the United States (Heim v. McCall, p. 50). A statute of Arizona extending to private employment, and tending to debar from means of livelihood persons legally within the United States, was held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States in Truax v. Raich (p. 53). LIABILITY OF EMPLOYERS FOR INJURIES TO EMPLOYEES. As indicated in the introduction, the most important cases to be considered here are those involving the application of the Federal liability law. Other cases of interest, however, have been selected, 28 BU LLETIN OF TH E BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS. both, under common and statute law, in order to present briefly the scope and effect of the other statutes and of the unmodified common law. WAIVERS. Contracts procured by employers to prevent the operation of liability statutes are forbidden by the Federal statute and by a number of State laws (see Relief associations). That Pullman em­ ployees may make valid contracts under the Federal law was held in Robinson v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. (p. 87), on the ground that they are not employees of railroads engaged in interstate com­ merce within the scope of the Federal statute. A contract of waiver was held void, however, in Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Co. v. Pearce (p. 118), where the plaintiff, defendant on appeal, had signed a contract which he alleged in this action to be invalid as in conflict with the Federal law. In Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. Harris (p. 67), the contract of waiver was held invalid, not as being forbidden by the State law, but because if valid and binding, it would “ have the effect of repealing some of the statutes of the State,” which could not be permitted. CONTRACTS OF SETTLEMENT, ETC. Of a different purpose are contracts remaining to be noted, arising under the common law. Thus in Kelly v. Burnham, Williams & Co. (p. 307), the wife of an injured workman was held to have a good cause of action on a contract made by her with the employing com­ pany to receive payments on account of her forbearance to sue for injuries which resulted in the insanity of her husband. In Tylee v. Illinois Central Railroad Co. (p. 311), a contract by the employer to pay the regular salary during the time of the injured workman’s disability was enforced, the evidence being held sufficient to support an oral promise not embodied in the written release. A contract of insurance entered into by a railway company with its employees was held to obligate the company itself, and not an insurance com­ pany with which it appeared to have had a general contract; the suggestion that the claim was barred on account of a recovery in damages was not accepted by the court (McAdow v. Kansas City Western Railroad Co., p. 311). Quite similar was the conclusion reached in Liliopoulos v. Oregon-Washington Railroad & Naviga­ tion Co. (p. 308), in which it was held that a company deducting for a hospital fund could not claim restricted uses for that fund as against a general arrangement understood by the workman. Lia­ bility for failure to render service was affirmed. FEDERAL STATUTE. General scope and construction.—Besides the extended discussion as to what is interstate commerce to which the Federal statute is DECISIONS OP COURTS AFFECTING LABOR. 29 applicable, various other points arose for discussion under the Fed­ eral law governing railroad service, while the liability due to viola­ tions of safety appliance laws was considered in several cases. In McGovern v. Philadelphia & Beading Railway Co. (p. 115), the Supreme Court of the United States held the Federal statute avail­ able for the benefit of nonresident alien beneficiaries of fatally injured workmen. The same .court in St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Railway Co. v. Craft (p. 78) affirmed a judgment under this statute in which recovery was awarded for the pain and suffer­ ing of a deceased employee, the right of action therefor being held to survive under the amendment of 1910. The Supreme Court of Tennessee sustained the right of appointment of an administratrix, if for no other purpose than to maintain an action under the Fed­ eral statute (Howard v. Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Rail­ way Co. (p. 82). In Fish v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Rail­ way Co. (p. 84), the question of assumption of risks was considered, the Supreme Court of Missouri holding that the common-law rule valid in that State was applicable in the trial of local cases in spite of its being different from the one adopted by the Federal courts. In Central Vermont Railway Co. v. White (p. 85), however, the Supreme Court of the United States insisted upon the application of the Federal rule as to the burden of proof of contributory negli­ gence, as against the enforcement of the rule of the State of Ver­ mont, in one of whose courts the case was tried. The question of assumption of risks arose also in Davis v. Chesapeake & Ohio Rail­ way Co. (p. 86), the injury arising from a defect not covered by the Federal law. The court held that the employee, knowing the condi­ tions, assumed the risks, and recovery was barred. The measure of damages as interpreted by a trial court was made the ground for a reversal of a judgment in Norfolk & Western Railway Co. v. Holbrook (p. 88), the Supreme Court of the United States ruling that it was improper to introduce indefinitely specula­ tive elements. In Brabham v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. (p. 88), evidence as to the payment of life insurance to a dependent claimant was held improperly admitted, and the judgment reversed on an appeal based on the alleged inadequacy of the amount of the damages awarded. The fact that a public authority has approved the height and condition of an equipment was held not to be in itself a full defense against charges of negligence in Portland Ter­ minal Co. v. Jarvis (p. 83), where, a workman was injured by rea­ son of the use, without notice, of an unusually high car. A question as to appliances and equipment was passed upon also in Gekas v. Oregon-Washington Railroad & Navigation Co. (p. 81), in which the Federal statute was held to apply to any part of the equipment, whether simple or complex, so that a defective adz was held to be within the act. 30 BU LLETIN OF TH E BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS. Where a suit should have been, brought under the Federal statute, but was tried under a State law and judgment reversed because of improper choice of remedies, it was held in St. Louis, San Fran­ cisco & Texas Railway Co. v. Smith (p. 81) that the statute of limitations would not operate to bar an action brought by a petition amended to conform with the rulings of the higher courts. In Cor­ bett v. Boston & Maine Railroad (p. 77), the question of election of remedies, i. e., whether under Federal or State statutes, was up for consideration. It was held that the plaintiff was not called upon to determine under which law the action should be brought, since the facts and not the pleadings determine how recovery may be had. In Cincinnati, New Orleans & Texas Pacific Railway Co. v. Wilson’s Administrator (p. 80), the company was held liable for the negli­ gent act of a subforeman, held under the circumstances to be in course of employment. Incidental absence from work for personal reasons, not going beyond reasonable bounds, was held not to take the plaintiff out from under the act in Graber v. Duluth, South Shore & Atlantic Railway Co. (p. 100). A section foreman was held in Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. White (p. 106) to assume the risks from an insufficient crew and a hand car too heavy to handle, though the work in which he was engaged was within the scope of the act. The effect of the Federal safety appliance act was involved in the case St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad Co. v. Conarty (p. 117), in which the Su­ preme Court of the United States held that an injury resulting from the absence of prescribed'equipment was not chargeable to the negligence of the company failing to supply the same where the employee was not of the class or was not engaged in the work for the benefit of which the safety appliance act was enacted. In Texas & Pacific Railway Co. v. Rigsby (p. 119) it was held that the interstate use of a defective car was not necessary to bring it within the prohibition of the safety appliance act in so far as civil liability was concerned, and that even though no criminal liability attached, its use to the injury of an employee constituted actionable negligence. Interstate commerce.—The decisions as to what constitute inter­ state commerce continue to be in a measure conflicting, though cer­ tain decisions of the Supreme Court have gone far to clarify the situation. Building an addition to a repair shop, the original build­ ing being an instrumentality used in interstate commerce, was held to be within the act in Thompson v. Cincinnati, New Orleans & Texas Pacific Railway Co. (p. 93); it may be noted also that in this case the appellate court held that it was proper to require the plaintiff to choose whether he would proceed under a State or Federal law, in contrast with the Corbett case above. In Thomas v. Boston & Maine Railroad (p. 103) also, an employee injured while removing a burned DECISIONS OP COURTS AFFECTING LABOR. 31 portion of a roundhouse was held to be within the act; while in Shanks v. Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad Co. (p. 91), a workman adjusting machinery in a locomotive repair shop was held not to have any right to action. A brakeman injured while get­ ting a tin cup for the use of the train crew was held within the pro­ tection of the act (Baltimore & Ohio Bailroad Co. v. Whitacre, p. 91), as was a laborer cleaning an ash pit in which ashes were dumped by engines engaged both in interstate and intrastate com­ merce (Grybowski v. Erie Bailroad Co., p. 94); while a workman injured in cleaning stencils used to mark cars used in interstate com­ merce was held not to be within the act (Illinois Central Bailroad Co. v. Rogers, p. 95). A workman injured while clearing a wreck (Southern Bailway Co. v. Puckett, p. 95), one engaged in the con­ struction of a temporary bridge following a freshet (Columbia & Puget Sound Bailroad Co. v. Sauter, p. 96), a trainmaster hauling gravel for ballasting a new sidetrack which had been used in inter­ state commerce (Clark v. Chicago Great Western Bailroad Co., p. 105), and a yard clerk engaged in general duties which took him about the yards (Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Bail­ way Co. v. Farmers’ Trust & Savings Co., p. 115), were held to be within the act. In the last-named case it was said that evidence that duties of the injured man related daily to interstate cars was a suf­ ficient basis for the conclusion without the necessity of proving what he was doing at the particular moment. In Pecos & Northern Texas Railway Co. v. Rosenbloom (p. 114), on the other hand, it was held that in the absence of evidence as to what a yard clerk was doing at the particular time when he was injured while walking through the yards, the Federal statute would not be held to apply. A watchman at a crossing whose duties related more to the public than to any control of the movements of trains or other connection with their operation, was held not to be within the act in Louisville & Nash­ ville Railroad Co. v. Barrett (p. 113). A brakeman uncoupling cars on a “ pick-up” freight train run­ ning locally, but handling in part interstate freight, was held by the Supreme Court of the United States to be within the act in New York Central & Hudson River Railroad Co. v. Carr (p. 92); while in Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. Pitts (p. 97), tho Supreme Court of Oklahoma ruled outside of the act a workman injured while coupling an engine tender and a baggage car intended to be connected with a train carrying in part interstate commerce. A New Jersey court affirmed a judgment in favor of a fireman of a locomotive which he was preparing to attach to an interstate train (Tonsellito v. New York Central & Hudson River Railroad Co., p. 98). 32 BU LLETIN OP TH E BUREAU OP LABOR STATISTICS. A watchman injured while pursuing trespassers on an interstate train was held to be governed solely by the Federal statutes, as an employee in interstate commerce, in Smith v. Industrial Accident Commission of California (p. 98). Whether the shifting of cars and engines not in immediate use constituted interstate commerce was passed upon in Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Knox (p. 99), a workman fatally injured while assisting in the moving of trains being moved intrastate without evidence of destination being held to be outside the act. An opposite conclusion was reached in the case of a fireman on an engine drawing only empty cars in Thomp­ son v. Wabash Railroad Co. (p. 100); in this case, however, the cars were moving interstate. In Moyer v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co. (p. 107), it was held that the nonuse of a car for two or three days for any form of transportation did not destroy its inter­ state character when its last use was in interstate traffic and the next subsequent use was of the same nature. Hardly reconcilable with this were the conclusions in McAuliffe v. New York Central & Hudson River Railroad Co. (p. I ll), in which a freight con­ ductor whose train consisted at the time of an engine and caboose only was injured by collision with an interstate train; his movement was interstate, and he had just previously been engaged in interstate transportation, but it was held that he was not at this time engaged in commerce, and was therefore not protected by the act. A mem­ ber of a switching crew injured while the switch engine was haul­ ing no cars but was passing to another track in order to continue switching in which both interstate and intrastate cars were being handled was held to be within the act in Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Railway Co. v. Glinn (p. 110). A yard conductor moving cars of coal from without the State to a dealer’s private track was held to be within the act in Pennsylvania Co. v. Donat (p. 105). In Harrington v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Co. (p. 108) a switchman was injured while running cars of coal to a storage track for the use of railroad locomotives en­ gaged in both interstate and intrastate commerce. The Federal act was held not to apply on the ground that the coal had not yet taken on any definite interstate character. An opposite conclusion was reached in circumstances quite similar in Barlow v. Lehigh Valley Railroad Co. (p. 110), though in the latter case it was set forth that the coal had some days previously come from outside the State in which the injury occurred. This accords also with the decision in Kamboris v. Oregon-Washington Railroad & Navigation Co. (p. 109), in which a workman engaged in shoveling coal into pockets or chutes from which tenders of engines engaged in both interstate and intra­ state traffic would be supplied was injured. A judgment in favor of a miner mining coal for the use of a railroad company’s engines was DECISIONS OP COURTS AFFECTING LABOR. 33 reversed by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals in Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad Co. v. Yurkonis (p. 102), on the ground that merely mining coal is not interstate commerce, regard­ less of the fact that the company on whose engines it would be used was itself engaged in interstate commerce. A mechanic repairing in a roundhouse an engine used largely in switching interstate cars was held to be within the Federal statute in Southern Pacific Co. v. Pillsbury (p. 106). A similar conclusion was reached as to a section foreman engaged in loading old rails on a flat car, where such rails had been replaced by new ones on a track used in interstate commerce (Cherpeski v. Great Northern Railway Co., p. 112). An incidental feature of interest that came up in this case was as to the question of the privilege of physicians who have ex­ amined employees in connection with a system of medical inspection adopted by their employers; it was held that they might be examined as to the facts discovered by them, since there was no intention that the persons examined by them should be regarded as patients. EFFECT OF COMPENSATION LAWS. A few cases decided under the liability laws were found to be closely related to cases under the compensation statutes of the States. In Behringer v. Inspiration Copper Co. (p. 120), the court below had regarded the complaint as insufficient because it did not state that the employer and employee had disaffirmed the provisions of the compensation act of Arizona. The supreme court of the State, how­ ever, held that this was matter of defense only, and pointed out that the constitution required the retention of the privilege of choice with the injured employee to settle under the compensation law or by lia­ bility proceedings, so that any attempt of the legislature to limit recovery to compensation would be ineffective. In Kamy v. North­ western Malleable Iron Co. (p. 68), it was pointed out that the failure of an employee to accept the compensation act which his employer had elected to adopt as provided under the Wisconsin statute left the employer with the common-law defenses available, and a judgment below in the plaintiff’s favor was reversed. In Shinnick v. Clover Farms Co. (p. 69), it was held that since the New York statute made no provision for disfiguring injuries not producing disability, an action for damages would lie in such a case. MISCELLANEOUS. The rights of a seaman to suitable medical treatment were con­ sidered in North Alaska Salmon Co. v. Larsen (p. 119), in which recovery was allowed for the failure of the company either to prop­ erly treat the injury by its own physician or to send the seaman ashore for the treatment. The status of an employee of an alleged con260710—Bull. 189—16----- 8 34 BU LLETIN OF TH E BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS. tractor was passed upon in Lehigh Valley Coal Co. v. Yensavage (p. 69), the court holding that where miners were employed by the piece and hired their assistants, all were employees, and the rule of independent contractors did not apply. Violation of a statute in running a train above a prescribed speed through towns was held to be negligence in Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. Ford (p. 71), the court holding that the statute was available for the benefit of em­ ployees of railroad companies as well as for the public under the liability statute of Mississippi. The liability of the mine foreman appointed tinder the statutes of West Virginia for defective electrical appliances was passed upon in Crockett v. Black Wolf Coal & Coke Co. (p. 76); the court held the employer liable, stating certain limitations as to the exclusive liability of the foreman for defective conditions. As setting forth in brief a statement of the common-law defenses of fellow service and assumed risks, a statement of a Georgia court is reproduced in Kligo v. Rome Soil Pipe Manufacturing Co. (p. 306). Refusal to permit a sick employee to leave the store till the close of the day, thus aggravating her illness, was held to con­ stitute actionable negligence in Keefe v. Straus (p. 310). WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION. CONSTITUTIONALITY OF STATUTE. The question of constitutionality arose in a number of cases, in some as the main issue, and in others in a more incidental form. In Wheeler v. Contoocook Mills Corporation (p. 200) objections were raised to the law of New Hampshire on the ground that the taking away of the common-law defenses and the methods of classification used in the act were violations of constitutional principles, so that the act was void; these objections were overruled, and the statute distinguished from that of the State of New York declared unconsti­ tutional in the Ives case; incidentally the court passed upon the question of continuity of employment, holding that it was continu­ ous during the interval between the completion of one task and the entering upon another to which the employee was assigned. The constitutionality of the Texas statute was considered in two cases before the court of civil appeals of that State, the court in Memphis Cotton Oil Co. v. Tolbert (p. 217) upholding the law as to all points raised in the case; in Middleton v. Texas Power & Light Co. (p. 219), however, that provision of the act which bars employees from any right of action for damages when the employer has accepted the law was held to be void. Much the same question as that considered in the latter instance arose in a Michigan case, Mackin v. DetroitTimkin Axle Co. (p. 233), in which the employee claimed damages DECISIONS OP COTJBTS AFFECTING LABOB. 35 from an employer who had accepted the act, but had given no notice of the fact to the employee; various points of unconstitutionality were charged, among others the abolition of the common-law de­ fenses; this was held to be within the power of the legislature, and the fact that the employee was presumed to know the law and to have constructive notice of the conditions of his employment, and had not given notice of his rejection of the act, was held to create a situation in which the law could apply "
