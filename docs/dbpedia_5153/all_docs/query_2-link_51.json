Protection endured through the Taft Court years (1921–30). Analyzes potential causes; zeroes in on combination of a decade of northern mob violence against blacks at beginning of 1900s and the intense experience for the Supreme Court of U.S. v. Shipp II (1909) trial, where Court for the only time in its history tried criminals on original jurisdiction. The crime was contempt of [the Supreme] court in the form of lynch mob murder led by sheriff after murder victim’s appeal was accepted to be heard at Supreme Court. Elected branches treated Asians worse than ever, and the Court mainly protected them against administrative or state-level rights violations. In 1916 Court overruled Heff (1905) mandate that once they were citizens, Indians had rights equal to whites. Congress in 1924 gave U.S. citizenship to all Indians. KEYWORDS U.S. v.
