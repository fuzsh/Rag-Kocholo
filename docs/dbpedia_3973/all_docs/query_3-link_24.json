        "text": "Former French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur goes on trial on January 19 on charges that he used kickbacks from arms deals in the 1990s to fund a presidential bid, a case known as the \"Karachi affair.\"\n\nBalladur, 91, joins a long list of senior French politicians pursued for alleged financial wrongdoing, including former president Nicolas Sarkozy and his predecessor, Jacques Chirac.\n\nThe conservative ex-premier will be tried by the Court of Justice of the Republic in Paris, a tribunal dedicated to hearing cases of ministerial misconduct.\n\nAlso in the dock will be his former defense minister, Francois Leotard, 78, though his presence at the trial's opening is uncertain because of illness.\n\nBalladur will appear in court on January 19 \"to face his judges and answer their questions,\" his lawyer Felix de Belloy said.\n\nThe two men were charged in 2017 with \"complicity in the misuse of corporate assets\" over the sale of submarines to Pakistan and frigates to Saudi Arabia between 1993 and 1995, when Balladur was prime minister in the final years of Francois Mitterrand's presidency.\n\nThe kickbacks are estimated at 13 million francs, now worth some 2.8 million euros ($3.3 million), after accounting for inflation.\n\nThe sum is believed to have included a cash injection of about 10 million francs to Balladur's 1995 unsuccessful presidential campaign against Chirac.\n\nBalladur, who also has to answer to a charge that he concealed the crimes, has denied any wrongdoing, saying the 10 million francs came from the sale of T-shirts and other items at campaign rallies.\n\nThe claims came to light during an investigation into a 2002 bombing in Karachi, Pakistan, which targeted a bus transporting French engineers.\n\nFifteen people were killed, including 11 engineers working on the submarine contract.\n\nThe Al-Qaeda terror network was initially suspected of the attack.\n\nBut the focus later shifted to the arms deal as investigators considered whether the bombing may have been revenge for Chirac's decision to halt the commission payments for the arms deals shortly after he beat Balladur in the presidential vote.\n\n'Six Already Sentenced'\n\nLeotard is accused of having created an \"opaque network\" of intermediaries for the contracts signed with Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe ex-premier also stands charged with instructing the budget ministry -- led at the time by Sarkozy -- to approve state guarantees for \"deficient or underfunded\" contracts because of the alleged kickbacks.\n\nInvestigators say that cash deposits in Balladur's campaign fund coincided with trips to Switzerland by Ziad Takieddine, a Lebanese-French intermediary who has long been active in French rightwing circles.\n\nTakieddine fled to Lebanon last June after a Paris court sentenced him and another middleman, Abdul Rahman El-Assir, to five years in prison over their role in the \"Karachi\" kickbacks.\n\nBalladur's former campaign manager Nicolas Bazire was given a three-year sentence by the same court, as did Leotard's adviser Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres.\n\nThierry Gaubert, an adviser to Sarkozy at the Finance Ministry, and a former executive at state-owned naval contractor DCN (since renamed Naval Group) got two-year sentences. All have appealed the rulings.\n\nTakieddine told judges in 2013 that he participated in the secret financing of Balladur's campaign after being asked by Bazire and Gaubert, though he retracted the claim six years later.\n\nIn November, Takieddine also took back his claim that he delivered suitcases carrying a total of 5 million euros ($6 million) from Libyan dictator Moamer Kadhafi to Sarkozy's chief of staff in 2006 and 2007, to help his successful presidential campaign.\n\nSarkozy has denied the allegations, and investigations into the case are continuing."
