        "text": "Although French President Nicolas Sarkozy has earned a lot of hostility, he is, in many ways, a model European leader. As he assumes the EU’s presidency this week (1 July), his record looks much better than his nationalistic predecessor’s.\n\nJacques Chirac is remembered for hijacking the May 1998 summit to impose his placeman on the European Central Bank (ECB), or for chairing the calamitous Nice summit in 2000, stitching up a farm subsidy deal with German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder in 2002, and sneering at “badly brought-up” east Europeans.\n\nSarkozy, in contrast, fought hard for ratification of the constitutional treaty while he was conservative party leader, and delivered his base (which European pin-up Dominique Strauss-Kahn conspicuously failed to do with socialist voters). When the French referendum sank the constitution, Sarkozy put its rescue at the heart of his election programme. He also reached out to eastern Europeans and the UK to promote integration, and has championed non-Frenchmen for high-profile jobs.\n\nThis greater commitment to building consensus beyond Berlin makes some of Sarkozy’s wilder initiatives all the more disappointing. No one expected better of Chirac. But since Sarkozy is so much more European, why does he choose unwinnable economic battles that endanger his relationship with Germany? Where does he get the idea that cutting value-added tax on energy will cut prices, or that bullying the ECB into cutting interest rates or buying dollars will work, or that EU competition law can be circumvented or that European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson is to blame for the death of African children? Ask anyone in French politics and they will give a one-word answer: “Guaino.”\n\nHenri Guaino, a 51-year-old Arlésien, has assumed that special place in political demonology once held by Mandelson himself, by Karl Rove, and by Dominique de Villepin when he was Chirac’s Elysée secretary-general. He has become the shadowy power behind the throne. He is not omnipotent, because he has to contend with other members of Sarkozy’s senior staff, notably Secretary-General Claude Guéant, his deputy François Pérol, and cabinet director Emanuelle Mignon. But he is a man of influence across the policy spectrum. In the Elysée, he is geographically close to Sarkozy and is one of the two officials who always travel with him (the other is commun-ications guru Catherine Pégard). The president considers him indispensable, almost a political lucky charm.\n\nThere are good reasons for Sarkozy’s belief. Guaino has a record as a winner. Four months before the presidential election in 1995, when Chirac was languishing 14 points behind his own Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, Guaino was parachuted onto the campaign team. He crafted inspiring, classical Gaullist oratory and redefined Chirac as a populist worried about “social fracture”, brilliantly managing to label all his opponents as defeatist advocates of myopic economic orthodoxy\n\nChirac’s subsequent victory did two things for Guaino. First, it gave him a reputation on the right as a political alchemist. Second, it taught him a lesson he has obsessively remembered ever since: core campaign promises must be fulfilled in office or the people’s trust in politicians as a breed will be shattered. Shattering the people’s trust is precisely what Chirac did within weeks of victory. Disgusted, Guaino took a job outside politics as head of the planning office – a now-defunct remnant of post-war reconstruction.\n\nBut Guaino never lost his political romanticism. More than a decade later, in 2006, he re-engaged, this time with Chirac’s nemesis. He met Sarkozy while the then presidential candidate was preparing a keynote speech for a Poitiers rally. He advised Sarkozy to rewrite the speech. He told him it was dry and technocratic. He went further, counselling a fundamental change of approach, because someone defined merely as a liberal, atlanticist advocate of affirmative action would never, he predicted, be elected president.\n\nSarkozy hired him, and has never looked back. Within months, his speeches had a new quality. They evoked French history and harnessed socialist icons like Léon Blum, Jean Jaurès or martyred communist teenager Guy Môquet to the cause of national renewal. At the same time, they artfully retained Sarkozy’s central themes of economic liberalism, and appealed to the neglected middle class with a focus on respect, tradition and disdain for the legacy of May 1968.\n\nItems on Guaino’s own agenda – the need to create a Mediterranean Union and to sap the euro’s “excessive” strength – also started to assume prominence in the candidate’s speeches. And although Sarkozy’s longtime allies and bedrock liberal support were uncomfortable, Guaino’s approach once again delivered victory. Determined to avoid a repeat of Chirac’s betrayal, Guaino joined the administration as the self-styled guardian of the programme.\n\nThe experience has not been happy. His lonely fight to ignore “Brussels” and champion a merger of power giants EdF and GdF was seen off by Guéant and Pérol. His proposal to boost consumers’ purchasing power with personal cheques for €1,000 each was ridiculed by the orthodox (sparking Guaino’s angry outburst that the government risked repeating the wage policy of collaborationist leader Pierre Laval). But he was weakened crucially – perhaps fatally – by the reaction to a speech he wrote for Sarkozy where lyricism overcame political correctness. His words implied that the mind of the “African peasant” had “no place for human adventure or for the idea of progress” – which provoked a furious reaction, particularly since the speech was intended for delivery in Dakar.\n\nGuaino’s point – that African leaders should stop using colonialism as an excuse for all their continent’s ills – was lost amid the tumult. What was also lost was Guaino’s autonomy in speechwriting. Guéant managed to impose what he had long been itching for: tighter control over the speechwriter’s drafts.\n\nGuaino hates to be managed and is famously sensitive to any suggestion he is a second-rank adviser – perhaps because, unlike many of the political élite (Sarkozy excluded), he did not graduate from the Ecole Nationale d’Administration. Guaino, raised in Provence by his cleaning-woman mother, failed to get in. Now, despite his degrees in history and economics from Sciences-Po and his considerable private-sector experience, he still feels the need to defeat the énarques in debate and policy development. His track record in winning these skirmishes has not been good, and insiders believe it is only a matter of time before he walks."
