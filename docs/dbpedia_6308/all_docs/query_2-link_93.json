        "text": "Samuel L Jackson seems to be enjoying his performance in it.\n\nthe movie seems fun. Kite is an unusual anime to \"always be a fan of\" though.\n\nit's worth watching once, but other then that, it really isn't great. though i haven't read the manga.\n\nas long as they do not screw it up, and make it 90 minutes, which really KILLED the blood the last vampire movie, it should be fine. as long as they do not try to shove an entire source material into 90 minutes. Blood; everything in the movie was just fine, except for the fact that it never lets anything happen. it rushes everything. and develops nothing. but watching it, i see that they probably did at some point develop these characters. it just some how got cut out post production. it is as if there is an extra hour cut out of Blood.\n\nI hope the same mistake isn't made with Kite."
