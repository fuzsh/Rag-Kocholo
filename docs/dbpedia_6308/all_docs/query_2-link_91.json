        "text": "Now that the Christmas decorations are all put away and the champagne bottle is empty, it’s time to get serious about 2011.\n\nI have a number of big goals this year and some exciting things in store for you. I’m not going to get specific about that here just yet, but you will start seeing the fruits of my efforts soon enough. (Oh, and if you want to be the first to know what I’ve got up my sleeve, sign up for free marketing tips from us. You won’t be disappointed. )\n\nIn addition to setting goals for the year, I have determined three guiding principles to help me get to where I’m headed. I wouldn’t call these resolutions, but more like reminders to help me stay on track and achieve my goals. In a lot of ways, this mirrors Chris Brogan’s three words idea.\n\nI have other principles that are important to me personally, but theses are three things that will be guiding my efforts in my business this year. I wanted to share them with you because I think these reminders might help you as well.\n\nWithout further adieu, here are my three business principles for 2011:\n\n1. Be intentional.\n\nIf you’re anything like me, it’s far too easy to get sucked into the many distractions of life, especially when there are so many things demanding your attention — emails, phone calls, text messages, family, friends, co-workers, clients….and the list goes on and on.\n\nAnd, let’s not forget the bottomless pit of the internet. Reading one status update, blog post or tweet quickly turns into 20, 30 and 40 minutes of lost time.\n\nBecause I’ve got so many things in store for this year, it’s critically important that I maintain laser-sharp focus. This means avoiding time-sucking distractions and completing my tasks with my overall purpose and strategy in mind. It means scheduling my time and learning to be more efficient.\n\n2. Be Balanced.\n\nAlthough it’s possible that there’s no such thing as true balance, here’s what it means to me — taking care of myself, my family AND my business. When too much energy gets focused in one of those areas, the others tend to suffer.\n\nI’ve done this before. I’ve spun my wheels so hard and fast that I end up completely exhausted, or even sick. This year, I’m taking care of myself first. That means training for my third half marathon and sticking with my workout regimen ALL YEAR. It means getting enough sleep every night. It means spending quality time with family and friends. It means saying no to some things, so I can say yes to the things that really matter.\n\nBy doing all of this, it means I will be fresher for my work here with you. It means I will write better blog posts, offer better products and services and ultimately, help more businesses and people succeed. Does that sound okay to you?\n\n3. Be myself.\n\nI spend a lot of time reading blogs, books and other materials to stay on top of marketing and social media trends. However, in doing so, it can be easy to be swayed in a million different directions.I want to make sure that I use the information, but apply it in a way that makes sense for me.\n\nI believe it’s critically important to stay true to myself. In other words, I want to stick to what makes me and my business special and unique. Instead of worrying about what the next guy is doing, I will be focusing on efforts that make sense for me and my business. And, in developing my strategies this year, I want to make sure that they have my fingerprints on them.\n\nWhat about you?\n\nWhat are your guiding principles for this year? How do these tie in to your goals?"
