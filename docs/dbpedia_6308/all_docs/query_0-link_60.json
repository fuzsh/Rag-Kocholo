It is here that some of China's most famous directors shot their first film and some of China's most famous movies.\n\nLast Days for Beijing Film Studio (00:57)\n\nThe appetite for films in China is larger than the Beijing Film Studio can satisfy. Fewer movies are made here. High rises in the background limit camera angles within the movie lot itself.\n\nGang of Four: China's Revolution (00:60)\n\nThe Cultural Revolution shut down schools and universities. Literature was replaced by readings from Mao's \"Little Red Book.\" Only revolutionary songs could be sung.\n\nPost-Revolutionary Film Industry (01:18)\n\nDuring the Revolution, only a few films were being made in China. They included recordings of revolutionary operas and ballets, Films began to be made in 1973, and the industry took off in the early 1980s.\n\nFifth-Generation Filmmakers (02:26)\n\nAfter the Cultural Revolution, film schools re-opened. Known as the Fifth Generation, this new group kick started the film industry in the 1980s. China's three most famous directors emerge during this period.\n\nFilm Director Zhang Yimou (01:16)\n\nDirector Zhang Yimou experiments with innovative cinematography and with risky subject matter.

The film grossed $30 million. It showed the immense potential of the Chinese market.\n\nIn Search of International Success (00:60)\n\nIn their hunger for international success, Chinese filmmakers import talent and learn from abroad.

In 1993, China's film studios were privatized. Profits, and not propaganda, ruled.\n\nChinese Comedy Films (01:27)\n\nDirector Feng Xiaogang risks making films about real people, people that Chinese audiences can relate to.

Later Zhang Yimou moves to commercial subjects. Feng Xiaogang is different; he is very down-to-earth.\n\nPost-Tiananmen Directors (01:01)\n\nA new generation of filmmakers emerges after the Tiananmen protests in 1989.

The film \"The Blue Kite\" was hard hit by censors.\n\nIllegal Film Copying in China (01:21)\n\nIn all of China there are only 3000 movie screens. Most film directors rely on DVDs to gain audiences for their films. For actors and performers, illegal copies are a serious problem, as most of their income is taken away.\n\nFilm Piracy (00:60)\n\nIf filmmakers could attract film goers back into the theaters, they could reduce film piracy.\n\nBeijing Olympics Generation (01:17)\n\nDespite the obstacles over the past 25 years, Chinese cinema has come a long way.

They want to make mainstream movies that influence people. They must learn new skills such as how to distribute their films.\n\nChinese Film Market: 1.3 Billion (01:02)\n\nChinese cinema will prosper because the Chinese film market is enormous. There are 1.3 billion people in China today.\n\nChinese Hearts and Minds (00:53)\n\nA Chinese film director believes his films are not completed until they have touched the hearts and minds of his audience."
