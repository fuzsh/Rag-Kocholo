The document provides a synopsis of the Chinese film \"The Blue Kite\" which tells the story of a boy named Tietou growing up in Beijing from the 1950s through the Cultural Revolution. It describes three father figures in Tietou's life - his real father who is sent to a work camp after making criticisms of the government, his uncle who marries his mother but dies of malnutrition, and his stepfather who is removed from his home by Red Guards. Throughout the film, symbols like a blue kite represent the loss of happiness and family as the Communist Party exerts more control over people's lives.",
