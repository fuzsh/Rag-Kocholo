        "text": "Tian Zhuangzhuang’s ‘The Blue Kite’ focuses on the lives of members of the Chen family under Mao’s rule between 1953-68.\n\nIt, therefore, shows how China was changing during this period and the direct impacts of this on the ordinary population. We are able to see the effects of the three main campaigns (name campaigns)\n\nThrough showing us China through the eyes of the Chen family, we can understand the emotions they felt and the hardships they endured which leads to a realistic portrayal of China during this period.\n\nThe start of Mao’s Cult of Personality is also incredibly clear which again adds to the accuracy of the film.\n\nNot only do we see the negative impacts of Mao’s rule through the Chen family, but some of his achievements are also highlighted in minor details such as wedding reforms.\n\nFinally, Tian Zhuangzhuang grew up during this period, making him the same age as Tietou which adds to the realness of the film as he is directing the film from experience.\n\nHowever, there are also elements that make the film relatively unrealistic such as the lack of severity of the Great Famine and Zhuying being allowed out of prison\n\nIn 1956 Mao was ready to allow greater freedom of expression to those who wished to constructively comment on the success of China becoming a proletarian state, using the slogan ‘Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend’.\n\nThe excitement was shown through Shuyan bragging about how he spoke to his seniors on ways they could improve, which was then celebrated by his older sister and member of the CCP, PRC Aunt.\n\nIt is also highlighted when Shaolong’s best friend Li Guodong excitedly tells Shaolong and Liu Yunwei that he spoke to the head of the library where they worked on their behalf.\n\nWhen Mao received all these criticisms, he made a U-turn and started the Ant-Rightist Movement in 1957.\n\nThis was also very realistically portrayed during the film particularly when the manager of the library where Shaolong, Yunwei, and Guodong worked said to his employees that he needed to come up with a percentage of people that were Rightists.\n\nAt the time, worker organisations that employed intellectuals were expected to purge at least 5% of their workers.\n\nCINEMATOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUES\n\nThe U-turn is shown clearly in the shift in posters in the library from them saying “LET A HUNDRED SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT CONTEND HELP THE PARTY RECTIFY ITSELF” to them saying “RALLY BEHIND THE LEADERSHIP REFUTE THE FALLACIES OF THE RIGHTIST FACTION”\n\nMrs Lan (the landlady) changes into blue clothes like the rest of the community but the Neighbourhood Committee still goes against her and implies she bought her flour on the black market despite her saying she had saved all her rations.\n\nThey then take away her food and say they would let it spoil just to prove a point which again realistically shows how the people valued pride over logic and reason.\n\nAccurate as in 1955 Mao said to the party leaders on Agricultural cooperation, it will “isolate the bourgeoisie”, “facilitate the final elimination of capitalism” and that in this area they are “quite heartless” and will be “cruel and have little mercy.”\n\nAfter his failed Great Leap Forward, Mao’s position in government had weakened.\n\nDuring the early 1960s, tensions with the Soviet Union and them moving too far in a revisionist direction convinced Mao that the Russian Revolution had gone astray, which in turn made him fear that China would follow the same path.\n\nMao launched the Cultural Revolution in order to purge the ‘impure’ elements of Chinese society: the ‘Four olds’ (old customs, old culture, old habits and old ideas) and he called for a huge mobilisation of youth, thus resulting in them forming paramilitary groups called the Red Guards who killed around 1.5 million people with many more being tortured and publicly humiliated.\n\nShujuan has a private conversation with her mother in which she discusses how her sister, PRC Aunt, has been put through eight struggle session and Shujuan says “All the cadres are undergoing investigation”.\n\nThis very thing happened to Deng Xiaoping and Liu Shaoqi as posters were put up denouncing them for their betrayal of Maoist Thought despite them both supporting Mao throughout the Great Leap Forward and Liu Shaoqi being the third most powerful man in China for 15 years.\n\n500,000 cadres purged during CR\n\nThis highlighted how loyalty to the party meant nothing to Mao during the Cultural Revolution because PRC Aunt had been a member of the party ever since Yan’an and as mentioned previously, Mao had no problem purging Deng and Liu despite their extreme loyalty to him and the CCP up until the Cultural Revolution."
