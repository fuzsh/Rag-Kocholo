You also know various dialects and common informal and conversational exclamations and phrases.\n\nAlso, vocabulary usage in Chinese movies is very context-based instead of a dictionary or a textbook. So, grasping what’s going on, you won’t have to rely solely on the words themselves.\n\nIf you don’t understand a word, you would usually make presumptions or guesses based on what’s going on. And also as per visual indicators such as character facial expressions. These all help significantly with learning more and more words.\n\nYou can examine how terminology is employed in various contexts, which can help you know when different terms are acceptable. Finally, you can engage yourself in a pictorial view of unique Chinese customs and society.\n\nThe best part is that it is a fun way to study difficult Mandarin. It would not bore you viewing Chinese movies for hours on end. It is way more joyful than sitting with a conventional approach and memorizing words or sentences.\n\nWatching movies also engages the auditory and optical senses at once. As a result, it is easy to remember, as our minds focus more and retain the knowledge that we find interesting.\n\nWhere to see Chinese cinema?\n\nThe internet and online streaming offer many Chinese movies, television series, and dramas to get you started.\n\nOTT media services like Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, YouTube Premium, Baidu video, and others allow you to watch many Chinese movies.\n\nYou can also view the legit repository of Chinese titles on many websites at your comfort.
