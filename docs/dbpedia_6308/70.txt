Event Details

In 1950s China, just after Chen Shujuan (Lu Liping) and and her librarian husband, Lin Shaolong (Quanxin Pu), have their first child, Shaolong is unjustly forced into a labor camp as a result of Mao’s purges. Shaolong dies during his imprisonment, and Shujuan marries Li Guodong (Li Xuejian).

But the family faces dire poverty under the Communist regime…

Zhuangzhuang Tian’s THE BLUE KITE (1994, 139 min) is an interweaving of a mordant tragicomedy of contemporary Chinese history with morality.
