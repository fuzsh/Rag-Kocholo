Our team handles all matters before the Division of Corporation Finance, including disclosure and financial statement reviews, requests for no-action relief, interpretive guidance, and waivers. We also advise on areas of emerging interest, such as environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues.\n\nThe lawyers in our Public Companies/SEC practice include a number of partners, counsel and associates who have worked at the SEC in various capacities.
