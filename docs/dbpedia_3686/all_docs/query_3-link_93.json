        "text": "Lane Thomas and company started out in 2024 with five wins and seven losses, sitting comfortably in the middle of the pack of the National League East Division. Given that the Nationals ended the 2023 season with a 71-91 record, the squad definitely has something to prove. If they’re able to pull off a playoff spot, you won’t want to miss it.\n\nThe Nationals air locally and nationally. Whether you’re living in the D.C. area or across the country, there is a live TV streaming service for you to get your eyes on the Nats this season.\n\nDIRECTV STREAM carries MASN and MASN2, giving you access to the entire Nationals season. If you sign up for the Choice, Ultimate or Premier package, you’ll also get MLB Network. These packages all have 105 channels or more. The most affordable plan is the Entertainment package, but you’ll only have access to nationally broadcast games this way. DIRECTV STREAM has all local channels, including Fox.\n\nSports fans will also appreciate channels like NFL Network, NHL Network, NFL RedZone, NBA TV, MotorTrend, CBS Sports Network, Big Ten Network and Fox Sports 2. DIRECTV STREAM has unlimited DVR storage.\n\nHow to watch the Washington Nationals on Fubo\n\nFubo subscribers get MASN and MASN2 if they live within its broadcast range. If you live out-of-network, you can still use Fubo to watch nationally broadcast games on MLB Network with the Sports Lite Add-on. Plus, Fubo has Fox. Fubo offers three plans: The Pro plan, the Elite plan and the Premier plan.\n\nAside from baseball, Fubo offers access to a variety of other sports. The livestreaming service has Fox Sports 1 (FS1), Fox Sports 2 (FS2), Boxing TV, NFL Network, Big Ten Network, Golf Channel and Fubo Sports. The Sports Lite Add-on includes popular channels like MLB Network, NHL Network and NBA TV. You’ll get 1000 hours of cloud DVR storage space.\n\nHow to watch the Washington Nationals on Hulu + Live TV\n\nHulu + Live TV is the only livestreaming platform that offers ESPN Plus as a part of your plan. As soon as your Hulu + Live TV plan is active, you can use your login to open and use the ESPN Plus app. The livestreaming service has two plans with the same 90+ channels each. Ads will only be removed from the on-demand library, while live channels also have ads. You can use the service to watch the Nats on Fox and MLB Network.\n\nHulu + Live TV’s sports lineup also includes FS1, FS2, ESPN, ESPN 2, NFL Network, TNT, Big Ten Network and SEC Network. You can increase sports coverage by purchasing the Sports Add-on. This extra has no contract requirement and can be canceled at any time. Featured channels in the add-on include NFL RedZone, FanDuel TV, FanDuel Racing, MAVTV, Outdoor Channel and Sportsman Channel. Hulu + Live TV has unlimited DVR space.\n\nHow to watch the Washington Nationals on Sling TV\n\nSling TV doesn’t have regional sports networks. It has local channels in select markets, which include some of the Washington, D.C. area. If you can get local channels, you’ll be able to watch the Nats on Fox. You can also access the MLB Network by purchasing one of the Sports Extras. The Sling Blue package is the better option for Nationals fans because its lineup includes Fox (where local channels are included). You can get the channels in both Sling TV packages with the Sling Orange & Blue plan.\n\nWhile Sling Orange doesn’t carry the Nationals, it does offer channels like ESPN and TBS that show other teams. Channels in these extras include MLB Network. Plus, you can get MLB Network Strike Zone, NHL Network, NBA TV, Tennis Channel, NFL RedZone and Golf Channel. Customers get 50 hours of DVR storage and a slight upgrade to 200 hours is available.\n\nHow to watch the Washington Nationals on YouTube TV\n\nYouTube TV is not the best option for Nationals fans. Its single available plan is missing MLB TV and regional sports networks. This leaves you with only Fox to watch your team. On the plus side, the plan has more than 100 channels. You’ll get NFL Network, FS1, ESPN, FS2, MotorTrend, SEC Network, the CBS Sports Network and the Tennis Channel among others. YouTube TV is also the only place to get the NFL Sunday Ticket during football season.\n\nThe YouTube TV Sports Plus offers additional channels like NFL RedZone, Fox Soccer Plus, Billiard TV, FanDuel TV and Fight Network. Appealing features of YouTube TV include unlimited DVR, the key plays feature and live scoring stats during games.\n\nHow to watch the Washington Nationals on Apple TV+\n\nSome MLB games will air only on Apple TV+’s “Friday Night Baseball” during the 2024 season. This includes The Nationals vs. Toronto Blue Jays game in May. Apple TV+ has a seven-day free trial.\n\nYou can sign up for Apple TV+ on the Apple website or an Apple device. New iPhone and iPads come with this app installed. Once you have a subscription, you can download the Apple TV+ to a variety of compatible devices and smart TVs. This includes Amazon Fire TVs, Amazon Fire TV Sticks; Samsung, LG, Panasonic, Sony, TCL and VIZIO smart TVs; Roku devices; PlayStation and Xbox gaming consoles; and Chromecast with Google TV.\n\nHow to watch Washington Nationals out-of-market games with MLB TV\n\nYou can use MLB TV to watch out-of-market Nationals games, making it a good option for fans who live outside the DMV. The service offers all out-of-market games.\n\nIf you live in or near D.C., you can get a team pass, which only grants access to Nationals out-of-market contests. You can also pay more per season for both passes. Signing up for MLB TV is easy on the MLB website. Fans can also add MLB TV as a channel to their existing Amazon Prime account.\n\nFAQ\n\nHow can I watch the Nationals without MASN?\n\nIn addition to airing on MASN, the Nats are broadcast on MASN2 locally. Nationally broadcast games are available on ESPN Plus, Fox and MLB Network.\n\nCan I watch the Washington Nationals on YouTube TV?\n\nYouTube TV is not the best service for Nats coverage in the 2024 season. Because the streaming platform couldn’t reach a deal with the MLB Network and lacks regional sports networks, you can only watch Nationals games that air on Fox.\n\nIs MASN on DIRECTV STREAM?\n\nYes. The Mid-Atlantic Sports Network is on DIRECTV STREAM if you are in the coverage area. It also has MASN2."
