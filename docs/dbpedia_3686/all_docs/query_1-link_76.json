        "text": "If there’s one word to describe the Trump era, his presidency, and the man himself, it’s volatile. From the Russia investigation to his impeachment to becoming the first US president to be a convicted felon, Donald Trump has taken America on a wild ride.\n\nHis publicly-traded company, Trump Media & Technology Group, which goes by the eponymous ticker DJT, is no different. Ever since Trump’s media company went public in March, a chart showing the stock’s gyrations could double as a heart monitor of America over the last eight years. After his conviction last week on 34 counts of falsifying business records, tied to the hush-money payment to an adult film star, the shares whiplashed even further."
