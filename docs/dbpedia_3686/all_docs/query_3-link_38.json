        "text": "Nationals Park is still one of the newer parks in the MLB, and the Nationals have done a great job of making the park accessible for all. If we haven’t answered your question below, reach out to the Nationals at 202-675-6287.\n\nParking: Due to the ballpark’s location, there are a limited number of accessible parking spaces. They are in the GEICO Garage, and Garage C. You can only purchase accessible parking ahead of time, online, which you can do here. If you don’t plan on parking but need drop off access, the Police Department directs traffic during game days, and will allow you to be dropped off at the intersection of Potomac Ave and First Street SE.\n\nGates: All gates are accessible, so feel free to enter wherever makes most sense for your seat. The Center Field Gate opens 2 hours prior to first pitch, but only allows access to the Center Field stands and Center Field concourse area. All other gates open 30 minutes later and will allow access to the rest of the park.\n\nElevators: You can find elevators in the following locations:\n\nSection 113\n\nSection 134\n\nSection 120 (only accesses the Sky Club, Club Level and Press Box)\n\nRamps: If you’d prefer to use the ramps to get to your seat, those are located behind Sections 107 and 131.\n\nRestrooms: Each restroom in Nationals Park includes accessible stalls. In addition, there are family and companion restrooms located in sections 104, 117, 139, 235, 307, and 319.\n\nSeating: There are accessible seats throughout the park in each level except for the 400 level (which is only reachable by stairs), so you can choose your preferred view of the field. Call the Nats at 202-675-6287 or reserve your seats online.\n\nWheelchair Service: The Nationals offer courtesy wheelchairs which can be found at any Guest Services location. You can also flag down a Nationals fan host and ask for their help, which they will be happy to provide.\n\nIf you have any issues or questions while at the ballpark, please utilize Guest Services. Each MLB team has this department, and they are solely focused on making sure each fan has a safe and memorable time at the ballpark.\n\nYou can find Guest Services desks at Nationals Park in sections 103, 131, and 320. They should be able to help answer any questions you have about the park, stamp your MLB Passport, or help address any concerns. If you have any issues or questions before your visit, you can reach the Nationals at service@nationals.com or 202-675-6287. Once inside the ballpark, you may be better off tweeting to @natsparkservice.\n\nIf you have problems with unruly fans, you can text “NATS”, your location, and a short description of what’s going on to 69050."
