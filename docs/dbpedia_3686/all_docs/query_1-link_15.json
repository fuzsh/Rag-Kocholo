To be on the list, companies must be at least 50% employee-owned; most on the list are 100%. Collectively, these broad-based plans employ close to 685,000 people.\n\nThis list includes the largest broad-based employee-owned companies in the US that we could verify using governmental or other credible third-party sources. Most are ESOP-owned, and one is a cooperative. Size is measured by reports of full- and part-time employees in the US compiled by correspondence with companies, corporate websites, and/or by the active participants in the plan according to the company's latest Form 5500 filing. The NCEO compiled this list through a comprehensive analysis of all ESOP filings and our own research to determine ownership percentages. Suggested additions and corrections are warmly welcomed; contact Research Director Nancy Wiefek at [email protected].\n\nTo sort the table by a particular column, click on one of the headings at the top of the table.\n\nRank Company City State Start Date Business Employees 1 Publix Super Markets Lakeland FL 1974 Supermarkets 250,000 2 WinCo Foods* Boise ID 1985 Supermarkets 22,000 3 Houchens Industries* Bowling Green KY 1961 Supermarkets & other services 18,000 4 Brookshire Grocery Company* Lufkin TX 2001 Supermarkets 15,000 5 Amsted Industries* Chicago IL 1984 Industrial components 14,000 6 W.L.
