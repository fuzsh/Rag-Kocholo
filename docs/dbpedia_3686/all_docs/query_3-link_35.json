        "text": "After its opening in 2008, the U.S. Green Building Council noted that Nationals Park was one of the most ambitious projects to achieve certification. The ballpark incorporates sustainable design elements such as the installation of water conserving plumbing fixtures, which save 3.6 million gallons of water per year and reduce overall water consumption by 30%. Recycled materials were used in 20% of the ballpark’s construction and 35% of the building’s materials were procured regionally. The stadium’s suites and club interiors utilize low emitting materials, including carpet, adhesives and paints. With high efficiency field lighting, the ballpark saves 21% in energy costs. To manage stormwater effectively, the ballpark has enhanced sand filters buried throughout to screen organic debris and redirect bowl wash-down to the sanitary system. The playing field also has a sampling maintenance hole for regular runoff quality tests.\n\nNationals Park embodies multiple facets of both urban and sustainable design. The ballpark’s river location seeks to relate to its environment through transparency, massing and openness, along with a strikingly simple gesture of geometric volumes. It also presents a monumental façade consistent with the traditions of D.C.’s best civic buildings. The ballpark breaks away from the traditional mold of newer ballparks and has a sleek, modern design that features a mostly glass and steel facade. A 6,300-square-foot green roof with drought resistant plants thrives above the concession areas, minimizing heat gain at the ballpark. The design also features light color roof materials to reduce heat absorption.\n\nNationals Park was the first professional stadium in the U.S. to achieve LEED Silver certification. The design-build project was completed on-time and on-budget in 23 months, remediating the brownfield site. The result is a beautiful, lasting ballpark that serves as an anchor for the mixed-use Capital Riverfront in the nation’s capital."
