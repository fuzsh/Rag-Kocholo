        "text": "In 2023, the UAE hosted the 28th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28) at Expo City Dubai.\n\nThe summit delivered the UAE Consensus, a historic agreement to transition away from fossil fuels, with the potential to redefine global economies and final language that keeps the goal of limiting global warming below 1.5°C within reach.\n\nUnder the leadership of the UAE Presidency and through intensive diplomacy, negotiators at COP28:\n\n“Everyone united, acted and delivered. We operationalized loss and damage and started to fill the fund. We mobilized more than $85 billion in new financial commitments. We launched ALTÉRRA, the world’s largest catalytic private investor that is 100 percent focused on solutions to climate change. And we delivered world first after world first.\n\nA global goal to triple renewables and double energy efficiency. Declarations on agriculture, food and health. Many more oil and gas companies stepping up for the first time on methane and emissions. And we have language on fossil fuels in our final agreement. All of these are world firsts.”\n\n– Dr. Sultan Al Jaber, COP28 President\n\nThe major global event, and most inclusive COP to-date, welcomed high-level participation, from over 198 parties and 85,000 participants. The COP28 program emphasized the key roles of civil society, women, youth, local leaders, faith-based communities, Indigenous Peoples, private sector leaders and those facing the frontline impacts of climate change, as essential elements of the solution.\n\n“As COP28 concludes in the UAE, I thank all the participating delegations that worked together to achieve the historic UAE Consensus to accelerate climate action. I also commend the local and international teams that contributed to the successful organization of the event. The conference produced significant results, and we will continue to work hand-in-hand with the global community to advance all efforts aimed at securing a more sustainable future for our planet and its people.” - HH Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the United Arab Emirates\n\nSince its inception in 1971, the UAE has supported the global climate agenda. As a country at the heart of climate impacts and undergoing a major energy transition, the UAE has long viewed climate change as a challenge that must be overcome.\n\nThe UAE’s hosting of COP28 built on the country’s track record of action to meet the global climate challenge. The UAE is a global hub for logistics, transportation and green technology and is at the crossroads of business, commerce and tourism. The country is therefore uniquely positioned to build bridges and foster consensus to accelerate inclusive climate progress.\n\nThe UAE is the first country in the region to ratify the Paris Agreement, the first to commit to an economy-wide reduction in emissions, and the first to announce a Net Zero by 2050 strategic initiative, proving its commitment to raising ambition for climate action.\n\nLearn more about how the UAE is addressing climate change in close cooperation with the United States."
