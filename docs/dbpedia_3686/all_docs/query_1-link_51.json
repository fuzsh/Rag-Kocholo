        "text": "Jacobs announced its intent this spring to spin off its CMS business to create two separate companies.\n\nUpon completion, John Heller, current CEO of Amentum, will serve as CEO of the combined company, overseeing a newly-formed business with $13 billion in annual revenue.\n\nOnce merged, the company will have more than 53,000 employees globally, 27,000 of which have government security clearances. More than 80% of its contracts will be with government clients. It will have a combined $50 billion in contracted backlog work.\n\nThe transaction will be a Reverse Morris Trust, which means it will be tax-free to Jacobs’ current shareholders. Jacobs will retain a small stake in the combined company.\n\nThe merger is expected to close next year.\n\nJacobs will be a separate publicly-traded company that focuses on its data solutions and digital technologies business.\n\nAmentum itself was formed through a spin-off in 2020, of the management services group of AECOM. Amentum acquired McLean-based DynCorp International in late-2020. In 2022, it acquired Arlington-based PAE Inc."
