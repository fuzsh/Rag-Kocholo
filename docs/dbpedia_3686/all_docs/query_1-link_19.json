This guide focuses on the best databases the Commerce Research Library has to offer for corporate profiles and corporate family research.\n\nIf you're looking for where a company or subsidiary is officially registered check their location in one of the database below and then check the official government website for the relevant state to find official documentation. Here is an example of the Delaware website, a popular state where many companies register.\n\nDatabases can provide incomplete and conflicting information. Use clues like shared company names, shared executives, and shared websites to determine if two entities are connected even if they do not appear to have a parent/subsidiary relationship."
