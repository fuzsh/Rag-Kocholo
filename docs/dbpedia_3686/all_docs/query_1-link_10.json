Tech titan Microsoft (MSFT), based out of Washington, isn’t too far behind at $2.79 trillion.\n\nYahoo Finance compiled a list of the biggest publicly traded companies in each state and Washington, D.C., based on market cap and the location of companies' headquarters as of 2023.\n\nHealthcare giants at the top\n\nHealthcare is the dominant sector among the largest companies in the US, including health insurance giants Humana (HUM) in Kentucky at $56.1 billion and UnitedHealth (UNH) out of Minnesota at $485.49 billion.\n\nThe Northeast is home to several of those companies, along with other big healthcare names like CVS Health (CVS) based out of Rhode Island and valued at $101.61 billion, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in New Jersey and valued at $376.93 billion, and Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) in Massachusetts and valued at $205.91 billion.\n\nOther biotech companies on the list include Indiana's Eli Lilly (LLY), valued at $552.87 billion, and Illinois' AbbVie Inc.

Charlotte, North Carolina, a hot spot in the financial services industry, is home to the headquarters of Bank of America (BAC), which is the most highly-valued company in the state at $268.12 billion.\n\nThe tech sector saw significant representation among the largest publicly traded companies with eight standing out as the most valuable in their states including semiconductor giant Micron (MU), based out of Idaho, and Marvell Technology (MRVL), based out of Delaware.\n\nTesla (TSLA), which left California for the more tax-friendly Texas back in 2021, is the Lone Star State’s most valuable company with a value of $804.84 billion.\n\nRetail giants Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) are the biggest in Arkansas and Georgia, respectively.
