        "text": "On August 2, 2024, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Xie Feng was interviewed byâTom O'Connor, Senior Foreign Policy Writer fromâNewsweekâtoâelaborate onâthe third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the CPC. The transcript was published on the front page of the weeklyâsâwebsite on August 5. The main contents are as follows:\n\nNewsweek: What were some of the most significant themes andâmessages that emerged out of the latest third plenum?\n\nAmbassador Xie Feng: The overriding theme of the 20th thirdâplenum of the CPC Central Committee is further deepening reformâcomprehensively to advance Chinese modernization. The adoptedâresolution, its most important outcome, is exactly a blueprint forâthis. In the resolution, \"reform\" as a keyword appeared 145 times,âand \"opening-up\" 35 times.\n\nSince the start of China's reform and opening-up, there have beenâtwo third plenums with epoch-making importance: one is the 11thâin 1978, which ushered in a new period of reform, opening up,âand socialist modernization; the other is the 18th in 2013, whichâmarked the start of comprehensively deepening reform in the newâera with systemic and holistic planning.\n\nThe 20th third plenum is also a landmark event. The message isâclear: China's efforts in reform and opening-up will never stop. AsâPresident Xi Jinping pointed out, \"If we are to break new groundâin advancing Chinese modernization on the new journey in the newâera, we must continue to rely on reform and opening up.\"â\n\nThe world today is a fluid and turbulent one. The outlook for theâglobal economy looks increasingly uncertain. Every country isâfacing its own challenge. How should we respond? While someâcountries resort to scapegoating others with a beggar-thy-neighborâapproach, China's choice is to reform itself on all fronts, defuseârisks through better institution-building, and seek win-win results.\n\nAt this plenum, over 300 reform measures were rolled out, allâinvolving reforms of systems, mechanisms, and institutions. Weâalso set for ourselves the goal of completing all these reform tasksâby the time the People's Republic of China celebrates its 80thâanniversary in 2029. How many countries are ready to launch suchâlarge-scale reforms with the same commitment and grit?\n\nIt is worth bearing in mind that 46 years have passed since Chinaâstarted its reform and opening-up. In the past, we often \"crossedâthe river by feeling for stones,\" and reforms were mostly focusedâon specific areas. But today, the low-hanging fruits have beenâreaped, the good meat has been eaten, and all that is left are hardâbones to chew. Every policy decision in the Chinese economy, which now contributes over 30% to world growth, has globalâimplications and thus should be made with extra prudence.\n\nAlso, what our people care about now is no longer getting enoughâto eat, but how to eat well; not just making the pie bigger butâdividing it more fairly. So, reforms have to be more targeted,âsystemic and comprehensive. Only in this way can we live up toâthe expectations of the people and the world.\n\nâ\n\nNewsweek: The Chinese economy is currently experiencingâchallenges in consumption, real estate and local governmentâdebt. How will China address these issues?\n\nAmbassador Xie: China is at a pivotal stage for transforming itsâgrowth model and optimizing its economic structure. It is onlyânatural that there will be some growing pains. All these issues haveâarisen in the course of development and transformation, and thereâis no reason why they cannot be overcome. In fact, the history ofâChina's reform and opening-up is exactly one of spotting andâresolving problems.\n\nSo, what is China's solution? This plenum has made it clear: weâwill advance high-standard opening-up and pursue high-qualityâdevelopment. We will continue to invigorate growth throughâreform, unleash productivity, and create stronger impetus forâChinese modernization. We will boost both the supply and the demand. Developing newâquality productive forces will be a priority. This means makingâtraditional sectors higher-end, smarter and greener, fostering newâindustries such as artificial intelligence, aerospace andâbiomedicine, and further integrating digital technology into theâreal economy.\n\nAt the same time, China's consumer market keeps expanding andâupgrading. Last year, consumption contributed 82.5% of China'sâeconomic growth. Our middle-income group, 400-million-strongânow, will double in the coming decade. It is estimated that everyâone percentage point increase in the proportion of the group willâdrive up consumer spending by over $150 billion annually. Also, China's urbanization rate, now at around 66%, is about 14âpercentage points lower than the average level of the developedâcountries. Every one percentage point increase in the number canâgenerate around $140 billion of investment and $28 billion ofâconsumer spending, which will be a strong boost to the propertyâmarket as well.\n\nWe will continue to promote integrated urban-rural development,âcoordinate regional development, and improve the people'sâwellbeing, so as to further bring out the potential of domesticâdemand. Several days ago, China's State Council released aâfive-year action plan for people-centered new urbanization, underâwhich we will move faster to grant permanent urban residency toâpeople who move to cities from rural areas. This means the nearlyâ300 million rural migrant workers will enjoy equal access to basicâpublic services as urban residents.\n\nWe see ensuring stable growth in the short term and sustaining theâmomentum in the long run both important. This month, we willâallocate 300 billion yuan ($41.4 billion) in ultra-long treasuryâbonds to support large-scale equipment upgrades and consumerâgoods trade-ins. In light of the supply and demand changes in theâhousing market, we are fostering a new development model forâthe real estate sector. With a focus on meeting people's demand forâboth essential and better housing, we will provide moreâgovernment-subsidized housing, and give municipal governmentsâgreater decision-making powers to regulate the property market.\n\nTo defuse local government debt risks, we will expand the sourcesâof tax revenue at the local level, so as to place more fiscalâresources at the disposal of local governments. For instance, weâhave set the direction for reforming excise tax collection, and willâgrant greater authority to local governments for tax management,âand expand the scope of use for funds raised from the sale of localâgovernment special-purpose bonds as appropriate. Meanwhile, weâwill establish a monitoring and oversight system to better manageâall local government debt.\n\nâ\n\nNewsweek: Do you believe that China will meet its economicâgrowth goal of around 5% this year in spite of theseâchallenges?\n\nAmbassador Xie: China's economy is now on a path ofâhigher-quality development that is more efficient, equitable andâsustainable. In the first half of this year (H1), it rebounded in bothâquantity and quality. The GDP grew 5% year over year, outpacingâmany other major economies. The quarter-on-quarter GDP growthârate moved up for eight consecutive quarters. Altogether, 39 out ofâthe 41 major industrial categories recorded an increase in the addedâvalue.\n\nChina's industries are also more innovative and greener. Investment in high-tech sectors grew 10.6% in H1. New growthâengines are booming, with the output of smart, green productsâincluding integrated circuits, service robots, electric vehicles andâsolar cells all growing in double digits. Bloomberg projectedâChina's tech industries to account for 23% of GDP by 2026. Aânumber of international institutions including the IMFâhave revised China's growthâforecast for 2024 to 5% or above.\n\nUndoubtedly, the Chinese economy is still facing many challenges. But the fundamentals sustaining its steady and long-term economicâgrowth will not change. The expanding manufacturing industryâwill bolster the supply. Summer travel, school reopening, theâNational Day holiday, as well as investment to shore up weakâlinks and in new arenas will all unlock robust demand. Theâupgrading of traditional sectors and the rise of emerging ones willâcreate strong impetus. And measures like ultra-long specialâtreasury bonds and special-purpose bonds will provide policyâsupport. So, we are confident that we will not only accomplish the targetsâfor economic and social development this year, but also buildâmomentum for sustainable development in the long run.\n\nâ\n\nNewsweek: As China pursues its opening-up in this unstableâenvironment, do you believe that this plenum puts lessâemphasis on the market and more on the government'sâinfluence on the economy?\n\nAmbassador Xie: How to strike a balance between the governmentâand the market is a universal challenge. China's approach is toâpromote both an efficient market and an effective government. Weâgive full play to the decisive role of the market, as the \"invisibleâhand,\" in allocating resources, so that the allocation will be asâefficient and productive as possible. Meanwhile, we also seek toâbetter leverage the \"visible hand\" of the government by improvingâmacroeconomic governance, so as to better maintain order in theâmarket, remedy market failures, and unleash creativity acrossâsociety.\n\nThis plenum reaffirmed we will see that the market plays theâdecisive role in resource allocation and that the government betterâfulfills its role. It also outlined plans to remove barriers to marketâaccess, promote market-oriented reform of production factors,âand refine the systems underpinning the market economy. In lineâwith the resolution, we will deepen reform of state capital andâSOEs, and advance market-oriented reform in the competitiveâareas of sectors including energy, railway, telecommunications, water conservancy, and public utilities. We will also create moreâopportunities for the non-public sector, formulate a private sectorâpromotion law, and ensure that economic entities under all formsâof ownership have equal access to production factors, compete onâan equal footing, and are protected by the law equally.\n\nAll these speak volumes about China's commitment toâmarket-oriented reform. We will continue to promote betterâinterplay between the two \"hands\" to unlock developmentâpotential.\n\nâ\n\nNewsweek: There is also significant unrest across the globe. How will this turbulent and increasingly unstable environmentâaffect China's efforts to reform and open up?\n\nAmbassador Xie: As some countries keep closing doors, buildingâwalls and seeking decoupling, openness is in short supply globally. But China is opening up more doors, building more bridges, andâreaching out to share reform and development benefits with theâworld. To quote a Chinese poem that describes the bamboo, \"It isâstrong and firm though struck and beaten without rest; careless ofâthe wind from north or south, east or west.\" No matter how theâworld may change, China will continue to do the right thing. Weâare committed to embracing the world with open arms, and weâexpect the world to open up to us alike.\n\nOpening-up is the hallmark of Chinese modernization. Thisâplenum introduced many concrete measures in this regard. Restrictions will be reduced. We will further shorten the negativeâlist for foreign investment, remove all market access restrictionsâin the manufacturing sector, and fully apply the negative list forâcross-border trade in services. More areas will be opened up. Weâwill steadily expand institutional opening-up, and create anâinstitutional environment that is transparent, stable, andâpredictable in alignment with high-standard international economicâand trade rules. We will, on our own initiative, open up wider inâsectors including telecommunications, the internet, education,âculture and medical services. We will also further level the playingâfield. Domestic and foreign-invested enterprises will be treatedâequally, and we will ensure national treatment for the latter inâterms of access to production factors, license application, andâgovernment procurement.\n\nA more open China will bring more market and growthâopportunities to the world. International investors are seizing theâmomentum and voting with their feet. In H1, 26,870 newâforeign-invested companies were set up in China, up by 14.2%. Foreign investment in actual use reached nearly 500 billion yuanâ($69.8 billion), a relatively high level over the past decade.\n\nTesla is building another factory in Shanghai, and it took only aâmonth to negotiate and conclude the deal. Apple has establishedâR&D centers in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Suzhou, andâdoubled the number of its R&D staff in China over the past fiveâyears. BMW's largest production base and second-largest R&Dâsystem are both in China. According to a recent report by theâChina Council for the Promotion of International Trade, over 40%âof the surveyed foreign-invested companies see China's market asâmore attractive, and nearly 50% expect their profit margins toâincrease in the next five years, with American companies beingâthe most optimistic.\n\nAll these have proven that China is not only the world's factory,âbut also the world's market. In addition to \"made in China,\" weâare seeing more \"smartly made in China.\" China continues to be aâmajor engine of global growth, and also an unparalleledâinvestment destination that remains undervalued. We welcomeâmore businesses to invest in China, stay committed to China, andâgrow with China.\n\nNewsweek: Chinese media expressed overwhelmingly positiveâreviews of the meeting, while a number of Western outlets wereâcritical. What do you believe is the reason behind this gap?\n\nAmbassador Xie: Seeing is believing. The best way to understandâa country is to be there. In recent years, China is offering visa-freeâentry to more and more countries and regions. Citizens from 54âcountries, including the United States, can now enjoy theâ72/144-hour visa-free transit policy. Many foreign friends haveâseized the opportunity to experience China. In H1, foreignânationals made a total of 14.63 million inbound trips to China, upâby 152.7% from the same period last year, among which theânumber of visa-free entries surged 190%.\n\nAs many may have noticed, \"city or not city (meaning \"isn't thisâcool or not\"),\" a catchphrase coined by an American vlogger whenâtouring China, has gone viral, and \"China Travel\" videos haveâbeen a big hit on social media. The tourists dived into a food spreeâat local night markets, went on a city walk, took a cruise trip,âand rode the high-speed rail. Some also joined in square dancing,âtried a self-driving taxi, and had food delivered by drones. Whatâthey have seen is an open, safe, vibrant, welcoming andâdynamic China. Many marveled \"China is not at all what Iâexpected,\" and recorded through their lens \"the China Westernâmedia won't show you.\" A comment under one of the videos saidâthat \"China isn't our enemy...We share the planet and we need toâlearn how to do it peacefully as co-citizens.\"\n\nWe welcome more Americans to visit, study, live and work inâChina. A lot has been done to facilitate this: American applicantsâfor the tourist visa no longer need to provide flight tickets, hotelâbookings, itinerary and invitation letters. Those eligible for aâten-year multi-entry visa can be allowed a longer duration of stay. And it takes only four working days for qualified applicants to getâtheir visas. The resolution of this plenum also called for making it easier forâoverseas visitors to live, receive medical services, and makeâpayments on China's mainland. Shortly after the plenum, theâMinistry of Commerce and six other government departmentsâissued a circular on further facilitating accommodation forâoverseas travelers in China. We will do more to encourageâpeople-to-people exchanges, and give foreign tourists a betterâexperience in China. To all American friends, you are most welcome to embark on anâon-a-whim trip to China, and meet an amazing country beyondâyour imagination!"
