        "text": "Nationals Park is the home of the Washington Nationals. It’s an open-air ballpark just south of the U.S. Capitol. The baseball season climate in Washington, DC is best characterized as hot and humid, making the choice of seating a critical decision for fans seeking gameday comfort. Fans attending a ballgame can consult this guide to identify the best shaded seats at Nationals Park.\n\nWhere are the shaded seats at Nationals Park?\n\nGenerally, the seats in the shade at Nationals Park are located:\n\nLeft Field Mezzanine: Shaded for afternoon and evening games\n\n3rd Base Line: Gets shade in the late afternoon and evening\n\n400-Level Upper Rows: Shaded under the roof\n\nFor the 2024 season, the Nationals typically play day games (1:35 p.m.), late afternoon games (4:05 p.m.), and evening games (6:45 p.m.). For specific details about sections and different start times, please continue reading.\n\nNationals Park Orientation to the Sun\n\nNationals Park is oriented to the northeast, similar to the ballparks in Baltimore and Los Angeles. Each morning the sun rises behind right field, curves around home plate around lunchtime, and sets in the evening behind left field corner. This orientation makes the 3rd base line the “shade side” of the ballpark and the 1st base line and outfield the sunny spots.\n\nThe graphic below shows the approximate location of the sun throughout the day on July 1st (halfway through the MLB season).\n\nSeats in the Shade at Nationals Early Afternoon Games\n\nDay games at Nationals Park occur during the hottest part of the day when the fewest seats are in the shade. Shade seekers should avoid left field sections 100-107 and right field sections 222-243, as they remain sun-drenched throughout the game. The 300-level is almost entirely exposed to the sun for day games as well. While most seats in the 100-level will be sunny, shade seekers can choose seats far back in the 3rd base sections 110-117, which are under cover and provide some relief.\n\nAs the afternoon progresses, more seats in 3rd base sections 110-117 will become shaded. Mezzanine sections 201-205, being mostly covered, are a good option for avoiding the sun. Sections 138-139 behind the Nationals bullpen are under cover and excellent for shade. Nearby in sections 140-143, rows in the back half of the section should be shaded for most of an afternoon game, though seats closer to the field will be sunny. For those who don’t mind the upper deck, sections 401-409 are mostly under cover and offer protection from the sun.\n\nSeats in the Shade at Nationals Late Afternoon Games\n\nFans have a much easier time finding a shaded seat for a 4:05 game. Most seats on the 3rd base side of the park will be shaded, if not immediately at first pitch, then within a few innings. Left field sections 100-107 and right field sections 222-243 remain largely sunny and are less desirable for shade seekers. The 1st base side of the park is also sunny, though seats closer to home plate will start receiving shade over the course of the game.\n\nRight field seats are particularly poor choices as the setting sun behind 3rd base shines directly toward them. 3rd base sections 110-117 and 201-205 are mostly shaded. Seats closer to the field may start sunny but will become shaded as the evening progresses. For budget-conscious fans seeking shade, sections 401-409 are a good value.\n\nSeats in the Shade at Nationals Evening Games\n\nDon’t assume that evening games are completely safe from the sun. In June and July, sunset in Washington, DC occurs around 8:30 PM, and with earlier start times and shorter games thanks to MLB’s new pace-of-play rules, some sections are sunny for the first several innings. Right field sections 222-243 are particularly affected; as the sun sets, fans stare directly into the sun. If you choose seats in right field, investing in a strong pair of sunglasses is advisable.\n\nReady to buy shaded seats at Nationals Park?\n\nUse the individual game links or click or tap here to see the Nationals upcoming game list.
