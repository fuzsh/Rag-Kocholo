        "text": "The Washington Nationals are a Major League Baseball team located in Washington, DC., who play in the Eastern Division of the National League. The Nationals won the division in 2012 and 2014 and finished both years with the best winning percentage in the league. In 2019, the Nationals won the National League Championship Series and, for the first time, the World Series. The Nationals were formerly called the Montreal Expos and relocated to the capital of the United States after the 2004 season. The team was owned by the American real estate developer Ted Lerner before his retirement in 2018, when he handed over the role to his son, Mark D. Lerner.\n\nThe franchise value of the Washington Nationals has been increasing steadily in recent years, reaching around two billion U.S. dollars in 2022, compared to 480 million U.S. dollars in 2012. This estimated value in 2022 is marginally lower than the average MLB franchise value, which stands at just over 2.07 billion U.S. dollars. The team generated about 322 million U.S. dollars in revenue in the 2021 season and the operating income of the Nationals for that season amount to 36 million U.S. dollars.\n\nCumulative home attendance of the Washington Nationals games reaches well into the millions every year. The team plays its home games at the Nationals Park in Washington, DC, which has been the Nationals’ home since 2008. The average regular season attendance stood at 25 thousand in 2022, having been consistently over 30 thousand between 2012 and 2018. The average ticket price for games of the Nationals has been increasing over the past few years and amounted to almost 49 U.S. dollars for a ticket in the 2022 season. The team’s Twitter and Facebook accounts have over 700 thousand fans and followers each."
