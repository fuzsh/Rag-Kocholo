        "text": "At the heart of Nationals Philanthropies is a simple purpose with resounding impact –foster a culture of philanthropy in the DMV.\n\nAs the official charitable arm of the Washington Nationals, Nationals Philanthropies is a new entity that replaces the Dream Foundation. Building on the success of the foundation’s first decade in Washington, we aspire to an even bolder, more ambitious philanthropic vision that continues to align with the work of the Youth Baseball Academy while building an enhanced and cohesive platform for civic engagement that extends far beyond the Academy walls.\n\nOur new platform will catalyze the energy of Nationals fans, and the generosity and philanthropic goals of Nationals players, corporate champions, and community partners to invest philanthropic dollars with, through, and to Nationals Philanthropies –fueling even greater good for a better Washington region.\n\n1. Foster a culture of philanthropy in the DMV\n\nServe as a civic partner for Washingtonians interested in making a positive difference\n\n2. Grow and leverage philanthropic resources\n\nInvest in social service organizations through capital investments and strategic partnerships\n\n3. Deliver and scale community-based programs\n\nAdvance equity for area residents through community based programs and neighborhood development."
