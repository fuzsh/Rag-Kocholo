        "text": "International Tax Accountants | Master Your Tax Situation\n\nAre you looking for a US CPA firm that specializes in international tax? Welcome to The Wolf Group. As Certified Public Accountants, we work exclusively on international tax matters. That’s why individuals with cross-border tax issues and international business owners have trusted us with their tax planning and tax preparation since 1983.\n\nIs it time to correct your foreign asset reporting?\n\nMinimize your global tax liability?\n\nResolve an issue with the IRS?\n\nWe can help.\n\nWhy We Specialize in International Tax\n\nIn 1983, we started as a typical CPA firm, doing tax, audit, and accounting. However, early on, there was a demand for tax support for international organization employees in the Washington, DC area. These organizations, such as the World Bank and IMF, have a special status under the IRS tax code because they don’t really fall under any one country’s jurisdiction. Supporting this population was our first foray into international tax. And very quickly, we shifted our focus to specializing in international and expat tax. For four decades now, we have been doing exactly that.\n\nToday, our clients are international, high-net-worth individuals and privately held businesses with cross-border tax issues. Our clients include G-4 visa holders, US expats, US residents with global assets, foreign nationals, small and mid-sized businesses, and mobile employees.\n\nEvery day, we thoughtfully prepare foreign asset informational reports and correct past tax returns. And we routinely advise on foreign tax credits, tax treaties, tax reform, and IRS amnesty program options.\n\nSince cross-border tax matters have become so complex in recent years, many tax preparers in the US and abroad now outsource their foreign asset reporting and other cross-border matters to us.\n\nHelping Individuals with International Taxation\n\nLet’s face it—the IRS is a complicated institution. Its job is to collect revenue and a portion of that revenue comes from penalties and fines. US expats and individuals with foreign assets are an easy target. The IRS knows that foreign asset and income reporting is complex, and most taxpayers get it wrong. With our international tax services, we can help you avoid harsh penalties, optimize your tax position, and deal with IRS headaches.\n\nWe can help you with:\n\nHelping Private Businesses with International Taxation\n\nMaybe you have a “go-to” CPA who handles your routine tax matters. But sometimes international tax issues creep up that are beyond the expertise of the average tax preparer. We get it—and that’s why business owners call us to help them navigate their international tax matters.\n\nWe help privately held businesses plan for international expansion and manage their risk. We assist with the mandatory US tax reporting. Plus, we coordinate with foreign tax advisors to minimize your global tax burden. Our clients include US corporations and partnerships, as well as foreign entities engaged in business in the US.\n\nWe can help you with:"
