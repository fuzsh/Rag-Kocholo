        "text": "The looming sale of the Baltimore Orioles could have a dramatic impact on the future ownership of another MLB team: the Washington Nationals.\n\nThe two teams, which play 40 miles away from each other, have for years been locked in an ongoing legal and financial battle over the Nationals’ media rights. In short, the Orioles control the Nationals’ RSN and the payments the team receives. The conflict dates to the 2004 relocation of the Montreal Expos to Washington, and it proved an impassible roadblock in 2022 when the Nationals’ owners, the Lerner family, hired Allen & Co. to explore a potential sale of the franchise.\n\nThat process has been on hold for nearly a year. Now a group led by billionaire David Rubenstein is set to buy the Orioles—and the team’s control stake in that controversial RSN—from the Angelos family for $1.73 billion. It’s unclear exactly what the new owners plan to do with the network, but given the animosity between the Lerner and Angelos families, any new Orioles ownership is likely progress from a Nationals perspective.\n\nA representative for Rubenstein declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the Nationals didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhen Major League Baseball moved the Expos to Washington—the league owned the team at the time—the relocation drew objection from Orioles. The Angelos family, which has owned the team since 1993, argued that Washington was inside the Orioles’ commercial footprint and that a second team so close could devalue its territorial broadcast rights, plus its ability to draw and retain local fans. To settle those fears, MLB brokered a deal whereby the Orioles would control a significant majority stake in a single RSN that would hold the local rights for both teams.\n\nUnder the settlement, the Orioles started with a 90% ownership stake in the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN), with the Nationals holding 10%, with that split gradually dropping to 67%-33% over time. The Nationals’ rights, however, would be locked into the network controlled by the Orioles “in perpetuity.” The two teams have routinely fought, in public and via legal means, about how much the Nationals should receive in rights fees and how the accounting should work.\n\nThe two sides have been far apart. In the period of 2012-2016, for example, the Nationals were paid $198 million but argued that they should have received $478 million. There have been court rulings to re-balance payments from prior years, but the two teams have been unable to reach any agreement that either separates their rights or avoids the perpetual litigation required to sort annual payments.\n\nIn early 2022, when the Lerner family retained Allen & Co., the potential sale drew several serious suitors, among them Rubenstein and Ted Leonsis, owner of the D.C.’s NHL and NBA teams. Most talks stalled for the same reason—the MASN situation—according to multiple people familiar with the process. A number of investors were spooked by the fact that one of the team’s largest income streams (its media rights) was wrapped in so much uncertainty and disagreement. Their valuations of the team didn’t come particularly close to where the Lerners expected it to trade.\n\nThere are a number of different ways the new Orioles owners could dramatically improve the situation. In the most obvious, they could be open to a financial settlement that allows the Nationals out of the MASN deal. It’s also unclear what Rubenstein’s group wants to do with the RSN. The new owners could be open to selling it, which in turn could give the Nationals clarity. (Either of these things may take time—the Rubenstein group is buying almost 40% of the team now, and will buy the rest when 94-year-old Peter Angelos passes).\n\nBut the situation doesn’t necessarily require action as drastic as those two scenarios. The new Orioles owners could decide they don’t want to fight the Nationals in court for the duration of their ownership. If they’re able to build a relationship with the Nationals that gives the D.C. team an acceptable predetermined payment structure, that could boost the value of the Nationals in the eyes of prospective buyers.\n\nLeonsis would be among the most likely interested parties, both for the Nationals or MASN. Not only was he the furthest along in the process in 2022, according to people familiar with the talks, but he has been public about desire to expand his sports/media empire. In addition to the Capitals and Wizards, his Monumental Sports & Entertainment owns their RSN (Monumental Sports Network), Capital One Arena, the WNBA’s Washington Mystics and a number of other sports assets. His stated goal is to build the world’s most valuable regional sports and entertainment company, with an emphasis on regional.\n\n“I will only buy a team that authentically I can say … our platform will be in service to,” Leonsis said at Sportico’s “Invest in Sports” event in October. “So if you’re not in Maryland, Virginia or D.C., I’m not interested in the team.”\n\nA representative for Monumental declined to comment on any potential interest in the Nationals or MASN.\n\nTwo of the other suitors back in 2022 are likely off the table. Rubenstein, of course, is about to own the Orioles, and Stan Middleman bought 16.25% of the Philadelphia Phillies last year.\n\nThe $1.73 billion price that the Rubenstein group paid, however, could work against the Nationals. It’s lower than many in the industry expected, according to The Athletic, and rightful or not, each new sale works as a benchmark for future sales in that league. The Nationals are worth more than the Orioles—Sportico values Baltimore at $1.6 billion and Washington at $2.18 billion—but is that gap big enough to get prospective buyers close enough to the Lerners’ target?\n\nWe may soon find out."
