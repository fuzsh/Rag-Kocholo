        "text": "WASHINGTON — At the Washington Nationals’ home opener in April, Duane Dargin, 9, stood in the center of the diamond beneath sunny skies waiting to throw out the game’s ceremonial first pitch.\n\nJust one year earlier, Dargin had never before held a regulation baseball in his hand, nor had he played baseball a day in his life. Dargin’s neighborhood, predominantly African-American and near some of the poorest sections of Washington, is like many urban areas in America where even the children’s parents cannot recall the last time there was a Little League game down the street.\n\n“No one even knows the rules of baseball,” Dargin said.\n\nIt is one of the reasons that only 8.3 percent of players on Major League Baseball rosters last year identified themselves as African-American or black, a 50 percent drop from 20 years ago.\n\nBut on this day, before an announced 42,295 fans, Dargin, who is African-American, toed the pitching rubber, cocked his arm in a full windup and released, hoping for a strike.\n\nDargin got to this point, throwing a pitch in a professional ballpark, through the new Washington Nationals Youth Baseball Academy, a pristine, gleaming $17 million baseball complex that has risen incongruently on the tumbledown streets of southeast Washington.\n\nThe academy, one of several recently established or taking root in major league cities, is an important step for baseball as it confronts its most serious decline in youth participation in decades, particularly among African-Americans.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
