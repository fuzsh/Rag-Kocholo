        "text": "I was too young to experience anything Atari in its heyday. It's particularly surprising as my cousin had an old 2600 and despite going over there and playing video games all the time, I have no memory of ever seeing it, much less playing it. I hadn't even gotten my first game system and the Jaguar had already been discontinued. The closest I got was an old 5200 I found at a Goodwill when I was eight, which I didn't realize wasn't the illustrious original Atari.\n\nI finally nabbed an actual 2600 at a yard sale years after that in my early teens. It was in rough shape though and only had a couple of games that I can't remember outside of Empire Strikes Back. Come to think of it, I'm not sure if I was even able to get it to work as I don't think it came with the power supply. Later that year, however, my mom surprised me with a really nice 2600 set she found at a yard sale. It was in far better shape, came with the power supply, all of the manuals and documentation, a bunch of games (most of which were complete in box), and even had a nice wood storage shelf for it. She also got me a similarly complete Atari 800XL set with accessories, games, and the like at that same yard sale.\n\nIt was really exciting to finally dig into the 2600 after years of hearing about it. I'm not going to lie though; it was a bit more primitive than I was expecting--even compared to the Atari 5200. And the NES was light years ahead of it. Not that all of the games were bad, but the simplicity did take some getting used to. I've found that if you didn't grow up with the console games from that era, they can be more of an acquired taste. I suppose that's why pricing of 2600 stuff and other games from that era stayed relatively flat the past few years while everything else skyrocketed. It's a shame though as taking it into context and going in with an open mind, I was still able to find plenty of enjoyment with them. I still have most of my 2600 stuff too, but I admittedly haven't really played much of it lately.\n\nAlso, nice avatar verygooster\n\nMy dad owned one. He never once brought it up, only talking about it once I brought it up, after I had realized what it was I had seen in the basement, well over a decade after growing up. It was in my childhood home for decades, but I never realized it. I only spotted it buried in the basement once or twice. My mind classified it as some sort of office storage equipment--maybe a filing folder mixed with an antique rolltop desk. It had the look of that old-timey wood paneling and black plastic \"grout\" look I associated with old furniture, so I didn't even realize in the slightest what it was.\n\nMany years later, I came across it again and was like... oh, this is a game console (it helped that for the first time one of the joysticks was visible next to it). I still didn't know WHICH console it was, because I grew up after the videogame collapse so had no point of reference for that generation of videogames. I was very busy at the time, so I didn't pull it out and investigate or use it. My dad should still have it, he's a pack-rat, so I should see if it still works next time I'm there.\n\nAnd still, I've never played on an actual Atari 2600. I have the Atari Vault collection on Steam. Thoughts:\n\n-Adventure is kinda decent if you think of it as multi-screen Pacman with mysteries.\n\n-Warlords is still genuinely very fun even today, trying to manipulate the bots or take out the best one first. Or pick another bot to be your \"ally\" and try to \"work together\" until you have to turn on each other. The match becomes more and more frantic as your wall whittles away. Atari should do one of their Recharged remasters for this one.\n\n-Don't think before now, I had played a videogame with no end state. Yars' Revenge may have been my first (not sure if I'm even correct on this). Atari games had such limited memory, that sometimes devs just gave more or less a small playpen with no end state. Just play until you've had your fill. (Going off memory, maybe this is wrong).\n\n-For awhile I was very confused at the graphical difference between some games, eventually realizing some of these games were Atari arcade cabinets and thus had access to tons more processing power. At first, I was like, \"Why does Adventure look so bad, wasn't this one of the flagship titles?\" \"Was the Atari 7800 really so much more powerful?!\" I thought the arcade Atari games were 7800 games at first; \"Wow, what a big leap!\"\n\n-I still adore Galaga. I first played it on an NES. It still shines on the Atari 2600 version. Perhaps the only arcade game I've ever loved. I generally have no great enthusiasm for classic arcade games in a sort of \"oh, that was a nice 10 minutes I guess,\" way, then I rarely return. But I returned to Galaga so many times as a kid.\n\n-I played a good chunk of Atari Vault last year. I have some other classic \"arcade\" collections too. I think I'll continue playing old arcade games I've never seen before this year. I've enjoyed it as a kind of exercise in being a cultured citizen dutifully visiting a museum or something."
