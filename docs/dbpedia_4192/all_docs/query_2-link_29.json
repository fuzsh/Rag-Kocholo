        "meta_description": "The RetroHQ Mega 7800 is a controller adapter which allows you to use your Master System and Mega Drive controllers with your 7800 or 2600. This includes Master System control pads, joysticks and also the light phaser as well as 3 and 6 button Mega Drive pads and sticks. In normal operation the Mega 7800 lets you play 2 button 7800 and 2600 games with a more comfortable pad. In extended mode (where software has been written to take advantage of the Mega 7800) the 7800 is able to read all of the buttons available on the controller for additional gameplay control!* The 7800 GameDrive in combination with the Mega 7800 uses the Mega Drive control pads to allow single button breaking into games (START), saving (Z) and loading (Y) of your games. This allows for the full retro gaming experience with the added comforts of an emulator! Truly the best of both worlds. * Extended operation is currently only supported on the 7800, but should be possible to access from 2600 homebrew also.",

        "text": "RetroSix is a family run business led by Luke, who has been in the gaming industry and retail business since 2013, and sold consoles, controllers and even designed our own controllers and consoles.\n\nWe repair and upgrade consoles while showing them off on our social channels such as TikTok.\n\nWe sell products for restoring your own consoles should you wish to do it yourself, including many of our own hardware we design and manufacture in-house.\n\nFinally, we print directly onto products to create unique one-off designs of things like Game Boys, Game Gears and anything that has a relatively flat surface we can print on. Checkout our Printed Products sections to buy some or design your very own.\n\nWe started RetroSix not as a mass market business, instead with the aim of perfection. Recreating moulds of original shells, casting them from quality ABS, redesigning hardware such as power supplies, USB-C, audio and more, to upgrade your consoles to the highest quality available. No cheap junk sold for profit.\n\nPartners\n\nWe believe partnering with other likeminded companies is a great way to help each other out and ultimately make products that are better for the end consumer.\n\nOf course, we sell and ship worldwide direct from source if you would like to purchase direct from anywhere in the world.\n\nUSA: https://www.retrosix.us (* coming soon)\n\nCanada: Magitek Repairs and Restoration (magitekrr.com)\n\nJapan: ヒミツノバ®｜ゲームボーイのバックライトカスタム｜HIMITSUNOVA\n\nAustria: SilentModding.com - Retro Console Modding"
