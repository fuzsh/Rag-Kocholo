        "text": "I typically ignored the difficulty switches while others used them to balance game play. Did you ever consider them a marketing coup?\n\nIn my early days with the Atari 2600, I took the console's simplicity for granted and rarely every checked the position of the Difficulty Switches. On occasion I'd wonder why my cannon, in Space Invaders, was suddenly so fat, but I was far more interested in blasting aliens.\n\nNot just for VCS compatibility. Atari 7800 games can use the Difficulty Switches too!\n\nThe main feature of difficulty switches is to balance game play between players with mismatched skills. The scenario that immediately comes to mind is playing with a younger sibling who hasn't yet mastered the game. Handicapping the experienced player or making the game easier for the novice made it more enjoyable for two such players to compete. That feature on a late 1970s game console is more substantial than one might think. And beckons the question of why such a \"balancer\" wasn't brought to other consoles of that era.\n\nAs an only child I never had occasion to play with a younger sibling or novice player. I ignored those little black switches. Sometimes my friends and I would alter them to add difficulty once a game became too easy. But we never used them to balance game play. I did, however, have a few friends who had to share the family game console with siblings and those switches became quite handy for everyone involved.\n\nIn recent years, I've become an ardent fan of the Atari 7800 and it's backward compatibility leap over the 5200, back to the 2600. The convenience of playing both game libraries on one console saves me time and space. Like a lot of folks, I assumed the difficulty switches were a component of the 2600-compatibility. Not true.\n\nNot many of the originally released 7800 games use the difficulty switches, but quite a few homebrew games and a few prototypes do. My question is - why didn't more early game consoles adopt this feature?\n\nMany modern games have vast settings one can alter to bring all sorts of change to the experience, but they're not geared toward balanced play as much as for customization. The simplicity of a difficulty switch is what makes me wonder why this feature didn't become standard on more consoles of the 80s era.\n\nThe Marketing Angle of Difficulty Switches\n\nRarely would any of my friends talk about these switches nor how they facilitated balanced game play with their little sister, but that element has great marketing potential! Your little brother or sister never wants to lose and they certainly don't want to be decimated by an elder. That scenario creates tension over who's turn it is to play Atari. Not fun for players or parents.\n\nNaturally, kids want to play video games with their friends as opposed to their younger siblings, but most players know that 2-player games are always better. Using the Difficulty Switches to balance the gaming skills makes those sessions a lot more fun. When everyone is having fun, good times ensue.\n\nDifficulty Switches could introduce an array of cool game options!\n\nI see the inclusion of Difficulty Switches as a means to bring more unity to the game console. The Atari 2600 was the first console, using game carts, that really caught on and dominated the market. Something as simple as balancing the skills-gap in video games can make them more appealing to a wider audience. This was a bigger deal in the 1970s when we realized the TV could offer interaction, not just passive viewing.\n\nThe simplicity of flipping a switch to alter global game play seems like a concept other developers would want to replicate. I'm also a bit surprised that Atari devs didn't use these switches for other purposes. It seems like an interesting way to offer more options in any game. Check your manual next time you're playing a VCS or 7800 game and see if those difficulty switches can enhance your session in ways you may not have considered."
