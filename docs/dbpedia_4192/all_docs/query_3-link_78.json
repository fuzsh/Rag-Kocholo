        "text": "The beauty of the best retro game consoles is how they offer an accessible way to play some of the best games ever made, whether its with a handheld or hooked up to a TV. These can include remasters of old games as well as perfectly executed emulation. Best of all, some of these retro consoles are designed as mini recreations of the original consoles. Some of the best retro game consoles below come with pre-installed games and some enable you to download games or plug in cartridges.\n\nIn my list, I've include a mix of mini console replicas of the top games consoles of yesteryear as well as new consoles designed for retro gaming. For example, my top pick is the Evercade EXP that plays collections of classic games, new indie games in the retro style and makes use of modern display tech to deliver a wonderful handheld experience. Another pick is the budget handheld from the same brand, the Super Pocket at No.2 - two new editions with Technos and Atari pre-loaded games are coming in October.\n\nIf you're after something with a little more power then the current crop of the best games consoles - the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S/X - have more retro games, remakes and remasters releasing than ever before. These aren't in my main list of the best retro consoles because they're not designed as retro machines and don't celebrate retro gaming in the same way the bespoke consoles I've selected; those below are playable games consoles and celebrations of iconic product design.\n\nThe Quick List\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nLoad the next 3 products ↴\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nLoad the next 3 products ↴\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nThe best retro game consoles in full\n\nBest retro game console overall\n\nThe Evercade EXP is the perfect blend of modern tech and retro gaming at a sensible price. The handheld comes in two models, the standard white and the limited edition black, but aside from colour these are the same console. The original Evercade (below on my list) remains an excellent device but this new console is weightier, better made, features a beautiful 800 x 480 IPS OLED display, built-in WiFi for and overall feels like a modern console, that just happens to play old games.\n\nThe Evercade EXP uses cartridges loaded with classic games that generally feature some of the best emulation around. Launched with the EXP is the IREM collection and it comes with pre-installed Capcom games; overall you get 24 games, including Street Fighter II, Final Fight, Breath of Fire and R-Type.\n\nThe handheld unique TATE mode - turn it vertically and you can play games as some were intended in the arcades. This is great for shooters like Truxton and it's simple and easy to switch modes. In my Evercade EXP review I did find the slim design of the console made it a little cramped to use TATE mode, but it's a nice option to have for some classic arcade games.\n\nOverall, given you can plug and play all Evercade carts with hits from Atari, Namco, C64, and more, including games and now 32-bit era games, I think the Evercade EXP is the best way to experience retro games. I have one slight niggle: older carts can jam in the new handheld, and this was an issue with the older Evercade too. The newer Evercade EXP Limited Edition has a reworked case that solves this issue, so expect future consoles to make use of this design. But this slight issue doesn't distract from being the best retro console; its OLED display, overall build quality and list of games is superb value.\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest budget retro game console\n\nThe Hyper Mega Tech! Super Pocket is made by the same team behind the excellent Evercade EXP above, and it's compatible with that handheld's library of game cartridges; this amounts to around 45 carts and over 500 games.\n\nWhat makes this smaller Super Pocket so good is the price, at $59 / £49 it's more than half the price of the larger Evercade EXP, but for that you do get a downgrade in features and particularly screen resolution and size. As the name suggests the Super Pocket is, well… pocket-sized.\n\nThis small retro handheld comes in two models, one pre-loaded with 18 Taito arcade games, the other with 12 Capcom games; which you choose will depend on your tastes or if you own some of the games already (Capcom's titles are available on modern games consoles).\n\nOverall the Super Pocket performs really nicely and being able to use Evercade's cartridges is a huge bonus. Our Hyper Mega Tech! Super Pocket review praised this handheld's value for money, and I completely agree, which is why I consider this the best budget retro console you can buy right now.\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest retro game console for new games\n\nThe Evercade VS is the home console version of the Evercade EXP handheld (see my No.1) and brings some interesting design ideas to the retro game console market, notably the cartridge system of the handheld gets a boost as you can slot in two at once. This also unlocks up the Evercade Vs' clever feature - but inserting combinations of cartridges you can unlock hidden games; for example slot in both Toaplan collections to unlock a Mega Drive version of Twin Hawk.\n\nA big part of Evercade VS is you can play multiplayer games. The console comes with two NES-like controllers and the game packs included in the Premium Pack are co-op focused. The Technos Arcade 1 cart, for example, features the excellent Double Dragon 2. Of course this is not quite so unique these days, as other retro consoles on my list also come with two controllers and games that support multiplayer, in particular Sega Mega Drive Mini 2.\n\nWhat's really different about the Evercade VS is it supports new retro-style and indie games. There are regular collections of new games released for Evercade that ape retro gaming but bring new ideas, some are released in collections and others as standalone games. Some are secret unlocks only availble on the VS too, visit the Evercade Secrets webpage to discover how to get them. Cartridges can be shared with Evercade EXP and Super Pocket too, so you can continue your TV big-screen gaming on these handhelds.\n\nAlso unlike other retro consoles on this list the Evercade VS supports a broad list of games from various developers, so it's not Nintendo, Atari or Sega focused. The VS comes in two versions – £89 / $99 for the console with one controller and one cartridge, or £109 / $129 for the console, two controllers and two cartridges – I'd recommend going for this bundle as the multiplayer on older games remains great fun.\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest retro game console for Atari\n\nThe Atari 2600+ is one of the newest retro games console on my list and is a little different to the others here, as it's not a mini and doesn't come with pre-installed games.\n\nThe Atari 2600+ is a unique gaming museum of sorts that is a near full-sized replica of the original 1977 games console and comes with a classic Joystick and a 10-in-1 cartridge loaded with some of Atari's greatest hits, including Adventure, Yars' Revenge and my favourite retro game of all time, Missile Command (some of the best video games of the 80s).\n\nThis is the best retro game console for Atari my list as while there are cheaper options, such as the My Arcade Atari Game Station Pro console, this new one can play old Atari cartridges from Atari 2600 and the Atari 7800. I'd prefer this home 'under-the-TV' option over the new My Arcade Atari Pocket Player Pro too (see the Also Tested section) as being able to play those old carts makes all the difference.\n\nThe chance to play old carts on a new system, on HD TVs, really puts the Atari 2600+ in a league of its own. The only downside to what, I think is the best vintage game console on my list, is it remains a form of emulation so playing old carts can take time to load in (around 10-15 seconds). This is something picked up in our Atari 2600+ review.\n\nIf you're looking to play old Atari games (and new ones, as I expect Atari to release new carts for this) then the Atari 2600+ is a well-made celebration of an iconic games console and the best way to truly experience Atari games on a modern TV.\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest retro game console for Game Boy\n\nThe Analogue Pocket is one of the classier retro game consoles on my list and can play pretty much every Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance cartridge released. This also means the Analogue Pocket isn't an emulation console like the minis on this guide, but plays games off the carts as you would have done years ago.\n\nThis is such a lovingly well-made retro console. The display is a vibrant 3.5-inch, 615 ppi, LCD screen with a 160 x 1440p resolution - it's a modern display that makes all those old Game Boy games look wonderful - something we noted in our Analogue Pocket review. If you want to play as Nintendo intended you can too, as the Analogue Pocket is capable of replicating the backlight LCD effects, pixel grid patterns and LCD subpixel patterns of the original Game Boy handhelds.\n\nAnalogue has an ecosystem of cables and add-ons too, these enable you to connect two Pockets together or connect to a TV, there's an option to link to a Mac or PC, or even hook up the handheld to MIDI hardware like keyboards, to make use of Analogue's Nanoloop synthesiser tech. There is even a simple developer app created with GB Studio to enable you to make your own games via a drag-and-drop interface.\n\nIf Apple made retro game consoles it would probably make the Analogue Pocket, this is a high-spec, quality gaming handheld that plays a huge back catalogue of classic games, but it also acts as a gateway to game development. All of this comes at a price, this handheld starts at $219.99, and add-ons (including a Game Gear adapter cost around $99). It is why the Analogue Pocket is slightly lower down my list, but if money is no option I'd highly recommend one to everyone.\n\nBest retro game console for Nintendo\n\nThe Nintendo SNES Classic Edition is a wonderful replica mini that enables you to play some of the best games ever made, including Super Mario World, on era-accurate controllers. But its popularity also means this rare retro console can cost three times what it did at launch.\n\nThe SNES was the successor to the NES, with more advanced games. The model you get depends on where you live. US gamers can buy the angular North American Super Famicom version with purple accents and controller buttons. The Super NES version, with its more colourful, rounded design with red, blue, yellow, and green buttons is for UK users. Everything else is pretty much as you remember.\n\nBut what about the games? You'll get 21 fan-favourites with the US and European version of Super NES Classic, and they're all excellent. Be it Super Mario World, Star Fox, or The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, these 16-bit icons are every bit as playable today as they were 30 years ago.\n\nIn play I find almost all of them hold up in terms of visuals and gameplay too, but each one has been boosted with the addition of rewind or suspend options (not to mention the ability to save anywhere). The biggest downside for me is that this replica is very expensive, which is why it's a little lower on my list. Also, you can now play most of the included games on Nintendo Switch with an Online subscription, for less.\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest retro game console for Sega\n\nThe Sega Mega Drive Mini 2 or Sega Genesis Mini 2 (for US) is an excellent follow-up to the previous small retro console, the Sega Mega Drive Mini. This edition features 60 games, including bonus titles that have never been released before. The eye-catching titles, however, are the mix of Sega Mega CD games that feature in the Sega Mega Drive Mini 2's roster.\n\nSega hasn't really offered these late Mega Drive releases before, which is why I'd opted for this over the original Sega Mega Drive Mini. This was a muddled time for Sega as it transitioned from 16 to 32-bit gaming, and it tells. Some games are true generational leaps, such as Virtua Racing, while some use the format to add music and video to older releases, such as The Ninja Warriors. Curiosities include FMV game Night Trap (one of the best FMV games) and shooter Silpheed CD that uses pre-rendered backgrounds. Naturally, Sonic CD is included.\n\nOther notable non-CD games include, Revenge Of Shinobi, Rolling Thunder 2 and Ristar – but everyone can find favourites in a 60-game list. To play these games you get a six-button controller, a recreation of the Sega Mega Drive MK2 controller designed for Street Fighter II, and yes, that game is included. It's a good replica controller and features a nice long two-metre lead. (Read my best retro controllers feature for more accessories.)\n\nAs I mentioned in my Sega Mega Drive Mini 2 review, the only downside to this mini console is it lacks any real game histories or concept art, and the game manuals are accessed off-console via a QR code – but you can download and keep them. But, the games list and emulation is fantastic and more than makes up for any shortcomings.\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest retro game console for Amiga\n\nThe Amiga A500 Mini is a tiny replica of the Amiga 500, the home computer that launched many coders' and developers' careers. Arguably the likes of Team 17 wouldn't exist without this computer. When I wrote my full A500 Mini review I found the general build and responsiveness of the console and its controllers – it supports both a gamepad and mouse – to be excellent.\n\nThe pre-installed games are a mixed bag of classics and curiosities from the late 1980s and as well as some of the best video games of the 90s. I really enjoy dipping back into the likes of Cadaver, Speedball 2 and Alien Breed. Stunt Car Racer remains a forgotten masterpiece and adventure Simon The Sorcerer will impress anyone brought up on LucasFilm point-and-click adventures.\n\nThe downside? The games, while excellently emulated and even support a virtual keyboard and disc swapping, are missing some classics that made Amiga an iconic system. I would love to be able to play Sensible Soccer, The Secret of Monkey Island, and the Cinemaware series of games, for example. Also, some of the best Amiga games are available for the Evercade EXP and Evercade VS higher up on my list, and even includes a dedicated Amiga Collection 1 cartridge - it's why this is lower down my list.\n\nYou can, kind of, as the A500 Mini enables you to download and install games (though you should own the originals). The issue I found in my hands-on is not all games work with this mini console, and some need a lot of adjustments to get the gamepad and virtual keyboard to work properly.\n\nA minor quibble, all in the A500 Mini is one of the best ways to play Amiga games in 2022 (though some classics are on Evercade now as cart collections). It's an easy plug-and-play console that showcases some of the best games of the 1990s, and while you can now play many Amiga games on Evercade, I really like have this replica model as a reminder of the the home computer that influenced so much.\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest retro game console for PlayStation\n\nThe Sony PlayStation Classic released to celebrate Sony's first foray into console gaming landed with the force of a bomb. As well as being immensely popular at the time, the PlayStation established a lineage of machines that continue to dominate the market today. As such, it was inevitable that they'd bring the original back for a lap of honour.\n\nThis re-release reduces the console's size and adds USB and HDMI cable ports. Other than that, it's been left exactly as it appeared in the era of the Spice Girls and Friends. And honestly, why would you change anything about it? It was always a gorgeous machine to begin with thanks to its simple design, friendly oversized buttons, and eye-catching disc tray.\n\nThe replicas of the PlayStation Controllers are just as excellent, and because they are USB can be used on other consoles or PC emulation. It's easy to plug and play, and the package overall is of a high quality.\n\nWhere the PlayStation Classic experience stumbles slightly is with a poorly thought through approach to emulation. When I wrote my PlayStation Classic review I discovered some games played slower than the originals while others appeared blurry and muddy. There are no options to tweak video settings and no background on the games. It's why, despite being a replica of one of the best consoles of all time, it's further down my list, as the likes of Atari, Sega and Evercade are really showing how to do emulation properly.\n\nYet, it's hard not to love this package overall. The games included vary in quality but all have a place in PlayStation's history – Tekken 3, Ridge Racer Type 4, and Metal Gear Solid are excellent. Though it's a shame we don't get Tomb Raider, Crash Bandicoot and other big entries. If you're a Sony PlayStation collector and fan, this remains a unique and lovely way to bring back the feeling of gaming in the 90s.\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest retro game consoles: also tested\n\nIn my intro to this guide I mentioned why I've focused on consoles designed to play retro games; machines that emulate the games but also the design, feel and sensation of replaying an iconic games console. Below are two more examples that are worth checking out.\n\nI also acknowledged if you just want to play retro games, modern consoles are good choices too. Below are some more recommended ways to play classic games.\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest retro game consoles: how to choose\n\nUltimately the best retro games console for you may depend on when you started gaming. After all, there's a nostalgia side to picking the best retro games consoles. If you're a 70s, 80s or 90s kid, you'll probably have a favourite console from back in the day that you would like to relive.\n\nFor me, some retro consoles, like the SNES Classic, Amiga A500 and Atari 2600+ just hit harder. However, other factors to consider are whether the consoles come with inbuilt games, how easy they are to use and how fun the games are to play today. These are all points that i've addressed in my full reviews and in the summaries above.\n\nYou also need to consider whether this is for actually gaming or collecting; the PlayStation Classic for example looks lovely while the SNES Nintendo Classic Mini continues to rise in value because it's so scarcely available.\n\nAnother crucial thing to note is do you want to play these games on your TV or as a handheld. For example, my No.1 choice for best retro games console overall is the Evercade EXP that is the perfect mix of modern tech, emulation, new games and is a wonderful handheld console (it can also be connected to a TV).\n\nI've also included the three modern game consoles, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch in my Also Tested section because these feature more retro games than ever before - read our guide to the best retro game remakes and remasters to see what's coming soon.\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest retro game consoles: how we test\n\nI own, have used, or have reviewed all of the best retro games consoles on my list, so you can trust me when I explain why each is worthwhile. As well as this, I've been gaming since a child and owned, and still own, many of the original versions of the mini replicas listed here, including Atari 2600, Mega Drive, SNES and Amiga 500. I also edited Official PlayStation Magazine for five years and edited other PlayStation magazines, so I know a thing or two about Sony's consoles.\n\nWhen I review a retro games console I spend around two to four weeks with each machine; I test the games and the build quality and because I own the original consoles I am able to compare the emulation to originals.\n\nI've selected the best retro games consoles on my list based on many criteria, from value to quality. I also consider how important the original console and games lists are to their impact on gaming, from the design of the console to the games. Of course, there's the fun factor too.\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest retro game consoles: frequent questions\n\nWhat are retro gaming consoles?\n\nA retro gaming console is a modern device that can play old games on new TVs. These are usually mini replicas of old consoles and come with pre-installed games running on emulation. Some retro consoles are new, such as the Evercade series, that feature new games and emulated titles from the 8, 16 and 32 bit eras. Read our lists of the best games of the 80s and best games of the 90s for inspiration.\n\nWhich retro gaming console is best?\n\nMy list here has a general order to which I consider the best retro gaming console, and these devices can be judged technically on how good the video game emulation is along with build quality and other features.\n\nHowever, with the best retro gaming consoles you are also dealing with nostalgia, so your personal connection to an old system or games may supersede any technical merits.\n\nThis is why outside of best overall and best budget I've ordered retro consoles by make, and then considered price, value and games lineup - for example Sega Mega Drive Mini 2 just pips the previous Sega Mega Drive Mini because the be one is cheaper but also features games not released on Sega retro collections before.\n\nWhy are retro games so expensive?\n\nAs with any media created in the past old video game cartridges and discs are a scarcity. This means values are placed on old games out of production. With video games there is the added consideration of nostalgia and limited print runs of some old games – it means not all great games are worth a lot and some terrible games have since soared in value.
