The only obvious novelty is the design of the casing which is pretty close to the original 2600 while the Retron77 made no attempt at mimicking the original hardware from 1977. As a big 2600 fan I already own the Retron77 but would be willing to buy a 2600+ as long as it delivers a better image on modern HDMI TVs.\n\nPosted on Aug 22nd 2023, 23:54 Reply\n\n#8\n\nchrcoluk\n\nDouble-ClickWired controllers with retro consoles need to stop being a thing.\n\nPlaying old games is all well and good but nobody sits 2 feet away from a tiny CRTs anymore (or wants 10ft long cables).\n\nNo but I sit within 2 feet of my 27 inch LCD. I play with wired controllers usually or wireless in wired mode.\n\nWith that said the wire looks really short and they perhaps could offer a wireless option. As choice is always king.\n\nPosted on Aug 22nd 2023, 23:58 Reply\n\n#9\n\nfreeagent\n\nIn these days of 60+ inch screens, no one wants to sit 3 feet from it :D\n\nPosted on Aug 23rd 2023, 0:15 Reply\n\n#10\n\nAthena\n\nI got no idea why anyone would buy this, when you can get a emulator to play all these games and more for basically free, heck, do a retro steamdeck package and it would have been much better\n\nThat joystick was one of the worst things about the 2600, it broke so often\n\nPosted on Aug 23rd 2023, 0:56 Reply\n\n#11\n\nDr. Dro\n\nAthenaI got no idea why anyone would buy this, when you can get a emulator to play all these games and more for basically free, heck, do a retro steamdeck package and it would have been much better\n\nThat joystick was one of the worst things about the 2600, it broke so often\n\nThe sole purpose of a product like this is to capitalize on the nostalgia of boomers who may have liked this thing in its prime and now find themselves with expendable wealth that Atari is interested on. It was clearly not designed to be either tremendously accurate or particularly faithful, the same recipe followed by the 2017 MD by Tec Toy:\n\nsegaretro.org/Mega_Drive_(2017)\n\nThis machine was either loved or hated, it just depends on your personal point of view. I'd personally enjoy a restored machine with the original circuit board and hardware + a flashcart, but that's me. Fun fact; this company was the licensee for Sega in the 80's and they still manufacture and sell a variant of the Master System to this day. It never really went out of style with poorer families in Brazil.\n\nPosted on Aug 23rd 2023, 2:09 Reply\n\n#12\n\nixi\n\nSo, this is raspberry. Dear Atari, you borked last console release. It will be even worse this time... if you wanna live in console market. Release something with valve or asus rog ally spec console and new games on it too not just oldies.\n\nPosted on Aug 23rd 2023, 6:25 Reply\n\n#13\n\nlexluthermiester\n\nDouble-ClickWired controllers with retro consoles need to stop being a thing.\n\nWhy?\n\nDouble-Clickbut nobody sits 2 feet away from a tiny CRTs anymore\n\nTrue!

I prefer them that way. Latency, not having to worry about battery charge or batteries going bad and whatnot. Not all is rosy about a \"wireless world\".\n\nPosted on Aug 23rd 2023, 6:29 Reply\n\n#14\n\nbearClaw5\n\nAtari solely exists now to monetize someone with nostalia from 77-83.\n\nPosted on Aug 23rd 2023, 6:45 Reply\n\n#15\n\nlexluthermiester\n\nbearClaw5Atari solely exists now to monetize someone with nostalia from 77-83.\n\nIncorrect, but feel free to keep thinking whatever you wish. (Hint, Atari's history extends WELL beyond 1983.)\n\nPosted on Aug 23rd 2023, 7:05 Reply\n\n#16\n\nAusWolf\n\nSelling old consoles with new connectivity is definitely the right move, imo. Just because the new PlayStation or Xbox is out, who said that games for the old one were any worse?\n\nIf Nintendo ever does the same with the NES, so I could play Battle City or Lunar Ball with my dad, like I used to when I was a child, I'm all in!\n\nPosted on Aug 23rd 2023, 8:53 Reply\n\n#17\n\nlemonadesoda\n\nI like retro computing/consoles. Unfortunately, these atari games were rubbish. There were much better arcade games at the time, shame they aren’t licensed for this release. Namco, williams, etc.\n\nPosted on Aug 23rd 2023, 9:09 Reply\n\n#18\n\nixi\n\nAusWolfSelling old consoles with new connectivity is definitely the right move, imo.

Overpriced and weak hardware, no modern games and no old games (like gta san, 4 and 5). Only old ones 2D :D. Look where it is now. They stopped production (last news what I heard).\n\nThey even presented it as home theatre. Twitch, jewtube and so on. Yeah, i could buy raspberry and do the same for 60 bucks...\n\nSadly trying to live from \"that time generation\" kids it is impossible to live. If they want to be relevant. Then they must have at least decent hardware and plenty of other company games.\n\nPosted on Aug 23rd 2023, 9:22 Reply\n\n#19\n\nMarsM4N\n\ntrsttteStill, no reason for the \"10 in 1\" cartridge to exist, make it an almost everything cartridge then\n\nWhen looking at how many games where released for the Atari 2600 (520 games), the offering of 10 games is pretty shallow. :wtf: But the problem today are digital rights. Tons of studios went since then out of business and it's just unclear who to contact for licensing and re-releasing those games.\n\nIt gets even more bland when you look at the \"Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration\" on STEAM, which includes 100+ Atari games. Clearly a better deal. The package doesn't only include Atari 2600 games, though. \"The massive selection of over 100 games spans seven different platforms: Arcade, 2600, 5200, 7800, Atari 8-bit computers, and, for the first time ever on modern consoles, Atari Lynx and Jaguar!\".\n\nAtari 2600 games take very little storage space, you could fit all released games on a little USB stick. Or on a \"open source\" cartridge. If there where demand for it someone would surely develop & release one. But I really don't see it. Would be a very low demand product. Games from back then are also very primitive compared to what we have now, not a huge entertainment factor anymore. However I would love to get them all as a STEAM collection, for historical purpose. Just to dive in into the past I never experienced.\n\nList of games for Atari consoles:\n\nAtari 2600 (520 games), Atari 5200 (69 games), Atari 7800 (59 games), Atari Lynx (71 games), Atari Jaguar (50 games). Also Atari 8-bit family exclusive games (66 games).\n\nPosted on Aug 23rd 2023, 9:33 Reply\n\n#20\n\nNC37\n\nIf this was sub $50 I'd maybe consider since I have a relative's old 2600 games around but, $130...no way.\n\nPosted on Aug 23rd 2023, 9:39 Reply\n\n#21\n\nixi\n\nNC37If this was sub $50 I'd maybe consider since I have a relative's old 2600 games around but, $130...no way.\n\nDon't you want raspberry on steroids for x2 of the price? :D\n\nPosted on Aug 23rd 2023, 9:43 Reply\n\n#22\n\nMarsM4N\n\nbearClaw5Atari solely exists now to monetize someone with nostalia from 77-83.\n\nNot true. ;) Atari acquired Nightdive Studios this year, which made themself a name for remastering older games.\n\n\"Atari plans to use the studio’s technology and publishing expertise to ‘enhance and improve’ games from its substantial back catalog.\" So they are pretty much back in the game.\n\nPosted on Aug 23rd 2023, 9:56 Reply\n\n#23\n\nsLowEnd\n\nI imagine the kind of person who'd buy this probably just wants it as a display piece. Being a functional 2600 emulator box is just icing on the top.\n\nPosted on Aug 23rd 2023, 9:58 Reply\n\n#24\n\nAusWolf\n\nixiYeah... atari last console try was really succesful...

My nostalgia factor overweighs anything else in this case.\n\nPosted on Aug 23rd 2023, 10:57 Reply"
