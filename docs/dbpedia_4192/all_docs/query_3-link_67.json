        "text": "The Atari 7800 still has new games releases after being released 23 years ago outside of being test marketed in 1984 and the games are excellent .\n\nImpressive arcade port of Super Pac-man\n\nAll these games are found at the Atariage Store. The link for the Atari 7800 section is\n\nhttp://atariage.com/store ./index.php?l=product_list&c=23 .\n\nStarBoy91 wrote:\n\nMan, why couldn't the NES have had a Jr. Pac-Man port, or even Pac & Pal? Still, nice! How's Super Pac Man, reminds me of Pac & Pal (which was fun)?\n\nPac & Pal ran on Namco Super Pac-Man hardware and I think it is one of the reasons why Super Pac-man reminds you of Pac & Pal.\n\nThe Nes didn't get a Jr. Pac-man port because of the unauthorized status of this game. Bally Midway created the game without the authorization of Namco. I don't about why for Pac & PAl besides being the rarest pac-man arcade game.\n\nTurbo+Genesis+64 wrote:\n\nImagine how incredible Road Blasters, Pacmania, and Vindicators would be for the 7800, if they were done right.\n\nIt is ironic you said Pacmania. When the author of Jr. Pac-man was working on the game, people on Atariage had a list of pac-man games that wanted the author to do next including Pacmania. The other pac-man games mentioned at the time by other Atariage members were Pac-land, Baby Pac-man, and Pac & Pal.\n\nThe author of Jr. Pac-man is responsible for all the Atari 7800 Pac-man games found at the Atariage store and that is were people on Atariage wanted the author to do another Pac-man game.\n\nThe author of Jr. Pac-man is currently taking a break from doing homebrew games due to something outside of the internet. All I know is that the person's next game is not a pac-man game. The game is called Failsafe. Failsafe actually is the Atari 5200 game Countermeasure. I am not familiar with the game since I never played or own an Atari 5200 game console.\n\nThe author does do games that aren't that part of the Pac-man series of games time to time for the Atari 7800"
