        "text": "Atari is unleashing a blast from the past with the upcoming launch of the Atari 2600+ on 17 November. This revamped relic of gaming history is set to be priced at US$129.99 and is up for pre-orders right now. The device promises to rekindle those nostalgic memories of pixelated adventures, similar to what the LEGO Atari 2600 console did for the brand’s 50th anniversary last year.\n\nThis retro revival comes in the form of a pint-sized powerhouse, retaining 80 percent of the original’s charisma while adding modern marvels like HDMI output and USB-C ports. But don’t let the compact form fool you. Nestled within this gaming device is the Rockchip 3128 SoC, a quad-core powerhouse that, while having a few years under its belt, still packs quite a punch.\n\nThe Atari 2600+ comes bundled with a 10-in-1 game cartridge, giving players a bite-sized buffet of retro delights. And that’s not all, the console flexes its versatility muscles by accommodating both 2600 and later 7800 game cartridges.\n\nBut what’s the use of revisiting the past without the original controllers? Thankfully, the Atari 2600+ plays nice with the original joystick and paddle controllers. Players who want to add more controllers can look towards Atari’s CX40 Plus joystick and the CX30 Plus replica paddle controller."
