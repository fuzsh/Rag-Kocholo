        "text": "Yes, friends, it's another Retronauts listener mail solicitation.\n\nYes, friends, Bob and I will be returning to Midwest Gaming Classic this coming weekend, and in addition to presenting a panel and challenging as many as 15 people to Faceball 2000 deathmatches, we'll also be recording some podcasts on-site. The first of these will be one we've been planning since last year: An Atari 7800 retrospective with our friend, co-panelist, and favorite* Atari 7800 collector and expert Kevin Bunch.\n\nIn fact, our 7800 conversation was originally going to be our panel for this year, but we ultimately decided it made more sense as a separate recording in a more relaxed setting. But we hope to cover the system from top to bottom: Its history, its strengths, its weaknesses, and its best (and maybe worst) games. Kevin owns them all at this point, I think, so he'll have plenty to say!\n\nBut, of course, a podcast is always more fun when we can get the Retronauts community involved, so we're opening up comments and email to 7800 enthusiasts. Drop me a line at jparish [at] retronauts.com or leave a message in the comments below before this weekend to contribute to the show! Whether you have fond memories of being the one kid at school with a 7800 or have a favorite game you discovered years after the fact, it's all good.\n\n* Except for you. And you. Yes, we still love you all.\n\nHeader image by Evan Amos."
