        "text": "Atari Box Teaser Site\n\nWhat?! What the heck am I seeing here? What is this? WHAT IS THIS?\n\nAtari has managed to get my attention, by teasing a completely unknown product, with very little in the way of details. Just about all I’m sure of is that the Atari logo is featured prominently. Apparently some manner of Atari hardware platform is going to be released. What type of platform? Don’t know. What software will it support? Don’t know. Is it even going to be a home console of some sort? No idea.\n\nThis is an incredibly vague reveal. They are implying a fair amount, but have overtly stated just about nothing. It’s maddening, and my curiosity is driving me crazy.\n\nSays it is PC-based… maybe with some luck we can get a batch of cool games like these… basically the same resolution but allow more colors and of course much more storage space and much faster CPU and graphics.\n\nSuch an excellent variety of games and ideas back then. And when I spent time in the archives of those old games I find that I am increasingly appreciative of all of the “little Indies” (the solos and 2 people teams). Because I couldn’t help but think of my Steam library that contains many games that look not too different from these.\n\nI’ve been waiting for this Indie game for a long time and release is very soon! Dude’s been working on it for over 5 years.\n\nAh well Atari probably won’t make a console for all of the developers and gamers who create and play games like Rush to Adventure but it’d kind of be cool if they did.\n\nOf course… there was the Retro VGS and we know how that went but then again there is the one that plays PICO-8 games and seems like a good number of people have bought that one.\n\nI’m guessing that it will be some gimmicky paraconsole like Ouya or just some trendy retro nonsense like NES mini.\n\nIt would be quite the spectacle to see them flounder with trying to make a successful modern console. They’ve made five consoles now and exactly one of them was a success. Then they immediately tanked the video game industry.\n\nAnd yes, I know that Atari is like ten times removed from 2600 era Atari. But still.\n\nStill, I bet I could run a successful console brand if I had $1 billion to work with.\n\nGiven the nostalgia factor alone, as long as it is a modern console, I think I’d be just as excited to have Atari back in my living room as I was when I got the 2600 at 5 years old. Old Fogies like me love things that make us feel like our youth isn’t so far away after all. Now if I could just walk into a Best or a Montgomery Ward to buy it.\n\nFor a company that is attempting to make yet another return from bankruptcy? Focusing their console on virtual reality would be far too risky. It’s simply too much of a fad at this point in time and the required hardware is too costly for their console. Best case scenario their console would end up costing the same as a PlayStation or Xbox.\n\nChoosing between an effectively no name console brand and a well established brand that your friends are likely to have too is a no brainer if the consoles are very similarly priced. Atari will have to be far cheaper than their competitors and have good exclusives to have any hope of success."
