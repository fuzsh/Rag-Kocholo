        "text": "I got my 2600+ from FedEx yesterday. My initial impressions are that it does feel like it is built really well although I was a little surprised at how small the length of screws used were for holding it all together. For those that didn't know, all of the guts of the 2600+ are located in the switch panel section of the unit. It uses a couple of different PCBs sandwiched and connected together to do everything.\n\nHere are my Pros thus far:\n\nThe cartridge slot is actually quite nice and seems to have a good connection with the games I've tested it with. But do make sure you clean any of your old cartridges you haven't used in a while to be sure that you are allowing as good a connection as possible and to prevent adding any crud from your old carts into the 2600+.\n\nThe switches are kinda amazing on this thing?! They have a very satisfying click to the power and color/bw switch and the select and reset have a point where you can feel them engage and their spring back action is very nice. It makes me wonder if the switches can be adapted to OEM consoles...\n\nMy 2600+ shipped set to 16:9 mode. This will result in that fully stretched image that some like and some do not. I prefer to NOT have that stretched look so I promptly set mine to 4:3 mode.\n\nThe hot swap ability of games is quite nice and I advise using this method since you save a little bit of time loading up games this way. If you power cycle the 2600+ off/on each time, then you have to wait for the 2600+ to boot up internally first before it starts to load the game. The hot swap works exactly as it sounds too. The 2600+ detects when you have a game in the console. If you pull it out while powered on, it will blank out and then go to game load failed. Pop in a different game and a second or two later, it will show game loading and the game will appear on the screen.\n\nSeems to work with most of the original library of games for both 2600 and 7800 that I've tested so far. Quite a few older 2600 homebrews have also come up and worked for me. Some home brew games I tested last night that worked were:\n\nBerzerk: VE originally released during CGE 2010 I believe?\n\nK.O. Cruiser (Although I still can figure out the controls on this one)\n\nGo Fish! (Worked great!)\n\nNinjish Guy (Most modern home brew I've tried so far and it worked great)\n\nMedieval Mahem (Seemed to work okay with joystick and...bonus! It was in stereo?!)\n\nNow for the cons and most of this is just stuff I've noticed and it mainly effects the 7800 side of things:\n\nFirst let me get this out there. NONE of the 7800 homebrews or graphic hacks I tested would load. As the 2600+ uses a lookup table based on the game rom checksum to know how to load up, this doesn't surprise me. Hopefully the lookup table and possibly the emulated being used can be updated to allow support for some 7800 home brews. But again, NONE would load up for me.\n\nThe ONLY original released game for the 7800 that hasn't loaded up for me yet in my testing, was Rampage. It will start to load the game, but then just gives a black screen for me with my actual cartridge.\n\nBallblazer was the first game I loaded up and it did load up and play great. But... the pokey emulation isn't quite there as the entire counter melody on the title tune is missing. So this tells me that the RNG from the pokey isn't being emulated as that counter melody uses that pokey feature specifically.\n\nCommando loaded up and played correctly. The ONLY issue is that there is some slight graphical corruption on the title screen where the difficulty selection is. But very minor and the game itself displays fine.\n\nSome games appear to have their button 1 and button 2 functions swapped? Although some of the games, I've not played for a bit so I might be wrong on this. But using a normal 2-button 7800 controller, the games did work and respond correctly.\n\nNow for some oddball miscellaneous stuff I've noticed or find interesting that can be taken as a pro or con...\n\nThe 2600+ outputs a 720P signal. Although it seems this isn't quite a standard 720P signal as my TV takes a second or two to lock in and show the output. Also, my capture device in the game room usually has no issue with 480P, 720P, and 1080P sources. But it does NOT like the 720P from the 2600+ and stays in pass through mode. So I'm not currently able to get any direct captures from the 2600+ output.\n\nI've heard from others that some games don't work for them while others report they do. Both 7800 Ms. Pac-Man and Crossbow are reported as non-working for some and working for others. In my testing with my actual cartridges, both games loaded up and worked without issue for me. But it is possible there are two or more revisions of these games that were released over the years that could be the cause for this if they have slightly different checksums than what is being expected for those games in the 2600+.\n\nThe power LED is stupid easy to replace as there is NO soldering involved. The LED is held in place with a 2 piece bracket using small phillips screws. A 2pin JST connector is plugged into the leads of the LED. So all that is needed to change the LED with a different color if you wanted, would be to remove the small screws and put in a different LED. Plug the jst connector onto the leads and that's it. I've not checked the value of the limiting resistor in the 2600+ for the LED as yet, but as they were using a warm white LED, an those are fairly modern, it is likely the value being used will be good for any LED out there that is 5mm in size to fit in the bracket holder. I've installed a slow changing RGB LED into mine as I felt that fit better than a static color.\n\nFlash carts:\n\nNo surprise, but most of the flash carts out there are NOT going to work with the 2600+. That said, I can confirm that the Dragon Fly 7800 flash cartridge does work! As the DF cart loads the game up outside of the console, the 2600+ is able to read the DF like a normal game and just loads up the game that the DF has loaded into RAM at that time. Also, the hot swap ability of the 2600+ allows for easy game changes on the DF because you can have a game loaded on the DF and playing, then use the DF menu to back out. Choose another game and then press the Enter button on the DF to start loading the other game. The 2600+ will detect this, and blank out with the Game Load Failed message, but then a few seconds later it will show Game Loading... and the game you selected on the DF will now be playing on the 2600+. So it is interesting that the DF's ability to control the 7800 consoles power on/off function seems to also trigger the 2600+'s cartridge detection routine.\n\nAll other flash carts I have failed to load up with the Game Load Failed message which, is to be expected since other flash carts rely on talking with the console hardware directly to load up and show their on screen menu of games.\n\nSo my initial thoughts are that I think this is a great first step from this new Atari in trying to appeal to as many audiences as possible. There seems to be a lot more market hype on this 2600+ release than anything else Atari related I've seen in well over a decade and I do believe this will get non retro gamers back and into the hobby. With updates made to the console FW or outright hacking it in the future, I'm sure more games will be made to work and that will increase sales of the 2600+ and home brew along with games second hand. I see all of that as a good thing and it might signal a true actual rebirth for Atari and interest in the hobby.\n\nOn 11/22/2023 at 10:13 AM, CrossBow said:\n\nSo my initial thoughts are that I think this is a great first step from this new Atari in trying to appeal to as many audiences as possible.

I see all of that as a good thing and it might signal a true actual rebirth for Atari and interest in the hobby.\n\nThough seeing Atari in the news for releasing new games and hardware is nice, as good as Atari CEO Wade Rosen's intentions behind them may be, I see the 2600+ and Gamestation Pro as yet more rushed-to-market fodder. Since both systems recently came out, I'm guessing they both use the same version emulators. The 7800 emulator is apparently a version from as far back as 2009. And if not for the Stella team getting involved, that emulator version would have been much older as well. So, like the Retron 77 and some of the later Flashbacks, it's likely up to others to figure out how to upgrade them. But the emulator issues aside, some people are already reporting other issues with them, from conflicting compatibility accounts with certain games, to systems freezing up. One person even found a loose screw rattling around inside his 2600+. The dipswitch multicarts are just laughable. Those were barely acceptable 20 years ago, and 20 years before that, similar pirate multicarts that were commonly found overseas, but they weren't a thing back-in-the-day in the U.S.,and nobody in the U.S. is looking at them with any nostalgia in 2023. They just make the 2600+ look like the overseas knockoff that it really is. Why not just sell the 2600+ with hundreds of games built-in, and relegate the cartridge-dumping port as a rarely-used feature, instead of a critical one? Does the single-sided piece of paper that's serving as the system's manual even mention how to clean the edge connector in cartridges if they don't work? And given how most people buying this likely won't be involved in online message boards or even be aware of them, will try some old carts, find they won't work, and end up returning the system? (those with a Retron 77, did you find using carts with that to be a similar experience of having to clean cartridges that might otherwise work fine with a real VCS?) Then you have Atari's campaign of \"No cartridge left behind\", when the Driving and keypad controllers don't work, and as for the light gun, it wouldn't matter if it did or not because the system only offers HDMI output, so you can't hook up the system to a CRT (unless you get an HDMI-to-RCA adapter. And oh yeah, you can't plug the system into an AC outlet because no adapter was included. No, these systems shouldn't have been released as-is, but now that they're out, the community will do all the real-world QC testing that Atari should have done. Maybe the next version of them will fix some of these issues, but I've been telling myself that over the Flashbacks, and after 20 years of Atari releasing dozens of versions of those, they're still full of problems. I've said it before and I'll continue to say it - nothing beats having a real system.\n\nI never used those converters and I'm not about to spend $150 on a 2600+ and a converter to do testing that Atari should have already done by now. I mean, this is being marketed as a classic VCS, and yet the only video output is HDMI; you can't use it with a CRT w/o using some sort of 3rd-party adapter (which automatically leaves out any light gun games). You mentioned the system puts out 720p, although it's not a standard spec (your own video capture device has an issue with it, so I would expect various TVs and converters would as well). That's a hardware issue. Do you think Atari will have a firmware update to address that?\n\nAs for lag, I've seen this video about the Gamestation Pro that shows some controller latency with using them wirelessly compared to wired:\n\nYesterday someone in the Atari 2600 Facebook group was complaining that neither a joystick or a paddle works with Astroblast, in either controller jack.\n\nJust today I learned the difficulty switches on the system are reversed, even though they're apparently marked correctly on the pcb: https://forums.atariage.com/topic/357155-difficulty-switches-reversed/\n\nYarusso took several of these systems to PRGE last month for people to try out.... and nobody reported any issues with them? I'm left to think there weren't many carts available to try, which would explain the silence on that end.\n\nLastly, as for your comment:\n\n\"And the only way to get the current Atari to provide more games and products that are likely to want to buy is by supporting the current efforts where it at least appears they are trying.\"\n\nThey already lost my support with $60 games like Mr. Run & Jump or $60-$100 re-issues of old, common 4K games. Their latest batch of cart releases don't even include a manual (but then again, neither does the 2600+). We've had most homebrewers including high-quality manuals with their games for years that not only were superior to Atari Corp's cheap sepia-colored manuals, but on par with some of Atari's and Activision's best manuals. And Atari Interactive can't do that now? Hell, they included full manuals with all of the Flashback systems. Oh, but the boxes are nice, aren't they? Sure, but how do you play the games? What are all the different game variations with each game? I see Rosen's Atari as a company that's more interested in putting out stuff with the Atari name on it, and making something that can be considered a collectible; actually using and playing the items is secondary.\n\nI'm not supporting any company that dumps flawed product onto the market that they can't even bother doing any basic testing on. Issues like difficulty switches and fire buttons being reversed are pretty simple to catch in testing, as new owners are now proving. Seriously, this is amateur-level QC-ing stuff here. Either Atari made no effort to discover these for themselves,or worse, they knew about them, and simply released it anyway. Atari wants me to support their efforts? They need to earn it. Why should I financially support this or any other half-a@@ed efforts? People buying one of these shouldn't have to run through every cartridge in their collection to see if it works or not - that's something Atari should have done, and they should have done it 6 months ago. Atari's own marketing campaign slogan for this is \"No cartridge left behind\", right? Much like most of the other 2600-like systems I mentioned, all these issues just reek of very little if any quality control testing being done. It's as if they got it running on a bench, tested a few carts, labeled it \"Good enough\" and pushed it out the door. The system just came out, and already people are asking about updates for it to fix some of these issues. When Atari laid a similar egg 40 years ago with the 1200XL, they didn't try and fix it; they killed the system and replaced it with better systems. But if you're okay with only having 'some homebrew' carts work, then I guess that's good enough for you. That's modern gaming these days - push out an incomplete or flawed product, and then push out endless patches and fixes... but that's not classic Atari. I never thought I'd see the day were playing a VCS game would involve loading times, and yet here we are. All I can say is, I guess get used to seeing the \"Loading Game Failed\" message.\n\nEdited November 25, 2023 by Scott Stilphen\n\nI honestly don't own that many 2600 home brew games Scott. I mostly own home brews for other platforms. And the ones I do own for the 2600 I already knew wouldn't work on the 2600+. I've got multiple 2600s, and 7800s etc for my use to play these games one without issue.\n\nI bought the 2600+ because I like the idea they have put forth and because I think sales of it will encourage them to release something better in the future. Not sure about the reversed difficulty switches, but I can tell you that pretty much every 7800 game has their buttons reversed and...the color/bw switch does NOT pause 7800 games. Does nothing...\n\nBut I believe that has more to do with them using such an old version of the Prosystem emulator for the 7800 side than anything as these issues were present back then in emulation as well.\n\nI can add that one thing that is quite confusing is that Atari's list of games doesn't specify if they tested a PAL version or NTSC. Because I've now found that in addition to Rampage, my actual Double Dragon cartridge will NOT even give me a loading game message. But... from my DragonFly cartridge the game will load up and run. So that alone tells me that Atari did LIKELY test many carts they had access too. But I suspect a large part of the testing and pass/fail was to simply see if a game loaded or not and they likely had others (testers) to load up their copies of these games and report back to them. As a result, games with multiple variants like Ballblazer, Choplifter, and I suspect Double Dragon, may or may not load up since the checksum table in the prosystem emulation on the 2600+ doesn't have a complete table of values to know what the games are.\n\nAnd yes, Al has said many times that he is working with Atari so they can address these issues with FW updates that would also update the files on the 2600+ so that more homebrew games can be made to work including 7800 homebrew.\n\nBut like all large companies, I'm sure that getting the 2600+ out the door in time for the Holiday shopping was more important so I suspect such an update won't happen for sometime. Still, I've bought other similar products not just from Atari, but others because such companies won't have much interested in fixing or releasing better stuff if they don't sell enough of what they have made already. They guys from Plaion have said that the success of the 2600+ will determine what other future products we might see.\n\nEdited November 25, 2023 by CrossBow"
