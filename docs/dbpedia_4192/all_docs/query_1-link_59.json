        "text": "Since the 60’s, Games Consoles have improved radically. From the graphics to the technology, Video Game Consoles are great pieces of Hardware that have evolved over time. So in this blog post, I’m going to be talking about each Generation of games consoles and how they have evolved both graphically and technologically.\n\nGeneration 1The first generation of games consoles lasted from the 1960’s to the mid 1970’s. These were fairly simple devices that allowed simple home entertainment. The consoles in this generation that were the most recognised, were the Magnavox Odyssey, the Atari Pong Consoles and the different versions of the Nintendo Colour TV.\n\nThe first generation however, was incredibly limited. These consoles were not capable of graphical game designs, each game the console could run would be installed on the console, some of the consoles, like the Odyssey, had graphical overlays to put in front of the screen to help the players see what game they are playing. Some of the consoles (like the Atari Pong) could only play one game, Pong. The main console that had different games was the Nintendo Colour TV, the way it did this was by releasing a new variation of the console, every time new forms of current games were created, even though it was called “Game 6”, “Game 15” and etc. One more point is that these consoles had very simple controllers that came with he system, it was most likely a box with one button or switch; very few controllers had more than that in this generation. Similar to the arcade version, several companies released clones to capitalize on the home console’s success, many of which continued to produce new consoles and video games. Magnavox re-released their Odyssey system with simplified hardware and new features, and would later release updated versions. Coleco entered the video game market with their Telstar console which featured three Pong variants and was also succeeded by newer models. Nintendo released the Colour TV Game 6 in 1977, which played six variations of electronic tennis. The next year, it was followed by an updated version, the Colour TV Game 15, which featured fifteen variations. The systems were Nintendo’s entry into the home video game market and the first to produce themselves (they had previously licensed the Magnavox Odyssey).\n\nAtari PONG was released in June 1972 and is the first commercially successful video game. This tennis sports game featuring two-dimensional graphics is one of the earliest arcade video games, which may be considered one of the most revolutionary games due to its success which led to development of ‘Home Pong’ which was marketed in 1975. This change in how video games were played could be seen as one of the most revolutionary of all, as this furthered the development of more home consoles which people could play all day in comparison to spending money to play for a few minutes at an arcade machine.\n\nThe audience during this time period were families, they were advertised as more as electronics rather than home video game consoles.\n\nGeneration 2Generation 2 of computer and video games began in 1976 with the release of the Fairchild Channel F and Radofin Electronics’ 1292 Advanced Programmable Video System. It coincided with and was partly fueled by the golden age of arcade video games, a peak era of popularity and innovation for the medium.\n\nThe early period saw the launch of several consoles as various companies decided to enter the market; later releases were in direct response to the earlier consoles. The Atari 2600 was the dominant console for much of the second generation, with other consoles such as Intellivision, the Odyssey², and ColecoVision also enjoying market share. The Atari 2600 was a home video game console released on September 11, 1977 by Atari. It is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and ROM cartridges containing game code, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F video game console in 1976. This format contrasts with the older model of having non-microprocessor dedicated hardware, which could only play the games which were physically built into the unit. The console was originally sold as the Atari VCS, an abbreviation for Video Computer System. Following the release of the Atari 5200 in 1982, the VCS was renamed to the Atari 2600, after the unit’s Atari part number, CX2600. The 2600 was bundled with two joystick controllers (the controllers had one button and one joystick), a pair of paddle controllers, and one game cartridge. The Intellivision is a home video game console released by Mattel Electronics in 1979. Development of the console began in 1978, less than a year after the introduction of its main competitor, the Atari 2600. The word Intellivision is a portmanteau of “intelligent television”. Over 3 million Intellivision units were sold and a total of 125 games were released for the console. The ColecoVision is Coleco Industries’ second-generation home video-game console which was released in August 1982. The ColecoVision offered a much more powerful game machine system compared to competitors such as the Atari 2600, along with an ability to expand the system’s basic hardware. One of these was a add on that allowed Atari 2600 games to be played on it.\n\nGeneration 3Generation 3 (1983) marked the end of the ‘North American Videogame Crash’, and helped bring Japan out as the dominant in the industry, thanks to the Famicom, or NES in America. The three best-selling consoles of that era where the NES, Master System, and Atari 7800. It also gave birth to the rivalry between SEGA and Nintendo. It’s in this generation that franchises like Legend of Zelda, Metal Gear, Metroid and Castlevania were found. The things that distinguished the Gen 3 from its predecessor included D-Pads, detailed sprite graphics with enhanced colour palettes (with up to 100 sprites on screen, 16 colours per sprite, and 32×32 sprite sizes), and advanced hardware scrolling. The NES (Nintendo Entertainment System), or Famicon in Japan, was the best selling console of its time, and was the main contributing factor to helping North America recover from the Videogame Crash. One of the things that caused the crash was low quality games continuing to disappoint the public. Nintendo put a stop to that by introducing a new business model that made games more polished – licensing 3rd party developers restricting developers from publishing and distributing software without licensed approval. The main appeal of the NES was being able to play games from home, rather than having to go out and pay at the arcade. It allowed for more long lasting, story driven games to come through. The NES sold over 61.9 million copies, with the market for Nintendo cartridges outshining all the previous demand for home computer systems. The success of the NES was so strong it caused competitors serious financial trouble come Christmas. In total, there were 713\n\nlicensed games released on the NES.\n\nIn the later part of the third generation, Nintendo also introduced the Game Boy, which almost single-handedly solidified and then proceeded to dominate the previously scattered handheld market for 15 years. While the Game Boy product line was incrementally updated every few years, until the Game Boy Micro and Nintendo DS, and partially the Game Boy Colour, all Game Boy products were backwards compatible with the original released in 1989. Since the Game Boy’s release, Nintendo had dominated the handheld market. The Game Boy is an 8-bit handheld video game device developed and manufactured by Nintendo. It was released in Japan on April 21, 1989, in North America on July 31, 1989, and in Europe on September 28, 1990. Upon its release in the United States, it sold its entire shipment of one million units within a few weeks. In its first two weeks in Japan, from its release on April 21, 1989, the entire stock consisting of 300,000 units was sold; a few months later, the Game Boy’s release in the United States on July 31, 1989 saw 40,000 units sold on its first day. The Game Boy and Game Boy Colour combined have sold 118.69 million units worldwide, with 32.47 million units in Japan, 44.06 million in the Americas, and 42.16 million in other regions. By Japanese fiscal year 1997, before Game Boy Colour’s release in late-1998, the Game Boy alone had sold 64.42 million units worldwide. Sega’s first foray into the third generation of games consoles came in the form of the SG-1000. This gaming system was both a sales and cultural failure, providing little influence on the north american and European gaming scenes, with only slightly wider spread in Japan.\n\nHowever in 1986 Sega released the second of its Gen 3 consoles was more successful, though still not as widely remembered as their Nintendo counterpart, the Sega Master system.\n\nGeneration 4Nintendo’s SNES was originally released in 1990 in Japan, making its way to N. America in 1991 and finally Europe in 1992. The SNES was, for it’s time, quite a powerful advancement in terms of video games and consoles, boasting advanced graphics and sound capabilities; combined with the 6-bit and range of enhancement chips integrated within the console, it made it’s mark in gaming history.\n\nFrom launch the SNES was a global success, out selling all of it’s competition (consisting mostly of Sega’s consoles: The Genesis and Mega Drive) in the 16-bit era and even staying popular when the next generation of consoles came about. The SNES had online capabilities by way of the Satellaview add-on. It connected to satellite via a modem and was released in 1995 in Japan only. The 16-bit design of the SNES incorporates graphics and sound co-processors that allow tiling and simulated 3D effects, a palette of 32,768 colors, and 8-channel ADPCM audio. These base platform features, plus the ability to dramatically extend them all through substantial chip upgrades inside of each cartridge, represent a leap over the 8-bit NES generation and some supposed significant advantages over the higher bit-rate competition such as the Genesis.\n\nCombined with the SNES it elevated console gaming from being a rather niche activity to a mass consumer activity, it was major shift, maybe it was price thing, because suddenly everyone had a SNES or Genesis/Megadrive. Also known as PC Engine was developed by Hudson Soft and NEC. First it was launched in Japan on October 30, 1987, and latter in America in August 1989. It was successful in Japan due to in part that it used the new CD-ROM format. The console failed to keep up sales or make a strong impact in the American market and therefore stopped manufacturing in America in 1994.\n\nGeneration 5 The fifth generation of video game consoles, often referred to as the ‘3D era’ refers to consoles released between approximately 1993 and 2001. Notable examples from this generation include the Sony PlayStation, Sega Saturn and Nintendo 64.\n\nThe consoles are most notable for their 3D capabilities. Although this was possible before with the likes of the Super Nintendo’s Super FX chip, these consoles were released with more processing power and the rendering capabilities to make fully 3D games, a revolutionary step that definitely left its mark and changed the future of gaming and completely changed how games were designed. Notable games from this generation include Crash Bandicoot and Final Fantasy XII, the latter being notable for pushing the industry towards using CDs due to storage issues on the Nintendo 64’s cartridges, despite all previous Final Fantasy releases being Nintendo only. This was known as the 3D Era which introduced us to higher quality 3D graphics, Higher resolutions, CD-ROM storage, high quality 16 bit audio, analogue controllers and 24 bit colour. Due to Playstation, this era also marked the end of cartridges as far as home consoles go. Despite the Playstation being 32-bit as opposed to 64-bit, its use of compact discs allowed the games to be much, much bigger. A notable effect of this is that development of Final Fantasy VII was shifted from Nintendo to Playstation due to its size. The game went on to become the second best selling Playstation game, a devastating blow to Nintendo. As the sixth generation was ushered in, all of its home consoles utilised CDs.\n\nThe 3D genre was mastered by other companies however – games such as Super Mario 64 and Crash Bandicoot redefined their own genres and hold up to this day.\n\nGeneration 6 The sixth-generation era includes Xbox, Playstation 2, Nintendo GameCube, Sega Dreamcast. Game Boy Advanced and N-Gage were the handhelds released in this era. The era began on November 27, 1998 and ended in November 2006 as the next generation of consoles were being released. The sixth generation of video games sold a record-breaking 180+ million consoles and 85 million handheld systems. Microsoft’s use of PC technology when making the Xbox allow for a greater performance when compared to other 128-bit consoles. However, sales remain behind that of the Playstation 2. The greatest success for Xbox proves to be Hab: Combat Evolved, one of the most popular titles in video game history. The PlayStation 2 was the first 128-bit system that featured backwards compatibility, the ability to older 32-bit PlayStation games and functioned as a DVD player. This aided the Playstation’s sales as the system was being purchased by many people who did not necessarily care about the vast library of games, but wanted a DVD player they could justify spending money on. With the strength of titles like Grand Theft Auto, Metal Gear and Final Fantasy, the Playstation 2 became the most popular console of the 128-bit era. 127 million units (as of December 31, 2007) were sold. The Playstation 2 also marks the rise in popularity of console games played over high-speed internet connection. Nintendo’s GameCube was their first system to use optical discs instead of cartridges and one-upped the gameplay and graphics of the Nintendo 64. May 1999, the console was first publicly announced as “Project Dolphin”, the successor to the Nintendo 64. The release of the Dreamcast also included reviving the Sonic the Hedgehog series that seemed to be on hiatus during the 5th generation. The Dreamcast is notable for being the first major console to have online support built in, as well as MMO gaming.\n\nThe GameBoy Advance is a backwards compatible, portable system that plays games from both the GameBoy and the GameBoy Colour. The LCD screen can display over 32,000 colours. In the late 1990s, gamers increasingly carried both mobile phones and handheld game consoles. Nokia spotted an opportunity to combine these devices into one unit. Nokia announced in November 2002 that they would develop the N-Gage, a device that integrated these two devices. Instead of using cables, multiplayer gaming was accomplished with Bluetooth or the Internet (via the N-Gage Arena service). The N-Gage also included MP3 and Real Audio/Video playback and PDA-like features into the system.\n\nGeneration 7The seventh generation includes consoles released since late 2005 by Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony Computer Entertainment. For home consoles, the seventh generation began on November 22, 2005 with the release of Microsoft’s Xbox 360 and continued with the release of Sony Computer Entertainment’s PlayStation 3 on November 17, 2006, and Nintendo’s Wii on November 19, 2006. Each new console introduced a new type of breakthrough in technology. The Xbox 360 offered games rendered natively at High-definition video resolutions, the PlayStation 3 offered HD movie playback via a built-in 3D Blu-ray Disc player, and the Wii focused on integrating controllers with movement sensors as well as joysticks. Some of the Wii controllers could be moved about to control in-game actions, which enabled players to simulate real-world actions during gameplay (e.g., in the Wii sports tennis game, the user swings the controller to hit the on-screen image of a tennis ball). Joining Nintendo in the motion market, Sony Computer Entertainment released the PlayStation Move in September 2010. The PlayStation Move features motion sensing gaming, similar to that of the Wii. Microsoft joined the scene in November 2010, with its Kinect (previously announced under the working title “Project Natal” in June 2009). Unlike the other two systems (PlayStation 3 and Wii), Kinect does not use controllers of any sort and makes the users the “controller.” Having sold 8 million units in its first 60 days on the market, Kinect has claimed the Guinness World Record of being the “fastest selling consumer electronics device”. While the Xbox 360 offers wired controllers as a standalone product, all PlayStation 3 controllers can be used in wired and wireless configurations. The Seventh Generation of games consoles also introduced us to many Handheld consoles, on the November 21, 2004 starting with the Nintendo DS , alongside Nintendo’s existing Game Boy Advance and GameCube consoles. The Nintendo DS features a touch screen and built-in microphone, and supports wireless IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) standards. Additionally, the revised version of the NDS, the Nintendo DSi, features two built in cameras, the ability to download games from the DSi store, and a web browser. The PlayStation Portable (PSP) released later the same year on December 12, 2004, followed a different pattern. It became the first handheld video game console to use an optical disc format, Universal Media Disc (UMD), as its primary storage media. Sony also gave the PSP robust multi-media capability, connectivity with the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2 (only on some games), other PSPs, as well as Internet connectivity. The multi-million-dollar pre-sale success of Ouya, an Android-based micro-console initially founded through crowd funding has raised open-source development and the free-to-play model as key issues to be addressed in later firmware updates to the seventh generation consoles, as well as by the eighth generation consoles. The micro-consoles like Nvidia Shield Console, MOJO, Razer Switchblade, GamePop, GameStick, Ouya, and even more powerful PC-based Steam Machine consoles are attempting to compete in the game console market; but even though some of these are theoretically powerful on paper, they are however not often referred to as “seventh generation” consoles.\n\nGeneration 8 The eighth generation includes consoles released since 2012 by Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony Computer Entertainment. For home consoles, the eighth generation began on November 18, 2012 with the release of the Wii U, and continued with the release of the PlayStation 4 on November 15, 2013, and Xbox One on November 22, 2013. These video game consoles follow the seventh generation: Sony’s PlayStation 3, Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s Xbox 360. For video game handhelds, the generation began in February 2011 with the release of the Nintendo 3DS, successor to the Nintendo DS, in Japan, followed by a North American and European release in March. Nintendo released the New Nintendo 3DS XL in North America on February 13, 2015. The successor of the PlayStation Portable, the PlayStation Vita, was released in Japan in December 2011, and in Western markets in February 2012. The Xbox one is Microsoft’s latest Xbox and was released in late 2013. The Xbox one suffered a disastrous launch which was plagued with bad ideas from the offset. These included DRM and always online connectivity which was not helped by the way Microsoft’s marketing department delivering an E3 conference based mostly on the things the console could do not relating to games. This all lead to the console being out sold by both the Wii u and PS4 at launch. This only changed when new head of Xbox Phil Spencer made welcome changes to the console causing it to leapfrog the Wii U in sales, however the PS4 had already had an unreachable gap. Another technological advancement is the integration on DirectX 12 which allows a systems hardware to be ran more efficiently, as well of this the introduction of windows 10 is allowing more Xbox exclusives to be sold on PC and for cross platform play. As well as this there was an advancement in controllers with the new vibrations motors. There was also the elite controllers which allows you to customise your D pad and add paddles to the controller if you wish as well as map out your own controls. The PS4 (Playstation 4) is Sony’s games console for the 8th generation. It follows the PS3. Release dates around the world were 15th November 2013 in north america, and November 29th in Europe, south america and Australia and 22nd February 2014 in Japan. Some of it’s new features included share play and live broadcasting and you are also able to share a screenshot or video clip of your own gameplay to Facebook, Youtube and much more. The most impressive thing is that all of this can be done at the touch of a button. The PS4 is also the first to include a WebKit-based web browser.\n\nOne of the positives about this generation and the majority of the consoles in this particular generation, is that they are able to be used for many more things other than games making them entertainment centre this has allowed them to be accessible to more people expanding the game’s audience in general. This has allowed game to be much bigger in scope, such as GTA 5 and The Last of Us. Another major change is the option to buy your games digitally through PS Store, Xbox Store and many others. Lets also not forget that, with these consoles being able to have a larger hard drive with more storage, we are able to store more games on our consoles than ever before. The Wii U was a console developed by Nintendo and was the follow up to the Wii. This certain console was released in the November of 2012 and was Nintendo’s first addition to the eighth generation, not including handhelds.The eighth generation began with the release of the Wii U but if we were to include handhelds, the Nintendo 3DS takes the spot, with it being released in February 2011.\n\nThe Wii U’s controller, the Wii U GamePad, features an embedded touchscreen, and combines directional buttons and analog sticks but not forgetting the action buttons: A,B,X,Y. The touchscreen can be used as a way to play the game handheld or a form of local multiplayer without having to use split-screen. This console is the first Nintendo console to support HD graphics.\n\nOverall, I feel that after learning more about each individual console Generation has helped me understand how both graphical and technological advancements have came along way since the 60’s and how each console has contributed and revolutionised games design in the industry."
