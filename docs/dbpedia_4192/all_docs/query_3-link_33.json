        "text": "First of all, this isn‚Äôt a sponsored article, it‚Äôs just my opinion and experience, from over 30 years of retro gaming and console playing. Since I don‚Äôt earn anything from this article and I‚Äôm not affiliated with the My Arcade¬Æ company, in any way. It‚Äôs just a simple advice, based on my view of the retro gaming global. That said, good reading!\n\nThe overall passion for classic video games will seize you, with the exceptional offer related to the My Arcade‚Äôs Atari Gamestation PRO (GSP) console, to be had on online stores like Amazon, Walmart, GameStop and other US-based marketplaces, as well as in physical shops in the North American territory (while stocks last).\n\nAtari GSP, what exactly is it?\n\nThis console takes you back in time, celebrating legendary titles and the playful simplicity, that characterized the Atari era. It‚Äôs the perfect option, for those seeking pure and simple fun, with minimal setup and the ability to share gaming experiences, with friends and family.\n\nDue of its portability (small and super lightweight), Atari GSP is perfect, for those who want to bring their favorite games with them, wherever they go, at home or on vacation, and allows you to recreate a sad atmosphere, anywhere.\n\nThis makes it a great choice for retrogaming fans or casual players, who not only prefers modern games, but also those who want to combine retro charm with console convenience, all at a practical price.\n\nTherefore, if you‚Äôre a fan of retro gaming gadgets or looking for a cool gift for someone, who loves to relive a classic gaming era, the Atari GSP is definitely recommended (IMHO), since it‚Äôs more complete and customizable (totally tweakable for any gaming geek or experienced gamer), than the previous Atari Flashback Series of systems, that have been released in past years.\n\nAtari GSP, who should buy it?\n\nThe Atari GSP is a complete console, that offers over 200 pre-loaded games, including the classic Atari 2600 and VCS-2020 (remakes), 5200 and 7800 titles, with a variety of customized bonus games, both 8-bit and 16-bit, arcade classics, as well.\n\nMoreover, the GSP system supports game emulation through MAME, the Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator software (yeah, you read that right). This means you can use your own game ROMs and cartridge dumps, once transferred to the microSD card, and virtually providing an unlimited retro experience, nowadays.\n\nOriginally priced at $100 USD, Atari GSP is now available for just a little over 40 bucks. So, you might take advantage of the unbeatable 60% discount, to relive or explore the classic Atari arcade games, that made gaming history, and having a console, that virtually gives access to a countless number of other games and platforms.\n\nThis all-in-one system, comes with 2 modern wireless controllers, equipped with paddles and RGB lights (although the joysticks aren‚Äôt quite responsive), that vaguely resemble the classic Atari CX40 joysticks.\n\nIn addition, the GSP device uses USB-C connectors, that are also compatible with wired Xbox controllers, for those who want more accuracy. Basically, other wired USB-C controllers and wireless adapters should work too, as long as they must be compatible with Xinput function on Windows (to be verified first), though.\n\nSumming up, the GSP is almost perfect for retro game enthusiasts and collectors, or anyone who wants to relive video gaming golden era again, in a modern, accessible way, and the GSP is perfect for that.\n\nGSP Mini FAQ\n\nQ: Can the GSP‚Äôs joystick speed be adjusted? Since it‚Äôs very touchy, the slightest contact sends the cursor flying across the TV screen.\n\nA: Yes, install the latest firmware update v1.30 linked below (Windows PC needed). Also, if playing on HDTV select game mode (smooth gameplay). Paddle sensitivity, can be adjusted from each game menu, as well.\n\nQ: Can I use my own Atari game cartridges (e.g. 2600, 5200, 7800 and Jaguar), to play with the GSP system?\n\nA: No, you can‚Äôt. If you want to do that, purchase the brand new Atari 2600 Plus system, which also comes with a 10-in-1 game cartridge. Instead, with the GSP, you can plug in a USB-C stick or insert a microSD card to preload ROMs for NES and SNES, SMS and Genesis, Arcade, as well as all Atari 2600, 5200, and 7800 video games and homebrews.\n\nQ: Is the GSP compatible with original CX40 joysticks from old Atari consoles?\n\nA: Absolutely not, the GSP isn‚Äôt compatible with the original Atari 2600 joysticks or paddles. The game port used on GSP controllers is USB-C or USB-A with a C-adapter, if you choose not to connect wirelessly. OG makes CX40+ joysticks and paddles for the revised 2600+ system.\n\nFinal Remarks\n\nThe Atari GSP has seen various price changes in recent months, but the current offering is an unbeatable deal. Offered at the lowest possible price, this is a unique opportunity to own a mid-range retro console, at a very affordable price.\n\nWith demand on the rise and stock decreasing, the price could go up soon (also due to unscrupulous scalpers reselling at inflated prices). So, if you‚Äôre interested, hurry up and seize this unique opportunity, before supplies run out, tempus fugit! ‚åõüïπÔ∏èüòÑ\n\nReferences"
