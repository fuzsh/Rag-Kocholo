        "text": "Actually what you mentioned is one of the reasons the Atari 7800 XM was announced. The 7800 XM was supposed allow a keyboard to be used and allow 8 bit computer hardware stuff like a hard drive to be used on an Atari 7800 XM. The 7800 XM also has two planned expansion ports.\n\nThere is a very old Atari 7800 XM page that you can see a picture of the key that you need to scroll down a lot. Here's the link: http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/7800/expansion/\n\nThe problem is I have no idea if any of this is scrapped for the 7800 XM because Curt had the system take pre-orders in 2010 and none was shipped out yet for multiple reasons including Curt's health problems.\n\nThe 7800 XM itself isn't ready yet to be shipped. The XM was supposed to be more than the computer part since it supposed to have more ram, Pokey Sound chip, and YM2151 sound chip, and a built in high score cart.\n\nI was looking at the picture of the 7800 computer that never materialized.\n\nhttp://www.atarihq.com/museum/2678/7800key.html\n\nIt looks to me to have been nothing more than a modified XL that attached through the joystick port to the 7800.\n\nI wish there was more info on it but creating such a device would be doable. A cartridge on the 7800 for direction and all the peripherals would hook to the attached computer. The computer would be nothing more than a fancy dumb terminal.\n\nIF one could create a cartridge for the 7800, this could be done with a current XL or XE, just turn off ANTIC as it would not be needed.\n\nWish had more info on the thing."
