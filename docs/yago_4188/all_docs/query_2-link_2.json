It was screened out of competition at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival.[1]\n\nDescribed as \"wonderfully atmospheric\", the film is based on the opera of the same name by Gustave Charpentier. Charpentier remained on the set throughout the filming and personally coached Grace Moore, who played the title role. Both Georges Thill, who played Julien and André Pernet who played Louise's father, were famous exponents of those roles on the opera stage and had recorded them in 1935.[2] The orchestra was directed by Louis Beydts.[3]\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nGrace Moore as Louise\n\nGeorges Thill as Julien\n\nAndré Pernet as Le père de Louise\n\nSuzanne Desprès as La mère de Louise\n\nRobert Le Vigan as Gaston\n\nGinette Leclerc as Lucienne\n\nEdmond Beauchamp as Le philosophe (as Beauchamp)\n\nJacqueline Gauthier as Alphonsine\n\nRivers Cadet\n\nPauline Carton as La première\n\nRoger Blin as Un rapin\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
