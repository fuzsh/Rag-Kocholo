        "text": "I came across this film on Youtube and honestly didn’t expect the ending. I think modern animation is becoming more truthful and realistic. This was a short snippet into Louise’s life and the hardships that she has to go through. There was a moment right at the end of the film, where I didn’t fully understand the reference – she was offered a sweet treat but was hesitant at first.\n\nClose ups are meant to intensify a scene and show importance. This short film showcases the details of a dancer and the close ups signify this. However, there are moments of fleeting environments which alludes to the feeling of being backstage.\n\nThe moment when Louise is staring at herself in the mirror, fixing herself up – getting ready for what is about to happen. It is to prepare the audience for what she had to go through leading up to the act of hardship."
