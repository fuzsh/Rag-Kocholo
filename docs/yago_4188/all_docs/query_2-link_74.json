        "text": "Thelma & Louise\n\nDir. Ridley Scott, 1991\n\nIntroduced by Kino Corner\n\nThis gorgeously shot film is a rarity in Hollywood: a written-by-a-woman (Callie Khouri) action thriller/road movie with richly drawn female bonding at its center. Controversial in its day for its sensational depiction of violence, Thelma & Louise has become a cult classic with a large fan base, which includes members of the LGBTQ community who, already in the 1990s, saw in this narrative a quasi-lesbian romance that takes dead aim at patriarchy. Starring Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon, this is also the film that made a young Brad Pitt famous, despite his limited screen time. The closing shot is among the most famous and memorable of the decade.\n\nThis Fall’s Ackland Film Forum series, Nineties Flashback, is presented by the Ackland Art Museum and the UNC Film Studies Program, part of the UNC-Chapel Hill Department of English and Comparative Literature.\n\nAll Ackland Film Forum screenings are part of UNC-Chapel Hill’s Campus Life Experience program.
