Alex Bernard as General Du Teil, Lord of Pommiers castle.\n\t\n\t<b>Alex Bernard</b> (born Albert Alexandre Bernard, March 11, 1882 – August 20, 1968) was a French silent film actor, who acted in Italian, French and German films.\n\t\n\tThough born in Paris, Alex Bernard started his career in Italian silent film, from 1910 onward, at the Turin based company Itala, where he kept the Italianized name of Alessandro Bernard. After several one-reeler modern and historical dramas, he starred as the policeman in the four-reel mystery Tigris (Vincenzo Denizot, 1913). as Leone in Nino Oxilia's feature Addio giovinezza! (1913), and as King Syphax of Cirta in the mega-epic Cabiria (Giovanni Pastrone, 1914). After a long absence from the sets from 1914, he returned in 1921, acting at various Italian companies, such as Photo-Drama, Sterni Film, Libertas, and Cines, directed by e.g. Augusto Genina and Mario Camerini, and opposite such actors as Lydia Quaranta, Angelo Ferrari, Maria Roasio, Diomira Jacobini and Lucy San Germano. In 1923 he acted in the prestigioues Franco-Italian production Cirano di Bergerac/ Cyrano de Bergerac by Genina, with Pierre Magnier in the title role. In 1924-25 several films by Camerini followed such as La casa dei pulcini (1924) with Diomira Jacobini, and Voglio tradire mio marito (1925) with Linda Pini, as well as films by Carmine Gallone and others.\n\t\n\tAfter two adventure films, Saetta e le sette mogli del Pascià (Luciano Doria, 1926) with Domenico Gambino, and Maciste contro lo sceicco (Mario Camerini, 1926) with Bartolomeo Pagano, Bernard moved back to France, to play supporting parts in Abel Gance's Napoléon (1927) and in Le marchand de bonheur (1926) with Georges Melchior and Rita Jolivet. Yet, soon Bernard was back in Italy for more substantial supporting parts in ll vetturale del Moncenisio (Baldassarre Negroni, 1927) with Pagano and Rina De Liguoro, in Il carnevale di Venezia (Mario Almirante, 1928) with Maria Jacobini, and La compagnia dei matti (Almirante, 1928) with Elena Lunda. Bernard's last silent films were the German film Die Nacht des Schreckens (Gennaro Righelli, 1929) with Renée Héribel and Theodor Loos, and two French films: Nuits de princes (Marcel L'Herbier, 1929) with Gina Manès and Jaque Catelain, and Maternité (Jean Benoît-Lévy, 1930) with Andrée Brabant.\n\t\n\tFrom 1930 Bernard acted in French sound cinema. He was the photographer in Prix de beauté/ Miss Europe (Augusto Genina, 1930) with Louise Brooks, a client in La petite Lise (Jean Grémillon, 1930) with Nadia Sibirskaïa, a marquis in the French version of Fra Diavolo (Mario Bonnard, 1931), and stage director in Genina's Paris-Beguin (1931). In the early 1930s, Bernard acted in eight more films, including the old miner in G.W. Pabst's Kameradschaft (1931), and the professor in La maternelle (Jean Benoît-Lévy, Marie Epstein, 1933), starring Madeleine Renaud. He was reunited with Genina for Les amours de minuit (1931) with Daniela Parola, and  La femme en homme (1932) and Ne sois pas jalouse (1932), both with Carmen Boni. Bernard died in 1968 in Neuilly-sur-Seine near Paris.\n\t\n\tSources: French Wikipedia, IMDb.",
