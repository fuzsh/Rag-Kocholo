        "text": "TRIVIA: about the film\n\n— Grace Moore (1898–1947) was an American operatic soprano and actress in musical theatre and film. She was nicknamed the “Tennessee Nightingale.” During her sixteen seasons with the Metropolitan Opera, she sang in several Italian and French operas as well as the title roles in Tosca, Manon, and Louise. Louise was her favorite opera and is widely considered to have been her greatest role. Attracted to Hollywood in the early years of talking pictures, Moore’s first screen role was as Jenny Lind in the 1930 MGM film A Lady’s Morals. Later that same year she starred with the Metropolitan Opera singer Lawrence Tibbett in New Moon, also for MGM. After a hiatus of several years, Moore returned to Hollywood under contract to Columbia Pictures, for whom she made six films. In the 1934 film One Night of Love, she portrayed a small-town girl who aspires to sing opera. For that role she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. The last film that Moore made was Louise (1939), an abridged version of Gustave Charpentier’s opera of the same name, with spoken dialog in place of some of the original opera’s music. The composer participated in the production, authorizing the cuts and changes to the libretto, coaching Moore, and advising director Abel Gance. Moore is credited with helping bring opera to a larger audience through her popular films. Moore died in a plane crash near Copenhagen’s airport on January 26, 1947, at the age of 48. Moore’s life story was made into a movie, So This Is Love, in 1953.\n\n— The working title for the film was Interlude. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Harry Lachman directed along with Robert Riskin, though the latter received sole credit.\n\n— The music in the film included “Serenade” by Franz Schubert, as well as “Siboney” (in Spanish), music and lyrics by Dolly Morse and Eernest Lecuona; “The Waltz Song” from Roméo and Juliet , music by Charles Gounod, libretto by Jules Barbier and Michel Carré; “In the Gloaming,” music and lyrics by Meta Orred and Annie F. Harrison; “The Whistling Boy” and “Our Song,” music by Jerome Kern, lyrics by Dorothy Fields; “Minnie the Moocher,” music by Cab Calloway, lyrics by Irving Mills and Clarence Gaskill, arranged by Al Siegel.\n\n— In the film, Moore sings “Siboney“. Xavier Cugat’s version of “Siboney” was recommended by Brooks in her self-published booklet, The Fundamentals of Good Ballroom Dancing.\n\n— In critiquing Grace Moore, the New York Times wrote “Her rendition of “Serenade” is delightful; so is her singing of the waltz aria from “Romeo and Juliet” and of Harrison’s old favorite, “In the Gloaming.” The recording implements were less kind in at least two of the Kern interludes, diluting her voice to the point of thinness in the “Whistling Boy” song and in certain phases of the “Our Song” number. . . . The comic highlight of the production, naturally, is her energetic interpretation of Mr. Calloway’s “Minnie the Moocher,” with gestures and a wealth of hi-de-ho’s.”"
