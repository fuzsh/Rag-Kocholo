        "text": "When I began working on a research project about Thelma & Louise in 1991, I didn’t know I was researching two films. All I knew was that I had been ‘blown away’ by the movie. It transported me to some kind of previously unknown psychological dimension, removed from the day-to-day world of existence that was...Read More\n\nThe documentary Catching Sight of Thelma & Louise had its origins back in 1991, when director Jennifer Townsend saw the then-newly-released Thelma & Louise, directed by Ridley Scott and written by Callie Khouri, a complete badass who wrote the script in longhand while working a production assistant job, won an Oscar for it, and reportedly responded...Read More\n\nWhy Thelma & Louise struck a nerve On June 24th, 1991, Thelma & Louise was emblazoned on the cover of Time magazine. The text read: ‘Why Thelma & Louise strikes a nerve.’ When this film was released it was like a cinematic bomb going off. The dust still hasn’t settled. Articles are still being written about the...Read More\n\nCallie Khouri and I were called by the spirit of Thelma & Louise For 25 years the spirit of “Thelma & Louise” haunted me. I was mesmerized by the film when it came out in 1991. So much so that I was compelled to gather reactions from viewers around the country. In pre-internet times, this...Read More\n\nI saw Thelma & Louise in 1991 when I was 24 years old. I remember watching the movie and appreciating the Southern Utah landscape as I lived in Salt Lake City at the time. I’ve seen the movie many times and own it on VHS too. I loved the movie so much that I insisted...Read More\n\nI remember the first time I watched Thelma and Louise with my older brother and sister and as i was so young – although I loved it even then – it didn’t register what a ground-breaking film it is, and sadly remains with so few other filmmakers following up with such dynamic women-centric films. Kazz...Read More\n\nI’m so happy to have found this page. Thelma & Louise brings back great memories for me. I was in college when it came out. A group of girlfriends and I went to see it as soon as the Time Magazine article came out. I remember being kind of noisy and commenting out-loud in the...Read More\n\nRecently my daughter, Suzy, and I were looking online for a film to watch together. She is 16 years old. She said some of her friends had watched Thelma & Louise and asked if I had ever seen it. OMG! It is one of my favorite films! I couldn’t remember the last time I saw...Read More\n\nWithout Google, tracking people down after 25 years would have been difficult or nearly impossible. In this video, Jennifer Townsend describes her pain-staking efforts, using Google to search and track down the only waitress who replied to her questionnaire. How hard was it to find people without Google? Twenty-five years ago people’s lives were largely...Read More"
