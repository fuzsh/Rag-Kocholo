        "text": "For some time, I have been deeply interested (some would say obsessed) with the silent film star Louise Brooks (1906-1985). To channel my interest, and as a means of connecting with others of like mind, I founded the Louise Brooks Society, a pioneering website, online archive, and international fan club. The LBS has been online since 1995, and is known around the world.\n\nThe mission of the LBS is to advocate for a greater awareness and appreciation of the actress. To this end, I have banged the drum in various ways for 25+ years. I have penned dozens of articles about the actress and her films, and authored or edited four books. More articles and books are forthcoming. In particular, I am proud to have brought the early feminist novel, The Diary of a Lost Girl — the basis for one of Brooks’ best films, back into print after 100 years of undeserved obscurity. My biggest effort to date, a 900-page, two volume work titled Around the World with Louise Brooks, is due out later in 2022.\n\nSince 2002, I have also kept a blog detailing my various activities and ongoing research, and have penned some 3500 entries read by more than 1.7 million visitors. Besides the website and blog, the Louise Brooks Society also maintains a handful of social media accounts:\n\nYouTube | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Flickr | LinkTree\n\nAs well, I have helped with the preservation of two of the Brooks’ films, curated exhibits, put on events and screenings, and spoken about the actress at various bookstores, theaters, libraries and museums. I have introduced the actress’ films in venues around the world. And in 2019, I gave the keynote address at the annual Rudolph Valentino Memorial in Hollywood, speaking on the relationship between the two early film stars.\n\nIn 1998, inspired by the popularity of the LBS website, Turner Classic Movies (TCM) commissioned the Emmy nominated documentary Louise Brooks Looking for Lulu. The role played by the LBS in helping bring this film to television was acknowledged by TCM and the director of the documentary. (See “Fan Site Sparks Biopic” in Wired.) Additionally, in the year 2000, following a grass-roots campaign, the LBS helped bring both the acclaimed Barry Paris biography of Brooks as well as the actress’ own book, Lulu in Hollywood, back into print through the University of Minnesota Press. The LBS is acknowledged in each edition.\n\nThe Louise Brooks Society was one of the very first websites devoted to silent film or a silent film star. What started as a pioneering fan-site has become an acclaimed resource for both the actress and early cinema. The LBS has been praised by the likes of Roger Ebert and Leonard Maltin, and mentioned in newspapers and magazines around the world including the New York Times, Irish Times, USA Today, and South China Morning Post. In 2002, the Stuttgarter Zeitung, a German newspaper, called the LBS site “vorbildlichen” or “exemplary.” (A list of some of the media the LBS has received can be found below.)\n\nAs an authority on the films of Louise Brooks, I have appeared on television and radio, and more recently, podcasts and online videos. I have also contributed essays to film festival programs as well as audio commentaries to two DVD / Blu-ray releases. Notably, my commentaries were singled out in reviews of the DVDs.\n\n“Diary of a Lost Girl commentary.” Kino Lorber, 2015.\n\n— I authored the audio commentary accompanying this DVD / Blu-ray release, a restoration of what is regarded as a classic silent film. My commentary was singled out or mentioned by a handful of media outlets including Popmatters, High-Def Digest, DVD Talk, and the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle.\n\n“In this masterful restoration, from archival 35mm elements, Diary benefits from an incisive commentary by the director of the Louise Brooks Society Thomas Gladysz.” — Boston Herald\n\n“There are only a few bonus features, the most interesting being an informative audio commentary by writer and Louise Brooks Society director Thomas Gladysz.” — High Plains Reader\n\n“Beggars of Life commentary.” Kino Lorber, 2017.\n\n— I authored one of two audio commentaries which accompany this DVD / Blu-ray release, which was named one of the best of the year by three noted critics — not bad for a silent film! Additionally, my commentary was singled out or mentioned by a handful of media outlets including Films in Review, Combustible Celluloid, Film International, Home Media Magazine and the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle .\n\n“Brooks scholar Thomas Gladysz provides a very informative commentary on this excellent restoration.” — PopMatters\n\n“Gladysz, who’s the founding director of the Louise Brooks Society, also goes into great detail about the studio production of the film, and the stories of its stars.” — Texas Public Radio (NPR).\n\nWhat follows is a checklist of some of the world-wide media about or referencing the Louise Brooks Society.
