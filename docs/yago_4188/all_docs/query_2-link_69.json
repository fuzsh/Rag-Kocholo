        "text": "Directed by Ridley Scott.\n\nWritten by Callie Khouri.\n\nThelma (Geena Davis) & Louise (Susan Sarandon) are two small-town BFFs who, one weekend, decide to take a road trip to a friend’s cabin to go fishing (even though neither of them knows how to fish…but hey, as Louise says, “Darryl does it, so how hard could it be?”).\n\n(Darryl (Christopher McDonald) is Thelma’s controlling-ass, car-salesman, likely philanderer of a husband. Thelma was supposed to ask him permission to go on this trip – but he probably would’ve said no, because he’s a jackass – so instead she just leaves a note, & drives off with Louise like a fucking bandit.)\n\nWoohoo! You go girl.\n\nI love how from the shots of Thelma & Louise packing, you get a subtle first glance at their personalities – Louise meticulously packs everything in individual ziplock bags within her suitcase (um, cough – hello – that’s me!)…while Thelma literally just dumps some random shit in a bag & then wipes her hands of the whole endeavor.\n\nHaving officially commenced their long drive cabin-ward – Thelma makes Louise stop at a divey roadside bar (“I haven’t seen a place like this since I left Texas,” Louise says) – because this is their vacation, damn it! And a vacation must always feature at least one segment of dive-ily fun spontaneity! Duh!\n\nImmediately, the pair is hit on by an annoying smarm of a man named Harlan (Timothy Carhart)…and by my describing him as such – you can tell that I once again find myself identifying with Louise – because as he approaches, she rolls her eyes & is essentially like, ‘Fuck off, man. Ain’t nobody got time for that.’ Of course, Thelma – by contrast – is smiley & inviting & says some engaging things like, “Oh, I have an uncle named Harlan!”\n\n(Boy, do I know some unnecessarily friendly bar flirts like that. Can’t take ’em anywhere…and if you do, you gotta watch ’em like a goddamn mother-police hawk.)\n\nOh! Whaddaya know! Creepy Harlan is exactly that – a creep named Harlan – and tries to assault Thelma in the darkened parking lot.\n\nTHIS IS WHY YOU DON’T ENGAGE WITH OVERLY FORWARD MAN-STRANGERS IN BARS, CHILDREN!!!\n\nLouise arrives just in time to save the day…and shoots Rapey Harlan the Smarm dead.\n\nNow…(sigh)…why they don’t immediately run inside & call the police – since Thelma is literally covered in physical evidence of Harlan’s violent intentions (her dress is ripped, her face is bleeding, etc.), so self-defense is clearly provable – I do not know…except that this is Movie World, and I guess if they’d done that, we wouldn’t have much of a film (or at least – it’d be a wildly different one). So (again – sigh)…let’s just roll with it, out of love & respect for the hallowed, nonsensical rules of Movie World.\n\nSarandon & Davis play the post-shooting reactions – of fear, shock, & panic – excellently.\n\nI find it problematic that when they stop at the motel to try to figure out what to do next – Louise tells Thelma to “go take a swim or something.” Logically, this makes no sense. Why on earth would traumatized Thelma go swim in the roadside-motel pool right now?\n\nWell – then you see the shot of Geena Davis in a skimpy two-piece bathing suit, and remember that Ridley Scott directed this film, and are then like, ‘Oh. Now it ‘makes sense.’ Goddamn it.’ Because of course Ridley Scott needs to have the pretty woman in a bathing suit – not just for the one shot – but so when Louise pulls up with the car, Thelma can hop up & into said car, still only clad in her skimpy two-piece.\n\nGroan on a stick.\n\nHowever! However. Before “we” get too carried away – let us remember that all’s fair in movies & war (?)…and soon, we will meet 28-year-old, cowboy-hatted Brad Pitt – who will be shown both shirtless and clad in rain-soaked denim.\n\nSooo…I dunno, y’all. Maybe we just call it even.\n\nOh, meanwhile – Thelma & Louise telephone their significant others. Louise’s (Jimmy, played by Michael Madsen) turns out to be a semi-gem, who – asking no questions – agrees to wire her all the money she’s got in her bank account…while Thelma’s (Dumbass Darryl, who’s unfortunately still a thing) winds up being precisely the sort of asshat douchebag we already knew he was – aggressively demanding that Thelma return home “TONIGHT!” (“Or else!”).\n\n“Go fuck yourself,” Thelma AT LAST tells Dumbass Darryl, then hangs up the payphone, like a goddamn hero.\n\nYessss, Thelma! Yes.\n\nLouise decides they’re fleeing to Mexico (Thelma, post-Darryl phone call, accepts this mission)…and soon they’re on their way – with gorgeous hitchhiker Brad Pitt (aka: J.D.) taking up temporary residence in their car’s backseat.\n\nTurns out Jimmy (Louise’s boyfriend) is even more of a gem than we thought – ’cause instead of wiring Louise the money, as requested – he fucking hops on a plane to OKC to say farewell to her in person. Still not asking any questions, and bringing her a pseudo-engagement ring to keep, just because he can.\n\nWhat?! What a standup guy! (I mean, minus the part where he’s aiding a likely criminal in her flee-escape from justice. But…you get what I’m saying.)\n\nAlso, Madsen does a solid job in the role – particularly in the “What color are my eyes?” scene with Sarandon in the motel room.\n\n…Are you shitting me? Does Thelma only have like…two brain cells??? She leaves all of their money – not even in a drawer, or something – but ON the fucking nightstand…in a room with an unsupervised guy who has admitted to her that he’s a fucking ROBBER?!\n\nAre you shitting me?!\n\nThelma, dear – I don’t care how good cowboy-hatted, wet-denim Brad was in bed – he’s a robber and that was all the money y’all had!!!\n\nSusan Sarandon nails Louise’s reaction to this development. Poor kid.\n\nLuckily, Thelma paid attention to Robber J.D.’s shirtless, hairdryer-aided holdup demonstration – and she employs his “lesson” to perfection, successfully robbing a market, once the ladies have hit the road again. Louise, of course, flips out, but\n\n“What? It’s not like I killed someone,” Thelma says in response.\n\nHaaaaa.\n\nBy the way – Harvey Keitel has come aboard the plot-train as Hal, the police detective on the ladies’ (now semi-extensive) crime trail.\n\nBrad Pitt is an adorable hoot in this film. I was always under the impression that he was just around as a one-scene piece of eye-candy…but his continued reappearance actually gives his character the opportunity for some substance – and young Mr. Pitt does not disappoint.\n\nAhahaha. All it takes for Thelma to know that Darryl’s been contacted by the police & that the phone’s been tapped is him saying “Hello” in the borderline-polite manner he does. That’s fucking hilarious.\n\n(Also – appearing in that scene, next to Darryl…is a lamp that is a fish tank?! What! Who knew such a thing was possible! It’s totally bizarre, and I love it.)\n\n(To be clear – I don’t give a shit about fish or fish tanks…I just think the fact that A) a fish-tank lamp is a thing and B) Thelma & Darryl own one is magical.\n\nThelma, after they hold up a police officer & lock him in his own car’s trunk: “You know…I know it’s crazy – but I feel like I got a knack for this shit.”\n\nLouise: “I believe you do. Drive like hell.”\n\nI love that the pair pulls over the Asshat Truck Driver (his name is Earl…because of course it is) to make him apologize for his lewd & disgusting behavior – however, I do not love the actor’s performance when he reacts to them exploding his truck with gunfire. His arm-waving delivery of “You bitches! You bitches!” is super unconvincing & a total buzzkill. For as small a part as it is…you’d think they’d’ve been able to find someone better to play it.\n\nThe makeup, wardrobe, & hair departments did marvelous jobs on the progression (digression?) of Thelma & Louise from ‘primped & tidy’ to ‘dirty & haggard.’\n\nThere are some beautiful shots of the car & its accompanying dust cloud, as the pair drives through the postcard-ish landscapes…on their way to their inevitable, legendary demise.\n\nSo……here’s the thing. There are parts of this film that I really enjoyed – and I appreciate the unusually prolonged, unwavering spotlight it puts on the two titular female characters – but in the end, I was left feeling extremely disappointed & disheartened. Because, like – when it comes to strong, “amazing” woman characters…this is the best we can do???\n\nFirst, let me say: Louise? Bravo. Love her. I’m here for it.\n\nBut Thelma…?\n\nShe’s a fucking dolt, man! And that sucks!\n\nBecause, look – this whole movie plays out as the semi-tragic, epic catastrophe it does because of – almost exclusively – Thelma’s idiocy. (And before anyone chimes in with a “Don’t be a bully to the dumb girl!” – let me be crystal clear about the kind of idiocy I’m talking about…because I’m not downing Thelma for having a low IQ or not listening to enough NPR.)\n\nMy problem is that the character of Thelma is written as common-sense stupid…not all the time – but primarily in moments when a romantically interested man is around. I mean, think about it: the two most grievous, plot-altering, fate-sinking incidents in this film are 1) Thelma becoming flirt-dazed stupid with Creepy Harlan, forcing Louise to become a murderess, and 2) Thelma becoming lust-blind stupid, allowing J.D. the Robber to abscond with Louise’s life savings (i.e., the ladies’ only chance at an honest, non-crime-funded future life together).\n\nSo…perhaps it’s not that Thelma is stupid – it’s that Thelma is man-stupid. And for that to be a story-defining quality of a character so frequently pointed to as one of the most amazing, badass film heroines of all time…again, I have to say:\n\nThis is the best we can do?\n\nThat pisses me off.\n\n(The End.)\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
