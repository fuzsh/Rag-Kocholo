        "text": "‘Louise’: an underrated animated short film about the dark history of ballet\n\nFor centuries, ballet performances have been popularly attended – admired for their ability to tell stories through elegant movement, set to stunning classical compositions. Watching performances of tales like Swan Lake and The Nutcracker is a staple form of festive entertainment for millions of people, becoming an essential part of the Christmas period.\n\nClearly, ballet has always entertained audiences, although it possesses a complex dark side. It is not so secret that eating disorders are rife within the industry, with the pressures to remain stick thin and flat-chested taking its toll on many ballerinas, especially those who began dancing before puberty, suddenly put at odds with their developing bodies.\n\nThe competitive and obsessive nature of ballet has been explored in movies such as Black Swan and The Red Shoes, but much less prominent in cinematic depictions of the dance style is the issue of prostitution. In the earlier days of ballet, many dancers were forced into selling their bodies. It was common for men to be attracted to watching young ballerinas, whose bodies were at the centre of their art form, wearing little more than short tutus, leotards and sheer tights.\n\nThus, many ballerinas were exploited by male audience members, who were often theatre or dance school patrons. They manipulated their power to gain sexual gratification, leaving many ballerinas isolated, fearful and unhappy. Louise, a French animated short film made as a graduation project, uncovers the harsh realities of prostitution and ballet in the 1800s with poignancy.\n\nDirected by Constance Bertoux, Camille Bozec, Pauline Guitton, Pauline Mauviere, and Mila Monaghan as their final project at Gobelins School in Paris, Louise uses beautiful 2D animation to uncover the tragedy and corruption at the heart of a seemingly pure profession.\n\nThe film uses rich shadows to depict the backstage atmosphere after a ballet, with images of men propositioning ballerinas littered in the background, all of whom are considerably older than the young dancers. Louise is one of the ballerinas who must resort to prostitution in order to pay her friend back, who pressures her by stating, “I have rent to pay!” A close-up of Louise’s disheartened face ensues, leading her to search for a man who will give her the money she needs – in exchange for sex.\n\nThe animation is gorgeous, yet the contrast between these gentle brushstrokes and scenes of reluctant sexual exchange is heartbreaking to witness. Animated sex scenes are a rare sight; even more rare are animated scenes of rape and assault, but Louise depicts this delicately. Close-ups of Louise’s discomfort or otherwise emotionless face, the man’s tight grasp on her shoulder and legs, and emphasis on her dainty ballet shoes standing next to his plain black shoes all work together to create a truly affecting sequence.\n\nThe short is highly underrated but an essential watch for anyone interested in the history of ballet, alternative animation and feminism. Watch the film below."
