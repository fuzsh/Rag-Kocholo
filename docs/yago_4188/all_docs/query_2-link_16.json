        "text": "How did you first come up with this idea ?\n\nAs we were looking for ideas, one of us remembered an exhibition she had seen a few years back at the Orsay myseym, called Splendeurs et misères. It depicted the various forms of prositution in Paris from 1850 to 1910. One thing leading to another, we discussed the ballerinas of the Opéra Garnier who had to resort to prositution to survive. We found the subject fascinating, as it is not very well known. We thought it was an interesting topic to explore, especially in animation.\n\nWhat were your inspirations ?\n\nWhen we decided to focus on this topic, specific artists came to mind : Edgar Degas, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec or Jean-Louis Forain. However, we did not want to be stuck in these very well known visuals and we tried to modernize it by playing with the lighting and cinematographic compositions. We dew inspiration from movies such as the Grandmaster, House of Tolerance or even photographs like Tarkosvky's polaroids. We also looked at graphic novels by Manuele Fior or paintings by Edouard Vuillard to find the visual look of the movie."
