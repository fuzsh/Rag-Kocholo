He enjoyed making sure his yard looked nice. You could always find him out in his garage tinkering with something. He loved to watch westerns and was named after western actors, Gene Autry and Larry Munro. A genuinely good and kind man who always looked after his family, often putting them before himself and enjoyed spending time with his kids and grandkids. He worked for Stokely Van Camp and Square Shooters as a maintenance superintendent and could fix just about anything.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, his brother, and a son, William. He is survived by his wife, three children, seven grandchildren, five great-grandchildren, and sister.\n\nHe and his kind heart will be truly missed."
