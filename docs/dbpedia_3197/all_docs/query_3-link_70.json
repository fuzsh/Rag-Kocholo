        "text": "James Donald Schlink Jr., “Schlinky”, of Carmel, Indiana passed away peacefully on Monday, November 27, 2023, after a long battle with Parkinsons and heart disease.\n\nJim was born in Peru, Indiana on March 21, 1942, to father James D. Schlink, Sr. and mother Maxine Sweeney Schlink.\n\nUpon first meeting Schlinky, you would have noticed his beautiful smile and bright blue eyes. Then, he would extend his hand to shake yours and you would hear his deep, clear voice letting you know how glad he was to meet you. Jim had a joyous laugh and the ability to draw people to him, which accounted for his many friends throughout the years.\n\nIt was those very traits that made Jim a natural at sales. He started his sales career with Lemon pharmaceuticals until being hired by Novartis (formerly Sandoz) in 1966. Jim’s integrity and unshakeable dedication to his peers, team and customers made him an exceptional candidate for his eventual rise to Senior District Manager. He has been honored as salesman of the year and awarded District of the Year on 3 separate occasions as well as the Master Club award. Before retiring in 2000, his General Manager said, “Because of Jim’s ability to inspire and empower and his intimate understanding of our business, he is respected by colleagues throughout our organization.”\n\nJim’s faith journey began early where he was raised in the Catholic Church and attended and graduated from St. Francis De Sales Boys School in Toledo Ohio. Later in life he was baptized on August 7, 2010 at Grace Church in Noblesville, Indiana. He served as a volunteer at Grace Church where he would teach the Bible to the 2–3-year-olds.\n\nTo know Jim was to know his love for food (especially sweets), animals (especially dogs) and his generosity. His generosity was so sincere that it has influenced many of us for the better. He also loved to play golf, cards and watch sports – especially his Ohio State Buckeyes.\n\nJim is preceded in death by his parents and by his brothers Austin Schlink and Joseph Schlink and grandson Rece James Schlink. He is survived by his wife Jamie Schlink; and ex-wife Susie (Gail) Raehn; children James D. Schlink III, and Timothy John “TJ” Schlink and daughter, Susie Marie Schlink; stepchildren Matthew Ford and Luke Ford, grandchildren Alexis Nicole Schlink and Luke Austin Schlink. Step-grandchildren Nella Ford and Charlie Ford. Sister-in-law Claudia Campbell (James), Laura Morgan (Dave), brother-in-law Thomas Corey (Andrea), and many more loving relatives.\n\nDuring his struggle with Parkinson’s Jim was well cared for by the staff at Transitions and his personal care givers Bria Gholson and Barb Stein.\n\nA private celebration of life for the family will be held on Saturday, December 2, 2023.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, contributions can be made to:\n\nVictory Lane Camp for Special Needs Children\n\n1912 Bundy Ave.\n\nNew Castle, IN 47362\n\nwww.Victorylanecamp.org\n\nHelping Challenged Children, Inc.\n\n3831 Earhart Drive\n\nCarmel, IN 46074\n\nwww.indianahcci.org\n\nAmerican Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA)\n\nwww.ASPCA.org"
