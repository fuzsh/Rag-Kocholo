        "text": "James Holton\n\nJames Donald Holton, 75, of Amarillo, TX passed away on April 23, 2024.\n\nA Memorial Service will be held at 4:00 P.M., Monday, April 29, 2024, at Boxwell Brothers Ivy Chapel with Dr. G. A. Roach officiating. Arrangements are by Boxwell Brothers Funeral Directors, 2800 Paramount Blvd.\n\nJames was born in Amarillo, Texas on September 20, 1948, to Donna Jean And Jack Holton.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, Donna Jean and Jack Holton.\n\nSurvivors include his wife, Mary Ann Lane Holton; brother, Phil Holton (Vickie) of Santa Fe, NM, sister, Mary Simones (Mike) of Dallas, his three sons, Seth Holton (Rena) of Bushland, TX, Miles Holton (Natalie) of Amarillo, Texas, and William Holton (Callie) of Amarillo, Texas; grandchildren, Elizabeth Holton, Abagail Compson (Jasper), Samuel Holton, Shane Holton, Harry Holton, and George Holton; step-grandchildren, Caitlyn, and Josette and great-grandson Coleman Compson.\n\nJames Holton started working in fields north of Amarillo, Texas, pulling one-way plows behind a cabless tractor before he was old enough to drive a car.\n\nHe found a passion for music, specifically jazz, when he learned to play drums at an early age. His love for creating music would lead him to jam in a garage with friends and then to play in local venues, leading to contracts to play all over the USA. He even had the opportunity to play overseas for the USO during the Vietnam War. Shortly after returning home to the US, he met Mary Ann Lane, who would later become his wife. Mary Ann recalls fondly their days as a young couple, traveling on the music scene.\n\nAfter settling down and starting a family with Mary Ann, he began working in construction. His artistic spirit found a niche when he discovered a talent for millwork and opened his business, Heritage Millworks. Becoming an entrepreneur in his cabinet and later custom door shop gave him great pride as he again excelled in making a career of creative endeavors. Notable projects of Heritage Millworks include the Santa Fe building downtown, the grand doors at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church, and countless homes and offices in the Panhandle. His influence in the craft spread well outside our community, and his sons can recount tales of the time they assisted him in building doors for the Temple of Israel. He enjoyed the opportunity to share his passion and skill in the trade with his sons, and they will forever cherish the memories made and lessons learned alongside their father in his shop.\n\nJames and Mary raised their boys on Mary's family farm in Bushland, Texas. When the boys started to enjoy their mother's business and wanted to take ownership of farm operations, he couldn't have shifted his focus any faster. After selling Heritage Millworks to a trusted partner, James focused on working the farm with his adult sons. In his final years, he had not only his boys but also his grandchildren working alongside him. His grandchildren all remember riding tractors and checking the wheat with PaPa. His first passion had come full circle; this time, he shared it with his whole family."
