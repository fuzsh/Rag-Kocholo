        "text": "1914-1918\n\nTo commemorate the centenary of the First World War, over a period of four years we produced short accounts of those named on our War Memorial.\n\nAlfred Donald\n\nAlfred Donald died on 2nd May 1917. He was a stoker 1st Class in the Royal Navy. He has no known grave as his body was not recovered for burial.\n\nBorn in Clapton on 1 March 1897 he joined the Navy on 7 June 1915. He had been an engine fitter. He served on HMS Derwent, a River class destroyer and was killed in a mine explosion in the English Channel. On 2 May 1917 she struck a contact mine laid by German submarine UC-26 off Le Havre, France. She sank 2 cables north of Whistle Buoy at position 49°31’N 000°02’W with the loss of 58 officers and men.\n\nHis mother, Adelaide, lived in Stanley Gardens in Acton.\n\nAlfred George Warman and Albert Edward Warman\n\nAlfred and Albert were both born in Acton, Alfred in 1889 and Albert in 1891. In the 1901 census they are shown as living in Petersfield Road. Their father, Charles, was a general labourer, and their mother was called Florence. Charles originally came from Wiltshire and Florence was born in Oxfordshire. There was also a sister called Edith who was born in 1886.\n\nBy 1911 the family had moved to Steyne Road although Alfred was no longer living with the family as he had joined the army in 1906. He had previously been a general labourer at the Belgrove Laundry in Pimlico. Albert’s occupation in the 1911 census is shown as a fish hawker, His father was now a builder’s labourer, and Florence worked as a laundress. In 1911 Alfred was serving with the 5th Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers in Meerut in India.\n\nWhen war broke out Alfred was a lance-corporal in the Princess of Wales’ (Royal Berkshire Regiment) and sailed to France in November 1914. He was killed in action on 25th September, 1915 and is buried in the White City Cemetery, Bois-Grenier in northern France.\n\nAlbert served in the 4th Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment) and was killed in action on the 16th June, 1915. He has no known grave but is named on the Menin Gate in Ypres.\n\nFrank H Drury\n\nFrank Herbert Drury was born on 31st August 1899 and died of wounds on 24th June 1918 aged 18. He was originally a Rifleman in 15th (City of London) Battalion the London Regiment, London Rifle Brigade but was later transferred to the 5th Battalion. He is buried in Aubigny Communal Cemetery Extension. He was awarded the British War Medal, and Victory Medal. His parents were Arthur Miles and Theresa Drury of 7 Park Road North Acton. In 1901 he was living at 108 Shakespeare Road and he had a brother, Arthur age 6, and a sister, Edith aged 5. By 1911 they had moved to 13 Goldsmith Road.\n\nBracton Bagley\n\nHe was born Arthur Bracton Bagley in Rangoon, Burma on 6th March 1891. From records of passenger lists it appears the Bagley family lived or worked in Rangoon and a number of family members made journeys back and forward to the UK. Bracton was a boarder at Stoneygates School in Leicester in the 1901 census.\n\nHe was commissioned into the 3rd Battalion The Royal Dublin Fusiliers from the Cambridge University contingent Officers Training Corps on 26th October 1910 to be a 2nd Lieutenant (on probation) and by the 1911 census he was based at Tournay Barracks, Marlborough at Aldershot. He was awarded an aviator’s certificate by the Royal Aero Club following a flight in a Maurice Farman biplane at the Central School of Flying at Upavon Airfield on 2nd October 1914.\n\nIn 1915 he married Kathleen Georgina Nelson Fernslade-Speed.\n\nOn 17th April 1917 his award of the Military Cross was placed in the London Gazette. He had by now been promoted to Captain and the citation reads:\n\n“His Majesty the King has been graciously pleased to award the Military Cross in recognition of conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty in the Field. He forced his way through uncut wire into the trench and killed two of the enemy. Later, finding his company could not get through the wire, he returned and organised bomb-throwing parties while the wire was being cut.”\n\nSadly, having fought in France for most of the war, Bracton died of wounds on 29th October 1918, less than a fortnight before the war ended. At the time of his death he was in the 2nd Battalion Royal Dublin Fusiliers attached to the 8th Battalion. He is buried in Mont Huon Military Cemetery at Le Treport in France. Le Treport is a small town near to Dieppe which was a centre for hospitals at the time.\n\nAt the time of his death his widow Kathleen is stated as living at The Paveys, Langton Green in Kent. Probate was granted to her in January 1919 when Bracton’s address is given as 7 Upper Mount Street Dublin and his estate was valued at £527 12s 6d.\n\nHis widow Kathleen did not remarry and died in 1981 in Hampshire.\n\nIt is hard to be certain why he is commemorated on our War Memorial but in the 1911 census an Ann Bagley, aged 54 and unmarried, was living at 56 Maldon Road – from her age she may have been his aunt.\n\nJames George Ayres\n\nBorn in Acton in 1897, the sixth of eight children of William and Elizabeth Ayres. The family was originally from Islington where Elizabeth Ayres was born and they moved to Acton it appears in 1894.\n\nIn the 1901 census the family was living at 3 Back Street, Steyne, Acton and by 1911 they had moved to 60 Shakespeare Road. By this stage some of the older children had left leaving James at home and going to school with two younger siblings, Arthur 11, Dorothy 9, and two older brothers, William aged 20 working as a barman, and Albert aged 15 working as vanguard. Their father William was a cabman.\n\nJames joined the Royal Field Artillery and was probably posted to France when he was 19 in mid-1917. He died of wounds at the age of 20 on 3rd December 1917. He was a gunner and is buried at Tincourt New British Cemetery on the Somme. Tincourt was a casualty clearing station so he was probably brought there having being injured elsewhere.\n\nAlfred William Dudman\n\nAlfred William Dudman died on 31st December 1917 aged 25. He was an Air Mechanic 3rd Class in the Royal Flying Corps. He is buried in Alexandria (Hadra) War Memorial Cemetery.\n\nHe was the son of Thomas J and Ellen Dudman of 53 Mill Hill Grove. In 1901 Thomas, a painter and decorator, was living with his wife Ellen, son Alfred aged 9, May aged 6 and Stanley aged 2. By 1911 the family had grown with the addition of Lily then aged 9, Albert 7, Ivy 6 and Ruby 4.\n\nHe was drowned in the loss of HMS Osmanieh by a mine explosion off Alexandria.\n\nWilliam E Baldwin\n\nWilliam Earnest Baldwin was born in 1889 in St Pancras, London. He was the fifth child and youngest son of Frederick Alfred and Sara Baldwin and Frederick was the owner of a steam laundry.\n\nIn 1905 the family moved to Acton and Frederick became the owner of one of the largest laundries in Acton, the Empire Steam Laundry on the Steyne. At the time of the 1911 census the family were living at Springfield, Springfield Road and William is described as a laundry manager. They also employed three live-in servants.\n\nAs well as being named on our war memorial William is also mentioned on the memorial to his father which is near the organ.\n\nFrederick went on to become the first mayor of Acton and died in 1924.\n\nWilliam joined the Berkshire Yeomanry and was sent out with them on the Gallipoli campaign in 1915. He was involved in the assault on Hill 70, known as the Battle of Scimitar Hill and was wounded and presumed dead on the first day of the battle, 21st August 1915 at the age of 26. It was the largest single day attack in the Gallipoli campaign and there were over 5000 British casualties in one day.\n\nWilliam is remembered at Green Hill Cemetery, Turkey where he is believed to be buried. He is also named on the Berkshire Yeomanry memorial at Windsor.\n\nJames Herbert Rolfe\n\nJames was born in Acton in 1892 and was the youngest of six children born to Henry and Alice Rolfe. Henry was a bootmaker and his wife and two of James’s three sisters were laundresses, and his eldest brother, also called Henry, was a general labourer. Henry originally lived at 1 Billington Place but by 1901 the family had moved to Steyne Road. At the time of the 1911 census James was working as a newsagent.\n\nJames joined the 6th Battalion of the Duke of Cambridge's Own (Middlesex Regiment) as a private. On 30th December, 1917 James was aboard the troopship “Aragon” waiting to enter Alexandria harbour when it was torpedoed by a German U-boat. The ship sank within 15 minutes with the loss of 380 officers and men.\n\nHis name is recorded on the Chatby Memorial in Alexandria.\n\nHerbert J Ellams\n\nHerbert John Ellams died on 30th September, 1915 recorded as aged 21 (actually 20, born 10th January 1895).

In 1911 he is a greengrocer’s assistant, still living at 23 Steyne Road. But this time he is described as a grandson, and in addition Annie Elizabeth 37, John and Ann’s daughter, is also living there.\n\nIn 1914 he was employed by the Great Western Railway at Old Oak Common, his marriage certificate describes him as an engine cleaner. He started work 7 September 1914 but resigned in December. Presumably he lost his life at the Battle of Loos.\n\nFrancis Arthur Noel Brown\n\nFrancis was born in Twickenham on 26th December 1897 (which presumably explains his third name) and was baptised on 26th February 1898 at St Mary’s Twickenham. His father, George Arthur (who appears to have been known as Arthur) was a solicitor and his mother’s name was Else. In 1901 the family was living at 25 Queen’s Road in Twickenham.\n\nBy the 1911 census they had moved to 13 Elmwood Gardens in Acton and Francis has a younger sister, Margaret, born around 1902.\n\nFrancis was commissioned on 20th September 1915 into the 1/7h Battalion Worcestershire’s (which was a territorial regiment) having started as a private in the 28th London Regiment (which was also a territorial regiment). He went to France on 7th March 1916 and died during the battle of the Somme on 21st July 1916 during the fighting for the villages of Ovilliers and La Boiselle.\n\nIn addition to being remembered on our war memorial there is also a brass plaque to him on the wall about half way down the church.

He died in the Persian Gulf, then in Mesopotamia, on 11th March 1917 and is named on the Basra Memorial in what is now Iraq. Until 1997 the Basra Memorial was located on the main quay of the naval dockyard at Maqil, on the west bank of the Shatt-al-Arab, about 8 kilometres north of Basra.\n\nUntil 1997 the Basra Memorial was located on the main quay of the naval dockyard at Maqil, on the west bank of the Shatt-al-Arab, about 8 kilometres north of Basra. Because of the sensitivity of the site, the Memorial was moved by presidential decree. The move, carried out by the authorities in Iraq, involved a considerable amount of manpower, transport costs and sheer engineering on their part, and the Memorial has been re-erected in its entirety. The Basra Memorial is now located 32 kilometres along the road to Nasiriyah, in the middle of what was a major battleground during the first Gulf War.\n\nStephen Thomas Freeth\n\nStephen Thomas Freeth died on 26 September 1916.
