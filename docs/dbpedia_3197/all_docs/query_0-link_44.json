I still think of the time we went fishing and I was yelling at him to quit messing with the fish on his line and pull it in. Then he saw that I would yank the fish in and not play with them and from that day on he would always ask when we would rip some fish lips again. I still remember his guttural laugh when he conned me into cleaning fish that day! You will be missed old man and keep on fishing and catch them fish until we can go again.\n\n- Ed Stewart, Tallahassee, Florida\n\nPhillip I had some great times on the water with you.

You were what made me love the car business. You taught me everything there was to know and I don’t know if I would be where I am today if it wasn’t for you. I remember the last time I saw you, you told me you were proud of how far I have come from that little 18 year old girl who first started at Savannah Toyota and I will forever remember all the advice and love you gave me when my mom died last year. You will forever be one of my favorite people and I will miss you dearly. Catch some fish for us. Love you old man.\n\n- Christina Wiggins, Tallahassee, Florida\n\nLora and family, My deepest condolences Phillip was my Service Advisor for all my cars at Savannah Toyota over a period of 10 years When my wife was dealing with cancer, he would always ask about her When she passed June 2020,he offered sincere condolences He was an outstanding and caring person I'm glad he touched my life! - Barry R Doepp Richmond Hill, Georgia\n\n- Barry Doepp, Richmond Hill , Georgia\n\nLora, I am sorry for your loss, for our loss. I met Phillip about 7 years ago in Eulonia. His big smile and welcoming nature were hard to avoid and even harder, not to live. He often talked about the importance of his family to him and his deep love for them. I believe I met you in my coffee shop in Darien when you and Phillip were in town for second Saturday or something, if there is anything I can do please do not hesitate to ask. Even though Phillip band I did not stay in constant contact, it was always if we had anytime we had a chance to spend an hour or so together. God Bless.\n\n- Chad Simpson , Darien, Ga\n\nLora, wishing you strength in the caring of friends and family and hope that time will gently soothe your sadness into peace. I have thought of you often over the past years and I am so sorry for your loss.\n\n- Lori and Richard Masterson, THE VILLAGES, FL\n\nPhillip was my Service Advisor at Toyota for many, many years and I can honestly say that I bought my second Toyota because of him and the wonderful care he took with his customers! He would tease me because I insisted on driving a minivan…..he thought I should drive something more sporty!! I knew that he would always look out for me and he never failed to ask about my family. I will miss you my friend. My prayers are with all the family.\n\n- Mo Field, Savannah , Ga\n\nMy deepest condolences to the family. Phillip was and will always be such a special man.

Savannah Toyota will never be the same.\n\n- Vanessa Collini, Savannah, Georgia\n\nLora and family, you have my deepest sympathy. I have many, many fond memories of Phillip through the years, from Thanksgiving at Grandmama's house to their family visits to NC to the many family reunions we've held in recent years. I am thankful I was able to spend some of his last days with him. Even though he was in the hospital and not feeling well, he kept me laughing and I hope I was able to bring a little cheer to him. Much love and many prayers.\n\n- Carmen Freeman, Hilton Head, SC\n\nI was very sorry to learn of Phillip's passing. He was a class ahead of me at SCS. He played basketball for the Raiders; I played football, and we were both on the track and field team. It was always a delight to be in his company. It seemed like he was always smiling or laughing about something, and even when he wasn't, it always seemed like he was on the verge of smiling or laughing about something, as if he was fighting to hold it back. I shall carry nothing but the fondest recollections of Phillip to my own grave. Peace, love, and blessings of comfort to his family. One picture is from the 1980 Buick Catalog for their Skyhawk model. Phillip is on the front porch coming out the door in the green shirt and red striped socks. Wesley Allen, SCS '79, who was also in the photoshoot for the catalog, sent it to me yesterday. When he learned of Phillip's passing over the weekend, Wesley ordered the catalog on ebay so that he could share the picture with Phillip's family. The other picture is of Phillip showing perfect form on his jump shot while playing basketball for the Raiders his senior year.\n\n- Charles Zimmerman, ROSWELL, GA\n\nI recently had the pleasure of meeting Phillip just this year while visiting his dealership for work. His presence and personality was always positive and inviting. Even when just walking pass him, he always smiles and/or makes a joke to just lift you up without looking for anything in return. He was such a genuine person. It was a absolute pleasure meeting and working with Phillip. My condolences and prayers goes out his family and loved ones during these very hard days.\n\n- Lek Hendricks, Savannah , GA\n\nShine On Your Crazy Diamond\n\n- Annie, Belle Bluff , Georgia\n\nThis is the picture of Phillip from the 1980 Buick catalog. He's in the green shirt coming out the door. His SCS schoolmates Tom Turner, Riley Allen, and Wesley Allen, who provided the picture, were also part of the photoshoot. Peace, love, and blessings of comfort to Phillip's family.\n\n- Charles Zimmerman, ROSWELL, GA\n\nWe had Phillip as our Service Manager since 2006 and he was always helpful. Phillip always took care of us and was pleasant to work with. He will be greatly missed by us all. Our prayers and sympathy are extended to you.\n\n- Jamie/Joan Herbster, Savannah, GA\n\nWill always remember and love Uncle Phil. Such an amazing, charismatic man.\n\n- Hank Stokes, Powhatan , Virginia\n\nI just shocked to find out about Phillip's passing. Our heart-felt condolences go out the James family for your loss. Although it has been many years since we last spoke, I have very fond memories of Phillip from back in the day when we shared an apartment in Atlanta back in the 80's. Until we meet again on the other side my friend, Jack.\n\n- Jack & Ginny Colcock, Johns Creek, Georgia"
