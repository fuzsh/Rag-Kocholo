        "text": "Donald, who works at the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council in Swindon, smashed his personal best by almost 10 minutes as he finished 278th in the main race in an exceptional time of 2hrs 39mins 30secs.\n\n“It was a brilliant day,” said Donald.\n\n“I made a big improvement last year as well and I didn’t think I could do it again so I am not sure what happened there!\n\n“I think I was lucky that I was able to run with two of my Team Bath clubmates Luke Sturgess-Durden and Guy Landon and we really helped each other.\n\n“While we are competitive we all wanted each other to do well and we managed to stick together until 21 miles and that certainly helped.”\n\nDonald lost touch with his mates at that point as they surged on and while he obviously started to suffer in the closing miles he dug in to ensure he beat that elusive 2hrs 40mins barrier.\n\n“I knew I was on for sub 2hrs 40mins and when I saw the finish clock in the distance reading 2:39.05 I thought I had better give it a sprint to make sure I didn’t miss out!” added Donald.\n\n“I am just so pleased with my time.”\n\nDonald’s delight is understandable as it means in his last three races he has improved by 17 minutes – that is around three miles – which is outstanding by anyone’s standards.\n\n“I will be having a rest today and a big fry-up!” said Donald the morning after the race.\n\nFrom Swindon Harriers the leading man was veteran Peter Keen in a time of 3:07.50 with clubmate Bernard Merron just behind on 3:08.58.\n\nThat was a fine effort by the 61-year-old Merron as the time was only 1min 49secs off his 2012 best and gave him 11th place in the veterans M60 age category.\n\nFrom Highworth Running Club veteran Richard Burbidge clocked 3:09.49 while Cirencester AC’s leading runner was Simon Campbell, who finished 267th in 2:43.00.\n\nJenny Garth was the quickest Swindon Harrier in the women’s race with 4:06.18 ."
