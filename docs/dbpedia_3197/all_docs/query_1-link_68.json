At that time it was Australia's worst railway accident.\n\n​\n\nBut there has been many more tragedies in the local district and whether these have been work site accidents, motor car accidents, level crossing accidents, drownings in the district's creeks & pools and murders. Other tragedies have not happen in the district but the families of the district has had to mourn these events.\n\n​\n\nA sample of these tragedies have been recorded in various Victorian papers."
