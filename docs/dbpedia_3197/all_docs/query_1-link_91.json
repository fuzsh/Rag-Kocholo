        "text": "“It’s an honour,” Trump said in the TikTok video, which features footage of him waving to fans and posing for selfies at the Ultimate Fighting Championship fight in Newark, New Jersey, on Saturday.\n\nThe video ends with Trump telling the camera: “That was a good walk-on, right?”\n\nBy Sunday Trump had amassed more than 1.1 million followers and the post had garnered more than one million likes and 24 million views.\n\n“We will leave no front undefended and this represents the continued outreach to a younger audience consuming pro-Trump and anti-Biden content,” Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement about the campaign’s decision to join the platform.\n\n“There’s no place better than a UFC event to launch president Trump’s TikTok, where he received a hero’s welcome and thousands of fans cheered him on,” he added.\n\nDemocratic President Joe Biden signed legislation in April that could ban TikTok in the US, even as his campaign joined in February and has tried to work with influencers.\n\nTrump received an enthusiastic welcome at the fight, where the crowd broke into chants of “We love Trump!” and another insulting Mr Biden with an expletive.\n\nIt was Trump’s first public outing since a jury in New York found him guilty on Thursday on 34 charges of falsifying business records as part of a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election by covering up hush money payments made to a porn star who claimed she and Trump had sex.\n\nTrump has maintained he did nothing wrong and plans to appeal against the verdict. He will be sentenced on July 11.\n\nThroughout his campaign, Trump has used appearances at UFC fights to project an image of strength and to try to appeal to potential voters who may not closely follow politics or engage with traditional news sources.\n\nIt is also part of a broader effort to connect with young people and minority voters, particularly Latino and black men.\n\nTikTok, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, is another opportunity to reach those potential voters.\n\nThe platform has about 170 million users in the US, most of whom are young, a demographic that is especially hard for campaigns to reach because they shun television.\n\nAs president, Trump tried to ban TikTok through an executive order that said “the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned” by Chinese companies was a national security threat.\n\nThe courts blocked the action after TikTok sued.\n\nBoth the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that ByteDance could share user data such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers with China’s government.\n\nTikTok said it has never done that and would not, if asked.\n\nThe platform was a hot topic of debate during the 2024 Republican party primary campaign, with most candidates shunning its use.\n\nMany, including former vice president Mike Pence, called for TikTok to be banned in the US because of its connections with China\n\nTrump said earlier this year that he still believes TikTok posed a national security risk, but was opposed to banning it because that would help its rival, Facebook, which he continues to criticise over his 2020 election loss to Mr Biden.\n\n“Frankly, there are a lot of people on TikTok that love it. There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it,” Trump told CNBC.\n\nThe legislation signed by Mr Biden gives ByteDance nine months to sell the company, with a possible additional three months if a sale is in progress.\n\nIf it does not, TikTok will be banned. Mr Biden barred the app on most government devices in December 2022.\n\nHis re-election campaign nonetheless uses the app, which it joined the night of the Super Bowl in February.\n\nAides say that in an increasingly fragmented modern media environment, the campaign must get its message out to voters via as many platforms as possible, including TikTok as well as WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.\n\nMr Biden’s “bidenhq” account currently has more than 330,000 followers and 4.5 million likes.\n\nTrump’s appearance at Saturday’s fight came after he had given an interview to Fox News Channel’s Fox & Friends Weekend that aired on Sunday.\n\nIn the interview Trump said he was “OK” with the prospect of potential jail time or house arrest, saying it was “the way it is”.\n\nBut he again suggested people might not accept such a punishment for a former president now running to return to the White House.\n\n“I don’t know that the public would stand it, you know. I’m not sure the public would stand for it,” he said. “I think it would be tough for the public to take. You know, at a certain point there’s a breaking point.”\n\nTrump, as he has throughout the trial, maintained his innocence, saying he “did absolutely nothing wrong”.\n\nHe was asked how his wife, former first lady Melania Trump, has taken the news.\n\n“She’s fine. But I think it’s very hard for her. I mean, she’s fine. But, you know, she has to read all this crap,” he said.\n\nShe did not appear with Trump in court at any point during his seven-week trial."
