Ladewig\n\nif you do not wish to have your name listed, or if you have any\n\ncomments or corrections, please contact me\n\nNote: One of the original spellings of the surname was AVANCE (French) and then AVANT (U.S.A.). However, during the 1901 Mississippi census an 's' was added to the end of the surname. Even though people relocated, the use of the added 's' at the end of the surname has fluctuated. To have consistency for this search, I've opted to use \"Avants\".\n\nGeneration No. 1\n\n1. BENJAMIN JACKSON AVANTS was born abt. 1816 in TN.
