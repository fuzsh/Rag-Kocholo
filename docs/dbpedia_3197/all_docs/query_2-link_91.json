        "text": "Glover in Mere\n\nHi, I'm tracing the family of my great-grandfather, Sidney George Glover, who came to South Australia around 1848. He was married twice (Ellen Elizabeth Scanlon and Martha Manning Burchell). His father is given as Charles Glover, collar maker, from Mere. I have some likely hints - a Charles Glover married to Mary Ann Stephenson; then a previous Charles Glover (barber died 1838 perhaps) married to Mary Ann Moors. Where I'm uncertain is the verification from the Moors to the previous Glover generation. It gives the name as Semei Glover (harness maker) married to Dinah Perrot who had children William, Charles, Priscilla, George Semei (died 1828). Neither Priscilla nor Semei appear in the names of Sidney's children but all 17 children (three women) seem to have strong family names. Perhaps they didn't like the name Priscilla. Ancestry famly trees put in the links as family. The strange thing is that Semei's father, Andrew, is not a name that appears in Sidney's family tree (which I've verified pretty extensively. howell\n\ni am looking for any connection to my gt gt granmother ann howell born 1805 in mere wilts i can not find any siblings or parents to ann howell she married in 1826 to john howell they had 3 children john died and she met james lapham born in kilmington 1800 his first wife was rachel howell she died in 1838 and ann and james lived together had three children james elizabeth jane and fanny, fanny died aged 18 and james died in 1854 and ann died in 1872 aged 66. any information would help. Glovers of Mere\n\nThere were members of the Glover family recorded in Mere from the seventeenth century until the time of the 1901 census. I would like to know a bit more about this whole family but am particularly trying to find more details about John GLOVER bp 1815 at Mere, a plumber and glazier, who married Hannah SANGER in 1835 at West Knoyle. Hannah was born between 1806 and 1811. Their children were born and/or baptised at West Knoyle and Mere:- William born 1836 ?West Knoyle,occupation ? married ?; Eliza born 1838 West Knoyle, married William REDDINGTON then Edwin PENNY; Martha born1839 West Knoyle, married Bastable MARTIN; Charles born1841 Mere, painter later plumber, married Jane Lucy Emily DAVIE; John born1844 Mere, hairdresser then railway detective/inspector married Adelaide SMITH; Louise/a born 1848 Mere, married Henry Thomas SWAN sea captain Tom 1850 Mere, painter married ?

Inside the clocktower next to the War Memorial is information and pictures of some of the people above. Visited Mere today so noted this down on way through hope its of help. Barnard in Mere\n\nMy grx2 grandfather was Richard Barnard, cabinetmaker, born abt 1821, living in Canterbury area in all censuses; he gave place of birth as Bristol. On his second marriage, to Mary Cowdale (actually Cowdell), he reported his father as Richard Barnard, goldbeater. (He had numerous children born in Canterbury and Blean 1850-1870.) In 1851 and 1851, there is a Richard Barnard, goldbeater, in the workhouse in Mere (reported married in 1841 - can't find any wife or kids; reported widowed in 1861.) A Richard Barnard born abt 1792 died 1869 in Mere. I can't hook these Barnards up with any others found in censuses anywhere. Anyone??
