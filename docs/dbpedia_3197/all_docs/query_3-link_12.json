        "text": "James Donald Moss, Jr. passed away on May 31, 2024 in Natchitoches, LA. He was born in Natchitoches to James Donald Moss, Sr. and Mary Vetrano Moss on January 9, 1952.\n\nDonald was educated in local schools, going on after graduation to LSUS, which was only a two year college at that time. He went on to attend Centenary College, where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree. While at Centenary, he was nominated to receive a Danforth Fellowship to attend Tulane University in New Orleans. Since his quest for knowledge still was not satisfied, he went on to earn his doctorate in mathematics at LSU in 1991. A scholar all of his life, he was knowledgeable about many subjects and always sought information to satisfy his natural curiosity. His knowledge made him an interesting conversationalist. Well known in the music community in and around Natchitoches, he was a member of the Rock Foundation band in the 1960’s and early 1970’s. He made many friends throughout his life and, to his delight, many of them took the time to visit him during his illness.\n\nDonald was preceded in death by his parents. He is survived by two daughters, Juliette Moss Higdon and her husband Mark of Mandeville, LA, and Genevieve Moss of Baton Rouge, LA. Also, two grandchildren, Zachary Higdon and Kelsey Higdon, and three sisters, Sherry Kenney (Mike) of Jonesboro, AR, Kathy Hudson (Rick) of Natchitoches, LA, and Emily Pabst (Charlie) of Hammond, LA.\n\nThe family sincerely thanks Dr. Furqan Akhtar, Community Care Center, and Hospice of Natchitoches. Special thanks to lifelong friend Sammy Nix, friends Russell Sisson, Donnie Hyams, and Chris Wells for their frequent visits and loyalty, and to Sue Van Hook and Russell Sisson for sending delicious meals and encouraging thoughts during his illness. So many people were kind and helpful, and Donald was touched and appreciative.\n\nServices to be announced at a later date"
