My father is still alive although he left us years through drink. He put in his claim for the Gratuity bond & his claim was granted which in my opinion he was not entitled to. However I wrote several letters about it to Headquarters & could get no satisfaction & naturally expected the same result in this case.”\n\nA statutory declaration was signed by Mrs Mabel Watling on 25th July, 1923 stating that she would return the medals to the Dept. of Defence at any time upon receipt of its demand in writing, should a closer relative emerge.\n\nThe Commonwealth War Graves Commission lists Private Frederick Donald James Kennedy – service number 803, as being 21 years old & served with 2nd Battalion Australian Infantry. He was the son of Frederick and Annie Kennedy. Born at Inverell, New South Wales.\n\n(87 pages of Pte Frederick Donald James Kennedy’s Service records are available for On Line viewing at National Archives of Australia website).\n\nThe Kurrajongs\n\nEarly on the morning of 12 January 1916, Inverell witnessed a great day in its young history. A huge crowd assembled in the streets to farewell Inverell’s first contingent of The Kurrajongs. This group of 114 men was one of ten snowball recruiting marches held in NSW to encourage enlistment. At the time, these men were the largest group to leave a country town together for War Service.\n\nWearing white hats, the men marched from near the corner of Rivers and Otho Streets, to the Town Hall for the official farewell by the Mayor. The huge procession then proceeded down to Byron Street and on to the railway station, passing shops closed for the occasion. The volunteers held banners high. Thousands of people, including women and children in white dresses with shady hats, stood in the streets as bands led the way.\n\nAt the railway station the train had been decorated with Kurrajong leaves and flags for the occasion. A special train had been arranged to take them to the Narrabri camp. Along the way the train stopped overnight at Warialda and Moree where further rallies were held and more recruits joined the Kurrajongs.\n\nFurther volunteers followed during the next two months including nineteen men on 1 February and fifty men who made up the second contingent of The Kurrajongs on 29 February 1916. Many of these men became part of the 33rd, 34th, 35th and 36th Battalions of the 3rd Division of the AIF. Their story has been told in the book A fine body of men: Inverell Remembers the Kurrajongs 1916.\n\nIt is likely that at this time the intensive recruiting campaign and departure of the First Contingent of The Kurrajongs would have influenced enlistment throughout the district.\n\nThe Kurrajongs\n\nInverell WW1 Cenotaph\n\n11th November 2014\n\nThis memorial was first located at the intersection of Otho and Evans Streets, Inverell near the Town Hall. The site was chosen because it was near where the First World War volunteers were farewelled and promises given that the community would not forget them.\n\nMade of one huge block of granite from Uralla NSW, it weighed four tons. Architect J. F. O’Connor designed this 6.17 metre classic pedestal and Roman Doric column on an octagonal base. At the top is a polished granite urn with a draped cloth over one handle. The four panels contain the names of 229 men who died during their War service.\n\nThe community following an appeal on Anzac Day in 1924 raised funds for the memorial. .\n\nIn 1958 when the Memorial Swimming Pool was constructed, this memorial was moved to its current location at the front entrance to the pool, opposite the Inverell RSM Club."
