A soldier has died after being hit by an armoured vehicle during a training exercise on Salisbury Plain.

Emergency services were called to an area just west of Tidworth at 10.45am on Tuesday.

The 26-year-old man "sustained significant head injuries and sadly died at the scene", Wiltshire Police said.

He was a member of 5th Battalion The Rifles, and his family is being supported by a specialist family liaison officer.

The force is investigating alongside the army and Health and Safety Executive.
