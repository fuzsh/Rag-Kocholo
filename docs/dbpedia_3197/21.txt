A man who suffocated a suspected burglar during a citizen's arrest did not use unreasonable restraint, a court has heard.

Nathan Smith, 38, denies the manslaughter of 43-year-old Craig Wiltshire, who died after he was pinned to the ground for 12 minutes.

An expert told jurors the force Mr Smith used was neither "unreasonable" or "excessive".

The trial is due to last two weeks, and continues at Bristol Crown Court.

Mr Smith tackled Mr Wiltshire to the ground in the early hours of 20 November 2019. He died in hospital two weeks later, having suffered severe brain damage.

Mr Wiltshire, suspected of carrying out a series of car and garage break-ins in a suburb of Bristol, had been spotted on CCTV cycling around the neighbourhood dressed in black.

Prof Jason Payne-James, a specialist in forensic and legal medicine, told jurors Mr Wiltshire would have been at greater risk of sudden death due to the fact he had taken the sedative diazepam and the heroin substitute methadone.

He said Mr Wiltshire's slight build and previous scarring to his heart was also a risk factor.

Prof Payne-James said he did not think that Mr Smith's method of restraint - as a member of the public with no training - was inappropriate, and that the position alone was not the primary cause of death.

He added that having viewed the CCTV and bodycam footage he could not be certain of when Mr Wiltshire's heart stopped or when he stopped breathing.
