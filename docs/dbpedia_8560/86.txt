All About Immigrant Movement International

Bruguera will investigate growing concerns about political representation and conditions faced by immigrants by engaging with social service organisations, public leaders, and artists focusing on immigration reform.

Immigrants’ status and identity are increasingly determined not by their shared language, class, culture, or race, but rather by the fact that they are outside their home country.

Aiming to better understand what it means to be a global citizen, Immigrant Movement International will do this by holding public seminars, events, and activities, as well as partnering with immigrant and social service organisations.

Art in society will be another focus for Bruguera, as he will look at how the general public differs from art connoisseurs when it comes to their level of involvement, as well as how avant-garde vocabulary differs from the urgent political jargon employed today.”
