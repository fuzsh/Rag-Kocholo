She first gained notoriety for her 1997 solo performance The Burden of Guilt (El peso de la culpa) , a response to the mass suicide of a group of Indigenous Cubans who had consumed soil to demonstrate resistance to Spanish occupation. Subsequent works have frequently put her in conflict with the Cuban government: most notoriously, in Tatlin's Whisper #6 , performed in her native Havana in 2009, she set up a stage for audience members to speak uncensored for one minute. Featuring a die-cut cover, Tania Bruguera: Let Truth Be, Though the World Perish includes her most significant performances and installations, as well as a new work designed for Milan's Padiglione d'Arte Contemporanea.",
