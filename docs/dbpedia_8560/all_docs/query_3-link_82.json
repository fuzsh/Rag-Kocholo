        "text": "Tania Marmolejo Andersson was born in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (1975). Influenced by her Scandinavian and Caribbean heritage, she studies Graphic Design and Illustration in Norway and returns to the Dominican Republic to study Fine Arts at the Altos de Chavón School of Design.\n\nIn 1998 she received the Bluhdorn Scholarship and continued her studies at Parsons The New School for Design in New York, graduating from Fine Arts and Illustration in 2000.\n\nShe begins her artistic career as an illustrator for the fashion and lifestyle sections of Obsidiana magazine (New York). During these years, she also designs characters and backgrounds for MTV, PBS, Hyperion/Disney, and Scholastic Books as part of the Data Motion Arts studio’s animation team, receiving various ASIFA and CINE awards.\n\nIn 2005 she joined the group of artists at MadArts Studios in Brooklyn, NY, and District and Co. Gallery in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, where she participated in several group exhibitions, focusing entirely on developing her artistic career along with design. Since then, her work has been exhibited in numerous collective national and international exhibitions, several Iberoamerican Art Salons in Washington DC, representing the Dominican Republic, as well as in international art fairs such as Context Art Miami during Art Basel and Pinta NY, represented by Lyle O. Reitzel Gallery; and SCOPE 2016, Miami Beach, represented by Azart Gallery.\n\nShe has also designed textiles for the L’Amour by Nanette Lepore line for JC Penney and Nicole Miller Intimates, among others, and an artistic tile collection for Aguayo Tiles in The Dominican Republic.\n\nMarmolejo was selected to represent the Dominican Republic with her textile designs at the Fourth and Sixth Ibero-American Design Biennial (BID) in Madrid, Spain, in 2014 and 2018. The Bienal Iberoamericana de Diseño (BID), organized by DIMAD every two years at Central de Diseño in Matadero Madrid, is “the foremost gathering point for professionals and institutions of design in Latin America, Spain, and Portugal.”\n\nHer artwork has been displayed as part of important national cultural campaigns in the Dominican Republic, like the household name Cerveza Presidente campaign “Celébralo con Orgullo” (Celebrate with pride) in 2020.\n\nImportant Dominican magazines and institutions have recognized her as a remarkable contemporary artist. She is part of the book “Dominicanas fuera de serie. 150 mujeres que transformaron la República Dominicana” (Dominicans out of the charts. 150 women who transformed the Dominican Republic), by Geraldine de Santis, 2021.\n\nShe is the author of the books:\n\nI doodle; therefore, I am\n\nTo doodle or not to doodle\n\nMarmolejo is also the illustrator of a children book series ‘Tales of the biosphere reserve’ on the fauna and flora of Hispaniola and the national parks in the Dominican Republic: “Pedrito y el cacaotal”, “Tambor y misterio”, “Cuando el viento habla”, “¡Es la tierra más hermosa que ojos jamás hayan visto!”, y “Chicui corazón de joya”.\n\nShe resides in New York, where she is devoted full-time to her artistic practice.\n\nSelected Exhibitions\n\nSelected Collective Exhibitions\n\n2023 Immaculate Heart of Margaritaville.
