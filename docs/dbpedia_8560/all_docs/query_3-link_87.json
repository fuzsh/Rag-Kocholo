        "text": "In “Cultural Exchange Rate,” Lebanese artist Tania El Khoury recreates a family diary of the borderlands. Her unforgettable installation reveals that the cruelest of borders are invisible to the naked eye, even as they persist across everyday life. “Cultural Exchange Rate” draws on recorded interviews with El Khoury’s late grandmother, oral histories collected from her village in Lebanon, and the discovery of lost relatives in Mexico City. In this interactive multimedia experience, audiences are invited to engage with an astonishing collection of sensory artifacts that collectively trace more than a century of border crossings.\n\nEl Khoury’s work has been translated to multiple languages and been shown globally in settings ranging from national museums to fishing boats. El Khoury is the Distinguished Artist in Residence and Director of the OSUN Center for Human Rights & the Arts at Bard College.\n\nDear friends,\n\nLebanese artist Tania El Khoury calls her work “interactive live art”: a\n\nmode of performance in which the audience is an essential collaborator.\n\nCultural Exchange Rate drafts its audience into this role by activating all\n\nfive of our senses as we seek the story of one family’s life on the LebanonSyria border. Through direct, if sometimes unexpected, invitations to bear\n\nwitness, the piece personalizes global tragedies of war and forced migration,\n\nsurfacing physical and emotional sensations of memory, displacement, and\n\ndesire. These sensations complicate whatever we might think we know\n\nabout El Khoury’s homeland. El Khoury writes in preface to this installation\n\nthat “the cruelest of borders are invisible to the eye.” As Cultural Exchange\n\nRate suggests, these are the borders we erect between the past and the\n\npresent, within families and communities, and even within our own psyches.\n\nAs we prepared to bring Cultural Exchange Rate to Holy Cross, I had the\n\nopportunity to experience the work’s most recent production at Invisible\n\nDog in Brooklyn, New York. Moving through the installation with the Holy\n\nCross community in mind brought into different focus the piece’s\n\nprovocative questions about what we owe each other—and at what “rate of\n\nexchange.” I am delighted that hosting Cultural Exchange Rate at The Prior\n\nwith the involvement of so many academic departments and programs\n\nextends a discussion taking place about El Khoury’s work on campuses\n\nfrom Bard to Occidental and among audiences around the world.\n\nCultural Exchange Rate draws from numerous traditions of performance art\n\nthat make participatory claims on their audiences. Yet the piece also\n\nunderscores the fact that all performance is participatory—that there is no\n\nsuch thing, in other words, as a passive spectator. Today you step into a\n\nBoroughs Theatre wholly converted for the purposes of this presentation.\n\nEven as it’s obvious that the construction of The Prior has transformed the\n\nphysical landscape of the Holy Cross campus, we have just begun to\n\nexperience the endless transformations that will take place inside the center\n\nin the years to come. These include the transformations in ourselves.\n\nKyle Frisina\n\nInterim Director\n\nPrior Performing Arts Center"
