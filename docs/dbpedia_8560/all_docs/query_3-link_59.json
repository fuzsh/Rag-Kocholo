        "text": "Show runs from: July 5-August 24\n\nOpening Reception: Friday July 5, 5-7 PM\n\nAn exhibit that explores contemporary art's interconnectedness with historical artifacts. In an era where divisiveness is ever present, this theme encourages visitors to find similarities and connections between seemingly unrelated things. The pairings encourage visitors to think about each theme within the exhibit but also pose the question of how this theme is present in their lives. “juxtaposition” features the work of three distinguished artists.\n\nI form figures and tiles from richly colored earthenware with layered surfaces. The posture and expression in these pieces are meant to reflect the humor and pathos inherent to living.\n\nMy small sculptures are influenced by dolls and movement-based toys from earlier generations. As time passes, the joyful feel of old playthings often turns mysterious or menacing. I hope to animate my figures with these complex qualities.\n\nNarrative craft forms, including Italian majolica and medieval stained glass, inspire the two-dimensional work I create. Fairy tales, puppet theater and the endless wonder of the natural world foster my ideas.\n\nMy drawings and paintings depict animals and humans in moments either before or after an action. An accident has occurred but no one has responded yet. A figure approaches but silence hasn’t been broken. My hope is that the viewer brings curiosity to the work and posits a narrative of their own that can be true in the moment of looking.\n\nRabbits and hares feature prominently in my work. For me, they bring to mind responses to unknowns, and the desire to be kept safe and to be comforted. In the wild they are marked by an impulse to freeze or flee, but folktales and stories across the world cast them as clever, brave and even capable of communicating with the dead. I hold these ideas in mind when I create my work.\n\nI think of my works as illustrations of curiosity. While knowledge constantly forms my decisions, curiosity forms my art.\n\nMy crow series began as a twofold fascination between our human desire to measure other creatures' intelligence based on our own and the visual intensity of the crow: rich black characters that on a gray day remind me of jagged black holes bouncing around the landscape. It can be difficult to discern detail on a crow with its universally black features, and I began to explore their textures and personalities, adding color and personification as I explored.\n\nMy visual comparisons, also born of curiosity, are all invitations for the viewer. I do not want to tell my viewer what to see; I invite you to explore each comparison on your own terms. As I developed my visual comparisons, I was drawn to the Venn diagram as a compositional tool that would invite the viewer to consider both similarities and differences, exploring the richness of each space.\n\nI love the honesty of works on paper. The paper's absorbency is a challenge, and layering must be decisive, intentional, and graceful. Each illustration is like a meditation in that way."
