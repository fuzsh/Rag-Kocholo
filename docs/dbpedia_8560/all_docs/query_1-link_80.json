        "text": "Tanya Aguiñiga’s work lives at the intersection of art, craft, and design—she was even dubbed the “patron saint of the Los Angeles modern craft movement” by the Los Angeles Times. Initially drawn to craft as a medium because of function, having grown up in Tijuana, Mexico, where all was put to use, Aguiñiga eventually pursued advanced degrees in Furniture Design. While studying woodworking as an undergraduate, Aguiñiga was introduced to jewelry, metalsmithing, ceramics, and textile disciplines, culminating in further investigations of craft disciplines and their larger connections to culture, tradition, material, function and community. As a Mexican-American, woman, mother and craftsperson, she has not taken success or opportunity lightly. Adversity catalyzed and shaped her art career and now serves as an example for younger generations that she mentors and helps to educate.\n\nAguiñiga received the Heinz Award in 2021."
