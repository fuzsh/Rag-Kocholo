        "text": "(Mexico City, Mexico, 1974)\n\nOne of the central interests of her work is the expanded idea of translation, extended to the experimental field through the use of visual, sound, textual and symbolic languages. Many of her projects consider the universe of sound and the politics of listening as a tool capable of expanding and transforming perceptions, both human and non-human.\n\nA fundamental part of her work is related to feminist policies and practices, understanding them as a communal, affective and ritual experience. Her production usually involves interdisciplinary work groups in various fields, consolidating intersections between art, literature, music, architecture, science, and labor, with an emphasis on ancestral knowledge and techniques, technologies, and their history in the production of knowledge.\n\nShe is member of the National System of Art Creators of Mexico; received the Guggenheim Fellowship for the Arts and the Smithsonian Institution Artist Research Fellowship and she is an artist-in-residence at the Arts at CERN program, in Geneva, Switzerland. In 2015 she represented Mexico at the 56th Venice Biennale. Her work has been exhibited internationally in museums, institutions and independent spaces, and is part of important public and private collections.\n\nCurrently lives and works in Mexico City, Mexico"
