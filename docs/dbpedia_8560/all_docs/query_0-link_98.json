        "text": "Her research and experience at CERN are the basis of Quantum Prelude, which premieres at her current solo show ​​Like a Trace, Its Sound at the Museo Universitario Arte Contemporáneo (MUAC) in Mexico City. The two-channel video installation combines images from CERN’s archives and footage from 64 musicians playing at MUAC’s Espacio Escultórico – a circular megalithic monument circumscribed by the same number of triangular prisms. A poetic narration around the notions of our universe and a music composition by Rogelio Sosa accompany the visual imagery.\n\nThe sound action for voices and instruments explores the connections between the narrative of quantum physics and ancestral Indigenous cosmogonies. Described by the artist as a ‘choreographic narration’, the musicians replicate the arithmetic and harmonic qualities that constitute the sonority of music and the laws of physics.\n\nCandiani’s research also led to the sculpture Supersymmetry, installed on the rectangular water mirror surface at the MUAC’s entrance. In physics, Supersymmetry is a proposed extension of the Standard Model of Particle Physics that predicts a partner particle for each elementary particle. This theory aims to fill some of the Standard Model’s gaps: the existence of dark matter, the mysterious substance that makes up 85% of the universe’s matter, and explain the Higgs boson’s mass.\n\nCandiani takes as a starting point a photographic image from a cloud chamber experiment. This early particle detector revealed subatomic particles by making their trails visible to the naked eye. In the water mirror, the aluminium structures evoke the tracks and movements of subatomic particles reflected on the water surface, alluding to the as-yet-undiscovered ‘superpartners’ of fermions and bosons.\n\nLike the Trace, its Sound is the first major exhibition of the artist’s work from 2012 to date, presenting sculptures, paintings, drawings, visual installations and archival work that operate at the complex intersection of phonic, graphic, linguistic, symbolic and technological language systems. The exhibition is on view at MUAC until 27 November 2022.\n\nTania Candiani residency at CERN was made possible thanks to the support to Arts at CERN of the Didier and Martine Primat Foundation and its special fund Odonata as part of a multi-year partnership and grant scheme that aims to foster creative interactions between arts, sciences and nature.\n\nArticle by Ana Prendes, Communications and Content Producer at Arts at CERN"
