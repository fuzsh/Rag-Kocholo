        "text": "Next Article\n\nThis artist paints vibrant portraits from her two studios in Germany and Portugal, hoping to capture the aura and true essence of a human soul, finds Ramsha Vistro\n\nI’ve changed my name so often, 2022, oil on pressed wood panel, 60x60cm\n\nI came here with no expectations, only to profess, 2021, oil on panel, 50x70cm\n\nWhen you lay your eyes upon Tania\n\nRavilis’ art, you are met with an amalgamation of vivid colours, merged through expressive strokes, creating intense portraits. The human soul is what she aims to capture, with its enigmatic – yet often predictable – nature, presenting a compelling canvas to encapsulate the aura of her sitters; an intangible embodiment of their existence.\n\nIn the beginning, these brush strokes were shy, guided by the sense of countless books by several Old Masters and their recreated works. But with each passing year, Tania’s movements became more assertive, with her palette embracing bolder colours. “I now take in the sheer joy of covering wooden panels and canvases with broad brush strokes, painting shadows with Deep U ltramarine or vivid Mars Orange. The journey has been magical.\n\n“I tend to paint paired or group portraits and even when dealing with solitary gures, I emphasise the existence of a silent speaker beyond the canvas. My portraits invariably allude to ‘the other,’ as I rmly believe that a subject’s coherent image can only materialise through another’s gaze. Without this prism of perception, a portrait risks becoming an empty vessel, a mere assembly of external features. My goal is to transcend the super cial, to create art that doesn’t merely replicate a person’s physical appearance but mirrors their essence, their spirit. After all, true artistry lies not just in what the eyes see, but in what the soul feels.”\n\nTania has previously drawn inspiration from Lucian Freud, Maria Fortuny, Helene Schjer eck and Sam Szafran. “Frantisek Kupka’s The Yellow Scale (ca. 1907) holds a special place in my heart, as do the portraits by Carlos Federico Sáez. A pivotal moment in my artistic journey was coming across a photoshoot in the September 1985 issue of Architectural Digest, featuring Rudolf Nureyev in his Paris apartments. Those images signi cantly in uenced my artistic trajectory.”\n\nYet, she strives to contemporise these inspirations, infusing the palette with a sense of modern aesthetic: “a shimmering yet elusive lter of modernity,” as she calls it, aiming to re ect our era’s unique visual language while delving into the timeless depths of human emotion.\n\nTania’s family was never really into art. The creative world’s allure dawned upon her at 17, with a sudden, insatiable desire to absorb beauty and art. She would spend entire days wandering through museums – often clueless about what was before her – but utterly enchanted; engrossed in intricate details. “I’ve always had this gut feeling, this itch, that I had ▸ something to express, something to say to the world. But I guess I wasn’t quite sure how to channel it. I was in my late 20s when I found my calling. I still chuckle at the memory of those early days, just me and my canvas, venturing into the unknown, discovering a language I didn’t know I could speak.”\n\nTania’s artistic journey began aged 27 when she moved to Germany to learn the language It was a turning point in her life, one that provided her with the time and space to discover the untapped depths of her creativity. “During this transformative period, I met my now husband, who nudged me towards painting. He gifted me my rst set of brushes and oil paints, and his unwavering support bolstered my con dence as I dipped my toes into this new world.\n\n“I would moonlight as an artist, working on my pieces after-hours while holding down a day job. I began to discover and hone my unique visual language; a refreshing means to express myself. I often ask myself why it took me so long to start painting and I can’t help but wonder how di erent things might be if I’d picked up a brush at, say, 10.”\n\nAs her work began to get noticed by the likes of New York’s Arcadia Contemporary, Tania knew she was on the right path “This was a moment of reckoning that signalled the need for a signi cant leap: transitioning from a casual hobbyist to a professional artist. Since 2021, I have been living my dream, dedicating all my time to my art. It has been a rewarding journey, turning my life into a personal paradise. Who knew an artist’s studio could be a utopia?” she laughs.\n\n“I’m fortunate enough to have two distinct creative spaces – in two di erent countries –with their own unique atmospheres. Each studio re ects a di erent facet of my life and work. The variation in environments and settings does wonders for my creativity and I cherish the uniqueness each space o ers.”\n\nTania’s cosy studio in Aachen, Germany is part of her home, exuding an inviting, old-world charm, lled with vintage furniture, old frames and countless paintings embellishing the walls. She often has a record spinning in the background – from her rather extensive vinyl collection ranging from classical music to David Bowie – adding to the eclectic ambience. A roof window o ers a view of the surrounding forest and beautiful sunsets that colour the horizon, and – as golden hour hits – her studio is basked in a warm-hued light. “My day here is primarily a day immersed in art, music and co ee.”\n\nIn contrast, her studio in Setúbal, Portugal is much more spacious, with high ceilings, giving her the room to work on larger canvases that she xes directly onto her walls. This studio has ‘secret’ access to the roof where Tania takes in the fresh air or indulges in a book. Her mornings here start with a cup of Portuguese ‘Cafe Pingado’ from a nearby cafe, before returning to her studio, turning on some music and preparing her paints to work throughout the day, breaking only for lunch or a game of tennis. Some days, Tania will begin her days with some sur ng, brimming with energy in the afternoon which she putsto good use by heading to her studio. “I always make a point to clean my brushes before leaving and wrap them in paper so that they greet me looking brand new, the following morning.”\n\nTania often works on plain plywood – a material with no inherent artistic expectations – which allows her to juxtapose intricately detailed backgrounds with the semitransparent quality of human skin, revealing inner vulnerabilities and individuality.\n\n“For me, the material is a tool of symbolic expression and a method of metaphorising the visual. The poetic, aesthetic and characteristic details of an individual’s countenance might be meticulously composed, but their true self is determined by their moral compass, experiences and life journey. I believe this perspective is what distinguishes my work.” taniarivilis.com ▫"
