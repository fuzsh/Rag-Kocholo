        "text": "Intro. To Acrylic Painting: Paint What you Love Bundle Series\n\nHave you always wanted to learn how to paint with acrylics? Join us for this brand new series, designed for the beginner, as well as those wanting to brush up on their skills.\n\nThis is our very first “bundle series” which is offered at a price that is 20% lower than what you would pay if you took three separate 2.5 hour classes. AND it includes your very own starter set of acrylic paints!\n\nIn this 3-part series, you will be guided -step by step – in learning the foundational skills of painting with acrylics. From prepping your canvas to finishing & properly preserving your painting, guest artist Tania Dirks will share the skills you will need to learn this versatile medium. A great opportunity to find your style and voice through both stroke and color application. Lessons will include, toning and color blocking, creating visual rhythm and movement in composition, layering and highlighting and then, the all important: “how to know when to stop”! In addition to these foundational techniques & principles, Tania will also support your learning by sharing acrylic art theory each week. Not to mention that her teaching style is a lot of fun!\n\nAll art tools & materials you’ll need for the series are included, and we will offer you a choice of 16”x20” canvas or 12×16”. All you need to bring is an inspirational subject to paint (a personal photograph or an image you find out in the world!).\n\nA starter set of acrylic paints by Liquitex will also be included with your registration, so that you may continue practicing, between and beyond the series sessions.\n\nTania looks forward to sharing her love of this medium and art-making with you!!\n\nNo experience is needed.\n\nAdditional tools & materials- for your practice at home, if you’d like that option, will be suggested during the class. A class list/ link through Dick Blick will be provided for these supplies.\n\nWe look forward to hosting you!"
