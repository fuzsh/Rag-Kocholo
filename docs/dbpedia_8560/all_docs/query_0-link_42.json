        "text": "A long-planned exchange of works between the Bronx Museum of the Arts and the Cuban national collection, recently scrambled by the complexities of international relations, has hit another snag.\n\nTania Bruguera, a prominent Cuban-born performance artist and activist who has clashed in recent years with the Cuban authorities, is demanding that her work not be included in the second half of the two-country show, “Wild Noise/Ruido Salvaje,” and the museum has agreed to her request.\n\nThe Bronx Museum’s director, Holly Block, announced this week that the exhibition’s second half, which was to have been a selection of works lent to the Bronx from the National Museum of Fine Arts in Cuba, would not take place as expected, after Cuban officials declined to allow works to travel to the United States. In the summer of 2015, the Bronx museum had lent more than 80 works from its permanent collection to the National Museum to initiate the exchange. But Cuban museum officials have demurred on continuing to cooperate, possibly because of questions about whether state-owned art works from Cuba could be in danger of being seized while in the United States to satisfy legal claims by Americans whose property was confiscated in Cuba after Fidel Castro took power in 1959.\n\nThe Bronx Museum decided to replace this half of the show with another exhibition, scheduled to open Feb. 17, made up of some 60 pieces drawn from public and private collections outside Cuba, representing many of the artists whose works would have come from the national collection.\n\nBut Ms. Bruguera, one of the marquee artists in the new lineup, said in an interview Thursday that she did not want her work to be included in the show because she felt that Ms. Block’s exchange initiative relied too closely on the Cuban government, which she opposes. (She has been detained and questioned several times in Cuba during art performances and other activities, most recently this month.) She added that she was prevented by Cuban authorities, in 2015, from entering the national museum in Havana to attend the exhibition for the first half of the exchange and that Ms. Block did not intercede to help her.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
