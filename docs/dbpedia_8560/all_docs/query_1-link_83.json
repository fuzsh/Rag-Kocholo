        "text": "This episode of Art21 Exclusive features artist Tania Bruguera collecting signatures as part of her socially engaged performance project The Francis Effect (2014). For fifteen weeks Bruguera stood outside of the Guggenheim Museum in New York asking passersby to sign a petition to Pope Francis that requests Vatican City citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\n\n“A lot of people know it’s impossible,” says Bruguera. Yet she believes “the impossible is only impossible until somebody makes it possible.” In her engagement of our political imaginations, Bruguera demonstrates the power of art to change perceptions and mobilize political action.\n\nMore information and credits"
