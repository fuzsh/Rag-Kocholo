        "text": "Sungyeon Park graduated from Chelsea College of Art & Design, University of the Arts, London, UK with a MA in Fine Art in 2007 and a MFA at Ewha Womans University, Seoul, South Korea in 2001. Park’s subjects come from small voices within ordinary lives and are concerned with social issues related to visual language and individual experience. Park has received several grants including an Emerging Artist Fellowship in 2006. She had a solo show in 2009 titled still lives; small voices by Arts Council Korea and GyeongGi Cultural Foundation. Park participated in the Art Omi International Artist Residency in New York.\n\nTania Candiani was born in Mexico City in 1974. Her work is a reflection about contemporary aesthetic patterns. She is interested in producing objects or images which represent the perception of contemporary urban spaces and their rituals. Beyond a specific remark on the body, her approach explores the emotional state of a person or social group and its context and simultaneously proposes research on materials and techniques. At the moment, Candiani is developing a project of urban interventions where textiles, architectural design and the experiences of the people whom she works with become the detonators of the artwork. ‘I believe the circumstance, the process, and the documentation are the most important tools for dialogue.’ Between her most recent projects are Otros paseos, Otras historias, Mexico City, Mexico; Kaunas Grafiti, Textile 09, Lithuania; Refranes, Centro Cultural España, México.\n\nAihua Hsia’s work challenges the notions of boundaries and containment within the human psyche. She explores the collective unconscious by revealing the presence of a shared human essence. Through the employment of the ancient Buddhist sculpture technique, “Datsukanshitu,” Hsia incorporates her Chinese roots, the natural world, and the traditional past into her work. Hsia’s work has been nationally and internationally exhibited at Gifu Municipal Culture Center, Japan; Museum of Contemporary Art Taipei, Taiwan; and 2 x 13 Gallery, New York. Aihua Hsia was born in Taipei Taiwan in 1973, and received a BFA in Sculpture at National Taiwan University of Arts and an MFA in Sculpture at Okinawa Prefecture University of Arts."
