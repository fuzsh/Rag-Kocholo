        "text": "Page 124 →9 Reckoning with Contact within a Performative “Migratory Aesthetics”\n\nLaurel V. McLaughlin\n\n‘Migratory Aesthetics,’ then, is a non-concept, a ground for experimentation that opens up possible relations with ‘the migratory,’ rather than pinpointing such relations.1\n\nMieke Bal\n\nPage 125 →As audiences entered ear-whispered, Tania El Khoury’s survey at Bryn Mawr College, in the Special Collections Rare Book Room-turned gallery to view the multichannel video installation Camp Pause (2014), they traversed a darkened corridor, illuminated only by excess light from the other side of the wall, which led them to the artwork’s installation (Figure 1). There, they could access a room—built of four white walls, displaying four different yet simultaneous video projections of scenes from southern Lebanon’s Rashidieh camp for refugees.2 They encountered the option to sit on one of eight stools—organized in pairs of red, yellow, blue, and green, and facing each of the four projections. But to sit meant picking up the headphones that lay atop each of the stools, and then choosing whether or not to immerse themselves in the projections’ corresponding sound- and imagescapes.\n\nAudiences—a term that El Khoury uses to indicate members who are “part of the story, a political being, a collective, but also a complex individual”—likewise met with invitations, offerings, and choices, configured within Stories of Refuge (2013), another immersive video installation by the interdisciplinary research and performative collective Dictaphone Group, comprised of anonymous residents of Munich’s “Yellow Camp” and exhibited at Twelve Gates Arts in Philadelphia—one of the satellite installations within the multisited survey.3 Metal-frame bunk-beds positioned toward three projections furnished a precarious type of rest for audiences, who could sit or lie down on the bunks with or without headphones, writing (or not) their reflections, epistles, or errant thoughts in blank journals left on the beds. In As Far As My Fingertips Take Me (2016), a singular audience member sits next to a wall, dons headphones, and decides whether to thread their arm through a hole in the wall into an unseen space. Sited in the outdoor space of Bryn Mawr College’s Taft Garden, the performance facilitated the potential meeting of the audience member’s arm with the hands of musician and street artist, Basel Zaraa. Through ink drawn on the audience member’s arm and rap lyrics flowing through headphones, Zaraa shares his experiences in Palestinian and Syrian refugee camps. In each of these installations, El Khoury and her collective Dictaphone Group, including collaborators Petra Serhal and Abir Saksouk, construct scenarios with refugees that begin to implicate audiences according to their “real-time” or live decisions to participate or not in the work of art—to see, to listen, to come along with subjects as they film and/or narrate their experiences. In doing so or not, the audience’s actions become politically meaningful as alliance(s) or distantiation(s).\n\nThese are some of the mediated, live, and sensory peregrinations in works by El Khoury and Dictaphone Group. Each of the performances and installations configure perceptible passages—immersive, performative, and political, voluntary, or seemingly involuntary. As it is commonly termed, participation, even in the form of nonparticipation, connotes a host of aesthetic and political meanings (alignment, complicity, opposition, absorption, and so on), and, on the surface, seems to epitomize how audiences approach the unwieldy combination of art and migration. In fact, El Khoury and collaborators in the collective Dictaphone Group, among others, resist the term “participation” for the ways in which it potentially manipulates both audiences and communities, establishing unequal modes of engagement for subjects and audiences. It can, as El Khoury explains in an interview with curator Anna Gallagher-Ross, provide a false illusion of choice as many of those same choices have already been made by those in positions of power.4 Rather, El Khoury and Dictaphone Group realize Page 126 →another form of engagement, that of “interactive” environments in which seemingly neutral audience members negotiate space and agency, and ultimately cocreate works alongside highly politicized subjects.5 I argue that such works activate and problematize what cultural theorist Mieke Bal terms “contact,” a tenet within her larger theoretical research paradigm of “migratory aesthetics.” In Bal’s account of “the aesthetic dimension[s]‌ of the migratory experience and its impact and visualization in contemporary artistic practices,” she queries how migration fundamentally affects culture and vice versa.6 As stated in the epigraph, Bal offers “non-concept,” as “ground for experimentation that opens up possible relations with ‘the migratory.’”7 Bal’s model examines the media of film, video, and video installation to articulate a shared ontology with the conditions of migration: movement, memory, heterochrony, and contact.8\n\nSuch a model is successful in its observation of formal properties perceived by the full spectrum of senses that mirror lived experiential conditions, and for the ways in which the system discloses specific observations dependent upon an individual’s migration, while also remaining porous. It thus enables the identification of mutual patterns without being reductive.9 In this essay, I aim to examine the experiential conditions and formal properties of film in the video installations Camp Pause and Stories of Refuge, and expand, however briefly, its application beyond the media of film, video, and video installation to include aspects of “live art” in the one-on-one performance As Far as My Fingertips Take Me. Such a performance work, which enfolds audiences into its creation, could instantiate, in my perspective, what performance curator Catherine Wood qualifies as “live art,” namely, “carrying the intensity of being in the moment, a mutual presentness, even an element of physical risk,” and likewise extend Bal’s conception of contact beyond the black box and screen to more entangled relations of solidarity and power.10 According to El Khoury, live art refuses the presumed passivity of theater and performance audiences and instead stages relational encounters in a variety of contexts and with differing media, or, as she says, “offers a more flexible space between maker and performer, artist and spectator.”11 In an interview for Full Service Radio, El Khoury describes this encounter as nondependent upon the performer’s body. Instead, the intimacy of the relationship between performer and audience constitutes a “shared vulnerability,” aligning with Wood’s assessment of risk.12 Rather than projecting her aims for the work upon her audiences, El Khoury orchestrates a scenario in which they relate to the work differently, as they so choose.13 This embodied, somewhat scripted, yet presumably open relationship between performer and audience concerning the experiences of displaced people necessarily includes Bal’s conceptions of movement, memory, heterochrony, and contact, albeit in expanded ways.14\n\nShared Ontologies between Lived Experiences of Migration and the Live Art of Tania El Khoury\n\nBal asserts that aesthetics are dependent upon the sensorial, the bodily—rather than a philosophical rationalization via the optical. In the context of contemporary migration, Page 127 →this strikes me as crucial. Abstractions, such as national borders, and bureaucratic legislation not only threaten to undermine both the people whom they claim to serve and their allies, but also to uphold hierarchical relationships based on citizenship that determine movement across borders. In contradistinction to this rationalization, Bal posits a theoretical research matrix through the alignment of medium-specific ontological characteristics between film with migration—movement, memory, heterochrony, and contact. It provides a common lexicon for formal analysis through experience rather than opticality, while not circumscribing the specificities of those experiences within universal conclusions. As such, it presents a radical commoning of research concerning art and migration, in that, on some level, the researcher can ideally share in the shared part of experience with the artist and subjects, even if this sharing has critical limits. Expanding the application of Bal’s medium-specific theory to performance and especially live art, I recognize these ontological conditions, albeit in modified forms, and their political stakes for a culture of the migratory, as Bal puts it.\n\nTania El Khoury’s work As Far As My Fingertips Take Me, which I will examine later, and those produced by her collective Dictaphone Group—Camp Pause and Stories of Refuge—share the ontological qualities with migration that Bal identifies for film. The latter two feature video as a central part of the installation, which aligns their ontologies with that of film. These works not only disclose the migratory journeys of their subjects, but formally and materially they contain movement, memory, heterochrony, and contact.Page 128 →\n\nThe four videos at the core of the Camp Pause installation project moving images onto fixed walls to establish image-based movement across a surface as a material basis for the work, and include editing that illuminates movement. At least one of the videos from Camp Pause, for instance, employs quick panning shots of the shoreline that cuts abruptly to a relatively stiller image of a makeshift telephone pole; this pole’s stillness belies the activity encased within its multiple wires rapidly transmitting energy, power, communication unseen (Figure 2). The soundtrack pulses with upbeat, jubilant music, not yet interrupted by the call to prayer from the minaret on-screen and its supplication for stillness. The camera crosscuts recur actively and constantly, frequently between images that juxtapose the motion of the sea with the stillness of a graveyard, an unfinished building, or a beach strewn with trash. Furthermore, interactive movement is required of audience members, as they enter the installation and have the option to shift from each chair in order to listen to the four subjects (Hussein al-Zaini, Khadijeh al-Masri, Hassan Ajjawi, and Zahraa Faour) narrate their experiences of migration to Rashidieh refugee camp in Lebanon, situated close to the Mediterranean Sea, and their paths through the camp from their homes to the sea.15 While a subtle gesture, movement from one stool to the next—handmade by members of the refugee community themselves—performs a gesture of solidarity with the videos’ subjects if one chooses to listen to, look at, and engage with the life-size images.\n\nMovement is one of four ontological qualities in Bal’s account of migratory aesthetics, both inherent to the medium of film as a medium of moving images and the experience of migration. Migration literally means to shift or to move (from the Latin migrare) and, as an experience, indicates movement from one place to another. Of course, manifold factors such as borders, climate, war, natural disasters, human rights violations, persecution, and terrorism, among others, determine, in part, how and why one moves. While the video- and audience-based movements align, they are by no means equal to those of the on-screen subjects. In the video featuring Khadijeh al-Masri, an elder within the community and the subject in one of the four videos, for example, the speedy cuts in the video editing mirror and reinforce the movement in her narrative concerning her migratory exile from Palestine to Lebanon. Movement, inherent to both the video and the condition of migration, theoretically “takes” audiences from one place to another. Audiences hear a voiceover as al-Masri recounts her journey, consisting of what Bal terms involuntary movements, such as the trek without access to water or shelter; while at the same time, shots of rooftop views of the camp, children playing on a makeshift playground, and finally the interior of her apartment with a map of Palestine on the wall behind her flicker across the screen. She relays the shifts and turns that precipitated her present stasis within the borders of the camp.\n\nThese instances of movement on the part of audiences within the installation space and within the video itself with editing and narration, ultimately converge in a third and important instance of movement. While each of the four videos is different from the others, each following one of four subjects and his or her account of living in or coming to Rashidieh, all are paced similarly. The videos represent their subjects moving within the camp, before joining them within interior spaces, and then following them to the sea—a prompt that El Khoury asked of her collaborators. As an audience, we experience these journeys across all four screens in the same order as they unfold almost simultaneously. This onscreen migration through the camp and to the sea, is one that audiences, collective cocreators, and subjects embark upon together, as we follow the subjects to the sea—even if one only chooses to watch but one video, or whether one chooses to watch all four. Across these disparate terrains, all coalesce in an effort to locate a path beyond the camp—a futural imagining. As El Khoury explains in a conversation in this reader, the relationship to the sea, much like the relationship with migratory movement, and the comparison of the audiences to the subjects, is fraught for Hussein al-Zaini, Khadijeh al-Masri, Hassan Ajjawi, and Zahraa Faour, but the vision of the water’s effortless, undulating movement nevertheless illumines a potential freedom (Figure 3).16\n\nPage 129 →These various instances of movement occur discontinuously. The copresentation of four screens with simultaneous narratives told through eight different headsets provide four different temporalities in which audiences can immerse themselves. Given the fact that they are looped, and one cannot encounter them all at once, audiences encounter and shift to each in medias res, which further emphasizes the experience of disjointed or ruptured time on the part of audiences. Temporality, as Bal describes, is associated with the historically constructed notion of linear time. Migration conjures experiences between and among many different times, rupturing the semblance of linear time in what Bal proposes Page 130 →as heterochrony, or the second condition in her research matrix. In contrast to the experience of multiple times that might be organized within the mobilities and technologies of modern life, Bal theorizes heterochrony within the experience of migration as a haunting from, longing for, and clashing of temporalities—a sense of time from which one can “suffer.” According to Bal, “When multi-temporality becomes a problem, an inhibition, and paralysing contradiction, you ‘have’ heterochrony.”17 Film too incorporates temporality within its ontology as it is a time-based medium, and renders various orientations to time visible and felt, as Bal relays. It contains the capacity to juxtapose and clash temporalities as in the case of heterochrony.\n\nNot only does the structural framing of Rashidieh across the four screens compose a heterochronic temporal environment for audience-members, as stories elide from adjacent screens; but within each story, residents articulate both their multitemporal and, at times, heterochronic perspectives. Hussein al-Zaini, for instance, sits smoking on a dilapidated porch underneath a flag with symbols of the fida’yeen, or Palestinian freedom fighters. His story commences with a description of the spatial confines of the camp. As 7,000 people grew to 40,000 over the past forty to fifty years, he describes how residents smuggle in building materials for housing construction—an illegal activity within the camps. Cutting to a shot of a rooftop porch, the camera shows al-Zaini centered in the frame, as he throws away his cigarette and stares forward (Figure 3). His nonconcurrent voiceover recalling childhood events of the death of his four-year-old sister and the loss of his arm at the hands of Israeli fighters who were convinced he was a member of the fida’yeen is juxtaposed with the image of his present state—seemingly calm within his camp home. Both the editing and the actual narrative manifest heterochrony. In combination with the audience’s disjointed engagement with the videos, Dictaphone Group provides an opportunity for mutual recognition from the interactivity with the installation to the subjects’ conditions; and yet, it is one that could easily go unregistered in its completeness by audiences.\n\nReminiscing upon the past in each of the videos recalls the condition that Bal characterizes as inextricable from heterochrony—that of memory. Bal’s theory pinpoints the experience of traumatic and fragmented memory that arises involuntarily in the nonlinear temporal experience of migration. But she also acknowledges that one can summon memory through agency, leaving us not completely beholden to involuntary memories.18 Within film too, memory takes “temporary shelter,” as Bal says, within time. The narrative experience conjures memories diegetically and audiences’ experiences trigger memories extra-diegetically. Al-Zaini’s retrospection upon a violent event that undoubtedly altered his life becomes imagistic by way of the fragmented, discontinuous shots that visualize his potent yet fleeting story. And yet, in keeping with Bal’s characterization of memory, it is not confined to the traumatic alone. Zahraa Faour, a young resident of the camp, embodies the presence of recollected joy sutured wholly to the present. She knows no other reality than life in this camp; she recalls no traumatic displacement. Instead, she recalls playing at preschool and subsequently details the camp’s garbage collection woes. These are her near-present and ecstatic memories of the everyday. Although tethered to her status as a refugee, such harsh experiences do not necessarily confine her; and perhaps more accurately they Page 131 →signal the oscillation between the traumatic memory and the everyday banality in a migratory reality. Traumatic memory exists too, as evinced in the stories of el-Masri and Al-Zaini, and even in the story of Hassan Ajjawi, who articulates the immense bureaucratic obstacles that impede him from constructing a needed home for his family due to camp- and state-sanctioned restrictions on urban space. These remembered experiences of migration—both before, during, and after its trajectory—Bal would argue, are fragmented by the trauma that they incite.\n\nFor audiences, memories of those on-screen are disclosed alongside adjacent personal memories of their own interactivity. When immersed in these four narratives, audience members might dwell upon their own traumatic memories, or revel in Faour’s youthful wonder, among many other possibilities. In the quiet of the installation, with individual earphones, and one’s own thoughts, these opportunities for mutual recognition and recollection have the chance to arise. El Khoury describes the psychological movement between self and other as shared vulnerability.19 However, one might need to acknowledge this in order to open oneself to one’s own and others’ recollected memories.\n\nAnd indeed, in so doing, audiences approach—to a certain extent—what Bal understands as contact, her fourth ontological quality shared between film and migration. The experience of meeting the “other” by way of a work of art is what Bal describes as an ontological experience of contact. Bal associates contact with the phenomenon of the “contact zone,” “a social space where cultures meet, clash, and negotiate.”20 These negotiations take place within the medium of video, and in particular video installation and its spatial dimensionality. Bal draws upon philosopher Henri Bergson’s phenomenological concept of “natural feeling”— a heterogeneous subjective experience, which consists of “extensity,” or a “foreshortened space [that] extends from the ‘other’ towards the subject.”21 It is this space that frames the encounter between viewers (Bal’s term) and functions within “migratory aesthetics” as a disproportionate power relationship. Indeed, in the field of cultural anthropology, the “contact zone” includes a “highly asymmetrical relation of power, such as those of colonialism, slavery, or their aftermaths…” as literary scholar Mary Louise Pratt notes (Pratt, 34). In Bal’s account of contact, the one who reaches out, and constitutes the “self” in the “self-other” dynamic, often wields the power—however relational it may intend to be.\n\nIn Camp Pause, audiences come to the work in that very position of power and privilege. In the context of Bryn Mawr College, a womxn’s college set in the affluent suburbs of Philadelphia, most audience members do not share the experiences of the subjects.22 Whether or not the work can definitively provide a horizontal relationship across space, time, memory, and contact remains a question. For El Khoury and her collaborators, this possibility remains doubtful as they are suspicious about empathy.23 Empathy has become a popular contemporary form of relationality in performance art—one that invites shared feelings as if they are not only possible but also a desired result.24 As demonstrated in Camp Pause, and further defined in Stories of Refuge and As Far As My Fingertips Take Me, El Khoury’s conception of interactivity productively intervenes within the problematic conception of empathy as reckoning with contact in varying degrees.Page 132 →\n\nInteractive Potential\n\nBoth Dictaphone Group and El Khoury directly challenge relationality beyond the sharing of emotions within empathy. Her conception of interactivity distinguishes itself not only from “participation,” but also from traditional aims of “performance” or “theater.” Participation suggests to El Khoury that choices are available, when in fact they are not. Much like contact, this implies a vertical power dynamic, providing the illusion of a choice to participate. In contrast, “interactivity” suggests an open and notably horizontal dynamic, acknowledging that certain choices are indeed unavailable, and imagining other potential outcomes. Logistically speaking, scenarios are established within which multiple options could take place as its point of conception.25 In a hypothetical performed or theatrical context of Camp Pause, for instance, perhaps the option to leave would not exist (at least not as readily), or the experience would depend upon listening to each subject, one after another, unfolding as a narrative in linear time. In that scenario, the conception of the work forecloses the possibility of leaving, of disavowing oneself from the subjects, or from hearing just one work. These options, to El Khoury are just as important as hearing every word from every speaker, as they relay audience-members’ political positionalities. As she says, “Political potential isn’t about whether the audience agrees with the content of my artwork. It’s about inviting people to embody other’s realities and stories. They can think about their own bodies in relation to state violence, for example.”26 For El Khoury, interactivity enables these positionalities to be recognized within the scenario of the work. Specifically, it “invites people to be involved, to participate in an embodied knowledge, to bear witness… to take sides, even.”27Page 133 →\n\nStories of Refuge provides a more extended opportunity for audiences to participate, one that is visible to others. The video installation by Dictaphone Group from 2013, originally featured a shipping container in its installation from the Spielart Festival in Munich within which bunk beds occupied the central space and three videos were projected on the walls of the container. The three videos featured asylum seekers “Ibrahim, Sipan, and Souad” in Munich and their meanderings through their housing and journeys to their favorite places in the city through self-shot footage.28 Within the ear-whispered survey, the work was coproduced with FringeArts Festival at Twelve Gates Arts Gallery, a white-cube space in Old City, Philadelphia. The bunk beds, accompanied by journals, individual headphones, and projected films occupied the entirety of the space.29 Is this an opportunity for “contact” in Bal’s terms? What is the distribution of power between subject and maker in the video and audiences beholding the video? Has El Khoury equalized choices available to audiences?\n\nUpon entering the gallery, audiences are already immersed within the interactive experience. Even if they never watch the videos, but only absorb the aesthetics of the beds, they perceive part of the austere and restrictive experience. The beds are makeshift, temporary, and hostel-like, or as El Khoury and one of the subjects—Sipan—describes them, “prison-like” beds (Figure 4).30 If one chooses to partake in watching the videos, they might, as many had to, wait in a queue, in order to use the three headphones—fewer than the number of beds available. Within the space, audiences have the chance to watch the different films while lying down on the beds and possibly journal during or afterwards. The physical position of lying on the beds close to the projected screens, which are situated on the walls in proximity to one’s head when resting, alters the viewing experience. For instance, as I watched the story of Sipan, a twenty-six-year-old refugee in Munich, I heard about a boat that sank with women and children below deck who were unable to escape due to a jammed door. “I slipped from the upper part. I was swimming like this, in [sic] one arm”—Sipan said. While sharing this story, he continuously wields the camera, however shakily, panning across a fluorescent-lit, sparse room, and stumbling over items of belonging, such as a flower-patterned comforter, a roll of toilet paper, and clothes limply hanging from a radiator. The flattened affect of the banal scene and my own casual position on the plain bed sharply contrasted with the searing journey of the narrative. I asked myself, how can we even occupy the same space, albeit meditated? My positionality on the bed, similar to those on-screen, brought me to this interactive conclusion, whereas a scenario of contact might not have. It presented the uncanny juxtaposition of movement, memory, heterochrony, the idea of occupying the same space, and the opportunity to respond via a journal that resisted a perhaps momentary empathy.\n\nThe presence of journals, left unceremoniously on the bed with writing utensils, provided this interactive opening. Without a specific prompt, or even directions in the blank-paged book, the chance to record a personal response, an epistle to the subject, or another kind of reaction remained available. One could take these up, as I watched numerous audience members do, during the films or after. This agency mirrored what El Khoury offered to her asylum seeker collaborators. El Khoury explains the cocreative scenario she provided:\n\nPage 134 →I gave each of the three participants a small discrete video camera that they smuggled into their camps, and asked them to film a day in their lives as asylum seekers in Munich. I also asked them to take us to their favorite spot in the city. I recorded an interview with each of them, which serves as the soundscape over the footage that they created.31\n\nCreating a scenario in which asylum seekers depict their otherwise censored living barracks, sharing their relationships to Munich, a place of supposed refuge, empowers El Khoury’s collaborators. Here, the nationally-liminal and politicized “other” leads the privileged citizen “self.” With pen and paper, audiences too have the opportunity to “lead,” to suspend the presumed distance among performer, theater, and audience to offer reflection within the presence of the very work and other audiences that will effectively become part of the work. What will, in fact, such leadership do? El Khoury conceives of such responses as individual acts of political solidarity, whether in the full knowledge of one’s complicity within the nation-state and its militarization of borders, or in the conviction of one’s alliance with the dispossessed.32 Perhaps too similar to empathy for some, El Khoury might say that such an act shifts the balance of power, however small. And in fact, it reverses the power dynamic of contact that Bal describes, as audiences might find themselves “othered” in relation to a “self” that might turn away.Page 135 →\n\nThis reversal is never more apparent than in the one-on-one performance, As Far As My Fingertips Take Me (2016).33 This performance, I argue, even extends the possibilities of a migratory aesthetics in a performative scenario. A collaboration between El Khoury and spoken word artist, percussionist, and street artist Basel Zaraa, the work stages an interactive situation in which Zaraa engages with a single audience member through a hole in a gallery wall. Zaraa is a Palestinian refugee who was born and raised in Yarmouk Camp in Damascus, Syria, and he shares his story with each audience member in the form of a rap song that details his journey from Damascus to Sweden with his three sisters and a drawing.\n\nIn the work at Bryn Mawr College staged in Taft Garden, an audience member checks in with a host, then puts on a white jacket and sits in a chair next to a white gallery wall arranged under a verdant tree that shades the gallery wall, performer, and audience members under its branches (Figure 5). In an action akin to the small gesture of movement from stool to stool in Camp Pause, an audience member cedes her arm through a hole in a wall to an unknown space on the other side where it is received by another, a then unknown artist. Upon her skin, Zaraa draws a representation of his familial migration in ink on the audience-participant’s arm as she listens, recalling both his memories and hers in the storytelling. El Khoury commissioned the piece by Zaraa for the Royal Court Theatre and the London International Festival of Theatre for their On the Move edition, amplifying his story through her artistic gesture because, as she says, “These are not my stories.”34 When asked to make a work about migration for the festival, El Khoury explained that Zaraa and she joked about some audience members who seem so desperate for an intense performative experience, it is as if they actually want to “feel” a refugee. Would radical touch give them access to the insipid experiences of border discrimination for those seeking refuge in SWANA?35 From this initially private joke, they conceived of the interactive scenario, relating Basel’s story: in 1956 his family’s village in Palestine was invaded by the Israeli army. When displaced in Syria, his family fled yet again at the outbreak of war. As El Khoury relayed, many people live their entire lives as refugees and come from families who were displaced for generations: “it is part of their identity.”36 Basel recalls multiple times of waiting and journeying throughout the rap song, articulating a heterochronic experience that the audience member too understands on a visceral level as her surroundings in the present Taft Garden grate against those that Basel describes.\n\nBut once again, the simplicity of contact and its hierarchical presumption of power is thwarted. Migratory experience, or the “other”—stereotyped, relayed, fingerprinted, and yet unknown—is the very premise of the encounter to be deconstructed. The viewer approaches the interaction without ever meeting Zaraa and is instructed about how one can interact based on the host’s guidance. They have the choice not to participate, to watch from afar, or to engage intimately. If they do choose to cede their arm across the wall, their arm is now literally in Zaraa’s hands. Upon one’s skin, an audience member might feel marks through brush-stroke sensations, or even activities such as fingerprinting, their recognition reinforced by the lyrics heard in a song or in Zaraa’s narrative. The concept of identity, travelling through fingerprints, keenly relates to the experience of border crossing in technologized Europe through 2003, and the Dublin Regulation, the Page 136 →European Union law which requires participating states to document and archive the fingerprints of refugees.37 A typical occurrence upon receiving criminal charges, the act is now instated as a performative and surveilled gesture for refugees crossing borders. The audience-member, unlike Zaraa, has the choice to pull her hand back, to not partake in the fingerprinting. If she chooses to continue, she does so on Zaraa’s terms. They do not know what he will do with their fingerprints, the index of their identities. She does not know what exactly Zaraa imprints on her arm. At the end of the song and narrative, the audience member can take back her arm, threading it through the wall to be reunited with her body, and is offered a chance to meet Zaraa by the host. She can accept or decline.\n\nFrom the beginning, choice is offered to audiences, and this parallels that offered to Zaraa by El Khoury in their creative collaboration. Rather than creating her own work for the commission, she provides a position of power to Zaraa, who then distributes that same power to us. This freedom is markedly different from the nonchoices he faced when crossing multiple borders—physical, cultural, and personal. Audiences do not force him to recount this difficult narrative, nor do they require him to creatively reflect upon the process of recollection through a rap song. Instead, they receive what is offered: touch and inscription of a “self.” Far from magical, healing, or even transformative—terms bandied about in art history and performance studies to describe the result of an encounter—the interaction by fingertips articulates the potential of greater political solidarity. However, much like ink upon skin, it could also potentially be fleeting.\n\nIrresolution: A Conclusion\n\nFrom a research matrix that depends upon a relationship of power to varying scales of interactivity and its potential, all of which lead to a choice that is still perhaps not actually a choice given social, political, and aesthetic parameters, where do we conclude? In fact, if we have a choice at all, it is only due to what performance curator Alessandra Cianetti understands as the “privilege” of live art as an ephemeral, flexible, and resilient form to investigate borders.38 In light of this, perhaps the possibility of a conclusion to El Khoury’s work and this analysis is not only downright frustrating but also impossible. If so, then it seems that El Khoury has managed to conjure what Cianetti calls a “praxis of becoming,” that escapes quantification and fixed ends.39 If one reads this account and feels satisfied in the unknown, or likewise experiences El Khoury’s works and revels in the work to be done, she might welcome both “irresolutions.” But as she says,\n\nI don’t like to talk about impact on an audience, to be honest. I feel like it’s a nonquantifiable notion, and it also risks glorifying both the artwork and the artist. But think about the political potential of interactivity […] it involves all senses and the body, so it’s not just about rationalizing the content of these pieces, but about experiencing it; listening as a radical act, sensing, embodying, et cetera. This allows for a deeper connection with the work that goes Page 137 →beyond just the rational, the intellectual, and it’s not just emotional either, nor entirely spiritual. Maybe it’s somewhere in between all of that […].40\n\nEven with markers such as the bed that performatively guide the experience of the work, or if one ignores these markers and feels an illusion of choice, the experiential and affective outcome is a litmus test that marks questioning, responsibility, and care. The presumed choices that the work conjures are ones that we cannot deny engaging within; as Bal states, an aesthetics of the migratory is one in which audiences cannot be “aloof and shielded.”41 As she proposes:\n\nIf aesthetics is primarily an encounter in which the subject, body included, is engaged, that aesthetic encounter is migratory if it takes place in the space of, on the basis of, and on the interface with, the mobility of people as a given, as central, and as at the heart of what matters in the contemporary, that is, “globalized” world.42\n\nWhat connects across the web of choices, illusions, interactions, and conditions in El Khoury’s work emerged in a conversation between the artist and Pepón Osorio, project consultant artistic director for Bryn Mawr College’s survey ear-whispered: the constant work that audience members are asked to perform in relation to the artwork. Whether known or unknown, this labor is carried out by them, the secondary actor, and that labor continues beyond the interaction.43 Will you listen to the senses, acknowledge the urgency, and inter-act?"
