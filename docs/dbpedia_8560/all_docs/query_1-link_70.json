        "text": "AAS: Tanya, would you talk about your background and art education? Did you grow up in Arkansas?\n\nTH: My early exposure to art was when I was a toddler in San Francisco in the early 60’s. My mother was in art school, and we did art together. Living the 60’s hippy life, my mom took us to Taos, New Mexico where we lived in an adobe two-room house with dirt floor and outhouse. I loved that time in life. However, an unfortunate incident interrupted life and made it so my mom could not take care of me anymore. So, just before I began school my grandparents took me to the small rural town of Amity, Arkansas. Sadly, there was no art education, galleries or museums for me for the next 12 years of my life, but I knew that art was the only thing I ever excelled at. So, I went to college and began my career as a commercial artist, mainly production art. In the mid 90’s I began to get back to fine art. I sculpted with clay and mixed media for several years, along with some painting. I did self-study at the Arkansas Arts Center (now the AMFA), the Art Students League of New York City and independent study at the University of Arkansas, Little Rock. I look forward to continuing to learn, hopefully with some travel art-learning experiences in the near future.\n\nAAS: You’ve said you are reinventing yourself and your art. What do you mean by that?\n\nTH: After abandoning the practice of art for a few years, I came back to art as an immensely changed person. I had become an activist for criminal justice reform and other causes. So, I knew I couldn’t just take back up where I left off. I knew my art would have to reflect that. But my drawing and painting skills were rusty. It was frustrating not to have the loose and energetic line quality I had. In the beginning it was too forced and overthought. After not drawing or painting for several years I had to retrain myself. In a way it was harder re-honing my skills than beginning from scratch because the preconceived notions of what I used to do were getting in the way. I also knew I wanted some social or environmental justice themes in my art. I have found a satisfying balance between advocacy art and the art that is more spontaneous and playful.\n\nAAS: The last couple of years have been very busy for you. I would like to first talk about your recent Water Is Life mural. It is spectacular!\n\nTH: This was different from my other public art pieces because it was a collaboration between me and the US Water Alliance and Central Arkansas Water. It was part of the Accelerator program, funded by the US Water Alliance to engage the public with addressing water issues and climate change. The idea behind the partnership with CAW and the community was to involve the community in the process. In the end, around 70 people had a hand in creating the mural.\n\nHere in Little Rock, Arkansas our water utility provides us with some of the best water in the nation. So I asked CAW if we could get a water bottle filler in the mural, giving 24/7 water access to people on the streets. Sharing and celebrating our good water. They loved the idea, so that feature is what the mural was designed around. It also gives the art a function. I like it when art is functional.\n\nAs for the design elements, the design changed and elements were added along the way. Not the way most murals come to be. This one was not fully realized when we started painting. We started with the phrase Forest to Faucet, which is the project name. I drew stylized trees to border the top and stylized water to border the bottom and had volunteers from the Clinton School of Public Service come and paint a kind of paint by numbers. It was stressful being the artist and not having the design already on paper, but it grew and came together perfectly. I brought in the stencil images representing things you need water for. In this way we were able to engage more people in the process. The words Water is Life and the image of a local person, Derek Brooks, holding out the water, actually came fairly late in the design. Once I set on adding the words in bright sunset orange colors, and the image of a person, I knew I wanted the person to be someone that the community knew and could connect with. This was a pilot program and there was a lot of experimentation and meetings and interviews with various groups and individuals added to the art and design. I had done a lot of social justice art, and really was honored to get to also do some environmental justice public art. I am still in talks with Central Arkansas Water about other places to do public art.\n\nAAS: You have been very involved in the 7th Street Mural Project and I’ve interviewed several artists who have contributed to it. Talk about the work you have done and what the project means to the artists and community.\n\nTH: I first got involved with the Peace Week murals on 7th Street through the Arkansas Coalition for Peace and Justice annual community painting events in 2016 and have had a role in the murals ever since. The real growth happened in 2020, after the George Floyd incident sparked national activism. The 7th street corridor grew organically with the lead of some of the graffiti artists painting George Floyd’s portrait on a section of the wall. The seeds planted by the ACPJ grew on its own with artists from all walks of life coming down and putting their messages of peace and justice on the walls. It was an extremely special thing to be a part of, to watch the community come down and be a part of it. It is really hard to explain the feeling of this time, a true grassroots art as activism happening that spanned a quarter of a mile of walls under the railroad tracks. These murals belong to the community and it shows. People gather to take graduation photos, music videos, family outings, etc.\n\nWorking on 7th street with artists from so many practices was a most wonderful experience. We were all so different, but the messages of peace and social justice carried a common thread. We bonded. We did not always agree, but the message was bigger than any one of us.\n\nI came up with the Patchwork Peace and Protest mural idea for 2020 Peace Week featuring local activist Crystal Mercer, who is a textile artist and poet herself. I think the theme that year was something like Piecing Peace Together, so hence the quilt sewn together with messages from 33 people who painted on the quilt sections. There are many viewpoints, as well as different languages on the mural, including Spanish and Igbo. I am currently working on one with several other women including Melissa Gill and others. “Women Belong In All Places Where Decisions Are Being Made” will shine light on various female social justice warriors.\n\nTH: This show was a story about both finding new inspiration during a time of isolation and my obsession with one particular muse for 52+ weeks, Janet. I drew many a character that she became through the drawing sessions produced by Drawing Cabaret Couture. The dynamic duo of Janet Mayer (model and cabaret dancer) and partner Matthew Lawrence (stage designer and camera man) have brought the designs of many famous and emerging fashion designers forward. Their extensive staging and inspiring soundtracks drew artists from around the world into another world through each zoom session.\n\nThe piece 8 Cents Love was first drawn in a DCC session with a 70’s theme. But it was unfinished. I worked on it later to add to the story and make it my own. The stamps were some I have had in a box since the 70’s when I was young. I never knew why I saved them, but this was the time to use them. I was transported back to my youth in the making of this piece. It definitely has a pop vintage air about it.\n\nTH: This was a perfect project for me, combining my advocacy for criminal justice reform and getting to bring together a bunch of artists for the show. I was invited by Morgan Leyenberger, the director of Compassion Works for All at the time, to help her and Ellie Wheeler make their vision of this activist art show come to life. I helped them reach out to get local artists to participate. We had 25 artists do artwork to tell the stories of the incarcerated participants. We had 2 or more artists creating portraits per participant, each having very diverse styles, so some portraits were traditional and some more conceptual or stylized. The show was a great success. The show did help raise awareness of the work Compassion Works For All does by taking meditation into the prisons to help free the minds of those incarcerated. We also raised some funds through the show so they could continue their work.\n\nI did one of the portraits of John Ponder. I tried to honor the story he provided. I did not try to judge why he might be there. I thought “Can people recreate themselves behind those concrete walls and wire fences?” The answer was a resounding yes. John was sentenced to life at the young age of 14. He said “I came of age, matured as a man in prison…”. So, I wanted to show the light of the human spirit breaking out of the bleak concrete walls of the prison. The bird in the image is collaged onto the canvas of a bird he had drawn. I wanted to tell the story of how art frees the mind and soul of those locked away. The marks on the wall represent the years he has been in jail. He saw the newspaper story about the show and wrote me via the gallery. John was amazed at how well I communicated his situation.\n\nCompassion Works For All takes meditation practices into the prisons. They have helped many an individual survive the inhumane conditions of prison and solitary confinement. Some have later re-entered society successfully in part due to this organization. Using my art as a social or environmental tool makes it seem worthy. We do plan to do another one with CWFA in the near future.\n\nAAS: Tanya, you seem to enjoy working out in public and with the public. What have you learned about yourself through all of this and what is next for you?\n\nTH: I am an extrovert. That does not always work for an artist, because long, lone hours in a studio are part of the practice. When I get to work with people it energizes me and feeds my soul. Working with the public to create public art is special in that the art belongs to the community. Being a part of something larger than myself or my own work can’t be put into words. I have to find opportunities to work with people to keep myself from becoming stale. I do have some ideas not yet formulated that I hope will keep me working with others and making art outside the studio."
