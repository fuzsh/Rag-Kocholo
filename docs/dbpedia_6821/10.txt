Events being hosted by Homotopia this year include theatre shows, workshops, parties and film previews

The UK’s longest-running LGBTQ+ arts festival is returning to Liverpool.

Homotopia is set to take over the city for three weeks as it celebrates its 20th anniversary - with a focus on queer history and heritage this time around. This year’s festival, themed Gods and Monsters, will see a range of “cutting-edge” entertainment from visual arts to theatre, live music and performances.

‌

For 2023, Homotopia is asking visitors to consider how to “foster a sense of community and mutual care in the face of an increasingly intolerant society - and how to build a space of love and respect for those within the LGBTQ+ community who are often most demonised within the mainstream”.

Festival programmer Alice Holland said: “The opportunity to curate the 20th edition of Homotopia is a huge privilege, and as a newcomer to Liverpool it has been incredible to learn the city through meeting the festival’s networks, audiences and supporters. My hope for this programme is that we find new ways of being together, of being there for each other, and enjoying a glittery, gorgeous giggle before the hibernation season kicks in.

“There will be some festival favourites of course, but we have also tried to open up new spaces for queer work and community, to make the most of Homotopia’s status as a beloved child of the city. I can’t wait to see what the next 20 years of queer culture will look like here.”

Here are all the events happening as the festival celebrates its milestone anniversary.
