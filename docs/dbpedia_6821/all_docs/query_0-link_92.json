        "text": "Inaugural Interdisciplinary Queer Studies Symposium University of California, Merced\n\nSaturday, April 9th, 2016\n\nKeynote: Eric A. Stanley, UC Riverside\n\nEric A. Stanley is an assistant professor in the Department of Gender and Sexuality Studies at the University of California, Riverside. Along with Chris Vargas, Eric directed the films Homotopia (2006) and Criminal Queers (2015). A coeditor of the anthology Captive Genders: Trans Embodiment and the Prison Industrial Complex (AK Press, 2011) which won the Prevention for a Safe Society award and was a finalist for a Lambda Literary Award, Eric's other writing can be found in the journals Social Text, American Quarterly, Women and Performance, and TSQ.\n\nIn August of this year, based on the recommendation of the Anthropocene Working Group, geologists will vote to determine whether the Anthropocene should be considered an official geological epoch and (if they vote yes) decide when it began. As recent critical discussions of the term have insisted, periodizing the Anthropocene means making an argument about the Anthropocene. An Anthropocene beginning in 1610 is radically different from one that starts in 1784/1800, and the AWG's likely proposal of 1945/1960 paints a dramatically different picture of the Anthropocene compared to the c. 1800 timeline that has to date received the most attention.\n\nMonsters remain powerful creatures for what they are and what they represent. Straight from mythology and legend, these fantastic creatures creep across our television and movie screens and the pages of our books. Over centuries and across cultures, the inhuman have represented numerous cultural fears and, in more recent times, desires. They are Other. They are Us. This panel will explore the literal monsters--whether they be mythological, extraterrestrial, or man-made--that populate fiction and film, delving into the cultural, psychological and/or theoretical implications. Please submit a 250-300 word abstract, a brief bio, and any A/V needs by May 6, 2016 to\n\nCrystal O'Leary-Davidson\n\nImportant dates\n\n20 March 2016 – Abstract (500 words) and biography (500 words) due\n\n28 March 2016 – Feedback given\n\n2 June 2016 – Full paper due (3500 - 4000 words)\n\n12 July 2016 – Feedback given\n\n2 September 2016 – Final paper and presentation due (presentation no more than 20 minutes long)\n\n8 October 2016 – Conference, London, UK\n\nI am editing a collection of academic essays on action figures for McFarland Publishers. The first manuscript deadline is September of this year, and we could use a couple more essays in the collection. (We have about 8 so far; I'm looking to up that to 10-11.) Action Figure Studies is a subdiscipline of Pop Culture Studies in which scholars study the relationship between action figures and gender, culture, politics, religion, body representation, and/or any other subject of academic study.\n\nWe are currently seeking 1-2 panelists for the NWSA conference, \"Decoloniality,\" which will be held November 10-13 in Montreal. Please note that we are looking for papers that will focus on a particular example to illustrate methodological arguments. The other papers currently in the panel focus on critical autobiography and creative visual representation - abstracts for these papers can be provided, if requested! If interested, please submit a 50-100 word abstract to kristarj@gmail.com and rahurst@stfx.ca as soon as possible - we hope to assemble the final panel between February 18-20.\n\nFrom film noir to sci-fi, Terry Gilliam to David Lynch, dystopian narratives continue to hold a prominent place in film across independent, Hollywood, and international film communities. In keeping with the theme of authorship and audience, we seek papers addressing writing, directing, visual style, and performance in dystopian films. Papers on the work of David Lynch or other directors of dystopian films are encouraged, and we especially welcome papers that incorporate close readings of films.\n\nPaper proposals addressing the SAMLA 88 theme are especially welcome; further topic ideas are listed below.\n\nThe deadline for the submission of articles and book reviews is May 9, 2016.\n\nThe final decision of the AIC Editorial Board will be passed on before September 4, 2016.\n\nCorrections (if required) and comments by the authors expected between September 5, 2016 and September 19, 2016.\n\nThe e-publication of the AIC 18th issue is planned for September 30, 2016.\n\nRoots and Legacies\n\nA Cultures, Societies, Traditions Project\n\n1st Global Meeting\n\nCall for Participation 2016\n\nTuesday 13th September – Thursday 15th September 2016\n\nMansfield College, Oxford, United Kingdom\n\n\"A man finds room in the few square inches of the face for the traits of all his ancestors; for the expression of all his history, and his wants.\"\n\n— Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\nWhile in academia the notion of authenticity has been increasingly discredited, it thrives as a label within popular discourses and for the marketing of cultural artefacts. Considering both practice and theory of cultural production, the planned conference aims at analyzing the paradoxical status of authenticity as well as its role for the construction of collective identities in a globalizing world of ever-increasing cultural flux.\n\nThis session invites submissions of paper proposals on plays and/or performances under the broad category of modern drama. Comparative Drama as well as Drama in English papers are welcome.\n\nBy May 10, 2016, please submit a 300-word abstract, brief bio, and A/V requirements to Aaron Botwick, The Graduate Center, CUNY, at abotwick@gradcenter.cuny.edu"
