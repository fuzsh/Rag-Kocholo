        "text": "Martin Green and James Lawler are DuoVision, co-curators of The Holly Johnson Story, in partnership with National Museums Liverpool and Homotopia.\n\nThe Holly Johnson Story opens on 14 September 2024 running until Sunday 27 July 2025. Book your tickets here\n\nDuoVision has worked extensively with the LGBTQIA+ creative community since 2012, curating exhibitions by undervalued artists, photographers and designers, aimed at engaging with a wider audience.\n\nUntil 2020, they curated exhibitions at The Gallery, Liverpool, featuring artists including Duggie Fields, Caroline Coon, Pam Hogg, Peter Ashworth, Jarvis Cocker, Marc Almond and more. Since then, DuoVision have curated exhibitions at; Cartier, Paris; Potteries Museum, Stoke on Trent; Gallery46, Whitechapel, London; Fitzrovia Chapel, London; Tramps, London; TCFE, Soho, London.\n\n“There are many artists who haven’t had the recognition they deserve”, says Martin, “and central to our work has been the ethos of casting a light on both the quality of the work they have produced, as well as making the artworld see them in a different light”.\n\nThis began with Duggie Fields, the late British artist, who Duovision exhibited in the Gallery in 2012 with the show Welcome To My World.\n\n“Duggie’s work was evocative of a certain era and culture of British art and identity that blended pop culture references, music, queer identity, post punk, flamboyance and dazzling colour. He was chronically overlooked by the art world so this exhibition was a stamp, a mark in the ground to say ‘you have to recognise how important this artist is”.\n\nWelcome to My World featured paintings, prints, objects and sculpture from Duggie’s archive and work that had featured in solo shows in London, Tokyo and New York.\n\nThrough Duggie, DuoVision met Caroline Coon, an iconic figure of the counterculture, known as a photographer and campaigner, but whose visual art was not well known.\n\n“In 2018 we held the first solo show by Caroline Coon at The Gallery, The Great Offender. It was Caroline’s introduction to the artworld as this fully formed, astonishingly talented and yet overlooked artistic figure”.\n\nThat exhibition catapulted Coon into the artworld, positioning her a vital figure within the narrative of female art.\n\n“Too often in the artworld, people are put into a certain box early in their career and they stay there. If we do truly want to be both diverse and inclusive, we have to give people the freedom and ability to evolve through their life and artistic journey. The artist you begin your career as when you are young isn’t the same one you will be as you age. Giving the ability to document and exhibit that journey is a huge part of fully embedding the artist experience within culture”.\n\nIn 2018 other exhibitions featured the British fashion designer Pam Hogg and photographer Peter Ashworth.\n\nThe Holly Johnson Story is an exhibition part of this tradition about seeing creatives in a different light from the one they have been perceived.\n\n“My personal journey began with Holly in 1982” says James, “when I saw him perform with the unsigned Frankie Goes to Hollywood art at my art college. His openness about his sexuality was affirming and influential during a time of rampant homophobia. In the 80s, Holly was one of the musicians whose unapologetic approach to their own sexuality helped shift mainstream understanding and acceptance”\n\n“We approached Holly about doing this exhibition. Then we talked to Homotopia about securing Heritage Lottery funding and they, with other partners, helped us to work on the application, which was successful. Then we partnered with National Museums Liverpool for an exhibition space”.\n\nThe Holly Johnson Story opens on 14 September 2024 running until Sunday 27 July 2025.\n\nBook your tickets here\n\nRead about the exhibition here\n\nFollow DuoVision here\n\nA major new exhibition exploring the life and art of Holly Johnson and the heritage of LGBTQIA+ communities in Liverpool. Opening Saturday 14 September 2024 running until Sunday 27 July 2025.\n\nBook your exhibition tickets here\n\nHomotopia is delighted to share more details about this major new exhibition and project in partnership with Museum of Liverpool and DuoVision.\n\nOpening at Museum of Liverpool on Saturday 14 September 2024, The Holly Johnson Story explores the incredible life of Holly Johnson and his meteoric rise to fame. The Holly Johnson Story celebrates Holly’s creative genius, and marks the 40th anniversary of the release of Frankie Goes to Hollywood album, ‘Welcome to the Pleasuredome’, featuring songs ‘Relax’, ‘Two Tribes’ and ‘The Power of Love’.\n\nSupported by a £142,338 grant from The National Lottery Heritage Fund, National Museums Liverpool has partnered with local arts organisations Homotopia and DuoVision in collaboration with Holly Johnson to deliver this landmark exhibition that will take visitors on a journey through Holly’s outstanding career, from his early years in Liverpool to international stardom.\n\nMade possible by National Lottery players, the exhibition is part of a project that has documented LGBTQIA+ heritage by working with sexual health and wellness charity Sahir, to explore Holly’s archive and capture the stories of local LGBTQIA+ people in community workshops and oral history sessions.\n\nFeatured in the exhibition are unique items from Holly Johnson’s career, including iconic costumes by Leigh Bowery and Vivienne Westwood, Frankie Goes to Hollywood memorabilia, personal audio accounts of people living with HIV in Liverpool, produced in collaboration with Sahir House, and paintings by Holly himself.\n\nSocial and political unrest in a changing 1980s Britain led the way for a cultural revolution, set against a backdrop of synth-pop music and experimental sounds. The era was a time of innovation and rebellion, punks, and new wave bands, and at the forefront stood Holly Johnson.\n\nThe Holly Johnson Story charts Holly’s early personal life and career, from a young musician to an internationally renowned, openly gay star, living in the public eye. Dealing with the price of fame, coping with an HIV+ diagnosis and the unwanted negative press, whilst going it alone as a monumental LGBTQIA+ icon.\n\nThrough polarising emotions of glamour and sexual liberation, alongside fear, loss, and stigma, The Holly Johnson Story tells the stories of people who experienced the gay scene in the 1980s, and the devastating impact and legacy of HIV.\n\nHolly Johnson said: “The opportunity to mount this exhibition is actually like winning the National Lottery for me. As a teenager Music and Art were my passion, reading Jean Genet, William Burroughs and listening to the music of The Beatles, Marc Bolan, David Bowie and The Velvet Underground: seeing the films of Derek Jarman and Andy Warhol along with his supercharged colour paintings. Pondering over Peter Blake’s Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band artwork as a child led me ultimately to Hollywood and back again. Everything I was ever drawn to, through a lens of Queerness and controversy I brought with me into the future we live in now.” @mrhollyjohnson\n\nSinéad Nunes, Board of Trustees at Homotopia:\n\n“For over 20 years, Homotopia’s platforming, commissioning and celebration of the very best in Queer arts has been grounded in social and political justice. We could not be more excited to be bringing Holly’s story to new audiences in this incredible retrospective. Holly’s artistic and cultural impact, alongside his unapologetically punk activism and HIV/AIDS advocacy, cement him as one of Liverpool’s foremost LGBTQIA+ icons.\n\nThis is also an opportunity to platform the next generation of homegrown, Queer talent, with a soon-to-be-announced wraparound programme of music, performance and talks, showcasing fresh local voices.”\n\nJames Lawler, Curator at DuoVision:\n\n“We’re so excited to focus on the life and work of trailblazing artist Holly Johnson. My personal journey with Holly began in 1982 when I saw him perform with the then unsigned Frankie Goes To Hollywood at my art college. His openness about his sexuality was affirming and influential during a time of rampant homophobia. In the 80s, Holly was one of the musicians whose unapologetic approach to their own sexuality helped shift mainstream understanding and acceptance.” @Duovision_arts\n\nHelen Feathertsone, Director, England, North at The National Lottery Heritage Fund:\n\n“It’s fantastic to see this transformative project conclude with this landmark exhibition. This work has recorded and preserved the important stories of LGBTQIA+ people and the significant influence Holly Johnson has had on our cultural and musical heritage. Thanks to National Lottery players, we’re proud to have supported this project that will ensure the voices and memories of the community will be heard for generations to come.” @heritagefunduk\n\nThe Holly Johnson Story opens at the Museum of Liverpool on Saturday 14 September 2024 running until Sunday 27 July 2025.\n\nFor more information and to book your tickets, visit here\n\nThis September, The Holly Johnson Story opens at the Museum of Liverpool, produced by Homotopia in partnership with National Museums Liverpool and curators DuoVision.We can’t wait for you to see it and enjoy our wraparound programme of events.\n\nAfter 20 years of Homotopia, we’ve decided to take a short break from our annual festival for 2024 . Rest assured, we aren’t going anywhere! We’re working away on the Holly Johnson exhibition, programme, partnerships, and gearing up to bring you something extra special for 2025.\n\nHomotopia is an Arts Council England NPO organisation with funding in place until 2026. Our artist development programmes will also continue this year, with plans developing for Young Homotopia, Queercore and Queer the City. Our commitment to supporting and developing new and existing talent isn’t changing. New opportunities to be part of these programmes will be announced soon.\n\nHomotopia Festival is the UK’s longest-running celebration of Queer art. We are incredibly proud of our amazing festival that runs alongside our work across the year covering artist development, city-wide exhibitions and even one hell of a cabaret for Eurovision 2023. We exist in a climate where artists are under increasing pressure, and where that climate feels increasingly hostile to Queer folks, globally and locally. We understand how important our support and platforming of art and activism is, and we want to do it in the best, most sustainable way.\n\nHomotopia is a small team, and in order to allow space for this refocus, and to deliver The Holly Johnson Story, alongside its wrap-around events and our committed artist development programmes, we decided to take this short break from the full scale festival. We have been working closely with our funders and stakeholders on this decision in order to prioritise the wellbeing of our team and ensure we can continue to deliver the best work we can; to futureproof Homotopia so that we are here for the next 20 years.\n\nThe Holly Johnson Story’s supporting programme will include visual arts, music, talks and of course a party or two! We hope that events around this exhibition will spark creativity and vital conversations, with programmes exploring Queer identity in Liverpool and supporting education around World Aids Day.\n\nWe’re still here, doing what we do best, which is to support and platform local, national, and international LGBTQIA socially engaged artists and creatives. We’re looking forward to another amazing year ahead, which includes the upcoming exhibition showcasing the life, legacy and art of Holly Johnson.\n\nHomotopia Festival will be back in 2025: bigger, bolder and of course, Queerer than ever!"
