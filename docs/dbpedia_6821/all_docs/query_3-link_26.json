        "text": "In my M.A. thesis of 2007 I analyze Andy Warhol's Lonesome Cowboys and Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain as queer appropriations of the classic western. Both movies subvert the archetypical heterosexuality of the cowboy figure by depicting sexual relations between their male heroes. In doing so, they exploit the fact that in classic westerns men prefer the company of other men to the company of women. A premise of the Myth of the Frontier is that new frontiers are necessary for the further development of the American nation. Both movies catch onto the Myth of the Frontier and envision a better America for same-sex desire. Their respective queer frontiers are in dialogue with the sexual politics of their time: Gay Liberation and the \"sexual revolution\" in 1968 and lobbying for equal rights - same-sex marriage in particular - in 2005. Nevertheless Lonesome Cowboys and Brokeback Mountain reproduce, each in its own way, the ethnic and sexual universalism of the classic western that masks various expressions of queer difference. Like the classic western, these queer westerns work best for white men. My thesis traces the subversion of the classic western, its creative employment, and the reproduction of its universalism in each of these movies."
