        "text": "Trans* military veterans are focus of Museum of Liverpool exhibition\n\nThe Museum of Liverpool is to host a special exhibition by local award-winning photographer Stephen King, following a collaboration with trans* military veterans and Liverpool John Moores University.\n\nExhibited in partnership with Homotopia, Dry Your Eyes Princess opens Wednesday 16 December 2015 until Sunday 31 January 2016.\n\n12 large scale portraits examine the link between the sitter’s gender identity and their experience of military service. The title is an ironic re-appropriation of the derogatory command to toughen up, that is to ‘dry your eyes princess’, heard by many of the exhibition’s participants whilst serving in the British Armed Forces.\n\nThe portraits are of people from Liverpool and other parts of the country who participated in research conducted by Dr Emma Vickers, Senior Lecturer in History, at Liverpool John Moores University. Her work examined their experiences of life before, during and after service in the British Armed Forces. It is the first research in Europe to focus on trans* veterans and likewise, King’s photographic response is the first to look at trans* experiences of military service through visual art.\n\nDr Vickers’ research uncovered that trans* people in the armed forces were dismissed in significant numbers before the ban on openly-trans* personnel was lifted in Britain in 1999. She said:\n\nKing’s photographs are based on their oral testimonies as well as his own conversations with each sitter. He said:\n\nThis is King’s second exhibition at a National Museums Liverpool venue. In 2010, Lewis’s fifth floor: a department story attracted record visitors to the National Conservation Centre.\n\nJen McCarthy, Deputy Director of the Museum of Liverpool, said:\n\nFor more information visit liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol Trans* - an umbrella term for people whose gender identity and/or gender expression differs from the sex they were assigned at birth.\n\nNotes to editors\n\nMuseum of Liverpool\n\nThe Museum of Liverpool is the largest newly-built national museum in Britain for more than a century, demonstrating Liverpool’s unique contribution to the world.
