        "text": "Criminal Queers visualizes a radical trans/queer struggle against the prison industrial complex and toward a world without walls. Remembering that prison breaks are both a theoretical and material practice of freedom, this film imagines what spaces might be opened up if crowbars, wigs, and metal files become tools for transformation. Follow Yoshi, Joy, Susan and Lucy as they fiercely read everything from the Human Rights Campaign and hate crimes legislation to the non-profitization of social movements. Criminal Queers grows our collective liberation by working to abolish the multiple ways our hearts, genders, and desires are confined.\n\nChris E. Vargas is a video maker & interdisciplinary artist currently based in Bellingham, WA whose work deploys humor and performance in conjunction with mainstream idioms to explore the complex ways that queer and trans people negotiate spaces for themselves within historical & institutional memory and popular culture.\n\nEric A. Stanley works at the intersections of radical trans/queer aesthetics, theories of state violence, and anticolonial struggle. Along with Chris Vargas, they directed the films Homotopia (2006) and Criminal Queers (2016). A co-editor of the anthology Captive Genders: Trans Embodiment and the Prison Industrial Complex (AK Press, 2011/2015), Ericâ€™s other writing can be found in the journals Social Text, American Quarterly, Women and Performance and TSQ."
