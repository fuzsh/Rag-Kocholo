        "text": "Alien Body, Human Dreams is a series of cinematic investigations that centre the body as a potent site of hybridity, rejecting false divisions of man/woman, human/animal/alien, and self/other to construct their own embodied and multifaceted ways of being.\n\nArtists in this programme purposefully employ queering as a technique to misread, re-appropriate, and puncture the systems of power projected onto the body.\n\nIn these works by queer Southeast and East Asian filmmakers, we meet a speculative reality where human body parts are sold in food trucks and witness a dance-fight between a lion dancer and a contemporary dancer. Bodyhacking, ritualising, and ceremonialising is used to knead cosmologies, folding knowledge in upon themselves.\n\nCurated by April Lin 林森\n\nPresented by Homotopia, in partnership with Queer East and Liverpool ESEA Network\n\nDoors: 18:00 Screening: 18:30\n\nDoors open 30 minutes before the screening and the programme will start promptly at 18:30. Please arrive in plenty of time to help our team ensure everyone has a great experience.\n\nThis screening will be followed by a 30 minute in-conversation with curator, April Lin 林森.\n\nFULL PROGRAMME\n\nTo Boyhood, I Never Knew Him (2022)\n\nWords from a transgender man float to the surface as fleeting memories go on.\n\nDir. Trâm Anh Nguyễn (Canada)\n\nLonging for the Sun to Set Upwards (2022)\n\nAn ode to the multiplicity, mutability, and expansion of what constitutes a body and a self, through imaging and technological mediations.\n\nDir. Jao San Pedro (Philippines)\n\nBeast (2022)\n\nA martial arts inspired dance-fight between a lion dancer and queer performer reflects the tension between traditional and modern identities.\n\nDir. Aileen Ye (Netherlands)\n\nDisease of Manifestation (2011)\n\nThe work builds itself towards the anarchistic conditions of the inner scenes, can also be seen as a wrong-manifesto.\n\nDir. Tzu An Wu (Taiwan)\n\nYummy Body Truck (2021)\n\nA fictional food truck selling human body parts mixed with other organisms in a biotechno-queer fantasy of interspecies mixing.\n\nDir. Noam Youngrak Son (Netherlands)\n\nBXBY (2022)\n\nIn this self-recorded performance blending documentary and ritual practice, a hybrid creature attempts reproduction.\n\nDir. Soojin Chang (UK)\n\n*Please note BXBY contains scenes of a graphic nature which viewers may find distressing, including explicit nudity, and graphic scenes of the preparation of a dead animal.\n\nGarden Amidst the Flame (2022)\n\nA playful and imaginative fantasy that challenges the hypermasculine presentation of Minahasan ritual culture and everyday life.\n\nDir. Natasha Tontey (Indonesia)"
