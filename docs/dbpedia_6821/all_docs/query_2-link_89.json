        "text": "Since launching our ‘Get Up and Glow’ newsletter last year, our ‘Chats With’ feature has been a way to share what is happening in the LGBT+ community in the region and to highlight individuals and organisations that are making change and supporting us.\n\nThere are many reasons we’ll host a ‘chat with’. They may be connected to an upcoming event, like our chat with Char Binns, ahead of Homotopia 2020 and Darren Suarez as the Vogue Ball approached.\n\nThey might be linked to personal achievements, like Ben Hodge after winning ‘Best Documentary at the Into Film Awards, for his short 1 Year, or breaking news such as our chat with Paul Amann from Kop Outs, after footballer Thomas Beattie came out, or Caroline Paige’s appointment as Joint Chief Executive at the UK’s only LGBT+ military charity, Fighting With Pride.\n\nWe also use the feature to shine a spotlight on new and emerging talent, and smaller community organisations that don’t always get the attention they deserve. We’ve spoken to local grassroots sports groups and supporter organisations like, Liverpool Tritons RUFC and Liverpool Frontrunners, as well as local artists like Kiara Mohammed.\n\nWe’ve spoken with local LGBT+ venues like Masquerade and GBar, support and community groups like GYRO LGBTQ+ Youth, Liverpool Bi+ Group and Sahir House and allies including DCC Julie Cooke, Savera UK’s Afrah Qassim and, Jake Mills from Chasing the Stigma and the team from Culture Liverpool.\n\nCheck out our chats with articles at the bottom of this article!\n\nWe’ve completed over 20 interviews to date and we know we have only touched the tip of the iceberg. Of course we have ideas of who we might want to speak to next, but we also want to hear from you.\n\nIf you know someone – or indeed are someone – you think we’d have a great chat with, please get in touch. You can be an LGBT+ individual from any sector or industry, a representative of an organisation or business that provides support or services to the LGBT+ community, a venue for LGBT+ people, or a festival or event that showcases or caters to the LGBT+ community.\n\nTo submit an individual or organisation for consideration for the feature, simply email our PR Manager, Nikki – press@lcrpride.co.uk – we’ll get the kettle on…"
