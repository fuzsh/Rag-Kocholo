You can find out more about commissions on our Patreon.\n\nHmm, a 2000s-era supernatural love triangle YA novel by a Utah-raised author with a lot of extremely unfortunate implications baked into the lore....this all sounds familiar, but we can't put our finger on it. Maybe it's just Pike specifically name-dropping Stephanie Meyer all over the place. If only this protagonist had as much going on internally as Bella Swan.\n\nCONTENT WARNING: Discussion of disordered eating and fatphobia, ableism, racism, anti-vax rhetoric/alternate medicine, eugenics, body horror, sexual harassment, and misogyny\n\nAlex's YA Recs: https://theafictionado.wordpress.com/tag/book-recs/\n\n0:30 Commission!\n\n2:00 Content Warnings\n\n5:00 Drink Recipe\n\n8:00 Stealth Mormonism\n\n11:00 Our Stunning Perfect Heroine\n\n18:00 Mmm, Gender Politics\n\n23:00 Missing Body Horror\n\n27:00 The Bad Boy One\n\n32:00 Fairy Biology and Cosmology\n\n41:00 Holy Eugenics Batman\n\n47:00 A Climax Allegedly Ensues\n\n56:00 The Shadow of Homeopathy\n\nSay hi to Dorothy and Vrai on Twitter @writervrai and @dorothynotgale\n\nOur icon was designed by Allison Shabet.\n\nGet bonus episodes on our Patreon: patreon.com/trashandtreasures\n\nJoin us every two weeks on Soundcloud, iTunes or Stitcher â and if youâd leave a rating and review, so that more people can find their way to us, weâd appreciate it!\n\nOur summer celebration of Pride comes to a close (with many apologies for the delay) on a return to a familiar face: Jamie Babbit, best known for the landmark lesbian film BUT I'M A CHEERLEADER. Today we look at her 2007 follow-up, its deliberate attempts to introduce young viewers to the world of queer activism, and how well it achieves those goals. Also, the fact that you've probably never heard of it.\n\nCONTENT WARNING: Discussion of misogyny, body-shaming, fatphobia, homophobia and gaybashing, transphobia, racism, infidelity, age-gap relationships, and war crimes.\n\nRAFIKI: https://www.kanopy.com/product/rafiki\n\nOF LOVE AND LAW: https://vimeo.com/ondemand/oflovelaw\n\n1:00 Wolfe Media\n\n10:00 âC***s in Actionâ\n\n17:00 Generational Activism Divide\n\n32:00 The Act Three Problem\n\n39:00 The Ghost in the Film\n\n44:00 Theory vs Accessibility\n\n49:00 Bonus Recs\n\nSay hi to Dorothy and Vrai on Twitter @writervrai and @dorothynotgale\n\nOur icon was designed by Allison Shabet.\n\nGet bonus episodes on our Patreon: patreon.com/trashandtreasures\n\nJoin us every two weeks on Soundcloud, iTunes or Stitcher â and if youâd leave a rating and review, so that more people can find their way to us, weâd appreciate it!\n\nListen, this is a queer podcast 365 days a year. Pride Month won't be stopped by a little thing like June being over. It's time for the 90s, and the film its director describes as \"an episode of Beverly Hills 90210 on acid.\"\n\nOn the board for this episode: the difference between \"queer representation\" and \"queer cinema,\" the queer reclaiming of mainstream genre work, and the pros and cons of making intensely of-the-moment art.\n\nCONTENT WARNING: Discussion of suicide, racism, child sexual abuse, homophobia+biphobia, religiosity, gore/animal death and body horror\n\nVariety Interview: https://variety.com/2019/tv/features/gregg-araki-starz-now-apocalypse-1203155576/\n\nBlack Is, Black Ain't: http://newsreel.org/video/BLACK-IS-BLACK-AINT\n\nDisclosure: https://www.netflix.com/title/81284247\n\nPoison: https://zeitgeistfilms.com/film/poison\n\n1:00 Intro to Araki + New Queer Cinema\n\n12:00 24 Hours of âNowhereâ\n\n14:00 Ethics and Young Actors\n\n17:00 The Teen Soap Gang\n\n22:00 Alien Invasion\n\n26:00 At the Party\n\n32:00 Nihilism and Vulnerability\n\n37:00 Pop Culture Time Capsule\n\n40:00 Fuck Harmony Korine Corner\n\n45:00 Queer Cinema Recs\n\nSay hi to Dorothy and Vrai on Twitter @writervrai and @dorothynotgale\n\nOur icon was designed by Allison Shabet.\n\nGet bonus episodes on our Patreon: patreon.com/trashandtreasures\n\nJoin us every two weeks on Soundcloud, iTunes or Stitcher â and if youâd leave a rating and review, so that more people can find their way to us, weâd appreciate it!\n\nIt's time at last to spotlight the patron saint of this podcast, the pope of filth himself: John Waters. While he's better known for Pink Flamingos, Female Trouble is the most potent and maybe the best of his 1970s work, a razor-sharp satire of heteronormative culture that can only flourish because it comes from such a tight team of collaborating artists and weirdos.\n\nBut it's also worth asking: what happens when an outsider artist becomes a public figure? What does that new element of privilege do to their art and how they relate to the marginalized community they come from?\n\nCONTENT WARNING: Discussion of sexual assault, incest, homophobia, transphobia, child abuse (physical/emotional/sexual), cults, and ableism\n\nI Am Divine (Documentary; also on Netflix): https://vimeo.com/ondemand/iamdivinefilm\n\nFemale Trouble Theme: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5xziMBpf0Q\n\nShoes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HjIljJd-o0\n\nJohn Waters Interview (2015): https://www.indiewire.com/2015/08/john-waters-on-caitlyn-jenner-we-cant-make-fun-of-her-241129/\n\nJohn Waters Interview (2018): https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/08/john-waters-homotopia-festival-liverpool-manson-murders\n\n1:00 John Waters and Filth\n\n9:00 Divine and Gender\n\n11:30 Content Warnings\n\n13:00 The Life and Times of Dawn Davenport\n\n26:00 Queer Satire\n\n31:00 Modern Waters and Serial Mom\n\n38:00 Should You Watch This\n\nSay hi to Dorothy and Vrai on Twitter @writervrai and @dorothynotgale\n\nOur icon was designed by Allison Shabet.\n\nGet bonus episodes on our Patreon: patreon.com/trashandtreasures\n\nJoin us every two weeks on Soundcloud, iTunes or Stitcher â and if youâd leave a rating and review, so that more people can find their way to us, weâd appreciate it!\n\nHappy Pride Month, listeners! It's time for our annual four-episode journey through the history of queer film, and this year we'll be looking in particular at camp and outsider cinema.\n\nWhile Bride might be quite famous, it's also a perfect starting place for our discussion: director James Whale's camp masterpiece, which those who knew him spent years after his tragic death denying as a queer work (possibly, we suspect, because they feared it would be pigeonholed as \"gay art\" rather than cinema for everyone). Which leads to an even thornier question....how are queer artists pushed to define their audience?\n\nCONTENT WARNING: Discussion of racism, sexual assault, homophobia, and suicide.\n\nThe Hollywood Blacklist: http://www.youmustrememberthispodcast.com/episodes/2016/06/21/blacklistarchive\n\n\"Bela and Boris\" Miniseries: http://www.youmustrememberthispodcast.com/episodes/2017/11/21/belaandborisarchive\n\n1:00 Pride Intro\n\n2:30 The Code Era Returns\n\n10:00 A MORAL Sequel, Dear Viewer\n\n16:00 Thatâs Pretty Gay, Bro\n\n29:00 Craving for Legitimacy\n\n41:00 Listener Question\n\nSay hi to Dorothy and Vrai on Twitter @writervrai and @dorothynotgale\n\nOur icon was designed by Allison Shabet.\n\nGet bonus episodes on our Patreon: patreon.com/trashandtreasures\n\nJoin us every two weeks on Soundcloud, iTunes or Stitcher â and if youâd leave a rating and review, so that more people can find their way to us, weâd appreciate it!\n\nThe sequel's still better.\n\nWe revisit the weird double image of Magic Mike, a \"quiet lives of desperation\" dance movie that was marketed almost solely based on its five or six minutes of male strip revues. Which both sells the subtler moments of the script short and disguises the unmasked contempt that the film overall has for women. It's...well, listen. There's a reason we're covering it here.\n\nCONTENT WARNING: Discussion of toxic masculinity, misogyny, sexual assault, racism, whorephobia, classism, biphobia, and Matthew McConaughey\n\n1:00 Production Info\n\n12:00 Class in 2012\n\n15:00 About That Misogyny\n\n25:00 SHAME SPIRAL feat.
