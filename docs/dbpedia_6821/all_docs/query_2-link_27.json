        "text": "Last year over 3,500 people took part in Liverpool’s first ever gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender festival that saw leading artists, film makers, theatrical companies, comedians and more come together to create an event that was hailed by critics, audiences and performers as ‘a great success’. This year the organisers claim it will be even bigger with more than 50 events taking place over the two week period in November.\n\nLast year’s pilot festival was welcomed for bringing gay culture to a wider audience in Liverpool, with events enjoyed by a people from all sections of society and it’s hoped that this year’s line up will continue to invite a colourful mix of people from different backgrounds, cultures and age groups.\n\nFilm, theatre, comedy, cabaret and art events...\n\nSome of the highlights for this year’s festival include a special retrospective exhibition by the Liverpool born artist TRADEMARK and veteran performance poet Chloe Poems also returns to her native roots at Unity Theatre, to present a new show called ‘From Scottie Road to Harvard’. After the success of last year’s ‘Hello Sailor’ exhibition The Lavender Club has a host of events lined up featuring local, national and international artists, and a new event called ‘Lavender All At Sea’ aboard Britain’s only touring theatre ship the SS Carroldo, which features the award winning play ‘Laramie Project’, an American story about the murder of Matthew Shepard which became a worldwide symbol of intolerance.\n\nHomotopia will also be running a series of educational and topical events, collaborating with international artists Tim Miller and Bridge Markland, and hosting a live interview with leading gay / human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell as part of the dedicated lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (l,g,b,t for short!) archive project, ‘Tales from Yeser-Queer’. A variety of events called ‘Queer Conversations’ will see guests from politics, literature and theatre talking about various issues, and a special all female production of ‘Entartete Muzik’ will celebrate lesbian and gay music which was forbidden and classed as degenerate by Nazi Germany.\n\nAnd a film festival thrown in...\n\nThe Liverpool Lesbian & Gay Film Festival will return for its second year, as part of the wider festival, showcasing over 20 screenings at venues such as FACT and the Philharmonic Hall including the cult classic ‘Whatever Happened To Baby Jane’ and UK premieres of ‘Straight Jacket’ and the German documentary ‘Men, Heroes and Gay Nazis’. To tie in with Black History Month celebrations Homotopia also presents an exhibition called ‘Queen’s Jewels’ which articulates the Black l/g/b/t experience, using personal and media archive to tell the personal histories of black lesbians and gays living in the UK.\n\nThe festival runs from 31st October for two weeks, finishing with a closing party on 12th November. This year Marc Almond, former front man of the 80’s group Soft Cell will be appearing as part of the official closing ceremony which proved to be one of the most popular events of last year’s festival."
