        "text": "John Waters to headline Homotopia in his one-man show, the director, screenwriter, author, actor, stand-up comedian and all-round cult legend will return to Liverpool this autumn.\n\nIn his only live UK performance of the year, John Waters: This Filthy World comes to Liverpool Philharmonic Hall on Saturday 10 November 2018 and tickets are on sale now.\n\nThis Filthy World is a 'vaudeville' act that celebrates the film career and tastes of the man William Burroughs once called, 'The Pope of Trash'. Focussing on Waters' early negative artistic influences and his fascination with true crime, exploitation films, fashion lunacy and the extremes of the contemporary art world, this joyously devious monologue elevates all that is trashy in life into a call-to-arms to 'filth followers' everywhere.\n\nJohn Waters said \"Liverpool is just like Baltimore, unapologetic, cool and filled with great rebels who have a sense of humour about themselves. Can't wait to come back.\"\n\nJohn Waters has written and directed 16 movies including Pink Flamingos, Polyester, Hairspray, Cry Baby, and A Dirty Shame. He is a photographer whose work has been shown in galleries all over the world and the author of eight books.\n\nHomotopia Festival Manager, Char Binns said \"We are excited to welcome John back to Homotopia, to headline our 2018 festival. This will be his only UK date, he is a true legend and the ultimate crowd-pleaser. Festival goers are in for a treat.\"\n\nHomotopia Festival will take place in Liverpool between 3 November - 1 December 2018.\n\nHomotopia launched in 2004 and is a Liverpool based arts & social justice organisation making art, interventions and participation that inspires and unites communities. Every November it presents an annual festival of local, national and international LGBT+ arts & culture featuring an eclectic programme including theatrical world premieres, contemporary dance, visual art, debate, youth & community participation, heritage & film. Programming trailblazers, new commissions, exhibitions and award-winning social justice projects and education outreach work throughout the year. Homotopia was founded in response to Liverpool's bid for European Capital Of Culture 2008 and was a highlight of these celebrations. 2018 will mark our 15th birthday and the festival has become one of the key cultural festivals in the region. Homotopia curated a year-long 'Tom Of Finland Retrospective' in Turku, Finland as part of their European Capital Of Culture 2011. The same exhibition toured to the Kulturhuset in Stockholm attracting over 140,000 across the 2 shows. We have also developed projects in Poland and Turkey. We curated and presented a major exhibition on the life of Liverpool born trans pioneer Dr April Ashley MBE at the Museum of Liverpool which attracted 900,00 visitors and was extended twice due to popularity.\n\nJohn Waters has written and directed sixteen movies including Pink Flamingos, Polyester, Hairspray, Cry Baby, Serial Mom and A Dirty Shame. He is a photographer whose work has been shown in galleries all over the world and the author of eight books: Shock Value, Crackpot, Pink Flamingos and Other Trash, Hairspray, Female Trouble and Multiple Maniacs, and Art: A Sex Book (co-written with Bruce Hainley), Role Models and Carsick. The gift book, Make Trouble, published by Algonquin Books in 2017, features the text, with illustrations, of Waters' commencement speech delivered at the 2015 Rhode Island School of Design graduation ceremony and was subsequently released as an audio album in 7\" single format by Third Man Records.

In September 2014, Film Society of Lincoln Center honoured John Waters' fifty years in filmmaking with a 10-day celebration entitled \"Fifty Years of John Waters: How Much Can You Take?\" featuring a complete retrospective of his film work. In May 2015, Waters was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) and the same by the Maryland Institute College of Arts (MICA) in May 2016.
