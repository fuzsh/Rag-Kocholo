        "text": "Amy Pennington (they/them) is a northerner - they think it’s important you know that. They make films, performances and collaborative projects about class, sexuality and gender. Amy has made art with their family, residents in a care home and clients at a queer hair salon. They like wearing wigs and telling stories. Their work challenges who gets to express themselves, share their experiences and under what terms. Growing up, TV was their best teacher, so using humour and pop culture come naturally. They employ these tools to gently pull at the seams of what is ‘acceptable’ or ‘normal’, whether that is critiquing the health and wellbeing industry, what kinds of Trans stories are told, or who we imagine our queer ancestors to be.\n\nAmy has made work within institutions as well as self-organised groups and in the public realm. They have been commissioned by TATE Liverpool, Battersea Art Centre, Studio Voltaire, PEER Gallery, In-situ, QUAD, Heart Of Glass, Left Coast, Homotopia, The National Festival of Making, Newlyn Gallery and LADA.\n\nTheir films have been shown in a number of film festivals including Leeds international, GAZE, Queer Fringe! Filmpride Brighton & Hove. Where’s Danny? won the Iris Prize Community Award 2023. They were a finalist in screenshot 2023 a competition for comedy writer-performers hosted by Sister Pictures and South of the River Pictures.\n\nThis film is subtitled, This event is seated. The room will be dark.\n\nStudio Voltaire aligns with the Social Model of Disability. This means we are committed to making our venue accessible to everyone and to creating equal and equitable experiences for all people.\n\nStudio Voltaire has step-free access throughout our gallery, event studio, cafe, shop and garden. Accessible toilets and baby change facilities are available on the ground and first floor. All our toilets are self-enclosed and all-gender.\n\nIf you have any questions or need assistance with your visit please contact us on +44 (0) 20 7622 1294 or email info@studiovoltaire.org.\n\nGendered Intelligence, established in 2008, is a registered charity that works to increase understandings of gender diversity and improve the lives of trans people. Their vision is of a world where diverse gender expressions are visible and valued, and where trans, non-binary, gender diverse and gender-questioning people live healthy, safe and fulfilled lives. They are a trans-led and trans-involving grassroots organisation with a wealth of lived experience, community connections of many kinds, and a depth and breadth of trans-community knowledge that is second to none. The team has a variety of professional and academic specialisms and qualifications including training and facilitation, youth work, policy, the arts, and doctorates in trans-related studies."
