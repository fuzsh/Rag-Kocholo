        "text": "Catherine Jones talks to maverick film director John Waters\n\nThere's nothing I like better than to go to a new city,” John Waters smiles, “and to see what the filthy people of Liverpool are like!”\n\nYou can only hope Liverpool is ready for the outspoken, outrageous American auteur. And that he, in turn, is ready for us.\n\n‌\n\n“To me, everything I’ve always read about its reputation is so good,” he enthuses. “But you take away The Beatles, and it’s always kind of ‘it’s gritty’ – all the terms I like, which is why I like Baltimore so much.”\n\nTo prove the point, although he retains homes in New York and San Francisco, and has a ‘summer rental’ on the Cape Cod coast at Provincetown, the 67-year-old remains wedded to the city of his birth.\n\n“I think the boys here look the cutest!” he explains. “And also I think there’s a great sense of humour here. No one is impressed. They say, ‘he couldn’t be that famous, he still lives here’.”\n\n‌\n\nLiverpool Echo Icon\n\nSign up to FREE email alerts from ECHO Daily News\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you’ve consented to and improve our understanding of you.

More info\n\nIt’s clear Mr Waters and Liverpool are going to get along just fine when he arrives next week to take part in Homotopia, the city’s celebration of gay culture which is marking its 10th anniversary in 2013.\n\n“I’ve seen programmes from some of the other years and it looks great,” John says of the festival. “I’m really proud to be part of it. We certainly don’t have anything like that in America, that I know about anyway.\n\n‌\n\n“It’s also all types of stuff, it’s high and low culture.”\n\nSomething for everyone then.\n\n“Yes,” he agrees, “including straight people. I’m against separatism, and I think young people are too.\n\n‌\n\n“I think that this has such a great name to it too, it’s a little bit threatening, which I like!”\n\nTalking of names – and harking back to his opening remark – John’s show at the Philharmonic Hall (his only appearance in the UK this year) is entitled This Filthy World.\n\nIt’s a version of the one-man show he’s toured for a number of years, and that has even been turned into a film. But don’t expect a reprise of the DVD.\n\n‌\n\n“I don’t think any of it is the same,” he says. “I constantly update it and change it, I’m always putting new stuff in.”\n\nThe basic premise however remains the same.\n\n“It’s about how to be happy if you’re a neurotic,” John reveals, “and how to get through life and not worry about being like everybody else.\n\n‌\n\n“I think it’s a little bit changed because these days everybody wants to be an outsider, so I want to be an insider now!\n\n“Whenever you don’t want to be something you end up being it.\n\n“So I think I’ve got good advice for no matter what type of person you are. If you were the most conservative person, or a biker, or a drag queen or a drug addict or whatever.”\n\n‌\n\nThe man William Burroughs called The Pope of Trash was born in Baltimore in 1946, the son of a middle-class Catholic family. One childhood friend would later become his artistic muse – Divine.\n\nWhen he was 16, he was given an 8mm movie camera by his grandmother.\n\nHe says: “It’s 50 years next year since I made my first movie, called Hag in a Black Leather Jacket.”\n\n‌\n\nHis early films were created in and around Baltimore, using a group of local actors who were dubbed the Dreamlanders.\n\nOne of his early movies, Pink Flamingos, remains notorious 40 years on for including a scene where Divine is seen eating dog poo.\n\nNot exactly the advert for Baltimore the city’s founding fathers can have imagined. Or the current ones for that matter.\n\n‌\n\n“All the politicians, of course, hate The Wire which I think is the best show that was ever on television,” John laughs.\n\n“When I was in Tokyo they’d show me maps that had Baltimore and just had where Divine ate dog s***, and where people got murdered, and The Wire. That’s the kind of reputation!\n\n“I made a joke saying the chamber of commerce should put out a bumper sticker that said ‘Come to Baltimore and be shocked’. And they did! They put one out finally, with my name on it, which I thought was great.\n\n‌\n\n“But then people misread it and said ‘really? they’ve put out one that says come to Baltimore and be shot?’\n\n“And I said not shot, SHOCKED!”\n\nOne suspects these days it’s another of his Baltimore-set movies, Hairspray, that is uppermost in most people’s minds.\n\n‌\n\nThe 1988 original, starring Divine as Edna Turnblad (alongside another regular Waters collaborator Rikki Lake as Tracy, and Debbie Harry as Velma von Tussle) was re-made in 2007 with John Travolta, and has spawned an award-winning, über-successful stage musical.\n\nOther perhaps more mainstream movies from the cult director’s canon include Cry Baby, Serial Mom, Pecker and Cecil B Demented.\n\nNot that the film-maker has become THAT mainstream he is keen to point out.\n\n‌\n\nHe says: “My last movie got an NC-17 rating (the nearest UK equivalent would probably by an 18 certificate). It was about sex addicts, so I don’t think I’ve changed that much.”\n\nWhat constitutes then a typical John Waters audience? Who does he expect to see when he looks out from the stage of the Philharmonic Hall next week?\n\n“It’s people that don’t fit in their own minorities,” he suggests. “And not just gay.\n\n‌\n\n“I had a straight guy in the audience at my show in New York recently. He had a girl with him, and he said ‘can I ask you one thing? I’ve never kissed a man, can I kiss you?’\n\n“And he was kinda cute, so I said yeah. He came up and we made out for a second and the audience went crazy and his girlfriend was applauding and he went and sat down.\n\n“But then kind of a scary looking older gay guy said ‘can I?’ and I said ‘no, this isn’t a kissing booth here! We’re stopping it’.”\n\n‌\n\nThe impish Waters adds: “I also feel that sometimes we have enough gay people! I’m against trend-sexual gay people. Like those who pretend they’re lesbians to turn on straight guys.\n\n“I think eventually it’s going to be you have to audition before a team of experienced perverts and be given a gay ID so that you can be accepted.\n\n“I’m for auditioning to be gay now!\n\n‌\n\n“I know some gay people that suddenly got a girlfriend and the gay community attacked them. You’re allowed to ‘come in’ too. I’m for that.\n\n“That’s even more radical today isn’t it?!”\n\nJohn Waters brings This Filthy World to the Philharmonic Hall on November 8 as part of Homotopia."
