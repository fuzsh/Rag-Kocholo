        "text": "Vote with the most vulnerable person you know in mind. Choosing to support a political party that undermines trans lives, even if you align with their other policies, sends a harmful message. It erodes trust with the trans individuals in your life because anti-trans rhetoric should be a non-negotiable stance.\n\nCalling all trans film-makers! Submit your short films exploring a variety of trans lives and experiences worldwide for the Brighton International Trans Film Festival on 19th July: www.filmfreeway.com/BITFF (We were formally known as the Trans Pride Film Event and it's our 11th year running) I'm so proud to have founded this via My Genderation and this year we're kindly supported by Not A Phase Charity, The Foundation by Facial Team and Trans on Screen. Share this with someone who has a film that needs to be seen by hundreds of trans people and allies sitting together, eating popcorn. It's always a really heart-warming and electric atmosphere. Tickets will be announced very soon.\n\nHappy Intergalactic Trans Day of Visibility üè≥Ô∏è‚ößÔ∏è‚ú® Seriously though, trans people have always existed throughout time and always will. This day is always the 31st March - It just happens to fall on the same day as Easter this year. Everyone should feel safe and supported in exploring who they are, at home, in the streets and in the workplace. Sadly this is always the case. Stay safe, stay loved ‚ú® #TDOV #trans #transgender #LGBT #LGBTQIA"
