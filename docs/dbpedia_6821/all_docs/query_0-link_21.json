        "text": "Many large arts organisations already have well-funded and effective education and participation departments, but for smaller arts bodies, taking the leap into developing education and social justice work can be a daunting and difficult prospect. What most don't realise is that it can be one of the most rewarding directions your organisation can take.\n\nHomotopia is Merseyside's first publicly funded LGBT arts and cultural festival. Launched in 2004, it was a key highlight of Liverpool European Capital of Culture 2008 – we produce an annual festival every November and year round participatory and educational projects.\n\nThe festival has become an important event in the city's cultural calendar and one of our core aims is to produce unique and innovative arts and social justice projects that challenge prejudice and unite communities. We work closely with the public and private sectors, and what we do can hopefully inspire other arts organisations to follow suit.\n\nOver the years we have worked on some really amazing projects. Back in 2007 we commissioned artist Paul Harfleet to create his award-winning Pansy Project in a city centre park – the site of a homophobic attack – as a mark of resistance and solidarity against homophobia. This bold partnership with Merseyside Police included uniformed officers planting over 2,000 pansies alongside community volunteers to make a strong statement of their commitment to tackle hate crime.\n\nThen in 2009, working with a coalition of community organisations, we developed Project Triangle to improve young LGBT people's confidence in the police and increase the reporting of hate crime. For the project we recruited our young ambassadors through youth centres in Liverpool and devised a course of workshops, again with Merseyside Police, where they discussed experiences of homophobia and learned how the police's specialist teams could offer help and support.\n\nThe project participants went to Warsaw, Krakow, and Auschwitz with police officers to learn first-hand the effects of the holocaust, hate crime, intolerance and discrimination, and they even met with Polish LGBT youth groups.\n\nThe police are not always a first thought for arts organisations when they commission work or devise new projects, and building this working relationship with the police took several years. It was reliant on committed officers who believed it was important to reach out to minority communities across Merseyside, and as with the projects above, the results can be inspiring.\n\nWe've also worked with housing associations. In 2010 we invited black and ethnic minority, and disabled community groups to work with us on the first ever youth Hate Crime conference in Liverpool and we have subsequently run a conference for 150 staff from 15 social housing associations to address prejudice and hate crime among tenants. Again, it's a relationship lots of arts organisations don't immediately think of.\n\nMost recently we have devised Lavender Days, working with social landlords to bring LGBT performers into sheltered accommodation, and in February this year several housing associations paid for us to stage an afternoon performance with LGBT actors and singers in a city centre theatre. Some of this work was explicitly gay in its content and some was not, but Homotopia reached a much older demographic than we achieve during the festival and over 200 older people had a thoroughly enjoyable afternoon.\n\nThe fit between us and social housing may not seem immediately obvious, but quite apart from the legal responsibilities to their minority tenants (as defined under the Single Equalities Act) it just makes common sense for landlords to address potential sources of conflict on their estates, such as racism and homophobia.\n\nIt's a relationship that works both ways. We worked with their in-house equality and diversity teams to create a relevant agenda for frontline staff who attended the Hate Crime conference, and by taking performers into the sheltered housing schemes we challenged stereotypes and introduced a section of the older generation to our work who might otherwise not knowingly encounter LGBT individuals.\n\nAll this work calibrates our programme in a unique and dynamic way and has allowed Homotopia to connect with hard to reach audiences. Our projects are true catalysts for engagement and social change. We have found the social justice work gives the organisation the chance to make emotional connections that make an impact in the wider community.\n\nIt's also an increasingly effective strategy to connect with both the public and private sector. We have developed relationships with the NUT, Merseyside Police, statutory and voluntary health providers, housing providers, youth services and many other minority community groups who are now ambassadors for our work and use us to train their staff.\n\nThrough our vast digital archive and a bespoke website, Challenge Hate, we can offer our experience and resources for free to new audiences and extend our organisation's profile and reach.\n\nWhat underpins all of our practice is diversity. It is vital that more LGBT cultural representation is seen in theatres, public galleries, schools and museums. Many institutions across the UK still exclude or ignore opportunities to engage in what it means to be gay in the 21st century.\n\nDiversity is something that is at the heart of current arts policy and if arts organisations embrace this it can truly enrich, innovate, transform and reach out to new audiences.\n\nGary Everett, Artistic Director of Homotopia – follow the festival on Twitter @HomotopiaFest"
