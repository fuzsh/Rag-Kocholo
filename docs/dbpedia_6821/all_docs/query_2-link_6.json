Archive, a ground-breaking cultural archive of Black, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans creatives, artists, venues and organisations, Topher comes with a powerful reputation in curating and commissioning work that is urgent and relevant.\n\nAs an award-winning artist he has collaborated with the Mercury Music Prize Winners Young Fathers on FETISH, an art film shot on the streets of New York, which premiered at the Barbican Centre in London, and was Official Selection for the 2018 Aesthetica Short Film Festival and 2018 Scottish Queer International Film Festival and 2021 Sheffield DocFEST.\n\nAs a performer, Topher has appeared in Campbell X’s Stud Life, Ian Poitier’s debut feature Oh Happy Day and Sir Isaac Julien’s Trussed.
