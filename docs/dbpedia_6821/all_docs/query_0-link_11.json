        "text": "The UK’s foremost LGBT arts and culture festival is back in Liverpool this November for it’s 13th year running\n\n“Art is a joyous expression of all that makes us human”\n\nCelebrating the LGBT community and spreading the message of acceptance, the festival that has attracted the likes of Boy George and Hollywood director John Waters in the past, is putting on a colourful programme of events ranging from theatre, dance and film, to photography, cabaret, art and debates about LGBT social issues.\n\nGary Everett, Homotopia’s founder and director explains that the theme of this year’s festival is Forbidden\n\n“In 2016 there are 76 countries where Homosexuality is Illegal. In Tobago, it’s Illegal to enter the country if you are LGBT. Through the years, art has also encountered forbidden qualities with censorship, cultural fashions and tastes and policies of public decency.”\n\n“However, art is a joyous expression of all that makes us human and for lesbians, gays and trans people who continue to be marginalised, criminalised and persecuted around the world, art is often their only means of self-expression. Art is a way for the forbidden to be free. It is a path towards acceptance.”\n\nThis festival seeks out a positive change, with strong political and social messages, but most of all Homotopia is a big shining glitter-ball of creativity and celebration and is set out to entertain and everybody is welcome\n\nSome of the wonderful things that are happening this year:\n\nYou Are Here – a pop-up museum of LGBT heritage being displayed at the Tate Liverpool throughout November – www.thinkingfilm.co.uk\n\nQueercentric – showcasing the best of the UK’s gay music scene, Queercentric will be putting on a handful of super cool bands at Studio 2, Parr St on 17th November – www.homotopia.net\n\nDiva Debate – Jane Czyzselska discusses forbidden lesbian and bi women’s lives from past to the present on 3rd November at the Unity Theatre – http://www.unitytheatreliverpool.co.uk/whats-on/diva-debate\n\nAndrew Fekete: Out of Time – an exhibition by abstract expressionist artist Andrew Fekete featuring his paintings, drawings and diaries will run at the Victoria Gallery and Museum from 18th November until 22nd April 2017- www.andrewfekete.net\n\nLooking For John – a powerful and comedic play which tells the 1976 story of gay Olympic gold-medalist John Curry, runs at the Unity Theatre from 10th – 12th November – http://www.unitytheatreliverpool.co.uk/whats-on/looking-for-john\n\nLittle Misfit – an evening of explosive comedy with hilarious British comedian Zoe Lyons – http://www.unitytheatreliverpool.co.uk/whats-on/zoe-lyons-little-misfit\n\nDavid Hoyle: In the Company of Friends – England’s avant-guardian David Hoyle returns to Homotopia hosting a night of live music, dance and spoken word on 12th November – http://www.unitytheatreliverpool.co.uk/whats-on/david-hoyle-in-the-company-of-friends\n\nRewind Fast Forward – the grand finale of Homotopia’s live performances is Rewind Fast Forward, a free entry party at District on 25th November – with live music, djs and special guest performances, this is a celebration of the work of filmmaker Sandi Hughes.
