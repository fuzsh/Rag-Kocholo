        "text": "Events being hosted by Homotopia this year include theatre shows, workshops, parties and film previews\n\nThe UK’s longest-running LGBTQ+ arts festival is returning to Liverpool.\n\nHomotopia is set to take over the city for three weeks as it celebrates its 20th anniversary - with a focus on queer history and heritage this time around. This year’s festival, themed Gods and Monsters, will see a range of “cutting-edge” entertainment from visual arts to theatre, live music and performances.\n\n‌\n\nFor 2023, Homotopia is asking visitors to consider how to “foster a sense of community and mutual care in the face of an increasingly intolerant society - and how to build a space of love and respect for those within the LGBTQ+ community who are often most demonised within the mainstream”.\n\nREAD MORE: I went to the 'worst place to walk in the country' where people feel unsafe in the dark\n\nREAD MORE: Get a free National Trust pass worth up to £50 for your family day out this autumn\n\n‌\n\nLiverpool Echo Icon\n\nSign up to FREE email alerts from ECHO Daily News\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you’ve consented to and improve our understanding of you.

More info\n\nFestival programmer Alice Holland said: “The opportunity to curate the 20th edition of Homotopia is a huge privilege, and as a newcomer to Liverpool it has been incredible to learn the city through meeting the festival’s networks, audiences and supporters. My hope for this programme is that we find new ways of being together, of being there for each other, and enjoying a glittery, gorgeous giggle before the hibernation season kicks in.\n\n“There will be some festival favourites of course, but we have also tried to open up new spaces for queer work and community, to make the most of Homotopia’s status as a beloved child of the city. I can’t wait to see what the next 20 years of queer culture will look like here.”\n\nHere are all the events happening as the festival celebrates its milestone anniversary.\n\n‌\n\nParties\n\nClash of the Titans: Homotopia Opening Party\n\nSaturday, November 11 - Content, Cain’s Brewery Village - £10/£12.50\n\nA London-based queer cabaret and pro-wrestling night is kicking off this year's festival.
