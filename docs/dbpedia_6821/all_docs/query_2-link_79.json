        "text": "About\n\nSelf-proclaimed future award-winning documentary filmmaker Amy Pennington presents their landmark documentary series TOPS, 2023. The film explores a question that often defines the Trans Masc experience in the UK today – 'What TOP did you wanna wear after TOP surgery?'\n\nIn this profound and intimate film, Amy meets four unique individuals: a powerlifter and gay-games Olympian hopeful; a housing-officer-slash-actor; an Essex filmmaker; and an occasional model and equality diversity and inclusion specialist.\n\nPennington's curiosity illuminates their experiences through unlimited access into their lives, homes and bags of dicks. Insightful and invasive, TOPS allows audiences to fully understand the question on everyone's lips - 'What TOP did you wanna wear after TOP surgery?'.\n\nTOPS is a genre-busting documentary with fictionalised elements inspired by the chaotic, brash, self-deprecating and clueless style of British 1990s and 2000s television. The film is presented by an ever-so-slightly desperate and lonely version of the artist, who is willing to steal footwear and camp out in the gardens of interviewees for ultimate unencumbered access and the potential of their first-ever trans friend.\n\nTOPS gives space to the experience of top surgery, and individuals who have experienced the procedure, without being another sad or gory story. Your nipples might fall off – but you can still have a lol.\n\nThis artwork is co-commissioned by Homotopia, Studio Voltaire and Islington Mill with funding from Arts Council England.\n\nSCREENING 1: 6.30 pm\n\nSCREENING 2: 8 pm\n\nRuntime: 69 mins\n\nTickets: £5 Standard, with pay what you can options\n\nProceeds from ticket sales will be donated to a trans youth charity. Please note, TOPS contains some swearing and references to surgery.\n\nAbout Amy Pennington\n\nAmy Pennington (they/them) is a northerner - they think it’s important you know that. They make films, performances and collaborative projects about class, sexuality and gender. Amy has made art with their family, residents in a care home and clients at a queer hair salon. They like wearing wigs and telling stories. Their work challenges who gets to express themselves, share their experiences and under what terms. Growing up, TV was their best teacher, so using humour and pop culture come naturally. They employ these tools to gently pull at the seams of what is ‘acceptable’ or ‘normal’, whether that is critiquing the health and wellbeing industry, what kinds of Trans stories are told, or who we imagine our queer ancestors to be.\n\nAmy has made work within institutions as well as self-organised groups and in the public realm. They have been commissioned by TATE Liverpool, Battersea Art Centre, Studio Voltaire, PEER Gallery, In-situ, QUAD, Heart Of Glass, Left Coast, Homotopia, The National Festival of Making, Newlyn Gallery and LADA.\n\nTheir films have been shown in a number of film festivals including Leeds international, GAZE, Queer Fringe! Filmpride Brighton & Hove. Where’s Danny? won the Iris Prize Community Award 2023. They were a finalist in screenshot 2023 a competition for comedy writer-performers hosted by Sister Pictures and South of the River Pictures.\n\nFilm credits\n\nDirector, Writer, Editor, Executive Producer: Amy Pennington\n\nCo-Director, DOP and A Cam Operator: Jos Bitelli\n\nInterviewees: Maz Murray, Yaz Senghor, Elliot Davis, Oskar Marchock\n\nEditors: Amy Pennington, Jos Bitelli, Jessica Crooks, Noemi Varga\n\nProducers: The Uncultured - Ash Bowmott and Laura Sweeney\n\nMusic: Rubie\n\nB Cam Operator: Tilly Garland (Episode Maz)\n\nB Cam Operator: Samara Addai (Episodes Yaz, Elliot, Oskar)\n\nCamera assistant: Rowan Needham (Episode Yaz)\n\nSound: Toby Burroughs (Episode Maz)\n\nSound: Felix Waverley-Hudson (Episodes Yaz, Elliot, Oskar)\n\nCostumes: Jordan Taylor +Threadmaidens\n\nGraphics: Alex Lundström\n\nProduction assistant: Roshana Rubin Mayhew\n\nEquipment and support: Grey Moth\n\nAccess Consultant: Abi Palmer\n\nAccess\n\nThis film is subtitled, This event is seated.
