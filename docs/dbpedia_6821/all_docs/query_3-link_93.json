        "text": "Vampyr (1932): Live Score + Film\n\nContemporary Electronic Live Score from Sound Artist kraftwitch\n\nSunday, October 9, 2022 | 7pm (Doors), 7:30-9pm (Screening) | At Vox\n\n$10 Suggested Donation\n\n“One of the greatest horror films of all time.” – The New York Times\n\nOn Sunday, October 9th, at 7:30pm, Carl Theodor Dreyer’s silent film masterpiece Vampyr (1932) will be screened at Vox Populi with a contemporary electronic live score from sound artist kraftwitch (John Moletress) utilizing semi-modular and modular synths, and effects pedals. Doors open at 7pm!\n\n“With Vampyr, Danish filmmaker Carl Theodor Dreyer channeled his genius for creating mesmerizing atmosphere and austere, unsettling imagery into the horror genre. The result—a chilling film about a student of the occult who encounters supernatural haunts and local evildoers in a village outside of Paris—is nearly unclassifiable. A host of stunning camera and editing tricks and densely layered sounds create a mood of dreamlike terror. With its roiling fogs, ominous scythes, and foreboding echoes, Vampyr is one of cinema’s great nightmares.” – Criterion\n\nAbout the Artist\n\nJohn Moletress is a multi-disciplinary artist, educator and Founding Director of force/collision, an interdisciplinary performance ensemble.

Kennedy Center, Abrons Art Center, Basilica Hudson, Queer Biennial LA, Cathedral of Saint Vibiana, La MaMa ETC, Highways Performance Space, Intersections Festival, Fusebox Festival, Arena Stage, New Dramatists, Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company, Studio Theatre, FUNDarte/Out In The Tropics, OUTsider Festival, George Washington University, EMP Collective, Time Space LTD., to name a few.\n\nInternationally, their work has been seen at Trans-States (UK), Shout Festival (UK), King’s College London, Homotopia/unity theatre (UK), Warehouse 9 (DK), The Gulbenkian (UK) and The House at Plymouth University (UK).
