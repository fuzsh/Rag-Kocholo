Lee. “I invite Tennesseans to celebrate at events throughout the year from Mountain City to Memphis and to share the stories of the people, places and moments that have shaped Tennessee.”\n\nIn “Home,” Dolly Parton sings the title track of her 1973 album “My Tennessee Mountain Home,” while main streets, landmarks and natural scenery highlight Tennessee’s culture and beauty across every part of the state.\n\n\"I am Tennessee proud. I'm proud of our wonderful state, proud to be a born and raised Tennessee girl and I'm proud to be a part of all that we represent.\" -Dolly Parton\n\nGov. Lee will kick off Tennessee’s yearlong celebration and 95-county tour in historic Jonesborough on June 1, 2021, Tennessee’s 225th birthday, and will visit each grand division the first week of June, including stops in Knoxville, Nashville and Memphis."
