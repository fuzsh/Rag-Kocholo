        "text": "About Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library\n\nDolly Parton’s Imagination Library is a book gifting program that mails free, high-quality books to children from birth to age five, no matter their family’s income.\n\nAfter launching in 1995, the program grew quickly. First books were only distributed to children living in Sevier County, Tennessee where Dolly grew up. It became such a success that in 2000 a national replication effort was underway. By 2003, Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library had mailed one million books. It would prove to be the first of many millions of books sent to children around the world.\n\nIn 2023, United Way of Payne County and Stillwater Public Library partnered to bring the program to Payne County. More than 1,500 children received books in 2023.\n\nDonate below to keep and grow this program in Payne County.\n\nIt's the perfect gift! Donate to United Way in honor or in memory of someone you love! To make a gift in someone name, tell us on the donation form!"
