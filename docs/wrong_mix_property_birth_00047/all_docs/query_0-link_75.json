We are superstars, dirt-poor mountain folks bootlegging to support their families, law enforcement, and even commercial & military pilots (that’s me!) Shine Girl Moonshine gives a smooth finish making every day a little better. Enjoy a glass (or two... we don't judge....or count) of my Family Heritage and unwind today.\n\nMy goal for Shine Girl is to create a line of spirits created by and with women in mind. I have a theory, if women will drink it, men will buy it!\n\nHave you ever had a shot, or even a sip, of a whiskey that was a throat scorcher that made you want to vomit, cry, and do a weird dance just to get you through it? It's kinda like what a divorce is like. Me too.\n\nI'm Danielle, a combat veteran, pilot, and I like to relax and unwind from life without worrying about a throat scorcher so I created Shine Girl."
