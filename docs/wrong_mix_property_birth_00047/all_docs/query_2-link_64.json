        "text": "Dolly Parton‘s home is just what you’d expect! She lives outside of Nashville, Tennessee, with her longtime husband, Carl Dean, in a 3,324-square-foot mansion. The decades-long couple bought their Brentwood home for $400,000 in 1999, and they love it so much that they have yet to put it on the market.\n\nWith more than 10 structures built around the home, it’s pretty clear why they adore their property so much. According to the Kiwi Report, the “Jolene” singer and the businessman have a tennis court on their estate, as well as a swimming pool, a chapel and tons of gazebos. Dolly has so much land around her residence that she built a couple of barns too.\n\n“We have a farm, and [Carl is] more than happy keeping the fields mowed, the barns painted and working away on his farm equipment,” she told The Mirror in December 2019. Since Carl doesn’t like the spotlight as much as his wife, he normally tends to stay inside on the property.\n\n“Listen, he’s a homebody and doesn’t like to go out in public,” Dolly explained. “He doesn’t particularly care about being around anybody but me. He’s just always asked me to leave him out of all this. He does not like all the hullabaloo.”\n\nIf the Nashville native does decide to leave his house, though, he’ll have to pass by the big iron gates, which sit at the end of their driveway. From there, you can see the large American flag they have waving in front of their home.\n\nConsidering the 9 to 5 actress and Carl have such an attachment to their longtime abode, Dolly didn’t mind being cooped up amid the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. In fact, the Grammy winner was “grateful” she was “able to spend more time with Carl” in lockdown, a source exclusively told Closer in July.\n\nDolly looked forward to “traveling more for work now that things have opened up,” but she realized how much she truly loved being home with Carl. “She’s cutting back as much as she can,” the insider dished.\n\nThough Dolly and her hubby’s mansion couldn’t seem more impressive, the lovebirds have owned other fabulous properties in the past. In 2017, they listed their Glencliff home in Nashville for $1.2 million. The place was so luxurious, coming equipped with four bedrooms, three bathrooms, an eat-in kitchen, walk-in closets, four-car garages, a guest unit and more."
