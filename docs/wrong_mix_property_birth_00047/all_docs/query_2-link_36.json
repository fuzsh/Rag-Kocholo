        "text": "PIGEON FORGE, Tenn. (WVLT) - The new Dolly Parton experience is open and Dolly Parton spent the weekend at Dollywood to welcoming guests.\n\nThe Dolly Parton Experience was a multi-year project to tell the Dolly Parton story from her roots in East Tennessee to becoming a world-wide icon.\n\nDolly’s niece Rebecca Seaver works as the curator of Dolly’s museum. The Dolly Parton Experience was a project near and dear to her heart.\n\n“It was a dream I had a few years ago with dolly’s creative director Steve (Summers) to really up this area and bring chasing rainbows into the modern era,” said Seaver.\n\nDolly never wears the same thing twice, once she takes it off, it goes to Rebecca, who archives the pieces.\n\n“To be able to take care of that is such a beautiful and humbling experience and to be able to bring it and showcase it to her fans and people that love her at Dollywood everyday is just so special and sweet,” she added.\n\nThe experience also takes you from Dolly’s childhood roots on locust ridge to becoming a star the people she’s met, the songs and clothes along the way.\n\n“Some of the clothes, whether it be the albums or other occasions, but we also have some beautiful gowns and things that I’ve warn that people love to see that the glamor part of it, but there’s going to be a lot of wonderful things that people are going to get a chance to see,” said Dolly Parton. “We can always keep it new and exciting where people don’t get tired of the same things over and over, which that is something we did not have in our other museum. So this is going to be a fun, it’s almost like a living thing so things can change and things can happen and stay more interesting.”\n\nDolly’s designer, Steve Summers, said it all starts with inspiration. Inside ‘Behind the Seams’ you can see what it looks like inside Dolly’s design shop.\n\n“These are all real things, this is all the real stuff, they basically came over and took this stuff out of my office and she said do you need more of that, I said well I can get more. But this is real, this is what it looks like,” said Summers, Creative Director Dolly Parton Enterprises\n\nThe Dolly Parton Experience now spans three buildings.\n\n“Now we’ve spread out into three different buildings plus the bus, so this kind of works like a campus museum now days. So, the ‘Songteller’ portion is all about Dolly’s life story from growing up here in the Great Smokies to her iconic career,” said Cyndi McCormack, Dolly Parton Experience Creative Director.\n\nThe whole thing is heartfelt for Seaver who is honored to tell the family story.\n\n“It’s sweet, she loves her family and everybody has family so it’s just an exciting thing that she’s mine and I’m very protective of her and that bond and because it’s not that I’m related to her as a person and the famous part is a little different, but it’s two sides to the same coin,” said Seaver.\n\nAs part of the new experience Dolly’s songwriting is part in the new family show, Heidi Parton’s Kin & Friends. Performances are daily in the Dreamsong Theater at Dollywood."
