        "text": "www.dollymania.net News September 2014\n\nSept. 30:\n\n'Blue Smoke' Sold Another 6,000 In U.K. Last Week\n\nDolly's Blue Smoke sold about 6,000 units overseas last week to bring its cumulative British sales in 16 weeks of release to about 208,000 copies.\n\nDolly Drag For A Good Cause\n\nA Murfreesboro, Tenn., charity that helps adults with intellectual disabilities has a unique contest fundraiser, having had a local well-known person dress up in drag as Dolly and residents pay to guess who it is. Check out a story from the Daily News Journal about the Journeys In Community Living contest here.\n\nMore Imagination Library Tennessee Anniversary News\n\nThe president of the Governor's Books from Birth Foundation in Tennessee is lauding the 10th anniversary of Dolly's Imagination Library going statewide in her native Tennessee and the 20 million books distributed over that time in the state with an opinion piece in The Tennessean here.\n\n'9 To 5' Gets Irish 'X Factor' Contestant Sent Home\n\nDolly's \"9 To 5\" may have been good to a quartet on X Factor U.K. over the weekend, but it wasn't for a contestant on X Factor Ireland, with Ben Quinlan asked by judges to stop singing well before the song was even over. Read about his ordeal here or watch it on YouTube here.\n\nRCA A Group Uses Dolly Picture In Fight\n\nThe group working to preserve RCA's former Studio A recording studio, where Dolly recorded \"Jolene,\" have taken the Dolly connection one step further in their campaign, issuing a press release that uses a vintage Dolly picture (below; image courtesy PRNewsPhoto/Save Studio A) as its illustration. Learn more at Save Studio A.com.\n\nSept. 29:\n\nDolly's Former Recording Studio Is No More\n\nFireside, the recording studio Dolly and Porter Wagoner built in 1972, was recently demolished to make way for a new 153-unit apartment complex that will cover several parcels along 18th Avenue South in Nashville. The revelation came in a New York Times article over the weekend here that focused on the controversy surrounding a similar fate planned for RCA Studio A, opponents of which are using the fact that Dolly recorded \"Jolene\" in that RCA studio as an example of the history being lost by the former RCA facility's planned renovation into luxury condominiums. The story starts with an advocate for the studio playing Dolly's iconic 1973 recording and the piece also uses a picture of the track listing sheet from the day of the recording (during which, it shows, she also recorded \"Bubbling Over\") as an illustration for the story. Buried within its text is a note that Fireside, which it calls \"a studio once owned by Porter Wagoner, Ms. Parton's frequent duet partner,\" was recently razed (although the link embedded in that line of the story references a different building on another street being torn down for a different project, but a story on the development, which doesn't mention any history on the building, appeared in July 2013's Nashville Post here). The studio, which was originally co-owned by Porter and Dolly, was built using several construction workers from Dolly's own family and opened in 1973. It also housed their jointly-owned publishing company, Owepar, in addition to the offices of Dolly Parton Enterprises and Porter Wagoner Enterprises. Although Dolly apparently never recorded there, she and Porter continued to co-own it after the break-up of their duet partnership until he turned over his share of Owepar to her and she turned over her share of the studio ownership to him in 1979 as part of the $1 million settlement of his breach-of-contract lawsuit against her. Porter continued to operate it for several years, eventually selling it, although it remained an active studio into the early 2010s. It closed around late 2012 and its equipment was sold to other studios in early 2013. The property sold last year to the investors planning the development, and a demolition permit was issued in late July 2013.\n\nBritish, Aussie, GAC Charts Updated\n\nAlthough mid-week sales updates indicated Dolly's Blue Smoke was on track in this week's U.K. charts to dip five spots to No. 19, it only loses two places to No. 16 in its 16th week of sales in the Britain, Sunday's charts show. In addition, The Very Best Of Dolly Parton, Volume 1 falls back off the British 100 pop albums chart overseas, down from No. 87. Smoke retains its top position on the country compilations chart for a 16th week in a row, where her Ultimate inches down one to No. 20, Emmylou Harris's Original Album Series, Volume 2 (featuring one track with Dolly harmony and two tracks with Trio harmony by Dolly and Linda Ronstadt) gains two to No. 9 and Harris's Original Album Series, Volume 1 (with two Dolly covers, one track with Dolly harmony and one track with Trio harmony) inches up one to No. 14 on that list. The four-CD Sony Dolly boxed set drops off the top 20 country albums tally after one week at No. 15 following its re-issue overseas.

She said someone told her she singlehandedly invented the Americana genre when she released her first two solo albums in 1973 and 1974, adding that she \"was the first person\" other than Dolly to ever record a Dolly song (\"My Tennessee Mountain Home\" appeared on her 1973 collection Maria Muldaur). Not true. Dolly was a successful songwriter before she ever had a hit herself, writing for dozens of other artists during a three-year period of 1965 to 1967. Even after she was a country star herself, she continued to be a source of composition for others. In 1971 and 1972, the two years before Muldaur's solo debut release came out, Dolly covers were released by many singers including R&B star Margie Joseph, the duo of Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood, Conway Twitty, Porter Wagoner, Jeanne Pruett, and Goldie Hawn (yes, Goldie Hawn put out a country album) in addition to an entire album by Skeeter Davis in 1972: Skeeter Sings Dolly..

In an interview here, she replied when asked about a time she was starstruck: \"Oh my goodness, Dolly Parton!! It was years ago, I love Dolly Parton and I didn't know what to say and I didn't know what to do.\"\n\nSept. 23:\n\n'Blue Smoke' British Version Passes 200,000 In Sales\n\nAlthough it slipped one more spot on the British pop albums chart Sunday to No. 14, Dolly's Blue Smoke sold another 6,000 units last week to pass the 200,000-copy mark in the U.K. in just 15 weeks of sales to total 202,000 since release overseas.\n\nKenny's Dolly Comments Highlight AXS Interview\n\nKenny Rogers's episode of The Big Interview with Dan Rather premieres this week on AXS, and People magazine on Monday posted an online story based on his comments about Dolly and their relationship, a clip of which is viewable below.

The four-CD Sony Dolly boxed set, re-issued overseas last week, debuts at No. 15 on the British country albums chart, even though it is without a doubt a compilation. Down Under, The Very Best Of Dolly Parton, Volume 1 re-enters the top 40 Australian country albums chart at No. 39 for a 345th chart week since its 2007 release. Stateside, the music video for Dolly's \"Home\" from her Blue Smoke continues its march back up the Great American Country (GAC) top 20 countdown, re-entering the top 10 at No. 8 in its 13th chart week.

In related news, mid-week British sales updates indicate her Blue Smoke is down three places to No. 16 pop in its 16th week of sales overseas, although in past weeks it usually hasn't fallen as far as the mid-week charts indicated it would when the final charts representing the full week's sales are released on Sunday.\n\nDolly's Library Gets Its Own Corn Maze\n\nDolly's Imagination Library and its 10th anniversary of being available statewide in Tennessee are being celebrated by Mayfield Farm in its annual corn maze in McMinn County, Tenn.

The album has remained in the U.K. pop top 10 for the entire 12 weeks of its release overseas.\n\nSept. 2:\n\n'Blue Smoke' Passes 180,000 Copies In Britain\n\nDolly's slide from No. 7 to No. 10 on this week's U.K. pop albums chart with Blue Smoke was due to the sale of 7,738 copies the previous week, bringing the CD's cumulative sales over 12 weeks of release overseas to 183,899 units.\n\nDon't Forget New York's Dollypalooza\n\nThe Brooklyn Paper on Monday reminded folks to head out to Littlefield in Gowanus on Friday night for Dollypalooza. Read more about the Dolly tribute concert here.\n\nSept. 1:\n\nDolly Safe In U.K. Top 10 This Week\n\nDolly managed to stay in the British top 10 pop albums this week even though, as was reported here, mid-week sales tallies indicated she would likely drop to No. 11 for the week. Instead, her Blue Smoke dips three places to No. 10 pop in its 12th week of sales across the pond, also maintaining its No. 1 position on the U.K. country compilations chart. Also on the compilations list, her Ultimate re-enters the top 20 at No. 13, Emmylou Harris's Original Album Series, Volume 2 (featuring one track with Dolly harmony and two tracks with Trio harmony by Dolly and Linda Ronstadt) rises four to No. 10 and Harris's Original Album Series, Volume 1 (with two Dolly covers, one track with Dolly harmony and one track with Trio harmony) slips six to No. 15 on that list. Down Under, The Very Best Of Dolly Parton, Volume 1 falls out of the top 40 Australian country albums chart, down from No. 39 in its 344th week, while her The Box Set Series also falls out of the top 40, down from No. 40. In Ireland, The Real Dolly Parton re-enters the top 100 pop albums chart at No. 53. And in the U.S., Dolly's music video for \"Home\" from Blue Smoke falls three more spots to No. 18 on the Great American Country (GAC) top 20 countdown in its 10th chart week there.
