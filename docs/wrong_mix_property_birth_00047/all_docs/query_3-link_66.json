        "text": "I enjoyed volunteering at the Nashville booth during CMA Fest Fan Fair at the Music City Center. It was a fantastic experience meeting country music fans from all corners of the globe. Looking forward to being back at the Nashville booth on Friday! üåü #CMAFest #visitmusiccity #Nashville\n\nThank you, Oracle, for your continued investment in Nashville's growth and economic development. Let's go! Oracle Corp. Chairman and Co-Founder Larry Ellison has announced that Oracle's world headquarters will be moving to Nashville, Tennessee. The announcement was made during an on-stage interview at a health care industry summit hosted by Oracle in Nashville. This comes after Ellison delivered the largest economic development deal in Nashville's history, creating 8,500 jobs by 2031 on a $1.35 billion, 70-acre campus on the East Bank. According to Ellison, the new location will be \"the center of our future.\"\n\nGiddy up! The Nashville region once again boasts the lowest unemployment rate among the nation's largest metro areas. The Nashville metro area clocked in at 2.2% unemployment in February, according to preliminary data released April 3 by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The rate is half a percentage point lower than a year ago, and also the smallest among the 50-plus metro areas with more than 1 million residents.\n\nSo much fun volunteering as a #visitmusiccity ambassador for #abanashville. This city has so much to offer all travelers and locals! Shout-out to Dana Romanello, RCA Studio B, Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum and the incomparable Ryman Auditorium for hosting our ‚ÄúStories Behind the Songs‚Äù tour with the ABA attendees. It wasn‚Äôt on my bingo card that we would be singing and recording the Elvis hit ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Help Falling in Love‚Äù in the same Studio B where he recorded the classic. #visitmusiccity #nashville #tourismindustry #giddyup"
