The company says the property is occupied by an 11-story tower built in 2000 that is currently home to office, retail and restaurant space.\n\nCBRE reports the seller recently made $16 million improvements to the property, including a new conference center, fitness center, as well as renovations to the lobby, indoor/outdoor tenant lounge, elevators, outdoor plaza and exterior.\n\nThe Dollywood Company says terms of the sale will not be disclosed and plans for the future of 211 Commerce will be shared as they materialize."
