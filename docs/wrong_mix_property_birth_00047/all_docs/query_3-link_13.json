Although Parton and her company did not confirm what she plans to do with the building, numerous news sources claim she and her company plan to convert the 11-story office building into a hotel.\n\nNearly 40 years ago, Parton first opened her massive entertainment district, Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, which now includes two hotels, a water park and a theme park.\n\nParton opened one hotel in Tennessee this year. Last month, HeartSong Lodge & Resort, Dollywood’s second resort, opened its doors.\n\nThe Nashville Business Journal reports that Parton told the crowd at her latest hotel dedication, “Some people are calling me a hotelier now,” and said that more Dollywood hotels are in the works.\n\nShe is also planning to open a new museum called The Dolly Parton Experience in spring 2024 in her Pigeon Forge theme park."
