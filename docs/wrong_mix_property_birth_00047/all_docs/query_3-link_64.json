        "text": "Books are paid for by a variety of donations from foundations, corporations, grants and donors like you!\n\nKnox County Imagination Library is administered through Knox County Public Library. Our local Board of Advisors raises funds for half the cost of books and mailing ($250,000 annually), promotes the program and registers children.\n\nThe Governor's Early Literacy Foundation covers the other half of books and mailing in all 95 Tennessee counties, and it serves local organizers by providing fundraising, public relations, and other support.\n\nThe Dollywood Foundation manages operational details of the program in over 1,200 communities, including book selection for the Library, price negotiation, and distribution logistics.\n\nDolly Parton knows that reading to young children is the best way to prepare them for school and for life. That's why she started the Imagination Library. In 1996, she began sending books in the mail to the young children of Sevier County regardless of their family's income. Since then, she and The Governor's Books from Birth Foundation have expanded the program to the entire state of Tennessee. In Knox County, we're very proud that more than 19,000 children look forward to receiving their book every month. That's 73% of eligible children in Knox County!\n\nStep 1: Register\n\nParents/guardians can register each child under age five in their household. Registering online is the easiest and quickest way to enroll, or you may complete a paper registration form and return it by mail Forms are available for download in English or Spanish. You can also register at any Knox County Public Library location, or by calling 865-215-8743.\n\nStep 2. Read\n\nReading with your child every day is one of the best ways to prepare him for success in school and in life. Your child's first book will arrive in 8-10 weeks. After the initial wait, your child will receive one book every month until he or she turns 5!\n\nStep 3: Keep Your Address UpdatedParents must update their address each time they move. Books are not forwarded automatically by the post office. To update your address, use the Parent Login link on the Imagination Library website. You can also call 865-215-8743 or email imaglib@knoxlib.org to keep us posted with your most up-to-date contact information.\n\nStudies show the impact that early exposure to books has on brain development. Through books, children learn about the world around them, shapes and colors, and letter recognition. They also learn to use their imaginations and to form stories and narratives that help them make sense of their young lives. But maybe the most important thing they learn while reading with their parents or caretakers is that they are valued and loved. When a child is read to, there’s a lot more going on than the important task of learning. Quiet time with a loved one creates a sense of belonging that lasts forever.\n\nThe Governor’s Books from Birth Foundation authored a comprehensive analysis of Dolly Parton's Imagination Library in Tennessee. Three themes that emerged from the report were:\n\n1) Children’s excitement upon receiving books\n\n2) Expanded home literacy practices\n\n3) Positive changes in the way parents spent time with their children\n\nRead the study here:\n\nGovernor's Books from Birth Foundation's Impact Analysis of Dolly Parton's Imagination Library in Tennessee"
