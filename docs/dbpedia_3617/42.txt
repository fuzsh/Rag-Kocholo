Known as Marie Anne Victoire in France she was ignored by her husband and the king's court being described as dull and unattractive and died closeted away in her apartments after claiming constant illness which more often than not was dismissed as attention seeking. After her death her body was examined and it was concluded that she was in fact suffering from numerous illnesses and had not been seeking attention. While at court she formed a close bond with her distant cousin Elisabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate who was also German. She was buried within the Royal Basilica of Saint Denis outside Paris. Her widower husband married Mademoiselle de Choin in secret. Her second son the Duke of Anjou founded the Bourbons of Spain who still rule to this day. Her eldest surviving granddaughter Mariana Victoria of Spain ewas named in her honour.
