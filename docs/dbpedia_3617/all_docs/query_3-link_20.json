        "text": "Louis' patriline is the line from which he is descended father to son.\n\nPatrilineal descent is the principle behind membership in royal houses, as it can be traced back through the generations - which means that if Duke Louis were to choose an historically accurate house name it would be Robertian, as all his male-line ancestors have been of that house.\n\nLouis is a member of the House of Bourbon, a branch of the Capetian dynasty and of the Robertians.\n\nLouis' patriline is the line from which he is descended father to son. It follows the Kings of France and the Counts of Paris and Worms. This line can be traced back more than 1,200 years to the present day, through Kings of France & Navarre, Spain and Two-Sicilies, Dukes of Parma and Grand-Dukes of Luxembourg, Princes of Orléans and Emperors of Brazil. It is one of the oldest in Europe."
