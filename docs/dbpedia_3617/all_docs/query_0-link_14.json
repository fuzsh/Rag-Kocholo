        "text": "Louis, Dauphin of France (November 1, 1661 – April 14, 1711), commonly known as le Grand Dauphin, was the eldest son and heir apparent of King Louis XIV of France and Navarre and his spouse, Infanta Maria Theresa of Spain and Portugal and she was also an Archduchess of Austria as a member of the Spanish branch of the House of Habsburg.\n\nInfanta Maria Theresa of Spain and Portugal was the daughter of King Felipe IV of Spain and Portugal and Elisabeth of France, the eldest daughter of King Henri IV of France and Navarre and his second wife, Marie de’ Medici.\n\nLouis parents, King Louis XIV and Infanta Maria Theresa of Spain were double first-cousins to each other. Louis was born at the Château de Fontainebleau.\n\nAs a Fils de France (“Son of France”) Louis was entitled to the style of Royal Highness. He was baptised on March 24, 1662 at the chapel of the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye and given his father’s name of Louis.\n\nAt the ceremony, the Cardinal de Vendôme and the Princess of Conti acted as proxies for the godparents, Pope Clement IX and Queen Henrietta Maria of England. The latter was Louis’s great-aunt, a younger daughter of King Henri IV of France and Navarre and his second wife, Marie de’ Medici.\n\nLouis, Dauphin of France became known as the Grand Dauphin after the birth of his own son, Louis, Duke of Burgundy, the Petit Dauphin. He and his son died before his father and thus never became kings. Instead, his grandson became King Louis XV at the death of Louis XIV, and his second son inherited the Spanish throne as Felipe V through his grandmother.\n\nLouis’ generosity, affability, and liberality gave him great popularity in Paris and with the French people in general. Louis was one of six legitimate children of his parents. The others all died in early childhood; the second longest-lived, Princess Marie Thérèse of France, died at the age of five when Louis was 11.\n\nFor marriage King Louis XIV considered various European Royal daughters as possible wives for his heir, such as his cousin Anna Maria Luisa de’ Medici the only daughter of Cosimo III de’ Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Princess Marguerite Louise d’Orléans, a niece of Louis XIII of France and the eldest child of Gaston of France, Duke of Orléans, and of his second wife, Marguerite of Lorraine.\n\nAnother cousin that was suggested was Princess Marie Louise d’Orléans, daughter of Louis XIV ‘s brother, Prince Philippe I, Duke of Orléans and Henrietta of England the daughter of King Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland and Princess Henrietta Maria de Bourbon of France daughter of King Henri IV of France and Navarre and his second wife, Marie de’ Medici.\n\nAccording to various sources, Marie Louise and Louis were in love and had grown up with each other. However, Louis XIV decided to use Marie Louise to instead forge a link with Spain and made her to marry the invalid King Carlos II of Spain, the Dauphin’s half-uncle.\n\nKing Carlos II was the only surviving son of King Felipe IV of Spain and Archduchess Mariana of Austria, who were uncle and niece. Archduchess Mariana of Austria was the daughter of King Felipe III of Spain and Archduchess Margaret of Austria who was the daughter of Archduke Charles II of Further Austria and Maria Anna of Bavaria.\n\nWhile European nobility commonly married within the same extended family to retain property, the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs were unusual in the extent to which they followed this policy. One suggestion is this policy may have been partially driven by Spanish limpieza de sangre or “blood purity” statutes enacted in the early 16th century, which remained in use until the 1860s.\n\nThe intense inbreeding of King Carlos II of Spain would cause repercussions in the War of the Spanish Succession that would impact both Louis XIV and his son Louis, le Grand Dauphin.\n\nLouis was eventually engaged to his second cousin, Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria, when he was seven. Maria Anna was the eldest daughter of Ferdinand Maria, Elector of Bavaria and his wife Princess Henriette Adelaide of Savoy. Her maternal grandparents were Victor Amadeus I, Duke of Savoy and Christine Marie of France, the second daughter of Henry IV of France and Marie de’ Medici, thus her husband the dauphin was her second cousin.\n\nMaria Anna Victoria was a year older than Louis and, upon arriving at the French court, was described as being very unattractive. Nonetheless, she was a very cultured princess, and made a good first impression as she was able to speak French fluently.\n\nThey were married by proxy in Munich on January 28, 1680; the couple met for the first time on March 7, 1680 in Châlons-sur-Marne.\n\nAlthough the marriage was not a close one, the couple had three sons. The Dauphine died in 1690 and in 1695 Louis secretly married his lover Marie Émilie de Joly de Choin. His new wife did not acquire the status of Dauphine of France, and the marriage remained without surviving issue. Pregnant at the time of her marriage, de Choin gave birth to a son, who was secretly sent to the countryside; the child died aged two, in 1697, without having been publicly named.\n\nIssue\n\n1. Louis, Duke of Burgundy (1682 – 1712), Duke of Burgundy and later Dauphin of France; married his double-second-cousin, Marie Adélaïde of Savoy elder daughter of Victor Amadeus II, Duke of Savoy, and Princess Anne Marie d’Orléans, daughter of Philippe I, Duke of Orléans, younger brother of King Louis XIV, and Henrietta Anne of England, the youngest daughter of Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland and Princess Henrietta Maria de Bourbon of France. Louis, Duke of Burgundy was the father of the future Louis XV of France.\n\n2. Philippe, Duke of Anjou [Felipe V, King of Spain] (1683 – 1746) married firstly his double-second-cousin, Maria Luisa of Savoy, younger daughter of Victor Amadeus II of Savoy, King of Sardinia and his wife Anne Marie d’Orléans the daughter of Philippe I, Duke of Orléans, younger brother of Louis XIV, and Henrietta Anne of England, the youngest daughter of Charles I of England. Had issue; married secondly Elisabeth Farnese and had issue including the future Dauphine of France, Infanta Maria Teresa Rafaela of Spain.\n\n3. Charles, Duke of Berry (1686 – 1714), Duke of Berry, of Alençon and of Angoulême, Count of Ponthieu; married Marie Louise Élisabeth d’Orléans and had issue but none survived over a year. Marie Louise Élisabeth d’Orléans was the eldest surviving child to Philippe II, Duke of Orléans and his wife Françoise Marie de Bourbon, a legitimised daughter of King Louis XIV of France.\n\nThus, through his two older sons Burgundy and Anjou, Louis ensured respectively the continuation of the senior Bourbon line on the throne of France and the establishment of the Spanish Bourbon dynasty.\n\nLouis’s position in the Conseil d’en haut gave him an opportunity to have his voice heard in the years and in the crises leading up to the War of the Spanish Succession.\n\nFrom his mother, Louis had rights and claims to the Spanish throne. His uncle King Carlos II of Spain had produced no descendants and, as he lay dying, had no heir to whom he could pass the throne. The choice of a successor was essentially split between the French and Austrian claimants. The Austrian claimant was Archduke Charles of Austria future Emperor Charles VI.\n\nTo improve the chances of a Bourbon succession, Louis gave up his and his eldest son’s rights in favour of his second son, Philippe, Duke of Anjou (later Felipe V of Spain), who, as the second son, was not expected to succeed to the French throne, which would thus keep France and Spain separate.\n\nMoreover, in the discussions in the Conseil d’en haut regarding the French response to Carlos II’s last will and testament, which indeed left all Spanish possessions to Prince Philippe of Anjou, Louis persuasively argued for acceptance. He opposed those who advocated a rejection of the will and the adherence to the Partition Treaty, which was signed with King William III of England, even though the treaty had awarded Naples, Sicily and Tuscany to him."
