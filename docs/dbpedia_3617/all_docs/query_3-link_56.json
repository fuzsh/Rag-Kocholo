        "text": "CHAPTER EIGHT\n\nWife, Mother, Friend\n\nBoneur, bon temps, trés agreeable année, Vray reconfort de ce que plus vous blece, Plaisir, soulas, vous doint ceste journée Et les autres plus en plus vous eslece, Toudis accroisse et garde vo haultece, Vostre valeur et vo trés noble faame, Et vous envoit joye qui ja ne cesse, Ce jour de l’an, ma redoubtée dame.\n\n[May this day give you good fortune, good times, a very happy year, true comfort for that which most hurts you, pleasure, solace, and may many more make you happy; may your excellence, value and fame grow and remain every day, and may this New Year’s day bring you joy without cease, my great lady.]\n\nHISTORIANS OF THE PAST have waged personal attacks against the queen: that she was scheming, promiscuous, greedy, neglectful of her children, hungry for power, lacking in intelligence. She has been treated as an allegorical figure of luxuria, fleshly and obese. While no one can offer substantive information about the character of a woman who lived over six hundred years ago, I hope in this final chapter to at least mitigate some of these negative impressions by offering alternatives to counter them. Approaching the evidence without the negative assumptions that so often exist about the queen, I reconsider contemporary traces of her to ask what sort of person these traces might reveal.\n\nWife\n\nMany of the old myths about the relationship between Isabeau and Charles have already been rebutted: that she led him into a life of extravagant feasting and cavorting, that she kept him impoverished after his insanity set in, that she betrayed him with different lovers.1 But will the records permit anything more than the denial of certain elements of the black legend for lack of evidence? In fact, I believe that we can define the relationship that emerges from the documents fairly precisely: it is one of dependence. A disabled king relies upon his trusted wife to manage everything that he is incapable of tending to himself. Charles sought the queen’s advice when he was sane and counted on her to maintain the kingdom when he was “absent.” The clearest sign of this dependence is the series of royal ordinances authorizing her to act in his stead. But an occasional glimpse of the queen issuing from the odd observer confirms this impression. A letter of 1409 to the King of Aragon from Pons de Perellos, Spanish counselor of the Duke of Burgundy, suggests the king’s trust in his wife: “the king does nothing except what the queen and the councillors advise.”2\n\nWe can go further, I believe, and locate the roots of the king’s confidence in his wife in the close relationship he shared with her before his first episode of insanity. Traces of Isabeau and Charles VI in some of the chronicles suggest that their attachment was intense. The queen enters written history as a demure fourteen-year-old in 1385 with Froissart’s chronicle, bowing before the king in the palace of the archbishop of Amiens. Motionless, writes Froissart, she “ne mouvait oel, ni bouce” (she moved neither eye nor mouth), in perfect conformity with the ideal of modest behavior for girls.3 Froissart describes the meeting of the two in Amiens, claiming that Isabeau was so lovely that the seventeen-year-old King Charles VI fell in love with her at first sight:\n\nLe venredy, quant le jone dame fu parée et ordonnée enssi comme à li appertenoit, les trois ducoises l’amenèrent devers le roy. Quant elle fu devant le roy, elle s’engenilla tout bas, li rois vint vers ly, et le prist par le main, et le fist lever et le regarda de grant manière. En che regart, plaisance et amour li entrèrent ou coer, car il le vey belle et jone, et si avoit grant désir dou veoir et de l’avoir.\n\n[Friday, when the young lady had been bedecked and outfitted as befitted her, the three duchesses led her toward the king. When she was before the king, she knelt low; the king came toward her, raised her, and gazed at her. As he gazed, happiness and love entered his heart, for he saw that she was beautiful and young, and thus he greatly desired to gaze at her and possess her.]4\n\nSeveral representations of Isabeau remain to attest to her pretty bone structure.5 Her statue, accompanied by those of Charles VI, Jean of Berry, and Jean’s second wife, Jeanne of Boulogne, adorns the Palais de Justice in Poitier. The facial features of this statue, those represented in the famous miniature of folio 3 recto of Harley 4431 showing Christine de Pizan dedicating that same manuscript to the queen, and those of the queen’s marble gisant at Saint Denis, executed between 1425 and 1429, are clearly recognizable as belonging to the same woman. Her face was delicate with a slightly pointed nose and a dimpled chin. Her coloring may have been dark, for the “Songe véritable” describes her as envelopée en laide peau, probably a reference to the olive cast of her skin in an age when the ideal of feminine beauty prescribed white skin. The Pastoralet, composed during her lifetime, refers to her as brunette.6\n\nAs for her size, she may also have been small, for the same work, in the same line, calls her basse. A notion persists that the queen was short and obese. Nineteenth-century medical historian Auguste Brachet propounds that she suffered from an “anomalie de proportions, la malformation anatomique des membres inférieurs” (anomaly of proportions, the anatomical malformation of her inferior members) and obésité pathologique.7 Brachet appears to base his judgement on Isabeau’s deformities of the legs upon the adjective basse in the Pastoralet, which seems a very wide leap, indeed. Regarding the obesity, he cites Pintoin. However, when one follows the footnote, one discovers an ailing rather than outsized queen. In 1409, Pintoin reports, the king having recently returned to his senses, reiterated that during his “absences” the queen would substitute for him (suppleret). When the queen was prevented from stepping in, excessively burdened by mole carnis (physical difficulties) or other things, the dauphin would take over.8 Brachet, following Bellaguet, translates this as excess weight. However, while moles might mean a massive physical object, it also means any serious burden or problem, and moles carnis is a routine expression for anguishes of the flesh in a philosophical sense. In the case at hand, the context demands that we understand the queen to be oppressed occasionally by physical maladies. Obesity is not a condition that flares up from time to time, preventing action.\n\nIn any case, the young king found Isabeau ravishing, for he insisted on a speedy marriage; his counselors hastily convened and decided on the cathedral in Arras as the wedding venue. But even this was not soon enough for Charles, who objected: why not simply marry there in Amiens? The wedding took place, as he requested, in the cathedral at Amiens. The young couple met on a Friday; they married the following Monday, July 17.\n\nFroissart could not have been an eyewitness to the first meeting between Charles and Isabeau. Nonetheless, his description of this event is valuable because it preserves a contemporary perception of the relationship between the royal pair. Pintoin records a similar story, although without Froissart’s gusto, to make the same point. As Pintoin tells it, Charles chose Isabeau on the basis of her portrait, finding her the most beautiful of the three brides proposed to him.9 The anecdote about the portraits is almost certainly not true. Still, its meaning is the same as that of Froissart’s story: that the king was believed to have been very much in love with his wife. The stories of Charles’ coup de foudre are not necessarily intended to bear witness to Isa-beau’s physical loveliness (although she may have been considered beautiful by her contemporaries), I would suggest, but rather to demonstrate the profundity of the king’s emotional attachment to her. Love in the Middle Ages was conceived of as a heavily physical affect. Romance composers routinely equate love and physical desire. Modern readers will be wary of a “love” that expresses itself, as Charles’s does in the story recounted by Froissart, as sexual desire. But for Froissart, desire and love are identical, or, to be more precise, Charles’s desire for Isabeau is the outward sign of his great love. Moreover, the story tells us something about how Isabeau was perceived by others. It is rare to find a woman of the Middle Ages described as both beautiful and unworthy; the motif belongs very specifically to misogynistic discourse, like that of the jealous husband of the Ami’s story in the Roman de la Rose. Otherwise, beauty signified moral value. Rather than an objective, observable characteristic, “beauty” was a subjective impression the viewer held of his or her object: the response of a viewer predisposed to like the person he or she was observing. Predictably, Isabeau’s detractors do not call her beautiful. For example, as we have just noted, the pamphlet, the “Songe véritable,” disparages her skin. Once again, however, the point is not her objective physical appearance but rather the attitude of those describing her. The delight with which the uncles and the king’s entourage spread the news that the young man could hardly wait to marry the pretty princess, as recounted by Froissart, indicates that the princess’s merit was perceived by others as well as the king.\n\nFroissart supplies additional details that flesh out the image of the girl. Before her marriage, she made a three-week stop at Le Quesnoy in Picardy accompanied by her Uncle Frederick who was charged with delivering her safely to the French. There they visited her kinsmen Albert of Hainaut-Holland and his second wife, Marguerite (Albert and Marguerite were the parents of the boy and girl to whom Philip of Burgundy had married two of his own children, at whose wedding Jeanne of Brabant had pressed for the king’s Wittelsbach marriage. They were thus the parents of Count William, who would become the father-in-law of dauphin Jean de Touraine, and Marguerite, who married Jean sans Peur).10 Froissart remarks that by nature the girl “estoit propre et pourveue de sens et de doctrine” (was tidy, clever, and well-educated).11 But he also notes that her Bavarian style of dress was not acceptable within the universe to which her relations were preparing her entry. She was taught, therefore, how to dress in a manner worthy of the French court. In addition, she was instructed in courtly manners. Judging by Charles VI’s positive reaction to her at the time of their first meeting, the pupil had rapidly and thoroughly absorbed the training she received from her fashionable kinswoman. The meaning of this story, I would suggest, is that Isabeau, even though unable to speak French and unschooled in courtly ways, rapidly learned how to conduct herself in a manner acceptable to the French. From the beginning Isabeau was appreciated as a worthy match for the king.\n\nThe love story recounted by Froissart and Pintoin, then, is more than a love story, for a queen was never just the wife of a king but also a complement to royal power, and therefore her suitability was of the utmost importance. As Françoise Autrand expresses it, “il est hors de doute qu’il y a, dans le modèle chrétien occidental, une face féminine du pouvoir” (without doubt, in the western Christian model, power has a feminine side).12 We can follow Isabeau’s progress as she evolves into Charles’s “face féminine du pouvoir” with information from a number of sources. It is clear that her training for the role was taken seriously once she arrived in her new home. Charles left her the very day after the wedding to head for Damme in Flanders to defend the city’s port against the English who were occupying it. According to Grandeau’s itinerary, Isabeau departed Amiens for a three-month sojourn at Creil on July 20, traveling by way of Senlis.13 The girl must have been nervous—first, her life had changed forever in just days, and, then, she was left to face her new situation alone. But when she arrived at the royal chateau of Creil she was taken under the wing of a virtuous expert in courtly comportment, Blanche, well-loved and elderly Duchess of Orleans.14 Blanche of Orleans, born in 1316, was the posthumous daughter of Charles IV and Jeanne of Evreux. She had married Philip of Orleans, second son of Philip VI, and brother of Jean le Bon, grandfather of Charles VI. According to Pintoin, the venerable Blanche was the kingdom’s expert on tradition.15 Isabeau began her career in good hands.\n\nCharles’s initial delight in his wife did not diminish. Traces of the pleasure they took in being together throughout all the years of their marriage can be discerned. At the end of September during the first year of the marriage, Isabeau moved to the chateau at Vincennes, in the woods to the east of Paris. Although the chateau became an important military support point after 1405, when the conflict between Louis of Orleans and Jean sans Peur began to escalate, in 1385 it was a favorite royal residence. She spent the majority of the first year of her marriage there, joined from time to time by the king, who manifested his affection for her during these early days with gifts bearing the entwined initials of E and K, for Elisabeth and Karolus.16 Grandeau cites a letter from marmouset Bureau de la Rivière to the Cardinal of Laon describing a small trip the two would take together in January of 1386. The plan was to go to Melun, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, and Maubuisson. According to Bureau de la Rivière, they “s’esbattront là entour, luy et la royne” (will amuse themselves there, he and the queen).17 Nine months after that trip, in September 1386, Isabeau’s first child, the first dauphin Charles, was born at the nearby chateau of Beauté. A story related by Froissart and confirmed by an charter studied by Henri Moranvillé, who corrects just one detail of location in Froissart’s story, tells of the king returning with his entourage from a trip to the south of France in 1390, still enamored of his wife after five years. En route, the king, eager to see Isabeau and recognizing that his brother also missed his wife, Valentina Visconti, suggested that they leave the group behind and race home on horseback.18 That the couple’s intimate relationship continued after the king’s illnesses began is verified not only by the fact that Isabeau continued to bear children but also by an entry in the accounts of 1398, describing a charge for the repair of a “un pavillon ront qui sert pour vestir et ordonner le roy quent il vient devers la royne” (a round tent where the king dresses and puts himself in order when he goes to the queen).19 Two of the children, Catherine and the future Charles VII, can only have been conceived while the king was insane.20 Also, the two slept together during times of trouble. The night of Jean Petit’s justification, March 9, 1408, the king went to sleep with the queen; he then slipped into a state worse than anyone had seen in ten years.21 Pintoin reports that Charles’s voracious carnal appetite, which led him to violate his marriage, was a blot on his character.22 This may or may not be true. However, the profundity of the king’s attachement to his “tres amée Compaigne la Royne” and his affection for her radiates from the royal ordinances in which he leaves the care of the kingdom in her hands during his “absences.”\n\nAs for Isabeau’s feelings for the king, the documents allow us to piece together a portrait of a loving and loyal wife. Pintoin recounts her distress that her husband seemed not to know her when he was insane.23 Her appeals to God as well as magicians that her husband be cured of his illness are recorded.24 She donated money for the saying of masses in perpetuity for herself and Charles.25 She dedicated their daughter, Marie, born 1393, to the convent of Poissy, and named Michelle, born 1395, for the patron saint of France, to whom Charles had prayed and to whose shrine, Mont-Saint-Michel he had made a pilgrimage just before Michelle’s birth. In 1395, Isa-beau ordered the bishop of Tournai as quickly as possible to have three processions performed by people who were fasting and walking barefoot.26 Pintoin recalls the queen’s resignation to the assignment of Odette de Champ-divers (although he does not name her) to the job of mistress to the king.27 Although the assignment was carried out with the queen’s consent (“de consensus tamen regine”), she agreed, Pintoin notes, because the king showed violent tendencies toward her when he was ill. Presenting the king with a mistress was the lesser of two evils; therefore, she endured the situation, the chronicler explains (“illud tollerabat).28 In her will of 1408, Isabeau left several donations to the chapter of the cathedral at Amiens, because this was the place where she and Charles had been married.29 In 1409 Isabeau sent her children on a pilgrimage to Mont-Saint-Michel to pray for their father’s health.30\n\nBut the surest sign of her attachment and sense of loyalty to the king is the effort she maintained up until the Treaty of Troyes to preserve the throne for him and his heir. As guardian of the throne, I would suggest, Isabeau was vitally interested in the politics of the realm but reluctant to take a leading role. Regarding her interest in politics, we are forced to rely on indirect clues, like the forty letters each that she addressed to the dukes of Burgundy, Orleans, and Berry between 1398 and 1402 recorded in her accounts.31 This disputes the image of the queen as a political tyro stumbling on the scene for the first time in 1402. In summoning his wife to duty in 1402 by appointing her official mediator, Charles VI builds on what was already her political involvement. But it is equally clear that she never sought power for herself. At more than one point she voluntarily ceded hers to others: to the dauphin in 1408, to Jean sans Peur and the dauphin in 1409, to Jean sans Peur again in 1417. Still, she took on the responsibilities demanded of her by the king’s “absences.” She sought to protect the king’s sovereignty, spiriting the dauphin away in 1405 and transporting the king himself to safety from Jean sans Peur in 1408. She formed alliances with whoever seemed most capable of maintaining order in the kingdom. Finally, in 1417, she declared herself regent and joined forces with Jean sans Peur to rescue the king from the Armagnacs. Having rescued him, she did her best to bring a halt to the hostilities that had devastated the kingdom.\n\nTo return to the comment with which I began this discussion of Isabeau’s role as wife of King Charles VI, that the relationship was one of a disabled man’s dependence on his devoted wife, the queen’s intellectual capacity has often been dismissed as lacking. The inevitable conclusion of such an assessment is that the king’s trust was misplaced. From a distance of six centuries, it is impossible to judge the queen’s grasp of the issues she was required to handle. But the existence of a personal library that she brought with her on her travels challenges the picture of her as intellectually limited. In 1487, “un coffre de bois couvert de cuir fermant à clef, ferré et cloué” (a trunk of wood covered with leather, that could be locked, with iron bands nailed onto it) was purchased to “porter en chariot les livres et romans de la royne” (to carry in the chariot the books and stories of the queen).32 Susan Groag Bell’s work on book-owning women in medieval Europe helps put Isabeau’s thirty-nine known books into perspective. For the fifteenth century, only thirteen women owned between eleven and fifty books and only thirteen owned more than that; for the fourteenth century, the numbers dropped to seven who owned eleven to fifty and only one owned more. In this context, Isabeau’s library is remarkable. And she owned representatives of a variety of literary genres. In a secular vein, as Vallet de Viriville explains, her “romans” seem to have included the Chroniques de France, lent her by Philip the Bold, a work of educational value for a foreign queen of France, as well as a collection of contemporary poems, the “Cent Ballades,” which she purchased herself. She may have particularly enjoyed poetry, because Harley 4431 contains a collection of Christine de Pizan’s poetry. Her books were cared for by her librarian, Catherine de Villiers, who herself must have been a bibliophile, for she had earlier served the Jeanne de Bourbon, queen of Charles V, by helping her to read books of hours.33\n\nIn addition to works in the vernacular, Isabeau also possessed a large collection of pious works, the maintenance of which her accounts record throughout the years. She owned a life of Saint Margaret, an Heures de la Croix et du Saint-Esprit, a Petites Heures de Notre Dame, a Légende dorée, and she commissioned the meditative work, the Passion Isabeau.34 Thus beyond a pleasure in reading, the queen’s library attests to another quality that would have been deemed essential for her role as the feminine face of power: piety. Further supporting this assumption, she possessed a Franciscan confessor, six chaplains, and an organist among her entourage.35 Scattered items in her accounts—portable altars, reliquaries, a table, and candle to say her hours in the dark—bear witness to her personal piety.36 Rachel Gibbons offers ample evidence of the queen’s generosity to religious establishments. In addition to the gifts she made during her lifetime, in her final will she left donations of property—for she had no money to leave after settling her debts and providing for her household—to Notre Dame, Saint Denis, and Poissy. In earlier wills, when her financial situation had been more favorable, she had offered bequests to Chartres, Senlis, the Sainte-Chapelle, and the Friars Minor and Notre Dame in Munich.37\n\nA sixteenth-century reference to the queen’s charity deserves mention. In Les Mémoires et recherches de la dévotion, piété et charité des illustres Roynes de France of 1586, Nicolas Houël describes that Isabeau “se demonstra fort devote, 38\n\nMother\n\nThe traces of Isabeau’s relationships with her children suggest that she was as devoted to them as she was to her husband. Over a period of twenty-one years, from the birth of her first baby, Charles, when Isabeau was about sixteen, until November 1407, when her last child, Philip, was born and died on the same day, she bore twelve children. Only three outlived her. Of her six sons, three died young—two small Charleses and a Philip. Two, Louis and Jean, died at just short of nineteen, while a third Charles survived to adulthood to become Charles VII. The girls fared better. Of the six girls, only Jeanne died as a baby. Isabelle, who at the age of seven became the second wife of Richard II of England (whose first marriage to Anne of Bohemia had been one of the catalysts for Isabeau’s own marriage), lived to the age of nineteen, when she died bearing the child of her second husband, Charles of Orleans. The second Jeanne, duchess of Brittany, lived to be forty-two; Marie, Dominican nun at the convent of Poissy, lived to forty-five; Michelle, first wife of Philip, son of Jean sans Peur, lived to twenty-seven; Catherine, queen of Henry V of England, thirty-seven.\n\nMuch of Isabeau’s time in her early years was consecrated to childbearing and maternal activity; all evidence suggests that the queen was a caring mother, devoted to her children even before they were born. Yann Grandeau’s itinerary indicates that before the births of Isabelle, Jeanne, Charles, Marie, Michelle, and Jean, she visited the pilgrimage site Saint-Sanctin-de-Chuisnes, near Chartres, which contained a belt of the Virgin Mary.39 She also had relics brought to her during her pregnancies and purchased small pictures of gilded silver called “agnus dei” that “les femmes portent quant elles sont grosses” (women carry when they are pregnant).40 Prayers were considered the most efficacious means of insuring a future child’s health. It is important to keep this in mind when reflecting on Isabeau as a mother. Today a pregnant woman cares for her unborn child through diet, exercise, and regular medical care; Isabeau lent hers the equivalent care through pilgrimages and prayers. In the account of Burgundian court customs composed between 1484 and 1491 by Aliénor de Poitiers, we discover an interesting insight into Isabeau’s optimism regarding her babies. According to Aliénor, quoted by Grandeau, until Isabeau, all queens of France gave birth in rooms decorated in white.41 Isabeau chose green. Grandeau points out that Isabeau’s devise was “hope.” Perhaps then her reason for choosing green, the color for growth and hope in heraldry, was that she wished to give birth under a positive sign.\n\nWhen the children were small, she kept them alongside her until they were weaned from their wet nurses; when she left Paris she often took them with her.42 Her household accounts reveal that when she was separated from her children, she visited them, bearing gifts, and that she wrote letters to them.43 In 1399 when the plague struck Paris, she sent the older children into the country for safety but remained behind herself with the baby, Jean, who was still too small to be moved. A document of April 15, 1404, entitled “Sauvegarde de la Reine Isabeau en faveur des Celestins de Notre-Dame a Paris,” shows Isabeau guaranteeing to her “bien amez les religieux Celestins” (her well-loved Celestines) continued access to certain gardens and vineyards for which she, Isabeau, has had doors made so that “toutes et quantes fois qu’il nous plaira, nous et nos enfans puissions entrer es monastere et eglise desdiz religieux et aussi en leurs vignes et jardins et autres lieux, tant pour notre devotion comme pour l’esbatement et plaisance de nous et de nosdiz enfans” (whenever and as often as she like, she and her children could enter the monastery and the church of the said order, and also their vineyards and gardens and other spots, both for devotion and for the entertainment and pleasure of herself and her children).44\n\nThe accounts also detail the devotional books that Isabeau purchased for her daughters, signals of her interest in their education.45 While the boys would have received their education primarily from tutors, the mother played an important role in educating her daughters, as the proliferation of imagery of St. Anne, with her book and the Virgin, beginning in the fourteenth century, suggests.46 The accounts show that she purchased books of hours and psalters; the detail that Michelle was given an “ABC of psalms” as a birthday gift brings Isabeau’s relationships with her daughters to life.47 Other details include a silver pan to make porridge (“paelle d’argent blanc à faire la bouillie”), and a golden mill trimmed with pearls and little brooms for the amusement of Madamoiselle Isabelle (“moulin d’or garni de perles et de balays petis, pour l’esbattement de madame Ysabel”).48 The luxurious trousseau for Isabelle as the seven-year-old was being prepared to become queen of England included dolls trimmed and provisioned with silver utensils (“garnies et estoffées de vaiselle d’argent”).49 The purchase of pets, parrots for Isabelle, Jeanne, and Michelle, and turtledoves for Catherine, birthday presents, toys, and clothes for special occasions are recorded as well, bearing witness to the queen’s maternal interest.50\n\nWe also find Isabeau reacting ferociously in response to separation from her children. Although her society often required that mothers send their children far from home to be raised in the homes of their spouses, Isabeau resisted. Pintoin describes her dismay at learning that her son Jean was to be taken from her care and raised in the home of his new wife, Jacqueline, in Hainaut. Strong ties linked the families, as we have seen. Still, after the wedding festival, Pintoin reports, when the young Duke of Touraine’s new mother-in-law moved to take the boy home with her, the queen voiced her extreme opposition.51 But Isabeau could not prevent her son’s departure; it had been written into the marriage treaty that the boy was to be raised in Hai-naut by his in-laws. Isabeau’s copious weeping at the death of her last baby, Philip, is likewise described by Pintoin: “Infantis immatura mors materna viscera conturbavit, totumque tempus purgacionis regina continuavit in lamentis” (The premature death of her baby distressed her in her innermost maternal being, and during the entire time of the birth, the queen continued to lament).52\n\nIsabeau seems to have enjoyed close relationships with her daughters even after they left home. Jeanne, Duchess of Brittany, came to visit her mother for several months over the summer of 1415.53 As for her daughter Isabelle, little queen of England, messages were transmitted between the girl and her mother by Pierre Salmon. Charles VI was “très joieux de savoir le bon estat du roy d’Angleterre, et de Madame la royne sa fille…. Et aussi fut la royne après qu’elle ot veu ses lettres” (very happy to learn of the good condition of the King of England and of madame the queen, his daughter… . And the queen was also happy after she saw the letters).54 When Richard II was deposed and presumably assassinated by order of Henry IV, Charles and Isabeau anguished while they negotiated their daughter’s return. Documents related to the event describe how ambassadors were instructed to assure the girl that her rescue was under way and to urge her not to agree to any marriage plans that Henry IV might propose. If the ambassadors were able to speak to the girl alone, they were to tell her how much the king and queen desired to see her (“que le Roy et la Royne la désirent moult veoir”) and to persuade her to do everything in her power to return home soon (“que elle mette la diligence que ele pourra à ce que tost puist retourner devers eulx”).55 Isabelle returned to France, where she was joyfully received. Pintoin describes the joy of her parents that their dilectissimam filiam had returned safely. Isabelle reentered her mother’s household, where her status was necessarily less than it had been as it had been as queen of England. Nonetheless, Isabeau surrounded her with ladies even nobler than those who had surrounded her before her depature.56 In 1406, the sixteen-year-old Isabelle was married to Charles of Orleans, son of Louis of Orleans, much to her chagrin; it was a demotion for the onetime queen of England to marry the son of a duke.57 However, she seems not to have held the marriage against her mother. She is recorded as having visited Isabeau at the end of April 1409, just months before her death in childbirth on September 9.58 Little Marie was sent to the convent at Poissy when she was four years old, but she was not forgotten. Isabeau’s accounts demonstrate that Marie received étrennes and letters.59 The youngest girl, Catherine, educated in the convent at Poissy where Marie had been consecrated, accompanied her mother during her imprisonment leading up to the Treaty of Troyes. Henry V, having met her, “estoit moult désirant de l’avoir en marriage, et aussi y avoit bien cause, car elle estoit moult belle dame, de hault lieu et gracieuse manière” (wanted very much to marry her, and for good reason, because she was a very beautiful woman, of high birth and gracious manner).60\n\nOf Isabeau’s relationships with her children, the most problematic for modern readers is that with her youngest surviving child, Charles, whom she attempted to deprive of the throne of France with the Treaty of Troyes. I hope to have dealt adequately with this issue in chapter seven. But her later relationships with the daughters who survived her, Jeanne, married to the Duke of Brittany, and Catherine, queen of England, are slightly mysterious, as well. Only the nun, Marie, is mentioned in Isabeau’s will. Jeanne and Catherine receive no attention at all. However, Grandeau offers two possible explanations.61 First, he points out that the Jeanne had incited her husband to support the dauphin. And indeed, the Duke of Brittany, allied with the Burgundians after the Treaty of Troyes, signed an alliance with the Duke of Burgundy and Charles VII that laid the groundwork for the later reconciliation between the Burgundians and the dauphin. This rapprochement may have aroused Isabeau’s wrath, concludes Grandeau. However, it seems impossible that the queen would not have welcomed the possibility of peace after all the years she had spent seeking it. And why no mention of Catherine? She was with her mother from the time of the queen’s rescue by Jean sans Peur from Tours in 1417 until she departed France for England in 1421. Gran-deau’s second hypothesis regarding the absence of the two women from the queen’s will seems much more plausible: that the surviving will was simply a portion of the entire, the “spiritual” rather than the “material” portion. In favor of this interpretation is the fact that the will mentions only donations to different churches; paying her creditors; alms for the poor; and gifts to her daughter, Marie, the nun. The plausibility of the explanation is increased by the fact that besides Jeanne and Catherine, the queen’s ladies receive no mention either. Perhaps they were covered in the “material” will.\n\nThe black legend of Isabeau holds that she passed the early years of her marriage in a whirlwind of balls and parties, seducing Charles VI to follow her and neglecting their children. As noted in chapter two:\n\nElle ne tente rien pour arrêter Charles VI, entraîné sur la pente fatale des plaisirs. Quand elle n’accomplit pas quelque pèlerinage, ou que ses couches ne la contraignent pas au repos, elle vit comme dans un tourbillon d’amusements folâtres, de splendides réjouissances. Et, pendant que le Roi gaspille ses forces, compromet sa dignité, se gâte l’intelligence, elle-même s’expose, par des fatigues immodérées, à ne donner au Royaume que des enfants chétifs.\n\n[She did not try to halt Charles VI, who was headed for destruction. When not on some pilgrimage or constrained to her bed by pregnancy, she existed in a whirlwind of insane amusements, of splendid pleasures. And while the king wasted his strength, compromised his dignity, ruined his intelligence, she ran herself down to the point where she could give the kingdom only feeble children.]62\n\nBut this aspect of the Isabeau story finds no support in any written source, even that of the judgemental Pintoin: stories about the queen’s participation in parties that sapped her strength and that of her unborn offspring, causing them to be born weak, are completely absent from his chronicle. The queen plays no role in feasts described disapprovingly by Pintoin. For example, a huge festival was celebrated at Saint Denis at Easter time, 1389, to knight the sons of Marie of Blois, queen of Sicily and widow of Louis of Anjou, when she departed for Italy to protect their interests. Pintoin concludes the entry by adding that he would have left off the story there, but that he would like to follow the advice of those who want to see examples of bad as well as good. He then goes on to note that excessive eating and drinking took place and that many even soiled the sanctity of the religious house by committing adultery!63 However, Isabeau’s presence at the feast is noted only when Pintoin remarks that the abbey at Saint Denis was reserved for her lodgings.64\n\nA possible explanation for the notion of the queen as wild socialite may be Froissart’s description of her lavish coronation celebration in 1389 and a 1393 wedding feast gone awry that has come to be known as the bal des ardents—feast organized by the king to celebrate the third marriage of Isa-beau’s dear friend, Catherine de Fastavarin. Isabeau had been accompanied by this friend when she first came from Bavaria, and the queen loved her dearly on account of her nationality and language (quia nacionis et ydiomatis).65 The king and five of his men decided to disguise themselves as wild and hairy creatures to harass the groom, who had been widowed three times before.66 Unfortunately, they chose the most flammatory material imaginable for their costumes, sewing themselves into linen cloth soaked in a type of wax on which they pressed tangled hemp. Louis of Orleans, roundly chastized for his stupidity by both Pintoin and Froissart, approached the six with his torch, leaning close to see who they were and inadvertently igniting some of them. The king escaped with his life, but four of the others were not so fortunate. The next day, a furious crowd of Parisians stormed the Hôtel Saint Pol thinking the king had died, but found him safe and sound. In popular literature the celebration is often attributed to Isabeau, as a means of inculpating her. But in fact, the king organized it. The story can also be used to verify the queen’s attachment to the king, for she is reported to have reacted hysterically and even fainted when she realized that he was among the burning revelers.\n\nThe king’s lavish feasts, integral to his image as generous monarch of a powerful kingdom, cannot be regarded as “a whirlwind of insane amusements, of splendid pleasures.” First, feasts were infrequent events. “Ces grandes assemblées sont rares: elles ont pour prétexte le mariage d’un prince ou la réception d’un chef d’Etat” (These grand assemblies were rare: they took place only for the wedding of a prince or the reception for a head of state), writes Grandeau on the basis of his study of the queen’s accounts.67 A factor in the lack of frequency was the difficulty in assembling the large crowds of nobles necessary for such events. As Werner Paravicini explains, invitations to court for brilliant receptions were obligations, like the duty to provide arms when called to battle, imposed by feudal custom. An invitation to a marriage celebration was a costly burden, requiring an elaborate gift; indeed, such celebrations were a form of taxation. Second, they were “moyens de création, de consolidation, de représentation de pouvoir” (means of creating, consolidating, and representing power).68 They were not opportunities for Isabeau to dance until dawn.\n\nAnother possible explanation for the notion of Isabeau as a socialite neglectful of her childen is Froissart’s remark that when the king had recovered from his first bout of illness people from all over the kingdom were so relieved that they converged on Paris to rejoice. Therefore at the Hôtel Saint Pol, throughout the long winter nights, there were many “danses et caroles et moult d’esbatements devant le roy et la royne et la duchesse de Berry et la duchesse d’Orleans” (dances and carols and much entertainment before the king and the queen and the Duchess of Berry and the Duchess of Orleans).69 However, the king’s court would have been the center of musical and literary activity in France. It is difficult to imagine that such activity would have been criticized by contemporaries.\n\nIn the absence of personal documents, we can only imagine Isabeau’s emotions toward her children. However, as I noted above, she commissioned a work in 1398, the Passion Isabeau, which forcefully emphasizes the tender relationship between Jesus and the Virgin in its affective language. This meditation on the life and passion of Christ, based on the Latin Meditationes vitae Christi, brings to life a heartbreakingly concerned mother and her affectionate son. We find Mary anxiously anticipating her son’s return from Jersalem in the early days of his career: she waited at home “en tresgrant angoisse et douleur de cuer” (in very great anguish and heartsick; 73, lines 433–34). She “receut son doulz enfant” (received her sweet child; 73, line 434) and begged him not to return to Jerusalem because “ceste dure gent te veult tant de mal” (those cruel people want to hurt you; 73, line 444). Jesus responded “a sa tendre mere tres humblement” (very humbly to his loving mother; 434, line 447). Later, as she watches her son in agony upon the cross, Mary begs God “de alleger aucunement ses paines et les lui faire plus portables” (to relieve his suffering a little and make it more bearable for him; 165, lines 3688–89). From his position on the cross, Jesus sympathizes with his mother’s sorrow and feels his “cuer tres perciés et toutes les entrailles et corps et ame tous esmeus par pitié” (heart torn and his insides and body and soul all moved by pity; 165, lines 3692–94). He recognizes that his mother’s heart is attached to him, hanging on the cross with him, and he has no doubt that she would happily join him physically if she could. If we assume that a person’s emotions are shaped by the templates offered by his or her culture, Isabeau certainly possessed a model for interpreting the protective love and sorrow she experienced as a mother.\n\nFriend\n\nBecause of the lack of distinction between private and public life within the household of a medieval queen, Isabeau’s friends were necessarily her staff, the members of her household. Discussions of the queen’s household frequently evoke the miniature of Christine de Pizan presenting the manuscript Harley 4431 to Isabeau as she sits surrounded by her ladies in her chambers.70 The miniature, like Christine’s Cité des dames, imagines a society of women that parallels, mirrors, and sometimes corrects the society of men. The society of women, both in fact and fiction, occupied its own separate space. As Autrand writes: “L’Hôtel—au sens technique du terme—d’un prince se passe, en effet, fort bien de dame. A côté de l’Hôtel de Monseigneur existe celui de Madame, chacun des deux ayant son personnel, sa gestion, ses finances.” (The hotel—in the technical sense of the term—of a prince had no need of a woman. Beside the hotel of Monseigneur stood that of Madame, each with its own personnel, administration, finances.)71 But despite its physical separation from the society of men, the society of women was imagined as a necessary part of society as a whole. “En revanche,” continues Autrand,\n\nla représentation du pouvoir n’omet jamais l’épouse du prince. L’art du temps est là pour en témoigner: statues du prince et de la princesse de part et d’autre des portes de châteaux ou d’églises, sans parler des orant dans les chapelles, des vitraux, des peintures de manuscrtis, du décor amorié, partout apparaît non le prince mais le couple princier. [On the other hand, the representation of power never omits the wife of the prince. The art of the time testifies to this: statues of the prince and prince on either side of the doors of castles and churches, not to mention figures praying in chapels, stained-glass windows, manuscript illuminations, heraldry, everywhere appears not just the prince but the princely couple.]72\n\nIsabeau’s household, thus, constituted a world parallel to that of the king. But before exploring this idea in more detail, it is necessary to revise certain misconceptions about this entity that have long circulated. The black legend holds that when she was not feasting, Isabeau presided over an entourage of extravagant pleasure-seeking courtiers, out of sight of the king, at her small manor, the Hôtel Barbette, situated in what is today the Marais in Paris. As Grandeau’s itinerary clearly demonstrates, however, the queen spent little time in the Hôtel Barbette. She possessed the property between 1399 and 1408, but during those nine years she passed fewer than six months there.73 Before 1390, the royal couple’s principal residence was the château at Vincennes just outside of Paris. As of 1390, this shifted to the Hôtel St. Pol, and, from that point on, the queen spent the majority of her time there. The idea of the dissolute Isabeau frittering away money with her debauched courtiers derives from Pintoin’s mention of the sermon of Jacques Legrand, the purpose of which I discussed in chapter four, and the incident of April 1417, reported in several of the chroniclers, when Isabeau’s household was closed down by the Armagnacs on the pretext that her courtiers had been leading dissolute lives. But as we have seen, the political intent of this intervention was clear. In contrast with the dark mythology, the household that emerges from the documents is characterized by the constant buzz of official activity carried on within its purview. It is in a sense a cité des dames, but one that housed many male officers, as well.\n\nThe organization of Isabeau’s household, or hôtel, as well as the biographies of the ladies in her entourage have been studied.74 I will not repeat the information collected in these studies but simply cull some of the details pertinent to this revision of Isabeau’s character. As we noted in chapter four, the king’s retinue constituted the court, the curia; but the queen had maintained a separate household since the mid-thirteenth century.75 The household established for Isabeau at the time of her marriage was entirely comparable to those created for her predecessors. Comparing the households of Jeanne of Burgundy, queen of Philip V, in 1316, and Isabeau between the years 1398–1406, Rachel Gibbons indicates that Isabeau’s spent between a low of 41,969 livres parisis to a high of 52, 690 livres parisis per year, while Jeanne’s spent roughly one quarter that amount, 12,410 livres parisis.76 The difference can be explained by the more comprehensive staff that Isabeau required, and also by the larger number of children with retinues of their own dependent on her. Various accounts remain from the years 1398–1406 and then again from 1409 to 1417 to cast light on the composition of Isabeau’s staff. Gibbons explains that because of her responsibilities related to the government of the realm, she employed a group of political counselors, who alone received 46 percent of the total pensions paid out in 1409–10, an indication of their importance to the queen.77\n\nAs for the characters of those by whom Isabeau was surrounded, when the lives of the ladies of her entourage are examined, the notion of her as the head of a group of debauched courtiers appears farfetched. Grandeau’s collection of information about her closest circle allows us to flesh the group out a bit, revealing a well-loved queen surrounded by ladies known for their impeccable moral status. Throughout her life, her personal entourage, that is, the ladies who followed her in her daily activity, was composed of about fifteen women.78 At the summit of the fifteen were three or four dames de chambres, one of whom exercised the office of guardian of the queen’s seal, all chosen for their lofty social rank and the prestige of the houses they represented, as well as for their exemplary conduct. These women were often widows, because of the requirement that they be present at all times.\n\nThat exemplar of charity, Blanche, Duchess of Orleans, was the first to occupy a position of confidant to the queen, as we have seen. Others occupying the position included the mother-daughter pair of Madame d’Eu and Mademoiselle de Dreux, cousins of Charles VI. Madame d’Eu, Isabelle de Melun, was praised by Christine de Pizan as a sage et prudente mesnai-gière.79 Her daughter, Jeanne, who had been widowed on the very day of her wedding, when her husband, Simon de Thouars, Count of Dreux, was killed in a joust, remained a widow for the rest of her life. Another long-term member of this close circle was the notably pious Jeanne de Luxembourg (whom Pintoin describes as insignis et devotissima domicella de Lucembourgo), who divided her time between Isabeau’s household and the royal abbey at Moncel.80 The queen’s affection for Jeanne was so great that she could not stand to be separated from her; they were still in contact in 1416. Another of the queen’s dames was Catherine de Fastavarin, who served the queen until her death some time in 1401. Two of Catherine’s children are later found in the service of Louis of Guyenne, demonstrating that the ties between the women extended into future generations.\n\nIn the first years after her marriage, Isabeau’s dames and demoiselles d’honneur were assigned to her. After Charles declared himself free of his uncles’ influence and brought his father’s group of counselors, the marmousets, back to court, some of the wives of the marmousets joined her intimate circle. Madame de la Rivière, praised by Christine de Pizan for her generosity, seems to have been a special favorite of the queen.81 Letters sent to her by the queen indicate that even after the fall of the marmousets, Isabeau continued to rely on her. Madame de Nouvion, wife of marmouset Jean le Mercier, Seigneur de Nouvion, left the queen’s service after the fall of her husband. But her son, Charles, was married to one of the queen’s ladies from Germany, Isabeau la Maréchale.82 Marcel Thibault speculated that\n\nla Reine assista indifférente à la chute des Marmousets; en effet, si elle avait témoigné quelque déplaisir de l’évenèment, ou si, au contraire, elle y avait applaudi, nous le saurions comme nous savons que le ministres, fort malmenés par les Princes, durent la vie et la conservation d’une partie de leurs biens à la jeune duchesse de Berry qui intercéda pour eux, et à l’intervention de Charles VI dans un de ses moments de ludicité. [the queen watched the fall of the marmousets with indifference; indeed, had she experienced some displeasure over the incident, or if, on the contrary, she had applauded it, we would know, just as we know that the ministers, badly treated by the uncles, owed their lives and the conservation of some of their goods to the young Duchess of Berry who interceded for them and to the intervention of Charles VI during one of his moments of lucidity.]83\n\nHowever, the reason for Isabeau’s silence regarding the marmousets is revealed by Froissart, who explains that just before their fall, the Duchess of Burgundy was assigned to monitor the queen. In other words, Isabeau was closely guarded during that period. Froissart describes the older woman’s stranglehold over Isabeau in harsh terms: “Pour ces jours, la duchesse de Bourgoingne qui estoit une crueuse et austère dame, se tenoit à Paris delés la royne de France, et en avoit la souveraine administration, ne nuls, ne nulle ne parloit à la royne fors par le moien d’elle.” (During those days, the duchess of Burgundy, who was a cruel and austere woman, stayed at the side of the Queen of France and had sovereign administration over her, so that no one could talk to the queen without going through her.)84 If Froissart’s understanding of the situation is accurate, the Duchess of Burgundy would have been imposed upon the queen to keep her silent, the uncles knowing full well her attachment to her ladies and thus her inevitable concern for the welfare of their husbands.\n\nBut for a mediator queen’s success, it was crucial that she exercise control over her own household. Although the early impression of Isabeau is that of a vulnerable young woman, as she matured she showed more independence, working for her family and creating advantageous marriages for her ladies. For one thing, she supported her brother’s career over a period of nearly twenty-five years, a tribute undoubtedly to the siblings’ closeness, but also evidence of her sense of herself as a mediator between French and Bavarian interests. Louis of Bavaria was a frequent presence at her court between 1391 and 1415. The queen’s attachment to Germany was fiercely criticized by nineteenth-century historians, and the spirit of these attacks lives on in such unsupported and unsupportable comments as her “grasp of French was never complete and she spoke with a thick guttural accent to the end of her days.”85 But as queen, part of Isabeau’s role was to foster good relations between the French kingdom and its neighbors and to promote her family. For what is the queen if not the champion of her family, the nexus for creating relationships among different kin groups, the means of mediation between competing interests? Women exerted influence within their own primary circles, and across less closely related circles, as well, acting as links between different circles of acquaintances and families. While maintaining kinship ties, they also created ties with other lineages through marriage, and thus their circles contained a variety of different networks that they could exploit if they were socially skilled. It is to be expected that Isabelle would serve as a link between those close to her and other contacts she could secure through her influence; this is what it means to be politically involved in the fifteenth century.\n\nIsabeau remained attached to her kin long after her departure from her homeland. In 1392 she welcomed her cousin, Bonne Visconti, to the French court.86 Daughter of Carlo—son of Bernabo Visconti, he had fled to the court of Isabeau’s father after Bernabo’s assassination—and Beatrice of Armagnac, Bonne was forced to leave the court of Savoy where she had been placed following the upheaval. She grew up under the queen’s care, remaining until the Cabochian revolt. Moreover, the queen’s attachment to Bavaria is attested by a letter of February 1392, which she wrote to the Council of Munich to inform them of the birth of the dauphin.87\n\nThe queen’s ability to maintain a level of interest in Germany at the French court witnesses her influence:\n\nEin gelegentliches Geschenk an nach Deutschland zurückkehrende Ritter, ein zufällig in Strassburg erhalten gebliebener lateinischer Gruss an den Vater müssen genügen, um den regelmässigen Austausch von Lebens-zeichen und Nachrichten durch Boten zu beweisen; und dass man in Paris auch über die politischen Ereignisse in Bayern auf dem Laufenden war, zeigt ein Brief Karls VI von 1388 an Strassburg, in dem er die Stadt warnt, sich den schwäbischen Städten in Kampf gegen seinen Schwie-gervater Herzog Stephan anzuschliessen, und ein anderer, in dem er seinem Schwiegervater zu dem errungenen Sieg gratuliert. [An occasional present to a knight returning to Germany, a Latin greeting to her father that by chance remained in Strasbourg must suffice to testify to the regular exchange of the signs of life and news through messengers; and a 1388 letter from Charles VI to Strasbourg in which the city is warned not to join forces against his father-in-law Duke Stephen shows that the Parisians were aware of political events in Bavaria, as does another in which he congratulates his father-in-law on his victory.]88\n\nAnd yet, her relationship with her brother, Louis, has come in for criticism. In particular, the queen has long been believed to have surreptitiously siphoned money from the French treasury off to him. Louis left Bavaria with his followers on his first trip to Paris in mid-November 1391, remaining until 1393 or 1394. During this initial visit, he received a pension of 5,000 francs a year from the king. Examples of the pensions paid by the French to similarly situated German vassals indicate that the pension was normal. Louis of Orleans paid the Margraf of Luxembourg 6,000 francs a year, while Isabeau’s uncle, Frederick, had received 4,000 a year.89 As for the story reported by Pintoin that Isabeau was transferring money to the Germans in 1405, it can be explained as part of a 120,000 franc payment owed Louis, as the dowry of his bride, Anne of Bourbon, which the king had promised to pay.90 The wedding, which took place on Louis’s third trip to France, on October 8, 1402, also brought an increase in his pension, which was thereafter worth 12,000 francs a year. But as was often the case, the king did not have sufficient funds on hand to honor his debts. Thus he offered Louis valuable objects, including the Goldenes Rössl, which the duke then sent to Bavaria. Pintoin reported the outrage of the citizens of Metz, who did not understand why valuables were being transported to Germany. However we may blanch at the idea of the passing around of extremely valuable jeweled presents, étrennes like the Goldenes Rössl were systematically exchanged as a form of currency: they were melted down and transformed into new items. This is why so few examples remain today.\n\nStill, Isabeau’s influence never compared with that of the king’s male relatives, and if Louis of Bavaria’s trip to France was financially very profitable for him, he did not achieve the status at the French court that Isabeau had hoped for him.91 Neither Louis of Orleans nor Philip of Burgundy attended Louis of Bavaria’s wedding to Anne of Bourbon.92 Nor was Isabeau successful in an attempt to have him named connétable, a position he was prevented from receiving by Louis of Orleans.93 Little trace of Louis of Bavaria’s influence can be perceived; he did not sit at the Royal Council. Theodor Straub, Louis’ biographer, notes that “Gleichstellung mit den Fürsten des Hofes war noch nicht erreicht” (parity with the dukes of the court was not yet achieved).94\n\nThe story of Isabeau’s relationship with Louis has an unhappy ending, for after a lifetime of accepting gifts from his sister, he was unable or unwilling to return the favor when she requested help from him. When after the Treaty of Troyes the queen found herself living under straitened circumstances in English-occupied Paris, she appealed to her brother, then definitively established in Bavaria, for support. As Grandeau explains, in July 1405, Louis had ceded Isabeau a number of properties as collateral on a loan of 57,000 francs.95 Isabeau had abandoned usufruct of the properties until the death of their father. But when she requested the revenue now owed her, Louis refused. Isabeau called on Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund to intervene on her behalf, which he did without result. The Duke of Bavaria’s reason for his refusal was that he was involved in a war at the time and could not afford to come to his sister’s rescue.\n\nIsabeau’s household after her first several years in France came to shelter a sizeable German contingent, besides her brother. Grandeau notes that she had only one German lady in her company, Catherine de Fastavarin, from 1385 until the mid-1390s. But as of 1396, the knights accompanying Louis of Bavaria began to bring the young women of their houses to the French court: six lived there in 1402 and ten in 1406. Most returned to Bavaria between 1413 and 1417. One of her dames was the Bavarian Anne de Semihier, wife of Stephen Schmiecher von Schmiechen, who accompanied Louis of Bavaria on his first trip to France in 1391. Madame de Semihier may be the guardian of the queen’s seal who left Isabeau’s household during the crisis of 1405—the Madame Minchière to whom Pintoin refers, although he confuses her name. But although the queen and Madame de Semihier parted ways in 1405, there is no reason to believe that they did so on bad terms, for her husband and a daughter called Isabeau remained in Queen Isabeau’s service. Another of Isabeau’s Bavarian ladies, Madame de Moy, served the queen from 1405 until her death, when Madame de Moy was at the queen’s deathbed. Grandeau writes that Madame de Moy had been called home to Germany by her brothers, who wanted to place her in a second marriage in 1423. Madame de Moy, however, remained with the queen.96 One cannot help but be disappointed to discover that Marie, Isabeau’s daughter who became a nun at Poissy, challenged her mother’s will, attempting to deprive Madame de Moy and other of Isabeau’s ladies of what the queen had left them.97 Marie’s case was dismissed in September 1437. Another lady close to Isabeau was Catherine of Alençon, second wife of the queen’s brother, Louis of Bavaria. For reasons unknown, Catherine remained behind with Isabeau when Louis returned to Germany for good in 1415. As Grandeau explains, Louis seems to have abandoned his wife completely, leaving her without means. Isabeau wrote to her brother on Catherine’s behalf, describing the disress the woman had experienced on account of his neglect. When he continued to ignore his wife, Isabeau intervened with Henry VI to have Catherine allotted an annual rent of 2,000 livres tournois.98\n\nIsabeau’s black legend holds that not only the queen herself but her ladies suffered from a bad reputation during their own time; a recent article aiming to flesh out the reasons for the May 22, 1413, arrest of a contingent of officers and ladies from Isabeau’s household, at the height of the Cabochian revolt, asserts that they were the target of “repeated verbal attacks. They were hit by accusations from all political sides, represented negatively by preachers, royal propagandists, nobles, and people in the city streets. Systematically the women were stigmatized as disruptive, conniving, malicious, and publicly dangerous.”99 Like the notion of Isabeau’s bad reputation among her contemporaries, the idea that the queen’s ladies were held in bad repute is tenacious. This article offers no evidence that the ladies had been dogged by mala fama over the years but simply assumes this to have been the case. And yet the contemporary chroniclers indicate no such thing.\n\nThe idea of Isabeau’s defamed ladies is so pervasive that I would like to consider it here in this discussion of her household. The ladies, argues the article, “were arrested and hauled away because they had been represented as playing their courtly role too well. They were too visble, too extravagant, too quick with words.”100 I would argue that, on the contrary, the ladies’ arrest does not indicate their bad reputations. As I have been suggesting throughout this study, we cannot reasonably speak of a bad reputation in the midst of a feud; depending on the side with which one is allied, one will be popular with that side and unpopular with the other. The ladies, like the male officers of the king and the dauphin who were arrested at the same time, found themselves on the wrong side of the dispute. Jean sans Peur was in control of the city at the time: Isabeau and the ladies were not sufficiently Burgundian. As we have seen, by 1413, after a period of alliance with Jean sans Peur, the dauphin Louis and the queen had separated themselves from his influence.\n\nThe arrest of the ladies must be seen the larger context of a series of arrests of non-Burgundians in positions of power. The arrests of the Jean de Vailly, the dauphin’s chancellor, and Jacques de la Rivière, his chamberlain, both of whom the young man had appointed to replace the Duke of Burgundy’s men, along with several other of his men, preceded the arrests of Isabeau’s ladies on April 28. On May 22, another group of rebellious Parisians broke into the Hôtel Saint Pol, where they demanded that a group of the queen’s entourage be handed over: this time those taken prisoner included Louis of Bavaria and Jean de Nielles, the Burgundian forced on the dauphin as his chancellor and replaced by Jean de Vailly (Jean de Nielles was quickly released), along with several other officers from the households of the dauphin and the queen.101 At the same time, a group of Isabeau’s ladies and demoiselles was arrested. They were held in prison until the dauphin was able to release them on August 4.102\n\nThe ladies, then, were arrested, like their male counterparts from the households of the king, the dauphin, and the queen, because they held well-paid positions of importance and influence. The chroniclers draw no distinction between the reasons for arrest or treatment of the groups on the basis of their gender; they leave no hints that the ladies were defamed, or at least defamed in any way different from the men.\n\nIt is important, I believe to recognize that Isabeau’s household was not a particular target of misogynistic criticism during its own time, or, at least, nothing indicates that this was the case. This is not to argue that Isabeau’s household was considered to be on a par in terms of power with the king’s. Rather, it is to argue that the queen and her ladies comported themselves in conformity with norms of behavior. And indeed, when Isabeau was not executing her exceptional role on the Royal Council during the king’s “absences,” her household functioned like that of a tradtional queen, mirroring and thereby reinforcing the activity of the king’s household, reproducing the society of men in the society of women, so to speak. One catches a glimpse of this parallel women’s society at work behind such episodes as Froissart’s depiction of the Duchess of Burgundy’s strict monitoring of the queen’s activity after the downfall of the marmousets, as I described above. The duchess was carrying out in Isabeau’s household the actions that corresponded to her husband’s work in the king’s court. Another episode in Froissart offers a similar insight into the way the the societies of men and women parallel each other. The situation occurs just after the fall of the marmousets, as well, and depicts a furious Valentina Visconti, Duchess of Orleans, reacting to the the Duchess of Burgundy who has assumed the place in line just after the queen. The outrage of Valentina when forced to cede to the Duchess of Burgundy can be seen as the corollary within the society of women to the Duke of Orleans’s constant assertions of his priority over the Duke of Burgundy. Froissart describes Valentina giving vent to her anger, insisting that because her husband was in line for the crown just after the king, she, not the Duchess of Burgundy, should follow the queen.103 One further example involving Valentina reinforces the notion of Isabeau’s household as a parallel to the king’s. In 1395, Valentina awards étrennes for the first and only time to Isabeau’s grand maître d’hôtel, Philip de Savoisy, and to seven of her ladies.104 The date corresponds to the drop in support for Valentina’s father, Giangaleazzo Visconti, at the French court.105 Valentina makes an appeal on behalf of her father through the most important members of Isabeau’s household.\n\nBased on his study of the queen’s accounts, Grandeau concludes that her relationship with her ladies was one of great mutual affection. He points out that as far as we know, she was betrayed only once, a reference to the garbled story of intrigue related by Pintoin. This is quite amazing, Grandeau explains, “en cette époque de désordre, où les courtisans impatients, avides, peu soucieux de se compromettre, changeaient de maître, selon le succès des factions” (in this period of disorder, when impatient courtisans, greedy, unwilling to compromise, changed master according to the success of the factions).106 The stability of her personnel, he continues, “alors exceptionnelle, témoigne devant l’histoire de ses vertus. Catherine de Villiers la servit près de trente ans, Amélie de Moy plus de vingt cinq, et vingt quatre Isabelle de Malicorne. Deux et peut-être même trois générations de La Fauconnière lui demeurèrent fidèles.” (exceptional at the time, bears witness to her virtues. Catherine de Villiers served her nearly thirty years, Amélie de Moy over twenty-five, twenty-four for Isabelle de Malicorne. Two or maybe three generations of La Fauconnières were faithful to her.)107\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is agreed that Isabeau was not a depraved woman of insatiable appetites. The evidence to support such an assessment simply does not exist. But this does not mean that her life necessarily must be of interest to historians: of the few historians who have written on the queen, many consider her to be a victim—if an innocent one—of the more powerful players in the Burgundian-Armagnac war, an incompetent and vacillating queen, greedy, and, to put it bluntly, rather stupid, and therefore unworthy of serious attention. Although one cannot really speak of a debate over the queen’s role—for references to her thus far have not been formulated as part of a debate—one can speak of a discussion that has slowly begun to open up over the degree and nature of her role in the political life of her times.\n\nWas Isabeau an active, politically savvy queen? Or was she a toy in the hands of the more powerful Duke of Burgundy, a woman of perhaps mediocre intelligence more inclined to luxury than politics, who would have been happiest as a wife and mother: “La petite Bavaroise aimant son mari, ses enfants, a perdu la tête au milieu de la luxueuse cour de France,” Marie-Véronique Clin writes. “Incapable d’avoir une ligne de conduite politique pour remédier aux maux qui rongent le royaume, elle a accordé sa confiance aux uns, puis aux autres, cherchant toujours à ménager celui des parties qui lui parassait le plus fort.” (The little Bavarian, loving her husband, her children, lost her head in the midst of the luxurious French court. Incapable of implementing a political program to remedy the woes that distressed the kingdom, she put her confidence in first one person and then another, always trying to manipulate the parties that seemed to her to be the strongest.)108\n\nThe verdict on Isabeau is still out, awaiting further study. My goal in this chapter has been to reread and draw together a number of sources to offer a response to the question of what sort of figure she was. I have tried to make the case that Isabeau not only manifested an interest in and a talent for politics before she was forced into a central role by Charles’s madness but that she was also perceived to possess the qualities of an effective mediator. That is, that she was considered to be an intelligent woman and important ally by her many of her contemporaries. Regarded positively as a wife, mother, and queen, Isabeau is, I propose, worthy of further attention."
