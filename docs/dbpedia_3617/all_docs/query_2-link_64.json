        "text": "The Duc de Bourgogne was not a reformist. He was influenced by the DÃ©vots and surrounded by a group of people known as the Faction de Bourgogne. The aristocrats connected to this movement sought a return to a monarchy less absolute and less centralised, with more powers granted to the individual provinces. Their view was that government should work through councils and intermediary organs between the king and the people. These intermediary councils were to be made up not by commoners from the bourgeoisie (like the ministers appointed by Louis XIV) but by aristocrats who perceived themselves as the representatives of the people and would assist the king in governance and the exercise of power.\n\nEssentially somewhat similar to the Polysynodial system used by Philippe d'OrlÃ©ans as IOTL, that sought to govern by councils.\n\nThere's at least one, probably more, old thread on this topic. It boils down to:\n\nle Grand - more of an unknown. Some claim he was an idiot. Some claim he was merely reserved, looking to fly under the radar of a father who didn't like him (or intimidated him). I'm guessing somewhere in between. Regardless of whether he ends up a strong King, or one who delegates to his ministers, there isn't much evidence to say he's going to change the system. Probably just looks to keep chugging along.\n\nle Petite - whether you call it reform, or not, as DrakeRlugia pointed out, he was surrounded/influenced by people who advocated change in gov't. This may not result in reforms to the financial system, or to any number of policies, but with different people/system in charge, France will take a different path. Who knows if that is good, or bad. The aristocrats will act in their own self interest. It's my understanding that Orleans gave concessions to this class to gain backing for his Regency, which was supposed to be held by someone else (duc de Maine?). OTL, the aristocrats refused to go along with anything which cost them, even if it was necessary. A caveat is that history is loaded with folks who are in the opposition while out of power, then do a massive change of direction when they ascend to power. No guarantee le Petite continues his Dauphin line of thinking.\n\nle Grand is probably closer to XIV. le Petite closer to Orleans.\n\nI'm guessing the big changes will come from butterflies.\n\nOrleans pivoted away from Philip V/Spain, and toward Britain. The alt V's likely remain closer to Philip.\n\nDepending on the POD, le Petit's family may also be alive. His wife was competent, and is likely a stabilizing influence. His oldest son living displaces OTL V out of the ruling picture altogether. At minimum, OTL V isn't thrust onto the throne as a toddler, and may develop a personality more suited to ruling.\n\nDifferent people in charge may mean different approaches to world events/wars. There is likely different marriages of importance. le Petit having add'l offspring/daughters mean other countries get different Queens/heirs. For example, if Carlos III of Spain gets a French (or different) bride, the line of idiots he sired may not be such idiots. Or, without a Regency to aspire to, Philip V may not abdicate, putting his son/heir, Louis I, in a different location, meaning he doesn't catch smallpox and die. This shakes up Spain's future."
