        "text": "So I have always found it fascinating how one family can twist and turn between different states and how each family evolves into the different titles. Not only does this happen in England between the inter-marring. Last night I sat and just jumped between families on Wikipedia (there are other source sites) and was jumping around the different modern countries of Europe and their titles through history. So I have decided to chart one of these families through the male line and see where I end up.\n\nNow I thought about where to start with this and there a lots of different possibilities and I am sure I will do this again for other lines. So I have picked a line that still exists today we will start with with Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg.\n\nHenri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg – was born 16th April 1955. He is the son of Grand Duke Jean and Princess Josephine-Charlotte of Belgium and the current nephew of the King of Belgium, Albert III. He is married to Maria Teresa Mestre y Batista-Falla who through a female line is a direct descendent of Ferdinand I of Leon and Castile. Henri, became the Grand Duke on the abdication of his father on 7th October 2000. Also as part of his titles he is the Duke of Nassau and Count Palatine of the Rhine.\n\nJean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg – born 5th January 1921. He was the son of Prince Felix of Bourbon-Parma and Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg. Pope Benedict XV was one of his godparents. He became the Grand Duke upon the abdication of his mother Charlotte. He married Princess Josephine-Charlotte of Belgium.\n\nPrince Felix of Bourbon-Parma – born in 1893, son of Robert I, Duke of Parma and Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal, making him the grandson of the exiled King of Portugal, Miguel I. He was also the younger brother of Empress Zita of Austria.\n\nRobert I, Duke of Parma – was the son of Charles III, Duke of Parma and Louise Marie Therese d’Artois. Robert married twice having 24 children. First he married Maria Pia of the Two Sicilies daughter of Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies. His second wife was Maria Antonia of Portugal. Some of the 24 chidren married into the Royal families of Denmark, Luxembourg, Bulgaria and Austria.\n\nCharles III, Duke of Parma – was born 14th January 1823 to Charles II, Duke of Parma and Princess Maria Teresa of Sacoy. He married Louis Maria Therese of France the granddaughter of King Charles X of France.\n\nCharles II, Duke of Parma – was born 22nd December 1799. He was the son of Louis, King of Eturia. Eturia was a small short lived kingdom (1801-1807)based around modern day Tuscany. Charles’ mother was Maria Luisa of Spain, Duchess of Lucca. She was the daughter of King Charles IV of Spain. At different points in his life he could call himself King of Eturia (1803-1807), Duke of Lucca (1824-1847) and Duke of Parma (1847-1849).\n\nLous, King of Etruria – born on 5th July 1773 to Ferdinand, Duke of Parma and Maria Amalia of Austria his maternal grandfather was Francis I, Holy Roman Empire.\n\nFerdinand, Duke of Parma – born 20th January 1751. His parents where Philip. Duke of Parma and Louise Elizabeth of France. Again our maternal grandfather is a king in their own right. This time it is Louis XV, King of France.

Eldest son of Louis XIV, King of France and Maria Theresa of Spain. He was first married to Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria and then secondly to Marie Emilie de Joly de Choin. His second marriage to Marie Emilie was held in secret and was never officially recognised Louis did not make it to King of France as his farther outlived him by four years.\n\nLouis XIV, King of France and Navarre – was also known as the ‘Sun King’. He reigned for 72 years and 110 days. Louis was born on 5th September 1638 and lived till 1st September 1715. His father was Louis XIII and his mother was Anne of Austria, the daughter of Philip III and II, of Spain and Portugal. He first married Maria Theresa of Spain and secondly Francois d’Aubigne.\n\nLouis XIII, King of France and Navarre – he was born on 27th September 1601 and his parents were Henry IV, King of France and Marie de Medici. He married just once, which over the last hundred or so years seems against the norm for our male line. He was married to Anne of Austria on 24th November 1615.\n\nHenry IV, King of France amd Navarre – was the first French monarch of the House of Bourbon. He was born on 13th December 1553 in Pau, Kingdom of Navarre. His parents were Antoine de Bourbon and Jeanne III, of Narvarre.

He was created Count of Clermont in 1268. He married Beatrix of Burgundy. Robert is classed by many as the founder of the House of Bourbon, which we have seen is steeped in a rich ancestry.\n\nLouis IX, King of France – was canonised as Saint Louis. He was born on 25th April 1214 and his parents were Louis VIII, King of France and Blanche of Castile. Blanche was the daughter of Alfonso VIII, King of Castile and Eleanor of England.

Unlike his son and grandson he only married twice. First to Luicenne de Rochefort and secondly to Adelaide of Maurienne. He was also known as Louis the Fat.\n\nPhilip I, King of the Franks – was the son of Henry I, King of the Franks and Anne of Kiev. Anne’s father was Yaroslav I, Grand Prince of Rus. Philip married twice, first to Bertha of Holland and secondly to Bertrade de Montfort. He reigned as King of the Franks from 1060 till his death in 1108.\n\nHenry I, King of the Franks – was born in 4th May 1008. Son of Robert II, King of the Franks and Constance of Arles. He married three times, searching far on each occasion for his wives. Firstly he married Matilda of Franconia, then another Matilda this time from Frisia. Thirdly he married Anne of Kiev.\n\nRobert II, King of the Franks – was also called the Pious and Wise. He was born 27th March 972 to Hugh Capet and Adelaide of Aquitaine. It seemed to be the fashion of the time for Frankish kings to marry three times and Robert was no different. He married Rozalla of Italy, Bertha of Burgundy and Constance of Arles.\n\nHugh Capet, King of the Franks – was the first King of the Franks of the Capetian dynasty from his election to succeed the Caroligian Louis V. He was born c.939. His parents were Hugh the Great, Duke of the Franks and Hedwige of Saxony. Hedwige was the daughter of Henry I the Fowler, Duke of Saxony and King of Germany. Her brother Otto, became Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nHugh the Great, Duke of Franks, Count of Paris – was born in 898 in Paris. His parents were Robert I, King of Western Francia and Beatrice of Vermandois. He married three times. Firstly to Judith of Maine, then Eadhid of England and finally to Hedwige of Saxony.\n\nRobert I, King of Western Francia – was born 15th August 866.

He died at the battle near Soissons against the Carolingian king Charles the Simple.\n\nRobert the Strong, Margrave of Neustria – was also known as Rupert. He was the son of Robert of Worms and Wiltrud of Orleans. He died in 866 at the Battle of Brissarthe against a joint Breton-Viking attack.\n\nRobert III, Count of Worms and Rheingau – lived between 800 and 834. His father was Robert of Hesbaye.\n\nRobert II, Count of Worms and Rheingau – is the earliest known male line ancestor of the French royal family. There is a possible ancestry of Robert but it is not totally confirmed.\n\nThe possible ancestry of Robert is as follows; it is believed his father was the likely son of Thuingbert of Worms and Rheingau and grandson of Robert I, Duke of Neistria (c. 697-764). It is known that the paternal ancestors of Robert I ascended in line as follows:\n\nLambert II, Count of Haspengau (c. 682-741), Chrodobertus II, Count of Haspengau (fl. 650), Lambert I de Haspengau (c. 620-650), Chrodobertus I de Haspengau (c. 600-630), Charibert de Hasoengau (c. 555-636).\n\nSo there we are almost 1500 years of the male line back from the current Grand Duke of Luxembourg. We have seen, the Dukes of Parma, two different royal houses of France, a King of Spain and Kings of Naverre plus different important families around France and slightly further afield. A marriages into numerous different royal families, even as far a field as Kiev and the Grand Princes of Rus. I must say thou that the most fascinating part of the whole list is the fact that in the 15th Century, we went full circle and had a member from the House of Luxembourg marrying into the male line.\n\nSo the last burning question is……who’s next?\n\nInstead of adding pictures to the blog post I am going to add them to the facebook page over the next day or two.
