        "text": "Francia Orientalis, Germany\n\nThe Stem Duchies & Marches\n\nThe Stem Duchies (Stammesherzogtümer) of Germany were essentially the domains of the old German tribes of the area. These tribes were originally the Franks, the Saxons, the Alemanni, the Burgundians, the Thuringians, and the Rugians. In the 5th century the Burgundians moved into Roman territory and were settled in 443 and 458 in the area that would then become Burgundy. The area they had occupied in Germany, next to the Franks and the Saxons, was occupied by the Franks. When the Rugians were destroyed by Odoacer in 487, a new confederation of Germans formed in their place, the Bavarians.\n\nAll these tribes in Germany were eventually subjugated by the Franks: the Alemanni in 496 and 505, the Thuringians in 531, the Bavarians at some point after 553, and then finally the Saxons, in a protracted campaign by Charlemagne himself, by 804. When Germany eventually separated as East Francia, the old tribal areas assumed new identities as the subdivisions of the realm, joining Lorraine (properly Francia Media). For the rulers of these, the old Roman title of Dux (\"leader\") was adopted. It was originally used for a Roman frontier military commander and subsequently was passed down in Greek, i.e. in Mediaeval Romania, as δούξ.\n\nIn German, however, the corresponding title, Herzog, looks more like a \"calque,\" a borrowing by translation, of a Greek title, stratêlatês, στρατηλάτης, \"army\" (stratos) \"leader\" (elaunein, \"to lead\"). Thus, the Old High German title was herizoho, from heri, \"army,\" and ziohan, \"to lead.\" This also looks very much like a comparable title, voivode, perhaps also a calque, in Slavic languages. This would seem to reflect the contemporary influence of Romania, rather than some continuity or influence from previous local Roman practice.\n\nOn analogy with the German tribes, \"duke\" was at first used elsewhere for ethnic demi-states, like Brittany and Gascony, and then later as the title for Royal brothers in France, such as the Dukes of Burgundy, and England, beginning with the sons of Edward III -- with the Dukes of Lancaster and York disputing the Throne in the Wars of the Roses. \"Duke\" as a serious title of independent rule continued mainly in Germany. The Saxon area became Saxony, the Bavarian, Bavaria, the Thuringian, Thuringia, the Frankish, Franconia, and the Alemannian, Swabia. To these could be added the Czech domain of Bohemia, which accepted German suzerainty as a Duchy (one of the ethnic demi-states) by 925, later upgraded to a Kingdom in 1158.\n\nNorth and South of Bohemia, the Germans headed east, founding a series of March Counties, or Marches, whose ruler was thus a Margrave (Mark Graf). In the North these started with Meißen and Lusatia. North of them was, appropriately, the North March, which became Brandenburg and then Prussia. Last in the north was originally the March of the Billungers, which eventually became the Duchies of Holstein, Lauenburg, Mecklenburg, and (Hither) Pomerania. In the south, there was Carniola, Carinthia, Styria, and the East March, the Österreich (\"eastern kingdom\"), or Austria. The future dominant states of Germany, Prussia and Austria, thus began as Marches. On the map shown, the eastern frontier is that of about 1200, which is curiously similar to the boundary today between Germany and Poland. At the time, Poland was already an organized and Christian Kingdom. German advance beyond that point was mainly by the extension of Pomerania, originally effected by Denmark, and by Bohemia's detachment of Silesia from Poland. Silesia then passed, with Bohemia, ultimately to Austria, then to Prussia, finally returned to Poland by Josef Stalin in 1945 -- although it turns out this was suggested by Winston Churchill, to compensate the Poles for the territories retained in the East by Stalin.\n\nDukes of Franconia\n\nCounts, Dukes, & Princes of Nassau Lords, Counts, & Prince of Layen/Leyen Landgraves, Electors, & Grand Dukes of Hesse\n\nLandgraves & Electors of Hesse-Cassel\n\nThe Rothschilds\n\nLandgraves & Grand Dukes of Hesse-Darmstadt Landgraves of Hesse-Homburg\n\nDukes, Electors, & Kings of Saxony\n\nCounts & Princes of Schwarzburg Lords, Counts, & Princes of Reuß Dukes of Brunswick, Electors & Kings of Hanover\n\nDukes of Brunswick- Wolfenbüttel\n\nCounts, Dukes, & Grand Dukes of Oldenburg Lords, Counts, & Princes of Lippe Counts & Princes of Waldeck Princes & Dukes of Anhalt Counts & Dukes of Berg, Jülich, Mark, & Cleves Princes of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn\n\nDukes & Landgraves of Thuringia\n\nMargraves of Meißen\n\nDukes of Swabia\n\nAlsace/Elsaß Counts, Dukes & Kings of Württemberg Margraves & Grand Dukes of Baden The Descent of the Hohenzollern Princes of Hohenzollern Henchingen-Sigmaringen Princes of Liechtenstein The Swiss Confederation\n\nDukes, Electors, & Kings of Bavaria\n\nWittelsbach Dukes & Electors Counts & Prince Electors of the Palatinate Kings of Bavaria\n\nLorraine\n\nDukes of Lorraine\n\nCounts & Dukes of Bar\n\nCounts & Dukes of Berg, Jülich, Mark, & Cleves Counts & Dukes of Luxemburg Counts of Hainault Counts of Holland Stadholders and Kings of the Netherlands Kings of Belgium Grand Dukes of Luxembourg\n\nMarches\n\nDukes of Carinthia Margraves & Dukes of Austria\n\nHapsburg Dukes of Austria\n\nMargraves & Electors of Brandenburg & Kings of Prussia\n\nHohenzollern Margraves & Electors of Brandenburg Kings of Prussia\n\nMargraves of Meißen Princes, Dukes, & Grand Dukes of Mecklenburg Counts & Dukes of Schleswig & Holstein Dukes of Pomerania\n\nThe greatest houses of German Emperors were associated with particular Duchies: the Saxons, the Franconians (Salians), and the Swabians (Hohenstaufen).\n\nOf the original Stem Duchies, only Bavaria really survived largely intact, though the others sometimes had successor states that nearly reassembled the original domains, like Baden and Württemberg in Swabia and Hanover in Saxony.\n\nThese lists originally were often compiled exclusively from Brian Tompsett's Royal and Noble Genealogy and Bruce R. Gordon's Regnal Chronologies. Much of this has now been corrected and expanded, however, with information from Michael F. Feldkamp's Regentenlisten und Stammtafeln zur Geschischte Europas [Philipp Reclam, Stuttgart, 2002] and, most especially, from Andreas Thiele's Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, Volume I, Parts 1 & 2, Deutsche Kaiser-, Königs-, Herzogs- und Grafenhäuser I & II [Third Edition, R. G. Fischer Verlag, 1997], Volume II, Parts 1 & 2, Europäiche Kaiser-, Königs- und Fürstenhäuser I Westeuropa & II Nord-, Ost- und Südeuropa [Part 1, Third Edition, 2001, Part 2, Second Edition, R. G. Fischer Verlag, 1997], and Volume III, Europäiche Kaiser-, Königs- und Fürstenhäuser, Ergänzungsband [Second Edition, R. G. Fischer Verlag, 2001]. Other sources are listed with the tables or elsewhere. The map above is based on p.142 of The Anchor Atlas of World History, Volume I (Hermann Kinder, Werner Hilgemann, Ernest A. Menze, and Harald and Ruth Bukor, 1974). The cited map is labeled, \"Central Europe at the time of the Saxon emperors,\" which is a little confusing, since the northern frontier is much advanced beyond what was achieved for the dates given, e.g. 937-982. The text simply says, \"936-7 Organization of the marches under HERMANN BILLUNG and the margrave GERO...\" (p.143). Gero was the Margrave of the North March (later Brandenburg). The area to the north may have been assigned to Billung himself, since the map labels it the \"March of the Billungers,\" but they apparently made little headway at the time, and the name did not stick.\n\nGerman Confederation Index\n\nFrancia Index\n\nPhilosophy of History\n\nHome Page\n\nDukes of Franconia BogoCount Eberhard I Udo861-879 Eberhard IId.901 Conrad Ic.906-911 King,\n\n911-918 Eberhard III911-939 Conrad the Younger1024-1030 Conrad VI,\n\nII of Germany1024-1039 Emperor,\n\n1024-1039 Henry,\n\nIII of Germany1039-1056 Emperor,\n\n1039-1056 Henry,\n\nIV of Germany1056-1076 Emperor,\n\n1056-1106 Conrad VII,\n\nII of Lorraine1076-1088 Lorraine,\n\n1076-1087 Frederick I\n\nof Swabia1079-1105 Conrad I,\n\nIII of Germany1105-1138 Emperor,\n\n1138-1152 Henry1138-1150 Frederick II1150-1167 Conrad II1167-1196\n\nSince Franconia is the area of Germany specific to the Franks, around whom Western Europe was unified, with Frankfurt (now Frankfurt-am-Main) as the city long recognized as the capital of Germany, it is disappointing that the list of Dukes seems defective and poorly dated. Since Gordon's list jumps from Conrad I to Conrad VI of Franconia (with an unnumbered \"Conrad the Younger\"), one is left to suspect that more is known about some other Conrads.\n\nThe Fraconian Emperors are often called the \"Salians,\" after the Salian (or Salic) Franks, the sub-group of the Franks that became dominant. This term also turns up in the \"Salic Law,\" the principle that succession cannot pass through women, which was observed in Germany and France but mostly not elsewhere. The Salian Franks, however, were called that because they lived near the sea (salus = \"salt\"). The inland Franks belonged to several other groups, which collectively could be called the \"Ripuarians,\" i.e. \"river\" Franks. Franconia was really a Ripuarian, not a Salian, area.\n\nFranconia split into countless states, like Hesse and Nassau. Frankfurt was a Free City until annexed by Prussia in 1866.\n\nStem Duchies Index\n\nFrancia Index\n\nCounts, Dukes, & Princes of Nassau Walram I1st Count\n\nof Nassau,\n\n1151-1198 Henry II the Rich1198-1247\n\nd.c.1251 Walram II1247-1255Otto I1247-1255 Count of\n\nNassau-\n\nWeilburg,\n\n1255-1277Count of\n\nNassau-\n\nDillenburg,\n\n1255-1290 Adolph I1277-1298Henry I1290-1343 Emperor,\n\n1291-1298Nassau-\n\nSiegen\n\n1303-1343 Rupert IV1298-1304,\n\nd.1308Nassau-\n\nDillenburg\n\n1328-1343 Gerlach I1298-1355,\n\nd.1361Emich I1290-1303 Walram III1298-1322Nassau-\n\nHadamar\n\n1303-1334 Adolph II1344-1355John1290-1303 Count of\n\nNassau-\n\nWiesbaden-\n\nIdstein,\n\n1355-1370Nassau-\n\nDillenburg\n\n1303-1328 Nassau-Weilburg-\n\nSaarbrücken from 1355Nassau-Dillenburg John I1344-1371Otto II1343-1350 Weilburg\n\n1355-1371 RupertSonnenberg\n\n1355-1390John I1350-1416 Philip I1371-1429 Nassau-Weilburg from 1442Adolph1416-1420 Philip II1429-1492John II1420-1443 Engelbert I1420-1442 John III1420-1429 John IV1442-1475 Henry II1442-1451 Engelbert II1475-1504 Louis I1492-1523John V1475-1516 Philip III1523-1559Nassau-Breda Henry III1516-1538 René1538-1544 Prince of\n\nOrange\n\n1530-1544 Nassau-Dillenburg William the Rich1544-1559 Nassau-\n\nDillenburg\n\n1516-1559 Albert1559-1593Nassau-Orange William I the Silent1559-1584 Netherlands\n\n1568-1584 Philip IV1559-1602Philip William1584-1618 Louis II1593-1625MauriceNetherlands\n\n1587-1625 William Louis1625-16291618-1625 Nassau-\n\nSaarbrücken\n\n1629-1640Frederick Henry1625-1647 John IV1625-1629William II1647-1650 Nassau-\n\nIdstein\n\n1629-1668William IIINetherlands\n\n1672-1702 Ernest Casimir1625-1655England\n\n1689-1702 Frederick1655-16751650-1674 John ErnestWiesbaden\n\n1675-1719Dillenburg & Orange\n\nceded to Nassau-Dietz, 1674 Frederick WilliamWeilburg\n\n1675-1684Nassau-Dietz Henry Casimir IIPrince of\n\nNassau-\n\nDietz\n\n1662-1696 1674-1696 Charles Augustus1719-1753Nassau-Orange John William FrisoNetherlands\n\n1702-1711 1696-1711 William IV1711-1751 Charles Christian1753-1788William V Batavus1751-1806 Frederick William1788-1816William VI,\n\nI of Netherlands1806-1813 WilliamDuke of\n\nNassau\n\n1816-1839King,\n\n1813-1843 Adolph1839-1866German lands ceded\n\nto Nassau-Weilburg, 1815;\n\nHouse of Orange\n\ncontinued in Netherlands Grand Duke of\n\nLuxembourg\n\n1890-1905 Nassau annexed by Prussia, 1866\n\nNassau remained a complex domain until into the 19th century. The county of Nassau was divided in 1255 (\"prima divisio\") by Walram and Otto, sons of Count Henry II the Rich. Walram was the founder of the Walramian line, ruling in Weilburg, Idstein, Wiesbaden, etc., i.e. the Nassauian lands south of the river Lahn. Otto was the founder of the Ottonian line, ruling in Dillenburg, Hadamar, Beilstein, later also in Siegen and in Diez, i.e. the Nassauian lands north of the river Lahn.\n\nAt the Congress of Vienna, there were still the Duchy of Nassau and the Principalities of Usingen and Nassau-Weilburg. The Orange (Ottonian) branch of the family, which had acquired leadership and then sovereignty in the Netherlands, ceded its German lands to the Walramian line at the Congress. In short order the German lands fell to a single line, with the death of Frederick Augustus, Prince of Usingen and Duke of Nassau. Only the line of Nassau-Weilburg is shown on the Walramian side of the table at left, but some parallel lines, including Usingen, are detailed in the genealogical table below.\n\nThe final Duke of Nassau, Adolph, ran afoul of Prussia by picking Austria in the Seven Weeks' War of 1866. Nassau was annexed to Prussia. But then, when Queen Wilhelmina was excluded from the succession to Luxembourg by the Salic Law, the Grand Duchy passed to the dispossessed Duke Adolph. Luxembourg, even with Grand Duchesses, has been in the line of Adolph ever since.\n\nThe succession was initially assembled from Bruce R. Gordon's Regnal Chronologies. The genealogy at Brian Tompsett's Royal and Noble genealogy was too incomplete to use -- the line of Nassau could not be traced back from Adolph of Nassau and Luxembourg. The genealogy below has now been assembled from the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, Volume I, Part 2, Deutsche Kaiser-, Königs-, Herzogs- und Grafenhäuser II [Andreas Thiele, Third Edition, R. G. Fischer Verlag, 1997]. That contains all of Nassau except for the initial Dutch line of Orange-Nassau. This is covered in Volume II, Part 1, Europäiche Kaiser-, Königs- und Fürstenhäuser I Westeuropa [Andreas Thiele, R. G. Fischer Verlag, Second Edition, 1997]. It should be noted that the initial line of Orange-Nassau ended with William III. His cousins of Nassau-Diez(/Dietz) were already Stadholders of Friesland, and they then inherited the title of Orange and the larger role as candidates for Stadholder of the Netherlands. Here, the genealogy of both Dutch lines is given with the Netherlands.\n\nA key event in the history of the Ottonian line is marriage with the heiress, Claudia, of the Principality of Orange. This small state was far from Germany, a fief of Burgundy, surrounded by the Papal enclave of Avignon, whose Princes recently derived from the Free Counts of Burgundy. This did not involve any material addition of power to the House of Nassau, but the title, passing to William the Silent, quickly became symbolic of the Netherlands, which William came to lead in its struggle for independence from Spain. Long after Orange itself fell to France, in 1715, the name, indeed the color, is thought of as essentially Dutch. The subsequent genealogy of Nassau-Orange is found under the Netherlands. The main line of Orange-Nassau died out with William III, but the leadership of the Netherlands then passed to his cousins, who had become the Stadholders of Friesland. In both the Netherlands and Luxembourg, the male lines eventually failed. In the Netherlands the houses of Mecklenburg, Lippe, and Amsberg, and in Luxembourg the house of Bourbon, provided the husbands.\n\nStem Duchies Index\n\nGerman Confederation Index\n\nFrancia Index\n\nLandgraves, Electors, & Grand Dukes of Hesse Henry I the Child of BrabantLandgrave,\n\n1263-1298 OttoMarburg\n\n1298-1328JohnCassel\n\n1298-1311 Henry II the Iron1328-1377Louis IGrubenstein\n\n1328-1343Herman INordeck\n\n1328-1367 Herman II the Learned1377-1413 Louis II the Peaceful1413-1458 Louis IIICassel\n\n1458-1471Henry IIIMarburg\n\n1458-1483 William I the Elder1471-1493,\n\nd. 1515William II the Intermediate1471-1509William III the Younger1483-1500 Philip I the Magnanimous1509-1567, Protestant leader William IVCassel\n\n1567-1592George IDarmstadt\n\n1567-1597\n\nHesse begins in the middle of interesting marriages. The first marriage of Henry III of Lower Lorraine and Brabant was to Marie of Hohenstauften, daughter of Philip of Swabia and Irene Angelina, daughter of the Emperor Isaac II Angelus. By this marriage the line of the Comneni and Angeli enters much European royalty. But Henry contracted a second marriage. This was to Sophie of Thuringia, daughter of the Landgrave Louis VI. While Henry's son, Henry, from his first marriage succeeded to Brabant, his son from his second marriage, also Henry, was endowed with the Landgravate of Hesse. The domain underwent various divisions and recombinations. Finally, the two sons of Philip the Magnanimous, one of the leaders of the Protestant Reformation, founded two durable divisions, Hesse-Cassel and Hesse-Darmstadt. George, the first of the line of Hesse-Darmstadt, also had a son, Frederick, who founded a third line, Hesse-Homburg. Hesse-Cassel and Hesse-Homburg were annexed by Prussia in 1866, while Hesse-Darmstadt survived, under the German Empire, until the end of World War I.\n\nThe genealogy here is from the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, Volume I, Part 2, Deutsche Kaiser-, Königs-, Herzogs- und Grafenhäuser II [Andreas Thiele, Third Edition, R.

When the Empire was abolished in 1806, the Elector chose to remain an Elector, with or without an Empire. In 1807, however, the area was annexed to France. When the Elector recovered it in 1813, he preserved the previous title. This curious institution survived until the Elector, still without his Empire, chose the wrong side in 1866 and Hesse-Cassel was annexed by Prussia. Earlier, one of the line, Frederick, ended up a King of Sweden, but with no issue, nothing came of it. There are living heirs of this line today.\n\nHesse turns up, curiously, in the history of the American Revolution, since Hessian troups were hired out to King George III and sent to fight against the colonists. George Washington captured many of them at Trenton in 1776.\n\nThe Rothschilds\n\nThe Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, William IX (1785-1803), who became William I, the first Elector of Hesse-Cassel (1803-1807, 1813-1821) would be remembered as the patron of the Rothschild Family. Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744-1812) was a minor merchant in the Jewish Ghetto (on the Judengasse) of the Imperial City of Frankfurt-am-Main (a Free City in 1815), adjacent to Hesse-Cassel. Mayer found coins and other valuables for the Landgrave. A mythology grew up that when William had to flee Napoleon in 1807, he entrusted his movable wealth to Mayer and his sons, who then returned it, with interest, when William returned in 1813, securing the Elector's firm trust and patronage from then on.\n\nThis story would later be promoted by the Rothschilds themselves, but it was only partially true. William entrusted his wealth to many. This included Mayer, but not exclusively; and the Rothschild share was not even predominant. Instead, the real source of Rothschild hegemony began when Mayer sent his son Nathan to Britain, by 1800, to get more closely involved with the textile trade and business. This meant that Nathan went to Manchester. Soon, however, both Mayer and Nathan began moving to banking and finance, which meant than Nathan relocated to London. Eventually, the five sons of Mayer spread out across Europe, founding branch banking houses, with Salomon in Vienna, James in Paris, and, curiously, Carl in Naples, while Amschel, the eldest, stayed in Frankfurt after the death of Mayer in 1812. Naples now does not sound like a great financial capital, but in 1821 Carl followed Austrian armies, financed by the Rothschilds, who restored the Bourbons after a local uprising.\n\nThat actually reveals a lot about the nature of the Rothschild business. They may have been providing some start-up captial for entrepreneurs, but the major part of their practice was getting money for governments.\n\nNolite confidere in principibus.\n\nPut not your trust in Princes. Psalms 146:3\n\nSeptuagint 145:3, Vulgate 145:2\n\nSo we cannot see them in quite the same way that we see the financier Jay Gould (1836-1892), for instance, who made his money buying and selling railroads, gold, etc. In the Napoleonic period the services of the Rothschilds had included moving subsidies from Britain to her allies -- including money to the Duke of Wellington campaigning in Spain, which subsequently made the Duke a political ally (until he failed to follow up Catholic with Jewish Emancipation) -- but then afterwards it was almost all a matter of floating bonds and other instruments to finance governments. This had always been a perilous business. The Emperor Charles V (retired, 1556) had relied on bankers like the Fuggers of Augsburg, whom he nearly bankrupted; and Spain after Charles had defaulted on its debt in 1557, 1575, 1596, 1607, 1627, and 1647, despite all the silver of Mexico and Peru. The success of the Rothschilds, dealing with governments from Britain to France to Russia, and everything in between, is testimony to their prudent judgment, and luck, although they certainly had some close calls, and many rivals. One advantage was that the Five Houses of the Rothschild business, and the solidarity of the brothers, made for a mutually supporting structure.\n\nWhat we might regard as the relative insignificance of Naples as a banking center is born out by the early demise of the house there, in 1863, shortly after the overthrow of the Bourbon kingdom (1860) and the unification of Italy (1861). A similar fate awaited the original Frankfurt house. While it was a coincidence that the Rothschild's derived from the Frankfurt Ghetto, Frankfurt was for a long time an important place in its own right, holding such a status as would have existed as the capital of the Holy Roman Empire (shared with Regensburg, Casta Regina, where the Imperial Diet sat from 1663, but passing to Bavaria in 1810), where Emperors were elected and, sometimes, installed -- although never residing there.\n\nThe Saxon Emperor Henry II, and the Salian Emperors\n\nConrad II, Henry III, Henry IV, & Henry V;\n\nThe Römer Kaisersaal, Frankurt-am-Main\n\nThe Town Hall (Rathaus) of Frankfurt is called the Römer, i.e. the \"Romans\" (although this may have just been the family name of the owners of the original building), and it contains the Kaisersaal, or the \"Emperors Hall,\" where an inauguration feast was held for the Emperor Matthias in 1612. The Hall now holds 52 portraits, of all the Holy Roman Emperors from Charlemagne to Francis II, although these only date from the early 19th century, and their quality is uneven. There were also busts, but these were destroyed by Allied bombing in World War II.\n\nJames Bryce, in The Holy Roman Empire [1904, Schocken Books, 1961, 1964], gives us a nice anecdote about the paintings:\n\nGOETHE has described the uneasiness with which, in the days of his childhood, the burghers of his native Frankfort [sic] saw the walls of the Roman Hall covered with the portraits of Emperor after Emperor, till space was left for a few, at last for one. In A.D. 1792 Francis the Second mounted the throne of Augustus, and the last place was filled. [p.408]\n\nThis makes it sound like the portraits date from the 18th, not just the 19th, century, at least. And we might want to say that the \"throne\" mounted by the German Emperors was not exactly that of \"Augustus\" -- more like Charlemagne, at best -- and the portraits include no actual Romans. And Bryce adds in the footnote to this passage:\n\nThe Römer Saal is still one of the sights of Frankfort. The portraits, however, which one now sees in it, seem to be all or nearly all of them modern; and few have any merit as works of art. [ibid.]\n\nDepending on what Bryce means by \"modern,\" we might wonder if some of the paintings of Goethe's youth may have been replaced, explaining references that the portraits only date from the early 19th century, rather long after his \"childhood.\"\n\nWith the demise of the Empire, Frankfurt became the formal capital of the German Confederation, and what was intended as a German National Parliament met there in 1848. The failure of German Republicanism, however, also meant the eclipse of the significance of Frankfurt. Once the new German Empire formed around Prussia, and Berlin became the center of govenment and finance, the Frankfurt Rothschild house was distant from the center of German events. It was closed in 1901, leaving Rothschild banks in London, Paris, and Vienna. Curiously, while Frankfurt might have been revived as the Cold War capital of West Germany, the obscure site of Bonn was chosen instead, perhaps to facilitate a move back to Berlin at reunification, which is what happened. Meanwhile, the Kaisersaal continues to host public events, rarely of national significance.\n\nNathan's London bank began to become a factor in British politics. His son Lionel was elected to the British Parliament in 1847 but was not seated because he could not take the oath of office as a Christian. It was not until 1858 that the House of Lords agreed that the Commons could decide on its own oath, which was altered so that Lionel could be seated. Benjamin Disraeli, himself a converted Jew, welcomed Lionel as the first Jew to be seated in Parliament -- although others of Jewish ancestry, like Disraeli, had been seated. The determination of the Rothschilds to avoid conversion and to adhere faithfully to Judaism encouraged Jews and embarrassed or angered others, not the least, of course, including anti-Semites, whose activities, particularly in France, Russia, and Germany, became increasingly alarming.\n\nA few years later, in 1875, Disraeli was Prime Minister, and the collapse of Egyptian finances led to an offer of all Egypt's shares in the Suez Canal Company to Britain. This famously involved Disraeli soliciting a loan from no less than Lionel Rothschild, for £4 million. Lionel asked what the security or collateral for the loan would be, and Disraeli answered that it would be no more and no less than the full faith and credit of the British Government. That was good enough, although the Liberals complained that such a loan had not been authorized by Parliament. And so we find the Rothschilds, still, providing money to governments -- which in this case led to Britain occupying Egypt in 1882, and becoming the de facto ruler of the country until after World War II -- during which the British fought epic battles with the Germans -- commanded by Erwin Rommel -- out in the desert. The Suez Crisis of 1956 ended British involvement with the Canal.\n\nThe diagram below of the genealogy of the Rothschilds is based on the diagram in The House of Rothschild, Money's Prophets, 1798-1848, by Niall Ferguson [Penguin, 1998, 1999, pp.xviii-xxi]. The same diagram occurs in Volume 2 of the history, The House of Rothschild, The World's Banker, 1849-1999 [Penguin, 1998, 2000, pp.xvi-xix]. The diagram here is one of the most tangled of any of the genealogies in the history pages of the Proceedings of the Friesian School. But the diagram does not even have the full detail of Ferguson's. The tangle is largely the result of the intermarriage among about the first three generations of Rothschilds. Mostly this is marriage between cousins, but we also get the marriage of elder brother James to own niece, Betty. This is what got the Hapsburgs into so much genetic trouble, when Philip II of Spain married his niece, Anne of Austria. The Rothschilds seemed to avoid the worst of those consequences, and now exogamy has been the rule for many years.\n\nTo try and make the diagram more readable, I have color-coded and numbered the lines of descent from the five sons of Mayer Amschel Rothschild. Numbered \"1,\" in brown, is the eldest son, Amschel, in Frankfurt, who, however, had no children. Numbered \"2,\" in blue, is the lineage of the third son, Nathan, who is given \"2\" because he founded the first Rothschild House outside Germany, in London. Numbered \"3,\" in red, is the lineage of Salomon, the second son, in Vienna. Numbered \"4,\" in green, is the lineage of Carl, in Naples. And finally, numbered \"5,\" in purple, is the lineage of James, the youngest son, in Paris. The loss of intuitive detail here the most regretable is that it is difficult to see which generation of the family we are looking at in each case. There is a prominance of the blue of the London House because Nathan was pretty much the dominant brother of the Rothschild partnership and because of the continued prominence of the English family, which included material involvement in Jewish Emancipation in Britain (1858) and the elevation of Nathan's grandson to the Peerage (1885). There is now also the marriage of Nathan's great-great-great-great-grandson James, to Nicholai \"Nicky\" Hilton, with two children. In the diagram, male and female Rothschilds are indicated in the familiar way, with color and number for their lineage. The lineages can be followed with the appropriately colored lines, which, because of the marriages, shoot from one side of the diagram to the other.\n\nWhy the intermarriage? The explanation of Ferguson seems reasonable. Spread out over Europe, intermarriage kept the relationships of the family close, which meant that the relationship of the business partners was kept close. The formal Partners, in turn, were required to be men in the male lines of descent from the original five brothers. Women were not going to be Partners, which is not too surprising for the time, place, and religion, but this also meant that mere in-laws were shut out. Some resented this; but this was clearly a device, not just to keep the family and partnerships close, but so that the name \"Rothschild\" was always be born by the Partners. You deal with the Rothschild bank, and you will deal with actual Rothschilds. None of this business of John Kerry living off the fortune of the Heinz family, which had been acquired by his wife in her previous marriage. We might wonder if, with his French palate, he even uses Heinz ketchup. The name has also been a point with the Fords, who have liked to say that you can meet someone named \"Ford\" at their company, while there is no \"Mr. General Motors\" at General Motors. The Japanese auto maker Isuzu used this for humorous effect in their classic \"Joe Isuzu\" advertising campaign.\n\nEventually, not only was there exogamy but also marriages to Christians, not always accompanied by Rothschild conversion. Especially noteworthy is the marriage of Lionel's niece Hannah Rothschild to the Earl of Rosebery, who was briefly Prime Minister of Great Britain (1894-1895) -- unfortunately after Hannah had died. Hannah never converted to Christianity, attended synagogue, observed Jewish holidays, and was buried in a Jewish cemetery -- although her four children, who were born Jewish by virtue of a Jewish mother, were raised Christian. This was Scottish nobility, and the family seat is still near Edinburgh -- Scottish nobility that now continues with Rothschild and, for that matter, Cohen, , ancestry. A long way from the Frankfurt Judengasse.\n\nAs we see included in the diagram at right is an earlier marriage of Hannah Mayer, daughter of Nathan, to Henry FitzRoy, a member of the family of the Dukes of Grafton, descendants of Barbara Villars, one of the mistresses of King Charles II of England. Their descendants are untitled.\n\nOf larger significance is Alfred, the second son of Lionel, because Alfred, who never married, had an illegitimate daughter, Almina, who married the 5th Earl of Carnarvon. With a marriage settlement of the staggering sum of £500,000, the Earl was the very man who financed the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamon. After his death, Almina continued to supervise the dig, until the Egyptian government took over.\n\nOf particular interest in the main genealogy is Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild (1868-1937). At seven years old, Walter was already interested in zoology and professed an ambition to create a zoological museum. Pushed into the family business from 1889 to 1908, and in Parliament from 1899 to 1910, Walter was finally freed to devote all his attention to natural history and collecting. From 1892 he had already opened his house in Tring Park as a museum.\n\nIn a delightful stunt, to demonstrate that zebras could be tamed like horses, Walter drove a carriage with a team of four zebras to Buckingham Palace. On his death in 1937, the Tring house was willed to the British Museum and its subsidiary, the Natural History Museum. Some of his collection, however, had been sold in 1932 to the American Museum of Natural History to pay off a blackmailing former mistress.\n\nWalter never married and did have at least one illegitimate child. The title passed to his nephew, Victor. Despite retreating from business and politics, Walter nevertheless remained involved with Zionism. Thus, an extraordinary footnote to this life is that the original Balfour Declaration, that the British Government would favor a \"national home for the Jewish people\" in Palestine, was a personal letter written by Arthur Balfour, British Foreign Secretary, to no less than Walter Rothschild, simply mailed to his London residence, in Piccadilly.\n\nAmerican Families in Business and Politics The Du PontsThe AstorsThe VanderbiltsThe Johnsons The RockefellersThe Roosevelts & DelanosThe Hearsts The KennediesThe HiltonsThe FordsThe Bushes\n\nThe Rothschilds have not, so far, been a conspicuously American family; and none of the members of the American families at left have been particularly well known as bankers or financiers. However, apart from the political families -- the Roosevelts, Kennedies, and Bushes -- they all are, like the Rothschilds, associated with business and capitalism. On the other hand, if the Rothschilds made most of their fortune financing governments, perhaps they were not such capitalists, in the proper sense, after all. But they cannot escape the characterization when they were both Jews and moneylenders. Marxists would not let them get away with it. So the association is appropriate.\n\nPhilosophy of Religion, Judaism\n\nGeorge IDarmstadt\n\n1567-1597 Louis V1597-1626 George II1626-1661 Louis VI1661-1678 Louis VII1678 Ernest Louis1678-1739 Louis VIII1739-1768 Louis IX1768-1790 Louis X,\n\nI as Grand Duke1790-1806 Grand Duke,\n\n1806-1830 Louis II1830-1848 Louis III1848-1877 Louis IV1877-1892 Ernest Louis1892-1918\n\nd. 1937\n\nThe Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt was made a Grand Duke by Napoleon in 1806, and this survived until the end of the German Empire in 1918.\n\nOf great interest are the marriages made by Hesse-Darmstadt in its final years. The Royal Houses of Britain and Spain, as well as the House of Russia, if all the children of Nicholas II had not been murdered in 1918, are all now descendants of the Grand Duke Louis II. The name that soon may be attached to the British Royal Family began with a morganatic marriage of Alexander of Hesse. Thus, his wife, Julia Theresa, was not considered worthy of the lineage of Hesse, but a special title was created for her and her children: Battenberg.\n\nAs Queen Victoria's daughter Alice married the Grand Duke Louis IV, one of the Battenberg sons, Louis Alexander, married their daughter, Victoria, while another Battenberg son, Henry Maurice, married Queen Victoria's youngest daughter, Beatrice. Victoria, daughter of Beatrice, married the King of Spain. One of Alice's other daughters, Alexandra, fatefully married Nicholas II of Russia. Alexandra, Nicholas, and all their children, of course were horribly murdered by the Bolsheviks, and their bodies largely destroyed -- now recovered and reburied in St. Petersburg. Alexandra was not popular in Russia, in great measure because of her strange and distraught behavior, which the public at the time did not know was because of the haemophilia of her son, the Tsarevich. Queen Victoria's daughters Alice and Beatrice were both carriers of the trait, which apparently originated with her. Nowhere did the disease have such drastic and tragic consequences as in Alexandra's family. Meanwhile, another Battenberg son, Alexander, was for a time the ruler of Bulgaria.\n\nOn the map, we see the lands of Hesse. However, the extent of Oberhessen apparently combines the possessions of both Hesse-Cassel and Hesse-Darmstadt. Hesse-Homburg is not even shown. The Rhein-Hessen lands were added to Darmstadt at the Congress of Vienna. Note that Mainz was originally an independent Electoral Archbishopric, all of which were abolished at Vienna.\n\nSouth of Darmstadt, in the Odenwald mountains, stands Castle Frankenstein. Yes, Frankenstein. Small and partially reconstructed, this castle looms large just for its name. Mary Shelley got the name \"Frankenstein\" from someplace, and there is little doubt that it was from here. She certainly traveled nearby, on the way to the Swiss retreat with Lord Bryon and others, where she wrote the novel Frankenstein [1818] during \"the year without summer\" in 1816. However, we have no evidence that she visited Castle Frankenstein or even heard about it.\n\nThis is disappointing, since part of the lore of the castle is the residence of an alchemist, Johann Conrad Dippel (1673-1734), who is said to have experimented with dead bodies. This could be direct inspiraton for Shelley's story. However, it is now hard to tell what stories about Dippel antedate Frankenstein and those that have actually been subsequently inspired by it. Generating extra fame for a local tourist attraction is something commonly heard of; and while Castle Frankenstein seems to generate modest levels of interest, there is a successful restaurant on site, and special events during the year, as at Halloween, draw respectable crowds.\n\nAnd there are actual Frankensteins around. In 2008, the President of the California Medical Association was Dr. Richard S. Frankenstein, a pulmonologist. Dr. Frankenstein was also Chief Medical Officer of the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, 2016-2017, which happens to be where I was born in 1949. I'm sure many people believe that the California Medical Association should have made Dr. Frankenstein the permanent President of the organization. How could they pass up the chance?\n\nPrince Louis Alexander of Battenberg went on to a distinguished career in the Royal Navy. He was First Sea Lord when World War I began. During the War, he changed the family name to a more Anglicized \"Mountbatten,\" but still had to resign his position because of his (birth) nationality. Nevertheless, Prince Louis's son went on to his own distinguished career in British service, ultimately as Lord Louis, Earl Mountbatten of Burma. Lord Mountbatten's sister Alice married Prince Andrew of Greece, and their son, Philip, ended up marrying the future Queen Elizabeth. Renouncing his claims to the Greek succession, Philip took the name of his mother's family, Mountbatten, which now passes to the heirs to the British Thone, Prince Charles and his son Prince William. Prince Charles is thus descended from Queen Victoria through both his mother and his father, as well as being descended from Louis II of Hesse in two ways. He regarded Lord Mountbatten, his great uncle, as his \"honorary grandfather.\"\n\nStem Duchies Index\n\nGerman Confederation Index\n\nFrancia Index\n\nDukes & Electors of Saxony Otto I the Illustrious880-912 Duke of\n\nThuringia, 909 Henry I the Fowler912-936 King,\n\n918-936 Otto I the Great936-961/66 King,\n\n936-973;\n\nEmperor,\n\n962-973 Hermann Billung961/66-973 Bernard I973-1011 Bernard II1011-1059 Ordulf1059-1072 Magnus1072-1106 Lothar of Supplinburg,\n\nII of Germany1106-1137 Emperor,\n\n1125-1137 Henry II (IV) Welf,\n\nthe Proud,\n\nX of Bavaria1137-1138 Albert I the Bear\n\nAscanian1138-1142 Brandenburg,\n\n1134-1170 Henry III (V) Welf,\n\nthe Lion1142-1180,\n\nd.1195 Bernard III Ascanian1180-1212 Albert II1212-1261 division between\n\nSaxe-Lauenburg\n\n& Saxe-Wittenberg Albert III of\n\nSaxe-Wittenberg1261-1298 Rudolf I1298-1356 Rudolf IIElector,\n\n1356-1370 Wenceslas1370-1388 Rudolf III1388-1419 Albert IV1419-1422\n\nThe Saxons were the last German tribe to be conquered by the Franks and Christianized. It took Charlemagne from 782 to 804 to do this, and it sounds like very hard fighting. As a Duchy, Saxony was one of the more powerful and coveted ones. Its earliest Dukes soon seized the Throne of Germany. Otto the Great then defeated the Magyars (955), invaded Italy (961), and began the line of German Emperors (962).\n\nA final showdown over the Germany monarchy, which ended up as a Götterdämmerung in which the Monarchy itself foundered, was between the Hohenstaufen and the Welf Dukes of Saxony. The Welf heirs, although apparently the losers, deprived of Saxony (1138, 1180) and Bavaria (1180), were then compensated with Saxon lands, the Duchy of Brunswick, which grew into the Kingdom of Hanover.\n\nIn 1261 there is a division between Albert III of Saxe-Wittenberg and his brother John I of Saxe-Lauenburg. Albert's grandson Rudolf II became Elector of Saxony through the Golden Bull of Emperor Charles IV in 1356. The Lauenburg line lasted many years, until 1689, as seen below. But when the male line of Wittenburg failed in 1422, the title of Elector of Saxony passed to the Margraves of Meißen, so that later what became \"Saxony\" was actually east and south of the original Stem Duchy. That came to be called \"Upper Saxony,\" while the lands around the Lower Elbe were \"Lower Saxony.\" Much of the original western part of Saxony, however, became \"Westphalia,\" so that even \"Lower Saxony\" is somewhat to the east of the original Duchy.\n\nThe daughters of Julius Francis, the last Askanian Duke of Saxony, made important marriages. Sibylle married the Gian Gastone, the Medici Grand Duke of Tuscany. Unfortunately, they had no children and were the end of the Medici line. Anna Marie married the great general of the War of the Spanish Succession, Louis William of Baden. Their sons were themselves the last of their line (of Baden-Baden), but they had a sister, Auguste, who married Louis, the Duke of Orléans. All subsequent members of the House of Orléans, including King Louis Philippe of France, indeed all members of the surviving French House of Bourbon, were her descendants.\n\nThe genealogy here is now from the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, Volume I, Part I, Deutsche Kaiser-, Königs-, Herzogs- und Grafenhäuser I [Andreas Thiele, Third Edition, R.

From the informal and temporary division of a domain between brothers and then cousins, often undone, as in Bavaria, we progress to formal and permanent divisions, sometimes never undone, as in Saxony. There could be as many Dukes of Saxony as heirs, but there could only be one Elector of Saxony. Thus, the first division of Saxony is between the Electorate and the Duchy. The table at left gives line of the Electors and then Kings of Saxony. The following tables give the genealogy for the Electors and Kings and then, with two tables, for the Duchies.\n\nJohn George I1611-1656 John George II1656-1680 John George III1680-1691 Commanded the Saxon Corps, Center of Christian Relief Army at Siege of Vienna, 1683 John George IV1691-1694 Frederick\n\nAugustus I,\n\nthe StrongElector,\n\n1694-1733 King of Poland,\n\n1697-1706,\n\n1709-1733 Frederick\n\nAugustus IIElector,\n\n1733-1763 King of Poland,\n\n1733-1763 Frederick\n\nAugustus I,\n\n(III) the JustElector,\n\n1763-1806 King,\n\n1806-1827 Grand Duke\n\nof Warsaw,\n\n1807-1815 Anthony\n\nClement1827-1836 MaximillianDuke,\n\n1830-1838 Frederick\n\nAugustus II1836-1854 John1854-1873 German Empire, 1871 Albert1873-1902 George1902-1904 Frederick\n\nAugustus III1904-1918,\n\nd. 1932\n\nFor many years Electoral Saxony appeared in no way inferior in power to its neighbor Brandenburg. The Electors Frederick Augustus I and Frederick Augustus II were even elected Kings of Poland. Not until Frederick II of Prussia did it start to become clear that Saxony would not be the predominant power of the region. An attempt was made to remedy this through alliance with France during the Napoleonic Era, but all this ended up earning Saxony was a significant loss of territory, to Prussia of course, at the Congress of Vienna. Saxony was reduced to parity with Württemberg as one the smallest of the five Kingdoms of Germany. As such, it was never again a major player in German politics.\n\nThe capital of the Electorate and Kingdom of Saxony was Dresden, a beautiful city that later became one of the symbols of the horrors of World War II, when the Allies firebombed it on February 13, 1945. This killed perhaps 135,000 people and all but destroyed the city. A witness was Allied prisoner-of-war and future novelist Kurt Vonnegut, whose Slaughterhouse-Five (1969) recounts his experience (in a science fiction context).\n\nThe genealogical tables began with Brian Tompsett's Royal and Noble genealogy. This left many gaps, which I had trouble finding convenient sources to remedy. After some frustrating and fruitless library work, Christopher Haußmann of Munich came to the rescue. Besides having put together some information himself, he could refer me to two German websites: Dresden used to give the Electors and Kings of Saxony, while Thüringen used to cover all the Dukes. These pages are not necessarily in the most convenient form, they are in German, and I am not now able to find their historical sections; but most of the gaps and problems left by Tompsett were resolved by them.\n\nI have now obtained the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, Volume I, Part I, Deutsche Kaiser-, Königs-, Herzogs- und Grafenhäuser I [Andreas Thiele, Third Edition, R.

Fischer Verlag, 1997], which exhaustively covers all this genealogy, and I will be checking and supplementing the information from these other sources as time allows.\n\nThe table covers all the Wettin Electors and Kings of Saxony. The Electorate first passes down the senior \"Ernestine\" line. When the Emperor Charles V defeated the Elector John Frederick and the Protestant League of Schmalkalden at Mühlberg in 1547, he transferred the Electorate to Maurice of the \"Albertine\" line, where it remained, leading to the Kingdom of Saxony. The Ernestine line then produces all the Dukes of Saxony, shown below.\n\nThe claim of William the Brave to Luxemburg derived from his wife, Anna of Hapsburg, who was a granddaughter of the Emperor Sigismund of Luxemburg. The generally recognized heiress of Luxemburg, however, was Elizabeth of Görlitz, Sigismund's niece; and William doesn't seem to have made much headway with his claim, especially when Anna died in 1462.\n\nThe elections of Frederick Augustus I and II as Kings of Poland did not add measurably to the power of Saxony, since Poland itself was becoming all but ungovernable and would only even exist for 30 more years after them. The episodes may have damaged Saxony in the long run, by drawing the Electors away from domestic improvements.\n\nThe Kingdom of Saxony, created by Napoleon, never had much of a chance, apart from French help, to contend against the other German powers. Prussia greatly reduced Saxon territory at the Congress of Vienna.\n\nNapoleon also made Augustus III, now the First of Saxony, not just King of Saxony, but Grand Duke of Warsaw, in Napoleon's attempt to revive the Polish State. This didn't do the Poles any good, and it did not help makes friends for Saxony among the Allies of 1815. This was the last time that Saxony had anything to do with Poland.\n\nThe line of Kings of Saxony continued until 1918, when all the German rulers abdicated. The last King, Frederick Augustus III, although reduced to a private citizen, did nevertheless represent the Senior Line of the House of Saxony. This would count for something in some circles.\n\nAs happens with deposed royality and nobility, the meaningless succession as Head of House ends up disputed. We see that sort of thing with the Bonapartes. With Saxony, the problem would be lack of heirs. Both Maria Emanuel and Albert would have no legitimate children. So Maria Emanuel, as Head of House, designated his nephew Alexander, the son of his sister, Anna. This was allowed by most, since Saxony did not strictly follow the Salic Law. However, Maria Emanuel's cousins, descended from his aunt, Margareta Karola, who are now Princes of Hohenzollern, claimed priority. This is already the senior line of the Princes of Hohenzollern, so you might think that, when it comes of meaningless titles, they would have enough already. But Saxony was, after all, a Kingdom, so perhaps that is too good to pass up. It is hard to imagine that there would be a court that might wish to sort this out.\n\nSaxe-Weimar was the principal Duchy of Saxony. In 1815 it was styled a \"Grand Duchy.\" (I was not clear when this happened but now have been referred to a (now dead) website that gives the date.) The celebrated Grand Duke Charles Augustus (Karl August) was the friend of Goethe and the protector of Jakob Fries. When Prussia demanded that Fries be prohibited from teaching philosophy, the Duke found him something else to do at Jena, teach physics. Charles Augustus was also the first German prince to grant a constitution. This doesn't sound very exciting now, but it was radical stuff in post-Napoleonic Germany.\n\nThere were many regencies in the indicated reigns. Some Dukes didn't even come of age before a premature death. The web source for the Duchies lists reigns minus the regencies. I have largely disregarded the regencies, which would add greatly to the clutter of the diagrams, and have added the regency periods to the reigns proper of the Dukes. One regency is shown, that of the celebrated mother, Anna Amalia, of Charles Augustus.\n\nIn 1815 the Kingdom of Saxony existed alongside the Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar(-Eisenach) and the Duchies of Saxe-Gotha(-Altenburg), Saxe-Meiningen (also seen spelled \"Meinungen\"), Saxe-Hildburghausen, and Saxe-Coburg(-Saalfeld). These \"Saxon Duchies\" were the territorially most complicated part of Germany in that era, as can be seen in the maps of the German Confederation. The beginning of each division can be seen in the genealogical tables above and below.\n\nIn 1826 a some significant rearrangement occurred: Duke of Ernest I of Saxe-Coburg took over Saxe-Gotha, of which his wife, Louise, was heiress. This created the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, from which Ernest's son Albert married Queen Victoria of England. Albert's elder brother, Ernest II, succeeded to the Duchy; but when Ernest died in 1893, the Duchy was passed to Albert and Victoria's son Alfred, and when he died in 1900, to their grandson Charles Edward. Charles was still Duke in 1918 when all the old feudal thrones were abolished. Although Albert and King Edward VII of England are usually said to be of the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, the whole family of the House of Saxony, of course, was actually that of the Wettins. Although the name \"Windsor\" was adopted for the British Royal Family in World War I, Queen Elizabeth II is still really a Wettin, descended from Duke and Elector Frederick I of Saxony.\n\nWith the consolidation of Saxe-Gotha and Saxe-Coburg in 1826, some other changes look place. Saxe-Altenburg was detached from Saxe-Gotha and given to the Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen, who then passed his original domain to Saxe-Meiningen. The consolidation of those two Duchies creates something remarkable -- a continuous piece of land. The German website doesn't seem to list Hildburghausen with Saxe-Meiningen after 1866, so I wonder if Prussia took it -- or if the duality was just overlooked. All these cities, by the way, can be seen on a modern map of Germany, in the State of Thuringia, lately part of unhappy East Germany.\n\nThe many families of the Saxon Kingdom and Duchies ended up providing a resource of noble personages for the rest of Europe. Besides a husband for Queen Victoria, Saxe-Coburg alone also provided spouses for many others, especially when Victoria's many children are counted, and Kings for Belgium, Portugal, and Bulgaria. Victoria's own mother, where her previously non-English name derived, was a sister of Duke Ernest I, as can be seen above.\n\nStem Duchies Index\n\nGerman Confederation Index\n\nFrancia Index\n\nHouse of Welf-Brunswick-Lüneburg\n\nDukes of Brunswick, Electors & Kings of Hanover\n\nThe story of the House of Brunswick begins much earlier, back in the young days of the Carolingian Empire. The House of Welf contributed some Carolingian wives and then, as the Empire began to split up, came into possession of the Kingdom of Burgundy. This led to marriages to German royal houses, and then to Burgundy itself passing to the German Emperors. Meanwhile, a collateral line of German Welfs grew into powerful nobility. Although the male line ended, a scion of Este who married the Welf heiress fathered what was nevertheless considered a continuation of the Welf house, the \"Younger Welfs.\" These figured in contention for the Imperial Throne with their own cousins, the Hohenstaufen Dukes of Swabia.\n\nThe conflict of the Welfs with the Waiblingen, the Hohenstaufen (or Staufer), was reflected in Italy, where the terms Guelf and Ghibelline were identified with, respectively, the Papal and the Imperial parties. These were alliances of convenience, of course, and the Welf Emperor, Otto IV, was not necessarily more pro-Papal than any other German Emperor. But in Germany, the Welf cause, although weakening the state, was not fated for much success. The defeat of Henry the Lion by Frederick I (when Bavaria was conferred upon the Wittelsbachs, who retained it thereafter) and then of Otto IV by Philip of Swabia and the supporters of his nephew, Frederick II, doomed further Welf prospects. As Emperor, however, Frederick endowed Otto IV's nephew, Otto the Child, with part of the original Duchy of Saxony. This was now a Duchy associated with the cities of Brunswick (Braunschweig), and Lüneburg. In it the Welf house would survive, though increasingly identified in name and ambition with its new home. An entire website about the Welfs, continuing down to the present, exists in Germany.\n\nDukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg,\n\nElectors & Kings of Hanover Ernest the ConfessorDuke of Brunswick-\n\nLüneburg, 1520-1546 Francis Otto1546-1559William the Pious1559-1592 Ernest II1592-\n\n1611Christian1611-\n\n1633Augustus the Elder1633-\n\n1636FrederickDuke of\n\nBrunswick-\n\nCelle,\n\n1636-\n\n1648 George Odysseus1636-1641 Ernest AugustusDuke of\n\nBrunswick-\n\nLüneburg,\n\n1679-\n\n1698;\n\nDuke of\n\nHanover,\n\n1680-\n\n1698Christian Louis1641-\n\n1655John\n\nFrederick1665-\n\n1679George WilliamDuke of\n\nBrunswick-\n\nCelle,\n\n1665-\n\n1705 Elector of\n\nHanover,\n\n1692-\n\n1698\n\nGeorge I1698-1727 King of\n\nEngland,\n\n1714-1727 George II1727-1760 King of\n\nEngland,\n\n1727-1760 George III1760-1806 King of\n\nEngland,\n\n1760-1820 King of\n\nHanover,\n\n1814-1820 George IV1820-1830 King of\n\nEngland,\n\n1820-1830 William (IV)1830-1837 King of\n\nEngland,\n\n1830-1837 Ernest\n\nAugustus1837-1851 George V1851-1866\n\nd.1878 Hanover annexed\n\nby Prussia, 1866\n\nThe Duchy of Brunswick (Braunschweig in German) was a part of the old Duchy of Saxony (in now what is called \"Lower\" Saxony, as opposed to the \"Upper Saxony\" of the Electorate and Kingdom of Saxony and the Saxon Duchies of Thuringia), named after the city of Braunschweig. Like all mediaeval German states, all the sons of the family shared and shared alike in the common inheritance of the family, and so were all equally Dukes of Brunswick. If collateral lines of descent died out (i.e. had no male heirs, as the Salic Law was observed in Germany), the unity of the realm could be restored. If not, then not.\n\nIn time, as attempts were made to institute primogeniture, smaller principalities or duchies (secundogenitures) might be created for younger sons and cousins. The main line of Brunswick was associated with the capital of Lüneburg, while subsidiary domains were created for younger sons, especially in Dannenberg, Wolfenbüttel, Hannover, and Celle. My information on the details of this is spotty. The only domain that eventually became permanently separated from the larger was the Duchy of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. In time, that became simply the Duchy of Brunswick, as the larger Duchy, in turn, acquired a new name. That began with the creation of a Principality of Hannover -- usually written Hanover in English -- in 1638. When all but one of the sons of William the Pious (or the Younger) died without male issue, and all of the sons of George Odysseus followed suit, Ernest Augustus reassembled most of the Duchy and then elevated Hanover to Duchy status. When his brother George William, who was rulling Brunswick-Celle and whose daughter Ernest Augustus had married, died in 1705, the whole Duchy was reassembled, except for Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. The larger Duchy, however, now began to be called Hanover, especially when Ernest Augustus was made an Elector of the Holy Roman Empire in 1692, as \"Elector of Hanover.\" The marriage of Ernest Augustus to a granddaughter of James I of England then gave his son George a claim to the Throne of England and Scotland, realized with the \"Hanoveran Succession\" in 1714.\n\nThe line of the Welfs, defeated in Germany, thus many years later came to the powerful Throne of Great Britain and Ireland. The British Parliament was always suspicious of the German interests of the Hanoveran Kings, but Hanover naturally found itself in anti-French alliances just like Britain. After the paroxysm of the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars, when Hanover was usually under French occupation, the Electorate emerged as one of the Kingdoms of Confederation Germany.\n\nA fateful parting of the ways came in 1837, when Queen Victoria came to the Throne in Britain. The Salic Law prohibited female succession, and Hanover passed to her uncle, Ernest Augustus. In 1866, his son, George V, picked the wrong side in the war between Prussia and Austria. The Prussians occupied Hanover and deposed George, who was thrown upon the hospitality of his English cousin.\n\nThat is not quite the end of the story, however. In 1884 the line of the Dukes of Brunswick, of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel that is, came to an end. The son of George V, Ernest Augustus, was the heir. He could have assumed the rule of Brunswick, such as it was under the German Empire, if he had acknowledged the loss of Hanover proper by his family. He refused, and the Ducal Throne remained vacant. As it happened, however, his son, yet another Ernest Augustus, ended up marrying a daughter, Victoria Louise, of Wilhelm II, in 1913. They were endowed with the Duchy. Such enjoyment as they may have derived from this was short-lived, since they were deposed, with all German royalty and ruling nobility, in 1918.\n\nTheir grandson, yet even another Ernest Augustus, emerged on the radar screen of popular celebrity in 1999 by marrying Princess Caroline of Monaco. Their daughter, Alexandra, however, would not be the heiress of Hanover (apart from the Salic Law), since the now obligatory next Ernest Augustus had already been produced by a previous marriage.\n\nThe genealogical table below was originally almost entirely based on Brian Tompsett's Royal and Noble genealogy. This left the exact mechanism of the subdivisions obscure. Some of that could be clarified, a little, with Bruce R. http://my.raex.com/~obsidian/regindex.html's Regnal Chronologies. The Dukes of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel are given separately. Now, however, I have been able to make some additions and corrections here using the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, Volume I, Part I, Deutsche Kaiser-, Königs-, Herzogs- und Grafenhäuser I [Andreas Thiele, Third Edition, R. G. Fischer Verlag, 1997].\n\nDukes of Brunswick,\n\nBrunswick-Wolfenbüttel Augustus\n\nthe Younger1635-1666 Rudolf Augustus1666-1704 Anthony Ulrich1704-1714 Augustus William1714-1731 Louis Rodolph1731-1735 Ferdinand Albert1735 Charles I1735-1780 Charles II1780-1806 Ferdinand William1806-1815 Charles III\n\nFrederick1815-1830\n\nd.1873 William Maximilian1830-1884 interregnum, 1884-1913 Ernest Augustus1913-1918\n\nd.1953\n\nThe most striking thing about the genealogy of the Dukes of Brunswick here are the marriages of the daughters of Louis Rodolph, Prince of Blackenbourg. One daughter married a Romanov and was the mother of a Tsar, albeit an ephemeral one; but then another married the Emperor Charles VI and become the fateful mother of Maria Theresa, who for forty years was herself the House of Hapsburg.\n\nStem Duchies Index\n\nGerman Confederation Index\n\nFrancia Index\n\nCounts, Dukes, & Grand Dukes of Oldenburg Egilmar ICount,\n\n1091-1108 Egilmar II1108-1142 Christian I the Quarrelsome1143-1167 Maurice/Moritz I1167-1211,\n\nd.1218 Christian II1211-1233 Otto I1232-1252 John I (IX)1243-1270 Christian III1270-1285 John II (X)1272-1316 Christian IV1302-1322 John III (XI)1302-1342(?)

Later one of his grandsons is made the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp.\n\nWhen the main lineage of Oldenburg itself died out in 1667, it fell to the Danish House. One of the line of Holstein-Gottorp married a daughter of Peter the Great of Russia. Another, his first cousin, had Oldenburg settled upon him. One of his brothers became King of Sweden. Another had a son to whom Oldenburg passed in 1823. Subsequent Grand Dukes were all his descendants. Some of this genealogy can be examined below.\n\nThe original table here was based on Brian Tompsett's Royal and Noble genealogy and Bruce R. Gordon's Regnal Chronologies. This is now modified and expanded on the basis of the Geschichte des Landes Oldenburg, by Albrecht Eckhardt and Heinrich Schmidt [Heinz Holzberg Verlag, Oldenburg, 1987]. Some slight inconsistencies in dating (and the numbering of the Johns) have been rather arbitrarily resolved. Some obscurities remain.\n\nStem Duchies Index\n\nGerman Confederation Index\n\nFrancia Index\n\nDukes & Margraves\n\nof Thuringia Thakulfc.849-874 Radulf874-880 Poppo880-892 Konrad892-906 Burchard II of Wettin907-909 to the Duke of Saxony, 909 Dukes of Thuringia Ekkehard1000-1002 Wilhelm II of Weimar1002-1003 Landgraves of Thuringia Louis I the Bearded,\n\nthe SalianCount,\n\n1031-1056 Wilhelm IV of WeimarDuke,\n\n1046-1062 Louis II the JumperCount,\n\n1056-1123 Otto of WeimarDuke,\n\n1062-1067 Louis IIILandgrave,\n\n1123-1140 Louis IV the Iron1140-1172 Louis V the Mild1172-1190 Herman I1190-1216 Louis VI the Pious1216-1227 Herman II1227-1241 Henry Raspe1241-1247 Rival Emperor,\n\n1246-1247 to March of Meißen\n\nThe Thuringians were one of the original tribes of Germany, conquered by the Franks in 531.

Eventually the Saxon Emperors tried to revive a separate Thuringian Duchy. For some reason this was a fitful business and a regular line did not become established. By 1067, there are no further Dukes. Soon the line of Louis the Bearded took over as Landgraves (1130). Louis' origin is variously given as Carolingian, Welf, or Salian. After a bit more than a century, Thuringia then passed to the vigorous March of Meißen.\n\nLists and treatments of the Thuringian Dukes seem to be curiously hard to come by, and I have relied on a single historical website. The genealogy of the Landgraves, which I have not yet reproduced here, can be found in the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, Volume I, Part 1, Deutsche Kaiser-, Königs-, Herzogs- und Grafenhäuser I [Andreas Thiele, Third Edition, R. G. Fischer Verlag, 1997, pp.233-234].\n\nOne reason for the withering of Thuringia may have been the vigorous Marches that grew on the eastern border. These soon overshadowed what should have been the parent Duchy. In 1247, the Margrave of Meißen, Henry the Illustrious of Wettin, acquired the Landgravate of Thuringia, which then lost its separate and original identity. The Landgrave Henry Raspe had forfeited his domain with rebellion against the Emperor Frederick II (away in Sicily) and his son King Conrad IV (in Germany).\n\nMeißen had been going since 928. A number of families contended for the Margavate. Except for Rikdag, they are not given here, but genealogies for five are shown by Andreas Thiele in the cited Stammtafeln [pp.235-236]. The Wettins were the sixth family, actually descended from the last of the original Dukes of Thuringia, Burchard; and under Conrad the Great they secured exclusive possession. In 1423, the Wettins became the Dukes of Saxony -- the opposite of the dynamic in 909. Because of this, the whole area of Meißen, Thuringia, Lusatia, and Brandenburg began to acquire the identity that it mostly still has, as \"Upper Saxony.\"\n\nThe early marriages of Meißen are of great interest. We have a connection to the Angeli, the Babenbergs of Austria, the Hohenstaufen, and even the Plantagenets.\n\nThe whole later complex of the Saxon Duchies was ruled by the large numbers of the House of Wettin. Since one of these, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, later married Queen Victoria of England, the subsequent British Royal Family, down to Queen Elizabeth, have been Wettins, direct patrilineal descendants of the Duke Burchard of Thuringia and the Margrave Conrad the Great of Meißen.\n\nThe lineage of the Wettins down to Frederick the Warlike, the first Duke of Saxony, is entirely from the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, Volume I, Parts 1, Deutsche Kaiser-, Königs-, Herzogs- und Grafenhäuser I [Andreas Thiele, Third Edition, R. G. Fischer Verlag, 1997, pp.237-245]. The website cited for the Dukes of Thuringia above gives a somewhat different list for the Wettin Margraves of Meißen. Here I have followed Thiele and the Regentenlisten und Stammtafeln zur Geschischte Europas, by Michael F. Feldkamp [Philipp Reclam, Stuttgart, 2002, pp.316-317].\n\nStem Duchies Index\n\nFrancia Index\n\nDukes of Swabia Erchanger915-917 Burkhard I917-926 Herman I926-949 Ludolph950-954, d.957 Burkhard II954-973 Otto I973-982 Conrad I983-997 Herman II997-1003 Herman III1003-1012 Ernest I\n\nof Babenberg1012-1015 Ernest II1015-1030 Herman IV1030-1038 Henry I,\n\nIII of Germany1038-1045, d.1056 Franconia, 1039-1056 Carinthia, 1039-1047 Bavaria, 1042-1047 Emperor,\n\n1039-1056 Otto II of Ezzo1045-1047 Otto III of Schweinfurt1048-1057 Rudolph of Rheinfelden1057-1077, d.1080 Frederick I Hohenstaufen1079-1105 Frederick II1105-1147 Frederick III, Barbarossa,\n\nII of Germany1147-1152 Emperor,\n\n1152-1190 Frederick IV of Rothenburg1152-1167 Frederick (V)1167-1170 Frederick V Conrad1170-1191 Conrad II1191-1196 Philip of Swabia1196-1208 Rival Emperor,\n\n1198-1208 Otto IV Welf of Brunswick1208-1212 Emperor,\n\n1198-1212,\n\nd.1218 Frederick VI, II of Germany1212-1216 Emperor,\n\n1212-1250 Henry II1216-1235,\n\n1242 Conrad III, IV of Germany1235-1254 Emperor, 1250-1254 Conrad IV (Conradin)1254-1268 Rudolf of Hapsburg1289-1290 Emperor, 1273-1291 John Parricide1290-1313\n\nSwabia takes its name from the tribe of the Suevi -- or Suebi, Sueben, or Schwaben. The Suevi had been involved with the confederation of the Alemanni (or \"Alamanni\"), whose name obscured them in Germany until the Franks absorbed the Alemanni in 806. Meanwhile, however, most of the Suevi had crossed the Rhine (407), romped across Gaul and Spain, and ended up founding an enduring Kingdom in Galicia (409-585). As the name of the Alemanni curiously becomes that for all of Germany in several Romance languages, the name of the Suevi reemerges in the Stem Duchy of Swabia. There is little sense, however, of the suvival of anything in the way of Suevic tribal consciousness.\n\nThe Dukes of Swabia went on to become the last great house of German Emperors, the Hohenstaufen, before the possibility of a strong, united German state disappeared. The contest between the Hohenstaufen and the Welfs even briefly raged over Swabia itself. Then, with victory, the Emperor Frederick II relocated to his inheritance in Sicily. Germany largely disintegrated, including Swabia. Württemberg and Baden became the major successor states.\n\nOther small German states derived from Swabia, like Leichtenstein and Hohenzollern. More significantly, Alsace (Alsatia, Elsaß), on the left bank of the Rhine, was part of Swabia. Parts of Alsace went to France at the Peace of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years war in 1648. Louis XIV subsequently began unilaterally annexing more of Alsace. When he took the Imperial City of Straßburg (now Strasbourg in French) in 1681, the consternation of Germany, and even of Europe, was great. Alsace was German, not French, speaking (unlike other territories allowed to France at Westphalia, such as parts of Lorraine) -- indeed, Alsatian constituted a distinct dialect of High German (where we get Strossburi for Strasbourg). And it also included a Jewish community. The Jews had been expelled from France in 1306, but were (until the 20th century) tolerated (with some memorable exceptions) in Germany. As it happened, Louis did not enforce his Revocation of the Edit of Nantes (1685) in Alsace, so the area preserved most of its religious freedom through the rest of the Ancien Régime. The only reason Louis XIV targeted the region was to obtain the Rhine boundary that had belonged to ancient Gaul. The first effort to rescue the city, during the War of the League of Augsburg (1688-1697), failed, and French possession was confirmed in the Treaty of Ryswick (1697). Alsace was not happy under French rule, and German Emperors subsequently always vowed to recover Alsace.\n\nThe French Revolution may have changed that. Alsatians became enthusiastic Revolutionaries -- or so I'm told. The Marseillaise was composed in Strasbourg. Other Alsatians, however, fled the Revolution to Germany, or even to Russia. Then, at long last, Germany recovered Alsace, in 1871, to be incorporated into the new German Empire. Although some Alsatians were glad, most had (reportedly) become French patriots, and substantial numbers, over 100,000, fled to France. Germany made no friends, however, among either French or German speakers, by treating the region like a African colony, ruled directly from Berlin, not like a real part of Germany, with local government. France vowed revenge and, after the incredible carnage of World War I, recovered the region. The names of Alsatian cities, however, despite some spelling differences, still largely betray their German origin. Thus, we have Mulhouse (Mülhausen in German), Altkirch, Ensisheim, Niederbronn, Reichshoffen, Pfaffenhoffen, Hochfelden, Kœnigsbourg (Königsburg), and even Kaysersberg (Kaisersberg). In 1999 the French Institut National de la Statistique et des Études Économiques (INSEE) counted 548,000 adult speakers of Alsatian German in Alsace, or 39% of the adult population -- though only about 25% of children could speak it. Since France has only one official language -- French -- Alsatian German, although officially listed as one of the languages of France, and the second most spoken regional language, is certainly on the decline and under pressure from the educational and political establishment. I am surprised that it survives as much as it does.\n\nMeanwhile, the Parliament of the European Union now meets in Strasbourg. The government of the European Union is a poorly conceived, undemocratic, and oppressive system, but it's nice that Strasbourg now possesses greater European prominence than it may have had since the Oaths of Strasbourg in the 9th century.\n\nThe rest of Swabia would largely be taken up by what would become the Grand Duchy of Baden and the Kingdom of Württemberg.\n\nThe list is based on the Regentenlisten und Stammtafeln zur Geschichte Europas by Michael F. Feldkamp [Philipp Reclam, Stuttgart, 2002, pp.282-284]. The genealogy below is from the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, Volume I, Part 1, Deutsche Kaiser-, Königs-, Herzogs- und Grafenhäuser I [Andreas Thiele, Third Edition, R. G. Fischer Verlag, 1997].\n\nIn the genealogy we see periods where the succession is tending to become hereditary, but then either the male line ends, and the succession jumps to an in-law, or an Emperor, especially Henry III (I of Swabia), grants the Duchy to vassals from outside his family. With the Salians, the Duchy and then the Throne end up in the hands of the Hohenstaufen. The marriages of Gisela (d.1043) not only bring the Kingdom of Burgundy into the Empire, but they lead of into a couple of non-Wettin Margraves of Meißen whose genealogy is not given there. After the Hohenstaufen, the Duchy has effectively broken up into its successor states, and the title, where born, as by Rudolf of Hapsburg, is largely honorary.\n\nStem Duchies Index\n\nFrancia Index\n\nDukes of Bavaria LuitpoldDuke, 889-907 Arnulf the Bad907-937 Eberhard937-938, d.c.966 Berthold938-947 Henry I of Saxony948-955 Henry II the Quarrelsome955-976, 985-995 Otto I of Swabia976-982 Henry III the Younger983-985 Henry IV the Saint,\n\nII of Germany995-1004, 1009-1017 Emperor,\n\n1002-1024 Henry V of Luxemburg1004-1009, 1018-1026 Henry VI of Franconia1027-1042, 1047-1049,\n\nd.1056 Henry VII the Black,\n\nof Luxemburg\n\nIII, Emperor1042-1047 Emperor,\n\n1039-1056 Conrad of Zütphen1049-1053, 1054-1055 Henry VIII1053-1054, 1077-1095,\n\nd.1106 Agnes1055-1061, d.1077 Otto II of Northeim1061-1070, d.1083 Welf I (IV)1070-1077, 1096-1101 Welf II (V)1101-1120 Henry IX (III) the Black1120-1126 Henry X (IV) the Proud1126-1139 Leopold of Babenburg1139-1141 Henry XI Jasomirgott1143-1156, d.1176 Henry XII (V) the Lion1156-1180, d.1195 deposed by Frederick I Barbarossa, 1180\n\nBavaria was the only one of the Stem Duchies from the earliest days of the East Frankish Kingdom to end up preserving both its name and most of its territorial extent right into the 19th century. This was not for want of trying for the opposite, since the domain fragmented considerably; but the extinction of various lines then fortuitously reunited the Duchy. Although no line of German Emperors was ever associated with Bavaria, it was the source of much opposition to the Emperors, especially in the form of the Welf Dukes of the 12th and early 13th centuries.\n\nIn the final showdown of Henry the Lion of Bavaria and Saxony with the Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa, Frederick is triumphant and deprives Henry of his fiefs. Bavaria is passed on to the Wittelsbachs, who hold it henceforth, actually all the way until 1918.\n\nThere seem to be two common systems of numbering for some of the Dukes of Bavaria. The Welf Henry the Lion can be seen given as Henry XII or as Henry V. Since \"XII\" clearly numbers Dukes of Bavaria, and \"V\" is not a number from Saxony (where he was only Henry III), it can only be a number from the House of Welf. My genealogy of Welf, however, must be incomplete, since I only find one other Henry above Henry III.\n\nThe list has been corrected using the Regentenlisten und Stammtafeln zur Geschichte Europas by Michael F.

From then on the Wittelsbachs are one of the more important noble families of Europe. The list is confusing because of the custom of the realm being divided among brothers. While the different lines can be easily distinguished in the genealogical diagrams that follow, it is more difficult to show them intuitively in the tables here. In the main table some parallel entries are used. In the tables immediately below, branch lines are broken off. The first table is that of Henry XIII, brother of Louis II, the Severe, and his descendants.\n\nHenry XIII1253-1290 Louis III1290-1296 Otto III1290-1312 King of Hungary,\n\n1305-1307 Henry XV the\n\nNatterberger1312-1333 Stephen I1290-1309 Otto IV1309-1334 Henry XIV\n\nthe Elder1309-1339 John I\n\nthe Child1339-1340\n\nWilliam VDuke of\n\nZealand\n\n1347-1389 Albert of\n\nHollandCount of\n\nHainault\n\n& Holland\n\n1389-1404 Albert II\n\nthe Younger1387-1397 John III1404-1429 William IV1404-1417 Jacqueline\n\nof Holland1417-1433\n\nd.1436\n\nThis table is the descendants of the Emperor Louis IV and his second wife, Margaret, Countess of Hainaut and Holland. They are part of the history of those countries, which end up in the hands of the Dukes of Burgundy.\n\nThe third table is that of Stephen III, the Magnificent, brother of John II and Frederick,\n\nStephen III\n\nthe Magnificent1375-1413 Louis VII\n\nthe Bearded1413-1443,\n\nd.1447 Louis VIII\n\nthe Younger1443-1445\n\nand his descendants.\n\nIt took a long time for primogeniture to be accepted among these German houses, and meanwhile, domains were divided and subdivided, often permanently. Bavaria, however, was preserved by the circumstance that branch lines died out. Ultimately the main Bavarian line of the Wittelsbachs itself died out, and the succession passed to the Wittelsbach Electors of the Palatinate.\n\nNoteworthy here is the career of the Elector Maximilian II, who achieved fame leading Imperial armies against the Turks in the Balkans. His first wife and son were Heirs to the Throne of Spain. After they both died, Maximilian nevertheless decided to adhere to France in the War of the Spanish Succession. He was perhaps hoping that the French would overthrow the Emperor Leopold, who had been his father-in-law, and that Maximilian himself would be elected Emperor -- as his son would be during the War of the Austrian Succession. This all came to nought on the battlefield of Blenheim in 1704, where the French army was destroyed and Maximilian had to lead a perilous retreat of the remaining French left, harried all the way by Marlborough and Eugène. Maximilian was then a refugee with the French for the rest of the War, after which he was restored to his lands. Meanwhile, the Electress Theresa had been allowed to govern Munich, even as the rest of Wittelsbach lands were occupied by Austria.\n\nThe following table shows the main Bavarian and Dutch lines of the Wittelsbachs. The Palatine line is continued below.\n\nCounts & Prince Electors\n\nof the Palatinate; Wittelsbachs Rudolf II of Bavaria1329-1353 Rupert I1353-1390;\n\nPrince Elector,\n\n1356 Rupert II1390-1398 Rupert III1398-1410 Emperor,\n\n1400-1410 Louis III1410-1436 Louis IV the Gentle1436-1449 Frederick I the Victorious1452-1476 Philip the Upright1476-1508 Louis V the Pacific1508-1544 Frederick II1544-1556 Otto Henry1556-1559 Frederick III1559-1576 Louis VI1576-1583 Frederick IV1583-1610 Frederick V\n\nthe \"Winter King\"1610-1623,\n\nd.1632 King of Bohemia,\n\n1619-1620 Imperial Troops overrun\n\nPalatinate, 1622 Fredrick HenryCount Palatine\n\nd.1629 Peace of Westphalia,\n\nElectorate restored, 1648 Charles I Louis1648-1680 Charles II1680-1685 Philip William1685-1690 John William1690-1716 Charles III Philip1716-1742 Charles IV Theodore1742-1799 Duke of Bavaria,\n\n1777\n\nIn the history of the Palatinate, the most interesting episode may have been the bid of Frederick V for the Kingdom of Bohemia, after the Thirty Year's War began there with a revolt (the \"Defenestration of Prague\") against the Hapsburgs in 1618. Frederick was defeated so quickly that he came to be known as the \"Winter King\" of Bohemia. Imperial troups then descended on the Palatinate and deposed Frederick. The Electorship was passed to his cousins in loyal Bavaria (1623).\n\nAfter all the changing fortunes of the War, however, an Electorship was finally restored to the Palatine at the Peace of Westphalia (1648). But this was not quite the end of the story for Frederick. He had married a daughter, Elizabeth, of King James I of England. One of his daughters, Sophie, married Ernest Augustus, Elector of Hanover. This gave their son, George, a claim to the throne of England. When the British Parliament rejected the surviving Catholic Stuarts, George succeeded to the thrones of England, Scotland, and Ireland (they also said France at the time) as King George I in 1714. This \"Hanoveran Succession\" then provided the ruling House of Britain until Queen Victoria.\n\nThe genealogical tables for all the Wittelsbachs began with Brian Tompsett's Royal and Noble genealogy. This left many gaps, especially in that the descent of the Dukes of Zweibrücken, who succeeded to the Duchy and Electorship of Bavaria in 1799, shortly to become the Kings of Bavaria, was not given. Christopher Haußmann of Munich helped out by informing me that the original Zweibrücken line, missing in Tompsett, led to three Kings and one Queen of Sweden, Charles X, XI, XII and Ulrika. It is after the Swedish Wittelsbachs die out that Christian III becomes the Duke of Zweibrücken. The full genealogy I have found in Die Herzöge in Bayern by Hermann von Witzleben [Prestel-Verlag München, 1976]. A narrative description of the Wittelsbach genealogy can be found here.\n\nThe middle of the diagram below is crowded with the descendants of Wolfgang of Zweibrücken. The seniority of his sons is numbered. To the eldest went Neuburg, to the middle, Zweibrücken, and to the youngest, Birkenfeld. Within Neuburg, we then get the junior line of Sulzbach. With the extinction of the line of Electors from Simmern in 1685, the title passes to Neuburg, and then in 1742 to Sulzbach. Meanwhile, the title of Zweibrücken, which itself had passed to (numbered) junior lines in Landsberg and Kleeburg (Kings of Sweden), had passed to Birkenfeld in 1731. When the Sulzbach line ended in 1799, having inherited Bavaria itself in 1777, it all passed to Birkenfeld-Zweibrücken.\n\nNeedless to say, the family tragedy of dying cousins served to consolidate the Wittelsbach holdings and prevented the kind of fragmentation seen in the Saxon Duchies. The cramped part of this diagram, drawn for a screen 640 pixels wide (the diagram itself is only 613), is unfolded for a screen 1024 pixels wide (the diagram itself is 995) here. The lines of succession are numbered in sequence in that diagram, with cues given for transfers, and some present day descendants of King Ludwig III are shown -- especially noteworthy is the marriage of the Duchess Sophie to Aloys the Heir of Liechtenstein.\n\nDukes, Electors, & Kings of Bavaria; Wittelsbachs Charles Theodore\n\nof the Palatinate1777-1799War of the Bavarian\n\nSuccession, 1778-1779 Maximilian IV/ I Joseph\n\nof Palatinate-ZweibrückenElector, 1799-1805 King, 1805-1825 Ludwig I1825-1848, d.1868 Maximilian II\n\nJoseph1848-1864brother of Otto,\n\nKing of Greece, 1832 Ludwig II\n\nthe Mad1864-1886German Empire, 1871 Otto1886-1913LuitpoldRegent,\n\n1886-1912 Ludwig IIIRegent,\n\n1912-1913 1913-1918, d.1921\n\nBavaria became a Kingdom as an ally of Napoleon, but unlike other such German allies, it gained rather than lost land at the Congress of Vienna. This made it the largest state in Germany after Austria and Prussia.\n\nThe blue and white of Bavaria is now internationally familiar from the crest of BMW (Bavarian Motor Works) automobiles -- popularly known as \"Beamers.\" BMW now also owns the MINI motor company of Britain, maker of the fetching Mini Cooper automobiles.\n\nA fifth cousin of King Maximilian II was the Empress Elizabeth of Austria, popularly known as \"Sisi\" in Vienna, even though she didn't like Vienna and spent little of her later years there. Assassinated by an anarchist, and after her son, the Archduke Rudolf, the Heir of the Hapsburgs, had committed suicide, she is consequently regarded as a tragic and romantic figure. Her apartments in the Hofburg Palace are kept as a museum. Rudolf, however, had a daughter, Elizabeth, who has many, many descendants, as we see in the genealogy. None of these are Wittelsbachs or Hapsburgs, and so they have largely dropped off the radar. But they are out there.\n\nMeanwhile, the last King of Bavaria, Ludwig III, also has many descendants. They are not only the heirs of the Wittelsbachs but also the heirs of the Scottish House of Stuart, and now include the Heirs of the Principality of Liechtenstein. This is not off the radar, especially when anyone is curious about who would be the Stuart Pretender to the Throne of England and Scotland. After so many Wittelsbach lines died out, it is good to see some revival of fertility among the heirs.\n\nThe present Head of the House of Wittelsbach, Franz (b.1933), actually spent time in Nazi concentration camps, including Dachau, after his family was arrested when the Germans occupied Hungary in 1944. The family had been, after all, anti-Nazi. Franz is also the present Heir of Stuart. The Stuart Succession, but not the Wittelsbach, will pass to his niece Sophie, who is married to the Regent of Liechtenstein. The Wittelsbach Succession, following the Salic Law, will pass from Sophie's father, Max, to his cousin Luitpold (b.1961).\n\nThe suicide of the Archduke Rudolf and the apparent depression of the Empress Elizabeth, perhaps not all due to grief and mourning, makes us wonder about the mental health of the later Wittelsbachs. We wonder again at the story of King Ludwig (II) \"the Mad\" of Bavaria, who built fairy-tale castles, like the famous Neuschwanstein (at right), promoted musicians, like Richard Wagner, supposedly had an affair with the sculptress, and future Texan, Elizabet Ney, and killed himself (or was murdered?) after being declared insane and deposed in 1886. A lot of this may also leave us wondering how \"mad\" was he? What all else was going on here?\n\nStem Duchies Index\n\nGerman Confederation Index\n\nFrancia Index\n\nDukes of Carinthia Henry I of Bavaria976-978,\n\n983-989 Otto of Worms978-983,\n\n995-1004 Henry II989-995 Conrad I1004-1011 Adalbert I\n\nof Eppstein1012-1035,\n\nd.1039 Conrad II1036-1039 Henry I the Black,\n\nIII of Germany1039-1047 Swabia,\n\n1038-1045 Franconia,\n\n1039-1056 Bavaria,\n\n1042-1047 Emperor,\n\n1039-1056 Welf (III)1047-1055 Conrad III\n\nof Ezzone1056-1061 Berthold I\n\nof Zähringen1061-1077,\n\nd.1078 Liutold of\n\nEppstein1077-1090 Henry III1090-1122 Henry IV\n\nof Sponheim1122-1123 Engelbert1124-1135,\n\nd.1141 Ulrich I1135-1144 Henry V1144-1161 Hermann1161-1181 Ulrich II1181-1202 Bernhard1202-1269 Ottokar II the GreatKing of\n\nBohemia,\n\n1253-1278 1269-1276 Rudolf of HapsburgEmperor,\n\n1273-1291 1276-1286 Duke of\n\nAustria,\n\n1278-1282 Meinhard\n\nof Görz-Tirol1286-1295 Henry VI1295-1335 to Hapsburgs, 1335\n\nCarinthia (German Kärnten) began as a March dependency of Bavaria, granted by the Dukes of Bavaria. It quickly becomes a pawn in German Imperial politics, often held by close relatives of the Emperors, or the Emperor himself. The possession of Carinthia usually carried with it the Margravate of Verona, the nearby division of Italy constituting the hinterland of Venice, centered on the Roman city of Aquileia.\n\nFrom Imperial politics, we begin to pass into local politics, with rule by the Houses of Eppstein, Sponheim, and Görz-Tirol. Indeed, this approaches the period when Germany begins to fragment beyond hope. But Imperial politics returns to this area. The struggle of Ottokar of Bohemia with Rudolf of Hapsburg, which decided the fate of nearby Austria, would now decide the fate of Carinthia also. After a brief return to local rule, the Duchy becomes permanently attached to Austria, as indeed it still is, even after the passing of the Hapsburgs.\n\nStem Duchies Index\n\nFrancia Index\n\nMargraves & Dukes of Austria Babenbergs Leopold IMargrave,\n\n976-994 Henry I994-1018 Adalbert1018-1055 Ernst1055-1075 Leopold II1075-1096 Leopold III,\n\nthe Pious1096-1136 Leopold IV1136-1141 Henry II1141-1156 Duke,\n\n1156-1177 Leopold V the Virtuous1177-1194 Third Crusade, 1189-1192 Frederick I1194-1198 Leopold VI,\n\nthe Glorious1198-1230 Frederick II,\n\nthe Fighter1230-1246 Herman\n\nof Baden1248-1250 Ottokar II,\n\nof Bohemia1253-1276 King of Bohemia,\n\n1253-1278\n\nAustria is so closely associated with the Hapsburgs that it is a little startling to realize that it didn't begin that way. The original line of Margraves were the Babenbergs. Obtaining Austria for the Hapsburgs turned out to be one of the principal achievements of the first notable member of that house, the Emperor Rudolf I. Dante, who wanted Rudolf in Italy trying to restore the Roman Empire, put him in Hell for such limited goals; but Rudolf himself understood all too well how little power was left in the German Monarchy and how a solid territorial base would be needed if his family, and any future Emperors therefrom, were to have a hope for a predominant status. This was an effective strategy, and Austria itself eventually became an Empire, just not the Roman one (or even the German one).\n\nThe flag of Austria is supposed to have originated on the Third Crusade. At the siege of Acre (whose Classical name, Ptolemais, Πτολεμαΐς, is also sometimes seen) in 1191, the tunic of Duke Leopold V (whose mother was Theodora Comnena) was completely covered with blood, except for a white band where his belt had covered it. Raising his shirt as a standard during the fight, he was offically granted the use of the colors by the Emperor Henry VI. Conducting the siege at Acre was King Richard I of England. Richard insulted Leopold by removing his colors from Acre after its fall. Leopold then kidnapped him on his way home and held him for ransom in Austria. This became a matter for English romance when Richard's delayed return allowed his brother John to exercise enough misrule to provoke the resistance of people like Robin Hood. Unfortunately, when Richard did return, he soon died, and John's misrule soon provoked even the nobility, who at Runnymede forced him to sign the Magna Carta. While holding Richard, Leopold freed hostages that Richard had taken while seizing Cyprus, this included the colorful \"Damsel of Cyprus.\"\n\nPutting together the story of the Hapsburgs (\"Habsburg\" in German, which is becoming more common in English) has been a daunting task. The tables and genealogies here are now increasingly based on the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte, Volume I, Part 1, Deutsche Kaiser-, Königs-, Herzogs- und Grafenhäuser I [Andreas Thiele, Third Edition, R. G. Fischer Verlag, 1997]. Initially I relied on more readily available sources in English. Two books specifically about the Hapsburgs that I had, The House of Habsburg by Adam Wandruszka [Doubleday Anchor, 1965] and The Habsburgs, Embodying Empire by Andrew Wheatcroft [Viking, 1995], were not bad, but incomplete; and the Kingdoms of Europe by Gene Gurney [Crown Publishers, New York, 1982] had full lists of Hapsburgs. Wandruszka had better genealogies (Gurney, none). One problem is sorting out who was ruling what and when, since Austrian possessions where passed out to the many sons of the usually large Hapsburg families. Until 1379 this did not imply any real division of the possessions. Then we have a real division between the sons of Albert II, namely Albert III (the Albertine line) and Leopold III (the Leopoldine line). A further Tyrolean branch of the Leopoldine line began with Frederick IV, son of Leopold, in 1406, as follows.\n\nThe genealogy at right traces back the earliest Hapsburgs. That this goes all the way to Louis the Pious may be a little suspicious, but there may only be one link that is really questionable. Nevertheless, this all passes through very obscure people in a very obscure period. But it is possible. If true, it makes the Hapsburgs cousins of the Free Counts of Burgundy, derived from the great Count Otto William. Habsburg itself was a castle in the Aargau, founded by Count Radbot, a name that curiously never occurs again in the Hapsburg line. Aargau and Thurgau are now both Cantons of Switzerland. The Hapsburgs got tossed out, which is a tribute to the heroism and independent spirit of the Swiss. But it may have also been that the Hapsburgs had bigger fish to fry. The Emperor Maximilian, who recognized Swiss autonomy in 1499, was already juggling Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Burgundy, and Spain, all of which may have seemed worth the sacrifice.\n\nThe numbering of the names cannot be accounted for without listing all the Alberts, Rudolfs, Ottos, Fredericks, and Leopolds, some of whom figure in junior lines or who died young and who cannot be considered to have discharged serious responsibilities of rule (and the numbers all restart from I after the acquisition of Austria). In the table below, these figures are listed with light background and death date only. Even for the important members of the dynasty, however, what and when they ruled was not given by either Wandruszka or Wheatcroft. Gurney's list sometimes raised questions that it does not answer. For instance, Frederick V and his brother Albert VI succeeded to rule at the death of their father, Ernst the Iron Duke, in 1424 (according to Thiele, Gurney, & Wandruszka; Wheatcroft had 1427); but Gurney only lists their rule from 1457, when the death of their young cousin Ladislas ended the Albertine line and reunified the Austrian domain (except for the Tyrol). Frederick had already been crowned Emperor by then -- the only Hapsburg crowned in Rome by the Pope. Things like this get cleared up by Thiele: In 1424 Frederick was only 9 and Albert only 6 years old.
