        "text": "No dice. The princess of Ahlden was never going to be allowed to marry elsewhere (besides to a Welf - and the candidates were either a homosexual lover of a half-brother of the duchesse d'Orléans and \"pig snout\" Georg). What you COULD do, is let her be born male and see where that goes. It frees up George (although I still see him NOT marrying one of Anne Hyde's daughters) but for Mary the dauphin/king of Spain is a far more prestiguous match than some prince of pinchbeck in Germany (no way of being sure in the 166/70s that Hannover's even getting an electorate, lot of water to still run over the dam before that happened in the 1690s).\n\nAs to the elector of Saxony, if Anna Sophie marries in London, all her sisters' marriages probably just move one down.\n\nSo Friederike becomes Electress of Saxony, Vilhelmine becomes duchess of Holstein, Ulrike becomes Electress Palatine and Carl XI is left without a bride (probably still marries one of his mom's nieces).\n\nInteresting, which niece for carl xi is the question aha\n\nFor James duke of York how does Eleanore of neubeirg sound as his second wife?\n\nShe's either too important (if her dad gets the Palatinate or Poland) for a second son or not important enough (if neither happens). Leave her for Leopold says I.\n\nThe Württemberg lady considered for James was Maria Anna Ignatia of Württemberg-Neuenberg. AIUI the girl was living in France at the time of the negotiations for James' second marriage. Then after THAT marriage proposal fell through she was SUPPOSED to marry the duke of Württemberg-Winnental.\n\nI'm backing Maria Anna Ignatia. She's half-Arenberg (so she'll have Habsburg support) and raised between Brussels and Paris (although her dad converted to Catholicism, he later went back to Protestantism and he and his Catholic wife separated). She's currently (in the 1670s) resident in France (so she'll have their support). Basically, with an heir for Charles, and a Habsburg-supported queen (from Denmark, as opposed to Catarina who had French backing), all of the first round picks for Jimmy are not gonna fly (Eleonore's not important enough, Klaudia may be TOO important, and Maria Beatrice ain't budging from her covent cell if there's no chance of her being the matriarch of a Catholic dynasty (when her mother broached the subject of a match with James, Maria apparently didn't even know where England was, and when she heard he was a widower with children, she burst into tears).\n\nShe's either too important (if her dad gets the Palatinate or Poland) for a second son or not important enough (if neither happens). Leave her for Leopold says I.\n\nI'm backing Maria Anna Ignatia.

With her face used for Andromeda, and the duke of Winnental's for Perseus (it caused a scandal because one could plainly see it was the duke). But then he dumped her to marry elsewhere, and so she not only had the painting adjusted so that Perseus no longer had a face (saying she'd add one when she married) but commissioned a second painting from the same artist of Theseus Abandoning Ariadne (her), and guess whose face was used for Thesée's. The duke of Winnental.\n\nSo I'm guessing she would know how to hold a grudge. And I'd like to see what English does with it if one of her kids gets \"Ulrich\" (after her dad) as a name. Händel's middle name was still being spelled Frideric in the next century, so does it become \"Wulfric\"? Or something else entirely?\n\nSo with regards to the younger York sisters (Henrietta, Isabelle, Sophia, & Barbara) do you think they'd be used in the international marriage market similar to their older half-sisters or, due to their lower positions in the line of succession, are they destined to marry Catholic aristocrats (ex: the Duke of Norfolk)?\n\nMaybe marry foreign persons unseemly (read Catholic) for one of Charles' daughters to wed. Or just foreign (German, Dutch, Italian) princes who aren't important enough for a king's daughter.\n\nLouis XIV considered William III so unimportant in rank, he offered Marie Anne de Bourbon (his daughter by La Vallière). So if Bill doesn't get Mary and has a son of a similar age to one of her half-sisters, he might try for a wedding there."
