        "text": "Princess Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria (Maria Anna Christina Victoria; 28 November 1660 - 20 April 1690) was the daughter-in-law of King Louis XIV of France marrying his eldest son and heir Louis, Dauphin of France on 7 March 1680. Known as Marie Anne Victoire in France she was ignored by her husband and the king's court being described as dull and unattractive and died closeted away in her apartments after claiming constant illness which more often than not was dismissed as attention seeking. After her death her body was examined and it was concluded that she was in fact suffering from numerous illnesses and had not been seeking attention. While at court she formed a close bond with her distant cousin Elisabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate who was also German. She was buried within the Royal Basilica of Saint Denis outside Paris. Her widower husband married Mademoiselle de Choin in secret. Her second son the Duke of Anjou founded the Bourbons of Spain who still rule to this day. Her eldest surviving granddaughter Mariana Victoria of Spain ewas named in her honour.\n\nIssue[edit]\n\nLouis of France, Duke of Burgundy, Dauphin of France (16 August 1682 - 18 February 1712) married Marie Adélaïde of Savoy; and had children none of whom survived infancy.\n\nPhilippe of France, Duke of Anjou (King of Spain from 1700) (19 December 1683 - 9 July 1746) later first Bourbon King of Spain, first married Maria Luisa of Savoy and had children; married again Elisabeth Farnese and had children.\n\nCharles of France, Duke of Berry (31 Julie 1686 - 5 May 1714) married Marie Louise Élisabeth d'Orléans and had children though all of whom died in infancy.\n\nTitles[edit]"
