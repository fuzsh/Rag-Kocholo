        "text": "Actually, Maria Karolina was intended for Louis XVI until the death of her older sister Maria Josefa. Maria Karolina married Maria Josefa's betrothed, Ferdinand of Naples and Sicily, to keep the Spanish alliance and Marie Antoinette was then betrothed to Louis XVI to keep the French alliance.\n\nThat is just a legend... The Archduchess offered to Paris was always Antonia, who was by long the most beautiful of the younger daughters and also the most age appropriate for the Dauphin.\n\nOTL Maria Theresia after Josepha’s death offered to Charles III of Spain the choice between her remaining available daughters aka Maria Amelia and Maria Karolina as new bride for the King of Naples.\n\nIf Karolina was intended for Versailles she would not be offered as choice for the King of Naples (and likely Antonia would have)... likely Karolina and Amalia had not yet a match ready for them at the time of Josepha’s death while Antonia was already offered in France...\n\nFrance had the priority over Naples so the Archduchess who was offered to Paris would have been reserved for them.\n\nPlus I have read many books about Maria Theresia, Marie Antoinette and Maria Karolina and in none of them I have read a reference to the supposition who Antonia was not the first choice for the French match (at least with the Dauphin, because a match between Archduchess Elisabeth, the other beauty of the family (at least before the smallpox) and Louis XV and a match between one of the Mesdames and Joseph II were also suggested)\n\nPlaying the game (and my list is long):\n\nEmpress Maud and Stephen of Blois (a pity he was already married to another Matilde)\n\nRichard I of England and Alais of France (if only his father had let them marry at the right time)\n\nArthur of Brittany and Marie of France\n\nLouis VIII of France and Eleanor of Brittany\n\nNicholas of Anjou and Mary of Burgundy\n\nLouis XI and Mary of Burgundy\n\nMaximilian of Austria and Elizabeth of York\n\nNicholas of Anjou and Anne de Beaujeu\n\nCharles VIII and Elizabeth of York\n\nCharles VIII and Catherine of Navarre\n\nJames IV of Scotland and Cecily of York\n\nRichard III and Elizabeth of York (but in a situation very different from OTL)\n\nEdward V of England and Juana of Castile\n\nRichard of Shrewsbury and Anne of Brittany\n\nManuel of Portugal and Juana of Castile\n\nJean d’Albret and Anne of Brittany\n\nEdward V of England and Anne of Brittany\n\nLudovico Sforza and Isabella d’Este (I absolutely ship Ludovico with his OTL wife Beatrice but still would be fun seeing Isabella in Milan)\n\nHenry VIII and Eleanor of Austria\n\nJohn III of Portugal and Eleanor of Austria\n\nFerdinand of Austria and Isabella of Portugal (possible only if he was recognized heir of Spain)\n\nHenry Percy and Anne Boleyn\n\nHenry VIII and Margaret of Angoulême (need circumstances different from OTL for working)\n\nFrancis I and Mary Tudor (his OTL stepmother-in-law)\n\nJames V of Scotland and Mary I of England\n\nFrancesco II Sforza and Bona Sforza\n\nEdward VI of England and Mary I of Scotland\n\nEdward VI of England and Elisabeth of France\n\nEdward VI of England and Jane Grey\n\nRobert Dudley and Elizabeth I of England\n\nPhilip II of Spain and Mary I of Scotland\n\nDon Carlos of Spain and Elisabeth of France\n\nFerdinand II of Austria and Elizabeth Stuart of England (would be so fun)\n\nCharles II of England and Anne Marie Louise of Orléans\n\nPhilip IV of Spain and Anne Marie Louise of Orléans\n\nFerdinand III of Austria and Maria Eugenia or Isabella Maria Theresa of Spain\n\nFerdinand IV of Austria and Maria Theresa of Spain\n\nBalthasar Carlos of Spain and Mariana of Austria\n\nLeopold I of Austria and Marguerite of Orléans\n\nLouis XIV of France and Henriette Anne of England\n\nJames II of England and Claudia Felicitas of Austria-Tyrol\n\nWilliam III of Orange and Elizabeth Charlotte of Palatinate\n\nPeter II of Portugal and Anne of York\n\nCharles VI of Austria and Elizabeth Farnese\n\nFrederick the a Great of Prussia and Maria Theresa of Austria\n\nCharles III of Spain and Maria Anna of Austria\n\nLouis XV of France and Mariana Victoria of Spain\n\nLouis XV of France and Marie Elisabeth of Austria\n\nLouis, Duke of Bourgogne (Louis XVI’s older brother) and Marie Antoinette of Austria\n\nKarl of Zweibrücken and Maria Amalia of Austria (really the fact who Christine was able to make a much worse match is really injust)\n\nFerdinand IV of Naples and Maria Josepha of Austria\n\nKarl of Austria-Teschen and Maria Ludovica of Austria-Este\n\nLouis XVII of France and Maria Antonia of Naples\n\nKarl of Austria-Teschen and Marie Therese Charlotte of France\n\nLouis Philippe of Orléans (OTL King of the French) and Marie Therese Charlotte of France\n\nFredrick, Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte and Catherine of Russia\n\nLouis Bonaparte and Maria Luisa of Spain (Dowager Queen of Etruria)\n\nEugene de Beauharnais and Maria Amelia of Naples\n\nFerdinand III of Tuscany and Hortense de Beauharnais\n\nFerdinand VII of Spain and Hortense de Beauharnais\n\nFranz Joseph of Austria and Duchess Helene in Bavaria\n\nFranz Joseph of Austria and Anne of Prussia\n\nMaximilian of Austria (OTL Emperor of Mexico) and Duchess Elisabeth in Bavaria\n\nLudwig II of Bavaria and Duchess Sophie Charlotte in Bavaria\n\nRudolf of Austria and anyone but Stephanie of Belgium\n\nWilhelm I of Prussia and Elisa Radziwill\n\nAlbert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Helene of Orléans\n\nAlbert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Victoria Mary of Teck\n\nGeorge V of England and Alix of Hesse\n\nWilliam Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington and Princess Elizabeth of the United Kingdom\n\nPeter Townsend and Princess Margaret of United Kingdom\n\nJohn Fitzgerald Kennedy and Grace Kelly\n\nCouples who were married in OTL but I still consider failed ships\n\nJames V of Scotland and Madeleine of France (deserved a much longer wedding)\n\nLouis XII of France (as Duke of Orléans) and Anne of Brittany (as first wedding for her)\n\nMaximilian of Austria and Anne of Brittany (they were married only in name)\n\nFrancis I of France and Eleanor of Austria (as first wedding for both or at least for her, not the OTL disaster)\n\nEdward Seymour and Katherine Grey\n\nFranz Ferdinand of Austria and Duchess Sophie Choteck (they deserved to have a full wedding)\n\nWilliam Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington and Kathleen Kennedy (their story is a true tragedy)"
