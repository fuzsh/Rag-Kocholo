        "text": "A deadly rivalry between royal cousins\n\nLouis, the First Duke of Orleans, was the second son of the French King Charles V. Louis’ older brother became King Charles VI of France, but his ability to reign was challenged by his mental illness (explored more in this article about the King’s mental health). Queen Isabeau, Charles’ wife, formed a regency council to take over rule for her addled husband. Orleans, as the only brother of the King and the adult male closest to the throne, was naturally placed on this council. However, there were rumors that Louis and his sister-in-law, Isabeau, were engaged in an affair. This gossip angered various members of the French court.\n\nOne such peeved noble was Duke John of Burgundy. The Duke of Burgundy was also in line to the French throne. Burgundy was the first cousin of the King and Orleans as all three were grandsons of King John II of France. Burgundy wanted to increase his power and was suspicious of Louis’ closeness with the Queen. Burgundy sought to be named regent of the French royal heir, the Dauphin Louis. Orleans disputed this and for a time, was supported as the preferred candidate for regent. As Orleans was the brother of the King, it was viewed that he had preference as regent, over Burgundy, who was merely the King’s cousin."
