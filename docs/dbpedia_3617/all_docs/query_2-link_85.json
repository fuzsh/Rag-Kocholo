        "text": "Full Name: Called Louis the Prudent\n\nProfession: King of France\n\nBiography: Nicknamed 'the Prudent\" Louis XI inherited a country from his father Charles VI that was weak and besieged by forces from outside the kingdom and within. By the time of his death in 1453 Louis was able to leave behind a more prosperous expanded Kingdom.\n\nLouis's relationship with his father was a fractious one. At just 16 Louis took part in an uprising against Charles, the Praguerie, which failed. His father officially forgave him and he was given The Dauphin√©, then separate from France, to administrate.\n\nDuring his reign Louis was known for his scheming and for his constant travel throughout the kingdom. His organisation of the royal postal routes strengthened communications across the kingdom. He also abolished the Pragmatic Sanction, ensuring the Papacy could have little control over the Gallic church.\n\nLouis' other achievements included finally ending the Hundred Years' War with England by signing the Treaty of Picquigny in 1475 with Edward IV. After the death of his sworn enemy Charles, Duke of Burgundy, Louis was also able to absorb the Duchy of Burgundy into the crown.\n\nBorn: July 3, 1423\n\nBirthplace: Bourges, France\n\nStar Sign: Cancer"
