Thence Creed and I to the King's Head ordinary, where much and very good company, among others one very talking man, but a scholler, that would needs put in his discourse and philosophy upon every occasion, and though he did well enough, yet his readiness to speak spoilt all. Here they say that the Turkes go on apace, and that my Lord Castlehaven is going to raise 10,000 men here for to go against him; that the King of France (age 25) do offer to assist the Empire upon condition that he may be their Generalissimo, and the Dolphin (age 1) chosen King of the Romans: and it is said that the King of France (age 25) do occasion this difference among the Christian Princes of the Empire, which gives the Turke such advantages. They say also that the [his grandfather] King of Spayne (age 58) is making all imaginable force against Portugall again.\n\nEvelyn's Diary. 06 Jul 1686.

She made me a character of ye [his father] French King (age 47) and Dauphin (age 24), and of ye persecution. That they kept much of the cruelties from the King's knowledge; that the Dauphin was so afraid of his father, that he durst not let any thing appeare of his sentiments; that he hated letters and priests, spent all his time in hunting, and seem'd to take no notice of what was passing.\n\nOn 03 Nov 1701 [his son] Philippe V King Spain (age 17) and [his daughter-in-law] Maria Luisa Savoy (age 13) were married. They were second cousins. She a great granddaughter of King Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland 1600-1649.
