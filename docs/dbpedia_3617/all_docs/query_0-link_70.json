KINGS of BAVARIA. 110\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBavaria was the only one of the four original provinces of Germany to maintain an autonomous existence within part of its original territory throughout the medieval and into the modern period. Formed as a Frankish protectorate by the Merovingians, and ruled by the dukes of the Agilolfing family, Bavaria was more or less independent from the mid-7th century. The Carolingians were less tolerant of this situation and invaded Bavaria in 724, 743 and 749 . Charles I King of the Franks finally conquered the duchy of Bavaria in 788, forcing the abdication of the last Agilolfing Duke Tassilo II. Bavaria was incorporated into the Frankish kingdom as a province, and was a sub-kingdom of the Carolingian Frankish empire from 814.\n\nAfter more than two centuries as a province in the Frankish empire, the Luitpolding family reasserted Bavarian autonomy in the early 10th century, by which time the central power of the Carolingians was in significant decline. Luitpold, the earliest known definite ancestor of the family, was related to Emperor Arnulf (although the precise relationship is unknown) who installed him in Bavaria in [895/98]. Some contemporary sources attribute the title dux to Luitpold and his son Arnulf, although others refer to them as comes. It is clear that the title dux was not at first formally recognised by the central authority of the kings of Germany as the early dukes are consistently referred to as comes in imperial diplomas until after the accession of King Otto I in 936. The deposition of Duke Eberhard in 938 by King Otto marked a temporary decline in the region's authority on a national level. Nevertheless, the internal position of the Bavarian dukes remained strong and unified, enabling them to maintain considerable influence over the counties within their duchy and claim reversionary rights in the estates of families which became extinct . This is typified by the duke's role as commander of the tribal levy, in which even troops supplied to the king of Germany by the Bavarian bishops formed part of the ducal forces .\n\nBetween the mid-940s and 1180, the dukes of Bavaria belonged to seven different dynasties. Ducal appointment remained in the hands of the king/emperor who used it both as a means of rewarding service and strengthening his personal control over the province. The latter objective was in practice only achieved when the king/emperor retained the duchy within his own hands, as was the case with Heinrich II, Heinrich III and Heinrich IV (through his mother) at various different times in the 11th century. The installation of imperial relatives as dukes provided no guarantee of pliability, as Emperor Otto I found with his rebellious nephew Duke Heinrich II.\n\nThe territory of the early marches in Bavaria remained under the control of the duke, who was the suzerain of the Markgrafen, which contrasted with the situation in Saxony. The march of the \"Bayerischen Nordgau\" was established by King Otto I in the early 940s along the border with Bohemia. The Ostmark, which later evolved into the margraviate of Austria, was formed in 976 by Emperor Otto II along the frontier with Hungary, although Markgrafen in the \"Pannonian March\" are recorded about a century earlier (see the document AUSTRIA). The \"Kärntner Mark\", which later developed into the Steiermark or Styria, was also established in the late 10th century, although the precise date is uncertain. Lastly, the march of Istria, which was able to establish greater autonomy because of its geographic distance from the central authority, was formed in north-east Italy in the early 11th century (see the document CARINTHIA for the Kärtner Mark and the march of Istria).\n\nAll the counties in Bavaria were fiefs of the duke, contrasting once more with the situation in Saxony. Jordan asserts that there is no record in the 12th century of a count in Bavaria being appointed by the crown , although it is clear that there must have been some crown land in Bavaria as Emperor Friedrich I \"Barbarossa\" enfeoffed Heinrich \"der Löwe\" with numerous imperial fiefs when he installed him as duke of Bavaria in 1156 . Regensburg, always the residence of the dukes of Bavaria, became an imperial free city in the 13th century.\n\nReligious administration in Bavaria centred on the archbishopric of Salzburg, established by the Carolingians in 785. The bishoprics within the province were Freising, Passau and Regensburg, all dating from the mid-8th century. In addition, the bishoprics of Eichstätt and Augsburg in Bavaria, also founded around the same time, fell within the archiepiscopal province of Mainz. Heinrich II King of Germany established the bishopric of Bamberg in 1007 as an exempt see, outside any archiepiscopal province and responsible direct to the Pope, presumably as a means of increasing imperial control in Bavaria over both church and lay authorities.\n\nThe original territory of Bavaria was significantly reduced when Carinthia was separated as a separate duchy in 976. The march of Austria remained a fiefdom of the duchy of Bavaria until 1156, when it was elevated to the status of a separate duchy in order to compensate Heinrich II Markgraf of Austria for the loss of Bavaria when Emperor Friedrich I \"Barbarossa\" returned it to the Welf family . In 1180, after Emperor Friedrich I deprived Heinrich \"der Löwe\" Duke of Bavaria and Saxony of his titles, he further partitioned Bavaria, creating Otto von Wittelsbach as duke in the Bavarian heartland and transforming the margraviate of Styria into a separate duchy . Rule over different parts of Bavaria ( Lower Bavaria in the north and Upper Bavaria in the south) was divided between different family members.\n\nAlthough by then its territory was truncated, the Wittelsbach duchy consolidated its position and remained a powerful force in regional and international politics until the fall of the German Empire after the First World war.\n\nChapter 1. DUKES of BAVARIA, AGILOLFING families\n\nThere is considerable uncertainty about the early dukes of Bavaria, not only their relationship to each other but even their names and order of succession. The mid-13th century Series Ducum Bavariæ lists, in order, the dukes from 514 as Theodo \"dux primus\", Theodo II, \"Garibaldus rex\", Tassilo [I] dux, Theodo III \"quem sanctus Ruodbertus baptizavit\", Theodebertus, Theodo IV \"qui cum filiis sanctum Corbiniacum locavit Frisinge\", Theodaldus dux, Grimoaldus dux \"fratris filius\", Hugpertus dux, Udilo dux \"cum Theodone frater\", Thassilo dux II \"cum filio eius Theodone\" . This listing is not consistent with earlier sources. The following attempts to highlights the differences but inevitably remains an incomplete assessment. As noted in the Introduction to the present document, the Carolingians conquered Bavaria in 788 and reduced it to a province in the Frankish empire.\n\nTHEODO, son of --- (-514). THEODO I Duke of Bavaria. The death in 514 of \"Theodo dux Baioariæ\" is recorded in the Excerpta Altahensia .\n\nTheodo I had one child:\n\n1. THEODO (-after 520). He succeeded his father in 514 as THEODO II Duke of Bavaria. The succession in 514 of \"Theodo filius eius [=Theodo dux Baioariæ]\" is recorded in the Excerpta Altahensia . The Annales Ducum Bavariæ record that the Roman army was defeated by \"Theodone secundo\" at Oettingen in 520 .\n\n1. GARIBALD (-[591]) . GARIBALD I Duke of Bavaria. The Salzburg Annals record that \"Gerbaldus Bawariæ regnum accepit\" in 598 , although this is inconsistent with the dates attributed in other sources to Duke Tassilo I (see below). The references in primary sources to his wife imply that Garibald was already duke of Bavaria at the time of his marriage. m (after 555) as her third husband, WALDRADA, widow (firstly) of THEODEBALD I King of the Franks, repudiated wife (secondly) of CLOTAIRE I King of the Franks, daughter of WACCHO King of the Lombards & his second wife Ostrogotha of the Gepides. The Origo Gentis Langobardorum names \"Wisigarda secundæ Walderada\" as the two daughters of Wacho & his second wife, specifying that Waldrada married \"Scusuald regis Francorum\" and later \"Garipald\" . The Historia Langobardorum names \"Waldrada\" as Wacho's second daughter by his second wife, specifying that she married \"Chusubald rex Francorum\" . Paulus Diaconus names \"Wisigarda [et] secunda Walderada\" as the two daughters of King Wacho & his second wife, specifying that Walderada married \"Cusupald alio regi Francorum\" and later \"Garipald\" . Gregory of Tours names Vuldetrada as the wife of King Theodebald . Herimannus names \"Wanderadam\" wife of \"Theodpaldus rex Francorum\" when recording her second marriage to \"Lotharius rex patris eius Theodeberti patruus\" . According to Gregory of Tours, King Clotaire \"began to have intercourse\" with the widow of King Theodebald, before \"the bishops complained and he handed her over to Garivald Duke of Bavaria\" , which does not imply that King Clotaire married Waldrada. Duke Garibald & his wife had three children:\n\na) GUNDOALD (-murdered 612). Fredegar records that \"Gundoaldus\" invaded part of the kingdom of Guntram King of the Franks in Nov [584] . The Liber Historiæ Francorum records that the Burgundians and Austrasians entered \"paygo Suessionico cum Gundoaldo et Wintrione\" and were defeated at \"Brinnacum villam\" and fled after the battle, dated to soon after the accession (in 592) of Childebert II as king in Burgundy . The Annales Ducum Bavariæ name \"Gundoaldo\" as son of \"Garibaldo rege Baiorionem\" when recording that he and his father fled to Authari King of the Lombards in 593 . Duke of Asti: the Origo Gentis Langobardorum records that \"Theudelenda frater Gundoald\" accompanied his sister to Italy and was installed as \"ducem in civitatem Astense\" by his brother-in-law King Authari . Fredegar records the death of Gundoald \"shot with an arrow while he was relieving nature\" . Paulus Diaconus records that \"Gunduald germanus Theudelindæ reginæ dux in civitate Astensi\" was killed by an arrow . m ---, a Lombard. Fredegar records the marriage of \"Gundoaldus\" and \"de gente nobile Langobardorum uxorem\", naming their two sons \"Gundeberto et Chairiberto\" . Gundoald & his wife had two children:\n\ni) GUNDEBERT . Fredegar names \"Gundeberto et Chairiberto\" as the two sons of Gundoald & his wife .\n\nii) CHARIBERT (-after [628]) . Fredegar names \"Gundeberto et Chairiberto\" as the two sons of Gundoald & his wife . He supported his cousin Gundberga Queen of the Lombards in her dispute with her husband . This dispute must have taken place in 628 at the earliest, assuming that the queen remained in exile for three years and her husband's accession took place in 625. same person as ? ARIBERT (-Ticino 661, bur Basilica of the Saviour, Ticinum). Paulus Diaconus records that Rodoald King of the Lombards was succeeded by \"Aripert, filius Gundoaldi, qui fuerat germanus Theudelindæ reginæ\" . If this is correct, King Aribert was the first cousin, on her mother's side, of Queen Gundberga, the wife of at least two of King Aribert's predecessors. Primary sources report the activities of Queen Gundberga in detail, suggesting that she may have been a person of sufficient influence at the Lombard court to have engineered the succession of her relative. However, the relationship is not corroborated in other identified sources, all of which are silent on the origin of King Aripert. He succeeded in 652 as ARIPERT King of the Lombards.\n\n- KINGS of the LOMBARDS.\n\nb) THEODELINDIS . Her first betrothal is recorded by Fredegar who specifies that \"Ago rex\" married \"Grimoaldi et Gundoaldi germanam Teudelendæ ex genere Francorum\" who had been betrothed to \"Childebertus\" . The Origo Gentis Langobardorum names \"Theudelenda filia Garipald et Walderade de Baiuaria\" as the wife of \"Autarine filio Claffoni\" . Paulus Diaconus records the betrothal of \"Flavius rex Authari\" and \"Garibaldi regis Theudelindam suam filiam\" and their subsequent marriage \"Idus Maius\" . The Salzburg Annals name \"Gerbaldi regis filiam Theodelingam\" when recording her marriage to \"Otharius rex Lombardorum\" . The marriage of \"Theodolindum filiam Gerwaldi regis Baioariorum\" to \"Otharius rex Longobardorum\" is recorded in the Excerpta Altahensia . Paulus Diaconus records that, after the death of her first husband, \"Theudelinda\" wisely chose \"Agilulfum ducem Taurinatium\" as her husband and king of the Lombards . The Annales Ducum Bavariæ record her second marriage to \"Aigilulfus rex Lombardum\" . The Origo Gentis Langobardorum records that \"Theudelenda filia Garipald et Walderade de Baiuaria\" married secondly \"Acquo\" who installed himself as king . The Chronicle of Andreas of Bergamo names \"Teudelinda filia Garibaldi Baioariorum rex\" as the wife first of Autari and then of Agilolf . Betrothed to CHILDEBERT II King of the Franks in Austrasia, son of SIGEBERT I King of the Franks & his wife Brunechildis of the Visigoths (570-[2/28] Mar 596). m firstly (before [590]) as his second wife, AUTHACHAR [Authari] King of the Lombards, son of KLEPH King of the Lombards & his wife --- (-5 Sep 590). m secondly (late 590 or after) [as his second wife,] AGILOLF King of the Lombards, son of --- (-615).\n\nc) daughter . Paulus Diaconus records that \"Euin dux Tridentinorum\" married \"filiam Garibaldi Baioariorum regis\" . m EVIN --- (-[590/96]). Paulus Diaconus records that \"Euin Tridentinus dux\" was given \"Tridentinum territorium\" after it was devastated by \"duce Francorum Chramnichis\" whom he defeated \"in loco qui Salurnis dicitur\" . Paulus Diaconus records that \"Euin dux Tridentinus\" led the army of King Authari when he invaded Istria . Paulus Diaconus records the death of \"Euin duce in Tridentu\" and that \"Gaidoaldus\" was installed as his successor . This text immediately precedes the report of the death of Childebert II King of the Franks which is dated to 596.\n\n1. TASSILO, son of --- (-609). TASSILO I Duke of Bavaria 591. Paulus Diaconus records that \"Tassilo\" was ordained as \"Baioarium rex\" by \"Childeberto rege Francorum\" . This passage is included in the text after the accession of Agilulf King of the Lombards, which is dated to [590], but before the report of the death of Evin Duke of Trentino. The Annales Ducum Bavariæ record that \"Tassilo dux\" reigned in Bavaria in 593 . m ---. The name of Duke Tassilo's wife is not known. Duke Tassilo I & his wife had one child:\n\na) GARIBALD (-640). Paulus Diaconus names \"Tassilone duce Baiorariorum, filius eius Garibaldus\" when recording that he was defeated by the Slavs \"in Agunto\" after his father died . GARIBALD II Duke of Bavaria 609.\n\n1. CHRODOALD, son of --- (-murdered [625/26]) . Fredegar records that \"ex procerebus de gente nobile Aygolfingam nomen Chrodoaldus\" fell into disfavour with King Dagobert I \"through the instrumentality of Bishop Arnulf\" as he \"was for ever greedily seizing the property of others [and] as proud and insolent as could be\", and that he was killed in the 41st year of the reign of King Clotaire II by \"Berthar homo Scarponiensis\" . It is not known how Chrodoald was related to the Agilolfing family of the Dukes of Bavaria, if at all. m (before 609) --- of the Franks, daughter of [SIGEBERT I King of the Franks & his wife Brunechildis of the Visigoths]. The Vita Columbani names \"Chrodoaldus regi Theuderico fideli\" and his wife \"amitam Theudeberti regis\" . Chrodoald & his wife had one child:\n\na) FARA (-killed in battle 641). Dux in Austrasia. Fredegar records that \"Faram filio Chrodoaldo\" rebelled against King Sigebert, helped by Radulf Duke of Thuringia, but was killed .\n\n1. --- . Duke of Bavaria. The identity of this Bavarian duke is not known, assuming that the report of Paulus Diaconus is accurate. m --- of Friulia, daughter of GISULF II Duke of Friulia & his wife Romilda --- (before 610-). Paulus Diaconus names \"una Appa alia Gaila duarum vero nomina non retinemus\" as the daughters of \"Gisulfus Foroiulanus dux\", recording that one later married \"Alamannorum regi, alia Baioariorum principi\", without specifying which .\n\n1. THEODO, son of --- . THEODO III Duke of Bavaria 640. The Annales Ducum Bavariæ name (in order) \"Theodo Theodo [et] Theodebertum\" as Dukes of Bavaria . The mid-13th century Series Ducum Bavariæ lists, in order, the dukes from 514 as Theodo \"dux primus\", Theodo II, \"Garibaldus rex\", Tassilo [I] dux, Theodo III \"quem sanctus Ruodbertus baptizavit\" . Presumably \"sanctus Rudobertus\" refers to Ruotbert who was the first Abbot and Bishop of Salzburg from 696 to 717. If this is correct, this baptism cannot refer to Duke Theodo III, the dates being more consistent with Duke Theodo V (see below). Some corroboration for the baptism of a duke Theodo is provided by the Excerpta Altahensia, which records the baptism in 580 of \"Theodonem ducem\" . In this case the date of the baptism is much earlier than the likely dates of Duke Theodo III, and falls during the reign of Duke Garibald I. Clearly there is something fundamentally wrong with the chronology.\n\n1. THEODO, son of --- . THEODO IV Duke of Bavaria. The Annales Ducum Bavariæ name (in order) \"Theodo Theodo [et] Theodebertum\" as Dukes of Bavaria, this being the second Theodo . The mid-13th century Series Ducum Bavariæ lists, in order, the dukes from 514 as Theodo \"dux primus\", Theodo II, \"Garibaldus rex\", Tassilo [I] dux, Theodo III \"quem sanctus Ruodbertus baptizavit\", Theodebertus, Theodo IV \"qui cum filiis sanctum Corbiniacum locavit Frisinge\" , which appears to ignore this Duke Theodo IV. Theodo IV had one child:\n\na) LANTPERT . The Annales Ducum Bavariæ name \"Lantpertus\" as son of the second \"Theodo\", recording that he killed \"sanctum Emmaramum\" .\n\n1. THEODEBERT, son of --- . THEODEBERT Duke of Bavaria. The Annales Ducum Bavariæ name (in order) \"Theodo Theodo [et] Theodebertum\" as Dukes of Bavaria, recording that \"Aspirandus et Liuprandus\" fled to \"Theodebertus dux\" in 670 .\n\n[Two] siblings:\n\n1.

Einhard names \"Swannhilde neptem Odilonis ducis Baioariorum\" as the mother of Grifo . The precise relationship between Suanhilde and Pilitrude, who was the wife in turn of the brothers Grimoald and Theodoald, has not been identified. She instigated the marriage of her stepdaughter to Odilo Duke of Bavaria according to the Continuator of Fredegar . After the death of her husband, she incited her son to rebel against her stepsons.

Reading these two sources together, the impression is that Odilo may have been a brother of Dukes Grimoald and Theodald. However, all sources so far identified only name the latter two as the sons of Duke Theodo. It is assumed that Odilo was not the brother or son of Duke Hugobert, whom he succeeded, as such a relationship is not mentioned in any of the contemporary sources so far identified. It appears more likely that Odilo was related more remotely to his predecessors, but the precise relationship can only be guessed at. He succeeded in 739 as ODILO Duke of Bavaria.

This the only source so far identified which names this supposed brother of Duke Odilo.]\n\nODILO, son of --- (-18 Jan 748, bur Hostenhoven, Kloster Gengenbach) . The parentage of Odilo is not known. Einhard names \"Swannhilde neptem Odilonis ducis Baioariorum\" as the mother of Grifo . The Continuator of Fredegar names \"matrona quondam Beletrude et nepta sua Sunnichilde\" . Reading these two sources together, the impression is that Odilo may have been a brother of Dukes Grimoald and Theodald. However, as shown above, all sources so far identified only name the latter two as the sons of Duke Theodo. It is assumed that Odilo was not the brother or son of Duke Hugobert, whom he succeeded, as such a relationship is not mentioned in any of the contemporary sources so far identified. It appears more likely that Odilo was related more remotely to his predecessors, but the precise relationship can only be guessed at. He succeeded in 739 as ODILO Duke of Bavaria. The Salzburg Annals record that Odilo succeeded as Duke of Bavaria in 739 following the death of \"Hucbertus dux Bawarie\" . The Annales Ducum Bavariæ also record that \"Oudilo dux\" succeeded \"Hucpertus dux\" . He married his wife without the permission of her brothers . His brother-in-law Carloman invaded Bavaria, and Odilo was forced to recognise Frankish suzerainty in 744. The Annales Metenses record the death in 749 of \"dux Odilo\" .

After the death of her husband, she was captured by Grifo who usurped the throne from her son . After her son was restored, Hiltrude became regent in Bavaria during his minority.\n\nDuke Odilo & his wife had one child:\n\n1. TASSILO ([742]-11 Dec or 5 Jan after 794) . Herimannus names \"Tassilonem\" son of \"sororis suæ [=Pipinus] Hiltrudis filium\" . The Historia Episcoporum Pataviensium et Ducum Bavariæ records the birth in 742 of \"Tassilo [II] dux\" . The Annales Metenses record the succession of \"Tassilo filius eius [=dux Odilo]\" after the death of his father in 749 . After the death of Tassilo's father, Grifo, brother of Pepin maiordomus of the Franks, invaded Bavaria where he was recognised as Duke but was deposed by his brother who installed his nephew as TASSILO II Duke of Bavaria . Duke Tassilo swore vassalage to Pepin King of the Franks at Compiègne in 757 . Tassilo deserted King Pepin in Aquitaine in 763, returning to Bavaria . The Salzburg Annals record that Tassilo subjugated Carinthia in 772 . He eventually surrendered to King Charles in 787 and renewed his oath of vassalage . He rebelled again in 788, making contacts with the Avars who attacked the Franks, but was obliged by the king to be tonsured .

MARKGRAFEN in BAVARIA 9th CENTURY\n\nThe following two individuals are referred to in primary sources as Markgrafen in Bavaria. The precise extent of their jurisdiction is not known, but the title implies rule over a \"March\". It is possible that this Bavarian March is the same as the March of Pannonia, over which Markgrafen are recorded during the 870s to 890s (see the document AUSTRIA).\n\n1. ENGELDEO, son of --- (-after 895) . King Carloman granted property \"in pago Tonageuue in comitatu Engildeo\" to the priest Iob by charter dated 3 Dec 878 . \"Arnolfus rex\" granted property \"in pago Nordgouue in comitatu sui senioris in loci Phuncina\" to \"Engildeonis comitis vassallo Gotahelmi\" by charter dated 889 . \"Arnolfus rex\" granted property \"in pago Quinzingouue in comitatu Hunolfi\" to Kloster St Emmeram by charter dated 21 Mar 890 which names \"Engildeo comes, Odalrich comes, Meginhart comes, Chunipercht comes, Kerolt comes, Rumolt comes, Geio comes\" . Markgraf [in Bavaria] [890/95]. The Annales Fuldenses record that \"Engildieo marchensis Baioariorum\" was deprived of his honours in 895, and in his place that \"Liutboldus nepos regis\" was appointed . \"Arnolfus rex\" returned land in \"pago Nortgowe in comitatu Cheldionis\", previously taken by \"Hildigardis neptis nostra et Engeldichd comes et Sigo vicarius eius\", to \"Megingozo vasallo Erkenboldi episcopi\" by charter dated 5 May 895 .\n\nLUITPOLD, son of --- ([850/60]-killed in battle near Pressburg 4 Jul 907) .

Markgraf [in Bavaria]: the Annales Fuldenses record that \"Engildieo marchensis Baioariorum\" was deprived of his honours in 895, and in his place that \"Liutboldus nepos regis\" was appointed .

[Duke] of Bavaria: the Annales Ducum Bavariæ record that \"Arnulfus [rex]\" left the duchy of Bavaria to \"Leupoldo cuidam nobili\" in 899 . \"Ludovuicus rex\" donated property to Kloster St Florian by charter dated 19 Jan 901 on the proposal of \"Liutbaldi comitis et propinqui nostri\" . It is possible that Luitpold ruled as Duke of Bohemia in 903, as shown by the charter dated 24 Jun 903 under which \"Hludowicus rex\" confirmed privileges to Kloster St Gallen in which among \"fidelium nostrum\" was listed \"Luitpold dux Boemanorum\" , although it is possible that \"Boemanorum\" was a copyist's error for \"Baiorariorum\" as this appears to be the only reference to Luitpold ruling in Bohemia. \"Hludowicus rex\" granted property to the church of Freising by charter dated 30 Nov 903 in which among \"fidelium nostrum\" was listed \"Liutboldi illustris comitis et cari propinqui nostri\" . \"Hludowicus rex\" granted property \"in valle Liupinatal in comitatu eiusdem Otacherii\" to \"Otacharii comitis nostri filio Arpo\" after consulting \"fidelium nostrorum Luitpoldi, Arponis, Iringi, Cumpoldi et Paponis comitum\" by charter dated 10 Mar 904 . \"Hludowicus rex\" confirmed an exchange of properties between Kloster Fulda and Kloster Echternach after consulting \"fidelium nostrorum comitum vero Kebeharti, Luitpoldi, Burcharti, Eginonis, Liutfredi, Iringi et Cunpoldi\" by charter dated 19 Mar 907 .

However, considering the likely birth date of his eldest son Arnulf, the mother of the latter must have been born in [860/70]. If this is correct, a marriage in 913 between the widow of Duke Luitpold, then beyond child-bearing age, and Konrad I King of Germany would seem surprising.]\n\nm [secondly] as her first husband, KUNIGUNDE, sister of Graf ERCHANGER [Ahalolfinger], daughter of --- (-after 7 Jun 914, bur Kloster Lorsch). Her two marriages are confirmed by the Annales Alamannicorum which record the marriage in 913 of \"sororem [Erchangeri] Liupoldi relictam\" with the king . Her second husband arranged their marriage in an unsuccessful attempt to ally himself with her brother and with Arnulf Duke of Bavaria . \"Chuonradus rex\" granted rights to Kloster Lorsch by charter dated 7 Jun 914 which names \"coniugis nostre Chunigunde regine\" . She married secondly (913) Konrad I King of Germany [Konradiner].\n\nLuitpold & his [first] wife had one child:\n\n1. ARNULF ([875/85]-14 Jul 937, bur Regensburg St Emmeram) . Regino records that \"filius suus [=Liutbaldus dux] Arnulfus\" succeeded his father as dux in 907 . The Salzburg Annals name \"Liupoldus dux, pater Arnolfi ducis\" . His birth date range is estimated based on the likelihood that Arnulf must have been adult and established in his career when he was accepted as his father's successor in 907, but must be considered approximate. He referred to himself in 908 as ARNULF Duke of Bavaria in a charter confirming an exchange of land between Drakolf Bishop of Freising and Konrad chor-bishop of Freising .\n\n- see below.\n\nLuitpold & his [second] wife had one child:\n\n2. BERTHOLD (-23 Nov 947, bur Kloster Niederaltaich) . Liutprand names \"Bertaldus Bagoariorum dux\" as brother of \"Arnulfi ducis\" . It seems more likely that Berthold was the son of Duke Luitpold by his wife Kunigunde, bearing in mind that the latter's brother was also named Berthold. Judging from the known dates of Berthold's career, it would not be surprising if he was born several years after his [half-]brother Arnulf, whose birth date is estimated in [875/85] as shown above. He was installed as BERTHOLD Duke of Bavaria in 938 by Otto I King of Germany after the rebellion and expulsion of his nephew Eberhard, marking a decline in Bavarian autonomy which was symbolised by King Otto appointing Herolt as the new archbishop of Salzburg in 939 . \"Otto rex\" gave Abtei Moosburg to the bishopric of Freising at the request of \"ducis Perchtoldi Bavariensis regionis principum\" by charter dated 29 May 940 . \"Otto rex\" gave property \"in pago Ufgovve in comitatu Marchvvardi iuxta rivum Fuchtebah\" to \"comiti Marchvvardo [vassallo ducis Perchtoldi]\" by charter dated 13 Jul 940 at the request of \"ducis nostri Perchtoldi, simul et Kerungi ac Hiltiboldi comitum\" . \"Otto rex\" granted property to \"nostri servum Reginpreht\" at the request of \"ducis Perehtoldi et Hiltibaldi comitis cuidam comiti Cadelahc\" by charter dated 22 Sep 942 .

She founded the convent of Bergen. Duke Berthold & his wife had [two] children:\n\na) HEINRICH (-5 Oct 989, bur [Niederaltaich]) . \"Henricus Minor, filius Bertoldi\" is named in the Annalista Saxo, when recording his installation as Duke of Bavaria in 983 . Still a minor on his father's death, he was passed over in the succession to Bavaria when Otto I King of Germany established his own brother Heinrich as Duke . He was appointed HEINRICH I Duke of Carinthia in 976 by Otto II King of Germany who had abstracted both Carinthia and the Italian marches from the duchy of Bavaria to create this new duchy. \"Otto imperator augustus\" freed \"clericum nomine Reginbato\" at the request of \"Heinricus Karentanorum dux\" by charter dated 6 Apr 977 . He supported Heinrich II \"der Zänker\" Duke of Bavaria in his rebellion against his cousin Emperor Otto II. Together, they expelled Bishop Pilgrim from Passau, but were besieged there, put on trial at Magdeburg in 978, and imprisoned . After his release, he was installed as HEINRICH III Duke of Bavaria at Verona in 983 , but deprived of Bavaria in [early 985] when the duchy was returned to Heinrich I \"der Zänker\" as part of the terms of settlement of the latter's rebellion against King Otto III . Heinrich was restored as Duke of Carinthia as part of this settlement . \"Heinricus dux Karintanorum uxoris sue Hiltigardæ\" donated property \"in villa Vfhouun aliam in villa sancti Georgii\" [Aufhofen, St Georg] to Brixen cathedral by charter dated to [985] .

The death of Hiltigard, widow of Heinrich III Duke of Bavaria, is recorded at Bamberg Cathedral on 6 Aug .\n\nb) [KUNIGUNDE . Wegener refers to the donation by Babo Burggraf von Regensburg and his wife Mechtild to St Emmeram dated [1000/05] for their souls and that of his wife's brother \"Perahtold\", which also names her mother Kunigunde , speculating that Kunigunde was the daughter of Berthold Duke of Bavaria. m ULRICH Graf von Schweinachgau, son of ---.]\n\nARNULF, son of LUITPOLD Markgraf in Bavaria & his [first] wife --- ([875/85]-14 Jul 937, bur Regensburg St Emmeram) . Regino records that \"filius suus [=Liutbaldus dux] Arnulfus\" succeeded his father as dux in 907 . The Salzburg Annals name \"Liupoldus dux, pater Arnolfi ducis\" . His birth date range is estimated based on the likelihood that Arnulf must have been adult and established in his career when he was accepted as his father's successor in 907, but must be considered approximate. He referred to himself in 908 as ARNULF Duke of Bavaria in a charter confirming an exchange of land between Drakolf Bishop of Freising and Konrad chor-bishop of Freising . \"Chuonradus rex\" made donations by charter dated 5 Mar 912 with the consent of \"fidelium nostrorum comitum vero Sigihardi, Arnolfi, Erchangarii, Odalrici, Perchtoldi, Chuonradi, Herimanni, Luitfredi atque Iringi\" , which shows not only that Arnulf was not titled \"dux\" in official national documents but also that he was considered second in importance among the nobility in the realm at that time, assuming that the order of the names is of significance. He had the power to distribute bishoprics in his territory, although the right passed to the king of Germany on his death . He was expelled from Bavaria by his stepfather Konrad I King of Germany in 915 but soon returned . A reaffirmation of his rule by the Bavarians in 919 is recorded in the 12th century copies of the Salzburg Annals, which imply that he may have been appointed to rule as king in a wider German context, presumably as a rival to Heinrich I King of Germany . He submitted to King Heinrich in 921 . \"Heinricus rex\" confirmed donations to Kloster Kempten by charter dated 30 Jun 929 at the request of \"comitum Arnolfi et Heberhardi\" . This charter appears to refer to Arnulf and his son, although it is surprising that Arnulf is not referred to with the title \"dux\". The necrology of Fulda records the death in 937 of \"Arnolt dux\" . The necrology of St Gall records the death \"II Id Jul\" of \"Arnolfi ducis Baioariorum\" .\n\nm ---. The name and origin of Duke Arnulf's wife are not known. Wegener speculates that she was --- of Friulia, daughter of Eberhard Duke of the March of Friulia [Unruochingi], ostensibly for onomastic reasons on the basis of the transmission of the names Eberhard and Judith into the family, used first for Duke Arnulf's children. This daughter is, however, not listed among the children of Duke Eberhard set out in the cartulary of Cysoing abbey , although she may be identical to one of the unnamed daughters. From a chronological point of view, it is unlikely that the wife of Arnulf Duke of Bavaria was the daughter of Duke Eberhard. The latter's children must have been born between [840] and [860], whereas Duke Arnulf's children were probably born between [905] and [920], suggesting that their mother was born in [880/90].\n\nDuke Arnulf & his wife had seven child:\n\n1. EBERHARD ([905/10]-after 938) . The Annales ex Annalibus Ivravensibus Antiquis records that \"Longobardi\" accepted \"Eparhardum filium Arnolfi ducis\" as their lord in 934 and that his father confirmed his succession in Bavaria in 935 . His birth date range is based on the assumption that he was adult when accepted as his father's heir in 935. \"Heinricus rex\" confirmed donations to Kloster Kempten by charter dated 30 Jun 929 at the request of \"comitum Arnolfi et Heberhardi\" . This charter appears to refer to Arnulf and his son, although it is surprising that Arnulf is not referred to with the title \"dux\". He succeeded his father in 937 as EBERHARD Duke of Bavaria. Pope Leo VII addressed a letter dated 938 to \"Eberhardo duci Bawariorum\" . After Duke Eberhard defied him in some way, Otto I King of Germany invaded Bavaria twice in 938, deposed Eberhard and forced him into exile after the second expedition .\n\n2. ARNULF (-killed in battle near Regensburg 22 Jul 954). The Annales Sangallenses record that \"Adalbert filius Perehctoldi et Arnolfus filius Arnolfi ducis\" were killed in 954 . He is named as son of Arnulf in 6 Feb 954 . He rebelled against Otto I King of Germany in 954, aiming to re-establish his family's position in Bavaria but was killed in the first siege of Regensburg . The necrology of churches of Freising records the death \"XI Kal Aug\" of \"Arnolt com\" , which is assumed refers to Pfalzgraf Arnulf. m ---. The name of Arnulf's wife is not known. Arnulf & his wife had [two] children:\n\na) BERTHOLD von Reisensburg ([930]-after 21 Jul 976) . The Annales Sancti Emmerammi record that \"Perahtold filius Arnulphi\" was expelled \"de Norica\" in 951 . His birth date is estimated from his adult career starting in 951, but bearing in mind the likely birth date range of his father based on the estimated birth date of his oldest paternal uncle in [905/10]. The Vita S Oudalrici names \"Perehtoldus, filius Arnulfi, de castello Risinesburc\" when recording that he fought the Hungarians in [Aug 955] . \"Otto imperator augustus\" returned property \"quod vocatur Metama\" previously donated by \"Peretoldus Arnoulfi filius\" to Kloster Metten by charter dated 21 Jul 976 \"per petiticionem Heinrici sanctæ Auguste civitatis episcopi et Liutpaldi marchionis\" . m ---. The name of Berthold's wife is not known. Berthold & his wife had [one possible] child:\n\ni) [FRIEDRICH [I] \"Roch\" (-Jerusalem before 1020, bur Jerusalem). According to Wegener, Graf Friedrich [I] was the son of Berthold von Reisensburg . He bases this on \"Berthold\" witnessing several exchanges of property in the oberen Isar dated [990/99], and equating him with Berthold von Reisensburg. Several points can be made about this theory. Firstly, it seems surprising that such an illustrious connection with the Luitpoldinger Dukes of Bavaria would not have been mentioned by the various contemporary sources which relate the early history of the Grafen von Diessen. Secondly, the estimated birth date of Berthold von Reisensburg is restricted to the limited period [929/31], bearing in mind the known dates of his own career and the likely birth date of his father. His last known mention is dated 976. Another burst of activity fourteen years after this date, when he would have been in his sixties, would be surprising. Thirdly, judging from the 976 entry, Berthold von Reisensburg appears to have fallen into disgrace with Emperor Otto III. There is no record of his return to favour. It is therefore likely that his descendants (if any) fell into obscurity. Fourthly, it is surprising that Berthold von Reisensburg would not have been described as comes even in entries relating to the period after his disgrace, as he would presumably have continued to claim and use the title.\n\n- GRAFEN von DIESSEN.]\n\nb) [daughter .

Herimannus names \"Gisela, Counradi regis Burgundiæ filia\" wife of \"Heinricus dux Baioariæ\" and mother of Emperor Heinrich II . Her birth date range is estimated from her having given birth to her eldest son in [976], which also suggests that she must have been King Conrad's daughter by his first marriage. Many contemporary sources confuse Gisela with her niece of the same name, daughter of her half-sister Gerberga & the latter's second husband. For example, the Chronicle of St Bénigne de Dijon names \"sororem regis [Rodulfi Burgundie] Gislam\" as wife of \"Chonradum\" and mother of \"tertium Henricum\" . It is not known why this report is repeated so frequently in other chronicles, for simple chronology demonstrates that it cannot be correct. She was exiled to Merseburg after the trial of her husband in 978 .

He succeeded his father in 995 as HEINRICH IV Duke of Bavaria. He was elected as HEINRICH II \"der Heilige\" King of Germany at Mainz 7 Jun 1002, crowned at Aachen 8 Sep 1002. He challenged the succession in Italy of Arduino Marchese di Ivrea, who had been crowned as king of Italy at Pavia 15 Feb 1002, and entered Trento in Spring 1004 to claim the throne himself. Heinrich was crowned king of Italy at Pavia 14 Apr 1004. He resigned the duchy of Bavaria, appointing his brother-in-law Henri Comte de Luxembourg as duke in 1004, although he retook the title from 1009-1017. King Heinrich II invaded Flanders in 1007 to recapture the march of Valenciennes and also captured Gent. Count Baudouin subsequently arranged an alliance with the emperor who, in 1012, helped him install a new Bishop of Cambrai, enfeoffed him with the islands of Zeeland and, in 1015, with Valenciennes. He left Italy after destroying the town of Pavia in reprisal for a revolt which broke out there. He returned to Italy in Autumn 1013, Arduino took refuge in one of his castles without fighting, and Heinrich was crowned Emperor at Rome 14 Feb 1014. The emperor invaded Flanders again in 1020, supported by Robert King of France . The necrology of Prüm records the death \"III Id Iul\" of \"Heinricus dux Baioarie imperator\" .

The Annalista Saxo names \"domnam Cunigundam, felicis memorie virginem\" as wife of Heinrich, specifying that she was sister of \"Teoderici Metensi episcope et Heinrich postmodum ducis Bawarici\" . Rodulfus Glaber refers to the wife of Emperor Heinrich II as \"filiam Siefredi Saxonum ducis\" . There is little indication of the date of Kunigunde's marriage apart from Thietmar's references to her which show that they were already married when her husband was elected king . She founded Kaufungen convent in 1017. The Annales Herbipolenses minores record the death in 1038 (maybe a transcription error for 1033 rather than a date error) of \"sancta Kunegundis imperatoris\" and her burial at Bamberg .

The only \"Henrici Regis\" who was \"quondam\" in 1027 was Emperor Heinrich II, King of Germany and King of Italy. No other record has been found of him having any children, either legitimate or illegitimate. In addition, if he was Guglielmo´s father-in-law it is unclear why he would not have been called \"Henrici imperatoris\" in the document, as he had been crowned emperor in 1014, unless the reference was to his kingship of Italy. Unless this information is corroborated by other sources which might emerge, it is suggested that it should be treated with considerable caution. m GUGLIELMO Conte [di Focario], son of GUIDO Conte di Focario & his wife --- (-after 1 Oct 1027).]\n\n2.

GISELA ([985]-Passau 7 May 1065, bur Passau Kloster Niedernburg) . Herimannus names \"Gisela, huius soror [=Heinricus imperator]\" as wife of \"Stephano regi Ungariorum\" . The Annalista Saxo states that \"mater ipsius [Stephanus Ungariorum rex] Gisla\" was sister of \"Heinrici inperatoris Babenbergensis\", when recording her husband's death , but clearly the text misstates \"mater\" for \"uxor\". This marriage was agreed by Gisela's brother Duke Heinrich IV and István's father to confirm the Hungarian/Bavarian alliance . According to the legends of St Stephen, she founded Veszprém Cathedral and the convent of Veszprémvölgy . The Gesta Hungarorum records that \"Kysla regina\" sent \"comitem Sebus\" to blind Vazul, whom her husband wished to appoint as his successor after the death of their son Imre, and have moulten lead poured into his ears . Bak suggests that Queen Gisela was blamed because of anti-German feeling in the Hungarian court . According to another Hungarian chronicle, Queen Gisela took council from \"an evil man named Buda\" concerning her husband's plan to name his nephew Vazúl as his heir and sent Buda's son Egiruth to do the deed . After her husband died, she was robbed of her possessions by her husband's successor and left Hungary, becoming Abbess of Niedernburg. m (996) ISTVÁN of Hungary, son of GÉZA Prince of Hungary & his first wife Sarolta of Transylvania (Esztergom [969/75]-Buda 15 Aug 1038, bur Székesfehérvár).

Vogt of St Maximin at Trier. His brother-in-law Heinrich II King of Germany appointed him in 1004 as HEINRICH V Duke of Bavaria but resumed the title himself in 1009. According to Gade, this was due to a dispute over the archbishopric of Trier to which Duke Heinrich was manoeuvring to appoint his brother Adalbert, Prior of St Paul's, the move being was opposed by King Heinrich who feared that too much power would accrue to the Luxembourg family . Henri was reappointed Duke in 1017, but lost the title after the death of Emperor Heinrich II in 1024.

After the death of his maternal uncle Welf III, he was summoned from Italy by his maternal grandmother to inherit the Welf family properties in Swabia and Bavaria . He was installed in 1070 as WELF I Duke of Bavaria by Heinrich IV King of Germany. Duke Welf supported Rudolf von Rheinfelden, anti-king of Germany, and was deposed as Duke of Bavaria in 1077 by Heinrich IV. \"Heinricus rex\" granted property of \"Welfo dux dum erat dux in pago Passir in comitatu Gerungi et in comitatu Friderici\" to the church of Brixen by charter dated 1078 . \"Dux Gewelfo eiusque uxor Iudita\" donated property to Kloster Weingarten, with the consent of \"filiorum suorum Gwelfonis et Heinrici\", dated 12 Mar 1094 . He sought to reassert his position in northern Italy against Emperor Heinrich IV by arranging, through Pope Urban II, the marriage of his son to the powerful landowner Matilda Ctss of Tuscany. In 1095, Welf IV was reconciled with the emperor, who regranted him the duchy of Bavaria . He undertook an expedition to Italy after the death of his father in 1097 to assert his position in the inheritance over his half-brothers . Albert of Aix records that \"Willelmus comes et princeps Pictaviensium, de sanguine et origine Henrici tertii imperatoris Romanorum\" crossed Hungary peacefully with \"duce Bawariorum Welfone et comitssa Ida de marchia Osterrich\", entered the territory of the Bulgars in which \"duce Bulgarorum Guz\" refused their passage into Adrianople, but that Guillaume captured \"ducem Bulgarorum\" who was forced to allow the pilgrims to continue, undated but in a passage adjacent to text which records events in 1101 .

Her husband repudiated her after the disgrace of her father, whom Heinrich IV King of Germany deprived of the duchy of Bavaria . She married secondly Hermann Graf von Calvelage.

Judith is also listed as the daughter of Count Baudouin V (after Mathilde) in a manuscript whose attribution to Orderic Vitalis is disputed, which also shows her first marriage . The date of her first marriage is confirmed by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle which records that \"earl Godwine\" fled after the Council of 9 Sep 1051 \"with Tostig and his wife who was a kinswoman of Baldwin of Bruges\" . Judith moved to Denmark after her first husband was killed. \"Dux Gewelfo eiusque uxor Iudita\" donated property to Kloster Weingarten, with the consent of \"filiorum suorum Gwelfonis et Heinrici\", dated 12 Mar 1094 .
