        "text": "I am a pianist and a professor at the Jan Kochanowski University in Kielce. For many years, I have served as the director of the Institute of Music. My interests revolve around the piano works of Johann Sebastian Bach and the achievements of composers from the 20th and 21st centuries. I have dedicated my artistic life to discovering, reconstructing, and re-presenting forgotten pieces of Polish music, which due to various wartime and historical upheavals, were destroyed or deliberately concealed.\n\nMy activities include concerts, record recordings, sheet music publications, scientific publications, and organizational work. As an academic teacher, I strive to instill in young people my love and passion for music, art, and literature.\n\nIn 2023, as a Fulbright Senior Award scholar, I had the immense pleasure of spending half a year at the University of Southern California (Los Angeles), where I researched Polish roots in Hollywood (especially the works of Henryk Wars and Bronisław Kaper).\n\nI try to spend my free time running, enjoying good wine, and playing chess."
