        "text": "Musical Imagery fills the pages of the Bible. The Bible bursts with song and music. Two-thirds of the psalms make mention of music explicitly. Throughout the Bible, the angels in heaven are described as praising God in song. David, the great king of Israel, was a musician. Joy is expressed in song. Triumph is expressed in song. Sorrow is expressed in musical terms, as in Job 30: 31: 'My harp is tuned for mourning, my flute to the sound of weepers.' For all that, rabbinical attitudes towards music and music-making from the talmudic period through to modernity were essentially that music was banal and frivolous at best and at worst sinful. Based on a passage in BT Gitin (7a), the rabbinical distaste for music began with an outright ban after the destruction of the Second Temple as a sign of mourning. In tractate Sotah (48a), it was actually hostile: 'Rav said, \"The ear that listens to music should be torn off.\"' However, rabbinical attitudes softened somewhat when it came to weddings. Moses Isserles wrote that for religious purposes, such as at a wedding, all music is permitted, and a generation later the Italian rabbi Leone da Modena clearly believed this applied to festivals as well, based on the verse, 'and on the day of your rejoicing and your appointed seasons' (Num. 10: 10).\n\nNevertheless, Jewish thought on music remained divided. Music was always popular with the masses, while rabbis were quick to excoriate cantors and klezmer musicians for what they viewed as vanity and showmanship. Musicians were not seen as being religiously strict enough, an attitude reflected in the I. L. Peretz short story 'A Musician's Death', in which the wife of the dying klezmer musician scolds [End Page 3] her sons saying 'You play at the balls of the Gentiles, you eat their bread and butter and God knows what else!' When the musician finally prepares to die, he is offered a quorum of ten men, a minyan, so that he may properly confess his sins. The musician refuses the offer. '\"There is no need,\" the sick man protested. \"Why do I need a minyan? I have my own minyan—my band!\"'"
