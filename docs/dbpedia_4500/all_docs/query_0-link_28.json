His 26-year tenure began with the hit title song for San Francisco in 1936 and ended with the writing of his most ambitious score, for Mutiny on the Bounty, in 1962. In between came the writing of music for all manner of films but with a particular talent for deftly comedic, romantic scoring, of which his Oscar-winning Lili, The Glass Slipper, The Swan, and Auntie Mame are conspicuous examples.\n\nBorn in Warsaw in 1902, Kaper discovered an affinity with the piano at the age of seven. It was found that he could play even without instruction. Formal musical education followed and Kaper graduated from the Chopin Music School, having studied theory and composition as well as the piano. He went to Berlin to further his education and took jobs as a cabaret pianist in order to support himself. It was a time of burgeoning theatrical activity in Berlin, and Kaper became more and more a part of it as he discovered his facility for making arrangements and writing songs. With the arrival of sound on film he moved into the arranging of scores for musicals and established a solid reputation. In 1933 Kaper moved to Paris to do similar work for French film musicals. In the summer of 1935 Louis B. Mayer vacationed in Europe and heard the song on the radio everywhere. He traced the composer and invited him to his hotel in Paris. Kaper was thereupon offered an MGM contract and arrived in Los Angeles in early 1936.\n\nFor the first four years he was limited to the duties of a song writer and arranger of musicals, but his insistence on being given the opportunity to write dramatic underscoring resulted in I Take This Woman in 1940. It was followed by more than a hundred scores during the remainder of his years in film composition. Despite the association with romantic film fare, Kaper, again through his own insistence, proved his ability with darkly serious material, such as Gaslight, The Red Badge of Courage, Them!, and Lord Jim. Among his biggest commercial successes, in addition to Lili, were the themes from Green Dolphin Street, Invitation, and the title music for the long-running television series The F.B.I.\n\nA man noted for his wit and charm, Kaper was active in the musical life of Los Angeles as a member of the board of the Philharmonic Orchestra. Although he never performed in public, his ability as a pianist, with music that ranged from his own to the sonatas of Clementi, was appreciated by the guests in his home. When asked if he felt that after writing film music for more than 40 years, everything had been said and done, he replied, \"No. If you're excited by something, you'll come up with new ideas. How many women have you known in your life? Then along comes another and you love her. It's the same with film. All you need are a few little things and off you go again. If I were bothered by the clichés of the past, I couldn't live. Not just music. Life is also full of clichés. Don't fall for them.\"\n\n—Tony Thomas"
