        "text": "Oddly enough, that most American of songs âAll Godâs Chillun Got Rhythmâ was written by three men, none of whom were born in the United States. Lyricist Gus Kahn was born in Germany and came to Chicago as a child. He obviously had an ear for the vernacular and began writing for vaudeville, eventually collaborating on dozens of popular tunes, many of which became jazz standards such as âMakinâ Whoopee,â âLove Me or Leave Me,â âIt Had to be You,â âIâll See You in My Dreams,â and others.\n\nAustrian-born Walter Jurmann and Polish-born Bronislaw Kaper were composers who had teamed up in Paris and enjoyed considerable success before being contracted for MGM by Louis B. Mayer. Jurmann wrote âLove Song of Tahitiâ for the 1935 film Mutiny on the Bounty, the title song for the 1936 film San Francisco (which became the official song of âthe city by the bayâ in 1984), and two songs for Deanna Durbinâs debut in Three Smart Girls. Kaper won an Oscar for the film score of Lili in 1953 after contributing two enduring songs to the jazz repertoire: âOn Green Dolphin Streetâ and âInvitation.â\n\nThere can be no doubt that the songwriting trio was familiar with the Negro spiritual, âAll Godâs Chillun Got Wings,â which promised rewards in heaven for the slaves who labored in the fields and for their children. Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake performed the spiritual as a part of their vaudeville act, and a film clip of their performance was included in a Broadway show in 1923, according to the authors of Spreadinâ Rhythm Around: Black Popular Songwriters, 1880-1930.\n\nâAll Godâs Chillun Got Rhythmâ was introduced by and written specifically for Ivie Anderson who performed it with the Crinoline Choir in the 1937 Marx Brothersâ film A Day at the Races. Anderson also recorded it with Her Boys from Dixie, and Judy Garland recorded it for Decca in 1937. The song charted twice that year: Duke Ellingtonâs version lasted for two weeks, rising to # 14, and the Artie Shaw Orchestra took it to #15 over a three-week period."
