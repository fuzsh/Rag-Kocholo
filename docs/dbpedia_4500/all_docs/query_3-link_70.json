        "text": "La-La Land Records and CBS Studios proudly present STAR TREK: THE ORIGINAL SERIES – THE 1701 COLLECTION VOL. 6, the sixth in a series of limited edition CD releases that showcase original scores from the landmark sci-fi television series STAR TREK (1966-1969). Containing music originally from our long out-of-print 2012 Original Series Box Set, these exciting volumes utilize the same restored master as that acclaimed release, but feature new packaging by Dan Goldwasser, along with brand new, exclusive liner notes by film music writer and Trek historian, Jeff Bond. This groundbreaking, iconic music, from one of television’s most acclaimed and beloved series, is now again available for fans everywhere!\n\nVol. 6 of the 1701 Collection focuses on the Trek TOS music of renowned composers Samuel Matlovsky, Jerry Fielding, Alexander Courage, Fred Steiner, Gerald Fried, George Duning and Wilbur Hatch, with the “Star Trek Theme” by Alexander Courage, and contains original score from the classic episodes I MUDD, THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES, AND THE CHILDREN SHALL LEAD, along with MAIN and END TITLES and much more, including a bounty of Second and Third Season Library Music, Alternate Cues, Outtakes and Source Music. Produced by Lukas Kendall, Neil S. Bulk and Jeff Bond, restored by Chris Malone and mastered by Doug Schwartz, this limited edition 2-CD release of 1701 units, as well as forthcoming volumes of this series, illustrate how the original Trek series scores not only teem with action, adventure and drama, but how they are infused with deep emotion and the greatness of the human spirit.
