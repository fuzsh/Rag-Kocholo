        "text": "Bronislau Kaper was a musical prodigy who studied law and music in his native Poland before moving to Berlin to pursue music. He composed for German films, but as anti-Semitism increased he moved to Paris in 1933. There he was discovered by Louis B. Mayer who signed him to MGM.\n\nFrom 1936 to 1940 he wrote songs for films: âTomorrow Is Another Day,â âCosi Cosa,â and âAll Godâs Chillun Got Rhythmâ (now considered politically incorrect) for the Marx Brothersâ A Day at the Races (1937). By 1940 he was assigned complete scores. During a career that spanned over 30 years in Hollywood he scored an incredible variety of films from Gaslight (1944), a suspense drama, to Them! (1954), a horror film about giant ants, to Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956), a boxing film. With Herbert Stothart he served as music director for the operetta, The Chocolate Soldier (1941), which featured his song, âWhile My Lady Sleepsâ with Gus Khanâs lyrics.\n\nIn 1947 Kaperâs score for Green Dolphin Street produced a jazz classic, âOn Green Dolphin Street.â He won an Oscar for Lili (1953), which contained the song âHi-Lili Hi-Lo,â and was nominated in 1962 for the Mutiny on the Bounty score and its love song, âFollow Meâ with Paul Francis Websterâs lyrics. Mutiny... did win a Golden Globe for best score as did A Life of Her Own (1950). With Webster, Kaper also wrote the haunting âInvitationâ (1952), which would become an oft-recorded jazz standard.\n\nMilestones for Kaper in 1958 include the âOvertureâ for Auntie Mame and the score for The Brothers Karamazov, where his intimate knowledge of Russian ethnic music added to the scoreâs authenticity. But large-scale scores such as Lord Jimâs (1965) were losing favor, so Kaper produced his last one in 1967 for The Way West."
