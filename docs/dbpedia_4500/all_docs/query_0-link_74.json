        "text": "New Outfit\n\nForty years since its foundation, one of the most popular jazz festivals in Poland is evolving into a platform bearing the brand-new name Jazz Juniors International Exchange. The event kicks off with a concert by Paweł Kaczmarczyk with special guest Dorota Miśkiewicz: Vars & Kaper: DeconstructiON. On 3 December, the popular jazz pianist and improviser comes to ICE Kraków to perform decompositions of works by Henryk Wars and Bronisław Kaper – Polish film music composers from the golden era of Hollywood.\n\nBut the event doesn’t entirely dispense with tradition, and it returns with a competition for young ensembles with 32 groups participating this year. The finalists are Jan Kantner Quartet, Organic Noises, Judyta Pisarczyk Ensemble, Quantum Trio, Mario Rafael Trio from Hungary and Giulia Facco 5tet from Italy. The bands will perform between 3 and 5 December during auditions open to the public at ZetPeTe. Winners of the competition will be revealed on 6 December during the finale concert at Radio Kraków.\n\nNew this year is the showcase for seasoned musicians from around the globe. The brand new part of the project has attracted 46 nominations from far-flung countries including Israel, Brazil and the US. The international artistic board qualified eight ensembles for showcase concerts. On 4 and 5 December, ZetPeTe hosts Wójciński/Szmańda Quartet, Kamil Piotrowicz Sextet, Mateusz Pałka Trio, Tomasz Chyła Quintet, Toni Mora Quartet (Belgium), Sun Dew (Germany), LRK Trio (Russia) and Zadeno Trio (Italy)."
