        "text": "Bronislav Kaper (misspelled by the U.S. immigration authorities as Bronislau Kaper) (1902 - 1983) was a Polish-born composer of popular music.\n\nKaper met Walter Jurmann in Berlin in the late 1920s, and the two decided to work as a team, first in Berlin and then in Paris, France. On being offered a seven-year contract with MGM by Louis B. Mayer, Kaper and Jurmann emigrated to the United States, where they continued their work."
