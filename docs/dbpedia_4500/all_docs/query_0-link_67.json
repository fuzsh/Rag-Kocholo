        "text": "A South Korean thriller titled âParasiteâ snapped up four Oscars at this yearâs Academy Awards gala, but Polandâs up-and-coming film director Jan Komasa wasnât surprised or too disappointed. He was happy that his âCorpus Christiâ had made it into the top five of the international Oscar nominees and that it has been sold to 45 different countries where it is drawing raves from audiences and reviewers alike.\n\nInspired by an actual incident, âCorpus Christiâ tells the story of 20-year-old Daniel, released from a youth detention center to which he had been sentenced for second-degree murder. While behind bars, he experienced a spiritual transformation and hoped to enter the priesthood. But his police record was an insurmountable obstacle. Instead, he was sent to work as a carpenter in a small rural village in southeast Poland.\n\nDuring the absence of the local pastor, Daniel was mistakenly taken for a priest and decided to play out that role. Donning liturgical garb, he began ministering to his flock. Not for personal gain but because of a deeply felt religious calling. The energetic ministry of this charismatic young man initially raises eyebrows but ultimately helps heal the rift that has polarized the local community.\n\nIn one post-Oscar interview, Komasa said he had been observing Americaâs presidential campaign and came to the conclusion that âmaybe people donât need a president as much as they need a therapist.â That theme runs through âCorpus Christi, and the rural village can be seen as a symbol of Polandâs polarization in recent years. âEven at the Wigilia supper political controversies now creep into the conversation,â he remarked.\n\nNow 38, Komasa began his climb to prominence in the early 21st century. A screen writer and movie director he has created numerous films from short subjects and documentaries to full-length feature films which have won awards at Europeâs leading festivals. They have included his drama âSuicide Roomâ (2011) depicting alienated youths retreating into the cyber world and contemplating self-annihilation as well as his blockbuster âWarsaw 44â (2014) focusing on the tragedy of the Warsaw Uprising. A common theme of most of Komasaâs works are the often daunting challenges facing the younger generation.\n\nIn recent years, several Polish films have made it onto the Academy Awards international short list including Agnieszka Hollandâs war drama âIn Darknessâ (2011). In 2018, PaweÅ Malinowski's âCold Warâ also landed among the front-running nominees, but only his post-Holocaust drama âIdaâ (2015) won the top prize.\n\nPolandâs world-renowned filmmaker Andrzej Wajda received the Motion Picture Academy's life-achievement award in 2000. The first Pole ever awarded was British-born Leopold Stokowski who conducted the music score to Walt Disneyâs 1940 animated film âFantasia.â In 1953, all of America was humming âHi-Lili Hi-Lo,â a song composed by Polish-born BronisÅaw Kaper for the movie âLili.â"
