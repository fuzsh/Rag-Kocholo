        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Chris Rock has made a deal to develop to direct Another Round, based on the 2020 Thomas Vinterberg-directed black comedy that won the Oscar for Best International Feature Film as well as the BAFTA.\n\nThe film is an Appian Way and Makeready production for Fifth Season. Jennifer Davisson and Leonardo DiCaprio are producing for Appian Way, and Brad Weston and Collin Creighton are producing for Makeready. Stuart Bloomberg wrote a draft and they will now bring in a new writer to work with Rock.\n\nRock has made directing a priority, and adds this to a Universal-based adaptation of King: A Life, the Jonathan Eig book about Martin Luther King Jr., along with an untitled script Rock is writing that has Peter Rice producing.\n\nRock stamped himself as a director with chops with Top Five, which he also wrote and which became the biggest deal at the 2014 Toronto Film Festival where Paramount Pictures bought world rights. Rock also directed Head of State and I Think I Love My Wife. He’s also a four-time Emmy winner and three-time Grammy winner.\n\nScripted by Vinterberg and Tobias Lindholm, Denmark’s Another Round starred Mads Mikkelsen, Thomas Bo Larsen, Magnus Millang and Lars Ranthe playing four high school teachers who conduct an experiment to maintain a constant level of inebriation throughout their workday. Restless and bored, they act on a theory that a certain alcohol level boosts creativity and happiness. Appian Way’s Michael Hampton will oversee the project.\n\nRock is repped by CAA and Untitled."
