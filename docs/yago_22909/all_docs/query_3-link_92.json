        "text": "WILL Smith's fans have insisted the actor was never canceled for slapping Chris Rock as his new Bad Boys movie topped the box office.\n\nBad Boys: Ride or Die marked Will's career comeback after he accosted Chris onstage at the Oscars in 2022.\n\nThe fourth installment in the franchise has claimed the number 1 spot after raking in $56 million domestically and $104.6 million globally in its opening weekend.\n\nThe latest Sony offering earned an A- CinemaScore in North America alongside generally positive reviews.\n\nWill and Martin Lawrence returned as Miami cops Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett in Bad Boys 4.\n\nThe $100 million movie centered around them going on the run after their late police captain was linked to drug cartels, and their attempt to clear his name.\n\nIt is the follow-up to Bad Boys for Life, which opened to $62 million domestically in 2022 and earned $426 million at the global box office before theaters were shut due to the pandemic.\n\nWill's fans flooded social media with praise after the action blockbuster's success.\n\n\"I love how we all collectively agreed that Will Smith was never canceled and we don’t give a f**k about the slap,\" one wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n\"We didn’t cancel him, but we did give him a time out in the corner. I’m happy to see Will back and doing great,\" another added.\n\n\"I'm glad this movie is gonna put him back on track with his career and this proves everyone still loves Will Smith we're human we mess up sometimes,\" a third posted.\n\n\"Proof that everybody still likes Will Smith,\" someone else commented.\n\nWill caused global outrage when he slapped host Chris Rock at the 94th Academy Awards on March 27, 2022.\n\nThe actor hit Chris after the comedian made a joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith's shaved head.\n\nHe then returned to his seat and yelled, \"Keep my wife's name out your f**king mouth!\"\n\nWill appeared to poke fun at the incident in a scene in Bad Boys: Ride or Die where his character was repeatedly slapped by Martin Lawrence's character.\n\nMarcus hit Mike multiple times to get him to snap out of it when he panicked in the middle of an action scene.\n\nVariety's chief film critic Owen Gleiberman said the scene \"punishes\" Will and \"makes cruel fun\" of the incident, allowing him to \"crawl out from the image of it.\"\n\nCAREER COMEBACK\n\nAhead of the movie's release, The U.S. Sun exclusively revealed that Will is hoping the new installment will jumpstart his Hollywood comeback.\n\n\"The slap is still a bit of an elephant in the room and Will is going to tackle it head-on. People love a redemption story and Will has done a lot of work on himself,\" an insider said.\n\nThe source added that Will has a \"huge fan base\" who want him \"back in the action.\"\n\nChris addressed the slap incident at a comedy event in 2022, saying, “Anyone who says ‘words hurt’ has never been punched in the face.\"\n\nHe added that he is “not a victim” and wouldn’t “go to the hospital for a paper cut.\""
