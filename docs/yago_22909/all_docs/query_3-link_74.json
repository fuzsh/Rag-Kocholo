        "text": "Its not easy sustaining a long career in this business. Actors come and go by the hundreds. To survive, you must be good or at least have a good agent. Unlike most comedians who get a shot at stardom on the big screen with a lead role such as Robin Williams, Eddie Murphy, and a few others, Chris Rock had to work hard before he was given a film to carry. Now, fully established as a big star, Chris talks about his role in BAD COMPANY and his luck so far.\n\nWM: Can you talk about your character in the film?\n\nCR: My character Jake Hayes is a ticket scalper, DJ, hustler type who has a twin brother he was separated from at birth. His brother Kevin is a CIA agent. Kevin gets killed and JK has to take his place to finish a mission. And to help him finish the mission, Anthony Hopkins will show him the ropes of becoming a spy.\n\nWM: Can you describe your first meeting with Sir Hopkins? Do you remember?\n\nCR: I think it was a photo shoot. It was like some early press thing and you know. It was how are you, how are you? We bonded; Being in Prague helped a lot because we both were experiencing Prague. So we automatically had something in common. It was like where are you eating, no, where are you eating? Is there a bookstore, oh boy, there are no American bookstores. Oh, I found one, or I found a record store. If we had done the movie in LA we wouldnt have bonded as much. We were going through something together. If we had done the movie, like in LA, we wouldnt have bonded as much.\n\nWM: Did you like Prague?\n\nCR: I liked it. Prague is like New Orleans without the food. Swingin sin city type, voodoo. Its got an aura.\n\nWM: In speaking with Garcelle (Beavais), she said that they were not that many Blacks in Prague so it was a different feeling for her. Did they know who you were and did they find you funny?\n\nCR: They had no idea who I was. But there were Blacks in Prague. It wasnt like being in America in a town with no Blacks. They hadnt seen Blacks. They were like the Blacks they see was like Shaq or something. It was like a curiosity thing. Like, ah, youre one of those Black people that Ive heard so much about. It was kind of cool no one knew me but no one followed me around in a store or anything; hit their car door or anything. It was just oh, a Black guy.\n\nWM: As someone born and raised in NYC, its a special feeling playing a character that saves NY?\n\nCR: Ive been so lucky to work in New York. I did New Jack City in New York, I did Down to Earth in New York, I did Boomerang in NY, I did this movie in NY, I did the Chris Rock Show in New York, I did Saturday Night Live in NY. I have been very fortunate to have worked in NY so much.\n\nWM: Actors and spies, at least undercover spies have something in common dont you think? Youd probably make a great spy.\n\nCR: Naw, cause Id be Black and too many people paying attention to you anyway. You gotta really blend in. I guess Id be a good spy in Africa somewhere. But, being a Black spy is a hard one to pull off.\n\nWM: How do you go about adapting the lines for your character? Did you rewrite a lot of it and did you improvise? What were your favorite lines?\n\nCR: Its weird. The first time you read the script, youre just reading it for the story. The second time you read it. I read it to find out where can I be funny without messing up the movie. The best ad-libbing, I dont know. I guess some of that was ad-libbing and some of the bomb stuff, when I was detonating the bomb or checking out the bomb. The Dr. Dre., Shaq stuff was kinda ad-libbed. But you know the day before what youre doing the next day. So you sit around you jot stuff down. The best ad lib was the one you thought of yesterday. Be prepared.\n\nWM: You went from having a small role in Beverly Hills Cop to costarring with Anthony Hopkins. How does it feel to co-star with one of the most respected actors in the world after over a decade of working?\n\nCR: Ive been fortunate. Im fortunate that I started 18 years ago and they didnt give you a starring movie when I started. Nowadays theres no building up process. It seems like a plan, but a lot of it is just luck and the era Im from. I mean the last five, six years try to pick good projects and try to work with good people. And try not to spend that much money so that I can turn down really bad movies. Thats the key more than anything. To be able to afford my house and stuff like that.\n\nWM: Would you say that this is the biggest role in your career?\n\nCR: Yeah, I guess it would be. I remember when I did Nurse Betty that was big too. The movie didnt turn out to be this blockbuster. But working with Morgan Freeman was incredible too.\n\nWM: Is your next film, Head of State, about the first Black President?\n\nCR: Well, its not the first Black President. I think Tuckers doing the first Black president. Im doing an election movie more than anything. The basic premise is that I play an alderman from D.C. D.C., Maryland area. We havent zeroed it in yet and the Democratic nominee has a heart attack three months before Election Day and the Republican candidate no one wants to run against him because hes an incumbent and hes a war hero and hes Sharon Stones cousin. So they decided to get a patsy to lose this election and theyve chose me as this alderman. So I get to run and comedy ensues.\n\nWM: Have you been spending any time at the White House to research your role?\n\nCR: No, Ive been around Bill Clinton a few times lately. Been in D.C. brushing up on it. Its more the Mel Brooks take on politics. Im not really trying to make the contender here. Im not trying to. If all you guys hated the movie and the people in the theatre loved it, Id be so happy. Making a political movie is hard. Cause people really dont care about politics in a mass way like we think they do.\n\nWM: Do you have any more projects lined up?\n\nCR: Actually there is one more movie. Im producing a movie for HBO. Its gonna go in August. The Marion Berry biopic with Jaime Foxx starring as Marion Berry. Thats drama, thats straight drama. Madagascar is a couple of years away, thats DreamWorks. Ill have 2 movies going in the DC, Baltimore area.\n\nWM: Are you going to be doing any more specials for TV?\n\nCR: Im gonna. Soon as Im done with Head of State. Everybodys saying youre doing movies now and no more TV. Directing a movie, especially with the crew Im working with, its all the same people from the Chris Rock Show. And, by directing it Im really getting back to what I was doing on TV. That was having my hand in every part of it. So, hopefully this movie is like what you say youre missing.\n\nWM: Thanks for speaking to blackfilm.com."
