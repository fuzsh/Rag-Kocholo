        "text": "Highest Rated: 100% Chris Rock: Kill the Messenger (2008)\n\nLowest Rated: 8% Grown Ups 2 (2013)\n\nBirthday: Feb 7, 1965\n\nBirthplace: Andrews, South Carolina, USA\n\nChris Rock first gained attention as a cast member during the early 1990s resurgence of \"Saturday Night Live\" (NBC, 1975- ), though he found more lasting success as a stand-up comic, ranking No. 5 on Comedy Central's list of the \"100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time.\" Rock's edgy, brilliant material often dared to take on the African-American establishment, but his critiques of broader American culture and politics proved to have universal appeal. Rock teamed with HBO to produce a number of Emmy Award-nominated stand-up specials, including \"Bring the Pain\" (1996), and went on to host the similarly Emmy recognized late night talk offering \"The Chris Rock Show\" (HBO, 1997-2000). Rock brought his acclaimed stage style to hosting duties for the Academy Awards and the Video Music Awards, and added to his reputation as a strong writer by co-creating and producing the Golden Globe-nominated sitcom, \"Everybody Hates Chris\" (2005-09). Rock also helmed feature films including the White House comedy \"Head of State\" (2003), the documentary \"Good Hair\" (2009) and the semi-autobiographical romantic comedy \"Top 5\" (2014). In addition, film roles ranging from \"Nurse Betty\" (2000) to family entertainment blockbusters like \"Dr. Dolittle\" (1998), \"Madagascar\" (2005) and \"Grown Ups\" (2010), Grammy-winning comedy albums and a best-selling memoir provided further evidence that Rock was one of the strongest voices in comedy, combining substance and style in ways that appealed to both adults and children alike.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n100% Chris Rock: Tamborine\n\n100% Chris Rock: Kill the Messenger\n\n97% Dolemite Is My Name\n\n86% Chris Rock: Bigger & Blacker\n\n85% Top Five 84% Rustin\n\n83% Nurse Betty\n\n81% New Jack City\n\nPhotos\n\nView All Chris Rock photos\n\nChris Rock\n\nChris Rock Chris Rock Emily Wagner, Albert Delpy, Alexia Landeau, Alexandre Nahon, Chris Rock, Julie Delpy at arrivals for 2 DAYS IN NEW YORK Premiere at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival, Eccles Theatre, Park City, UT January 23, 2012.
