        "text": "American comedian and actor Chris Rock describes directing himself in his latest movie as an hour-and-a-half selfie.\n\nIn a bid to explore his acting range, Rock wrote the critically acclaimed film Top Five, which he visited Australia to promote.\n\nBut this does not signal an end to Rock's stand up, with the 50-year-old announcing his desire to return to the stage.\n\nTop Five is a about a stand up comedian Andre Allen who is trying to make it as a serious actor — something Rock can relate to.\n\n\"Every comedian goes through that thing where they want to be taken serious,\" he told Jane Hutcheon on One Plus One.\n\nBut Allen is not Rock, he is a puffed-up version of Rock and some of his other famous friends.\n\n\"The character Andre Allen is kind of a mix of a lot of guys, there's a little Eddie Murphy in that, a little Chris Tucker in that, there's a little Kevin Hart in that, a little Jamie Fox, you know, it's like a lot of guys.\"\n\nRock's main aim in Top Five was to create a realistic tone to challenge his self-described style of broad-range \"jokey\" acting in other comedy flicks.\n\n\"So I wanted to create a tone that was more aligned with my stand-up tone,\" he said.\n\n\"And I think ... you get the same feeling from watching this movie as you get from when I do stand up.\"\n\nBorn in Georgetown, South Carolina in 1965, Rock relocated to New York soon after and spent time in Brooklyn's notorious Bedford-Stuyvesant neighbourhood.\n\nWhile his mother worked, Rock spent time with his cab-driving grandfather, who he attributes to introducing him to show business through his second job as a preacher.\n\n\"Just cause a preacher does a show every week ... Sometimes he'd pick me up from school, and especially if my mother was working ... my grandfather would work on his sermon all week, not that different to the way I would work on my act,\" Rock said.\n\nNow Rock listens to preachers' shows more than he does comedians'.\n\n\"The preacher's actually better than the stand up because the preacher always stays to theme a little bit better.\n\n\"But it's the same, you're standing in front of an audience and you're moving the same way. You're doing the same exact thing, it's just you want different results.\"\n\nRacism 'made me stronger'\n\nNot surprisingly, Rock is philosophical about life's comedies and tragedies, acknowledging pain's role in his experience of both.\n\nRock encountered racism from an early age, attending a nearly all-white public school, just years after the Civil Rights Act has passed in 1968.\n\n\"People were mean and they called you nigger ... and they spit on you and threw faeces and piss and whatever at you and you know, it is what it is, and nothing I can do about it,\" he said.\n\n\"It made me stronger — I'm not here without it — you can't faze me with meanness because of it.\"\n\nBut discrimination was not contained to the schoolyard, with Rock placed in various police line ups.\n\n\"You're just minding your business and the next thing you know you're like wrapped up,\" he said.\n\n\"Some cops come and tell you and your friends to get in a car and some woman's crying and looking through glass and you're hoping not to get picked.\"\n\nRock's appetite for comedy drove him into New York's east side clubs, where he was discovered by Eddie Murphy at the Comic Strip.\n\nMurphy was a key influence on Rock, who followed in his idol's footsteps and joined the cast of Saturday Night Live and even featured in Beverly Hills Cop II.\n\n\"Everybody needs to see a version of themselves do something, it's just good, it makes you feel like you can do it,\" Rock said.\n\n\"And Eddie Murphy was the first version of myself that I saw succeeding at comedy.\n\n\"There's no Justin Bieber of comedy, it's just not this thing that you master at a young age.\"\n\nLike Murphy, Rock is no stranger to Hollywood, with one of his best-known roles an animated zebra Marty from the blockbuster Madagascar films.\n\nIn 1997, Rock began hosting his Emmy award-winning television show on the HBO, The Chris Rock Show, and also appeared in Beverly Hills Ninja and Lethal Weapon 4 around the same time.\n\nHe also starred in Grown Ups and its sequel, Bad Company, co-starring Anthony Hopkins, and often appears in cameos on the television show Louie of fellow comedian Louis CK.\n\nFather's death drives Rock\n\nRock's father died in 1988 and never saw the heights of his son's fame, something Rock thinks about every day.\n\n\"Sometimes tragedy can be the best thing. Would I feel the need to have the drive I do if he was alive? Cause, you know, he was my safety blanket,\" said Rock.\n\n\"For a guy that has been doing this a long time I am not really resting. And part of that is just trying to recreate the security I had as a child.\n\n\"And that's never going to happen, but I can do it for my kids ... It is what it is.\"\n\nRock's restless search is the world's gain, with his incredible drive spurring creative projects of many dimensions.\n\n\"Good movie or a good stand up is different every time you watch it ... I hope I've done that with Top Five.\"\n\nBut stand-up fans may not have to wait long to see this veteran comedian back in the spotlight, with one of Rock's top five future goals to get back on stage and do good stand up."
