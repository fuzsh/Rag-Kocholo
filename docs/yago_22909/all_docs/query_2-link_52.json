        "text": "Christopher Julius Rock (born February 7, 1965) is an American comedian, actor, screenwriter, producer and director.\n\nQuotes\n\n[edit]\n\nYou can't beat white people, you can only knock them out.\n\nChris Rock on Real Time with Bill Maher, September 26, 2008\n\nYou can't be happy that fire cooks your food and be mad it burns your fingertips.\n\nIn regards to fame[1]\n\nI hope that Live Earth ends global warming the same way the Live Aid ended world poverty.\n\nIn an interview at Live Earth in London [citation needed]\n\nComedy is the blues for people who can't sing. [citation needed]\n\nCharlie Brown is the one person I identify with. C.B. is such a loser. He wasn't even the star of his own Halloween special. [citation needed]\n\nOur next presenter is the first woman to ever breast-feed an Apple – Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\nAt the Academy Awards as host [citation needed]\n\nThe only acting you ever see at the Oscars is when people act like they're not mad they lost. Nicole Kidman was smiling so wide, she should have won an Emmy at the Oscars for her great performance. I was like, \"If you'd done that in the movie, you'd have won an Oscar, girl.\"\n\nAt the Academy Awards as host [citation needed]\n\nHave you been watching American Idol? They have Simon Cowell and Paula Abdul judging the singing. Paula Abdul?! Getting Paula Abdul to judge a singing contest is like getting Christopher Reeve to judge a dance contest! [citation needed]\n\nWhen I heard they were trying and get rid of the word \"nigga\", I told my accountant to buy 800 shares of \"coon\".[citation needed]\n\nYou won't be able to take your eyes off the next four presenters: Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz.\n\nAt the Academy Awards as host [citation needed]\n\nGeorge Bush hates midgets.\n\nAt a concert supporting Katrina Relief, in reference to Kanye West's comment [citation needed]\n\nYo, what's up! This is Chris Rock, and I'm with my man Lil Jon, and we stay in the club! We live in the club! We die in the club! We get our car washed in the club! We go to school in the club! We go to the cleaners in the club! We do everything in the motherfucking club! We go to church in the club! We never leave the motherfucking club! We pay our taxes in the club! We go to library in the club!\n\nIn Lil Jon's CD Crunk Juice: Track 15\n\nBlack Santa Claus caused more tears than the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.\n\nFrom Everybody Hates Chris second season episode, \"Everybody Hates Chris\"\n\nThey don't want you to vote. If they did, we wouldn't vote on a Tuesday. In November. You ever throw a party on a Tuesday? No. Because nobody would come.\n\n\"The Six Best Jokes From Wednesday Night's Chris Rock Show at MSG\". 2008-05-02 .\n\nHappy white peoples independence day the slaves weren't free but I'm sure they enjoyed fireworks\n\nTwitter, 4 July 2012 , quoted in \"Chris Rock Lights Up Controversy With Fourth of July Tweet\". ABC News. 2012-07-06.\n\n[Interviewer asks: \"How do you feel like things have changed over the past couple decades?\"]\n\nWhite people have gotten less crazy. That's all. [...]\n\nYou can say “there's progress” and all of this. But when you say there's progress, but you're acting like what happened before wasn't crazy.\n\n“Oh, segregation, we've made a lot of progress and there's no more segregation”?— Segregation's retarded. It's crazy to think you're better than somebody, and they can't eat with you and segr— that's crazy! That's insane behavior! Just to think that, on any level— that's kind of insane!\n\nSo, you can say “black people have made progress”, but to say “black people have made progress” would mean we deserved to be segregated. The reality is: white people got less crazy.\n\nMy father didn't suddenly deserve to eat with people because he earned it. The people who were denying him his rights got less crazy. And that's what, progressively, has happened throughout the years. People are now getting less crazy about gay people. People are crazy.\n\nin an interview on CBC Radio One \"Q\", host Jian Ghomeshi (Youtube link, video named \"Chris Rock \"White People Have Gotten Less Crazy\"), accessed 2013-09-11\n\nYou would think that cops would occasionally shoot a white kid, just to make it look good. You'd think every couple of months they'd look at their dead nigga calendar and go, \"Oh my God, we're up to 16. We gotta shoot a white kid quick.\"\n\n\"Uh, which one?\"\n\n\"The first one you see singing Cardi B.\"\n\nThat's right. I mean, honestly, I wanna live in a world with real equality. I want to live in a world where an equal amount of white kids are shot every month. An equal world. I want to see white mothers on TV crying. Standing next to Al Sharpton. Talking about, \"We need justice for Chad. We need justice for Chad. He was just coming home from racquetball practice.\"\n\nChris Rock: Tamborine (2018), NetFlix, @1:31-2:40\n\nHere's the thing. I know it's hard being a cop. I know it's hard. I know that shit's dangerous. I know it is, OK? But some jobs can't have bad apples. OK? Some jobs, everybody gotta be good. Like— pilots. You know? American Airlines can't be like, \"You know, most of our pilots like to land. We just got a few bad apples, that like to crash into mountains. Please bear with us.\"\n\nChris Rock: Tamborine (2018), NetFlix\n\nJada, I love you. G.I. Jane 2, can't wait to see it, all right?\n\nJoking about Will Smith's wife Jada Pinkett Smith at the 94th Academy Awards (27 March 2022).\n\nOh, wow! Wow! Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me. [...] That was a... greatest night in the history of television, okay.\n\nAfter being hit by Will Smith during their altercation at the 94th Academy Awards (27 March 2022).\n\nBring the Pain (HBO, 1996)\n\n[edit]\n\nDo you know what the good side of crack is? If you're up at the right hour, you can get a VCR for $1.50. You can furnish your whole house for $10.95.\n\nA black man failing black history... ain't that some sad shit..... cuz you know, fat people don't fail cooking!\n\nPeople are starving all over the world, what do you mean, \"red meat will kill you\"? Don't eat no red meat? No, don't eat no green meat. If you lucky enough to get your hands on a steak, bite the shit out of it!\n\nWe got so much food in America we're allergic to food. Allergic to food! Hungry people ain't allergic to shit. You think anyone in Rwanda's got a fucking lactose intolerance?!\n\nThat shit wasn't about race … that shit was about fame. If O.J. wasn't famous, he'd be in jail right now. If O.J. drove a bus, he wouldn't even be O.J. He'd be Orenthal the Bus Driving Murderer.\n\nSo you gotta look at OJ's situation. He's paying $25,000 a month in alimony, got another man driving around in his car and fucking his wife in a house he's still paying the mortgage on. Now I'm not saying he should have killed her... but I understand.\n\nThere's a lot of racism going on. Who's more racist, black people or white people? Black people! You know why? Because we hate black people too! Everything white people don't like about black people, black people really don't like about black people. There's some shit going on with black people right now. It's like a civil war going on with black people. And there's two sides, there's black people and there's niggas. The niggas have got to go. Everytime a black person wanna have a good time, ignorant-ass niggas fuck it up. You can't have shit when you got niggas around, you can't have shit. You can't have no big screen TV! You can have it, but you better move it in at 3 in the morning. Paint it white, hope niggas think it's a bassinet. Can't have shit in your house! Why?! Because niggas will break into your house. Niggas will live next door to you break into your house, come over the next day and go, \"I heard you got robbed.\" Nigga, you know you robbed me. You didn't see shit 'cause you was doing shit! You can't go see a movie opening day, you know why? 'Cause niggas is shooting at the screen! What kind of ignorant shit is that? \"This movie's so good I gotta bust a cap in here!\" You know the worst thing about niggas? Niggas always want credit for some shit they supposed to do. A nigga will brag about some shit a normal man just does. A nigga will say some shit like, \"I take care of my kids.\" You're supposed to, you dumb motherfucker! What kind of ignorant shit is that? \"I ain't never been to jail!\" What do you want, a cookie?! You're not supposed to go to jail, you low-expectation-having motherfucker!\n\nCommunity college is like a disco with books: \"Here's ten dollars; let me get my learn on!\"\n\nEvery man has to settle down eventually. You know why you gotta settle down eventually? Because you don't want to be the old guy in the club. You know what I'm talking about. Every club you go into, there's always some old guy. He ain't really old, just a little too old to be in the club.\n\nI hate niggas! I hate em! I wish they'd let me join the Ku Klux Klan! Shit, I'd be doing a drive-by from here to Brooklyn!\n\nYou know what they say, \"There's no reason to ever hit a woman.\" Shit! There's a reason to hit everybody. You just don't do it. Shit, there's a reason to kick an old man down a flight of stairs. You just don't do it. Ain't nobody above an ass-whooping.\n\nYou know what GED stands for? Good Enough Diploma.\n\nRoll with the New (Album, 1997)\n\n[edit]\n\nYo, man. R&B sucks. I mean it's a couple of people that float, but, look, for the most part, the genre sucks. Just a bunch of people singing over rap beats. You don't like a rap record? Sing over it! Everybody talking them label. \"Label this, label that!\" Hey, Smokey Robinson wasn't singing about Motown! Look, the Isley Brothers wasn't going \"Teaneck in the motherfuckin' house\". The Jacksons were not singing about Epic because nobody gave a fuck!\n\nHey, this is a joke that I wrote a long time ago. I actually, I really really, wrote this joke. [Following in reverse] So I'm walking down the street, right? And I saw this prostitute, right? And I said, 'How much?' She said, 'For $300, I'll do anything you want.' I said, 'Bitch, paint my house!'\n\nBigger and Blacker (Album Version, 1999)\n\n[edit]\n\nYo, my first choice for the producer of this album was not Prince Paul. It was Roger Troutman and the group Zapp. Let's see how that would have sounded. (The following run through a Talk box): A black man boy said to a Cadillac dealer. And he's looking at some Cadillacs. And the dealer of Zohan says \"are you thinking of buying a Cadillac?\" And, he says, \"No, I'm buying a Cadillac. I'm thinking of pussy... yeah!\"\n\nSo, it's last Wednesday, right? I'm chilling' in my house in a pair of and getting ready to watch the game. You know what she had the nerve to say? Exactly! I thought the woman was crazy. But, then, you know what else she wanted me to do? So, I'm in my car, right? \"Uh, Chris. I'm gonna tell you something.\" Nigga, what? You're wanted in 18 states and 2 territories! Nigga, what did you do? With a seal? How the hell you gonna do something like that with a seal? You know, that don't sound too bad. I'll try it with my woman. Like that? Get outta here! With oil? So, I'm dead! Just chilling' in Heaven! With my man Chris Farley, Phil Hartman, Biggie, Tupac, Vanilla, my Bu2u, Sam Kinison and there's God. And I'm like, \"God, you know everything. I can ask you one question. Who won the game?\"\n\nThe Trenchcoat Mafia. \"Nobody will play with us, we have no friends, we're the Trenchcoat Mafia.\" Hell, I saw the yearbook picture, it was six of 'em! I ain't have six friends in high school. I don't got six friends now! Shit, that's 3-on-3 with a half-court!\n\nEverybody want to know what the kids was listening to, what kind of music they was listening to, or what kind of movies they was watching. Who gives a fuck what they was watching? Whatever happened to CRAZY?\n\nYou don't need no gun control. You know what you need? We need some bullet control. We need to control the bullets! That's right. I think all bullets should cost $5,000. You know why? Because if a bullet costs $5,000, there would be more innocent bystanders. Every time somebody gets shot, people would be like, \"Damn, he must've did something. Shit, they put $50,000 worth of bullets in his ass!\" And people would think before they killed somebody if a bullet cost $5,000. \"Man, I would blow your fucking head off ... if I could afford it! I'm gonna get me another job, I'm gonna start saving some money, and you're a dead man! You better hope I can't get no bullets on layaway!\"\n\nSee, even if you get shot by a stray bullet, you won't have to go to no doctor to get it out, whoever shot you will take that bullet back! \"I believe you got my property!\"\n\nNever Scared (HBO, 2004)\n\n[edit]\n\nI mean, they don't grade fathers. But if your daughter's a stripper, you fucked up.\n\nMy favorite song right now is impossible to defend. It's impossible. We should all be ashamed of ourselves for liking this fucking song. Lil Jon. You know that shit: \"To the window! To the wall! [crowd sings along] 'Till the sweat drip from my balls! Skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet!\" You go to clubs, you see girls dance to that shit. \"Till the sweat drip from my balls! Till the sweat drip from my balls! From my balls! From my balls! My balls! Skeet, Skeet Skeet!\" I feel sorry for the guys that gotta pick a wife out of this bunch. It's like, \"Daddy, where'd you meet Mommy?\" \"Oh, she was singing about balls at a club. Skeet, skeet, skeet!\"\n\n\"Daddy, can we talk?\" \"Hey, I'm watching the game!\" \"I'll show you! I'll dance naked to Mötley Crue records! I'm gonna change my name to Cina Buns and I'm gonna wear clear heels!\" When did clear heels become the new whore uniform? When did that happen? Was there a big ho convention, and all the hoes got together and said, \"We need something new! Something that just says nasty\" And one girl said, \"I got it! Clear heels!\" \"Ooh, girl, you disgusting!\"\n\nWomen don't care, man. If the beat's all right, she will dance all night! I've seen girls on the floor dancing to the nastiest shit ever made. It's like, \"Smack her with a dick, smack her with a dick! … I put a dick in the ear, a dick in the ear! … Fuck her in the eye, fuck her in the eye! … Blind the bitch, blind the bitch, blind the bitch, blind the bitch with cum!\"\n\nIf you mention to a woman that the song is disgusting and misogynistic, they all give you the same answer: \"He ain't talking 'bout me!\" Smack her with a dick, smack her with a dick … He said your name! \"No, he didn't!\" Smack her with a dick, smack her with a dick …\n\nYou know those guys that go to the strip club at the daytime? If you're at a strip club and the sun is out, you got some problems!\n\nYou know those guys that eat at the strip club? Eat the buffet? How the fuck could you eat in a nasty-ass strip club? What? Are you THAT hungry? Motherfucker, go to Mickey D's or some shit! Not even Rwandan refugees eat that shit! At a damn strip club! Titties and tater tots don't mix!\n\nYou know the stripper myth? There's a stripper myth that's being perpetuated throughout society. The myth is, I'm strippin' to pay my tuition. No you're not! There's no strippers in college! There's no clear heels in biology! Shit, man, I didn't know they had a college that only took one-dollar bills. And if they got so many strippers at college, how come I never got a smart lap dance? I never got a girl that sat on my lap and said, If I was you, I would diversify my portfolio. You know, ever since the end of the Cold War, I find NATO obsolete!.\n\nThe government hates rap. That's why they don't arrest anybody that kills rappers! Only the good ones are dead, man! Only the good ones: Biggie dead, Tupac dead, Vanilla Ice still alive! They don't fill out a police report. They don't even have a chalk line when it's a dead rapper, they just take a piss around the body.\n\nHey, man don't let all this celebrity garbage fool you. It's all just a trick to get your mind...off...the...war. I think Bush sent that girl to Kobe's room. Bush sent that girl to Kobe's room, Bush sent that little boy to Michael Jackson's house. Bush killed Laci Peterson. Bush was fucking Paris Hilton in that video. All to get your mind off the war. Bush lied to me, they all lied to me: \"We gotta go to Iraq because they're the most dangerous country on Earth. They're the most dangerous regime in the world.\" If they're so dangerous, how come it only took two weeks to take over the whole fucking country? Shit, man, you couldn't take over Baltimore in two weeks.\n\nWhite man makes guns. Big deal, nobody gives a fuck, kids shoot each other at school, nobody gives a fuck. White man makes guns? No problem. Black rapper says \"guns\"? Congressional hearing. \"Oh, my God, that nigga said gun, and he rhymed it with fun\"!\n\nAre we so desperate for entertainment that we will fall for a trickless magician?? Where the fuck's the trick? Saw a woman in half. Pull a rabbit out of a hat. Do something! What tricks does this guy have? \"I'm in a box...and I ain't gonna eat\". \"I'm in a box...and I ain't gonna eat\"!! That ain't no trick! That's called living in the projects!\n\nEd Bradley looked at Michael Jackson like he wanted to say, \"Nigga, is you crazy?\" Like he wanted to take the the 60 Minutes clock and push the shit forward to say, \"Nigga, what the fuck is wrong with you?\" \"I thought you said it was 60 minutes …\" \"It's 10 minutes, get outta here! You nutty nigga, what the fuck is wrong with you?\"\n\nOn Michael Jackson appearing on 60 Minutes\n\nBlack people dominate every physical activity in the United States of America. We're only 10% of the population, we're 90% of the Final Four. Okay? We fucking dominate all this shit! Okay? Basketball, baseball, football, boxing, track- even golf and tennis! And as soon they make a heated hockey rink, we're gonna take that shit, too. Motherfuck Wayne Gretzky. Wait 'till you see LeBron on some skates. You ain't seen shit yet! He just gonna have one skate, chilling. \"What's up?\" He won't even have a stick, he'll just smack the puck in with his dick. Pow! \"Slapshot, bee-otch!\"\n\nThat tiger ain't go crazy; that tiger went tiger! You know when he was really crazy? When he was riding around on a unicycle with a Hitler helmet on! \"Oh, shit! I'm a crazy tiger!\"\n\nA black C student can't do shit with his life. A black C student can't be a manager at Burger King. Meanwhile, a white C student just happens to be the President of the United States.\n\nRemember when we was young, everybody used to have these arguments about who's better, Michael Jackson or Prince? Prince won!\n\nR. Kelly's got a lot of balls. Talking about \"it ain't me.\" Got a damn sex tape out; \"it ain't me.\" Motherfucker, we know what you look like. That's you, okay? There's a damn Soul Train award right next to the bed.\n\nWhat is on Kobe's mind? Going to Colorado, around all these white people, and not bringing Johnnie Cochran? Well then they say, \"well if you hire Johnnie Cochran, you're going to look guilty.\" Yeah, but you going home! You want to look innocent in jail? I'd rather look guilty at the mall.\n\nIt's hard to defend \"I've got hoes in different area codes\". It's hard to defend \"move, bitch, get out the way!\" It's hard to break it down intellectually … \"Well, as you can see, there's a bitch in his way, that he needs to move. Thus the term, \"move, bitch, get out the way\". You need to open your eyes so you can get the bitches out of your way!\"\n\nYou know the only thing you can do to stop your man from cheating? The only thing you can do … is be there. Where? There! Wherever he's thinking about fucking, that's it. Just be right there. And even then he still might lose your ass. He's like, \"Honey, look! A Sale! Let me go fuck this bitch right now!\"\n\nIf you wanna get away with murder, all you gotta do is shoot somebody in the head and put a demo tape in their pocket! \"This is a rap killing. Let's go home!\"\n\nEverybody's so busy wanting to be down with the gang. \"I'm conservative\", \"I'm liberal\", \"I'm conservative\". Bullshit! Be a fucking person! Lis-ten! Let it swirl around your head. Then form your opinion. No normal, decent person is one thing, okay? I've got some shit I'm conservative about, I've got some shit I'm liberal about. Crime, I'm conservative. Prostitution, I'm liberal!\n\nShaq is rich. The white man who signs his check … is wealthy. \"Ah, here you go, Shaq. Go buy yourself a bouncing car. Bling, bling!\"\n\nYou know the beautiful thing about the gay marriage issue? It's the absolute only issue that the President will answer. The President don't give a fuck. He will give you a straight answer on gay marriage. \"Uh, Mr. President, what about the war? When's it gonna end?\" \"Well, you never know. We're talking to people, and we're looking for stuff, and we might find it, we might not, and it's out there, we're gonna get it, you never know. How's it going? Yeah!\" \"Uh, Mr. President, what about the economy, when's it gonna pick up?\" \"Well, you never know, we're talking to people, and economic indicators indicate that indications are coming to the indicator. You know what I'm saying? All right!\" \"Uh, Mr. President, what about gay marriage?\" \"Fuck them faggots!\"\n\nYou can be married and bored, or single and lonely. Ain't no happiness nowhere.\n\nIf you haven't contemplated murder, you ain't been in love. If you haven't seriously thought about killing a motherfucker, you ain't been in love. If you haven't had a can of rat poison in your hand and looked at it for forty-five minutes straight, you ain't been in love. If you haven't bought a shovel and a bag and a rug to roll their ass up in, you ain't been in love. If you haven't practiced your alibi in front of the mirror, you ain't been in love. And the only thing that's stopped you from killing this motherfucker was a episode of CSI: \"Oh man, they thorough. I better make up. They might catch my ass.\"\n\nSee... Relationships are hard, man. For order, for any relationship to work, both people have to be on the same page, both people have to have the same focus, and we all know what that page is. We all know what that focus is. In order for the relationship to work both people have to have the same focus, and what's that focus? That focus is all about HER! It's all about her!\n\nFellas, when you wake up in the morning, you should look yourself in the mirror and say, \"FUCK YOU! Fuck your hopes, fuck your dreams, fuck your plans … fuck everything you thought this life was going to bring to you. Now let's go out there and try to make this bitch happy.\"\n\nWomen hate women. You get any two girlfriends in this room, been girlfriends for twenty five years, you put a man in between them … \"fuck that bitch,\" \"fuck that bitch.\" Guys are not like that. Guys actually think that there are other fish in the sea, and if a guy introduces his boy to his new girlfriend, and when they walk away, his boy goes, \"Oh man, she's nice, I gotta get me a girl like that.\" If a woman introduces her new man to her girlfriend, and they walk away, her girlfriend goes, \"I gotta get him, and I will slit that bitch's throat to do it.\" Every girl in here got a girlfriend they don't trust around their man.\n\nBut here's what they don't tell you. You can never make a woman happy, it's impossible. I've never met a happy woman in my life. They're always complaining about something. You can fuck a woman with a diamond dick and make her come ten times, and she'll still complain. \"Why did you make me come so hard? This diamond dick is cloudy, why didn't you go to Tiffany's? You're so fucking cheap.\"\n\n\"What's in the tea?\" \"Water, bitch!\"\n\nWhenever I go out with other married couples, I like to bring along a single crackhead. Just to spice things up.\n\nEven if you meet the perfect person, it ain't gonna be at the perfect time. You're married, they're single. That's right. You're Jewish, they're Palestinian. You're a Mexican, they're a raccoon. You're a black woman, he's a black man.\n\nGod will send you a double date with the perfect couple. Have you ever made the mistake of going on a double date with the perfect couple? You're in the middle of your bullshit relationship and you actually sit down with two people that are actually in love. You can't even eat your food cause you can't believe what the fuck you are witnessing. You got a fork in your hand like, \"Oh shit! He's really listening to what she's got to say! Wow! They really like being around each other! Man, we can't hang with them no more, they gonna break us up. Can't let these happy motherfuckers fuck up my life!\"\n\nSo if you're black or brown, you can make money in America, you can get rich in America … but whatever you decide to do, it better be positive, 'cause if one person is harmed, you will be destroyed. You see Oprah, she just be giving away money. She's trying keep the Feds off her back.\n\nWe can't have gay marriage 'cause marriage is sacred, it happens in the church. Marriage is sacred, it's sacred. No, it's not, not in America, not in a country that watches Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire? and The Bachelor and The Bachelorette and Who Wants to Marry a Midget. Get the fuck outta here. Shit, Michael Jackson got married, how fucking sacred is that shit?\n\nWhite man makes alcohol. Tastes great, I love it, you love it, we all love it. Kills motherfuckers every single day. Okay? Some of y'all ain't even make it home tonight 'cause of alcohol. You'll be like, \"Oh man, that Chris Rock sure is funny, oh! Shit!\" But it's all right 'cause it's all white. White man makes Cigarettes, the most dangerous product known to man. Cigarettes are so fucking dangerous it kills motherfuckers that don't smoke, okay? That's how fucking dangerous cigarettes are, okay? Yes, first hand smoke, second hand smoke. People talking out of their necks into a machine like, \"Hey, what's up, man, I love cigarettes.\" But it's all right 'cause it's all white. Could you imagine if the Philip Morris family was a bunch of jheri-curled niggas from Mississippi? Do you know how illegal a pack of cigarettes would be? You would get fifty years just for a carton of Newports. Shit. But it's all right, 'cause it's all white.\n\nSo think about the poor slave who could read, but was scared to teach their kids to read for fear they would be killing their kids. Think about the poor slave that rode to town every week. Think about the poor slave who rode the buggy to town every week. Riding the buggy … riding the buggy, and he could read, and is riding the buggy and he's riding the buggy. And up ahead he sees a busy intersection, and is riding the buggy and he's riding the buggy. Then he sees a STOP sign … Now he's in a big dilemma. \"If I go through this intersection, I'm a have a accident. If I stop, these crackers will kill me.\" And he's riding the buggy, and in the last minute he says \"fuck it\", goes through the intersection, has a big ol' accident. Almost kills somebody. Then the police come: \"Nigga, what is wrong with you? Nigga, what the fuck is wrong with you? You could have killed somebody, nigga. Didn't see that stop sign?\" \"Oh, I don't know what you talking about, sir.\" \"You didn't see that stop sign, that stop sign back there?\" \"Oh, you mean that octagon thing.\" \"Nigga, who taught you octagon?\"\n\nIt's beautiful that abortion is legal in America. I love going to abortion rallies to pick up women, 'cause you know they're fucking. You ain't gonna find a bunch of virgins at the abortion rally. You might even see some clear heels!\n\nOh the abortion issue, it's a woman's issue. When a woman get pregnant, she don't want to hear shit from the man. Fuck you, motherfuck you, I don't need you. Unless she decides to have the baby and she's like, \"Where my check?\"\n\nWhen a woman get pregnant, it's an issue between her and her girlfriends. When a woman get pregnant, her and her girlfriends form an abortion tribunal, and they vote on the child like it was Survivor. Then the first girlfriend throws in her two cents: \"Child, you should have that baby, that man got some good hair, it's wavy, it's wavy.\" Then second girlfriend throws in her two cents: \"Girl, why are we even talking about this? Ain't we supposed to go to Cancun next weekend? Get rid of that baby.\" And that's how life is decided in America.\n\nThe number one reason people hate America: the number one reason is because of our religion. Americans worship money, we worship money. Separate God from school, separate God from work, separate God from government, but on your money it says in God we trust. All my life I've been looking for God, and He's right in my pocket. Americans worship money, and we all go to the same church, the church of ATM. Everywhere you look there's a new branch popping up … remind you about how much money you got and how much money you don't got. And if you got less than twenty dollars, the machine won't even talk to you. The machine is like, \"You better go see a teller.\" You ever go to a teller and try to take out eight dollars and fifty cents? Oh, it's disgusting … oh man, you gotta wait on that long ass line, people doing real transactions in front of you, you get on to the fucking front, you fill out your form, eight fifty. The fucking teller looks at it, she look at you, she looks at the check, she don't even take the money out of the drawer, she take it out of her pocket, \"Here you go, get outta here.\" And here's something, man. Drugs are illegal, but ATM machines are open twenty-four hours a day. Twenty-four hours a day. For who? Who the fuck is it open for? Have you ever taken out three hundred dollars at four o'clock in the morning for something positive? Shit, when you press that machine at four o'clock in the morning, I think a psychiatrist should pop up on the screen and go, \"Come on, man, save your money, man. Don't buy drugs, buy some rims. They spinning, nigga, they spinning, they spinning, nigga, they spinning.\" Americans worship money. Shit, you know why banks are closed on Sunday? 'Cause if they wasn't, church would be empty.\n\nIs it just me, or is he the greasiest nigga you ever seen in your life? Every time Jermaine comes on, I gotta wipe the grease off the screen! Can't see shit! Jermaine must have been on. Even the police can't catch his ass, 'cause every time they try, he just slips out! They be like, \"Somebody throw some sand on that nigga! Please!\"\n\nShit, every woman in here got a girlfriend they don't trust around their man. A good girlfriend too, it's like, \"Yeah, I'll go shopping with her, but I ain't gonna leave that bitch alone with my man for five minutes, no.\" I remember one time, I was at a restaurant with me, my wife, and her girlfriend. And my wife gets up and goes, \"Honey, I'm going to the bathroom.\" And I'm like, \"All right, honey, I'll see you when you get back.\" And she goes, \"No, you coming with me!\" She made me come with her to the bathroom! And she did the right thing, 'cause I'd have fucked the girl; I'da fucked her. I'd have fucked her on a damn quesadilla, I didn't give a fuck.\n\nOprah is rich, Bill Gates is wealthy. If Bill Gates woke up tomorrow with Oprah's money, he'd jump out a fuckin' window and slit his throat on the way down saying, \"I can't even put gas in my plane!\"\n\nNever Scared (Album Version, 2005)\n\n[edit]\n\n[In deep voice] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to WLOW, Low Radio. Now a lot of rappers out there would like to tell the girls to get low, but tonight we're gonna tell you to get lower. That's right! In the ground, under the ground! Get in the mud, bitch! Dig to China, hoe! I don't even know why the fuck you are standing! It's time for you to get lower! Now some of you bitches are still standing, and I don't understand that, 'cuz I want y'all to get low! I'm talking REAL low! I want you so low that you can change an ant's transmission! I want you so low that Aquaman says \"Bitch, what the fuck are you doing under the ocean!?\"\n\nHey, man, fuck y'all! I ain't telling you motherfuckers shit! You motherfuckers can suck my dick! I don't know what the fuck you talking about! Let me get the fuck out of this motherfucker, 'cuz I got shit to do, bitch!\n\nI don't give a fuck! So, what!? Motherfuck the tiger! I'd be shot in the tooth, motherfucker! I don't give a fuck about your bee-otches!\n\nWho'd... you think I'd give a fuck!? I don't give a fuck about no motherfucking chainsaw! I got two black wives, motherfucker! Fuck y'all!\n\nYou mean to tell me that Jamaicans invented sugar, reggae and the best drug on Earth and the white man makes all the money!?\n\nYou mean to tell me that Hawaiians came up with pineapples, resorts, hula hoops, Magnum P.I. and the best damn punch in the world and they don't get no money from it!?\n\nYou mean to tell me that for the last sixty years, the white man's been traveling to outer space, murdering Martians, telling us there's no life up there, building casinos and resorts while he fucks some of the finest bitches in the galaxy, and niggas just want rims!?\n\nKill the Messenger (2008)\n\n[edit]\n\nQuotes from Kill the Messenger:\n\nGeorge Bush has fucked up so bad, he made it hard for a white man to run for president! People are like \"give me a black man, a white woman, a giraffe, a zebra...anything but another white man! That last one fucked up my roof!\"\n\n[on John McCain] I don't need a president with a bucket list!\n\n[on John McCain being too old] When you die at 72, no matter what you die of, it's natural causes. Even if you get hit by a truck, it's natural causes. 'Cause if you was younger, you'd have got out the way!\n\n[on John McCain being in a POW camp] I don't wanna vote for nobody who got captured, I wanna vote for the motherfucker that got away!\n\n[in South Africa] Barack Obama! A black man! With a black name! I know that ain't that black here, but in America that's about as black as a name could get. Barack Obama! That's right next to Dikembe Mutombo. That's right. Barack, man, he don't let his blackness sneak up on you. Y'know, if his name was Bob Jones or something, it might take you two or three weeks to realize he black. But as soon as you hear \"Barack Obama\"...you expect to see a brother with a spear! Just standin' on top of a dead lion! Barack Obama! You expect to see the bass player from the Commodores come out! [sings and mimes playing bass] \"Too hot ta trot, now, baby, too hot ta trot, bay-by!\" I'm not talkin' about Lionel Richie, I'm talkin' about them shiny niggas behind him!\n\n[about Obama] We're not just voting for him 'cause he's black, we're voting for him 'cause he's black and qualified. That's why we're voting for the motherfucker. Yeah. That's why we behind him. It's not like we're voting for Flavor Flav. \"Yeeeeah, boooooy! Flavor Flaaaav!\" Hey, I love Flavor. Lovin' him for 20 years. I love the \"Flavor of Love\" show; I think it's quite entertainin'. But Flavor Flav must be killed. In order for black people to truly reach the promised land, Flavor Flav has to be shot. These are important times! We got a black man runnin' for President! We don't need a nigger runnin' around with a fuckin' clock around his neck and a Viking hat on his head! \"Not this year, Flav, put a suit on! Nigga, put a suit on!\"\n\nYo, it's gonna be hard for Barack Obama to be President, 'cause Barack Obama has to overcome a handicap that the other candidate does not have to overcome. That's right. It's gonna be hard for Barack Obama to be President because Barack Obama has...a black wife. And I don't think a black lady can be First Lady of the United States. Yeah, I said it. I said it in Johannesburg, I said it! [cuts to London] I said it in London, England, I said that shit! [cuts to New York] I said it at the Apollo Theatre, I said that shit! I don't believe a black woman could be First Lady, 'cause you know why? Because a black woman cannot play the background of a relationship! [some women boo] Don't get me wrong, a black woman could be President with no problem. First Lady--too much shuttin' up in that job. Can you imagine tellin' your black wife that you President? \"Honey, I won, I'm President!\" \"No, we President! And I want my girlfriends in the cabinet! I want Kiki to be Secretary of Defense! She can fight, she can fight.\"\n\nGeorge Bush is still in charge. And nobody gives less of a fuck than George Bush. You think you don't give a fuck? Bush don't give a fuck. Nobody gives less of a fuck than George Bush. If you was hangin' from a cliff, gettin' ready to fall to your death--that's right--and Bush was at the top of the cliff, and all you needed was a fuck to save your life, and Bush had a pocket full of fucks...he wouldn't give you one. \"Hey, Bush, I need a fuck!\" \"Ohh, you know I don't give a fuck. Here's a fuck...psych!\"\n\nI will give you an example of how race affects my life. I live in a place called Alpine, New Jersey. Live in Alpine, New Jersey, right? My house costs millions of dollars. [some whistles and cheers from the audience] Don't hate the player, hate the game. In my neighborhood, there are four black people. Hundreds of houses, four black people. Who are these black people? Well, there's me, Mary J. Blige, Jay-Z and Eddie Murphy. Only black people in the whole neighborhood. So let's break it down, let's break it down: me, I'm a decent comedian. I'm a'ight. [applause] Mary J. Blige, one of the greatest R&B singers to ever walk the Earth. Jay-Z, one of the greatest rappers to ever live. Eddie Murphy, one of the funniest actors to ever, ever do it. Do you know what the white man who lives next door to me does for a living? He's a fucking dentist! He ain't the best dentist in the world...he ain't going to the dental hall of fame...he don't get plaques for getting rid of plaque. He's just a yank-your-tooth-out dentist. See, the black man gotta fly to get to somethin' the white man can walk to.\n\nThere's nothin' a white person could ever say to me that will ever catch me off-guard. Ever! I'm always lookin' for some racism! No matter where the fuck I'm at, I'm like \"where the racism at? Where it at, where it at, where it at?\" No matter where I'm at. I could be sittin' down with Regis Philbin, doin' an interview, talkin' about Madagascar 2, sayin' \"yeah, Regis, Madagascar 2's real good, man. I play a zebra again! Oh, this motherfucker's great!\" And right in the middle of the interview, Regis'll pull a pencil out of his pocket, stab me in the neck and say \"take that, ya fuckin' nigger! Take that, ya dirty, greasy nigger! Take that, ya fuckin' nigger!\" And I'd be like \"I shoulda seen it comin'. I let Regis get too close.\" I'll be mad at me. I'll apologize--\"hey, man, I left my neck all out, man. I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry.\"\n\n[on Isaiah Washington being fired] What if the person that he called a faggot...was acting like a faggot? You don't have to be gay to act like a faggot. You don't even have to be a man to act like a faggot. Anybody can act like a faggot. Let me give you an example: I love Gwen Stefani. I think No Doubt is one of the best groups in the world; I keep a No Doubt CD in my car and I sing that shit to the end. I'm like \"don't speak, I know just what you're sayin', oh, please stop explainin'\"...I won't even get out my car 'til the shit's over. I'm like \"you know you're good, you know you're real good...la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, [high pitched] Don't! Don't!\" I fuckin' love me some Gwen Stefani! Now, if I'm drivin' my car, and I'm at the light, and you in the car behind me, and the light's red, and I'm just sittin' there blasting some Gwen Stefani and I'm like \"ain't no hollaback girl! Ain't no hollaback girl! Ain't no hollaback!\" And you in the car behind me and the light's red--cool. But then the light turns green. And I don't see it, because I'm in Gwen Stefani heaven. And I'm just goin' \"Ain't no hollaback girl! Ain't no hollaback girl! Ain't no hollaback!\" Now the light starts fuckin' blinking! It's gettin' ready to turn red again, and I *still* don't see it, and I'm in my car going \"This shit is bananas! B-na-na-na-nas! This shit is bananas! B-na-na-na-nas!\" Now if you in the car behind me, and that light's gettin' ready to turn red, and I'm going \"this shit is bananas! B-na-na-na-nas!\" If you in the car behind me, you have the right to go \"HEY, FAGGOT! The light's about to change!\" Shit, even Elton John would call me a faggot at that moment. It's not the word, it's the context in which the word is bein' said!\n\nShit, last year the NAACP had a funeral for the word \"nigger\"! Well, tonight is Easter!\n\nSo the question is, can white people say \"nigger\"? And the answer's the same: \"Not really.\" Oh there's some exceptions like, \"Fuck me harder, nigger!\" Lot of white women trying not to laugh in front of their husbands right now. \"Honey I was in college! I had to see what it was about! He made me say it!\"\n\nBut the question remains the same: Can white people say \"nigger\"? And the answer's the same: not really. But wait a minute, there's one exception. There's one exception. There's one instance where white people can say nigger. And I'ma let it out tonight. I'ma let it out here in Johannesburg. The one time that white people can say nigger. White people are like \"this is what I paid for! It's a fuckin' great night now!\" The one time white people can say nigger: here it goes; listen closely. 'Cause I may never say this shit again. The one time white people can say nigger, OK: if it's Christmas Eve, and it's between 4:30 and 4:49 in the morning. If you white, and you're on your way to Toys 'R' Us to get your kid the last Transformer doll, and right before you walk into Toys 'R' Us, some black person runs up beside you, smacks you in the head with a brick, knocks you to the ground, stomps on your face--\"take that, you cracker-ass motherfucker!\" Riverdances on your head--\"take that, you cracker-ass motherfucker!\" Takes your money, pisses on you, and runs away--if you white, at that moment, you can say \"Somebody stop that nigger!\" Matter of fact, if you white and that happens to you, you can say nigger for a whole month! But you gotta walk around with the police report in your pocket. In case any black people catch you sayin' nigger, the police report will act as your freedom papers. \"Hey, I heard you saying nigger; let me see your fuckin' papers. Gimme the papers; show me the papers!\" [pretends to read a sheet] \"Christmas Eve! 4:48! You just made it, motherfucker! Pissed on you! ...I hope they catch that nigger!\"\n\nOn Desperate Housewives: I think they should change the name of that show from Desperate Housewives...to Ungrateful Bitches! You all are hoes bitch!\n\nJudd Apatow Interview (2014)\n\n[edit]\n\nfrom Apatow's Sick in the Head (2015) pp 61–71\n\nI try never to brag but I'm probably the only person who has been on 60 Minutes twice and isn't dead.\n\nI love going to the Cellar and spanking the shit out of everybody. I love going there, at my age, and having an act that's better than the guys who are fifteen or twenty years younger than me. I'm like \"This is my seventh special. What's your fucking excuse?\"\n\nYou learn more from fucking up than you do from success, unfortunately. And failure, if you don't let it defeat you, is what fuels your future success.\n\nQuotes about Rock\n\n[edit]\n\nChris Rock is not only the best comedian in the world, he is WAY better than everyone else. Period.\n\nJudd Apatow, Sick in the Head (2015) p 61\n\nComedian Chris Rock recently came out about being on the Autism spectrum; specifically, he was diagnosed with Nonverbal Learning Disorder. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, he describes how clear-cut indicators (such as an inability to pick up on social cues and a tendency to take all statements hyperliterally) were ignored until his mid-fifties. Because he was an outgoing, Black comedian, Autism seemed unthinkable as an explanation for the social and emotional challenges he was facing. Rock says he downplayed his own mental health needs, too, because he'd internalized the idea only white people go to therapy.\n\nDevon Price ‘’Unmasking Autism: Discovering the New Faces of Neurodiversity’’ p 62\n\nChris Rock might be the only comedian I know who's maybe a little better at analogies than I am. He's a great analogizer.\n\nJerry Seinfeld, \"Success Without Stress\" Interview (22 January 2014)\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to:"
