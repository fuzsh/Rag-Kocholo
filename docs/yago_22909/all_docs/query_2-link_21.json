        "text": "Theater counts: The Creator lands on top as trio of new films arrive in cinemas\n\nSeptember 28th, 2023\n\nAfter a lackluster few weeks, this weekend sees three new films open wide, along with an even wider expansion for Dumb Money. While none of this week’s new arrivals will likely make a monumental splash, they should nevertheless deliver a fun and competitive weekend at the domestic box office, while providing movie aficionados with a wider range of genres to choose from. More...\n\nTheater counts: Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile debuts in an impressive 4,350 theaters\n\nOctober 6th, 2022\n\nMaking its theatrical entrance and simultaneously holding the position of widest release this week is the live-action hybrid musical comedy Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile. Releasing in 4,350 cinemas, the PG-rated singing animal feature stars Shawn Mendes as the titular character, who lives the in the attic of the Primm family in New York City. Finding difficulties in adapting to his new surroundings, young son Josh discovers Lyle and the two become fast friends but must band together after Lyle’s existence is threatened. Previews for Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile began on Thursday in 3,450 theaters. More...\n\nTheater counts: Wrath of Man fends off newcomers\n\nMay 13th, 2021\n\nWrath of Man entered last week’s chart as one of only two new wide releases. The other, Here Today, was never going to challenge for widest release, or at the box office. This week was more of an unknown as we see the debut of Lionsgate's Spiral. The latest film from the Saw franchise, starring Chris Rock, Max Minghella and Samuel L. Jackson, is opening in 2,811 locations. Also new this week is Profile, the thriller from Focus Features, which debuts in 2,033 theaters. Rounding out the new wide releases is Those Who Wish Me Dead and Finding You, with the latter playing in 1,312 locations. While we don’t have a reported number for Those Who Wish Me Dead yet, estimates have the film opening in around 2,900 locations... More...\n\nDVD and Blu-ray Releases for March 17th, 2015\n\nMarch 17th, 2015\n\nIt's a busy / short week on the home market. There are four first-run releases coming out this week, which is more than most weeks. However, it is also a very shallow week and we run into filler on the first page of Amazon's list of best-selling new releases. The best of the first-run releases is Top Five, but the DVD or Blu-ray Combo Pack isn't quite Pick of the Week material. For that honor, we have to look to a smaller release, Song of the Sea on DVD or Blu-ray Combo Pack. More...\n\nFeatured Blu-ray / DVD Review: Top Five\n\nMarch 16th, 2015\n\nTop Five is the latest film written and directed by Chris Rock. Chris Rock is one of the biggest stand-up comics around; however, his film career has never truly taken off. He has had some missteps with critics, but even films that earned amazing reviews failed to find an audience in theaters. For instance, this film pulled in just $25 million during the holidays. Does it deserve to find a wider audience? Or will critics like this more than the average moviegoer? More...\n\n2014 Preview: December\n\nDecember 1st, 2014\n\nNovember is over and there are not a lot of positive things to say about what happened during the month. There were a couple of films that matched expectations, but there were no breakout hits and a few that missed expectations by wide margins. Granted, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1 will top $300 million with relative ease, but that's still nearly $100 million lower than some people were predicting. The month ends with 2014 about $300 million behind 2013's pace and there's really no chance to catch up in December. That doesn't mean there are no films that will be worth watching in December. The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies should at least earn $200 million, while $300 million is not out of the question. Additionally, there are several films that at least have a shot at $100 million at the box office, but not all will get there. At least this December and last December are on par with each other. The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug topped $250 million while there were three others that topped $100 million. I think we will get the same result this month. Last year there were a lot more wide releases, but many of them bombed. I think this year the lack of competition will help more films reach their potential.

Will fans of the movies be interested in watching it? And is the DVD worth picking up? More...\n\nFeatured Blu-ray / DVD Review: Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted\n\nOctober 18th, 2012"
