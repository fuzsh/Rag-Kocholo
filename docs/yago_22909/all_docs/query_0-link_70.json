        "text": "2007 film by Chris RockTemplate:SHORTDESC:2007 film by Chris Rock\n\nI Think I Love My Wife is a 2007 American romantic comedy film starring Chris Rock and Kerry Washington. Rock co-wrote the film with Louis C.K. and also directed and produced it. It is a remake of the 1972 French film Chloe in the Afternoon by Éric Rohmer.\n\nPlot[]\n\nRichard Cooper (Chris Rock) is a very happily married and professionally successful man. He is perfectly content with his home life in suburban New York with his lovely wife Brenda (Gina Torres), a teacher, and his two young children. There is one problem in his marriage: their sex life has stagnated, leaving Richard frustrated and sex-starved. At one point, Brenda accuses Richard of being on the down-low. During those dull days at the office, he occasionally fantasizes about other women, but never acts upon his impulses.\n\nAn encounter with an attractive old friend, Nikki (Kerry Washington), suddenly casts doubt over his typically resilient self-control. At first she claims to just want to be his friend, but she begins to show up consistently at his Manhattan financial office just to talk or have lunch, which causes his boss, secretaries, and peers to view him with varying degrees of contempt. When Nikki begins to deliberately seduce Richard, he does not know what to do. Against his better judgment, he flies with her out of town for one day on an errand, where he is beaten by her boyfriend. Then he returns too late to make a sales presentation at an important business meeting, causing the loss of a lucrative contract. Later, when she and her fiancé are about to move to Los Angeles, Nikki asks Richard to come to her apartment later to say a \"proper goodbye\". When he gets to Nikki's apartment, he finds her in her underwear in her bathroom. In the moments before it seems Richard will consummate his attraction to Nikki, he realizes how grave the loss of his wife and children would be, so he walks out on Nikki. Richard returns home, surprising his wife, and, for the first time in the film, they begin to rebuild a genuine rapport, with a possible promise of good things to come.\n\nCast[]\n\nChris Rock as Richard Cooper\n\nKerry Washington as Nikki Tru\n\nGina Torres as Brenda Cooper\n\nSteve Buscemi as George\n\nEdward Herrmann as Mr. Landis\n\nWelker White as Tracy\n\nSamantha Ivers as Mary\n\nMichael Kenneth Williams as Teddy\n\nOrlando Jones as Nelson\n\nCassandra Freeman as Jennifer\n\nStephen A.
