        "text": "(born 1966). Chris Rock emerged in the 1990s as one of the most popular comedians in the United States. His stand-up routine often revealed the humorous aspects of some of the more serious, painful truths of the African American experience. Rock also had a successful film career.\n\nChristopher Julius Rock III was born in Georgetown, South Carolina, on February 7, 1966, but grew up in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, New York. After dropping out of high school at age 17 (he later received a high-school-equivalency diploma), he started to perform in comedy clubs in New York City. Rock was spotted by comedian Eddie Murphy, who selected him for a television special and a role in the film Beverly Hills Cop II (1987). In 1990 Rock became one of the cast members of Saturday Night Live. He left the show in 1993 to join the program In Living Color, which was canceled the following year. Rock also appeared in the films I’m Gonna Git You Sucka (1988) and New Jack City (1991). Rock starred in and wrote the script for the film CB4 (1993), and he appeared in the first of his HBO comedy specials the following year.\n\nIn the mid-1990s Rock’s popularity as an actor and comedian began to fade. In an effort to reignite his career, he took his stand-up act on the road in 1996, playing in small clubs. There Rock honed his act, touching on subjects that were often considered taboo, such as race relations, drug addiction, and black poverty. Rock’s 1997 cable television special Bring the Pain, a recorded performance of his stand-up routine, gained him popular and critical acclaim as well as two Emmy Awards. He went on to star in the television series The Chris Rock Show (1997–2000); he also published a best-selling book, Rock This! (1997). Rock costarred in the film Lethal Weapon 4 (1998) and taped several more cable television specials, including Bigger and Blacker (1999) and Never Scared (2004).\n\nThe television comedy series Everybody Hates Chris, which drew on Rock’s childhood experiences, debuted in 2005 and earned Rock his third Emmy. Also in 2005, Rock hosted the Academy Awards ceremony. He directed as well as starred in the film Head of State (2003). Rock costarred with comedian Adam Sandler in The Longest Yard (2005). For the animated feature films Madagascar (2005), Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa (2008), and Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most Wanted (2012), he provided the voice of a zebra. In 2007 Rock cowrote, directed, and starred in I Think I Love My Wife, a remake of the 1972 French film Chloe in the Afternoon. Two years later Rock investigated the hairstyles of African American women in the documentary Good Hair. He made his debut acting in a Broadway play in 2011.\n\nRock’s later films included Death at a Funeral (2010); Grown Ups (2010) and Grown Ups 2 (2013), both costarring Sandler; What to Expect When You’re Expecting (2012); and 2 Days in New York (2012). Rock wrote, directed, and starred in Top Five (2014), about a comedian struggling to transition to more serious fare. The film was praised for successfully situating his cutting humor in a moving and believable narrative. Rock was chosen to host the 2016 Academy Awards ceremony."
