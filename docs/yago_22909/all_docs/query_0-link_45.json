        "text": "Richard Cooper is a stand-up guy. A successful investment banker in New York, he forgoes lunch for efficiency’s sake. He also likes to wander, taking pleasure in late afternoons in Manhattan.\n\nHe’s been married to Brenda, a lovely schoolteacher, for seven years. They have two kids.\n\nRichard is quick to let the audience know in a voice-over that grates more than charms that they are no longer having the sex that made that possible.\n\nThey visit a therapist who gives them the sort of advice Richard might consider if the woman offering it and scribbling notes knew what she was talking about. But, hey, she’s not hitched.\n\nYes, Richard’s experiencing a seven-year itch. Watching him scratch it is about as much fun as watching your dog suffer with fleas.\n\nChris Rock, the man who plays Richard in “I Think I Love My Wife,” is a stand-up comedian. This fact weighs heavily on the often shrill comedy.\n\nDirected and written by the talented comic, the movie suffers from the overblown notes of a punch-line-driven routine.\n\nRock and co-writer Louis C.K. based their film on the 1972 French film “Chloe in the Afternoon,” about Frederick – a faithful, if fantasizing, businessman – who begins a precarious flirtation with an old acquaintance.\n\nThere’s something lovely about Rock finding in the last of Eric Rohmer’s “Six Moral Tales” an opportunity to say something fresh about middle-class life and marriage for the hip-hop (and beyond) generation. And “I Think I Love My Wife” should be treated as a failed experiment more than a crass disaster.\n\nRohmer’s film is wry and meditative, and oh so French. It begins with a rumination about reading. Frederick’s girl-watching is tinged with musings about a woman (his wife), Woman (the ideal), and the women he encounters in Paris.\n\nRock’s fantasies are more booty call than contemplative. Had Rock made Richard’s hankerings less immature, his comedy would hit truer notes.\n\nAs it is, Richard is a more pathetic than empathetic character. He may chalk up his wandering lust to boredom but too often it has the markings of arrested development.\n\nIf you see Rohmer’s picture for the first time after “I Think I Love My Wife,” you’ll be struck by how unglamorous Chloe is. Not so her counterpart in Rock’s film.\n\nKerry Washington (“Ray”) plays Nikki, the woman who shows up out of the past and tips Richard’s world over. Gina Torres holds down the fort as wife Brenda.\n\nYears earlier, Nikki drove Richard’s best friend to the brink. When she arrives unannounced at the offices of Pupkin & Langford, she looks like an escort. Dressed for seduction morning, afternoon or night, Nikki is meant to put the hint of doubt in the title. But Washington has to work too hard against her skimpy wardrobe to add layers to her character.\n\nSteve Buscemi plays Richard’s philandering colleague. Never troubled by his dalliances, he’s intended to remind us and Richard that he is truly the better man.\n\nUltimately the responsibility for convincing us of this rests with Rock. But Richard’s piercing tone makes him more than an unreliable narrator.\n\nHe’s a hysterical one. And that doesn’t mean funny.\n\n“I Think I Love My Wife”\n\nR for pervasive language and some sexual content|1 hour, 37 minutes|MARITAL COMEDY|Directed by Chris Rock; co-written by Rock and Louis C.K., based on the film “Chloe in the Afternoon”; photography by William Rexer II; starring Chris Rock, Kerry Washington, Gina Torres, Edward Herrmann, Steve Buscemi |Opens today at area theaters."
