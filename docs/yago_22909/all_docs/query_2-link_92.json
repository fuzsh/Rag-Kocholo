        "text": "Between entering a very cute relationship with Lake Bell, that incident at the Oscars, and going on a buzzy tour, Chris Rock has been in the news a lot lately. But obviously this comedy icon has been famous for decades, and he's made bonkers amounts of money along the way thanks to a combination of acting, stand up, and producing a beloved long-running TV show (Everybody Hates Chris, anyone?). Time to get into his net worth, starting with some drama, naturally.\n\nInside His Divorce Settlement\n\nChris split up with his wife Malaak Compton in 2016 after over a decade of marriage, and their divorce settlement allegedly set him back as much as $40 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. A lot of money, but not even close to what Chris has in the bank so seems safe to assume he's not sweating it.\n\nBreaking Down His Saturday Night Live Salary\n\nSaturday Night Live salaries are slightly complicated, so we have a whole breakdown of them over this way. But basically, first year cast members make $7,000 per episode for a ~21 episode season, or around $147,000. Second year cast members make more like $168,000 per season, and five year cast members make $315,000 per season. Chris was on the show for three seasons in the early '90s, so let's assume he made slightly under $1 million total from his time there.\n\nHe's Done a Ton of Work in TV and Movies\n\nDetails on Chris's per project rate haven't been disclosed, but his work on TV and in film is prolific. Everybody Hates Chris alone was on for 88 episodes! Meanwhile, Forbes reports that Chris made $42 million between June 1, 2008, and June 1, 2009, the same year he worked on Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa and Death at a Funeral, went on a worldwide tour, dropped a HBO stand-up special, and inked a \"lucrative syndication run\" for Everyone Hates Chris.\n\nBut it sounds like Chris made the bulk money through his comedy specials: In 2016, Netflix paid him $40 million for two (2) specials !!!!!\n\nHis Earnings in 2017 Were Wild\n\nAccording to Forbes, Chris earned $57 million alone in 2017, mostly thanks to that huge Netflix payday as well as his Total Blackout tour. FYI, his earnings in 2018 were $30 million thanks to touring and his The Week Of payday, and this earned him a spot on the Forbes list of highest paid comedians.\n\nHe's Made Some Decent Real Estate Investments\n\nSpecifically in property. Chris owned a gorgeous carriage house in Brooklyn that he used to rent out for $8,000 a month (!!!) but put on the market for $3.9 million in 2017. Apparently he also has a home in the New Jersey suburbs which is worth about $3 million.\n\nSo, What Is Chris Rock's Net Worth?"
