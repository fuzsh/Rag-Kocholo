        "text": "Rock reportedly had no idea that Jada has alopecia, something that she had been openly talking about since 2018. The tasteless remark did not sit well with Will who then marched onstage to hit his former The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air guest star.\n\nSmith, who then won best actor for King Richard later in the ceremony, might have issued a prompt apology. But that’s far from the last repercussions he’s face for his petulant outburst.\n\nHere’s how the slap may affect Will Smith’s career – and the surprising way he may be benefiting from the incident.\n\nSmith has been banned from the Oscars\n\nTaking responsibility for his actions, Smith has resigned from the Academy. This decision means that he will no longer be a voting member but he will still retain his best actor award.\n\nAfter resigning, the Academy has reached a decision to slap him with a 10-year ban as part of his punishment. However, he is not banned from being nominated or winning in the future – he just has to send a representative to accept the trophy on his behalf.\n\nHis movie projects are delayed\n\nSmith’s career may be in limbo as his upcoming Netflix film Fast and Loose has been put on hold, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe movie’s director also withdrew from the project in favour of Fall Guy, starring Ryan Gosling, produced by Universal.\n\nAnother project, Bad Boys 4, is also facing uncertainty. According to Esquire, Smith was reportedly given the first 40 pages of the film’s script, but production has slowed as well for the time being.\n\nHis actions may compromise diversity progress\n\nIn a guest column for The Hollywood Reporter, Selma star David Oyelowo wondered if the incident would imperil the progress the industry has made since #OscarsSoWhite, the hashtag campaign that called out the Academy for lack of diversity in 2015. He feared that the incident “will have a negative effect on the ongoing push for inclusion”.\n\nIt affected his family\n\nWhile Smith’s image and brand bore the brunt of the fallout. According to US Magazine, citing an anonymous source close to the family, the altercation was “a nightmare for everyone”. The publication’s source added that Smith’s road to redemption will be long and painful, “and there’s a part of him that’s grown to accept he’ll never be able to fully repair the damage that was caused”.\n\nAnd yet … his memoir is climbing bestselling lists\n\nDespite the setback, the incident apparently provided an imprimitive for fans to understand Smith better. His memoir, Will, jumped on The New York Times bestseller list (combined print and e-book nonfiction) from No 14 to No 2.\n\nWhen the book debuted in November 2021, it landed at No 3 on the same chart and remained for 15 weeks. This month it also returned to USA Today’s list of top 150 best selling books, sitting pretty at the No 73 spot."
