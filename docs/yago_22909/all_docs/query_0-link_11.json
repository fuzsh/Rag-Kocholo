        "text": "I give him lots of kudos for wanting to not just direct but also to write, produce and star in his own feature.\n\nChris Rock, arguably one of this generation’s funniest comedians, may have bitten off a little more than he can consume here. I can certainly admire his desire to grow as both an actor and filmmaker, but when you sacrifice the comedy … I mean, isn’t that his main selling point? Comedy? Uh, yeah!\n\nWith a script co-written by fellow comic Louis C.K. (whose HBO comedy series was pretty weak), one would think there would be plenty of gags to go around. That and the fact that both comics are known for pushing the comedic level of blueness pretty far – I was expecting a laugh riot from the get-go, but instead got an “Oh, no.” Darn.\n\nHere we have Rock as Richard “Dick” Cooper, a hen-pecked husband in a job as an investment banker – an all buttoned-up type with no hype, and we’re led to believe he’s in a happy relationship with his wife, Brenda (Gina Torres).\n\nOK, so I’m seeing the build-up and getting ready for the soon-to-be one-two punchline that will leave me in stitches, right? I mean, I can bypass some of the continuity problems here (and there are many; trust me) once I get that first burst of “ha-ha” out. Well, it’s a long wait, and even though there are a few funny moments (mostly with the other cast members), overall the movie dragged, I’m afraid. What? Where’s that in-your-face Rock that leaves you in tears, you say? A few bursts of promise, but then back to the cantankerous squabbling between the sexes.\n\n“I Think I Love My Wife” is loosely based on the French film “Chloe in the Afternoon,” the concluding opus in Eric Rohmer’s famous suite “Moral Tales,” which was made some 35 years ago. I’m hesitant to call it a remake, because that would be an insult to the original.\n\nHere we have what is supposed to be a decent union between man and wife, when out of the blue appears another woman named Nikki (Kerry Washington), who’s an old friend of Richard’s via a friend of his, and very hot. And, yes, she makes the moves on the married man, so will he or won’t he? So she has re-entered his life, and then Nikki decides to show up at his office after hours, and then he becomes smitten, questions his feelings toward his wife and … well, you get the idea.\n\nOf course, it’s never that simple, and Nikki’s pretty much a tease, telling him where to meet and then turning out to be a no-show, or having her boyfriend pop up in one of the scenes. Why Richard even decides to spend any time with this woman is a mystery. Meanwhile, Richard is in therapy with Brenda, wondering why she won’t put out, and that’s odd because the set-up (at first) was that he was happy in his relationship, and now here they are confronting a counselor and he’s asking why his wife won’t have sex with him. I know she’s somewhat frigid with him, and this is his out, since he dreams of having affairs anyway.\n\nOne of the movie’s few redeeming qualities (besides that it wasn’t “Norbit”) was some of the supporting cast. At least Rock wrote in some characters that were entertaining to watch. One of my favorite character actors, Steve Buscemi, plays a married man (George) who fools around, and all I kept thinking was this was the guy from “Fargo,” and he’s getting dates? Edward Herr- mann is another character actor usually reserved for those uptight kind of guys and, as imagined, plays Richard’s boss, Mr. Landis. I wish they would have had more lines and more screen time.\n\nI did have to laugh at the idea that some have referred to this as a romantic comedy, when really it’s neither of those two! Then again, if you liked “Pootie Tang,” you’ll probably enjoy this flick.\n\n– Howie Nave is host/manager of The Improv comedy club inside Harveys and reviews films for seven radio stations throughout northern California and Nevada, including the Sirius Radio Network every Sunday evening. He hosts “Howie’s Morning Rush” on Tahoe’s KRLT radio and you can see his film reviews every Friday morning on KOLO ABC TV Channel 8.\n\nKeepin’ it Reel\n\nNow playing: “I Think I Love My Wife”\n\nStarring: Chris Rock, Kerry Washington, Gina Torres, Steve Buscemi and Edward Herrmann\n\nDirected by: Chris Rock\n\nRated: R for pervasive language and some sexual content\n\nLength: 90 minutes\n\nHowie gives it: 2 out of 5 bagels"
