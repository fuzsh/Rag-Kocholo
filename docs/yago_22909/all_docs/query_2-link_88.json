        "text": "Rock has been in the headlines a lot since he was infamously slapped by Will Smith at the 2022 Oscars, but Bale recently told IndieWire that he had to distance himself from the comedian because he was getting too distracted.\n\nBale said, \"Chris is so bloody funny and I found that I couldn't act because I was just becoming Christian laughing at Chris Rock.\"\n\nThe Academy Award winner spoke to Rock about the situation, saying: \"So I had to go to him, I went, 'Mate, I love talking to you, and we have mutual friends, but I can't do it anymore.'\"\n\nHe added: \"'Because David [O. Russell] didn't ask me to make this film so he could just watch me giggle. He wants me to be Burt, and I'm forgetting how to be Burt.'\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nHowever, Bale pointed out that he often takes himself away from other actors on set so that he can stay focused, adding: \"I often meet these incredible people, but I isolate myself. Because if I get to know people too much, I find I just don't believe what I'm doing in the scene.\"\n\nDirector David O. Russell is best known for movies like \"The Fighter\" and \"American Hustle,\" but his latest offering follows three friends who make a pact to protect each other during World War I before they wind up accused of murder.\n\nBale stars as Burt Berendsen alongside Margot Robbie as Valerie Voze, and John David Washington as Harold Woodsman. Rock plays Milton King, who can be seen at the start of the trailer confronting the trio over a dead man in a box.\n\nThe ensemble cast is also stacked with talent, including the likes of Zoe Saldana, Anya Taylor-Joy, Robert De Niro, Michael Shannon, Rami Malek, Mike Myers, Andrea Riseborough, and Timothy Olyphant.\n\n\"Amsterdam\" arrives in theaters on October 7."
