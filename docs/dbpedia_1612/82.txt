The final span has been placed on a 1.6km crossing of Kola Bay in the Barents Sea inside the Polar Circle. The US$100 million bridge in Russia's Murmansk region is due for completion next year. Construction began in 1992 and it was originally due to be finished in 2000. The bridge will link military bases to towns on the other side of the bay, shortening journeys by 16km.
