        "text": "Snow Worries is a level in Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, located in Pippy Beach. It is the first to feature snow.\n\nThunder Eggs[]\n\nCollect 300 Opals\n\nExplore the map and collect all 300 opals.\n\nFind 5 Bilbies\n\nBilby 1: This one is really hard to find if you don't know where to look and also very hard for me to describe its location. All I can say is that he is before the frozen lake, if you go back up the ice slope with the tree where Bilby 5 is. You'll find it on a small pillar on the side of the ice slope, in a corner of the field... Look carefully as he's a pain to find even if you know its location. (Somewhere near where you found the fifth koala, see below)\n\nBilby 2: In the large area with the many rock pillars and the inclined field (at the right along the right ice slope near the beginning), go at the end of this area and you'll see ice blocks stacked up one over the other. Break them using the Flamerang and rescue the Bilby on the pillar behind.\n\nBilby 3: At the base of the mountain, choose the path on your right (the one you climb up using the small snow platforms on the mountain's side) and you'll find the Bilby in the area just above.\n\nBilby 4: Near the musical icicles cave, you have surely noticed an unreachable Bilby on a high pillar near the rockface. Back up a bit to another pillar, but this one is more low so you can go on it. From this one, jump on the ice platforms in the air (hard to see but they're there) until you reach the highest pillar with the Bilby on.\n\nBilby 5: Near the frozen lake, look on one of the sides of the lake to see a ice spot (not on the lake, but next to it) with a tree in the center and many enemies around it. Look next to this tree for a Bilby.\n\nTime Attack\n\nAfter rescuing Sheila's baby koalas, return to the starting point and start a race against the clock. The goal is located at the top of the mountain and you have 2:30 to get there. You'll receive the Thunder Egg if you make it there on time and don't miss any rings.\n\nKoala Chaos\n\nAt the beginning, Sheila will ask you to bring her back her 8 baby koalas that lost themselves into the field. They are quite scattered...\n\n1 to 4: In the first area where Sheila's house is, they are 4 of them hidden under snow heaps in the field. Throw the Flamerang at them to melt the snow and liberate the children. They are in the ones surrounded by kangaroos.\n\n5: If you go slide the right ice slope at the beginning, you will eventually come to a snow field on your right with a path blocked by some ice bushes. Throw the Flamerang to break them and at the end of the path, melt the snow heap to find the koala.\n\n6&7: In the large area with the many rock pillars and the inclined field (at the right along the right ice slope near the beginning), these 2 koalas are on the two highest pillars. Climb on the smaller ones and glide to the highest ones where the babies are. (One on a front pillar and the other one on a back pillar)\n\n8: In the area in the middle of the two ice slopes near the start (with the pillars and the herbs/ground through the snow on the path), the last koala is hidden in a snow heap between some kangaroos, throw the Flamerang at it to melt it and liberate the baby. Return to Sheila to receive the Thunder Egg.\n\nThe old mill\n\nIn the mountain area, go up all 3 wooden silos that are connected to the old sawmill and press each switch in the enclosure at the end. Each switch pressed will raise a wooden platform near the sawmill on top of the mountain. Look around the mountain for the 3 silos and avoid the saws in each one to reach the top. After the 3 switches have been pressed, return to the top of the mountain and climb on the 3 wooden platforms that appeared to reach the top of the sawmill. The Thunder Egg is on the roof.\n\nTrap the yabby\n\nGo on the frozen lake and break one of the breakable ice spots to end up in the water. Go underwater and find the Thunder Egg laying on the ground. A lobster will come to steal it though. If you want to get it back, you'll have to hit the lobster with your Aquarang in direction of the alcove in one of the walls. Hit him enough times until the lobster is inside the alcove. Once he's in it, hit the stalagmites above the alcove to make them fall. This way you'll trap the yabby and he'll hand back the Thunder Egg.\n\nMusical Icicles\n\nWhen you arrive at the base of the mountain, take the right path to climb up. Then go up the stairs and after the stairs, go to the right and enter the cave you'll see in the rockface. Kill the spiders inside and look at the ceiling to see 5 colored icicles. Hit them with a boomerang in the right order to receive the Thunder Egg. If you hit the wrong icicle, it'll fall. The right order is : red, orange, yellow, green, blue.\n\nSnowy peak\n\nThis Thunder Egg is waiting for you at the very top of the mountain\n\nGolden Cogs[]\n\n#1 On a pillar behind Sheila's house.\n\n#2 Go on the right slope at the beginning and slide until you arrive in a small area on your right with pillars set in circle, in order from small ones to tallest ones. Climb on the smallest pillars to the top one with the Golden Cog on.\n\n#3 In the large area with the many rock pillars and the inclined field (at the right along the right ice slope near the beginning), look near the stacked up ice blocks for a way leading to another area. The Golden Cog is on a pillar there.\n\n#4 On the frozen lake, go on the small mountain in the center using the small pillars on the other side of the mountain. The Golden Cog is in the middle of that small mountain.\n\n#5 This one is over one of the breakable ice spots on the frozen lake. If you want to grab the Golden Cog without breaking the ice, go up the little slope near the ice spot and slide it down to get some run up. Let Ty slide to the ice spot, don't touch any button and he'll slide over the ice without breaking it. He should slide to the Golden Cog or almost to it. If you're near enough, jump to it to grab it or if you think you're too far, only press the control stick slightly so Ty will walk very slowly over the ice, that way it won't break. Then jump and grab the Golden Cog when you're under it.\n\n#6 In one of the underwater tunnels in the lake.\n\n#7 In the lake, hit the switch at the bottom of the water in the 2nd large room to open a gate in one of the tunnels. Swim through that gate and in the tunnel behind is the Golden Cog.\n\n#8 Before going on the mountain, go up the first stairway at the base of the mountain and turn to the left to see a small mountain of snow nearby. Glide to it and go on top. Then glide to the pillar with the Golden Cog on.\n\n#9 In the area where the musical icicles cave is, look for another cave in the rockface leading to a Golden Cog.\n\n#10 On one of the beams of the highest wooden silo leading to the sawmill. Drop from the area above and glide to the beam.\n\n#Extra Life: Under a snow heap near the beginning.\n\nPicture Frames[]\n\nBehind Sheila's house, above the tree\n\nAt the end of the small path left from Sheila's house\n\nAbove a tree in the first area near Sheila's house\n\nBehind the pillars where Golden Cog 2 is (see walkthrough)\n\nOn the right side of the right ice slope near the one mentioned above\n\nAt the right of the area in the middle of the 2 ice slopes\n\nIn the area with the ice barriers\n\nIn the area with the pillars and the inclined field, at the right\n\nIn the area mentioned above, behind the ice blocks\n\nNear Bilby 1 (see walkthrough), above the ground part\n\nNear Golden Cog 3 (see walkthrough), on the other side of the ice slope\n\nGo right from where Bilby 5 was (see walkthrough)\n\nAt the end of the shore mentioned above\n\nNear the start of the start of the ice near the area mentioned above\n\nBetween the 2 ice slopes at the bottom\n\nAbove the right ice slope, half-way\n\nOn the left side of the left ice slope\n\nSame as above, a little further from\n\nJust before the lake, at the bottom of the left ice slope\n\nOn the other side of the lake, on the shore over the ground spot\n\nAt the end of the shore mentioned above\n\nNear the path that goes through the shore mentioned above\n\nOn the other side of the cliff that's on the shore mentioned above\n\nAbove the ground part near Bilby 4 area (see walkthrough)"
