You can see the impressive transformation from an empty gravel yard to a security buffer in the #EnergySystem. But what is so special about Irsching 6? The power plant will serve exclusively as a security buffer for the #PowerSupply and will only step in at short notice in emergency situations when system security is at risk. ‚ÄúIrsching 6 is the future. It is now home to a modern, highly flexible power plant that is fully geared to the needs of the grid operator. Uniper looks forward to at least ten years of operation of Irsching 6 on behalf of TenneT and in the service of #SecurityOfSupply.‚Äù, says Holger Kreetz, our Chief Operating Officer.

The focus extends to these pivotal areas: 1. Effectiveness of Underwater Venting üí®: Unveiling innovative solutions, the team is exploring the efficiency and viability of underwater venting systems for methanol. This approach not only ensures safety but also offers flexibility in ship design, particularly addressing challenges related to toxic vapours. 2. Corrosion of Aluminium Exposed to Methanol üõ≥Ô∏è: With an emphasis on diverse ship materials, the team is meticulously studying the corrosion dynamics of aluminium exposed to methanol. This research is vital for ships, especially those constructed with aluminium, ensuring the long-term integrity and safety of fuel tanks in a methanol environment. 3. Leak Scenarios Due to Collision/Allision (Crashworthiness) üí•: In a commitment to fortify maritime structures, the project is exploring leak scenarios resulting from collisions or allisions. Understanding the crashworthiness of fuel containment systems is imperative, and the team is dedicated to developing robust strategies that enhance safety during unexpected events. These focal points underscore the holistic approach of MENENS, striving not only to advance sustainable energy carriers but also to establish the highest standards of safety within the maritime sector. ‚öìüåä During February we will explore some of these topics further. Stay tuned for TNO updates. #MENENS #TNO #Methanol #Marinefuel #MaritimeInnovation #SafetyFirst #EnergyTransition #SafeEnergyStorage\n\nüëâ üßê Exciting developments are underway in the SAFeCRAFT project! üåä Our partners at HYDRUS are currently leading Task 4.1, focusing on preparing the basic engineering package for #retrofitting an #alternative #fuel #supply #system onto a Demonstrator Vessel.

The beginning of a new year also brings major endings. MEWO S.A. is celebrating the completion of one of the longest monitoring projects in our nearly 11-year history. For 7 years, we have been part of a programme involving the monitoring of hydrometeorological parameters along the Central Coast of the Baltic Sea. The aim was to provide information on wave motion, sea currents, water level changes, water and air temperature, salinity as well as wind parameters for a strategic energy undertaking. The location of the surveys was problematic as it covered the near-shore zone, in which the impact of sea dynamics on the survival (or rather loss) of the survey equipment is greatest. Proprietary survey buoys, AWAC Doppler wave profilers, dozens of CTDs, and a tremendous commitment of MEWO's engineering teams. Respect to an entire generation of MEWO engineers who have grown together with the project, and to the patient Project Manager involved in this process since her early days at MEWO. More than 8200 full days of surveys, around 100 service cruises, 3 current profilers lost (found afterwards, 1.5 km away from the target location). Today, we are ready for further monitoring challenges, with reliable equipment and service teams in place. #MEWOteam #survey #surveyteam #offshore #project #Balticsea #water #wind #monitoring #hydrometeorologicalparameters\n\nIn this October's MARIN (Maritime Research Institute Netherlands) report, there is a feature article on the Concept study for Carbon Collectors Articulated Tug Barge (ATB) \"Central to the ATB concept is the integration of the pusher and the streamlined barge, a fusion that yields a unified appearance akin to a single, dynamically streamlined vessel. This is enabled through the tailored design of the barge's stern, which is attuned to the contours of the pusher vessel. Another innovative facet involves the utilisation of an additional barge as intermediate storage. While the ATB sets its course towards an offshore CO2 storage location, additional barges are used for storing carbon dioxide emitted from the factory.\" Want to know more?

Breakwaters play a critical role in protecting coastal structures and ensuring the safety of ports and harbors. Ensuring their stability is paramount, as any failure can lead to costly repairs, operational disruptions, and potential hazards. Correct block placement is a fundamental aspect of breakwater stability, governed by various factors such as contact, orientation, and density. The full article goes on to outline and discuss: ‚öìÔ∏è The Problem üåä Why SeaBat? ‚úÖ The SEABIM Solution ‚è±Ô∏è The SEABIM Process ü§ù Benefits of the Collaboration üîó Find out more >> https://hubs.la/Q02lDlXr0 The partnership between Teledyne‚Äôs SeaBat T51 and SEABIM software represents a cutting-edge approach to addressing the challenges of breakwater stability assessment. This collaborative solution sets a new standard for accuracy, efficiency, and safety in coastal structure management. It reinforces the importance of technological innovation in marine engineering and construction. üëè Read more on the Ocean Science & Technology website. #ocean #breakwater #environment #climatechange #publicsafety\n\nIn a segment which is crowded with players announcing ambitious decarbonisation plans, Seaspan Corporation has joined the party with their new series of feeder container vessels, designed in collaboration with Lloyd's Register. \"The vessel, measuring 198 m in length and developed by German naval architects Technolog is set to be powered by LNG but can be converted to run on ammonia. LR, Seaspan, and Technolog will soon begin work on the second phase of this project, which will be a dual-fuel ammonia feeder vessel.\" What is very interesting is that Seaspan has opted to adopt the forward bridge design for these vessels, presumably to improve line of sight and increase cargo capacity. Key points to watch out for: 1. Availability of bunkering infrastructure at ports they are destined to serve. 2. Training of crew on board and on shore so they are familiar with handling such fuels. 3. Ability to deal with methane and ammonia slip effectively when combusting both the fuel types. Who do you think will be the next player adopting ammonia as the fuel of the future?

Harukas 300 tower remained the tallest building for 13 years. Fast forward to today, while Harukas 300 has been surpassed in height recently, Damptech is still committed to develop innovative damping solutions to increase safety and resilience for buildings and structures. Project Reflections: - Our work on Harukas 300 improved its seismic safety and structural resilience. - The project showcased our ability to innovate and adapt to challenges. - Special large dampers of 1500-5000 kN were developed for this project. #damptech #rotationfrictiondamper #earthquakeprotection #dampers #vibrationcontrol #damping #passivecontrol #retrofitting #largedampers"
