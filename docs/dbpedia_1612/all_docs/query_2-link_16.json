        "text": "Rising above the Mornington Peninsula, Arthurs Seat State Park is a prominent feature in the landscape of Port Philip Bay. The 314-metre summit provides spectacular views which, on a clear day, can stretch as far as the Melbourne city skyline, the You Yangs and Mount Macedon. For a bird's-eye view, climb aboard the all-weather Arthurs Seat Eagle, a state-of-the-art gondola which soars high above the trees.\n\nThere are plenty of activities to do in the park. From walking, jogging, photography, picnicking and mountain biking. The parkâ€™s most popular attraction is Arthurs Seat summit, where visitors can take in the stunning views while enjoying a picnic or barbecue. Take the pleasant circuit walk to Kings Falls or visit the delightful Seawinds Garden, featuring sculptures by William Ricketts. There are also many walking tracks across the park giving visitors the opportunity to explore and appreciate its wide variety of flora and fauna.\n\nThe park is home to several species of regional importance including the Southern Brown Bandicoot, Koala, Lace Monitor, Southern Emu-wren and Wedge-tailed Eagle.\n\nVisit our all abilities access page to find out about the wide range of facilities available to help people of all abilities enjoy our wonderful parks around the state.\n\nSeawinds Gardens, the Summit Station and the Base Station at Arthurs Seat State Park were assessed for accessibility in July 2021, providing information about the accessibility of these areas and photos.\n\nAssistance dogs are welcome in Parks Victoria parks and reserves. Entry requirements apply for parks and reserves that are usually dog prohibited, such as national parks."
