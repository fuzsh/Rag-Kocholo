        "meta_description": "Natural Bridge is in the western part of Springbrook National Park, part of the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia World Heritage Area.\n\nThe park's Natural Bridge section features a picturesque rock formation, formed by the force of the waterfall over the basalt cave. It is easily accessible from the Nerang-Murwillumbah Road car park. \n\nFollow the easy one-kilometre circuit (walk in a clockwise direction) and descend through the ancient Gondwana rainforest to the Natural Bridge rock arch. Hoop pines emerging from surrounding forests are living relics of the Jurassic Age, 180 million years ago.\n\nDuring the day spot paradise riflebirds, green catbirds, wompoo fruit-doves and rare and threatened species like the cascade tree frog, tusked frog, sooty owl and koala. At night join a guided nocturnal tour to see the resident colony of protected glow-worms and microbats. On summer nights, also see luminous fungi and fireflies.\n\nPart of Cave Creek in the Natural Bridge section is a Restricted Access Area to prevent the risk of injury or death. Swimming in the creek, including within the cave, and access to the creek bank is prohibited. \n\nThere is one camping area in Springbrook National Park called \"The Settlement\" camping ground, perfect for visiting the glow worm caves at night. Remember to be quiet when visiting, the ground can be slippery, smoking and bug repellants inside the cave are prohibited.",
