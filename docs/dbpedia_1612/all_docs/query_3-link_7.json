The US$100 million bridge in Russia's Murmansk region is due for completion next year. Construction began in 1992 and it was originally due to be finished in 2000. The bridge will link military bases to towns on the other side of the bay, shortening journeys by 16km.\n\nWant full article access?\n\nSubscribe to Bd&e to receive your quarterly printed magazines, full access to exclusive content on the website, a fully-searchable digital magazine archive, special discounts on bridge conferences and many other subscriber-only benefits.\n\nJoin our community\n\nOr try before you buy and download an example pdf here\n\nAlready a subscriber?
