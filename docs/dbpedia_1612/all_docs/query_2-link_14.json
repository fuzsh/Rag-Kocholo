        "text": "Connecting With the Communications Team\n\nIt is the goal of our Communications team to provide a service to the media and to ensure their time spent at our properties is as productive as possible. Please contact the Communications team at pr@columbuszoo.org with any additional questions or to make arrangements for onsite coverage.\n\nPrior to Arrival\n\nTo access the organization’s properties, members of the media must connect with the Communications team prior to arrival for special arrangements to be made, including having a required onsite escort available for assistance in navigating the property, potentially answering guests’ questions, and connecting with other team members as appropriate.\n\nAnimal Coverage\n\nWhen covering news pertaining to the animals, it is important to remember that animals are observant, perceptive, and intelligent and possess senses far beyond the capability of humans. They are creatures of habit and can be sensitive to changes in their routine, unfamiliar equipment and people, unusual noises, and excessive commotion of any type. Unlike people, we cannot reassure them with explanations. Because they are wild animals, they can be dangerous and unpredictable when they are exposed to unfamiliar surroundings or changes in their routine.\n\nFor this reason, the Communications team will consult with Animal Care staff (manager level or above) to determine what level of access may be permitted. The Animal Care team may not permit media access if, in their judgment, it would jeopardize the safety, health, and wellbeing of the animals, keepers, or the public. This also aligns with the organization’s policy for animal transports, surgical procedures, quarantine holding, animal births, and maternal bonding, or other unique situations.\n\nBehind the Scenes Access\n\nTypically, behind-the-scenes access to media is not approved to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the staff and animals. However, if it is deemed appropriate for media to have access to non-public areas, Animal Care staff, in conjunction with the Communications team, may determine a safe distance or vantage point from which media can work. Animal staff will reserve the right to restrict the movement of media personnel or to ask them to leave at any time. As a general rule, access to some animals is not permitted in some areas, such as the primates, because of the potential for introduction of illness or disease.\n\nPhoto/Video Provided\n\nWhen media access is not possible, the Communications team may arrange for a staff member to shoot video and/or photos for distribution to the media.\n\nReporting Live\n\nMembers of the media are welcome to conduct live broadcasts at the Columbus Zoo. Locations will be determined by the Communications team based on animal, guest, and employee safety and other factors.\n\nParking\n\nParking arrangements will be made through the Communications team when finalizing details for the media request.\n\nFreelance Writer and Blogger/Vlogger Policy\n\nEach year, the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium is contacted by a number of freelance writers and bloggers/vloggers looking to cover the Columbus Zoo, The Wilds or Zoombezi Bay on their various media platforms. We would like to consider any and all media requests that would be mutually beneficial.\n\nIf you have an interesting story or topic in mind, tell us about it. Please submit a written proposal no less than five business days prior to your proposed visit to pr@columbuszoo.org.\n\nYour proposal should include:\n\nStory topics for an article or blog/vlog posts that would be appropriate in featuring the Columbus Zoo, The Wilds or Zoombezi Bay. (sample topics include: wildlife, travel, family fun)\n\nA summary about your publication or blog/vlog that includes the target audience and the demographics you reach\n\nLinks to your articles or blog/vlog posts pertaining to how our entities would be featured\n\nStatistics of your followers broken down by platform (i.e., subscribers for your publication or blog/vlog as well as followers on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram etc.)\n\nDate(s) your story/post will likely be published\n\nComplimentary Tickets\n\nShould your story idea or blog post be deemed mutually beneficial for both parties, the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium staff will provide up to four complimentary admission tickets to either the Columbus Zoo, The Wilds or Zoombezi Bay. Tickets will be provided no more than once in a 12-month period per writer/blogger/vlogger. Other requests for your visit should be included within your proposal for consideration.\n\nLocation Filming Policy\n\nWe are pleased to assist photography and filming projects in conjunction with our organization’s mission of Empowering People.
