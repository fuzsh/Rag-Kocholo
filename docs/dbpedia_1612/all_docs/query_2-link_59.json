        "text": "We have visited Australia twice and love the country.\n\nOn our first trip, we took a cruise \"Over the Top\" of the country, from Perth, stopping in several ports on the north and west coast of Australia and two days in Bali, Indonesia. Darwin is interesting, but unless you are on a cruise, not sure it is worth flying there.\n\nSpend a few days in the Perth area, also Cairns (Great Barrier Reef), Brisbane and Sydney.\n\nOn our second trip, we again visited Sydney, as well as Melbourne. From Melbourne we visited local vineyards and did a tour of the Great Ocean Road and Philip Island were the small penguins come in at nightfall (both are amazing).\n\nIf you have a month, you can see quite a lot. Sydney for some days, as well as a day trip to the Blue Mountains. Be sure to do a Harbor Cruise, climb the bridge piles of the famous Sydney Harbor Bridge. See the zoo and visit Bondi Beach and the Botanical Gardens. Also, there are some great museums to see in Sydney.\n\nDo Melbourne, nearby wineries, The Great Ocean Road and Phillip Island.\n\nAlso, Cairns and if you can the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nWe didn't go to Tasmania, but you might spend a few days there.\n\nIt is a huge country and flying from Sydney to Perth is a five hour flight, like flying from Washington, DC to LA.\n\nBetween 2019 and lock-down, I had 3 trips to Australia combining business and pleasure. I flew in and out and between various cities including Canberra, Brisbane, Cairns, Sydney and Melbourne. Connections were easy and multiple in my experience then and not unreasonably priced as I recall. I used Uber frequently, but I would check with TripAdvisor if that situation is still as convenient - it has changed somewhat in my US experience post-Covid, perhaps in Australia also.\n\nIf you are looking at Cairns, also look into Port Douglas. I stayed in both locations and took day trips to the Daintree rainforest from Port Douglas, Hartley's Crocodiles (which sounds terribly touristy but was a highlight), and a Great Barrier Reef snorkeling trip. From Cairns, I took another GBR trip, Kuranda, Atherton Tablelands. I was solo and didn't want to rent a car. When I traveled there were many day trips or shuttles to these areas. Cairns Botanic Garden and aquarium are good if you have time.\n\nRe the GBR - I have been scuba and snorkeling since the 1980's. I have to say that the GBR was a bit disappointing - sadly, it is bleaching. The tour companies won't tell you this, so be sure to pick a tour company whose schedule and activities are of general interest and maybe one with several different sites. There are many companies, I think most are fine. Do expect that you might get sea sick, even if not normally subject to this. I had Bonine and was fine, but many others were not - a lot of sickness. I brought that from the US at my MD's suggestion. It is over the counter, but not sold in Australia. (although I'm sure Aussies have other seasick meds)\n\nI preferred Melbourne to Sydney. Others are the reverse.\n\nI enjoyed the government buildings, botanic garden, and museums in Canberra, but that may be a specific interest. Without knowing your particular interests, It is hard to suggest activities or areas of the countries. Could you indicate the types of activities or sites or interests you have?\n\nI've seen a number of the animal zoos and shelters if you like that sort of thing. I can maybe give feedback on some in you find any of possible interest.\n\nCaveat with all of this - situations, especially transport, may be different post-Covid. I found TripAdvisor to be the best source for current info and ideas of what I might most enjoy for the areas I was able to visit. I agree, the guidebooks can quickly be overwhelming.\n\n@ Jill\n\nFor guided tours try https://www.aatkings.com/. Not my preferred method of travel but have seen the company’s coaches around. Spent last 4 weeks in West Australia, Murchison and Pilbara, and noticed a few coaches around for the the spring wildflowers. Was a rather disappointing subdued season. Maybe something suitable for you in their eastern state's itineraries.\n\nAlso, https://www.bunniktours.com.au/our-team. Dennis is well known for his YouTube commentary on Airlines, particularly top end products.\n\nAdding to Tintaldra’s top advice. Eastern state schools return from summer holidays circa 1st Feb. Fares tend to be at peak around this time. The grey-headed and the blue rinse set tend to start taking their domestic trips around this time.\n\nNorth of Tropic of Capricorn, Top End, is monsoon/cyclone season until end of March. Eastern States are hot and humid. Western and southern continent are desert type conditions hot and dry. I enjoy both and would never let them deter me from enjoying the delights of nature. Have always viewed whatever weather is thrown up as part of the experience. Am not a person who needs air-conditioning.\n\nIn Melbourne for art and other museum interests https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/. General entry is free, though some special exhibits may have a fee. Apparently, the building dimensions are the same as Noah’s Ark. Built on the land of the traditional owners, Wurundjeri Woi-Wurrung People. I try and visit one a year. It is a good one. Planning on this Thursday for International Collection Highlights and the Australian Collection Highlights as I pass through.\n\nFor other museums in Melbourne try https://museumsvictoria.com.au/melbournemuseum/.\n\nAs Ordtraveler has noted, GBR is being degraded by global warming, still a wonder of the planet. Hope we all can fix things. Stumbled on a wonderful coral spawning a few years ago.\n\nRegards Ron\n\nThe GBR is indeed a wonder, and sadly suffers from both bleaching/climate change (as do all coral reefs worldwide - as a longtime scuba diver, it’s hard to not see a lot of that, nearly everywhere) and the GBR also suffers from over-tourism. If you’re going to the GBR on a day-trip (as most do) you’ll see it at its worst (just like almost every popular “attraction” in the world). The good news is that parts of the GBR are still (relatively) vibrant and healthy. The bad news is that you would need to be dedicated enough to put in some time/effort/money to get there to see those parts. I did it on a week-long scuba live-aboard dive boat, and once we get beyond convenient “snorkel day trip” distance from Cairns, things improved dramatically.\n\nIt’s the eternal dilemma of convenience/cost/time/the mass tourism industry. If you’re OK with a “Pretty Good Barrier Reef” experience, plenty of people are perfectly happy with the half-day snorkel experience from Cairns (many of those happy customers have never seen a healthy tropical coral reef, so don’t have much of a baseline for context). To have a “Great” experience worthy of the name, it may be worth it to go further out where the GBR still lives up to its moniker - but that takes time, money and effort, and most don’t/can’t/choose not to go there.\n\nOn my next Australia trip, I’m torn between Tasmania and Western Australia. Big country, so much to see, hard choices.\n\nOn Sydney. It has been suggested already to head to the Blue Mountains. I have always stayed in the Blue Mountains rather than Sydney itself (not a fan of big crowded cities). Trains will take you up there from the city. Katoomba is the number one destination and for good reason. I have usually stayed out a bit in cabins at the Blackheath Hol.Park. Bit quieter than Katoomba. Equally spectacular if you wander down to the Govetts Leap area. If you enjoy nature and stunning scenery the Blue Mountains have it in spades.\n\nI am a Victorian.\n\nVictoria is a smaller state than most but is very diverse. We have A grade coastal scenery, beaches, rainforest and many other forests, great alpine country and sub alpine country, lakes, rivers, deserts, farmlands and wineries. A huge capital city (Melbourne) lots of great historic towns. Pretty much got the lot and it is more accessible than in any of the other states.\n\nYou can get to or close to most of the top sights using public transport.\n\nNot sure what your really looking for so I will just give you some of my faves and you can look them up if you are interested.\n\nHeading up my way by train from Melbourne you pass through Macedon at the foot of Mt Macedon. Beautiful forests and gardens. Then Castlemaine, historic gold town, not far from another beautiful historic town Maldon.\n\nThen my regions big smoke Bendigo. Impressive architecture as this was a big gold mining town in the mid 19th C.\n\nFrom Bendigo PT will take you north to the historic river port town of Echuca. Take a paddle steamer ride.\n\nIf you fancy a desert type experience you could head further NW up toward Mildura.\n\nWest from Melbourne you will reach another historic gold mining town Ballarat, now like Bendigo a large regional city.\n\nFurther on you can reach Halls Gap at the foot of the Grampians mountain range. Might be busy in January. A bit further out is Dunkeld. Usually quieter but in an equally beautiful setting below the Grampians.\n\nS.West through Geelong you can pick up the Great Ocean Road. This winds through magnificent rainforest and stunning coastal scenery through to the city of Warrnambool. You like museums? The Maritime museum at Warrnambool is worth a visit.\n\nKeep Heading west you reach the impossibly gorgeous town of Port Fairy. Even further west is Portland, industrial (aluminium) but also beautiful and historic. Nearby Cape Bridgewater is a gem.\n\nContinuing further west takes you across the border to South Australia. The town of Mt Gambier is full of caves, lakes, sinkholes and extinct volcanoes.\n\nNE by PT you can reach the tourist magnet town of Bright at the foot of the Australian Alps. Across Tawonga Gap is the less tourist Mt Beauty.\n\nFrom Bright you can access one of my favourite mountains Mt Buffalo. It is pretty spectacular.\n\nYou can also head out to lovely little Harrietville and access Mt Hotham one of our major skifields in winter. The Alps are quite stunning in summer (no snow though). You can hike from Harrietville up to Mt Feathertop (2d highest in Vic). I have over 40 visits so I do rate it. Not sure if that's your cup of tea though.\n\nFrom Mt Beauty you can hike Vic peak number one Mt Bogong. Neither Feather or Bogong have vehicle access or any mechanical aids.\n\nYou can reach Phillip Island (SE of Melbourne) by PT with a bit of effort. Phillip Island is home to the famous Fairy Penguin Parade.\n\nFurther east is one of the jewels of Aussie National Parks in Wilson's Promontory NP. It is more of a challenge to access by PT however.\n\nCloser to Melbourne. Healesville and the Yarra Valley are beautiful areas. Also the Mornington Peninsula and Western Port Bay. Summer school holidays though so expect big crowds.\n\nMelbourne's lungs are the beautiful Dandenong Ranges, stunning forest not too far from the city.\n\nI will post some further stuff on Melbourne itself and also Tasmania (if you are interested).\n\nTasmania.\n\nI am no great expert just somebody who has enjoyed a number of visits. Tassie Devil/Ron probably has more knowledge.\n\nSo I will just go off my memory and experiences, this hopefully gives you some reference points to search further.\n\nHobart is the capital and usually arrival point.\n\nA beautiful little city at the base of 1200 metre high Mt Wellington.\n\nConstitution Dock and Battery Point are worth a visit.\n\nQuite a few museums and galleries.\n\nMONA is the big ticket gallery.\n\nOne smaller museum we found by accident and enjoyed was the Female Factory Museum near the iconic Cascades Brewery.\n\nFor me it is a formality that I will end up on top of Mt Wellington if I am visiting Hobart.\n\nSpectacular views, the drive up is awesome (just 22 km from downtown Hobart). I have only scratched the surface with the hiking up there but it is a hikers paradise.\n\nNot too far away from Hobart is the historic town of Richmond, absolutely worth a good explore.\n\nPort Arthur is about as close to being a must see as I can come up with. This is perhaps the best piece of convict history in Australia. Just be respectful of the fact a modern day atrocity oc urged there, look it up rather than mentioning it during your visit. Recent enough to still be quite raw with locals.\n\nThe Tasman National Park area has a lot of points of interest. I haven't but you can book a boat trip around Tasman Bay.\n\nIn a different direction is Mount Field N.P. a beautiful area, Russell Falls is one of the most photographed falls in Tassie.\n\nWe took a beautiful drive out to Strathgordon and the Gordon Dam via Lake Pedder.\n\nTarraleah and Waddamana are 2 interesting spots relating to the Hydro system.\n\nNear the nice town of Deloraine we visited the caves at Mole Creek (guided tour). Also enjoyed an easy hike near Mole Creek to the spectacular Alum Cliffs.\n\nQueenstown is a fascinating place. The natural environment was obliterated by copper mining leaving a moonscape. Nature is slowly winning the battle these days.\n\nNot too far from Queenstown are 2 interesting towns Strahan and Zeehan. There is tourist railway from Queenstown but I haven't ridden it.\n\nThe eastern side of Tassie is pretty impressive.\n\nBay of Fires, Binalong Bay, Saint Helens, Bicheno and the stunning Freycinet N.P great coastal scenery.\n\nI haven't been to Maria Is. but it sits atop my to do list next time I visit Tassie.\n\nTassies 2d biggest city is Launceston.\n\nI have mostly just passed through on my way to other places. However my wife and I did enjoy a big afternoon exploring the impressive Cataract Gorge just out of town. I feel a need to spend a bit more time in Launceston.\n\nMy last visit to Tassie was focused on Bruny Island.\n\nA great place, we stayed at Adventure Bay. A few highlights: Fluted Cape, Cloudy Bay, The Neck and perhaps number one highlight was meeting up with a white Bennett's Wallaby while out running.\n\nI have been fortunate enough to do 2 of Tassie's most iconic multiday hikes, Cradle Mountain Overland Track and the pretty wild South Coast Track.\n\nThe start of Cradle and the finish at Lake St Clair are accessible to those who aren't wanting to do the week long hike.\n\nThe start of South Coast requires a light plane trip to the sand Meleleuca airstrip then a week-long hike comes out at Cockle Creek where a bus can pick you up at the most southerly road in Australia.\n\nPretty sure that isn't on your agenda though JILL.\n\nFlying from Melbourne to Hobart (or Launceston) takes less than an hour.\n\nHaving been to Australia several times, once for several months, I can assure you that you will have a marvelous experience. A great country and wonderful people. There is so much to see, you can easily fill a month. As others have noted, it is a huge country, roughly the same size as our 48 contiguous states.\n\nOthers have already noted so many great sites to see, and I don’t intend to repeat what has already been suggested. The cities are beautiful, affording many great opportunities. One site that I think Americans often overlook, though, is Tasmania. It’s an easy flight from either Sydney or Melbourne to Hobart or Launceston. Being from upstate New York, I found the topography of Tasmania reminiscent of the northeast US. Somewhat mountainous and green and lush. Quite a change from most of “mainland” Australia. Hobart and Launceston, while certainly not rivaling the big cities, are nonetheless interesting with much to offer. I would also recommend a visit to Cradle Mountain, ideally with an overnight stay. In Hobart, Port Arthur is well worth a visit, one of the early penal sites for prisoners being sent from England.\n\nSome of my thoughts on Tasmania and Western Australia.\n\n@David of Seattle. My answer is Western Australia. Home of all Sandgropers. It occupies one-third of the continent and provides close to 50% of Australia’s export income. My mates and I have significant investments and interest in mining.\n\nOn GBR, I presume, that like Sir David you were able to go to the outer reef and the start of the Coral Sea. A real privilege. Let us hope it remains exclusive and does not suffer like the closer to mainland parts of the reef have.\n\nOn the Australian west coast 1200 km north of Perth is Ningaloo Reef, and Ningaloo Coast, a world heritage listed location. For intrepid divers, a wonderful location to experience Indian Ocean Coral, whale sharks and humpbacks migrating to and from the Antarctic. Plenty of information can be found on the internet. Its isolation keeps most away. Signs of coral bleaching from climate change causing increasing water temperatures are starting to show. Not a cheap or easy place to get to. Last century my mates and I were able to drive up and camp on the beach during our university breaks. With a dinghy we could venture out and enjoy these delights. Gets your heart pumping. 160+ bpm. Tightly controlled now, and rightly so.\n\nI am told that spectacular sponges and corals are in and around Ashmore Reef Marine Park and it is virtually unknown outside Australia. https://parksaustralia.gov.au/marine/parks/north-west/ashmore-reef/. Probably need to put your hands on a 25-30 metre sailing yacht to get there. Not recommended for cyclone season.\n\nAround 4 hours’ drive south of Perth is my hideaway in the idyllic vineyards of Margaret River and the world renown surfing haunt of Yallingup. Stopped over for a few days last weekend. Nic Cage has been entertaining the locals as he and crew film his latest undertaking “The Surfer.” I had no idea he was part of the Coppola dynasty. Generously donated $5k to the Perth Telethon which raised nearly $80m for the leading Australian children’s research hospital. Big accolade to him as this is not his country.\n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-12660635/Nicolas-Cage-family-visit.html\n\nThis region is starting to become too popular for my liking. The local airport has just had around $90 million invested to take A330 and perhaps other international class e aircraft. A350 & 787 etc.\n\nA myriad of other stuff but that will do.\n\n@ Jill. Tasmania. Another nice summary by Tintaldra.\n\nTourism Tasmania. https://www.discovertasmania.com.au/. Best place to start. I hope the sustainability theme comes through. Maureen Wheeler of Lonely Planet fame served as a director 2000-2006.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3dYjV1wqV0&t=18s\n\nhttps://www.dailymotion.com/video/x8ahotf Sir David Attenborough’s Tasmania.\n\nI choose to live here for part of the year because it is isolated from the major trouble spots of the world, a place to minimise the effects of global warming and is pristine and lightly populated. For the most part people living here love this tin pot little island. Tourists who come tend to be looking for a unique experience and have a respect for the natural environment.\n\nRegards\n\nRon\n\nTo add more impressions about visiting Tasmania & Melbourne --\n\nI stayed in Tasmania in Aug 2014 as a solo traveler, mid50's single female from the USA, rented a car and drove more in 5 days than what most Tasmanians usually do (told to me by one person who I met there). I'm fairly certain that I drove at least 1000 kilometers in those 5 days.\n\nI had been warned by another friend from the US that if any damage is done to the rental car, expect a bill of $2500 Aus minimum. I did have a mishap parallel parking in Richmond, yet this was damage to the tire hubcap and not to the car so I was very lucky. I didn't find it troubling to drive on the opposite side from what we do here in the US. I did drive mostly during the day and not during morning / evening going to work times -- at least not for long distances.\n\nHere are some of the specifics that I remember from nearly 9 years ago.\n\nHobart -- Salamanca Market on Saturdays -- fantastic shopping experience, go early to find car parking anywhere close without requiring a lot of walking; great to browse. I still have the hand-painted silk scarves bought there.\n\nPort Arthur - definitely worth it; I went on the twilight park ranger tour which focused on ghost stories. I echo a previous poster's sentiments about being sensitive to the recent-ish incident.\n\nStrahan -- I had to visit as a very good friend's last name is Strachan (when did the town change its name?). It took awhile to flag down a passing motorist who could take a picture of me in front of the town sign. (A selfie wasn't possible at the time.) I think that there was a museum with an interesting tourist-oriented show to explain the local history.\n\nCataract Falls -- although outside the city limits, it was still in a residential area (at least the location of the car park was). Strong memory of peacocks preening while they were sitting on stone walls bordering the yards of the nearby houses.\n\nSmall towns of Ross, Oatlands, and Richmond very interesting with the old cemeteries\n\nThe drive from Strahan back to Rt 1 (if I'm remembering this correctly) was through deep canyons with several tight switchbacks and little fencing on the side of the road. It was harrowing yet very impressive.\n\nGorgeous scenery in Tasmania. I didn't hike nor visit any specific national park so I have no helpful info for those activities.\n\nRe: Melbourne -- I used it as the transition to/from Tasmania in between flying to/from Kuala Lumpur & Singapore (it was a complicated overall 2-week itinerary). If any problems, I didn't want to worry about making connections for the longer flights to/from Singapore & Kuala Lumpur to the US. Tasmania was my primary vacation destination for the 2-week trip although the trip reason was a convention in KL. I took a bus tour one day to get an overview of Melbourne -- really liked the Shrine of Remembrance and the botanical gardens, and the architecture of buildings seen on the tour. I stayed nearer to the airport which required extra effort to get downtown for sightseeing, yet it was possible via the trams. The British actor David Suchet was in town yet I hadn't thought about checking for possible theater opportunities so I missed seeing him, yet if I ever were to meet him in person, I could say that we were in Melbourne at the same time!"
