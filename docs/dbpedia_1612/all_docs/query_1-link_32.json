On one hand, this video reminds me of the quote — “Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.” From early school experiences to adult life, people are often labelled. At times quite harshly. And rarely do we understand enough to seek the environment where we can shine. And workplaces rarely find the hidden talent and special skills of people. We label success or failure, like or dislike, very quickly. Kids today learn at an early age to focus on making it in the world. What does it really entail? it’s not always easy to realize that we may have a path suitable for our unique abilities. I’m sure the “square” in this video couldn’t initially see that it too could roll along a path, just like a wheel. An “innovative path” may accelerate our strength, like the square, to move along versus being stuck. We often face obstacles that seem insurmountable, but with a bit of ingenuity, we can find ways to navigate through them. Each problem can be looked at from a different perspective. Hope we all find the ‘path’, the one that lets you shine and succeed with what you are good at. :) Video source: Messymath #inspiring #motivation #science #innovation #mindset\n\nWe crave for home, away from home. Paradoxically. And somehow discovering a place that feels familiar makes us immensely happy. The 𝐈𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐚 𝐇𝐨𝐮𝐬𝐞 at Paris Olympics did an awesome job of creating this slice of home away from home! It's the first-ever country house for India at the Olympic Games! Amidst the competition and cheers at Olympics, it has been huge hit. With great food, amazing decor, many cultural programs, and even a henna corner — it is a little slice of home for global visitors of all nationalities. And Indian champions performances broadcast on a giant screen! Located at Parc de la Villette, just 15 km from the Eiffel Tower, the India House resembles a mesmerizing traditional haveli. Thoughtfully curated and with attention to exquisite details, I was very impressed. While there, I was part of the Dream Sports dedication and support of Indian athletes. And learnt about Karnam Malleswari, India's first woman to win an Olympic medal. Hearing her speak about her journey in weightlifting and her passion for putting India in the global sports arena was truly inspiring. The atmosphere here is filled with passionate fans supporting our athletes, volunteers displaying Indian hospitality, and fans who have traveled to Paris to cheer on their loved ones. With the possibility of India hosting the 2036 Olympics, initiatives like this go a long way in cultural diplomacy. I expect more of everything in future Olympics, more athletes, more medals, more fans! Harsh Jain Bhavit Sheth Puneet Kumar #TeamIndia #Paris2024 #Olympics #IndiaHouse #Inspiring\n\nSilver!! Watching it live was such a nail-biting experience — the hope, the disappointment, The thrill, and the energy at the stadium! Neeraj Chopra did India proud at the Olympics in the men’s javelin throw. A small but enthusiastic contingent from India cheered him on, sharing in his hopes and pride. And to be here, live in Paris, what an event! His victory should inspire other athletes and pave the way for them to pursue their dreams. The pressure is always immense, path to the championship is all about mental strength, and being calm in a storm. Neeraj's journey has been nothing short of inspiring. From a small village to the world stage, he's conquered it all. His dedication, his hard work, his talent: it's a perfect combination. Start believing. This is how champions are made. Congratulations, Neeraj! I was proud to watch you live. #Paris2024 #Olympics #India #inspiration #TeamIndia\n\nCan the world's biggest stages become its greenest? The 2024 Olympics suggests yes. These Games are setting a groundbreaking precedent for sustainability in global sporting events, aiming to be the most eco-friendly Games in history. Did you know that six new stadiums were built before the London 2012 Games? And Rio built 10 permanent new sites and seven temporary ones before hosting in 2016? In contrast, of the 35 stadiums housing events in Paris, only two are new and purpose-built — an aquatics center and an arena for badminton and rhythmic gymnastics. The Aquatics Centre at these Games features the biggest hanging roof in the world, made entirely from wood. On this, sits a giant solar farm, providing enough energy for the entire building. Additionally, all the furniture inside- restaurants, bars, and entrances, is made from wood waste from the construction site and other nearby demolition sites. But, wood isn’t the only sustainable highlight of the Olympics! In just over 2 years, local authorities expanded the city’s network of bicycle paths by 34 miles, making Paris the first fully bicycle-accessible host of the Games. Renewable energy usage is another cornerstone of Paris 2024’s sustainability initiatives. The Games are powered largely by solar and wind energy, significantly reducing reliance on fossil fuels. It’s not just about one or two green initiatives, but a comprehensive strategy that touches every aspect. From the recycled materials in construction, to the solar-powered venues — every aspect of this Olympics reflects a commitment to environmental responsibility. Here's a snippet of interesting sustainable initiatives from this Olympics. #Paris2024 #Olympics #sustainability #sports #technology\n\n‘The Elephant Whisperers’ made waves when it won the Oscar for Best Documentary Short Film in 2022. It was a beautiful tribute to the sensitive bond between mahout and hathi, a symbiotic relationship that goes back thousands of years. Elephants have been part of our history, whether worshipped in temples or forming a formidable presence on battlefields. The legendary Carthaginian general Hannibal used 37 elephants to guide his army through the Alps, an unprecedented feat of military valour. Only one elephant would survive the war: Hannibal's own elephant, Surus. Closer home, Ashoka was supposed to have had more than 9,000 war elephants. I was reminded of these old stories when 71-year-old Parbati Barua was awarded this year's Padma Shri. She is one of the world's few female mahouts, sharing a profound, almost mystical connection with these gentle giants. From the age of 14, Parbati has been out in the wild, working with wild elephants in the forests of Assam, trained by her father. Female mahouts are rare — cultural norms and gender stereotypes mean there have been only a few female mahouts over the years. But for Parbati, there was never any question of working anywhere else but with her beloved elephants. Parbati has worked with governments to create elephant conservation policies. She helps forest rangers tackle rogue tuskers, and is the one they call when a herd of elephants loses its way. Her story has been immortalised in Mark Shand's book Queen of the Elephants and a BBC documentary of the same name, showcasing her life and work to a global audience. Parbati's efforts have been crucial in reducing human-elephant conflicts and building more awareness around conservation and sustainability in India. Her story and life work show us that in any walk of life, in any strata of society, even if there is just one individual with courage, passion, and conviction, you can always override convention. Trailblazers like her inspire and lay new roads for the rest to follow. This post is a part of a series on India's unsung women heroes.

They showcase the best of brand influence, where the brand becomes generic vocabulary, influencing our everyday culture and markets. This process is known as \"genericisation\" or \"proprietary eponyms.” It represents both — a triumph of branding, and a potential trademark challenge. Take Google, for instance. \"To google\" is now synonymous with searching the internet. Google has even sent cease-and-desist letters to media outlets using \"Google\" as a generic verb to protect its trademark. You see, the journey from brand to verb is no small feat. It requires a combination of superior product performance, strategic marketing, and often, pioneering innovation. Here are some historical examples with interesting facts: – 𝐗𝐞𝐫𝐨𝐱: Xerox’s photocopying tech was so revolutionary that \"xerox\" became a verb for photocopying. Fun fact: Xerox comes from xerography, i.e. Greek for dry writing. – 𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐠𝐥𝐞: Launched in 1998, Google quickly became the top search engine. By 2006, \"google\" was in the Oxford English Dictionary as a verb. The name \"Google\" is a twist on \"googol,\" a 1 followed by 100 zeros. – 𝐏𝐡𝐨𝐭𝐨𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐩: Adobe’s image editing software led to \"photoshopping\" as shorthand for digital image manipulation. – 𝐒𝐤𝐲𝐩𝐞: Before Zoom took over, \"skyping\" was the term for video calling. Skype comes from \"Sky peer-to-peer,\" shortened to Skyper and finally to Skype. Today, we witness this phenomenon continuing with newer technologies. We \"Zoom\" instead of just joining a video call, \"Instagram\" our photos, and “Uber” our travels. 𝘈 𝘒𝘰𝘥𝘢𝘬 𝘔𝘰𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘈 𝘰𝘯𝘦𝘴𝘪𝘦 𝘡𝘪𝘱𝘱𝘦𝘳 𝘞𝘪𝘯𝘥𝘣𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘬𝘦𝘳 𝘌𝘴𝘤𝘢𝘭𝘢𝘵𝘰𝘳 𝘉𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘈𝘪𝘥 𝘛𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘮𝘰𝘴 𝘝𝘦𝘭𝘤𝘳𝘰 The list can go on. Many of these were trademarks once owned by companies that have become everyday words. These brands have achieved incredible recognition and loyalty and surpassed traditional marketing metrics. Becoming a verb is great, but it's a double-edged sword. While it shows unparalleled success and cultural relevance, it can also lead to trademark dilution. Aspirin, Escalator, and Thermos and others lost their trademark protection because they became generic terms? As technology evolves, new opportunities arise for brands to become part of our language. What company names might become the verbs of tomorrow? Image source: The New York Times #branding #culture #language #business #growth\n\nOwning assets was a moat. Well. This would’ve been true decades ago, but not anymore. In the last couple of decades, the notion of shared economy versus ownership has soared. Even the clothes we wear don't need to be owned! Traditional business models are being turned upside down. New business models and humongous companies are emerging by rethinking old ways. Think about this: some of the biggest companies today don't even own what they sell. In the past, owning assets was key to success. Factories, fleets, storefronts — these were the hallmarks of big business. But today, connection with customers, influencer marketing, and access matter more. Uber changed the way we move without owning a vehicle. Social platforms profit, not creating any of their own content, by allowing us to share our stories. E-commerce connects buyers and sellers without holding stock. Airbnb lets us stay in homes worldwide without owning any property. These companies show us the power of network economy and platforms that connect supply and demand in ways unthinkable in the past. A significant shift in these shared models is the trust that the platform creates to use assets not owned by us. They connect people, services, and products. They create ecosystems that thrive on sharing and collaboration. The possibilities of a fundamental shift in rethinking ownership is socially beneficial. With shared models, a wider population can access services or products that were not affordable in the ownership model. I think it creates this more equitable society. What do you think?

The firsts are always special. As I was cleaning boxes untouched for years, I saw the album, and I was instantly transported to a time three decades ago. I was wrapped up in nostalgia. All thanks to mobile, data, and cloud tech, we can click a lot more photos today and store them too. But we rarely take the time to go back to them. Today, photos are more about instant gratification. Most of us are lethargic about organising them, even though there are a plethora of tools. Like, how big is your Google Photos storage? As of the latest available data, Google Photos has over 4 billion users and a massive scale of operations, with users uploading more than 28 billion photos and videos each week. Today, Google One pricing starts at approximately $2 per month for 100GB of storage, with options extending up to 2TB and more for a higher amount. My handmade album would have barely cost $5 to $10, but it is a keepsake for a lifetime. But more importantly, it brings me so much joy to just sit and view the memories that immediately transport me back in time. I made this album in the last month of pregnancy, a time well spent. I can still recall the anticipation and love with which I made this album. Digital can give short-term gratification but there is still a place in our life for things made by hand, made with love, like this album which is something more than the photos it holds. We are all sitting on a mountain of digital waste, with no hope of how to clean it up. Is there a place where digital can co-exist with analog? Will humanity be bothered to create analog entities anymore? Or is the analog future gone? I am so glad for the many bits and pieces of analog that surround my life. Pour in your thoughts. #digital #memories #photography #technology #storage\n\nOne. This is the number of representatives India had at the Paris Olympics in 1900! And today? 112 Indian athletes competing in 69 medal events across 16 sports at the Paris 2024 Olympics. According to the International Olympic Committee (IOC), India has sent its largest-ever contingent of athletes to Paris, a sign of our country’s increasing focus on athletic development. It’s incredible how far we have come! No doubt, this means more Indian faces inspiring future generations and showcasing the country's expanding sporting talent pool. And the medals are starting to roll in! The brilliance of Manu Bhaker, etching her name in history as the first Indian to win two medals in a single Olympics post-Independence, is just one example. Bhaker and Sarabjot Singh also clinched another bronze in the 10m air pistol mixed team shooting event. And amidst intense competition, shooter Swapnil Kusale bagged a bronze medal in the 50m Rifle 3P event, India’s third medal at the Games. But they are not alone. We have so many talented athletes across different sports. Neeraj Chopra, the reigning Olympic champion in javelin throw, aims to defend his title, while Lakshay Sen reaches men’s badminton semi-finals in a historic first. Wrestlers are eyeing gold, and the Indian hockey teams are vying for a return to the podium. Every victory, every near miss, fuels the nation's collective spirit, proving that India can compete and win at the highest level. The success of these athletes inspires young girls and boys to dream, further strengthening our future talent. As the Games continue, there will be moments of triumph and heartbreak, records broken and dreams chased. And while medals are important, it's the journey that counts. Every Indian athlete on that field, court, or track is a hero to me. But one thing is certain — the world is taking notice of India and the future of Indian sports is bright. The upcoming generations will take the baton and continue this exciting journey. And who knows, perhaps India will also host the Olympics soon. Wouldn’t that be something? India, with its billion-plus fans, hosting the world's biggest sporting event? It's a big dream, sure, but with the way things are going, it doesn't seem so impossible. The world is watching. And India is ready to shine! Video source: Olympics Youtube Channnel #ParisOlympics #India #sports #Olympics #Paris2024\n\nDoes talent guarantee success? When you think of high achievers, do you also think of them as having extraordinary talent or IQ? While we may assume that, life doesn't really operate that way. talent alone isn't the key to success. It's effort and perseverance that truly make the difference. Take those who belong to the high IQ Mensa Club. Mensa has about 150,000 members from different age groups from over 90 countries now. Members qualify after obtaining a score on a standard IQ test that puts them in the upper 2% of the general population. You might think that those who are already gifted with such intelligence may also go on to become super-achievers. Not so. Research from the Yale School of Management and other studies suggests that IQ tests measure only a part of cognitive abilities and are not comprehensive predictors of success. Many highly intelligent individuals struggle with everyday decision-making and rational thinking. The Terman Study of the Gifted followed high-IQ individuals over decades and found that many had successful academic or professional lives, but it wasn't a guarantee, indicating that factors beyond IQ influence success. Talent needs direction. Without a clear purpose, even the most gifted individuals can flounder. It's not just about having the ability; it's about knowing what to do with it and having a burning purpose to put your intelligence to work. Think of many gifted musicians, actors, or even athletes. Their prodigious talent and early promise somehow don't sustain in the process of daily pressures to stay at the top. Talent is great, yes. But beyond talent, success is often led by purpose and grit. While we envy those who seem to flow with talent, we should learn from those who refuse to give up, who summon resilience where defeat looms, and who somehow doggedly fight the good fight, day in and day out. Talent can show you potential. Purpose and perseverance can show you the outcome. In my own journey, I have seen that effort often outshines talent. 𝐄𝐟𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐭 𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐧𝐭: While talent can give you a head start, it's effort that takes you across the finish line. 𝐏𝐮𝐫𝐩𝐨𝐬𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐝𝐢𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Channel your talents toward a meaningful goal. 𝐋𝐢𝐟𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐧𝐠 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠: Stay curious and committed to continuous improvement. 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐬𝐮𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭 𝐧𝐞𝐭𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐬: Leverage the power of your community and support systems. It counterbalances the highs and lows. Who in your life exemplifies the power of effort over talent? #personaldevelopment #motivation #productivity #talent #tools"
