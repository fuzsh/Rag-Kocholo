        "text": "Weather is fickle. With climate change, even more so. I stay in Bangalore—the weather here is quite pleasant and consistent compared to most parts of India. Of course, if you know any long-timer of this city, you will hear them lament how just a few decades back this city was known as the \"Garden City\" with lush tree cover, now dwindling. Anyone who lives in this city, it’s most likely that the number one thing they like here is the 𝘸𝘦𝘢𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘳 and the number one thing they dislike is the 𝘵𝘳𝘢𝘧𝘧𝘪𝘤. On these topics, they will keep going on and on endlessly! Even as cities across the country swelter under temperatures exceeding 40°C, Bangalore often remains in the comfortable range of mid-20s to low 30s. On July 19th, 2024, Bangalore recorded a chilly 23.8°C, the coldest day of the year so far in this “Garden City”. Bangalore sits high up on the Deccan Plateau, about 900 meters above sea level. That elevation is key—it keeps the city cooler than most, letting it catch winds from the Arabian sea that other places miss. An offshore trough is like a dip or valley in the air pressure over the ocean, near the coast. This trough channeled cool, moist air from the Arabian Sea into the interior regions of Karnataka reaching Bangalore. I found this very interesting explainer video below that shows how. No place is completely immune to the planet’s changing climate. The entire world will continue to face extreme weather events, driven by climate change. This year marks the third consecutive year of severe heatwaves across India, and studies show that these heatwaves are becoming more intense and longer-lasting. In fact, climate change has made such extreme heat events more likely than in the past. As I enjoy Bangalore's cool breeze, even in the midst of a warming world, it reminds me of how lucky we are in this city. But this cool breeze also whispers a quiet warning—weather is changing everywhere. It is time to cherish what we have but work towards how we can protect it, not just for ourselves, but for the generations to come.

Driving, especially heavy vehicles, was one of those. But I recently read about a woman who has crushed those stereotypes, and driven through every barrier society tried to place before her! A 73-year-old woman named Radhamani Amma, affectionately known as Maniamma or \"Driver Amma,\" boasts of having licenses to drive 11 classes of vehicles: Jaguar F-TYPE, lorries, buses, JCB cranes, trailers, forklifts, road rollers, two-wheelers, and even autos — she can drive them all! It all started four decades ago, in 1981 when women drivers were a rarity. Her husband ran a driving school called A-Z Driving School in Kochi in the 1970s. After he died in 2004, Radhamani took over. She is also the first in Kerala to start a training institute for obtaining a license to drive heavy vehicles. Even today, women hold only about 1% of commercial driving licenses in India. Radhamani Amma’s journey isn’t just about her love for driving. It’s about what she represents. Role models like her show us that limits are only in our minds. Living proof that with enough grit and determination, you can challenge and rewrite the rules. At 73, while many people are slowing down, she’s speeding up—literally. And in doing so, she’s inspiring countless others to break free from the molds they’ve been placed in. And Radhamani proves that anyone with passion and determination can excel, regardless of age or gender! 𝘛𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘪𝘴 𝘱𝘢𝘳𝘵 𝘰𝘧 𝘢 𝘴𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘴 𝘰𝘯 𝘐𝘯𝘥𝘪𝘢'𝘴 𝘶𝘯𝘴𝘶𝘯𝘨 𝘸𝘰𝘮𝘦𝘯 𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘰𝘦𝘴.

India did something that was once only possible in science fiction, boldly creating new frontiers in space, and that too on a shoestring budget. On August 23, 2023, we touched the Moon’s enigmatic south pole. Chandrayaan-3's historic landing made the mark — India had arrived in the elite club of spacefaring nations. Today, we honor that moment with the first-ever National Space Day and ISRO Day! Remember when Chandrayaan-3’s Vikram lander touched down? The Vikram lander was descending, and a billion people held their breath. It wasn’t just scientists in mission control—everyone was on the edge of their seat. Then… touchdown. Tears of joy, the overwhelming pride—we had done it! Landing on the Moon’s south pole was a near-impossible task, where Chandrayaan-3 faced a region of uncharted craters, bone-chilling temperatures, and the constant threat of communication blackout. The terrain was a maze of hazards, demanding split-second decisions by the lander to avoid disaster. Designed to survive only 14 days of brutal lunar conditions, every second counted. After learning from Chandrayaan-2’s heartbreaking crash, ISRO crafted a mission that could defy failure, and against all odds, they did the impossible. Here are some remarkable achievements ISRO made in the mission: ⏺ 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐜𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲 𝐨𝐟 𝐋𝐮𝐧𝐚𝐫 𝐄𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬: The rover identified key elements on the lunar surface, including sulfur, aluminum, calcium, iron, and oxygen. This discovery is crucial for understanding the Moon's geology and potential resources. ⏺ 𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐨𝐟 𝐚 '𝐌𝐨𝐨𝐧𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐤𝐞': Chandrayaan-3's Vikram lander recorded a seismic event on the Moon, providing the first direct evidence of lunar seismic activity. ⏺ 𝐃𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐨𝐟 𝐋𝐮𝐧𝐚𝐫 𝐏𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐦𝐚: The mission detected a super-thin layer of plasma in the Moon's atmosphere, revealing new information about the Moon's interaction with solar radiation. ⏺ 𝐀𝐝𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐝 𝐋𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐲: The mission used a failure-based design, with increased landing area and enhanced thrusters, to ensure a successful soft landing despite potential system failures. ⏺ 𝐎𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐒𝐮𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐋𝐕𝐌-3 𝐑𝐨𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐭: Chandrayaan-3's launch was carried out by India's most powerful rocket, the LVM-3, showcasing India's growing capabilities in launching heavy payloads and further cementing ISRO's role in global space exploration The place where Vikram touched down? It’s now “Shiv Shakti,” a name that will forever symbolize ISRO’s relentless drive, exploring the most unforgiving corner of the Moon. And the Moon is just the beginning. Space is vast and we cannot imagine what the future holds. Today's science fiction is tomorrow's reality.

I often hear the lament, ‘We are not creating true innovative companies.’ The ecosystem from knowledge, risk-investing is minimal in India. Bhavish Aggarwal’s Ola Electric marked a milestone, and is a testament to ‘Thinking big, Thinking bold’ making its debut on the NSE and BSE! I have deep respect for the tenacity and vision Bhavish embodies. I have seen his journey over the last decade from a young entrepreneur to a deep thinker and bold leader. Someone who has a clear vision of who he is and the impact he wants to create. When Kalaari Capital team visited Ola Electric facilities, we found the India-first vision inspiring and motivating to reach deeper to do more. To think big—really big—is the hallmark of an entrepreneur who changes the industry and impacts the lives of many people. His vision for the EV market is ambitious. But the vision to be beyond a manufacturer and to take risks on leading technologies has potential for a greener future of mobility in India. We need more disruptors of industries. Besides passion, a long term commitment to one's vision and single-minded pursuit of it can redefine the way we think of building technology first business in India. I am not involved in Bhavish’s journey as an investor — I respect Bhavish’s tenacity, and his ability to inspire others to push the envelope. Wishing you much success Bhavish, congratulations! As you create your legacy as an entrepreneur, I hope you will use the privilege to create lasting change in many people's lives so that more leaders, entrepreneurs, and innovators can emerge. #Startups #OlaElectric #Ipo #EvIndustry #Entrepreneur\n\nLong ago, I read The Idol Thief by S. Vijay Kumar, a book that really put me in touch with my cultural past. A past I was so oblivious to. It also deeply saddened me. It recounts how priceless idols, hundreds of years old, and precious antiques from forgotten temples in India are stolen, sold cheaply, and then smuggled into museums for millions. Some of them have been stolen or bought from these forgotten temples for a few lakhs and sold for as much as $10-25M. I remember watching Mani Ratnam's 'Ponniyin Selvan' last year and being awed by the might of the Chola temples on display. Sadly, these village temples are often the first target of idol thieves. The famed Chola bronzes are highly prized and the target of idol thieves. Thousands of idols have been looted from India, with many ending up in international markets and museums. S. Vijay Kumar chronicles idol thieves. They have mastered the art of smuggling, trafficking millions of dollars worth of Chola bronzes. There is an Antiquities Law, of course. But if idol thieves have been able to smuggle the idols of gods with such impunity for decades, then somewhere, we are showing that we don't respect our heritage. This rich cultural history that we have had for centuries. Every time I pass by an old temple with a careless stone abutting its walls, I am reminded of our laxity. Every time I see people scribble graffiti on 1000-year-old walls, I am reminded of our disrespect. And each time I visit a dusty museum in India, carefully holding in its glass preserves the history of another era, I am reminded of just how much we need to protect our heritage. This is what prompted Vijay Kumar to launch the India Pride Project or IPP. IPP is a group of art enthusiasts who use open-source intelligence to identify and recover lost idols and artifacts from temples in India. Their work led to the return of many Chola bronzes and a prized 12th-century Buddha statue. But there are many, many more. There's the Freer Gallery, which has a gorgeous statue of the Chola queen, Sembiyan Mahadevi. There is also a sculpture of Alingana Murthy in a museum in the US. And so many other artifacts that we may probably never be able to trace. We have a new India that often overlooks the old, but we must value and coexist with our past. Without respect for our past, we lose a part of ourselves. #culture #history #india #temple #book\n\nTreasures are not always financial. Our fondest memories can come from simple everyday things. It can be something as simple as an old tiffin carrier. The other day, I was dropping my daughter off at the airport, and I packed some food for her in this tiffin carrier. It's not one that has seen much usage in a couple of decades but was still tucked somewhere in the pantry. And I reminisced about all the times my mother sent my father to work with this same dabba. It was part of their wedding gift, perhaps. But for 60 years, this has been part of our household. If you look closely, you will see initials engraved at the bottom. That was the custom then — to engrave initials or names while gifting. I don't know who gave this, but this tiffin carrier has been so much a part of my memories that, more than a practical everyday item, it is a container of memories. I don't use it much these days, but I pack food in it to take on long car journeys. Because, for me, it serves a purpose that's more than just being a carrier of food. Carrying it with me gives me a sense of warmth—a warm, fuzzy feeling for the people for whom I mattered very much: my parents. It connects me to the past and gives me a deep sense of rootedness. The memories it gives carry so much weight: of all the times my mother packed food for all of us—simple yet rich homemade food, packed with love. Her willingness to be up by 4 am to get the household into the rhythm to ensure we all left for school and work on time. These days, we talk about carbon footprints and sustainability. But long before Tupperware became a standard, there was this humble tiffin carrier. It carries memories, the weight of nostalgia, and the comfort of home. Remembering Appa fondly, yesterday was his first death anniversary. This simple tiffin carrier connects me to him and all that he did for me in his lifetime. #reflections #life #memories #parents #nostalgia"
