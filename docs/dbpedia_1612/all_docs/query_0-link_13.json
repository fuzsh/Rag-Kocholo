        "text": "I have owned many Bose Corporation speakers and headsets over the last three decades. Like most truly iconic brands they have stood the test of time, adapting to changing technology, consumer needs and market shifts. How can any of us not connect with a brand whose slogan is: more power, more passion, and more heart and soul. “You have to have the courage to be different. You can never do anything better unless it’s different. The history of science has shown again and again and again that what we have today thought to be impossible yesterday\" ~ Dr. Amar Bose Amar Bose is the man behind the $5B Bose brand and the inventor of the world’s first noise-cancelling headphones. Every entrepreneur will relate to his words - an idea became an obsession. And that became who we are. His words are drawn from his own journey. He was born in 1929 in United States. Pre-Independence days of India, when not much of Indian immigration was happening. He was born to an Indian father and American mother, which for that time was even more rare. HIs father, a freedom fighter, fled India to avoid persecution and imprisonment by the police. Bose nurtured a childhood love for electronics. As a precocious 13-year-old, he began a radio repair service to help his father. His interest in speaker systems began when he purchased a stereo system and was disappointed with its performance. He tinkered all his life to make things better. He was very interested in acoustics and the science behind it. His mantra for success was simple. \"How can we do something better than what we did yesterday?\" It took Bose 15 years of research to develop the company's trademark QuietComfort noise cancelling headphones. This noise cancellation system is also used to protect astronauts from hearing damage. To invest so many years of effort to see your product come to life is serious dedication, something we can all draw inspiration from. Did you know that Bose Corp is now owned by MIT? In 2011, a couple of years before he passed away, Bose donated all his shares to his alma matter MIT to \"advance the institute's research and education mission\". Bose's life has many lessons and inspiration to all who are passionate about pursuing their dreams and willing to think differently. So I write this post, for the Bose’s of tomorrow, for a life well lived – doing something you are passionate about, making a better world, leaving behind a legacy for future. His life is too inspiring to not share one more quote of his that I love - \"I would have been fired a hundred times at a company run by MBAs. But I never went into business to make money. I went into business so that I could do interesting things that hadn't been done before.” - Bose #MondayMotivation #Inspiration #audio #technology #history"
