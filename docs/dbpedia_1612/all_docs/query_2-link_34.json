The area in which the first European settlers came ashore in Australia way back in 1788. This neighbourhood is a key Sydney Australia tourist attraction bringing to life the essence of the colonial era combined with modern-day amenities and entertainment. Visit The Rocks to take in the sights, sounds, and atmosphere, and explore the many open-air markets, museums, and galleries nestled within its walled enclosures.
