Part of the bay is covered with ice. Beyond the bay, there are mountains blanketed in snow and various buildings. My partner picked me up from work when this photo was taken.\n\nToday, I'd like to tell you about the recent photo I took with my phone. This is my city's landscape. As you can see in the photo, we are going over the bridge. Here is the Kola Bay. The sky is blue and cloudy. The bay is a little covered with ice. Behind the bay, we see mountains covered with snow and buildings. What's the story of this photo?
