        "text": "Council invites you to participate by giving us your views, opinions or comments. While anyone can view these communication channels, you must register for each service to participate.\n\nPrivacy\n\nIf you choose to engage with any of the social media channels used by Council (for example by providing posts or comments on those channels), you acknowledge that your comments will immediately be made public on those channels. By using the social media channel, you also agree to abide by the privacy policy and the terms and conditions of the relevant social media channel. You also agree that your details, including submissions, are transferred outside of Australia and are subject to the relevant Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions of each service.\n\nCouncil is subject to the Information Privacy Act 2009 and is committed to respecting your privacy. We therefore ask that you respect the privacy of others when posting in our social media channels. Council records all information posted and uses that information for record-keeping and for considering and/or addressing any comments made. If you have any concerns or questions, please view our privacy statement.\n\nAttention is drawn to the Social Media section of the copyright notice, i.e. material posted by any other person, such as public users, is deemed to be made available by that person under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 licence as a condition of use of that channel.\n\nCouncil may collect your personal information if you interact with Council’s social media channels. This collection will be for the purpose of improving Council’s services and may involve Council (or a third party contractor) analysing and reporting on various aspects of your personal information.\n\nPhotographs\n\nCouncil does NOT claim ANY ownership rights in photos that you post to our walls or tag us in. However, by posting a photo on our wall you hereby grant to Council a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, revocable, non-transferable, perpetual licence to use, modify, delete from, add to, publicly display and/or reproduce, your photo, including without limitation in any online media formats and through any social media channels, pages or accounts.\n\nIf your photo is used on Council's digital or social platforms, your name and/or business will always be credited. We may also choose at our sole discretion to link back to your website or business social media profile.\n\nYou can revoke this licence at any time by emailing mbrc@moretonbay.qld.gov.au and informing us that you no longer want us to use your photo.\n\nAcceptable use\n\nViews expressed in these channels by anyone other than Council are not Council's views and Council disclaims all liability for any such views, comments, advertising or other non-Council content. Inflammatory, defamatory, commercial, spam and comments encouraging activities illegal in Australia or that are detected as transgressing copyright or other intellectual property laws will be deleted.\n\nCouncil strives to review content on a regular basis. However, there may be times when offensive comments that do not meet Acceptable Use, appear on the page before they can be removed.\n\nHouse rules\n\nCouncil’s social media channels provide information on council services, events, programs and news.\n\nWhat you can expect from us\n\nCouncil will reply to queries as quickly as possible, though sometimes there will be a delay in providing a full response if we seek advice from a council officer outside of the team who manages the social media channel.\n\nIf you need an urgent response or your query contains personal information, please contact Council on (07) 3205 0555 or lodge a request online.\n\nWhat we expect from you\n\nWe support the Facebook Community Standards and request that visitors to our social channels do the same.\n\nTo ensure our channels are an inclusive, friendly and welcoming space for all visitors, we do moderate where necessary. We ask that when contributing your views to council social media channels, you ensure that you:\n\nBe respectful of others and their opinions\n\nDo not harass, abuse or threaten other visitors to the page or council employees.\n\nDo not post comments that are likely to offend others, particularly in reference to race, age, gender, sexuality, political leaning, religion or disability.\n\nDo not use obscene or offensive language.\n\nDo not post defamatory comments.\n\nDo not post repeat comments continuously.\n\nDo not repeatedly post information which is factually inaccurate and may mislead others.\n\nDo not promote anything that may constitute spam, such as commercial interests, solicitations, or advertisements.\n\nProtect your personal privacy and that of others by not including personal information such as email addresses, phone numbers or home addresses in public posts or comments. Any posts or comments that violate these terms will be deleted.\n\nComments that do not adhere to the above will be moderated and potentially removed. Any person who violates these guidelines may be blocked from posting on council’s social media channels."
