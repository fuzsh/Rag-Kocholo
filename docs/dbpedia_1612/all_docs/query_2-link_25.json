All that is deeply padded by distinct visual delights, like the artfully designed Victorian houses, captivating rolling hills, and the eye-popping Golden Gate Bridge, which majestically crosses the teal waters of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nYou’ll be spoilt for a choice of things to see and do once you arrive in San Francisco, so narrowing down where to begin can be a tough task. To help you experience this beauty of a destination, we’ve rounded up the 18 incredible bucket-list places you must visit in the city.\n\nFrom iconic landmarks such as the Golden Gate Bridge to noteworthy hidden gems like the Cable Car Museum, here are the most popular tourist attractions in San Francisco.\n\nFind Places To Stay in San Francisco, California\n\nThe 18 Best San Francisco Attractions\n\nGolden Gate Bridge\n\nNo matter what you’re plans are in San Francisco, spare some time to marvel at the Golden Gate Bridge. Opened in 1937, this iconic bridge is known for its two 746-foot tall towers, sweeping main cables, and a signature orange color named “International Orange”. The Golden Gate majestically crosses the strait of the Golden Gate from San Francisco’s Presidio to the Marin headlands, and it’s considered an Art-Deco architectural masterpiece.\n\nTo experience the Golden Gate Bridge at its best, visitors can either marvel at it from viewpoints like the Fort Point National Historic Site, Baker Beach, or Fort Baker or bike across the bridge, which offers the most heart-warming views of the San Francisco Bay area.\n\nGolden Gate Park\n\nTo flee the crowds and frolic in wide-open green expanses, head over to Golden Gate Park.

If you want to learn everything about these iconic vehicles, which became a true landmark of San Francisco, visit the Cable Car Museum. Set within a cable car barn and powerhouse in the Nob Hill neighborhood, the museum is home to a collection of historic cable cars, as well as various mechanical devices, photographs, and detailed models.\n\nOne of the museum’s major highlights is three antique cable cars from the 1870s — the Sutter Street Railway No. 46 grip car, the No. 54 trailer, and the only surviving car from the first cable car company, the Clay Street Hill Railroad No. 8 grip car.\n\nAngel Island State Park\n\nAngel Island is the largest natural island in the San Francisco Bay area and was once a hunting and gathering destination for the local native tribes and a safe refuge stop for Spanish explorers.

Here, you’ll find treasures from the 17th through the 20th centuries, textile arts, and art from Africa, Oceania, and the Americas.\n\nThe museum’s collection also includes relics such as New Zealand Maori woodcarvings, an ancient maternity figure from Mali made of terracotta, and brilliantly colored mural fragments from a residential complex within the ancient city of Teotihuacan, Mexico.\n\nAsian Art Museum\n\nThe Asian Art Museum was founded over 50 years ago after collector Avery Brundage donated nearly 8,000 Asian artworks to the city of San Francisco.
