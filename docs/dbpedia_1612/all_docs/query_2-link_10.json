The park has a wide diversity of landscapes, and each seems to be more beautiful than the next.\n\nIn the northern part of the park, the Oxer Lookout gives visitors breathtaking views of the Weano, Red, Hancock, and Joffre gorges. These red rock gorges are very reminiscent of the breathtaking canyons of Southern Utah in the United States.\n\nTo the east, you will find the red rocks of Dales Gorge and the cascades of Fortescue Falls. There are few things more beautiful than waterfalls cascading down brilliant red rock cliffs. And if the sights aren’t enough to pique your interest, the park is also home to incredible indigenous wildlife. This includes Australian goshawks, ring-tailed dragons, and desert tree frogs.\n\n26. Phillip Island Penguin Parade\n\nIn addition to its beautiful beaches and incredible cities, another thing that the country of Australia is renowned for having unique and beautiful wildlife. While seeing kangaroos, koalas, wombats, and dingoes is the biggest draw for visitors to Australia, one of the country’s most unique wildlife encounters doesn’t seem like it fits in Australia at all.\n\nLocated about 90 minutes from the city of Melbourne in Victoria, Phillip Island is infamous for having one of the largest breeding colonies of one of the world’s smallest penguin species. Each night, the Australian little penguins emerge from the ocean after a day of feeding to head back to their burrows on land.\n\nAnd if you are lucky enough to secure a ticket, you can watch this adorable penguin parade from one of the many boardwalks. Without a doubt, this is one of the most unique wildlife encounters in the world. That is why I consider it one of the top things to see when visiting Australia.\n\n25. Manly Beach\n\nThis wouldn’t be a list of the top things to see when visiting Australia without mentioning the many incredible beaches. And you can’t talk about Australia’s top beaches without mentioning the amazing Manly Beach in the city of Sydney.\n\nManly Beach is one of those magical beaches that seem to have something for everyone in the family to enjoy. Its soft white sand is great for laying on when enjoying some relaxation in the sun. For those who want to get into the water, the beach is one of Australia’s best for swimming, surfing, and snorkeling.\n\nAnd if you are in the mood for some activity, but don’t want to get wet, the biking and walking paths are wonderful. So, if you are visiting Sydney in the near future, I would strongly suggest checking out the beautiful Manly Beach.\n\n24. Wave Rock Caravan Park\n\nSometimes, a landscape looks just too incredible to be real. The iconic Wave Rock in Western Australia is one of these landscapes. Located roughly 350 kb southeast of Perth, this curved granite cliff face looks way too cool to be real. But believe me, it is very much real.\n\nThe Wave Rock is actually the northern face of a large granite erosional remnant called Hayden Rock. The rock has eroded to make the face look like a giant wave about be break. At roughly 15 meters high and 110 meters long, it is an incredible sight to see first-hand. One of the best ways to see Wave Rock is to stay at the Wave Rock caravan park. The facilities are incredible. They include restrooms, a swimming pool, barbeques, a kid’s playground, and even a cafe for visitors to enjoy.\n\n23. Mount Wellington\n\nWhile Table Mountain in Cape Town, South Africa may get more glory, it isn’t the only beautiful coastal mountain in the world. On the island state of Tasmania, the capital city of Hobart has its own iconic coastal mountain.\n\nHere, you will find the iconic Mount Wellington. Not only is it every bit as beautiful as its South African counterpart, but it is also 200 meters taller. For travelers planning to visit Tasmania, checking out the Mount Wellington Park Reserve is well worth the time.\n\nThe park has many incredible hiking and biking paths for visitors to enjoy. And if you are up for the challenge, the views from the top of the mountain are breathtaking. And when you’re done exploring the park, the beautiful city of Hobart is a great place to unwind.\n\n22. Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary\n\nIf the Loan Pine Koala Sanctuary sounds familiar, it’s probably because it was on my list of top wildlife destinations. Located in a suburb of Fig Tree Pocket in Queensland, it is the oldest koala sanctuary in the world. Infamous for its efforts to preserve some of Australia’s most iconic native wildlife, it features roughly 80 different species.\n\nThis includes many adorable koalas. If you love wildlife, there are few places in Australia where you can see more native wildlife in the wild. That is why the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary is one of the top things to see when visiting Australia.\n\n21. Kata Tjuta\n\nNothing is quite as iconic Australian as the region of the Northern Territory affectionately known as the “Red Centre”. This desert region of Australia is what many people picture when they hear the term “Outback”. Not only is this region of Australia unique, but it is also incredibly beautiful.\n\nOne of the most iconic landmarks in this region of the Northern Territory is the stunning Kata Tjuṯa. Also referred to as Mount Olga, it is a group of large, domed rock formations about 360 km southwest of Alice Springs. In addition to seeing and photographing this amazing landmark, you can also hike around them.\n\nAnd if you wait until sunrise or sunset, they glow the most beautiful shade of orange. Definitely a must-see landmark for anyone visiting the Red Centre of Australia.\n\n20. Wilsons Promontory National Park\n\nLocated on a peninsula southeast of Melbourne, Wilson’s Promontory National Park is simply breathtaking. Known for its beautiful, rugged granite mountains and abundant wildlife, the park is a favorite stop for outdoor adventurers and animal enthusiasts. Among the plentiful wildlife that can be found within the park include kangaroos and wombats.\n\nThere are also a number of fantastic beaches and hiking trails within the park to enjoy. And for those who love lighthouses, the Wilsons Promontory Light station, built in 1859, is stunning. So, if you are planning a trip to Melbourne, make sure you include a stop at Wilsons Promontory National Park on your itinerary.\n\n19. Byron Bay\n\nThis quaint coastal town on the northern coast of New South Wales is a very popular holiday destination. It is known for its spectacular beaches, incredible surfing, and superb scuba diving sites. In addition to its incredible coastline, it’s also home to one of Australia’s prettiest lighthouses.\n\nIf you visit between June and November, you have a great chance of spotting humpback whales off the coast. Arguably the best spot to go whale watching is at the renowned Captain Cook Lookout. So, if you are looking for some great beach time when you visit Australia, the breathtaking Byron Bay should be on your list.\n\n18. Kakadu National Park\n\nIf you are looking to experience the rough and ruggedness of Australia’s “Outback” region during your visit, you will want to visit the Northern Territory. This Australian state has some of the most beautiful desert landscapes in Australia.\n\nOne of the more beautiful parklands in the Northern Territory is the beautiful Kakadu National Park. Located near the northern coast, this enormous biodiverse nature reserve is spectacular. Within the park, you will find beautiful wetlands, mighty rivers, and breathtaking sandstone escarpments.\n\nIt is also home to over 2,000 different plant species and some of the largest saltwater crocodiles in the world. The park is also renowned for its brilliantly preserved Aboriginal rock paintings that date back to prehistoric times. So, if you are looking for a little adventure during your visit to Australia, keep the Kakadu National Park in mind.\n\n17. The Kuranda Rainforest\n\nWhile many people only picture beautiful beaches and the desert of the Outback when they think of Australia, the country also has some stunning rainforests. One of my favorite rainforests in Australia to visit is undoubtedly the breathtaking Kuranda Rainforest.\n\nLocated in Queensland near the city of Cairns, the Kuranda Rainforest Nature Park is a stunning way to escape into nature when visiting Australia. In addition to a wonderful train ride that you can take into the rainforest, there is also an incredible cable car that you can take as well. Both offer numerous stops where you can get out, enjoy the views, and try and spot some of the incredible indigenous wildlife.\n\nAt the top is Kuranda Town, where you can eat at a number of amazing restaurants or go shopping in the hippie village. There is also an incredible wildlife park and bird sanctuary to enjoy as well. So, if you are visiting Cairns to explore the Great Barrier Reef, the Kuranda Rainforest is a great add-on for your visit.\n\n16. The Bay of Fires\n\nWhile the mainland of Australia gets most of the glory for its breathtaking coastline, the island state of Tasmania certainly has its fair share as well. One of the most beautiful stretches of coastline in Tasmania is the renowned Bay of Fires.\n\nLocated on the island’s northeastern coast, from Binalong Bay to Eddystone Point, it is a popular spot for visitors. It was named by Captain Tobias Furneaux after he saw Aboriginal people around campfires on the beaches back in 1773.\n\nToday the bay is more known for its soft white sand beaches, beautiful blue waters, and orange-hued granite rock along the coastline. Among other activities, visitors can enjoy boating, swimming, surfing, hiking, fishing, and bird watching. For anyone visiting Tasmania in the near future, a stop at the Bay of Fires for a little beach time should definitely be on the itinerary.\n\n15. Bondi Beach\n\nOne thing that Sydney, Australia is not in short supply of breathtaking beaches. Seriously, there are almost too many to name or even to count. However, some of Sydney’s beaches are so incredible and popular that they are world-renowned. One of these beaches is the infamous Bondi Beach.\n\nThere is a good reason why Bondi Beach was near the top of my list of the top beaches in the world for travelers to visit. It’s situated near some of the most incredibly beautiful and rugged rocky coastlines you will find in the world. Not only that, but its soft white sand is perfect for sunbathing or taking a beach walk.\n\nFor those who want to get into the water, Bondi Beach is one of the best beaches in Australia for swimming or surfing. And if you don’t like the salt water, the Icebergs Ocean Pool is open for visitors to enjoy year-round. So, if seeing one of Australia’s iconic beaches is on your travel bucket list, make sure you don’t miss out on seeing Bondi Beach when you visit.\n\n14. Flinders Ranges\n\nWhen putting together any list of the top things to see when visiting Australia, you absolutely have to include the top sights in the Outback. One of the most breathtaking locations in the Australian Outback is a location known as the Flinders Ranges.\n\nLocated in the state of South Australia, about 380 km north of Adelaide, the Flinders Ranges encapsulates everything you would imagine when thinking of the Outback. Driving thru the area, you would think you are driving on the surface of Mars. Ancient cliffs that tower into the sky, deep craters that seem to have no bottom, and dusty dirt roads meandering into the distance are hallmarks of Flinders Ranges.\n\nVisitors can drive along the Aboriginal Dreaming Trail or marvel at the Wilpena Pound. This shockingly gigantic amphitheater will take your breath away. And it is just one of the many incredible geographical features you will find in this amazing landscape. In summary, for those looking for an authentic Australian Outback adventure, the Flinders Ranges in South Australia may be just what you are looking for.\n\n13. Whitsundays\n\nIf there were to be one rule about visiting Australia, in my opinion, it should be that you can’t plan a visit without getting out on the ocean. Seriously, Australia has some of the most breathtaking and biodiverse ocean waters in the world. It would be an absolute shame to visit and not get to experience this beauty first-hand.\n\nWithout a doubt, one of the best places to get out on the ocean in Australia is the infamous Whitsunday Islands. This cluster of 74 islands lies between the northeast coast of Queensland and the Great Barrier Reef. In fact, if you plan to visit the reef, and why wouldn’t you, then seeing the Whitsundays is a convenient side trip.\n\nThe islands are characterized by dense rainforests, incredible hiking trails, and white-sand beaches. If in the process of planning your trip, you can use the quaint beach town of Airlie Beach as your hub. From there, you can enjoy all of the beauty and splendor the Whitsunday Islands have to offer!\n\n12. Bells Beach\n\nIf you have ever seen the movie Point Break, you may remember the scene where Patrick Swayze’s character Bodhi paddles out from a beach into the “100-year storm”, never to be seen again. In the movie, that beach is the iconic Bells Beach in Australia.\n\nThis world-renowned surfing beach is located in the state of Victoria in the Surf Coast Shire and is legendary within surfing circles. In fact, surfing is so big in the area that two different iconic surfing brands started out in the area. That’s right, the renowned surf brands Rip Curl and Quiksilver were both founded near Bells Beach.\n\nFor those planning on visiting Melbourne and driving the Great Ocean Road, Bells Beach is one of the first stops. Even if you aren’t up for getting out on the water and surfing, seeing this iconic beach and doing a little shopping is well worth the visit. So what are you waiting for? Surfs up!\n\n11. The Blue Mountains\n\nSydney, Australia has enough incredible things to see and do to keep you busy for days. However, there are many incredible things to see in the surrounding area as well. If you are looking for an amazing day trip to take from Sydney, I would recommend the beautiful Blue Mountains.\n\nThis rugged region west of Sydney is known for its dramatically beautiful scenery and lovely little villages. Each year, visitors flock to the Blue Mountains from Sydney to enjoy the steep cliffs, the stunning eucalyptus forests, and the breathtaking waterfalls.\n\nIf you would like to stay in the area, the wonderful city of Katoomba is a great place to stay. The town borders the Blue Mountains and has many trails into the mountains that you can explore. Whatever you do, don’t miss out on seeing Echo Point. From here, you have some of the best views of the storied Three Sisters rock formation.\n\n10. Fraser Island\n\nIf it is ranked in the top 10 on my list of the top things to see when visiting Australia, it must be good. Australia has a number of incredible islands off its coastline, but Frazer Island is in a league of its own. Located along the southeastern coast in the Wide Bay region of Queensland, the island is renowned for its towering trees that grow on top of sand dunes.\n\nThe official citation of the island pays tribute to the island’s “exceptional natural beauty”, and that is no exaggeration. With over 250 km of beautiful sand beach, colorful seaside cliffs, and breathtaking rainforests, Fraser Island is one of the gems of Australian tourism.\n\nHowever, the island may be most famous for the incredible shipwreck of the SS Maheno. The wreck still sits on the beach and is one of the top Instagram locations in Queensland. For those looking for a day trip from Brisbane to get out in nature, Fraser Island is a great option!\n\n9. The Sydney Harbour Bridge\n\nNot only is the Sydney Harbour Bridge an absolute must-see attraction when visiting Sydney, but it might also be one of the most iconic symbols of Australia itself. Spanning the beautiful Sydney Harbour near the heart of the city, the bridge is impossible to miss.\n\nThere are many viewpoints around the city where you can photograph the bridge. However, the best views are from the bridge itself. The city offers tours where you can climb to the top of the bridge, with a safety harness of course.\n\nThe incredible views of the city of Sydney from the top of the bridge will take your breath away. If you plan to visit Sydney and would like to climb the bridge, check out my Ultimate Sydney, Australia Travel Guide linked below for more details.\n\n8. Port Douglas\n\nFor travelers visiting the Great Barrier Reef that are looking for other things to explore, the city of Port Douglas is a great option. Not only are there many tours to the Great Barrier Reef operated out of Port Douglas, but it is also close to the Daintree Rainforest.\n\nThis hip, yet relaxed seaside village is perfect for all types of travelers. There is a wide range of accommodation options, so it is a very good location to use as a base to explore the far north of Queensland. In addition to many great restaurants and boutique shops, the city also has a wonderful beach to enjoy. So, before you start booking your trip to Queensland, Australia, consider checking out Port Douglas during your stay.\n\n7. Wineglass Bay\n\nThere are some destinations that are just magical. The incredible Wine Glass Bay (also known as Coles Bay) on the east coast of Tasmania is one of those places. You can’t just stop and see it because you always leave wanting more of this paradise. Nowhere else in Australia can you find breathtaking pink granite mountains that seem to rise straight out of the sea.\n\nWith calm, clear waters, it is the perfect spot to take a boat cruise around the peninsula or go kayaking. For travelers looking for a little more adventure, the sea cliffs offer some of the best rock climbing in Australia. And if you aren’t a climber, the mountain trails offer stunning views of the bay and the coastline. No matter what speed you like to travel, the picture-perfect Wine Glass Bay in Tasmania has something for every type of traveler to enjoy.\n\n6. The Pinnacles Desert\n\nThere are some truly spectacular landscapes in Australia, but the Pinnacles Desert of Nambung National Park may be one of the best. Located along Australia’s Coral Coast in Western Australia, this incredible park encapsulates the beauty of Australia’s desert regions.\n\nFormed millions of years ago, the thousands of amazing natural limestone spires that fill the valley make it feel like you are on another planet. In addition to the incredible landscape, the park is also home to some spectacular local wildlife.\n\nAnd because it is located just three hours from the city of Perth, it is an easy day trip for anyone visiting Western Australia. So, if you are looking for something to fill out your itinerary when you visit Western Australia, I would strongly consider the Pinnacles Desert.\n\n5. The Daintree Rainforest\n\nYou can’t make a list of the top things to see when visiting Australia and not include the incredible Daintree Rainforest. Formed over 135 million years ago, it is the oldest rainforest in the world.\n\nNot only is it one of Australia’s most beautiful places, but it is also one of its most biodiverse. The rainforest is home to many of Australia’s indigenous plant and animal species. In fact, some of the plants and animals that live there are found nowhere else in the world.\n\nVisitors have a chance to see animals such as the Southern Cassowary, Boyd’s Forest Dragon, and Bennett’s and Lumholtz Tree Kangaroos. Because Daintree is just 105 km from Cairns, it is a popular destination for visitors touring the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nIf you do decide to visit, make sure you take one of the area’s infamous croc cruises. The boat rides down the Daintree River, which is home to large saltwater crocs, is an experience you’ll remember forever!\n\n4. Uluru\n\nThere are some landmarks in Australia that are just too fantastic to miss. Simply put, the massive sandstone monolith named Uluru, or Ayers Rock, is one of them. Located in the heart of Australia’s Northern Territory, Uluru is world-renowned for its beauty.\n\nIn fact, it has almost become synonymous with the “Red Centre” of Australia’s Outback region. Because it is located roughly 450km away from Alice Springs, which is the nearest town, it’s a hike to get to. But if you have the time and don’t mind making the effort, it is well worth it.\n\nUluru is located in the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, which is also home to Kata Tjuta (mentioned previously on my list). So, if you are able to get there, you can cross two of Australia’s must-see items off your list!\n\n3. The Sydney Opera House\n\nWhen it comes to iconic landmarks that symbolize Australia, few come to mind more than the Sydney Opera House. This breathtaking building, located on the south side of the Sydney Harbour, is one of the most famous theatres in the world.\n\nThe amazing design of this building came out of an international competition that included 233 different designs from 30 different countries. Today, the 2,679-seat Concert Hall hosts symphony concerts, choir performances, and popular music shows.\n\nI can think of no way better to spend a night in Sydney than taking in a show at this iconic opera house. If you are planning a visit to Sydney in the near future, I would suggest getting your tickets early.\n\n2. The Twelve Apostles\n\nWithout a doubt, my favorite thing that I saw when in Australia was the breathtaking Twelve Apostles. Rising out of the ocean waters a staggering 45m (150ft), the limestone pillars were once connected to the seaside cliffs.\n\nToday, they are the feature attraction of Port Campbell National Park on the coast of Victoria. Located roughly 4.5 hours from Melbourne on the famed Great Ocean Road, Port Campbell National Park, and the Twelve Apostles have become a must-see attraction for visitors.\n\nIn addition to the park roads, there are many different paved and gravel hiking trails within the park. For more information on what else you can see in Port Campbell National Park, see my visitor guide linked below. If you are planning a trip to Melbourne, seeing the Great Ocean Road and its star the Twelve Apostles is something you won’t want to miss!\n\n1. The Great Barrier Reef\n\nThe last item on my list of the top things to see when visiting Australia really doesn’t need much of an introduction. As the largest coral reef on Earth and one of the most biodiverse places in our planet’s oceans, the Great Barrier Reef is simply a wonder of the world.\n\nEvery year, millions of visitors from around the world flock to Australia to see this natural beauty. The Great Barrier Reef is actually a collection of over 2,900 individual reefs and over 900 islands that stretch over 2,300 kilometers down the coast of Queensland, Australia.\n\nAll told, this enormous reef covers a total of 344,400 square kilometers and hosts roughly 25% of the ocean’s species. It is truly a wonder to behold. If you want to see the reef, you will need to book a tour with a licensed professional.\n\nThe best places to book these tours are either from the city of Cairns or Port Douglas, in Northern Queensland. Tours offer a variety of different options to see the reef, including both snorkeling and scuba diving opportunities. Without a doubt, seeing the Great Barrier Reef is an experience you will always remember.\n\nLet Me Help You Save On Your Next Adventure!\n\n‘Start Exploring Today’ Merchandise Available Now!"
