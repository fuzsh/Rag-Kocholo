        "text": "Picture this: I sit at CrossEatery in Sydney and my pre-planned itinerary is slowly coming to its end. I’m pondering over a granola bircher where I should go next on my travels and it pops into my head: why not go on a Great Ocean Road tour?\n\nThe Great Ocean Road is on many travellers’ bucket lists as a once-in-a-lifetime experience. It is continuously rated as a top road trip due to its historic & cultural significance and outstanding natural beauty.\n\nI must admit, driving along the Great Ocean Road wasn’t on my initial list of things to do in Australia. But then, there was something beautiful in having this spontaneous intuition that drew me to do it. In hindsight, I wish I had invested a bit more time in researching the area and spent a few more days there. So if you consider going on an epic Great Ocean Road tour, here’s my original itinerary. It covers a budget breakdown and additional activities that I wished I had done to get the most out of my road trip.\n\nWhy Is The Great Ocean Road Famous?\n\nThe Great Ocean Road is an Australian National Heritage that stretches 300km on the southern edge of the continent. It is first and foremost the world’s largest war memorial commemorating the fallen soldiers of WW I. It crosses through wild terrain of outstanding natural beauty. The countless points of interest & outdoor activities call for every adventurer’s heart.\n\nThe road stretches from Torquay to Warrnambool. It boasts coastal views, endless beaches, and wild vegetation. Ancient rainforests offer a lot of activities and exploration, whereas the sea-side impresses with natural sandstone formations. The drive can easily be done in two to three days but I would advise spending at least five days to cover everything and truly take it all in.\n\nHow Do I Plan A Great Ocean Road Trip?\n\nYou’ve come to the right place because I’ll tell you everything you need to know about planning a Great Ocean Road Tour. Know that along the way I ran into a couple of mishaps and my three-day Great Ocean Road itinerary includes alternative activities and improvements. It’s important to research as much as possible and consult different sources. The more you read on the Great Ocean Road tour, the more you’ll know what to expect. There will be activities that everyone recommends, and then there will be less known activities along the way. A good variety is key when planning a Great Ocean Road tour so you won’t miss out or feel you’ve rushed the trip.\n\nDay 1: Melbourne to Apollo Bay (approx. 200km)\n\nPoints of Interest: Aireys Inlet, Split Lighthouse, Fairhaven Beach, Memorial Arch & Eastern View, Koala spotting at Kennett River, wildlife, Lorne, Beech Forest, Hopetoun Waterfalls\n\nAccommodation: Apollo Bay, The International but alternative Mantra, Lorne\n\nCosts: £30 car, £50 accommodation, £30 food/on the road supply\n\nI arrived at Melbourne airport in the early morning and picked up my rental car from Europcar. This time I decided against local brand Jucy because I wasn’t too impressed with their car from my previous East Coast road trip. The pickup at Melbourne airport was smooth & hassle-free. My companion, a Hyundai i30, was top!\n\nLeaving Melbourne behind, my first stop was Torquay – the starting point of the Great Ocean Road. Torquay is often referred to as the birthplace of Australian surfing and has a rich culture. Particularly Bells Beach is listed on every major travel site as a particular point of interest. However, when I got there, I found the beach underwhelming. Maybe I was too spoilt by the pristine QLD & NSW beaches, but Bells Beach didn’t do it for me. I lost a good amount of time hanging around Torquay stacking up on supplies and having a quick lunch. My tip would be to skip the town completely and get onto the Great Ocean Road as soon as possible. There are much more impressive views to see and adventures awaiting.\n\nTip: Skip Torquay and get straight onto the Great Ocean Road. There are much more points of interest and impressive views waiting for you.\n\nAccommodation is pricey on the Great Ocean Road with an average spend of £50 per night for a hotel. Private accommodation is often way more expensive than a hotel. I would recommend booking in advance and comparing prices in nicer towns such as Lorne or Port Campbell.\n\nThe drive got more interesting after Torquay. Aireys Inlet is worth a stop. Here, I walked up to the Split Lighthouse and caught a first glimpse of the rough coastal sand formations meeting turquoise waters. It is a stunning view like I’ve never seen before. It was one of those moments that made the long journey to Australia worth it. I remember I was so impressed by the rough nature and views over the nearby beach.\n\nFurther down the road is Fairhaven Beach – a dreamy never-ending beach with wild waves and golden sands. Do plan some time for a stroll and watch the waves. It follows along the road for a good while until you get to Eastern View.\n\nI definitely recommend a break here, as the Memorial Arch marks an official start that you are on the epic Great Ocean Road. Memorial Arch used to be a toll point. The money collected from travellers was then used to cover the costs of building the road. Apparently, the wooden arch burnt down a few times over the years. The current one standing is its fourth version. There’s also a commemorative plaque honouring the 3000 servicemen that built the road from 1919 to 1932.\n\nAlways keep your eyes open for wildlife. It happened that I drove past a spikey creature that had caught my eye. I stopped, walked back up the road, and checked out the little guy. It happened to be my first sighting of an Echidna! I had no idea what this little fella was, so once I got back to the car, I googled “spiky hedgehog Australia” and managed to identify it.\n\nBe prepared to stop after every bend and turn as there are various viewpoints dotted along the meandering road. This part of the Great Ocean Road coastline is impressively rough whilst it contrasts with untamed Australian bush. I must have made little progress in one hour because I was in awe and stopped every 5 minutes.\n\nAfter a while, I drove through a pretty seaside town called Lorne. It is a very nice and neat settlement with cute shops, restaurants, and a country club. It was lively and busy, and I deeply regret that I didn’t stop there. Because I had wasted so much time in Torquay, I needed to get to my checkpoint in Apollo Bay before dusk. Lorne would have made an excellent spot for a coffee break or even as a base.\n\nTip: Stop in Lorne for a coffee break or even make it your base for a night or two. It’s a lovely and lively beach town.\n\nI continued to Apollo Bay and reached the village in the evening. Apollo Bay was an anti-climax to lively Lorne. I felt it was dead and outdated. Luckily the beach was big and offered unspoiled views over the ocean. I enjoyed an incredible moon rise over the water. Other than that, I wished I had stayed in Lorne.\n\nThere weren’t many cafés or restaurants in Apollo Bay so I had to end the day without dinner. Accommodation in Apollo Bay is average and very pricey for what it is. I was shocked by the state of the first place I had booked and had to quickly find an alternative. This is definitely not something you want to deal with after a long day and drive. In the end, I found a room at The International which I reluctantly had to take as it got dark and I didn’t fancy sleeping in the car.\n\nIf I would do a Great Ocean Road tour again, I would do Day 1 differently. There’s quite a lot to see on the first part of the tour so I would invest two days here. Day 1 is already packed with driving and many impressions. Instead of staying in Apollo Bay, I would cut the drive short and stay over in Lorne. The Australian chain hotel Mantra would be my choice for accommodation as it is modern and affordable located in a lively area. After a long day of driving, I missed the companionship of other people and Lorne would have provided that.\n\nOn the second day, I would explore the area. There are hiking trails in the surrounding bush. I sadly missed out on the clifftop views and Koala spotting at Kennett River which I would recommend for you to consider. Further inland is a Beech Forest which is home to giant Californian Redwoods. Another point of interest for me would be the Hopetoun Waterfalls before ending the day back in Lorne.\n\nDay 2: Apollo Bay to Warrnambool (approx. 220km)\n\nPoints of Interest: Cape Otway, coastal hiking path, Cape Otway Light station, Otway Fly Treetop Adventures, 12 Apostles, The Razor-Back, Loch Ard Gorge, The Arch, London Bridge, The Grotto, Gibson Steps, Bay of Martyrs, Bay of Islands, Port Campbell, Peterborough\n\nAccommodation: Warrnambool Elm Tree Motel, but alternative Port Campbell or Peterborough\n\nCosts: £30 car, £40 accommodation, £55 Otway Zipline Tour (online)\n\nOptional: £10 Cape Otway Light station\n\nMy Day 2 was just as jam-packed as Day 1. It started way before sunrise – partly because I had lots planned and I didn’t sleep much at The International in Apollo Bay. I was glad the night was over and so, made a quick move towards Cape Otway where I would spend the entire morning.\n\nLeaving Apollo Bay behind, the landscape changed from wild bush to lush, rolling hills. The road to Cape Otway is slightly off the beaten track but it leads through a magnificent forest. I got out of the car a few times and enjoyed the peaceful nature and its sound. I came across wallabies and watched the forest waking up. It was a magical moment and worth the early get-up.\n\nPassing through the forest led me onto an open field and I stopped again to watch a mob of kangaroos. From a distance, I was able to see them in the wild and enjoying their breakfast. The kangaroo king had a watchful eye over his females and now and again, I made out a pair of lanky legs from a joey hanging out of the pouch. Following down the road, there’s also a hidden backpacker hostel and at its very end, one can find Cape Otway Lighthouse – Australia’s most important lighthouse.\n\nBuilt in 1848, Cape Otway is the oldest surviving lighthouse in Australia. It opens daily at 9 am and sadly, I couldn’t stay for that long. I had booked an activity further inland of Cape Otway and had only an hour to spare at the lighthouse. I spend my time exploring the sea cliffs where the Bass Strait and the Southern Ocean collide. There are narrow coastal hiking paths meandering along the cliffs, which was very adventurous. The paths are covered under thick and dense brushwood which gave exploring a mysterious touch. You can definitely spend an entire day here hiking, taking in the views, and listening to the sea. Unfortunately, I had to make a move and drove back inland to the Otway National Park.\n\nTop Tip: Don’t miss out on the Otway Fly Treetop adventure during your Great Ocean Road Tour. The flight on a zipline, 10 meters above ground through the Australian bush is unforgettable. Tickets costs £55pp (online).\n\nAbout an hour later I reached Otway National Park. Here, visitors can fly on a zipline through the rainforest and climb up a treehouse. It has a serious “I’m a Celeb” vibe! An absolute must! The zipline flight through the rainforest was fun and different.\n\nDue to the early days of Covid, there weren’t many visitors and I had the tour guide to myself. He was hilarious! We were doing all sorts of silly moves and screams whilst speeding through the trees – irritating the wallabies and other visitors below on the ground. What an adventure! This experience plus a walk around on the tree walk took at least 3h. PLEASE DO NOT MISS THIS and book your Otway Fly Treetop Adventure.\n\nBut there was more to come.\n\nThe highlight of every Great Ocean Road tour is the 12 Apostles and other coastal formations shaped by the rough Tasmanian Sea. This part of the road trip is overwhelming (in a good way!) and intense. Again, you will get in and out of the car every ten minutes and it is pretty tiring at the end of the day. I would say to fully enjoy and appreciate this natural wonder, you have to add another day to your Great Ocean Road plan.\n\nThe order of coastal formations is as followed:\n\n12 Apostles, Gibson Steps\n\nThe Razor-Back\n\nLoch Ard Gorge\n\nThe Arch\n\nLondon Bridge\n\nThe Grotto (fewer visitors)\n\nBay of Martyrs\n\nBay of Islands (new formations)\n\nAll of these are stunning and offer walks and trails to explore. The main formations are, of course, The 12 Apostles. There’s a visitor centre and paths down to viewing platforms are neatly laid out and widely spaced out. Nearby are The Gibson Steps which were unfortunately closed on the day I went. Usually, visitors can ascend to the beach and walk along the water. Loch Ard Gorge also leads you down to a beach whereas, at London Bridge, the beach is closed off. It is a breeding ground for penguins hence why there’s no access.\n\nThe Bay of Martyrs and Bay of Islands are newly created formations, but they are towards the end of the Great Ocean Road. It tends to be quieter down there, as most visitors are only interested in the first six locations. Day tours from Melbourne also cut timings at each location very short, so I was glad, that I had my own rental car and was flexible with my time. My personal favourite was The Grotto. It’s a sinkhole where the limestone cliffs have fallen away and expose a receding cliff line. It is beautifully carved by nature as a “frame” but is partially a cave, too.\n\nAnd that is pretty much it. The Great Ocean Road ends with the final two bays. Those are less spectacular as the formations are not fully carved by nature yet but worth having a quick look around. At the Bay of Islands, you can ascend to the beach and have a stroll on its pristine sand.\n\nThe final kilometers of the Great Ocean Road tour to Warrnambool are unspectacular. Warrnambool itself was ok. It is after all an industrial town and good enough for a place to rest. I stayed at Elm Tree Motel before returning to Melbourne the next day. Again, it has been a long, impression-heavy, and eventful day.\n\nIf I did a Great Ocean Road tour again, I would include two more days in this area. Following up on the alternative itinerary from Day 1, I would leave Lorne early on Day 3. Explore the lighthouse, hike the Cape Otway area and do the Otway Tree Adventure. That would be a great Day 3 before finding my base in Port Campbell or Peterborough. Both are much nicer towns than Warrnambool plus they are located directly on the Great Ocean road.\n\nOn Day 4 I would drive back to the 12 Apostle and dedicate the entire day to exploring the coastal formations. This is doable nice and early as the daylight of an Australian Day covers roughly 7 am to approximately 5:30 pm.\n\nDay 3: Warrnambool to Melbourne (approx. 266km)\n\nPoints of Interest: Grampians National Park (this will add another 100km if you decide to include a hike in your Great Ocean Road tour)\n\nAccommodation: QT in Melbourne\n\nCosts: £30 car, £30 full tank, £120 accommodation, £20 food\n\nOn my final day, I felt very tired and exhausted. The impression heavy yesterday was too intense. Again I wished I had factored in a few more days for my Great Ocean Road tour. The drive back to Melbourne took approximately 3h and led over flat rural countryside.\n\nI refueled the car in Geelong, a town a few kilometers outside of Melbourne. Petrol was cheaper in that area. Once I got back to the airport I dropped off the car and made my way into central to relax from the trip.\n\nTip: It might be tempting but please don’t do an espresso experience as I did. In hindsight, I cramped way too much into a short amount of time. I felt sometimes rushed and at the end of the day shattered from impression overload. In the end, I had to leave out The Grampians simply because of tiredness. Take a rest and plan rather a day or two more for your Great Ocean Road tour.\n\nFollowing up on the alternative itinerary from Day 2, I would spend Day 5 exploring The Grampians. This National Park is approximately 150km North of Port Campbell. The area is a natural reserve known for its sandstone mountains and rich wildlife. Near the village of Halls Gap is the Brambuk Aboriginal Cultural Centre. I would have loved to see this as I’m interested in Aboriginal culture and heritage. The centre allows insights into local life, Aboriginal history & art. There are numerous hiking trails and vantage points, such as MacKenzie Falls and The Balconies.\n\nOverall Budget Breakdown for My Great Ocean Road Tour\n\nMy three-day Great Ocean Road tour cost* me the following:\n\n*Costs exclude flights to Australia\n\nDo’s & Don’ts For Your Great Ocean Road Trip\n\nFinally, I’d like to share with you my personal dos & don’ts when planning a Great Ocean Road tour.\n\nFAQs For Your Great Ocean Road Tour\n\nI understand this is quite a lengthy post and you may have some quick questions about planning a Great Ocean Road tour. You can always come back to any section of my itinerary and read in more detail what you’d need for your trip.\n\nHow long does it take to drive the whole Great Ocean Road?\n\nThe Great Ocean Road stretches from Torquay to Warrnambool over 300km. If you drive the whole distance without stopping, you can easily manage the distance within a couple of hours. However, why would you rush? The Great Ocean Road is a beautiful part of our world and deserves enough time to be fully appreciated. Therefore, I would suggest at least five days for your Great Ocean Road tour.\n\nCan You Do the Great Ocean Road in One Day?\n\nYou can, but then you won’t have seen much or got much out of the experience. There are day trips from Melbourne which drive tourists to the main attraction on the Great Ocean Road. But can you really say you’ve been on the Great Ocean Road by only seeing the 12 Apostle? This is one of the most stunning road trips one could do in their lifetime, so I would advise taking some time and factoring in a day or two more. Five days on the Great Ocean Road sounds ideal to me.\n\nWhere Should I stay When Visiting the Great Ocean Road?\n\nThe Great Ocean Road has many accommodation options available along the way. However, I personally found hotels very expensive. Private accommodation often surpassed the costs of a hotel room. There are some rundown motels and hard-to-reach hostels, especially along the Cape Otway area. I, therefore, suggest making towns such as Lorne or Port Campbell your base for a day or two and then exploring the Great Ocean Road from there.\n\nThanks so much for reading. Do get in touch if you need help planning your Great Ocean Road tour or have done the trip in the past.\n\nIf you enjoyed the post and would like to support my blog & research, you can do so via Buy Me a Coffee.\n\nTill next time,\n\nCarolin\n\nMore solo travel stories from Australia:"
