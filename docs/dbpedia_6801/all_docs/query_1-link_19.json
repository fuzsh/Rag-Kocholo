        "text": "There are many days when The Who are my favorite band of all time. Yes, The Beatles had them beaten in the consistency department (not least because they had three great songwriters to the one for The Who). Yes, The Rolling Stones were at or near the top of their game longer and for more albums than The Who, and their late-period touring had more \"respectability\" than The Who's had in many ways. And yes, I have an obsession with both Yes and Genesis, and with top-notch prog rock in general that a lot of people would consider disturbing. Yet for all of the little nit-picking I could do (much of it very justifiable, I might add), my love for the band is undeniable, and while some might dismiss this as just me following in the footsteps of others, giving them a ***** is as close to a no-brainer as I could imagine.\n\nThe funny thing is, there was a long time where I thought I hated The Who, and I tended to notice that the band didn't get that much respect in general. Sure, Rolling Stone has always regarded them as the third band in the great British triumvirate (the other two, obviously, are The Beatles and The Rolling Stones). And sure, they have always gotten a ton of radio play, especially since Who's Next is probably one of the three most played albums on classic rock stations (the others are Dark Side of the Moon and Led Zeppelin IV). Yet, alas, the majority of my generation has seemed to take a more cynical view of them, and part of why I know this is that, until less than a year before I started my website, I was one of those people. Based on all I had read and seen and heard about them, my opinion of them was basically such: they were that band with the big-nosed guitarist that only knew how to play two or three chords and had written that annoying \"Pinball Wizard\" song. They played abnormally loud and would jump all over the stage and break their instruments to disguise the fact that they really had very little in the way of talent, and this was the only way they could entertain. Eventually, they had gotten into using synths a lot, which they used to write horrifically overblown pieces before their drummer died, after which they turned to crap, broke up, and kept reuniting to suck more money away from gullible ex-hippies. I think that about covers it.\n\nAs I eventually tried to give them more of a serious shot, though, I soon realized that the band had three traits that couldn't help but guarantee them a place as one of my favorite bands of all time:\n\n1. An extremely high level of playing/performing talent at every position. This apparently isn't as blindingly obvious as I once thought, as there are plenty of people who have been willing to argue with me on this point, but to me it's just oh so true. For starters, while it may seem at first listen that he was just rather sloppy, I can't help but still consider Keith Moon as close to the greatest rock drummer ever. His playing was almost pure catharsis, with insanely fast and powerful bashing and crashing all around his 16 drum set, giving The Who a dimension that a normal drummer couldn't have even come close to providing. Yet he had a clear sense of rhythm as well; I can think of very, very few cases where, in the course of bashing around, he ever undermined the rhythm of the song. The man had a natural knack for implying the rhythm of a song, even when he wasn't explicitly setting it. And he (almost) never played drum solos! Rather, he treated his drums as a lead instrument at all times, a critical helpmate to the riffage and the bass lines.\n\nAnd how about those bass lines anyway? Intensely melodic, yet powerfully driving notes were the forte of John (The Ox) Entwistle, the greatest rock bassist who ever lived. Yeah, that's right, all you Geddy Lee fans out there, I said the greatest. It is only a tribute to Entwistle that almost every single studio albums The Who ever released has been called one of the top 5 bass albums by some major music publication or another. And I can't dispute any of them! It is possible to contend that he wasn't the most technically proficient bassist ever (though even that is very dubious; watch footage of him in action if you have doubts), but he chose his notes better than I can really express (and after all, in the end, an instrumentalist is only as good as the notes he plays). But John was not just a terrific instrumentalist; no, he was also one of the finest backing vocalists in the business for almost 15 years. If nothing else, he was amazingly versatile as a support vocalist, whether he was harmonizing, chipping in a falsetto (which he did disturbingly well) or using one of his \"funny\" voices, and he could always be counted on to keep the audience entertained.\n\nMeanwhile, although this would have seemed totally improbable in 1965, lead singer Roger Daltrey distinguished himself as one of the greatest vocalists of the 70's, putting on amazing performances for short singles and epic grandiose projects alike. He sang loudly, yet clearly; he growled, and yet could, on occasion, show great tenderness when he had to. In other words, basically anything that was asked of him, any interpretation that he or another felt should be made, he could deliver in ways that continue to boggle my mind. And, unlike his contemporary, Robert Plant, his voice got better, not worse, as the years went by (although it somewhat gave out in the 80's and 90's, but that's still far longer than Robbie lasted). He didn't have the most spectacular range of major 70s vocalists, but for POWER, Daltrey is my main bet.\n\nAnd last, but certainly not least, was guitarist/expert-noisemaker/occasional lead vocalist Pete Townshend. I can honestly say that, if I were given the gift to play guitar like any one person, it would be to play like Pete, who is, on many days, my favorite guitarist of all time. Yes, compared to some of his contemporaries, his soloing abilities weren't spectacular from a technical perspective (though he could occasionally come up with some solos that would put Jimmy Page to shame; ok, that's hyperbolic, but a little hyperbole never hurt anybody). Yet he was one of the greatest rhythm guitarists in the history of rock, and I'd dare say that none, save possibly Keith Richards, were able to pound out clever riffage with the power and ease that Pete was able to. And, when he would choose to stretch out, he had as much talent at interweaving interesting, powerful and emotional guitar lines with his riffage as I could only imagine, and as such he is responsible for many of my favorite guitar parts ever. Plus, let's not forget his historical importance as a guitarist, either: he's often cited as the one who discovered guitar feedback, back in 1963, well before Syd Barrett or Hendrix or The Beatles with I Feel Fine. And, of course, he had a really good voice (very different from Roger's, and a good balance), and he was primarily responsible for the band's second great trait:\n\n2. Fantastic songwriting. Pete Townshend was a songwriting genius, pure and simple. He was remarkably diverse in what he produced, too, both on the song and on the album level; he excelled with songs both short and long, soft and loud, and there's something to be said for the fact that, by the end of the 70's, the band was amongst the forefathers of both punk rock and art rock. He also had a wonderful sense of how to properly use synths, realizing in the early 70's that they could be used just as effectively for texture and for counterpoint (not in the pure technical sense, but as a foil for the other melodies) as they could for wanking around. Although he became tired of the group as the years went on, and his songwriting became more erratic, he still had the ability to pull out a good tune, even if he didn't always give them to the rest of the group (I'm in particular looking at their last two albums) and saved them for himself. But I ramble. For you see, Townshend eventually getting sick of The Who and probably trying to sabotage their reputation is an example, albeit somewhat negative, of the third trait that makes the band such a favorite of mine:\n\n3. Distinct, interesting, and barely compatible personalities in each member. This group was almost always about 20 minutes from self-destructing, and Daltrey practically made a career out of punching the lights out of his bandmates, producers, and various hangers-on. More often than not, though, this was actually beneficial for the group, as Pete had the ability to channel his frustrations into his songs, which added an even more human dimension to his work. Meanwhile, they were all, at heart, rock-and-rollers, or to be more accurate, punk-rockers (come on, don't EVEN tell me that \"I Can't Explain\" and \"My Generation\" aren't at the core of proto-punk) . All the cliches of the punk movement (smashing instruments on stage, trashing every hotel room, living horribly debauched lives) were, if not started by these guys, then taken to ridiculous extremes that made them legends in their own time. Heck, they were banned for life from Holiday Inn in '66 or '67 when, for Moon's 21'st birthday, they managed to get a car (I believe it was a Volkswagen Beatle) into the 5th floor swimming pool. A time before that, Moon got completely drunk and dove into a empty pool head first, and there are a zillion other stories of this type. If you have any, I would love it if you, the reader, would send me some.\n\nBut that is not why you have hit this page. You're here for the albums, and so, without further ado, \"Ladies and gentleman, a nice rock and roll band, from Sheperd's Bush London, The 'Oo.\"\n\nBarry Allen Schnorr (bas29.cornell.edu)\n\nI have to agree with your general evaluation of the Who. I had a similar bad first impression from the radio and from the first 2 albums I heard, which happened to be Face Dances and By Numbers. I'd ask, \"Why such short, dippy songs? Where's the _science_?\" and dismiss them with a remark of \"feh\" and a swat from the back of my hand. And I liked Elton John's remake of Pinball Wizard better than the original.\n\nIt takes a little while for the appeal of simple but well-done riffing to catch on (to me, anyway, maybe I'm just slow). In terms of writing, Townsend was up there with Keith Richards, BUT with a much more talented rhythm section (and vocalist, for that matter) to back him up. I think that calling Moon the greatest drummer of all time is a bit of a stretch. He did not make his drumming stand out--not as if that's strictly a bad thing, because it gets annoying if drummers crave attention so much that they insist on stupid drum solos, for instance--but nothing about Moon's playing really stands out from my point of view. (Maybe he was better live.) Otherwise, excellent explanation of why the Who was so good.\n\nBut...what's this nonsense about suggesting the Beatles may have been thebest rock band of all time? Have you been brainwashed by the Beatle troopers? Just because they were popular doesn't mean YOU have to like them. The Bee Gees were pretty popular too.\n\nMarylin Johnson (MJohn59958.aol.com)\n\nI have enjoyed listening to the Who since high school (Can't Explain). During my college years, my boyfriend's (now my husband) roommate had the album Tommy and I loved to listen to it when a guest in their apartment ( I bought the album myself quite a few years later). The song Won't Be Fooled Again was very timely when it was released in the '70's ( I was doing my student teaching in an urban high school at a time of social turbulence and the song struck me as being both inciteful and satiric). Behind Blue Eyes impressed me as a beautiful and soulful song. My favorite Who albums are Tommy and Who's Next.\n\nButton8950.aol.com\n\nI just wanted to say thanks for all the reviews. I'm a new Who fan, and there are so many good albums I didn't know where to start. These reviews really helped, just to see what one person has to say. Thanks!\n\nPierre Robert (probert.lure.u-psud.fr)\n\nFew words.\n\nFirst, please forgive my bad english, my excuse is : I am French (nobody's perfect).\n\nI recently took a look on your page about the WHO. To the old fan that I am (I'm 43) it was like a pomade on my heart reading your words. Definitely yes, the WHO were (and still are to my very own regard) the greatest rock band all over the world.\n\nFour members, each one so different with the others and so brillant in his own part, could provide in a grace's state several monuments of rock music that still make references today (for exemple : Tommy, live at Leeds, who's next, meaty beaty big & bouncy, quadrophenia, ^Å).\n\nAbout these four members there is so much to say that you already know, let's do shortly.\n\nRoger DALTREY, amazing singer, deep and loud voice but also delicate, enormous charisma.\n\nJohn ENTWISTLE, a bass virtuoso, a stone to hang on up to on stage that garanty the equilibrium of the whole thing.\n\nKeith MOON, a very own caracter himself, the greatest rock drummer I ever heard.\n\nPete TOWNSHEND, so intelligent, a pure genius.\n\nI saw them several times on stage. Oh boy I remember each one, it was amazing performances and surely the best rock shows I ever saw until now. I'd like to say so much more but my english is not enough good.\n\nBravo for right comments on the WHO. Long live rock!\n\nRobert Grazer (xeernoflax.jack-the-ripper.com)\n\nFor a long time I had a debate with myself on who was the most overrated band in the history of rock music. Although many 90s bands are pretty overrated, I firmly believe (and hope) that in thirty years or so that no one will care or remember about crap like Nirvana or *Nsync. So to find the most overrated band we must look in the past. U2 is pretty overrated, but still too recent. So I looked even further back. Look what I found, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, and The Who. Well, I can immediately dismiss the Beatles because not liking them is either extremely close-minded or downright inhuman. So, we are left with The Who and The Rollong Stones. It ends up being that the Rolling Stones are more overrated as far as musical qality goes and The Who is more overrated as far as talent with their instruments goes.\n\nThe Who proves that the term \"greatest (insert rock instrument here) ever\" no longer means the one who has the most talent with their instrument. I mean Kieth Moon is a decent drummer, but he can't touch Jayson Sherlock, John Rutsey or Billy Cobham but the who is more popular than those other bands there so we'll ignore the simple fact that there are plenty of drummers better than Kieth Moon and blindly slap the title of the greatest ever on the drummer for one of our favorite bands.\n\nAnd John Entwistle as the greatest bassist of all time!? COME ON! I can name five off of the top of my head who are better: Steve Harris, Greg Lake, Chris Squire, Rick Laird, and even Geddy Lee. But we like The Who better than Yes, ELP, Mahavishnu, or Rush, so we'll give the title of best bassist to Mr. Entwistle. Give me a break!\n\nPete Townshend is a pretty good guitar player, but I wouldn't dream of putting him on the top 10 guitarrists. I mean he doesn't deserve to be up there with Keaggy, Becker, Howe, McLaughlin, or about a dozen or so 80s metal guitarrists I could probably list, but I won't.\n\nOk, now that I have finished that little speech there, I would like to say two things. First, I have not heard EVERY song that The Who has ever done so if any feels the need to, feel free to send me the names of a few songs where The Who's talent is shown and If I've heard them I'll reply and if I haven't, I get a copy of the song and then reply. Only if you want to, I really don't care much. But also get a copy of the song \"One Word\" by The Mahavishnu Orchestral; it makes Moon and Entwistle look bad.\n\nSecond is that as far as good songwriting goes, The Who really isn't too bad. Although I've never cared much for some of their hits like \"Squeeze Box\" or \"My Generation\" and \"Magic Bus,\" they've got some classics like, of course, \"Won't Get Fooled Again\" and \"Christmas.\" Plus, Tommy is one of the greatest album I've ever heard.\n\nSo The Who isn't the most overrated band of all time, but they're up there. I don't hate them, but sometimes I grow tired of everyone loving them so.\n\n(author's note): THIS is not going unanswered. First of all, Robert is right about one thing - I do NOT define \"best ever\" as \"person with the most talent.\" Raw, God-given talent is vastly important, but it is not the criterium I use. My criteria are essentially as follows (sure, there are others, but they can all essentially be written as permutations of the following):\n\n- How much does the performer contribute to the enjoyment of the listener in the context of any given song? In other words, how entertaining is it to listen to one of his parts?\n\n- How important is he to the general sound of the group, and would the nature of the group be altered beyond repair without him?\n\nIf we use these as our requirements, then both Moon and Entwistle slaughter the competition you have brought up. (Well, if you consider complexity and speed of the parts your sole requirement, maybe they don't, but I often dig subtlety. I mean, Steve Hackett is one of my favorite guitarists, and nobody would accuse him of being able to take on Howe in a shred-fest). Both Squire and Lee are high on my list (but Greg Lake? Come on!!), but part of the reason is that they are always mixed very high and as such it is easy to focus on them. John was almost always content to not be the central figure of any given song, but take him away from almost ANY Who song, and you will feel the difference. And, as one astute commentator on the Starostin site pointed out, John was the force that kept the Who's live act from descending into complete chaos. Pete and Keith would be doing whatever, and John would always be able to bridge the gap between them to keep the sound coherent.\n\nAnd as for Moon, well, could you possibly imagine the rollicking sound of The Who without Moon? The man's ability to drum around and through the beat without, again, falling into complete chaos was equalled only by Bill Bruford (my co-number one).\n\nAs for Pete, well, I will admit that it's hard to really get a grasp for what he's doing on any given studio record, as the band always went for a more quiet, subtle approach. Only on an acoustic paradise like Tommy do things really become clear. But that's why we have albums like Leeds and Wight. In both cases, but especially on Wight, Pete absolutely annhilates the listener with the simultaneous crispness and enormous volume of his riffing. And even though he could never solo like a madman, his solos almost ALWAYS fit into the songs perfectly and controlled the tension and mood of the song in such a way as to floor whoever heard it (the best example is his work on the Wight version of We're Not Gonna Take It.)\n\nSo, yeah. Somebody can have all of the talent in the world, but if they don't entertain me at all, I couldn't care less.\n\nThought09.aol.com\n\nI sent a couple of emails that kinda disagreed with you on a couple albums, but I don't want to come of as a total jerk. I absoultely love your opening paragraphs on the site explaining why the who are underappriciated in our era. Wonderful writing I loved it. Also, I agree w/ you completely on your comments to that prog-rock obsessed guy about the who as musicians....You kick ass...\n\n(author's note): To quote the great Kevin Spacey, \"I rule!\"\n\nLONG LIVE THE WHO! Daniel\n\nRobert Grazer (xeernoflax.jack-the-ripper.com)\n\nOk now, after such a vicious author's note (although I was a little on the hostile side too), I feel obligated to respond. You gave your criteria for the title of greatest and that gives me a somewhat better understanding of where you are coming from. But the title of greatest to me has always been a statement of a fact. For example, Billy Cobham is a better drummer than Kieth Moon. But from there the opinion enters the picture. You enjoy Kieth Moon's drummming more than Billy Cobham's. At times I'd agree with that. But then (to me at least) the title is no longer who is the greatest, it is who is your favorite. Another example would be the fact that John Enwistle is not as good of a bassist as Steve Harris. But then the opinion is that you like Entwistle's bass playing better than Harris'. Then the second thing you have brought up is how important are they to the sound of the group. Again, this is opinion. Entwistle may be a vital part of The Who's sound, but there are probably those out there who think that he takes away from the sound and overall quality of the group. (Hey, there's always one or two who thinks like that.) I again compare him to Steve Harris. Harris make great contributions to Iron Maiden, his sound is necessary for the band (not to mention his songwriting) to always feel like Iron Maiden. But is he as important to Iron Maiden as Entwistle is to The Who? You'd say no because you are a huge fan of The Who, but I bet there are some huge Iron Maiden fans who could debate Harris vs. Entwistle with you for hours. The same goes for Lee and Squire.\n\nA personal example of these points I could make would be my opinions of David Gilmour. I love the guy's guitar playing and I doubt anyone could fit the Floyd sound better than he does. He would easily fit on to my top 10 favorite guitarists. However, although he has had a few great solos, he could never compare to the talent of John McLaughlin. Therefore he does not deserve a position on the top 10 best guitarists.\n\nAs for blending in and not being \"the central figure of any given song,\" it never bothered me when Lee and Squire have emphasis put on them. I mean, what are guitar solos for anyway? To let the guitarist have the spotlight for a portion of the song. The same goes for drum solos, bass solos, flute solos (i.e.Thick as a Brick) and violin solos. Hey, I can even sit for nine and a half minutes enjoying Jason Becker showing off in \"Speed Metal Symphony.\" The point is that I really don't mind the focus on a single member of the band unless they are terrible at their instruments and are playing crap.\n\nI guess I've made a little too much fuss for what I consider to be a poor choice of words. But I hope that this helps follow up the things I have said.\n\nNOTE: About Greg Lake, while I am really impressed with his work on \"Only Way,\" a few more listens to Quadrophenia showed me that I was in error whe I said he was better than John Entwistle.\n\ndidier Dumonteil (dbdumonteil.wanadoo.fr)\n\nI think that you've got a lot of nerves to mention the Who in the same breath as the Beatles.THe Who's music hasn't that much worn well ,compared to that of the Byrds of the Velvet and even the Stones ..\n\nAnd to deny the white album and Abbey Road a 10 is unbearable.\n\n(author's note): Boy, you'd think that writing the explanation of the ratings in giant, bold capital letters would have done the trick. Guess not.\n\nFrankly,sport,the Who can't be compared with LMc,Dylan,Wilson,Reed , Young .\n\nOutside the Who and Jethro Tull (who cares nowadays anyway) a nice site!\n\nKeith Neely (keith213.webtv.net)\n\nThe Who were an embodiment of the true spirit of rock and roll. The first real punks. One only needs to listen to \"My Generation\" to hear the brashness, attitude, ferocity and rebelliousness of their music. These guys had REAL attitude.\n\nAside from that, they were fortunate enough to have one of the few absolute geniuses of rock and roll in Pete Townshend. The sheer amount of quality music the guy has written is staggering.\n\nWhen future generations ask \"What was Rock and Roll?\", they will only have to watch a tape (or whatever they will be using) of The Who on a good night.\n\nI could go on and on about the talents of the individual band members, particular tracks and albums etc., but that would take entirely too long. I'll just say God Bless The Who, because I've had many a spiritual experience listening to their music. But you must check out \"Uneasy Street\" from Coolwalking-Best of Pete Townshend. Wow!! An absolutely dynamite and thought-provoking tune.\n\nI just want to briefly touch on this \"he's number one or he's not in the top ten bass/drum/ guitar\" bullshit. It's the diversity of the music and the players that make rock and roll such a beautiful and free form of expression. And besides, the first three simple, crashing chords in \"Baba O'Riley\" mean more than all the notes Malmsteen, Becker, MacAlpine and all those other shred-meisters ever played put together. That shit ain't even rock and roll!!!!\n\nPeace be with you all.\n\nRyan (Ryan.Kasper.colorado.edu)\n\nFirst and foremost, I would like to thank you for making it known that The Who are underappreciated. If we were to exist in some parallel dimension where The Who had never existed, this country would be further pussified (I use this word compliments of George Carlin) by such bands as N'Sync, Backside Boys, etc. The problem these days is (and maybe I'm just getting old... but I'm only twenty) that this country has absolutely no spirit anymore. Its like when you were in high school. You become jaded and you just stopped giving a shit. You just settled for the situation you were in and dealt with it (or, unfortunately you may go nuts and decide it would be a good idea to shoot some people). My point here is that this country seems to be settling for Pussified nonsense and cheap imitations. It thrills me to death that Pearl Jam are performing Who songs, and Eddie Vedder and Pete Townshend have played together. Because I like Pearl Jam and I think they have integrity, I will buy and grow to like anything they come out with.\n\nEnough about that. I enjoy the fact that you base your reviews on some requirements that may seem quite subjective as far as interperetation goes. I mean honestly, who wants to hear some ass that rates everything \"objectivley\" based on a list of requirements someone else has made. Bravo! I like your take on this stuff. This is the best question a critic can ask: Is this stuff meaningful to me? Nice work on keeping it real in this department. One can review computers objectivley, but interpretation of music is lost when one attempts such blasphemy.\n\nAnother thing. I am also not a Beatles fan per se. I mean I like the stuff I've heard, but it never really grabbed anything inside of me that made me cherish any work in particular. The way Quadrophenia sends you on an emotional rollercoaster through teenage life is what attracted me to it when I was 14. And it still applies to me. It always will. Can you help explain to me why they receive more praise today? Are there songs I absolutely must listen to? Is there any way in hell they have the same creative genius and manpower as Pete Townshend alone? Not to mention the other three members of The Who. Just wanted to get another point of view on this stuff.\n\nThe music of The Who expresses more emotionally, spiritually and ideologically than anything I've ever heard. Additionally, it is my belief that The Who are the band that originated rock as we know it today (and I am referring to real rock, and punk too). Any evidence against this? I know The Who had influences too, but their impact in my eyes is astounding. Nice job on the page.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRyan Kasper\n\nJohnnyB8.aol.com\n\nWow! What a great reveiew on this band. The Who, Beatles, and the Hendrix Experience are my favorite groups of all time, and i have heard every album ever made by each group (and what a bore it was to sit through Band Of Gypsies , but whatever. BTW, I know that that isn't the Experience). I found no flaws in your special paragraph. I would, however like to respond to the comments from Mr. Robert Grazer. Mr. Grazer, i do realize that the Who is overrated, but you cant overlook their talent because of it. I mean, next to Lennon/McCartney, Townshend is probably the greatest songwriter of all time. Yeah, i know all you Stones fans are going to throw Jagger/Richards at me, but they are a couple of feet behind Townshend. Mr. Grazer, why dont you grab a copy of Who's Next, Who By Numbers, or Live at Leeds (probably the greatest live album ever, although they did cut out all of the Tommy performance except for Amazing Journey-Sparks) or howabout......oh yes....you all know what i'm talking about.......QUADROPHENIA!!! So, thats all that i have to say until the next review.\n\nrichard (richard.dpbayley.freeserve.co.uk) (11/12/01)\n\nThere is not much too add to what has already been said. Certainly never has so much talent been packed into a band. They never used filler fodder on their albums. Everything meant something. The best who track ever? 'Won't Get Fooled Again' live at Shepperton Studios from The Kids Are Alright CD.\n\nJared Lentz (ddjlentz.hotmail.com) (11/25/01)\n\nHi! I really enjoyed reading your Who album opinions! I was a lot like you at first- didn't really get into the Who until I listened to them for a while. I have always thought Led Zeppelin to be the best band ever, but I have second doubts now- the Who are just simply amazing. I think the deluxe edition of Live at Leeds makes the album nothing short of a 10 rating. That is the absolute best record, ever. Pete can really put out his power chords and even go off on a nice solo. His notes have so much bite to them. It's hard, bone-crunching music but its amazing how polished and bright it is at the same time. It is never grungy or muddy. It's fantastic.\n\nKevin Saliba (raylomas.euroweb.net.mt) (5/24/02)\n\nHi John,\n\nI am a great fan of The Who and of The Beatles (among many others).\n\nI found a comment on The Who unofficial offical site. It states the following:\n\n\"Let's get one thing straight right now: Paul McCartney---the most innovative bass player EVER. John Lennon---more intellectual and acidic than Pete Townshend ever could have been. George Harrison---the third best songwriter in the Beatles and yet wrote better stuff than Townshend did. Ringo Starr---the best rock drummer ever. He didn't have to show off to make his point---he served the songs. Four hundred years from now, people will still be discussing the Beatles and their impact on music, society, etc. The Who will be a footnote. Think about it, lads---there wouldn't even BE a Who without the Beatles.\"\n\nI won't go into details, but I just have to point out that these statements are among the most stupid comments I ever read. Anyway, what do you think about this dork? (this might be a good topic for your 'lengthy debate page\").\n\n(author's note): I think this is basically overreacting. The Beatles are the greatest group ever, imo, but that doesn't make them the be-all/end-all of greatness. To me, this is the kind of overreacting that causes people to cultivate anti-Beatles biases in the first place.\n\nJeff Rosenthal (JeffR714.comcast.net) (8/13/02)\n\nBARRY\n\nTHE BEATLES ARE CREAM OF THE CROP FOR SURE THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT BUT IF I HAD TO PICK BETWEEN THE ROLLING STONES AND THE WHO I WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH THE WHO I'M 38 BUT STARTED LISTENING TO THE WHO AT 12 YEARS OLD (BELIEVE IT OR NOT) AND THAT WAS 1975 JUST AFTER THE WHO BY NUMBERS WAS RELEASED WHICH BY THE WAY IS HAILED AS A CLASSIC WHO PIECE AS FAR AS \"THE BAND ITSELF IS CONCERNED\"\n\nBUT THEN YOU HAD THE CLASSIC QUADROPHENIA! BY THIS TIME I WAS TRADING ALBUMS WITH THE OLDER GUYS IN THERE MID TO LATE TWENTIES AND I REMEMBER GOING OVER TO THIS GUY THAT LIVED AROUND THE BLOCK I FORGET WHAT WE WERE TRADING FOR BUT HE PUT QUADROPHENIA ON AND HAD SAID JEFF THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS I EVER LISTENED TO OF COURSE BEING SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR WITH THE WHO I SAID MAKE ME A COPY AND THRU ALL THE YEARS SINCE THE HAVE BEEN SECOND FAVORITE...I'M LISTENING TO TALES FROM THE WHO WHILE I'M TYPING ANOTHER CLASSIC THAT WAS RELEASES UNDERGROUND IN RED & BLUE VINYL ALL I HAVE IS THE SILVER CD....BUT THE WHO\n\nFABULOUS, AMAZING, TIMELESS.....JEFF ROSENTHAL\n\nPeter Wingert (pwingert.wscu.com) (9/24/02)\n\nI had the pleasure of growing up, listening to the \"OO since the early sixties, when they were competing with early Stones and the sound of the day that was the Beatles.\n\nI fell in love with their singles like Can't Explain, My Generation, Pictures of Lily. In fact all the songs from Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy are probably their best material.And so I thought until I heard Live at Leeds. The bombastic drumming and heavy three chord work of Townsend and steady rythmic basslines of the Quiet One opened my eyes to the live act. The Who visited my town in '68 and never again till 1980 when I saw them.I caught them in Chicago in December 1979, not long after the disaster in Cincinnati. The show is videotaped on Maximum R &B. If you look closely directly to the left of the stage, thirty rows back, that's me dressed in a suit. I just flew into town two hours earlier on a business trip. Five concerts later, they remain my all time favourites. I love these guys.\n\nPurpIeStain.aol.com (2/26/03)\n\nThe Who is the best band to come out of Britain. Yeah the stones are ok, Zeppelin rocks, and we all know that the Beatles changed rock. But Tommy is the best album I have ever heard. The members of the Who are musical geniuses. They are totally overlooked and underplayed on the radio and its really a shame to deprive everyone of their music.\n\nI love the Who. Wish I could have seen them live.\n\nThats what I think about them.\n\nPS cool site\n\njohn hildebrand (luckyluke.ihug.co.nz) (9/30/03)\n\nSettle down mate you are going a bit to far, sure The Who are a good band but to start screaming there 'the greatest\" this and \"the best that\" is a bit over the top. And its no reason to say there better than others, \"The Who\" preform great together and that is what makes tham a good band, you can't shout out things just because thats the way you feel, compare Roger daltrey to Jim Morrison , Robert Plant , Ozzy , Roger Walters , Chris Cornell. Can you compare them. . . . . . . . no you cant because there all completly different singers from different era's. You say you've been listening to \"The Who\" for a year now, so how long will it be before you find youre next craze and start a new web site and saying how great they are.Look im a who fan as well but i think Pete Townshend will even tell you they wornt quite the greatest. And hey I dont mean to hack you down, I see you have some good taste in music.\n\nHowell (l.howell.ntlworld.com) (11/17/03)\n\nYour site asks, what do we think of The Who?\n\nQuite simply...the greatest rock 'n' roll band in the world.\n\nEnough said.\n\nLoved the site, many thanks\n\nDave Howell\n\nAngelmo645.aol.com (4/29/04)\n\nThe Who....hmmm....what can I say what hasn't already been said before?\n\nI freakin' worship these guys. I love their music, I love their personalitites, I love them despite every one of their flaws as a band (and believe me, there are plenty!).\n\nAlthough each band member was important in their own way, I mainly direct my thanks towards Mr. Pete Townshend. I believe that the word \"genius\" is overused these days, so instead I want to thank Pete for what he is: a complex, complicated, sensitive, arrogant, stubborn, talented, spiritual, beautifully flawed human being and artist. His music had gotten me through some of the difficult and lonliest times of my life. Until I discovered The Who, I don't think there was any kind of music out there that I could truly relate to. Pete writes about important things like the lonliness and frustration of adolecence, he writes on a spirtitual level and although it can come off as pretentious at times, most of the time I find it beautiful and exhilerating.\n\nLong live Pete and long live THE WHO\n\n\"MikeCalla\" (mikecalla1975.yahoo.ca) (11/23/04)\n\nYou may or not put this up on your site but I had a good time writing it - very cathartic  thank you... Stating the obvious now would be redundant. So I will state what I know. You could pick hundreds - nay thousands of musicians far more capable than any member of The Who. But that is not what music about. If it were, I would never listen to a pianist other that Oscar Peterson. Or listen to a drummer other that Buddy Rich. Or a composer other than Bach. The list could go on, and on.  No, I listen to music to invoke a sense of emotion, whether it is elation or wonderment, or whatever. Of course we can listen to the mechanics of a musician, or song and pick it apart, but we can also listen for those little quirks and mistakes that remind us that some musicians are not THE best - but human. The first time I heard Live At Leeds (the original, six song album) I thought  this is what rock and roll is supposed to be. I am 29 now, but I heard that album before I was 10. I didnt give a damn how good or bad the bands musicianship was. At that time I couldnt differentiate if Keith Moon was better or worse than Ringo Starr, but I swear I knew Keith made me feel different  in a good way. I liked how that album made me feel. Visceral. Made my hands turn into fists. Made my eyes squint when Pete would hang a chord and it would slowly but surely breath fire as feedback. And you what know what, it invokes that response in me to this day. Sure I get other fantastic  awe inspiring responses from other musicians  i.e.; the beauty of Debussys Clair De Lune or a Billie Holiday throaty impersonation of liquid butter. Throw in a Steve Howe lick and I have my Stranded On An Island Collection. But that is what music is supposed to do. Kudos to John for a damn good essay on his love for a band, I wish there were more sites like this!!\n\nNow here come my opinions and contradictions. The Who? Best band ever? Yep!! Seeing Pete and John play live was like no other concert experience - and Ive been to tons!!!  seen them all - new bands  old classic rock bands  jazz bands etc, etc, hell I even saw Oscar Peterson play a private concert in front of a dozen people. Any way . Now Ive seen both Pete and John as solo musicians and together as The Who. All I can say is wow. Very, very powerful, even in their golden years. I saw John, in a small club here in Toronto Canada. I stood at his feet. Im a bassist, so for me this was comparable to a one year long orgasm. My God that man was powerful. That bass was screaming from pain. He was running up and down that neck with such constrained reckless abandon - and then - so delicate at times I couldnt play bass for month. Once again visceral! Now for Pete  Now Im fairly young so my music tastes vary quite a lot  in high school I saw some seriously heavy b ands play live. Punk bands, metal bands and whole lot of others - Then I saw Pete play. I had seen him before; first solo  actually the first date of his first solo tour ever, mostly acoustic(still very powerful). Then I saw him do the Quadrophenia thing  my brother begged me not to go  he said Its gonna ruin it for you! And it did! They had like a dozen and a half musicians on stage. Horns, percussion, a whole lotta of other crap too. Not The Who I wanted to see. Then in Dec 2001, I believe, once again their last concert ever here in Toronto. I saw The Who I knew once existed. Granted Keith was not there, but growing up as a kid I realized I would never hear him live, but sadly John had just passed away. Too Bad. But Pete, Pete made up for it. He was possessed. That guitar was bending under his hands. I could see the neck warp under his power chords. That made all those young guitarists with all their rage and attitude seem like kittens- really, cute little kittens. They couldnt hold a candle to his emotion. Ive never seen anyone put that much passion in to their guitar. It was total commitment  maybe a glimpse of what it was like to see Moonie live.  Ahh I could write all day about this band  now I wanna go listen to them  maybe Live At Leeds  My Generation I think.\n\nSolomonsOther.aol.com (03/15/05)\n\nBehold... a great band with a ton of great songs. However, much like Genesis or Pink Floyd, the major problem lies in the question: Do you dig the early work or the later work? Are you in it for the hilarious 60s jingles or the heart-wrenching 'proggy' experiments a la Quadrophrenia? I'm ignoring Tommy because I own the Live at Isle of Wight 1970 DVD, where they play Tommy live. I had never heard the original studio album and when I bought it, I couldn't stand still because I missed the energy that was put into the live performances. But Quadrophrenia strikes me as somewhere on the border between Genesis's dark psychological parables (The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway) and Led Zepplin's cock-ballsy meanderings on.... well, anything that doesn't sound like Stairway to Heaven. I consider it to be their best 'rock opera,' though the best ALBUM per se would without a doubt have to be The Who Sell Out. Incomplete albums like Who's Next get on my nerves. Otherwise... a 5 star band all the way.\n\nSteeleAndDavid.cs.com (04/16/05)\n\nI haven't even read about the albums, but as a long-time Who lover, well, you pretty much took the words out of my mouth. Townshend's a lyrical genius, Entwistle is/was an insane vituoso, Moonie is/was beyond savant gifts and Daltrey has one of the most powerful and awesome voices in rock and roll. The Who are #1 always and forever!\n\nbob dufton (robert.dufton1.fsnet.co.uk) (09/25/05)\n\nHi, My group ' The Templars ' played many a support band to The Who in the mid 1960's, whenever they played ' Up North ' i.e. Warrington Co-op Hall,Parr Hall, Stamford Hall and lots more. I decided to buy a marshall amp. on the strength of this, and quickly had it top boosted, after hearing Pete, and also the Small Faces. who we also supported many times\n\nMy gretch guitar would stay on feed back forever,wow, bloody exciting in it's day, especially with my ' Sperrin Fuzz Box . !!\n\nMore nostalga 2 cum.\n\nBob.\n\nTIMOTHY MCCULLEN (tmccullen2004.yahoo.com) (10/12/05)\n\nEverybody is comparing Moon and Entwistle to other players in other bands.You have to remember, these two individuals invented their crafts, techniques ect. Everyone else just tried to model themselves around The Who. Even to me I thought The Who could blow any one off the stage, old and new! Especially Entwistle.\n\n\"McGruer, Chris\" (cmcgruer.owensound.library.on.ca) (02/11/06)\n\nWell, first and foremost I think we have to ackknmoledge that \"The Who\" were one of the BEST and GREATEST live acts to come out of the rock/pop genre.\n\nAlthough one may quibble about their studio recordings and wonder where they rank compared to other bands, after veiwing \"Live at the Isle of Wight\" there is no doubt that at the top of their game they kicked the beatles and the stones ass in the arena. They rank at the top of thec class for live bands and in my books this ranks them at the top of the heap in the rock pantheon.\n\nErik Jørgensen (erik.jorgensen.vip.cybercity.dk) (05/28/06)\n\nNice site and a well written essay with many good points. Listening to The Who was simply the defining moment in my life as a lover of music. Never had I heard such music. The most beautiful noise in the World.\n\nmark flanagan (mark.pelletizer.com) (09/03/06)\n\nMy admiration for the band runs in streaks. Sometimes I love them, yet it's not something I can sustain.\n\nMost bands I admire, even when I go through a stage of not listening to them, I always remain a fan. With The Who I either love them and hear their genius, or I can't stand them. It's weird.\n\nI have a hard time rating The Who vs Zeppelin. I feel The Who were a better band, but I'd rather listen to Zeppelin most of the time. Know what I mean?\n\nPlease don't go knocking Plant vs Daltry.\n\nIf all you have is daltry \"lasted longer\" than forget it. Plant just had something going for him. Despite all the campy mannerism's he had \"IT\" in a way Daltry could only dream of.\n\nPete Townshend, as you pointed out, had an amazing gift for being able to write songs, transcendental songs, for another person to sing. That's not easy.\n\nI agree that no single man outside of the Beatles could run with him in the rock music game.\n\nEntwistle and Moon were as good a rythym section as ever graced a rock stage. Again the competition seems to come from Zeppelin. John Paul Jones and John Bonham were also very good but I give an edge to The Who duo.\n\njames.malmstrom.ubs.com (01/13/07)\n\nOf course The WHO rule - agreed that they are deserving of the title the BEST ROCK 'N ROLL BAND IN THE WORLD. Your point that The WHO could reach highs that the Stones could only dream of is correct insofar as Townshend's songwriting, and their performances, from '67-1973 was and were absolutely untouchable. As for the greatest bass player debate please inform Mr. Grazer that evaluating bass players is best done by their peers. Bass Player magazine has always considered Entwistle the greatest of all-time. It's really not even that close. Moon? Brilliant and also untochable in the early years but his play suffered terribly near then end when he became a bloated, drunken shell of his former self.\n\nSkye Reding (LuvAndPeace2U.webtv.net) (03/30/07)\n\nGenerally I agree with everything you said about The Who. The Beatles have always held the most special place in my heart. I don't mind at all mentioning The Who in almost the same sentence. They were 2 different bands. I always thought it was awesome the way it appeared all these British groups from the time of the British Invasion- my very favorite time in history of music personally- all seemed to admire eachother. And applaud eachother's accomplishments. I remember being 7 years old - about 11 yrs after the release of My Generation and hearing it on the radio and instantly understanding that this was considered an edgy song in it's day! I LOVED it! I could easily understand-even at 7 years old- that The Who were influential to the punk scene. Which was barely any kind of a movement in certain parts of America at the time. I remember hearing Who Are You loving the \"who who who who\" part of the song. I may have been a little girl but I knew cool music when I heard it. My cousin and I loved to listen to I Can See For Miles. Singing the \" miles and miles and miles....\" part of the song much longer than we should have and thinking it was funny. Cut me some slack after that comment. We were little girls after all. And listening to The Who no less! We loved that song. Which made us pretty hip for our age when you think about it. Older more experienced girls still consider The Who too wild for them. The instrument smashing, hotel trashing, and sheer loudness of their music made The Who more of a man's band in many ways. Certainly not for little girls. The Who always seemed to be playing on the radio. Magic Bus became a song I'd recognise when the first chords of the music started. And I looked forward to it. I realised even at my young age at the time these 4 musicians from England were very important to music and it's history. That people would be talking about them for years and years to come. I was correct in that observation. And that's not bad for a little seven year old girl sitting in the kitchen listening to the radio before school. I consider kids from my generation pretty lucky even though I would gladly have been a teen in the early 60s or so. Kids my age still got to hear groups like The Stones, The Beatles, The Who on the radio and NOT on some classic rock station. Music today pales miserably by comparison. The musicians were amazing back then and The Who are proof of that. Keith Moon blows me away! I'm in awe of him. His facial expressions while he plays and twirls his drum sticks and moves his arms around like a wind mill. It's mesmerising. Just watch his performance in The Kids Are Alright on The Rolling Stones Rock-n-Roll Circus and you'll see what I mean! Pete Townsend's song writing is just phenomenal! An endless flow of music and lyrics must be going through his brain at all times and it comes to him with ease! I'm jealous is all I can say! He is second only to Lennon and McCartney in my book. John Enwistle. Gotta love the man for his demeanor onstage with the other 3 acting like they could all explode at any time. Despite his cool reserve onstage John always appeared as entertained by the other 3 showing off as the audience most likely was. Listen to John's playing on Sparks off the Tommy album and dig the man. He was a dedicated and talented musician and it showed! I admire him for that! Roger Daltrey voice is right next to Robert Plant in my opinion. You could feel the breeze from his voice blowing your hair back everytime you heard a Who song! It was that powerful! And the way Roger would swing his microphone around on stage and catching it in the nick of time with much ease still leaves me dumbfound and wondering how many times one of his band mates got clocked in the head when he first decided he was gonna do that little trick.\n\nWell, I could go on and on but I will quit here. The Who are in a class by themselves. Thanks for reading and letting me express my opinion about one of my favorite bands....\n\nKolby Kramer (gkkramer.gmail.com) (05/03/07)\n\nI hate to be the bearer of bad news, but contrary to what everyone thinks, Keith Moon DID play drum solos. And he was awful at them:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hngmb0pTcMY&mode=related&search=\n\nEesh, pots and pans, anyone?\n\nPatrick Dermody (pdermody.twcny.rr.com) (04/29/08)\n\nI just wanted to comment on what Kolby Kramer showed to prove. I'm no expert on drumming, but that video didn't seem too bad. He's banging the heck out of his kit and is making it very rhythmic and enjoyable. Just my opinion.\n\nScott Harrison (harrison_sw.msn.com) (10/05/08)\n\nJohn, first off I would like to say I absolutely love your site. I agree with a lot of your thoughts about Jethro Tull (also love Stand Up), Yes, ELP and The Who among others; other times, we aren't exactly seeing eye to eye (I personally love Benefit), but your thoughts are always great to hear. I would suggest early Allman Brothers, Phish, jam bands and jazz fusion and would love to hear your thoughts on those bands and genres. Now about The Who.\n\nFirstly, The Who are my favorite band. I have been seriously listening to music for a good four years now (I am 17), and The Who has always been among those groups I absolutely adore. I would also like to mention that I listen to a wide range of music, everything from rock, jam bands, jazz, prog and metal (a bit). it is not a matter of me not knowing what else is out there musically; in fact, i am always trying to find new music. so when I say that The Who are my favorite group, that is not mere adrenaline or underexposure. I feel there will never be a time when I am sick of hearing the music of Pete, Roger, Keith and John.\n\nI wouldn't give anything to see The Who circa 1964-1973; however, there is no doubt in my mind, that from 1969-1973 there was something The Who had that no other band had. It seems to me that in these five years there was absolutely nothing above these four musicians (much like the new york yankees from 1949-1953). many people will only rememeber joe dimaggio and yogi berra from those great yankee teams (seasoned baseball fans might recognize whitey ford). what made the yankees better in those five years? Chemistry. That is what the The Who had from 1969-1973. Even if they were not the best at their respected instruments, they were better as a respected whole than any other group during this period (A period which I would say amounts to 75% of what I listen to).\n\nGeorge Starostin has defended Keith Moon's drumming on his own site and on this site as well. His arguments in support of Keith's drumming allign with my own in many ways. I will not label Keith as the greatest drummer ever (Buddy Rich, Max Roach, Billy Cobham, Bill Bruford, Carl Palmer, Tony Williams among countless others I have a strong admiration and respect for have just as equal a claim to the greatest drummer). Again, is there a universal ideal for a drummer? This problem has been brought about in the posts above. If there is, then certainly Keith Moon must fall into that ideal (along with the aforementioned and countless others). However, if there is no ideal, then certainly Moon pushed the boundaries of what a drummer could do, paving the way for a new generation of drummers such a John Bonham, Neil Peart, Dan Carey and Mike Portnoy.\n\nTo me, the fact that no other drummer sounded that way in a Rock band (Buddy certainly had the flair in a jazz setting) up to that point in time confirms my attitude that Moon's playing is certainly groundbreaking. As a drummer, I feel that if one can easily copy another drummer's playing then that drumming is either not difficult or the student is extremely gifted. Nobody attempts to copy the styles of Rich, Cobham and Moon. It is virtually impossible. To me, that defines their drumming as exceptional. If Moon just copied Rich, Krupa and Roach; he would have sounded just like them. Instead, he developed his own style and truly transcended the standards of the day. Moon's pounding on the double bass is just as inventive today as it was in the 60's. If you listen to any generic metal band with their idiotic drummers wailing on the double bass, it sounds so foreign and alien. It lacks an understanding of groove, rythmn and melodicism. Never did Moon attempt to play in overdrive like these timekeepers- simply put he played with dexterity and quickness. Moon's double bass work has an understanding of groove, back beat and syncopation amid his chaotic attack. Some may argue he is out of control. I would say simply they do not understand what they are talking about. The mere fact that he can keep time and play in such a fashion, repeatedly and without exhaustion is a testament to his supreme control as a drummer. And yes, I will be the first to attempt that he couldn't play a drum solo to save his life, that video is just pots and pans.\n\nAnother sidenote, I would agree that there is a difference between a drummer's skill and his notoriety. Take John Bonham and Jon Fishman. Talk to the normal music fan about Bonzo \"Oh John Bonham!Yeah the guy was the greatest ever.\" The only reason he is considered the greatest is because he played for that semi- obscure underground unit known as Led Zeppelin. To my ears, Jon Fishman (Phish) is a better drummer than John Bonham. His skill matches Bonzo's and excedes it in every category with the exception of the volume he reaches. Bonzo pounded the hell out of the drums, Fishman plays with a skill and finesse- jumping from one style to another- that far outweighs Bonzo's merits. When you mention drummers, Fishman probably won't be discussed because most people have only heard of Phish through the delicious seafood creature or the Ben & Jerry's Flavor. I mean Moon is popular for the same reasons as Bonham, I am just using an example to show that there are amazing drummers all over the place and to say one is the greatest is pure stupidity.\n\nMoving on to John Entwhistle. I enjoy the man's playing. He invented the art of playing the bass guitar. However, I will admit that there are others that are just as fluid and dynamic of the bass (Jaco, Stanley Clarke, Wetton, Squire and Harris- having heard Stanley Clarke in person I have no doubts about his skill as a bassist). To me the ryhtmn section of Entwhistle and Moon made The Who, without them it seems like Roger and Pete noodling around going through the motions.\n\nFrom 1969-1973, The Who were the best Rock band. The Rolling Stones laid claim to the title, The Who however, played to the title. Their is an arrogance and swagger, yet a self-doubt and self reflection in their music. It has a spiritual context that is universal, which make it music to be listened to from here until the end. Add that to the fact the Pete Townshend was the Rock composer. His writing is unmatched in my eyes, from a musical and vocabulary standpoint (Rough Mix anyone?). The breadth of his work is remarkable. I have an utmost respect for this band and its leader, but also question them. I have no desire to see Roger and Pete in concert as The Who. None whatsoever. However, I would be willing to throw out $50 to see them playing as Peter Townshend & Roger Daltrey. What else do they have to prove as The Who? Wasn't 'Who Are You' enough?\n\nSSmith.swtimes.com (12/13/08)\n\nGreat writeup about The Who and Pete Townshend, but I have to peacefully, respectfully disagree. You say the Stones were at the top or near the top of their game longer than The Who? No way. The Stones' high point was from 1965 to 1972, ending with \"Exile.\" I have always felt that the two Mick Taylor records that followed were subpar, and as much as I love Ron Wood (I'm a bigger Faces fan), the Wood-era Stones is patchy with some good (Still Life and Steel Wheels) and overrated (the bulk of Some Girls, Black & Blue and all of Emotional Rescue). I feel The Who were at the top, from My Generation in 1965 to the mid-1970s, and they've always been at the top as a live band, even now. The best show I ever saw was The Who in 2000 (my first Who show) when John Entwistle was still alive. I have the CD of that show, amazing. Some of my friends think it's a boot of the 1975/76 tours, I kid you not.\n\nAnway, thanks for the writeup of The Who. I like the Stones too, it's just that for me, The Who is tops followe by The Beatles and Pink Floyd.\n\n\"caresm6\" (caresm6.wfu.edu) (11/13/09)\n\nYour Who page is already clogged with reader comments both adoring and disparaging, but Id really like to add my own thoughts to the mix (I hope you arent already exhaling in resignation). Ill preface all that follows with the specific disclaimer that Im only attempting to explore my own relationship with this band, not to argue with or knock anyone else for their opinions. Now then\n\nLike you, I come at the Who from a bit of a different perspective than many classic rock fans. When I first became seriously interested in music, my love for the Beatles and the Stones blossomed pretty much instantaneously and has only deepened over the years. But when it came to the Who, things werent so simple. (Sidenote: I don't believe this is related to my being female but, then again, Pete himself once pointed out that the Who are the rare '60s band who never had a fanbase predominantly made up of teenage girls!) I actually remember turning to my dad once and saying, Why do people always list the Who third? I like so many bands better than them.\n\nIm now in my early 20s and its only within the last year that Ive truly fallen in love with the Who. Ive had many of their albums since I was 14 or 15 and Ive always enjoyed them to some extent, but I just wasnt feeling /love/. Thats all changed. Im now quite proudly obsessed with them and rank them among my very favorite artists of all time, right alongside the Beatles and the Stones. Getting to this point was a strange journey.\n\nSince early high school, Ive had an insatiable musical appetite. As soon as I found the Beatles (age 14), that was it. I spent most of high school burning through all the Big GuysZeppelin, Pink Floyd, Yes, Dylan, Clapton, etc. etc. College was a different story. I became absolutely restless and went off the rails exploring everything from hardcore punk to alternative electronica. For a few years there, I didnt listen to much classic rock at all. I still counted the Beatles and the Stones as my favorite artists, but I rarely actually /listened/ to them. The thing was, this crazy musical journey of mine wasnt all that fulfilling. I was getting a huge knowledge and familiarity with a lot of different genres and styles of music, but it simply wasnt as soul-satisfying as those days when I was 16 and collecting every single Neil Young album and listening all the way through with lyrics-booklets spread out before me.\n\nAt 21, my insatiable musical appetite has led me right back to where I started: the iconic British Invasion bands who started it all. With a few exceptions, they are really the only artists I listen to who remain as rewarding today as they were the first day I heard them. And, much to my surprise, the Who suddenly make absolute sense to me. It was as though I had to grow into them. Its now crazy for me to listen to their catalog and remember that I used to feel quite lukewarm about them. How?! An album like Live at Leeds quite simply knocks my socks off these days. The Who possessed an amazing combination of incredible, powerful playing (especially live) and beautiful songwriting from Pete Townshend. Many other bands have had one or the other quality but Im not sure any band has ever combined the two so intriguingly and successfully.\n\nIt actually really interests me that so many commentators (on this site and in the general world of music criticism) gravitate towards discussing the band in terms of its individual players. Personally, I think folks can get so caught up in discussing the relative merits of Keith Moon versus other drummers or John Entwistle as a rhythmic anchor, that they overlook those things that are even more important: particularly chemistry. It wouldnt matter if Moon was the best drummer in the world or not if the band didnt have it, which they fortunately did.\n\nTo this point: critics love to compare the Who with Zeppelin on a player-by-player basis (Daltrey vs. Plant, Moon vs. Bonham, etc.). Through this method, some have come to the conclusion that Zeppelin was the superior band. For me, this logic is extremely faulty. Setting aside for the moment that I actually much prefer all Who members, especially Townshend to the often-sainted Page on guitar, since when was a bands greatness determined solely on the technical merits of its individual members? It isnt, or at least it shouldnt be.\n\nThe Who most certainly had a supremely talented player at all four positions, but they also excelled in many of the more intangible but even more important areas: wit, charisma, showmanship, innovation, emotional power and on and on. I recently watched The Kids Are Alright again and the band came off as just spectacularpractically vibrating with greatness in every single segment, barely holding it together and still managing to deliver over and over again. They were unique. They were intelligent and emotional. They were violent and out of their minds. They were extraordinary.\n\nFinally, this band possesses one quality that Ive come to appreciate more and more as the years have gone by and as Ive grown bored with some lesser artists: depth. The greats all have catalogs with rich and deep quality. You fall in love with them for the classic singles but you stick around for the deep cuts, rarities and album tracks. Pete, God bless him, made every record a complete statement worth listening to from start to finish. Its a quality this band shares with the Stones (the all-time great deep cuts band, for me). And its something that a band like Zeppelin lacks. Its also part of the reason Im getting antsy at the increasing trend for critics to move the Who down on their lists of all-time greats and move up everyone from Zeppelin to Nirvana to the Ramones (inferior bands all).\n\nI guess I just wanted to let you know that your Who reviews were a great touchstone for me. I read them back in the early 00s when I was first falling for music and appreciated your enthusiasm but somehow couldnt share it. Ive just re-read them and now Im right there with you leading the parade. The Who may not have immediately grabbed me as a 14 year-old scruff, but theyve been the soundtrack of my college years and I have no doubt that they will remain in my overall Top Five for the rest of my dayscompletely the equal of the Beatles and the Stones. So much of the music Ive listened to over the years was easy to like but just as easy to dismiss. For me, the Who have been the most rewarding challenge in my entire (huge) catalog.\n\nPete Townshend, wherever you are, thanks a million for never making it easy.\n\nAnd you, John, thanks for seeing the light much more quickly than I did and so eloquently shining that light on the band for many willing readers. Your dedication and passion have ensured that Ive regularly visited your site for almost a decade. :-)\n\n\"Alainna Earl\" (lainnakate.yahoo.com) (02/13/11)\n\nI was bored one day, and I was on Youtube and stumbled upon a song called, 'Here Comes The Sun.' I was just stuck to the chair. I looked up so many songs by the Beatles. I was, in no time at all, a Beatlesfreak. The Fifth Beatle. HippieLover. I fell in love with them. And not just them - there was the British Invasion. The 60s. Rock and Roll.\n\nI soon was learning everything you could know about John, George, Ringo and Paul. I know this is not the answer to what I think of the Who but it's an understanding of where I'm coming from.\n\nSee, I was a staunch defender of those Beatles. I thought no one was greater. They opened up the doors to contemporaries and opposities - all kinds of people.\n\nBut when I really got into the Who? Vh1 classics showed 'You Better You Bet'. I quickly looked it up and bought it because I loved the song. That and My Generation.\n\nBut even those were forgotten soon.\n\nSo what was it? When did I start to think and like the Who?\n\nWhy, Keith Moon is why! I consider him to be one of the greatest rock drummers, because he was no one else. Nobody sounded like Keith Moon. When you listen to a song, say ' Circles ', it feels complete in your ears. It sounds right and I just can't help wanting to move hearing A Who song. Keith Moon's name, I heard before. So when bored again on Google, his name I typed in. And when I learned he was with The Who! It was love at second listen. I bought a bunch of songs, most from their first album, which is probably one of my favorities.\n\nI am a new Who fan, and a new rock n roll fan. I've gotten to met Pete, whose intelligence and blunt honesty keep me reading the articles, word for word. Roger, who I admit I liked at first (However he is quite like Tommy sometimes, quiet and unaware), his voice is very much like thunder and I can feel it in me, especially on Tommy which I think was the best vocal period of his. John, is quiet but his personality offstage is quite the opposite; I respect him for being constant onstage when there was alot of chaos, (however I still think Paul McCartney is a damn great bass player; alot of those lines he played were exciting to me), but otherwise I have no idea the technical things that go into being a musician. My opinion is based on what sounds amazing, and if it touches me. The Who have pretty much taken the Beatles place as greatest but I never will forget that 'they came first'. However, Keith is better than Ringo and I don't give a damn if he's so ' sloopy '. Technical is very professional and nice but it becomes snooty after awhile.\n\nismaninb.gmail.com (01/13/12)\n\nAnybody who is serious about hardrock/heavy metal sooner or later comes across The Kinks (but only a handfull of songs) and The Who. So here are my two SRD, as this seems to be the place where the question \"who were the greatest?\" must be answered.\n\nAll arguments pro The Who are valid. I'm not even thinking of trying to refute them. No, my point will be that these arguments are not enough. And that means that I find myself in the luxurious position of disagreeing with both John McFerrin and Robert Grazer (Iron Maiden? Seriously?!).\n\nThe argument of Keith Moon adding to the compositions applies to Bonham, Bruford and Powell too. And they had better skills. It doesn't apply to that guy from Dream Theater though, even if I sometimes quite like that band. It doesn't apply to Neil Peart either. But Bonham and Powell overdid their trick, you say, while Moon didn't? Agreed. Try Ian Paice then, someone I learn to appreciate more and more as I get older. Relisten very carefully to the initial organ solo of Child in Time and be amazed how tasty, subtle, skilled and untrivial Paicey's rhythmical patterns are. Also we should realize that Paice managed to lift the slightly more generic songs to a higher level. Examples? Into the Fire, Maybe I'm a Leo. So I prefer Paice to Moon.\n\nThen there is Entwistle the modest but virtuoso guy. OK, Glover loses to him, mainly because he never got/grabbed the chance to excel, but not John Paul Jones. He did the same as Entwistle and did it better. Check The Lemon Song for this. Also Entwistle loses in the department of melodicity. I refer to Andy Frasier of The Free (Mr. Big) and Gary Thain of Uriah Heep (especially the outtake Why). Entwistle never did anything slightly similar to those.\n\nDaltrey versus Gillan in his prime is simply a non-brainer. Gillan could sing any Who song and David Byron probably could too. My Generation? Speed King. Some ballad? When a blind Man cries. Daltrey singing Child in Time? Space Truckin'? Exactly.\n\nTownshend the guitarest is hard to compare with Blackmore, as the latter was a pure solist and the first mainly a rhythm guitarist. There I have a problem, as I find rhythm guitar playing in general not so interesting. When it comes to accompanying I'd say both Page and Brian May beat Townshend, exactly because these two didn't limit themselves to rhythm play. In the riffing department Tony Iommi was the superior one - heck, his whole band hung on it. Also there are the classy riffs of Budgie's Tony Bourge. Both the main riffs of Tyrefitter's Hand (hyper minimalistic) and Breadfan (hyper complicated) are superior to everything Townshend ever presented - which is not enough to argue that these two songs are better in their entirety.\n\nTownshend the synthesizer guy I can't appreciate very much. Sure, the rather minimalistic approach of We won't get fooled again is great. Still never the feeling escapes me that that minimalism is the consequence of lack of skills. In other songs Townshend's synths mainly serve to create an atmosphere, which for me is synonymous with gluing a musical wallpaper.\n\nAs far as the rhythm combo goes - they never were as tight as Paice and Glover on Made in Japan. At the other hand that was never Moon/Entwistle's goal, so that doesn't count that much as an argument. This all still means that The Who can be regarded as one of the greatest bands ever, subjective considerations like emotional resonance aside. Dissecting the individual members is simply not enough. The Who at its best - and that is how I judge any band - is an excellent example of the sum being more than its parts. And I'm very much not sure if I can say that of any counterexample I brought up here.\n\nGus Gilbertson (Gus.gilcoscaffolding.com) (01/13/13)\n\nI started to read your material about the Who as my wife and I are about to see the QUADROPHENIA show here in Chicago & I see youre a fan of Yes & Genesis also.\n\nQuestion: Why is it so uncool to like progressive rock like the two major acts of the genre, Yes & Genesis nowdays? Its is uncool to like that kind of music but Green Day are considered good? I dont get it.\n\nGerard Romero (jromjet.icloud.com) (04/13/13)\n\nNow this is comical.. I'd like to know what riff Townshend EVER played that put Jimmy Page to shame? It certainly wasn't Live at Leeds because Page could probably play those riffs with the guitar over his head. As a lead guitarist Page kicks his ass and Townshend wouldn't even attempt some of Page's solos like in Dazed and Confused or No Quarter..etc. on the other hand Page could step into the shoes of Townshend and Keith Richards live and make their riffs sound better!\n\nSteven Highams (rawdon.lilly.gmail.com) (07/13/13)\n\nJust been reading your Who page (will comment at some point); if you want any Keith Moon stories, try reading 'Dear Boy', by Tony Fletcher; it's 550 pages long, give or take, and was published in 1998. It should still be available somewhere and it will be an enjoyable read for you. Theres even a picture of him proudly displaying a champagne bottle that had wedged in the wall of his house after he had thrown it at his wife; hes framed it! Not that I condone such behaviour, but there you go!\n\nJohnny (jp_bean.yahoo.com) (02/13/14)\n\nI had the same thoughts about the Who as you did growing up. My dad has a couple of their records,and I remember my brother picking apart the logical impossibility of the song. To me, the riff that plays after the chorus was as dumb as the name(like something stoned hippies came up with or something) Somewhere around the end of high school though, I gave Who's Next a serious listen and realized how amazing it was(even something soft like Baba O'Riley which I couldn't appreciate for many years) It wasn't for another couple of years afte that that I really started to get into them. Unlike the Beatles or even the Stones (my music tastes arent exactly conventional) I genuinely like most of their songs. Still want to listen to Entwistle's solo records, but I haven't had the time. Basically, I agree with everything you say. Also, Keith Moon was the most punkrock motherfucker ever, the epitome of one who has lived fast and died young.\n\nNeil Kellett (knellee68.gmail.com) (08/13/14)\n\nThanks for the site, so much and diverse angles on The Who and their contribution to popular music. This is my take.... I don't NEED The Who to be the greatest rock band ever, they had a calico career and in many ways they underachieved when you compare them with their peers, CONTEMPORARY PEERS (because that is the only comparison). The Beatles and Stones cornered the safe, sophisticated, albeit brilliant art of their own polished progress, artistry (and I love them for it) but The Who were something else. That they were underachievers is a misnomer as I know that they dragged popular music by the scruff of its neck to a higher plane. And to I am a total fan, but of a protracted moment in the history of this art, the evolution of The Who from British singles band to Monterey, Woodstock and their aftermath. I like them less and less either side of this protracted moment.... but what a glorious moment! Forget ability (even though they were more than able-remember that timeliness, that configuration of fading stars that still filled the sky over Woodstock that morning when The Who created something that has been chased ever since. I am forever amazed at them then, just then, at Townsend's self belief, Moon's otherworldly, staccato genius, of bombs and bullets, Entwistle's stake in the ground, Daltrey's voice and visual presence. To my mind they never repeated it. Much is owed to the filming and editing of their performance that night but... they made Bach, Grieg, Led Zeppelin that night. Without The Who there would be no Led Zep, no Punk.... can you imagine that? That Zeppellin invited Moon (in his later idiocy) to tinker with Bonham's drums at live gigs was a clear act of expunging... Zep had to erase The Who, their greatest inspiration, their greatest curse. I'm an ordinary guy but I can see through this. (Remember also that Moon was first choice as drummer for a nascent Zep.... they had to contend with him naming them) I love Zep! I probably listen to them more. But why is it that The Who at their peak just give more? Zep weren't ugly and The Who were not pretty. The Who remind us all that people love passion above appearences. See The Who at Woodstock, listen to Live at Leeds and Tommy, listen to everyone else and love where you will. The Who shape shifted so much, this was all due to Townsend. Townsend is an awkward intellectual, sometimes it works, sometimes no. I saw a band that grew until the early seventies, marking artistic precedents that we feel today just as we feel The Beatles, and Stones. The Beatles gave us love, The Stones, sex and The Who, anger. As for debates about ability, listen to the intro to AMAZING JOURNEY on TOMMY, where Moon stamps in, this is music not musicianship and while it's easily repeated by anyone with an ounce of rhythm it is the essence of genius, of startling art, of an alignment of stars. The Who welded the hardest and most sensitive in their music.... and I love them for it! They made Led Zep and Zep made them back by trying so hard to supercede them. But Zep came after! And they knew/know it. 69 to 71 The Who as a totality were out of sight, after that it went downhill fast, like a lead balloon. But the band, like all youngsters, were gauche and naive before they came of age. But they believed beyond their ugly ducklings to grow, to do the hard work needed to get to 1969. Yes MY GENERATION made them and without it we might never have heard of The Who, it was the purest expression of youthful angst/aggression ever articulated. The Who were pioneers, groundbreakers, all that art demands with it's many failures and moments of glory. Zeppellin were easy listening. The best are ugly making beauty, fleeting beauty.\n\ndavid hoza (dav.hoza.me.com) (04/13/15)\n\nThank you for your review.\n\nTo proof the quality of the artist is really unable. The music deliver the emotion. It's her main massage. Not the entire instrumental technique at all. You have to feel it and like it or dislike it. That's all. Are the Beatles better then the Stones? When yes, are the the Stones worse up to 20% or just 8? Is Moon better then Watts? No. Each is just the part of the great music machine. Btw Pete has to me similar riffs as Keith has. The great music has sometimes the same language. And that is good. I've met the Who for the first time in 1992 on the album my favorite's band Rock n Roll Circus. Great stuff - A quick One. But I have them really appreciated now (2015!!!!). To listen \"We close tonight\" and \"explain how I feel\"? I don't understand the drums at all. Had he only two hands or what?\n\nSimply great! You don't need the scientific explanation just enjoy the great sound!!! It reminds me comparing the Land Rover and German competition. Germans are the top notch, sporty, high quality and sensitive. Everybody wants bmw or Audi. But it is well known, that LR are much more capable on and off road as well, rough and comfy too. Simply beautifully incomparable.\n\nThe Who Sings My Generation - 1965 MCA\n\nC\n\n(Very Good / Great)\n\nBest song: My Generation\n\nAn incredible debut for all sorts of reasons. First off, look at the track credits - see anything unusual? Like the fact that 10 of the tracks are credited to Townshend and Co.? Today, that might not seem quite extraordinary, but you have to remember that this was 1965, when only a select few groups had broken from the company-mandated \"record one hit single and ten covers chosen by the record company\" pattern. As a point of contrast, not even the Beatles (8 originals on Please Please Me) or the Stones (a mere 1 original on England's Newest Hitmakers) had been able to break that pattern as early as their first album, and both groups were still performing some covers on their albums even in 1965. And Pete didn't even have to put two of the band's biggest hits (\"I Can't Explain,\" \"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\") on the album to pull this off!\n\nMore importantly, though, is the stylistic revolution brought with this album. Nothing like the Ramones' buzzsaw-tone can be found here, but if you consider the attitude and approach of this album, it would be difficult to argue that this isn't the very first punk album. But it's even more than that, as The Who brought professional-level chops and catchy, well-written melodies to the table along with the needed pissitude and aggression. It was chaos, but controlled chaos. And so on and so on.\n\nMost important, though, is that the songs are good almost start to finish. Well, ok, with two exceptions - the band wasn't able to totally escape the covers trap, so they threw on a couple of renditions of James Brown songs (at Roger's insistence). And they're awful. At this early stage, Daltrey was a decent enough singer as far as sounding aggressive and pissed off go, but he absolutely could NOT sing traditional R&B. The rest of the band seemed wholely uncomfortable in this idiom as well. Needless to say, these two songs are definite skips, and they reduce the album to only about 30 minutes of good music.\n\nBut WHAT 30 minutes of good music. Two of the songs have gone down in history as classics, and rightly so. \"My Generation\" is the best example of the punkish demeanor of the album, with some of Pete's most infamous anti-old-people-and-society lyrics (\"I hope I die before I get old\"), as well as with instrument rattling and feedback creation of a level certainly unheard of at such an early date. \"The Kids Are Alright\" isn't much worse, though, as it combines lovely Beatlish harmonies (and guitar/bass/drums work that makes this a nearly perfect power pop song) with a declaration of the unity that the younger generation felt as they grouped together. It's a subtler way of expressing animosity towards the older generation than saying, \"F*CK OFF, OLD MAN,\" but it certainly has the same point and is just as effective. Another punkish display is found in the instrumental \"The Ox,\" where the band jams over some piano playing from session man Nicky Hopkins. As the name implies, Entwistle is featured the most, but Moon's powerhouse drumming certainly provides its share of power while Pete colors in some lines here and there.\n\nAnd lo, what would a punk album be without some good ole-fashioned misogyny? Both \"A Legal Matter\" and the dark \"The Good's Gone\" certainly qualify, especially the former, which showcases Pete talking about why he's breaking off his engagement. The latter is great as well, as it features a mean-spirited, stinging guitar line throughout. There's also the wonderful \"La La La Lies,\" which spends its time chastising a mean-spirited lady, and the opener \"Out In The Street,\" which sounds like one of the best Stones-songs the Stones never wrote (but with an overpowering feedback section in the middle). And, heck, why does almost nobody every mention \"It's Not True\"? The lyrics are hilarious, the melody is incredibly catchy, and of course the chorus rules. So why doesn't anybody love this song??\n\nOk, this isn't a perfect album, but few things are. I didn't even bother to go into detail about another pair of good songs, \"Much Too Much\" and \"Instant Party (Circles),\" but that's just because they stand beside the other giants of the album. It loses some points because of the abominable covers, and the fact that the album is kinda short otherwise, but I can't complain more than that. Get this album, but get the original; the remastered, deluxe version messes with a lot of its charm.\n\nDavid Uskovich (dau.mail.utexas.edu)\n\nHave you seen the cover for the U.K. release of \"My Generation?\" It's way cooler than the U.S. cover. It's got the band, in their pop art outfits (Union Jack coat etc.), photographed from a bird's eye view. They stare up at the camera all snotty and punk. I found the album on vinyl about 15 years ago, and I still kick myself for not buying it. I guess that photo has gotten exceedingly rare, because I can't even find it on the Internet.\n\nGene Kodadek (g_kodadek.hotmail.com)\n\nI took this one to the used record store. I love My Generation, but there's little else to recommend the album. I agree that the attitude is certainly there, and at least SOMEBODY in the mid sixties had something better to write about than their girlfriend. But the songs just aren't very good.\n\nEric Benac (benac.voyager.net) (5/31/03)\n\nyou should get the deluxe reissue of this album that was recently released: it contains the british cover that guy was raving about and it is quite cool. plus it comes with a shit load of bonus tracks: but hte best part ist he improved sound. except on my generation, the song: it seems neutered somehow. nevermind: it's good.\n\nA Quick One - 1966 MCA\n\n8\n\n(Good / Mediocre)\n\nBest song: Boris The Spider\n\nOops. This album stands as eternal proof of the stupidity of record companies. The group was struggling fiscally, so MCA advanced them some money to record songs for a new album. The only problem here was that, instead of giving the money to the group, MCA advanced each member individually, and as a result all four of them had to write songs. Considering that Pete had thus far established himself as THE songwriter of the group, this was a risky venture at best, and one that did not work well in this case. The Who of Quick One sounds very different from that of the debut, and while I can give credit to the band for branching out into different areas than Maximum R&B, this is still a rough first step in the band's artistic growth. Also, the aggression level shown on the debut is only intermittently displayed here - much of the rest of the time, the band seems to think that the way to popular success is to make themselves sound as sissified as possible, and while sissification isn't bad in and of itself, the process seems very forced and unnatural throughout this album. In other words, there's only so much group falsetto I can take at one time.\n\nOn the plus side, this whole endeavour caused John to realize that he had a knack for writing dark comedy numbers, and he chips in with two of the best songs on the album. \"Boris the Spider,\" the sad tale of Boris' encounter with somebody who has the normal human reaction to spiders, would remain a fan favorite for years. After all, besides the actual tune, how can anybody resist the funny Boris voice? But anyway, \"Whiskey Man\" is a minor classic in its own right, a piece with an effective brass coda and a vocal delivery made most interesting by John's inability to properly enunciate is \"r\"'s when singing \"friend,\" forcing him to simulate it by singing \"flend\" on one track and \"fwend\" on another.\n\nOn the negative side, Keith's and Roger's numbers don't give much justification to the record company's decision. Keith's \"Cobwebs and Strange\" is amusing in a circusesque way, an instrumental with all sorts of percussion and penny whistle and brass and all that jazz, but \"I Need You\" is mediocre at best, with the percussion mixed excessively high to drown out the low quality of the vocal melody. As for Roger's \"See My Way,\" the less said about that, the better.\n\nNow, what's most distressing is that even Pete's contributions are uneven - he was generating good singles around this time, but the album material is somewhat lacking. \"Run, Run, Run\" is a good R&B groover, with crunchy rhythm guitar driving things forward, but it really gives the impression of an outtake from the debut sessions. \"Don't Look Away,\" though, is especially disappointing, a countryish ditty that has very little in the way of compactness in the melody presentation and that seems to ramble hopelessly. It's not intolerable, sure, but ehn ...\n\nThat said, Pete does manage to come across with one complete classic on the album, the power-pop gem \"So Sad About Us.\" It really does do a good job of consolidating everything The Who could do well at this time - solid pop instincts, a dose of crunch in the rhythm work, pretty harmonies and clever lyrics (\"apologies mean nothing when the damage is done/but you can't switch off my loving like you can't switch off the sun\" is one of my favorite lines ever) all make an appearance here. Good stuff.\n\nThe most important historical aspect of the album, though, comes from one of the other two tracks, and I'm of course not talking about the two-minute cover of \"Heatwave.\" \"A Quick One, While He's Away\" is the world's first \"rock-opera,\" a 9-minute tale of marital infidelity, and while it would completely come to life on stage, it's not so impressive here. Many parts of it that would knock the listeners socks off live come across as outright dumb and wimpy here (the first case that comes to mind is when they sing \"clang clang ..\" and \"cello cello...\"), and they definitely hurt the piece as a whole, but it's still a worthy attempt. And let's give Pete some credit, here; his bandmates had (overall) let the band down as far as producing enough material to fill out the LP, so he had to do something to fill that 9-minute space. Good ole Pete, willing to awkwardly break through boundries.\n\nSo thus far, it doesn't seem like much has been done to justify a rating as high as a 8, especially when it first got a grade two lower, but that's because I finally realized that the bonus tracks here definitely merit an increase. None of them are \"serious,\" but they are all so much fun that I marvel that I failed to notice them before. My favorite is another John comedy-number called \"I've Been Away,\" where he sings about his brother Bill screwing him over and sings such lines as \"never ever ever gonna speak to Bill again.\" Other than that, it's hard not to enjoy their covers of \"Bucket T\" and \"Barbara Ann,\" and the other various originals are definitely worth a couple of whirls. Heck, I even enjoy the acoustic version of the single \"Happy Jack,\" and the \"My Generation\"/\"Land of Hope and Glory\" medley is nothing short of HILARIOUS. So yeah, they're all worth a point.\n\nElliot J Huntley (elliot.ejhuntley.f9.co.uk)\n\nNo comments as such, I can't write record reviews but I was wondering could anyone tell me why Daltrey only ended up writing one song for the album? Indeed could anyone tell me why, to the best of my knowledge he only received a writing credit on 4 songs in his entire Who career. I can't believe that he had no ideas to contribute or that he wasn't allowed - Moon certainly was allowed much more album space.\n\nThought09.aol.com\n\nYes, i'd have to agree that this album is subpar, but c'mon, \"let's pretend this one never existed\" ? This album has to be one of the top 10 of '66 at least....maybe top 5. Yeah, it was a dumb idea to have all the members write songs for it, but I don't think the songs are that bad. I admit that I was a little dissapointed in this album when I first got it, but in retrospect it's great fun. I would still rate this album higher than any who album post who by numbers.\n\n(author's note): Well, I might have underrated this album, but top five of '66??!! The year of Revolver, Blonde on Blonde, Pet Sounds, Aftermath, Fifth Dimension ... ?\n\nRun Run Run is a kick ass r&b rock song that has an awesome crunch to it. I mean no one had this kind of punk-rock groove back then. Boris and Whiskey Man start the tradition of John's rather weird songwriting style; absolutely classic. Cobwebs and Strange is AWESOME!!!! What other bit of recorded music can convey what a loon moon was....PSYCHO!! british patent exploding drummer... So Sad About Us is one of the greatest examples of a british 60s power pop song ever --- awesome. I personally think they shoulda used this as their single and not happy jack (even though Jack was successful).....and what of the title track? Every keeps noting how this started Pete on his rock opera trend....but c'mon, this is a far cry from the grandiose concepts of tommy....this is pure who humor and sillyness. Rock should never take itself too serious (even PT suffered some from that) and this tune was just a freakin' hoot.\n\nYou have to remember that the who of 'a quick one' and the who of everything post 'sell out' are really two completely different groups. Pete said himself in the mid 60s that the who didn't have any talent or substance, it was just pure sensationalism...of course we know that's bullshit...but you have to realize that even to the members of the group the feeling, appearance, volume, and radicalism of what they were doing were more important than the individual songs. I listen to this album and experience the WHO circa 1966, not writing the rock-will-save-the-world stuff of lifehouse, but just being a hard rocking fuckin rock and roll band busting onto the scene.\n\n(author's note): At the same time, though, I would much rather listen to the group's singles from the same era, as I think they convey the hard rocking aspect of this era of the Who much better.\n\nGene Kodadek (g_kodadek.hotmail.com)\n\nThis one blows.\n\nTrfesok.aol.com (11/06/04)\n\nI tend to enjoy this one a bit more every time I put it on, but not much. It's clear that they were trying to come up with their own Revolver. It rivals that album for diversity, to be sure. But not in songwriting, to be sure of that, too. \"Run, Run, Run\" and \"So Sad About Us\" wouldn't be much without the band's instrumental prowess behind them. \"Cobwebs and Strange\" and the title track are interesting, kind of fun experiments, but they aren't entirely successful, either. I find that John's songs (including the bonus tracks, especially the hilarious hypochondria of \"Doctor, Doctor\") are actually consistently stronger here than anyone else's. And the cover songs are pretty much filler as well.\n\nI think I would enjoy the songs, though, if the album had been recorded better by new producer Kit Lambert. On the remaster, Keith's careening drums and John's loopy bass come through clearly, but the tinny guitar and high voices sound really weak. You wouldn't know this was the same band that was coming up with legendarily loud and powerful live shows (\"A Quick One,\" in particular, is incomparable in live versions). Unfortunately, they wouldn't resolve the inconsistencies in the studio for a few years yet, with this album suffering the most.\n\nNathan Schulz (nschulz4537.gmail.com) (04/25/06)\n\nHi John, I'm a young man with ambitions of possibly starting my own review site, so I thought I'd post my \"A Quick One\" review which I wrote for my possible site. Here 'tis:\n\nThis is one unexpectedly shitty album. Before recording their second album, The Who were strapped for cash, and what that meant was that every member would have to contribute original material, they'd have to record the shittiest sounding cover ever done by anyone, the whole album would have to sound like it was recorded and mixed in about a half hour, and there'd be no cello. The results are often dreadful: Heatwave is so fuckin' out of tune you wouldn't believe it. \"Cobwebs and Strange\" sounds like four people walking around a room bashing toys together, which is essentially what it is. And have you ever listened to Moon's lyrics and singing to \"I Need You\"? \"Knowing: Is what people tell you,\" just despicable stuff, really. It certainly doesn't take The Who to write material of this caliber. I'm not sure who you are, but trust me, you could've done better than that.\n\nHowever, the non-Moon non-Cover songs are better. Three of the four songs Townshend wrote aren't particularly exciting, and don't really sound too different from the lesser material on the debut. The title track is pretty ambitious though, a nine-minute multi-parted rock opera that predates any concept album I can think of. My favorite part of the song is when Ivor the old engine driver has \"relations\" with the protagonist. Good song, good song. You know what else is a good song? See My Way. Yeah, in spite of all its flaws, I can't help but sing along \"Some way, Some day, I'll find a way, To make you see my way!\" Although the tune rhymes \"way\" with \"day,\" and then with \"way,\" and then with \"way\" again, you can't help but love it. Oh, and also Entwistle's groovy psychedelic surf-rocker \"Boris the Spider\" is easily the best thing on here, and \"Whiskey Man\" isn't really that bad.\n\nEven though I can't say I enjoy this album, it is a little admirable. This album is blessed with a newly found sense of rudimentary experimentation and diversity but plagued by horrid production and songwriting. It's totally excusable though, as they badly needed money, and would dramatically improve in quality hereafter.\n\nOh, there's also some bonus tracks, but I'm not listening to anything that was rejected from this album any time soon, so you're on your own there.\n\nHow's that then?\n\nThe Who Sell Out - 1967 MCA\n\nE\n\n(Great)\n\nBest song: I Can See For Miles\n\nOne of the greatest concept albums ever, both in terms of the concept and of the song material. The album is setup to mimic an archetypical late 60's British pirate radio broadcast, commericials and all, and The Who absolutely nail it here. They really took care of all the little details here, both in the kinds of commercials and the way they flow in and out of the songs. Sometimes the commercials are \"full\" spots, like for Heinz Baked Beans or Odorono, but oftentimes the interludes are fragmented and shortened or even nonsensical, much the way you'd find it in real life. So before the album starts, we hear horns and a distorted voice listing the days of the week; before \"Our Love Was\" we hear \"Radio London reminds you, goooo to the chuuuuuurch of your choooooooooice,\"; before \"I Can See For Miles\" we have a whole slew of jingles slammed into each other. All the short jingles are memorable as hell, and they manage to be incredibly hilarious, not in so much of a bust-out-laughing way as in a subtle, Monty Python way. It also ends up that one's impression of the song material can't help but include these jingles - \"Our Love Was\" just seems so incomplete without its intro, for instance.\n\nCommercials or no commercials, though, the main reason I rate this album so highly is that the songs are stunning, an incredible improvement over the inconsistency that had marred A Quick One. To this point, The Who had proven themselves to be an incredible singles band, but their dominance in the album format was still very questionable. Here, though, almost everything works - Pete managed to come up with a ton of great songs in several styles, and the result is an album that never gets boring and flows incredibly well.\n\nHonestly, I consider the first side just nigh of perfect, and only a slight breakdown on side two keeps the album from a perfect score and (possibly) the band's finest moment. The opening \"Armenia, City in the Sky\" is lyrically lightweight (or weightless, as it's about a city in space; oh I kill me sometimes), but that's the only reason I can come up with for it not being considered a complete classic. Filled with backwards feedback giving support to a wonderful vocal melody (with weirdly distorted vocals), it's the perfect opener for an album like this, and one I wouldn't trade for the world.\n\nAfter a brief word from \"Heinz Baked Beans,\" the band launches into the wonderful innuendo-laced classic, \"Mary Anne with the Shaky Hands.\" There are actually a number of versions of this track floating around the world, and this probably isn't the best one, but even so, it would be hard to find another song that makes handjobs so catchy. The harmonies are perfectly lovely, the lyrics are funny, the melody is simple yet genial, and the shaky-voiced fadeout is a hilarious way to top it all off.\n\nUp next is another commercial and another pop ballad, and each take the album up another notch or three. For some reason, some people are offended by the idea that Pete decided to combine such a genial pop melody with lyrics for a deodorant commercial, but I can't understand that. The lyrics paint out a detailed story of love, loss and B.O., and the ending twist that makes it into a commercial only adds to the novelty and enjoyability. Pete graces the proceedings with a simply lovely vocal, while Daltrey provides good harmonies here and there (I love the way he sings \"triumphant\" in the background), and in short it's just a good ole'-fashioned pop classic. Much like the following \"Tattoo,\" which features an utterly brilliant guitar line underpinning the vocal melody, as well as MORE of the gorgeous harmonies that the band was proving itself capable of providing. The lyrics do a wonderful job of capturing all sorts of teenage emotions - confusion, directionless rebellion, a longing for \"maturity,\" etc - and they're framed in a context of both humor and regret. In short, it's hard to get much better than this.\n\nBut of course, the next two tracks exceed it and then some. \"Our Love Was\" is a STUNNINGLY gorgeous ballad (with more Pete vocals) with yet ANOTHER brilliant guitar line (which is much like that of John Lennon's "
