        "text": "The Who frontman will perform hits and rarities at New York area shows.\n\nRoger Daltrey is hitting the road with an electric/acoustic band this summer. The co-founder and lead singer of The Who had stated just last year that The Who would probably won't tour the U.S. again due to financial reasons. He also stated this past January when discussing The Who, that that part of his life is over. Whether or not The Who will ever tour the U.S. again remains to be seen, but one thing is clear, and that is that Roger Daltrey will be touring with a solo band playing the music of The Who.\n\nAlso See: Experience the Magic of John Fogerty and George Thorogood Live\n\nThe Who formed out of London, England in 1964 with the classic lineup featuring Roger Daltrey on vocals, Pete Townshend on guitar, bassist John Entwistle, and drummer Keith Moon. They are considered to be one of the most influential rock bands of all time, with over 100 million records sold worldwide. Hit singles from The Who include “I Can’t Explain”, “My Generation”, “Substitute”, “Pinball Wizard”, “Baba O’Riley” and “Won’t Get Fooled Again”.\n\nThe Who were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990. Festival appearances by The Who including Woodstock and their live concert album, Live at Leeds (1970), established their reputation as a respected rock act. Their last studio album was Who in 2019.\n\nRoger Daltrey began a solo career in 1973 while still a member of the Who, and has released ten solo studio albums, five compilation albums and one live album. He will be featuring the music of The Who along with solo material on upcoming tour.\n\nWhere is Roger Daltrey Performing?"
