        "text": "“The Lost Boys: Hard-To-Find ’80s LPs” gives you exactly what the title implies: a rare or out-of-print album or EP from the ’80s in its entirety. Some will be from CD, but most will have been lovingly transferred from pristine vinyl culled directly from the Analog Kid’s vast collection. Whatever album I choose, it will be one that you can’t easily find for sale on Amazon or in the iTunes store. Death…by stereo!\n\n1985 was the year that I really discovered The Who. I bought my first two Who albums in the spring (Live At Leeds and Greatest Hits), and over the summer I acquired budget MCA cassette versions of Who’s Next and Who Are You. By the start of my freshman year at UT-Austin in August, I was almost obsessed. I spent the better part of that school year acquiring the entire Who catalog, including some of my very first CD purchases (It’s Hard, The Who By Numbers, and Tommy among them).\n\nThe Who may have officially disbanded after their 1982 Farewell (ha ha) tour, but they were now my favorite band. I couldn’t get enough, and thankfully both Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend put out great solo records in 1985 to help supply my fix. Townshend had written “After The Fire” for The Who to perform at Live Aid during their one-off reunion show, but the band didn’t have time to learn it. Townshend gave the song to Daltrey instead, and “After The Fire” became one of Roger’s biggest solo hits. Daltrey had intentionally stayed away from aping The Who’s sound on his prior solo albums, but he fully embraced his rock and roll heritage on Under A Raging Moon. The result was the best solo record of Roger’s career, and I assure you that my neighbors on the third floor of the Dobie dormitory still know most of the songs by heart.\n\nRoger Daltrey: Under A Raging Moon\n\nAtlantic Records, 1985\n\n1. “After The Fire” (Townshend)\n\nAfter The Fire\n\n2. “Don’t Talk To Strangers” (Downes/Ryder/Daltrey)\n\nDon’t Talk To Strangers\n\n3. “Breaking Down Paradise” (Ballard)\n\nBreaking Down Paradise\n\n4. “The Pride You Hide” (Dalgleish/Daltrey/Tesco)\n\nThe Pride You Hide\n\n5. “Move Better In The Night” (Thompson/Lange/McIntosh/Daltrey)\n\nMove Better In The Night\n\n6. “Love Me Like You Do” (Nye)\n\nLove Me Like You Do\n\n7. “Let Me Down Easy” (Adams/Vallance)\n\nLet Me Down Easy\n\n8. “Fallen Angel” (Hain)\n\nFallen Angel\n\n9. “It Don’t Satisfy Me” (Shacklock/Daltrey)\n\nIt Don’t Satisfy Me\n\n10. “Rebel” (Adams/Vallance)\n\nRebel\n\n11. “Under A Raging Moon” (Downes/Parr)\n\nUnder A Raging Moon\n\nWith White City: A Novel, Pete Townshend continued his long history of writing concept-based albums. Unlike Tommy or Quadrophenia, though, there was no real narrative to White City. The album’s songs simply represented different sketches of life in White City, a low-income housing area located in West London. “Face The Face” became one of Townshend’s most-popular solo songs, and David Gilmour’s guitar work helped elevate “Give Blood” and “White City Fighting” to near-classic status. For me, “Brilliant Blues” and its melancholy goodbye to Daltrey and The Who will always hold a special place. I had just arrived at the party, and the damn cops had already busted it up.\n\nLike most of Pete and Roger’s solo outings, Under A Raging Moon and White City: A Novel are currently out of print. Perhaps there’s an 18-year-old down in Austin right now who is discovering Townshend and The Who for the first time– if that happens to be you, welcome to the camp. I guess you all know why we’re here.\n\nPete Townshend: White City: A Novel\n\nAtco Records, 1985\n\n1. “Give Blood” (Townshend)\n\nGive Blood\n\n2. “Brilliant Blues” (Townshend)\n\nBrilliant Blues\n\n3. “Face The Face” (Townshend)\n\nFace The Face\n\n4. “Hiding Out” (Townshend)\n\nHiding Out\n\n5. “Secondhand Love” (Townshend)\n\nSecondhand Love\n\n6. “Crashing By Design” (Townshend)\n\nCrashing By Design\n\n7. “I Am Secure” (Townshend)\n\nI Am Secure\n\n8. “White City Fighting” (Townshend/Gilmour)\n\nWhite City Fighting\n\n9. “Come To Mama” (Townshend)\n\nCome To Mama\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nBonus Tracks!\n\nThe first rule of The Analog Kid blog is that if you write about a song on the Analog Kid blog, you share the song on the Analog Kid blog.\n\nRoger Daltrey: “Quicksilver Lightning” (Moroder/Pitchford)\n\nFrom the soundtrack album Quicksilver\n\nAtlantic Records, 1986\n\nVinyl rip courtesy of The Analog Kid\n\nQuicksilver Lightning\n\nPete Townshend: “Face The Face” [Long Version] (Townshend)\n\nFrom the U.K. 12″ single Face The Face\n\nAtco Records, 1985\n\nVinyl rip courtesy of the Analog Kid\n\nFace The Face [Long Version]\n\nPete Townshend: “Magic Bus” [Live]\n\nFrom the 12″ single Give Blood\n\nAtco Records, 1986\n\nMagic Bus [Live]\n\nPete Townshend: “Hiding Out” [12″ Mix]\n\nFrom the 12″ single Hiding Out\n\nAtco Records, 1986\n\nHiding Out [12″ Mix]\n\nPete Townshend: “Night School” (Townshend)\n\nNight School\n\nPete Townshend: “Save It For Later” (Wakeling/Steele/Cox/Morton/Charlery)\n\nSave It for Later\n\nFrom the album White City: A Novel (2006 Remaster]\n\nHip-O Records, 1006\n\nPete Townshend: “Life To Life” (Townshend)\n\nFrom the soundtrack album Playing For Keeps\n\nAtlantic Records, 1986\n\nVinyl rip courtesy of the Analog Kid"
