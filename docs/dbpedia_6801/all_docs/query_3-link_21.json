        "text": "As many of us know. Roger Daltrey can often be seen playing rhythm guitar onstage with The WHO. Going back at least to the Kenny Jones era, or earlier.\n\nSome of us know Daltrey was actually the original lead guitarist in The WHO ! Townshend originally played 2nd or rhythm guitar ! A bit later Daltrey became the primary lead vocalist & dropped guitar.\n\nWe know the sound of The WHO was quite full with just 3 instruments, but even from the first single with Jimmy Page on 2nd guitar, & the 1st album, with Nicky Hopkins adding piano, the WHO often added a 4th instrument. Particularly on poppy songs like Can't Explain, Kids Are Alright, & many others\n\nDid Daltrey ever play guitar or other instruments on WHO records ? If so which ones ? If not, why not ? Sure with Moons busy Drums, Entwistle's busy lead bass lines, Townshend's big chords & guitar riffing, you wouldn't always want him to. But with only 2 & 4 tracks in 1965-66, it might come in handy to track 2 guitars, & allow Entwistle or Townshend to play keyboards. We know Daltrey is somewhat competent on guitar, it looks good live when they both play. So what's the story with Daltrey playing guitar in The WHO ?\n\nI've never even heard anybody discuss this before.\n\nOK please chime in"
