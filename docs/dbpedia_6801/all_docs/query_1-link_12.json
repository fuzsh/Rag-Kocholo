        "text": "Forty years ago this month, The Who released their first live album, Live At Leeds. Riding off the back of the astounding success of their Tommy rock opera, this six-track live album firmly established The Who as one of the world’s top rock attractions of the early 70s.\n\nPackaged in a fairly anonymous bootleg style sleeve, the music within was anything but. Live At Leeds finally captured The Who in all their explosive on-stage glory. It has gone on to be acclaimed as the greatest live album of all time and, in turn, elevated The Who’s legacy as one of the greatest live bands of all time. This is a reputation they have maintained right up to the modern era – as was demonstrated by their remarkable 12-minute performance at this year’s Super Bowl event.\n\nIn hindsight, Live At Leeds can be viewed as one of the first bona fide rock live albums. Though the art of reproducing a live performance on record was nothing new – the likes of Frank Sinatra and Miles Davis had enjoyed success in their respective fields with live recordings – rock and pop acts had rarely been caught to full effect. Live albums such The Rolling Stones’ Got Live If You Want It and The Kinks Live At Kelvin Hall were primitive recordings, often made with one or two microphones slung over the stage and theatre balcony to capture audience ambience, and in the Stones’ case, heavily overdubbed.\n\nThe year 1969 was pivotal year for The Who. In May, they unveiled Townshend’s rock opera, now titled Tommy, at a launch gig at London’s Ronnie Scott’s on 2 May. They then took the opera on the road, performing it over 160 times in a series of performances across the UK and US. The last performance, until their 25th anniversary reunion tour in 1989, was at London’s Roundhouse on 20 December 1970, when they dedicated it to the support act, the then-emerging Elton John.\n\nAlong the way, Tommy became the first work of contemporary popular music to be performed at New York’s Metropolitan Opera House. They played it to vast audiences at the Isle Of Wight festivals in 1969 and 1970 and, of course, Woodstock. Their memorable appearance at Max Yasgur’s farm in Bethel, New York was captured for inclusion in the Woodstock film, which was a box office smash when it opened in the spring of 1970. Pinball Wizard and We’re Not Gonna Take It from that famous live set also appeared on the big selling accompanying soundtrack album.\n\nAt the time, The Who were keen to record a live album for a number of reasons. Firstly, it would act as an appropriate follow up to Tommy, giving them breathing space to move away from the rock opera, which was rapidly becoming a millstone around their neck. There was also the desire to capture their live act of the time which, with increased PA wattage and musical invention, had elevated them to a position as the best live act in the world, rivaled only by The Rolling Stones and the emerging Led Zeppelin.\n\nIn mid-1969, in an interview with Melody Maker’s Tony Wilson, Townshend declared their intention to record a live set: “We’ll be going over to America more often, but for shorter periods. So we can balance it out between the States and Britain. And we are also hoping to do a live album sometime in the future because that’s something we have been asked to do.”\n\nAs the band took off for a fall US tour, resident Who soundman Bob Pridden orchestrated the recording of a number of live gigs, using just a couple of mics and a recorder. At a gig at the Electric Ballroom, Philadelphia on 19 October, before performing Young Man Blues, Townshend informed the audience that they were recording the show for a live album to be released at the year’s end.\n\nBack in England, they also filmed and recorded their London Coliseum show on 16 December 1969. The latter would see an eventual DVD release as part of the Live At Kilburn DVD set in 2008.\n\nHowever, the rest of the tapes were allegedly dispensed with, as Townshend revealed at the time to Rolling Stone: “We thought that we would get the best material. When we got back we had 80 hours of tape. I said, ‘Fuck that, I’m not going to sit though 80 hours of live stuff’. Let’s face it, you’d get brainwashed. So we just scrapped the lot. We put it all on a bonfire to stop bootlegging.” The latter statement may not have been entirely true, as tapes from that tour did surface on subsequent bootlegs.\n\nFurther evidence of the band’s intention to release a live album can be seen on a surviving tape box reel. This shows that engineer Damon Lyon-Shaw prepared a master reel for a proposed Who live album at IBC Studio A on 6 January 1970, mixed from the two track tapes recorded by Bob Pridden on the fall 1969 US tour. The tape box reveals the tracks to be Young Man Blues 1, I Can’t Explain, Fortune Teller, Young Man Blues 2, Summertime Blues, Shakin’ All Over, Tattoo and My Generation.\n\nAs a new decade dawned, The Who began work at IBC Studios on recording two new compositions – Townshend’s The Seeker and a rare Roger Daltrey composition, Here For Now, which would be released as a single in March. They also set off on a prestigious tour of European opera houses, performing seven concerts across Paris, Copenhagen, Hamburg, Cologne, Berlin and Amsterdam.\n\nTheir first UK gigs since late December would be singled out for the making of a live album at the unlikely locations of Leeds University on 14 February and Hull City Hall the following night. As The Who’s manager of the time, Kit Lambert, wryly observed: “In those days live albums were always ‘Live At The Colosseum In Rome’ or ‘Live At The Palladium,’ ‘Hollywood Bowl,’ etc. I said, ‘live’ isn’t really like that. Touring is much seedier. So why didn’t we think of ‘Live At Grimsby’ or ‘Live At Mud-on-Sea’. I looked at the schedule and said: ‘You’re in Hull on Wednesday and Leeds on Thursday [sic], so it’s going to be ‘Live At Hull’ or ‘Live At Leeds.’ Things didn’t go too well at Hull, so it had to be Leeds.”\n\nThe Who had played the 2,000-capacity Leeds refectory twice before. At a student rag ball on 23 June 1966, with John Mayall’s Bluesbreakers, Wayne Fontana, The Alan Price Set and The Swinging Blue Jeans and, again, on 21 January 1967 with Hamilton and The Movement supporting.\n\nOver the second weekend of February 1970, the Pye mobile recording unit could be seen parked outside the respective Northern venues, with Vic Maile engineering. The mobile unit was fresh from capturing the soundtrack to Led Zeppelin’s 9 January Royal Albert Hall show for an intended TV documentary. This recording would emerge years later on the band’s 2003 five hour DVD package.\n\nThe Who’s set at the time had developed into what Townshend had described as a tripartite – as noted by Who archivist Tim Joseph in Generations magazine. It featured three distinct sections. The first part would signal a batch of old Who favourites and new songs, the second the complete rendition of the Tommy rock opera and a third part essentially comprised of four encores.\n\nTownshend was now using four 4 x 12 cabinets topped with two 100 watt Hiwatt amplifiers. The entire PA system had an output of 2,000 watts and cost an estimated £5,000. This bank of equipment was responsible for the mammoth sound captured on the live recordings.\n\n“We are trying to sophisticate our sound a little to make it a little less ear rending,” he remarked at the time. “We haven’t got any louder, but our PA has got bigger. It’s now 1,500 watts and it just chucks it out. That’s what’s deafening people. One of our troubles is Keith Moon – he’s just so deafening. If we do a two and a half hour show he just starts playing like a machine.”\n\nThe guitarist also felt that his own performances were expanding. “There was a point at the time of Live At Leeds when I was getting pretty dexterous,” he told Jill Eckersley. “I practiced every day. The Who were working on the road a lot and I was using a Gibson SG that I’d had a long time. It was a very fast instrument and we really hit it off. I found my hands going faster than my head and when I listened to the tapes of those shows I was playing some really blinding stuff.”\n\nIt was off the back of this new found confidence that The Who arrived in Leeds on Valentine’s Day 1970. The set list for their appearance that night was as follows: Heaven & Hell, I Can’t Explain, Fortune Teller, Tattoo, Young Man Blues, Substitute, Happy Jack, I’m A Boy, A Quick One (While He’s Away), Overture, It’s A Boy, 1921, Amazing Journey, Sparks, Eyesight To The Blind, Christmas, The Acid Queen, Pinball Wizard, Do You Think It’s Alright?, Fiddle About, Tommy, Can You Hear Me?, There’s A Doctor, Go To The Mirror, Miracle Cure, Sally Simpson, I’m Free, Tommy’s Holiday Camp, We’re Not Gonna Take It, Summertime Blues, Shakin’ All Over, My Generation and Magic Bus.\n\nOn the night, two lucky students were in the right place at the right time to capture images of this famous gig. A 17-year-old budding photographer, Chris McCourt, had been commissioned to shoot both the Leeds and Hull shows – with a view to them being used on the sleeve design.\n\n“I was a schoolboy at Holland Comprehensive in London,” recalled Chris in 2006. “I’d taken a few photos, street life, things like that. I got a tip off from the guy who did the artwork for Tommy that The Who were looking for a photographer to cover two concerts in Leeds and Hull. So I rang their office and asked if I could take my portfolio in, and Kit Lambert hired me. They agreed to pay me £50 plus expenses. I still don’t honestly know why they chose me. I had no track record of taking live photography. Maybe they were just trying to do things differently.”\n\n“Kit told me to do colour shots only. I shot a lot of colour and also black-and-white too with no flash, but I only handed in the colour shots. When the album came out they had opted for the bootleg style sleeve. I never heard from them again. Then, about 25 years later, I found the black-and-white negatives. Chris Charlesworth, who was an executive producer on the Live At Leeds reissue. got in touch and some of the photos were reproduced in the booklet for the CD.”\n\nAnother young photographer that Valentine’s night was John Rettie, then studying civil engineering at the University Of Leeds. “While there, I began photographing car rallies for the weekly student newspaper” he recalled. “In November 1969, the editor asked me to get a candid portrait of Christine Perfect when she performed at the weekly concert in the University’s refectory. I guess he liked my photos and after the Christmas holidays I was asked to shoot more concerts.\n\n“I also got to shoot backstage. The newspaper had a writer who had the enviable assignment to interview the bands during the mid-concert break. The editor wanted me to get shots of the band members relaxing during the break, so I was allowed backstage. I used a Pentax 35mm SLR camera with a 35mm and 50mm lens. I was a cash-poor student and could not afford to take many pictures. In those days shooting colour was expensive. However, I realised The Who concert was important, so I splashed out and shot one roll of 20-exposure colour slides. I also shot 63 black-and-white images. Initially, only five of my Who pictures were used in the following week’s newspaper.”\n\n“My favourite photo is of John Entwistle sitting in a booth backstage drinking Bell’s Scotch and chatting with a beautiful blonde lady. I didn’t know who she was until I met Roger Daltrey three years ago at the concert they performed in Hamburg at Volkswagen’s 60th birthday party for the VW Microbus. Their manager allowed me, along with about 30 other people, to meet them backstage. I showed Roger my backstage photos from Leeds and he told me that the blonde was Kim, Keith Moon’s wife.\n\n“After The Who concert in 1970, I spent five months in California. When I told people I was a student at Leeds they would say, ‘Is that the Leeds in Live At Leeds?’ The album was a massive hit in the States. Imagine their delight when I said I had not only attended the concert but also photographed it.”\n\nPhotos of The Who from the Tommy era remain some of the most impressive on-stage shots of any band. Townshend’s no nonsense boiler suit attire, complemented by the flamboyant fringe jackets of Roger Daltrey, casting him in the role of a hippie Adonis, are memorable images forever ingrained in countless books on the band.\n\nLooking back on his attire of the time, Daltrey told journalist Simon Goddard: “I was always a rocker trying to compete in a mod uniform. Not that I didn’t like mod, I loved it, I just didn’t suit it. I’ve got a big chest, my shape just didn’t suit it. In the end I just kind of went ‘Fuck it, I’m just gonna be me’. I’ve always had curly hair, but I used to straighten it and it used to drive me fucking insane. To be a mod with curly hair was like having the pox. So I just gave up. I was always into American native culture and a friend of mine was making buckskins so I just had a suit made. I kind of found a voice from there with Tommy.”\n\nJohn Bisbrowne remembers The Who’s appearance very well, as he was part of the Entertainments Committee, led by social secretary Simon Brogan, that booked bands at Leeds University. “There was a great buzz about The Who playing as we all knew it was going to be for a live album,” he recalls.\n\n“The tickets sold out instantly and I remember huge queues building up when they went on sale – students were bringing cups of tea for those in line,” recalled John, who now runs the Henry’s Record Shop in Burton-on-Trent. “Back then, I was part of the security for the venue. We had about 100 stewards in attendance. As well as parading the balcony, I was lucky enough to be at the front of the stage on the right hand side at one point.\n\n“I did have a chat to the band before, notably with Keith. When he discovered I was from Burtonon- Trent we talked about the jazz drummer Phil Seaman, who like me, was from that area and had worked with Alexis Korner and Georgie Fame. Aside from all the madcap antics he struck me as a very knowledgeable musician.\n\n“We had a lot of big name bands come to Leeds around that time – we had a good reputation for organisation and a good understanding of what a PA should sound like – which was just as well as The Who were incredibly loud.\n\n“I saw a lot of shows at the university, some really memorable ones such as The Rolling Stones and Bob Marley, but this was something special. We all received advance copies of the Leeds album a couple of months later. The audience that night were phenomenal. As the band gave them more, the audience gave it back. I suppose they could have played the set countless times again, but it would never have been as good.”\n\nThe audience reaction was something Townshend and Daltrey were both aware of. Talking to Rolling Stone magazine at the time of the album’s release, Pete said: “It just happened to be a good show, and it just happened to be one of the greatest audiences we’ve ever played to in our whole career, just by chance. They were incredible and, though you can’t hear a lot of shouting and screaming in the background [on the record]… they’re crazy – you know, they’re fantastic. And we played it in their own hall. The sound is all right – it’s a good atmosphere.’’\n\nThe on-stage banter and rapport with the punters was a key ingredient to creating a unique bond between The Who and their audience. The limited format of the LP rendered much of this between song commentary to the cutting room floor; but, thankfully, some of it was restored for the expanded CD editions.\n\nRather than the ‘heads down let’s boogie attitude’ of some of their peers, The Who always seemed to be enjoying themselves on stage and involving their audience as they did so. This is more than evident during the between-song chatter. Listen carefully and you can hear Keith Moon’s caustic wit behind Daltrey and Townshend’s introductions at numerous intervals.\n\nFor example, when Pete comments he had read one of Mose Allison’s record covers, where Allison had been described as a ‘jazz-sage’ and Townshend comments “quite what that means I don’t know,” Moon cuts in with ‘‘a flavoured chicken!’’ Later, when Townshend introduces Tommy as ‘‘Thomas, a pot opera,” Moon taps his drum rims as an impromptu orchestra conductor and declares, “Quiet, quiet, it’s a bleedin’ opera, innit!’’\n\nNone of the remastered versions, however, capture Pete’s unedited explanatory introduction before the band’s delivery of My Generation: “We’d like to say goodbye now. There’s a long time to go yet in actual fact. We do a number now which is kinda a little bit of everything. It’s mostly The Who and mostly The Who of about three years ago. And probably mixed in are little bits of The Who today and this is something which is more or less our hymn. [Moon: “Or her”]. And the reason we reprise Tommy in it – in other words we repeat a bit of it – is to mix all the bits of our history into one great huge deafening din! This is dedicated to you really because you’ve been really incredibly kind and nice and friendly and all that. (mock theatrical voice) It’s really wonderful to be back in Leeds.’’\n\nBob Pridden recorded The Who’s 14 February 1970 show onto an eight-track, 1’’ tape machine that had been set up in the refectory kitchen beneath the auditorium at Leeds University.\n\nTo avoid sound leakage – where one instrument can be heard on the track reserved for another – Pridden used far fewer microphones than usual, with a single one suspended above the audience to capture the ambience. His trickiest task was recording Keith Moon. Pridden placed mics around Moon’s drum kit, but far enough away that he couldn’t knock them over or break them in a fit of destruction.\n\nHowever, the actual recording was not without its problems. Pete was not impressed with Pye’s unit or engineers. “They did a terrible job on the recording, they fucked it up incredibly. They got crackles all through it, horrible crackles, but I’m just going to put it out anyway,” he told Rolling Stone at the time. This would result in the famous ‘Crackling Noises Ok – Do Not Correct’ statement that appears on the record label. The next night in Hull, there were problems with recording the bass track, which rendered much of the recording unusable. Back in the studio, they set about editing the material for an album to be made available as quickly as possible.“We tried to overdub some lost vocals, but it didn’t work,” said John Entwistle later. The only thing we added was a bit of tape delay. It sounded too clean for a live recording. Once we added the delay and cut the audience out it sounded fine. There was a bit in Magic Bus where we couldn’t get it to flow properly. So Pete just edited the tape, cut a bit out and turned it backwards.” Contrary to John’s comments, there were backing vocal overdubs added to Happy Jack and My Generation and possibly other tracks.\n\nJust prior to the album’s release, Keith Moon told the NME’s Richard Green: “We got the mics and sound balance and things sorted out during the last American tour. Moving mics backwards and forwards until the recording sounded OK. We sat Bob Pridden at the control panel on stage and left him to get on with the balance. The Hull show was quite good, but the Leeds one was really good. Bob worked well that night, bless him!”\n\nThe long-awaited Who live album was finally edited down to six tracks and packaged in a simple sleeve design that aped the bootleg LP packaging of the time, specifically The Rolling Stones Live’R Than You’ll Ever Be, which was very popular at the time. A series of inserts comprising contracts, photos, a facsimile of the Marquee Club residency poster and invoices documenting The Who’s history was a thenpioneering use of memorabilia. Released as Track 2406 001 on 22 May 1970, it reached No 2 in the UK and remained in the charts for 21 weeks, the longest for any Who LP in Britain up to that point. It was released in the US as Decca DL 79175 on 16th May 1970, reaching No 4 and remained on the charts for 44 weeks.\n\nReflecting on the album’s full-on rock attack some years later, Townshend told journalist Simon Goddard in 2004, “The Who are not Led Zeppelin and we are not Deep Purple and we were not responsible for heavy metal, but a lot of people draw that line from Live At Leeds onwards.”\n\nBack in 1970, the album was also very well received by the press. This positive reaction allowed The Who to break free of the shackles of Tommy. Though they would continue to perform it live until the end of the year, Townshend found some breathing space to attempt another ambitious project – the Lifehouse idea. Though something of a stillborn affair, it did result in the bulk of recordings that constituted their next studio album Who’s Next and hit single Won’t Get Fooled Again.\n\nThe Live At Leeds album did also spawn a single issued on 10 July 1970. This combined an edited version of Summertime Blues from the Leeds album with a studio recording of John Enthwistle’s Heaven & Hell, the latter an alternate mix from an IBC session for the BBC, originally aired on Radio One’s Dave Lee Travis Show. It reached No 38 in the UK and No 27 in the US.\n\nJust over six months on from the live album recording, The Who went back to Leeds University to perform on the night of 21 November 1970. John Bisbrowne recalls Townshend telling the audience, “We are back here to pay our royalties,” an acknowledgement of the crowd participation that aided the live album. When the band were sent their £1,000 fee for playing on 14 February they forgot, or did not bother, to cash the cheque. It was paid again when they returned on this subsequent night.\n\nAfter Leeds, a variety of Who shows were filmed and captured on tape. The band’s Isle Of Wight appearance on 30 August 1970 was recorded on eight-track, using the CBS mobile and filmed by Murray Lerner for an intended documentary. Footage would eventually surface some 25 years later on the Message To Love and Listening To You DVD releases. A 2-CD The Who: Live At The Isle Of Wight was belatedly released on the Castle label in 1996.\n\nOn 12 and 13 December 1971, shows at the Civic Auditorium San Francisco were officially recorded, with a resulting live album release in mind. The 16-track tapes were mixed by Glyn Johns, but the album never reached fruition. Baby Don’t You Do It later appeared in edited form as the B-side to Join Together in June 1972. Bargain, My Wife and an impromptu jam on Freddie King’s I’m Going Down appeared on the MCA compilations Who’s Missing and Two’s Missing in 1987/88. In 2007, Substitute, My Wife, Behind Blue Eyes, Bargain and Baby Don’t You Do It from this source were used on the Who.com website-only double-disc release View From A Backstage Pass.\n\nThe 2010 official Polydor set Greatest Hits & More bonus live disc also included I Cant Explain Substitute and Behind Blue Eyes from the same source. Subsequent recordings made at The Who’s show on 18 May 1974 at Charlton football ground and the 12 June 1976 Who’s Put The Boot In gig at Swansea’s Vetch Field football ground were broadcast on Capital Radio – the Swansea recording was also considered for a possible live album. Inevitably, bootlegs appeared of both shows. Extracts from these shows also appeared on the View From A Backstage Pass and the Greatest Hits & More bonus disc.\n\nThe Who made their final appearances with Keith Moon on 15 December 1977 at Kilburn Gaumont State Cinema and the following May at Shepperton Studios. Both shows were staged for the movie project The Kids Are Alright, which was released in 1979.\n\nAs for Live At Leeds, eventually the bulk of the rest of the concert was officially released. In 1979, the version of Happy Jack did seep out on the soundtrack to The Kids Are Alright movie, despite not appearing in the film, and being miscredited as being from Sweden 1966. In 1995, the album was expanded with the inclusion of eight additional tracks. Finally, in 2001, a Deluxe Version, spread over two discs, presented the complete Tommy performance on a second disc. At last, some 30 years on from the original live album, the majority of the historic live set was now available.\n\nRecordings from the Hull concert have also now surfaced. Bob Pridden included the versions of Happy Jack, I’m A Boy and A Quick One (While He’s Away), as recorded at the City Hall, Hull on February 15 1970 on the aforementioned special 2-CD View From A Backstage Pass set.\n\n“We actually wanted to use Hull as the live recording rather than Leeds,” reflected Bob Pridden, “but when we listened to the playback, the bass was missing. The interesting thing is that we obviously didn’t listen all the way through. It was only when I was doing my research for this album that I found some tracks with the bass playing loud and clear, and with John on top form!” Happy Jack and I’m A Boy from the same source (plus the Leeds version of Magic Bus) are on the bonus live CD on The Who Greatest Hits & More compilation issued to coincide with The Who’s appearance at the Super Bowl in January 2010.\n\nIn 2007, a two-disc DVD history of The Who titled Amazing Journey was compiled. While researching this project, previously unseen cine film of the Leeds show surfaced. Co-director and editor Paul Crowder explained to Ken Sharp in RC issue 344: “That was found during Murray Lerner’s (who directed the Isle Of Wight 1970 footage) research. Apparently, some guy was emptying a trash can at the university, throwing out some old stuff, and he came across this film canister. It’s four and half minutes of Super 8 footage. It has no sound, but now we have the complete concert we were able to find the segments and sync it up.” The surviving footage with synched sound was included in the Japanese repackage of Amazing Journey.\n\nOn June 2006, The Who made an emotional return to Leeds University to perform again in the refectory and receive a heritage plaque.\n\nWith Pete Townshend now suffering a recurrence of his tinnitus ear problems, realistically the days of The Who exploding into action as they did at Leeds some 40 years ago may well be numbered. Their appearance on 30 March this year at London’s Royal Albert Hall in aid of the Teenage Cancer Fund may turn out to have been their last in the UK. They leave behind a legacy equalled by very few. And with Live At Leeds, an album which will forever be acclaimed as one of, if not the very best on-stage recorded remnants of the 20th Century.\n\nThe last defiant word goes to the man formerly of the fringed jacket and twirling mic who was centre stage on 14 February 1970:\n\n“You can always feel what happens to an audience when you move them. And at Leeds University it was the first time that we really had moved an audience and you never forget that. Everything came together at once – the songs, the power of the band, the confidence of the band, the ability of the band. Everything nearly came together all at once, but it still kept its rough edges. The Who were always dangerous. We never ever lost that and still haven’t.”\n\nLIVE AT LEEDS: THE 2006 RETURN\n\nOn Saturday 17 June 2006, 36 years on from the original concert, The Who made an emotional return to Leeds University. It was instigated between University Vice-Chancellor, Professor Michael Arthur and former Leeds University Ents secretary and BBC Radio 3 presenter, Andy Kershaw. Kershaw suggested The Who be the subject of a heritage blue plaque award, with a view to them performing again at the University.\n\n“By sheer coincidence, just two weeks after speaking to Professor Arthur in Leeds about their plans, I met the band’s manager Bill Curbishley backstage at WOMAD,” Kershaw said. “I told Bill I thought it would be great if we got some members of the band to unveil the plaque. Then I said, ‘And while they’re there…’ Bill finished my sentence: ‘They’ll do it.’ And so the idea of a concert began.”\n\nUnder a glare of media spotlight, the unveiling of the plaque and it’s celebratory concert proved a huge success. It reunited many fans in attendance in 1970 and brought back together several of the organisers, including Simon Brogan, the Ents social secretary at the time, Peter Hart, the student stagemanager and Ents team members John Standerline and John Bisbrowne. “We hadn’t seen each other for 30 odd years,” recalled John. “It was fantastic. The Who were still brilliant. I stood in exactly the same place at the balcony top right as I had all those years back. It was quite moving.”\n\nOriginal photographer Chris McCourt was also on hand again with his camera and The Who’s soundman Bob Pridden had a less strenuous night than 36 years previous, as there was no recording pressures to contend with for him personally, though the gig was recorded.\n\nPrior to The Who’s performance, Roger and Pete attended an unveiling of a Civic Trust blue plaque in honor of this “legendary concert venue”. The plaque commemorates The Who’s legendary concert of Valentine’s Day 1970 and “the most celebrated live album of its generation”. To celebrate The Who’s return to Leeds, Sir Peter Blake, art director for The Who’s Face Dances album, contributed a new artwork piece, Live At Leeds 2, which joined other Blake works in the music art gallery at the University’s school of music.\n\nIn 1970, students paid 11s 6d, (57.5p) a ticket. In 2006, tickets were £37.50.\n\nThe Who performed to a capacity crowd of over 2,000. The set list was as follows: Who Are You, I Can’t Explain, The Seeker, Substitute, Sound Round, Pick Up The Peace, Endless Wire, We Got A Hit, They Made My Dream Come True, Mirror Door, Baba O’Riley, Let’s See Action, Relay, Mike Post Theme, Behind Blue Eyes, Cry If You Want, Pinball Wizard, Amazing Journey, Sparks and See Me Feel Me. Encores: Eminence Front, Naked Eye, Won’t Get Fooled Again. The set included the new Wire and Glass mini opera. Six performances were replicated from the original 1970 Valentine’s Day show.\n\n“We’re all back,” shouted Pete Townshend as they came on stage. And they were. After 36 years the walls of the old Leeds refectory resounded to what Pete had affectionately dubbed ‘a huge deafening din’ back in 1970.\n\nSee www.leeds.ac.uk/thewholiveatleeds/2006\n\nLIVE AT LEEDS: THE FORMATS\n\nThe original six-track vinyl LP, released in 1970, was expanded by the 1995 CD to incorporate eight extra songs from the concert. In 2001, a deluxe edition featured the entire concert spread over two CDs, the non-Tommy songs on Disc One, with Tommy occupying all of Disc Two.\n\nORIGINAL 1970 LP The original LP (Track Super 2406 001) and the single CD version issued in the 80s by Polydor (825 339-2) consisted of just six tracks, as detailed below. It was released simultaneously in the US on Decca (DL 79175), and later on CD (MCA MCAD-37000, MFSL UDCD 755).\n\nYOUNG MAN BLUES Jazz pianist Mose Allison (see interview, page 28) first recorded this blues song on 7 March 1957 for his Prestige album Back Country Suite, and it was originally titled Blues. The song was performed during The Who’s early incarnation as The High Numbers in 1964, and was recalled to their set in 1968 as Young Man Blues. In the US this track was planned by The Who’s US record label Decca as the second single released from Live At Leeds, but was cancelled and pulled after a few picture sleeve stock copies were pressed. On the LP’s hand written label the song is listed as Young Man.\n\nThere is an edit on this song which clocked in at 4.45 on the LP version. The unedited original (which has surfaced on bootleg) is slightly longer at 5.08. The Who recorded two studio versions of the song during the Tommy sessions in October 1968. The first version surfaced in July 1969 on the rare Track Records sampler The House That Track Built. An alternate, slower take appeared on the 1998 Odds & Sods CD compilation.\n\nSUBSTITUTE A long term stage favourite – on occasions it was used as a set opener alternating with I Can’t Explain. The original single of Substitute was released in March 1966. It reached No 5 in the UK charts. It was issued in the US on 5th April 1966 but failed to make an impression. It was the only Who single to be issued on the Atco label, part of the Atlantic stable.\n\nSUMMERTIME BLUES First recorded by Eddie Cochran in 1958, other Cochran songs performed by The Who included C’mon Everybody and My Way. The Who incorporated this into their set as far back as 1967. Summertime Blues was also a hit for US heavy rock pioneers Blue Cheer in 1968. At a gig at the Singer Bowl in New York on 2 August 1968, Pete introduced the song as being recorded by Blue Cheer. There are parallels between The Who arrangement and that of Blue Cheer.\n\nThey recorded two studio versions of the song – the first a fast version at De Lane Lea Studios on 24 May 1967 that was released on the extended Deluxe Edition of The Who Sell Out in 2009. A second version was cut at De Lane Studios on 10 October 1967 intended for a BBC broadcast aired on Radio 1 on 15 October. This was issued on the expanded Odds & Sods CD in 1998 (the sleevenotes erroneously state this was recorded on 28 June 1967 at CBS Studios) and as a track on the Live At The BBC bonus disc offered on a limited US edition of the BBC Sessions CD in 2000 available via the Best Buy chain.\n\nSHAKIN’ ALL OVER A 1960 hit for Johnny Kidd & The Pirates, an amazing British rock’n’roll band who included the muchrespected guitarist Mick Green, who died in January this year (singer Johnny Kidd having died in a car accident in 1966). This was one of the songs edited down to appear on the album from a running time of 5.15 to 4.15. There are a few vocal edits plus the removal of an ad hoc version of the Willie Dixon blues standard Spoonful at around 2.24.\n\nThe Who did record a studio version at Advision studios in May 1968, which remains unreleased. They did, however, tape a studio version at IBC Studios, London 13 April 1970 for a BBC session. It included the Spoonful segment. This version was first broadcast on The Dave Lee Travis Show 19 April 1970 with Paul Williams producing. This can be heard on the 2000 BBC Sessions album. The UK issue of BBC Sessions presents this track in its complete state. There were, however, rights issues in the US over the use of Willie Dixon’s Spoonful, so the US MCA version of BBC Sessions has that part of the medley excised. The edit comes at 2.34 on the US version and picks up again 34 seconds later.\n\nMY GENERATION Referred to by Pete Townshend as ‘The Who Hymn’, this riveting 14- minute version incorporates reprised sections from Tommy, including See Me Feel Me, plus various riffs and jams including the chords to their then soon-tobe released single The Seeker and another Townshend composition, Don’t Even Know Myself, during the final instrumental jam.\n\nOn the Canadian version of Live At Leeds (MCA 2022) this track is broken down into the following mini songs: My Generation (Townshend), See Me, Feel Me (We’re Not Gonna Take It) (Townshend), Higher (Townshend, Entwistle, Daltrey, Moon), Overbridge (Townshend, Entwistle, Daltrey, Moon), Coming Out To Get You (Townshend, Entwistle, Daltrey, Moon), Underture (Townshend) and Driving Four (Townshend, Entwistle, Daltrey, Moon).\n\nTo clarify this breakdown, Higher is basically the jam section often used when performing the track Naked Eye live. Overbridge is a jam on Amazing Journey. Underture is a version of Sparks.\n\nThis was another song that was subject to various edits to reduce it down from the fulllength. Generation was originally a No 2 hit single in 1965 in the UK – but a lowly No 74 on the Billboard chart.\n\nMAGIC BUS For the LP version there were several edits made from the original recording, which clocked in at over 10 minutes. The LP presented a truncated seven-minute version. On the restored Deluxe Version, before performing the song, Pete can be heard declaring, “This is the nicest thing that’s happened to us,” before the start.\n\nAnother popular stage number, Magic Bus was originally produced by Kit Lambert at IBC Studios, London in the summer of 1968. It was released as a single on 18 September 1968 and it reached No 26 in the UK charts. It was released earlier in the US on 27 July 1968, reaching No 25 in the Billboard charts. Pete wrote the song around the time of My Generation in 1965. On 20 November 1968, Moon was joined onstage in Liverpool, during a 20-minute version of Magic Bus by The Small Faces’ drummer Kenney Jones and the once, and future, Who drummers performed it together.\n\nMagic Bus has various edits to reduce it from the full length 9.41 version performed on the night down to 7.30. The original release had a backward guitar track near the beginning that was removed for the 1995 issue. Pete Townshend has said: “I produced Live At Leeds and I did a few repairs here and there. At one point in Magic Bus I cut out a bit where John and I and Keith went out of sync and to show that I’d edited it, I took four bars of it and turned it upside down so you know that there’s an edit”. The backwards guitar was removed and replaced with the original sound on both the 1995 and 2001 CDs.\n\nTHE 1995 CD EXPANDED EDITION Polydor UK remastered CD with additional tracks (MCA 527 169-2), released in 1995, and as a limited (and numbered) edition of 1000 that included the paper inserts in an LP size 12 x 12 package (MCAD-11230). For the extended edition, producer and engineer Jon Astley and Andy Macpherson overhauled the original tapes. Pete Townshend commented about the restoration: “There was a dodgy mic cable somewhere and clicks all the way through. On the newly-mastered version we got rid of the clicks, but not all of them. We had to leave a few clicks in because they’ve become legendary.”\n\nThe original LP noted that, ‘Crackling Noises OK Do Not Correct!’ After the crackles were removed electronically on the 1995 CD, this was changed to ‘Crackling Noises Have Been Corrected!’\n\nChronicling the process, Michael Gelfand in Musician magazine revealed that “according to Bob Pridden and Jon Astley some of the split-fed leads running from the stage mics weren’t properly connected, which resulted in intermittent pops that rendered four of the eight tracks (kick drum, snare, bass, and guitar) unusable for much of the event; the concert lasted more than 90 minutes longer than the length of the original record. Thankfully, when the technology needed to de-click arrived the corrupted tracks became available, Astley and Macpherson jumped at the opportunity to fix many previously unlistenable performances.\n\nAfter baking the original analogue tape to prevent it from shedding, Astley recorded the eight original tracks onto a Mitsubishi 32-track recorder, he then recorded an additional eight tracks from there against time code onto a hard disc recorder. Using Cedar Audio’s DDC-1 Declicker to fix the existing clicks, Astley was able to bring the damaged tracks back in time when necessary during the remix process.\n\n“On the original recording, you’ll hear the clicks, and this is in fact why Pete couldn’t use Heaven & Hell and any of the Tommy stuff when Townshend mixed the original record,” recalls Astley.“A Quick One was very bad, Tattoo was very bad, Fortune Teller was very bad. He couldn’t use any of those on the original recording because of all the clicks. It was amazing. The bass track on Heaven & Hell was actually clicking all the way through the song, and I guess people heard it in the audience – maybe that’s why they’re so quiet.”\n\nWith all of the tracks finally usable, Astley and Macpherson set about remixing the entire concert; isolating the individual tracks they were delighted, if not surprised and even amused, by much of what they heard. “There was only one track of ambience,” says Astley, “and it’s not a very nice-sounding ambience, but it’s funny because the record needs it to make it sound the way it does. You wouldn’t choose that kind of ambience on a live recording. It’s a very, very odd-sounding record, and that [ambient track] is part of the charm. That’s probably why it doesn’t sound like anything else.”\n\nSince Astley and Macpherson were recreating certain aspects of the original recording, they decided to ask John Entwistle and Roger Daltrey to re-record some of the vocal tracks 25 years later. “They’d actually gone back in the studio and done backing vocals to double the live stuff on the original album,” he says. Entwistle sang the first line of Heaven & Hell, and Daltrey re-sang the, ‘My name is Ivor, I’m an engine driver,’ on A Quick One.\n\nADDITIONAL TRACKS\n\nThe 1995 CD edition expanded the original six songs from the vinyl version with the following extra tracks:\n\nHEAVEN & HELL John Entwistle’s song was a much used set opener during the 1968-70 era – initially performed as far back as April 1968. The song was deployed as a test run for the equipment and PA. On the Leeds recording it highlighted that John did not have his amp set correctly and missed singing a verse at the beginning of the song. For the remastered edition John recorded enough of a vocal in 1994 to cover up to the point where his 1970 self could take over. The lines overdubbed occur in the phrase, ‘On top of the sky is a place where you go if you’ve done nothing wrong.’ This is one of the performances where the ‘crackling noises’ can still be heard.\n\nThe version used as the B-side to the Summertime Blues single was a slight remix of a studio take recorded on 13 April 1970 at IBC Studios for a BBC radio session. The BBC version, first broadcast on The Dave Lee Travis Show on 19 April 1970, with production from Paul Williams, can be found on the limited US Best Buy chain edition of the 2000 BBC Sessions set, which has seven extra tracks on a bonus Live At The BBC disc.\n\nI CAN’T EXPLAIN Another song often used as a set opener throughout The Who’s career from the 70s onwards. This was The Who’s first single and was released on 15 January 1965. It reached No 8 in the UK charts. In the US, it was released in December 1964 and reached No 97 in the Billboard charts.\n\nFORTUNE TELLER Benny Spellman’s Fortune Teller, written by Allen Toussaint, was a staple of The Who’s live act between 1968 and 1970, first entering the set at the Fillmore East 5 April show. As Roger acknowledges, it was a staple of the 60s British beat boom: “The Rolling Stones, they did it… The Merseybeats, they did it… Wayne Fontana & The Mindbenders, they did it. And now we do it.’’\n\nBefore that he notes that: “This is our first gig in England for a very long time, well it seems like a long time – actually it’s about a month and a half, two months and it’s great to be playing in England again.’’\n\nThe 1995 remastered version mixes out much of John Entwistle’s vocals. The Who recorded a studio version at Advision in London on 29 May 1968, but it remained unreleased until it appeared on The Who’s box set, 30 Years Of Maximum R&B in 1994.\n\nTATTOO A highlight of their third album The Who Sell Out, Tattoo was performed live by The Who from 1967-70 and was revived for their Charlton and New York shows in 1974. The original studio recording was produced by Kit Lambert at IBC Studios, London on 12 October 1967. Tattoo was also performed occasionally after The Who’s 1999 reactivation.\n\nHAPPY JACK The studio recording was produced by Kit Lambert at CBS Studios, London on 10 November 1966. It was released as a single on 3 December and reached No 3 in the UK charts. It was released in the US on 18 March 1967 It was their third single to hit the Billboard charts in the US, reaching No 24. This live track previously appeared on the The Kids Are Alright soundtrack – and, along with the Leeds versions of I’m A Boy and I Can’t Explain, was mixed and placed under consideration as a live maxi-single in 1970. Backing vocals were overdubbed for this track in 1970. However, the rough mono mix version that appears on the Lifehouse To Leeds bootleg retains the concert backing vocals.\n\nI’M A BOY The original recording was produced by Kit Lambert at IBC Studios on 31st July 1966 and released as a single on 26 August. Unfortunately it stalled at No 2 in the UK national charts behind Jim Reeves’ Distant Drums (however it did register at No 1 in the Melody Maker charts – hence Pete’s ‘half hour’ remark on the intro). The single was belatedly released in America on 10 December 1966, but failed to make an impact.\n\nA QUICK ONE WHILE HE’S AWAY An early rock opera – a mainstay of the set up until 1970 and famously performed at The Rolling Stones’ Rock’n’ Roll Circus TV show in December 1968. The six Quick One songs are Her Man’s Gone, Crying Town, We Have A Remedy, Ivor The Engine Driver, Soon Be Home and You Are Forgiven. The original studio recording was done at various London studios and edited together by producer Kit Lambert in November 1966. Pete’s humorous introduction was cut for the 1995 version. The full-length introduction was thankfully restored for the 2001 deluxe edition. For the 1995 remaster, Roger added a vocal overdub for the Ivor The Engine section.\n\nAMAZING JOURNEY/SPARKS The only Tommy extract to be included on the 1995 CD, it appears as part of the opera as a whole as tracks 4 and 5 on disc two of the 2001 CD. Another live version of Sparks, recorded at the 1969 Woodstock festival, appears on The Kids Are Alright soundtrack and in a version lasting a minute longer titled Underture on the 30 Years Of Maximum R&B box set.\n\nTHE 2001 DELUXE EDITION\n\nFinally, in 2001, the entire concert was issued on the Live At Leeds: Deluxe Edition (MCA 088 112 618-2). However, it was not sequenced in the same order as the concert. To enable a seamless split, the Tommy segment appeared on Disc Two. There were again a few minor vocal overdubs fixing previous flaws. Disc One repeated the songs on the 1995 CD version, with the exception of the Amazing Journey/Sparks segment. This was due to the fact that these tracks were part of the complete Tommy and were duly featured on Disc Two of the 2001 deluxe edition\n\nDisc One: Heaven & Hell/I Can’t Explain/ Fortune Teller/Tattoo/Young Man Blues/ Substitute/Happy Jack/I’m A Boy/A Quick One, While He’s Away/Summertime Blues/Shakin’ All Over/My Generation/Magic Bus\n\nDisc Two: TOMMY\n\nOverture: Initially, when performing Tommy live, the segment began with It’s A Boy. The overture was added to the set from their 29 September Amsterdam Concertgebouw show: It’s A Boy/1921/Amazing Journey/Sparks/Eyesight To The Blind (The Hawker) (this Sonny Boy Williamson song has the word ‘blind’ at 31 seconds, which was overdubbed in the studio/ Christmas/Cousin Kevin (another Tommy song (see also Sensation and Welcome) that was never performed live at the time – possibly because Entwistle deliberately wrote it in too high a key for Daltrey’s vocal)/The Acid Queen (Roger’s original chorus vocal was mixed out for the 1995 remaster)/Pinball Wizard (at this point the band steered away from the running order of the original album by going straight past Underture and Do You Think It’s Alright/Fiddle About to Pinball Wizard; this version from Leeds previously came out in 1996 as the B-side of a My Generation single reissue)/Do You Think It’s Alright?/Fiddle About/Tommy Can You Hear Me? (in a live context the mother’s song appears before the doctor’s visit; again, this was not introduced into the live set until the September 1969 Concertgebouw performance)/There’s A Doctor/Go To The Mirror! (there’s a slight edit and fix on this version at around 44 seconds)/ Smash The Mirror/Miracle Cure/Sensation (which is between the two songs above on the studio album, was never performed live at the time; Miracle Cure only entered the Tommy set from September 1969, as did Sally Simpson)/ Sally Simpson/I’m Free (keeping in line with the studio album, this was played in a later position through the 1969-70 live shows. It would later move to a new position immediately following Smash The Mirror when revived in the Who’s 1975/76 tour setlist)/Tommy’s Holiday Camp (credited to Keith Moon but actually composed by Pete Townshend)/We’re Not Gonna Take It (the See Me, Feel Me and Listening To You sections at the end of the song feature newlyoverdubbed studio vocals on the remastered versions; notably ‘help me’ overdubbed at 4.26 and then from 4.50 onwards).\n\nThere are two other live versions of Tommy. The first came out in 1990 with the release of the CD Join Together. This version was more complete than the one on the 2001 Live At Leeds but it was taken from The Who’s 1989 charity concerts that featured Pete primarily on acoustic guitar and a variety of additional performers. The 1996 set The Who Live At The Isle Of Wight Festival 1970 featured the complete Tommy in its correct setting in the middle of the set.\n\nThanks to Andy Neill, Ross Halfin, Richard Barnes, Chris Charlesworth, John Bisbrowne, Ed,Hanel, Luke Pacholski, Paul Humbley and Brian Cady.\n\nAnyway Anywhere Anyhow: The Complete Chronicle Of The Who 1958 -1978 by Andy Neill & Matt Kent (Friedman/Fairfax); Maximum R&B by Richard Barnes (Eel Pie); The Who Concert File by Joe McMichael & ‘Irish’ Jack Lyons (Omnibus Press); www.thewho.com; www.thewho.info\n\nTHE SLEEVE DESIGN\n\nAfter rejecting the idea of using photos from the Leeds and Hull gigs, the Graphreaks design team were brought in. They decided to adopt a simple style, designed to resemble a bootleg. Unauthorised recordings were a hot topic in 1969 and 1970. Working out of America, labels such as Rubber Dubber and Trade Mark Of Quality produced an ever-growing catalogue of under the counter releases. Bob Dylan, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Who would all be victims to what at the time was a big threat to the major record companies.\n\nThe Live At Leeds sleeve was a fairly blatant take on one of the most high-profile bootlegs of the time. Live’R Than You’ll Ever Be was a recording of The Rolling Stones’ Oakland concert from November 1969. This bootleg LP was released in December 1969 – original issues were put out on the Lurch label but the recording was actually produced and manufactured by the label that would become known as Trade Mark of Quality (TMOQ). TMOQ would go on to establish themselves as the pioneer record label in the bootleg business. They were also responsible for the very first unauthorised rock bootleg Bob Dylans’s Great White Wonder, which sold in big quantities.\n\nThe Live’R Than You’ll Ever Be album came packaged in a plain sleeve with either a blue or red stamp proclaiming the title. Graphreaks duly re-created this for The Who Live At Leeds album. Early copies carried a black stamp, all other editions were red or blue. A press release from The Who’s label at the time claimed that the emblem on the cover would be hand-stamped by band members and others in the Track Records office. All original LP issues in the US and UK came with a variety of photographs, facsimiles of documents from The Who’s career, including their contract for Woodstock, and a reproduction of the poster used to promote The Who at their Marquee Club gigs in late 1964. This was later replaced by a poster with a similar design but with the Marquee wording replaced with the slogan “The Who Live At Leeds”. Here’s a full run down of the inserts:\n\nBlack-and-white poster for The Who’s Tuesday night residency at the Marquee Club in 1964.\n\nContract from Premier Talent Associates for the Who’s appearance at the Woodstock festival in August 1969.\n\nPete Townshend’s typewritten lyrics for My Generation, with handwritten notes, 1965.\n\nAccount sheet for The High Numbers, 1964.\n\nLetter from King’s Agency (Variety) Ltd. for a 1965 gig in Swindon that was cancelled due to the promoter fearing bad behaviour.\n\nRejection letter dating from 1964 concerning The High Numbers, sent by John Burgess of EMI Records to co-manager Kit Lambert.\n\nDelivery note, 1967, from Brock’s Fireworks for a gross of Y2 smoke generators (these smoke bombs were used at the climax of the band’s act at the time).\n\nPublicity photo of The Who taken on Coventry Street near London’s Piccadilly Circus on 17 March 1965. The photo was taken by Decca Records photographer, David Wedgbury. The same photo session also resulted in the US sleeve of The Who Sings My Generation and the rear sleeve of 2000’s BBC Sessions release.\n\nList of gigs for 1965 and agreed fees on New Action Limited letterhead paper.\n\nPhotograph of Pete facing the crowd and leaping in the air at The Who’s 1969 Isle Of Wight festival appearance and, on the reverse, Pete’s handwritten line-up of Brian Carroll & The Playboys and his Tommy coda, Listening To You.\n\nNotice before proceedings from Jennings Music demanding the return of a Vox Phantom guitar and case, and a Vox piano bass, dated 6 March 1965.\n\nDoor takings statement from the Marquee Club for 1 December 1964 – Keith and Roger got £2 each for the night, John and Pete £1.\n\nRICHARD EVANS, longtime Who associate and designer of the deluxe edition’s CD package, talks about the Live At Leeds sleeve artwork:\n\nAfter the beautifully extravagant Michael McInnerney sleeve for Tommy, it was a good idea to do something exactly the opposite for Live At Leeds. The idea of making it look like a bootleg came from a Rolling Stones bootleg from a live show in November 1969 called Live’R Than You’ll Ever Be, whose cover was a plain card sleeve with a rubber stamp logo in either blue or red.\n\nI discovered recently that the Graphreaks company were a couple of designers from Polydor’s art department, their ex-art director Bob Fell and Danny Halperin. They worked out of Old Compton Street in Soho in the same building as New Action and Track Records. They did a lot of the compilation albums for Track – plus, of course, the sleeve for Led Zeppelin IV, the old man with his bundle of sticks. The logo for Live At Leeds, incidentally, was designed by Beadrall Sutcliffe.\n\nThe Live At Leeds logo came in three colours. On the first pressing, the rubber stamp was black, then it became blue or red. John Leahy, who was the print production manager at Polydor in 1970, told me that when Live At Leeds first came out it was ordered in such small quantities that the album packaging cost more than the recommended retail price! “Order more and they’ll work out cheaper,” came the cry.\n\nThe inserts all came out of the Track office, I believe. I’ve always loved looking through them. The New Action letterhead with ‘Yr n ’ld cnt’ written at the top always makes me laugh. And the photo of Pete leaping, that was often mistaken for being at Woodstock, was in fact taken at the Isle Of Wight Festival in August 1969.\n\nThere is a legendary story about the inserts. A Who fan, convinced that the inserts within the package for Live At Leeds were the genuine article, got in touch with Who manager Bill Curbishley and said that, in return for a rather large sum of money, he would hand the documents over. So Bill set up a meeting in his office with the guy, and when he turned up for the meeting, he was ushered into Bill’s office only to find him sitting at his desk surrounded by dozens of copies of the inserts lying on his desk, the coffee table, the sofa, pinned on the walls, stuck on the windows. ‘Now, how can I help you?’ asked Bill.\n\nAs for the poster, the Marquee version came first. After The Who played Leeds on 14 February 1970, they returned later in the year in November. At this second gig, special copies of the album were sold with Live At Leeds on the poster. Since then, subsequent reissues have had this version.\n\nIn repackaging the 1995 version, MCA did a good job with the limited edition 12” x 12” package that has all the inserts reproduced. Looking back, it was so exciting to go along to Turnham Green, London, in 1994, to meet Chris McCourt, the photographer who Kit and Chris hired [for 50 quid] to go to Leeds to shoot the gig. And to look through Chris’ contact sheets and see the visuals to accompany the music was just magic. Chris is a very successful furniture designer now, but he’s still very proud of his pictures from that night.\n\nIt was quite a challenge to design a deluxe edition of a package that was originally meant to look like a bootleg. I loved the original package so much, with the rubber stamp and two staples. With the deluxe edition, it was obvious we couldn’t include the inserts, so I showed them individually within the digipak layout as best as I could. There were some nice touches, though – the de-bossing of the logo on the front sleeve. I scanned"
