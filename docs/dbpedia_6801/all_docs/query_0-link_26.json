        "text": "Lara Price\n\nHalf & Half\n\nGulf Coast Records\n\nGenre Fusing Blues That Soars Like a Beautiful Balloon.\n\nWhen I explain our ethos at RMHQ to new reviewers I tell them that we only write about music we like, and the first song on an album is critical to whether we persevere or not ….. Ms Price’s debut on Mike Zito’s Gulf Coast Records, We’re Still There comes out of the traps like a vixen chasing a rabbit and I actually exhaled “Woah there!” the first time I played it, it’s so fresh and genre fusing.\n\nThe album title comes from the fact that the songs were recorded partly in San Francisco and Texas where she now lives; and if you scrape at the musicality with a fine tooth comb, you might be able to tell which is from which …. but I can’t, although knowing in advance makes complete sense when you hear hybrid Blues belters like the funky ass Days Ago, Evidence and The Way Love Goes which are all Contemporary Blues songs filtered through a Classic R&B sieve and will make you want to shout about their quality to all of your like minded friends!\n\nI adore the way Lara switches from kick-ass R&B into becoming a heartbreaking Soul balladeer in the blink of an eye, with her tender rendition of Ann Peebles’ Trouble, Heartbreak and Sadness sounding like Lara has actually lived every word in the song and Things Ain’t Everything could easily be a rare Stax or Atlantic 45 that someone found in a drawer.\n\nLara has had a hand in writing a few songs here, with the vividly detailed Rain and later the punchy The Way Love Goes showcasing a rare songwriting talent that can sing like a Star. BTW on Rain amongst others, her voice soars on the chorus like a beautiful helium filled balloon soaring into the sky.\n\nWhere to go for a Favourite Song hasn’t been easy, with the sabre sharp Heart on a String being a contender from Day 1 alongside the ornery and danceable duet with David Jimenez, Days Ago too; but one song has really grown on me over the last couple of weeks and that’s the blaster of a duet Fools Like Me, a timeless Jack Clement song that I’d not heard before; but the way Lara and Baxter Robertson duet alongside some molten sax from Dr. Matthew Maldonado and Trevor Nealon adding keys worthy of Leon Russell or Chuck Leavell to a tightly wrapped Blues band makes this a definite stand out track, worthy of only a handful of legendary Blues singers.\n\nLike so many of her peers, Lara Price has worked hard at her apprenticeship over the last 25 years and 9 albums (or so) but judging by her performances here; she’s more than ready for this step up into the Big Leagues with Gulf Coast Records.\n\nReleased June 21st 2024\n\nhttps://www.laraprice.com/"
