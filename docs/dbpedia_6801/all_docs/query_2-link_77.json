        "text": "Framed lithographic print of album art for The Who's 1969 album Tommy, signed by Who lead singer Roger Daltrey. Accompanied by LOA (Letter of Authenticity) from Beckett Authentication Services, the piece also includes a certificate indicating it is #624 of a limited edition of only 750.\n\nThe artwork for the Tommy album was created by artist Michael McInnerney. According to Wikipedia, which gets much of the info from Dave Marsh's 1983 book Before I Get Old: The Story of The Who, \"Townshend asked McInnerney to do the cover artwork for Tommy in September 1968... Townshend thought Mike McInnerney, a fellow follower of Meher Baba, would be a suitable choice to do the cover.\n\nAs recording was near completion, McInnerney received a number of cassettes with completed songs and a brief outline for the story, which he immediately recognised as being based on Baba's teachings. He wanted to try and convey the world of a deaf, dumb and blind boy, and decided to 'depict a kind of breaking out of a certain restricted plane into freedom.' \"\n\nThis is a large and impressive display celebrating the legacy of The Who's legendary Tommy album and the group's legendary frontman.\n\nMouse Over to Zoom/Click to Enlarge Photos\n\nFeatures:"
