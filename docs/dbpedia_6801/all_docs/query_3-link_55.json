        "text": "The Who singer and guitarist Roger Daltrey kicked off his new solo tour earlier this week on Monday (June 10). The rocker played to a huge crowd in Pennsylvania, and in between songs, he took time to answer a few questions from fans who had submitted queries ahead of time.\n\nAs he conversed with the audience, Daltrey paid a massive compliment to one of the most beloved groups of all time. It seems that he’s not just a fan, but someone who respects what they do–even seemingly placing them above his own band.\n\nA concert attendee asked Daltrey if he had a favorite rock band, and his answer was simple and unambiguous. “There’s only one great rock ‘n’ roll band, that’s The Rolling Stones,” the musician stated, according to American Songwriter.\n\nDaltrey added to his answer by recalling some of the earliest days of The Who. The band used to open for The Rolling Stones, and that’s apparently when he fell even more in love with the band…and also when he learned just how incredible their frontman was (and still is).\n\n“No one was gonna out-front Mick Jagger,” Daltrey commented about the legendary singer. “They were fantastic in those days, and they still are,” he said confidently, showing that he not only loved the group decades ago, but that he’s still a fan and he remains impressed with what they can do on stage.\n\nDaltrey’s latest trek is scheduled to play dates all across the U.S. throughout the month of June. Currently, the rocker has 11 shows planned, including one in Canada.\n\nThe venture sees Daltrey performing a mix of tunes from various moments in his career. He treats fans to several cuts from The Who, which sound a bit different coming from him and him alone. Daltrey also showcases various songs from his solo career, and even includes a cover or two."
