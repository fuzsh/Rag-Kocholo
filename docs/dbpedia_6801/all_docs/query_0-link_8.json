        "text": "Jim Adams invited me to participate in Song Lyric Sunday for his blog. This week’s prompt is…”a song that features a great bass line.” I knew it was going to be a Who song…and I changed it at the last minute from My Generation to this. This song has some incredible bass.\n\nI have played music since I was around 14-15 and bass since I was around 15. I started out with an acoustic guitar with 2 strings. I could play Smoke on the Water, Down on the Corner, and other songs with those two strings. Soon I graduated to 6 strings and learned chords. A buddy of mine played guitar and he was more advanced than I was at the time.\n\nWe decided I would play bass and he would play guitar. I got a job cleaning up a vacant lot that had a massive mess for two days and earned around 50 bucks…and in the early 1980s…that could get you a decent bass guitar in a pawn shop. I learned by ear. We would listen to a record…slow it down to the slowest speed on the turntable and start figuring it out. I’m glad I learned that way because I can pick things out by listening.\n\nHearing this song around 8 years after it was released for the first time was exciting for me. It was a huge influence on how I played. I always made sure in any band I was in…the bass was heard. You could feel it in your chest… I made sure of that. I would hear some say…”Max is on 11 again.”\n\nWhere do I start with this song?\n\nOne of the most exciting songs of The Who. It was on the Mod concept album Quadrophenia. Roger and Pete are excellent in this song but John and Keith really stand out. The bass and drums do the heavy lifting in this song. It peaked at #92 in 1974.\n\nI have sat for hours with a bass in my hand trying to get the runs right to this song. One of John’s best bass parts. I usually tie my fingers into knots trying to get this right. It wasn’t one of their huge hits but it was absolutely perfect for me.\n\nI’ve never heard a hard rock band this tight yet carry a great melody underneath it all. John’s bass playing in this song is so good and he makes it sound almost normal. That is why I’ll always be in awe of The Who. Give me their rhythm section of Entwistle and Moon and I could rule the world. The word “revolutionized” is overused at times…but yes Entwistle did revolutionize the bass guitar as Moon did the drums.\n\nThe album told the story of a young mod named Jimmy. This song is about Jimmy’s inner turmoil and his quest to understand who he really is. He seeks answers and validation from his mother, a psychiatrist, and God, but finds no clear resolution. The album explores themes of identity, rebellion, and disillusionment. Pete Townshend wrote this and put a little of each band member’s personality in the character.\n\nJohn Entwistle: “The Real Me” was the first take. I was joking when I did that bass part. The band said, “Wow, that’s great, that’s great!” And I was just messing around. They just loved the song. I was sitting on top of my speaker cabinet playing a silly bass part and that’s the one they liked.\n\nJohn Entwistle: I think if you listen to my bass parts on their own, they sound unbelievably disjointed, but when you play them with the other instruments on the track, they fit. That’s what comes from playing with Keith.\n\nSpeaking of my favorite rhythm section…here is an isolated recording of JUST the bass and drums.\n\nThe Real Me\n\nI went back to the doctor\n\nTo get another shrink\n\nI sit and tell him ’bout my weekend\n\nBut he never betrays what he thinks\n\nWoo\n\nCan you see the real me, doctor?\n\nDoctor?\n\nCan you see the real me, doctor?\n\nWoah, doctor\n\nI went back to my mother\n\nI said I’m crazy ma, help me\n\nShe said I know how it feels son\n\n‘Cause it runs in the family\n\nCan you see the real me, mama?\n\nMama?\n\nCan you see the real me, mama?\n\nWoah, mama\n\nCan you see\n\nCan you see the real me?\n\nCan you see\n\nCan you see the real me\n\nThe real me\n\nThe real me\n\nThe cracks between the paving stones\n\nLook like rivers of flowing veins\n\nStrange people who know me\n\nPeeping from behind every window pane\n\nThe girl I used to love\n\nLives in this yellow house\n\nYesterday she passed me by\n\nShe doesn’t want to know me now\n\nCan you see the real me?\n\nCan ya?\n\nCan ya?\n\nCan you see the real me?\n\nCan ya?\n\nWoah, yeah\n\nI ended up with a preacher\n\nFull of lies and hate\n\nI seemed to scare him a little\n\nSo he showed me to the golden gate\n\nCan you see the real me, preacher?\n\nPreacher?\n\nCan you see the real me, preacher?\n\nCan you see\n\nCan you see\n\nCan you see\n\nWoah\n\nCan you see the real me, doctor?\n\nCan you see the real me, ma?\n\nCan you see the real me (me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me)?\n\n…\n\nStarting with The Who’s Tommy album…everything after that gets noticed. Their brilliant early singles sometimes get criminally overlooked. Personally, and I know I am in the minority, I think many of their early singles trump both the Beatles’ and Stones’s early singles. The Who and Kinks didn’t have the quality of the sound of those bigger bands…but that was the point. Those singles were exciting and raw…a few experimental. Paul McCartney was influenced heavily by The Who when he wrote Paperback Writer and Helter Skelter.\n\nOn July 8, 1989, I traveled to Atlanta Georgia to see The Who for the first time. Nashville at that time had no place really big enough for them to play. Vanderbilt wasn’t allowing rock concerts at their stadium at that time. I’ll never forget when The Who played this song that night. Roger forgot the words to it and said “I don’t know the bloody words to this song.” I found the clip and I’ll have it below.\n\nThe only part of that concert that bothered me was the volume or the lack of really. Entwistle had to turn down his volume and they carried a brass section with them because of Pete’s tinnitus. It sounded great of course but not as in your face as when I saw them in Nashville in 2016. My only guess is now the PA equipment is better because The Who were much louder in 2016 than when I heard them in 1989.\n\nDescribing The Who’s next new single (Pictures of Lily)…Pete Townshend coined the term “Power Pop” to describe this song before it was released. It made it to #4 in the UK Charts, #60 on the Billboard 100, and #36 in Canada in 1967. The song tells the story of a father giving his son risque pictures of a woman taken in the 1920s…and after a while, the son finds out that she had died many years ago.\n\nIt is a song about the lust of a teenage boy…we will keep it at that. John Entwistle played the French Horn on this that he later didn’t like.\n\nPete Townshend: On Karen’s (his future wife) bedroom wall were three Victorian black-and-white postcard photographs of scantily dressed actresses. One was the infamous Lily Langtry, mistress of Prince Edward, later King Edward VII, and one sunny afternoon while Karen was at work I scribbled out a lyric inspired by the images and made a demo of ‘Pictures of Lily’. My song was intended to be an ironic comment on the sexual shallows of show business, especially pop, a world of postcard images for boys and girls to fantasise over. ‘Pictures of Lily’ ended up, famously, being about a boy saved from burgeoning adolescent sexual frustration when his father presented him with dirty postcards over which he could masturbate.\n\nJohn Entwistle: “The thing I hate about ‘Pictures Of Lily’ is that bloody elephant call on the French horn. I also hated the backing vocals, the mermaid voices, where we’d sing all the ‘oooooohs.’ I hated ‘oooooohs.'”\n\nBelow is the concert I was at when Roger forgot the words. It’s around the 1:36 mark.\n\nPictures Of Lily\n\nI used to wake up in the morning\n\nI always feel so glad\n\nI got so sick of having sleepless nights\n\nI went and told my dad\n\nHe said, “Son, now here’s some little somethings”\n\nAnd stuck them on my wall\n\nAnd now my nights ain’t quite so lonely\n\nIn fact I don’t feel bad at all (I don’t feel bad at all)\n\nPictures of Lily that make my life so wonderful\n\nPictures of Lily that let me sleep at night\n\nPictures of Lily that solved my childhood problem\n\nPictures of Lily, they make me feel alright\n\nPictures of Lily (pictures of Lily)\n\nPictures of Lily (Lily, oh Lily)\n\nPictures of Lily (Lily, oh Lily)\n\nPictures of Lily (pictures of Lily)\n\nPictures of Lily, pictures of Lily\n\nPictures of Lily, pictures of Lily\n\nAnd then one day things weren’t so fine\n\nI fell in love with Lily\n\nI asked my dad where Lily I could find\n\nHe said, “Don’t be silly”\n\n“She’s been dead since 1929”\n\nOh, how I cried that night\n\nIf only I’d been born in Lily’s time\n\nIt would have been alright\n\nThere were always pictures of Lily to help me sleep at night\n\nPictures of Lily to help me feel alright\n\n‘Cause me and Lily are together in my dreams (my mind)\n\nAnd I was wonderin’, mister, have you ever seen?\n\nPictures of Lily to help you sleep at night\n\nPictures of Lily to help you feel alright\n\n‘Cause me and Lily are together in my dreams\n\nAnd I was wonderin’, mister, have you ever seen\n\nPictures of Lily?\n\nI was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth\n\nThe north side of my town faced east, and the east was facing south\n\nAmerica missed out on The Who’s great early singles. Some didn’t hear their 60’s singles until after they hit with Tommy and released Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy in 1971. It’s one of my favorite compilation albums. This one has a raw power to it and it’s pushed by John Entwistle and Keith Moon driving the song along.\n\nGreat song by The Who. The song peaked at #5 in the UK charts in 1966. The twelve-string guitar opening riff kicks into one of The Who’s best singles. This was a flop in the US, partly because it wasn’t promoted well. It was the only Who song released on Atco Records.\n\nTownshend’s favorite song at the time was “Tracks of My Tears” by Smokey Robinson & The Miracles. Townshend loved the way Smokey sang the word “substitute” so perfectly “Although she may be cute she’s just a substitute ‘Cause you’re the permanent one” that he decided to celebrate the word with a song all its own. The song was also influenced by 19th Nervous Breakdown by the Rolling Stones. Townshend admitted to getting the riff from that song. Townshend also got his trademark windmill from watching Keith Richards warm up with his arms going above his head.\n\nThis was the first single The Who released after breaking their contract with their manager and producer, Shel Talmy. As part of the deal, Talmy got royalties from this and the other Who records over the next 5 years, which turned out to be albums that old-time producer Shel Talmy would never have produced. The albums were Tommy, Who’s Next, and Quadrophenia.\n\nAfter listening to a recording of the song, Keith Moon began to become paranoid, insisting that it wasn’t him drumming and that the band had gone behind his back and gotten another drummer. John Entwistle refuted this paranoia as ridiculous – he could hear Keith screaming on the recording as he did a difficult fill.\n\nSubstitute\n\nYou think we look pretty good together\n\nYou think my shoes are made of leather\n\nBut I’m a substitute for another guy\n\nI look pretty tall but my heels are high\n\nThe simple things you see are all complicated\n\nI look pretty young, but I’m just back-dated, yeah\n\n(Substitute) your lies for fact\n\n(Substitute) I can see right through your plastic mac\n\n(Substitute) I look all white, but my dad was black\n\n(Substitute) my fine linen suit is really made out of sack\n\nI was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth\n\nThe north side of my town faced east, and the east was facing south\n\nAnd now you dare to look me in the eye\n\nThose crocodile tears are what you cry\n\nIt’s a genuine problem, you won’t try\n\nTo work it out at all you just pass it by, pass it by\n\n(Substitute) me for him\n\n(Substitute) my coke for gin\n\n(Substitute) you for my mum\n\n(Substitute) at least I’ll get my washing done\n\nI’m a substitute for another guy\n\nI look pretty tall but my heels are high\n\nThe simple things you see are all complicated\n\nI look pretty young, but I’m just back-dated, yeah\n\nI was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth\n\nThe north side of my town faced east, and the east was facing south\n\nAnd now you dare to look me in the eye\n\nThose crocodile tears are what you cry\n\nIt’s a genuine problem, you won’t try\n\nTo work it out at all you just pass it by, pass it by\n\n(Substitute) me for him\n\n(Substitute) my coke for gin\n\n(Substitute) you for my mum\n\n(Substitute) at least I’ll get my washing done\n\n(Substitute) your lies for fact\n\n(Substitute) I can see right through your plastic mac\n\n(Substitute) I look all white, but my dad was black\n\n(Substitute) My fine-looking suit is really made out of sack\n\nThis was a non-album single released in 1972. It was released between Who’s Next (1971) and Quadrophenia (1973).\n\nPete Townshend wrote this… it was part of his “Lifehouse” project, which was a film script featuring The Who in a future world where rock ‘n’ roll saves the masses. The Who scrapped plans for the concept double album and released most of the songs on Who’s Next…pretty much agreed their best album and one of the best in rock period.\n\nTownshend’s use of the ARP synthesizer on Who’s Next was groundbreaking. He didn’t just add texture to it but the ARP became part of the structure of the songs. This was not like today’s synthesizer where you just took it out of the box. It had to be programmed and connected together…and not many people knew how to do it. He took a risk using it because technology in general always moving ahead, Who’s Next could have sounded dated a few years afterward but it still sounds fresh and interesting today…unlike some other synth music.\n\nThey played this song on the Russell Harty Show and Harty looked terrified of The Who. Harty was a gay man which was secret in the 1970s… Keith knew this and you could tell he thought Keith Moon was going to say something out loud in an interview but of course Keith didn’t. He was messing with Harty and the interview is both funny and demented to watch. I keep thinking….an interview like this would not happen today. What makes the interview funnier is how Daltrey and Entwistle just chill in the background while Moon and Townshend torment Harty.\n\nThey were joking around with Harty and you could see Harty tense up a bit when Moon stripped down to his underwear. Moon and Townshend then preceded to rip and tear each other’s shirt off.\n\nHarty asked them some questions and if they were all married. That was when Moon started to talk about messing with Harty’s sleeves (as Pete and Keith did to each other) he said to Harty “You leave his sleeves alone… personal them ay…Can’t touch the interviewer can we? Hey he is in command isn’t he? You can make everyone else look like a right twit as long as you don’t have a go at him. How long have you been happily married? ” You have to wonder by the look on Harty’s face if he thought Moon was going to say something out loud…he did know Harty was gay…but of course, Moon didn’t…he was just having fun with him.\n\nSomeone put all the Rusell Harty short interview segments together from the documentary The Kids Are Alright…I have it below.\n\nAnyway…a good song and it peaked at #21 in the UK, #50 in Canada, and #39 on the Billboard 100 in 1972.\n\nRelay\n\nYou can hear it in the street, see it in the dragging feet\n\nThe word is gettin’ out about control\n\nSpies they’ve come and gone, the story travels on\n\nThe only quiet place is inside your soul\n\nFrom tree to tree, from you to me\n\nTravelin’ twice as fast as on any freeway\n\nEvery single dream, wrapped up in the scheme\n\nThey all get carried on the relay\n\nRelay, things are brewin’\n\nRelay, something’s doin’\n\nRelay, there’s a revolution\n\nRelay, relay\n\n(Hand me down a solution, yeah)\n\nPass it on, come on, a relay\n\nSomeone disapproves, what you say and do\n\nI was asked to see what I could really learn you\n\nDon’t believe your eyes, they’re tellin’ only lies\n\nWhat is done in the first place don’t concern you\n\nFrom tree to tree, from you to me\n\nTravelin’ twice as fast as on any freeway\n\nEvery single dream wrapped up in the scheme\n\nThey all get carried on the relay\n\nRelay, things are brewin’\n\nRelay, something’s doin’\n\nRelay, there’s a revolution\n\nRelay, relay\n\n(Hand me down a solution, yeah)\n\nPass it on, pass it on, pass it on, hey you, pass it on\n\nWe’re on the relay, get a movin’\n\nGet on a movin’ on\n\nThe relay, the relay\n\nThe relay, the relay\n\nThis song was on the album called The Who Sell Out. I’ve said before that titles sometimes grab my attention and this one certainly did. This one has had many covers from other bands and artists.\n\nThe Who Sell Out is A Pop Art album that was fashioned after Pirate radio. The Who created spoof promo slots for Radio London, Premier Drums and Rotosound Strings, recorded in the brash ad-speak of 60s pirate radio. John Entwistle wrote two commercial jingles for Heinz Beans and Medac spot pimple cream.\n\nPete Townshend: “I’d already written two songs for [co-manager] Kit Lambert for the American Cancer Society – Little Billy and Kids! Do You Want Kids? – and I had Odorono, about a girl who loses a record contract. It wasn’t meant to be a commercial, it was just a song about body odor.”\n\nI always thought it was a brilliant idea and remains a great satirical take on 60s consumerism.\n\nThe song would be the B side in America to I Can See For Miles.\n\nThe album was released on December 16, 1967. It peaked at #13 in the UK and #48 in the Billboard Album Charts. Their album Tommy would be released 2 years after this one and it would be their breakthrough all over the world.\n\nCritic Dave Marsh called it “the greatest rock and roll album of its era” and “the Who’s consummate masterpiece, the work that holds together most tightly as concept and realization”.\n\nPete Townshend on the album: I’d demoed ‘Tattoo’ in my hotel room in Las Vegas during our three-day vacation, and a song called ‘Odorono’, named after a deodorant stick. ‘Odorono’ led us to the most perfect pop idea of all time: we would make our next record a vehicle for advertising. When we called Kit to explain, he was as excited as we were. I suggested we link the gaps between songs with jingles like those on commercial pirate radio.\n\nJohn and Keith leapt on the idea, and, inspired by ‘Odorono’, began making up advertising jingles for all kinds of things, like Medac spot cream, Premier Drums and Heinz Baked Beans. But when the album was ready to be put together we were still short of tracks. John’s track didn’t feel right either, so he quickly produced a demo for another song called ‘Silas Stingy’, which, to be honest, was equally eccentric. But this was obviously going to be a very eccentric record.\n\nWho – Mary Anne With The Shaky Hand\n\nI danced with Linda\n\nI danced with Jean\n\nI danced with Cindy\n\nThen I suddenly see\n\nMary-Anne with the shaky hands\n\nWhat they’ve done to her man\n\nThose shaky hands\n\nMary is so pretty\n\nThe prettiest in the land\n\nGuys come from every city\n\nJust to shake her shaky hands\n\nLinda can cook\n\nJean reads books\n\nCindy can sew\n\nBut I’d rather know\n\nMary-Anne with the shaky hands\n\nWhat they’ve done to her man\n\nThose shaky hands\n\nMary-Anne with the shaky hands\n\nWhat they’ve done to her man\n\nThose shaky hands\n\nMary-Anne with the shaky hands\n\nWhat they’ve done to her man\n\nThose shaky hands\n\nThis song was originally on the Who’s Next album released in 1971…my favorite album of that year and maybe of the seventies. That year was an incredible time for albums. Led Zeppelin would release their most remembered album Led Zeppelin IV a few months after Who’s Next.\n\nThere is not a bad song on the album. Roger excels on this song and it builds up in the middle for good dynamics. In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked Getting In Tune number 8 on its list of the 50 greatest songs by The Who. Nicky Hopkins plays piano on this song.\n\nThe Who’s Next album is one of the most sonic-sounding albums I’ve ever heard. Glyn Johns produced it and said this: “I have a residing memory of sitting in the truck, my hair being parted by what was coming out of the speakers, a massive amount of adrenaline coursing through my veins. There have been a few occasions over the years when I have been completely blown away, believing without a doubt that what I was listening to would become much more than just commercially successful but also a marker in the evolution of popular music, and this was one of those moments.”\n\nPete Townshend originally wrote this about a character in his “Lifehouse” project, which was going to be a film similar to The Who’s Tommy and Quadrophenia. Townshend never finished “Lifehouse,” but the songs ended up on the great album Who’s Next.\n\nPete Townshend wrote this as part of his “Lifehouse” project. He wanted to release a film about a futuristic world where the people are enslaved… but saved by a rock concert. Pete couldn’t get enough support to finish the project, but most of the songs he wrote were used on the Who’s Next album.\n\nTownshend’s use of the ARP synthesizer on Who’s Next was groundbreaking. He didn’t just add texture to it but the ARP became part of the structure of the songs. This was not like today’s synthesizer where you just took it out of the box. It had to be programmed and connected together…and not many people knew how to do it. He took a risk using it because technology in general always moving ahead, Who’s Next could have sounded dated a few years afterward but it still sounds fresh and interesting today…unlike some 1980s synth music.\n\nThe album peaked at #4 on the Billboard Album Charts, #1 in the UK, and #5 in Canada in 1971. It also peaked at #7 on the US Billboard Top Pop Catalog in 2014.\n\nGetting In Tune\n\nI’m singing this note ’cause it fits in well with the chords I’m playing\n\nI can’t pretend there’s any meaning hidden in the things I’m saying\n\nBut I’m in tune\n\nRight in tune\n\nI’m in tune\n\nAnd I’m gonna tune\n\nRight in on you\n\nRight in on you\n\nRight in on you\n\nI get a little tired of having to say\n\n“Do you come here often?”\n\nBut when I look in your eyes, I see the harmonies\n\nAnd the heartaches soften\n\nI’m getting in tune\n\nRight in tune\n\nI’m in tune\n\nAnd I’m gonna tune\n\nRight in on you (right in on you)\n\nRight in on you (right in on you)\n\nRight in on you\n\nI got it all here in my head\n\nThere’s nothing more needs to be said\n\nI’m just bangin’ on my old piano\n\nI’m getting in tune to the straight and narrow\n\n(Getting in tune to the straight and narrow)\n\nGetting in tune to the straight and narrow\n\n(I’m getting in tune to the straight and narrow)\n\nYeah, I’m getting in tune to the straight and narrow\n\n(I’m getting in tune to the straight and narrow)\n\nI’m singing this note ’cause it fits in well with the way I’m feeling\n\nThere’s a symphony that I hear in your heart, sets my head a-reeling\n\nBut I’m in tune\n\nRight in tune\n\nI’m in tune\n\nAnd I’m gonna tune\n\nRight in on you (right in on you)\n\nRight in on you (right in on you)\n\nRight in on you\n\nBaby, with you\n\n(Baby, with you)\n\nBaby, with you\n\n(Baby, with you)\n\nBaby, with you\n\nI’ve got it all here in my head\n\nThere’s nothing more needs to be said\n\nI’m just bangin’ on my old piano\n\nI’m getting in tune to the straight and narrow\n\nGetting in tune to the straight and narrow\n\nI’m getting in tune to the straight and narrow\n\nGetting in tune to the straight and narrow\n\nI’m getting in tune to the straight and narrow\n\n(Getting in tune to the straight and narrow)\n\nYeah, I’m getting in tune to the straight and narrow\n\n(Getting in tune to the straight and narrow)\n\nYeah, I’m getting in tune to the straight and narrow\n\n(Getting in tune to the straight and narrow)\n\nYeah, I’m getting in tune to the straight and narrow, yeah\n\n(Getting in tune to the straight and narrow)\n\n(Getting in tune to the straight and narrow)\n\n(Getting in tune to the straight and narrow)\n\n(Getting in tune to the straight and narrow)\n\n(I’m getting in tune to the straight and narrow)\n\nYeah, I’m getting in tune to the straight and narrow\n\n(I’m getting in tune to the straight and narrow)\n\n(I’m getting in tune to the straight and narrow)\n\nMy friend Dave first posted this article I wrote here on an episode of Turntable Talk. For those who didn’t see it…here it is. Cincinnati Babyhead also reviewed this on Hanspostcard’s site.\n\nDave asked a question: Is there an act that actually comes out better on live releases than studio ones?\n\nFirst, let me say…overall I’m more of a record guy…I usually like the studio version of songs but yes there are some bands that can come off better. I would say The Who, Allman Brothers, Cream, The Grateful Dead, Aerosmith, The Stones (1969-1972), and Bob Dylan’s “1966 tour.” However, there is one condition to this.\n\nI think you have to take into consideration the era you are talking about with each band or artist. If we are talking about the peak years then yes. The Rolling Stones for instance…for me it would be 1969 through 1974. When they had Mick Taylor on guitar…they had a huge raw sound live they haven’t had since. With Dylan, the 66 tour for me was the top and I could listen to those versions all day. The Who it would be 1969 through 1976 when they were untouchable live. But I’m not saying I don’t like other years with these artists…but those are known as the peak years.\n\nWhen the Who took Tommy on tour I think the live recordings beat the studio album by a long shot. That leads me to…my favorite live rock album of all time.\n\nFrom Classic Rock website ranking Who albums: “We usually don’t include live albums in our rankings, but ‘Live at Leeds’ is no ordinary live album. Like ‘Live at the Apollo,’ ‘At Fillmore East,’ ‘At Folsom Prison’ and a handful of other classic concert records, it transcends the genre, turning a quick record-company cash turnaround into a statement of purpose.”\n\nThe Who: Live at Leads. If you are a rock and roll fan, a rock fan, or even a heavy metal fan…everyone can find something on that album. This is guitar rock at its best. Listening to the sound of that record, it’s no telling how loud they played. They weren’t the loudest in the Guinness Book of World Records for nothing! When Pete hit a power chord you could almost feel your eardrums retract in and out like a speaker.\n\nIt’s not being loud though that makes it so great. Personally, I’ve never heard a band as tight as they were during this tour. They wanted to release a live album and soundman Bob Pridden had 38 shows taped. Pete wanted Pridden to go through all shows and tell him which one was best. Because of constant touring Pridden could never get through all of the shows. The day came and Pete asked him ok…which shows. He couldn’t give Pete an answer.\n\nThey had a show at Leeds and Hull coming up on the schedule. In a move he’d later label “one of the stupidest decisions of my life,” Townshend told Pridden to burn the tapes so that they’d never wind up in the hands of bootleggers. So, instead of more shows from that era…we have very few.\n\nSo…now the tapes were burned and the Leeds and Hull concert was coming up. They had a lot of pressure to get it right for the live album.\n\nPete Townshend: “I played more carefully than usual and tried to avoid the careless bum notes that often occurred because I was trying to play and jump around at the same time. The next day we played a similar set in City Hall in Hull. This was another venue with good acoustics for loud rock, but it felt less intense than the previous night.”\n\nThey played most of the Tommy album and their “oldies” on this tour, which was songs only around 5-6 years old. The original Live at Leeds didn’t have any Tommy songs on it. This album was like a marker for the pre-Tommy Who coming to an end. The deluxe re-released version had the complete show full of Tommy material\n\nThe recordings had a few clicks in the tape and Townshend tried to maneuver around them.\n\nTownshend tried slicing out the clicks with a razor blade and quickly realized it would be impossible to get all of them. But subpar-sounding bootlegs were flooding the market at this time, so the band just added a note to the label saying the clicks were intentional! The album cover was a faded stamp reading “The Who: Live at Leeds” on brown paper, mirroring the look of illegal vinyl bootlegs of the era. Later on, Aerosmith had a similar live bootleg album cover.\n\nWhat impresses me is the only overdubbing on the album was the backup vocals because they were poorly recorded. John Entwistle and Pete did the backup vocals in one take in the studio to stay true to the live album. What you hear on the album is what the good people at Leeds heard that night. No massive overdubbing to tighten anything up.\n\nBy 1970 The Who had been touring almost non-stop since 1964 and it showed on this album. After the album, the band didn’t tour as much as before. They worked in the studio on more complex albums Who’s Next and Quadrophenia. Their tours were not the marathon tours of the sixties.\n\nThis was before Won’t Get Fooled Again, Baba O’Riley, and Quadrophenia’s complex music that required backing tapes live. This album was The Who as nature intended… a very loud tight rock band and possibly the best live rock album.\n\nBTW…Bob Pridden worked as The Who’s soundman until 2016 when he retired.\n\nHere are three examples. Young Man Blues. Listen to Moon and Entwistle intertwine with each other. You also have Summertime Blues and A Quick One, While He’s Away.\n\nThe Who : Maximum R&B at it’s best.\n\n…\n\nYoung Man Blues was written by jazz artist Mose Allison in 1957. Mose’s version is jazzy and smooth. The Who took the song and set it afire with an explosive charge. Mose Allison called The Who’s version The “Command Performance” of his song. That’s a great compliment from the author. Pete was a big fan of Mose Allison. He has said that if he never heard this song he would not have written My Generation.\n\nThe Who version has great dynamics. The bass and drums are all over the place and yet perfect. The Who sound like they are driving near a cliff and you know the song is going to fall off but they save it at the last moment time after time. The song was on the Live At Leeds album released in 1970.\n\nThe key to this song and most Who songs was the rhythm section. Keith Moon and John Entwistle pushed each other to greatness. The frenetic chaotic bass and drums made it exciting. You had the lead guitar player punching in licks between the lead bass and drums. Later on, when Keith passed away and Kenney Jones took his place…they were not the same. That is nothing against Jones…he was one of the best British drummers at that time but that touch of insanity was gone permanently.\n\nA year or so before John Entwistle died, Roger Daltrey was complaining about John’s volume on stage to Pete. Pete replied that without that volume and John’s style…they are not the Who. That was a true statement. I saw the Who with John and later on without him. It wasn’t the same. Was it a great show without him? Yes, the songs were great but that element of danger was gone. That is what both Keith and John added to the Who.\n\nSo I’ll take this note for myself… February 14, 1970… I’ll buy a ticket for Leeds University when I get my time machine working…I’ll take some cotton balls though.\n\nYoung Man Blues\n\nOh well a young man ain’t got nothin’ in the world these days\n\nI said a young man ain’t got nothin’ in the world these days\n\nYou know in the old days\n\nWhen a young man was a strong man\n\nAll the people they’d step back\n\nWhen a young man walked by\n\nBut you know nowadays\n\nIt’s the old man,\n\nHe’s got all the money\n\nAnd a young man ain’t got nothin’ in the world these days\n\nI said nothing\n\nEverybody knows that a young man ain’t got nothin’\n\nEverybody!\n\nEverybody knows that a young man ain’t got nothin’\n\nHe got nothin’\n\nNothin’\n\nTake it easy on the young man\n\nThey ain’t got nothin’ in the world these days\n\nI said they ain’t got nothin’!\n\nThey got sweet fuck-all!\n\n….\n\nI have a bootleg concert of The Who in 1976 in Houston. This song is very dynamic and powerful live. This was released in August 1976 in Canada and the US with “Dreaming From The Waist” as its B side. It was on the album The Who By Numbers and it peaked at #8 in the Billboard Album charts, #7 in the UK, #9 in Canada and #29 in New Zealand in 1976.\n\nThe Who played this song in 1976 but after they didn’t play it much at all until the 50h anniversary tour.\n\nPete Townshend wrote this song, which uses imagery as metaphor for life in the music business. Much of the album deals with his frustrations with the industry, of being obsolete as a 30-year-old rock star. Oh, how times have changed now.\n\nPete usually wrote a lot of songs for the band to pick from for an album. This time they recorded everything he wrote because he was going through writer’s block at the time.\n\nIt’s one of my favorite Who album covers. They usually took turns on who would think of the album cover. It was John Entwistle’s turn and he drew the album cover along with numbers.\n\nJohn Entwistle on the cover\n\n“The first piece of artwork released is The Who by Numbers cover, which I never got paid for, so now I’m going to get paid. We were taking it in turns to do the covers. It was Pete’s turn before me and we did the Quadrophenia cover, which cost about the same as a small house back then, about £16,000. My cover cost £32\n\nPete Townshend: “‘Slip Kid’ came across as a warning to young kids getting into music that it would hurt them – it was almost parental in its assumed wisdom.”\n\nPete Townshend on The Who By Numbers: I felt partly responsible because the Who recording schedule had, as usual, dragged on and on, sweeping all individuals and their needs aside. Glyn worked harder on The Who by Numbers than I’ve ever seen him. He had to, not because the tracks were weak or the music poor but because the group was so useless. We played cricket between takes or went to the pub. I personally had never done that before. I felt detached from my own songs, from the whole record. Recording the album seemed to take me nowhere. Roger [Daltrey] was angry with the world at the time. Keith [Moon] seemed as impetuous as ever, on the wagon one minute, off the next. John [Entwistle] was obviously gathering strength throughout the whole period; the great thing about it was he seemed to know we were going to need him more than ever before in the coming year\n\nSlip Kid\n\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight …\n\nI’ve got my clipboard, text books\n\nLead me to the station\n\nYeah, I’m off to the civil war\n\nI’ve got my kit bag, my heavy boots\n\nI’m runnin’ in the rain\n\nGonna run till my feet are raw\n\nSlip kid, slip kid, second generation\n\nAnd I’m a soldier at thirteen\n\nSlip kid, slip kid, realization\n\nThere’s no easy way to be free\n\nNo easy way to be free\n\nIt’s a hard, hard world\n\nI left my doctor’s prescription bungalow behind me\n\nI left the door ajar\n\nI left my vacuum flask\n\nFull of hot tea and sugar\n\nLeft the keys right in my car\n\nSlip kid, slip kid, second generation\n\nOnly half way up the tree\n\nSlip kid, slip kid, I’m a relation\n\nI’m a soldier at sixty-three\n\nNo easy way to be free\n\nSlip kid, slip kid\n\nKeep away old man, you won’t fool me\n\nYou and your history won’t rule me\n\nYou might have been a fighter, but admit you failed\n\nI’m not affected by your blackmail\n\nYou won’t blackmail me\n\nI’ve got my clipboard, text books\n\nLead me to the station\n\nYeah, I’m off to the civil war\n\nI’ve got my kit bag, my heavy boots\n\nI’m runnin’ in the rain\n\nGonna run till my feet are raw\n\nSlip kid, slip kid, slip out of trouble\n\nSlip over here and set me free\n\nSlip kid, slip kid, second generation\n\nYou’re slidin’ down the hill like me\n\nNo easy way to be free\n\nNo easy way to be free\n\nNo easy way to be free\n\nA short song off of their 1968 album Tommy.\n\nThe rock opera Tommy tells the story of a “deaf, dumb, and blind” kid who becomes a Pinball Wizard and then a spiritual leader. The double album was The Who’s break though album. They performed the album in concert halls and opera theaters.\n\nOn their second album A Quick One, they were short of material, Kit Lambert (manager) encouraged Pete to create a mini-opera called A Quick One, While He’s Away by combining a suite of song snippets. By 1968 he was developing a full-album concept called Deaf, Dumb And Blind Boy, inspired by Indian spiritual mentor Meher Baba.\n\nWhen the album was released to the world it was a huge hit… It was their first album to get into the top ten or the top forty for that matter in America. It wasn’t for the lack of trying. They released some great albums that only the UK enjoyed..they also had singles that rivaled the Kinks, Beatles, and Stones but were not heard here until the compilation album Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy was released in 1971.\n\nI like the Tommy album although it’s not my favorite Who album…that would be Who’s Next. I always thought the album sounded thin compared to the live version they played in 1969 and 70.\n\nUnlike other bands such as the Stones…Townshend encouraged the others to write because he carried most of the burden. Entwistle was the most prolific writer next to Townshend. Daltrey and Moon only wrote occasionally.\n\nAll of them contributed vocals to this one.\n\nFrom Songfacts\n\n“Tommy Can You Hear Me?” is the sixth track on the first side of the second album (third side overall) and acts as a transition between two narratively important songs, “Go To The Mirror!” and “Smash the Mirror.”\n\nIn “Go to the Mirror!” a doctor (played by Jack Nicholson in the film version) tells Tommy’s parents that their son’s lifelong handicap is entirely psychosomatic, basically meaning it’s all in his head. That song leads into “Tommy Can You Hear Me?” In this track, the lyrics are meant to be the words of Tommy’s mother, who is extra frustrated by Tommy’s inability to hear her now that she knows it’s all in his head.\n\n“Tommy Can You Hear Me” leads into “Smash the Mirror,” in which Tommy can indeed see his own reflection, but still doesn’t register seeing his mother, which enrages her so much, she shoves Tommy through a mirror. This scene leads to Tommy’s eventual awakening as a spiritual figure..\n\nBob Dylan references this song in “Murder Most Foul” with the lyric, “Tommy, can you hear me? I’m the Acid Queen.” That line also mentions “The Acid Queen,” which is another track on Tommy.\n\nTommy Can You Hear Me\n\nTommy can you hear me?\n\nCan you feel me near you?\n\nTommy can you see me?\n\nCan I help to cheer you?\n\nOoooh Tommy\n\nTommy\n\nTommy\n\nTommy\n\nTommy can you hear me?\n\nCan you feel me near you?\n\nTommy can you see me?\n\nCan I help to cheer you?\n\nOoooh Tommy\n\nTommy\n\nTommy\n\nTommy\n\nTommy can you hear me?\n\nCan you feel me near you?\n\nTommy can you see me?\n\nCan I help to cheer you?\n\nOoooh Tommy\n\nTommy\n\nTommy\n\nTommy\n\nTommy\n\nTommy\n\nTommy\n\nTommy\n\nTommy\n\nTommy\n\nTommy\n\nTommy\n\nA good song off of the Quadrophenia album.\n\nThis was a rare Who song that had no demo made of it. Townshend’s demo’s were sometimes just as good as the studio versions the band recorded. The whistle on the song came about after Townshend’s driver bribed a British train driver with five pounds to sound the train’s whistle as it pulled out, despite breaking the station rules.\n\nThis song was not released as a single in America…at the time of the album release in 1973 they released it in Europe and Germany.\n\nIn 1979 the soundtrack from the movie came out and it was released as a single in America. It charted at #45 in the Billboard 100.\n\nThe Who had a contest in 2011 for someone to make a video for this song.\n\nIt was announced :\n\nTo commemorate the album’s release and pay homage to 1960s mod culture — Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey are launching a “5:15” video contest, inviting filmmakers and animators to submit a music video for “5:15” that “does for the track what the Quadrophenia film did for the album.”\n\nTownshend and Daltrey say the video should “reflect the 1960s mod culture and show inspiration from the musical and visionary journey portrayed in that era. The winning video will be produced as the official video for ‘5.15’.”\n\nI have the winner at the bottom and it is a really cool video. The winning video was directed by Jeff Rodenberg. The George Harrison estate did the same thing for the song What Is Life.\n\nRoger Daltrey: Ron Nevison, who was the producer at the time with Pete, recorded it with echo on the vocal which can never be removed now,” he explained. “It just makes the vocal sound thin. It was the biggest recording mistake we ever made. The echo diminishes the character as far as I’m concerned. It always pissed me off. From day one I just f—ing hated the sound of it. He did that to my voice and I’ve never forgiven Ron for it.”\n\nFrom Songfacts\n\nThis is the first track on the second disc of Quadrophenia, Pete Townshend’s rock opera about Jimmy, a pill-popping mod cockney who tries to find reality from sexual encounters, the company he keeps, and the clothes he wears. Only when he drowns in the ocean does he discover himself.\n\nIn this song, Jimmy The Mod takes the train (the 5:15) back to Brighton, once the site of the Mods’ triumph against the Rockers, and en route he remembers various experiences of himself and his fellow Mods. Jimmy’s recollections are in the main unhappy – anger, confusion, violence, sexual frustration, and rootlessness dominate his thoughts as he keeps returning to the thought: “Inside, outside, leave me alone. Inside, outside, nowhere is home.”\n\nThe term “Quadrophenia” was coined by Pete Townshend, referring to schizophrenia, times two. The character Jimmy The Mod was a quadrophenic: Townshend wanted each of his four personalities to represent one of the four band members. This didn’t work as planned, as he was so much more involved in the project than the other members.\n\nDuring an infamous performance of the song on BBC’s Top Of The Pops, Townshend demolished the Gretsch guitar that he’d used for the bulk of Who’s Next and Quadrophenia. The Who went on to earn a life ban from BBC premises after Townshend flicked two fingers at the show’s producer and Keith Moon attacked a steward who refused him entry to the bar.\n\nTownshend’s rage was genuine: The BBC, enforcing union rules, made the group record a new track for their lip-synched performance. The Who recorded their segment on October 3, 1973, which was broadcast on the 500th Edition special of the show the the next evening with the offensive gestures edited out. The ban was lifted after representatives for The Who sent a letter of apology to the BBC.\n\n5:15\n\nWhy should I care, why should I care?\n\nGirls of fifteen\n\nSexually knowing\n\nThe ushers are sniffing\n\nEau-de-coloning\n\nThe seats are seductive\n\nCelibate sitting\n\nPretty girls digging\n\nPrettier women\n\nMagically bored\n\nOn a quiet street corner\n\nFree frustration\n\nIn our minds and our toes\n\nQuiet storm water\n\nM-m-my generation\n\nUppers and downers\n\nEither way blood flows\n\nInside outside, leave me alone\n\nInside outside, nowhere is home\n\nInside outside, where have I been?\n\nOut of my brain on the five fifteen\n\nOut of my brain on the train\n\nOut of my brain on the train\n\nOn a raft in the quarry\n\nSlowly sinking\n\nBack of a lorry\n\nHoly hitching\n\nDreadfully sorry\n\nApple scrumping\n\nBorn in the war\n\nBirthday punching\n\nHe man drag\n\nIn the glittering ballroom\n\nGravely outrageous\n\nIn my high heel shoes\n\nTightly undone\n\nThey know what they’re showing\n\nSadly ecstatic\n\nThat their heroes are news\n\nInside outside, leave me alone\n\nInside outside, nowhere is home\n\nInside outside, where have I been?\n\nOut of my brain on the five fifteen\n\nOut of my brain on the train\n\nOut of my brain on the train, on the train, out of my brain\n\nWoo\n\nOut of my brain on the train\n\nHere it comes\n\nWoo\n\nOut of my brain on the train, on the train\n\nOut of my brain on the train\n\nWhy should I care?\n\nWhy should I care\n\n…\n\nMy name is Bill, and I’m a head case…\n\nNow THAT is a lyric worth exploring.\n\nPete Townshend wrote this for a Rock Opera he was composing called “Quads,” which was about a future where parents could choose the sex of their children. That opera never happened. I have to wonder if Townshend had this old title in mind when a few years later he came up with the title for “Quadrophenia.”\n\nI’m A Boy was released as a single in 1966. The song peaked at #2 in the UK and #2 in New Zealand. The song was not heard much in America or Canada at the time. Many of their singles would finally come to the light when the great compilation album Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy was released in 1971. They did a live version and included it on the live album Live At Leeds released in 1970.\n\nReleased as the B-side of the single was “In the City”, the first and last song credited to the songwriting collaboration of John Entwistle and Keith Moon. Entwistle referred to it as rip-off of Jan and Dean, a group that was a favorite of Moon’s.\n\nRoger Daltrey: “I always thought The Who went through a weird period after ‘My Generation’ (November 1965) that lasted until we did ‘Magic Bus’ (October 1968). I thought it all went a bit sloppy. But ‘I’m A Boy’ and ‘Pictures Of Lily’ were from that period when I’d been allowed back into the band (Daltrey had been asked to leave after beating up Keith Moon over his heavy use of amphetamines). My ego had been crushed. I was insecure and it showed in my voice. When I first heard those songs, I was like, ‘Oi, what’s this all about?’ I didn’t think I could find the right voice for them. You can hear it when you listen to them now, but my insecurity made those songs sound better. It was a happy accident.”\n\nFrom Songfacts\n\nThis is about a boy whose mother wants him to be a girl, while the boy longs to assert his real sexual identity. The controversial subject of cross-dressing was probably the reason why this failed to reach the American Top 100.\n\nDaltrey told Uncut magazine: “On ‘I’m A Boy’, I tried to sing it like a really, really young kid, like an eight-year-old. Not the voice of an eight-year-old but the sentiment – and I think that came across.”\n\nI’m A Boy\n\nOne girl was called Jean Marie\n\nAnother little girl was called Felicity\n\nAnother little girl was Sally Joy\n\nThe other was me, and I’m a boy\n\nMy name is Bill, and I’m a head case\n\nThey practice making up on my face\n\nYeah, I feel lucky if I get trousers to wear\n\nSpend evenings taking hairpins from my hair\n\nI’m a boy, I’m a boy\n\nBut my ma won’t admit it\n\nI’m a boy, I’m a boy\n\nBut if I say I am, I get it\n\nPut your frock on, Jean Marie\n\nPlait your hair, Felicity\n\nPaint your nails, little Sally Joy\n\nPut this wig on, little boy\n\nI’m a boy, I’m a boy\n\nBut my ma won’t admit it\n\nI’m a boy, I’m a boy\n\nBut if I say I am, I get it\n\nI want to play cricket on the green\n\nRide my bike across the street\n\nCut myself and see my blood\n\nI want to come home all covered in mud\n\nI’m a boy, I’m a boy\n\nBut my ma won’t admit it\n\nI’m a boy, I’m a boy, I’m a boy\n\nI’m a boy, I’m a boy, I’m a boy, I’m a boy\n\nI’m a boy, I’m a boy, I’m a boy\n\nThis song is one of my favorite songs off the 1969 Tommy album along with the song Christmas. I never thought Tommy was their best album by any means but it is the one that broke them to a mass audience.\n\nWhile Townshend was backstage at a Door’s concert, a security guard roughly handled a girl who was attempting to touch Jim Morrison, just as Sally was attempting to touch Tommy. There is a video of the real “Sally Simpson” back stage and Jim Morrison is trying to help her. I have the video at the bottom. I never knew a video existed of this until recently.\n\nThe song was never released as a single but is a great section of the story of Tommy. In Baba O’Riley there is a lyric that mentions Sally or a different Sally. “Sally, take my hand we’ll travel south ‘cross land”…could it be? I doubt it but you never know.\n\nThe Who during this time were touring and including opera houses. They were as tight as a band can be…it was soon after that they released what I think is the greatest live album ever…Live At Leeds.\n\nHere is video of Jim Morrison tending to “Sally” backstage. Yep, real footage of the girl that inspired Pete to write Sally Simpson.\n\nSally Simpson\n\nOutside the house Mr. Simpson announced\n\nthat Sally couldn’t go to the meeting.\n\nHe went on cleaning his blue Rolls Royce\n\nand she ran inside weeping.\n\nShe got to her room and tears splashed the picture\n\nof the new Messiah.\n\nShe picked up a book of her fathers life\n\nand threw it on the fire!\n\nShe knew from the start\n\nDeep down in her heart\n\nThat she and Tommy were worlds apart,\n\nBut her Mother said never mind your part…\n\nIs to be what you’ll be.\n\nThe theme of the sermon was come unto me,\n\nLove will find a way,\n\nSo Sally decided to ignore her dad,\n\nand sneak out anyway!\n\nShe spent all afternoon getting ready,\n\nand decided she’d try to touch him,\n\nMaybe he’d see that she was free\n\nand talk to her this Sunday.\n\nShe knew from the start\n\nDeep down in her heart\n\nThat she and Tommy were worlds apart,\n\nBut her Mother said never mind your part…\n\nIs to be what you’ll be.\n\nShe arrived at six and the place was swinging\n\nto gospel music by nine.\n\nGroup after group appeared on the stage\n\nand Sally just sat there crying.\n\nShe bit her nails looking pretty as a picture\n\nright in the very front row\n\nAnd then a DJ wearing a blazer with a badge\n\nran on and said ‘here we go!’\n\nThe crowd went crazy\n\nAs Tommy hit the stage!\n\nLittle Sally got lost as the police bossed\n\nThe crowd back in a rage!\n\nBut soon the atmosphere was cooler\n\nas Tommy gave a lesson.\n\nSally just had to let him know she loved him\n\nand leapt up on the rostrum!\n\nShe ran cross stage to the spotlit figure\n\nand touched him on the face\n\nTommy whirled around as a uniformed man,\n\nthrew her of the stage.\n\nShe knew from the start\n\nDeep down in her heart\n\nThat she and Tommy were worlds apart,\n\nBut her Mother said never mind your part…\n\nIs to be what you’ll be.\n\nHer cheek hit a chair and blood trickled down,\n\nmingling with her tears,\n\nTommy carried on preaching\n\nand his voice filled Sally’s ear\n\nShe caught his eye she had to try\n\nbut couldn’t see through the lights\n\nHer face was gashed and the ambulance men\n\nhad to carry her out that night.\n\nThe crowd went crazy\n\nAs Tommy left the stage!\n\nLittle Sally was lost for the price of a touch\n\nAnd a gash across her face! OOoooh.\n\nSixteen stitches put her right and her Dad said\n\n‘don’t say I didn’t warn yer’.\n\nSally got married to a rock musician\n\nshe met in California\n\nTommy always talks about the day\n\nthe disciples all went wild!\n\nSally still carries a scar on her cheek\n\nto remind her of his smile.\n\nShe knew from the start\n\nDeep down in her heart\n\nThat she and Tommy were worlds apart,\n\nBut her Mother said never mind your part…\n\nIs to be what you’ll be.\n\nThe early Who singles were first heard in the UK much more than America. They were really exciting and raw and different from anyone else. I first heard this song on the great compilation album Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy. The album was made up of singles and many of them were not heard in America much at all when they were originally released.\n\nIt was released both as the B-side to “The Kids Are Alright” in the U.S., and as the A-side of a single that peaked at #32 in the UK in 1965. Both singles were released by Shel Talmy without the permission of the Who and were a result of a legal dispute between Talmy and the band at the time and an attempt to sabotage the release of the band’s chosen single “Substitute”.\n\nThis was the first song that Pete Townshend took the lead vocal on.\n\nPete Townshend on the song: “is about a guy on the run from a chick about to pin him down for breach of contract. What this song was screaming from behind lines like ‘It’s a legal matter, baby, marrying’s no fun/It’s a legal matter, baby, you got me on the run’ was, “I’m lonely, I’m hungry, the bed needs making.’ I wanted a maid, I suppose.”\n\nA Legal Matter\n\nI told you why I changed my mind\n\nI got bored by playing with time\n\nI know you thought you had me nailed\n\nBut I’ve freed my head from your garden rails\n\nNow it’s a legal matter, baby\n\nYou got me on the run\n\nIt’s a legal matter, baby\n\nA legal matter from now on\n\nMy mind’s lost in a household fog\n\nWedding gowns and catalogs\n\nKitchen furnishings and houses\n\nMaternity clothes and baby’s trousers\n\nNow it’s a legal matter, baby\n\nMarryin’s no fun\n\nIt’s a legal matter, baby\n\nA legal matter from now on\n\nI told you why I changed my mind\n\nI got bored by playing with time\n\nI know you thought you had me nailed\n\nWell, I’ve freed my head from your garden rails\n\nNow it’s a legal matter, baby\n\nYou got me on the run\n\nIt’s a legal matter, baby\n\nA legal matter from now on\n\nYou ain’t the first and you ain’t the last\n\nI gain and lose my women fast\n\nI never want to make them cry\n\nI just get bored, don’t ask me why\n\nJust wanna keep doing all the dirty little things I do\n\nAnd not work all day in an office just to bring my money back to you\n\nSorry, baby\n\n…"
