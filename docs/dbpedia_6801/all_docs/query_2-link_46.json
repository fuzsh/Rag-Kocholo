At his feet are his two adorable black and white dogs.\n\nRelease Notes:\n\nTerry O'Neill offered a wide variety of signed, limited edition, fine art photographs during his lifetime. When he passed away, he left a small archive of these pieces that had been prepared for exhibition and sale. These \"Lifetime\" photographs are now extraordinarily rare, and available only in very limited sizes.\n\nEstate-Stamped limited edition photographs are available in select sizes. PLEASE NOTE: Estate editions are offered only in the case that the original signed editions of 50 in a particular size had not already sold out. The existing editions of 50 will be continued as “Estate Editions” until they are gone."
