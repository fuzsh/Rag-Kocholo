        "text": "Over the years, Joe “Pet” Petruzzelli has toured, produced, engineered, recorded, or\n\nperformed with several accomplished musicians and rock stars. including Joe Perry,\n\nAerosmith, Fred Lipsius 9 time Grammy award winner from, (Blood, Sweat and Tears),\n\nDenny Dias (Steely Dan), Steven Tyler (Aerosmith), Brad Delp and Barry Goudreau\n\n(Boston), Peter Criss (Kiss), Huey Lewis, Gary Cherone and Nuno Bettencourt\n\n(Extreme, Van Halen, Rhianna), Maurice Star, (New Edition, New Kids On the Block),\n\nthrough a mutual Boston artist, legendary Rolling Stones producer, Jimmy Miller, met\n\nJoe Pet and invited him to perform, record and co-produce 9-time Grammy award\n\nwinner, Buddy Guy (Rolling Stones, Steve Winwood), this was an unforgettable\n\nexperience for Pet. He continued to work with Miller until his untimely passing and he\n\ncontinues to produce, teach, and tour today.\n\nBreak\n\nJoe Petruzzelli, respectfully known in the Rock Music World as “Joe Pet”, is a Boston-\n\nbased, international touring Drummer, Singer, Songwriter, Producer, Business Owner,\n\nand Teacher.\n\nHis professional music career began when he was just 20 years old, when he seized the\n\nopportunity to tour with the New Jersy based band, The Happenings. At that time, The\n\nHappenings had two #3 hits on the Billboard top 100 Charts, “See you in September”\n\nand “Go Away little girl”. Pet’s band, “Paradise”, opened for The Happenings, in a club\n\ncalled OD’s, in Cambridge, MA. After the show the lead singer of “The Happenings”, Bob\n\nMiranda, approached him. And asked if I knew any singing drummers because his\n\ndrummer was leaving, Joe said, you’re looking at him. He was so impressed with Pet’s\n\nsinging and drumming he offered him a gig on the spot to join his band! Pet toured all\n\nover the country with The Happenings for two years.\n\nReady for change, he left the group and returned to Boston, establishing a new band\n\ncalled, Sound Trek, Trek was a progressive 4-piece band, that featured synthesizers,\n\nwhich was very cutting edge at the time. Sound Trek performed the music of bands such\n\nas King Crimson, and became one of the most sought-after bands in Boston.\n\nAfter 3-years and eager to perform his own original music, he disbanded Sound Trek\n\nand went on to form “Cloud”, an all-original trio. This project introduced him to New\n\nEngland’s top original bands and musicians. Pet was particularly impressed with the\n\ngroup, Luna. He heard they were looking for singer/drummer, so he went to see their\n\nshow, in CT, and by the end of the night he was the new singer/drummer for Luna.\n\nBy the mid-to-late 70’s the Boston music scene was hot! Bands like Boston, J. Geils and\n\nThe Cars were all over the music charts and Boston was bursting with talented rock\n\nbands who were anxious to get a recording deal.\n\nLuna signed a production deal in 1981 but after a series of bad decisions by an\n\nunscrupulous producer, Luna was restricted from performing and recording, so the\n\nband made the decision to disband for the length of the contract. Unable to record\n\nunder the name, Luna, the core group of musicians regrouped to form the band, Berlin\n\nAirlift. They signed a record deal with Handshake Records, a CBS subsidiary, and began\n\nrecording their first album at NY’s famed Hit Factory, along with Fleetwood Mac who\n\nwas recording across the hall. MTV had changed the music business and Berlin Airlift\n\nwent from being a big fish in a small pond to being almost invisible in a sea of new\n\nbands. The album was never promoted and sat on a shelf.\n\nIt was around this time that Pet received a call from Steve Barrasso, of Collins and\n\nBarrasso, Joe Perry of Aerosmith’s personal manager. He made an offer to Pet he\n\ncouldn’t refuse – join, tour and record with The Joe Perry Project!\n\nPet recorded JPP’s 3 rd solo album, “Once a Rocker Always a Rocker” and performed in\n\nthe music video, Black Velvet Pants, which was in medium rotation on MTV. He toured\n\nwith the band for 2-years and was preparing for their Asian and European tour when\n\nwhile playing at the Bottom Line in New York City, Steven Tyler came to the show and\n\nthe rest is music history. Joe and Steve put Aerosmith back together and the Joe Perry\n\nProject was put on indefinite hiatus.\n\nPet returned home and finally found the time to do something he’d always wanted to\n\ndo…build his own recording studio.\n\nBack in the 1960’s, four brothers who wanted to be The Beatles formed a band called The Cowsills. The original Cowsills consisted of Bill on guitar, Bob on guitar and organ, Barry on bass and John on drums. Early gigs were at school dances and churches around their home in Newport, RI. Eventually, as their harmonic sound was perfected, they got a regular gig on Bannisters Wharf in Newport where they would sing Beatle songs hour after hour. Early recordings were released by the four brothers on Joda and Mercury Records. Barbara (“mini-mom”) joined the group to record The Rain, The Park and Other Things and shortly thereafter 7 year old Susan and brother, Paul, were added to the group. They were signed by MGM records and the group began it’s climb to the top!Here’s what Bob had to say about the early days and getting started.\n\nAlthough Bill and I performed at a very young age, and Bill, myself, Barry and John did a lot of frat parties at Brown University and clubs in Newport … the most memorable performance of what I would view as the precursor of what The Cowsills would be was at King’s Park in Newport (right at the foot of Halidon Hall) at some carnival. The family angle just evolved … first Bill and me, then Bill me and Barry, then Bill, me, Barry and John, then Bill, me, Barry, John and Mom, then Bill, me, Barry, John, Mom and Paul, then later, me, Paul, John, Barry, Mom and Susan, then back to Bill, me, Barry and John (very briefly in the end) and then to me, Paul, John and Susan. Our first real break came when we were playing the MK Hotel in Newport (in the basement there) and a guy from the Today show saw us and asked if we wanted to be on the Today show. We weren’t famous or anything but we were young and we were related and we were quite good. So we went on the Today show (I doubt a tape exists of that but if it did it would be priceless to see) and someone from Mercury Records saw us which ultimately led to our signing with that label and putting out “Most Of All” (a great “school’s out” song that should have been our first hit in my opinion) which led to Artie Kornfeld and Steve Duboff. Mercury dropped us, but Artie and Steve had written “The Rain, The Park and Other Things” and we went in and recorded that song at A&R studios in New York and took the whole package to MGM who decided wouldn’t it just be terrific if their mother performed with them and, voila, the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nThe Cowsills enjoyed great success during the late 60’s and in to the very early 70’s not only with their music but appearing as guests on many television shows and even hosting their own TV special. They were approached to do a TV series but the producers had already signed an actress to play the mother on the series so it was a no go for The Cowsills. What was the series? It was The Partridge Family. The Cowsills were also spokespersons for the American Dairy Association and appeared in commercials and print ads for milk. The Cowsills disbanded in the early 1970s but most of them have never really left the music business and various members have regrouped through the years.Bridey Murphy, aka Paul, Bill, Barry and Waddy Wachtel, was formed in the mid-70’s. Bill and Barry drifted in and out of this group and one single, The Time Has Come / Be Your Mother’s Son, was recorded with Paul doing all vocals and Waddy playing all instruments.Then, in the late 1970’s, some of the Cowsills regrouped and recorded an album affectionately known as Cocaine Drain. This album was produced by Chuck Plotkin and also featured Dennis Castanares as a “member” of The Cowsills at that time. During those days, The Cowsills sometimes played the LA area as The Secrets and The Critics. Rumor has it that The Critics also recorded (and never released) a few songs.Flash forward to the 1990s when some of The Cowsills (Bob, Paul, John and Susan) again regrouped. This time they were going to hit the oldies circuit but somehow playing just oldies didn’t appeal to them. They had too much fun on some new material written by Bob and his wife, Mary Jo. So, this incarnation of The Cowsills started playing small clubs and showcases in the Los Angeles area and across the country. They generated great reviews from the critics and fans alike. The Cowsills also went back into the studio and Global was a result of those sessions.Some long-time Cowsill fans (Marsha & Martha Jordan, Jo Malone, Lynn Mathis and Becky Presley) have formed the Committee for the Nomination of The Cowsills for Induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and are striving to have The Cowsills inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. They have created a colorful presentation brochure on The Cowsills that details the ways in which The Cowsills have met the criteria for induction into the Rock Hall which will be sent to each member of the nominating sommittee of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The criteria addressed includes: longevity, influence, innovation, distinction, and perpetuation. Also included are comments from Artie Kornfeld, Mark Bryan of Hootie and the Blowfish, Shirley Jones, Billboard Magazine, Rolling Stone Magazine, etc.During their research, the committee compiled some amazing facts about The Cowsills and their careers, including:\n\nThe Cowsills hold more gold records than many of the current Hall of Famers inducted as performers.\n\nBilly played guitar on the song “Right On” recorded by Ike Turner.\n\nSusan is the youngest rock performer to have a Top Ten hit.\n\nJohn was part of the first American rock group to play in the Republic of China.\n\nThe Cowsills had the First Live Album to feature a Studio Track when In Concert featured “Hair”.\n\nHall of Famer Bob Marley used to cover Cowsill songs.\n\nThe Guestbooks on robinrecords.com and cowsill.com have posts from all 50 states, 19 foreign countries in six of the seven continents.\n\nThe Cowsills were the first of only 5 album covers done for rock bands by famous cartoonist Jack Davis.\n\nBilly once recorded with a guitar borrowed from John Lennon.\n\nThe band’s true worth is illustrated by the fact that they were initially ‘discovered’ by Johnny Nash’s all black R&B label, JODA and they were ask to headline with future Hall of Famers’ Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, and The Beach Boys before they had their first hit record at Soundblast ’66 in Yankee Stadium.\n\nBoth Barry and Susan had their lives turned upside down by Hurricane Katrina, which hit the gulf coast in August 2005, since both were residents of the New Orleans area at the time. Susan and her family lost their home and most of their belongings but they were all safe during the hurricane and it’s aftermath and returned to live in New Orleans in January 2006. Barry, unfortunately, did not get out of New Orleans before Katrina hit and was among the missing of Hurricane Katrina for 4 months. Then, sadly, on January 4th, 2006, The Cowsill family got the news that Barry’s body had been found and identified. Barry Cowsill is no longer with us. At the memorial service for Barry, the Cowsill family was informed that Billy had passed away following his battles with hip replacement surgery, back surgery, emphysema, osteoporosis and other problems. Today, the surviving Cowsills continue to make music – sometimes individually and sometimes together – and their harmonies are still as infectious and bright as ever.

The quartet remains a beloved institution in and around their hometown of New London, Connecticut, while maintaining a fiercely loyal fan base around the world.\n\nThe four longstanding compatriots forged an enduring friendship and a productive musical partnership rooted in their shared belief in the catchy, unpretentious, effortlessly uplifting rock 'n' roll that remained the band's focus for its entire existence.\n\nThe Reducers remained a vital musical force until June 2012, when bassist Steve Kaika passed away after battling cancer. His bandmates chose not to continue without him, and instead set about putting the finishing touches upon their final studio sessions, which had been recorded prior to Steve's illness. Those recordings now form the foundation of Last Tracks & Lost Songs, which combines those sessions with a scintillating selection of rare and unreleased Reducers tracks dating back to the 1980s.\n\nThe Reducers spent more than three decades resisting the fickle turns of popular taste, the transient whims of musical fashion, and the temptations of the music-industry buzz that briefly threatened to turn them into the Next Big Thing. Instead, the band spontaneously moved forward on its own uncompromising terms, continuing to make brilliant, personally charged rock 'n' roll, while remaining well below the radar of the mainstream music biz but prominent in the hearts of those who loved them.\n\nThe Reducers' history is a powerful testament to rock 'n' roll's power to transcend and inspire, for those who create it as well as for those who consume it. These four working-class underdogs—Detmold and fellow singer-guitarist-songwriter Hugh Birdsall, drummer Tom Trombley and bassist/vocalist Kaika—spent most of their adult lives building a potent body of recordings and a far-reaching reputation as a scrappy, riveting live act that affirmed rock 'n' roll's vibrant promise on a regular basis.\n\n\"There's a lot you can do with two guitars, bass and drums,\" asserts Birdsall.\n\nThe nine albums that The Reducers released between 1978 and 2012 charted the band's evolution from punk-inspired smartasses to thoughtful craftsmen, without sacrificing the musical and personal edge that originally established them as a special band. Those recordings showcase the foursome's organic musical rapport and the ace songwriting of Birdsall and Detmold, whose unfailingly infectious tunes incorporate a witty, heartfelt lyrical sensibility that's laced with barbed humor and humanistic insight.\n\nThroughout their existence, The Reducers embodied the same fannish enthusiasm that first asserted itself in the late 1970s, when teenaged pals Birdsall and Detmold bonded over their mutual affinity for the punk and new wave sounds that were emerging at the time. They indulged their love for the new music with a ten-day visit to London during the musically volatile summer of 1977, during which the pair witnessed historic performances by the Sex Pistols, the Clash and the Jam.\n\nThe new music's raw energy and do-it-yourself spirit provided a focus for the duo's own budding musical energies, and their passion for the music was further fueled by their frequent treks into Manhattan to pick up the latest British import releases, and to check out the city's booming punk scene.\n\n\"Those experiences were huge for us,\" Birdsall notes. \"They made us realize that we didn't have to be virtuoso musicians to play out in clubs. All of those early punk songs were easy to learn, so we could actually learn lots of complete songs. And we started to learn about arranging songs so that we could play them, without having to achieve note-for-note perfection. It also made us realize that we'd have to write our own songs if we wanted to be a real band.\"\n\n\"The biggest lesson that punk rock taught us was 'You can do it,'\" Detmold adds. \"I'd been going to see bands for years and years, but when I'd see the Who or Thin Lizzy or Queen or the Allman Brothers, it felt like there was no way that I could ever manage something like that. But then when I began seeing shows by the likes of the Ramones and the Clash and the Jam and the Sex Pistols, it felt like it was within my grasp, and that it was something that we could do.\"\n\nAnother touchstone for the soon-to-be-Reducers was the '70s school of earthy, rootsy British pub-rock bands, e.g. Ducks Deluxe, Rockpile and Dr. Feelgood.\n\nAs Detmold recalls, \"I got into the whole pub-rock thing after I found the first Ducks Deluxe album in a cutout bin at my local record store. I bought it because I was intrigued by the cover photo; those four guys looked like a band, but nothing like the bands I was used to. The whole idea of bands that played in bars for a drinking crowd appealed to us, because it further stripped away the pretense that there was something unattainable about being in a rock 'n' roll band.\"\n\nInspired to get serious about launching their own band, Birdsall and Detmold soon roped in Kaika and Trombley to complete the lineup. At the time, the bassist and drummer were gainfully employed as the rhythm section of the popular local country-rock outfit the Bob Bridgeman Band, but were nonetheless persuaded to join forces with Hugh and Peter. Armed with a growing list of original compositions and an eclectic array of cover tunes, The Reducers began playing out in New London and various New England college towns, quickly developing an enthusiastic following.\n\nIn the summer of 1980, The Reducers entered a small local studio to cut their first single, \"Out of Step\"/\"No Ambition,\" which they released on their own homespun Rave On label. The landmark disc (original copies of which now fetch princely sums on ebay) was a perfect encapsulation of the band's hard-working underdog appeal. Despite a lack of promotional resources, the single gained numerous positive reviews and helped to spread The Reducers' reputation outside of their home region, even as their local popularity was helping to fuel a scene of new bands to coalesce around them at home.\n\nThe Reducers' public profile was raised further when the band's self-titled debut LP, recorded on the cheap and live in the studio, was released in 1984, with all four members sharing vocal duties and songwriting credits. Despite its lo-fi sonics, the album's urgent performances and winsome songcraft struck a chord with critics and college-radio DJs.\n\nThe Reducers' second longplayer Let's Go! was released in early 1985 and was even better received, breaking into the Top 10 on various alternative charts. Let's Go!'s anthemic title song broke out as a college-radio hit, ending up on Epic Records' compilation album Epic Presents the Unsigned. It was also named Single of the Year by the influential college radio trade publication CMJ, which also anointed The Reducers as 1985's Best Unsigned Band.\n\nThose honors, combined with some grueling national touring and a widely-read rave by Robert Christgau in New York's Village Voice, helped to set off a national buzz that attracted the interest of several major labels.\n\nAt the time, The Reducers were in the vanguard of a historic wave of iconoclastic, independently minded young bands sprouting up across the United States.\n\n\"When we first started putting out albums in the early '80s, we'd find them in record store bins right in front of R.E.M. and the Replacements, and it was obvious that we were part of a movement away from the bloated arena-rock thing,\" explains Detmold. \"I saw both of those bands, and lots of others, in small clubs in front of small crowds, and I realized that we were all working different variations of a similar idea.\"\n\n\"We felt like we were part of something,\" adds Birdsall. \"But we also felt like we were on the periphery of it, on the outside looking in. To me, it's miraculous that we ever even got closeto the music business. That was more the work of others, who heard something in us that they thought might be marketable, than it was any ambitions on our part.\"\n\nBut while many of their contemporaries went on to major-label deals and mainstream recognition, the big deal that many predicted for The Reducers failed to materialize. Rather than turn bitter, the band simply continued doing what they loved. A third album, 1985's Cruise to Nowhere, was quickly written and recorded amidst touring commitments.\n\nBut the strain of constant roadwork began to wear on the band, and they soon retreated from national touring. Instead, they continued gigging locally and writing vital new material, sustained by their hometown fans and by their abiding belief in the music.\n\nThe Reducers made their belated CD debut in 1991 with the 29-song retrospective Redux, which gathered most of the band's prior vinyl output into one handy package. In addition to belatedly dragging the band into the digital age, the collection launched a wave of renewed public and press interest. 1995's Shinola, the band's first album of new material in a decade, covered some impressive new creative ground, while maintaining the qualities that had originally endeared The Reducers to their admirers.\n\nIn 2000, the band responded to years of fan requests for a live album by assembling the rough-and-ready Fistfight At Ocean Beach. That disc was a limited-edition CD-R release available only as a premium for donations to WCNI, the non-profit local radio station where Birdsall and Detmold have served as DJs almost continuously since 1979, carefully avoiding self-promotion and sharing their favorite old and new rock 'n' roll tunes with their loyal listeners.\n\nA more formal live CD, 2003's Old Cons, found The Reducers celebrating their 25th anniversary with a career-spanning onstage retrospective that documented the band's intensity and versatility—as well as their longstanding love for early rock 'n' roll, vintage soul, British Invasion pop and '70s punk and new wave.\n\nThe Reducers' 25th anniversary also coincided with the mayor of New London's official proclamation of August 23, 2003 as Reducers Day, and the premiere of the career-spanning documentary The Reducers: America's Best Unsigned Band, which won critical acclaim for its compelling retelling of the group's unlikely journey.\n\nThe following year, a request from a group of Japanese Reducers fans—who had already bought out the backlog of vinyl LP stock that had been gathering dust in Peter's basement—led to the band's first-ever overseas tour, a ten-day run of rapturously received shows in Japan.\n\nSuch acknowledgements demonstrated how these humble outsiders had ended up as unlikely rock 'n' roll heroes. The title and musical contents of their 2008 studio effort Guitars, Bass and Drumsunderlined how The Reducers' unpretentious musical agenda remained as compelling as ever.\n\n\"It was never about money or fame,\" states Birdsall. \"It was always about the music, and the camaraderie, and getting people to dance. I've heard from people in Germany, France, Spain and Japan,\" says Birdsall. \"We seem to be their favorite secret band, whose record they put on at parties and their friends go 'Hey, who's that?' I kind of like having that status. In a way, it's even better than being really popular.\"\n\n\"None of us ever had any delusions about getting rich off of this band,\" Detmold concludes. \"When we started, we were full of piss and vinegar and just wanted to show what we could do. We were four friends with a common vision, and our goals were to play around our area, maybe play New York City and Boston and maybe make a few 45s, and make a name for ourselves. That turned into something much bigger, and we had more success than we could have ever imagined, and it continued for much longer than any of us would have guessed.\"\n\nMichael Anthony Orlando Cassavitis was born on April 3, 1944, the son of a Greek father and a Puerto Rican mother. He spent his earliest years in Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, New York City.[2] In his teenage years, the family moved to Union City, New Jersey, and later Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey.[3]\n\nCareer\n\nOrlando's musical career started with The Five Gents, a doo-wop group he formed in 1959 at age 15, with whom he recorded demo tapes. He got the attention of music publisher and producer Don Kirshner, who hired him to write songs in an office across from New York's Brill Building, along with Carole King, Neil Sedaka, Toni Wine, Barry Mann, Bobby Darin, Connie Francis, and Tom and Jerry, who didn't make it in the office until they changed their name to Simon and Garfunkel.[4]\n\nKirshner also hired Orlando to record songwriter demos as a solo artist, and his first success came at the age of 16 when he charted in the US and UK with the hits \"Bless You\" and \"Halfway To Paradise\".[4] He also appeared at the Brooklyn Paramount Theater with DJ Murray the K.[5] Orlando also had four records that \"Bubbled Under\" the Hot 100: \"Chills\" in 1962, \"Shirley\" and \"I'll Be There\" in 1963, and \"I Was A Boy (When You Needed A Man)\" as by Billy Shields in April 1969.[6] Gerry Goffin and Jack Keller wrote a doo-wop version of Stephen Foster's song \"Beautiful Dreamer\" for Orlando. Released as a single in 1962,[7] the song was picked up by the Beatles who included it in their set lists on the Beatles Winter 1963 Helen Shapiro Tour;[8] a recorded version was released on their 2013 album On Air – Live at the BBC Volume 2. New Colony Six recorded an Orlando composition, \"I'm Just Waitin' (Anticipatin' For Her To Show Up)\", which charted locally in Chicago and \"Bubbled Under\" the Hot 100 in July 1967.[citation needed]\n\nApril-Blackwood period\n\nOrlando continued as a solo artist and also became a producer himself, as well as a successful music executive in the late 1960s. In 1967, Clive Davis hired Orlando as general manager of Columbia Records publishing subsidiary April-Blackwood Music.[citation needed] Earlier general managers for the publishing entity include David Kapralik who stepped into the position in 1964,[9] and stayed until early 1965.[10] During Kapralik's period, Van McCoy was employed as a staff writer.[9]\n\nBy the late 1960s, Orlando had worked his way up to vice president of a larger publishing company, CBS Music, where he signed, co-wrote with, and produced Barry Manilow (under the name \"Featherbed\"). He also worked with other artists, such as The Yardbirds; James Taylor; Grateful Dead; Blood, Sweat & Tears; and Laura Nyro.[4][11][12][13] In the summer of 1969, he recorded with the studio group Wind and had a #28 hit that year with \"Make Believe\" on producer Bo Gentry's Life Records. Orlando was experiencing success, primarily as a music executive, and Davis pretended not to notice when Orlando accepted a $3,000 advance and sang lead vocals on a song called \"Candida\" as a favor for two producer friends. If the record failed, Orlando didn't want it to affect his reputation, so the producers, Hank Medress and Dave Appel used the pseudonym: Dawn. The name was based on the daughter of label Vice President Steve Wax, in hopes of getting more promotion for the single.[14][15]\n\nFurther activities\n\nWhen the song \"Candida\" became an international number-one song, he began to use his name in the group becoming \"Dawn featuring Tony Orlando\" and then \"Tony Orlando and Dawn\". The group had 19 other top 40 tracks, including \"Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree\", the top-selling hit of 1973 and one of the biggest selling singles of all time. The group also had a hit variety program, The Tony Orlando and Dawn Show on CBS from 1974 to 1976.[16] They then broke-up in 1977, after which he has performed as Tony Orlando.\n\nOrlando's first TV appearance was in 1976 on the series Chico and the Man as \"Tomas Garcia\".\n\nOrlando starred in the 1981 TV movie 300 Miles For Stephanie, playing a police officer who promises to walk over 300 miles to a sanctuary in order to obtain God's help to cure Stephanie, his gravely ill daughter. Others in the cast included Edward James Olmos, Pepe Serna and Julie Carmen.[citation needed]\n\nIn May 1981, Orlando appeared on Broadway in the title role of Barnum, replacing Jim Dale, who was on a three-week vacation.\n\nDuring the 1984–85 season of The Cosby Show (its first season), Orlando played Tony Castillo, who runs a community center. He also had a cameo, appearing as himself in the 2002 film Waking Up In Reno, in which he sang a version of \"Knock Three Times\".[citation needed]\n\nIn 2003, Orlando had a recurring role in the children's animated series Oswald, in which he did the voice of \"Sammy Starfish\".\n\nOrlando appeared in an episode of MADtv doing a sketch involving a court case, where the defense sings to persuade the jury about their side. He sang for the prosecution, thereby persuading the judge to give the defense jail for life. In another television program, Orlando was featured in \"Larry the Cable Guy's Star Studded Christmas Extravaganza\".[25] He appeared in That's My Boy as Steve Spirou, a Happy Madison production starring Adam Sandler in 2012.\n\nSupport for veterans\n\nOrlando is a longtime advocate for U.S. military veterans and \"Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree\" has become an anthem for service members.[26][27][28]\n\nOrlando serves on the board of directors for the Eisenhower Foundation, as well as honorary chairman of Snowball Express, an organization that serves the children of fallen military heroes.[2]\n\nHe hosts the annual Congressional Medal of Honor dinner in Dallas. He has served as the master of ceremonies at the Secretary of Defense Freedom Awards at the Pentagon in Washington, D.C.[19][29]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\n\nOrlando was introduced by Jerry Lee Lewis to his future wife, Elaine, who had previously dated Buddy Holly. Tony and Elaine married in 1965, and had one child, Jon; they divorced in 1984. Five years later, Orlando was engaged to Francine Amormino, whom he married on April 29, 1990.[2][21] The couple remained married as of 2021; they have one child.[5][30]\n\nOn February 27, 2013, his mother, Ruth Schroeder of Hollister, Missouri, died in Branson, Missouri[31] of a diabetic stroke.[32]\n\nIn 2002, he wrote a memoir, Halfway to Paradise with Patsi Bale Cox.[33][34]\n\nOrlando was interviewed on The 700 Club explaining that he was raised Catholic and was \"brought up with the Lord as my Savior\"; but after a self-destructive period following his professional success with Dawn, he became a born-again Christian in 1978.[35]\n\nIn 1990, Orlando received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6385 Hollywood Blvd.[36]\n\nDiscography\n\nFor Tony Orlando and Dawn recordings, see Tony Orlando and Dawn § Discography.\n\nAlbums\n\nBless You and 11 Other Great Hits (1961)\n\nMake Believe (1969) (with 'Wind')\n\nBefore Dawn (1973)\n\nTony Orlando (1978)\n\nI Got Rhythm (1979)\n\nLivin' for the Music (1980)\n\nHalfway to Paradise: The Complete Epic Masters 1961–1964 (2006)\n\nBless You (2014)\n\nSolo singles\n\n\"Halfway to Paradise\" (1961) US #39, CB #17\n\n\"Bless You\" (1961) US #15, CB #17 UK #5[37]\n\n\"Happy Times (Are Here To Stay)\" (1961) US #82, CB #76\n\n\"Chills\" (1962) US #109, CB #111\n\n\"At the Edge of Tears\" (1962) CB #146\n\n\"Shirley\" (1963) US #133, CB #109\n\n\"I'll Be There\" (1963) US #124, CB #123\n\n\"What Am I Gonna Do\" (1963) CB #tag\n\n\"Tell Me What Can I Do\" (1964) CB #147\n\n\"To Wait For Love\" (1964) CB #119\n\n\"I Was A Boy\" (1969) US #109, CB #89 (as Billy Shields)\n\n\"Make Believe\" (1969) US #28, CB #18 (with 'Wind')\n\n\"I'll Hold Out My Hand\" (1969) CB #114 (with 'Wind')\n\n\"Don't Let Go\" (1978) Dance #27,[38] AC #48\n\n\"Sweets for My Sweet\" (1979) US #54, CB #55, AC #20\n\nOfficial Website Tony Orlando\n\nJim Sullivan bio. As a high school baseball player growing up in Maine, I used to pump myself up for games by playing Iggy & the Stooges Raw Power at full volume on my crappy bedroom stereo. The ultimate adrenaline rush. Or sometimes, Alice Cooper’s Killer, digging those hard-rocking, theatrical dark deeds. My friends and team mates didn't quite get it – they liked Chicago (the band) and whatever Top 40 stuff crossed their path. But that was OK: I was secure in my choices and my taste. And the punk rock revolution was around the corner. That's where my musical taste locked in with many others, all of us bored with corporate rock. That period was a time of extreme excitement (friction, joy, conflict) that helped inspire me to write about what I loved. And, it opened the doors to even more worlds, writing and otherwise. I wrote for my college paper the Maine Campus and became a rock columnist and feature writer for Maine’s largest daily paper, the Bangor Daily News. My first rock interview was Slade in 1975, where, post-show, I asked Noddy Holder if he still got excited on stage. He exclaimed that he did – “My jeans are stiff as a board!” I was also writing for a music magazine, Sweet Potato, that started in Portland. After graduating from the University of Maine, I moved to Boston in 1978. I continued writing for Sweet Potato – a new Boston edition opened - and began writing freelance music reviews and features for the Boston Globe the following year while attending Boston University, earning an M.S. in Journalism. I also wrote for various national now-defunct music (The Record, Creem, Music-Sound Output, etc.) as well as doing a dozen or so pieces for the nascent USA Today – broadened my taste and sharpened my critical faculties. I found Boston most fascinating, the local rock scene and the many national and international bands that through. Maybe it wasn't New York or L.A., but most anything that hit those cities hit ours, too, and the diversity was most impressive. Name a genre on an any given night bands from that genre would be playing town. Difficult choices had to be made. Quality of the local scene: Never less than B+ and often in the A range. I joined the Globe staff in 1988, writing for virtually every section of the paper at some point, but anchored in the Arts Section and specializing in pop music and culture. The landscape of coverage was immense – from Roy Orbison and Jerry Lee Lewis to Sex Pistols and Ramones, from Neil Young and Elvis Costello to Pink Floyd and Butthole Surfers, from Roxy Music and Sparks to Patti Smith and Tina Turner. I left in the summer of 2005. Since, I've freelanced for, among others, the Boston Phoenix, the Boston Herald, the Christian Science Monitor, Best Classic Bands, WBUR’s ARTery, Rock and Roll Globe, The Hard Noise, the Cape Cod Times, and Playgirl (Yes, a ribald ride with Amanda Palmer and a profile of Lez Zeppelin). In 2022, it was time to combine things, to remake and remodel some of what I’d done over the years, add perspective and context, do some additional interviews to come up with Backstage & Beyond: 45 Years of Classic Rock Chats and Rants (Vol. 1), published July 21, 2023 and Backstage & Beyond: 45 Years of Modern Rock Chats and Rants (Vol. 2), to be published Oct. 19, 2023. The first volume of the anthology focuses on artists who came to prominence in the 1950s through the early 70s, but whose careers extended well beyond. Twenty-one of them are in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Richard Thompon was kind enough to say, “These are wonderful stories across the whole range of popular music, by one of rock’s finest journalists. As history lengthens, and some of these legends move on. these become increasingly precious fragments of lives lived at the sharp edge of music.” The second volume deals with artists who took shape during the mid 70s, mostly the punk, post-punk, new wave eras. From Joy Division/New Order bassist-songwriter Peter Hook: “I have spoken to many journalists in my time, some good, some bad, some terrible. And it is lovely when you meet someone who is just like you - a huge music fan! Jim Sullivan is a music fan. I knew it very quickly after our first meeting in the early 80's. He is friendly, knowledgeable, forthright, and opinionated! An expert in his chosen field. Meeting him now is like meeting an old friend and one of the highlights of any American tour. He is no pushover. If you have faults or are resting on your laurels, he is the first to tell you off. I value his opinions highly and treasure his friendship even more.” Although much of the book revolves around things that took place in Boston, I didn’t want it to be an overly Boston-centric book. Hopefully, it’s for rock fans anywhere and everywhere. The five local-but-national acts I chose for the first two volumes: Aerosmith, the J. Geils Band, the Cars, Pixies and Mission of Burma. Jim lives in Brookline with his wife Roza and a trio of felines. If the season’s right and the weather’s nice, you may find him at Fenway Park at night -if not a rock club – and if it’s daytime, you may find him out on a golf course, forever trying to score in the 80s, succeeding enough to make him keep coming back. A summer 2023 highlight: Playing two 9-hole rounds in Newton with Alice Cooper, a smooth-swinging five-handicapper, who had some free time in Boston, prior to the Hollywood Vampires show at the Boch-Wang Theatre and tries to play every other day on tour. And, yeah, the 16-year-old me – if I knew this was in the future - woulda said, “That’s pretty cool!” And, frankly, so did the 66-year-old me: Alice telling rock stories, golf stories (and tips), showbiz stories, making a brief stop to pet the course border collie, Blush, and take a pic. All of us playing pretty damn good golf, too. One of those stories: Back in the day, Eddie Van Halen wanted to golf with Alice so they did and after the round he asked Alice how he did: “You are a great guitar player,” Alice said, politely. Yes, Eddie sucked, but the real reason he wanted to play with Alice was so that he’d introduce him to his friend Glen Campbell who was a fabulous guitarist and great golfer, as good as any pro from 60 yards in. Alice shot just a bit over par and they were two of my best rounds, too. It included a blind chip to the green over a hill on the sixth hole which landed two inches from the cup. Now, we do have “gimmes” in my little golf world, but not on a birdie putt. I walked up to the green without my putter before I remembered that, but Alice graciously handed me his putter for the polite tap-in.\n\nComposer Randy Edelman lives life boldly, conquering his own visions, creating his own destinies, muting public opinion to craft his own fate, and offering a musical legacy that will reign for eternity. He evaluates feelings, intuition and instincts and finds a melody for all of them.\n\nRaised in Teaneck, New Jersey, the keyboard couture was born with the ability to hear music and transcribe it onto the piano. After a brief quarrel with fate where Randy was temporally thrust into the pursuit of pre-med, he moved into full-time piano and composition study at the Cincinnati Music Conservatory where he was then able to follow his unquestionable destiny. He eventually procured an arranging assignment at James Brown’s King Records. In 1971 Randy relocated to New York to work as a staff writer at April Blackwood Music, while simultaneously playing piano in Broadway pit orchestras. Yet even then there was no possible way for anyone, even Randy, to realize that his constellation would lead to a unicorn marathon of celebrated careers that would touch the lives of so many.\n\nLike a seductive alchemist Randy began to write and record his own albums transforming the world’s anguish into a narrative of truth and granting him a thriving audience in the UK, with television spots on such British institutions as “Top of the Pops” as well as many others showcasing his solo hits like, “Uptown, Uptempo Woman” and “Concrete and Clay.” He also performed solo concerts at prestigious venues, including the London Palladium, Drury Lane Theatre, and Royal Festival Hall.\n\nThe original material from Randy’s songs via his solo albums began being covered and recorded by a myriad of artist including: Barry Manilow (A Weekend in New England), The Carpenters (I Can’t Make Music), Nelly (My Place), Patti LaBelle (Isn’t it a Shame), Willy Nelson (Down in the Everglades), Olivia Newton-John (If Love is Real), ABBA’s Agnetha Faltskog (Turn the World Around), Blood, Sweat, Tears (Blue Street) The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (Grey), Dionne Warwick (The Laughter and the Tears) and a long list of others. He has performed in breathtaking arenas with Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention, The Association and The Carpenters, and with Olivia Newton-John at The Budokan in Japan.\n\nHowever back home in Hollywood Randy became interested in pursuing a new endeavor which was creating the life, blood, and essence of the movies, through music, and making even the plainest faces alive with promise. His individuality and originality only touches upon the core of his iconic acclamation and his dexterity and endowment for the creations of over 100 soundtracks both for motion picture and television. Embodied within his eclectic film catalogs are the mischievous comedies of “My Cousin Vinny”, “The Mask”, “Billy Madison” “Ghostbusters ll”, “Twins”, “Kindergarten Cop”, “Shanghai Noon”, his romantic satires such as “While You Were Sleeping”, “27 Dresses”, “Six Days Seven Nights” and his whimsical fantasies, “Dragonheart”, “Beethoven”, “Drop Dead Fred”, “The Chipmunk’s Adventure” and “The Indian in the Cupboard” Then there are those dark, haunting, and ominous thrillers, “XXX”, “Anaconda”, “Diabolique”, “Daylight”, and his most recent, the intense and evocative music of “The Possession of Anne.”\n\nHowever like a chameleon he is of a very specialized and distinctive breed of musicians and has the ability of shifting to different hues and degrees of emotions and brilliance as shown via his more serious and passionate films including “Gettysburg” (directed by Ronald F. Maxwell), “The Bruce Lee Story” (directed by Rob Cohen), “Come See Paradise” (directed by Alan Parker) and “Last of the Mohicans” (directed by Michael Mann). Amongst the other legendary directors he has lent his talent to are the late Ivan Reitman, the iconic Ron Howard, and celebrated producer and visionary Ted Turner.\n\nSome of the television shows and series he has scored encompass : MacGyver, Mr. Sunshine, Backdraft 2 for Netflix, and Citizen X for HBO. These credits only touch the surface of his accomplishments. He has also created the music for “Dare Mighty Things” for NASA’s final Shuttle launch, “Wimbledon, Grand Slam Tennis Series” for ESPN, “ESPN Sports Century,” and even the NBC “on air” Olympic Theme, of which he has celebrated over 20 years of Olympic themed glory keeping the musical flame alive.\n\nThe multi-award winning serialist has received some of the most prestigious awards including BMI’s highest honor, the Richard Kirk Award for Outstanding Career Achievement, the Composer and Lyricist’s Guild Lifetime Achievement Award , an Emmy for the close of the NBC Olympic Broadcast, and an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from the University of Cincinnati, which was received alongside the only other PhD recipient Coretta Scott King. In addition he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and British Academy Award (BAFTA), for “Last of the Mohicans.” Furthermore, “Dragonheart” was nominated for the Saturn (Science Fiction) Award, and “Leap Year” was awarded the Gold Spirit Award (in honor of Jerry Goldsmith) for Best Comedy.\n\nBesides recording and conducting all of his own scores in Los Angeles, New York, Salt Lake City, and London, he has lived their performances in film festivals in Ubeda Spain, in Lucerne, Switzerland (with the 21rst Century Orchestra), and at Fimucité The Tenerife International Film Music Festival in the Canary Islands. One is likely to hear an Edelman score piece on a regular basis throughout the country, on countless symphony programs, including the Boston Pops.\n\nRandy has for the past year or so treated sold out audiences in New York and London to his live solo performances entitled “A Life in 80 Minutes” (which spans for more like 2 hours). He has been performing on stage a behind the scenes view of his outstanding career through his music and his touching and humorous stories. Rave reviews have continuously been generated from critics including Michael Musto, publications such as Hype, Louder Than War, NY Weekly Times and a vast array of other publications.\n\nAlways dancing on the rim of a volcano, Randy continues to compose and record,lighting up the world like fireworks plunging into the night sky and shattering the darkness. The illustrious composer of modern and future times has recently released his post anthemic song of hope and inspiration titled “Comin’ Out the Other Side”, available via Tribeca Records.\n\nThe never ending saga of Randy Edelman constantly endures and advances with his ongoing work on the score for his musical, “Short Cut,” telling of the construction of the Panama Canal, and his recently released Sony Masterworks album of Randy Edelman’s orchestral score to Ghostbusters II in all formats....Randy is currently working on his brand new album “Can’t Be Killed By Any Conventional Means.”\n\nRandy wrote the hit song \"Weekend in New England\"\n\nRick Berlin w/ the Nickel & Dime Band (berlinrick.com)\n\nA Yale graduate, Berlin has been writing and performing a distinctly theatrical form of rock and roll since the early 1970s. He achieved much of his early success with Orchestra Luna, whose eponymous debut was released on Epic Records in 1974. Orchestra Luna, co-produced by Rupert Holmes, captured many of the dramatic eccentricities that made the band a renowned live act, particularly on \"(You Gotta Have) Heart\" (a cover of the Damn Yankees tune). That year, WBCN started an annual tradition of playing this particular cut for the Boston Red Sox on the baseball team's opening day. Album sales proved disappointing to Epic, though the tour for the record was successful (including an opening slot for Roxy Music). The label dropped the band, but Berlin (then Kinscherf) continued to compose and perform with Orchestra Luna, becoming a part of the CBGB scene in New York City and playing with acts like Talking Heads and The Ramones. In 1976, Orchestra Luna was offered a recording contract from Sire Records, which they turned down. Unfortunately, they found themselves unable to find a better offer. In 1978, the band's name was changed to, simply, Luna. A hit single, \"Hooray For Hollywood\" was released, but litigation with a former producer prevented a full album from following.\n\nIn 1982 his new band, Berlin Airlift (named for the Allied mission to fly food and supplies to blockaded West Berlin in 1948–1949), released its eponymous debut on Handshake/CBS Records. The album was given little chance to succeed, however, as Handshake declared bankruptcy less than two months later.[1] Nonetheless, two of the album's singles, \"Don't Stop Me From Crying\" and \"Over The Hill\" were hits on local Boston radio. In 1983, Berlin Airlift opened for the J. Geils Band and released the Professionally damaged EP. It featured \"Hunger Strikes\" which was the number one local song of 1983 on Boston radio station WBCN. The demise of Handshake Records and other difficulties led to the breakup of Berlin Airlift in 1984.\n\nRick Berlin: The Movie was formed in 1985. Berlin won Indie Songwriter of the Year at the Boston Music Awards for the single \"Rock 'n Roll Romance\" in 1987, and continued to perform in Rick Berlin: The Movie until 1989. He briefly fronted a band called Rome Is Burning in 1990, but by 1991 was performing as a solo artist. In 1994, Berlin began playing Monday nights at a Boston transvestite bar called Jacques. This weekly gig continued through 2003.\n\nIn 1999, Berlin formed one more band, The Shelley Winters Project. An eponymous, six-track CD was released on Orchard Records in 2001, followed in 2002 by the full-length I Hate Everything But You on Windjam Records. In 2003, The Shelley Winters Project opened for The B-52's, and in 2004 the band folded.\n\nBerlin recently recorded as a solo artist, and released the album Me & Van Gogh in early 2006, and \"Paper Airplane\" in 2010, both on the Hi-n-Dry label. In 2009 he appeared on the Internationally streamed, On Stage with Mantis as a soloist featuring material from 'Me & Van Gogh' and the soon to be finished 'Paper Airplanes'. He was also employed at historic Doyle's Cafe in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts until it closed October 2019.\n\nFollowing the release of \"Paper Airplane\", Rick teamed up with the already existing Nickel & Dime Band. This 8-piece band breathes new life into old Berlin tunes. Berlin continues to write new material, now with this band in mind. The Nickel & Dime band (with Rick Berlin) recorded a live show at the Brendan Behan, titled \"Outta Control\" in March 2011, and they finished up their first studio pursuit at Dimension Sound, and are expecting to release it later this year[when?]. Though on a small scale, the band has received highly positive critical acclaim, partly thanks to Berlin's preexisting reputation in his hometown Jamaica Plain.\n\nBerlin also worked in setting up the First Annual JP Music Fest, a tradition that he wants to continue for a long time. The one for 2012 is already in the works."
