        "text": "Live Aid: Rock’s Biggest Concert\n\nBob Geldof was broke. The mastermind behind the versatile punk group The Boomtown Rats was looking for a new direction and a way to desperately score some more cash. Their hit single “I Don’t Like Mondays” had been released five full years earlier, and in October 1984, The Rats were no longer a sought-after band. Geldof struggled to fulfill his contract to the record company and churned out one more record. Album sales stiffed upon its release. Bob was desperate.\n\nWorking the phones to try to get interest generated for the album’s first single, he happened to look over at the television set. A BBC documentary by Michael Buerk was being broadcast. The program was a report on the catastrophic starvation epidemic permeating the country of Ethiopia. Images of stark, skeletal human beings looking directly into the camera shook up every viewer who happened to watch the BBC report that night. Geldof had never seen starvation presented in such a blunt, horrifying manner. He did not get much sleep that evening.\n\nWhen he phoned his friend Midge Ure of Ultravox, the two of them spoke of the devastating situation in Ethiopia. Bob mentioned he was considering putting a record together to help raise money for supplies and food. Midge said he would help. From that conversation, a spark was ignited that would provoke a groundswell of musicians joining together to selflessly perform for a truly worthwhile cause. A benefit performance so massive that Geldof would begin to conceive the endeavor as taking place on two continents. The Concert for Bangladesh, The Concert For Kampuchea, even the No Nukes Concert, had all set a precedent of generosity and musical unity for a cause in the 1970s. But nothing, not ever before or since in the history of rock, would prepare the world for the sheer number of top acts it would witness in London and Philadelphia for a single day’s charitable performance on July 13, 1985.\n\nGeldof had an uncharacteristically nightmarish task ahead of him. One, convince the world’s best recording artists to contribute to his unprecedented concert. Two, line up televised coverage in practically every nation on the planet with a TV set. Three, arrange for individual networks and governments to handle massive amounts of telethon phone pledges. Four, find venues large and secure enough to accommodate the special needs of every superstar. Five, provide enough catering for every human being working tirelessly behind the scenes. And six, oh yeah, whip it all into shape in a matter of four or five months. Somehow, miraculously, he got the job done with a lot of begging and pleading.\n\nWembley Stadium in a suburb of London is Britain’s top venue for rock acts, and they offered rental of the site for somewhere in the neighborhood of $250,000. Promoter Bill Graham helped with securing a site in the United States, and after a protracted search, settled on JFK Stadium in the city of Brotherly Love. Philadelphia was not as generous as their British counterparts. All the technical and stadium personnel, along with their unions demanded to be paid. It would wind up costing around $3.5 million.\n\nMTV agreed to broadcast the event all day long. Geldof felt one of the three networks would bring cachet to the project. CBS and NBC rejected the notion at the outset. Unfortunately, ABC was not too accommodating either. They agreed to a 3-hour broadcast in the evening, showcasing the final 9 acts in Philadelphia and the grand finale in London. No telethon pleas, no continual phone numbers, this was just entertainment to them. Sadly, Geldof was faced with a sole offer he couldn’t refuse. A group of independent stations across the U.S. did, however, wind up joining together collectively to broadcast the show throughout the initial daytime hours, continually displaying phone numbers to call.\n\nAs he permanently affixed his phone to his ear, Bob Geldof enticed, cajoled, and according to some disgruntled artists, tried “emotionally blackmailing” them into appearing on the historical date. Sting was one of the first performers to sign on. He had just unofficially broken up with his bandmates, The Police, and asked not to appear with them. Mick Jagger hemmed and hawed, and he intimated that he wanted to do a song via satellite with David Bowie on both sides of the Atlantic. Time lag of the signal would not permit such a technical achievement, so the two of them got together one raucous evening to make the Live-Aid premiere video “Dancing In The Streets.” Geldof really pushed for the members of The Who to get back together and sing some songs. So much internal squabbling, particularly between Roger Daltrey and John Entwistle, suggested the reunion would not materialize. A preliminary rehearsal session was a disaster. But the group managed to put away animosities and join the proceedings.\n\nBruce Springsteen was the biggest star and the biggest catch Geldof wanted to bag for the Philadelphia half of the program. Springsteen had just married actress Julianne Phillips on May 13, 1985 and claimed he wanted time to spend with her. With The Boss out of the picture, artists were slow to commit in the States. Rumors were spreading that the concert was a shambles, severely underfunded and mismanaged from the start, and more than one musician used this as an excuse to bow out of making a commitment. Huey Lewis and the News, who were still riding high in the charts with their “Sports” album, latched onto this rumor as their reason for not appearing. Both Paul Simon and Willie Nelson decided not to appear because of the poor treatment they were receiving from promoter Bill Graham.\n\nBritish media eagerly fueled anticipation as the daily countdown wound down towards the concert. In the United States, promotion was scattershot aside from MTV’s spots, and many people were unaware of the mammoth event looming on the horizon. On the night of July 12th, Geldof went to bed with a painful back ailment, grabbing what little sleep he could. The next morning, musicians began trickling in backstage at Wembley, helping themselves to the food. Hard Rock Café wound up donating approximately $200,000 worth of catered delicacies for both the London and Philadelphia shows. Prince Charles and Princess Diana arrived and greeted the rock superstars before heading to the Royal Box. The stadium filled to capacity, and at 12 noon, a few musicians with the Royal Guard sounded “God Save The Queen.” And with that, the biggest concert in rock history began.\n\nThe first band to hit the stage was a London-based favorite by the name of Status Quo. Ripping into the opening strains of their song “Rockin’ All Over The World,” the right sentiment in light of this monumental moment, the crowd came alive with substantial cheer. Like many of the bands that were to perform that day, Status Quo had made an effort to patch up old animosities for the good of the Ethiopian cause, as bassist Alan Lancaster begrudgingly agreed to play with his estranged bandmates this one time. The British jazzy-dance group, The Style Council jumped to the stage next with a three-song set, and then it was Bob’s turn.\n\nThe Boomtown Rats were met with thunderous applause, and Geldof tried to give his all, despite the ever-increasing pain in his back. Their hit song, “I Don’t Like Mondays,” which was originally written about a schoolgirl who went on a shooting spree, now took on a different ominous tone in light of the famine situation, especially when Geldof dramatically emphasized the line, “…And the lesson today is how to die.” Aside from his microphone cutting out for about 30 seconds during their set, the Rats showed they could command an arena full of fans like any of their superstar idols.\n\nThe concert took on a snowball effect, as the rotating stage allowed for more acts to seamlessly revolve in a steady stream in front of the world audience. Singer Adam Ant, was the next act, followed by the group INXS, performing via satellite from Melbourne, Australia. Geldof’s pal Midge Ure brought his band Ultravox out for a couple of songs, including the stirring “Vienna.” An act called Loudness sent a video in from Japan, while “True” crooners Spandau Ballet slinked across the Wembley stage.\n\nThen it was America’s turn. A little before 9:00 a.m., Philadelphia time, a curly-haired, 18 year-old kid named Bernard Watson strolled out onto the massive JFK stage and played his song “Interview.” Bill Graham had discovered the boy sitting in his car in the outside parking lot earlier in the week. Watson had just driven up from Miami Beach in hopes of making something happen. Talk about dumb luck. He was the official opening act of the American half of the greatest rock concert on earth! Jack Nicholson, with his trademark sunglasses on, nervously ambled out in front of the crowds and shakily introduced Joan Baez. Positioning her quiet, folk-driven set up front wasn’t exactly a rocking way to get the Philadelphia crowd on their feet. Several people heckled her. Ever the professional, Baez finished her songs and gracefully left the stage.\n\nGeldof stopped to view some of the initial broadcast from the States backstage at Wembley, right when an American TV director decided to highlight the performances with cutaway crowd shots of sexually-enticing, jiggly, overly-endowed women. Bob immediately scrambled to get a message back to America that the suggestive cutaways might just offend many of the cultures who were tuned in at that moment around the world. Meanwhile, Elvis Costello was performing for the London crowd, only given time to sing one song, “All You Need is Love,” while Philadelphia favorites, The Hooters, followed Ms. Baez at JFK with their current hit “All You Zombies.” An Austrian band, called Opus, chimed in via satellite, and then Bristol-native Nik Kershaw, riding the British charts with his album “Human Racing,” graced the Wembley stage.\n\nPrior criticism of the event had been leveled at its somewhat apparent lack of black r&b acts on the roster. This slight backlash didn’t hamper the 60’s quartet singing sensation The Four Tops from performing next in Phillie. The soulful sounds of B.B. King and his favorite guitar Lucille drifted in via satellite from Holland, and then, Billy Ocean, singing to a backing track, got the American crowd dancing with “Caribbean Queen.” Behind him, setting up on stage were the members of the original Black Sabbath, with frontman Ozzy Osbourne rejoining his group after having split from the band in January 1979. The proceedings went from Ocean’s breezy “Loverboy” to the ear-splitting metal sounds of Black Sabbath’s “Iron Man,” and yet, the contrast in genres and styles only served to present a unified feel the world was experiencing that day.\n\nSade cooed her hits to the audience in London, Run D.M.C. barked their rap musings in Philadelphia, a Belgrade band named Yu Rock slipped in via satellite, and then Sting took center stage at Wembley. Dressed all in white and accompanied by Branford Marsalis on woodwinds, Sting performed a song from the recently-released album “The Dream of the Blue Turtles.” Phil Collins ambled out and perched at a piano to join in on a hushed, now poignant (in light of its context) version of “Every Breath You Take.” Phil was then left alone to present his song “Against All Odds (Take A Look At Me Now).” This tune would figure in the day’s truly wondrous stunt, for Collins would again perform that song, later that night, across the Atlantic. He finished onstage at 3:45 p.m. London time and was immediately helicoptered to nearby Heathrow airport, right out to the tarmac, where a Concorde jet sat idling. Breaking precedence with its normal flight path, the supersonic jet blasted blindingly low across the sky directly over Wembley stadium, and the crowds roared with awe and prideful cheer.\n\nMeanwhile teen heartthrob Rick Springfield was finishing up his set in Philadelphia, and the soft-rock sounds of REO Speedwagon wafted off the stage after him, mellowing the sun’s increasing intensity on this hot July morning. As Howard Jones held the Wembley crowd captive in his solo performance on piano, another historical moment was readying to make its international broadcast debut.\n\nThe Cold War attitudes of East and West nations were still very much a palpable reality. The Soviet Union continued to be a mysterious, monolithic nation with little exposure to the outside world. Mikhail Gorbachev was in power, and in earlier meetings with his representatives, Geldof’s point man, Richard Lukens, had tried to encourage Gorbachev to appear in the broadcast. In the end, a state-sanctioned rock band named Autograph was the only contribution the Soviets felt they needed to provide. Performing from a cramped Soviet TV studio, the band’s feed was out of sync in its time-base signal, and the world saw a static, scrambled set of songs with wooden, seemingly-apparatchik Soviet teenagers clapping nervously along, just behind the ‘60s-style television cameras. It was rumored that only about 150 people in the entire Soviet Republic watched the Live Aid broadcast. Nevertheless, an effort had been made, and another small divot had been chiseled out of the Iron Curtain on this amazing day.\n\nThe roster of acts continued to roll out. Bryan Ferry, Paul Young and Alison Moyet kept the London audience entertained, while Crosby, Stills & Nash, Judas Priest, and Bryan Adams all took to the stage at JFK over the next hour. One of the day’s truly musical highlights involved the charismatic stage presence of singer Bono and his band U2. During the song “Bad,” a sweaty, driven, Bono tried to wave several female members in the audience to make their way to the stage. Frustrated by the crushing crowd, Bono leapt to the Wembley field and helped a dazed and swoony girl body-surf her way to his side. The two slow-danced for a moment before Bono scrambled back to the stage and took command of the final strains of the song. A moment of connection, a small gesture, between pop idol and his adoring fan once again forged a powerful subliminal message that we were united for the day.\n\nThink the concert ended around this point? Are you kidding? It was just getting started. Here’s a list of the superstars that burst from the wings during the evening in London and the afternoon in Philadelphia. The Beach Boys, Dire Straits, George Thorogood and the Destroyers, Bo Diddley, Albert Collins, Queen, Simple Minds, David Bowie, The Pretenders, The Who, Santana and Pat Metheny, Elton John, Kiki Dee, George Michael, and some girl named Madonna. Amidst these sets, another strong musical moment occurred when singer Teddy Pendergrass was escorted out in his wheelchair by Ashford & Simpson in Philadelphia. Having suffered spinal paralysis from an auto accident in 1982, Pendergrass was not expected to perform again. The tears rolled down his cheeks, and down many a viewers’ as well, as the trio sang their set before an empathetic crowd.\n\nTechnical difficulties marred the early verses of Paul McCartney’s song “Let It Be” back in London. He was the last act to appear before the Wembley grand finale. A brief rain shower during Elton John’s and George Michael’s prior rendition of “Don’t Let The Sun Go Down On Me” had seeped into the sound system wiring. McCartney, who hadn’t performed in front of a large audience in five years, never let the mishap shake him. The song went on, and as the sound came back, so did fellow musicians, Pete Townshend, David Bowie, Alison Moyet, and Bob Geldof himself, to help with its rousing final verses. Townshend and McCartney hoisted the weary Bob Geldof onto their shoulders as the crowd erupted in overwhelming appreciation. All of the musicians for the Wembley performance then gathered on stage for a version of “Do They Know It’s Christmas,” and at approximately 10:00 London time, ten hours after they began, the European half of the show was over.\n\nBack in the States, Tom Petty was performing. He was followed by Kenny Loggins, The Cars, Neil Young, The Power Station, and The Thompson Twins. When Eric Clapton took to the stage, there was a fellow by the name of Phil Collins sitting in at drums behind him. Having arrived from Kennedy airport in New York, Collins now was able to perform “Against All Odds,” a second time, for the Philadelphia crowd. He stayed on stage to play drums for reunited Led Zeppelin members Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, and John Paul Jones. After the heavy metal icons stepped down, Duran Duran, followed by Patti Labelle, Hall & Oates with Eddie Kendricks and David Ruffin, and finally Mick Jagger all took their turns in the spotlight. When Jagger began his song “State of Shock,” a strutting Tina Turner joined him onstage, and the two gave a comedic, give-and-take, mock rivalry duet that resulted in Mick tearing off Turner’s miniskirt. They continued their dueling dance with “It’s Only Rock ‘n” Roll.”\n\nThis seemed like the perfect time to wrap up the Philadelphia half of the show, but something truly weird was about to unfold on the stage. As all the members of the American show were called up to perform the finale, Bob Dylan stepped out from the curtain being used to shield the crew setting up backstage, and proceeded to give a truly horrid rendition of “Blowin’ In the Wind.” Behind him, Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood of the Rolling Stones attempted to lend acoustic guitar backup, but they were not only out of sync, but gratingly out of tune, and generally disinterested in the whole arrangement. What could have been a defining punctuation mark to the day’s sensational proceedings sadly came across as a shoddy performance by a motley trio of inebriated minstrels.\n\nBut this was the only setback in a monumental day of legendary musicians and their unity in a cause. When the grand finale notes of “We Are The World” ended in JFK stadium, the time on the clock read a little after 11:00 p.m. For a solid 16 hours, the planet had experienced a rock concert unmatched in the annals of modern day music.\n\nThe day’s powerful moments and musical high points may well be too hard to rank in order for legendary purposes. But one moment which completely encapsulated the meaning behind the day’s intent, that of the power of music and of charity, was not captured in a stage performance nor by any artist’s plea. It took place within a simple video that aired on the screens in both stadiums and around the world. A documentary crew with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation had been to Ethiopia and shot some footage of a small child. An emaciated, skeletal-beyond-belief infant. The film simply showed the boy trying to accomplish a very easy task. To stand, and to walk. The song “Drive” by The Cars was the only audio heard over the picture on the screen. An odd choice one might say, but it touched a nerve in everyone who saw it. The sad strains of the tune, “Who’s gonna pick you up, when you fall down? We can’t go on saying, nothing’s wrong,” matched the empathetically somber image of that boy just trying to get up. Just trying to move. No, nothing in the concert could compare to the impact that one video had on the day.\n\nIn the end, Geldof was awarded a knighthood in recognition of his effort to relieve the famine situation in Ethiopia. At last estimate, the proceeds from the Live Aid concert and its parent organization, Band-Aid, have raised over $100 million. As of April 24, 2000, because of renewed war, regional rivalries and a three-year drought, the United Nations estimates that up to 8 million Ethiopians are again in need of urgent food and medicine to avert the ravaging horrors of widespread death by starvation.\n\n© 2000 Ned Truslow\n\nKurt Cobain: Something Short of Nirvana\n\nInterviewer Jim Crotty once asked the mastermind behind Nirvana what the title of his autobiography might be some day. With a mixture of dry wit and veiled truth, the rock legend replied, “I Was Not Thinking’ by Kurt Cobain.” Remarkably, this observation proves to be one of the most succinct and insightful snapshots into the psyche of a brilliant but troubled soul. It was obviously a self-aware statement, poking fun at his notorious insecurities with fame. Yet it was such a precise allusion to how this alienated rock star had walked blindly into becoming the gloomy guru for a nation of alienation.\n\nPinpointing the roots of his uneasiness is not a hard task to unmask. Stir together a huge dollop of sensitivity and a mature empathy for others, then suddenly drop in a broken home, and you’ll easily find a thousand kids who might wind up with a self-esteem problem. For Kurt, that pivotal moment occurred when he was 8-years old in the mid-70s. Divorce shot up the scales tenfold during this period of time. It wasn’t as commonplace as it is today. There was hardly any representation in the media or entertainment of families with single parents. A whole boatload of children more than likely had no point of reference to handle their feelings of self worth and isolation. Kurt’s fragile emotional state was frazzled when his mechanic dad Don and waitress mom Wendy suddenly put an end to their marriage. Kurt’s mom later told Newsweek magazine that the divorce “just destroyed his life. He changed completely. I think he was ashamed. And he became very inward – he just held everything (in).”\n\nThe town where Kurt was raised didn’t seem to harbor any shelter for his emotional woes. Aberdeen, Washington is a rural coastal town about 100 miles south of Seattle that has a commonplace small city fondness for pickup trucks and the simple life. Lumber mills are pretty much sacred institutions within the town’s limits. “Basically if you’re not prepared to join the logging industry,” Kurt once explained to Monk magazine, “you’re going to be beaten up or run out of town.” Over the next years of his adolescence, Kurt faced both scenarios.\n\nHis creative spirit manifested itself with a fondness for singing as a toddler. He was interested in art, making collages and toying with claymation. Oftentimes, young Kurt would appear at one of his musician aunt’s local performances and strum on her band’s guitar while they were setting up. But the hurt he suffered inside from his parents’ parting probably molded his inclinations to look within for inspiration instead of from outside influence. He basically took shelter in himself. He did not want to become anything that Aberdeen had to offer. He grew to despise the limited viewpoints and macho swagger that the town’s numerous so-called rednecks seemed to cherish. Kurt chose to be the antithesis of a testosterone-fueled, beer-swilling male. “I used to pretend I was gay just to f*** with people,” he told The Advocate magazine. “I’ve had the reputation of being a homosexual ever since I was 14.”\n\nBy his late teens, Kurt was becoming more disenchanted with his environs. He was sent to stay with different relatives over the years. He dropped out of high school (yet he spent much of his time reading many books in the local library). Soon thereafter, he was kicked out of the trailer home he shared with his mom, applied for food stamps, and lived under an Aberdeen bridge with some homeless men. Around this time, he discovered The Melvins.\n\nIn essence, The Melvins were the founding forefathers of the Seattle grunge movement. While punk rock had seethed mostly from the shores of England in the mid-to-late 70’s, America’s angry punk spirit only seemed to filter out of clubs like New York’s CBGB and from LA bands like X. The laid-back Northwest was known more for its folk music than it was for its metal sound. That all changed with the Melvins. Melodic sludge-rock churned from the power trio’s amps, and their dispirited attitude seemed to capture the imagination of Cobain. Soon, he was hauling their road gear. One day, the group’s Buzz Osbourne introduced Kurt to a young kid named Chris Novoselic.\n\nNovoselic, who would later be known by his Croatian name Krist, was raised in Los Angeles, but he’d moved to the Aberdeen area when he was 14. Kurt told interviewer Gina Arnold, “I wanted to start a band really bad, and I got an electric guitar and I was really into it, but I couldn’t find anyone in Aberdeen to be in a band with. I was lucky to find Chris at the time.” The two began hanging out and sharing musical interests. They also pulled pranks. In 1985, the boys were arrested for spray painting the words “Homo Sex Rules” on the side of a bank.\n\nKrist told Radio Triple J Australia, “Kurt did a tape with Dale Crover, (the drummer) from The Melvins, and one of the songs on it was ‘Spank Thru,’ and he turned me on to it, and I kinda liked it, it got me excited, so I go, ‘Hey man, let’s start a band!’ We scrounged up a drummer, and we started practicing; took it very seriously too.” Around this time, Kurt’s outward dissatisfaction with Aberdeen reached a pinnacle. “I decided to take some acid one evening and spray paint ‘queer’ on the sides of 4 x 4 trucks, the local rednecks’ trucks” he related to Monk magazine. “And so one of them saw me from his window and started chasing me and started screaming, ‘There’s the queer vandal!’ I’d been doing it for awhile. But that night I decided to really go for it and do a lot, a lot of vandalism. So they caught me and chased me around.” They pretty much chased him out of town.\n\nKurt settled in the nearby college burg of Olympia. He spent part of his time as a janitor with Lemons Janitorial Service. The rest of his waking hours, he played in a band with Krist along with an assortment of drummers. Their band names morphed from Fecal Matter to Skid Row to Ed Ted & Fred to Bliss to Throat Oyster to Pen Cap Chew, and finally to Nirvana. After Jonathan Poneman of local indie label Sub Pop heard one of their demos, he signed them up and sent them out on tour. Kurt remembered what their first gig was like to Backlash magazine. “We were uptight. It just didn’t seem like a real show. We felt like we were being judged, it was like everyone should’ve had score cards. Plus, I was sick. I puked that day. That’s a good excuse.” These comments reflect early signs of his feeling a lack of worthiness before an audience and perhaps a hint of stomach problems to come.\n\nModeling their early songs after the punk spirit of The Melvins, the tunes Kurt and company laid down for their Sub Pop debut album, “Bleach,” consisted of grinding guitars and lots of wailed lyrics, with only half the craft that would later accentuate their output. “Bleach’ is seen to be really one-dimensional,” Kurt later observed to Radio Triple J Australia. “It has the same format, all the songs are slow, and grungey, and they’re tuned down to really low notes, and I screamed a lot.” Recorded in 3 days for a mere $606.17, the album did garner the band lots of college radio airplay. The band settled into a series of tours throughout the rest of 1989 and 1990, honing their abilities. By the spring of 1990, Nirvana felt confident enough to record again.\n\nButch Vig was a producer in Madison, Wisconsin who had recently recorded a band named the Smashing Pumpkins. Cobain and Novoselic, along with drummer Chad Channing, stopped into his Smart Studio, and laid down some early versions of songs like “Lithium” and “Polly” that would soon show up on their future landmark album. “When I heard some of the demos for “Nevermind,” I was blown away,” Vig remarked, “because they were so poppy, even though the band was totally onslaught rockin’ when they played – it had a very hooky pop sense to it.” Channing soon left the band, and Kurt and Krist decided to hold off on letting Sub Pop release the songs on an album until they found another drummer. Dave Grohl of the Washington D.C. punk outfit Scream was soon recruited.\n\nMajor labels began to get wind of the talented trio, and after a huge bidding war, David Geffen’s DGC label signed the band. In May 1991, the band temporarily relocated to the Los Angeles area and laid down tracks at Van Nuys’ Sound City studio. Gone were the raw, undisciplined punk attitudes they had infused in their earlier work. The hard rock was still there, but the band had a polished assault, while the lyrics were incisive and kinetic. Kurt had truly searched within his soul to wrench the feelings of disconnection into the microphone. These were songs from the depths of his despairing heart. One of his lyrics went like so: “And I forget just why I taste/Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile/I found it hard, it was hard to find/Oh well, whatever, never mind.” They were contained within a vibrant, screeching anthem of a tune called “Smells Like Teen Spirit.” The song would thrust the band, and particularly Cobain, into the media spotlight overnight.\n\nKurt told Radio Triple J Australia about the origins of the smash hit. “This friend of mine and I were goofing around my house one night, and we were kinda drunk, and we were writing graffiti all over the walls of my house, and she wrote, ‘Kurt smells like teen spirit.’ And earlier on, we were kinda having this discussion on revolution, and teen revolution and stuff like that, and I took that as a compliment. I thought that she was saying that I was a person who, who could inspire…And it turns out she just meant that I smelt like the deodorant. I didn’t even know that deodorant existed until after the song was written.”\n\nThe album “Nevermind” was released in September 1991. Its mix of heavy metal and punk helped singe the definition of ‘grunge’ into America’s consciousness. Where Nirvana busted open the door, Seattle-area bands like Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains followed through with the same kind of formula. Filming an anarchic high school pep rally for their music video to “Teen Spirit,” the band drop-kicked their fame straight to the top when MTV began airing the clip incessantly over the next few months. After 14 weeks on the chart, “Nevermind” smacked Michael Jackson’s “Dangerous” out of America’s top position on January 11, 1992. Soon, millions of teenagers would be loping about the streets with meticulously torn jeans and natty flannel shirts. And the instant media attention seemed to overwhelm Kurt from the start.\n\nHe told journalist Michael Deeds shortly after “Nevermind”’s release, “I’m constantly feeling guilty in ways. Our music, especially on this album, is so slick-sounding. A few years ago, I would’ve hated our band, to tell you the truth.” By January 1992, the album would go platinum. DGC had only expected to sell about 200,000 copies. “Nevermind” would eventually tally over 13 million copies worldwide, 7 million of that in the United States. Kurt could confide his insecurities with Chris and Dave, but another person was foremost in his life at the time. And unlike Kurt, she definitely didn’t mind the spotlight.\n\nTowards the end of 1991, Courtney Love was pregnant with Kurt’s child. A bleach-blond singer who had weathered some very harsh realities in her own life, Courtney seemed to pride herself on displaying her emotional battle scars to the world. She related a smidgen of her upbringing to Spin magazine. “I was moved around a lot. I have a really dysfunctional family. My mother is really detached. My real father is insane. The only good person in my family is my stepfather. He wasn’t in my life that much, though, and I was in institutions. I was in juvenile hall for four years (after stealing a KISS T-shirt from a Woolworths), boarding school for three years (in New Zealand). You know, I tried to be a stoner because they were bad.” Courtney’s dad, reportedly a manager for the Grateful Dead in the 1960s, turned her onto acid when she was three years old. He subsequently wasn’t allowed to see her until she was an adult. Courtney had gone to Japan as a stripper at age 15. To say the least, she was probably more of a walking wounded soul than her reclusive beau.\n\nHaving seen Kurt in concert in 1988, she set about to snare her man. “I really pursued him, not too aggressive, but aggressive enough that some girls would have been embarrassed by it,” she told Sassy magazine. “I’m direct. That can scare a lot of boys…Kurt was scared of me. He said he didn’t have time to deal with me. But I knew it was inevitable.” During the band’s 1992 European tour, Kurt and Courtney took time off to get married in Waikiki, Hawaii on February 24, 1992. Marital bliss was met in the media by fixation on another byproduct of their union. That of the couple’s fondness for heroin.\n\nThe nagging stomach problems that had chronically plagued Kurt sporadically in pre-“Nevermind” days seemed to manifest themselves in a more accelerated manner. On June 22, 1992, an ailing Cobain was rushed to a Northern Ireland hospital after a performance at the King’s Hall in Belfast. He tried to explain his symptoms and the media’s misread on them to the Los Angeles Times. “I’ve had this terrible stomach problem for years and that has made touring difficult. People would see me sitting in the corner by myself looking sick and gloomy. The reason is that I was trying to fight against the stomach pain, trying to hold my food down. People looked at me and assumed I was some kind of addict…We have a lot of young fans and I don’t want to have anything to do with inciting drug use. People who promote drug use are (expletive). I chose to do drugs. I don’t feel sorry for myself at all, but have nothing good to say about them. They are a total waste of time.” Meanwhile, he was feeling completely inadequate with the tremendous adulation he was receiving for his work. “I guess I must have quit the band about 10 different times in the last year…” he revealed. “The music is usually what brings me back.”\n\nWhen Vanity Fair magazine reported that Courtney had been using heroin during her first month of pregnancy, she didn’t deny it. But after their baby, Frances Bean, was born on August 18, 1992, and Los Angeles social workers tried to place their child with Courtney’s sister, Love had a lot to say about the validity of Vanity Fair’s claims. They soon got custody of their child back, but the duo didn’t stay out of the news for long. A fracas with reigning headbanger extraordinaire, Axl Rose of Guns N’ Roses, backstage at the MTV Music Video Awards made headlines around the world.\n\n“They’re really talentless people,” Kurt offered in his assessment of Guns N’ Roses to The Advocate magazine. “And they write crap music, and they’re the most popular rock band on the earth right now. I can’t believe it.” As for the incident, he said, “They actually tried to beat us up. Courtney and I were just with the baby in the eating area backstage, and Axl walked by. So Courtney yelled, ‘Axl! Axl, come over here!’ We just wanted to say hi to him – we think he’s a joke, but we just wanted to say something to him. So I said, ‘Will you be the godfather of our child?’ I don’t know what had happened before that to piss him off, but he took his aggressions out on us and began screaming bloody murder. These were his words, ‘You shut your bitch up, or I’m taking you down to the pavement.’ Everyone around us just burst out into tears of laughter. She wasn’t even saying anything mean, you know? So I turned to Courtney and said, ‘Shut up, bitch!’ And everyone laughed and he left. So I guess I did what he wanted me to do – be a man.”\n\nKurt’s mood swings over his life and his career continued to show warning signs of coming apart in his statements to the media throughout 1992. He said to Melody Maker magazine, “I’ve had days where I’ve considered this to be a job, and I never thought that would happen. It makes me question the point of it all. I’m gonna bitch about it for another year and, if I can’t handle it after that, we’re gonna have to make some drastic changes.” He was already figuring on a way to stop the perpetual motion machine he’d help create. “People think I’m a moody person, and I think it’s lame that there are only two kinds of male lead singer,” he continued defensively. “You can either be a moody visionary like Michael Stipe (of R.E.M.), or a mindless heavy metal party guy like Sammy Hagar.” Cobain clearly tended to lump the latter performer in with the memories of the yahoos he once despised in Aberdeen.\n\nSometimes those yahoos crossed the boundaries into Nirvana’s world, and it upset them deeply. “I’m neurotic about credibility,” Courtney Love commented to Vanity Fair. “And Kurt is neurotic about it, too. He’s dealing with people who like his band who he despises. For instance, a girl was raped in Reno. When they were raping her, they were singing ‘Polly,’ a Nirvana song. These are the people who listen to him.” This incident so incensed Cobain that he wrote a message to his fans in the liner notes of Nirvana’s next release, January 1993’s “Incesticide” (a collection of B-sides, demos, live recordings, and outtakes). His fury read, “If any of you in any way hate homosexuals, people of different color, or women, please do this one favor for us – leave us the f*** alone! Don’t come to our shows and don’t buy our records.”\n\nThe sensitive kid from Aberdeen still wished to act against the injustices of an intolerant society, but the multitudes of despondent fans who wanted his leadership in their lives began to wear heavily on Cobain’s psyche. He did not want that responsibility. Nevertheless, by May 1993, the band was in Minnesota, at a remote studio, recording their next album for 12 days with underground producer Steve Albini. Cobain wanted to return to a less-polished sound. The band played together live on most of the tunes without much time spent on overdubbing or multiple tracks. They later brought in producer Scott Litt of R.E.M. fame to tweak a few songs like “Heart-Shaped Box” and “All Apologies.” One song they had recorded was favored by Kurt to also be the title of the album. It was called “I Hate Myself and Want to Die.”\n\nThe song was actually meant to be a jokey take on the continually-morose portrayal of the band. They removed the song from the album, however. “We knew people wouldn’t get it,” Kurt told Rolling Stone magazine. “They’d take it too seriously. It was totally satirical, making fun of ourselves. I’m thought of as this pissy, complaining, freaked-out schizophrenic who wants to kill himself all the time. ‘He isn’t satisfied with anything.’ And I thought it was a funny title.” The band’s label, DGC, decided to place the song in a more overtly humorous package, as the lead song on 1993’s “Beavis and Butt-Head Experience” CD.\n\nWhile it was refreshing to see the jovial side of Kurt Cobain in this instance, he clearly was struggling to get a handhold on his substance abuse. A few months earlier, in February, he had told The Advocate, “Everyone thinks we’re on drugs again, even people we work with. I guess I’ll have to get used to that for the rest of my life.” He certainly didn’t give the media any evidence to suggest otherwise during the summer of 1993. On May 2nd, he was taken to Seattle’s Harborview Medical Center after police found that, with the help of Courtney, he had injected himself with massive amounts of heroin and the drug buprenorphine at a party. Kurt wound up spending much of the rest of May at a rehab clinic. But on June 4th, police were again summoned into his life, when they broke up a dispute at the couple’s Washington home and confiscated several weapons. By July 23rd, when he overdosed in a New York hotel before performing at the New Music Seminar, it was evident that Cobain was spiraling out of orbit.\n\nHis easygoing lifestyle was also being bombarded at home with the musical aspirations of his wife. Courtney had been in bands since 1988, but it was the formation of Hole in 1990 that soon brought her notoriety amongst fans and record label representatives. According to her interview with Barbara Walters, the band name was derived from something her neglectful mother once told her: ‘Now Courtney, you know you can’t walk around with a hole in yourself just because you had a bad childhood.” By the end of 1992, her husband’s label, DGC, had signed Hole for a major album release. She was eager to attain the same success as he had.\n\nNirvana’s fourth album, “In Utero,” was released on September 21, 1993, and it entered the U.S. chart at #1 on October 9th, displacing Garth Brook’s “In Pieces.” Artwork featuring fetuses that Cobain had designed was displayed on the album’s back cover. Both K-Mart and Walmart chains refused to stock the CD, citing offensive content. A subdued design was later released, and the song “Rape Me,” (an anti-rape song!), clearly printed on the back, was altered to read, “Waif Me.”\n\nOne of the band’s finest moments occurred on November 18, 1993, when they taped an “Unplugged” episode for MTV at New York’s Sony Studios. Kurt’s voice was at top form, with eloquent emotion, as the group worked through several of their tunes along with many cover songs. The recording would be released a year later and hit number one on the U.S. chart on November 19, 1994.\n\nThe year 1994 began with the band heading out on the road to Europe for a two month-long tour. It would be their last. In February, Fender Frontline magazine caught up with Kurt and enquired as to the future of the group. “I’m extremely proud of what we’ve accomplished together,” he offered. “Having said that however, I don’t know how long we can continue as Nirvana without a radical shift in direction. I have lots of ideas and ambitions that have nothing to do with the mass conception of ‘grunge’ that has been force-fed to the record buying public for the last few years. Whether I will be able to do everything I want to do as part of Nirvana remains to be seen. To be fair, I also know that both Krist and Dave have musical ideas that may not work in the context of Nirvana. We’re all tired of being labeled. You can’t imagine how stifling it is.”\n\nIt seemed like Kurt wouldn’t mind if he just stepped down from the racehorse for awhile. No implications of suicidal tendencies, but instead just an attempt to regroup in his head, turn inward once again. He passed up the offer to headline the 1994 Lollapalooza concert tour in the summer, a venture that would have yielded the band millions of dollars. To Kurt, he already had more than enough. He wanted some of his old life back. On March 1st, after a show in Munich, Germany, he opted to end the European tour, delaying the succeeding dates for a future time to be scheduled. He hopped a plane for Rome and checked into the posh Excelsior Hotel. Courtney and Frances Bean flew in a day later to be with him. At 5:30am on the morning of March 3rd, she awoke to find Kurt in a coma. He was rushed to Umberto 1 Polyclinic Hospital, where he had champagne, and close to 50 prescription pills, pumped from his stomach.\n\nWhen he came out of his coma, Kurt asked for a milkshake. Official press reports blamed the incident on his own elation over being reunited with Courtney after a month’s separation. However, the fact that there were so many pills in his system tended to spread the rumor that it had been a failed suicide attempt. Nevertheless, Kurt was discharged a few days later on March 8th, and doctors seemed to think his condition was stable. Dr. Osvaldo Galletta at the Italian hospital told Newsweek magazine, “The last image I have of him, which in light of the tragedy now seems pathetic, is of a young man playing with the little girl. He did not seem like a young man who wanted to end it. I had hope for him.”\n\nBack in the States, life never seemed to get back on even keel for the troubled musician. Seattle police were called to the Cobain home on the evening of March 18th, responding to a report that Kurt had locked himself in a room with guns and was threatening to kill himself. The authorities managed to coax him from the room, whereupon Kurt insisted he had not tried to commit suicide, but rather was trying to get away from Courtney. The cops confiscated 4 guns, 25 boxes of ammunition, and a bottle of assorted pills. A week later, on March 25th, Courtney allegedly staged an ‘intervention,’ with Kurt’s friends and managers in attendance, coercing Kurt to go into an LA rehab. He agreed to admit himself, but later wouldn’t board the plane. Courtney went on to Los Angeles, hoping he would soon follow. She later told Barbara Walters that Kurt “was ganged-up upon. I don’t think that intervention works on certain people of a certain age…I shouldn’t have called for an intervention. I just panicked.”\n\nWhile Courtney holed up in the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills, Kurt had his best friend, Dylan Carlson, take him to Stan Baker Sports shop in Seattle to purchase a gun on March 30th. With the confiscation of his weapons, Kurt didn’t think he could buy one after the recent police incident. “We used to go shooting together,” Carlson later told the Seattle Post Intelligencer. “He said he wanted the gun for protection.” Carlson purchased a Remington M-11-20 gauge shotgun for Cobain that day. Kurt took the weapon home, and then boarded a flight for Los Angeles that night. He checked himself into the Exodus rehabilitation clinic in Marina Del Rey.\n\nWhile he was at the center, Courtney reportedly contacted him by phone. She later related a particular phone call to Barbara Walters. “I told him he dropped the baby. And I was mean about it. I wasn’t really mean, but I wasn’t nice about it. You know, we were really polite to each other, generally. And I told him on the phone, I’m like, ‘You know you dropped the baby…the other day, you dropped the baby.’ He was like, ‘What?’ I’m like, ‘You dropped the baby, you dropped Francies on her head.’ She was wearing a big hooded coat. He did not hurt her, and I did not need to tell him that.” Courtney conveyed that this was a major trigger in Kurt’s subsequent actions. “I do, I think that’s a major reason. Also, he felt like a waste of space, and a sellout, and he had made everything too huge, and it was his fault that everything was too huge, know what I mean? I mean it came like a Mack truck.”\n\nWhatever fallout the conversation between the two had rendered, one thing’s for sure: on Friday night, April 1st, Kurt climbed the walls of the facility and left. He arrived in Seattle on Saturday morning and was taken to his Lake Washington home by a hired driver. He allegedly purchased shotgun shells at some point that weekend. Exactly what transpired after that is up to speculation. The outcome is crystal clear. According to the King County coroner’s report, Kurt Cobain died sometime during Tuesday, April 5, 1994. On Friday, April 8th, around 8:40am, a 50-year old electrician named Gary Smith, who had been contracted to install a motion detector and lights on the property, wandered to the back garage house and climbed the stairs to a second story deck. He saw something that looked like a mannequin lying on the floor inside, but upon further inspection, peering through the window, he saw dried blood around the figure’s head. He phoned 911.\n\nSeattle firemen arrived and broke a pane in one of the French doors to the upper room, and gained access. Police fished out the wallet from the body’s pocket. It was Kurt Cobain. A cigar box filled with syringes, a spoon, some cigarette butts, $120 in cash, and an open can of Root Beer all lay about the floor near his body. Kurt was resting on his back with the Remington shotgun between his legs, pointing towards his chin, his left hand holding the gun. Two rounds were reportedly in the shotgun and one spent shell was on the floor. The pellet wounds from the spent shot had been released in the upper mouth of the victim. An enormous amount of heroin was allegedly later found in his system. In a flower tray filled with dirt, a note written in red ink contained handwriting traced to Kurt. It was mostly a jumbled, stream-of-conscious, pronouncement to his fans. Only a few lines were devoted to his wife and daughter.\n\nThis was how it ended. The death was ruled a suicide. Adamant opposition to that summation has been raised quite vociferously by one Tom Grant. A former detective in the Los Angeles area, Grant was a private investigator in 1994 when he claimed Courtney hired him to trace Kurt’s whereabouts shortly after his departure from the Exodus clinic on April 1st. Grant claims he became privy to many conversations with Love over the next month which heightened his suspicions that she may have had something to do directly with the death of Cobain. He alleges that Kurt was wanting to divorce Courtney and that she wanted him to go on the Lollapalooza tour to reap the millions he was being offered. He contends that she staged a phony overdose for herself on the night she thought Kurt would be murdered, Saturday, April 2nd, so that it would look like a dual suicide pact. He points to the assertion that with so much heroin in his bloodstream, Kurt would be incapable of picking up the gun, let alone pulling the trigger. And Grant’s biggest allegation is that the note left behind was not a suicide message, but instead a letter Cobain had simply been writing to let his fans know he was going to retire from the spotlight for awhile. Grant’s assertion is that whoever killed Cobain felt the note was tinged with the right ‘farewell’ sentiment that it could aid in masking the murder by being perceived as a suicide note.\n\nCourtney’s own estranged father, Hank Harrison, wrote a book called “Who Killed Kurt Cobain?,” a tome that certainly didn’t rule out the possibility that his own daughter might have had a hand in it. A slew of websites have devoted much server time to the advancement of this theory. Filmmaker Nick Broomfield shot a documentary entitled “Kurt and Courtney” in 1998, and he presented several on-camera interviews with subjects who claimed to have knowledge of key facts that might have pointed to foul play in the matter. With no formal investigation being conducted by the Seattle Police Department on the homicide front, it is a moot issue at the time of this writing to pursue a dissertation on the speculations. However credible or incredible the evidentiary facts stack up, the outcome from the action resulted in true sorrow and a sense of great loss across the world.\n\nFellow Seattle rocker, Pearl Jam’s Eddie Vedder, seemed to be tapped into the same disenchantment and introspection in his lyrics that Kurt presented on his albums. He spoke with Melody Maker about his take on what might have driven Cobain to crash so hard. “The thing is you’d think your ego would be massive, playing for all these people, having all these people sing your songs. The fact is, you never think you’re that good. You don’t feel like you deserve this kind of attention or adulation. And so what you end up feeling instead of this large ego is, you feel like you’re worthless. You can’t live up to the glorification, and it makes you feel small and it makes you feel real s****y.”\n\nSensitive soul Michael Stipe of R.E.M. reflected to Newsweek that the awesome surge in popularity Nirvana experienced would be hard for any average Joe to weather responsibly. “If R.E.M. had sold 5 million copies of ‘Murmur’ (their first album), none of us would be alive to tell the tale. I really believe that. I’d have died with Quaaludes in my blood and a lot of Jack Daniels.” He went on to reveal his intentions of teaming with Kurt. “I know what the next Nirvana recording was going to sound like. It was going to be very quiet and acoustic, with lots of stringed instruments. It was going to be an amazing f***ing record, and I’m a little bit angry at him for killing himself. He and I were going to record a trial run of the album, a demo tape. It was all set up. He had a plane ticket. He had a car picking him up. And at the last minute, he called and said, ‘I can’t come.”\n\nDanny Goldberg, Nirvana’s onetime manager, told Time magazine, “In all the years I knew him, he had very mixed feelings about being on this planet.” In the same issue, Daniel House, an owner of an independent record label and friend of Kurt, said, “None of this would have happened had he not been famous. When Nirvana started catching on, he was kind of bewildered. His music was so personal, it amazed him when people came out in droves to hear it.”\n\nJournalists and fans alike descended on Seattle in the days following the discovery of Kurt’s body. The community spirit of admirers had the same deep sense of shock throughout their pack as did those hordes of sympathizers who surrounded Graceland in 1977 and the Dakota in 1980. A public memorial service was held at the Seattle Center Flag Plaza on Sunday, April 10th. Both Courtney and Krist released taped statements to the gathered throng.\n\nCobain’s body was cremated. Esquire magazine reported that Courtney put some of the ashes in an urn, some in a Buddhist shrine in their Washington home, and buried a bit in the back garden. The remaining remains were packed into a teddy bear knapsack which she carried with her practically everywhere in the days following the tragedy. She traveled to Ithaca, New York where she brought the ashes to Namgyal Buddhist monks who chanted and prayed over them, sending Kurt on his way and taking away the bad karma surrounding his demise. She reportedly left them with two handfuls of remains and went on a Hole concert tour with the rest, promoting her album “Live Through This,” which was released two weeks after Kurt’s death.\n\nKrist Novoselic and Dave Grohl privately mourned during the months following their friend’s passing. They first appeared at a live performance together on July 12, 1994 as part of the Stinky Puffs, a band led by a 10 year-old boy, at the opening of the Yo Yo A Go Go Festival in Olympia, Washington. In 1995, Grohl moved out from behind the drums to lead guitar and lead vocal with the quirky and highly successful band Foo Fighters. Novoselic paired with a Venezuelan street singer in 1997, forming Sweet 75 and immersed himself in the world of politics. When the town of Aberdeen proposed a plan to erect a memorial to Kurt, Krist none-too-subtly vowed to take the life-size sculpture and ‘smash it to bits.’ The town council decided not to go through with the memorial.\n\nIn the days following Cobain’s passing, several reported ‘copycat’ suicides began occurring around the globe. A man who had attended the April 10th public memorial service, went home afterwards and shot himself to death. The media counseled distraught teens to take caution and call hotlines should they be depressed to the point of self-destruction. Kurt’s cousin, Bev Cobain, a psychiatric nurse who also suffered from clinical depression, wrote a book aimed at troubled teens titled “When Nothing Matters Anymore.” “I wanted the kids to know that role models make bad decisions, too,” she said. “Kurt was a wonderful role model in many respects, but he made a bad decision. I wanted people to see that there are other options.”\n\nThe garage behind the Cobain’s Lake Washington house was demolished in June 1996.\n\nWhile much of history since the early ‘90s tends to look at the ‘grunge’ movement as a period of self-absorbed, devastatingly-downbeat bands such as Nirvana who cashed in on teen malaise, the music that was created during those times still endures. The captivating quality Kurt Cobain possessed was the ability to translate such vivid imagery to words of value and meaning. The solid musicianship that poured forth from the trio’s instruments was uncompromisingly solid rock. Adolescents weaned on the merits of grunge went on to mix many of the hard rock sounds of the genre with hip-hop vibes, in turn creating today’s bands like Korn, Limp Bizkit, and Kid Rock. While his spirit was frail and chipped, Kurt Cobain’s music contains a hearty dose of bravado and craft. Many of the bands that came after Nirvana tried to jump on the ‘whine’ wagon, and not only did we begin to reject their misery, consumers came to see it as markedly phony. The rock/rap of today is grounded in moronic self-assurance, and the pop resurgence showed that music lovers were eager to just hear something lightweight.\n\nEven though he was a grunge emo, it was always refreshing to know that Kurt was well aware that he was being a pain about his self-absorption. When he was asked by Monk magazine to assess the band members of Nirvana, he kiddingly obliged. For drummer Grohl, he said, “Dave is in really good shape although he smokes two packs of cigarettes a day.” Sizing up bassist Novoselic, Kurt offered, “Chris is the horror of the stars. He has no shame whatsoever in carousing with the likes of Winona Ryder and Johnny Depp.” As for himself, Mr. Cobain was succinct and deliciously self-aware. “F*** him, he complains too much.”\n\nSidebar: The “Suicide” Note\n\nTo Boddah pronounced,\n\nSpeaking from the tongue of an experienced simpleton who obviously would rather be an emasculated, infantile complain-ee, this note should be pretty easy to understand. All the warnings from the punk rock 101 courses over the years. Since my first introduction to the, shall we say, ethics involved with independence and the embracement of your community has proven to be very true. I haven’t felt the excitement of listening to, as well as creating, music along with reading and writing for too many years now. I feel guilty beyond words about these things. For example, when we’re backstage and the lights go out and the manic roar of the crowd begins, it doesn’t affect me the way in which it did for Freddie Mercury who seemed to love, and relish in the love and adoration from the crowd. Which is something I totally admire and envy. The fact is I can’t fool you. Any one of you. It simply isn’t fair to you or me. The worst crime I can think of would be to rip people off by faking it and pretending as if I’m having 100% fun. Sometimes I feel as if I should have a punch-in time clock before I walk out on stage. I’ve tried everything within my power to appreciate it, (and I do, God, believe me I do, but it’s not enough). I appreciate the fact that I and we have affected and entertained a lot of people. I must be one of those narcissists who only appreciated things when they’re gone. I’m too sensitive. I need to be slightly numb in order to regain the enthusiasm I once had as a child. On our last three tours, I’ve had a much better appreciation for all the people I’ve known personally and as fans of our music, but I still can’t get over the frustration, the guilt and empathy I have for everyone. There’s good in all of us, and I think I simply love people too much. So much that it makes me feel too f***ing sad. The sad little, sensitive, unappreciative, Pisces, Jesus man! Why don’t you just enjoy it? I don’t know. I have a goddess of a wife who sweats ambition and empathy and a daughter who reminds me too much of what I used to be. Full of love and joy kissing every person she meets because everyone is good and will do her no harm. And that terrifies me to the point to where I can barely function. I can’t stand the thought of Frances becoming the miserable self-destructive, death rocker that I’ve become. I have it good, very good, and I’m grateful, but since the age of seven, I’ve become hateful towards all humans in general. Only because it seems so easy for people to get along, and have empathy. Empathy! Only because I love and feel for people too much I guess. Thank you all from the pit of my burning nauseous stomach for your letters and concern during the past years. I’m too much of an erratic, moody baby! I don’t have the passion anymore and so remember, it’s better to burn out than to fade away.\n\nPeace, love, empathy. Kurt Cobain\n\nFrances and Courtney, I’ll be at your altar.\n\nPlease keep going Courtney for Frances\n\nFor her life, which will be so much happier without me.\n\nI Love you. I love you!\n\n© 2001 Ned Truslow\n\nFreddie Mercury: “I’ll Keep on Singing Till the End”\n\nIn 1990, when Queen was holed up in their studio in Montreux, Switzerland, laying down tracks for what was to be their “Innuendo” album, guitarist Brian May put together some lyrics for a song the band was working on. “I’ll face it with a grin,” the lyrics concluded, “I’m never giving in, On with the show, I’ll top the bill, I’ll overkill, I have to find the will to carry on, On with the…, On with the show, The show must go on.” May was wary about approaching Freddie Mercury with these words. “I did ask him at one point if he was okay about it,” May told Rock Power Magazine. “And he said, ‘Yeah, totally okay about it. I will give it my all.’ And he did.” Mercury, at that time, was extremely ill. The AIDS virus he had contracted was full blown, wrenching much of the stamina he used to easily muster in the studio and on the stage. A year later he would lose his battle with the terrible disease. But ever the consummate professional, he sang the words to “The Show Must Go On” with every ounce of heartfelt commitment he put into all of his work. Listening to the track, one would never guess this singer was anywhere near his final curtain call.\n\nNobody knows for sure when Freddie Mercury learned he had become HIV positive. Some reports put it as five years before his death. Others at seven years. But one thing is for sure, Freddie did not wish to alarm his fans, friends and family. We were all kept pretty much in the dark until the end. He, instead, clearly wanted us to remember him as the jolly troubadour, the venerable showman whose music and skill brought pleasure to millions throughout the world.\n\nFrom an early age, it seemed as if Mercury was destined to please others. When a man photographed Freddie smiling at the age of one year’s old, the picture wound up winning the grateful shutterbug first prize in a baby snapshot contest. This first sign of outward showmanship occurred on the island of Zanzibar, off the African coastline near Tanzania. It was here that Freddie was born to Indian parents, Parsees to be exact, in September 1946. His birth name was Farok Bulsara (not Farookh or Faroukh, corrects his brother-in-law Roger, as many archivists have gone on to misspell) and his last name was in recognition of his family’s hometown in India known as Bulsar. His father was a cashier for the British government, a job which took him many places throughout the Indian Ocean region.\n\nFarok attended boarding school from the ages of 8 to 16 in Panchgani, India, near Bombay, and rarely saw his family, except on summer holiday back in Zanzibar. It was while at school that he came to be known by a more English-sounding familiar name, Freddie. When Zanzibar garnered independent rule from the British in 1964, revolution broke out, and the Bulsaras, with Freddie now graduated, moved to the working class suburb of Feltham, England, directly in the flight path of Heathrow Airport. Heading to Ealing College to study art design, Freddie hankered for the music world that was bubbling up everywhere in mid-60s London. Having been a member of a band back at boarding school, Freddie soon got another one going called Ibex. He often crossed paths with another local band, Smile, that had guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor as part of its members. Freddie and Roger opened a fashion and art stall in the Kensington Market in London. After a brief spell in another group called Wreckage, Freddie got together with May and Taylor to form a new band. In the midst of auditioning several bass players, they were introduced to John Deacon at a disco one night, and asking him to join, the group Queen was poised to conquer the world.\n\nRoger Taylor had liked the name ‘Rich Kids.’ Brian had tossed in a few suggestions, like ‘Grand Dance’ and ‘Build Your Own Boat,’ but the band went with Freddie’s main pitch, ‘Queen,’ seeing the royalty connotations and Freddie’s flamboyance as two subjects to play off of. By this time, Freddie had changed his last name to Mercury. He later told his brother-in-law, Roger, that he chose the moniker because it was his rising planet (in astrology). Roger related to the Sunday Times magazine that, “when he told me, I said, ‘it’s a bloody good job it wasn’t Uranus.’ Freddie never forgave me for that.”\n\nHaving been raised in the Zoroastrian faith, Mercury liked to play on the dream-like imagery and spiritual truths inherent in the religion with his lyrics for Queen. Standard sentiments of strength, confidence, and love, the bedrock of his faith, were constant themes he explored in his songwriting. Zoroastrianism is based on the teachings of the Persian prophet Spitaman Zarathustra, who lived and preached around 1500 B.C. He spoke of an all-knowing, supreme God, Ahura Mazda, who created man as the central figure in the cosmic struggle against the wicked spirit Anghra Mazda.\n\nWhile Mercury had hawked his secondhand clothes in the Kensington stall, he had met a 19-year old girl named Mary Austin, who managed an upscale boutique called Biba nearby. “It took Freddie nearly six months to finally ask me out!,” she told authors Jacky Gunn and Jim Jenkins in their book “Queen: As It Began.” “I thought he fancied my best friend, so I used to avoid him. One night we were at one of his gigs, and after it had finished he came looking for me. I left him at the bar with my friend to go to the loo, but I actually sneaked out. He was furious!” But soon thereafter, the two hooked up and became extremely close. They moved into an apartment together which they shared with another couple in the Kensington district.\n\nBy 1971, the band was performing at local colleges and clubs, while most of its members still attended school. John Deacon eventually got a degree in science, Brian May picked up one in electronics, and Roger Taylor received one for biology. After being invited to showcase and record their music at a local studio, EMI Records signed the band in late 1972. Freddie and Mary moved into an apartment of their own, a place where the group photographs for their first album were snapped. “Queen” and “Queen II” were released in under two years’ time, and when their third album, “Sheer Heart Attack,” was released in 1974, the group snared a top 20 hit in the U.S. with the single “Killer Queen.”\n\nBut it was with their next album, “A Night At the Opera,” which contained the long, operatic sweep of “Bohemian Rhapsody,” that sent Queen into the stratosphere. As a single, it shot to number one in Britain, Japan, and many other markets, selling over 150,000 copies in the first 2 weeks of its release. From that point on, Queen was bigger than life. Mercury hit his stride on the stage, vamping it up in furs, leathers, and dresses, commanding the attention of huge audiences in tandem with the band’s ever-increasing stock of pyrotechnics, dry ice and lighting. Hit after hit poured from their amps throughout the mid-to-late ‘70s: “You’re My Best Friend,” “Somebody To Love,” “Tie Your Mother Down,” “We Are The Champions,” “We Will Rock You,” “Fat Bottomed Girls,” and their first U.S. number one single at the turn of 1980, “Crazy Little Thing Called Love.”\n\nBy pulling out of an interview on Britain’s “Today” show in 1976, they allowed an unknown band called the Sex Pistols to fill in for them, thus launching those punkers’ rise to instant stardom through that one appearance. Freddie’s costumes onstage changed by the late ‘70s. Gone were the tight dresses and the black nail polish. He started to wear leather gear or uniforms. In 1978, Queen’s Madison Square Garden show in New York featured a gaggle of semi-nude girls riding bicycles around the stage during “Fat Bottomed Girls.” The next year, at the same venue, Mercury strode onto the stage 2 hours’ late, donning an NYPD beat cop’s outfit, and proceeded to pour champagne over the heads of patrons in the front rows. His outrageousness only fueled their adulation. Some of his outrageousness was fueled by drugs. Queen were no strangers to having a wild time behind the scenes, but perhaps the biggest display of excess in their career occurred when they threw a huge party in New Orleans to launch the release of their 1978 album “Jazz.”\n\nFlying in over 80 journalists from around the globe on October 31st, the band entered the ballroom of the Fairmont Hotel at the stroke of midnight surrounded in a parade of strippers, transvestites, grossly-overweight women, snake charmers, and hermaphrodites. The baffled reporters soon relished sights like that of a woman who smoked cigarettes with her genitalia. They lined up in a backroom as one woman on her knees hummed more than just Queen songs. Mercury was his unfazed self, telling Circus magazine, “I’m going backstage for a rest. Maybe get a b*** job. Hell, it’s Halloween, right?” Roger Taylor related the magnitude of the New Orleans event to RIP magazine. “There were 125 strippers. For 10 years afterwards, the cabbies asked, ‘When are you going to have another party?’ You don’t quite see parties like that anymore.”\n\nEven though his career had skyrocketed beyond his wildest dreams and he was adored by fans the world over, Freddie had remained devoted to Mary and lived with her for much of the early part of his rise to fame. But by the late ‘70s, the two didn’t seem to connect intimately. One day, as Mary related to the Daily Mail in 1999, Freddie confessed to her. “He said, ‘I think I’m bisexual.’ I told him, ‘I think you’re gay.’ And nothing else was said. We just hugged. I thought, ‘He’s been very brave.’ Being a bit naïve it had taken me a while to realize the truth. Afterwards, he felt good about having told me. He said, ‘I realized I had a choice. The choice was not to tell you, but I think you are entitled to your own life.” Mary reflected on the aftermath of his confession. “I used to think originally that I’d lost him to being gay. But then if he had been totally heterosexual, I think I would eventually have lost him to another woman, particularly when the fame came along. Women followed him even though they suspected he was gay.”\n\nFreddie still loved Mary as his best friend. He got her a place near his Kensington apartment and gave her the job of company secretary to his music and publishing businesses which he ran from his home. While she had a few boyfriends over the 1980s, and even had two children by one of them, painter Piers Cameron, Mary remained totally devoted to Mercury. Freddie also was a devoted son to his parents. He made sure to take time out of most weeks when he was not on the road, to go visit them at their Feltham home.\n\nAfter the number one success of the band’s 1980 album “The Game” and its follow-up single after “Crazy Little Thing Called Love,” “Another One Bites The Dust,” Queen’s output of hits in the 1980s never cracked the U.S. top ten again. Their music was still snapped up by millions though on their home turf of Britain. The band suffered a setback in popularity when they chose to play 8 gigs at the South African resort of Sun City in 1984. The United Nations put them on a blacklist since they were in violation of breaking its anti-apartheid cultural boycott on the African nation. Brian May told Guitar World magazine, “When we went to South Africa, we made sure our audience were integrated. And then we stipulated that we would have to have freedom of speech. So we were able to do interviews with the South African papers and say what we felt about apartheid, and have our views printed. We got hell when we came back, but I would argue that you achieve more by going places, than by staying away.”\n\nAll was forgiven when Queen was the standout performance the next year at Bob Geldof’s landmark Live Aid event. Geldof said, “It was the perfect stage for Freddie. He could ponce about in front of the whole world.” The date was July 13, 1985. In October of that year, two individuals passed away from an illness that the world was just beginning to learn about. Actor Rock Hudson, once a top screen star of the 1960s, was tragically cut down by the new-buzzword disease, AIDS. His passing was cause for hysteria. The world press launched an all-out campaign to uncover everything they could about Hudson’s secret gay past and scads of misinformation on how the disease could be contracted spread carelessly around the airwaves. Ten days after Hudson died, another death went practically unnoticed. Guitarist Ricky Wilson of the Athens, Georgia band, The B-52s, quietly slipped away, and his passing was not revealed as being AIDS-related until much later.\n\nSince Freddie and Mary had moved into separate quarters, Freddie had a series of boyfriends over the late ‘70s and early ‘80s. By 1984, he had met Jim Hutton, a hairdresser, at a nightclub, and the two became constant companions over the rest of the decade. In 1980, Freddie had purchased an 8-bedroom Victorian mansion set in a quarter acre in the Kensington area. He paid over a half million pounds cash for it. He poured many more pounds into remodeling it. But he was quite comfortable living in his apartment, so the mansion remained empty for six years.\n\nOn August 9, 1986, Queen performed before the largest paying audience in their career, close to 200,000 people, at the Knebworth Festival in England. It was the group’s 658th concert. It was also their last. Freddie Mercury probably knew by this time that he was HIV-positive. Shortly after the event, he finally moved into his mansion and proceeded to live his life, in his own words, ‘like a nun,’ for the rest of the 1980s. He hired Hutton as a ‘gardener’ so it wouldn’t appear to other close friends jealous of the lover that he was being spoiled by Mercury.\n\nFrom this point on, Freddie chose his public appearances sporadically. His very close friend, singer-drummer Dave Clark, originally of the Dave Clark Five, wrote all the music and songs for a musical stage play called “Time” which featured pop singer Cliff Richard. On April 14, 1988, Freddie appeared in the musical for a special charity performance. The proceeds from the show were all donated to the Terrence Higgins Trust for research into AIDS. On October 8, 1988, he hit the stage at an open-air festival in Barcelona, Spain with opera diva Montserrat Caballe to sing their collaborative tune “Barcelona,” which would later be used as the official anthem to the 1992 Olympics. Queen’s album “The Miracle” was released on May 22, 1989. By the start of 1990, with his strength diminishing day by day, Freddie still wanted to record more songs. He still wanted to create. The band went into their Switzerland studio to begin working on tunes that would eventually be released on the January 1991 album, “Innuendo.”\n\nOn February 18, 1990, when Freddie appeared at the annual British Phonographic Industry Awards ceremony, at which Queen were honored with an outstanding contribution to British music award, rumors of ill health were printed in the press the following days. His make-up under the hot TV lights was not enough to distract from the fact that he looked pallid and gaunt. Freddie did his best to dispel rumors of any kind of sickness.\n\nBrian May told Rock Power magazine, “We didn’t know actually what was wrong for a very long time. We never talked about it and it was a sort of unwritten law that we didn’t, because Freddie didn’t want to. He just told us that he didn’t feel up to doing tours, and that’s as far as it went. Gradually, I suppose in the last year and a bit, it became obvious what the problem was, or at least fairly obvious – we still didn’t know for sure. He’s a very private person, Freddie.” Mercury had told his secret to Mary Austin long before any of his friends or family ever knew. She looked after him from that point on, tending to his every need. “I would sit every day next to the bed for 6 hours, whether he was awake or not,” she told the Daily Mail. “He would suddenly wake up and smile and say, ‘Oh, it’s you, old faithful.”\n\nHutton had been there too, but judging from the tone of his subsequent book, “Mercury and Me,” the decline of Mercury was seen more as an imposition on Hutton. He described in harrowing, yet exploitative, detail the daily horrors Mercury suffered from the disease, such as incidents where he lost control of his bladder and his inability to swallow some foods. Hutton, himself, reportedly contracted the AIDS virus.\n\nFreddie pushed to get into the studio in Montreux one last time. In 1991, he and his bandmates took several weeks out to record more songs. Producer David Richards told Rolling Stone magazine, “I knew that he was very ill, amazingly his voice became better and better though. ‘My voice is still here,’ he used to say, ‘So I’ll keep on singing till the end.’ I personally didn’t know that he had AIDS; I speculated he had cancer. I think everyone pushed aside the fact that it was really that serious. Everyone still had that glimpse of hope that at the end maybe a miracle would happen…It was a difficult situation for all of us, but especially for Freddie, but he really wanted this project to be finished, even though he knew that the album would be released after his death.”\n\nBrian May told Rock Power magazine that, a few months before his passing, Mercury did “sit down and talk to us about it, and from that point on it was openly talked about among us. But we still didn’t mention a word to anyone, not even our families, which is very difficult. When your friends look you in the eye and say, ‘What’s wrong?,’ and you say, ‘Nothing,’ it’s very hard. So it was a big strain; it did something awful to our brains for awhile.”\n\nFreddie got so sick that he struggled to do a half-hour’s worth of singing over a week’s time. Then it became a half-hour’s work over a couple weeks. Brian told RIP magazine, “Then, at the very end, he couldn’t move. You feel so helpless watching someone so fit and strong and healthy and creative be destroyed by that horrible thing…He never succumbed in spirit. He was always up. He always had his sense of humor, which I find incredible. He was the first to say, ‘Hey, I don’t want you guys to sit around. This may be happening to me, but you have your lives to lead.” When Brian played Mercury one of his upcoming solo singles, “Driven By You,” he felt guilty putting out such an upbeat tune while Freddie was fading away. “He said, ‘Why should you do anything else?’ And he said, ‘If I pop off while it’s happening, it’ll give you an extra bit of publicity.’ That is Fred,” Brian related, laughing softly.\n\nAs autumn 1991 blew across England, Mercury was on his last legs. The tawdry rag, the Sun newspaper, owned by tasteless tycoon Rupert Murdoch, published a photograph a paparazzi member had taken of an ailing Freddie through a telephoto lens into Mercury’s mansion bedroom. Drummer Roger Taylor, a few years later, was so incensed by this incident, that he included a heated diatribe song against the morally-questionable billionaire in a solo song he released called, “Dear Mr. Murdoch.” “I thought it was a gross intrusion on my friend’s privacy,” Taylor told West End magazine. “I felt outraged that his house was surrounded by these vultures when he was basically trying to die in peace.”\n\nFreddie’s demise was especially excruciating to his closest friend, Mary Austin. “He was always very protective of me,” she told the Daily Mail. “If something happened, he’d say, ‘Oh darling, don’t worry, we’ll get over that.’ He was uplifting. At other times, when he was aware he had AIDS and only had a limited time to live, there’d be the odd serious conversation when he’d say to me, ‘Let’s go and sit, we don’t know how long we have.’\n\nMercury’s final moments grew nearer. Mary continued, “The quality of his life had changed so dramatically, and he was in more and more pain everyday. He was losing his sight. His body became weaker as he suffered mild fits. It was so devastating to see him deteriorating in this way. One day he decided enough was enough and stopped all the medical supplements that were keeping him going. He just turned off. The overwhelming thing for me was that he was just so incredibly brave. He looked death in the face and said, ‘Fine, I’ll accept it now – I’ll go.”\n\nBefore he left us, Mercury did something that no other public persona had done before. He announced to the world that he had AIDS. Before 1991, no celebrity wished the public to know of their misfortune, choosing instead to be silent to the very end. To Freddie though, this would mean there was shame attached to his passing. He did not see it that way. He wanted people to know that this disease was not something to be hushed up. It should be discussed openly, for it affects not just individuals who are oriented in homosexual lifestyle, but everyone. His announcement of his illness on November 23, 1991, exemplified the dignity and character of a man whose final gesture was of caring, one of shedding light on that which was unmentionable.\n\nThe next day, November 24th, around 7:00 in the evening, Freddie Mercury passed away. His friends, including Dave Clark, were by his side. Mary said, “It was peaceful and he died with a smile on his face.” His Queen bandmates issued the following statement: “We have lost the greatest and most beloved member of our family. We feel overwhelming grief that he has gone, sadness that he should be cut down at the height of his creativity, but above all, great pride in the courageous way he lived and died. It has been a privilege for us to have shared such magical times. As soon as we are able we would like to celebrate his life in the style to which he was accustomed.”\n\nA single red rose rested atop his coffin as it was driven to the crematorium. A Zoroastrian service was held to send him on his way. In December 1991, “Bohemian Rhapsody” once again entered the U.K. charts and shot to number one. It was the only time in British music history that any single has gone to number one twice.\n\nAs for Queen’s celebration of Mercury’s life, they, indeed, took to the stage on April 20, 1992, in a ‘Concert For Life,’ a tribute to Freddie and a fundraising effort for AIDS awareness, before a crowd of 70,000 fans at London’s Wembley Stadium. Broadcast to 70 countries around the globe and with the musical talents of David Bowie, Elton John, George Michael, Guns N’ Roses, and many more, the event helped to launch the Phoenix Trust, an AIDS foundation set up in Switzerland, and to which Mary became a trustee. Queen released some of the final tracks, which Freddie had summoned strength to perform on, on a 1995 CD entitled “Made In Heaven.”\n\nFreddie’s will left almost 50% of his wealth to Mary Austin. She moved into his Kensington mansion. His parents and sister received 25% each. He left Jim Hutton 500,000 pounds and bought him a plot of land in his native Ireland on which to build a home. As for his remains, Freddie entrusted his ashes to Mary. Only she knows where they are hidden. Freddie made her promise she would not reveal their whereabouts. “I had to do it alone as he asked and keep it a secret,” she told the Daily Mail. “That was something that didn’t encourage his family to like me anymore or any less than they did.”\n\nBrian May wrote a piece about Freddie for the band’s fan club magazine a month after Mercury’s passing, just before Christmas. “Freddie never wanted sympathy, he wanted exactly what the fans gave him – belief, support and the endorsement of that strangely winding road to excellence that we, Queen, have tried to follow. You gave him support in being the outstandingly free spirit that he was, and is. Freddie, his music, his dazzling creative energy – those are for ever.” The show must go on.\n\n© 2000 Ned Truslow\n\nFebruary 1995: The Mysterious Disappearances of Taylor Kramer and Richey James\n\nVanished. That’s what newspaper articles in Great Britain and the United States claimed during the month of February 1995. Except that the reports were about two very different men. Both men had simply disappeared. One slipped away on February 1st. The other was gone on February 12th. One was a rising rock star, the other had moved on in life, shedding his rock stature. With hardly a trace of evidence, the existence of these two men were wiped clean from the everyday lives they led with their loved ones. For one, the warnings of distress and despondency had been quite evident over the years. For the other, life seemed promising and potentially groundbreaking. Neither man had ever met the other. Their worlds and their goals were completely divergent. The only link they had to one another was that they were two musicians, and they had simply vanished during a winter month in 1995. Eventually one’s disappearance would be solved. As for the other…\n\nOne of these men was Phillip Taylor Kramer. As a curious 12-year old, Kramer enjoyed listening to rock records, and like a lot of kids in the ‘60s, he was fascinated with the burgeoning modern music scene of the day. At 12, he also won a science fair at his school in Youngstown, Ohio by building a laser whose beam could pop a balloon. Young Kramer would soon become a very bright rocker.\n\nWhen Kramer turned 14, a group of musicians formed a band in the Los Angeles area and played the rock clubs along the Sunset Strip. The group was named Iron Butterfly, and within two years, they had signed with Atco Records and released a debut album called “Heavy.” They shared the bill in concerts with high-profile acts like The Doors and Jefferson Airplane. In 1968, keyboardist Doug Ingle would write the band’s signature song “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.” The song hit number 4 on the U.S. charts and solidified the band’s reputation as a genuine founding father of the heavy metal movement. By May 1971 though, the band had split apart and the future of the Butterfly seemed extinguished.\n\nBut after the release of a “Best Of…” album in 1975, guitarist Erik Braunn and drummer Ronald Bushy decided to reform the group. Taylor Kramer, now living in the LA area, trying to find a playing gig, was hired by the band to be their new bassist. The band signed with MCA Records and immediately recorded a new album called “Scorching Beauty.” Soon after, Iron Butterfly hit the tour circuit with Robin Trower and Humble Pie.\n\nWhile on the road, Kramer became fast friends with drummer Bushy. They would spend long hours writing songs together. Kramer would also try to enlighten his bandmate with scientific ideas and equations he had been formulating. On a piece of stationary from a motel in Aberdeen, Washington, he wrote, “There is only so much a human being can achieve within his physical boundaries, but I wish to reach beyond my physical being.” He took great pains to define God as the total energy unit made up of all levels of energy. He tried to explain to Bushy his theories of the very definition of the universe as being mathematically configured.\n\nThe band released another album called “Sun and Steel,” but then, without any true chart-topping hit, the group dissolved once again. Kramer went on to study at Western States College of Engineering and graduated in 1980. He subsequently worked for the Northrop Electronics Corporation and helped develop the guidance system for the MX nuclear missile.\n\nHaving been laid off from Northrop in the mid-‘80s, Kramer set out to start a company of his own. Through his music connections, he hooked up initially with singer Michael Jackson’s brother Randy and together, with a few other founders, they formed a video compression firm called Total Multimedia (TMM) in Thousand Oaks, California, a suburb on the outskirts of Los Angeles. Taylor brought his father, Ray Kramer, a retired professor of electrical engineering, into the fold, and they started the business of storing visual images, through the company’s practice known as fractal compression, onto CD-ROM discs. Ray and Taylor also had another agenda as well.\n\nRay had passed along his notions of understanding the universe through mathematical equations to his son Taylor. With the help of TMM’s high-end computers, they set about to put some of Ray’s theories to the test. But by 1994, the company had encountered serious financial troubles, and the investors demanded reorganization to stave off imminent bankruptcy filings. This led to internal fighting, and Taylor felt that the original vision he had had for the company was now being tainted by greed.\n\nRay’s passion for a scientific breakthrough became Taylor’s as well. Taylor spent insomnia-draining weeks running mathematical equations on his laptop in the middle of the night. The essence of their quest centered around the ability to transmit waves faster than the speed of light. This breakthrough would mean that communication would occur through gravity waves anywhere within the universe in one second. Electromagnetism and gravitation would effectively be harnessed and become malleable. In January 1995, Taylor felt elated, for he concluded, after months of sleepless nights, that he had come up with all the answers. He dubbed the discovery, in honor of his father, as “Ray’s Moment.”\n\nOne of TMM’s main investors was a man named Greg Martini who lived in the Cincinnati area. On Sunday, February 12, 1995, Greg was slated to fly into Los Angeles International Airport with his wife on a business trip to check up on TMM. Taylor was going to meet them at the gate, drive them the hour and half ride out to Thousand Oaks, where they would pick up Taylor’s wife, Jennifer. Then the foursome had plans to head north to Santa Barbara for a quiet dinner and conversation. On this weekend morning, along roads that were not traffic-clogged with the usual Los Angeles weekday bustle, Taylor Kramer…simply vanished.\n\nIn the days leading up to his disappearance, Kramer appeared exhausted yet in an euphoric state. His sister told the Los Angeles Times, “He was so excited, that he was calling the math ‘sacred.’ I worried that he was having visions. My brother takes the weight of the world upon himself. He loves Jennifer, he loves his kids dearly. But he banked everything on this discovery with my dad, and his mind just ran away with it. He talked of supernovas, earthquakes, all events having no coincidences. I fear he had some kind of breakdown.”\n\nJennifer had tried to find out more about Taylor’s discovery a week before the 12th, and he had described its benefits as follows: “Imagine being able to flash up a picture of a missing child on this computer screen, or even a part of a picture, and with this new equation, being able to find that child in a fraction of a second.” She didn’t seem to register just how someone could accomplish such a feat. Ray Kramer surmised that his son might have vanished so that they would put his equation to use in finding him.\n\nAs a strategy point in dealing with Martini on the morning of the 12th, Kramer had told Jennifer, “At some point, I’ll need an hour alone with Greg.” She said that he shouldn’t exclude her from the conversations with Martini. Taylor left his Thousand Oaks home that Sunday morning around 9:00am. He stopped at the Los Robles Medical Center to visit Jennifer’s father, who was interned for cancer treatment. Climbing back into his green 1993 Ford Aerostar van, he headed to the airport. According to parking records, he spent 45 minutes either within the parking structure or in the Delta terminal at LAX. When he left, he did not have enough money to pay the parking attendant the three dollars owed. He also did not have Greg Martini and his wife in the van.\n\nCoincidentally, Taylor’s old drummer friend, Ronald Bushy, was departing at the Delta terminal that morning, yet he never spotted his Iron Butterfly bandmate. Greg Martini never saw Kramer that morning either. Around this time, Kramer made some calls on his cellular phone. He reached Jennifer and said that, should Martini phone the house, to tell him to take a cab to a Hyatt Hotel in Westlake Village, a community next to Thousand Oaks. Kramer told her he’d meet everyone there at 2:00pm “with the biggest surprise for you.” He called his friend Bushy, who was at the airport, and said that he loved him more than life itself. Kramer then rang his wife back and said, “Whatever happens, I’ll always be with you.”\n\nAt 11:59am, Taylor Kramer dialed 911 on his cellular phone, as later pinpointed as originating from somewhere along the Ventura Freeway in the San Fernando Valley, and said, “This is Phillip Taylor Kramer, and I am going to kill myself.”\n\nThe police, alerted by the 911 call, got in touch with Jennifer. Family members and friends immediately contacted one another. A sheriff’s helicopter was dispatched to search the mountains around Santa Monica and the Pacific Coast Highway, as well as along the San Fernando Valley. At age 42, the amiable, extremely upbeat Kramer was nowhere to be found.\n\nWhen the initial search for Kramer came up blank by the authorities, Jennifer and the members of TMM began to pool their resources for an independent investigation of their own. Hundreds of flyers were distributed throughout Ventura and Los Angeles Counties. Citizens began phoning her with alleged sightings. Kramer had supposedly been sighted at a school bus stop on Mulholland Drive. He was described as being seen at a market in the Valley’s Canoga Park. A pawn shop owner talked about computers with a man fitting Kramer’s description. He was allegedly seen outside a Burger King, at a soup kitchen, and at the Santa Monica Pier.\n\nJennifer received a phone call shortly thereafter from someone who sounded befuddled, whom she thought was her husband on the line. A few private investigators were hired to track leads and solve the case. One investigator told the LA Times, “Something happened during that time, either in his head or at the terminal, that made him turn away. And I’ll tell you, I haven’t a clue. The guy didn’t have an enemy. The guy was a dedicated family man. I checked him out. Whatever happened in his head while at the airport, or whatever happened right in the airport, I’ve got a feeling we’ll learn from Kramer himself.” Family members and police officials believed Kramer was still alive somewhere, perhaps in trouble.\n\nOne Ohio congressman felt that since Kramer had reportedly made an important discovery, as well as having worked on the MX missile, the FBI should be compelled to investigate the matter. Family members long argued that his disappearance may have been linked to his work. Months went by, without any trace of clues, no notes, no contact. In November 1995, NBC aired a segment about Kramer on its “Unsolved Mysteries” television program. Jennifer appeared on “The Phil Donahue Show” to appeal to a broad audience, and the family set up a web page detailing the events surrounding Kramer’s disappearance. Taylor’s mother held the strong belief that Kramer had been kidnapped.\n\nFor months and eventually years, the family did not give up hope. No physical clues, no money transactions, no notes were ever left behind to suggest Taylor had been contemplating suicide. Jennifer said to the LA Times in 1996, “I went to a psychologist for the first time in my life. She told me to assume Taylor’s gone and get on with my life. Well, that’s not to be. Taylor’s one in a million. We have to keep searching. But I do have a mortgage and kids and insurance, and so I’ve got to get working.”\n\nWalter Lockwood liked to take photographs. As a Hollywood resident, he would venture into the nearby mountains to click shots of unusual artifacts set amongst natural settings. Walter and a friend hiked down a steep cliff embankment one afternoon to snap some shots. The date was May 29, 1999. The location was off a winding two-lane street called Decker Canyon Road that traced its way from the beach community of Malibu to the upscale Valley environs of Westlake Village. The duo took pictures of abandoned cars that had settled 450 feet down the canyon wall from the road above. Sitting amongst the handful of cars was a green Ford Aerostar van. The front end and windshield were smashed. When they peered inside, they saw skeletal human bones by the front seat. Walking away from the site to call authorities, Lockwood stepped on a human skull near the van. He and his friend dashed out of the canyon.\n\nOn Sunday morning, May 30th, a sheriff’s department helicopter hoisted a green body bag with the remains into the sky. Dental records matched the teeth found in the skull. After four long years of hope, curiosity, and confusion, the disappearance of the Iron Butterfly bassist was solved. Phillip Taylor Kramer had driven off a cliff.\n\nHis beloved company had shut down by the end of the ‘90s. He had left his family with tens of thousands of dollars in debt from money he had borrowed from friends. And yet, no one can truly explain what went wrong. Why did Kramer so suddenly feel compelled to end his life?\n\nThe mystery surrounding his disappearance spawned many rumors of conspiracies and foul play. What ultimately led to his final resting place in that canyon? Was it an act of despondency, one in which he snapped and felt that he could never wrestle his way out of the debt he owed? Or is there a clue in his remark to Jennifer in which he was supposedly going to meet her at 2:00pm on February 12, 1995 with the “biggest surprise?” Did he, in the end, feel that he could transcend death itself and flash through time? Did he think he could cheat his demise by appearing at the hotel for a surprise confirmation of his theories? Of course, no one will know for sure. In the end, his friend, Iron Butterfly’s Ronald Bushy may have summed up the ultimate tribute to his colleague, when he told the LA Times in 1995, “To Kramer, there was no problem that could not be met.” Perhaps, somewhere in the veiled world of an afterlife, Kramer is working on that problem at this very moment.\n\n————————————————————-\n\nBy the time Phillip Taylor Kramer drove off to the unknown on February 12, 1995, another man, also a musician, had been missing since the beginning of that month. His name was Richard James Edwards, known as Richey James, and he was the lead singer for the band Manic Street Preachers.\n\nHailing from the working class town of Blackwood in Wales, Richey was also a bright rocker, perhaps not scientifically, but certainly philosophically. The mining community from which he hailed molded him into an independent-thinking, anti-authoritarian, punker, one who looked upon his life and the world around him with bleak, nihilistic eyes. As with the majority of Welsh towns, existence consisted of hard work and few opportunities. Those individuals that broke from that lifestyle, people like Welsh natives Richard Burton and Catherine Zeta-Jones, did so by cracking the odds. As Richey himself once said, “Where we come from, there is a natural melancholy in the air. Everybody, ever since you could comprehend it, felt pretty much defeated.”\n\nRichey wound up going to the University of Wales, Swansea College, where he hooked up with childhood chums who were interested in music. The Sex Pistols had made their beachhead a decade earlier in 1976, and James Bradfield, along with his cousin Sean Moore, decided to form a group in honor of that once radical punk spirit. Calling themselves Blue Generation, the band played hardcore songs that evoked a raw, garage sound. Nicky Wire, a bass player who was studying political history along with Richey at the university, soon joined the group and contributed rebellious lyrics to the band’s increasing song catalog. Meanwhile, Richey, who drove the van for the group, which segued into the name Betty Blue, had begun a liter-of-vodka-a-day habit which would carry him through, well into the ‘90s.
