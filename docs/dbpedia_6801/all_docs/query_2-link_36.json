The sessions were recorded at the Who's Ramport Studios during the winter of 1976[2] (vocals were recorded at Pathe Marconi Studios in Paris, due to tax complications), and Daltrey allowed students from the local Battersea technical school to film them as an educational project. This also marked the first time that Daltrey had written or co-written a song since \"Here for More\" (released as the B-side of the Who's \"The Seeker\") in 1970, and Lisztomania in 1975.[3] Daltrey's original choice for producers were Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, but they declined.\n\nWhen Leo Sayer launched his own career as a singer, Daltrey called on a widening group of friends to write for and perform on his (Daltrey's) albums. Paul McCartney contributed the new song \"Giddy\" to One of the Boys, where the band included Hank B. Marvin of the Shadows, Eric Clapton, Alvin Lee and Mick Ronson, as well as calling on a member of the Who, John Entwistle.\n\nOn this cover, after releasing Ride a Rock Horse with Daltrey as a rampant centaur, another visual trick is played with Daltrey's mirror image, with reference to Magritte's famous painting Not to Be Reproduced, photographed and designed by Daltrey's cousin Graham Hughes.\n\n\"Parade\" is a cover song originally released on Phillip Goodhand-Tait's sixth solo album, Teaching an Old Dog New Tricks, in 1976.\n\n\"Single Man's Dilemma\" was written by Colin Blunstone for Daltrey. Blunstone is the lead vocalist for The Zombies.\n\n\"Avenging Annie\" is a cover song originally released on Andy Pratt's second solo album, Andy Pratt, in 1973. The song was released as a single (by Daltrey) in October 1977, reaching No. 88 in the US, but was not released in the UK.\n\n\"Leon\" was written and recorded by Phillip Goodhand-Tait in 1972 and originally released on his third album Songfall. The song was released as a single (by Daltrey) in April 1978 but did not chart and was not released in the UK.\n\n\"One of the Boys\" was written by Steve Gibbons about Daltrey. Gibbons did his own version live in 1977; a recording was released on his live album, Caught in the Act. The song was released as a single (by Daltrey) in June 1977 but did not chart; the song was not released in the US.\n\n\"Giddy\" was written by the Beatles' Paul McCartney for Daltrey, The song started off as a demo called \"Rode All Night\"; the refrain was later incorporated into \"Giddy\".[4]\n\n\"Written on the Wind\" was written by Paul Korda for Daltrey. The song features Korda playing piano; it was released as a single in April 1977, reaching No. 46 in the UK, but was not released in the US.\n\n\"Say It Ain't So, Joe\" is a cover of song originally released on Murray Head's second solo album, Say It Ain't So, in 1975. The song was released as a single (by Daltrey) in July 1977 but did not chart; it was not released in the UK. The song was rereleased in February 1978 with a different B-side.\n\nProfessional ratingsReview scoresSourceRatingAllMusic[5]MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide[1]Rolling Stone(favourable)[6]\n\nWriting for AllMusic, critic William Ruhlmann said that \"Roger Daltrey called on a wider circle of friends for his third album and came up with a more varied collection of songs ... But Daltrey was never in danger of getting lost in the all-star session. Nevertheless, the album was not treated as a major release and found only modest commercial success.\"\n\nRoger Daltrey - lead vocals, harmonica\n\nAlvin Lee - guitar\n\nJimmy McCulloch - guitar\n\nPaul Keogh - guitar\n\nHank B.
