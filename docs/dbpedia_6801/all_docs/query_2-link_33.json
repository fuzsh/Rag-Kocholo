        "text": "The Who vocalist Roger Daltrey at a remote seaside locale in Connecticut, circa 1978.\n\n\"Slowly, he walked down toward the water. Since he was fully clothed, I thought he'd stop at the shoreline, but he kept walking. I followed, holding the cameras over my head. Once his mouth was covered with water I said, 'It's OK to shoot now, right?' He had no time to answer.\" - Lynn Goldsmith\n\nRelease Note:\n\nLynn Goldsmith photographs are released in one edition of only 20 pieces total.\n\nShe offers that edition on a per piece basis, in an assortment of sizes ranging from 11\" x 14\" to 40\" x 60\" (and larger if requested).\n\nEach museum-quality, limited edition photograph is produced to order at Lynn's studio in Tennessee and is hand-signed and numbered.
