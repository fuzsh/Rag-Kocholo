        "text": "After a brief dalliance with leading-man status in the 1980s, Charles Dance built a career of playing highborn heels with a distinctive capacity to menace more heroic types with a suave, icy indifference. The English-born Dance honed his skills with the Royal Shakespeare Company before scoring his breakthrough screen role in the epic miniseries \"The Jewel in the Crown\" (ITV/PBS, 1984). Able to mix dashing and savoir faire with layered vulnerability, he landed a flurry of above-title bills in award-bait dramas such as \"Plenty\" (1985), \"White Mischief\" (1987) and \"Pascali's Island\" (1988). As of his turn in \"The Golden Child\" (1986), however, he developed a niche playing frosty yet textured villains in big-ticket projects such as \"Last Action Hero\" (1993), \"Michael Collins\" (1996) and the miniseries \"Bleak House\" (BBC, 2005), as well as lighter fare a la \"Ali G Indahouse\" (2002) and \"Terry Pratchett's Going Postal\" (Sky1, 2010). The early 2000s saw him increasingly bringing his arch-villainy to highbrow television projects such as the drama series \"Trinity\" (Channel 4, 2009), the international intrigue series \"Strike Back\" (Sky1/Cinemax, 2010-15) and, to much fanfare, HBO's fantasy phenomenon \"Game of Thrones\" (2011- ). Though he proved himself adept at many character types across stage and screen, Dance showed time and again that few could play the bad guy with such devilish aplomb."
