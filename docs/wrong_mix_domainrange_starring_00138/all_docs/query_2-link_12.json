        "text": "Episode 1\n\nJeremy Clarkson and James May race a car against a high-performance yacht in a nail-biting battle up the beautiful coastline of New Zealand to the very tip of the North Island. Meanwhile, back in the UK, Richard Hammond attempts to find a hot hatch hero from a trio of newcomers, the Renaultsport Clio 200, Peugeot 208 GTI and Ford Fiesta ST, and top stars including Warwick Davis, Charles Dance and Joss Stone assemble at the track to welcome a brand new Reasonably Priced Car.\n\nThe Witchfinder\n\nDetermined to wipe out magic in Camelot forever, Uther summons Aredian, the most dreaded witchfinder in the land. Merlin needs Gaius to remind him of the danger he faces, but Morgana is certain Aredian will see straight through her and sheâll be burnt at the stake. Can Merlin protect Morgana and Gaius without ending up in the flames himself?\n\nThe White Feather\n\nThe arrest of a young girl on a sabotage charge brings Foyle into contact with a group of English Nazi sympathizers. Shots are fired at the group's charismatic leader, but it is the hotel owner who dies. Foyle investigates the murder and uncovers a plot to smuggle a vitally important letter to the enemy.\n\nClose Quarters\n\nTensions grow within the close confines of the ship. The safety of the increasingly dilapidated hulk is by no means assured and the situation is worsened when the foremast is damaged.\n\nSuspicion\n\nA severed female hand is found in the outreaches of Thames, which brings RÃ³isÃ­n into contact with her first boss Mike, who is now back in uniform after being found innocent at his murder trial."
