        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n28 Mar 2023, 09:50\n\nCredit: Getty\n\nLegendary actor Charles Dance has revealed that he considered trying out for the role of 007 back in the 1980s, but was talked out of it.\n\nThe actor, who stars in new Paramount+ series Rabbit Hole, thought about auditioning to play James Bond when Roger Moore hung up his tuxedo after 1985’s A View To A Kill and, in a new interview with The Guardian, addressed rumours that he had actually turned the role down. “No, of course I didn’t turn down James Bond!” he explained.\n\nIn fact, his agent persuaded him not to throw his hat in the ring. “What happened was, my agent called and said: ‘I urge you not to do it. Just think how you’ll feel if you don’t get it. It will kill your career stone-dead.’”\n\nHe added: “She was probably right. If I’d got it, I would have probably f****d it up.”\n\nTimothy Dalton ended up taking over from Moore, and starred in two instalments, The Living Daylights and Licence to Kill, before Pierce Brosnan was Bond for four films, and then made way for Daniel Craig.\n\nIt is not yet known who is replacing Craig in the next movie, although Luther star Idris Elba recently ruled himself out and Taron Egerton also said: “I don't think I'm the right choice for it.\"\n\nKick-Ass star Aaron Taylor-Johnson is apparently a favourite to be the next Bond, while This Country’s Daisy May Cooper is reportedly ‘in talks’ to play M.\n\nWhilst Charles Dance was never Bond, he did appear in one of the films, in fact making his feature film debut in 1981’s For Your Eyes Only, where he played a henchman called Claus.\n\nThe Game Of Thrones actor joined the Chris Evans Breakfast Show with cinch yesterday (27th March) to talk about starring alongside Kiefer Sutherland in new show Rabbit Hole. “It's an espionage thriller that you really have to concentrate on because nothing is what it seems,” he told Chris.\n\nDance plays ex-CIA operative Dr Ben Wilson, who is living with the trauma of being part of such an organisation and has been left with debilitating paranoia. However, he is willing to risk everything to get what he wants, no matter who gets hurt along the way. He said: “You can't trust any of the characters. I mean, I tell a monstrous lie and there are lots of other little lies. But it's one of the most exciting things that I've ever done.”"
