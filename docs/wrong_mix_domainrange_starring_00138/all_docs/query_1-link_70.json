        "text": "New ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office tells the tale of one of Britain’s greatest miscarriages of justice and features a stellar cast.\n\nThe star-studded cast line-up is led by BAFTA-winning actor Toby Jones (The Long Shadow) as Alan Bates, the wronged sub-postmaster who took the government to court. The series explores the formation of the Justice for Sub-postmasters Alliance, which aimed to expose the Post Office’s failures.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about the Mr Bates vs the Post Office cast.\n\nToby Jones is Alan Bates, former sub-postmaster and fighter for justice\n\nEnglish actor Toby Jones plays Alan Bates – a former sub-postmaster who helped form the Justice for Sub-postmasters Alliance. Alan reported problems with software while still working as a postmaster, but his concerns were ignored.\n\nToby Jones, 57, needs no introduction. A well-known face in British TV, film and theatre – his credits are long and prestigious.\n\nMost recently, Toby can be found as DCS Dennis Hoban in Yorkshire Ripper drama The Long Shadow (2023). The Detective Chief Superintendent was among the first to link the murders to a serial killer, eventually leading the investigation.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2017, Toby played the role of Lance in Detectorists – which won him a BAFTA in 2018. He’d previously been nominated for playing Alfred Hitchcock in The Girl (2012) and Neil Baldwin in Marvellous (2015).\n\nOther television roles include Sherlock (2017), The Witness for the Prosecution (2016), The Secret Agent (2016), Wayward Pines (2015-2016), Titanic (2012), Doctor Who (2010), Victoria & Albert (2001), Midsomer Murders (1999-2000) and Out of Hours (1998).\n\nHe played Marvel supervillain Arnim Zola in Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) and Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014). He reprised the role for Agent Carter (2015) and Disney+ anthology series What If…? (2021). His other blockbuster roles include Claudius Smith in The Hunger Games (2012-2013), Mr. Eversoll in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018), and Basil Shaw in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023).\n\nOther acclaimed performances include Truman Capote in Infamous (2006), lawyer Irving “Swifty” Lazar in Frost/Nixon (2008) and Gilderoy in Berberian Sound Studio (2012).\n\nHe also played Waddington in The Painted Veil (2006) and Percy in Cold War drama Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011). He portrayed Captain Mainwaring in the Dad’s Army (2016) reboot.\n\nToby’s also provided his services as a voice actor to some prominent characters. Most notably, he voiced house-elf Dobby in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002), as well as sequel Deathly Hallow Part 1 (2010).\n\nHe received an OBE in the 2021 New Year Honours for services to drama.\n\nMonica Dolan is Jo Hamilton, the sub-postmaster at South Warnborough\n\nFellow BAFTA-winner Monica Dolan portrays Jo Hamilton, another subpostmaster who is blamed during the Post Office Scandal.\n\nMonica has something of a habit of popping up in TV dramatisations of scandals.

Anne was the wife of John Darwin, who faked his own death in 2002.\n\nShe also starred in A Very English Scandal (2018), for which she was nominated for a BAFTA.\n\nIt wasn’t her first BAFTA nod.

She’s best known for her role as Hayley Cropper on the soap, which she played from 1998 to 2014. Hayley made history as the first transgender character in British soap, and her character’s storylines revolved around her identity and rights, her relationship with partner Roy Cropper, and their desire to have kids. Hayley passed away in 2014 in a heartbreaking “right to die” storyline, which earned Julie a National Television Award as well as three British Soap Awards.\n\nAn ally to the LGBTQ+ community, Julie also starred in Russell T. Davies‘ dramas Cucumber and Banana in 2015.\n\nIn 2016, Julie appeared in season two of Happy Valley as Amanda Wadsworth, Detective Sergeant John Wadsworth’s estranged wife.
