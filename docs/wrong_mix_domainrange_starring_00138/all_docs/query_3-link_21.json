        "text": "Charles Dance has given a brutally honest assessment of his latest film Godzilla: King of the Monsters (in cinemas now) in a hilarious and frank new interview with Guardian.\n\n“I had difficulty staying awake,” the veteran thesp told the broadsheet when asked about his response to seeing the epic blockbuster, before quickly adding: “No, I didn’t say that! I mean, it’s spectacular.”\n\nDance plays Alan Jonah, a former army Colonel turned environment terrorist, in the sequel to Gareth Edwards’ 2014 Godzilla. He doesn’t get a huge amount of screen time leading some reviewers to theorise that some of his performance ended up on the cutting room floor.\n\n“I keep hearing that! ‘I wish there was more of you.’ It’s what was offered. I just like working. Unless it’s complete and utter crap. I’ve got some pride,” Dance said about his lack of screen time.\n\n“The catering was sensational,” he adds.\n\nThe 72-year-old actor is not someone who minces his words. On the same press tour, the former Game of Thrones star admitted he’d been confused by the final episode of HBO’s hit fantasy drama.\n\nRead more: How Godzilla will fight Kong\n\n“I have watched as much as I can because there are characters like Daenerys, her character, my character, we never met at all, so we would only meet at press junkets and things,” Dance said on GMB. “I wanted to know what was happening to these people...”\n\n“I saw the last series. It got to the very end and I thought, ‘Hmm, okay.’\n\n“There’s little Arya, she’s going off on a cruise somewhere. Jon’s gone back up North to be on the Wall.\n\n“Then there’s Tyrion... and all the people left alive are sat around the table. So well, what are we going to do now, shall we have a cup of tea or something? I thought, ‘I don’t know.’”\n\nElsewhere in the Guardian interview, the actor revealed he’d turned down the opportunity to audition for James Bond in 1986, while appearing in ITV’s The Jewel In The Crown.\n\n“I think I’d have f***ed it up. It might’ve gone to my head a bit. When Jewel happened, you couldn’t open a paper without reading about me. I was ‘the thinking woman’s crumpet’. But Bond would’ve been much bigger. I might’ve blown it.”\n\nGodzilla: King of the Monsters is in cinemas now."
