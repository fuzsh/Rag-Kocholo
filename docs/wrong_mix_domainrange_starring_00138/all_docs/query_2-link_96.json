        "text": "Well, this is weird. Charles Dance – as in, Tywin Lannister, as in Benedict from Last Action Hero, as in Britain’s most eloquent-yet-sinister anti-hero – has confirmed Inverse's report that he will be starring in the upcoming Ghostbusters reboot. Only not as a villain.\n\n“He’s neither really,” revealed Dance after being asked by the Radio Times whether his character is a goodie or baddie. “He’s not villainous, but he just doesn’t understand and appreciate the whole Ghostbusting thing. He is English as well.”\n\nThe film famously leaves behind Egon, Pete, Ray and Winston, introducing a fresh, entirely-female ensemble of leads in their stead. Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones make up the new spook-spoiling crew. “I’m a kind of straight man to a bunch of very funny ladies,” says Dance of his cast-mates.\n\nWhile the universally adored Harold Ramis sadly died in 2014, the other three original ‘busters are set to make cameos in the film. Sigourney Weaver and Annie Potts are also expected back, with Ozzy Osbourne in line for a brief part too.\n\nDirected by Paul Feig and starring Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones, Ghostbusters opens in the US on July 15, 2016, with a UK release date yet to be confirmed."
