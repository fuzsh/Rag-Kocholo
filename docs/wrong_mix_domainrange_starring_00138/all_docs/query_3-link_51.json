In 2017, Charles appeared on the U.K. television series \"Who Do You Think You Are?\" and discovered that his father had been in his seventies at the time of his death, not his early fifties like Dance had believed, and that Walter's first marriage had produced two daughters, Norah and Mary, who both passed away before Charles found out about them. Norah died in her mid-nineties in 1993, and Mary died at age five in 1908 after a tragic accident. Dance attended Widey Technical School for Boys, Plymouth College of Art, and the Leicester College of Arts, and he studied photography and graphic design.\n\nCareer\n\nDance joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in the mid-1970s and appeared in several of their London and Stratford-upon-Avon productions.
