Whether he was scolding his grown children or secretly commanding the kingdom as the Hand of his grandson King, Tywin was always good for a dose of reality. So, it makes sense that in the real world, Dance would be the guy to give a realistic view of the recent ‘Thrones’ finale.\n\nSpeaking to Good Morning Britain, Dance was obviously asked about his thoughts on the recent finale of “Game of Thrones,” which was infamously written and directed by the show’s creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss.\n\nREAD MORE: Gwendoline Christie Predicted The ‘Game of Thrones’ Ending\n\n“I was confused,” said Dance, slightly grimacing.\n\nHe goes on to say that he was really interested in seeing where the story of “Game of Thrones” went because he only got to experience a portion of the plot, due to his character being so far removed from many of the other stories. So, he, like many fans, watched with anticipation to see how Benioff and Weiss would wrap everything up.\n\nAnd we can safely say that Dance speaks for many of us when he answered about his thoughts on the final episode — confused and underwhelmed.\n\nREAD MORE: HBO Boss Says Benioff & Weiss Did “A Spectacular Job” On The ‘Thrones’ Finale & Shoots Down An Arya Spin-Off\n\n“[I] got to the very end and I thought, ‘Hmmm, okay…’” said the actor. “There’s little Arya, she’s going off on a cruise somewhere. Poor Jon, going back up north beyond the wall. And then there’s Tyrion. And all the people left alive are saying, ‘What do we do now? Should we have a cup of tea?’ And I thought, ‘Ahhh, I don’t know.’”"
