        "text": "(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nCharles Dance has cleared up a longstanding rumor that he turned down the chance to play James Bond.\n\nIn a new interview with The Guardian, the enduringly popular actor explained that actually, he chose not to audition for the iconic role out of fear of being rejected.\n\n\"No, of course I didn’t turn down James Bond!\" Dance told the publication. \"What happened was, my agent called and said: 'I urge you not to do it. Just think how you’ll feel if you don’t get it. It will kill your career stone-dead.'\"\n\nDance also said that he agreed with his agent's advice, adding: \"She was probably right. If I'd got it, I would have probably f**ked it up.\"\n\nThough Dance never played Bond, he did portray the fictional secret agent's creator, Ian Fleming, in the 1989 TV movie Goldeneye. During the new interview, the Game of Thrones alum also discussed another interesting foray in his career – directing Judi Dench and Maggie Smith in the 2004 British film Ladies in Lavender.\n\n\"That was one of the few films that gave the U.K. film council a return on its investment, though I say it myself,\" he said. \"It was charming. It didn't move mountains, cinematically – it was just a sweet little film about two old ladies living in Cornwall. Fortunately, I had Judi Dench and Maggie Smith. I could have shot the telephone directory.\""
