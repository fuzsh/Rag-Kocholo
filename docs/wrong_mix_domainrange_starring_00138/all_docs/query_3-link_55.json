        "text": "In a rare public appearance, Charles Dance discusses his remarkable 50-year career in theatre, film and television. As famed for his portrayals of steely villains and scheming politicians, as well as his striking good looks, Charles remains one of the most sought-after actors, starring in two of TV's current biggest hits, as Tywin Lannister in Game of Thrones and the new series of the crown as Lord Mountbatten. It was his BAFTA nominated performance in The Jewel of the Crown that brought Charles to international attention, and he received further recognition later with his Press Guild Award for best actor in Bleak House. A celebrated stage actor, Charles has played title roles with the RSC and he received a Critic's Circle Award for Best Actor in Shadowlands. With starring credits on stage and screen too many to list, as well as his directing and writing debut for Ladies in Lavender with Judi Dench and Maggie Smith, this promises to be an evening of matchless anecdotes and intriguing insight. Presented by Fane Productions as part of the 'Sunday Encounters at the Haymarket' season."
