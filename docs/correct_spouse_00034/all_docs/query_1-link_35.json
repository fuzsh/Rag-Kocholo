        "text": "Jill and husband Craig Conway, who have been together for five years, shunned the extravagance of mansions in the countryside and exclusive magazine deals to tie the knot in a traditional wedding in St Andrew's Church, Newcastle.\n\nThey turned down magazine deals for their wedding photos, opting instead to pose for well-wishers outside the church.\n\nLarge crowds gathered outside as the couple exchanged vows inside, and they got a big cheer as they stepped out into the churchyard.\n\nClutching a bouquet of white orchids, Jill wore an ivory, satin empire-line dress, encrusted in simple pearl detail and finished with gold peep-toe heels, while a smiling Craig strolled alongside her in a navy three-piece suit, complete with a black cravat.\n\nJill's four bridesmaids looked equally stunning in floor-skimming, forest green satin dresses.\n\nCraig was not content with one best man, so he had three, including his close pal, actor and film-maker Phil Hoffman.\n\nPhil said: \"The wedding was lovely, really lovely.\n\n\"Everyone is having a fantastic day - it's a really big, family day for them.\"\n\nThe happy couple were watched by about 100 of their close friends and family, and they were also joined by Jill's pregnant Waterloo Road co-star Angela Griffin, who was there with her husband, Jason Milligan.\n\nCraig said: \"We are the two happiest people in Newcastle today, and it's just great to be back home.\""
