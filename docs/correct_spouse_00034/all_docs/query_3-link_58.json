        "text": "The Holiday spoilers follow.\n\nIt should have been the picture-perfect getaway for Kate (EastEnders' Jill Halfpenny). A delightful Maltese villa with her best friends and their kids away from dreary England... but then, that wouldn't make The Holiday such a heartstopper, would it?\n\nSoon convinced her husband Sean (Killing Eve star Owen McDonnell) was having an affair with one of her said friends... who just so happened to be staying at the same Maltese villa they were.\n\nNo wonder the series is currently riding high on Netflix's top 10 TV series in the UK right now.\n\nThe question was, which of the three other women in the villa was it – best friend Rowan (Siobhan Hewitt)? Uni pal Jenny (Liv Mjönes)? Or late arrival Izzy (Cat Simmons)? As the group of friends and their young families come together for a summer holiday, Kate becomes aware of messages between her husband and a mystery woman 'CoralGirl' – confirming she's close by.\n\nBut as secrets and Kate's speculations continue to unravel, episode three ended in heartbreak when a shrub fire, accidentally started by teenager Jake, was made worse by the discovery that Izzy (Cat Simmons) was dead after being pushed off a mountain cliff onto the rocks below.\n\nSo who was Sean's other woman? Who killed Izzy, and how does the story unfold?\n\nHere's how the thriller played out as it reached its dramatic conclusion.\n\nWho was Sean having an affair with?\n\nSo for the first big reveal – Sean wasn't having an affair with anyone, despite how it initially looked. He was actually covering up a secret far, far worse – and it concerned their daughter, Lucy.\n\nSean's secret text buddy, CoralGirl, was Kate's best mate Jenny, who they'd known since they were at university together. Kate initially presumed Jenny was the one having the affair with Sean, but she had long denied it, saying her husband had got jealous after discovering Sean and Jenny had a one night stand when they were just in their teens.\n\nBut while they were tightly bonded, Jenny and Sean's one-off dalliance was in fact way in the past, and they were actually in cahoots for the sake of their respective children, Lucy and Jake.\n\nBack at home in Chorley before the holiday, Lucy had called Jake in hysterics begging for help after discovering a boy she liked, Alex Fraser, had filmed them engaging in a sexual act without her knowledge. The video had then been shared around the local kids in an act of revenge porn. Embarrassed and heartbroken, she had confided in Jake, and in a raging voice message said she wanted Jake to kill the boy for her.\n\nWhile most would dismiss the comment as a (completely justified) moment of pure rage, turns out Jake took that instruction pretty literally. When presented with an opportunity, Jake ran Alex over with Lucy's car. While out jogging, Sean became an unwitting witness to the attack, watching the car speed off leaving Alex for dead, sprawled out in the road after the hit-and-run.\n\nDiscovering Jake was driving the car, Sean and Jenny had used the chat app to secretly message each other updates and formulate a plan to protect their kids. Alex was rushed to A&E but did eventually die from his injuries.\n\nSean and Jenny wanted to cover their kids' tracks, simultaneously protecting them and keeping their other halves in the dark about it all so they wouldn't be implicated, especially as Kate herself was a police officer. As a result the messages read like an affair when she finally saw them.\n\nWhen Kate had tried to lure 'CoralGirl' to a meet-up, Jenny figured it out and sent Izzy in her place, leaving Kate to assume she was the friend betraying her by sleeping with her husband.\n\nBut poor Izzy was actually planning to use the trip to come out as gay to her pals, telling Sean on the way back from the airport. She even had a girlfriend back home who she'd been hiding.\n\nUnfortunately, she was killed before the truth came out, with Kate only discovering what she was hiding by reading her diary after her death.\n\nWho killed Izzy?\n\nThe hit-and-run of Alex Fraser sent everyone who knew into a spiral, particularly as they were waiting to hear if he had died or not. When he did, things went from bad to worse, and Jenny in particular went to extreme measures to keep Jake out of trouble.\n\nShe even killed her lifelong friend Izzy by pushing her off a cliff.\n\nLittle Odette saw everything play out, and in tears admitted what happened to the adults. But just when it seemed like a problem had been solved, the remainder of the group realised that Jenny had gone missing… as well as Kate and Sean's young son, Danny.\n\nIn a desperate act, Jenny lured Danny away from the villa and to the kids' secret clubhouse, before deliberately falsely accusing him of starting the shrub fire, brandishing the lighter that did it. The terrified child insisted he had nothing to do with it, but she refused to listen, dragging him to the same cliff face that Izzy was killed on.\n\nUsing a tracking app on their son's phone, Sean and Kate rushed to save Danny and try and rationalise with Jenny, who was refusing to hear any of it. Holding Danny close to the edge, she threatened to kill him unless they kept Jake's secret.\n\nJenny told them Danny started the fire (he didn't, it was Jake) but she'd keep quiet if they never reveal Jake's hit-and-run protecting their daughter. She added that Izzy dying was an accident.\n\nThey agreed to help her, but Jenny didn't believe them. In a heartstopping moment, she let go of Danny, but Kate dived and caught him from before he fell to his death.\n\nStunned Jenny just stood there, unsure what to do next.\n\nWhat happened next?\n\nBack in the UK, Sean, Kate, Jenny and Danny attended Izzy's funeral. Jenny's husband Alistair attended quietly at the back, ashamed to be there.\n\nHe later told Kate that Jake is in a mental health facility and Jenny has admitted to the murder, but by 'diminished capacity'. He tried to blame Jenny for being overbearing as a mother but Kate told him he needs to be held accountable for not getting Jake help sooner and allowing his behaviour to continue without question.\n\nKate and Sean, while putting on a united front at the funeral, have since hit a rough patch, with Kate no longer wearing her wedding ring.\n\nReturning to work as a police officer, Kate was grappling with the secret, telling Lucy she was going to tell everything to her bosses so Alex's family can finally know why their son was killed.\n\nLucy broke down and admitted, despite saying otherwise, she was in the car with Jake when he hit Alex. She thought they were just going to confront him, and Jake ran him over. She begged her mum not to say anything, because she's an accessory to murder.\n\nIn shock, Kate locked herself in the bathroom trying to figure out what to do. Listening to the voice message Lucy sent to Jake on that fateful day commanding him to kill him, she decided to delete the message.\n\nAfter she does, a frustrated Kate lashed out in a rage, breaking the bathroom mirror as she did so, realising all the family are now having to hide this deadly secret and everything she stood for was now having to come into question."
