        "text": "Mam, by all accounts, was a divorced mother who lived in Newton Aycliffe with her child(ren) and her boyfriend Brian. (PROSE: Fanboys, The Diary of a Dr. Who Addict, The Story of Fester Cat, Imaginary Boys, AUDIO: Imaginary Boys, PROSE: Miss Baumgarten's Trolls, Party Like it's 1979) However, the identity of her child(ren) and which time period she lived in were subject to contradiction. By one account, her name was Mary. (AUDIO: Imaginary Boys)\n\nShe was, by some accounts, raising her child(ren) in the 1970s and 1980s, (PROSE: Fanboys, The Story of Fester Cat, Miss Baumgarten's Trolls) though other accounts showed her rasing her children in the 2000s and 2010s. (AUDIO: Imaginary Boys, PROSE: Imaginary Boys) By one account, she was raising two brothers, David and Chris, (PROSE: Fanboys) or just David, (PROSE: Miss Baumgarten's Trolls) or by some accounts David Taylor and Catherine, (PROSE: AUDIO: Imaginary Boys, PROSE: Imaginary Boys) although a couple of other accounts showed her as the mother of Paul Magrs and Louise, (PROSE: The Story of Fester Cat, Party Like it's 1979)\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nMam grew up with her mother and her sisters and her brother. Her mother tried her best to provide for them, but had little money. So, on Christmas, they would each receive a handful of sweets, a Disney Annual, and a shared present with Mam's twin sister. As her Christmasses were small, when she had Paul, she tried her best to buy him as many presents as she could. (PROSE: Party Like it's 1979)\n\nAdult life[]\n\nAs an adult, \"Mam\" married a police officer, Alfie, (PROSE: Talented Witches) and then they had a child, and a few years later they divorced. (PROSE: The Story of Fester Cat)\n\nShe lived in a council house in Newton Aycliffe. (PROSE: Fanboys, Party Like it's 1979) In an account where her child was Paul, Paul recollected that his Mam had thought little of cats, not allowing Paul to look after one. Mam also fretted about buying lots of presents for everybody, as if to make the recipient's life just a little better.\n\nOn Christmas, 1977, she and Paul woke up early, rushing downstairs to watch Paul unwrap his presents. His father then arrived hours too early, and after Mam had a go at him, he took Paul to see his Little Nanna and Granddad.\n\nYears passed, with Paul living in her home and his father's flat, and she became Brian's boyfriend. As Paul lived in two homes, she and his father met halfway between their homes, in Durham, to drop off/pick up Paul. She kept Brian in her car. (PROSE: The Story of Fester Cat)\n\nIn 1979, after Paul's school closed due to the snow, she and Paul had lots of time to do their festive routines, such as visiting family and a visit to the \"Council Van Santa\", and a shopping trip to their local supermarket for Christmassy foods, and they then decorated their home with fake snow, etc, etc. On Christmas Eve, they watched many TV episodes and movies, and Paul went to be early. On Christmas Day, she and Paul woke up, and she let Paul into the living room to see that Santa had filled the room with Christmas presents, though Paul knew it was Mam who had did the hard work. (PROSE: Party Like it's 1979)\n\nSometime in the mid-1980s, she gave birth to Louise, and in 2006, she, Louise, and Brian visited Paul and his partner in their home. Sometime later, Paul and Jeremy took them on a cruise in the Mediterranean. In Summer of 2012, she, Brian, and Louise left England and emigrated to Australia. (PROSE: The Story of Fester Cat)\n\nBehind the scenes[]\n\n\"Mam\" was the real-world mother of author Paul Magrs, who tended to write stories about his childhood, often utilising licensed DWU elements in the process, due to his love of Doctor Who spanning back to when he was a child. Initially, these stories featured a stand-in for Paul, known as David (sometimes with the surname Taylor). However, there is an almost 1:1 stand-in of Paul in the DWU, which has been the most recurring and prominent.\n\nDue to the use of \"Mam\" (who is undoubtedly the same character between accounts) on three different stand-ins, its created a rather complicated and contradictory life for Paul's in-universe Mam."
