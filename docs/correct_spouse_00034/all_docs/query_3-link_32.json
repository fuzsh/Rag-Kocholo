        "text": "The following article contains The Holiday spoilers.\n\nIf you've been watching The Holiday on Netflix - no, not the Kate Winslet-Jack Black-Cameron Diaz-Jude Law 2006 film, but the drama series, chances are, you've got a *lot* of questions about the ending.\n\nAs Kate (Jill Halfpenny) became convinced that her husband Sean (Owen McDonnell) was having an affair with one of her close friends (who were also on holiday with the couple), things start to unravel in the most dramatic of finales. Deliberating whether it was her BFF Rowan (Siobhan Hewitt), uni friend Jenny (Liv Mj√∂nes), or latecomer Izzy (Cat Simmon), Kate is desperate to find out who 'CoralGirl' is - the person Sean has been secretly texting.\n\nThe end of episode 3 is when things start to really kick off, as a shrub fire is accidentally started by teenager Jake, only for everyone to then find out that Izzy was pushed from a cliff to her death. And as we all try to come to terms with everything, i.e who killed Izzy and who Sean's other woman is, we've broken down the ending so you can sleep tonight...\n\nWho was Sean having an affair with?\n\nAre you ready for this? Sean wasn't actually having an affair. He was covering up for a secret that was way worse. It turns out CoralGirl was Jenny - who Kate initially thought - but their message exchanges were far from relationship-related. Jenny and Sean were actually covering up for their children, Lucy and Jake, who had involved themselves in some seriously illegal actions. Back home, Lucy had engaged in a sexual act with a boy she liked called Alex Fisher, who unbeknown to her, had filmed the entire thing and sent it out to his contacts. In hysterics, Lucy calls Jake to tell him and asks him to kill Alex for her.\n\nWhile many people would not take that request literally, Jake did, and it sets off a huge chain of events that do *not* end well. Running over Alex in Lucy's car, Sean witnesses the hit-and-run while out on a jog and discovers that Jake was the driver. Sean then begins to secretly message Jenny (after finding out Lucy was also in the car) to update each other on the situation as they try and hatch a plan.\n\nThey decide to keep the secret from their other halves - especially Kate, who is a police officer, which is why she presumes that Sean is seeing another woman. And when Kate tries to meet up with CoralGirl, Jenny finds out and sends Izzy in her place, leaving her to assume she was the one cheating with Sean.\n\nIn another plot twist, Izzy was actually planning on using the trip to come out to her friends - she even told Sean on the way back from the airport that she had a girlfriend at home. But Kate only discovers the truth after her death when she reads her diary.\n\nWho is Izzy's killer?\n\nAfter finding out that Alex died in the hit-and-run, Jenny takes things up a notch to ensure that Jake doesn't get in trouble. She even pushes her friend Izzy off a cliff after Lucy confided in her about what really happened in the car with Jake. But one of the children, Odette saw everything that happened. In tears, she tells the adults, but during the big reveal, the group find that Jenny and Danny (Kate and Sean's young son) are missing.\n\nTurns out Jenny has taken Danny to the kid's clubhouse and accuses him of starting the fire. Terrified, Danny insists he didn't do it, but Jenny refuses to listen and drags him to the cliff where Izzy died. Sean and Kate then use a tracking app to find them both, and try to talk Jenny down. Refusing to listen, she holds Danny close to the edge and threatens to kill him unless everyone keeps Jake's secret.\n\nThe Ending\n\nKate, Sean, Danny and Jenny all attend Izzy's funeral back in the UK. Afterwards, Jenny's husband Alistair tells Kate that his wife had admitted to Izzy's murder and that Jake was in a mental health facility.\n\nStruggling to keep the enormous secrets, Kate tells Lucy that she's going to tell her bosses on her return to work so Alex's family can find out why he was killed. Lucy then breaks down and tells Kate that she was also in the car, saying she didn't think Jake was going to run him over, but just confront him. Pleading with Kate to keep quiet about her involvement, Kate locks herself in a bathroom to digest everything.\n\nAs she listens to the voice message of Lucy asking Jake to kill Alex, she decides to delete it. Kate then realises that she and her family also have to harbour this secret, and lashes out in turmoil."
