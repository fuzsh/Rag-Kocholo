        "text": "Jill Halfpenny has been named in the cast of ITV's dark new drama The Long Shadow which is all about infamous Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe.\n\nThe seven part series is being billed as the definitive depiction of the desperate five-year hunt for serial killer Sutcliffe, sensitively focussing on the lives of the victims who crossed his path and those of the officers at the heart of the police investigation. With the victims, their families and the survivors at the heart of this series, The Long Shadow brings a new perspective to a well-documented story, with a cast which includes Coronation Street, Cheat and Liar star Katherine Kelly, award-winning actor Toby Jones and Lee Ingleby, fresh from his appearance in another ITV true crime drama, The Hunt For Raoul Moat..\n\nAnd another recognisable face in the drama is Geordie star Jill, who first shot to fame in the late 80s on Byker Grove, before going onto appear in hit BBC shows EastEnders, Waterloo Road and Strictly Come Dancing, which she won at the end of 2004. More recently Jill has returned to screens in BBC's Dirty Money and two well received Channel 5 dramas - The Drowning and The Holiday.\n\nREAD MORE: Vera fans clock star with ITV past thanks to role in 'iconic' drama\n\nIn The Long Shadow, she takes on the role of Doreen Hill, the mother of Sutcliffe's last victim, 20-year-old student Jacqueline Hill, who was found battered to death on waste ground in Leeds in November 1980. Sutcliffe killed Middlesbrough born Jacqueline while murder detectives mistakenly targeted a North East killer after the notorious Wearside Jack tapes.\n\nThe Long Shadow cast also includes a host of other well known faces, including Daniel Mays, famous for his roles in Mrs Biggs, Line of Duty and Des, as well as former Coronation Street star James Collier, Emmerdale favourite Charley Webb and Daisy Waterstone as Jill's on screen daughter.\n\nThe drama, solely written by award-winning screenwriter, George Kay (Hijack, Criminal: UK) and solely directed by BAFTA-winning director Lewis Arnold (Sherwood, Time, Des) is set to launch on ITV1 and ITVX next month."
