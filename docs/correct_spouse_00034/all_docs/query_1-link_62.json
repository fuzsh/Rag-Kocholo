        "text": "EastEnders star Jill Halfpenny revealed she has found love seven years after the heartbreaking death of her partner Matt Jones.\n\nJill Halfpenny’s partner died of a heart attack two years ago in tragic circumstances mirroring her father’s death.\n\nThe former EastEnders actress, who played Kate Mitchell, lost her dad Colin in 1979 when she was just four years old, when he had a heart attack after going out to play a game of football.\n\nAnd Jill, 48, suffered further heartache in 2017 when her partner died at the gym.\n\nSpeaking about her new romance, Jill told Prima Magazine: ‘It sounds so cheesy, but I think Ian and I met at the perfect time. After Matt died, I didn’t know if I’d ever meet anyone again, but Ian is my cheerleader – I know I’ve met somebody who I love and who loves me.’\n\nThe Strictly Come Dancing winner previously spoke about the tragedy on The Two Shot Podcast with Line Of Duty actor Craig Parkinson.\n\nJill explained: ‘Something happened a couple of years ago – I experienced something I’ve never ever spoken about.\n\n‘In January 2017 my partner, in very similar circumstances to my dad, went to the gym, had a heart attack and died.\n\n‘What happened was that it brought all of my grief from my dad as well; it was like dealing with a double loss – a loss I’d never dealt with.’\n\nJill, who did not name her partner, continued: ‘Oh my god, it’s unbearable. I cannot cope with these feelings. I just want cessation: the feeling to stop.’\n\nHowever, the star said she prefers to talk about her feelings now rather than bottling them up, telling Craig: ‘It’s been a rough few years but I’m here and talking to you.’\n\nOn the podcast, Jill shared that after her dad’s death, she pretended to be happy to match her family’s ‘get on with things’ attitude but would then cry alone in her bedroom.\n\nJill – also known for her roles in Coronation Street, Byker Grove, Humans and Waterloo Road – was previously married to Craig Conway from 2007 until 2010, and they are parents to 16-year-old Harvey Reece.\n\nMORE : EastEnders icon films new scenes with Danny Dyer as she returns to TV\n\nMORE : EastEnders spoilers: Zack’s terror for the future as he fears becoming abuser after scary act"
