        "text": "GOLDEN girl Jill Halfpenny and her hubby actor Craig Conway have split after four years of marriage.\n\nThe couple, who have a two-year-old son Harvey together, are set to remain good friends and are even due to star in the same movie together.\n\nA source close to the pair said: “It all happened quite a while ago but they’re definitely still friends.\n\n“It’s sad, but they get on together now much better than they did before.\n\n“The amount of work they are doing might have had something to do with their breaking up but it’s not something they’ve ever really wanted to talk about.\n\n“They’re both very private people.”\n\nThe couple, who still own a house together in leafy Stocksfield in Northumberland’s Tyne Valley, now live in separate homes in London, their son living with Jill.\n\nThe movie they are set to star in together is also being filmed in the capital.\n\nFormer Gateshead St Edmund Campion School pupil Jill spent three months on stage at London’s Noel Coward Theatre as one of the stars of the Calendar Girls stage play, and is currently wowing crowds as Paulette, the kooky hairdresser in Legally Blonde.\n\nJill has also spoken of a new man in her life.\n\nThe star revealed: “I’ve recently separated from my husband so I’ve downsized my whole wardrobe by about half, which was hugely cathartic.\n\n“I have a new partner who is very complimentary of both my tomboy look and my glamorous look.”\n\nEx-EastEnders actress Jill and Craig met eight years ago when they both starred in a stage version of George Orwell’s 1984 at Newcastle Playhouse.\n\nThe couple initially lived together in London but soon after bought their Northumberland home.\n\nCraig, who has starred in The Descent and Doomsday, left Jill stunned when he proposed to her on stage at the end of the Theatre Royal’s Christmas Eve performance of Cinderella, where she was playing the Fairy Godmother. The pair brought Newcastle city centre to a standstill when they wed in February 2007, at St Andrew’s Church, watched by close friends and family.\n\nTheir son Harvey was born the following year.\n\nDespite their split the pair are now both due to star in the new film How To Stop Being A Loser, alongside the likes of Withnail and I actor Richard E Grant and Hollyoaks star Gemma Atkinson.\n\nThe production will see Craig playing a romance guru called Ampersand.\n\nIt won’t be the first time Jill and Craig have starred in the same production.\n\nThey were also in Peter Flannery’s The Bodies at Newcastle’s Live Theatre, and in 2006 they had a six-week run together in the Theatre Royal’s Jack and the Beanstalk pantomime.\n\nTheir agents at Ken McReddie Associates said: “It is an amicable separation and also deeply private so therefore there will be no further comment.”"
