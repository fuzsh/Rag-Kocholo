        "text": "Motherland star Paul Ready has said that he'd love his real-life wife Michelle Terry to play Kevin's constantly-absent spouse Jill, if she were ever to make an appearance in a future series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile there are now three series of Motherland – with the latest premiering on BBC Two tonight – viewers have never met Jill, the wife of hapless stay-at-home dad Kevin (Ready), though she's frequently mentioned throughout the show.\n\nWhen asked who he'd ideally like to play Jill if she were to appear in series four, Paul Ready told RadioTimes.com in an exclusive interview: \"Ooh, that's a good question. I do think it's a great thing we never meet Jill because I think the whole thing about Jill is that she lives in the audience's imagination, you can imagine, who is she?\n\n\"She could be very glamorous in a way, or she could kind of be the entire opposite.\n\n\"I was saying this to someone the other day, each time a series airs and I'm walking down the road with my wife, she's always saying, 'They think I'm Jill.' So maybe my wife could play Jill.\"\n\nMore like this\n\nReady's wife Michelle Terry is an Olivier Award-winning actor, best known for her performances in theatre shows such as Tribes, Macbeth, Hamlet and As You Like It.\n\nYour daily dose of TV &amp; Entertainment news\n\nSign up to be the first to know about breaking stories and new series!\n\nEmail address\n\nBy entering your details, you are agreeing to our terms and conditions and privacy policy.
