        "text": "I thought of the long history with my friends-the lies, the slights, the betrayals, and the five-year gap since our last get-together. Five of us had arrived at this desolate cabin. Now, only three of us remained.\n\nIt was supposed to be the perfect vacation: a secluded cabin by a private lake; late nights, wine and laughter. Megan hasn‚Äôt had time for herself since her second child was born, and she knows her friends need a break too-Jenna from her demanding job, Charlotte from marital problems and Kaitlyn and Sam from busy families. Between all their commitments Megan was afraid this trip would never happen, and she needs the comfort and familiarity of her oldest friends now more than ever.\n\nThey have known each other since college-there are no secrets between them.\n\nBut things change in the woods. As they reminisce, bad memories as well as good are dragged up, and old wounds are reopened. It seems not everyone remembers those college years as fondly as Megan, and a trip planned to bring them back together might just drive them apart for good.\n\nSomeone has been hiding a lie for over twenty years. And now lives are in danger.\n\n***\n\n***\n\nReview\n\nIn their first year of college, coincidence brought these 5 girls together and they clicked immediately. They went through thick and thin and remained friends afterwards. Is there a better way to celebrate this fact and to be able to reminisce than to spend a long weekend together? Of course not and when they find a beautiful cabin in the woods online, the reservation is swiftly made.\n\nEverything is perfect until they arrive‚Ä¶\n\nFriends can be as thick as thieves for the onlooker, but when you scratch away the silver surface, it seems like you have opened a can of worms. And those worms are ready to crawl out of their hiding place. The question is who will get away with it? Maybe there is a fish waiting to eliminate them‚Ä¶\n\nPeople can take a lot, but when too much is too much, they break and that‚Äôs when hell breaks loose.\n\nThe story is great and the setting makes it all a lot more suspenseful and creepy. I really had no idea about the what, why or who and was pleasantly surprised by the outcome. 5 stars\n\nThank you\n\n***\n\nAbout the author\n\nLaura Wolfe is an Amazon charts bestselling author who writes fast-paced and twisty psychological thrillers and suspense novels.

New start. But you‚Äôre staring at your one-night stand.\n\nAudrey Adams is starting over. Three days ago, she left her cheating ex. And Audrey did not walk out quietly: she sang the best break-up song of all time at her in a packed-out bar and dropped the mic. Then she had an unforgettable night with the most drop-dead gorgeous woman she‚Äôs ever seen in her life, a hiking guide with sparkling sky-blue eyes‚Ä¶ who she‚Äôs been trying not to think about ever since. Audrey is done with romance.\n\nBut on her first morning at her new job, she walks into someone. Literally headfirst into her, and as coffee begins to stain her shirt, Audrey looks up into a pair of familiar beautiful blue eyes. It‚Äôs Toni. The woman she last saw in her bed, her wild curls thrown across the pillow. And who is now technically her boss. Oh god.\n\nBut Audrey is a professional, she can make this work‚Ä¶ except every time Toni appears in another incredibly sexy plaid shirt, Audrey can‚Äôt help but imagine taking it right off. Then when Toni winks at her, Audrey is sure she‚Äôs also thinking about that amazing night they had together. But dating someone Audrey works with is a line she has never crossed, especially when she needs this job more than anything.\n\nBut rules are made to be broken‚Ä¶ right?\n\n***\n\n***\n\nAbout the author\n\nLaura Henry is the globe-trotting romance novelist alter-ego for Melissa Lenhardt.

But one of us is lying‚Ä¶\n\nMy little girl Lola is my whole world. Three years old and so beautiful ‚Äì all golden curls and dimpled cheeks.\n\nBut on our way home from holiday she was stolen, whisked away in the blink of an eye.\n\nI can‚Äôt breathe without Lola. I don‚Äôt know how to get her back.\n\nThe woman who has my daughter is on the run. And she has no intention of bringing Lola home. Because she says she‚Äôs her mother.\n\nBut that‚Äôs impossible, because I‚Äôm Lola‚Äôs mother.\n\nThough really, I should have known my secrets would come back to haunt me. That this day was always going to come‚Ä¶\n\nTwo women claim that Lola belongs to them. Two women with something to hide. Only one is telling the whole truth‚Ä¶ Who will you believe?\n\n***\n\n***\n\nReview\n\nIn my review I wrote yesterday for another book, I spoke about a web, a spider and an insect. Now I felt like I was the insect entangled in the sticky threads of a cobweb.\n\nI fell from one surprise into the other and my head was spinning, but I loved every minute of it.\n\nWhen you think, now I really know it all, brace yourself, because you ain‚Äôt see nothing yet. üôÇ\n\nThis is one complex story and oh so well written and thought through. I could easily compare it to a game of pass the parcel.

But each morning she wakes up alone is more painful than the last. She hopes moving into the crumbling seaside guest house her daughter just bought in Devon will help put what‚Äôs left of her broken family back together‚Ä¶\n\nThere, Louisa is offered a final chance to save her career by writing an article on a local sand artist, Isaac. Except, when he turns to greet her ‚Äì tall, handsome and weather-worn ‚Äì something about him feels disturbingly familiar. Why, when he looks into her eyes, does she feel like he knows exactly who she is and everything she‚Äôs been through?\n\nAs they explore the rugged coastline‚Äôs hidden coves together ‚Äì living and laughing like she never thought she would again ‚Äì Louisa is fascinated by this man who creates beautiful sculptures on the shoreline, but deep down she knows he‚Äôs keeping a secret from her. The discovery of a charcoal scribble in one of his sketchbooks linking him to the death of her husband, confirms her deepest fear. Is she ready for what he will tell her, and will letting him in rip her family and her heart apart all over again?\n\n***\n\n***\n\nReview\n\nWhen someone close to you is suddenly ripped out of your life, it‚Äôs only natural it seems like the world has stopped existing. You need time to recover from this and you resent the person responsible for you r loss.\n\nDuring a certain period of time, you keep thinking about the life you cannot live anymore and you are forced to find another path. The only problem is that you don‚Äôt see any new opportunities anymore and you are stuck in your grieve.\n\nOn the one hand I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äùs a good idea when someone tells you you should not think about the things you have lost but to be grateful for the things you have had. On the other hand, some people do need a wake up call in order to make them realise they are stuck. I think this would be easier to accept when it comes from someone you know than from a total stranger.\n\nOften people believe what they want to believe and forget there is always the other side of the coin though‚Ä¶\n\nThis is a beautiful story about love and loss, about family and second chances with someone you would never have considered this. 4 stars\n\nThank you\n\n***\n\nAbout the author\n\nAfter a varied career, Emma Davies once worked for a design studio where she was asked to provide a fun and humorous (and not necessarily true) anecdote for their website. She wrote the following: ‚ÄòI am a bestselling novelist currently masquerading as a thirty something mother of three.‚Äô Well the job in the design studio didn‚Äôt work out but she‚Äôs now a forty something mother of three and is happy to report the rest of her dream came true.\n\nAfter many years as a finance manager she now writes full time and is far happier playing with words than numbers. She lives with her husband, three children, and two guinea pigs in rural Shropshire where she writes in all the gaps in between real life. It‚Äôs a county she adores, her love of its beautiful people and landscapes providing endless inspiration for her books, and in fact the only thing that would make Shropshire more idyllic is if it were by the sea.\n\n***\n\nAuthor Links\n\nwebsite: http://www.emmadaviesauthor.com\n\nTwitter @EmDaviesAuthor / https://twitter.com/EmDaviesAuthor\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/emmadaviesauthor/\n\nhttp://www.instagram.com/authoremmadavies\n\n***\n\n***\n\nBook Link\n\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/After-Crash-unputdownable-heart-wrenching-page-turner-ebook/dp/B08VNCCM7C/\n\nPerfect families have the most to hide‚Ä¶\n\nI feel so lucky to live in a gorgeous house with my precious daughter on Riverside Road, surrounded by green hills and well-tended gardens. I‚Äôm just across from the Taylors, who were a second family to me when I was growing up. But late at night, I spot someone in the house across the street. Someone who shouldn‚Äôt be there‚Ä¶\n\nLily Taylor and I are best friends and closer than sisters, but life in our idyllic neighbourhood comes to a shuddering halt when I find Lily‚Äôs father murdered in his own bed. As I break the news to Lily, I swear to her that I‚Äôll do everything I can to help her family. Who could possibly have done this?\n\nI tell the police, but while they‚Äôre trying to find the killer, I start getting threatening notes that leave me shaking with fear. Then someone throws a brick through my eleven-year-old daughter Cassie‚Äôs bedroom window, covering her in shards of broken glass. As I stand in her wrecked bedroom, I make a choice. I am desperate to help Lily get justice, but my daughter‚Äôs safety has to come first.\n\nEven when I stop helping with the investigation, the messages keep coming. Someone knows what I saw, and I‚Äôm terrified they‚Äôll come for my little girl next. But they‚Äôve underestimated me.\n\nNo matter how far I have to go, I‚Äôll always protect the people I love‚Ä¶\n\n***\n\n***\n\nReview\n\nBest friends are like the family you have picked yourself and you would do anything for them. You spend as much time as possible with them, you support them through the good and the bad times. They are the ones you love and you would protect them no matter what.\n\nMistakes are being made and although the outcome was devastating, they are forgiven and the cracks that showed are plastered over. Sometimes there is one secret too many and that bond that seemed unbreakable, now is ripped apart and the pieces are thrown away, never to be mended again.\n\nThis book is full of twists and revelations. You are like sisters, vowing to be like this for ever and ever, until‚Ä¶\n\nI saw through one person, but there was a lot left I had no idea about. Excellent read. 5 stars\n\nThank you\n\n***\n\nAbout the author\n\nJill always loved writing ‚Äì real and imaginary ‚Äì and spent thirty years travelling the world as a journalist, living overseas and reporting wherever the news took her.

Everything I‚Äôve lost, the child my great grandmother Nellie lost, all feels so present here, in the land my family left years ago. How will I ever move on? Will I ever uncover the truth about the little girl who went missing all those years ago?\n\nWhen Boston-born Erin arrives in wind-tossed Roone Bay, she‚Äôs heart-sore, tired and lonely. Her marriage is over: she‚Äôs come to build a new life for herself on Ireland‚Äôs rugged southern coast. And to unravel the story behind the mysterious note in her family‚Äôs ancient Bible that has haunted her since childhood. But hazel-eyed former lifeboat volunteer Finn, the only local historian around, quietly refuses her pleas to help.\n\nSo Erin settles in to the town, with its whitewashed cottages and ruddy-cheeked fishermen, and begins her quest alone. Who was her ancestor, Nellie, and why did she leave Ireland for America? What happened to her missing child, Annie, and did Nellie ever see her again?\n\nJust as Erin despairs ever uncovering the truth, one rain-soaked night she is rescued by Finn, who finally agrees to help. And by firelight and candlelight each evening, just as it would have been in her great-grandmother‚Äôs time, Finn and Erin grow closer as they share their stories.\n\nBut just as Erin wonders if Roone Bay could be her forever home, she makes a devastating discovery. Will she be able to face the truth, which changes everything she thought she knew about herself, her past, and her family‚Äôs Irish legacy? Or will she run, just as Nellie did all those years ago, and lose the best chance at happiness she‚Äôs ever had‚Ä¶?\n\n***\n\n***\n\nAbout the author\n\nDaisy O‚ÄôShea lives in the south of Ireland and is a full-time author.

But when desperate Megan returns with the police, all they find is empty woodland.\n\nShe‚Äôs been through so much, her sister whispers, welcoming her home with a kind smile. You can‚Äôt blame her for seeing things.\n\nBut Megan knows what she saw ‚Äì and her past shouldn‚Äôt come into it. Was the young woman dead, or dying? How can a body just disappear?\n\nMegan left home for a good reason. Now, confronting the past could be the only way to find the truth.But what if Megan is in danger, too? And what price will she have to pay, to find the girl from the woods?\n\n***\n\n***\n\nReview\n\nIt is so frustrating when you have experienced something horrible and nobody believes you because the proof you have has vanished. you know you have seen it. You know it‚Äôs true what you are saying, but because of your past and what you went trough then, people are convinced you have imagined it‚Ä¶\n\nThis is what happens to Megan. But Megan will not be silenced or ridiculed and decides to dig until she uncovers the truth.\n\nThe more she investigates, the more sinister it becomes and she realises she has trusted some untrustworthy people.\n\nThe clock is ticking and she has to act fast. She has a plan though and some allies.\n\nI loved the relationship between Megan and her niece and I admire Megan for how she climbed out of the dark space she was in.\n\nA very enjoyable book that captured my attention and never let go.
