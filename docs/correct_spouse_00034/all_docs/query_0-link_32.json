        "text": "Jill Halfpenny is an English actress famous for appearing in Byker Grove, Coronation Street, EastEnders, Waterloo, and The Cuckoo.\n\nShe is in the limelight for finding new love again as she continues to process her grief after the devastating demise of her partner, Matt Janes. Let’s explore more.\n\n36 years old Jill Halfpenny was born in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, England, on July 15, 1975.\n\nShe started acting in 1989, starring as Nicola Dobson in Newcastle-based children’s drama series Byker Grove. She played the role until 1992.\n\nSimilarly, she made her radio debut covering slots on BBC Radio 2 for regular presenters Liza Tarbuck and Sara Cox. Later, she hosted the station’s Good Morning Sunday show throughout August 2018.\n\nShe has narrated commercials for The Sunday Times, Cocoa Pops, Argos, First Choice, and Royal Air Force.\n\nPan Macmillan will publish her memoir, A Life Reimagined, in June 2024. It touches on the story of her father and ex-partner’s demise.\n\nJill Halfpenny Griefed Following Matt’s Demise, But Ian Became Her Cheerleader\n\nIn January 2017, Matt Janes, Jill Halfpenny’s ex-partner, tragically lost his life. At the age of forty-three, he had a heart attack in the gym.\n\nShe opened up about dealing with grief following Matt’s sudden demise. It took two years for Jill to open up about her unbearable grief.\n\nThe loss was similar to her father’s passing when she was just four years old. Her father went to play football and never returned home in 1979.\n\nJill explained,\n\nGrief has made her a better person and less judgemental about herself.\n\nShe described her feeling as though she was living under a curse, experiencing such devastating loss twice. She resolved not to let that incident define her life, seeking therapy.\n\nDespite the pain, she eventually found love again after seven years with her new partner, Ian.\n\nJill shared that meeting Ian felt like perfect timing, and he has become her cheerleader.\n\nShe expressed gratitude for meeting someone she loves and who loves her in return.\n\nMoreover, she married actor Craig Conway in 2007, and they have a son, Harvey-Reece Conway. Their marriage didn’t last long, and they went their separate ways in 2010.\n\nAdditional Information"
