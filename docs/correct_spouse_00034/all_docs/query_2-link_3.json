        "text": "Former EastEnders actress Jill Halfpenny has opened up about the \"unbearable\" grief she experienced when her partner died suddenly two years ago. The 44-year-old appeared on Line of Duty actor Craig Parkinson's podcast, The Two Shot Podcast, where she shared her grief following the death of Matt, who passed away when he suffered a heart attack at the gym. Tragically, his death mirrored that of Jill's father, Colin Halfpenny, who also died of a heart attack in 1979.\n\nJill Halfpenny has opened up about the shocking death of her partner\n\n\"In January 2017, my partner, in very similar circumstances to my dad, he went to a peloton class at the gym, and he had a heart attack and died,\" Jill said. With her voice breaking, she continued: \"My grief at losing Matt, my partner, was so brutal and so shocking but then what happened was it brought out all of the grief from my dad as well. It was like dealing with a double loss – a loss I'd never actually dealt with.\" The TV star confessed: \"I just found myself thinking, 'Oh my god, this is unbearable. What am I going to do? I cannot cope. I just want cessation, this feeling to stop.'\"\n\nMORE: Loose Women's Andrea McLean debuts incredible transformation – see pics\n\nIt follows an interview Jill gave to the Radio Times, in which she spoke about the death of her father, who suffered a heart attack in the middle of a football match when she was just four years old. \"He was playing football and he had a heart attack,\" she said. \"In the morning he was there and then, in the evening, he wasn't. Girls are brought up to believe that Daddy will be the person who comes to their rescue. When you've lost that sense of somebody being able to come to your rescue, you say, 'To hell with it. I'll be my own rescuer.'\"\n\nThe TV star was previously married to actor Craig Conway"
