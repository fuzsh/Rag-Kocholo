        "text": "Line of Duty and Harry Potter actor Lee Ingleby and Strictly Come Dancing series winner Jill Halfpenny star in a nail-biting new psychological thriller starting on Channel 5. The first episode of The Cuckoo airs on Channel 5 on Monday, April 8.\n\nViewers have been told to expect an 'intense drama of secrets and deception' as a family-of-three leave behind their financial struggles and city life in favour of a fresh start in the countryside.\n\nBut tensions rise when married couple Jessica and Nick are forced to invite a stranger to live with them to make ends meet. Their new lodger, artist Sian, inserts herself into the family's lives and Nick begins to have his suspicions about her true motives.\n\nRead more:Millions will be blocked from watching BBC iPlayer today under new rule\n\nGet breaking news on BirminghamLive WhatsApp and join our dedicated community\n\nThe dramatic four-part series kicks off on Channel 5 at 9pm. Here's everything you need to know about the show...\n\nWho's in The Cuckoo?\n\nEnglish actress Jill Halfpenny leads the cast of the new series as mysterious lodger Sian. She's starred in hit shows such as BBC's Byker Grove and Eastenders and won an Olivier Award for Best Supporting Actress in the original West End run of Legally Blonde, the musical.\n\nStrictly fans may also recognise her from the second season of the hit dance contest, which she won with partner Darren Bennett back in 2004. Jill beat off competition from Julian Clary and Denise Lewis to be crowned the series champion and she still holds the record for the best-scored Jive in Strictly history.\n\nTroubled husband Nick is played by Lee Ingleby, who is best-known for his roles as Stan Shunpike in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Detective Inspector John Bacchus in the BBC drama Inspector George Gently and as Nick Huntley in the fourth series of Line of Duty.\n\nHis wife Jessica is played by Claire Goose, who has starred in dramas The Bay, Unforgotten and Waking the Dead. She won a Royal Television Society award in 2016 for her performance as Jane Kennedy in The Coroner. And Freya Hannan-Mills, who has appeared in Swimming Home and Hereafter, takes on the role of the couple's teenage adoptive daughter Alice.\n\nWhat is The Cuckoo about?\n\nThe story follows the family after they move to their dream home in the country, but their new lodger Sian has a dark past and soon causes friction as she oversteps boundaries and changes the household dynamics.\n\nLater, a pawn shop receipt stirs up trouble and Alice's life is suddenly put in danger. Drama unfolds and Nick is horrified to find himself implicated in a violent incident as the couple battle to save their daughter.\n\nWhere was The Cuckoo filmed?\n\nThe Channel 5 series was created by Barunka O’Shaughnessy for Clapperboard Studios and filming took place in the mountains and valleys of eastern Ireland.\n\nJill Halfpenny described the location as 'gorgeous' and said: \"We were in a huge farmhouse for most of the shoot - it was so big, you only see a tiny bit of it on screen! It's in County Wicklow, which is a gorgeous part of Ireland.\"\n\nWhen is The Cuckoo on TV?\n\nThe first episode of the suspenseful new series airs on Channel 5 at 9pm on Monday, April 8. The following three episodes will air on consecutive nights at the same time, ending with the final episode on Thursday, April 11."
