        "text": "West End and EastEnders veteran Jill Halfpenny has found love again, seven years after tragically losing her partner Matt Janes to a fatal heart attack at the gym.\n\nHis death in January 2017 was unbearably poignant for the actress - known for playing Kate Mitchell in the popular soap - as it reminded her of her father's untimely passing.\n\nThis painful chapter unearthed deep-seated grief within the star, making her revisit the hurt she felt when her father suffered a fatal heart attack while playing football back in 1979 - she was just 4-years-old at that time.\n\nIn conversation with Prima Magazine, Halfpenny spoke about allowing herself essential time for healing before meeting her new beau, Ian: \"It sounds so cheesy, but I think Ian and I met at the perfect time\", she confided with the publication.\n\n\"After Matt died, I didn't know if I'd ever meet anyone again, but Ian is my cheerleader - I know I've met somebody who I love and who loves me.\"\n\nLearning to navigate her grief anew at 48, Jill feels it has helped her grow as a person, reflecting: \"I was in my 20s when I realised a lot of my behaviour was down to this unprocessed grief. I got divorced, I stopped drinking alcohol and then it all seemed so clear the jigsaw pieces fit.\"\n\n\"Grief has made me a better person. Processing the grief has softened me and I've become less judgemental about myself. I am my own worst critic, but I have got better\", she shared. This inspired her to pen a memoir, A Life Reimagined, focusing on navigating profound grief, as she firmly believes it needs to be \"talked about\", reports the Mirror.\n\n\"There's this idea that grief shouldn't be discussed because it might cause distress. But I need to talk about it; I want Matt present in the room with me. I want to keep his memory alive\", Jill further expressed.\n\nJill, who was previously wedded to actor Craig Conway for three years before having a brief relationship with Ant McPartlin, spoke candidly about Matt's passing to Line of Duty star Craig Parkinson on the Two Show Podcast in 2019, describing his death as a \"double loss\" as it painfully echoed her father Colin's demise.\n\nShen said: \"My grief at losing Matt, my partner, was so brutal and so shocking but then what happened was it brought out all of the grief from my dad as well.\n\n\"It was like dealing with a double loss a loss I'd never actually dealt with. I just found myself thinking, 'Oh my god, this is unbearable. What am I going to do? I cannot cope. I just want cessation, this feeling to stop'.\""
