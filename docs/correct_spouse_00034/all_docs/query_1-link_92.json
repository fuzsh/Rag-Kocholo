        "text": "FEBRUARY 2020\n\nNewcastle Arena\n\nOnce again, for the third time in a row I was delighted and honoured this year to be invited back by Lindisfarne’s Ray Laidlaw to perform again at the Sunday For Sammy concert – the 20th anniversary show.\n\nThe two shows were performed again at the huge Newcastle Arena, increasing our capacity to 6,500 people each show, with tickets selling out almost immediately. Brilliantly directed by Geoff Wonfor and put together by the awesome SFS team.\n\nThis year I featured in three hillarious comedy sketches written by Jason Cook, performing them alongside James Baxter, as well as Jason Cook, Craig Conway, Billy Mitchell, Laura Norton, and Vicky Elliot.\n\nIt was, as always, a massive buzz performing in front of a North-East crowd that big, especially for such a brilliant cause, and especially alongside the North-East performing royalty that appeared this year.\n\nAs well as doing what I love best – performing sketch comedy – it’s always a thrill in these shows when the whole cast assembles on stage at the end to accompany Billy Mitchell and Ray Laidlaw in the mammoth Lindisfarne hit ‘Run For Home’. This year we were also joining the legendary Jimmy Nail, who returned to the show after sixteen years away.\n\nYou’ll be able to buy the DVD of the whole show very soon (which I highly recommend!) – details of how and where are here on the Sunday For Sammy website.\n\nThis year’s cast of actors, comedians, and musicians included (in no particular order):\n\nPaul Dunn, Lindisfarne, Tim Healy, Kevin Whately, Christopher Fairbank, Jimmy Nail, Jason Cook, Steffen Peddie, Johnny Vegas, Denise Welsh, Chris Ramsay, Rosie Ramsay, Craig Conway, James Baxter, Vicky Elliot, Laura Norton, Finbar Healy, Louis Healy, Chelsea Halfpenny, Jill Halfpenny, Joe McElderry, Charlie Hardwicke, Angela Goddard, Craig Richardson, Cal Halbert, Lewis Jobson, Peter Peverley, Chris Connel, Ray Stubbs, Trevor Horn, Lorraine Crosby, Kelly Rickard, Jeff Brown, Scott Tyrell."
