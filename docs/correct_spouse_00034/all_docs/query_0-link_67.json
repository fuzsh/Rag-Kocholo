        "text": "The Geordie actress is due to give birth in May -when her actor husband's latest film is released.\n\nCraig Conway, 32, said: \"I can't wait to be a dad, I'm very much looking forward to the birth of our baby, it's such an exciting time. We haven't asked its sex because we'll be happy either way.\"\n\nThe 32-year-old spent about three months on set in South Africa filming Neil Marshall's film Doomsday.\n\nThe movie tells the story of an elite team of soldiers sent to Scotland 30 years after the area has been walled off from the rest of the world, following the outbreak of a deadly virus.\n\nConway, who lives in Northumberland, admitted that it was hard spending such a long time away from his wife and home.\n\n\"Jill couldn't fly out and see me and we only had four days to go back home before we were back filming again, so yes, it was hard and I was ecstatic to be back in the North-East.\""
