        "text": "You’d think even the CSA would be able to track down an actor who’s married to a star of Eastenders and is appearing a major film with Bob Hoskins. It’s not very hard, there he is on the TV. However the CSA had failed to track down actor Craig Conway, husband of Jill Halfpenny.\n\nWith his wife appearing on Strictly Come Dancing and his wedding photos appearing in a national newspaper he should be quite easy to find. The Child Support Agency have now found him (well done guys) but he has yet to pay any money for his ten year old daughter. The girl’s mother, Debbie Jones, hasn’t received a penny from him.\n\nDebbie said in interview with the People:\n\nJill should really have a think about things. While I know Bronwen is not her responsibility, I would like to appeal to her as one mother to another.\n\nPlease encourage Craig to be a part of his little girl’s life. It breaks my heart because Bronwen doesn’t deserve to grow up thinking that her dad doesn’t care about her.\n\nCraig is currently starring in the movie Doomsday alongside British acting legend Bob Hoskins. He met Debbie when she was 16 and left her pregnant when she was just 18. She did meet Craig just after the child was born when he was performing in a play in Newcastle.\n\nWe met up. I showed him pictures of Bronwen and he seemed very excited.\n\nHe said he definitely wanted to be in her life. But he was going to Paris for three weeks so he said I had to wait for him to get in touch. He never did.\n\nUnfortunately for Debbie, and her daughter, the CSA were unable to track down the movie star. It wasn’t until he married Jill Halfpenny and his wedding pics appeared in a national newspaper that the CSA found him.\n\nDebbie explains:\n\nShortly after his wedding was in the papers the CSA tracked him down but he insisted on a DNA test.\n\nDebbie confronted Craig and his new wife Jill when they were in panto together.\n\nWe waited at the stage door for him to come out and when he did he had Jill with him. He just turned round and told her who I was. I asked if we could go somewhere private but he wouldn’t and said he would give me a ring.\n\nAs I’d heard that four years before I knew I had to say my piece to him then and there. I got the impression Jill was shocked by what I said. I have kept cards and love letters from him and I can prove we had a long-term relationship.\n\nHe was the first person I ever slept with, and he knows that.\n\nThe CSA have said that Craig Conway should pay £34 per week, which is a pathetic sum of money for a film actor married to a soap star.\n\nThe CSA said he only earns £225 a week. I find it really hard to believe when he has been starring in massive budget films. I can’t believe he has become so cold hearted. It’s not the boy I grew up with.\n\nMeanwhile Jill Halfpenny, who lives in a £500,000 house in Northumberland said that neither she, nor her family would comment on the story."
