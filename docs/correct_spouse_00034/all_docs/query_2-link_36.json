        "text": "***\n\nThere are two little girls in the photo. I instantly recognise myself as the small, dark-haired child in the purple dress. But who is the girl with the long blonde hair laughing at the camera? And why is the photograph here, in a stranger’s house?\n\nWhen I find the tattered picture hidden away at the back of a dusty cupboard in Amy’s house my mouth goes dry with shock. Though I haven’t known Amy for very long, I love looking after her children, in her perfect hilltop house with its sprawling garden. After feeling lost for months, reeling from the accident that tore everything apart, I hoped this was my chance to turn my life around.\n\nBut I can’t shake the feeling that I’ve been here before. I know this house somehow, the curve of the staircase and the view from the attic window are so familiar. I can feel it in my bones. What isn’t she telling me?\n\nI can’t help noticing things that don’t add up: Amy’s guarded behaviour when I ask questions about her past, the whispered stories I overhear in the village and the locked room downstairs I’m not allowed to enter.\n\nMy mother always told me we didn’t have any family, that it was just the two of us against the world. I’ve always been sure she was hiding something. Finding the photograph, I thought I had it all figured out. But the truth is far worse than I could ever have imagined…\n\nAm I ready to unlock the secrets of my past? Or should I have stayed well away?\n\n***\n\n***\n\nReview\n\nFamily… Isn’t that a beautiful word? The love they feel for each other, the time they spend together… Oh happy days.\n\nLive is not one big party though. Devastating things happen and strong families will stick together during the hard times. Some will not see eye to eye and cracks will appear. They grow bigger and bigger until finally the link is broken and families are ripped apart.\n\nYou feel like you are better off without them than with them if they cannot stand by you. The pain you feel in your heart is so strong and you hope with all you have in you that your child will not remember anything about what went on. You are most determined to not ever talk about it as long as you live.\n\nCoincidences do not exist? I think they do and sometimes it’s a good thing. They can take you where you want to go: on the road to discover some secrets.\n\nThe story is told through the eyes of Lisa, Amy and Julie. Join them on their journey and believe me it’s a very emotional and heart breaking one.\n\nThe liar says they were lied to too. At present I cannot shake the feeling they were still not being honest or am I too suspicious?\n\nI loved it. 5 stars\n\nThank you\n\n***\n\nAbout the author\n\nAli decided she wanted to be a writer early on and wrote her first novel when she was at primary school. She did an English degree and spent her early twenties working in various jobs in journalism, including as a reporter for the show business newspaper The Stage. She started writing fiction in earnest after getting married, moving out of London to the Oxfordshire market town of Abingdon and starting a family. She has two children, a daughter and a son who is autistic and was diagnosed when he was four years old.\n\nAli is fascinated by families, their myths and secrets, and the forces that hold them together, split them up and (sometimes) bring them back together again. She always travels with tissues and a book and has been known to cry over a good story but is also a big fan of the hopeful ending.\n\n***\n\nAuthor Links\n\nTwitter (@AlisonLMercer)\n\nInstagram (@alimercerwriter)\n\nFacebook page (AliMercerwriter)\n\n***\n\n***\n\nBook Links\n\nhttps://geni.us/B09VH9VCB4social\n\nAUDIBLE:\n\nUK: http://ow.ly/62yH50IVH38\n\nUS: http://ow.ly/uxWM50IVH36"
