I cannot cope with these feelings. I just want cessation: the feeling to stop.\"\n\nJill, who was only aged four when her father died, also shared on the “brutal” effect of losing her dad.\n\nThe soap star recalled how he headed out to play a game football and never returned.\n\nAlso, Jill touched on pretended to act happy in front of her family due to their “get on with things” attitude but then she would cry alone in her bedroom.\n\nThe Babylon star confided in Parkinson that she now prefers to deal with her emotions rather than hiding them.\n\nShe said to the host: \"It's been a rough few years but I'm here and talking to you.”\n\nThe actress was previously married to North East actor Craig Conway and has a son."
