One night they get super drunk and have sex.\"\n\nThis narrative arc promises to be explosive, especially considering Lord Grey's unrequited love for Jamie.\n\nDespite the anticipation, some devotees harbour concerns that the television series might diverge from Gabaldon's penned path.\n\nA worried fan confessed: \"I'm excited, but also nervous, because of what I know is coming.\"\n\nOne fan responded: \"I hope they won't f it up and that they will stay very close to the books!\"\n\nAnother chimed in: \"From the photos, it looks like they are following the books, but we'll see. I'll be very disappointed if they f it up.\"\n\nFans of the series are eagerly awaiting the next chapter, having been left in suspense since last August for an update on the Fraser clan."
