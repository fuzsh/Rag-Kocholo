        "text": "Jill Halfpenny will be right at the centre of a 'bitter war' between neighbours for new Channel 5 thriller, The Feud, which has been filming all over the North East for the last few weeks.\n\nClearly a huge favourite with Channel 5 bosses, Jill has now starred in three different channels for the broadcaster, starting with The Drowning, before then appearing in The Holiday, as both series then made their way onto Netflix to become big binge watch hits for the streaming service, Most recently in a big departure from the roles viewers are familiar with her playing, Jill played villain of the piece, Sian, in gripping four part thriller The Cuckoo.\n\nAnd, just as that too is being tipped to make the transition to Netflix, Geordie actress Jill has been on home turf to shoot The Feud, with her and Derry Girls star Jamie Lee O'Donnell being spotted filming scenes in Jarrow over the weekend. The Feud sees Jill play Emma, one half of a married couple, alongside on screen husband Rupert Penry-Jones (Spooks and Our House), who seem to have the perfect life in their dream home with their teenage daughter and friendly neighbours, played by ray Fearon and Amy Nuttall.\n\nREAD MORE: Vera ITV filming sees famous South Shields business' name changed for hit drama\n\nGet all the latest TV and showbiz news and gossip from Chronicle Live with our free newsletter..\n\nHowever, when Jill and Rupert's characters decide to build an extension on their home, relationships spin out of control as objections are raised and life-threatening secrets begin to surface. The Feud is due to air next year, with its cast also including Only Fools and Horses' Raquel, actress Tess Peak Jones, ex Coronation Street star Chris Gascoyne and Gavin & Stacey legend Larry Lamb.\n\nTalking about her new role, ex EastEnders and Waterloo Road star Jill said: \"“The spiral that we see Emma’s world take in The Feud, from one seemingly innocent situation to life altering revelations, is something I can’t wait to dive into. Getting to work in the North East with the teams at Channel 5 and Lonesome Pine, along with the rest of this brilliant cast, is a joy.”"
