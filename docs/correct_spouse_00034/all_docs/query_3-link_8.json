        "text": "A brand new drama is coming to Channel Five tonight where Geordie star Jill Halfpenny's character explores grief and the drastic lengths a mother will go to in order to find out what happened to her son.\n\nThe 45-year-old actress who is best known for her roles on soaps Coronation Street and EastEnders, has opened up about how the impact of losing her partner in 2017 may have prepared her for her latest role in The Drowning.\n\nThe harrowing drama follows a heart-breaking story of a couple rocked by loss in a bid to find out what really happened.\n\nJill felt a personal connection to the role, after her partner Matt Janes tragically suffered a heart attack at the gym and died at the age of 43 in 2017.\n\nTo sign up for the Hull Live newsletter, click here.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the latest series, the actress has opened up about channelling her feelings of loss into her role, The Mirror reports.\n\n\"I haven’t experienced the same loss, but loss is loss and I believe people can grieve just as heavily over the loss of a relationship as of a person,\" Jill told Love Sunday magazine.\n\n\"And as I bring up feelings for the role, I think inevitably some of my own are going to come up as well.\n\nShe added: \"But some aren’t useful for the character and I have to figure out which are mine and which are Jodie’s.\"\n\nIt wasn't until two years after Matt's death that Jill opened up about her devastating loss.\n\nIn an interview with Star TV Jill said: \"She's a messy character.\n\n\"Loosing a child is the worst loss you can suffer, obviously, but Jodie doesn't really know what happened to him.\n\n\"I imagine that would be that would be another layer of torture for her to endure.\""
