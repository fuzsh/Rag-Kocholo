A brief history of Pearson Educational Foundation

In the mid-eighties a group of citizen volunteers interested in the public schools serving youth on the West Island of Montreal established the West Island Educational Foundation (WIEF).

Initially, fundraising was organized to receive donations designed to offer support to our public educational institutions and the students attending them. The Foundation evolved its operation by working in collaboration with individuals as well as community and business organizations to promote diverse innovative projects as well as scholarships and literacy programs.

In 2001 the WIEF changed its name to Pearson Educational Foundation to reflect the current geographical distribution of the schools and centres of the Lester B Pearson School Board.

The Foundation is run by a volunteer board and one full-time paid Operation Manager.

Currently, the foundation injects about $200,000 in new funds annually in support of the LBPSB students. The diversity of the needs, as well as the actual dollar value of the requests, increases every year.
