Photo: Malik Merchant/Simerg\n\nA city with almost a million people has a magnificent nature park in its vicinity with some of the most spectacular foliage that autumn has to offer. A 15 minute drive from downtown Ottawa brings you to the majestic Gatineau Park – a 361 kilometre nature park with 50 lakes, 5 eco-systems, miles of biking and hiking trails, and hundreds of species of birds, plants as well as mammals and trees. Annually, 2.7 million visits are made to the park whose autumn foliage may be compared with the best that the New England States of Vermont and New Hampshire have to offer, albeit on a smaller scale. Gatineau Park has unique shopping and restaurant around its outskirts and in nearby picturesque towns such as Wakefield.\n\nWakefield’s iconic pedestrians’ covered bridge along the Gatineau River. Photo: Malik Merchant/Simerg\n\nFor the intrepid adventurers, in close proximity to Gatineau Park, there is a bungee free fall – North America’s highest – minutes away on the way to Wakefield. Both Gatineau Park and Wakefield also have lots to offer in terms of our history. Canada’s longest serving Prime Minister, Mackenzie King, built an estate in Gatineau Park while Lester Pearson, the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, is buried in Wakefield’s historic MacLaren’s cemetery.\n\n“God Grant that the light of unity may envelop the whole earth.” Photo: Malik Merchant/Simerg\n\nThe 200 feet Great Canadian Bungee site at “The Rock” at Morrison’s Quarry is on the way to Wakefield. It is the highestbungee jump in North America and continues to provide the thrill-of-a-lifetime for thousands each year.

On Saturday, after cloudy skies with some rain for much of the day gave way to the sun late in the afternoon I decided to drive to Pink Lake, a unique spot in the Park to see what it might have to offer on the following day.\n\nSaturday October 11, 2014 – approximately 6:25 pm, sunset time, a quick trip to Pink Lake, to get a feel for the autumn foliage. Photo: Malik Merchant/Simerg\n\nI reached Pink Lake just around sunset (6:25pm) but even with the little sunlight I was convinced that the show of natural autumn colours on the following day was going to breathtaking. I planned to be at Pink Lake, the first major stop from the southern entrance of the Park on the Gatineau Parkway, no later than 11am, that turned out to be too late. The two parking lots serving Pink Lake were packed with cars. Many cars had been parked illegaly alongside the Parkway, so I decided to take a chance. As I got out of the car, a parking warden arrived and told me to immediately remove my car. I left and set off for the Champlain and Heron Lookouts as well drove along the Fortune Lake Parkway, and went as far as Meech Lake and also covered the Camp Fortune Ski areas.\n\nCHAMPLAIN AND HERON LOOKOUTS, FORTUNE LAKE AND GATINEAU PARKWAYS\n\nChamplain and Heron Lookouts offer magnificent views of the Ottawa Valley, the farms and the Ottawa River in the distance. After the lookout points I decided to follow one of my favourite route in the Park which is the Fortune Lake Parkway. This path brings you extremely close to nature in all its aspects. On many an occasion in the past, I have seen artists spending hours by the lake painting their favourite scenes. I had not covered all that I had planned in the Park, so I decided to come back.\n\nChamplain Lookout, Gatineau Park. Photo: Malik Merchant/Simerg.\n\nChamplain Lookout, Gatineau Park.

When I arrived at Pink Lake at about 9am, it was a relief to find the parking lots were not full yet. I spent almost two hours at Pink Lake and was in for a joyful time for the remainder of the day. I took dozens of pictures at Pink Lake, after which I went to the estate of the longest serving Prime Minister of Canada, Mackenzie King.\n\nPink Lake looking East from lookout point just by the Gatineau Parkway.

During a career that spanned some fifty years — almost half of that as prime minister — King guided Canada from semi-colonial status to complete autonomy.\n\n“It has always seemed to me that the highest joy in life is to be found in some form of public service, that instead of the State being indebted to the one who gives of his time and means to the country’s affairs and to the betterment of human conditions, the obligation is the other way round” – last will and testament of Mackenzie King, Canada’s longest serving Prime Minister.

Photo: Malik Merchant/Simerg\n\nResidents of Ottawa should make the most of what they have in their surroundings. Many I have spoken to – and who have lived here for decades – haven’t ever been to Gatineau Park in the Fall Season! I say to them, get a peep of the autumn leaves, and spend some quality time by yourself or your family and friends. It is a truly rewarding experience, and something you will wish to do every year.\n\nPhotos: Malik Merchant/Simerg. Copyright.
