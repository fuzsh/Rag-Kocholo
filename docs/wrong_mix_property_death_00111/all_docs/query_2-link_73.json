        "text": "Gratitude after a difficult 2020\n\nThe term “score” — meaning twenty — is rarely used these days. As a noun with multiple meanings, a score can refer to everything from the total number of points earned in a game, to drugs bought from a dealer, to a musical composition to a sexual conquest. For this article, however, the only score I wish to reference are the 20 things for which I am grateful this year. It has been a difficult 2020, but through it all, these people, places, and things have kept me going. For each of them I am exceptionally thankful. In no particular order, they include:\n\n1) My wife Chantelle\n\nMy wife has been a pillar of strength throughout the year. For most of it, she has worked at home in an office we’ve set up on the top floor of our humble home. Her hours of toiling through Teams calls and taking on numerous challenges at work have been inspirational. She has kept us financially afloat and has balanced so many responsibilities with a sense of humour and poise that amaze me. Without a doubt, she remains a shoe-in for ‘Wife of the Year’!\n\n2) Benjamin, my son\n\nMy son started at a new school in September; his fourth in the past four years. He has had to adapt to much change during this time, but through it all he has remained full of enthusiasm, great questions, and unending curiosity. His resilience, desire to learn, and endless playfulness instil immeasurable pride in me and remind me that the most important job in life is to be a loving parent.\n\n3) My Dad\n\nAt the end of September, we lost my father rather suddenly. He was out for a ride and somehow ended up falling headfirst into the asphalt. No foul play was suspected and despite wearing a helmet, it did not protect him from falling into a coma from which he did not return. My father’s accident took us by surprise as very suddenly he was taken from us. A man full of life and vigour, he was fit and a physically active 88-year-old. He will remain an exemplar of the importance of regular exercise, embracing the beauty of nature, and living life to the fullest.\n\n4) Neighbours\n\nHaving moved into a home we bought at the end of December 2019, we had to once again settle into a neighbourhood. We have been so fortunate to have the wonderful Derry family in the adjacent semi-detached house. Their youngest, Gabriel, and my son have become best friends and having each other to play with during the pandemic has been one of the most special blessings, and a beautiful thing to observe. They have become brothers to one another, and I have enjoyed the periodic end-of-day beers with David, his father.\n\n5) Canada\n\n“Peace, order and good government” are the central tenants of this country’s constitution. This was plainly evident during the pandemic, and I salute the men and women who have been trying to deal with a difficult situation, in particular our government. Under Prime Minister Trudeau, the government has responded admirably to the pandemic and reassured Canadians that they can depend on the government to see them through this crisis. For one, I am grateful for the safety net provided by unemployment insurance and the Canada Recovery Benefit (thanks to legislation that passed with the support of all political parties).\n\n6) Proximity to Family\n\nOne of the reasons we moved from South Africa to Canada was to be closer to family. With my brother in Toronto and my mother in Ottawa, we have been lucky to enjoy lots of great meals together and quality time having out in both cities. I am so happy that I was able to be there for my mum when she most needed it and how we all came together to celebrate my father at his memorial in early November. It has been especially touching to observe the blossoming relationship between my wife and sister-in-law since they have been in the same city together.\n\n7) Local Parks\n\nWe live close to High Park, one of Toronto’s great parks. Extending over 161 ha (400 acres), it is the city’s second largest municipal park and features wonderful paths for hiking and running, areas for dogs to run off-leash, playgrounds for children, ponds for fishing, and even a small zoo. The park was donated to the city in 1873 “for the free use, benefit and enjoyment of the citizens of Toronto for ever” and it remains the best place to witness cherry blossoms in the spring (access to which was limited during the COVID-19 pandemic). As often as possible I enjoy the park as an urban oasis to breathe in fresh air and commune with nature.\n\n8) Optimum Talent\n\nHaving completed a one-year contract with the Mastercard Foundation at the end of March, my employer kindly provided access to the services of Optimum Talent, a talent management firm, to help transition to my next role. Apart from one-on-one consultations with a career counsellor, Lindsey Estenfelder, I was offered the opportunity to participate in a weekly networking group, headed by Debra Adey. These virtual meetings with others seeking employment provided tremendous support, learning, and connection when I felt quite isolated.\n\n9) The Lewis Family\n\nJeff and Lauren lived on our street up until the middle of 2020, when they bought a house and moved to Hamilton. As a couple — and as journalists — they had lived and worked in Alberta prior to moving to Toronto. Their eldest Bennett, my son Ben, and our neighbour’s boy Gabriel were as thick as thieves and regularly ‘terrorized’ the neighbourhood as a three-person gang on scooters. Jeff and Lauren have become friends and we’ve gotten together with them a few times since they relocated, including a couple of wonderful times at their cottage.\n\n10) Nic and Ann\n\nNic is an old friend and he and his wife Ann were instrumental in helping us settle in Toronto at the end of 2018. Their boy Theo, who is a few years younger than Ben, is an absolute delight. One-on-one time with Nic, cycling, and exploring some of the city’s ravines have been some highlights for me.\n\n11) My Son’s Teachers\n\nMs K at King George Primary School and Mrs Tavares at St. Cecelia’s have been absolute stars in educating Ben and helping him feel settled. Consummate professionals and with warm, caring hearts, they have been vital to his adaptation to a new country and culture. Amid all the disruption and uncertainty of the pandemic, both of these women have been rock solid and reliable in their determination to make the school year work, with or without long-distance learning.\n\n12) LinkedIn\n\nAn online social platform that is so much more than a job-hunting tool, I have become an avid user of LinkedIn. Apart from being a valuable outlet to provide my views on different work-related matters, I’ve also been able to learn from my connections and the various courses provided through LinkedIn learning. I look forward to seeing how the platform evolves in the coming years as a more integrated aspect of the Microsoft empire.\n\n13) St. Paul’s Church\n\nOn November 7th we produced a memorial to my father — Dr. Sholto Fletcher Cole —who passed away rather suddenly about a month away from his 89th birthday. While it had a small in-person service at the church, the service was ostensibly put together to cater to an online audience (thanks to COVID-19 restrictions). Led by Minister Wilson and technically produced by Ed Smith from St Paul’s, we pulled it off without a major hitch. The service included kind words from Minister Jack Archibald (the recently retired from St. Paul’s), playing of the organ by Matthew Larkin and eulogies by my brother Doug (in Ottawa) and from Jack Richardson, a longtime friend of my father’s who is based in Boston. Beyond the ceremony, the broader congregation at the church — where my parents have been active members — were unbelievably supportive, especially my mum and dad’s bible study group of multiple decades.\n\n14) Creekside Community\n\nMy parents have been in Creekside, a small neighbourhood near Bayshore Shopping Centre for over two decades. It is a special place with a caring group of neighbours and friends. When my father passed, I was touched by the kindness and care that was offered and how many of individuals from the neighbourhood popped in to pay their condolences. It is heartening to know that my mother is part of this community and that it will provide her with companionship during times when she may feel alone.\n\n15) Podcasters\n\nI have been a big fan of podcasts and over the past year I have come to appreciate the format even more. The shows I listen to regularly include Radiolab, Tim Ferriss, TED Radio Hour, Stuff You Should Know, Freakonomics, and Hidden Brain. This year I also ‘discovered’ Zig Zag, part of the TED network of shows. In one way or another, each of these podcasts provided comfort, support, and insight to help get through a difficult year.\n\n16) Wildlife\n\nWe are lucky to live in a neighbourhood with a fair number of mature trees, including a few standing tall over our backyard. These ‘grandfathers of nature’ provide a home and refuge for many animals including red-tailed hawks, blue jays, cardinals, sparrows, chickadees, and various other birds. We’ve even spotted coyote, red fox and an opossum (North America’s only marsupial). Racoons and squirrels are also plentiful in our area, providing regular entertainment with their antics and bravado. Apart from observing their beautiful busyness, these animals served as reminders of the importance of nature and our dependency upon all that it provides our species.\n\nStruggling as we are through the pandemic, we all need more joy-inducing experiences. Places that excite us and connect us. Artistry that dazzles and brings smiles to faces — young and old — and that even challenge perspectives on the world. Such creations enhance our sense of community, enrich city life, and drive tourism (whenever that is going to come back).\n\nToronto’s Christmas tree — located on Nathan Phillips Square at City Hall — was lit up by Mayor John Tory a few days ago. Today, the Federal Government will mark the beginning of the Christmas Lights Across Canada on Parliament Hill in Ottawa. I will certainly be heading out with my family to admire the lights, but for those more inclined to at-home viewing, the Government of Canada launches its virtual show IllumiNATION on December 17 at 8 pm ET.\n\nAccording to Prime Minister Trudeau:\n\n“This beautiful display also reminds us that there is light at the end of the tunnel, that we will get through this global COVID-19 pandemic, and that we must continue to stand together. Our values of unity and of being there for one another, and our confidence in the future, will allow us to continue working to build an even better Canada.”\n\nAddressing a mental health emergency\n\nWe are living through strange times where buildings sit empty and households self-isolate. Such isolation has created a mental health emergency. According to Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), because of COVID-19:\n\nNearly 1/2 of women (24.3 per cent) are experiencing moderate to severe anxiety, significantly higher than the 17.9 per cent found among men.\n\nParents with children under 18 years of age living at the home were more likely to report feeling depressed (29.1 per cent) than adults without children (18.9 per cent).\n\nApart from the disproportional impact of the pandemic on women and parents, the arts community has been devastated. Organizations like the Canada Council for the Arts are doing what they can to help artists, but more needs to be done. One piece of encouraging news from Ravi Jain, founding artistic director of Why Not Theatre, came recently when he spoke at The Walrus Talks at Home: Living Better online event this month. In his short talk, he touched on an innovative pilot project undertaken through cross-sector partnerships that offered artists empty spaces to enliven and use for artistic purposes. Some encouraging results came from the almost 2,500 hours of free space provided to more than 50 artists who participated in Project Space.\n\nAccording to Jain:\n\n”Artists are among the working poor in Toronto. Every year more and more artists are being driven out of the city by the rising cost of living. Yet their contribution to our city is vital. Artists reignite neighbourhoods, boost economic growth, and make Toronto a more communal and livable place.\n\nCOVID has increased the economic precariousness of most artists, but it can also cause us to rethink how artists might play a role in recovering from the pandemic. We must continue to invest in those who can ignite communities, activate spaces, and unlock the potential of cities and the people who live in them. There is an economic and mental health imperative to do so.\n\nTo maintain our collective sanity we all need more fresh air, sunlight and art. This winter, I encourage all Canadians — as distinct family ‘bubbles’, of course — to put on their masks, bundle up, and head out to soak in the sights (at a respectful distance from one another). It’s also a chance to get some Vitamin D, although I’m not sure how one does so at night when Christmas lights are at their best…\n\n“The future is made by those who can go forth with courage, with adaptability, open minds, learning to discover, to agitate and instigate, and to collaborate and build, always with a bias for action.”\n\nThese are the wise words of Beth Comstock, the first female vice chair of GE and the author of Imagine it Forward. I read her book about a year ago and it still sits with me, especially now in this time of lingering uncertainty and change. A “bias for action” is the bit I really appreciate in the above statement. Throughout her career, Comstock stood up, spoke up, and instigated change. With a Bachelor of Science under her belt, she worked her way up the ranks of corporate America; and for a good part of it as a divorced single mother. Respect!\n\nAs I contemplate the next step in my career, I have observed COVID-19 as a necessary nudge to re-consider how to work, live, and contribute to a better society. The coronavirus has caused me to rethink my priorities and what I look for in a potential employer. It has also brought into light the importance of stories and the role of storytellers, like me.\n\nCOVID-19 has also been — and continues to be — a test of leadership. It has required collaboration and an urgent response to an antigen that has exposed serious systemic risks and flaws in most nations. Responsible leaders have listened and taken necessary and difficult actions to ‘flatten the curve’ based on scientific models and the guidance of experts.\n\nNow, to the Real Crisis…\n\nIn time, the coronavirus crisis will be considered a single event — a manageable pandemic — whereas climate change is a different beast altogether. While COVID-19 is a tangible threat to which we assume we can find a cure, the climate crisis unfolds in different places at different times and in different forms. And while the origin of the coronavirus pandemic is thought to be known, climate change cannot point a finger of blame at a single country for its causes.\n\nThe climate crisis is a global affliction, and humans are the antigens.\n\nWe are also the only species which can do anything about it. The climate crisis is our doing and we must take responsible steps to mitigate its impacts. It is an effort that will require collaboration like that taken to combat COVID-19, but over a longer period of time and on a larger scale. It will take similar sacrifices and life-changing innovation. It will also require strong leadership and the ability to harness powerful stories.\n\nCompared to COVID-19, climate change is a global threat of a completely different scale and timeline, and waiting for more evidence or attacking scientific consensus won’t get us anywhere. We need a similarly urgent, empathic, and collaborative response to this meta crisis. What is more, rather than taking a few months of effort to ‘solve’, climate change will take decades of hard work to alter systems and mindsets in order to alter the trajectory of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.\n\nStories of Hope\n\nTo be sure, when it comes to addressing climate change, the most important changes will be initiated by the actions of public companies. As much as individuals may press for change, businesses will be the mega catalysts in concert with government at all levels. We are already starting to hear these corporate voices and observe leaders willing to evolve the social and environmental priorities of the companies they lead. Examples are emerging around the world:\n\nAmazon’s Climate Pledge, an initiative that commits the world’s largest company, and other companies that sign on, to be net zero carbon by 2040, 10 years before the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe recently released documentary Closing the Loop, featuring sustainability expert Wayne Visser, includes encouraging stories of organizations in Europe, South America, and Africa moving toward a circular economy.\n\nRE100, a global initiative to accelerate the shift to clean energy and zero carbon grids, includes more than 240 of the “world’s most influential companies”.\n\nDriven by a groundswell of consciousness manifested through activities such as The Peoples Climate Movement, the Climate Reality Project, and employees articulating the sort of changes they expect from their employers, companies are waking up to the necessities of taking a more balanced perspective on financial profits and sensible growth.\n\nThe public needs hope; examples of innovation and ingenuity, and tales of progress that tap into a deeper appreciation of human connectivity and systems interdependence. Fortunately, in the face of deeply troubling numbers about the future of the planet, we are starting to witness more hope in the narratives being conveyed by the private sector. As businesses apply a new lens to their roles and responsibilities, they are telling important stories about their values and value in society. Collecting, packaging, and harnessing of these narratives present exciting opportunities for communicators (like me) to have an impact and add value.\n\nWhich brings me back to Beth Comstock, who writes:\n\n“The ability to harness story is what differentiates a good leader from a great one. The story has to bring to life the strategy.”\n\nStrategy is a well-told story\n\nStories are beacons of hope. They have the power to persuade and penetrate the psyches of every human. Shared by transformational leaders, stories can be tools for tremendous change. They can ignite movements, compel voters, and re-orient societies.\n\nApart from occasional skirmishes with dark forces of distraction and deceit, the main role for leaders of public companies will be to tell stories of inspiration. Consider why Tesla has overtaken Toyota as the world’s most valuable auto company or why Microsoft announced earlier this year that it would be carbon negative within the next 10 years.\n\nThese are companies with leaders who articulate strategies based on globally beneficial visions. Their stories of positive change stand out above the din of destruction and denial. Offering a sense of agency and control for the public to affect change — with their investments, spending, and behaviours — such stories are centred on opportunities and options for progress and social advancement.\n\nIn the film referenced above, John Elkington, the ‘godfather of sustainability’, poignantly asks: “Can we project the sort of vision of a future that people will aspire to and want to be part of?”\n\nQuite simply, we need to know that we stand a chance.\n\nIn this time of growing uncertainties and increasing risks, we have the potential for tremendous creativity and innovation. It is a chance to re-new and re-invent so that we come out of the spirit-crushing realities of COVID-19 with a collective optimism. There will be many more crises ahead, but through a process that Comstock refers to as “sensemaking”, individuals and organization have the opportunity to process and understand these challenges by collecting and synthesizing data into new stories and mental frameworks that can make sense of unknowns and ambiguities.\n\nChanges in how we work and live are necessary and inevitable. They will be difficult, but doable. If we ‘turn a corner’ in our energy production and consumption, economies will benefit and we should expect a profound shift in how societies function.\n\nBut in order to turn a corner, one must first slow down, before once again speeding up.\n\nSlowing Down to Speed Up\n\nThis is that time. Engaging thoughtfully and respectfully with those who fear change. Listening with the intention of understanding what others may be missing, afraid of losing, or unsure of. As communicators, we play an important role in this process as we work with leaders to convince others to believe in a future where barriers to change do not seem insurmountable.\n\nAsking probing questions is the starting point to initiating change. We cannot shy away from interrogating opinions, establishing facts, and challenging lies. Curiosity sometimes results in confrontation, but to me, that is better than avoiding conversation for fear of offending anyone.\n\nClimate change may be daunting but from great challenges come great stories. These stories are waiting to be told. Stories of companies embracing change. Leaders leading with more holistic perspectives. Governments acting with long-term plans.\n\nWe need to be bold in finding and sharing these stories. And as networks replace hierarchies, and bureaucracies give way to more decentralization, there is a natural ‘trickle up’ of truth and reconciling past mistakes.\n\nI want to be part of changing the future for the better. So if you are part of an organization looking to improve its communication capabilities, let me know if I can assist with articulating your journey ahead.\n\nOriginally shared on LinkedIn (July 7, 2020).\n\nTwo months from today, James Lovelock, a maverick British scientist and a controversial icon in the environmental movement, will turn 101-years-old. He is most famous for co-developing the Gaia Hypothesis, the belief that our planet is a massive self-regulating organism affecting various interconnected systems — like the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere — that maintain life on Earth.\n\nWith COVID-19, some argue that Gaia is sending us a strong signal to re-evaluate our fundamental values, including to what extent we respect and care for the planet. Is the current pandemic a profound warning that our recklessness and consumption patterns are having profound impacts of Earth’s life-giving systems?\n\nMost understand COVID-19 to be a temporary crisis. Unfortunately, climate change, the meta crisis of our time, is unabating. It is not a momentary concern and certainly won’t be “solved” by human actions alone. We need to collaborate with nature and harness its abilities to counteract the deleterious effects of excessive carbon in our atmosphere.\n\nBuying an electric car won’t do it. Recycling will have a negligible effect, at best. And moving away from fossil fuels as our primary energy source is only the start of what needs to be done. If we are to stand any chance of reversing the concerning trends of rising sea levels and atmospheric C02 concentrations, we need to give Mother Nature a helping hand if we are to make amends for how we have wronged Her.\n\nSounds a bit like penance, doesn’t it?\n\nWe know we are responsible for the increasing levels of greenhouse gases undermining our environment, but are doing relatively little to right our recklessness and desist our destructive ways. And yet, Gaia continues to give so much that we might live.\n\nWondering this — and adopting Lovelock’s unconventional and challenging ways — the prayer below is one of gratitude to Gaia.\n\nThe Earth Prayer\n\nOur Mother, who envelopes us,\n\nGaia is your name;\n\nDaughter of the sun;\n\nA planet unlike any one;\n\nEarth, our solitary haven.\n\nYou sustain life, embrace death;\n\nProvide breathe that then passes\n\nRecovering, reclaiming, rebalancing all.\n\nDefender from solar radiation,\n\nWith armour of invisible air.\n\nFor water is the lifeblood.\n\nPowerful and protective.\n\nFor every creature\n\nLike us.\n\nYou may notice the structure is similar to the Lord’s Prayer, a prayer taught by Jesus to his disciples who requested guidance on how to pray. The Lord’s Prayer, premised on human guilt and a theocentric view of the world, extols God the Father and provides a simple way to repent of one’s evilness. The Earth Prayer, on the other hand, offers a more reverential stance toward the visible and tangible nature of life in the form of Mother Nature, or Gaia.\n\nOur planet depends upon many mysteries, and a subtle balance between calm and chaos. We enjoy a very precise position from the sun that allows for so much to exist on Earth, with a confluence of chemicals and invisible forces that together, achieve something extraordinary called life. I am grateful every day for the wonder around me and the way everything is in flux, unceasingly oscillating between order and disorder.\n\nAnd as we try to figure out the current global challenge before us (caused by the coronavirus), consider that we are on a planet — part of a solar system among hundreds of billions of galaxies — that orbits a middle-aged celestial body whose own corona — or crown — is mysteriously hotter than its surface.\n\nHard as we try, we can’t explain this anomaly. But we certainly appreciate its heat and energy.\n\nAll praise to the Earth, our queen, and our royal sun!\n\nLet us be thankful for the world we live in, including the many mysteries that allow for us to exist.\n\nYesterday was Earth Day so I watched Planet of the Humans, a documentary written, directed, and narrated (poorly) by Jeff Gibbs, an environmentalist and a longtime friend and collaborator of filmmaker Michael Moore.\n\nTo be blunt, the film broke me. Specifically, it fractured my worldview in three ways:\n\nIt revealed the pervasiveness of the ruling elite in manipulating ‘truth’, which stirred a feeling of profound disgust within me.\n\nIt exposed movements, purporting to offer better options to fossil fuels, as dishonest or at least disingenuous about the ‘embeddedness’ of certain corporate interests within them, which left me feeling betrayed.\n\nAnd then there was the final scene. It featured an orangutang in its denuded habitat, at first hanging with its child - confused and exhausted on a leafless tree - and finally extracted - traumatized and lifeless - from the muddy furrow of a decimated landscape. This caused me visceral sadness, and these images and their accompanying vocals still haunt me.\n\nAs someone who considers himself to be relatively environmentally aware and educated, I’m feeling deflated. The global economy is in tatters. I’m sitting at home, unemployed, and questioning my allegiance to leaders of some of the most respected ‘green’ NGOs. (I’m looking at you Bill McKibbon and Al Gore.) Seemingly unaware or intentionally ignorant of the sources of their respective organization’s funding, these individuals appear to lead causes that are not fully transparent with respect to the influence they receive from certain corporate interests. Or so the film implies.\n\nThe movie also takes shots at so-called Socially Responsible Investing. According to the monotonous narrator, certain investment funds position themselves as vehicles to ‘enable a greener future’ but are, in reality, murky collections of exploitative resource companies masquerading as environmentally friendly. Furthermore, the documentary contends that clean energies - fossil fuel alternatives like solar panels and wind turbines - depend upon non-renewable fuels to operate, the extraction of rare minerals, and the devastation of large swaths of land, all in the name of ‘responsible investment'.\n\nIt would seem that renewable energy’s offer of “zero marginal cost” is in question. The documentary raises some serious doubts, contending there are unaccounted externalities in manufacturing green energy components, and that the limited lifecycle renewable power generating technologies depend on non-renewables to function. In short, the film claims that renewables (like wind and solar) have not so much replaced fossil fuels, as they have sidelined them as necessary support fuels to the ‘green revolution’.\n\nFor me, this was not a revelation as much as the film’s exposure of the extent to which biofuels have dominated the renewable energy mix. I was appalled to learn of the destruction of forests in the name of renewable energy and the extent to which these facilities are ‘under the radar’. I had no idea that the vast majority of renewable energy produced in Germany (2019) - a global leader in solar energy - comes from biofuels. The same can be said for most other European countries and all of North America.\n\nThe Climate Reality Project, an initiative led by Al Gore, and of which I am a member, has as its mission to take “urgent action to cut greenhouse gas emissions and speed the global shift to renewables” and to push for “practical clean energy policies”. It makes no mention of biofuels. Why is that given their dominance among renewables?\n\nCurrently, global wealth is in free-fall and most countries are in the midst of a downward debt spiral as a result of COVID-19. And as the world attempt to decarbonize - as it must - demand for fossil fuels has plummeted. Presumably renewable energy projects will continue to be deployed post-Coronavirus, and transport will continue to become more efficient and electrified. Fossil-fuel companies - currently with severely depressed stock prices - will have their assets ‘stranded’, a troubling future for a fossil fuel exporting nation such as Canada, if not the global economy.\n\nIs the Carbon Bubble about to burst? Are we at an inflection point where additional investments in green energy (supported by subsidies) will merely result in negative environmental returns?\n\nSo much is unclear and precarious at this time that it is hard to remain positive about the future. But as a father of a five-year-old, I have to be. If he asks, I need to look him in the eyes and tell him “everything is going to be OK. The current situation is just temporary.”\n\nBut is it?\n\nI’m not sure, but what is clear is that we are going to see more the frequent and destructive climate-related disasters. Where will that leave governments, insurance companies, and everyday citizens is even more troubling.\n\nThe illusion of unlimited growth on a planet of finite resources is settling in.\n\nWhen are we going to rescue ourselves from ourselves?\n\nThe actor, filmmaker, and composer Charlie Chaplin (who would have been 131 years old on Thursday) was born a few days before Adolph Hitler. I’ve only watched a few of Chaplin’s films, but the one that stands out for me is The Great Dictator (1940), which culminates in a powerful speech about humanity and how “we have lost the way”. It is a collection of words that I wish came from the mouth of a real politician rather than an actor playing a barber mistaken for a despot. It was Chaplin’s first film with dialogue and to me, it spoke a thousand truths, all pertinent to our current predicament.\n\nConsider some of the brilliance of this speech, noting that the film was released about a year after England declared war and WWII was getting underway, with the U.S. not yet involved.\n\n“We want to live by each other’s happiness — not by each other’s misery. We don’t want to hate and despise one another.”\n\nChaplin believes in the goodness in everyone, and each individual’s propensity for love and care. The collective desire for happiness and freedom are innate to us all. And while he is speaking about the realities of war and how it depends on lies and deception to convince humans to kill each other, the abstraction of a pandemic is analogous. We face a common enemy that must be defeated through a shared effort. An effort of caring for one another and better appreciating the global connectedness of humanity.\n\n“Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness.”\n\nAs many of us find ourselves shut inside and unable to work as we wish or are used to, Chaplin reminds us of the dangers of allowing our hearts to be superseded by the ‘logic’ of the mind. He warns us that the desire for economic progress — capitalist ideals — are a threat to our shared wellness. All smarts, profits, and technological achievements pale in comparison to the importance of selflessness and care. We are, after all, a social species. A people who have survived millennia because of our ability to collaborate, recognizing the interdependence on one another.\n\n“To those who can hear me, I say — do not despair…Let us fight for a new world — a decent world that will give men a chance to work — that will give youth a future and old age a security. … a world where science and progress will lead to all men’s happiness.”\n\nWow. This is a clarion call for a rethink of how many societies work. Chaplin dreams of equity, opportunity, as well as a social safety net. Imagine a world where governments, individuals, non-profits, and businesses did not step in to pick up those who have tripped, help to heal those who have fallen ill, or given a chance to individuals with little hope of succeeding against extraordinary odds? The numbers are daunting:\n\nGlobally, the richest 10% own 82% of global wealth. The bottom half of wealth holders collectively account for less than 1% of total global wealth (The Global Wealth Report 2019 — Credit Suisse).\n\nThe African-American infant mortality rate is twice the rate for white infants (The Century Foundation).\n\nIn Canada, Indigenous people living on-reserve face Tuberculosis rates more than 40 times higher than among non-Indigenous people (Health Equity).\n\nThe number of Americans without any health insurance rose to 27.5 million Americans (8.5% of the population) in 2018, even while the poverty rate was its lowest since 2001 (U.S. Census).\n\nYesterday, Lady Gaga helped orchestrate a global event called One World: Together at Home. It was an exceptional example of humanity coming together and supporting the work of the World Health Organization, a very necessary global body that needs more support and collaboration to defend our planet from pandemics like COVID-19. Thank you to all the entertainers and leaders who collaborated on this project.\n\nThe world is facing a challenging time, but it doesn’t mean we can’t be grateful for all we have. We must believe that love and hope will prevail as we combat the coronavirus. Let us all take heed of the words of Charlie Chaplin, an artist, a leader, and an activist who’s words ring true as much as they did 80 years ago.\n\nKindness is a boomerang and gratitude is contagious.\n\nWhen I Next Cross the Atlantic…\n\nEthiopia is one African country I dream of visiting. From the mysterious churches of Lalibela to the ancient city of Gonder, there is a rich history to appreciate within her borders. Natural beauty abounds, from Lake Turkana to the Simien Mountains that hide elusive creatures like the Walia ibex and gelada (otherwise known as the ‘bleeding heart baboon’).\n\nBut it’s her people I really long to see. In the face of tremendous economic development, the traditional ways of life practiced by different Tribes in Ethiopia have been maintained. The Suri are some of these people.\n\nGazing upon the photograph in my calendar, I see a person whose culture is under threat. Undoubtedly, her experience of life is different from mine and my appearance is quite a strange sight to her. She has a number of traditions that I don’t understand, but would love to appreciate.\n\nMy ‘Future Fear’\n\nBehind the floral patterns delicately drawn with clay paints is also a face, serious and fearful. I see a woman whose way of life is being infiltrated by ‘modern life’ and by foreigners, like me. As much as her culture and traditions of decorative lip plates and scarification are under threat, I too am fearful.\n\nWhat sort of future does Africa face? While Western countries struggle to come to terms with the thread of the coronavirus, what lies ahead for a continent that has been under appreciated and over-exploited? Healthcare systems are buckling under the pressure of the global pandemic and I worry about many African nations’ capacity to respond to the crisis.\n\nAre we approaching an anti-travel world where “stay home” and protectionism will result in closed borders? Will our fear of the unfamiliar - and difference in general - lead to keep us from cross-cultural engagement? Are we going to become so concerned with the potential of infection that we resist the urge to engage with strangers?\n\nI hope not.\n\nIn the meantime, I will keep dreaming of travel and Africa, praying that the travel industry will, one day, return to ‘normal’.\n\nOn a cold April morning 103 years ago today, 15,000 Canadian infantry jumped out of muddy trenches and ventured into no man’s land. The odds were atrocious. More than 100,000 soldiers had already died trying to take Vimy Ridge, a strategic piece of real estate in the French countryside occupied by German forces.\n\nFor the first time, four Canadian divisions (as in not representing Her Majesty) were amassed to fight a seemingly invulnerable enemy, hidden from view, and equipped with significant killing power. Having practiced and taken on specialized roles, carefully timed waves of soldiers attacked, preceded by significant artillery pounding enemy positions.\n\nThree days later - and with more than 10,000 Canadians injured and nearly 3,600 killed - victory was achieved. It was a defining moment for Canada and an example I believe we should hold up during the current global battle against COVID-19.\n\nComing Together\n\nOver a century ago, Canadian soldiers faced, in many ways, what all of us are facing today. In our own ‘trenches’ at home, we are being asked to virtually come together to fight an invisible enemy. We are being asked, for the first time, to make sacrifices and to collaborate, allowing the specialists in medicine, science, epidemiology and other fields to fight a pernicious virus. While we do not face a barrage of machine-gun fire, the threat to our lives is real. Some of us - particularly the infirm and elderly - may not survive this battle, but if we act together, we will advance against what our Prime Minister has asked of us all (including our children).\n\nIndeed, the efforts of millions of us, holed up in our homes, are what will ensure we effectively counter this pandemic. A vaccine is coming, but for now, this is how we can fight: listen to orders and do our part to stay home (a relatively small ask, methinks).\n\nOur respective and collective responsibilities to work together, and eventually, to prevail, should unite us as they did for those brave Canadian soldiers more than one hundred years ago.\n\nToday, the Canadian National Vimy Memorial symbolizes Canada’s long commitment to peace in the world, its stand for liberty, and the rule of international law. As much as the sacrifices of thousands of men who stepped out of their trenches won’t be forgotten, we can’t forget the important role we all play in combating the invisible foe before us.\n\nLest we forget. Let us unite."
