These partners are the front-line workers who handle the redistribution of our donated tickets to the children and youth in our communities. We dedicate a significant portion of our programming schedule to: recruiting, orientating, and evaluating our partner agencies to maximize our program’s efficiency and accountability. We simply couldn’t do what we do without the dedication and commitments of our wonderful Community Agencies!\n\nIf youâre a representative for a child-serving program in the Ottawa area, and youâre interested in a community partnership with Kids Up Front, your first step to enrollment is completing this Agency Application Form and submitting it to: [email protected]."
