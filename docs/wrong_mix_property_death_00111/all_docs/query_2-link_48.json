        "text": "The Treaty or Peace Tablet\n\nA CENTURY OF PEACE\n\nSECURED BY SIMPLE DISARMAMENT\n\nPROCLAIMED BY PRESIDENT MONROE, APRIL 28, 1818, AND STILL IN FULL FORCE, THE RUSH-BAGOT AGREEMENT IS THE MOST ENDURING AND FATEFUL RESULT OF THE WAR OF 1812.\n\nIT HAS SAVED MANY MILLIONS IN MONEY AND PROB-ABLY MANY THOUSANDS OF LIVES BY MAINTAINING IN PERFECT PEACE FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY THREE THOU-SAND MILES OF FRONTIER BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE BRITISH EMPIRE WITHOUT SOLDIER OR SHIP, WITHOUT FORTRESS OR GUN.\n\nIT HAS BEEN THE DECIDING INFLUENCE IN CARRYING THESE TWO GREAT NATIONS IN PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP THROUGH FOUR CRISES, ANY ONE OF WHICH, WITHOUT IT, WOULD PROBABLY HAVE RESULTED IN DESTRUCTIVE WAR.\n\nBECAUSE THIS MEMORIALIS DEDICATED TO COM-MEMORATION OF VICTORY IN WAR NOT MORE THAN TO THE TRIUMPH OF ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF PEACE WITH OUR TRUSTED CANADIAN NEIGHBORS. THIS, THE SHORTEST OF TREATIES BETWEEN GREAT NATIONS IS WRITTEN HERE IN FULL, IN ENDURING BRONZE, TO BE READ BY ALL THE PEOPLE.\n\nTHE AGREEMENT\n\nTHE NAVAL FORCE TO BE MAINTAINED UPON THE AMERICAN LAKES BY HIS MAJESTY AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES SHALL HENCEFORTH BE CONFINED TO THE FOLLOWING VESSELS ON EACH SIDE, THAT IS –\n\nON LAKE ONTARIO, TO ONE VESSEL NOT EXCEEDING ONE HUNDRED TONS BURDEN, AND ARMED WITH ONE EIGHTEEN-POUND CANNON.\n\nON THE UPPER LAKES, TO TWO VESSELS NOT EX- CEEDING LIKE BURDEN EACH, AND ARMED WITH LIKE FORCE.\n\nON THE WATERS OF LALE CHAMPLAIN, TO ONE VESSEL NOT EXCEEDING LIKE BURDEN, AND ARMED WITH LIKE FORCE.\n\nALL OTHER ARMED VESSELS ON THOSE LAKES SHALL BE FORTHWITH DISMANTLED AND NO OTHER VESSEL OF WAR SHALL BE THERE BUILT OR ARMED.\n\nIF EITHER PARTY SHOULD BE HEREAFTER DESIROUS OF ANNULLING THIS STIPULATION, AND SHOULD GIVE NOTICE TO THAT EFFECT TO THE OTHER PARTY IT SHALL CEASE TO BE BINDING AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF SIX MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SUCH NOTICE.\n\nThe Taft Tablet\n\nTHE SIGNIFICANCE\n\nOF THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE\n\nIS REMARKABLE, NOT SO MUCH IN ITS\n\nDETAILS AND IN THE COURAGE DISPLAYED\n\nUPON EACH SIDE BY THOSE WHO PARTICI-\n\nPATED, BUT IN THE NOTEWORTHY FACT\n\nTHAT IT FURNISHES THE “TERMINUS A QUO” OF A\n\nCENTURY OF PEACE WITH THAT\n\nPOWER AGAINST WHICH WE HAD FOUGHT\n\nTWO WARS LASTING EIGHT YEARS OF THE\n\nPREVIOUS TWENTY-FIVE.\n\nDESPITE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR NAVAL\n\nWARFARE ON THE WATER BOUNDARY BE-\n\nTWEEN CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES\n\nFROM DULUTH TO MONTREAL, AND THE\n\nCONSEQUENT TEMPTATION TO MAKE THOSE\n\nWATERS BRISTLE WITH FORMIDABLE\n\nFLEETS IN TIMES OF PEACE, TO MEET THE\n\nEXIGENCIES OF POSSIBLE WAR. THOSE\n\nWATERS DURING THE WHOLE CENTURY\n\nJUST PAST HAVE BEEN, BY AGREEMENT\n\nBETWEEN THE NATIONS, WHOLLY FREE\n\nFROM SUCH DOGS OF WAR AND THE BEAU-\n\nTIFUL SHORES ON EACH SIDE OF THIS\n\nNATURAL BOUNDARY HAVE NOT BEEN VEXED\n\nWITH BEETLING ARMAMENTS.\n\nIN THE PRESENT MOVEMENT, BROUGHT\n\nON BY THE CONSCIENCE OF THE WORLD,\n\nTO SECURE RELIEF FROM WAR AND THE\n\nBURDEN OF ITS PREPARATIONS, THIS\n\nCONDITION, EFFECTED BY INTERNATIONAL\n\nAGREEMENT, FURNISHES AN INSTRUCTIVE\n\nLESSON.\n\nWILLIAM TAFT\n\nNEW HAVEN, CONN.\n\nJUNE 27, 1913."
