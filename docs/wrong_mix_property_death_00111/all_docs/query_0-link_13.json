They handle applications, conduct interviews, and choose students to represent their country at UWC institutions. However, if you’re from a country that doesn’t have a UWC National Committee, don’t worry! UWC offers the Global Selections Program for students like you. This program allows exceptional students from such countries to apply directly to UWC schools and colleges, providing an alternative pathway for admission.\n\nNational Committee Selections\n\nUWC NATIONAL COMMITTEE OF CANADA\n\nFIND YOUR UWC NATIONAL COMMITTEE\n\nUWC Global Selection Program\n\nLatest News\n\nCALD Program celebrates first cohort student graduates\n\nBy Jineane Eason, Senior Manager, Donor Engagement & Gift Planning In May, we welcomed guests, teachers, and supporters to...\n\nread more\n\nCommunity Unites for Special Screening of “UnCharitable”\n\nBack in early May, we had the pleasure of hosting a special event that brought together members of the Greater Victoria...\n\nread more\n\nOur students’ future begins with you\n\nPearson College UWC is more than just a school.
