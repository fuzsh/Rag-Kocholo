        "text": "GOVERNMENT NOTICES\n\nDEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE\n\nCONSULTATIONS ON POTENTIAL FREE TRADE AGREEMENT NEGOTIATIONS WITH TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP MEMBERS\n\nThe Government of Canada is seeking the views of Canadians on the scope of possible free trade negotiations between Canada and Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) members, which include\n\nAustralia\n\nBrunei Darussalam\n\nChile (see footnote 1)\n\nMalaysia\n\nNew Zealand\n\nPeru (see footnote 2)\n\nSingapore\n\nUnited States (see footnote 3)\n\nVietnam\n\nAdditional countries have also expressed their interest in consultations on joining the discussions:\n\nJapan\n\nMexico (see footnote 4)\n\nThis notice is part of the Government of Canada’s domestic consultation process with business, citizen-based organizations and individual Canadians, as well as with provincial and territorial governments, to obtain advice and views on priorities, objectives and concerns to help outline the parameters of this initiative.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a free trade agreement under negotiation to liberalize trade in the Asia-Pacific region. Nine countries are currently participating in the negotiations: Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam and the United States. Japan and Mexico have recently announced their intentions to begin consultations to join the TPP. With the participation of Canada, Mexico and Japan, the TPP would represent a market of more than 775 million people and a combined GDP of $25.7 trillion (or US$24.9 trillion) — a market larger than the European Union.\n\nThe intent of TPP negotiators is to create an ambitious, high-standard regional free trade agreement that covers a wide range of areas related to trade and investment. On November 12, 2011, leaders of the TPP member countries meeting in Honolulu, Hawaii, for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum announced the achievement of a broad outline of an agreement that would enhance trade and investment, promote innovation, economic growth and development, and create and sustain jobs. Nine rounds of negotiations have taken place.\n\nFollowing review of the November 2011 outline released by TPP members, Canada notes the high degree of complementarity between what is being pursued in the TPP and the approach Canada takes in its own trade negotiations.\n\nAdditional information on the TPP can be found at www.ustr.gov/tpp (in English only).\n\nSubmissions by interested parties\n\nThe Government is embarking on a public consultation process to allow all interested stakeholders an early opportunity to provide comments, input and advice on possible free trade negotiations with TPP countries (current nine members and other interested countries: Japan and Mexico). It is essential that the Government of Canada be fully aware of the interests and potential sensitivities of Canadians with respect to this initiative. We welcome advice and views on any priorities, objectives and concerns relating to possible free trade negotiations with TPP countries. In particular, we are seeking views with respect to the following:\n\nOpinions on areas of goods export interest (identified by Harmonized System [HS]/Tariff codes, if possible), including products that would benefit from the early removal of tariffs and other barriers by TPP countries.\n\nViews on market access liberalization for TPP countries products (identified by HS/Tariff codes, if possible) into the Canadian market, including input on those products for which the elimination of tariffs should be expedited or phased-in over time.\n\nAdvice and views on trade in services, particularly the identification of sectors/activities of export interest for Canadian service providers, and opinions on domestic regulatory measures that restrict or otherwise affect market access for Canadian service providers.\n\nAdvice, views and experiences regarding the temporary entry of business persons from Canada into TPP countries and into Canada from TPP countries (e.g. impediments to entering or working in TPP countries on a temporary basis, including licensing or certification requirements at the border).\n\nAdvice, views and experiences regarding measures affecting exports destined for TPP countries, including non-tariff barriers (such as import licensing), technical barriers to trade (including technical regulations, standards and/or conformity assessment procedures) and sanitary and phytosanitary measures.\n\nViews on general rules of origin and/or advice on appropriate rules of origin for specific products or sectors.\n\nAdvice on “trade facilitation” issues (e.g. significant impediments related to import procedures).\n\nAdvice, views and experiences with customs procedures and with commercial goods entering and/or leaving TPP countries.\n\nAdvice, views and experiences regarding investment barriers faced by Canadian investors in TPP countries, including restrictions imposed on foreign ownership or entry to market, questions of transparency of regulation, performance requirements (i.e. local content requirements, use of local labour and services), and any other impediments/barriers.\n\nAdvice and views on government procurement markets of interest to Canadian suppliers and exporters to TPP countries, including the government departments, agencies or enterprises of interest and the goods, services or construction services that Canadian suppliers are interested in selling to those government organizations. Note that participation in government procurement may include bidding as the prime contractor or exporting goods and/or services to the prime contractor who in turn bids on government contracts.\n\nAdvice, views and experiences regarding barriers (e.g. availability and transparency of information, domestic preferences) when selling or attempting to sell to governments of TPP countries.\n\nViews and experiences with the protection of intellectual property rights.\n\nAdvice and views on competition policy matters, including development of possible cooperation mechanisms.\n\nViews on capacity-building measures that could assist developing countries in achieving the objectives of the agreement.\n\nViews on ways to reflect the interests and values of Canadians in the area of sustainable development, environmental protection and conservation.\n\nViews on ways to reflect the interests and values of Canadians in the areas of workers’ rights, human rights, transparency in business and commercial practices and other social concerns, as they relate to TPP countries.\n\nViews on other related issues not mentioned above.\n\nAll interested parties are invited to submit their views by February 14, 2012. Please be advised that any information received as a result of this consultation will be considered as public information, unless explicitly stated otherwise. Submissions should include\n\nthe contributor’s name and address and, if applicable, his/her organization, institution or business;\n\nthe specific issues being addressed; and\n\nprecise information on the rationale for the positions taken, including any significant impact it may have on Canada’s domestic or foreign interests.\n\nContributions can be sent by email to consultations@ international.gc.ca, by fax to 613-944-3489 or by mail to Trade Negotiations Consultations (TPP), Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada, Trade Policy and Negotiations Division II (TPW), Lester B.

In 1995, Bill C-54 gave Review Tribunals additional jurisdiction to hear appeals under the Old Age Security Act. The Review Tribunals were created as a body independent from government that would make determinations regarding eligibility for persons claiming benefits under the acts mentioned above.\n\nWhen a person claiming entitlement to a benefit is not satisfied with the decision made by Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, that person may appeal to a Review Tribunal under section 82 of the Canada Pension Plan or section 28 of the Old Age Security Act.\n\nA Review Tribunal is an independent body of three people selected by the Commissioner of Review Tribunals from a Panel of up to 400 individuals appointed by the Governor in Council. The Review Tribunal conducts a hearing and makes a decision regarding the eligibility for benefits in individual cases.\n\nThe Office of the Commissioner is an independent, quasi-judicial body which has the responsibility of ensuring that hearings are carried out by Review Tribunal Panel Members in communities across the country. The Office of the Commissioner also has responsibility for providing legal advice, technical support, training and other assistance to Panel Members and for ensuring that all parties to an appeal are provided with the proper documentation, notices, and other material that might be necessary to ensure fair and impartial hearings.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner assists the Commissioner in the management of the organization and the establishment of partnerships with the various stakeholders in order to achieve its goals and commitment to dealing with each party in an appeal with sensitivity, understanding, respect and dignity.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner exercises all of the Commissioner’s powers when the Commissioner is absent, most notably that of directing the activities of the Office which include establishing and providing logistical support to Review Tribunals and setting the hearing calendar. The Deputy Commissioner plays a significant role in the training of Review Tribunal members and in the assessment of their performance.\n\nThe successful candidate will have a degree from a recognized university in a relevant field of study or a combination of equivalent education, job-related training and/or experience. A degree in law would be considered an asset.\n\nThe preferred candidate will have experience as a member, legal counsel or manager of an administrative tribunal or experience in representing parties at hearings of courts or tribunals or in alternate dispute resolution processes. He or she will also have experience interpreting and applying legislation and case law and conducting training. Experience in preparing performance evaluation reports on employees or tribunal members is also required. Executive-level experience in a private or public sector organization, including the management of financial and human resources would be considered an asset.\n\nKnowledge of the legislated mandate and operations of the Office of the Commissioner of Review Tribunals, the Canada Pension Plan, the Old Age Security Act, the Review Tribunal Rules of Procedure and other related federal legislation is required. Knowledge of appeal processes and the implications of the decisions made by the Review Tribunals as well as knowledge of the procedures and practices associated with conducting a quasi-judicial hearing and of the legal principles involved, particularly as they relate to evidence, legal interpretation and natural justice, are required. Familiarity with the operation of an administrative tribunal, including the rules that govern its operations, would be considered an asset.\n\nThe successful candidate will have the ability to interpret complex legislation and to ensure that decisions are rendered in accordance with applicable law in addition to possessing excellent interpersonal and managerial skills to lead and motivate staff and to ensure the Review Tribunals adhere to the highest standards of accountability and transparency. He or she will also adhere to high ethical standards and have the ability to promote collaborative decision-making in order to foster consistency in the decisions of the Review Tribunals.\n\nAdditionally, the preferred candidate will exercise sound judgment, integrity, tact and discretion, as well as possess the ability to think strategically and anticipate trends. The ability to communicate effectively, both orally and in writing is essential.\n\nProficiency in both official languages is preferred.\n\nThe successful candidate must be prepared to relocate to the National Capital Region or to a location within reasonable commuting distance and be willing to travel regularly to attend hearings and various other conferences and meetings in all parts of Canada.\n\nThe Government is committed to ensuring that its appointments are representative of Canada’s regions and official languages, as well as of women, Aboriginal peoples, disabled persons and visible minorities.\n\nThe preferred candidate must comply with the Ethical and Political Activity Guidelines for Public Office Holders. The guidelines are available on the Governor in Council Appointments Web site, under “Reference Material,” at www.appointments-nominations.gc.ca.\n\nThe selected candidate will be subject to the Conflict of Interest Act. Public Office Holders appointed on a full-time basis must submit to the Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner, within 60 days of appointment, a Confidential Report in which they disclose all of their assets, liabilities and outside activities. For more information, please visit the Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner’s Web site at http://ciec-ccie.gc.ca.\n\nThis notice has been placed in the Canada Gazette to assist the Governor in Council in identifying qualified candidates for this position. It is not, however, intended to be the sole means of recruitment.\n\nFurther details about this organization and its activities can be found on its Web site at www.ocrt-bctr.gc.ca.\n\nInterested candidates should forward their curriculum vitae by January 27, 2012, to the Assistant Secretary to the Cabinet (Senior Personnel), Privy Council Office, 59 Sparks Street, 1st Floor, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0A3, 613-957-5006 (fax), GICA-NGEC@ bnet.pco-bcp.gc.ca (email).\n\nEnglish and French notices of vacancies will be produced in an alternative format (audio cassette, diskette, Braille, large print, etc.) upon request.
