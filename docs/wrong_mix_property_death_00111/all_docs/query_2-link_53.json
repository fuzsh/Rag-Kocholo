Established in 1982.\n\nUniversity Medal at the Master's Level\n\nAwarded at each convocation ceremony, when merited, to a graduating student for outstanding academic achievement at the master's level. Established in 1982.\n\nAwards Policy\n\nIn recent years Carleton graduate students have been increasingly successful in winning highly competitive external scholarships. These include: the Doctoral Fellowship from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC), the Postgraduate Scholarships (Master’s and Doctoral) and Industrial Postgraduate Scholarship (IPS) from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), the SSHRC Canada Graduate Scholarship (CGS) Scholarships (Master’s and Doctoral), as well as Canada Graduate Scholarships (CGS) from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR). The Province of Ontario provides funding for the Ontario Graduate Scholarships (OGS), and the Ontario Graduate Scholarships in Science and Technology (OGSST) for students enrolled in graduate programs in Ontario institutions.\n\nIn addition, the University itself provides generous support, and the majority of graduate students receive funds from this source.\n\nStudents who hold such awards must pay regular tuition fees unless otherwise stated.\n\nFull-time graduate students at Carleton University are expected to comply with the following procedure. Any full-time graduate student who accepts an award that is not directly administered by Carleton University must immediately inform his/her departmental chair and the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research in writing. This requirement applies to any awards or assistance offered by any agency or institution.\n\nApplication Deadlines\n\nFor information on the specific deadlines for applications to be considered for financial assistance, please visit the online application site by selecting the \"Apply Online\" link from the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research website at www.gs.carleton.ca. In the online application site, application deadlines can be found on the left hand navigation under \"Program Deadlines\".\n\nStudents who receive offers of funding from the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research are required to respond to the offer within 30 days of date of the letter.\n\nMethod of Payment\n\nAll awards administered by Carleton are paid on the 15th and the 30th of each month. The exception is the first month of each term (September, January, May) when all awards are paid at the end of the month. Students receiving awards of any kind are urged to note the above payment dates and be prepared to be financially self-sufficient during these months.\n\nIn addition, students receiving teaching assistantships, scholarships, or any other kind of award or bursary should note that the deadlines for payroll may differ from the registration deadlines. In the first month of each term (September, January and May) students must have completed registration, including finalizing arrangements for the payment of fees, no later than the 15th of the month, in order to be eligible to receive payments at the end of the month.\n\nEligibility\n\nIn the case of fellowships, grants, scholarships, etc., for which students must make application, it is the individual student's responsibility to establish his/her eligibility. Should it become known that a student is unqualified for any reason, he/she must return the funds already received, with the University assuming no responsibility.\n\nDepartments recommending students for internal awards must accept full responsibility for the eligibility of their nominees.\n\nStudents are urged to consult carefully the brochures and announcements that specify the conditions associated with tenure of individual awards.\n\nThis information is available in the office of the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research and in departmental offices.\n\nAwards Administered by Carleton University\n\nThe awards administered by Carleton University are derived from a variety of sources. Throughout the years, a number of individuals and organizations have contributed substantial funds to the University, through bequests and donations, in order to help support students in various fields of study.\n\nThese sums, together with the assistantship funds made available from the University budget, make up the reservoir from which the Carleton scholarships and assistantships are drawn.\n\nIt is not always possible to identify precisely the sources of various donations and bequests (often small, but most important in the aggregate) from which any graduate student's financial support has been constructed. In the following cases, however, either because of the relative importance of the contribution or because of the fact that it is earmarked for a specific type of student or program, we do identify the external source from which the award has originated.\n\nPlease refer to the Graduate Studies and Research Web site at: www.gs.carleton.ca for a complete, current listing of all awards available to graduate students. Unless stated otherwise, graduate students must be registered full-time in the term in which the award is held in order to be eligible to receive the awards listed below.\n\nDick Abbott Memorial Bursary\n\nAwarded annually to a graduate student in the School of Public Administration who is in need of financial assistance.
