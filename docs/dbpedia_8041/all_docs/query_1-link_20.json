        "text": "Victor Hugo was a French poet and novelist, and one of the most influential persons of the French Romantic movement. Two of his most famous works are Les Misérables and Notre-Dame de Paris (commonly known in English as The Hunchback of Notre-Dame).\n\nIn September 1908, Indiana Jones was punished by his tutor, Miss Seymour for staying out too late one night, by having to spend the day inside his room at Hotel Lepic reading Les Misérables. Jones remarked sarcastically that it was a great title. It is unlikely that he finished the novel before he slipped out in the evening to go to a party with Norman Rockwell.\n\nA street in Monte Carlo was named after Victor Hugo in his honor.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nThe Young Indiana Jones Chronicles – \"Paris, September 1908\" → Passion for Life (Mentioned only)\n\nIndiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis (Indirect mention)\n\n[]"
