        "text": "Profession: Author\n\nBiography: Victor Hugo was a French writer best known for his novels The Hunchback of Notre-Dame (1831) and Les Misérables (1862). He is widely regarded as one of most significant French writers of all time.\n\nWithin France, Hugo is also known for his poetry. His works have since given rise to famous operas and musicals, perhaps most notably Les Misérables which was initially adapted and premiered in 1980.\n\nHugo also involved himself in political activity during his lifetime, which can be seen reflected in his fictional work, as well as producing a large number of drawings.\n\nBorn: February 26, 1802\n\nBirthplace: Besançon, France\n\nStar Sign: Pisces"
