        "text": "LIFE\n\nThe dubbing machine, invented by Frank Capps, a Columbia employee still in the phonograph game, was a jealously guarded secret. But we just had to speed up production if we were to make any real money out of the Edisonia, Ltd., business; so Vic [Emerson] put his head together with old Carson [no doubt Charles W. Carson is meant], his handy man, and Russell Hunting, his assistant. ........... It wasn't long before they had independently worked out another dubbing-process. Passing our laboratory late one song-plugging night, I saw a light in the loft. Curiosity drew me up the stairs.\n\nThere were the three allies [Emerson, Carson and Hunting] engaged in the big experiment.\n\nThey had exactly balanced two of the wax cylinders, so that a pressure in the center caused a ball or stylus to impress both simultaneously. It was now possible to make fourteen records at a round. A big advance!\n\n(from: They all sang: from Tony Pastor to Rudy VallÃ©e - as told to Abbott J. Liebling by Edward B. Marks. New York: Viking Press, 1935)\n\n1900 CENSUS (Newark, Essex, NJ):\n\nVictor EMERSON ( y)\n\nKittie EMERSON ( y)\n\n- (Victor) Hugo ( y)\n\n- Adelbert ( y)\n\n- Edna ( y)\n\n1920 CENSUS:\n\nVictor EMERSON ( y) mechanic phonograph\n\n1930 CENSUS:\n\nVictor EMERSON ( y) phonograph business\n\n- Victor Jr. (17y)\n\n- Edna (15y)"
