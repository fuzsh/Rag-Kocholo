        "text": "1802-1885 • France\n\nPoet • Monarchist • Republican • Exile\n\nPoet, dramatist and novelist of the Romantic movement, Hugo is considered to be one of the greatest French writers. In the 21st century he is globally famous for Notre-Dame de Paris (renamed The Hunchback of Notre Dame by the English publisher) and the novel turned into films, TV series, stage shows and the French language (1980) and English language (1985) musicals, Les Misérables.\n\nHugo’s life was a journey, both physical and political. He travelled widely in Europe but spent around 20 years in exile from France in the Channel Islands. Politically he moved from being a teenage monarchist to a Napoleon Bonaparte sympathiser and in the second half of his 83-year-long life to becoming a republican who chose to be taken to his grave at the Panthéon in Paris in a pauper’s coffin (Bradley Stephens, 2019).\n\nOne of Hugo’s many biographers began his 700-page study describing his life as full of contradictions: ‘the militant monarchist and the revolutionary socialist; the symbol of a corrupt aristocracy and defender of the misérables; a repressor of revolts and instigator of riots’ (Graham Robb, 1997). An American detective story writer (Cara Black, 1999) appears disappointed to find his flat in the Place des Vosges didn’t reflect socialist taste: ‘The room captured his essence, dark and narcissistic. The only touch that could be called socialist was the heavy peasant glassware on a mahogany sideboard’.\n\nWhile calling Hugo a ‘socialist’, a ‘revolutionary’ and ‘instigator or riots’ is a misuse of language, his life, his two decades-long exile and his poetry and novels ultimately helped embed France’s republican system of government in a way that involves a more or less explicit acknowledgement of the need for some form of equality.\n\nVictor-Marie Hugo was born in his father’s then garrison town, Besançon, on February 26 1802 (nine months after the date 24 06 01 Hugo later assigned as the prison number of Jean Valjean, his principal character in Les Misérables). The first name Victor given the baby Hugo acknowledged Colonel Victor De Lahorie, who had paved the way for Léopold Hugo‘s return to active duty.\n\nEight months later Hugo’s mother, Sophie Trébuchet, took Victor-Marie and his two elder brothers to Paris, effectively separating from their father, Major Léopold Hugo. They moved initially to the Rue Neuve-des-Petits-Champs (since 1944 the Rue Danielle Casanova) Rue de Clichy\n\nwas elected to the Second and the Third Republic’s national assemblies in 1848 and in 1870. His political life, locations and loves were a journey.\n\nHuge celebrations were held in Paris on 28 February 1882 to celebrate Victor Hugo’s 80th birthday. An estimated 600,000 people paraded beneath his windows at 124, avenue Victor Hugo, that had been renamed in his honour the year before. This was where he died on 22 May 1885.\n\nHugo’s entry into the mausoleum for ‘the great men of France’ was the first in half a century. The beleaguered Republican government of the day resisted the protests of the Catholic Bishop of Paris who complained not only that Hugo had refused to go through the last rites with a Catholic priest, but also that the building was still a consecrated Church.\n\nVictor was born into an internally combatative and dysfunctional family: he was the son of a soldier promoted to General under Napoleon I and of a mother who had supported the Catholic Bourbon anti-revolutionary revolt in the Vendée region. His godfather was another General who was executed for plotting against Napoleon in 1812 after having been hidden for months from Napoleon’s police by his lover, Victor’s mother.\n\nThe young Victor and his two older brothers Abel and Eugene, went to live with their mother at 24 Rue de Clichy in 1804.\n\nMore info\n\nLocations"
