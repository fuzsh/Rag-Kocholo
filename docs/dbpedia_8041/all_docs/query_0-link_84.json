        "text": "Faster, Higher, Stronger? “Go USA!!!” is a phrase many Americans cheer as they watch in anticipation the Olympic Games at home. Many of us enjoy watching sports and will cheer on our country’s athletes while the Olympics are taking place. However, for the upcoming Olympics in Rio, there has been massive controversy over whether they should even take place. Many problems have flooded Brazil recently and organizations like the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and…\n\nImmigration is an issue that established nations have been dealing with for decades. The first question that we have to ask is why do people emigrate? Well, according to Anup Shap, emigration happens from a result of warfare or persecution; it could come from financial prospects and the allure of a better life in an industrialized nation. For other people, simply they choose to leave their country and want to live somewhere else. There are many different arguments supporting and refuting…\n\nThe debate over the rights of immigrants or refugees remains unresolved and countries seem to be increasingly hostile towards these groups of individuals. Though the issue of immigration is often debated with emphasis purely on the economic effects of immigration, I believe that often the social side of immigration is forgotten. When we debate legislation, we speak about the jobs that immigrants might take, but we never speak about the way in which an immigrant’s family unit is affected by the…\n\nEvery day thousands of people are leaving behind their home countries to move away for one reason or another. With each individual that enters into a new country, there are different challenges, new experiences, and new opportunities for them. Leaving behind everything a person knows can be very daunting and sometimes very difficult to assimilate to the new society. From young children into adulthood, everyone has had a desire to feel like they belong somewhere. The efforts to fit into a certain…\n\nVisiting Paris, France have always been a great desire for me. There is not one specific reason to explain this desire, but rather a collection of things that draw my specific attention to Paris. Perhaps my first visit to Republic of Congo and the French language being their lingua franca got me intrigued. I love to experience the original French cuisine, the art, the fashion, the architecture, and everything Paris has to offer and their smooth language. Also I have always brought up this ideal…\n\nThe video is about Georges Pompidou center. At 1969 when Georges Pompidou became the president of France he aimed to build a culture center in the downtown of Paris that contain a vast library, art museum, design center, and institute of contemporary music. Therefore, he organized an architecture competition, and for the first time in France, the outlandish architects were allowed to participate. Between six hundred and eighty-one design, this design has been choosing. This design is by the two…\n\n1-The Eiffel Tower(Paris) It built in 1889.The Eiffel Tower (nickname the iron lady) named with it’s engineer.His name is Gustave Eiffel.It built for Expo 1889 Paris Fair.It has became a global icon of France.It’s three hundred meters high and one hundred twenty five meters wide.It is the tallest building in Paris.Every day millions of tourists visit here and see this wonderful structure. 2-The Great Wall of China Chinese Emperor Si-Huangti constructed the great Wall of the China in B.C(Before…\n\ngiven to the U.S by France in the year 1886. The entire Statue was completed in Paris between 1881 and 1884, with the help of tons of workers working ten hour days, seven days a week for nine years. It was completed in 1885, disassembled into 350 pieces, and then…\n\nWhile a large distance may separate Carolina and the West Indies these two places could be said to be exactly identical in the 18th century. Places in the West Indies quickly found a quick production in sugar that translated to large amounts of wealth. However the need for land was not suitable on the West Indie islands. In an effort to attempt to find more land the elite planters made way to America to try to create a new colony but of similar taste as the West Indies. This system in the West…\n\nLoisel just “went along” with the proposal of her husband. This is a negative connotation and presents her as an immature and childish person. Some might say she agreed just for the money and a better life. She was a middle class woman in 19th century France when women were not allowed to control their life and the only way to be someone was to be wanted by a man. However, when you are…"
