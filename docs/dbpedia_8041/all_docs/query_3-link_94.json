        "text": "An article by Mélody Speisser, Isabelle Massy de la Chesneraye and Laura Amert\n\nThe musical and its worldwide success\n\nDo you remember the famous novel written in 1862 by Victor Hugo? This fascinating but huge piece of art, in 5 parts, which makes its readers dive into 19th century France and the Paris Uprising of 1832? Yes, that’s right, we are talking about one of the great classics of French literature: Les Misérables. But the fame and popularity of this novel has grown far beyond the French borders. It is mostly due to the British world-famous musical, with the same title, created by Cameron Mackintosh and Herbert Kretzmer in 1982. Let’s go back a moment to its creation…\n\nOur story begins in 1980, in France, when three men, Claude-Michel Schönberg, Alain Boublil and Jean-Marc Natel, decided to adapt the novel of Victor Hugo into a musical. Natel and Boublil wrote the lyrics while Schönberg composed the music; soon, the first representation took place in Paris, in the Palais des Sports.\n\nTwo years later, Cameron Mackintosh was given the album of this musical and even though his French was not that great, he was stunned and amazed by the power of the melody and theatrical atmosphere after listening to only four songs (1) . Mackintosh was already well known for having produced some great musicals such as Cats. Therefore, he decided to go to Paris to find Boublil and Schönberg, because he wanted, not only to buy the rights of adaptation, but to work in collaboration with them, which surprised the two French creators (2) . To translate the lyrics of the songs into English, he chose Herbert Kretzmer.\n\nThen, in London, in 1985, the musical was played for the first time in the Barbican centre. It was the beginning of a worldwide success. With over 120 million spectators in 52 countries, translated in 22 languages, Les Miserables has become one of the most popular musicals on the planet. Still today, after 35 years, this musical is played in London and has not lost its popularity.\n\nHow to explain the success?\n\nThe early success of Victor Hugo’s novel\n\nTo understand the fame of Les Misérables, the musical in the anglophone world, you must first consider the success of the original novel which has managed to remain in the collective memory.\n\nHugo’s Les Misérables, published in France in February 1862, was translated in English the same year, notably by Charles Wilbour for the American version which was released in the Union before it leaked in the southern Confederate States. The novel which circulated in the South was somehow censored though, as David Bellos (author of The Novel of the Century ‒ The Extraordinary Adventure of Les Misérables, 2017) explains (3) . Hugo’s novel was not just a story about 1832 revolutionary events in France but also conveyed the author’s opposition to slavery and the death penalty. These opinions which didn’t fit in with the ideology of the Confederacy were removed. During the Civil War, Les Misérables was very appreciated by soldiers who would read it together around campfires.\n\nBellos adds that since the book was published under its original title, a pronunciation mistake enhanced its success among southern fighters. Indeed “Les” sounded like [leez] and it reminded them of General Robert E. Lee, one of the Confederacy leaders. Thus, the soldiers who began to feel they were losing the war thought of the novel as a reflection of their own fate and started calling themselves “Lee’s Miserables”. Generally speaking, the characters in the novel are easy to identify to since they refer to ancient figures which are very familiar to the reader; for example Bellos mentions Jean Valjean who evokes models like Hercules.\n\nFinally, Bellos explains that the very construction of the novel by Hugo made it highly suitable for stage adaptations, because the scenes are often theatre-like. Moreover, it occurred that word-for-word translation of the novel sometimes rendered the wrong meaning, which luckily enough allowed truly spectacular staging features (e.g. “galérien” translated “galley slave” instead of “convict” gave an opportunity to stage maritime scenes).\n\nThe reasons behind the success of the musical\n\nWhy does this successful novel triumph as a musical? Is it because of the staging? Of the cast? Of course, these elements do have a role to play, but they can’t be the only explanation: Les Misérables was played thousands of times around the globe with different staging and actors, who always had different tones. However, some ingredients necessarily stay because they embody the essence of the musical and They have caused incredible enthusiasm around Les Misérables.\n\nTalking about musicals means talking about music. Les Misérables is no exception: its score is amazing. Solos as well as chorus songs are either catchy, full of vitality or touching. We experience the deepest sorrow when Fantine sings « I Dreamed a Dream », with Eponine’s « On my Own » we suffer the pain and the loneliness caused by an unrequited love, and through « Do you hear the People Sing » we feel like revolutionaries fighting for a better world. But the score is not only deep, it’s also subtle because it shapes the structure of the musical. Thus, each character and each type of action — social injustice, disappointed hope or identity crisis — has its own motifs. This helps to follow the story and to connect the scenes together (4) .\n\nThe plot is another ingredient of success. Indeed, there is a real story with archetypal characters, which help the identification along. Moreover, the stage adaptation is well-constructed: through allipsis, it avoids any potentially boring lengthy bit and focuses on key scenes that belong to collective memory. The musical is also more optimistic than the novel: despite its tragic dimension, one comes out of the show full of hope and this is why we love it.\n\nFinally, Les Misérables speaks to everyone because it is universal and timeless. Even today, the story remains contemporary; there are still “miserables” around the globe, people suffering of poverty and injustice who dream of a better life. This was Hugo’s intention when he wrote his novel: to write for a universal audience. The musical made this intention come true."
