        "meta_description": "Download this stock image (alb5407591) from album-online.com - Victor Marie Hugo (February 26, 1802 - May 22, 1885) was a French poet, novelist, and dramatist of the Romantic movement, and considered the greatest French author of all-time. His best-known works are the novels Les Miserables and The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. Because of his concern for the rights of artists and copyright, he was a founding member of the Association Litt√©raire et Artistique Internationale, which led to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. His novels as well as his plays have been a great source of inspiration for musicians, stirring them to create not only opera and ballet but musical theatre. Attributed to Francois-Joseph Heim, 1835 (cropped and cleaned).",
