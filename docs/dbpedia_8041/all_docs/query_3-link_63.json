        "text": "A visit to the Maison de Victor Hugo is included in most guided tours of the Marais district and on literary tours of Paris. The museum focuses on his life before, during, and after his self-imposed exile from 1860s Napoleonic France. Visitors can tour the rooms—sumptuously decorated by Hugo himself, who had an interest in interior decor—in which he wrote and lived from 1832 to 1848, including the bed he passed away in from pneumonia.\n\nThe Maison de Victor Hugo contains manuscripts and correspondence belonging to Hugo and even some first editions of his work. Temporary exhibitions pertain to the author’s life, and an immense library is open to the public by appointment.\n\nThe Maison de Victor Hugo is a must-see for literary buffs andLes Miserable fans.\n\nAdmission to the permanent exhibit is free, but there is a charge to view the temporary exhibits.\n\nThe house is wheelchair accessible, and wheelchairs are available at the reception area.\n\nThe metro is the easiest way to get around Paris. Taking metro line 1, 5, or 8 to the Bastille stop will get you within a 5-minute walk of the Maison de Victor Hugo. Driving is not recommended since finding parking is difficult, but parking spots are available at the museum for disabled visitors.\n\nThe Maison de Victor Hugo is open to visitors daily except for Mondays and French holidays. If you’re interested in the temporary exhibits or talks and special workshops the museum organizes for young visitors, check the museum website to see what special events are happening during your visit.\n\nOriginally known as the Place Royale, the Place des Vosges is the oldest planned square in Paris, built by Henri IV in the early 1600s. This beautifully manicured park, surrounded by 17th-century townhomes including the Maison de Victor Hugo, is the perfect spot to enjoy a picnic lunch after touring the museum."
