        "text": "Victor Hugo was a renowned French writer, poet, and playwright, best known for his novels \"Les Misérables\" and \"The Hunchback of Notre-Dame.\" He was born on February 26, 1802, in Besançon, France, into a royalist and Catholic family. Hugo's early life was marked by literary accomplishments, and he published his first collection of poems at the age of 20.\n\nThroughout his life, Hugo was politically active, advocating for social and political change. He was a leading proponent of Romanticism in French literature and was a member of the French Academy. In 1831, he published \"The Hunchback of Notre-Dame,\" which became a classic of French literature.\n\nHowever, Hugo's most significant work is often considered to be \"Les Misérables,\" published in 1862. The novel explores themes of justice, love, and redemption in the context of 19th-century France. It has been adapted into numerous films, musicals, and plays.\n\nIn addition to his literary achievements, Hugo was also involved in politics. He opposed the authoritarian rule of Napoleon III and was exiled from France for his political beliefs. He spent several years in exile in Guernsey, a British Crown dependency, where he continued to write and create some of his notable works.\n\nVictor Hugo returned to France after the fall of Napoleon III’s regime and continued his literary and political activities. He died on May 22, 1885, at the age of 83, leaving behind a legacy of influential literature and social activism."
