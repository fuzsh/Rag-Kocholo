        "text": "Victor Hugo was one of the greatest French authors of the 19th century. He is best known for his works of Romantic literature, such as ‘Les Misérables’ and ‘The Hunchback of Notre Dame.’\n\nHugo also wrote poetry, plays, and essays. His life was marked by tragedy, great successes, and a powerful legacy that continues to be felt today. Today, he is primarily associated with French Romanticism, but he was interested in far more than that. In fact, he accomplished a great deal of both prose and verse during his life, as well as philosophical texts and more than 4,000 drawings.\n\nFamous Books by Victor Hugo\n\nLes Misérables – Published in 1862, this powerful novel is set in France and tells the story of ex-convict Jean Valjean, the struggles he faces with the law and society, and his attempts to redeem himself.\n\nThe Hunchback of Notre Dame – Written in 1831, this work tells the tragic story of Quasimodo, the deformed bell-ringer of Notre Dame. Through Quasimodo’s experiences, Hugo examines themes of love and justice.\n\nThe Toilers of the Sea – Published in 1866, this novel follows the story of a young man trying to save a shipwrecked vessel off the coast of Guernsey. It deals with themes of humanity’s struggle against the forces of nature.\n\nThe Man Who Laughs – Written in 1869, this novel is set in the early 1700s and follows the story of Gwynplaine, a disfigured man whose face has been carved into a permanent smile. The novel examines themes of identity and justice.\n\nNinety-Three – Published in 1874, this novel is set during the Reign of Terror and tells the story of a group of French revolutionaries who are trying to protect their land from an invading army. It explores themes of loyalty and faith.\n\nEarly Life\n\nVictor Hugo was born on February 26, 1802, in Besançon, France. His father was a high-ranking officer in the French army. Victor Hugo’s mother was a well-known local women of society. Victor was their second child. As a young boy, Victor attended a Lycée in Paris for his primary education, and he quickly showed a talent for writing.\n\nBy the age of twenty, he had written and published his first book of poetry, ‘Odes et poésies diverses.’ His writing style focused on themes of nature, love, and liberty, often described as “Romanticism.” After the publication of this work, Hugo quickly became a popular figure in French literary circles. He would eventually go on to become one of the most renowned authors of all time.\n\nLiterary Career\n\nLater Life and Death\n\nVictor Hugo’s later life was characterized by continued success and recognition. He was elected to the French National Assembly in 1848, and he remained an important political figure until his death. In 1871, Hugo moved to the Channel Islands due to the rise of Napoleon III and a growing distrust of him in France.\n\nDuring this period, he wrote some of his most famous works, including ‘Les Miserables.’ He returned to France in 1879, and his later life was filled with honors and accolades. Victor Hugo passed away on May 22, 1885, at the age of 83. He was buried in the Pantheon in Paris, where he had been enshrined as a national hero.\n\nLiterature by Victor Hugo\n\nExplore literature by Victor Hugo below, created by the team at Book Analysis."
