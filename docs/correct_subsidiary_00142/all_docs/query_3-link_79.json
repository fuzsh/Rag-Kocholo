In fact, the risk of transformation failure can fall anywhere between 70% and 95%. So how do you make sure that you are part of the 5% to 30% that successfully realize the intended value from transformation efforts? Proper change management will make or break your transformation.

But, success in this exponential era will require the visualization and implementation of a new IT operating model. This model is broken into three sections:\n\n1. Provides centralized technology standards around security and architecture and works to ensure the development of critical tech talent.\n\n2. Focuses on how cross-organization services are designed and enabled to ensure services are using the right IT capabilities.\n\n3. Elevates and embeds IT strategy, IT governance, and data with the organization's strategic layer to ensure consistency in direction and accessibility to insight.\n\nIn this keynote presentation on the next-generation IT operating model, we will provide IT leaders with the insight and foundation they need to establish to reimagine the ways in which IT capabilities are functionally aligned to deliver value in the ever-accelerating autonomization paradigm.\n\nSpeakers:\n\nBrittany Lutes\n\nValue-Driven IT CIO\n\nIT Spend and Staffing Benchmarking: Realign Resources for Success\n\nJoin this engaging keynote to explore the critical importance of an IT spend and staffing assessment.

If you stay, you face limited product choices, increased costs, and the spectre of decreased support and product innovation. If you leave, where do you go? Public cloud? Hybrid cloud? Greenlake? Apex? Nutanix? Promox? Hyper-V? Scale.io? PoCs take time and the clock is ticking, but each option comes with its own set of operational and organizational risks for you to identify and mitigate. If all this looks unsurmountable, maybe staying and adapting to a higher cost model by extracting more value out of product platforms you’ve been forced to buy is the better course?

With the emergence of new technologies, changing expectations from customers and constituents, and services that require cross-organization collaboration, IT has never been more important in ensuring the organization's success in reaching its vision and objectives. But, success in this exponential era will require the visualization and implementation of a new IT operating model. This model is broken into three sections:\n\n1. Provides centralized technology standards around security and architecture and works to ensure the development of critical tech talent.\n\n2. Focuses on how cross-organization services are designed and enabled to ensure services are using the right IT capabilities.\n\n3. Elevates and embeds IT strategy, IT governance, and data with the organization's strategic layer to ensure consistency in direction and accessibility to insight.\n\nIn this presentation on the next-generation IT operating model, we will provide IT leaders with the insight and foundation they need to establish to reimagine the ways in which IT capabilities are functionally aligned to deliver value in the ever-accelerating autonomization paradigm.\n\nSpeakers:\n\nBrittany Lutes\n\nCarlene McCubbin\n\nLeadership, Learning & Development Enterprise Architecture\n\nDevelop Your Next Enterprise Architect Lead From In-House Talent\n\nOur Talent Trends Report says Enterprise Architecture Leads are among the hardest roles to recruit.

This results in bloated technology spend and a wasteful and disorganized portfolio of applications. In fact, our research indicates that less than one-third of the applications in portfolios are considered both important and effective.\n\nIn this presentation, we will tackle solutions to this problem by exploring two key elements: how do organizations ensure they have the right technology and technology partners in their portfolios, and how do they measure if they were effective in selecting those partners?\n\nSpeakers:\n\nBen Dickie\n\nMahmoud Ramin\n\nExponential IT All Roles\n\nM&G 2.0: What Has Changed\n\nSpeakers:\n\nJack Hakimian\n\nAI Marketplace Security & Privacy\n\nAssess the Impact of AI on Privacy\n\nAs AI and privacy evolve, adapting privacy impact assessments (PIAs) is essential.

Join this session to learn best practices for assessing the privacy impacts of new AI technologies.\n\nSpeakers:\n\nSafayat Moahamad\n\nJai Hebel\n\nAaron Shum\n\nClient Panel Value-Driven IT Security & Privacy\n\nDe-Accelerate the Erosion Over Time of Your Security Maturity With These Tips\n\nAchieving an appropriate maturity in your security posture is difficult and expensive, but maintaining static good maturity is a myth. As an off-shoot to Moore’s Law, research shows that ongoing maturity degradation occurs related to ongoing improvements in technology – “If you’re standing still, you’re going backwards.” Don't miss this panel discussion to learn some of the key approaches for slowing this degradation and allowing your strategic initiatives roadmap to keep pace with the corresponding changes in the threat landscape.\n\nSpeakers:\n\nBob Smock\n\nRalph Johnson, CISO at WaTech (Washington Technology Solutions)\n\nStacey Wallace, CISO at Arizona Department of Revenue\n\nJamie Giroux, CISO at Platinum Equity\n\nBlack Professionals in IT All Roles\n\nLeading in Uncertainty: Navigating the Glass Cliff\n\nThis client panel is geared to everyone and goes beyond the glass ceiling and explores the \"glass cliff.\" We'll explore unique challenges faced by our panel of Black leaders in IT, particularly when promoted during times of crisis and uncertainty.

Exponential growth of technology is forcing organizations to value multi-dimensional investments in IT and the elevation of CSIOs, CTOs, CAIOs, and CDOs to the highest levels of the organization is diluting the role of the traditional CIO. Should the CIO be an overarching leader of technology with umbrella leadership over all related roles, or is there an emerging model for multiple technology leaders to steer an autonomized organization? Join us as we explore the answers to these questions in this expert panel discussion.\n\nSpeakers:\n\nMark Roman\n\nLightning Round Exhibitors\n\nSwimm; Chata.ai; PiLog Group Lighting Session\n\nExpert Panel Women Leading IT All Roles\n\nActivating Networks for Personal Growth\n\nJoin us for an engaging panel discussion on how to create powerful professional networks.
