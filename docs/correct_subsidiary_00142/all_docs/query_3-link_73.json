It has been reported that Broccoli and Spinach are RNA aptamers that bind to GFP fluorophore (DFHBI) and switch on the fluorescence [\n\n22\n\nFilonov G.S.\n\nMoon J.D.\n\nSvensen N.\n\nJaffrey S.R.\n\nBroccoli: rapid selection of an RNA mimic of green fluorescent protein by fluorescence-based selection and directed evolution.\n\n,\n\n34\n\nStrack R.L.\n\nSong W.\n\nJaffrey S.R.\n\nUsing Spinach-based sensors for fluorescence imaging of intracellular metabolites and proteins in living bacteria.\n\n. Broccoli is a 49-nt-long aptamer that was developed based on SELEX protocol which exhibits bright green fluorescence upon binding DFHBI or the improved version of this fluorophore, (Z)-4-(3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene)-2-methyl-1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-1H-imidazol-5(4H)-one) (DFHBI-1T) (DFHBI-1T).[\n\n35\n\nSong W.\n\nStrack R.L.\n\nSvensen N.\n\nJaffrey S.R.\n\nPlug-and-play fluorophores extend the spectral properties of Spinach.\n\n] It has been reported that RNA aptamers can be added to CFE reactions (like Broccoli or Spinach aptamer) to monitor the dynamics of mRNA synthesis.[\n\n25\n\nMarshall R.\n\nNoireaux V.\n\nSynthetic biology with an all e. coli txtl system: Quantitative characterization of regulatory elements and gene circuits.\n\n] RNA aptamers bind to specific dyes, which only fluoresce when they are bound to the mRNA. To express fluorescent RNA aptamers, we prepared the reaction solutions based on manufacturer's instructions. Then Broccoli aptamer DNA template (pTXTL-P70a-Broccoli) at different concentrations (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10 nM) were added. To make sure the concentration of the dye is always in excess to synthesized RNA, 40 μM of DFHB1-1T was added for Broccoli RNA aptamer. The transcription dynamics was quantified by measuring fluorescence intensity with the excitation/emission wavelength at 488/525 nm every three minutes for two hours. The synthesized mRNA concentrations were calculated according to the calibration curve, Fig. S2. Furthermore, we examined synthesized mRNA concentrations at different DNA concentrations. After two hours of incubation, the synthesized mRNA obtained were 0.08 μM, 0.32 μM, 0.97 μM, 3.54 μM, and 10.1 μM at DNA concentrations of 0.5 nM, 1 nM, 2 nM, 5 nM, and 10 nM, respectively, Fig. 1C. The mRNA expression dynamics were modeled using our model. The synthesized mRNA concentrations versus time were plotted, Fig. 2B. The kinetic constants were estimated based on literature and our experimental results, Table S2. The modeling results showed a similar profile of mRNA synthesis dynamics compared to our experimental results. The profile of synthesized mRNA is referred to hyperbolic and demonstrated saturation after 1.5 hours. We next calculated the mRNA production rate: [mRNA] production rate [μM/min] = (fluorescence intensity at current time point – fluorescence intensity at previous time point) / time interval. For single promoter regulations, the production rate of ‘broccoli’ mRNA was calculated and compared, Fig. 1D. The results indicate that synthesized mRNA was produced continuously over the first two hours of the period. The ‘broccoli’ production rate increased in the first 30 minutes and decreased sharply afterward due to mRNA degradation. After two hours, the synthesized mRNA concentration reached to the peak, with the lowest mRNA production rate (about 0 μM/min).\n\n3.2 Modeling and characterization of kinetic dynamics of protein expression in E. coli-based CFE system\n\nWe next investigated the kinetic dynamics of protein synthesis in an E. coli-based CFE system using two circuits. One is a single promotor p70-deGFP, the other one is a two-stage transcriptional activation cascade using sigma 28 (σ28). Both circuits start with a specific sigma promotor, sigma 70, which is present in the cytoplasmic extract. The translation was first modeled and characterized with a single promotor p70-deGFP, Fig. 2A. To model the kinetic dynamics of translation, the biophysical model was utilized, including Eq. (1-3). The synthesized protein concentrations were modeled with different plasmid DNA concentrations, ranging from 1 nM to 10 nM, Fig. 2B. Based on this biophysical model, the synthesized protein concentrations with the DNA concentrations of 1 nM, 5 nM, and 10 nM were 1.5 μM, 6.7 μM, and 14.8 μM. We further characterized protein synthesis dynamics in the E.coli-based CFE system. Fig. 2C shows protein expression kinetics with different p70a-deGFP concentrations, ranging from 0.5 nM to 10 nM. A negative control was used when there were no DNA plasmids added. Compared to the modeling results (Fig. 2B), experimental results showed a saturation after ∼ 3 hours of incubation, which was caused by the limited resources and energy in CFE master mix. The protein production increased within the first three hours. Protein synthesis as a function of DNA template is only linear with the DNA concentration from 1 nM to 5 nM, Fig. S5. Without DNA plasmids, the protein synthesis is negligible. The production rate was calculated as [deGFP] production rate [µM/min] = (fluorescence intensity at current time point – fluorescence intensity at previous time point)/time interval. The fluorescence intensity was then converted to μM based on the calibration curve, Fig. S3. The production rate versus time was plotted, as shown in Fig. 2D. The protein production rate increased in the first hour and slowed down gradually, indicating that the protein synthesis depends on the DNA concentrations and resources in the master mix. It has been reported that gene expression in CFE systems is independent of the resources only for a short period of time (1∼2 hours for conventional systems).[\n\n13\n\nShin J.\n\nNoireaux V.\n\nAn E. coli cell-free expression toolbox: application to synthetic gene circuits and artificial cells.\n\n] The kinetics of gene expression can be altered by the decrease of the energy charge, degradation of amino acids, and pH change during transcription and translation reactions.\n\nThis biophysical model was further utilized to simulate a two-stage transcriptional activation cascade with E. coli sigma 28 (σ28) transcription factor, as illustrated in Fig. 3A. Transcriptional activation cascades are simple gene circuits that require expression of a transcription factor, including sigma 19, 24, 28, 54, and 70, to activate the expression of fluorescent protein (deGFP, mCherry, or RFP) [\n\n36\n\nZhou Z.\n\nHossain M.S.\n\nLiu D.\n\nInvolvement of the long noncoding RNA H19 in osteogenic differentiation and bone regeneration.\n\n]. Here, in our circuit, there are two steps of transcription and translation. We first need to activate the expression of sigma factor 28, which is required to activate the next transcription and translation process to produce deGFP, Fig. 3A. To model this two-stage transcriptional activation cascade, we developed six differentiation equations based on our simple model, (Supplementary Information). Fig. 3B showed the modeling results of synthesized protein expression in transcriptional activation cascade based on different DNA concentrations ranging from 1 nM to 10 nM. Based on these two-stage transcription translation processes, the synthesized protein in this transcription activation cascade are 1.1 nM, 2.02 nM, 5.5 nM, and 11 nM with the DNA concentrations of 1 nM, 2 nM, 5 nM, and 10 nM, respectively. The kinetic dynamics of protein synthesis in this two-stage cascade showed a translation delay due to the generation of sigma 28, which is required for the activation of deGFP. Next, we characterized this cascade using E. coli-based CFE systems. In this cascade reaction, there are two DNA plasmids, pTXTL-P70a-S28, and pTXTL-P28a-deGFP. The concentration of pTXTL-P70a-S28 was set to 0.05 nM for comparison. By adjusting the DNA (pTXTL-P28a-deGFP) concentrations (0.5 nM, 1 nM, 2 nM, 5 nM, and 10 nM), the dynamics of synthesized deGFP were monitored over the period of ∼ 3 hours with an interval of 3 minutes. A negative control was designed when there was no DNA presented. The fluorescence intensity of synthesized deGFP were measured using excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 525 nm, respectively. The measured fluorescence intensity was then converted to deGFP concentrations based on the calibration curve, Fig. S3. With the DNA concentrations of 0.5 nM, 1 nM, 2 nM, 5 nM, and 10 nM, the synthesized deGFP are calculated as 0.25 nM, 0.34 nM, 1.2 nM, 7.2 nM, and 11.5 nM, respectively. The production rate was calculated as [deGFP] production rate [µM/min] = (intensity at current time point – intensity at previous time point)/time interval. The production rate dynamics with different DNA concentrations were plotted, Fig. 3D. The production rate was increased gradually in the first hour and was slowed down for the rest of the reaction period, indicating that the protein synthesis depends on the DNA concentrations and resources in the master mix. In this two-stage transcription activation cascade, there are two limiting factors for the generation of deGFP, one is the pTXTL-P70a-S28 DNA concentration, and the other one is pTXTL-P28-deGFP concentration. The highest production rate can reach 0.3 μM/min with a DNA concentration of 10 nM. The kinetic dynamics of deGFP expression of this two-stage transcription translation cascade are similar to single promoter deGFP protein synthesis dynamics. A 10-30 minutes delay was observed for sigma 28 transcriptional activation cascaded compared to the expression of deGFP from a sigma promoter P70, a typical time for such two-stage cascades.[\n\n37\n\nNoireaux V.\n\nBar-Ziv R.\n\nLibchaber A.\n\nPrinciples of cell-free genetic circuit assembly.\n\n] Compared to the modeling result, the synthesized deGFP increased sharply and gradually decreased over the 3 hours duration, Fig. 3B-3C. However, the modeling result showed a gradual increase in protein concentration. This difference was mainly caused by two reasons: 1) during the initial preparation of the CFE reaction solution, the sigma 28 transcription factor could be expressed due to the mixing of pTXTL-P70a-S28 DNA, which is used to activate the expression of sigma 28; 2) the limited resources and energy in CFE system. As the reaction starts, the resources in the master mix will be consumed and will limit the reaction dynamics. In this biophysical model, the limitation of the resources of the master mix was not considered; thus, the saturation of protein was not reached."
