Use an example of a real-life firm and discuss how its corporate culture blends with its organizational architecture. Organizational architecture involves the decision rights within the organization, how employees and teams are evaluated, and how this groups and individuals are rewarded for their efforts. On the other hand, corporate culture is concern with the same three aspects but also takes into consideration such things as the organizations customs, models, and rituals, which are considered the softer elements in the corporate culture. In addition, corporate culture also includes employee’s actions and how these actions can affect the organization culture. Therefore, both concepts are interdependent and support one another. A real life example of how corporate culture blends with its organizational architecture is Google. The organizational architecture for Google is for the most part flat, and divided in to teams that collaborate in projects along side with other teams throughout the organization. As a reflection of this organizational architecture, the corporate culture at Google is very relaxed, and easygoing. There are not strict dress codes, they are open to all cultures and rituals, and employees have the freedom to collaborate in other team projects even though they are not directly assigned to them Brickley, Smith, & Zimmerman, 2016) 2. (10 pts.) Billy Riggan is in charge of all technical developments at Always Round Tire. He makes all the choices concerning product innovations in the company. He finds that he is overworked and that several of his research scientists seem to be spending work hours playing tennis. What is going on? This student considers that Billy Riggan is facing several problems. First, if he is the person in charge, he is not delegating or balancing the workload correctly within his team. Trying to do all of the work by himself shows his lack of confidence in his team, which will cause even more demotivation and will cause an even bigger lost in productivity. Secondly, If he has a manager that oversee his work, then his manager is overlooking the wok load that Billy has, putting quality, productivity, and innovation, which Billy is in charge of, at risk. Many organizations rely on innovation to remain competitive in the marketplace, and then overworking Billy causing him to burn out could affect the organization profitability. Lastly, a common problem in organizations where work is assigned to teams is the free-ride issue, where some of Billy’s team members simply let him do the work while sharing the benefit. The free-ride problem could also cost a drop in productivity, hence in profitability. Brickley, Smith, & Zimmerman, 2016) 3. (10 pts.) Always Round Tire tries to base its promotions on seniority (where education and training requirements are not necessary). The company finds that this ...\n\nAssignment 2 Compensation Plan OutlineDue Week 8 and wort\n\nAssignment 2 Compensation Plan OutlineDue Week 8 and wortJinElias52\n\nAssignment 2: Compensation Plan Outline Due Week 8 and worth 300 points Using the same company you researched in Assignment 1, evaluate the company’s compensation plan to determine how it could be improved.
