        "text": "Oracle E-Business Suite Setup Guide\n\nFollow our setup guide to connect Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) to Fivetran.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nTo connect Oracle EBS to Fivetran, you need:\n\nA Fivetran account with an Enterprise or Business Critical plan\n\nOracle 11g or above\n\nYour database host's IP (e.g., 1.2.3.4) or domain (your.server.com)\n\nYour database's port (usually 1521)\n\nTLS enabled on your database (if you want to connect to Fivetran directly)\n\nSetup instructions\n\nChoose connection method\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not perform this step if you want to use the Hybrid Deployment model for your data pipeline.\n\nFirst, decide whether to connect Fivetran to your Oracle database:\n\ndirectly\n\nusing an SSH tunnel\n\nusing private networking\n\nConnect directly (TLS required)\n\nIMPORTANT: You must have TLS enabled on your database to connect directly to Fivetran. Follow Oracle's TLS setup instructions to enable TLS on your database.\n\nFivetran connects directly to your Oracle database. This is the simplest and most secure method.\n\nTo connect directly, configure your firewall and/or other access control systems to allow incoming connections to your Oracle EBS database host and port (usually 1521) from Fivetran's IPs for your database's region. How you do this will vary based on how your Oracle EBS database is hosted (cloud platform, on-premises, etc.).\n\nConnect via SSH (TLS optional)\n\nIMPORTANT: You must connect using an SSH tunnel if your Oracle database is version 12.1 or below.\n\nFivetran connects to a separate server in your network that provides an SSH tunnel to your database. You must connect through SSH if your database is in an inaccessible subnet.\n\nTo connect using SSH, follow our SSH connection instructions. If you want Fivetran to use end-to-end encryption using TLS, follow Oracle's TLS setup instructions to enable TLS on your database.\n\nConnect using private networking\n\nIMPORTANT: You must have a Business Critical plan to use private networking.\n\nPrivate networking enables communication between private networks and services without exposing traffic to the public internet. Private networking is the most secure connection method. We support the following providers:\n\nAWS PrivateLink – used for VPCs and AWS-hosted or on-premises services. See our AWS PrivateLink setup guide for details.\n\nAzure PrivateLink – used for Virtual Networks (VNets) and Azure-hosted or on-premises services. See our Azure PrivateLink setup guide for details.\n\nGoogle Cloud Private Service Connect – used for VPCs and Google-hosted or on-premises services. See our Google Cloud Private Service Connect setup guide for details.\n\nCreate user\n\nConnect to your Oracle EBS database as an admin user.\n\nExecute the following SQL commands to create a user for Fivetran and grant it permission to connect to your database. Replace <username> and <password> with a username and password of your choice:\n\nFor standalone databases:\n\nCREATE USER <username> IDENTIFIED BY <password>; GRANT CREATE SESSION TO <username>;\n\nalter profile DEFAULT limit SESSIONS_PER_USER 15;\n\nNOTE: Use the above command if the profile name of the FIVETRAN user is set to DEFAULT. Otherwise, replace DEFAULT with your chosen profile name. Check your profile name with the following query:\n\nSELECT USERNAME, PROFILE FROM DBA_USERS where USERNAME = <username>;\n\nIMPORTANT: You must have at least 15 sessions if your FIVETRAN user profile is the default profile. You must have at least 5 sessions if your FIVETRAN user profile is not the default profile.\n\nFor multitenant container databases Beta:\n\nYou must create a common user at the container level. Create the user with the container as the active session and grant the following permissions:\n\nALTER SESSION SET CONTAINER=CDB$ROOT; CREATE USER <username> IDENTIFIED BY <password> CONTAINER=ALL; GRANT CREATE SESSION, ALTER SESSION, SET CONTAINER TO <username> CONTAINER=ALL; ALTER USER <username> SET CONTAINER_DATA=ALL CONTAINER=CURRENT;\n\nNOTE: Your FIVETRAN user must have at least 15 sessions per user in both a constant database and a pluggable database. Run the following command at the container level and the pluggable level to check the parameter:\n\ncol username for a12 col profile for a19 col limit for a12 set lines 299 select a.username,b.PROFILE,b.RESOURCE_NAME,b.limit from dba_users a , dba_profiles b where a.profile=b.profile and b.RESOURCE_NAME='SESSIONS_PER_USER' and a.username = <username>;\n\nGrant read-only access\n\nNOTE: Unless you wrap an identifier (schema name, table name, etc.) in double quotes, Oracle will convert it to upper case when it performs the operation.\n\nOnce the Fivetran user is created, grant it SELECT permission for each schema and table you want to sync:\n\nFor standalone databases:\n\nGRANT SELECT ON \"<schemaA>\".\"<tableA>\" TO <username>; GRANT SELECT ON \"<schemaA>\".\"<tableB>\" TO <username>; GRANT SELECT ON \"<schemaB>\".\"<tableC>\" TO <username>;\n\nAlternatively, you can grant access to all tables:\n\nGRANT SELECT ANY TABLE TO <username>;\n\nFor multitenant container databases Beta:\n\nExecute the following command before granting permissions. Replace <PDB> with the name of the pluggable database (PDB) that you want to connect to Fivetran.\n\nALTER SESSION SET CONTAINER=<PDB>;\n\nGRANT SELECT ON \"<schemaA>\".\"<tableA>\" TO <username>; GRANT SELECT ON \"<schemaA>\".\"<tableB>\" TO <username>; GRANT SELECT ON \"<schemaB>\".\"<tableC>\" TO <username>;\n\nAlternatively, you can grant access to all tables.\n\nGRANT SELECT ANY TABLE TO <username>;\n\nGrant the Fivetran user access to the DBA_EXTENTS, DBA_TABLESPACES, and DBA_SEGMENTS system views:\n\nGRANT SELECT ON DBA_EXTENTS TO <username>; GRANT SELECT ON DBA_TABLESPACES TO <username>; GRANT SELECT ON DBA_SEGMENTS TO <username>;\n\nWe use these system views to optimize our initial import queries.\n\nConfigure incremental sync method\n\nTo keep your data up to date after the initial sync, we use one of the following incremental sync methods:\n\nLogMiner\n\nFivetran Teleport Sync Beta\n\nEach of these methods keeps a record of recent data changes, which allows Fivetran to update only the data that has changed since our last sync. To learn the differences between the two mechanisms, see our incremental update documentation.\n\nFollow the instructions below for your incremental sync method.\n\nLogMiner\n\nTo enable LogMiner, do the following:\n\nIf ARCHIVELOG mode is not enabled on your database, enable ARCHIVELOG mode.\n\nNOTE: Enabling ARCHIVELOG mode requires the Oracle instance to be taken offline for a brief period. For more information, see Oracle's documentation.\n\nSHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE; STARTUP MOUNT; ALTER DATABASE ARCHIVELOG; ALTER DATABASE OPEN;\n\nConfigure Oracle RMAN to retain backups and archive logs for at least 24 hours (Fivetran recommends seven days):\n\nNOTE: Fivetran must have a minimum of 3 hours' worth of log data to begin our initial sync. You cannot complete your Fivetran set up until 3 hours after RMAN has been configured to retain Archive Logs.\n\nRMAN> CONFIGURE RETENTION POLICY TO RECOVERY WINDOW OF 7 DAYS;\n\nWe recommend setting DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST_SIZE to a value that agrees with your available disk space, since expired and obsolete log and backup files can quickly fill your disk. For more information, see Oracle's Documentation.\n\nEnable supplemental logging. For Oracle EBS, we require database-level minimal supplemental logging with table-level identification key logging. We do not recommend enabling full supplemental logging at the database level because it can cause performance issues in your source database.\n\ni. Enable minimal supplemental logging by executing the following SQL statement. Minimal supplemental logging ensures that LogMiner has sufficient information to process the redo operations associated with DML changes.\n\nNOTE: Per Oracle's database-level supplemental logging documentation, \"minimal supplemental logging does not impose significant overhead on the database that generates the redo log files.\"\n\nALTER DATABASE ADD SUPPLEMENTAL LOG DATA;\n\nii. Once minimal supplemental logging has been enabled at the database level, you then need to enable either primary key identification logging or all supplemental logging. You only need to use all supplemental logging for tables without a primary key.\n\nNOTE: With all supplemental logging, if a row is updated, all of the columns associated with that row are placed in the redo log file.\n\nTo enable primary key supplemental logging only for specific tables, run the following SQL statement for each table:\n\nALTER TABLE \"<schema>\".\"<table>\" ADD SUPPLEMENTAL LOG DATA (PRIMARY KEY) COLUMNS;\n\nTo enable all supplemental logging only for specific tables, run the following SQL statement for each table:\n\nALTER TABLE \"<schema>\".\"<table>\" ADD SUPPLEMENTAL LOG DATA (ALL) COLUMNS;\n\nNOTE: If you don't configure the logging data correctly, you will receive a warning when Fivetran encounters a primary key change. The warning will give you customized instructions on how to fix the problem.\n\nGrant permissions for running LogMiner to the Fivetran user.\n\nGRANT SELECT ON SYS.V_$DATABASE TO <username>; GRANT SELECT ON SYS.V_$ARCHIVED_LOG TO <username>; GRANT SELECT ON SYS.V_$ARCHIVE_DEST TO <username>; GRANT SELECT ON SYS.V_$LOGMNR_CONTENTS TO <username>; GRANT EXECUTE ON DBMS_LOGMNR TO <username>; GRANT EXECUTE ON DBMS_LOGMNR_D TO <username>; GRANT SELECT ANY TRANSACTION TO <username>; GRANT EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE TO <username>;\n\nGrant additional permissions to the Fivetran user for Oracle version 12.\n\nGRANT LOGMINING TO <username>;\n\n(Optional) Grant permissions to additional system tables.\n\nNOTE: We recommend granting these permissions to optimize the connector's performance and reliability.\n\nFor standalone databases:\n\nGRANT SELECT ON DBA_FREE_SPACE TO <username>; GRANT SELECT ON SYS.V_$LOG TO <username>; GRANT SELECT ON SYS.V_$TEMPFILE TO <username>; GRANT SELECT ON SYS.V_$DATAFILE TO <username>;\n\nFor multitenant container databases Beta:\n\nExecute the following command before granting access.\n\nALTER SESSION SET CONTAINER=CDB$ROOT;\n\nGRANT SELECT ON DBA_FREE_SPACE TO <username>; GRANT SELECT ON SYS.V_$LOG TO <username>; GRANT SELECT ON SYS.V_$TEMPFILE TO <username>; GRANT SELECT ON SYS.V_$DATAFILE TO <username>;\n\nFivetran Teleport SyncBeta\n\nYou do not need to do any further setup to use Fivetran Teleport Sync. However, we recommend that you read our recommendations for Fivetran Teleport Sync before using it.\n\nFinish Fivetran configuration\n\nEnter your chosen destination schema name in the connector setup form.\n\n(Hybrid Deployment only) If your destination is configured for Hybrid Deployment, the Enable hybrid deployment toggle is set to ON and the local processing agent associated with your destination is pre-selected in the Select an existing local processing agent drop-down menu. To use a different local processing agent, select the agent of your choice, and then select the same agent for your destination.\n\nEnter the following information in the setup form:\n\nHost\n\nPort\n\nUser\n\nPassword\n\nSID\n\n(Not applicable to Hybrid Deployment) Choose a connection method.\n\nClick Save & Test. Fivetran will take it from here and sync your data from your Oracle EBS account.\n\nSetup tests\n\nFivetran performs the following tests to ensure that we can connect to your Oracle EBS database and that it is properly configured:\n\nThe Validating Archive Log Access Test checks that we can access your archive log.\n\nThe Validating Archive Log Retention Period Test verifies that your archive log is set to retain at least 24 hours' worth of changes.\n\nThe Access to Database-Level Supplemental Logging Test verifies that supplemental logging is enabled on your database. If supplemental logging is not enabled, the test passes but generates a warning message in your dashboard.\n\nThe Validating Speed Setup test checks how quickly Fivetran can fetch data from your source database. The test will show a warning if the speed is less than 5MB per second.\n\ndescription Connector Overview\n\naccount_tree Schema Information\n\nassignment Release Notes\n\nsettings API Connector Configuration"
