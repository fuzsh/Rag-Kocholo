But more importantly, it provides a great resource for residents for professional and personal development, so they can go online and take different courses at their own pace.\n\nTraditionally, workforce development has been a reactive industry or reactive business. . .[Metrix] makes our workforce development system much more proactive. What we want to do is make sure that people are constantly prepared for the next step in their career or professional development, making sure that they have the tools that they need.”\n\n“Metrix Learning has more than 5,000 courses available online and we made that available to every person in Texas who’s receiving unemployment. . . from their home or from a public library or wherever they have internet, to log into these classes and prepare themselves to go on their own and take certification tests, such as Microsoft, Oracle, Amazon, CompTIA.\n\nWe have been focused on doing as much as we can for as many people as we can, as quickly as they can. And so, they’ve [job seekers] been able to get involved in these courses and finish them very quickly and use these skills on their resume as they’re looking for work.”"
