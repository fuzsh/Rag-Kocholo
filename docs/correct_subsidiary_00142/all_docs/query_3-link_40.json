        "text": "Overview\n\nWhether you are using metrics, logs, traces, monitors, dashboards, notebooks, etc., all graphs in Datadog have the same basic functionality. This page describes querying with the graphic editor. Advanced users can create and edit graphs with JSON. To learn more, see Graphing with JSON.\n\nYou can query using the graph editor on the Dashboards or Notebooks pages, or you can use Quick Graphs available on any page. Open Quick Graphs by pressing G on any page. To learn more, see the Quick Graphs Guide.\n\nGraphing editor\n\nOn widgets, open the graphing editor by clicking on the pencil icon in the upper right corner. The graphing editor has the following tabs:\n\nShare: Embed the graph on any external web page.\n\nJSON: A more flexible editor, which requires knowledge of the graph definition language.\n\nEdit: The default UI tab for graphing options.\n\nWhen you first open the graphing editor, you are on the Edit tab. Here, you can use the UI to choose most settings. Here is an example:\n\nConfiguring a graph\n\nTo configure your graph on dashboards, follow this process:\n\nSelect the visualization\n\nDefine the metric\n\nFilter your metric\n\nConfigure the time aggregation\n\nConfigure the space aggregation\n\nApply function\n\nTitle the graph\n\nSelect your visualization\n\nSelect your visualization from the available widgets.\n\nDefine the metric\n\nChoose the metric to graph by searching or selecting it from the dropdown next to Metric. If you don’t know which metric to use, the metric dropdown provides additional information, including the unit, type, interval, description, tags, and number of tag values.\n\nExplore your metrics further with the Metrics Explorer, a Notebook, or see a list of metrics on the Metrics Summary page.\n\nFilter\n\nYour chosen metric can be filtered by host or tag using the from dropdown to the right of the metric. The default filter is (everywhere).\n\nUse advanced filtering within the from dropdown to evaluate boolean filtered or wildcard filtered queries.\n\nFilter queries dynamically, using Template Variables. Add the $ with the tag key and the graph automatically applies the tag you choose in the template variable dropdown. For more information, see the Template Variable documentation.\n\nTo learn more about tags, see the Tagging documentation.\n\nAggregate and rollup\n\nAggregation method\n\nAggregation method is next to the filter dropdown. This defaults to avg by but you can change the method to max by, min by, or sum by. In most cases, the metric has many values for each time interval, coming from many hosts or instances. The aggregation method chosen determines how the metrics are aggregated into a single line.\n\nConfigure the time aggregation\n\nRegardless of the options chosen above, there is always some aggregation of data due to the physical size constraints of the window holding the graph. If a metric is updated every second, and you are looking at 4 hours of data, you need 14,400 points to display everything. Each graph displayed has about 300 points shown at any given time. Therefore, each point displayed on the screen represents 48 data points.\n\nIn practice, metrics are collected by the Agent every 15-20 seconds. So one day’s worth of data is 4,320 data points. If you display a day’s worth of data on single graph, Datadog automatically rolls up the data. For more details on time aggregation, see the Metrics Introduction. See the Rollup documentation to learn more about the rollup intervals and how Datadog automatically rolls up data points.\n\nTo manually rollup the data, use the rollup function. Click the sigma icon to add a function and select rollup from the dropdown menu. Then choose how you want to aggregate the data and the interval in seconds.\n\nThis query creates a single line that represents the total available disk space, on average, across all machines rolled up in one minute buckets:\n\nWhen switching to the JSON view, the query looks like this:\n\nThe full JSON looks like this:\n\nFor more about using the JSON view, see Graphing with JSON.\n\nConfigure the space aggregation\n\nNext to the aggregation method dropdown, choose what constitutes a line or grouping on a graph. For example, if you choose host, there is a line for every host. Each line is made up of the selected metric on a particular host aggregated using the chosen method.\n\nAdditionally, you can click the tags in the metric dropdown used for defining the metric to group and aggregate your data.\n\nAdvanced graphing\n\nDepending on your analysis needs, you may choose to apply other mathematical functions to the query. Examples include rates and derivatives, smoothing, and others. See the list of available functions.\n\nDatadog also supports the ability to graph your metrics, logs, traces, and other data sources with various arithmetic operations. Use: +, -, /, *, min, and max to modify the values displayed on your graphs. This syntax allows for both integer values and arithmetic using multiple metrics.\n\nTo graph metrics separately, use the comma (,). For example, a, b, c.\n\nNote: Queries using commas are only supported in visualizations, they do not work on monitors. Use boolean operators or arithmetic operations to combine multiple metrics in a monitor.\n\nMetric arithmetic using an integer\n\nModify the displayed value of a metric on a graph by performing an arithmetic operation. For example, to visualize the double of a specific metric, click the Advanced&mldr; link in the graph editor. Then enter your arithmetic in the Formula box, in this case: a * 2:\n\nArithmetic between two metrics\n\nVisualize the percentage of a metric by dividing one metric over another, for example:\n\nUse the Advanced&mldr; option in the graph editor and select Add Query. Each query is assigned a letter in alphabetical order: the first metric is represented by a, the second metric is represented by b, etc.\n\nThen in the Formula box, enter the arithmetic (a / b for this example). To display only the formula on your graph, click on the check marks next to the metrics a and b.\n\nHere is another example showing how you can graph the ratio between error logs and info logs.\n\nNote: Formulas are not lettered. Arithmetic cannot be done between formulas.\n\nMinimum or Maximum between two queries\n\nHere is an example using the max operator to find the maximum CPU usage between two availability zones.\n\nAdditionally, you can also calculate the maximum (or minimum) between two queries on different products. Here is another example using the min operator to find the minimum between logs with error statuses and warning statuses.\n\nCreate an alias\n\nYou can create a custom alias for your data sources to make it easier for your users to interpret the graph results.\n\nCreate a title\n\nIf you do not enter a title, one is automatically generated based on your selections. However, it is recommended that you create a title that describes the purpose of the graph.\n\nSave\n\nClick Done to save your work and exit the editor. You can always come back to the editor to change the graph. If you make changes you don’t want to save, click Cancel.\n\nAdditional options\n\nEvent overlays\n\nView event correlations by using the Event Overlays section in the graphing editor for the Timeseries visualization. In the search field, enter any text or structured search query. Events search uses the logs search syntax.\n\nThe event overlay supports all data sources. This allows for easier correlation between business events and data from any Datadog service.\n\nWith the event overlay, you can quickly see how actions within the organization impact application and infrastructure performance. Here are some example use cases:\n\nRUM error rates with deployment events overlaid\n\nCorrelating CPU usage with events related to provisioning extra servers\n\nCorrelating egress traffic with suspicious login activity\n\nCorrelating any timeseries data with monitor alerts to ensure that Datadog has been configured with the appropriate alerts\n\nSplit graph\n\nWith split graphs, you can see your metric visualizations broken out by tags.\n\nAccess this feature through the Split Graph tab when viewing graphs.\n\nYou can change the sort by metric to see the relationship between the data you are graphing and other metrics.\n\nLimit the number of graphs that are displayed by changing the limit to value.\n\nFurther Reading"
