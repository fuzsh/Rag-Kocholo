        "text": "San Mateo, California-based Sigma develops real time predictive analytics software used for customer-focused analytic applications.\n\nOracle will integrate Sigma’s technology into its trio of new operational Oracle Business Intelligence Suites, which were launched in April this year, as well as its Oracle Fusion Middleware, of which BI is a key component.\n\nWe expect Sigma’s technology to be the basis of integral components of Fusion Middleware, said Oracle in a written statement.\n\nOracle also said it plans to build on Sigma’s core predictive capabilities to deliver a set of pre-built industry-specific analytic applications for intelligent offer management, field service optimization, predictive call routing, and fraud detection in the near future.\n\nBut the company also said it will also continue to make Sigma’s predictive analytics available as a standalone platform.\n\nOracle explained the acquisition as a logical move, saying that Sigma has been an OEM partner since January 2005. Sigma’s technology already underpins Oracle’s Siebel Real-Time Decisions product that drives analytic applications such as field service optimization, predictive call routing and fraud detection.\n\nSigma’s analytics platform is built on a J2EE architecture and delivers predictive analysis services on demand and in real time using self-learning predictive algorithms and dynamic business logic. A popular application of the technology is determining the next course of action at the point of customer interaction.\n\nOracle claims that Sigma’s approach is superior to classic rules-based predictions because it automatically adapts to changes in business process drivers.\n\nThe acquisition was closed earlier this week and Oracle has hired all of Sigma’s former staff who will continue to develop the product."
