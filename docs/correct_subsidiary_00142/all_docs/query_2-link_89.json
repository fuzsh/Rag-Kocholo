        "text": "A good blog to read is this one, by John Snyders from the apex development team. As he explains, it's not advised to branch to a modal dialog - instead you should link to it.\n\nHere is an example based on techniques described in [this] (https://jeffkemponoracle.com/2022/02/reusable-region-as-a-modal-page/) blog.\n\nI have 2 pages: Page 108 (normal page) and page 109 (modal page). Page 108 has a region (Region 1) with page item P108_NEW and a button called TO_MODAL. Page 109 has page item P109_NEW. When a user enters a value in P108_NEW and clicks the button, page 109 should open with the value from P108_NEW shown in P109_NEW.\n\nThe technique generates the url of the modal page and then redirects to it.\n\nGive the region on page 108 a static id: \"region1\". This is used if you want to create a dynamic action on close of the dialog.\n\nCreate a new hidden item on page 108 (P108_URL_TO_MODAL1) to hold the value of the modal page url. Source type: Expression, source:\n\napex_page.get_url( p_page => 109, p_triggering_element => '$(''#region1'')' )\n\nMake sure to set \"Used\" to \"Always, replacing any existing value in session state\".\n\nCreate a dynamic action on click of button on page 108.\n\nAdd an action to the dynamic action of type pl/sql to set the value on page 109.\n\nAction 1: Execute Server-side Code, Pl/SQL Code:\n\n:P109_NEW := :P108_NEW;\n\nValues to submit: P108_NEW\n\nAction 2: Execute Javascript code:\n\napex.navigation.redirect(\"&P108_URL_TO_MODAL1.\");\n\nThis should be it."
