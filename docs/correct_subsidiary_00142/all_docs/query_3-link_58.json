        "text": "Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) are used broadly across many fields to model the connectivity relationships between entities in a network. This workshop introduces Bayesian Networks, a special class of directed and acyclic PGMs. BNs are “expert systems” widely used for inference and prediction. Methods for parameter and structural learning will be discussed and implemented using the R programming language. Probabilistic reasoning will be described for making predictions within these networks. In the second part of the workshop, attendees will have a “hands-on” experience with network construction, inference, and visualization using the R programming language. Programming experience is not required. This workshop serves as a preview for a 1-credit course in the IAD’s ‘summer stackable’ graduate elective series.\n\nPandas is a Python library for processing tabular data, such as data stored in Excel spreadsheets, CSV files etc. The main goal of this workshop is to provide an introduction to basic pandas functionality and show examples of how it can be used in practice.\n\nThis will be a hands-on workshop - we will write and execute code the entire time. All participants should bring laptops. Please see pandas.ubmath.info for additional instructions.\n\nScientific modeling has transformed healthcare phenomenally. There are several problems in healthcare that are not solved yet owing to lack of full understanding of the underlying mechanism. More recently, machine learning has come into prominence. Several problems are shown to be addressed by machine learning. However, the limitation is its indifference to biology and natural principles. A novel hybrid approach called Scientific ML which leverages the best of both approaches will be presented. The potential problems that this revolutionary paradigm can help with will be discussed.\n\nOnline Social Networks are rife with misinformation. Online healthcare social networks are no exception. Misinformation can impact patient safety when patients act on information that does not apply to them.\n\nThis research focuses on determining the extent of misinformation in online healthcare social networks (OHSN) to develop a misinformation index for OHSN. Given the increase in the use of disease-specific Healthcare Social Networks, and the increased propensity amongst patients to try out advice from fellow patients on such forums, the impact of such sites on patients’ health naturally comes under greater scrutiny. Research shows that the quality of health-related information online, especially patient-generated content, is often suspect. This is likely to compromise patient safety. This research explores the factors associated with the response quality in online Health Social Network Sites (HSNS), focusing on Diabetes and Parkinson’s Disease.\n\nDiabetes is a chronic disease that results in high blood sugar. It is a significant cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke, lower limb amputation, etc. Parkinson’s is a chronic, degenerative disease often complicated by the presence of comorbidities, thus requiring a lifetime of active management on the part of the patient.\n\nGiven the nature of such forums, we study the influence of cohesive subgroups and the dynamics of thread conversation. Our findings show that the relative disease experience of the responders (compared to the person asking the thread question), question completeness, and clique membership influence response quality in a thread. Our findings also indicate that social network cues such as ‘likes’, while commonplace, are inaccurate indicators of response quality.\n\nCo-authors: Srikanth Venkatesan, Sanjukta Das-Smith, and Wencui Han.

These efforts have aided the region’s COVID-19 response, identifying the arrival of new variants and helping the community understand how SARS-CoV2 infections are changing locally as the virus evolves. She also collaborated with faculty, students and staff to develop K-12 “Covid Chats” and vaccine information for all ages.\n\nSurtees feels strongly that we must learn from the lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare ourselves for future outbreaks and other potential pandemics by building on the infrastructure we have established since 2020. Surtees has assembled a strong interdisciplinary team with expertise in genetics, environmental engineering, and mathematical modeling to develop an early warning system for infectious diseases that integrates multiple types of ecosystem data from a wide range of stakeholders, including the community. But detection is only the first step. We must also develop true partnerships and trust among researchers, public health officials, the government, and the public. To do this, the research group is actively and continuously engaging and partnering with members of diverse community groups. The goal is to promote community resilience and support a proactive response. This work is supported by an NSF Predictive Intelligence in Pandemic Prevention grant.\n\nThis talk introduces Tardigotchi, an award-winning interactive artwork that showcases two distinct pets - a living tardigrade and an artificial life avatar. Housed in a portable computing enclosure, this artwork blends biological and artificial life within a single interface.\n\nThe artificial life avatar is a caricature of the tardigrade, and its behavior is partially autonomous, reflecting the tardigrade's daily activities. Tardigotchi playfully references the Tamagotchi toy from the 1990s, raising questions about the emotional attachment that can arise from simple interaction and whether biological life is essential for this attachment.\n\nTardigotchi owners tend to both the real and virtual creatures, feeding the virtual pet through a button, which in turn feeds the tardigrade. The artwork also has a social web presence, allowing users to send an email to the virtual character and trigger a heating lamp that relays a momentary signal of warmth to the tardigrade while prompting the pixelated tardigrade to recline and soak up animated sun rays.\n\nTardigotchi's design symbiotically merges biological and artificial life, serving as a reminder of the special place humans have in communing with other animals and artificial beings. It offers a salve to our yearnings for care and nurture, emphasizing the precarious nature of the ecosystem we all share.\n\npyDarwin is an open source all Python command line solution implementing a range of machine learning algorithms for model selection using NONMEM. In using pyDarwin, the user defines the different options to be searched, such as the number of compartments, the absorption models, the covariates, the between-subject variability options and the residual error model options. pyDarwin then searches the combinations of those options to find the “best” model, with “best” being based by user-defined criteria. These criteria include the objective function value, parsimony penalties for estimated parameters, penalties for failing to converge etc. There is also an option for R or Python code to be run after each model and return a custom penalty from user-supplied code. Pirana with Darwin incorporates much of the functionality of pyDarwin in a user-friendly graphical interface, with dropdown menus for defining the possible structural models, and optional parameters, such as lag time, covariate relationships and between-subject variability terms. The results of the Darwin search in Pirana can then be used as the basis for additional model testing as well as all the usual plotting and reporting capabilities available in Pirana.\n\nNote that a separate registration is required to attend this event.\n\nThe discovery and development of new materials tailored to a specific function remain one of the grand challenges for materials scientists. To this end, layered materials have been extensively studied due to the sundry properties that emerge from chemical and physical modifications. Unfortunately, little is still known of the fundamental requirements to generate pronounced and tailored alterations to the electronic structure upon dimensional reduction or functionalization of their active sites. Comprehensive nanoscale characterization is essential to understand how the loss of 3D structural coherence and further modifications of the surface, induced because of ion intercalation, exfoliation to 2D sheets, or functionalization of the basal planes, alter the electronic structure of these materials, which translates into physical properties. In this talk, I will discuss the lessons learned from the mechanisms of lithiation of layered α-V2O5 and the stark inhomogeneities to the crystal and electronic structure of this material during lithiation. Then, I will discuss current work on the synthesis and structural modification of the canonical layered MXene: Ti­3C2Tx. Finally, I will discuss the position AI and machine learning techniques in developing the next generation of materials.\n\nOur national power grid has evolved to a pivotal point – not only does the grid need to provide reliable, resilient, and affordable electricity for societal prosperity and economic development, but also the grid needs to ensure a sustainable and equitable energy future, aligning with the new administrative goals of clean electricity by 2035 and fully decarbonized economy by 2050. As a result, the energy mix is shifting toward clean energy resources, and it leads to significant technical and policy challenges. Driven by the big push for deeper electrification and decarbonization, the electricity demand could double in the next two decades, and more than 80% of electricity will be generated, transferred, and/or consumed through power electronics interfaces. These include wind and solar generation, electric vehicle charging, and new building equipment. This is fundamentally changing the system dynamics as the new resources displace conventional inertia-heavy synchronous generators. But this is also bringing an opportunity for a better future grid – more responsive and flexible! To this end, the electric infrastructure needs to expand; energy storage needs to meet grid-scale application requirements; plus, new markets need to be in place to incentivize the support and services from these new resources. This talk will discuss the trends, challenges, and opportunities for grid modernization in this unprecedented clean energy transition."
