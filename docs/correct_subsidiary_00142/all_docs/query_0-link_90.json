        "text": "One of the truisms of the business world is the saying: “A business that is not growing is dying.” That is certainly a reality for packaging converters in North America as they scramble to reach the pinnacle of this industry.\n\nOnce again, Flexible Packaging offers its annual list of the Top 25 Converters in North America for the year 2019. These rankings are based on each company’s revenues for the year 2018. As expected, the rankings are scrambled a bit from the previous year, but most companies are familiar figures in this year-to-year feature.\n\nThe Top 25 Converters annual rankings have consistently proven to be this magazine’s most popular feature. In an industry composed of both public and private companies, industry observers are eager to see which companies are making moves that solidify or grow their positions in this competitive arena.\n\nThese data have been gathered from multiple sources, including direct reporting from each company, annual reports, SEC documents, media reports and other sources. In some cases — especially for private companies — it was necessary to make estimates based on available data. Converting is a popular target for investors. The year 2018 saw substantial merger and acquisition activity. The FPA State of the Industry report indicates there were 33 mergers or acquisitions of converters last year. The top 10 converters account for a whopping 55 percent of the market, the study states. This accounts for many of the changes you will see in the following ranking.\n\nWant More Top 25?\n\n2019 Top 25 Converters Rankings\n\n2019 Top 25 Converters PDF Download\n\nTop 25 Converters Page\n\n1.
