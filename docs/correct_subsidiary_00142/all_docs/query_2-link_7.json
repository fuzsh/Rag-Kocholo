        "text": "One of Oracle’s\n\nbiggest challenges these days is integrating the new products from its numerous acquisitions with its existing software.\n\nOracle (Quote) just finished one such undertaking,\n\nincorporating the analytics software it acquired in the Siebel Systems\n\npurchase as the base for its business intelligence software.\n\nOracle Business Intelligence Suite Enterprise Edition 10g Release 3 features\n\nsignificant new integration with Oracle’s broad swath of applications,\n\ndatabase software and other components of Oracle Fusion Middleware.\n\nLike similar suites from rivals Business Objects (Quote), Cognos\n\n(Quote) and Hyperion\n\n(Quote), Oracle Business Intelligence Suite EE is designed to\n\nprovide business users information so they can make better business\n\ndecisions.\n\nOracle Business Intelligence Suite EE, available in Linux and Windows\n\nflavors for $1,500 per user or $225,000 per CPU, includes Siebel’s live\n\ndashboards, ad hoc analysis, alerts, reports, and even disconnected\n\nanalytics on mobile laptops.\n\nSuch tools fuel a multi-billion-dollar industry that has seen just about\n\nevery facet of its existence commoditized, excluding predictive analytics.\n\nThis area is expected to be red hot in 2007; Oracle’s August purchase of\n\nSigma Dynamics and Hyperion’s recent bid for\n\nDecisioneering bear this out.\n\nCompared to pure-play powers Business Objects and Cognos, Oracle is a\n\nrelative newcomer to the BI space. But the company has built an estimable\n\nreputation for managing corporate information in databases for more than 20\n\nyears, and customers could find it convenient to buy BI from Oracle.\n\nIntegration\n\nMost BI providers don’t have to contend with is integrating their products into several different product lines, whether it be their own software or another vendor’s. Oracle wasn’t one of those vendors, according to Rick\n\nSchultz, vice president of Oracle Fusion Middleware.\n\nOracle Business Intelligence Suite EE boasts more Web services\n\n(define) support and integration with Oracle BPEL Process\n\nManager, the company’s business process execution engine. For example,\n\nSchultz said users can get automated BI alerts that invoke processes.\n\n“Business intelligence fits in tightly with business processes,” Schultz\n\nsaid. “Customers want their end users to access the intelligence information\n\nin the context of a business process. This integration allows that to\n\noccur.”\n\nSchultz said the ability to integrate BI with Oracle’s fluency in business\n\nprocess management (BPM) (define) separates the company from the\n\nother BI vendors.\n\nIn another case, Oracle Business Intelligence Suite EE’s integration with\n\nthe OLAP (define) option of Oracle Database 10g Enterprise Edition\n\nconsolidates server engines to store, view and analyze data in OLAP cubes.\n\nThe product is also more secure, thanks to integration with Oracle Virtual\n\nDirectory, the Oracle E-Business Suite security model, Oracle Enterprise\n\nSingle Sign-On Suite, and Oracle Internet Directory.\n\nLike all new infrastructure software coming out of Oracle these days, the BI\n\nsoftware has been designed to be “hot-pluggable,” Oracle’s catch-phrase for\n\nsoftware that will run on any existing IT infrastructure.\n\nBusinesses find value in this, Oracle argues, because they needn’t rip and\n\nreplace the software they already use to accommodate new Oracle software.\n\nTo wit, Oracle Business Intelligence Suite EE will work with the latest\n\nreleases of IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, and NCR Teradata. Moreover, the\n\nproduct now features multi-dimensional support and new native access to SAP\n\nBusiness Information Warehouse."
