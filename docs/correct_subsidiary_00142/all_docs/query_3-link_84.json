While unions strike and artists file lawsuits over AI job- and value-displacement, marketers wring our hands about so-called AI threatening marketing jobs and making our marketing departments obsolete while we… wait for it… use AI to do marketing.\n\nOperating under this strange dichotomy, marketers have fallen hard for unprecedented hype and are rushing to be the first to master AI tech, hell-bent on self-fulfilling a fate of our own making — all for a tool that, as one scientist puts it, is nothing more than algorithms that are “haphazardly stitching together sequences of linguistic forms … according to probabilistic information.” Or as a user on Mastodon put it, “mansplaining as a service: superficially plausible but totally fabricated nonsense presented with unflagging confidence.”\n\nImplausibly, we’ve decided to pay a steep ethical price for participating in this illusion:\n\nWe’re now just stealing content (content that we’ve created for our brands and clients, astonishingly).\n\nWe’re publishing content from and giving juice to a biased system that causes real harm to many groups, a system that one scholar calls “the civil rights issue of our time.”\n\nWe’re choosing not to accept the significant environmental impact of our actions during a climate and humanitarian crisis.\n\nThere is another path.\n\nAudiences will take away:\n\nTake an alternative view of generative AI, understanding how its technology is anything but intelligent, and how using it is commoditizing marketers’ hard-earned exercise.\n\nTake a clear and honest look at the ethical trade-offs marketers are making by using these tools.\n\nLearn four specific ways we as marketers can take an active role in creating an alternative, more ethical future for so-called AI that will better serve us and our craft.\n\nNote: This session assumes familiarity with AI principles.\n\nAaron Templer\n\nAMA Colorado\n\nEmpower Your Marketing | Marketing Leadership | Advanced\n\nPath to CMO: Navigating the Marketing Executive Journey\n\nThe path to becoming a CMO is both exhilarating and demanding.

It has to engage. And above all, it has to tell a story that places your prospect or customer at the center.\n\nIt’s not just about crafting your message. It’s about crafting a story where your prospect or customer is the hero and your brand is the guide to their success. Crafting engaging messages that resonate with your audience is both a science and an art, and you’ll leave this session knowing how to:\n\nGet super clear and concise about your brand message\n\nMake your story about your customer and not your own brand\n\nTurn storytelling concepts into real-world practical marketing magic.\n\nStephen Brent May\n\nPCC, AMA Houston\n\nEmpower Your Marketing | Marketing Leadership | Beginner\n\nBack to Basics: Building a Magnetic Brand\n\nRefresh your marketing chops in this one-hour session where we will delve into branding and marketing basics–from creating an impactful marketing strategy which includes KPIs, goals to elevating customer experiences that enhance customer loyalty!\n\nVanessa Torres\n\nPCC Executive Team, President, AMA San Antonio\n\nAmber McKenna\n\nPCC, AMA PDX\n\nEmpower Your Marketing | Data & Analytics | Intermediate\n\nMarketing Data 101: Fundamentals for Marketers\n\nThis session explores the essential data and analytics metrics vital for marketing professionals and discusses insights on acquiring diverse marketing data for informed decision-making.\n\nKevin Amos\n\nPartner | Chief Media and Data Officer, Brunner\n\nEmpower Your Marketing | Data & Analytics | Advanced\n\nUnlocking Behavior Change: Inspiring Humans to Action\n\nDive into the heart of influence and persuasion at this dynamic session.
