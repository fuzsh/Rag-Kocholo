It was a pleasure to attend this interesting session about #RCS Business Messaging, and how Google and Infobip can join efforts to give the best services for the next SMS and comms strategies. Thanks Tim Atkinson from Google and my colleagues Alvaro Ansaldo and Ilaria Notarantonio for such interesting speeches about this solution and use cases. [Available now in #Android and very soon in #Apple devices!]"
