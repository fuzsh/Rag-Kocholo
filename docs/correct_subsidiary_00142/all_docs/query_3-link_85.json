Peel back many transactional business applications at any enterprise and you’ll find a mainframe application under there. It’s often where the crown jewels of the business’ data and core transactions are processed. The tooling for these applications is dated and new code is infrequent, but moving off is seen as risky. No one. Wants. To. Touch. Mainframes. But mainframe applications don’t have to be the electric third rail. Modernizing, even pieces of those mainframe workloads into modern frameworks on modern platforms, has huge payoffs. Developers can gain all the productivity benefits of modern tooling. Not to mention the scaling, security, and cost benefits. So, how do you get started modernizing applications off a mainframe? Join Rohit Kelapure, Consulting Practice Lead at Pivotal, as he shares lessons from projects with enterprises to move workloads off of mainframes. You’ll learn: ● How to decide what to modernize first by looking at business requirements AND the existing codebase ● How to take a test-driven approach to minimize risks in decomposing the mainframe application ● What to use as a replacement or evolution of mainframe schedulers ● How to include COBOL and other mainframe developers in the process to retain institutional knowledge and defuse project detractors ● How to replatform mainframe applications to the cloud leveraging a spectrum of techniques Presenter : Rohit Kelapure, Consulting Practice Lead, Pivotal\n\nWhy The Cloud For HR\n\nWhy The Cloud For HRWorkday\n\nWith over 66,000 employees, FTSE-listed Rentokil Initial plc is one example of a UK-based company that has invested in cloud-based technology for HR.

Information Excellence gives your company the advantage of doing business in real time with centralized and correct data and master data, while other companies are making critical business decisions on outdated content.\n\nLeading in the digital economy\n\nLeading in the digital economyFujitsu Middle East\n\nMost companies are currently either working on their digital agenda or are already amid their digital transformation journey. SAP is focused on helping enterprises and entrepreneurs achieve their digital goals via its latest innovation, cloud solutions & transformation services. SAP new innovation portfolio and its digital core helps eliminate IT complexity, by availing a single real time platform that accommodates both transactional and analytical data which is IoT ready; while supporting Artificial Intelligence, Block Chain and Machine Learning capabilities. SAP delivers a unified, intelligent data platform that is open and enterprise-ready and that ties into the full suite of SAP applications which provides a foundation for innovation and new value creation. Nimble companies realize they must put innovation at the core of their business, reshaping IT to deliver stability and agility, while managing to continue to successfully operate and deliver amid their transformation journey. This evolution from Systems of Record to Systems of Intelligence through embedded Analytics, Machine Learning, sensor data and other technologies is not a trivial task and hence the need to have a strong technology partner like SAP.

With increasing focus on data in organisations we believe that data-driven organisations must also think differently when it comes to the role of data in their automation activities. Companies can continue to devise more complex and costly work-arounds to make a process-centric approach work in a data-centric world, or they can use an automation approach that is inherently data-centric to drive the next phase of Hyperautomation.\n\nBATber53 AWS Modernize your applications with purpose-built AWS databases\n\nBATber53 AWS Modernize your applications with purpose-built AWS databasesBATbern\n\nModernize your applications with purpose-built AWS databases What are the key attributes of a modern database application? A modern database application should be designed for innovation and agility, it should perform without any limits on performance and scalability, and it should be highly available, easily managed, and cost effective. A modern database should then support all data types and access patterns. It should implement ACID transactions and strong consistency, it should provide limitless scalability and tolerate load variability with high performance regardless of the query complexity. It should run without downtime at a predictable and cost-effective price. And, obviously it should be simple and easy to use, tune and maintain. The problem is that we know, since the CAP theorem, that such a database does not exist. That's why a modern application strategy has to rely on specific purpose-built database engines for the persistence layer. This session will cover the databases AWS offers to meet application needs for in-memory workloads, key-value stores, document collections as well as time-series, graph and ledger databases. We will illustrate the presentation with several customer architecture use-cases.\n\nFix Production Bugs Quickly - The Power of Structured Logging in Ruby on Rail...\n\nFix Production Bugs Quickly - The Power of Structured Logging in Ruby on Rail...John Gallagher\n\nRails apps can be a black box. Have you ever tried to fix a bug where you just can’t understand what’s going on? This talk will give you practical steps to improve the observability of your Rails app, taking the time to understand and fix defects from hours or days to minutes. Rails 8 will bring an exciting new feature: built-in structured logging. This talk will delve into the transformative impact of structured logging on fixing bugs and saving engineers time. Structured logging, as a cornerstone of observability, offers a powerful way to handle logs compared to traditional text-based logs. This session will guide you through the nuances of structured logging in Rails, demonstrating how it can be used to gain better insights into your application’s behavior. This talk will be a practical, technical deep dive into how to make structured logging work with an existing Rails app. I talk about the Steps to Observable Software - a practical five step process for improving the observability of your Rails app."
