        "text": "OAuth 2.0 Authorization\n\nOAuth 2.0 Authorization is an open protocol to allow secure authorization in a simple and standard method from web, mobile and desktop applications. Use OAuth to let application developers securely get access to your users’ data without sharing their passwords. (ouauth.net OAuth Community Site 10/31/2022)\n\nMES Objects\n\nObjects are used extensively throughout the MES modules. Some are for the ISA-95 object model, while others are part of our platform. Collectively, we refer to all these objects as MES Objects. An object can represent material, equipment, an operation, production information, etc. Some properties, events, and functions are common across all objects, while other objects add their own additional properties, events, and functions. Today, the MES Objects are used by the Track & Trace and OEE 2.0 modules. In future releases, all other MES modules will also be based on the MES Objects.\n\nOEE\n\nOverall equipment effectiveness (OEE) measures the percentage of planned production time that is truly productive.\n\nOEE = Availability x Performance x Quality\n\nOIT\n\nOperator Interface Terminal (OIT) is a low-level graphical interface to a specified computer on the plant floor such as a programmable automation controller (PAC), a programmable logic controller (PLC) or distributed control system (DCS).\n\nOPC\n\nAn Open Process Connectivity (OPC) is the name of a technology standard used to write to programmable logic controllers (PLC)s. OPC allows information exchange between gauges, databases, PLCs, and more.\n\nOPC Server\n\nAn Object Linking and Embedding for Process Control (OPC) Server is a software application that acts as an API (Application Programming Interface) or protocol converter. An OPC Server can connect to a device such as a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), Distributed Control System (DCS), and Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) or a data source such as a database or Human Machine Interface (HMI) to translate the data into a standard OPC format.\n\nOPC Tag\n\nOften referred to as just ‘Tags’, OPC Tags are Ignition tags that specify an OPC server and address which drives their values. The OPC address will be subscribed at the rate of the tag’s scan class during configuration, and values written to these tags will be pushed to the PLCs.\n\nOPC-UA\n\nAn Object Linking and Embedding for Process Control Unified Architecture (OPC-UA) is a is a communication protocol for interoperability developed by the OPC Foundation. The Foundation’s goal for this project was to provide a path forward from the original OPC communications model (namely COM/DCOM) to a cross-platform service-oriented architecture (SOA) for process control while enhancing security and providing an information model.\n\nUsing the OPC-UA module, Ignition acts as an OPC-UA server, serving data collected by its built-in drivers to other Ignition modules, as well as third-party OPC-UA clients. -Wikipedia\n\nOracle\n\nOracle is a relational database. Ignition connects to it easily and it can be used to store or retrieve data.\n\nOS\n\nOperation System (OS) is a layer which the Ignition platform rests upon. The operating systems include Windows, Apple (MacOS), and Linux/Ubuntu.\n\nOS Layer > Platform Layer > Core Module Layer > Third-Party Module Layer > User Created Application Layer\n\nYou can view an example of this layering here.\n\nSAP\n\nSystems, Applications, & Products (SAP) implementation is based on best practices and case studies from various literature sources and presents a collection of processes and products that make up a complete implementation method to allow any organization to plan and execute the implementation of SAP software. –Wikipedia\n\nSCADA\n\nSupervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) is a process control system that is used in a countless number of applications, including manufacturing, communications, distribution (water, gas, power) and heating, cooling and security in buildings. A SCADA system collects data from sensors in local and remote locations and sends them to central computers to control local machinery.\n\nSCADA systems range from simple configurations to large and complex projects. Most SCADA systems use human-machine interface (HMI) software that allows users to interact with and control the machines and devices that the HMI is connected to such as valves, pumps, motors, and much more.\n\nSCADA software receives its information from RTUs (Remote Terminal Units) or PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) which can receive their information from sensors or manually inputted values. From here, the data can be used to effectively monitor, collect and analyze data, which can potentially reduce waste and improve efficiency resulting in savings of both time and money.\n\nIgnition is a SCADA software solution.\n\nSDLC\n\nSoftware Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a term referring to the Sepasoft MES module release pattern, which is noted below:\n\nBeta > Release Candidate > Full Release > Service Pack\n\nBeta: Version that it has not yet passed our Test/QA process and is ready for a production environment. We provide this version as an opportunity for end users to use in a development environment and, in rare cases, to fix a critical bug in production.\n\nRelease Candidate: Version has passed through our Test/QA process and is considered to be stable enough to be used in development and production.\n\nFull Release: Version follows the Release Candidate version and may include any minor fixes reported or found.\n\nService Pack: Consists of minor updates to the Full Release version.\n\nThe software development life cycle (SDLC) is a framework defining tasks performed at each step in the software development process. SDLC is a structure followed by a development team within the software organization. It consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain and replace specific software. The life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of software and the overall development process.\n\nThe software development life cycle is also known as the software development process.–techopedia\n\nSFC\n\nA Sequential Function Chart (SFC) is a series of scripts that are defined in a single location and then called in sequential order. Additional elements in the chart can determine where the flow of the chart will lead. Charts can loop around indefinitely, or execute a set number of times before ending. Sequential Function Charts are based on a graphical programming language in the IEC 61131-1 standard. This language may be familiar to PLC programmers, as it is one of the languages commonly available for programming PLCs.\n\nSFCs are used to execute logic in ways that are more convenient to structure than with Python scripts or PLC programming alone. Because of their inherently visual depiction, they help to illuminate logic to users and facilitate intuitive development and refinement. Charts can be monitored as they run visually, making troubleshooting easier than with scripting alone. -Ignition User Manual\n\nSix Sigma\n\nSix Sigma is a set of techniques and tools for process improvement. It seeks to improve the quality of the output of a process by identifying and removing the causes of defects and minimizing variability in manufacturing and business processes. It uses a set of quality management methods, mainly empirical, statistical methods, and creates a special infrastructure of people within the organization, who are experts in these methods. Each Six Sigma project carried out within an organization follows a defined sequence of steps and has specific value targets, for example: reduce process cycle time, reduce pollution, reduce costs, increase customer satisfaction, and increase profits. -Wikipedia\n\nSOA\n\nA service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an architectural pattern in computer software design in which application components provide services to other components via a communications protocol, typically over a network. The principles of service-orientation are independent of any vendor, product or technology. A service is a self-contained unit of functionality, such as retrieving an online bank statement. By that definition, a service is a discretely invokable operation. -Wikipedia\n\nSPC\n\nStatistical Process Control (SPC) is a method of quality control which uses statistical methods. SPC is applied in order to monitor and control a process. -Wikipedia\n\nSQL\n\nStructured Query Language (SQL) is a standard computer language for relational database management and data manipulation. SQL is used to query, insert, update and modify data. Most relational databases support SQL, which is an added benefit for database administrators (DBAs), as they are often required to support databases across several different platforms.\n\nFirst developed in the early 1970s at IBM by Raymond Boyce and Donald Chamberlin, SQL was commercially released by Relational Software Inc. (now known as Oracle Corporation) in 1979. The current standard SQL version is voluntary, vendor-compliant and monitored by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Most major vendors also have proprietary versions that are incorporated and built on ANSI SQL, e.g., SQL*Plus (Oracle), and Transact-SQL (T-SQL) (Microsoft). -Techopedia\n\nSUDS\n\nSUDS is a lightweight version of SOAP, hence the name SUDS. SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol, and is commonly used for Internet communication. Both SUDS and SOAP are part of the Sepasoft® MES Web Services solutions."
