        "text": "Pastelicos\n\nContributor\n\nYedida Dabah\n\nTime\n\n2 hours + 1 hour baking\n\nYield\n\nApproximately 50 pastelicos\n\nPhotography: Matan Choufan\n\nJerusalem-based cook Yedida Dabah, making these Sephardic savory pastries filled with beef and pine nuts, is a way to keep the memory of her mother Dvora alive. Yedida changed the recipe just slightly to include the warming spice blend ras-el-hanout to this recipe. Serve the pastries, as her family does, for a Shabbat breakfast alongside hard boiled eggs, tahini, chopped vegetable salad, and a shot of Arak.\n\nA tip: For easier handling, prepare the filling a day ahead and refrigerate overnight.\n\nRead Yedida Dabah’s full story on Jewish Food Society website.\n\nIngredients\n\nFor the filling:\n\n¼ cup vegetable oil\n\n2 large onions, finely chopped\n\n1 lb / 500 grams lean ground beef\n\n1 cup water\n\n½ cup pine nuts, toasted\n\n1 teaspoon Ras el Hanout spice mix\n\n½ tablespoon salt\n\n1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n\nFor the dough:\n\n2 ½ cups water\n\n2 sticks + 5 tablespoons / 300 grams unsalted margarine (or butter, for a non-kosher version)\n\n¼ cup vegetable oil\n\n½ teaspoon salt\n\n5 ½ cups all-purpose flour\n\n¼ cup sesame seeds, for sprinkling\n\nPreparation\n\nPrepare the filling: Heat the oil in a large skillet over a medium heat. Add the onions and sauté, stirring occasionally until golden and soft, 15-20 minutes.\n\nAdd the ground beef and sauté, breaking the meat into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until cooked through, about 5 minutes.\n\nAdd the water and cook down until the water evaporates, about 5 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, toast the pine nuts over medium heat in a dry skillet until aromatic and golden, about 5 minutes.\n\nAdd the pine nuts, Ras el Hanout, salt, and pepper to the meat and onion mixture, mix well and remove from the heat.\n\nTransfer the mixture to a heat resistant container and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, preferably overnight.\n\nPrepare the dough: Place the water, margarine (or butter), oil, and salt in a medium pot and place over a medium heat until the mixture starts to boil. Remove from the heat and immediately stir in the flour with a wooden spoon until well combined. Allow the dough to cool for a few minutes, just until it can be easily handled.\n\nPreheat the oven to 400°F / 200°C and line two baking trays with parchment paper.\n\nStuff and shape the pastelicos: Pinch off a small amount of dough the size of a large cherry tomato. Roll into a ball and press down on the center to form a 1-inch / 2 ½-cm pocket for the filling. Fill the pocket to the top edges with a teaspoonful of filling. Take a smaller piece of dough and press it into a disc shape that fits over the top of the pocket. Pinch around the edges to connect the top to the bottom and create a design around the edge of the pocket. Yedida refers to it as repulgo, which is Spanish for crimping or fancy edging (see below).\n\nPlace the pastelico on the prepared baking sheet (they can be placed quite close to one another as they will not rise or expand much when baking) and repeat with the remaining dough and filling.\n\nSprinkle the sesame seeds evenly over the pastelicos and bake until golden brown, about 1 hour. For even baking, bake each tray separately.\n\nServe hot or at room temperature with tahini sauce, vegetable salad, and hard-boiled eggs.\n\nRelated recipes"
