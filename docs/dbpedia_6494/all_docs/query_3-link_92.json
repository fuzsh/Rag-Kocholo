These decreases in motor and respiratory function — seen after just a couple of months — were not…\n\nCOVID-19 Largely Mild in 4 LOPD Patients With Pulmonary Weakness\n\nInfection by the virus that causes COVID-19 led to mild-to-moderate symptoms in four people with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) and pulmonary involvement, despite the increased risk of severe complications in such cases, scientists reported. “COVID-19 infection can result in a benign course in some patients with LOPD. However, individuals with LOPD…\n\nIncreased Myozyme Dosing May Help With Classic Infantile Pompe\n\nPatients with classic infantile-onset Pompe disease could benefit from increased dosing of Myozyme (alglucosidase alfa), an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) marketed as Lumizyme in the U.S., according to a real-world European study. Benefits were seen in improved survival and ability to walk. “On the basis of our results,…\n\nAntioxidants Help ERT Efficacy in Pompe, Early Study Suggests\n\nAntioxidants can increase the effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for Pompe disease caused by oxidative stress, the damage in cells or tissues by reactive oxygen molecules, according to a study in cells and mice. The findings also showed that enhancing autophagy — the destruction of damaged or redundant…"
