The girl was examined by clinicians after…\n\nCombining Cortisol Blockers May Lead to Better Control in Cushing’s\n\nA combination of medications that inhibit steroidogenesis — the process by which the body produces steroid hormones, like cortisol, from cholesterol — can be used to treat people with Cushing’s syndrome, allowing for adequate control of their cortisol levels until surgery, a case report highlighted. Such combinations may be especially…\n\nPregnancy Could Worsen Cushing’s Due to Adrenal Tumors, Study Says\n\nIn pregnant women, changes in DNA methylation — a chemical modification used to tone down gene expression or activity — may worsen Cushing’s syndrome caused by adrenal tumors, a study reported. Findings indicate these chemical changes cause tumors to grow faster and become larger in pregnant patients compared with patients…\n\nLowering Cortisol Levels Can Ease Heart Issues in Certain Patients\n\nDue to its effects on heart tissue, high levels of cortisol, like those seen in Cushing’s syndrome, may play a role in the development of cardiomyopathies — diseases of the heart muscle that make it harder for the heart to pump blood to the rest of the body —…\n\nIncreased Percentage of Neutrophils Linked to Greater Diabetes Risk\n\nPeople with Cushing’s syndrome who have an increased percentage of a specific type of white blood cells, called neutrophils — which are involved in inflammation and act as the first line of defense against bacteria and other organisms — are at greater risk of developing diabetes mellitus, according…\n\nDoctors Link Cushing’s Syndrome to Corticosteroid Use on Infant\n\nWhen placed over the skin, potent corticosteroids induced Cushing’s syndrome in an infant who was given the medications over a long period of time to treat diaper rash, a recent case study reported. “Physicians need to consider this in infantile [Cushing’s syndrome] cases, and take appropriate measures to avoid…"
