The motor cortex, a part of the cerebral cortex responsible for the planning, control, and implementation of voluntary movement, is the brain region most…\n\nItalian Scientist Using $20K Grant to Research TDP-43 Antibody Therapy\n\nAn Italian scientist was awarded $20,000 for research that may help pave the way for a TDP-43 antibody-based treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The annual Paulo Gontijo Award from the Brazilian Paulo Gontijo Institute was granted to Silvia Tozzi, PhD, for her research, titled “Monoclonal full-length antibody…\n\nTarget ALS, ADDF Team Up to Fund Biomarker Research\n\nA new partnership between Target ALS and the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF) will help facilitate biomarker research in neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer’s disease, and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Identifying and validating appropriate biomarkers can help clinicians diagnose these diseases earlier, reliably track…\n\nPhase 3 Trial of Masitinib in Slowing Progression Again Enrolling in US\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared AB Science to resume patient enrollment in its confirmatory Phase 3 trial investigating masitinib as an add-on treatment in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). AB Science put a temporary hold on all its masitinib clinical trials due…"
