Letâs put that same effort into research consent.Â\n\nThe government has power over peopleâs lives, including the lives of research participants. When the government conducts research, participants need to understand how weâll use the research and their information. This means making information about participant rights transparent and clear so that people are not overwhelmed by text and legal jargon.Â\n\nAbout a year ago, the Research and Content Design teams at the Canadian Digital Service (CDS) started collaborating on our privacy and consent form. Working together, weâve used plain language to make complicated ideas easier to understand. For example, weâve created headings that explain what participants really need to know and read, while indicating which details some people may prefer to skip. People must read and agree to the form before participating in our research. By using content design, our goal is to help participants understand the form before they consent."
