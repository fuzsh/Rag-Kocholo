The study, “B cell numbers predict humoral and cellular response upon SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among patients…\n\nModerna COVID-19 Vaccine May Trigger AAV-linked Kidney Damage\n\nKidney inflammation associated with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) was recently reported in a man following his second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. While cases of AAV have been described after COVID-19 infection and vaccination, this is only the third case of AAV-related kidney inflammation, with antibodies against the proteinase…\n\nOlder Patients Have Worse Mortality, but Treatment Helps All Ages\n\nPeople over the age of 65 with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) have worse mortality outcomes than younger patients, but kidney failure is not greater in this group, according to a recent study. These worse outcomes were associated with lower levels of hemoglobin — the protein responsible for carrying oxygen in…\n\nAAV Patients Independently Adopt Self-management Techniques\n\nPeople with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) adopt a range of strategies that help them to better cope with the condition on their own, but several areas of self-management could be addressed more immediately through conversations with their physicians, a study found. The study, “Addressing the transition to a chronic…"
