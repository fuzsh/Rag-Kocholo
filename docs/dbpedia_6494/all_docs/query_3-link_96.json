        "text": "You can now find my publications and professional information here.\n\nHere is a short bio:\n\nI am a physicist by training, now working on algorithms for AI and machine learning.\n\nMy Ph.D. (Princeton, 1990) was in theoretical physics, specifically the statistical mechanics of disordered systems. I continued research along these lines, but also started work in biophysics and evolutionary algorithms from 1990-1993, when I was a Junior Fellow at Harvard’s Society of Fellows.\n\nIn 1993, I switched gears and became a professional chess player and teacher. I hold the title of international master.\n\nIn 1997, I joined the web start-up Viaweb, where I helped develop the shopping search engine that has since become Yahoo! Shopping.\n\nIn 1998, I joined Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs, where I worked on “probabilistic inference” algorithms, such as the famous “belief propagation” algorithm, and their applications in a variety of fields, including communications, signal processing, and artificial intelligence."
