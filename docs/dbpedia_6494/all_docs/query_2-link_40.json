        "text": "I was trying to plow right through “Home Life” in order to get my review in on time, but it was impossible. Every few pages, had to stop and admire the book—or simply sit back and feel it. My God, but my fellow creatures are fascinating! I found myself thinking. How touching, how absurd, how real they are! All at once I was delighted to be sharing their destiny. Not that “Home Life” is a happy book—far from it. But it doesn't matter, because its people are so dimensional. It's so reassuring — positively exhilarating — to find that we haven't yet been flattened out by life, our features abraded away by the sheer rush of phenomena.\n\nDorothy Rabinowitz can make you feel the very sweat in people's palms, the jitters in their limbs as they struggle with their anxieties, the restless flickering of their eyes, seeking or avoiding recognitions, the confusions of tongue and teeth as they try to say two contradictory things at once. At the home for the aged, a son is describing the idyllic life he offered his unappreciative parent, when suddenly he stands up and points: “See that, the color of the file cabinet, see that color? That was the color of the grass out there.” And yet his father complained. A daughter is explaining how much she loves her mother, how she'd like to keep her at home. Only her son, her son is 17 now and he needs a mom to put a desk in. He needs a desk to study at. It's not a question of her mother's age, the daughter says over and over, not her defective hearing or her funny little habits—it's a question of a place for a desk for her son. A desk to study at.\n\nCan't Bear Waiting\n\nAnother son has a mother who lives contentedly alone—but he worries about her. What if she were to fall and break a hip, both hips? She would be unable to reach the telephone. True, he calls her daily, but she might fall after he calls. Though she had no difficulty whatever in walking, he felt that his mother had to fall sonner or later and he couldn't bear the waiting. Like so many other sons and daughters, he felt that it was unreasonable, illogical, for such an elderly person to go on standing upright. She stubbornly refused to progress in life, to advance to meet her, inevitable fate.\n\nWhen these mothers and fathers finally do enter the Home, they sign away everything. Of the 14 paragraphs in the contract, there are 13 detailing the things the resident surrenders and only one stating what the home offers in return. It is unconditional surrender: besides all property, real and personal, the resident even relinquishes the right to choose the manner of his own funeral. What they cannot sign away, though, are their egos, their value systems, their judgment. Many die soon after arriving—the largest number in the first 13 weeks. Most of them die alone; there is rarely time to summon relatives. One old man was universally admired at having beaten the rap. While visiting his daughter for a weekend outside the home, he had the good fortune to die there. In his old bedroom.\n\nThere are some fierce spirits who stand out, like Mr. Blazer. In the central hall of his home, there was an enormous Matisse candelabrum — a $25,000 donation from a philanthropist. Approaching the work in the spirit of one who has received a gift, Mr. Blazer habitually hung his hat on the uppermost branch, tucked his books and papers in the recesses of the sculpture and sat down to write on the base. Not everyone, however, knew how to use what was given to him. Mr. Stone, for example, had not wished to enter the Home. He was only persuaded by singing. The staff discovered that he liked to sing and sang him into signing up. For a while, he was happy, in a sing‐along sort of way —until he found that no one ever talked to him. When he tried to formulate the questions his new life raised in his mind, the people just sang at him until he stopped trying.\n\nA Physical Object\n\nThere are two Homes described in the book. Mr. Trommler's is run on scientific lines. He explains to his staff that there must always be a physical object, preferably a table, between a staff member and a “client” (resident). In the absence of a table, a briefcase, a notebook, or a wastepaper basket may be used to symbolize the interdynamic relationship between them. Unless people are separated into distinct sides, symbolized by an object‐barrier, there can, naturally, be no interdynamics.\n\nMr. Byron, director of the other Home, likes to be surrounded by creative people. His staff is heavy with writers, filmmakers, tap dancers. One young man is hired mainly because he spent a year in South Africa and was going to bring “a certain exotic background” into the Home. Mr. Byron would have liked to hire someone with a prison record too—not a murderer—to share some of his experiences with the residents.\n\n“Home Life” is presented as “a documentary, which employs some of the techniques of fiction.” Its people and institutions are described as “composite portraits.” We knew better. Yedida Nielsen has devoted many years to professional work among the aged—but with all due respect to her, it is Dorothy Rabinowitz, the writer of the book, who enables Miss Nielsen's knowledge to lay living hands on us. Where another author might have raged, accused, exhorted, she has made us experience her subject as only an artist can. She has captured scenes and conversations that show how much the Theater of the Absurd still has to learn; she makes an abstract by comparison. At the end of the book, she quotes an old woman's answer to the question: What would you do if you had your life to live over again? What would I do with my life? the old woman muses. “I'd grasp it.” This is what Dorothy Rabinowitz has done: she's it."
