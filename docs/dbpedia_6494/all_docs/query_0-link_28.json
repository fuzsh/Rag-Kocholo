        "text": "I enjoy working with children and adolescents to establish a warm therapeutic relationship. My goal is for my clients to not just improve but to thrive so that they can grow and mature to be successful and productive members of society. I enjoy working with parents and teachers to help them better understand their children and students and to foster a more peaceful and productive home and classroom.\n\nIn my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my husband (also a psychologist!) and two young children. I also enjoy reading, exercise, and participating in community events."
