        "text": "Living with a rare disease is expensive. While I agree with the cliches that “money can’t buy happiness” and “time is more valuable than money,” the limited financial aid available to patients stresses me out.\n\nWhen I was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in 2016, I wasn’t thinking about the expenses that’d be involved. Although IPF is a progressive and life-threatening lung disease, I lived well with it for the first couple years. I hadn’t yet noticed the shortness of breath, dry cough, or extreme fatigue that I was told I’d experience. It wasn’t until I had my first exacerbation that I began to deal with symptoms, and I was suddenly faced with more costs as a result.\n\nIn 2018, I wrote a column about needing help maintaining my home. Cutting the grass, shoveling snow, and tending to the gardens was too difficult for me while on supplemental oxygen, but getting help involved additional expenses. Once I returned to work following that initial exacerbation, I was able to manage these extra costs by developing and sticking to a budget.\n\nWhile lung transplantation can help prolong and improve quality of life, there’s no cure for IPF. The goal, typically, is to manage symptoms and slow progression of the fibrosis (or scarring). Fast forward to today, when though my disease has progressed, I thankfully have a dedicated team helping me manage it. Unfortunately, my ability to manage IPF effectively depends on finances.\n\nHigh costs can be a barrier to care\n\nEven with supplemental oxygen, I’m still working full time and doing extra work for additional income. Although I stick to a budget, sometimes medical expenses are out of reach without financial assistance.\n\nRecently, I made the difficult decision to stop using a biologic medication that was intended to help reduce my shortness of breath. This drug is relatively new to the market, and while it’s unclear if the medicine benefits those with IPF, there’s a lot of evidence saying it can be helpful for those with asthma — a condition I’ve had since I was young. I wasn’t on the biologic long enough to assess whether it was effective for me, but unfortunately, I can’t afford to keep taking it.\n\nI’m grateful that a patient support program assisted me with a portion of the cost and that my employee benefits covered part of it as well. But even the remaining amount was too much for me. This biologic costs more than $3,000 per month, and while I wish I could’ve given it a longer trial, the expense was prohibitive.\n\nAfter eight years of living with IPF, the financial burden is one of my main sources of stress. Unfortunately, a lot of people don’t think about this issue unless they’re forced to, so I want to raise awareness about the high costs associated with rare diseases. Whether it’s the price of medications, added homeownership costs, or other expenses, there isn’t enough financial aid support for those of us with rare conditions.\n\nI’m going to start a discussion about this topic in the Pulmonary Fibrosis News Forums. Hopefully, others can share financial aid or assistance options for people to reference. If you know of such resources, you’re welcome to share them in the comments below."
