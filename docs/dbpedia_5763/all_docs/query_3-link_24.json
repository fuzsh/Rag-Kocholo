        "text": "Recent work on end-to-end neural network-based architectures for machine translation has shown promising results for English-French and English-German translation. Unlike these language pairs, however, in the majority of scenarios, there is a lack of high quality parallel corpora. In this work, we focus on applying neural machine translation to challenging/low-resource languages such as Chinese and Turkish. In particular, we investigate how to leverage abundant monolingual data for these low-resource translation tasks. Without the use of external alignment tools, we obtained up to a $1.96$ BLEU score improvement with our proposed method compared to the previous best result in Turkish-to-English translation on the IWLST 2014 dataset. On Chinese-to-English translation by using the OpenMT 2015 dataset, we were able to obtain up to a $1.59$ BLEU score improvement over phrase-based and hierarchical phrase-based baselines.\n\nRecently, neural machine translation (NMT) has been extended to multilinguality, that is to handle more than one translation direction with a single system. Multilingual NMT showed competitive performance against pure bilingual systems. Notably, in low-resource settings, it proved to work effectively and efficiently, thanks to shared representation space that is forced across languages and induces a sort of transfer-learning. Furthermore, multilingual NMT enables so-called zero-shot inference across language pairs never seen at training time. Despite the increasing interest in this framework, an in-depth analysis of what a multilingual NMT model is capable of and what it is not is still missing. Motivated by this, our work (i) provides a quantitative and comparative analysis of the translations produced by bilingual, multilingual and zero-shot systems; (ii) investigates the translation quality of two of the currently dominant neural architectures in MT, which are the Recurrent and t...\n\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel approach to generate synthetic data for training Neural Machine Translation systems. The proposed approach transforms a given parallel corpus between a written language and a target language to a parallel corpus between a spoken dialect variant and the target language. Our approach is language independent and can be used to generate data for any variant of the source language such as slang or spoken dialect or even for a different language that is closely related to the source language. The proposed approach is based on local embedding projection of distributed representations which utilizes monolingual embeddings to transform parallel data across language variants. We report experimental results on Levantine to English translation using Neural Machine Translation. We show that the generated data can improve a very large scale system by more than 2.8 Bleu points using synthetic spoken data which shows that it can be used to provide a reliable tran...\n\nNeural Machine Translation (NMT) is an end-to-end learning approach for automated translation, with the potential to overcome many of the weaknesses of conventional phrase-based translation systems. Unfortunately, NMT systems are known to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation inference â€“ sometimes prohibitively so in the case of very large data sets and large models. Several authors have also charged that NMT systems lack robustness, particularly when input sentences contain rare words. These issues have hindered NMT's use in practical deployments and services, where both accuracy and speed are essential. In this work, we present GNMT, Google's Neural Machine Translation system, which attempts to address many of these issues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder layers using residual connections as well as attention connections from the decoder network to the encoder. To improve parallelism and therefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom layer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the final translation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference computations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited set of common sub-word units (\" wordpieces \") for both input and output. This method provides a good balance between the flexibility of \" character \"-delimited models and the efficiency of \" word \"-delimited models, naturally handles translation of rare words, and ultimately improves the overall accuracy of the system. Our beam search technique employs a length-normalization procedure and uses a coverage penalty, which encourages generation of an output sentence that is most likely to cover all the words in the source sentence. To directly optimize the translation BLEU scores, we consider refining the models by using reinforcement learning, but we found that the improvement in the BLEU scores did not reflect in the human evaluation. On the WMT'14 English-to-French and English-to-German benchmarks, GNMT achieves competitive results to state-of-the-art. Using a human side-by-side evaluation on a set of isolated simple sentences, it reduces translation errors by an average of 60% compared to Google's phrase-based production system."
