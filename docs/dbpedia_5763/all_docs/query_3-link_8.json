        "text": "In April 2006, the Swiss Defence Procurement Agency (Armasuisse) ordered 18 EC635s for the Schweizer Luftwaffe, to replace the aging Aérospatiale Alouette III in performing transport and advanced training missions. The first two aircraft were built by Eurocopter, while the remaining 16 are built by RUAG Aerospace in Alpnach, Switzerland.\n\n(Grindelwald, July 2014, Michiel van Herten)\n\nThe Swiss VIP fleet can be found near the capital Bern. Here seen is T-784, the Cessna 560XL visiting Rotterdam-The Hague International.\n\n(Rotterdam - The Hague Int', November 2013, Maarten Visser)\n\nThe Schweizer Luftwaffe utilizes the Pilatus Porter PC-6 as a light transport category aircraft. Its robust design and short-field take-off and landing capability allow it to operate in nearly every region. Today the Porter serves mainly as a transport aircraft for personnel and equipment and is further utilized in scouting operations and in the dropping of parabats. The Porter also aids in combating forest fires with the aid of a built-in water tank. In the event of a war these Porters will be incorporated into a utility aircraft squadron.\n\n(Buochs, Jun 2014, Leonard van Teeffelen)\n\nIn 2006, the Swiss Government granted authorisation to purchase six Pilatus PC-21 turboprop trainers. They are delivered in 2007 and 2008 as part of JEPAS (Jetpiloten Ausbildungssystem), prior to commencing replacement of the F-5F in the fast jet pilot training role from 2010.\n\n(Payerne, apr 2015, Mark Rourke)\n\nBesides the Patrouille Suise, the Schweizer Luftwaffe has a second aerobatic team called ‘PC-7 Team’. The team was established in 1987 for the occasion of the air force championships in Dubendorf. Then nine planes Pilatus PC-7 make a demonstration, presenting the Schweizer Luftwaffe. But the official founding of the team is in 1989, during the 75-year anniversary of the Schweizer Luftwaffe. Then the team receives its name. In fact ‘PC-7 Team’ is not so active team like Patrouille Suisse, but nevertheless the team makes great impression of the public.\n\n(Sanicole, September 2021, Frank Noort)\n\nThe replacement has already been announced but the Hornets are still going strong in Switzerland. Here a trio at one of the most photogenic airbases in the world: Meiringen\n\n(Meiringen, March 2015, Peter van der Wel)"
