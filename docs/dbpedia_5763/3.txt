All’antica“ has been located in Langenthal’s old porcelain factory since 2009. Here there are a number of other studios, stores, and workshops as well.

The studio of about 45 m2 is divided into two parts: an atelier and a workshop. At the studio you can test the instruments yourself and minor repairs and adjustments can be carried out on the spot.

You are welcome to call or mail me for an appointment.
