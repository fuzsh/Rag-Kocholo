        "text": "Innocence\n\nIt was Day-1 of school for little Shravu, who was just 2 yrs old then. It was on the previous day that her Amma, Appa and Akka were telling the naughty, talkative little girl not to run around the garden in the rain and call her Teacher as “Uma mami” anymore as Uma mami at school was the Head Mistress and would make Big eyes.\n\nThe little girl caught this word “head mistress” and was thinking the whole day about it. She asked about it to her Amma… Due to her baby talks, her Mother, unable to understand the word, she said Head means “Thalai”…. Now things got weirder, Shravu thought Uma mami ‘s Head would be on the table and it’d make big eyes every time Shravu did something naughty. She felt School was something very funny… Mami’s head on the table that’d make big eyes, aunties teaching ABC, food in colorful boxes, water sipper with a belt and lots of papas and babus to play.\n\nJealousy, Irritation, Hatred, Anger\n\n8 yrs passed, Shravu, a 10 year old tomboy with a bob-cut, got her new pair of spects…. A girl with many friends, a gang of her own and a powerful class monitor, loved by all, except that new girl Sahinya who came from B’lore. On Day-15 at school, Shravu was feeling angry and irritated coz many of her classmates, teachers and even her own gang’s members sympathized that new girl Sahinya, who cried in the class and narrated her “accident” story to every student, almost every day. Shravu found it so annoying coz she always felt being isolated and lonely…. Slowly, everyone started praising Sahinya for all the talents she had… Sahinya could sing well, some even joined Sahinya’s music classes, she scored more marks, her best friend Chaitanya started ignoring their 7 yr old friendship. While Sahinya drew really well in the art-class, Shravu always stood outside the class coz she drew donkeys instead of cute dogs, mixed all the paints in the paint palette…. Shravu was good at playing basketball but Sahinya was better at it and she skated really well…. Shravu was now being hated by all in the class, especially her teachers showed great partiality towards Sahinya and Shravu always felt that pain of being ignored, isolated…. Sahinya, though had nothing personal against Shravu.\n\nShravu did have all sort of things against Sahinya and she blamed Sahinya for each and everything…. Shravu did have a few best friends , Teachers and her school’s Principal who were by her side every time….\n\nRealization:\n\n2 yrs passed and the hatred grew more and more…. It was in their 7th std… On the last day of their Annual exam, Shravu was asked to wait for the “class party” by all her friends…. “Why all of a sudden are they asking me to wait for the class party, I am going to leave this school for good, I am shifting to a new place, I will never see their faces again… Is this what making them realize my worth, let’s see” Shravu wondered….. As soon as she entered into their class room, she saw all their friends busily talking to Sahinya…Shravu felt ignored and turned to leave…. She knew it, Sahinya had something up her sleeves to insult her for one last time…. Angry and irritated, Shravu opened the door and walked out…. Abhishek, her good friend called her and pulled her into the class room…. As soon as she entered, some one closed her eyes from behind and walked her…. Shravu knew it, they were going to empty the thrash bin on her head and make her cry….. The person was Sahinya, who closed her eyes…. “Shravu, turn back” said Sahinya…. There was a medium sized choco-vanilla cake on the table with “We Love you Shravu” written on it…. There were candles on it… Her friend Chaitanya gave her a box full of chocolates, a pen and a greeting card…. There were her favorite things, Harry Potter slam book, Mickey mouse toy and a keychain made out of alphabetic beads that read BEST FRIEND neatly designed like a plant with leaves and tiny roses….. Shravu cut the cake and tears welled up her cheeks…. Sahinya hugged Shravu and apologised for not being good to her…. “Sahinya, I am so sorry re, I shouldn’t have hated you these 2 yrs…. Atleast, I should have been a little good to you…. You never gave me a chance to be good re Sahinya…. now I know how much you like me, but see, you are going off to Chennai and I am shifting my house and going to a new school, see, even God doesn’t wants us to be good friends anymore…. but I promise, any day in life we meet each other, we will be in touch through out ok ? “\n\nFear, Cool, Ticklish in the tummy-feel:\n\nShravu joined a “strict” school in the 8th std. The atmosphere in the new school was like that of a military regiment…. So disciplined, so many rules and the worst one being “NO TALKING TO BOYS”…. The day Shravu joined school, she saw a boy being beaten up black and blue by Sastri sir, for talking to a girl… It was in 8th std she for the first time heard the word “Fuck” being told by every one…. She too said “What the Fuck” , wide eyed…. Shravu couldn’t control her feelings for the poor boy who was just beaten up by Sastri sir for talking to her…. She went straight away to the Principal and asked her the reason….. This brave act of hers, to go and talk to the principal, made her the “cool” girl in the school…. Everyone wanted to be-friend her…. the principal herself liked Shravu’s cool attitude and lo’ Shravu was made the school’s ASPL (Assistant school pupil leader). It was all on Shravu’s hands now…. Shravu had that feel of being celebrated again…She had no one who could hate her…. Rules such as “No jeans to school on saturdays” changed, everyone followed Shravu in everything…except that, Shravu was bad at maths and in Keshav sir’s maths class, Shravu stood out atleast once in a week for not doing the previous day’s homework… It so became that many of them, just to give company to Shravu, did not purposely do their homework and would stand with her outside the class some times…\n\nA year passed…Shravu’s parents put her for the intensive course and hence, Shravu joined the other intensive branch of the school….It was in the 9th std……She was now ok in maths coz of that Kalpa School boy Shashank Varma, who clarified all her doubts in maths…. He was a very nice guy… It was her friends Giddi- Maariyah and Moti- TPS who always said “oho….oho…kya chalra re” when ever they saw Shravu and Shashank talking…. Stupid Shravu did not understand why and then this was later explained by her friend Manrit… Since that day, whenever Shravu saw Shashank, she had that “Ticklish in the tummy” feel….\n\nCompetition, Hard-work and Best friends Promises:\n\nIt was in her 10th std, that Shravu felt people are racing her in the scores… Shravu had to do something with her scores… Being the SPL for the school, Shravu found it very hard to manage her studies…. She had this friend Lallu who helped her constantly…. When the bad girl Priyanka scored more than her, Shravu felt the need to score more… It was since that day Shravu put on all her efforts to study much better, score more and set an example to her juniors…. She did it… In the final SSC boards, she stood one among the top 15 in the school… After results, it was time to part from her best friends, her gang , the lovely school, her teachers and every thing that had to do with her school…. Especially Lallu…. She did not want to part from that best friend and that day, she made a promise to her best friend that come what may, we will remain best friends forever….\n\nAnxiety, Tensions, Studiousness, Aims :\n\nShravu took up Life sciences, in her high school (junior college in Hyderabad) and had nothing much than study,study and study…. She was admitted into SCJC Kalasala, one of the famous junior colleges in AP, famous for their targets…. 11th std was full of competition for her…. She did score well, had her titles of “Topper, class first” etc…. Whenever her lecturer said the word “AIM” , Shravu always wondered what it was…. She did not have any personal aim… She did not know what to become in life…. She had a lot of anxiety and tension in the 12th std, because she was struggling to know her aim…. She worked hard, but never knew for what she aimed…. Then one day, after her practical exams, she was told by one of the external lecturers “You will make a great scientist”… She wanted to be a scientist…. Deep in her heart, she always wanted to be that person whose name would feature in the newspaper constantly, above all the articles…. She wanted to be a journalist…. But life had different plans for her…. Life wanted her to be a scientist…\n\nEGO, Pride, Head-strong :\n\nShravu joined college for university education..She took up Biotechnology, Microbiology and Chemistry…. All through her college, she had none to fight against her, none to debate with her… People feared her more than liking her… She topped in studies, excelled in almost everything…She was the college president… She was a terror to those girls who ragged their juniors, she was a counselor to the depressed…Without her consent no event took place in the college…She won laurels for the college and had a name of her own…. She was named “Hitler-ni” …. Girls gossiped about her, being an EGOist, Proud-ish and some really liked her Head-strong attitude…. This Ego crept into her a lot that some started to envy her…. The Ego lead to many losses she never expected in life….\n\nConfusions, Depression, Talent recognition:\n\nAfter Shravu graduated, it was on a rainy afternoon, the D-Day, when she was going to collect her marks memo along with her Appa, their 2-wheeler skid down and they met with an accident… Shravu was badly injured…she and her father were rushed to hospital….It was there that she found out her spine and left knee have a severe injury…She was advised bed rest for atleast 4 months…. Doctors said she can never walk normally for at least a year…. Shravu’s eyes welled up with tears…She could not attend the convocation…More than anything her career had got a big blow, ‘oh shit!’ she thought…She was on bed, unable to walk…All her dreams of doing it big in life shattered…. One precious year of her career was lost…She could not even walk to the loo, what would she do big in life, was Shravu’s biggest question…. While all her friends joined college, she sat down, dis-interested, confused and depressed , self-pitying herself every moment…All that she had was Facebook and few very good online friends who motivated her, though they have never met her in person….. Shravu was encouraged and motivated with her friends’ words, their jokes, and more than all, her boredom was killed… It was at that time that she came to know about this MBA program from distance… Shravu was good at Literature and Science…Management was a new thing to her… She thought she’d dare not do an MBA but this was the only option to keep her career on track… She was told that she had the talent to speak well, write well…..\n\nConfidence, Encouragement, Motivation, Challenges:\n\nIt was 2 months already and Shravu still wasnt out of her bed completely… She tried her best to walk but failed…It was one day, when her phone rang, she walked from her bed and received the call from her friend… After the call Shravu realised that she could walk…. She walked everyday and as days passed, she did some walking with a little limp to the grocery near her house…. Shravu gained a lot of weight and she also hit the gym to lose weight…Her doctors were shocked… She still hated something which was to study for her MBA exams…She hated it to the core…. After her first sem exams, she realized that this will be her challenge in life, to achieve in the field that is new to her….\n\nTaste of success-new determination:\n\nAfter the second semester exams, Shravu slowly started searching for jobs…She failed several interviews…She started gaining interest in Management studies…Meanwhile, she also contributed a lot to her college’s journal…. An institute invited her for a motivational lecture for their students, when her article on Emotional Intelligence was published in a local management journal… It was since that day onward, she took up training for Public Speaking and soft skills…She set up her own niche` among the companies…She still did not get the satisfaction of the job she has taken up…. It was one day, at the bus stop, one boy named Santosh came up to her from his bike and said “Madam, I got a job few months ago… I got promoted as the accounts manager at XYZ corporation and you know what madam, I am going to the UK to represent our team from India, for a presentation…. Thank you so much madam, If it was not your training, I wouldn’t be here today” … Shravu had the most joyful day that day… She got the taste of success…. Now, she realized that when her student himself has done something big, why not she? She got a new determination, to finish her MBA, do a P.hD and satisfy the hunger of Doing it big in life….\n\nSelf-Realization:\n\nToday, as the 22 year old Corporate Trainer pens down these words, she realizes that all the feelings, thoughts, events, memories and lessons she learnt in life are the actual boosters of her career in corporate training. She feels that; probably, all the steps she climbed all these years, are preparing her for the actual world… A world of responsibilities, commitments and above all, reach her one and only target – Dr.Shravanthi on her name plate and start an academy, where people are encouraged to be a better person by talent recognition and those who have the aim of Doing it big in life, even without the piece of paper called Degree 🙂 ….\n\nJoin and Wish Shravu in her endeavor of life…. Go-Shravu – Do it big! ..Go-For it!!!\n\nHey people! Hope you all had a great week… I know weekends are more hectic than weekdays – cleaning, washing, cooking, shopping groceries and finally no rest at all 😦 . Here is something to make you feel light… I am back, a little free from my project and classes, to share with you, some funny incidences, just to lift your spirits and prepare you for the next week’s work at office – Ipidi daan Indian economy will get boosted, when the working class works enthusiastically ( my project report la idhu daan solli addi vaanginen guide kiterndhu 😛 ) . Join me for some fun, leg pulling , loads of laughter and yes, might tickle your thoughts a little… 😛\n\nFew days ago, I had accompanied my parents to a wedding…It was on a Sunday… My Mind voice was cursing my akka , she escaped from coming to the wedding telling that she had to prepare for the next day’s board meeting at office… I know she played Candy crush on Fb…. I was the “Bali aadu/ Scape Goat” . I had to go… I dressed up in my best Kanjivaram Saree (Flashback – “Meenu, Kalyanam muhurtham ku podavai kattiko, andha Mumtaz madri Anarkali potundu odd ah irukaadhe, thalai cut pannindrukai nu viruchu potukaadhe, periyavaa irupa anga, enga maanatha kappal la yethaade…Ozhunda Adakam Odhukama Vaa, seriya?” – My Amma was giving lecture on dressing up). My face was like this -> 😦 😦 … and again amma told “Sidu moonji vechikadhe, sport a smile and come with us. I tried my best not to grit my teeth in anger- My one and only one Sunday was getting ruined, the drive to the Kalyana Mandapam was very long, Bleddy rains, made Hyderabadi roads absolutely Puke-able . My plans to sleep for extra 1 hour got spoilt, I wanted to watch a movie online, that also full flop. We were getting down from the car when Amma got down and “Indha jeans um t-shirt um potundu romba kettu poidardhugal kuttigal..Naaliki un kalyanathilayum 9 gajam Madisar vida Pattu trouser um Pattu T-shirt um potu vidaren iru” thittifyingly seri aakified my saree’s fall… I was almost embarrassed at the gate. I knew, I was going to face more crap…\n\nNow, dear readers, Brace yourselves to know the type of Relatives I have…\n\nAs soon as we entered into the hall, there was this Panneer thelikara cousins…. So here we go,\n\nType 1 – Panneer sprinkler Cousins: Girls dressed in Pattu Paavadai Daavani, hardly in college and high school are given the job of panneer sprinkling. Here, the situation was different, these girls were actually busy on their girly- discussions and posing for photographs.. As usual the ANNOYING HAND ON HIP pose…. And some guys, were seen flirting with these girls.. I saw waterfalls flowing from their mouth… These girls, totally forget what duty they have been given… So much of Panneer waste-u, po!\n\nType 2 – Voluntary Reception Committee Members: These relatives, no matter how much ever distant relative’s marriage it is, they do the work of Receptionist. As soon as some one enters, they wish you with a “Good morning” and inform the others that you have arrived – As if we haven’t got an appointment to greet the newly-weds 😛 .\n\nType 3 – Aathuku Periyava- Safety lockers: Some 70+ aged periyava, dressed in cotton Madisar or Pancha, sit in some corner of the kalyana mandapam, taking care of their grand children. Bags, slippers and all are left with these people, when the others go on the kalyana stage or to meet others. These people are the ones who get most tired, blessing every one who fall on their feet. My amma and appa asked me also to bend, like, to almost 10 of them sitting in different corners and rooms of the kalyana mandapam, to seek blessings ” Seekram kalyanam aagattum noku” and compliments that include hugs and kisses from very sweet paatis ” Ethra azhaga irukai di kozhandei nee, unga amma chinnapo ipidi daan irundaa” and some spice from thathas ” Unga appa ipidi daan gaeli panni pesuvan, avanodu korangu thanam ellam noku apdiye vandhirukku”. No, I did not miss my gym that day, so much of bending must have burnt more calories, than,that I’d burn on my daily workout sessions 😛 . But I did feel nice seeing many thathas and Paatis, I did not miss my thatha and Pechammai that day ❤ .\n\nType 4- Ever-youth Aunties and Uncles : Some 45+ aunties and uncles, dressed in their best sexiest-semi-traditional outfits. They are usually seen as couples, posing to be the best “love-jodi” and still young after 20 yrs of marriage… Some even koo-chi-koo and show PDA there – Un-Sahikable of all you know!\n\nType 5- Advisers, Flirts, Show off-ers and Vetty Fellows : When you attend a kalyanam, you are introduced to a new group of cousins….\n\nAdvisers-The 28-30 yr old cousins, usually Foreign return- jobless-or IITians, dressed up in Veshti, with thin rimmed specs, advice you about career, research, life, philosophy and what not! These guyz are mostly the center of attraction among fat-flabby aunties and uncles, pecked and followed to get married to their daughters.\n\nFlirts – The not so handsome according to me, type of guys, feel off like they are Manmadhans and Kameshwarans. Buffaloes! They flirt with every possible girl in the kalyanam…. As if their only purpose is to “Pataofy” a girl in the kalyana mandapam… I find these guys are like those dogs, which chase vehicles, with no intention of driving them. I am always a Lady Hitler to these Flirts, they hate me to the core coz I ridicule them a lot – Who cares? 😛\n\nShow off-ers- Uff, these girls, mostly my age (22-25) , when I think I can break the ice with some good general topic, all they blabber is about their boy friends, shopping, slippers, nail-polish…Some half-mad and 3/4th Mad girls end up being Price Tags yaar! All they speak is about the branded accessories they bought…. I can’t help laughing wickedly, knowing from where they actually purchased the so-called Branded stuff 😛 😀 .\n\nVetty-Fellows – I love this , “my-type” cousins… They are cool, fun and above all, they join me in making fun of people 😛 .\n\nType 6- Gossip Box, Suggestion box, Double meaners, Loud mouth and Boasters :\n\nGossip Box: Mostly mamis who gossip about anyone, no matter they know the person or not…They make great story writers 😛 .\n\nSuggestion box: These are mamis and mamas who keep giving useless suggestions… Like, if you wear a saree and you plait your hair, they say “konjam poo vechundrukalam ayirundhuthu” and you are like “nods head like a boom boom maadu” to all that they say.\n\nDouble meaners : They are the most idiotic people, you’d ever get to see in this world. Anything you speak, they mean it the other way round. You talk to a guy and they say “eyy eyy, enna maa, romba otti otti nikkarai, enna un aala ivan” and you are like “huh, paithyama, he is my bro”!\n\nLoud Mouth: Their voices are so loud, that even when you tell a very personal secret, it doesn’t remain one! They whisper so loud…Their voices are heard louder than the Ghetti-melam and nadaswaram. 😛\n\nBoasters: The most ANNOYING, IRRITATING, BLEDDY CREATURES you ever get to see in the gatherings. Be it a wedding or a funeral, they just can’t stop boasting about their children, sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, husband, mamiyar, mamanar and even their Dog’s poop! They boast so much and compare their pet dog’s poop with that of your pet’s, that you sometimes end up feeling guilty or at least think for a moment that your Pet is a constipate! 😛\n\nType-7 The Good , Bad and Worst eaters : I never compromise when it comes to food… Enga pona enna, Kalyanam nu vandha, nambalukku soru thaan mukhiyum 😀 . There are these Good eaters, who make a great company for you while eating.\n\nThere are these bad eaters, who stare at your plate or plantain leaf while you are relishing a good dish and make constipate-acidity-fart from mouth- faces…It is so irritating that at some point you feel like slapping them hard on their face and tie their eyes up and continue relishing the mysour-turned mysore pak.\n\nWorst eaters are worser than worst! They eat and make a mess on the table or floor, so much that you end up puking on your plate. These people really need a “good table manners” orientation class.\n\nThere are many more crazy relatives who pose like Singers, Dancers, Highest officials, Match makers etc., about whom, you all already know….\n\nSo, these are the types of relatives I have… I know, you too will have similar people in your families, without these people, we seriously wouldn’t have so much to get irritated, crib or laugh about. Our relatives are unique, irritating and at the same time, very funny people, without them , any function, funeral or any public gathering is incomplete…..\n\nNote: If any reader finds his/her character matching with the stereotypes I have mentioned, don’t run around to hit me 😛 😛 😛\n\nKeep laughing and Spread laughter…\n\n❤\n\nMeenu (Aarya) .\n\nHello, Namaskaram to all my dear readers….

Chennai MaaNagarathula oru area, Kolathur, anga in a cute yet Traditional Iyengar household, lives Revathi…. Daughter of Mr. & Mrs. Santhanam….\n\nRevathiiiiiiiiiiiii………………kelambiyaacha ma?? School ku late aagardhu, inniki noku exam vera….\n\nIdho varen Amma……\n\nRevathi, a 9th grader, smart, sweet, chirpy, bubbly- yet very kind girl, studies in Kulapathi Dr. BalaKrishna School….\n\nRevathi, final exam daane, you’ll do really well, Hayagrivar unna kaapathuvar, tension eduthukade..Naan unakaaga vendikaren….\n\nRevathi’s appa, Mr. Santhanam says looking at his little girl tensed at the breakfast table.\n\nMeanwhile, In Revathi’s mind “ Haiyo, exam ellaam periya prachanaiye illai Appa…Indha Ashwin paiyan mela naan vechrukardhu nijama ve love ah, illai verum attraction ah, onnume puriyaliye….”\n\nPaathela makkale, indha 9th grader mind la enna iruku nu? 😛\n\nKulapathi Dr. S. Balakrishna Joshi School – Chennai – May 2005 :\n\nElla kadhai layum hero entry super ah, dashing ah irukum, indha kadhai la twist paarungo….\n\nRevathi reaches school…. “ Revathi, yaaru ma kozhandei, andha paiyan, ipidi sandai podaran, NARAYANA, poonool vera teriyardhu shirt lerndhu, ipidi sandai podaran, avaaloda laam nee friendship eh vechika koodadhu, seriya ma? Chamatha exam ezhuditu vaa,last exam verai, sheekrama mudichutu aathuku vaa, We’ll go to Parthasarathy Perumal Koil and from there, a nice Dinner at Saravana Bhavan. ok? ”\n\n“Seri Appa, 🙂 ”\n\nMeanwhile Revathi’s mind voice , “Appa Ipidi elaam bomb podaraangale, haiyo…. Appa, ivan daan appa Ashwin, I like him Appa…. Ippove neengal ipidi chonna epidi paa? NARAYANAAAA….. 😦 ”\n\nRevathi, Chamatha finished her 9th grade with a decent score of 95.5% and entered into 10th grade….\n\nIt all started in their 10th grade… Revathi’s feelings for Ashwin Iyer grew day by day…. She liked his Morattu Kaalai temperment, His Short temper, his smile, his talks,… Every thing he did, attracted Revathi, even the way he wrote notes attracted her….\n\nDuring class hours Revathi would stare at Ashwin silently from the corner of her eye, just to ensure he is in the class…. She even got caught and scolded by her Teachers once or twice for not being attentive in class….\n\n“Who cares, I like looking at Ashwin, I will look at him, classes and lessons eppidiyo pogattum” saying so in her mind, Revathi chuckled, when her Tamil Teacher was scolding her…. 😀 😀 😀\n\nAll over her 10th grade, Revathi only thought about Ashwin, apart from studies. She still doubted if this was actually the right age to fall in love…. The academic year passed on…. It was in the Margazhi Maasam, Revathi realised she was Actually in love with Ashwin…. Thoughts about separating from Ashwin after 10th grade, actually gave a lot of pain to Revathi’s heart… She wanted to convey it to her guy, she thought various tricks including writing a note to him, nothing worked out….\n\nMay 2006:\n\n“I am going to propose Ashwin, come what may, I don’t care, I don’t want to lose him…At any cost, I will propose him” … Revathi thought for herself…\n\nRevathi had a feeling of butterflies in her stomach, nervousness crept, her hands shivered, her big round eyes closed out of shyness and the 16 yr old walked straight to Ashwin, on the last day of their 10th boards and she confessed her love for him….\n\nAshwin did not reply with a yes or no, he just smiled and walked away with friends…. This left her in a dilemma…..\n\nIt was months after Revathi confessed her feelings to Ashwin… She awaited his reply everyday…. Fact was, he moved on to a residential school, for his 11th and 12th grades…. Revathi worked hard and topped in her class….. Everyday, atleast once, she saw her 10th class photo, not to see her friends, but Ashwin’s face….\n\nBoth, Revathi and Ashwin lost contact with each other….\n\nRevathi, for 2 years of her high schooling, lived all the memories she had at school, she laughed thinking about the mischief he did at school and sometimes, tears rolled on her cheeks, fearing whether Ashwin actually forgot her…. She had mixed emotions…there wasn’t a single day she did not think about Ashwin…. Revathi sometimes dreamt as if Ashwin came down to her place and accepted her love… She even dreamt about Ashwin getting married to her…. Kanavula Revathi even sang Duets and all…. 😛\n\nWhen ever she felt low, Revathi would convince herself that Ashwin will come back to her, some day….\n\nApril 2008:\n\nRevathi finished her 12th with a good grade and her appa gifted her a mobile phone….\n\nDays passed, one fine day, Revathi got Ashwin’s contact… They spoke to each other via messages, innumerable phone calls…..\n\nA month passed… Revathi’s confidence grew on Aswin, she still, did have a lot of confusions…. I guess, she even asked him if he actually had any girl friends and things like that 😉\n\nIt was on 27th May 2008, that Revathi’s love succeeded … Ashwin accepted the Love Revathi had (she still does, a lot in fact 😛 ) for him…4 years, of Reva’s love for Ashwin finally gave fruits….. Aprom ennachu? Neku teriyadhu….. But yes, Reva had tears of Anandam…. “Anandam Anandam , Aanandame….. Revz’ love got Accepted yaay…” ❤ ❤\n\nIt has been 6 yrs of their love, it is growing stronger and much stronger…. Let us all pray that Revathi Santhanam becomes Mrs. Revathi Ashwin soon…. 🙂\n\nRevz and Ashwin , I hope you guys liked this (Obviously, it is your own love story), but still… ❤ ❤ ❤\n\nNow, time for Author’s note, I hope you still have a few sips of Kaapi and a few Bhajjis on your plate…. Idha padichunde saapdungo, saaptunde padeengo 😛\n\nFriends, this true story teaches many things to us,\n\n1. Love has no age,\n\n2. True and Strong love never fails,\n\n3. If marriages are made in heaven, the partners are chosen by God, If your love is very strong, even God himself can never separate…even if there is a small separation, Love surely brings them together….\n\nTrue love is absolutely unconditional, there will be no expectations or demands…. Well, this message I am giving is not only for the lovers, people who have got an arranged marriage done are also lovers…. There might be several mis-understandings, minor issues, fights and such things between each other…. Learn to adjust, have strong faith in your love for your better half… Trust me friends, your life, even with many highs and lows, will run as smooth as eating an Ice cream….\n\nLive , Share and Spread love…. 🙂 😀 ❤\n\nEllarukkum Namaskaram…. Naan Meenu odu amma here…. I know how irritated you all are, after reading my daughter’s posts, ungala romba kalaichu vittruka iliya en ponnu?\n\nAnyway, fun aside, en ponnu ku time illai, paavam kozhandai padippu la busy ah iruka, so this time, I have taken her place, no, don’t mistake me for a funny post . Well, this is something quite serious…. Off recent, I have been seeing many people cribbing and talking bad about our practices about the menstrual “theetu” and many end up in a dilemma, whether to follow it in this modern Wi-Fi age also… Being frank , we were being brought up in a very orthodox environment, and so are my children. So indha post la, I am going to discuss how scientifically this “theetu” observance is right.\n\n1. Why are we asked to sit aside, given bland food and are treated as untouchables, why cant we cook and work?\n\nA. Well, you are asked to sit aside because, every time you menstruate, your body generates fresh blood… so, in order to avoid infections , you are asked to sit aside. Bland food because, if you eat spicy food, you are eating it at your own risk… As such, the so called PMS increases your Bp and this only results in more stress. Being treated as untouchables, no way! When you enter into a temple, are you allowed to touch the pure Idol of the God? No right, unless the person has so much powers, they cannot touch the Idol…. Similarly, you are purest when you are menstruating. Hence, you are treated equal to God. Why don’t you order from a restaurant and eat instead of stressing up so much, you are already stressed up with your work life…why not take rest instead? You can always ask your better half to cook for you…If not any other day, why not these 3 days?\n\n2.I want to sleep on the bed..Sleeping on the mat gives me back ache!\n\nA. No compromise in this matter…Sleep on the mat, spread a thick bed sheet to give you the cozy bed’s feel… I am sure you all have thick quilts… If not, take out your mom’s old cotton sarees, give them to a quilt tailor, he will make one for you – Isn’t it a best way to recycle and reuse? If not, you get cotton, washable quilts at Nalli.\n\nFine, I’ll tell you a simple reason for you to sleep on the mat…. During menses, your body tends to bleed more at nights (You cannot deny this fact) than the day time… Why do you want to sit in embarrassment with stained bed and mattresses? Instead, this is a wonderful option….\n\n3. I hate applying manjal all over on my face… I don’t want to look like a jaundice patient!\n\nA. I suggest a natural therapy to clear all the acne and heat boils you got before menstruation. You are all very well aware that Turmeric is anti-septic, anti-cancerous and is one of the widely used herb in your facial creams, skin therapy. Why do you want to spend so much amount on skin therapy? Apply manjal on the day of Theetu kuliyal, instead of using some useless chemical products that make your skin porous…..Using Manjal makes your skin glow and makes you look younger…. As simple as that!\n\n4. Ennai thechu kuliyal on the 5th day, I just have any time… Can i compromise with the easily washable hair oils like? Nallennai is just sticky!!!\n\nA. Nallennai or Gingelly oil has the properties to nourish your body, it gives you great relief from body pains and yes, it makes your uterus healthy. We were asked to eat Roasted ellu podi with vellam everyday, after we reached puberty… Reason – It strengthens your bones, provides a lot of calcium and yes, it regulates your hormones, allowing you to menstruate every month, without fail. Oh yes, Nallennai is easily washable, take time, use a proper shampoo ( I suggest Sheekai-Rita(Soap nut)-Payathamaav, mixed in 2:1:1 spoon ratio, made into a paste) and a conditioner (I suggest curd, don’t use egg..makes your hair to stink for ages).\n\nConclusion: Enna paa, indha Meenu oda Amma, avala vida mosama advice pannarale nu nanaikadeengo… Our ancestors have kept these things with a reason…. It is to maintain sanctity and hygiene and is absolutely not superstition or blind belief…. If you want to maintain good health and cleanliness, you may observe this…. If you do not follow, it is up to you, but please do not spread false information about our culture. Everything has been kept with a reason behind, and is for good. If you crib or curse yourself for menstruating, kindly stop it and celebrate femininity…. Every time you menstruate, remember, Mother nature is only reminding how wonderful you are, how fertile you are… Celebrate it!\n\nAbout Amma :\n\nMrs. Chitra Prem- A Commerce graduate, a Fashion Designer certified by the government , a motivational speaker, an entrepreneur and a home maker, who is a Hyderabadi Tambrahm woman, who maintains a balance between traditions and modern life style in her family and expects the same from the society.
