        "text": "\"From six months intimacy with the inmates of this wat [Wat Bowonniwet - วัดบวรนิเวศวิหารราชวรวิหาร] I have been led to conclude that there is a strong tendency in the new school of priests to the rejection of every thing in religion which claims a supernatural origin, or that has any thing to do with other than the present state of existence. A Buddhist is ipso facto an atheist, as he does not acknowledge a Creator and Supreme Ruler. Still his religion is full of the supernatural - full of the past and of the future. Chao Fa [เจ้า ฟ้า = Vajirañāṇo Bhikkhu] and his followers, are strongly inclined, if I mistake not, to deny the existence of a heaven and a hell, and of any kind of a future state. And yet they do not openly declare this as their creed. They are obliged to preach the Buddhist religion. When they broach these infidel notions they speak of them as held by some third person. \"There are those in Siam who hold so and so.\" They dare not say that they adopt them themselves. . . For the sake of giving you a clearer idea of the posture of mind of C.F. [Chao Fa] and his followers, I will give you an extract from my journal.\n\nJany. 2, 1846. I am getting a c!earer insight into the character of the peculiar views of the new party in the priesthood. There is a strong tendency among them to the rankest atheism, but at the same time, there seems to be something that is praiseworthy lying at the foundation of this party. C.F. [Chao Fa] and his priests have several times of late inquired whether there are any enlightened scientific men in America who do not believe in the existence of a God, of angels or devils, or of a future state of rewards and punishments. When I have replied that there are some such, they say, 'there are such here,' yet in such a way as that none could accuse them of indulging such a belief. When informed that those who embrace such views in our country are usually of the vile sort, they reply that it is not so here. 'The great body of the priesthood,' they say, 'are constantly fleecing the people of the little they have by telling them that giving to the priests will merit heaven, while withholding exposes them to hell. But there is a class who pity the common people and despise this kind of teaching, and, seeing that heaven and hell are used in this despicable way, they are disposed to swing off to the opposite extreme and entirely abandon the use of these sanctions. ' They slide over the whole subject by saying to the people, ' if there be a heaven, or hell, a God, devils, a future state etc. you will know it after death ... '\"\n\n[Zitiert in: Bradley, William L.: Prince Mongkut and Jesse Caswell. -- http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/1961/JSS_054_1d_Bradley_PrinceMongkutAndJesseCaswell.pdf. -- Zugriff am 2013-07-07]\n\n\"The death of the old king in 1851 created a crisis in Siamese affairs which, but for the wisdom shown by the chief officers of state, might have resulted disastrously for the interests of the country. At that time there were two legitimate lines of succession, each with its supporters. On the one side were the king's two brothersChow Fa Yai and Chow Fa Noi ; on the other were a number of sons, any one of whom might have occupied the throne. With a perspicacity which did them credit, two powerful noblemen took the lead in advancing the claims of the former, and they completely succeeded by their prompt and bold measures in securing for the brothers a whole-hearted acceptance at the hands of the people. Chow Fa Yai, the elder, was chosen for the supreme position, and Chow Fa Noi became \"second king\"a position which gave title without powerthe form of royalty without the substance. Both were remarkable men. The kingPhrabaht Somdetch Paramindr Maha Mongkutto give him his full regal name, was, says a writer who knew him well, \"a man of extraordinary genius and acquirements, a theologian and founder of a new school of Buddhist thought. At one time in the priesthood, he was eminent amongst the monks for his knowledge of Buddhist scriptures, and boldly preached against the canonicity of those whose teachings were opposed to his reason and his knowledge of modern science. His powers as a linguist were considerable, and enabled him to use an English library with facility. His majesty was well versed in mathematics and astronomy.\"\n\n[...]\n\nAn almost immediate result of this king's accession was a great widening of the avenues of Government employment for Europeans. Indeed, the modern European official hierarchy may be said to date its birth from this period. Under the rule of Somdetch Pra Nang Klow about the only persons of Western origin employed were persons with nautical knowledge, whose services were indispensable in the navigation of the square-rigged vessels which during the reign came into vogue. The new king had none of the prejudices of his predecessors against the foreigner. He welcomed Europeans to his capital as a necessary element in the new system under which trade was no longer the special province of the king, but was open to all who desired to enter into it. Many strangers, recruited from most of the nations of continental Europe, flocked to Bangkok. A few of them secured Government employment. The number would have been greater, but for the miserably inadequate pay which the authorities offered. The usual rate was 48 dollars per month. \"A greater sum than this was rarely, if ever, given, no matter what the European's ability, and the Siamese then thought this an exorbitant sum, and, compared with the pay of the great nobles, it was so.\" In the early days of the reign Captain Impey and Mr. T. G. Knox proceeded from India to Siam, and for a season found official employment. The former, after a brief stay, returned to India. Mr. Knox drifted into the service of the second king, whose troops he trained. Subsequently he became Interpreter at the British Consulate, and finally Consul-General. M. Lamache, a Frenchman, was another of the earlier European officials; and there were also several Americans, notably a Mr. Gardener, who was put in charge of the king's printing office. The wives of the American missionaries had also a sort of official connection by their being engaged as teachers of the royal children. Their services were dispensed with after a period, and Mrs. Leonowens, the talented writer previously referred to, was engaged to perform the duties which they had discharged.\"\n\n[...]\n\nPhrabaht Somdetch Paramendr Maha Mongkut died towards the close of 1868, his brother the second king having predeceased him by several years.\"\n\n[Quelle: Arnold Wright in: Twentieth century impressions of Siam : its history, people, commerce, industries, and resources / ed. in chief: Arnold Wright. -- London [etc.] : Lloyds, 1908. -- S. 63f.]\n\n\"Khrua In Khong (Thai: ขรัวอินโข่ง), one of the most celebrated Thai artists, was active in the 1850s and 1860s during the reign of King Rama IV.\n\nHe was a painter under the patronage of King Rama IV (Mongkut). Khrua In Khong and King Rama IV developed their friendship when they were in the monkhood during the reign of King Rama III. The King was very fond of him. Therefore, once he ascended the throne, he frequently ordered Khrua In Khong to paint murals in numerous temples that he built or restored.\n\nHis style had been greatly influenced by Western painting, thus distinguishing it from other conventional Thai paintings. He is well-known as the first artist to introduce linear perspective to Thai traditional art.[1][2][3]\n\nThe works of Khrua In Khong served under the kings desire to modernize Thailand in order to survive the Western colonialist aspiration. His best-known works are mural paintings in the ubosoth (chapel) of Wat Bowonniwet [วัดบวรนิเวศวิหารราชวรวิหาร] and Wat Borom Niwat [วัดบรมนิวาส].\n\nEarly life\n\nKhrua In Khongs birth date and origins are uncertain. He was born in Bang Chan [บางจาน], Phetchaburi province [เพชรบุรี], Thailand in the reign of King Rama III. He ordained at Wat Ratchaburana (Wat Liap) [วัดราชบูรณะ (วัดเลียบ)]and stayed as a monk for the rest of his life.\n\nHis original name was In not Khrua In Khong, Khrua and Khong were a prefix and postfix words to specify his personal identity.\n\nThe word Khrua [ขรัว] often refers to an elder monk or a person who has strict or moody character. It also meant a teacher who specialized in difficult subjects, and the word Khong [โข่ง] quoting Saan Somdet (Princes Correspondence)\n\n he stayed in monkhood as a neophyte for too long; hence he was called In Khong (falling tone). At first, I thought had mispronounced Khong (low tone) for Khong, I now realize there is no mistake. Taking Hoi Khong for example, it means big snail. Therefore, Khong and Khong are the same. \"[4]\n\nIt was also known that Khrua In Khong was not very sociable. He was an introvert and always stayed alone by himself in order to avoid being interrupted by visitors during his work process. He went as far as entering and leaving his kuti (a monks residence) through the windows.\n\nEducation\n\nThere is no evidence of when and where Khrua In Khong practiced his drawing and painting skill.[3] According to his sketchbook, he started drawing in a conventional Thai artistic style which puts much effort into an outline. All shapes and forms have to be drawn properly, very carefully and precisely. When Siam started exchanging culture with Europe, Khrua In Khong absorbed and learned western style drawing despite never visiting the west even once.[1][5]\n\nCareer\n\nKhrua In Khong and King Rama IV had a close relationship since they were both ordained in the era of King Rama III. When King Rama IV reigned, the friendship still remained. Khrua In Khong became a painter under the patronage of the king and was frequently ordered to paint murals in temples that he built or restored.[1][5] It was mentioned in the royal chronicles\n\n the king demanded the service of Phra Achan In in Painting murals depicting the royal chronicles of the Bangkok period.\n\nKhrua In Khongs early work was not yet departed from Thai traditional artistic motifs. The murals in Ratchakoramanuson pavilion and Ratchaphongsanuson Pavilion at Wat Phra Kaew (วัดพระแก้ว) (Temple of the Emerald Buddha) both reflect Thai conventional style. The subject is also mainly about Buddha. Murals in Wat Mahasamanaram do not depict stories of Buddha, but still closely relate to Buddhism. The murals in Wat Phra Ngam [วัดพระงาม], Ayutthaya [อยุธยา] are the depictions of the life of Buddha.\n\nThe most renowned works of Khrua In Khong are the depictions of Buddhist teachings (Dharma) in Wat Bowonniwet and Wat Borom Niwat which have the figures and buildings in western style. The murals represented Buddhist dharma in the form of allegories. It required a high mental capability to understand the context of the Dharma, for example, the pictures of water lotuses in a pond, horse-racing, and a man pointing the way of virtue.\n\nThe themes of the murals in Wat Bowonniwet and Wat Borom Niwat were not only related to Buddhism, but also political subjects such as the murals that portray George Washingtons residence and the United States Congress.[6]\n\nIn the era of King Rama IV, Western colonialism flourished. The king was concerned with the threat of European countries and urged to modernize Siam in a western way - both technologically and culturally, hence the works of Khrua In Khong were serving his demand.[7]\n\nTechnique and style\n\nKhrua In Khong, although having never visited Europe even once, developed his style from conventional Thai painting to become more western-like by relying on western commercial prints, observations of westerners in Bangkok and his imagination.\n\nThai artistic tradition before the time of Khrua In Khong was unrealistic. The water waves were drawn as overlapping fish scales, the trees look artificial and the figures stood in unnatural poses. In contrast, Khrua In Khong preferred to paint realistic gestures. The scenario, trees, and figures became more natural and realistic like a western painting.[5]\n\nThai artistic motifs depended on the use of lines and flat color without using light and shade, the objects were the same size regardless of their relative distances making the figures and buildings only two dimensions not three dimensions like the western painting. Khrua In Khong was the first Thai artist to use the three-dimensional perspective technique.[1]\n\nIn the meantime, people began exchanging culture and art with European countries. Color materials also began to be imported from abroad. Thus the painting in this period became more vivid and colorful. Khrua In Khong, however, still remained using low saturation, bright objects among dimmed gray and dark background colors. Khrua In Khong was famous for his use of monochromic colors that give harmonious satisfaction, unlike complementary colors. He often used dark shades of blue and green along with light shades of blue, pink and white and avoided contrasting colors. He painted the background with dark colors, male outfits with dark blue and white, while female dresses were light blue or pink making the figures look soft and gentle among shady background that appears like a dreamy landscape.[2][8][9]\n\nDespite the fact that he departed from traditional Thai painting style, the works of Khrua In Khong were still mostly related to Buddhism since he himself stayed in the monkhood for life. Moreover, he had been greatly in\n\nfluenced by the kings religious beliefs as a painter under the Kings patronage.\n\nIn addition, the works of Khrua In Khong were not entirely about Buddhism. They were also important as historical records of political events and social conditions during the reign of King Rama IV.[6]\n\nDisciples\n\nKhrua In Khong had many disciples but only one of them was recorded - Phra Khru Kasin Sangwon [พระครูกสิณสังวร]. He was the abbot of Wat Thong Nopphakhun [วัดทองนพคุณ], who painted murals in Wat Thong Nopphakhun. His murals were allegoric paintings, same as the Dharma Paintings of Khrua In Khong, but the figures were Thai style instead of western.\n\nLater life and deathIt is unclear what caused Khrua In Khongs death and when it was. It is believed to be in the era of King Rama IV because there is no sign of his life and works in the age of King Rama V. It is believed that he stayed as a monk for the rest of his life.\"\n\n[Quelle: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khrua_In_Khong. -- Zugriff am 2017-01-05]\n\n\"The second king was in some respects even more enlightened and gifted than his brother. \"He was noted for his love of whatever was European, and gave himself up to the study of the arts as practised by the nations of the West. His watchword was progress. He purposed to know what gave to the people of the West their success, their power and their influence. His ear was open and his mind awake to all that commanded attention in the arts. ... He studied navigation and the art of shipbuilding very early, even before there were resident Protestant missionaries in Siam. Captain Coffin, who took away those twins that have been the wonder of the world, was one of his first teachers. . . . He did not first direct his architectural skill to shipbuilding. His first essays at practical mechanism were made at repairing watches. The first vessel after a European model made in Siam was built by no less a personage than the present Prime Minister. . . . The second King, while yet only a prince, built several sailing vessels from European models. . . . He fitted up the first steam engine in Siam. It was placed in a small boat, and plied up and down the Menam, to the no little wonder of the uninitiated. The prince also had the honour of introducing the first turning lathe and setting up a machine shop. When the Siamese had war with Cochin China, during the reign of Pra Nano Klow, Chow Fa Noi was made head of the Siamese Navy, and went by sea to aid in the war. This brought out his military character. Ever afterward he showed pride in the military department. None had so fine an arsenal. None surpassed him in the drill maintained among the soldiery. The naval adventure also gave him an opportunity to perfect his knowledge of navigation. He delighted in practical astronomy in all its bearings upon this department. ... He was affable and gentlemanly in all his intercourse with foreigners. His palace was the admiration of all who visited it. It was built after a European model, furnished after European manner, and with European furniture. And his receptions were above invidious criticism. All was order and despatch, with a degree of good taste that was quite wonderful in a man who had never been beyond his own little kingdom.\" (\"Siam Repository,\" 1869.)\"\n\n[Quelle: Arnold Wright in: Twentieth century impressions of Siam : its history, people, commerce, industries, and resources / ed. in chief: Arnold Wright. -- London [etc.] : Lloyds, 1908. -- S. 63f.]"
