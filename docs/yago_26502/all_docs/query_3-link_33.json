        "text": "Panerai’s new, sprawling boutique in Mumbai’s Jio World Plaza heralds a new phase in the luxury watchmaker’s India journey. The boutique is Panerai’s biggest retail space in the country yet with a canvas spanning 60 square metres that allows Panerai to let the space reflect its own world-famous design ethos.\n\n“The new boutique allows us Panerai to introduce its signature design concept and merge it with its central pillars : hospitality and the world of the sea,” says CEO Jean-Marc Pontroué.\n\nThe boutique is one of the few, globally, to feature Panerai’s signature Bar Italiano on its premises. In keeping with Panerai’s dedication to hospitality, the cafe is a space that not only pays homage to Italy’s celebrated coffee culture, but also offers a multi-sensory shopping experience to its customers.\n\nPontrué, who completed five years as the brand’s head, has overseen the expansion of the brand’s retail footprint in India and so feels understandably buoyant about Panerai’s future in the country. “We were, after all, one of the first luxury watch brands to enter this market a decade ago” he says, adding “Our expansion plans in the country align with our belief in India's evolving market landscape. As a matter of fact, India stands out for its promising growth trajectory in the luxury market.”\n\nIn an age where the retail experience is steadily migrating online, Panerai’s new boutique comes as a vote of confidence for the qualitative advantage offered by the boutique experience. “Today, we operate in an environment where consumers have a world of information and options literally at their fingertips, therefore it is essential to evolve with our clientele, recognizing their desire for a holistic 360-degree experience that transcends beyond just owning a product” says Pontroue, noting that the luxury industry, both in India and overseas has undergone a significant transformation over the years, forcing brands to adapt.\n\n\"Our goal is therefore crafting a journey able to embody the rich legacy of Panerai, married with innovation, offering experiences that are as unique and invaluable as the timepieces we create. For Pontroué, it’s ultimately about the power of storytelling. “We have worked on delving deep into our heritage, revisiting our emblematic design principles that have defined Panerai’s identity throughout.\"\n\nIt’s not all about scents, sounds, materials, and decor. With the new boutique launched, Panerai is bringing in the cavalry with a variety of new watches which include but aren’t limited to the new range of Radiomir watches which have come back in a big way, this year. “While the Luminor and the Submersible remain India’s key collections, our clientele has reacted very positively to the Radiomir collection this year.\"\n\n“This is a contemporary interpretation of Panerai’s first-ever watch and a faithful homage to our origins, able to pair an unmistakable design with a polished Goldtech™ case, a gold material developed for the first time by Panerai, including a combination of platinum and copper that gives the material an intense red appearance. The Luminor Due, launched at last year’s Shanghai edition of Watches and Wonders, is another timepiece that has garnered a lot of interest.\"\n\n“We revealed the Luminor Due Luna TuttoOro PAM01504, the Maison’s first moon phase model with a Panerai Goldtech™ bracelet, as well as the Luminor Due PAM01423, a 42mm case introducing for the first time the precious yellow gold in the Luminor Due line, intently appointed with a contemporary touch where it is paired with a green alligator strap featuring scale ridges in a darker shade to lend a dynamic nuance to the timepiece.\"\n\nVintage-inspired styles, replete with shop-worn patina and old-school ruggedness have also made their way to India, following the resounding success of the Panerai Luminor California collection. “Pieces such as the Radiomir Quaranta Goldtech™ PAM01026, able to embody vintage appeal, refined details and classic elegance, immediately appealed to watch lovers. After all, this is a contemporary interpretation of Panerai’s first-ever watch and a faithful homage to our origins”\n\nWhen asked about building on Panerai’s legacy in India, Pontroué’s response is decisive and clear. “As we steer into the future, we will keep on focusing on evolving across our four fundamental collections. A key component of this evolution is embracing technological innovation, not only in terms of the materials we use but also in the making of our calibres, showcasing our manufacturing capabilities.”\n\nAttesting to the evolution in both the tastes and the aspirations of India’s Paneristi, Pontrué knows that for the truly discerning, even an exotic retail experience doesn’t suffice. “We have taken horology to new experiential heights, with the launch of innovative timepieces that are not just instruments of time but also passports to unforgettable adventures. With the Radiomir Annual Calendar Platinumtech™ Experience PAM01432 we are thrilled to transport once again our clients into a specially curated adventure (March 2024), that would be otherwise inaccessible.”"
