        "text": "In 2007, the National Library of Laos and the University of Passau began a three-year project to digitise over 1,000 rolls of microfilm copies of manuscripts from throughout the country and to make its national literary heritage freely available via the Internet. The bilingual web application, the Digital Library of Lao Manuscripts (DLLM), can be viewed at www.laomanuscripts.net. When completed, users will be able to search and download approximately 12,000 texts, giving a total of almost 500,000 digital images containing 3-4 million manuscript pages. In addition to manuscripts from the Theravada Buddhist tradition, the collection contains a wide range of works about history, traditional law and customs, astrology, magic, mythology and rituals, traditional medicine and healing, grammar and lexicography, as well as poetry and epic stories, folk tales and romances, etc. While the vast majority is in Lao Tham script, a considerable number of holographs are in the ancient secular Lao Buhan, Lan Na, Tai Lue, Tai Nuea, and Khom scripts. The aim of the digital library is to complement ongoing manuscript preservation work in Laos by making this extensive collection of primary sources easily accessible and to facilitate the study of Lao literature and culture within Laos and overseas. This paper presents the Digital Library inventory in historical context, together with a preliminary analysis of manuscripts found in the collection, illustrated by selected examples which may be of particular interest to scholars.\n\nThis piece is my brief account of the field trip to Mae Hong Son in Northern Thailand. Organized by the Inya Institute, this research trip was centered on exploring the Buddhist manuscripts in the Monastery. I offer preliminary observations on the geographical distribution of ethnic groups within the province. I explore the connections between Buddhist texts, script writings, and the inherent materiality of these manuscripts to particular groups. I also touch upon the historical relocation of the Tai Yai individuals from Myanmar to Thailand in this border region.\n\nPalm-leaf manuscripts are important objects in Southeast Asia. Their value often goes beyond the meanings of the written texts. They also have historical, religious, literary, symbolic and ritual importance. This paper investigates textual materiality as it applies to a story about palm-leaf manuscripts owned by the ethnic Heuny (Nha Heun) group in Paksong District, Champasak Province, southern Laos. This story links material texts to oral history, rituals and efforts by the Nha Heun to legitimize their culture. It demonstrates how palm-leaf manuscripts can serve to legitimize claims handed down through oral traditions and ritual practice.\n\nNortheastern Thailand is still rich in palm-leaf manuscripts that have been preserved in monasteries or with lay people. Needless to say, historically speaking, this area has been closely related to Laos across the Mekong. Therefore, old palm-leaf manuscripts located in northeastern Thailand are most interesting not only in the light of local culture of today&#39;s Thailand, but more in the context of broader Lao cultural heritage across national boundaries. While northern Thai palm-leaf manuscripts have been systematically surveyed by the staff of Chiang Mai University since the 1970s and a considerable number of manuscripts have been microfilmed, and the Preservation of Lao Manuscripts Programme has strenuously worked on Lao manuscripts for more than a decade, those of northeastern Thailand have been largely neglected and only a preliminary survey was conducted in the 1980s (Sun Watthanatham Cangwat Mahasarakham, Witthayalai Khuru Mahasarakham, 1986). A systematic survey of the pa..."
