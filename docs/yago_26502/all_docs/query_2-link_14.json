        "text": "Phuwit and Piwat are brothers with the same father but different mothers. Though they look like twins, their personalities are very different.\n\nPhuwit has been raised up by Pao, his uncle in the farm, so his personality is kind of rough, hot-tempered and outspoken while Piwat has been raised up as a polite gentleman in Bangkok. Piwat's parents engage Jarulin to marry Piwat because they want her family to help their bankrupting business. However, Piwat can't marry with Jarulin because he gets in accident and becomes blind, so he and his family ask Phuwit to marry with Jarulin instead and Piwat goes to stay at Phuwit's farm instead. In that farm, Piwat meets Daorerk, the girl who comes to claim that Pao is her father."
