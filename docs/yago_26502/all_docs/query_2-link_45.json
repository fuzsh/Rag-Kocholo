A state trooper\n\nwill check whether the rules are being followed strictly before issuing the\n\nlicense (provided the examinee has the learner's license and the insurance for\n\nfishing rod).The rules are set for everybody who wants to fish in SCT,\n\nirrespective of their nativity.Any more corrections/ additions welcome.\n\n[Disclaimer: This article is written in a lighter vein.Wherever you want,\n\nfeel free to add smileys, generously.]\n\n[NB:Heard somewhere: For disclaimer, \"Disclaim her, I don't even know her\"]\n\n[1] Anybody can fish regardless of their gender. The only criterion is that\n\nmen should be over 21 and women should be over 18.\n\n[2] The chances of getting license are really high if the examinee knows tamil.\n\nIn fact, the trooper may test for tamil knowledge of the examinee by\n\ngiving commands in tamil. Because fish's mother tongue is tamil. And this\n\nshould not be considered as tamil imposition. In fact this rule is to\n\nprovide safety to fishermen/fisherwomen and also to fishes and to avoid any\n\nmis-communication in future.\n\n[3] Don't try to fish in troubled waters. Allow some time for the water to\n\nsettle.Stirring the troubled waters further, will be considered as\n\ninstigation and will cause the licensee to end up in real hot water.\n\n[4] If you see something 'fish'y, mind your business and do not try to pry.\n\n[5] vEshtis and sarees (They are equivalent to pedestrians in the case of\n\ndriving) will have always the 'Right-of-way' for fishing.\n\n[6] \"Parallel\" fishing is strictly illegal. Everybody should feel content\n\nwith one \"golden\" fish. Until they fish a golden fish, they can go\n\non fishing (if possible, without disturbing, others' fishes)\n\n[7] 'Fish'ically handicapped (Most of the vEshtis and sarees do fall in\n\nthis category) can enjoy certain privileges. They will have their\n\nown area of fishing. Non-handicapped persons should not fish in that\n\narea. The special sign \" 'Fish'ically handicapped \" should be displayed\n\nin the fishing equipment. Abuse of privileges will not be tolerated.\n\n[8] If a fish doesn't want to get trapped in your bait, leave that fish\n\nalone and try to fish somewhere else. There are lots of fishes around.\n\n[9] If you don't have the license, and if you have the instruction permit, then\n\nalso you can fish, provided, you're getting guidance from a license\n\nholder. Absolutely, no problem at all, if the license holder is one\n\nof your parents.\n\n[10] In case of your cancellation of your license, you can appeal to the\n\nfish-market judge, Dr.\"Thalaivar\" Selvakumar [He is the leader of all\n\n'leg-pullers'. Since he is a modest man, he won't accept this fact.\n\nNever mind.] and he will revoke the cancellation at his discretion.\n\n[11] Be patient in catching a fish. Remember this ThriukkauraL:\n\n[I forgot this. Can anybody (How about you,Satish@umn?) help me out here?\n\nIncorrect, incomplete version:...uRumeen.. varumaLavu.. kaththirukkumaam\n\n..kokku.
