        "text": "Monthly Archives: April 2020\n\nFrederik IV, King of Denmark and Norway\n\nby Susan Flantzer © Unofficial Royalty 2020\n\nFrederik IV, King of Denmark and Norway is known for making two bigamous marriages. He was the eldest of the four sons and the eldest of the seven children of Christian V, King of Denmark and Norway and Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel. He was born on October 11, 1671, at Copenhagen Castle in Copenhagen, Denmark. Frederik was the Crown Prince of Denmark from birth.\n\nFrederik had six younger siblings:\n\nChristian Vilhelm of Denmark and Norway (1672 – 1673), died in infancy\n\nChristian of Denmark and Norway (1675 – 1695), unmarried, died from smallpox at age 20\n\nSophia Hedwig of Denmark and Norway (1677 – 1735), unmarried\n\nChristiane Charlotte of Denmark and Norway (1679 – 1689)\n\nCarl of Denmark and Norway (1680 – 1729), unmarried\n\nVilhelm of Denmark and Norway (1687 – 1705), died at age 18\n\nFrom his father’s 30-year affair with Sophie Amalie Moth, Frederik had six half-siblings who were all raised at court:\n\nChristiane Gyldenløve (link in Danish) (1672 – 1689), married Count Frederik Ahlefeldt (link in Danish), no children\n\nChristian Gyldenløve (1674 – 1703), married (1) Countess Charlotte Amalie of Danneskiold-Samsøe, daughter of an illegitmate son of King Frederik III, had two daughters (2) Dorothea Krag, had two sons\n\nSophie Christiane Gyldenløve (1675 – 1684)\n\nAnna Christiane Gyldenløve (1676 – 1689)\n\nUlrik Christian Gyldenløve (1678 – 1719), Danish Navy Admiral and Governor of Iceland\n\nA daughter (1682 – 1684)\n\nWhen it came time for Frederik to marry, his father decided that he should follow the tradition of the family and marry a German princess. He visited many Protestant northern German courts and was instructed by his father to ask his aunt Anna Sophia of Denmark and Norway, Electress of Saxony for advice. Anna Sophia advised Frederik to marry Louise of Mecklenburg-Güstrow. Frederik was partial to Louise and readily agreed. Louise was the daughter of Duke Gustav Adolph of Mecklenburg-Güstrow and Magdalene Sibylle of Holstein-Gottorp. Like Frederik, Louise was a great-great-grandchild of King Frederik II of Denmark and Norway. On December 5, 1695, their wedding took place at Copenhagen Castle in Copenhagen, Denmark.\n\nFrederik and Louise had four sons and one daughter. Sadly, three sons died in infancy.\n\nChristian of Denmark and Norway (1697 – 1698), died in infancy\n\nChristian VI, King of Denmark and Norway (1699 – 1746), married Sophie Magdalene of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, had one son and one daughter including Frederik V of Denmark and Norway\n\nFrederik Carl of Denmark and Norway (1701 – 1702), died in infancy\n\nJørgen of Denmark and Norway (1703 – 1704), died in infancy\n\nCharlotte Amalie of Denmark and Norway (1706 – 1782), unmarried\n\nKing Christian V died on August 25, 1699, due to the after-effects of a hunting accident, ten months after he had suffered very severe injuries from being kicked by a deer. Frederik acceded to the Danish throne as King Frederik IV. Frederik and his wife were anointed King and Queen of Denmark and Norway on April 15, 1700, at the Frederiksborg Castle Chapel.\n\nDespite having inadequate training, Frederik was a fairly successful ruler. He selected his advisors carefully and held audiences in which ordinary people could speak to him and present letters with complaints or requests. However, Frederik was not very familiar with the Danish language, which he only used on state occasions. He usually spoke and wrote in German and French. For a good part of Frederik IV’s reign, Denmark, along with Russia and Saxony, was engaged in the Great Northern War (1700 – 1721) against Sweden. He did not achieve his main goal, to regain the former eastern Danish provinces lost to Sweden in the 17th century. Denmark also had to return Holstein-Gottorp to its duke.\n\nFrederik IV was interested in Italian architecture and traveled to Italy several times and so he had two palaces built in the Italian Baroque style. Frederiksberg Palace, located in Frederiksberg, close to Copenhagen, was built 1699 – 1735 and served as the Danish royal family’s summer residence until the mid-19th century. It was vacant for several years but since 1869, it has been the home of the Royal Danish Military Academy. Fredensborg Palace built 1720 – 1726, is located on Lake Esrum in Fredensborg on the island of Zealand in Denmark. Today, it is the Danish royal family’s spring and autumn residence and is often the site of state visits and family events in the Danish royal family.\n\nIn 1699, Frederik began a relationship with Elisabeth Helene von Vieregg, a lady-in-waiting to his unmarried sister Sophia Hedwig. In 1703, without divorcing his wife Louise, Frederik made a bigamous marriage to Elisabeth. After Elisabeth died in 1704 due to childbirth complications giving birth to a son Frederik Gyldenløve, Frederik IV gave her an elaborate funeral. Little Frederik Gyldenløve lived for only nine months.\n\nAfter the death of Elisabeth, Frederik began an affair with her lady-in-waiting, Charlotte Helene von Schindel. In 1709, Frederik wanted to again make a bigamous marriage but received strong opposition from the church which told him that the law against bigamy also applied to kings. Charlotte and Frederik had a daughter in 1710 who died in infancy.\n\nAfter losing interest in Charlotte Helene von Schindel in 1711, Frederik then fell in love with 19-year-old Anna Sophie, daughter of Grand-Chancellor Conrad Reventlow who held a position similar to Prime Minister. In 1712, Frederik abducted her from her parents’ home and took her to Skanderborg Castle where they were married bigamously as Frederik’s wife Queen Louise was still alive. The adultery and bigamy of Frederik IV and the effect it had upon Queen Louise deeply affected and disturbed Crown Prince Christian. Christian distanced himself from his father and he came to detest Anna Sophie.\n\nAfter the death of Queen Louise on March 15, 1721, Frederik and Anna Sophie were married in a second formal wedding conducted with great ceremony on April 4, 1721. Although the marriage was still scandalous, it was not declared morganatic and Anna Sophie was crowned as Queen at Frederiksberg Palace in May 1721.\n\nAnna Sophie Reventlow and King Frederick IV had six children. Three were born before the legal marriage in 1721 but none survived. This was seen by many as divine punishment for their bigamy. The three children born after the 1721 marriage were styled as Prince/Princess of Denmark but none of them survived infancy either.\n\nFrederika Sophie Reventlow (born and died before1721), died in infancy\n\nFrederica Conradine Reventlow (born and before 1721), died in infancy\n\nStillborn (before 1721)\n\nPrincess Christiana Amalia (1723 – 1724), died in infancy\n\nPrince Frederik Christian (1726 – 1727), died in infancy\n\nPrince Karl (1728 – 1729), died in infancy\n\nToward the end of his life, Frederik IV suffered from edema, then called dropsy.

He traveled to the United States for the 1989 Alpine World Ski Championships which were being held at Beaver Creek Resort, in Beaver Creek, Colorado. His death occurred while he was inspecting the Beaver Creek slopes during the competition with his friend, former Austrian skiing champion Toni Sailer. Alfonso and Sailer went down the slopes together but Sailer stopped when he saw that the cable from which the finish line banner was hanging was too low. Sailer went to warn the others on the slopes of the danger but Alfonso passed Sailer on the left, collided with the low-hanging cable, and suffered severe neck lacerations. Members of the Ski Patrol and emergency personnel attended to Alfonso at the scene, but he was pronounced dead on arrival at Vail Valley Medical Center in Vail, Colorado.\n\n********************\n\nPrince Friso of Orange-Nassau\n\nBorn: September 25, 1968 at the University Medical Center Utrecht in Utrecht, the Netherlands\n\nParents: Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and Prince Claus of the Netherlands (born Claus von Amsberg)\n\nMarried: Mabel Wisse Smit in 2004\n\nDied: August 12, 2013, aged 44, at Huis ten Bosch, in The Hague, the Netherlands\n\nBuried: Dutch Reformed Cemetery in Lage Vuursche, the Netherlands near Drakesteijn Castle where he had spent his childhood\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau\n\nPrince Friso of Orange-Nassau was the second son of former Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and Claus von Amsberg, and a younger brother of King Willem-Alexander.

During Christian V’s reign, colonies were established in the Caribbean. The islands of Saint Thomas, Saint John, Saint Croix, and Water Island were originally a Danish colony, the Danish West Indies. The city of Charlotte Amalie, on the island of St. Thomas, was named after Christian V’s wife. Denmark sold the islands to the United States in 1917 and now they are known as the United States Virgin Islands, and Charlotte Amalie is the capital.\n\nBorn on April 27, 1650, in Kassel, Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, now in the German state of Hesse, Charlotte Amalie was the eldest of the seven children and the eldest of the three daughters of Wilhelm VI, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel and Hedwig Sophia of Brandenburg.\n\nCharlotte Amalie had six younger siblings:\n\nWilhelm VII, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel (1651–1670), unmarried, died at age 19\n\nLuise of Hesse-Kassel (born and died 1652), died in infancy\n\nKarl I, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel (1654 – 1730), married Maria Amalia of Courland, had seventeen children including Friedrich who succeeded his father and was also King Frederik I of Sweden and Marie Louise who married Johan Willem Friso, Prince of Orange\n\nPhilipp, Landgrave of Hesse-Philippsthal (1655 – 1721), married Katharina Amalia of Solms-Laubach, had eight children\n\nGeorg of Hesse-Kassel (1658 – 1675), died at age 17\n\nElisabeth Henriëtte of Hesse-Kassel, Electoral Princess of Brandenburg, Hereditary Princess of Prussia (1661 – 1683), married the future Friedrich I, King in Prussia, had one daughter, died from smallpox at age 21\n\nUnlike many other German royals of the time who were Lutheran, Charlotte Amalie’s parents followed Reformed Christianity which adhered to the teachings of John Calvin. Charlotte Amalie was a strict adherent to Reformed Christianity her whole life. She was well-educated in French, Italian, geography, history, and philosophy and was interested in physics and pharmacy.\n\nOn June 25, 1667, at Nykøbing Castle in Falster, Denmark, 17-year-old Charlotte Amalie married 21-year-old Crown Prince Christian of Denmark, the son of Frederik III, King of Denmark and Norway and Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg. Charlotte Amalie is the only post-Reformation Danish queen who was not Lutheran or did not convert to the Lutheran religion. Because of her strict adherence to Reformed Christianity, the marriage contract stated that she was allowed to keep her religion and that she was allowed to hold services in an enclosed room with her own Reformed minister.\n\nThe couple had seven children:\n\nFrederik IV, King of Denmark and Norway (1671 – 1730); married (1) Louise of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, had four sons and one daughter including King Christian VI of Denmark and Norway (2) bigamously Elisabeth Helene von Vieregg, had one son (illegitimate, died in infancy) (3) Anna Sophie von Reventlow, married bigamously in 1712, had three illegitimate children; married legally in 1721, had legitimate three legitimate children, all six children died in infancy\n\nChristian Vilhelm of Denmark and Norway (1672 – 1673), died in infancy\n\nChristian of Denmark and Norway (1675 – 1695), unmarried, died from smallpox at age 20\n\nSophia Hedwig of Denmark and Norway (1677 – 1735), unmarried\n\nChristiane Charlotte of Denmark and Norway (1679 – 1689)\n\nCarl of Denmark and Norway (1680 – 1729), unmarried\n\nVilhelm of Denmark and Norway (1687 – 1705), died at age 18\n\nCharlotte Amalie’s husband succeeded his father in 1670 as Christian V, King of Denmark and Norway. Christian was anointed at Frederiksborg Palace Chapel on June 7, 1671, but Charlotte Amalie did not participate because it violated her religious beliefs.\n\nCharlotte Amalie’s relationship with her husband cannot be described as a love affair but rather a mutual, respected friendship. In 1672, King Christian V began a long-term affair with 16-year-old Sophie Amalie Moth. Sophie Amalie, the daughter of King Frederik III’s doctor Paul Moth, had grown up at court with her siblings so she and Christian were well acquainted. Christian had five children with Sophie Amalie whom he publically acknowledged. In 1677, Sophie Amalie was recognized as Christian’s official mistress and was created Countess of Samsø. Although Christian V’s public adultery caused an embarrassing situation for Charlotte Amalie, she always made the most of her position as queen, both in her public life as well as in her private interactions with her husband.\n\nDuring her tenure as Queen, Charlotte Amalie worked for the rights of those who practiced Reform Christianity, especially for displaced Huguenots from France who had settled in Denmark. In 1685, Christian V issued orders for a certain degree of religious freedom for religious refugees. In 1689, the first Reformed Church in Denmark was consecrated in Copenhagen and Charlotte Amalie was instrumental in its planning and funding. The church had a burial crypt, residences for the ministers, and later, two schools. Although Charlotte Amalie was deeply devoted to her faith, her view on religion was a Protestant ecumenical one and she corresponded with Protestants of different churches.\n\nKing Christian V died in 1699 and was succeeded by his son King Frederik IV. Charlotte Amalie allowed her daughter-in-law, Louise of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, to take her rightful place as Queen. Charlotte Amalie kept a separate court and during the winter lived at Charlottenborg Palace, which is named after her, and then during the summer, she lived at Nykøbing Castle. She owned several estates and became quite wealthy from their income. In 1703, when her son Frederik IV made a bigamous marriage by marrying his mistress Elisabeth Helene von Vieregg while his wife was still living, Charlotte Amalie was deeply grieved by his behavior but never expressed her great displeasure to her son.\n\nOn March 27, 1714, Charlotte Amalie, Queen of Denmark and Norway, aged 63, died of scarlet fever after being ill for six days at Charlottenborg Palace in Copenhagen, Denmark. She was buried in a baroque marble tomb designed by Christoph Sturmberg next to King Christian V’s tomb in the nave of Roskilde Cathedral, the traditional burial place of the Danish royal family, in Roskilde, Denmark.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

He was the eldest of the seven children and the eldest of the three sons of Frederik III, King of Denmark and Norway and Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg.\n\nChristian had seven siblings. His brother George (Jørgen) married Queen Anne of Great Britain and his sister Ulrika Eleonora married King Carl XI of Sweden.\n\nAnna Sophia of Denmark and Norway (1647 – 1717), married Johann Georg III, Elector of Saxony, had two sons\n\nFrederika Amalia of Denmark and Norway (1649 – 1704), married Christian Albrecht, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, had two daughters and two sons\n\nWilhelmina Ernestina of Denmark and Norway (1650 – 1706), married Karl II, Elector Palatine, no children\n\nFrederik of Denmark and Norway (1651 – 1652), died in infancy\n\nGeorge of Denmark and Norway, Duke of Cumberland (1653 – 1708), married Queen Anne of Great Britain, seventeen pregnancies, three lives births, none survived childhood\n\nUlrika Eleonora of Denmark and Norway (1656 – 1693), married King Karl XI of Sweden, had five sons and two daughters including King Carl XII of Sweden and Queen (Regnant) Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden\n\nDorothea of Denmark and Norway (1657 – 1658) died in infancy\n\nAs a teenager, Christian went on a Grand Tour of Europe, visiting Holland, England, France, and various German monarchies. In 1663, soon after his return, he became involved in government affairs as preparation for his future duties as king. In 1665, a hereditary, absolute monarchy was confirmed by law.\n\nOn June 25, 1667, at Nykøbing Castle in Falster, Denmark, Christian married Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel, the daughter of Wilhelm VI, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel and Hedwig Sophia of Brandenburg.\n\nChristian and Charlotte Amalie had seven children:\n\nFrederik IV, King of Denmark and Norway (1671 – 1730); married (1) Louise of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, had four sons and one daughter including King Christian VI of Denmark and Norway (2) bigamously Elisabeth Helene von Vieregg, had one son (illegitimate, died in infancy) (3) Anna Sophie von Reventlow, married bigamously in 1712, had three illegitimate children; married legally in 1721, had legitimate three legitimate children, all six children died in infancy\n\nChristian Vilhelm of Denmark and Norway (1672 – 1673), died in infancy\n\nChristian of Denmark and Norway (1675 – 1695), unmarried, died from smallpox at age 20\n\nSophia Hedwig of Denmark and Norway (1677 – 1735), unmarried\n\nChristiane Charlotte of Denmark and Norway (1679 – 1689)\n\nCarl of Denmark and Norway (1680 – 1729), unmarried\n\nVilhelm of Denmark and Norway (1687 – 1705), died at age 18\n\nUpon his father’s death in 1670, Christian succeeded him as Christian V, King of Denmark and Norway. Christian was anointed at Frederiksborg Castle Church on June 7, 1671. During the time of the elected monarchs, the clergy and nobility placed the crown on the king’s head at the coronation ceremony. After the introduction of the absolute monarchy, the crowning was replaced by anointing. The king arrived at the church wearing the crown and was consecrated by being anointed with oil. The regalia used at Christian V’s anointing, except for a new crown, had been made for the crowning of Christian V’s father.\n\nA magnificent throne chair had been constructed during his father’s reign, ready for Christian V’s use. The throne chair was used at anointings between 1671 and 1840. When the absolute monarchy was replaced by a constitutional monarchy in 1849, Danish monarchs were no longer anointed. The throne chair and regalia are now on display at Rosenborg Castle in Copenhagen. Christian V’s crown and the regalia are still displayed on the monarch’s coffin while lying in state.\n\nShortly after Christian became king, 16-year-old Sophie Amalie Moth became his mistress. Sophie Amalie, the daughter of King Frederik III’s doctor Paul Moth, had grown up at court with her siblings. In 1677, she was recognized as Christian’s official mistress and was created Countess of Samsø. Christian and Sophie Amalie had six children, all publicly acknowledged. Following the practice of his grandfather and father, Christian also gave his illegitimate children the surname Gyldenløve which means Golden Love.\n\nChristiane Gyldenløve (link in Danish) (1672 – 1689), married Count Frederik Ahlefeldt (link in Danish), no children\n\nChristian Gyldenløve (1674 – 1703), married (1) Countess Charlotte Amalie of Danneskiold-Samsøe, daughter of an illegitimate son of King Frederik III, had two daughters (2) Dorothea Krag, had two sons\n\nSophie Christiane Gyldenløve (1675 – 1684), died in childhood\n\nAnna Christiane Gyldenløve (1676 – 1689), died in childhood\n\nUlrik Christian Gyldenløve, Count of Samsø, (1678 – 1719), Danish Navy Admiral and Governor of Iceland\n\nA daughter (1682 – 1684), died in childhood\n\nChristian’s major disappointment was his unsuccessful attempt in the Scanian War to regain Skåne, Halland, and Blekinge, annexed by Sweden during his father’s reign. Christian introduced the 1683 Danish Code (Danske Lov), the first law code for all of Denmark. He also introduced a similar 1687 Norwegian Code (Norske Lov) to replace Christian IV’s 1604 Norwegian Code in Norway. During Christian’s reign, colonies were established in Africa and the Caribbean as part of the Danish triangle trade. The city of Charlotte Amalie, on the island of St. Thomas, is the capital and the largest city in the United States Virgin Islands and was named after Christian V’s wife.\n\nChristian V died from the after-effects of a hunting accident that occurred on October 19, 1698. Christian was hunting with his two surviving sons and his half-brother. While taking a break, they received the news that the hunting dogs had exhausted and surrounded a deer. Christian immediately left to give the deer the death blow. Instead, he missed and the deer kicked him. The injuries were severe and Christian never recovered, dying on August 25, 1699, aged 53, at Copenhagen Castle in Copenhagen, Denmark. He was buried in The Chancel at Roskilde Cathedral in Roskilde, Denmark.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Complications include kidney disease, rheumatic heart disease, and arthritis. More serious complications that may result in death include endocarditis, pneumonia, or meningitis. Today, the disease is treatable with antibiotics, which prevent most complications but before antibiotics, the death rate was high.\n\nOf course, without modern medical diagnostic tools, it was impossible to accurately diagnose illnesses and so this does not purport to be a complete list. Until the development of antibiotics and other drugs, it was impossible to successfully treat many infectious diseases. Sir Alexander Fleming, a Scottish biologist, physician, microbiologist, and pharmacologist, developed Penicillin, the world’s first antibiotic in 1928. Antibiotics are only effective against diseases caused by bacteria. They are not effective against diseases caused by viruses.\n\nAll images are from Wikipedia unless otherwise indicated.\n\n********************\n\nCharlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel, Queen of Denmark and Norway\n\nBorn: April 27, 1650, in Kassel, Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, now in the German state of Hesse\n\nParents: Wilhelm VI, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel and Hedwig Sophia of Brandenburg\n\nMarried: King Christian V of Denmark and Norway in 1667\n\nDied: March 27, 1714, aged 63, at Charlottenborg Palace in Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nBuried: Roskilde Cathedral in Roskilde, Denmark\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel, Queen of Denmark and Norway\n\nCharlotte Amalie died from scarlet fever after being ill for six days.\n\n********************\n\nCaroline Matilda of Wales, Queen of Denmark and Norway\n\nBorn: July 22, 1751 at Leicester House in London, England\n\nParents: Frederick, Prince of Wales, who died four months before Caroline Matilda’s birth, and Augusta of Saxe-Coburg-Altenburg\n\nMarried: King Christian VII of Denmark and Norway in 1766, marriage dissolved in 1772\n\nDied: May 10, 1775, aged 23, at Celle Castle in Celle, Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg, now in Lower Saxony, Germany\n\nBuried: Stadtkirche St. Marien in Celle, Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg, now in Lower Saxony, Germany, next to his great-grandmother Sophie Dorothea of Celle who suffered a similar fate\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Caroline Matilda of Wales, Queen of Denmark and Norway\n\nDue to the mental illness of her husband and first cousin King Christian VII, Caroline Matilda had an affair with her husband’s physician Johann Friedrich Struensee. Eventually, the affair was discovered. Struensee was condemned to death and suffered a brutal execution.\n\nCaroline Matilda and Christian’s marriage was dissolved, she lost her title of Queen, and was forcibly separated from her two children whom she never saw again. Originally, it was decided that Caroline Matilda was to be held in custody for life at Aalborghus Castle in Aalborg, Denmark, but her brother King George III intervened. King George III sent Sir Robert Murray Keith, a British diplomat, to negotiate her release from Danish imprisonment. On May 28, 1772, Caroline Matilda was sent to Celle in her brother’s Kingdom of Hanover and lived the rest of her life at Celle Castle. Her imprisonment was not to last long. Caroline Matilda died of “a putrid fever and sore throat,” probably scarlet fever, on May 10, 1775 at the age of 23.\n\n********************\n\nPrincess Maria of Romania\n\nBorn: September 8, 1870 in Bucharest, Romania\n\nParents: King Carol I of Romania and Elisabeth of Wied\n\nDied: April 9, 1874, aged 3, at Peleș Castle in Sinaia, Romania\n\nBuried: First in the palace gardens at Cotroceni Palace in Bucharest, Romania, transferred to Curtea de Argeș Cathedral in Curtea de Argeș, Romania in 1916\n\nWikipedia: Princess Maria of Romania\n\nIn the early spring of 1874, a scarlet fever epidemic was spreading through Bucharest, the capital of Romania. On April 5, 1874, Princess Maria, the only child of King Carol II and Queen Elisabeth of Romania, came down with the disease. She was sent to Peleș Castle and despite excellent care from doctors, Maria died four days later. Her parents were devastated by their daughter’s death and Queen Elisabeth never fully recovered from the loss of her only child. When Queen Elisabeth died in 1916, according to her wishes, her daughter’s remains were exhumed and Maria’s casket placed on Elisabeth’s casket for the public procession. Mother and daughter were then buried together in the same tomb at the Cathedral of Curtea de Argeș.\n\n********************\n\nRoyal Deaths from Pneumonia\n\ncompiled by Susan Flantzer\n\nPneumonia is an inflammation of the lungs caused by a bacteria or virus. Symptoms include a combination of productive and dry cough, chest pain, fever, and trouble breathing. Pneumonia was and still can be a secondary infection. It often shortens suffering among those already close to death and has thus been called “the old man’s friend.” With the introduction of antibiotics and vaccines in the 20th century, the survival rate has greatly improved. Nevertheless, in developing countries, among the very old, the very young, and the chronically ill, pneumonia remains a leading cause of death.\n\nThis does not purport to be a complete list.

Parliament eventually moved Elizabeth to Carisbrooke Castle on the Isle of Wight. On August 23, 1650, less than a week after her arrival at Carisbrooke Castle, Elizabeth became ill with a fever. By September 1, 1650, she was so ill that she never left her bed again. A week later, Elizabeth died from pneumonia.

Bubonic plague was mainly spread by fleas, infected with the bacteria Yersinia pestis, on small animals. Symptoms include chills, general ill feeling, high fever, muscle cramps, and seizures. The best-known symptom is a smooth, painful lymph gland swelling called a bubo, commonly found in the groin, but may occur in the armpits or neck, most often near the site of the initial infection – bite or scratch. Without treatment – and there was no treatment until the advent of antibiotics – plague resulted in the death of 30% to 90% of those infected.\n\nIn the Late Middle Ages, Europe experienced the most deadly disease outbreak in history when the Black Death, the infamous pandemic of bubonic plague, hit in 1347. From 1347 to 1665, the Black Death was responsible for about 25 million deaths in Europe.\n\nThis does not purport to be a complete list.

Symptoms include fever, headache, and neck stiffness, confusion or altered consciousness, vomiting, and an inability to tolerate light or loud noises. Young children often exhibit only nonspecific symptoms, such as irritability, drowsiness, or poor feeding. Meningitis can be life-threatening because of the inflammation’s proximity to the brain and spinal cord and today it is considered a medical emergency.\n\nOf course, without modern medical diagnostic tools, it was impossible to accurately diagnose illnesses and so this does not purport to be a complete list. Until the development of antibiotics and other drugs, it was impossible to successfully treat many infectious diseases. Sir Alexander Fleming, a Scottish biologist, physician, microbiologist, and pharmacologist, developed Penicillin, the world’s first antibiotic in 1928. Antibiotics are only effective against diseases caused by bacteria.

However, the day after Fritz left, Sigismund was unable to eat or sleep. Twenty-four hours later, he could no longer stand. Because all the doctors normally used by the family had left with the army, Vicky was forced to consult doctors unknown to her who gave her the terrible news that her son had meningitis. At that time, there was no successful treatment for meningitis, and death usually occurred. Sigismund’s convulsions grew increasingly worse until he died in agony on June 18, 1866, only 21 months old. Vicky wrote to her mother Queen Victoria, “Oh to see it suffer so cruelly, to see it die and hear its last piteous cry was an agony I cannot describe, it haunts me night and day!”\n\n********************\n\nGrand Duke Alexander Alexandrovich of Russia\n\nBorn: June 7, 1869 at Tsarskoye Selo in St. Petersburg, Russia\n\nParents: Alexander III, Emperor of All Russia and Dagmar of Denmark (Empress Maria Feodorovna)\n\nDied: May 2, 1870, aged 11 months, at Tsarskoye Selo in St. Petersburg, Russia\n\nBuried: Peter and Paul Cathedral in St. Petersburg, Russia\n\nWikipedia: Grand Duke Alexander Alexandrovich of Russia\n\nAlexander’s father had lost his elder sister and his elder brother, who had also been his wife’s first fiancée, to meningitis.

Unfortunately, the weather was just as bad, with almost no visibility. While attempting to land, the plane clipped a chimney on a factory near the airport. The plane was torn apart and crashed. All aboard the airplane died including Johanna’s parents, her brothers Ludwig and Alexander, and her paternal grandmother, the Dowager Grand Duchess of Hesse and by Rhine, born Princess Eleonore of Solms-Hohensolms-Lich.\n\nJohanna was adopted by her uncle Ludwig and his wife Margaret but she died of meningitis twenty months later.\n\n********************\n\nRoyal Deaths from Measles\n\ncompiled by Susan Flantzer\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious infectious disease caused by the measles virus. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, and inflamed eyes. A red, flat rash usually starts on the face and then spreads to the rest of the body about three to five days after the start of symptoms. Complications include diarrhea, middle ear infection, pneumonia, seizures, blindness, and inflammation of the brain. Deaths from measles are due to complications. Most of those who die from measles are less than five years old. Today, it is recommended that children be immunized against measles at 12 months of age.\n\nOf course, without modern medical diagnostic tools, it was impossible to accurately diagnose illnesses and so this does not purport to be a complete list.
