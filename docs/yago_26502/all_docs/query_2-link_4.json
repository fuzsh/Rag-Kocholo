        "text": "Fortunately, Charly's life is full of pleasant surprises (unfortunately sometimes also less pleasant ones). For several years now he has lived with his Thai wife Teoy in a resort not far from Udonthani. In his stories, Charly mainly tries to raise awareness of Udon, but he also discusses many other things in Thailand. He also gives a glimpse into his experience in Thailand.\n\nReplacing retirement by marriage – part 1\n\nAnyone who has followed my escapades here in recent weeks knows that I have now married my Teoy. Otherwise see my previous episodes “A week in Bangkok, parts 1 to 5”.\n\nAs far as we're concerned, there wasn't much need for the butter note. However, after almost six years together, we were more or less forced to do so by a decision by the Thai government that took effect on November 1, 2019. What does that decision entail? Foreign nationals residing in Thailand on an original basis of a Non Immigrant O – A retirement visa must present health insurance from that date in order to qualify for another year of residence status. And now let me be in possession of an annual residence permit on the basis of such a visa O – A retirement. So bingo.\n\nIf I understand correctly, the Thai government requires health insurance that provides annual cover of 400.000 baht inpatient and 40.000 baht outpatient. For convenience, the Thai government has designated a number of health insurers that meet their requirements, such as Pacific Cross and a number of other insurers. AA Insurance Brokers can tell you all about it and send you offers based on your personal situation. Biggest showstoppers: a mandatory medical exam, the exclusion of all previous medical problems, an age limit and a hefty annual premium.\n\nI myself have an inpatient insurance with AXA with a fairly high deductible, but no outpatient insurance. I have opted for a high deductible (more than EUR 6.000 per contract year) because it allows me to keep the annual premium at an acceptable level (EUR 2.300). Moreover, I believe that you should only insure what you could never afford.\n\nThis is a very arbitrary and ill-considered measure by the Thai government. Random because without any substantiation a certain group of pensioners is suddenly confronted with it. Why highlight the Non-Immigrant O – A retirement in particular? That is precisely the category of foreigners who are required to keep 800.000 baht in a Thai bank account. Why not make demands on all other foreigners residing here, for both the short and long term? So also for tourists.\n\nI understand that the Thai government wants to get rid of all uninsured foreigners walking around here. But in this way it is simply changing the rules during the match. As a government you would of course appear much more reliable if you declared this measure applicable to all new cases. So that everyone can take this new measure into account. So for foreigners who enter Thailand from November 1, 2019 on the basis of an O - A visa. This unreliability is not an exclusive phenomenon of the Thai government. It seems as if that unreliability is a globally accepted virus to correct the government's own failures.\n\nMisguided because the same government does not provide a solution to a number of problems that foreigners in Thailand face when they want to purchase such health insurance. Then, as the government, come up with health insurance that meets the set minimum cover for in- and outpatients, without age limits, with a reasonable premium and without exclusions. And simply make that health insurance compulsory for everyone who wants to stay in Thailand for a longer period of time. For tourists, it is sufficient to require that travel insurance, including medical expenses, must be taken out that covers at least the period that one will stay in Thailand. But if the Thai government does not appreciate foreigners who want to stay here in Thailand, then it is of course a well-considered and fantastic decision. And more decisions will follow within this framework in the coming years.\n\nThere were five options for me to get out of the new rule:\n\nPurchasing an elite visa, but I find that unreasonably expensive. Roughly 53 times more expensive compared to an annual extension of the period of stay. Plus, of course, the question of whether the elite visa will remain unchanged in the coming years or whether the whims of the government will also give rise to unforeseen criteria;\n\nReplacing the O – A visa with an O visa. I had to leave Thailand for that. That will now work, but entering Thailand again is really difficult at the moment;\n\nGet married, so that this requirement does not apply for the time being;\n\nTaking out health insurance that would meet the new requirement. I have selected this option through AA Insurance Brokers, but there are too many disadvantages for me. A higher annual premium than I now pay to AXA, a maximum annual cover of 5 million baht (now I have an annual cover of 45 million baht), a mandatory examination and exclusions for previous medical problems;\n\nLeave Thailand and return to the Netherlands or another country.\n\nOn Tuesday, September 8, immediately after the alternative Songkran days, went to Immigration Udon with the intention of converting retirement into marriage. However, things turn out a little differently than I had planned. The immigration officer on duty sees that my current period of stay ends on October 22. He does not think it is necessary to convert retirement into marriage right now, although I think you can do this throughout the year of residence. No, he sees more that one month before my period of residence ends and must therefore be extended, to be done in one go. We are handed a form that contains all the requirements for a residence period of one year on the basis of marriage and are more or less expelled from the office. The officer walks away, signaling that the conversation is over. The girl with whom I am sitting at the counter nods in agreement when I say that the change can still be made at any time. But yes, the officer is in charge and the girl is careful not to contradict the officer.\n\nSo now back to Immigration on September 22.\n\nWhat are the requirements of Immigration Udon?\n\nThe completed form TM 7 with a recent passport photo;\n\nCopies of the passport and of all pages with the current visa, re-entry visa, stay periods stamp, arrival stamps and the form TM 6;\n\nValid visa Non Immigrant O or B;\n\nIn case you are employed in Thailand, a minimum income of 40,000 baht per month. Plus a working permit plus Income Tax papers from the past year;\n\nOr, in case you enjoy a pension, demonstrate that this pension is at least 40.000 baht per month. The proof must consist of a letter of certification, issued by your embassy, ​​and legalized by the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nYou would also have to prove that you have a bank balance in a Thai bank account of 400.000 baht, for at least the last two months.\n\nI think it's about either 40.000 baht per month as income OR a bank balance of 400.000 baht. Not AND AND;\n\nA bank statement from your Thai bank that the bank balance is indeed 400.000 baht, for at least the last two months.\n\nThis bank statement must be issued on the same day as the day you go to Immigration. Plus a copy of all pages of your bank book;\n\nMarriage certificate;\n\nYour wife's ID card and house registration book;\n\nTwo passport photos of 4 by 6 cm;\n\nBirth certificates of your Thai (step) children;\n\nDirections to get to your house;\n\nPhotos of you with your wife in front of the house where you live, with the house number visible, photos of the living room and bedroom;\n\nOther documents that Immigration is pleased to request.\n\nIn Udon, this article apparently states that you must bring a witness.\n\nCorrection: Two witnesses are required. See my next posting.\n\nI use the week of September 14 to look around in Udon again. We spend three days in the Pannarai hotel. Striking: the Pannarai hotel is sold out in the days that we stay there. Reducing the overnight price from 1.500 baht to 999 baht will have contributed to this. Normally, the thought at Thai is that if things go down, the price\n\nmust be increased. For example, I hear from a friend, who is also coming to Udon this week, that the Basaja hotel in Pattaya has increased its price from 1.000 to 1.200 baht. Pannarai has solved this in a non-Thai way. Probably not Thai but a Chinese director. Just kidding. I hear from the hotel manager that they happen to have a large group of nurses in house for two nights for some convention.\n\nLatest news: the Pannarai hotel would be for sale for 400 million baht.\n\nIn the next posting my closing story about renewing my period of residence based on marriage instead of retirement.\n\nCharly www.thailandblog.nl/tag/charly/"
