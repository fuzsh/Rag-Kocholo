        "text": "Chakri Dynasty Country Kingdom of Thailand Titles King of Siam (1782-1949)\n\nKing of Thailand (1949-Present) Founder Rama I Current head Rama IX Founding 1782\n\nThe Chakri Dynasty (also known as the House of Chakri) (Thai: ราชวงศ์จักรี: Rajawongse Chakri) is the current ruling royal house of the Kingdom of Thailand, the Head of the house is the King of Thailand. The dynasty has ruled Thailand since the founding of the Ratthanakosin era and the city of Bangkok in 1782 following the end of King Taksin of Thonburi's reign, when the capital of Siam shifted to Bangkok. The Royal house was founded by King Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke an Ayutthayan military leader.\n\nPrior to the founding of the dynasty, King Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke (Rama I), held the title of Chao Pharaya Chakri for over ten years. This title was held by the greatest warlords of Ayuthaya and was meant to reflect the prowess of the holder on the battlefield. In the founding of the dynasty King Rama I himself chose both name and emblem for the dynasty. The Chakri which provides both name and emblem to the house of Chakri, is composed of the discus (Chakra) and the trident (Trisula, sometimes shortened to \"Tri\" in Thai language), the celestial weapon of the God Narayana (an Avatar of Vishnu) of whom the Siamese king is seen as a personification. The coined name Chakri thus denotes the transcending force of divine strength and stability upon the physical realm. The current Head of the Dynasty is King Bhumibol Adulyadej since 1946, the Heir Apparent to the headship is Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn. The House's dynastic seat is the Grand Palace in Bangkok.\n\nContents\n\n1 Royal Family of Thailand\n\n1.1 Members\n\n1.2 Other Members\n\n1.3 Recently deceased members\n\n2 List of Chakri Kings\n\n3 Vice-Kings\n\n3.1 List of Chakri Vice-Kings\n\n3.2 Deputy vice king\n\n4 Crown Princes\n\n4.1 List of Crown Princes\n\n5 Regents\n\n5.1 List of Regents\n\n6 See also\n\n7 External links\n\nRoyal Family of Thailand\n\nThe present Royal Family of Thailand is descended from HRH Prince Mahidol Adulyadej of Songkla (1898–1929) and Srinagarindra (later Princess Mother) (1900–1995) forming the House of Mahidol (ราชสกุลมหิดล) ( a cadet branch of the Dynasty). The Prince was a son of King Chulalongkorn the Great and his wife Queen Consort Savang Vadhana. The Prince was also the half-brother of both King Vajiravudh and King Prajadhipok. After the death of King Ananda Mahidol (Prince Mahidol's elder son), the present monarch, King Bhumibol Adulyadej (the Prince's younger son) ascended the throne in 1946.

Until 1885 every Chakri king had a vice-king or (Maha Uparaja (มหาอุปราช), also often translated as Second King) who lived in the Front Palace (วังหน้า) (a palace complex to the north of the Grand Palace, now the site of the National Museum). Usually the brother of the monarch, the vice-king was designated heir to the throne, however only Prince Isarasundhorn was able to ascend the throne as King Buddha Loetla Nabhalai. The office was extremely prestigious and carried with it almost equal status to the king, this can be seen in Prince Chutamani (younger brother of King Mongkut), who was elevated to King Pinklao in 1851 (he carried with him the styles and titles of a King). The system was abolished by King Chulalongkorn when his vice-king and cousin Prince Bovorn Vichaicharn died. He then declared his oldest son the Crown Prince of Siam, but not vice-king.\n\nList of Chakri Vice-Kings\n\nMonarch Vice King Reign Starts Reign ends First Reign Prince Maha Sura Singhanat\n\nสมเด็จพระบวรราชเจ้ามหาสุรสิงหนาท 1782 1802 First Reign Prince Isarasundhorn (Rama II) 1806 1809 Second Reign Prince Maha Senanurak\n\nสมเด็จพระบวรราชเจ้ามหาเสนานุรักษ์ 1809 1817 Third Reign Prince Maha Sakdi Polsep\n\nสมเด็จพระบวรราชเจ้ามหาศักดิ์พลเสพ 1824 1832 Fourth Reign King Pinklao\n\nพระบาทสมเด็จพระปิ่นเกล้าเจ้าอยู่หัว 1851 1866 Fifth Reign Prince Bovorn Vichaichan\n\nกรมพระราชวังบวรวิไชยชาญ 1868 1885\n\nDeputy vice king\n\nKrom Phrarajawang Boworn Sathan Phimuk (กรมพระราชวังบวรสถานพิมุข) or the Rear Palace, was another office inherited from the Kingdom of Ayutthaya.

The title was created in 1886 when King Chulalongkorn appointed his eldest son by Princess Consort Savang Vadhana, Prince Vajirunhis as Sayam Makutrajakuman. The title was copied directly from the Western tradition. Since then, there has only been three crown princes. The present crown prince is HRH Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn who was invested with the title in 1972. The succession is governed by the 1924 Palace Law of Succession passed by King Vajiravudh.\n\nList of Crown Princes\n\nMonarch Crown Prince Tenure Starts Tenure ends Fifth Reign Crown Prince Maha Vajirunhis\n\nสมเด็จพระบรมโอรสาธิราช เจ้าฟ้ามหาวชิรุณหิศ สยามมกุฎราชกุมาร 1886 1895 (died before he could succeed) Fifth Reign Crown Prince Maha Vajiravudh (later King Rama VI)\n\nสมเด็จพระบรมโอรสาธิราช เจ้าฟ้ามหาวชิราวุธ สยามมกุฎราชกุมาร (รัชกาลที่ 6) 1895 1910 Ninth Reign Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn\n\nสมเด็จพระบรมโอรสาธิราช เจ้าฟ้ามหาวชิราลงกรณ สยามมกุฎราชกุมาร 1972 Present\n\nRegents\n\nThe Regent of Thailand (ผู้สำเร็จราชการแทนพระองค์) as stated in the Constitution of Thailand is appointed either by the monarch himself or by the Privy Council of Thailand, the appointment must be countersigned by the President of the National Assembly of Thailand. The circumstances for appointment of a regent in the constitution is unclear it states that a regent can be appointed : \"Whenever the king is absent from the kingdom or unable to perform His functions for any reason whatsoever\" (Chapter 2, Section 18). So far a regent has only been appointed when the monarch has been in minority, when the monarch takes a foreign trip and when the monarch enters the Sangha as a monk.
