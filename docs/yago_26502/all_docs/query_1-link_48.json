        "text": "This study examines why courts made sense to those who established them and how the courts\\u27 authority is being utilized. For relatively powerless and resource-poor litigants, barriers to litigation may be many, but when these barriers are overcome, administrative courts exercise extraordinary influence, even when they fail to render a decision fully vindicating a plaintiffs legal rights. Administrative courts serve multiple functions, not only by exercising power, in the famed words of Chief Justice Marshall, to say what the law is, 13 but also by decentering the concentrated power of Thailand\\u27s insular and tradition bound ministries as well as its politicians. Binding decisions can exercise what Michael Dowdle calls concurrent jurisdiction to counter concentrated executive or political control over policy making through authority of their own that is directed to enforcing the rule of law. Courts\\u27 convening power requires officials to engage other stakeholders and to attend...\n\nThe judiciary is one of Thailand’s most trusted governmental bodies. It is envisioned as the protector of civil rights and liberties and the guardian of the rule of law. But its involvement in several high-profile constitutional controversies over the last two decades has also prompted questions over its independence and judicial integrity. It is against this background that this chapter reviews the role of the judiciary in Thailand’s contemporary political landscape. We start by describing the history, structure, and institutional evolution of the judiciary with particular attention to the post-1997 period which saw a radical redesign of judicial institutions. We then discuss the growing role of courts in the political landscape – a phenomenon known as the judicialisation of politics – and ask why some courts but not others have become key political actors in the last two decades. We suggest that different institutional powers, ideological capture, and leadership among these courts have led to diverging trajectories, often with far-reaching consequences for governance of the country. Our chapter concludes with what our findings mean for the future of judicial independence and integrity in Thailand.\n\nThailand has seen considerable progress in the rule of law since the seminal 1997 constitution. Yet persistent political instability suggests that as yet the country does not think of the rule of law as binding. What is likely to happen in Thailand with the rule of law, and with governance generally? The argument advanced here is that rule of law principles must contend with the realisation that the traditional Thai trinity – nation, religion and king – has become an inviolable state ideology. Political actors, often aligned with the monarchy, have been using each element of the trinity to undermine both rule of law principles and democratic institutions. Now that long-serving monarch King Bhumibol (Rama IX) has been succeeded by his son King Varijalongkorn, it seems an appropriate time to examine current battles about the meaning of the rule of law and broader struggles for control between elites and popular groups based on competing visions for the state – a problem not only in Thailand but in the region as a whole."
