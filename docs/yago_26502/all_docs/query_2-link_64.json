It is usually dated in the 5 to 4 c. BCE. 'Samavaya' means la group' 'an aggregate' or a 'cluster' of items, subjects or concepts usually associated with each other through certain common characteristics. The text is named as such because it follows the pattern of enlisting the subjects and themes related to Jain doctrine in a group form following numerical order in ascending manner. i.e. starting with 1 and going upto 100 in a regular way and then beyond in a faster pace, upto one crore. These subjects are then dealt with in a detailed and substantial manner unfolding their characteristics, a process during which important psychological and ontological aspects of Jain doctrine as well its cosmological beliefs come to fore. The text is thus an invaluable source of deriving information on various aspects of Jain philosophy and belief system. It is the first ever English translation of the text embellished with critical and supplementary notes which is being issued for the sake of reaching a wider Jain and NonJain readership, especially researchers and scholars.

L. Institute of Indology, Delhi has immense pleasure in publishing the English translation of Samvayangasutra in its Silver Jubilee Year 2009. Dr. Ashok Kumar Singh, Associate Professor, has very carefully prepared this English translation of the ancient Ardamagadhi text Samvayangasutra, as accurate as possible. For this volume, he wrote a learned preface and introduction and appexed four appendices to add the further value to the work. On the occasion of the publication of this volume we congratulate and express our best compliments to the translator and editor. Our sincere thanks are due to eminent scholars of Indology Prof. S. R. Banerjee & Prof. Piotr Balcerowicz, Poland. Both have been closely associted with this project. Prof. S. R. Banerjee at the initial stage and Prof. Piotr was generous in going through the draft of English translation and suggesting to include the text in the project. In fact the present final shape of this volume is the incorporation of his precious suggestions. For the text of this volume our sincere obligation is also due to Mahavira Jaina Vidyalaya, Mumbai and its erudite editor Rev. Muni Jambuvijayaji. It will be perfectly in place here to say some words about how the BLII was founded on the eve of its Silver Jubilee Year. The late Revered Jain Ach. Vijay Vailabh Surishwarji Maharaj is well-known throughout India for his humanism, his concern for the upliftment of the human race and his disciplined way of life. To commemorate the teachings of the great visionary Ach. a beautiful memorial (Smarak Complex) with a magnificent shrine has come up on the outskirts of Delhi. The Smarak is the brain-child of the late Mahattara Vidushi Sadhvisri Mrigavatiji, herself a great scholar of Jaina Canons and a true disciple of Ach. Vijay Vailabh Surishwarji Maharaj. The Bhogilal Leherchand Institute of Indology (BLII) was started through For Personal & Private Use Only Page #12 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ the munificent donations provided by the trusts of the Bhogilal Leherchand family and through Atma Vallabh Jaina Smarak Shikshan Nidhi to sponsor and promote research in Indology and other aspects of Indian culture, objectives dear to Revered Acharyasriji. Ach. Vijay Vallabhji Maharaj was advised by his guru in his last sermon: \"Temples to God have been built. Now you must build temples to Sarasvati.\" The academic programme of the Institute is to initiate, organise and give a fillip to research in Indological subjects in general and Jainology in particular. Our thanks are also due to Sri Rajkumarji, General Secretary of Sri Atma Vallabh Jaina Smarak Shikshan Nidhi, for the keen interest shown in this publication. We also thank to the staff of the BLII, for their assistance and cooperation in various ways, especially to Mr. Laxmi Kant, Computer Operator, BLII who has very sincerely accomplished the task of in corporating proof correction and type-setting. We wish that the work receives appreciation of scholars and proves incentive to the translator for bringing out similar works in future. Jitendra B. Shah Vice-Chairman, BLII For Personal & Private Use Only Page #13 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ Preface It is gratifying that Jaina canonical literature attracted the attention of scholars golbally. Since the publication of authentic translations of four canons, namely Acararga, Sutrakstanga, Uttaradhyayana and Kalpasutra, in the Sacred Books of the East Series and of few others outside, a number of commendable efforts have been made by Jaina Institutions, academic as well as religious, by scholars in India and abroad, to bring out the English translations of the Svetambara Ardhamagadhi canons. With the result that few of these like Acaranga, Uttaradhyayana, Kalpasutra and Dasavaikalika have more than one English translations. But texts such as Samavayanga, Prajnapana are still waiting for the favour of scholars in this regard. Prior to my arrival at BLII, this Institute has already undertaken the project of English translation of third Angasutra Sthananga, therefore, with the permission of the management I took the projet of translating this fourth Anga text, Samavayangasutra. Because in content and style it bears close similarity with the third Anga. Both texts are encyclopaedic nature and are suppliment to each other. Though categories here exceed ten and continue by progression up to hundred and then far exceed hundred. Immediately following, but without any logical connection with this, is a detailed table of contents and extent of all the twelve Argas; then all sorts of statements which cannot be united into one class and which deal partly with doctrine, partly with hagiology and, if we may use the expression, history or legend. Initially, at the pattern of SBE Series, it was intended to bring out only the English translation of this work and the text of Madhukar Muni edition published from Byavar was made as the base for the purpose. Subsequently, in the light of the suggestion of the Aademic Council of BLII, notes on translation was included in the original scheme. For including text with variant readings in the present project i.e. the text of critical edition of Mahavira Jaina Vidyalaya, Mumbai, Institue as well as the translator, is very much obliged to For Personal & Private Use Only Page #14 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ Prof. Piotr Balcerowicz, Poland. Ultimately, Introduction, three appendicesGatha Index, Classified Index of Proper Names, Glossary of Technical Terms, in addition to Bibliography and Word Index, present the composit whole of this project of the present edition. The introduction, in brief, commences with the meaning of Agama, Sruta and other terms used to connote this genre of sacred literature. The relation between Purva and Dvadasangi, date of composition of Ardhamagadhi canons, abridgement in Jaina canons and subject-matter of Samavayanga is dealt herein. The information on the editions of Samavayanga brought out till date also is given here. The text and variant readings of Mahavira Jaina Vidyalaya edition, published in the Jaina Agama Series, edited by Pujya Muni Jambuvijayaji, is reproduced in this volume, verbatum. Word index, also is based on that of this edition. For Classified Index of Proper Names the model given in the Ladnun Edition of Samavao has been adopted and changed according to the readings of Mahavira Jain Vidyalaya edition. For notes on the translation the editions of Byavar, Rajasthan and Ladnun editions have been utilized. The system of transliteration given in the Sanskrit-English Dictionary of Monier Williams has been adopted. Now, I may take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to various persons who in various ways have helped me during the course of this project. First of all I offer my deep sense of gratitude to my guru Respected Prof. Suresh Chandra Pandey, Former Head, Sanskrit Department of Allahabad University, who inspired me for the study of Jaina Iterature by suggesting me to take a Jaina text for research. I can not find suitable words to express my gratefulness to Prof. Jitendra B. Shah, Director, L. D. Institute of Indology and Vice Chairman of BLII, in whom since 1984 I have found a well wisher. In fact, I solely owe to him for my arrival at BLII. I will always be indebted to Prof. M. A. Dhaky, a profound scholar of international repute whose unparalled kowledge of Jaina religion, literature, art and architecture, makes him a natural role model for those in this area.

Institute of Indology, Delhi110036 Guru purnima, July 6, 2009 For Personal & Private Use Only Page #17 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ Introduction The scriptures or canons, English equivalent for agama or sruta, are officially recognized sets of sacred texts, pertaining to any religious, philosophical, scientific and other systems. Lexically, the term canon connotes: (a) authentic laws of religion, spirituality, thoughts and behaviours, (b) a list or collection of authoritative books or writings, containing the above laws'. Webster's Encyclopaedic Unabridged Dictionary, mentions its meanings as: (i) an ecclesiastical rule or law enacted by a council or other competent authority, (ii) the body of ecclesiastical law etc. According to Oxford English Dictionarys, this term denotes any set of sacred books. Thus, canons are the basic literature of a system -- religious, philosophical, scientific and others, regulating their working, following and progress. Etymologically, the term sruta stands, in general, for reading, teaching and preservation of learning by successive and traditional teacher-taught hearings and memorised communications, in olden days. Its derivative meaning referred only the heard words and their meanings but comprehended other methods also, leading to knowledge and ultimately, all the instrumental causes leading to produce sruta4. However, in Jaina tradition, it stands for the knowledge, dealing with the spiritual and moral upliftment of living beings. The term agama, a specific and later form of sruta, denoting form of general knowledge, implies valid and consistent one, imparted by the direct knower. :. Besides, sruta and agama, a number of other words are mentioned in Jaina texts. Anuyogadvarasutras and Tattvarthadhigamasutrao, mention ten and eight, respectively: With three in common, thus, total fifteen. The term sastra, also frequently used, makes the total sixteen, connoting all-purpose utilitarian meaning implying: (i) those containing rules governing the society and individuals and (ii) those preserving the culture of the community. The synonyms for sruta and agama may be put as follows: For Personal & Private Use Only Page #18 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. viii sruta: heard from the attained or his disciples. upadesa: instructions to learn about good or bad. agama: traditional doctrines or sacred canons containing them. sutra: abbreviated indicators, aphorisms or sacred collections. grantha: treatises of sermons, collections, connecting or stringing together of sermons. siddhanta: tenets or established truths. 6. 7. sasana: authentic controlling instructions on disciplines. 8. ajna: commandments. 9. vacana: sermons in the form of spoken words. 10. prajnapana: communication of sermons. jinavacana: precepts of the Jinas. 11. 12. pravacana: special sermons. 13. aptavacana: instructions of the attained. 14. aitihya: traditional preachings. 15. amnaya: sacred traditions. 16 sastra: teaching, awakening and discipline about constraints and preservation of culture\". The great Jaina scholars Revered Muni Punyavijaya and Pt. Dalsukh Malvania also deliberated, in detail, on the meaning and synonyms of the word 'agama' as occurred in canonical literature. To quote their words, \"From the use of the word 'agama' in the scriptures at various places we gather that the intention there is to convey the meaning jnana (knowledge) by the term 'agama'. 'Agametta anavejja\" is translated into Sanskrit as jnatva ajnapayet' i.e. 'may order after having known'. Ach. Bhadrabahu says that 'pravacana', 'sutra' and 'artha' are synonyms9. But how 'sutra' and 'artha' can be synonymous with 'pravacana' because 'pravacana' constitutes the genus while sutra and artha constitute its For Personal & Private Use Only Page #19 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ species and also because sutra and artha are not mutually identical. Jinabhadralo solves the difficulty by suggesting that even sutra and artha could be considered to be synonymous with pravacana' if we view genus and its species mutually identical. Thus, Jaina literature contains a number of terms prevalent for the sacred literature of Jainas. Relation Between Purva & Destivada: The Samavayangsutra deals elaborately with the sections and sub-sections of twelfth Anga canon Drstivada. Purva, here is enumerated as its third of five sections, others being Parikarma, Sutra, Anuyoga and Calika in respective order. The content of this twelfth Anga is also described in Sthanangasutra (c.3rd cent. B.C.), Nandisutra of Devavacaka (c. mid 5th cent. ), Tattvarthavartika of Akalanka, Dhavala of Virasena, Jaidhavala of Jayasena and Angaprajnapti'l. Against the background that Drstivada is taken to be extinct and Purva represented the literature prior to Mahavira era, this description becomes significant. The relation between purva literature and Angas in general and twelfth Anga Drstivada, in particular has been haunting the scholars since long and last word on it has yet to come. Some considered Purva literature as explicitly denoting the literature prior to Mahavira while to some it formed the part of 12h Anga Destivada. To them, the fourteen Purvas formed the part of twelfth Anga Drstivada and belonged to Sudharma. In consequence of this the six patriarchs viz. Prabhava, Sayyambhava, Yasobhadra, Sambhutivijaya, Bhadrabahu and Sthulabhadra had the epithet of srutekvalin or caturdasapurvi (knower of fourteen Purvas). The following seven patriarchs: Mahagiri, Suhasti to Vajra knew only ten Purvas. As tradition maintains that with Sthulabhadra, the knowledge of the last four Purvas (11-14) ceased to exist, hence Mahagiri etc. are called dasapurvi. In Anuyogadvara there is also mention of the navapurvi, a grade lower than dasapurvi alongwith dasapurvi and caturdasapurvi. From that point the knowledge of the Purva decreased gradually and ultimately, in the time of Devarddhigani, 980 years after Vira (463 AD); only one Purva remained. On the basis of mention in the Samavayanga etc. the content of the whole Drstivada including the fourteen purvas, Drstivada appears to be still For Personal & Private Use Only Page #20 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ X extant at the time of these texts and moreover, to be still intact, since there is no mention of any imperfection. Abridegment in Canons 13 The tradition to abridge the text was in vogue due to learning of sruta by heart and facilitate the scribing. Pt. Bechardas Doshi13 observed, \"The traditional Jaina monks considered the tendency to write and get written as sinful activities. They, nevertheless, adopted this path as an exception to safeguard the scriptures. The less writing, the better. They adopted a method to reduce the sinful activity to the least for the safeguard of the scriptures. With the help of two novel words 'vannao' and 'java' they could abridge thousands of gathas, hundreds of sentences and their beginning was shortened as well as no deficiency occurred in understanding the meaning of the scripture.\" Three reasons- the system to learn the sruta by heart, convenience by the scribe and intention to write briefly- are probable causes leading to the abridgement of the text. It undoubtedly caused no deficiency in the meaning, but it marred the charm of the text. The monks, having learnt the whole canonical literature by heart, can make out the antecedents and precedent referred to by the words 'vannao' and 'java' but the class of monks learning with the help of the manuscripts cannot do. The text, having the references of 'vannao' and 'java' has not proved much beneficial to them. According to Pt. Bechardas Doshi, the text abridgement was done by Devarddhigani Ksamasramana. He writes \"Devarddhigani Ksamasramana while putting the agamas into writing, kept some important points in mind. Wherever he found similar reading, he avoided the later one by using the words, e.g. jaha uvavaie, jaha pannavanae etc. to denote the omitted text. When some statement occurred repeatedly in a text, he used the word 'java' and wrote the last word of it refraining from the repetition. Modern scholars held the view that the process of abridgement might have been started by Devarddhigani, but it developed in the later period. In the specimens, available at present, the abridged text is not uniform. A sutra For Personal & Private Use Only Page #21 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ th has been abridged in one specimen but written in its full version in the other. The commentators also mentioned it in many places. Date of Composition of Ardhamagadhi Literature Ardhamagadhi canons are, undoubtedly, the earliest of the Prakrit extant literature. First part of Acaranga is prior to the earliest of the Prakrit canons and dates back approximately to c. 5\"-4\" cent. BC. Acaranga, composed in Upanisadic style is voice of Lord Mahavira, itself. Description in it is bereft of any element of exaggeration and supernatural element. Thus, certainly the lower limit of composition ofagamas is c. 5\"-4\" cent. BC. However, the whole of Ardhamagadhi literature was neither composed in a spur of moment nor by a single man. The present form of Ardhamagadhi canons was assumed during the last redaction held at Valabhi (V.N.S.980). To conclude on this basis that Ardhamagadhi canons were composed after c. 55\" cent. A.D. will be quite misleading. The visible vividity in subject matter, language and style of extant canons, is clear evidence that editing has not interfered with the individuality and originality of the texts. Ardhamagadhi canons are replete with interpolations creaped into later . on, but are distinguishable and may be easily identified. On account of interpolations it will not be proper to consider respective works as posterior. :: Another factor, working against the antiquity of Ardhamagadhi canons, is the visible effect of Maharastri on their languages but the scribes and commentators were responsible to a greater extent for this. Therefore, the effect of Maharastri on Ardhamagadhi must not be taken as the ground of posteriority of the Ardhamagadhi canons. * Ardhamagadhi canons contain cultural milieu of different periods. In fact, to determine the date of a particular text or that of a specific portion of a particular text, the cultural data, philosophical content, language and style, etc. all the aspects must be carefully considered. Clues regarding the subject-matter of Ardhamagadhi canons can be had from the Sthananga, Samavayanga, Nandisutra. Nandicurni and Tattvarthabhasya among For Personal & Private Use Only Page #22 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ xii Svetambara texts, while from the commentaries of Tattvarthasutra, Dhavala and Jayadhavala among Digambara commentaries. Samavayangasutra Nomenclature & Content: The fourth Anga of the 'Dvadasangi, 'samavaya', 'association, group, consists of very heterogeneous theme. The substances, soul-non-soul etc, have been put into divisions or brought down properly in this canon, therefore, the title 'samavao'. This text treats of the similarity of the soul etc. (jivadi) substances hence, called the 'samavao'. According toNandisutra1s it deals with the description of soul-nonsoul (jiva-ajiva), universe-non-universe (loka-aloka) and (jina doctrine (svasamaya) as well as heretic doctrine(parasamaya), the evolution of number beginning from one to hundred and the account of the Dvadasangi. It is remarkable that both the texts Samavanga and Nandi mention the increase one by one (ekottarika vrddhi) up to hundred, but surprisingly omit the multiincreasing (anekottarika vrddhi). But Abhayadevasuri1 mentioned the ekottaravrddhi alongwith anekottaravrddhi. Evidently, he discussed on the basis of available text of Samavayanga. The title suggesting the treatment of topics arranged in samavayas in numerical order, herein, represents only its portion, though a major one. The whole text may, broadly, be divided into two groups: (A) topics arranged in samavayas according to numerals and (B) those treated outside samavayas. The former may be, further, sub-divided into (i) the theme associated with numerals one to hundred and placed in samavayas, increasing in successive order and (ii) that associated with multi- increasing numerals and not arranged in samavayas. The sutras outside samavayas may further be classified into three groups: (i) on the the subject-matter of the twelve Anga texts Acaranga, etc. (ii) on various Jaina tenets and (iii) related with the sixty-three great men of Jaina tradition, e.g governors (kulakaras), Seers (Tirthankaras), universal monarchs (cakravartins), Baladevas, Vasudevas, Prativasudevas etc. The topics treated in samavayas from one up to hundred, placed in a particular samavaya, mostly represent the actual respective number but at times For Personal & Private Use Only Page #23 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ the topics associated with thousand, lac, palyopama, sagaropama, etc. corresponding to that samavaya are also found. For example, samavaya one contains topics associated with numeral one thousand, one lac, one palyopama(pit simile) and one sagaropama also besides one soul, one sin etc. The topics associated with multi- increasing numerals begin with one hundred fifty and proceed up to one sagaropama (ocean-simile) kotakoti (one crore multiplied by one crore). The numerals in this section increase by fifty up to five hundred i.e. 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450 and 5,00. It increases by hundred up to eleven hundred i.e. 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000 and 1100. The numerals from one thousand to ten thousand increase by one thousand i.e. 1000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, 7,000, 8,000, 9,000 and 10,000. While those with one lac onward up to ten lac increase by one lac. Only two topics related with the numeral one crore and one kotakoti sagaropama are placed herein. Albrecht Weber\" commented on the theme of the third part of this text.According to him, \"This third part is without doubt to be regarded as an appendix to the first part, and the whole as a supplement to the third Anga. It is a compendium of everything worth knowing a perfect treasure-house of the most important information which is of the greatest value for our understanding of the siddhanta. Of special significance are, in the first place, the statements of literary and historical content in 1-100, in reference to the extent and division of the separate angas, etc. (statements which were doubtless the principal cause of the addition of the full treatment of this subject); the mention of various celebrated arhats of the past together with the number of their teachers (this was the cause of the addition of the concluding part); and the frequent reference to the lunar and naksatra computation of time and to the quinquennial yugam. The references to the yugam are exactly in the manner of the jyotisa, vedanga, etc, being the beginning of the series of the naksatras. Schubring also made his observation on the content of this text, specially on its third part. According to him, The last third part of Samavayanga is an appendix and in general describes the Dvadasangi Ganipitaka. In the For Personal & Private Use Only Page #24 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ xiy second appendix the qualities of all beings are described in question-answer form. A third appendix in common Gathas, shows the dates of the spiritual and temporal heroes.. Before proceeding to present the content of Samavayanga, in the light of above scheme of exposition, a few words about its content will be in order. Its present content, in general, according to Padmbhusana Pt. Dalsukh Malvania\" may be grouped as: (i) Path of liberation, (ii) Reality, (iii) Cosmology, (iv) Great persons, (v) Jina Order (vi) Literature and (vii) miscellaneous, along with further subclassifications.

FR HTET MOTTO authE tapet '31' sta sta:\"-3710 11 38. uffroafareifa toll Notes A In the aphorism 'Eke ata' soul has been categorized as one from generic view-point (Sangraha naya).The characteristic of soul is consciousness (cetana). From the view-point of consciousness all the souls in this universe are similar. Hence, it has been expounded that the soul is one. All the other seventeen non-soul (ajiva) etc. may also be expounded as one with respect to generic view-point. A western scholar Kornelius Krumpelmann, however differs with above opinion. According to him \"eka atma\" does not mean \"soul is one\", because he doesn't take \"eka\" as a predicative adjective. In accordance with the name of the chapter, i.e. eka-sthanam, and the general character of our text, as well as with those numerous expressions in the Sthananga, in which we find the cardinal numbers employed attributively, we should interpret \"eka\" as conveying the For Personal & Private Use Only Page #59 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ Samavaya one sense of \"ekasmin sthane\" -- in place \"one\". If we leave out the adjective \"eka\", the term \"atman\" alone serves its purpose. He opines that the cardinal number was added only to ensure the formal uniformity of the text. Presumably, it was also intended as an aid to learn the text by heart. If one thinks it inevitable to translate \"eka\" in the sutras \"eka atama\". I see no better solution than to render them as \"one: soul\", and so on'. B. Abhayadevasuri2, the commentator mentioned that the exhaling or inhaling, of the specific class of deities is related to their life-span. he same is the case with the feeling of their hunger. C. Though siddha, buddha, mukta and parinirvsta are synonymous yet have different connotations: Siddha- having attained supernatural powers, buddha-having attained omniscience, mukta, having ot rid of karma-particles, parinivsta- state of eterna peace being entirely free from defilements caused by karmas. D. The term 'bhavasiddhika'4 stands for the souls, worthy of liberation. The liberation, being possible only in the state (gati)of human being therefore, soul implies only human being, herein. 1.
