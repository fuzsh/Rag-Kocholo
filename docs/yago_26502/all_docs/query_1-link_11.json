        "text": "Tuptim is Prince Chulalongkorn's love interest and a supporting character of the 1999 animated film, The King and I. She is voiced by Armi Arabe, with Tracy Venner Warren as her singing voice.\n\nBackground[]\n\nPersonality[]\n\nTuptim is lovely, kind, beautiful and cute. As she is only a servant, she is scared of being sent back to Burma and being whipped until her death for the disgrace of trying to enter a relationship with a member of the royal family. But, she is intelligent, ready to fight for what she believes in, and always willing to stand behind those she loves.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nShe is slender with tan skin, black hair in a ponytail, golden earrings on her two ears, red lipstick and green eyes. She wears a pink shirt with a green sash, gold earrings, black hair in a ponytail, red pants and sandals.\n\nRole in the film[]\n\nTuptim is a beautiful teenage girl and a servant given to King Mongkut as a gift from her father, the Burmese Emissary. She yearns for knowledge and stuns Mongkut's court when she boldly tells them she can read, which books are commonly prohibited and forbidden to servants. She is befriended by Tusker, a baby elephant who loves and protects her from the villainous Kralahome and the bumbling henchman, Master Little.\n\nAnna immediately recognizes that Tuptim has a fire and spirit that cannot be broken and also, she discovers that she has fallen in love with Prince Chulalongkorn and that he has fallen in love with her, as well.\n\nIf King Mongkut finds out, she would be sent back to Burma in disgrace and most likely to be killed and whipped until her death. However, she survived and seen of the kings death bed. In the end, The King of Siam gives her freedom and gives his blessing to marry his son. Tuptim is not seen in the film after this meaning she is still somewhere in the castle. The king mentions Tuptim in the credits scene, where he reads a letter from Chulalongkorn. He says that Tuptim is happy and sends her regards to him and Anna, the king’s teacher. He also says that Tuptim has taught him a lot about love and forgiveness. And alive and well.\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nRenée Zellweger, Jennifer Aniston, Nicole Kidman, Lorraine Bracco, Sally Field, Brandy Norwood, Jenna Elfman, Jasmine Guy, Madonna, Jada Pinkett Smith, Erika Christensen, Sarah Jessica Parker, Gwen Stefani, Ellen DeGeneres, Janeane Garofalo, Mandy Moore, Sandra Bullock, Gwyneth Paltrow, Lisa Kudrow, Minnie Driver, Joely Richardson, Drew Barrymore, Anna Paquin, Melanie Griffith, Geena Davis, Amy Adams, Jane Seymour, Meg Ryan, Halle Berry, Zooey Deschanel, Alicia Silverstone, Cameron Diaz, Jane Krakowski, Julianne Margulies, Mary Gross, Natasha Henstridge, Sharon Stone, Leslie Mann, Kay Lenz, Britt Ekland, Michelle Pfeiffer, Saffron Burrows, Anjelica Huston, Constance Marie, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Roseanne Barr, Kate Winslet and Hilary Duff we all considered for the role of Tuptim before Armi Arabe was cast."
