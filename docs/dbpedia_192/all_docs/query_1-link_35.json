More in particular, the present invention relates to methods for increasing the resistance of a plant or part thereof that is susceptible to infection with a pathogen comprising an ortholog of the Avr4 protein of\n\nCladosporium fulÏ um, wherein said plant is not a tomato plant. The invention also relates to methods for screening the resistance of a plant or a part thereof to at least one pathogen, wherein said plant is not a tomato plant. The invention further relates to the use of such methods.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The world's most important agricultural plants are still highly susceptible to pathogen-induced diseases that can severely affect their growth and reproductive rate. In some cases, even the very existence of such plants may be threatened. For example, the leading banana cultivar \"Gros Michel\" was discovered in the 1820s and was grown and consumed throughout the world until the 1920s. It was almost completely eradicated in only a few decades by the Panama Disease, caused by the soilborne hyphomycete fungus, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense. It has been hypothesized that its successor, the cultivar \"Cavendish\", may become unviable for large-scale cultivation in the next 10â20 years due to a similar disease. Evenly grim prospects have also been foresighted for other agricultural plants such as potato, corn, soybean and wheat. Thus, as the production values of agricultural plants are very important for keeping up with the world's ever increasing food demand, there is a dire need to improve their resistance to pathogens. Of these plants, banana and sugar beet plants share their susceptibility to fungal pathogens, belonging to the class of Dothideomycetes.\n\nThe production value of banana plants (Musa ssp., including plantains and other types of cooking bananas) is only succeeded by that of maize, rice and wheat. Annually, nearly 100 million tons of bananas are produced in about 120 countries worldwide. As mentioned above, bananas are very prone to fungal infections. Of these infections, Panama Disease and, more recently, the Sigatoka Disease Complex belong to the most devastating ones. The Sigatoka Disease Complex involves three phylogenetically closely related species of the Dothideomycete family of Mycosphaerellaceae, including M. musicola, M. fijiensis and the recently characterized M. eumusae (reviewed in Jones 2000, 2003, Arzanlou et al. 2007). The disease is a serious threat to banana plantations around the world, causing extensive economic losses. The three species emerged on bananas during the last century with M. musicola (causing yellow\n\nSigatoka) appearing first in South East Asia in 1902 and gradually being replaced by M. fijiensis (causing black Sigatoka or black leaf streak) that appeared in the Sigatoka valley of the Fiji islands during the 1960s. The third species, M. eumusae, causes Eumusae leaf spot and was identified as a new constituent of the Sigatoka complex on bananas during the 1990s. Currently, the black Sigatoka is the most destructive disease of banana worldwide, reducing yields by more than 38% (Marin et al. 1991).\n\nSugar beet {Beta vulgaris L) is a member of the Chenopodiaceae family, and accounts for 30% of the world's sugar production. Like wheat and bananas, it is also prone to infection by fungi that belong to the class of Dothideomycetes. The species Cercospora beticola is particularly well known for its capability to infect sugar beets. Sugar beets that have been infected by C. beticola can easily be recognized by distinctive round leaf spots that are often surrounded by a red ring. Another type of plant that is commercially grown on a very large scale and that is prone to viral and fungal infection is the tobacco plant (genus Nicotiana). World tobacco production is projected to reach over 7.1 million tonnes of tobacco leaf in the year 2010, up from 5.9 million tonnes in 1997/99. About 100 countries produce tobacco. The major producers are China, India, Brazil, the US, Turkey, Zimbabwe and Malawi, which together provide over 80 percent of the world's tobacco production. Of these producers, China alone accounts for over 35 percent of world production. Tobacco plants are also susceptible to fungal infestation by Dothideomycetes. For example, infection of tobacco leaves with Cercospora nicotianae is a main cause of wide- spread tobacco plant diseases such as barn rot and frogeye leaf spot.\n\nCurrently, methods for controlling these diseases in commercial plantations are mostly restricted to extensive and repeated application of fungicides. In the past, the annual worldwide costs for these applications were already estimated at $ 2.5 billion for bananas alone, at that time accounting for 27% of the banana production costs (Stover 1980, Stover and Simmonds 1987). It may be clear that such extensive application is not only expensive, but in addition it poses serious threats to human and animal health and to the environment. Furthermore, it has been\n\ndemonstrated that the intensive application of fungicides has already resulted in the development of resistant fungal strains (Marin et al. 2003).\n\nThus, alternative methods for increasing the resistance of plants to their pathogens are needed. Preferably, such methods avoid the\n\napplication of chemical compounds such as fungicides.\n\nSuch methods are known in the art, as for example methods to genetically transform banana (Crouch et al. 1998, Report 1997, Sagi 1997). These methods have however not proven successful yet. Thus, the need for improving the resistance of agricultural plants to their pathogens remains.\n\nDothideomycetes are a class of Ascomycete fungi that comprises about 50 families, 650 genera and 6300 known species. Traditionally most of its members were included in the clade Loculoascomycetes. The class contains several important plant pathogens, such as Stagonospora nodorum (causing Stagonospora leaf blotch of cereals), Venturia inaequalis (causing leaf scabs of many plants including apple and pear) and\n\nAscochyta species (causing leaf spot of legumes including pea, chickpea, bean and many others).\n\nCladosporium fulÏ um is a biotrophic Dothidiomycete that causes leaf mould of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum). C. fulÏ um secretes effector proteins into the apoplast of the infected plants to facilitate disease development (Thomma et al. 2005). These effector proteins can be recognized by cognate C. fulÏ um (Cf) resistance proteins present in resistant tomato lines. Recognition by Cf proteins results in a rapid elicitation of plant defense responses, culminating in the hypersensitive response (HR), a type of programmed cell death. Cells surrounding the initial infection site quickly die and in this way, further growth of the biotrophic fungus is prevented (De Wit et al. 2008; Joosten & De Wit 1999; Thomma et al. 2005).\n\nTo date, four avirulence (AÏ r) genes have been cloned from C.\n\nfulÏ um and they all encode small cysteine-rich proteins that are secreted during infection. These are the Avr2, Avr4, Avr4E, and Avr9 effector proteins, whose recognition in tomato is mediated by the cognate Cf resistance proteins Cf2, Cf4, Cf4E, and Cf9, respectively (De Wit et al. 2008; Joosten & De Wit 1999; Thomma et al. 2005). Four additional extracellular proteins (Ecps), namely Ecpl, Ecp2, Ecp4, and Ecp5 have been characterized from C. fulÏ um that invoke an HR in tomato lines that carry a cognate matching Cf-Ecp gene (De Kock et al. 2005; Lauge et al. 2000). Recently, also the Ecp6 and Ecp7 effectors have been identified but so far no tomato lines have been reported that carry matching cognate Cf- Ecp genes mediating their recognition (Bolton et al. 2008).\n\nAlthough demonstrated for only a few, all Avrs and Ecps are assumed to be virulence factors (Bolton et al. 2008; Thomma et al. 2005; van Esse et al. 2007; van Esse et al. 2008) The Avr2 effector inhibits extracellular plant cysteine proteases, including Rcr3, Pipl, aleurain and TDI6 (Kruger et al. 2002; Rooney et al. 2005; Shabab et al. 2008). C.\n\nfulvum strains producing Avr2 trigger HR in tomato lines that carry Rcr3 and the cognate Cf-2 resistance gene (Dixon et al. 1996; Luderer et al. 2002b). The Avr4 effector is a chitin-binding protein that protects the fungal cell wall against the deleterious effects of plant chitinases (van den Burg et al. 2006; van den Burg et al. 2004; van den Burg et al. 2003).\n\nTomato plants that carry the cognate Cf -4 resistance gene recognize Avr4-producing strains of C. fulvum and initiate an HR (Joosten et al. 1994; Joosten et al. 1997, Westerink et al. 2004). The nucleic acid sequence of the tomato Cf- 4 gene is disclosed in WO 96/35790, along with the encoded amino acid sequence of Cf4. WO 96/35790 also describes a method for increasing the resistance in a plant to C. fulvum by transforming the plant with a nucleic acid sequence encoding for the Cf- 4 gene, thereby providing the plant with Cf4 proteins that recognize the Avr4 effector protein. However, as the method confers a plant with resistance to C.\n\nfulvum strains that produce Avr4, its application is limited to plants that are susceptible to infection with C. fulvum, such as a tomato plant and tobacco. The method is not suitable for increasing resistance in plants that are susceptible to pathogens other than C. fulvum, i.e. plants such as banana, sugar beet, tobacco, maize, and celery. A method for increasing the resistance to pathogens of plants other than tomato plants is thus still direly needed. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe current invention provides such a method. Provided is a method for increasing the resistance of a plant or part thereof that is susceptible to infection with a pathogen comprising an ortholog of the Avr4 protein of Cladosporium fulvum, wherein said method comprises transforming said plant or part thereof with a nucleic acid encoding for Cf 4 or a functional homologue thereof and wherein said plant is not a tomato or tobacco plant. Preferably, said plant or part thereof is selected from the group consisting of a banana plant, a wheat plant, a sugar beet plant, a maize plant, and a celery plant. Preferably, said functional homologue is an Hcr9-Avr4 protein.\n\nIn one embodiment, said transforming comprises introducing a nucleic acid delivery vehicle. Preferably, said delivery vehicle is an expression vector. More preferably, said expression vector is a virus-based expression vector. Preferably, said virus is an adenovirus or a retrovirus.\n\nAlso provided is a method for screening the resistance of a plant or a part thereof to at least one pathogen, said method comprising: a) screening said at least one pathogen for presence of the Avr4 protein of Cladosporium fulÏ um or an ortholog thereof, b) selecting at least one pathogen comprising said Avr4 protein of Cladosporium fulÏ um or an ortholog thereof, c) introducing said at least one pathogen to said plant or part thereof, and d) screening said plant or part thereof for the absence or presence of a defense response to said at least one pathogen, wherein said plant is not a tomato or tobacco plant. Preferably, said plant or part thereof is selected from the group consisting of a banana plant, a wheat plant, a sugar beet plant, a maize plant and a celery plant. Preferably, said ortholog comprises a chitin-binding domain similar to that found in members of the CBM14 superfamily of chitin-binding proteins. More preferably, said ortholog comprises an amino acid sequence that is selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5 and SEQ ID NO: 6., more preferably selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5 and SEQ ID NO: 6.\n\nPreferably, the pathogen in the methods according to the invention is a fungus, with the proviso that said fungus is not Cladosporium fulÏ um. More preferably, said fungus is a Dothideomycete. Even more preferably, said Dothideomycete is selected from the group consisting of\n\nMycosphaerella fijiensis, Cercospora nicotianae, Cercospora beticola, Cercospora zeina, and Cercospora apii. Further provided is the use of the methods according to the invention for increasing the resistance of a plant or part thereof to at least one pathogen, wherein said plant is not a tomato or tobacco plant. Even further provided is the use of the methods according to the invention for screening the resistance of a plant or a part thereof to at least one pathogen, wherein said plant is not a tomato or tobacco plant. Preferably, said plant or part thereof is selected from the group consisting of a banana plant, a wheat plant, a sugar beet plant, a maize plant and a celery plant. Preferably, said pathogen is a fungus, with the proviso that said fungus is not Cladosporium fulÏ um. More preferably, said fungus is a\n\nDothideomycete. Even more preferably, said Dothideomycete is selected from the group consisting of Mycosphaerella fijiensis, Cercospora nicotianae, Cercospora beticola, Cercospora zeina, and Cercospora apii.\n\nIt is further submitted that the present invention does not comprise any of the methods or plants that are disclosed in WO 96/35790. This specifically relates to a method for introducing Cf4 in plants to provide resistance to C. fulÏ um, or plants transgenic for the Cf4 sequence. Also excluded from the present invention are plants that are transgenic for both the Cf4 and the Avr4 sequences. Further excluded are tomato and tobacco plants transgenic for the Cf4 sequence or the Avr4 sequence.\n\nLEGENDS TO THE FIGURES\n\nFigure 1: Conservation of the chitin-binding domain amongst CBM_14 proteins based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM). The cysteine residues (denoted as large C) are always conserved.\n\nFigure 2: The disulfide bond pattern of the C. fulÏ um Avr4 (van den Burg et al. 2003). Connected open bars represent three conserved disulfide bonds of the invertebrate chitin-binding domain (inv ChBD). Connected filled bands represent additional bonds. A similar disulfide bond pattern is expected for the M. fijiensis and Cercopsora Avr4-orthologs as well. Figure 3: Alignment of the amino acid sequences of the Avr4-protein from C. fulÏ um (SEQ ID NO: 1) and the orthologs thereof from M. fijiensis (SEQ ID NO: 2), C. nicotianae (SEQ ID NO: 3), C. beticola (SEQ ID NO: 4), C. zeina (SEQ ID NO: 5), and C. apii (SEQ ID NO: 6). A predicted chitin- binding domain (highlighted) is present in all three sequences. Conserved cysteine residues (in bold) that are involved in the formation of disulfide- bridges and are important for protein stability are also indicated. Figure 4: Infiltrations of the M. fijiensis Avr4 in Cf 4 (left) and CfO (right) tomato plants. For the purpose of this experiment, the Pichia pastoris expression system was used to produce MfA vr4. In this picture crude MfA vr4 extracts isolated from culture filtrates of P. pastoris producing MfA vr4 were infiltrated in Cf-4 (containing the matching cognate Cf4 resistance protein) and Cf-O (no Cf4 resistance protein present) tomato plants. Infiltrations with MfA vr4 clearly result in an HR in the presence of the Cf-4 resistance gene. Pictures were taken 7 days post injection.\n\nFigure 5: Transient co-expression of Cf genes from tomato and ALT genes from C. fulÏ um and M. fijiensis in Nicotiana benthamiana by\n\nagroinfiltration. Four transient expression Agrobacterium cultures were mixed in a 1:1 ratio and infiltrated. Pictures were taken six days post infiltration. The pictures demonstrate that co-expression of the M. fijiensis Avr4 (MfAvr4) and the tomato Cf-4 gene results in HR on N. benthamiana leaves (left panel). However, HR is not induced when MfAvr4 is co- expressed with Cf- 9, indicating the specificity of the interaction between Cf 4 and MfA vr4 (right panel). As a control for this experiment, the C. fulÏ um AÏ r4 (Avr4) and Avr9 were co-expressed with Cf-4 and Cf- 9. In this case, HR is only observed upon co-expression oÂ£AÏ r4 and Cf-4 (left panel) or AÏ r9 with Cf- 9 (right panel), as expected. Figure 6: Specific HR induced responses in a MM-Cf4 tomato line after transient expression of the MfAvr4, using a PVX-based expression system. Cotyledons from a four-week-old tomato line carrying the Cf- 4 resistance gene (MM-Cf4) have been inoculated with A. tumefaciens transformants of PVX::P~RlaMfAvr4. These transformants harbor the M. fijiensis AvÏ4 cDNA in the binary PVX-based vector pSfinx, downstream of the 35S promoter and fused to the PRIa signal sequence from tobacco. HR occurs only in leaflets of the MM-Cf4 tomato line but not in leaflets of the MM- CfO line, thus showing the specific recognition of the MfA vr4 by Cf4. As controls PVX containing the empty pSfinx vector (PVX::pSfinx) and the C. fulvum Avr4 in a binary vector (PVX::PRlaCÂ£4Î¹>r4), were used. As expected, the PVX-based expression of the C. fulvum AÏ r4 results in an HR only in the MM-Cf4 line but not in the MM-CfO line. Only mosaic symptoms were observed upon inoculations of the MM-Cf4 and Cf-O lines with PVX containing the empty pSfinx vector. Pictures were taken 14 days after inoculation.\n\nFigure 7: Specific binding of MfAvr4 to chitin but not to other\n\npolysaccharides. PichiÎ± pÎ±storis culture filtrate containing MfA vr4 was incubated together with the insoluble polysaccharides crab shell chitin, chitin-agarose resin chitosan, cellulose, and xylan at ambient temperature for 2 hrs. Chitin-binding affinity was determined by loading both bound (B) and unbound protein (S) protein fraction on separate SDS-PAGE gels. His- Flag-tagged MfA vr4 was detected using an anti-Flag tag monoclonal antibody. Equal amounts of the bound and unbound protein were loaded on the gel. To this aim, the protein fraction in the supernatant was precipitated in the presence of 10% TCA (w/v). S, protein that remained in the concentrated supernatant fraction; P, protein bound to insoluble polysaccharide fraction. MfA vr4 is specifically precipitated with chitin and specific binding was confirmed in five independent replicate experiments. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\nDefinitions As used herein, the term \"plant or part thereof means any complete or partial plant, including single cells and cell tissues such as plant cells that are intact in plants, cell clumps and tissue cultures from which plants can be regenerated. Examples of plant parts include, but are not limited to, single cells and tissues from pollen, ovules, leaves, embryos, roots, root tips, anthers, flowers, fruits, stems shoots, and seeds; as well as pollen, ovules, leaves, embryos, roots, root tips, anthers, flowers, fruits, stems, shoots, scions, rootstocks, seeds, protoplasts, calli, and the like.\n\nAs used herein, the term \"variety\" is as defined in the UPOV treaty and refers to a group of similar plants that by structural or genetic features and/or performance can be distinguished from other varieties within the same species.\n\nThe term \"cultivar\" (for cultivated variety) as used herein is defined as a variety that is not normally found in nature but that has been cultivated by humans, i.e. having a biological status other than a \"wild\" status, which \"wild\" status indicates the original non-cultivated, or natural state of a plant or accession. The term \"cultivar\" includes, but is not limited to, semi-natural, semi-wild, weedy, traditional cultivar, landrace, breeding material, research material, breeder's line, synthetic population, hybrid, founder stock/base population, inbred line (parent of hybrid cultivar), segregating population, mutant/genetic stock, and advanced/improved cultivar. As used herein, the term \"clade\" means a monophyletic group, defined as a group consisting of a single common ancestor and all its descendants. The term \"pathogen\" as used herein is defined as any biological agent that causes disease or illness to its host. This includes bacteria, fungi, viruses and prions.\n\nAs used herein, \"gene\" means a hereditary unit (often indicated by a sequence of DNA) that occupies a specific location on a chromosome and that contains the genetic instruction for a particular phenotypic characteristics or trait in an organism such as a plant.\n\nThe term \"nucleic acid\" refers to deoxyribonucleotides or\n\nribonucleotides and polymers thereof in either single-or double- stranded form, composed of monomers (nucleotides) containing a sugar, phosphate and a base which is either a purine or pyrimidine. Unless specifically limited, the term encompasses nucleic acids containing known analogs of natural nucleotides which have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid and are metabolized in a manner similar to naturally occurring nucleotides. Unless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof (e. g., degenerate codon substitutions) and complementary sequences as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. Specifically, degenerate codon substitutions may be achieved by generating sequences in which the third position of one or more selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed-base and/or deoxyinosine residues (Batzer et al., 1991; Ohtsuka et al., 1985; Rossolini et al. 1994). A \"nucleic acid fragment\" is a fraction of a given nucleic acid molecule. In higher plants,\n\ndeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the genetic material while ribonucleic acid (RNA) is involved in the transfer of information contained within DNA into proteins. The term \"nucleotide sequence\" refers to a polymer of DNA or RNA which can be single-or double-stranded, optionally containing synthetic, non-natural or altered nucleotide bases capable of incorporation into DNA or RNA polymers. The terms \"nucleic acid\" or \"nucleic acid sequence\" may also be used interchangeably with gene, cDNA, DNA and RNA encoded by a gene\n\nThe term \"homology\" is defined as (having) one or more similarities between characteristics that is due to their shared ancestry. In genetics, homology can be observed in DNA sequences that code for proteins (genes) and in non-coding DNA. For protein coding genes, one can compare translated amino acid sequences of different genes. For proteins, one can compare amino acid sequences of different proteins. Sequence homology may also indicate common function.\n\nThe terms \"homolog\" and \"homologue\" as used herein mean any gene or protein that is related to a second gene or protein by descent from a common ancestral DNA sequence. The term, homolog, may apply to the relationship between genes or proteins separated by the event of speciation (orthology) or to the relationship between genes or proteins separated by the event of genetic duplication (paralogy).\n\nThe term \"homologous to\" in the context of nucleotide or amino acid sequence identity refers to the similarity between the nucleotide sequences of two nucleic acid molecules or between the amino acid sequences of two protein molecules. Estimates of such homology are provided by either DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA hybridization under conditions of stringency as is well understood by those skilled in the art (as described in Haines and Higgins (eds.), Nucleic Acid Hybridization, IRL Press,\n\nOxford, U. K.), or by the comparison of sequence similarity between two nucleic acids or proteins. Two nucleotide or amino acid sequences are homologous when their sequences have a sequence similarity of more than 50%, preferably more than 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or even 98%.\n\nAs used herein, the terms \"ortholog\" and \"orthologue\" are defined as any gene or protein in a species that is similar to one or more genes or proteins in other species. This includes orthologs arisen from a common ancestor. Genes or proteins that are found within one clade are orthologs, descended from a common ancestor. Orthologs often, but not always, have the same function. It also includes homologies that have arisen by convergent evolution.\n\nThe terms \"genetic engineering\", \"recombinant DNA technology\", \"genetic modification/manipulation (GM)\" and \"gene splicing\" as used herein all refer to techniques for direct manipulation of an organism's genes. These techniques are different from traditional breeding, where the organism's genes are manipulated indirectly. They use the techniques of molecular cloning and transformation to alter the structure and\n\ncharacteristics of genes directly. Genetic engineering techniques have found some successes in numerous applications, such as in improving crop technology, the manufacture of synthetic human insulin through the use of modified bacteria, the manufacture of erythropoietin in hamster ovary cells, and the production of new types of experimental mice such as the oncomouse (cancer mouse) for research. In general, genetic engineering, recombinant DNA technology, genetic modification/manipulation (GM) and comprise five main steps: 1) isolation of the genes of interest, 2) insertion of the genes into a transfer vector, 3) transfer of the vector to the organism to be modified, 4) transformation of the cells of the organism and 5) selection of the genetically modified organism (GMO) from those that have not been successfully modified.\n\nThe term \"transformation\" refers to the transfer of a nucleic acid fragment into the genome of a host cell, resulting in genetically stable inheritance. Host cells containing the transformed nucleic acid fragments are referred to as \"transgenic\" cells, and organisms comprising transgenic cells are referred to as \"transgenic organisms\". Examples of methods of transformation of plants and plant cells include Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (De Blaere et Î±l., 1987) particle bombardment technology (Klein et al. 1987; U.S. Patent No. 4,945,050), microinjection, CaPO4 precipitation, lipofection (liposome fusion), use of a gene gun and DNA vector transporter (Kao et al., 2008). Whole plants may be regenerated from transgenic cells by methods well known to the skilled artisan (see, for example, Fromm et al., 1990).\n\nThe terms \"transformed\", \"transgenic\" and \"recombinant\" as used herein refer to a host organism such as a bacterium or a plant into which a heterologous nucleic acid molecule has been introduced. The heterologous nucleic acid molecule can be stably integrated into the genome generally known in the art and are disclosed in Sambrook et al., 1989. See also Innis and Gelfand, 1999. For example, \"transformed\", \"transformant\", and \"transgenic\" plants or calli have been through the transformation process and contain a foreign gene integrated into their chromosome. The term \"untransformed\" refers to normal plants that have not been through the transformation process.\n\nAs used herein, \"vector\" is defined as any DNA molecule used as a vehicle to transfer foreign genetic material into another cell. This includes plasmids, bacteriophages and other viruses, cosmids, and artificial chromosomes. The vector may comprise an origin of replication, a multicloning site, and / or a selectable marker.\n\nThe term \"expression vector\" as used herein is defined as any expression construct that is used to introduce a specific nucleic acid into a target cell and express the protein that is encoded by that nucleic acid. Once the expression vector is inside the cell, the protein that is encoded by the nucleic acid may be produced by the cellular-transcription and translation machinery. This includes expression vectors that comprise regulatory sequences that act as enhancer and promoter regions and lead to efficient transcription of the nucleic acid carried on the expression vector. It also includes expression vectors that comprise a termination codon, adjustment of the distance between the promoter and the cloned gene, a transcription termination sequence and / or a PTIS (portable translation initiation sequence). As used herein, \"plasmid\" means any extra-chromosomal DNA molecule separate from the chromosomal DNA which is capable of replicating independently of the chromosomal DNA. This includes any double- stranded generally circular DNA sequence that is capable of automatically replicating in a host cell.\n\nAs used herein, the term \"virus\" means any microscopic infectious agent that can only reproduce inside a host cell. This includes all non- enveloped viruses, i.e. viruses comprising a protein coat that protects the viruses' genes. It also includes all enveloped viruses, i.e. viruses further comprising an envelope of fat surrounding the viruses when they are outside the host cell. It includes all DNA viruses, RNA viruses and reverse transcription viruses.\n\nThe term \"adenovirus\" as used herein is defined as any non- enveloped icosahedral virus that is composed of a nucleocapsid and a double- stranded linear DNA genome and that belongs to the family AdenoÏ iridae.\n\nAs used herein, the term \"retrovirus\" means any RNA virus that is replicated in a host cell via the enzyme reverse transcriptase to produce DNA from its RNA genome and that belongs to the family Retroviridae.\n\nThe term \"virus-based\" as used herein is defined as being based on any genetically-engineered virus carrying modified viral DNA or RNA that has been rendered noninfectious, but still comprises viral promoters and the nucleic acid to be translated, thus allowing for translation of the nucleic acid through a viral promoter. A \"marker gene\" encodes a selectable or screenable trait. The term \"selectable marker\" refers to a polynucleotide sequence encoding a metabolic trait which allows for the separation of transgenic and non- transgenic organisms and mostly refers to the provision of antibiotic resistance. A selectable marker is for example the aphLl encoded kanamycin resistance marker, the nptll gene, the gene coding for hygromycin resistance. Other selection markers are for instance reporter genes such as chloramphenicol acetyl transferase, Î²-galactosidase, luciferase and green fluorescence protein. Identification methods for the products of reporter genes include, but are not limited to, enzymatic assays and fluorimetric assays. Reporter genes and assays to detect their products are well known in the art and are described, for example in \"Current Protocols in Molecular Biology\", eds. Ausubel et al., Greene Publishing and Wiley-Interscience: New York (1987) and periodic updates.\n\nThe terms \"peptide\" and \"protein\" as used herein are used interchangeably and are defined as any polymer formed from amino acids that are linked in a defined order by amide bonds or peptide bonds. This includes all ribosomal peptides, non-ribosomal peptides, peptones, monopeptides, dipeptides, tripeptides, oligopeptides, polypeptides and peptide fragments.\n\nThe term \"coding sequence\" as used herein refers to a DNA or RNA sequence that codes for a specific amino acid sequence and excludes the non-coding sequences. It may constitute an \"uninterrupted coding sequence\", i.e., lacking an intron, such as in a cDNA or it may include one or more introns bound by appropriate splice junctions. An \"intron\" is a sequence of RNA which is contained in the primary transcript but which is removed through cleavage and re-ligation of the RNA within the cell to create the mature mRNA that can be translated into a protein. As used herein, \"regulatory sequences\" refer to nucleotide sequences located upstream (5' non-coding sequences), within, or\n\ndownstream (3' non-coding sequences) of a coding sequence, and which influence the transcription, RNA processing or stability, or translation of the associated coding sequence. Regulatory sequences include enhancers, promoters, translation leader sequences, introns, and polyadenylation signal sequences. They include natural and synthetic sequences as well as sequences which may be a combination of synthetic and natural sequences. As is noted above, the term \"suitable regulatory sequences\" is not limited to promoters.\n\nThe term \"promoter\" as used herein refers to a nucleotide sequence, usually upstream (5') to its coding sequence, which controls the expression of the coding sequence by providing the recognition for RNA polymerase and other factors required for proper transcription. \"Promoter\" includes a minimal promoter that is a short DNA sequence comprised of a TATA box and other sequences that serve to specify the site of\n\ntranscription initiation, to which regulatory elements are added for control of expression. \"Promoter\" also refers to a nucleotide sequence that includes a minimal promoter plus regulatory elements that is capable of controlling the expression of a coding sequence or functional RNA. This type of promoter sequence consists of proximal and more distal upstream\n\nelements, the latter elements often referred to as enhancers. Accordingly, an \"enhancer\" is a DNA sequence which can stimulate promoter activity and may be an innate element of the promoter or a heterologous element inserted to enhance the level or tissue specificity of a promoter. It is capable of operating in both orientations (normal or flipped), and is capable of functioning even when moved either upstream or downstream from the promoter. Both enhancers and other upstream promoter elements bind sequence- specific DNA-binding proteins that mediate their effects. Promoters may be derived in their entirety from a native gene, or be composed of different elements derived from different promoters found in nature, or even be comprised of synthetic DNA segments. A promoter may also contain DNA sequences that are involved in the binding of protein factors which control the effectiveness of transcription initiation in response to physiological or developmental conditions. As used herein, the term \"constitutive promoter\" refers to a promoter that is able to express the open reading frame (ORF) that it controls in all or nearly all of the plant tissues during all or nearly all developmental stages of the plant. The term \"expression\" as used herein refers to the transcription and/or translation of an endogenous gene, open reading frame (ORF) or portion thereof, or a transgene in plants. Expression refers to the transcription and stable accumulation of sense (mRNA) or functional RNA. Expression may also refer to the production of protein.\n\nThe term \"constitutive expression\" as used herein refers to expression using a constitutive promoter. \"Transient expression\" is expression as a result of a transient transformation event. Transient expression of a gene refers to the expression of a gene that is not\n\nintegrated into the host chromosome but functions independently, either as part of an autonomously replicating plasmid or expression cassette, for example, or as part of another biological system such as a virus.\n\nThe term \"primer\" as used herein refers to an oligonucleotide which is capable of annealing to the amplification target allowing a DNA polymerase to attach thereby serving as a point of initiation of DNA synthesis when placed under conditions in which synthesis of primer extension product which is complementary to a nucleic acid strand is induced, i.e., in the presence of nucleotides and an agent for\n\npolymerization such as DNA polymerase and at a suitable temperature and pH. The (amplification) primer is preferably single stranded for maximum efficiency in amplification. Preferably, the primer is an oligodeoxyribonucleotide. The primer must be sufficiently long to prime the synthesis of extension products in the presence of the agent for polymerization. The exact lengths of the primers will depend on many factors, including temperature and source of primer. A \"pair of bi- directional primers\" as used herein refers to one forward and one reverse primer as commonly used in the art of DNA amplification such as in PCR amplification.\n\nAs used herein, the term \"probe\" means a single- stranded\n\noligonucleotide sequence that will recognize and form a hydrogen-bonded duplex with a complementary sequence in a target nucleic acid sequence analyte or its cDNA derivative.\n\nThe terms \"stringency\" or \"stringent hybridization conditions\" refer to hybridization conditions that affect the stability of hybrids, e.g., temperature, salt concentration, pH, formamide concentration and the like. These conditions are empirically optimised to maximize specific binding and minimize non-specific binding of primer or probe to its target nucleic acid sequence. The terms as used include reference to conditions under which a probe or primer will hybridise to its target sequence, to a detectably greater degree than other sequences (e.g. at least 2-fold over background). Stringent conditions are sequence dependent and will be different in different circumstances. Longer sequences hybridise\n\nspecifically at higher temperatures. Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 5Â°C lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH. The Tm is the temperature (under defined ionic strength and pH) at which 50% of a complementary target sequence hybridises to a perfectly matched probe or primer.\n\nTypically, stringent conditions will be those in which the salt concentration is less than about 1.0 M Na+ ion, typically about 0.01 to 1.0 M Na+ ion concentration (or other salts) at pH 7.0 to 8.3 and the temperature is at least about 300C for short probes or primers (e.g. 10 to 50 nucleotides) and at least about 600C for long probes or primers (e.g. greater than 50 nucleotides). Stringent conditions may also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents such as formamide. Exemplary low stringent conditions or \"conditions of reduced stringency\" include hybridization with a buffer solution of 30% formamide, 1 M NaCl, 1% SDS at 37Â°C and a wash in 2x SSC at 400C. Exemplary high stringency conditions include hybridization in 50% formamide, 1 M NaCl, 1% SDS at 37Â°C, and a wash in O.lx SSC at 600C. Hybridization procedures are well known in the art and are described in e.g. Ausubel, F.M., Brent, R.,\n\nKingston, R.E., Moore, D.D.,Seidman, J.G., Smith, J.A., Struhl, K. eds. (1998) Current protocols in molecular biology. V.B. Chanda, series ed. New York: John Wiley & Sons. Description\n\nApart from Ecp6 so far homologues of the C. fulÏ um effector proteins have never been identified in other fungal species (Bolton et al. 2008). However, the inventors have found that several other fungi belonging to the Dothideomycetes clustering in the family of the\n\nMycosphaerellaceae, including M. fijiensis, C. nicotianae, C. beticola, C. zeina, and C. apii produce effectors that are functionally related to those of C. fulÏ um. By (i) structural homology search using BLAST, (ii) mining of sequenced fungal genomes for homologous nucleotide sequences and protein motifs and (iii) using PCR-based techniques and chromosome walking, the inventors have now identified for the first time orthologs of the C. fulÏ um Avr4 effectors in the fungal pathogens M. fijiensis, C.\n\nnicotianae, C. beticola, C. zeina, and C. apii and have deduced their amino acid sequences as shown in Figure 3. This indicates that the C. fulÏ um Avr and Ecp effector homologues occur as orthologs in related plant pathogens that, however, infect and cause disease on totally unrelated host plant species like banana (monocot), sugar beet and tobacco (dicots). In particular, orthologs with various degrees of identity to the Avr4 protein of C. fulÏ um were identified in M. fijiensis (34% iden.), C.\n\nnicotianae (32% iden.), C. beticola (27% iden.), C. apii (27% iden.), and C. zeina, (32% iden.), but it is expected that they do occur in all major groups of fungal species belonging to the order of the Dothideomycetes.\n\nEight cysteine residues are present in the C. fulÏ um Avr4 protein, which are involved in the formation of disulfide bridges occurring in proteins that bind chitin of the CBM 14 superfamily (Chitin binding Peritrophin-A; see Figures 1 and 2). Avr4 protects fungal cell- wall chitin against plant chitinases in vitro and during infection. These cysteine residues are also conserved in the Avr4 orthologs of M. fijiensis, C.\n\nnicotianae, C. beticola, C. zeina, and C. apii, suggesting that those orthologs are also capable of binding chitin. Indeed, the inventors demonstrate that the M. fijiensis Avr4 ortholog produced in Pichia pastoris also binds chitin, indicating that it is a genuine ortholog or functional homologue of the C. fulvum Avr4 (Figure 7). The practical implication of this important finding is demonstrated in the Example, wherein the inventors demonstrate that co-expression of the M. fijiensis Avr4 ortholog and tomato Cf4 protein elicits a HR response in tobacco plants. Thus, the resistance of plants other than tomato plants to fungi belonging to the Dothideomycetes, other than Cladosporium fulvum, producing Avr 4- orthologs can be increased by providing these plants with Cf4 protein. The inventors therefore provide a method for increasing the resistance of a plant or part thereof that is susceptible to infection with a pathogen comprising an ortholog of the Avr4 protein of Cladosporium fulvum, wherein said method comprises transforming said plant or part thereof with a nucleic acid encoding for Cf4 or a functional homologue thereof and wherein said plant is not a tomato or tobacco plant. It will be clear to a skilled person that the method can be applied to any plant other than a tomato plant that is susceptible to infection with a pathogen comprising an ortholog of the Avr4 protein of Cladosporium fulÏ um.\n\nPreferably, said plant or part thereof is selected from the group consisting of a banana plant, a wheat plant, a sugar beet plant, a maize plant or a celery plant. For example, the resistance of a banana plant to M. fijiensis may be increased by transforming the banana plant with a nucleic acid encoding for the Cf4 protein.\n\nPlants may be transformed with any nucleic acid encoding for a functional homologue of Cf4, i.e. a protein comprising an amino acid sequence that shows a high degree of similarity to the amino acid sequence of Cf4 (not being Cf4 itself) and that is capable to recognize Avr4 and orthologs thereof. As a skilled person will appreciate, homologous proteins can be found by applying any suitable screening method known in the art. For example, structural homology searches can be performed in databases, either at protein or DNA level. Also, sequenced plant genomes can be mined for homologous nucleotide sequences and protein motifs. When applying mining methods, amplification techniques such as PCR- based techniques may be applied to amplify the found DNA sequences.\n\nHomologous proteins can be found in different plants. For example, the inventors found that functional Cf4 homologues termed Hcr9-Avr4s are present in species belonging to the Lycopersicon lexicon in the\n\nSolanum genus: S. hirsutum (Genbank accession number AJ002235), S. chilense (AY634610), S. chmielewskii (AY634611), S. parviflorum\n\n(AY634612) and S. peruÏ ianum (AY634613). These proteins are 93-98% identical to each other, as can be observed in Table 1. Thus, said functional homologue is preferably an Hcr9-Avr4 peptide. Table 1: Amino acid alignment scores of the Hcr9-Avr4 homologues from S. hirsutum, S. peruÏ ianum, S. chmielewskii, S. chilense and S. parÏ iflorum.\n\nSeqA Name Len(aa) SeqB Name Len(aa) Score\n\n1 S_parvi florum 807 2 S_hirsutum 806 93\n\n1 S_parvi florum 807 3 S_peruvianum 807 98\n\n1 S_parvi florum 807 4 S_chmielewskii 807 98\n\n1 S_parvi florum 807 5 S_chilense 807 95\n\n2 S_hirsutum 806 3 S_peruvianum 807 93\n\n2 S hirsutum 806 4 S chmielewskii 807 93\n\n2 S hirsutum 806 5 S chilense 807 97\n\n3 S_peruvianum 807 4 S_chmielewskii 807 98\n\n3 S_peruvianum 807 5 S_chilense 807 94\n\n4 S_chmielewskii 807 5 S_chilense 807 94\n\nMethods for transforming an organism with a foreign nucleic acid are known in the art, as described in for example \"Gene Transfer: Delivery And Expression of DNA And RNA, A Laboratory Manual\", Friedmann and Rossi ed., 2006 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring harbor, USA. For example, it is well known that an organism can be transformed with a nucleic acid by introducing a vector comprising the nucleic acid.\n\nVirtually any nucleic acid delivery vehicle may be used for delivery to recipient plant cells. For example, DNA segments in the form of plasmids, AgrobÎ±cterium binary vectors and viral vectors such as virus- based expression vectors, or linear DNA fragments, in some instances containing only the DNA element to be expressed in the plant, and the like, may be employed. When employing virus-based vectors, such vectors are preferably based on an adenovirus or a retrovirus. The construction of vectors which may be employed in conjunction with the present invention will be known to those of skill of the art in light of the present disclosure (see, e. g., Sambrook et Î±l., 1989; Gelvin et Î±l., 1990). Vectors, including but not limited to plasmids, cosmids, YACs (yeast artificial chromosomes), BACs (bacterial artificial chromosomes) and DNA segments for use in transforming cells, according to the present invention will, of course, comprise the cDNA, gene or genes necessary for production of the desired protein in the transformant.\n\nThe vector of the invention can be introduced into any plant. The genes and sequences to be introduced can be conveniently used in expression cassettes for introduction and expression in any plant of interest. The transcriptional cassette will include in the 5'-to-3' direction of transcription, transcriptional and translational initiation regions, a DNA sequence of interest, and transcriptional and translational termination regions functional in plants.\n\nThe termination region may be native with the transcriptional initiation region, may be native with the DNA sequence of interest, or may be derived from another source.\n\nConvenient termination regions are available from the Ti-plasmid of A. tumefaciens, such as the octopine synthase and nopaline synthase termination regions.

Expression of heterologous DNA sequences in a plant host is dependent upon the presence of an operably linked promoter that is functional within the plant host.\n\nTransformation of plants can be undertaken with a single DNA molecule or multiple DNA molecules (i. e., co-transformation), and both these techniques are suitable for use with the expression cassettes of the present invention. Numerous transformation vectors are available for plant transformation, and the expression cassettes of this invention can be used in conjunction with any such vectors. The selection of vector will depend upon the preferred transformation technique and the target species for transformation.\n\nSuitable methods of transforming plant cells include, but are not limited to, microinjection (Crossway et al., 1986), electroporation (Riggs et al., 1986), Agrobacterium -mediated transformation (Hinchee et al., 1988), direct gene transfer (Paszkowski et al., 1984), and ballistic particle acceleration using devices available from Agracetus, Inc., Madison, Wis. And BioRad, Hercules, Calif, (see, for example, Sanford et al., U. S. Pat. No. 4,945,050; and McCabe et al., 1988). Also see Weissinger et al., 1988; Sanford et al., 1987 (onion); Christou et al., 1988 (soybean); McCabe et al., 1988 (soybean); Datta et al., 1990 (rice); Klein et al., 1989 (maize); Fromm et al., 1990 (maize); and Gordon- Kamm et al., 1990 (maize); Svab et al., 1990 (tobacco chloroplast); Koziel et al., 1993 (maize); Shimamoto et al., 1989 (rice); Christou et al., 1991 (rice); European Patent Application EP 0 332 581 (orchard grass and other Pooideae); Vasil et al., 1992 (wheat); Weeks et al., 1993 (wheat). For example, the resistance of a banana plant to M. fijiensis is increased by transforming the banana plant with an expression vector comprising a nucleic acid encoding for an Hcr9-Avr4 protein.\n\nOther transformation methods are available to those skilled in the art, such as direct uptake of foreign DNA constructs (see EP 0295959), techniques of electroporation (Fromm et al., 1986) or high velocity ballistic bombardment with metal particles coated with the nucleic acid constructs (Klein et al., 1987, and U. S. Patent No. 4,945,050). Once transformed, the cells can be regenerated by those skilled in the art.\n\nThose skilled in the art will appreciate that the choice of method might depend on the type of plant, i.e., whether a plant is\n\nmonocotyledonous such as a banana or dicotyledonous such as sugar beet and tobacco plants.\n\nIn order to provide a quick and simple test if a new plant species indeed can yield a hypersensitive response upon presentation of the effector proteins of the invention, the person skilled in the art can perform one of two tests. One of the most reliable is the infiltration of the elicitor protein in the leaves, and scoring for the HR. Another one is a rapid transient expression test known under the name of ATTA (Agrobacterium tumefaciens Transient expression Assay). In this assay (of which a detailed description can be found in Van den Ackerveken, G., et al., Cell 87, 1307-1316, 1996) the nucleotide sequence coding for an effector protein is placed under control of the CaMV 35S promoter and introduced into an Agrobacterium strain which is also used in protocols for stable\n\ntransformation. After incubation of the bacteria with acetosyringon or any other phenolic compound which is known to enhance Agrobacterium T- DNA transfer, 1 ml of the Agrobacterium culture is infiltrated into an in situ plant by injection after which the plants are placed in a greenhouse. After 2-5 days the leaves can be scored for occurrence of HR symptoms.\n\nAlso provided is a method for screening the resistance of a plant or a part thereof to at least one pathogen, said method comprising: a) screening said at least one pathogen for presence of the Avr4 protein of Cladosporium fulÏ um or an ortholog thereof, b) selecting at least one pathogen comprising said Avr4 protein of Cladosporium fulÏ um or an ortholog thereof, c) introducing said at least one pathogen to said plant or part thereof, and d) screening said plant or part thereof for the absence or presence of a defense response to said at least one pathogen, wherein said plant is not a tomato plant. Preferably, said plant or part thereof is selected from the group consisting of a banana plant, a wheat plant, a maize plant, a celery plant or a sugar beet plant. Preferably, said ortholog comprises a chitin-binding domain similar to that found in members of the CBM 14 superfamily of chitin-binding proteins. More preferably, said ortholog comprises an amino acid sequence that is selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5 and SEQ ID NO: 6., more preferably selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5 and SEQ ID NO: 6. Also preferred is screening a tobacco plant with an ortholog of Avr 4.\n\nMethods for screening pathogens for peptides are known in the art. A pathogen may be screened for the presence of Avr4 or an ortholog thereof by applying any method or technique deemed suitable by a person skilled in the art. Such methods include, but are not limited to, protein electrophoresis such as SDS-PAGE, electroblotting, immunoblot or\n\nWestern blot, protein immunostaining, protein immunoprecipitation, protein assay, mass spectrometry such as MALDI-TOF and ESI-TOF, and chromatography such as HPLC and RPC. For example, several pathogens are screened for the presence of Avr4 or an ortholog thereof by Western blot. Based on the outcome of the Western blot, a pathogen comprising Avr4 is selected and introduced to a banana plant. Also screening methods based on bioinformatics may be applied. Also, mathematical similarity searches, such as for example BLAST, are very suitable for screening peptides in pathogens for similarity to Avr4.\n\nOne method to introduce the pathogen comprising the Avr4 protein or an ortholog thereof to a plant that is not a tomato plant is by directly applying the pathogen onto a part of the plant, e.g. a leaf or a stem segment. Alternatively, the pathogen may be injected. In a plant that does not have the functional cognate resistance gene the application of the pathogen will cause disease. However, in a plant that harbours a functional resistance gene, the Cf4 protein or functional homologue thereof will recognize the Avr4 or ortholog effector protein that is expressed by the pathogen and the cascade leading to the hypersensitive reaction will be started. As discussed before, and as is shown in Figure 4, this will lead to a local necrosis of the plant tissue, or, in a less strong reaction, to chlorosis of the injected site, which effect can be visually observed.\n\nIn stead of directly applying the pathogen onto a plant or part thereof it is also possible to introduce the pathogen indirectly to the plant by transforming the plant with a nucleic acid encoding for the Avr4 protein or ortholog thereof. One of the most suitable ways to enable expression of the protein in a plant or plant part is through the so-called ATTA (Agrobacterium tumefaciens Transient expression Assay), in which an Agrobacterium tumefaciens bacterium is provided with a construct encoding an effector protein according to the invention. Since the nucleotide sequences encoding the effector proteins are disclosed in this description or can be derived from the amino acid sequences that are also provided in the present description, any person of skill will be able to clone a coding sequence into an expression vector that is suitable for\n\nAgrobacterium transformation.\n\nAlternatively, a viral vector can be used. A nucleic acid encoding the Avr4 effector protein or an ortholog thereof can be cloned into a viral vector after which the viral particles are used to infect the plant or plant part and to express the protein. Using a viral vector in which the virus stills maintains its infectious properties has a further advantage. Next to the observation of local necrosis or chlorosis, which indicates the presence of the resistance gene, the absence of the resistance gene will also be visible, because in such plants the disease that is caused by the virus will develop. Thus, even if no clear signs of a hypersensitive response (HR) will be detected, a lack of disease progress will indicate the presence of a resistance mechanism. Of course, such a system will only be feasible with plants that are normally susceptible for the virus that is used as a viral vector.\n\nIdeally, it should be ensured that the Avr4 effector protein or ortholog thereof is excreted to the apoplastic space, because this is the location where the effector protein in nature is found. When the screening method is based on injecting the protein into the plant, the protein automatically will be present in the apoplastic space. If a screening method is applied wherein Avr4 or an ortholog thereof is introduced to a plant by a nucleic acid delivery vehicle having the nucleic acid encoding Avr4 or an ortholog thereof, expression into the apoplastic space can be achieved by providing the nucleotide sequence with a signal sequence for extracellular targeting. Such signal sequences are available for a person skilled in the art and one example is the signal sequence of the tobacco PR- Ia gene. Alternative sequences can be obtained from the Avr4 peptide, the carrot extension gene or from studies on N -terminal signal sequences (Small, I. et al., 2004, Proteomics 4:1581-1590). It is envisaged that both the method for increasing plant resistance and the method for screening plant resistance as described above will be of use when breeding or constructing plants with a fungal resistance based on the presence of the Avr4/ortholog-Cf4/homologue resistance mechanism. Thus, further provided is the use of a method for increasing the resistance of a plant or part thereof to at least one pathogen, wherein said plant is not a tomato or tobacco plant. Even further provided is the use of a method for screening the resistance of a plant or a part thereof to at least one pathogen, said pathogen not being C. fulÏ um, wherein said plant is not a tomato plant.\n\nIn case of a breeding program for the introduction of Avr4/ortholog- Cf4/homologue based resistance, the breeder normally will depart from a plant that contains Cf4 or a functional homologue thereof. This plant line will then be used as a parent line and crossed with another plant to generate offspring. This offspring can be tested on the presence of the resistance mechanism by applying the screening method as described above. This process then will be repeated until the desired end product is obtained. In stead of breeding, it will also be possible to engineer the resistance using recombinant techniques. In that case the gene encoding the resistance gene will be cloned into an appropriate vector and a target plant will be transformed with this vector. Functional expression of the resistance gene can then be assessed by applying a screening method wherein the plant is provided with the Avr4 effector protein or an ortholog thereof.\n\nNext to utilizing existing traits of resistance from Solarium or Nicotiana species in molecular resistance breeding programs in order to achieve broad spectrum resistance, in monocot and dicot hosts species attacked by Dothideomycete fungal pathogens except C. fulÏ um, that produce functional homologues of C. fulÏ um Avr4 effector, it will be clear that the invention can also be extended to the identification of new resistance traits in banana, sugar beet, tobacco, maize, and celery by virus-based expression vectors expressing Avr4 homologues of the above mentioned fungi.\n\nSeveral promoters have been isolated that can direct strong near- constitutive expression in monocot and/or dicot plants, including the maize ubiquitin promoter (Christensen et al. 1996), the rice actinl promoter (McElroy et al. 1990), various enhanced cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoters (Mitsuhara et al. 1996, Kay et al. 1987, Vai et al. 1996), the sugarcane bacilliform badnavirus (ScBV) (Schenk et al. 1999), the synthetic pEmu promoter (Last et al. 1991), the banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) (Hermann et al. 2001), the cassava vein mosaic virus (CVMV) (Verdaguer et al. 1996), and others (SchÏnmann et al. 2003) that can be used in these methods as well. The invention is exemplified by the following example. This example is intended to illustrate the invention, without limiting the scope thereof in any way.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nDNA manipulations were carried out by standard protocols (Sambrook et al. 1989). PCRs were performed with SuperTbg (HT Biotechnology Ltd) or Pfu (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Restriction enzymes, T4 ligase, and Escherichia coli DH5Î± cells were from Life Technologies (Breda, The Netherlands). Primers were synthesized by Sigma-Aldrich. Tomato and Nicotiana benthamiana plants were grown under standard greenhouse conditions. For PVX inoculations four-week- old Money Maker (MM)-CfO (no known Cf resistance genes) and MM-Cf4 (carrying the Cf- 4 resistance gene) tomato lines were used, while for agroinfiltrations six to eight-week-old N. benthamiana plants were used. Authenticity of all generated constructs was confirmed by sequencing at Macrogen Inc.\n\nHeterologous production of HisÎ²-FLAG-tagged MfAvr4 in Pichia pastoris\n\nPlasmids for the expression of an N-terminal HisÎ²-FLAG-tagged MfA vr4 protein in the methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris were generated as described before (Rooney et al. 2005). In brief, vector pPIC-9 (Invitrogen) was modified by inserting a cassette, containing a DNA fragment encoding for the HisÎ²-tag, while the Smal, Apal, and SÎ±cII restriction sites were introduced for cloning purposes, resulting in vector pPIC-9His. To create HisÎ²-FLAG-tagged MfA vr4, the ORF of MfAÏ r4 encoding for the mature MfA vr4 protein without the signal peptide sequence and after intron removal was amplified from cDNA of the fungus using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and primers Avr4F_pichia_FLAGtagged\n\n(gactacaaggacgacgatgacaagGCAACGATGCAG GTGCGAAC; primer is phosphorylated at its 5' end) and Avr4R_pchia+EcoRIsite\n\n(TCAGAATTCTTACAGTTGTCGCATCC). Subsequently, the amplified product was cloned into pPIC-9His with the Smal and EcoRI restriction sites. The plasmid was then introduced into P. pastoris strain GSl 15 (Invitrogen) by electroporation and transformants were grown on YPD plates. All the media used for growth of P. pastoris, i.e. MD, YPD, and BMMY, were made following the manufacturers' instructions (Invitrogen). To verify that the MfAvr4 was successfully cloned in frame into the AOXl locus and that there were no PCR-introduced mistakes in the coding sequence, automated DNA sequencing (Macrogen Inc.) was performed on the re-isolated plasmids from cultures of the obtained P. pastoris transformants using the AOXR (GCAAATGGCATTCTGACATCC) and AOXF (GACTGGTTCCAATTGACAAGC) priming sites present in pPIC-9. High cell density fermentation of P. pastoris transformants for large-scale MfA vr4 production was performed according to the procedure described by Stratton et al. (1998). In brief, starter cultures of 50 mL were grown for 2 days at 300C (OD600 > 10), and were used to inoculate a 2 L vessel containing 900 mL FM22 medium. Starter cultures originated from a fresh colony grown on a MD or YPD plate. After autoclaving, the pH was adjusted to 4.9 with 5.0 M KOH or 25% (w/v) NH4OH. Agitation was kept at 1200 rpm, and the airflow was maintained at 1â2 vvm to keep the dissolved oxygen (DO) levels at least above 30%. If needed, excessive foaming was prevented by adding a few droplets of Antifoam 289 (Sigma). Approximately 20 h after inoculation, glycerol depletion was observed by a sharp increase of the DO. At this stage the glycerol-feed was started at a rate of 10 mL -L-I -h-1 (glycerol fed-batch phase), and properly adjusted to maintain a steady DO reading (near 35%). After 4 h, the methanol feed was started at a rate of 3.4mL L-I -h-1. The methanol feed rate was stepwise increased to 6 mL -L-I -hâ 1 as soon as the culture had fully adapted to growth on methanol (4-6 h). To prevent methanol accumulation a DO spike was performed (a sharp increase in the DO levels has to occur after a halt of the methanol supply; Stratton et al., 1998).\n\nChitin-binding assays We examined whether MfA vr4 has specific affinity for chitin and no insoluble polysaccharides other than chitin, using an affinity precipitation assay (Van den Burg et al. 2006). In parallel, we included Avr4 from C. fulÏ um in these experiments as a positive control (data not shown). HisÎ²- FLAG-tagged MfA vr4 protein was obtained from crude culture filtrates of P. pastoris transformants after fermentation and binding was examined as previously described (Van den Burg et al. 2006). Briefly, MfA vr4 (100 Î¼L of P. pastoris culture filtrate) was incubated with ~10 mg/mL insoluble polysaccharides (crab shell chitin, chitin- agarose resin, chitosan, cellulose, and xylan; all Sigma, except for the resin: New England Biolabs) in 1.8 mL binding buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris.HCl pH8, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 x protease inhibitor. The polysaccharide fractions had been pre-equilibrated in the binding buffer. After two hrs of gentle rocking (15 rpm) at ambient temperature, the insoluble fraction was pelleted by centrifugation (3 min, 13,000xg) and the supernatant was collected. The protein fraction in the recovered supernatant was precipitated adding 10% final concentration (w/v) TCA (trichloroacetic acid) and incubated for lhr on ice. After centrifugation (16,000xg for 30 min), the protein pellet was washed in - 200C 80% acetone (v/v) and re-dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 100 mM DTT, 10OmM Tris.HCl pH6.8) by boiling. The insoluble polysaccharides were three times washed in binding buffer. The bound protein fraction was eluted from the insoluble polysaccharides by boiling for 10 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Equal amounts of the supernatant protein fraction and the bound protein fraction were loaded and separated on standard 20% SDS-PAGE and MfA vr4 was detected by immunoblotting using an anti-Flag monoclonal antibody (M2, Sigma).\n\nAgroinfiltration assays.\n\nTransient co-expression of MfAvr4 with Cf -4 or other genes of interest, through infiltration of Agrobacterium cultures into leaf tissue of the model plant N. benthamiana was made as follows. For in planta expression of MfAvr4 cDNA, the sequence encoding the signal peptide for extracellular targeting of the encoded MfA vr4 was replaced by that of the extracellular protein PR- Ia of tobacco (Hammond-Kosack et al. 1994; Hammond- Kosack et al. 1995; Honee et al. 1998; Joosten et al. 1997). First, PR-la was amplified using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) with primers PRIa-F\n\n(GGCCATGGGATTTGTTCTCTTTTCAC) and PRIa-R\n\n(ATTTTGGGCACGGCAAGAG). The ORF of MfAvr4 encoding for the mature MfA vr4 protein without its original signal peptide sequence and after intron removal (MfAvr4mature) was amplified from cDNA of the fungus using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). Primers used for\n\nMfAvr4mature amplification were PRla_MfAvr4-F\n\n(CTTGCCGTGCCCAAAA rGCTGGAACGATGCAGGTGCG), introducing at the 5' end of the amplified product 17bps that were complementary to the 3' end of the PR- Ia sequence (in Italics and underlined) and MfAvr4-R (GGCTCGAGTTACACGTTGTCGCATCCTG), introducing at the 3' end of the amplified product an Xhol site (in Italics and underlined). The fused PR-la:MfAvr4 mature product was generated by an overlap extension PCR using SuperTbg polymerase (HT Biotechnology Ltd) and was subsequently cloned into the pGEMÂ®-T Easy Vector (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions (construct pHBl). Authenticity of the fusion product was examined by custom DNA sequencing (Macrogen Inc.), using the standard pUC/M13 Forward and Reverse Sequencing Primer binding sites present in the pGEMÂ®-T Easy Vector. The fused PR- la:MfAvr4 mature product was then excised from pHBl with an Ncol and Xhol digest and inserted between the 35S promoter and the PI-II terminator in a likewise digested pRH80 vector (An et al. 1989, Van der Hoorn et al. 2000) (construct pHB2). Finally, the 35S::PR- la:MfAvr4mature::PI-II cassette was excised from pHB2 and subsequently transferred into the binary plasmid pMOG800 (Honee et al. 1998, Van der Hoorn et al. 2000), with the use of Xbal and EcoRl restriction sites (construct pMfAvr4). This final pMfAvr4 construct was transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV301 by electroporation using standard procedures (Hood et al. 1993). Agroinfiltration of N. benthamiana plants was performed as described previously (Van der Hoorn et al. 2000). Constructs of the tomato resistance genes Cf -4 (pCf4) and Cf -9 (pCf9), and the C. fulvum effectors Avr4 (pAvr4) and Avr9 (pAvr9) in the binary expression vector pMOG800, were constructed as described for pMfAvr4 and were already available in the lab (Van der Hoorn et al. 2000).\n\nPVX-mediated in planta expression ofMfAvr4\n\npSfinx (Takken et al. 2000), a binary vector that facilitates the expression of pathogen cDNAs under the control of the potato virus X (PVX) coat protein promoter, was used as a backbone for all PVX expression constructs used in this study. From left to right border, the T-DNA of this vector consists of a CaMV 35S promoter- driven PVX sequence containing the replicase gene, the triple gene block, the duplicated coat protein promoter, and the coat protein genes. The multiple cloning site of pSfinx for directed insertion of pathogen cDNAs (e.g. Avr genes) is located directly downstream of the duplicated coat protein promoter. pSfinx facilitates transfer of the expression construct to the plant cells by A.\n\ntumefaciens, while subsequent virus replication results in expression of the pathogen cDNA that can trigger an HR if the cDNA encodes an avirulence protein that is recognized by a cognate R gene in the plant.\n\nPlasmid pMfAvr4 described above, was used to amplify the fusion product PR-la:MfAvr4mature with primers MfAvr4-F\n\n(GGCCCGGGGCTGGACGATGCAGGTGCG) and MfAvr4-R\n\n(GGCTCGAGTTACACGTTGTCGCATCCTG) that introduce an Xmal at 5' end and a Xhol site at the 3' end of the PR-la:MfAvr4mature amplified product, respectively. PCRs were performed using SuperTbg polymerase (HT Biotechnology Ltd) and the product was subsequently cloned into the pGEMÂ®-T Easy Vector (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions (construct pHB4). The PR-la:MfAvr4mature cassette was then excised from pHB4 with Xmal and Xhol and ligated into a likewise digested pSfinx vector, resulting in the final construct PVX::PRlaMÂ£4Î¹>r4. The authenticity of the final construct was examined by custom DNA sequencing at Macrogen Inc. using primers OXlO (5'- CAATCACAGTGTTGGCTTGC-3') and N31 (5T-\n\nGACCCTATGGGCTGTGTTG-3') that flank the cDNA insert in the PVX backbone. The final PVX::PRlaMÂ£4Î¹>r4 construct was then transformed into A. tumefaciens strain GV301 by electroporation using standard procedures (Hood et al. 1993). Finally, transformants were cultured on plates containing modified LB medium (10 g 1_1 bacto-peptone; 5 g 1_1 yeast extract; 2.5 g 1_1 NaCl; 10 g 1_1 mannitol) for 48 h at 28Â°C and, subsequently, colonies were selected and inoculated on four-week-old tomato MM-CfO and MM-Cf4 tomato plants by toothpick inoculation\n\n(Hammond-Kosack et al. 1995). Systemic HR symptoms were recorded 10â 14 days after inoculation (Fig. 6). As controls, PVX containing the empty pSfinx vector (PVX::pSfinx) and the C. fulvum Avr4 in a binary vector (PVX::PRlaAur4) were used. The later construct was already available in our lab (Joosten et al. 1997).\n\nEEFEEENCES\n\nAn G, Mitra A, Choi HK, Costa M.A, An K, Thornburg EW, Eyan CM. 1989.
