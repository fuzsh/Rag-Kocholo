This review summarizes our current knowledge on the pathogen, from taxonomic issues to specific life traits. It mainly illustrates the importance of formal genetics approaches on the pathogen side to dissect the interaction with the host plants. In addition, this review presents the main current research topics on L. maculans and focuses on the L. maculans genome initiative recently begun, including its main research issues. Leptosphaeria maculans (Desm.) Ces. & de Not. (anamorph Phoma lingam Tode ex Fr.). Kingdom Fungi, Phylum Ascomycota, Class Dothideomycetes (Loculoascomycetes), Order Pleosporales, Genus Leptosphaeria, Species maculans. cultivated Brassicas such as Brassica napus (oilseed rape, canola), B. rapa, B. juncea, B. oleracea, etc., along with numerous wild crucifers species. Arabidopsis thaliana was recently reported to be a potential host for L. maculans. Primary disease symptoms are greyish-green collapse of cotyledon or leaf tissue, without a visible margin, bearing tiny black spots (pycnidia). The fungus then develops an endophytic symptomless growth for many months. Secondary symptoms, at the end of the growing season, are dry necroses of the crown tissues with occasional blackening (stem canker or blackleg) causing lodging of the plants. Pseudothecia differentiate on leftover residues. Seedling damping-off and premature ripening are also reported under certain environmental conditions.

The species concept is based on phenotypic (morphology and extrolite profiles) and molecular (Î²-tubulin and calmodulin gene sequences) characters in a polyphasic approach. Four new taxa are proposed: N. australensis N. ferenczii, N. papuaensis and N. warcupii. All newly described and accepted species are illustrated. The section consists of 33 taxa: 10 strictly anamorphic Aspergillus species and 23 Neosartorya species. Four other Neosartorya species described previously were not available for this monograph, and consequently are relegated to the category of doubtful species.

In search of a robust and universal forecast model, the ascospore concentration in air was measured and weather data recorded from 1 March to 31 October between 2006 and 2012. The experiment was conducted in three European countries of the temperate climate, i.e., Ukraine, Poland, and the UK. Out of over 150 forecast models produced using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and multivariate regression trees (MRTs), we selected the best model for each site, as well as for joint two-site combinations. The performance of all computed models was tested against records from 1 year which had not been used for model construction. The statistical analysis of the fungal spore data was supported by a comprehensive study of both climate and land cover within a 30-km radius from the air sampler location. High-performance forecasting models were obtained for individual sites, showing that the local micro-climate plays a decisive role in biology of the fungi. Based on the previous epidemiological studies, we hypothesized that dew point temperature (DPT) would be a critical factor in the models. The impact of DPT was confirmed only by one of the final best neural models, but the MRT analyses, similarly to the Spearman's rank test, indicated the importance of DPT in all but one of the studied cases and in half of them ranked it as a fundamental factor.

They share identical D1/D2 LSU rRNA gene sequences with the type strain of C. pignaliae, and the physiological characteristics investigated are also very similar to that of the type strain. The only substantial difference compared to the type strain of C. pignaliae is their ability to assimilate Î²-glucosides (cellobiose, salicin and arbutin). The majority of the isolation sources of the strains reported in this study have the common feature of containing tannic acid, while the type strain of C. pignaliae was recovered from tanning fluid. We were able to induce ascosporulation also in the type strain of C. pignaliae. Therefore, Ogataea pignaliae PÃ©ter, Tornai-Lehoczki & Dlauchy sp. nov. is proposed as the teleomorph of C. pignaliae (F. H. Jacob) S. A. Meyer & Yarrow. The type strain is CBS 6071(T).\n\nIsobenzofuranones and Isochromenones from the Deep-Sea Derived Fungus Leptosphaeria sp.

SCSIO 41005, together with four known isobenzofuranones (5â8) and six known isochromenones (11â16). These structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analyses, and absolute configurations were assigned on the basis of electronic circular dichroism and optical rotations data comparison. Additionally, the absolute configurations of the new compounds 1 and 9, together with the known one 7 with stereochemistry undetermined, were further confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction experiments. A plausible biosynthetic pathway of these isobenzofuranones and isochromenones was also proposed.

Several genome-wide significant associations were detected at known and new loci for blackleg resistance. We further validated statistically significant associations in four genetic mapping populations, demonstrating that GWAS marker loci are indeed associated with resistance to L. maculans. One of the novel loci identified for the first time, Rlm12, conveys adult plant resistance in canola.â Blackleg, caused by Leptosphaeria maculans, is a significant disease which affects the sustainable production of canola (Brassica napus). This study reports a genome-wide association study based on 18,804 polymorphic SNPs to identify loci associated with qualitative and quantitative resistance to L. maculans. Genomic regions delimited with 694 significant SNP markers, that are associated with resistance evaluated using 12 single spore isolates and pathotypes from four canola stubble were identified. Several significant associations were detected at known disease resistance loci including in the vicinity of recently cloned Rlm2/LepR3 genes, and at new loci on chromosomes A01/C01, A02/C02, A03/C03, A05/C05, A06, A08, and A09. In addition, we validated statistically significant associations on A01, A07, and A10 in four genetic mapping populations, demonstrating that GWAS marker loci are indeed associated with resistance to L. maculans. One of the novel loci identified for the first time, Rlm12, conveys adult plant resistance and mapped within 13.2 kb from Arabidopsis R gene of TIR-NBS class. We showed that resistance loci are located in the vicinity of R genes of Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica napus on the sequenced genome of B. napus cv. Darmor-bzh. Significantly associated SNP markers provide a valuable tool to enrich germplasm for favorable alleles in order to improve the level of resistance to L. maculans in\n\nMelanin biosynthesis in the fungus Curvularia lunata (teleomorph: Cochliobolus lunatus).\n\nPubMed\n\nLanisnik Rizner, Tea; Wheeler, Michael H\n\n2003-02-01\n\nCurvularia lunata (teleomorph: Cochliobolus lunatus) is a known plant and human pathogen. Tricyclazole, a specific inhibitor of pentaketide melanin biosynthesis, blocked the biosynthesis of melanin in Curvularia lunata and caused the accumulation of the melanin metabolites flaviolin and 2-hydroxyjuglone. This showed that melanin in Curvularia lunata is produced by a pentaketide pathway from 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene. The 1,3,8-trihydroxynaphthalene reductase (3HNR) gene, associated with the melanin pathway of Curvularia lunata, was identified and characterized. An alignment of 3HNR sequences enabled the design of primers covering conserved regions. A PCR-amplified fragment of Curvularia lunata genomic DNA was used for screening the cDNA library. Three independent cDNA clones revealed an 801-bp open reading frame encoding a 267 amino acid protein. The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The predicted amino acid sequence of the 28.6-kDa protein demonstrated homology to other fungal 3HNR and other members of the short-chain dehydrogenase super family. Northern analyses revealed that 3HNR from Curvularia lunata is expressed synchronously with melanization after 3 days of Curvularia lunata growth in malt extract medium. No 3HNR reductase gene expression nor melanization was observed when Curvularia lunata was grown in yeast nitrogen base medium.\n\nBlackleg (Leptosphaeria maculans) Severity and Yield Loss in Canola in Alberta, Canada\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHwang, Sheau-Fang; Strelkov, Stephen E.; Peng, Gary; Ahmed, Hafiz; Zhou, Qixing; Turnbull, George\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBlackleg, caused by Leptosphaeria maculans, is an important disease of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) in Canada and throughout the world. Severe epidemics of blackleg can result in significant yield losses. Understanding disease-yield relationships is a prerequisite for measuring the agronomic efficacy and economic benefits of control methods. Field experiments were conducted in 2013, 2014, and 2015 to determine the relationship between blackleg disease severity and yield in a susceptible cultivar and in moderately resistant to resistant canola hybrids. Disease severity was lower, and seed yield was 120%â128% greater, in the moderately resistant to resistant hybrids compared with the susceptible cultivar. Regression analysis showed that pod number and seed yield declined linearly as blackleg severity increased. Seed yield per plant decreased by 1.8 g for each unit increase in disease severity, corresponding to a decline in yield of 17.2% for each unit increase in disease severity. Pyraclostrobin fungicide reduced disease severity in all site-years and increased yield. These results show that the reduction of blackleg in canola crops substantially improves yields.

This phytotoxin belongs to the epipolythiodioxopiperazine (ETP) class of toxins produced by fungi including mammalian and plant pathogens. We report the cloning of a cluster of genes with predicted roles in the biosynthesis of sirodesmin PL and show via gene disruption that one of these genes (encoding a two-module non-ribosomal peptide synthetase) is essential for sirodesmin PL biosynthesis. Of the nine genes in the cluster tested, all are co-regulated with the production of sirodesmin PL in culture. A similar cluster is present in the genome of the opportunistic human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus and is most likely responsible for the production of gliotoxin, which is also an ETP. Homologues of the genes in the cluster were also identified in expressed sequence tags of the ETP producing fungus Chaetomium globosum. Two other fungi with publicly available genome sequences, Magnaporthe grisea and Fusarium graminearum, had similar gene clusters. A comparative analysis of all four clusters is presented. This is the first report of the genes responsible for the biosynthesis of an ETP.

In this report, S.apiospermum infection in a 62 year old male patient with acute myeloid leukemia was presented. During remission-induction chemotherapy, piperacillin-tazobactam therapy was started for febrile neutropenia. Since fever had continued, treatment was switched to imipenem and also amphotericin B deoxycholate was added to the treatment protocol. Because of allergic reaction to amphotericin B, caspofungin was started at the fifth day of neutropenic fever. Following imaging studies with high resolution computerized thorasic tomography, antifungal therapy was changed to voriconazole due to findings suggestive of invasive aspergillosis. Since galactomannan antigen was found negative at the first day of voriconazole therapy, bronchoalveolar lavage material from apical segment of the left lower lobe was cultured onto various microbiologic media. S.apiospermum (Teleomorph: Pseudallescheria apiosperma) was isolated on the fourth day of cultivation. According to CLSI M38-A2 microdilution procedure, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of voriconazole, caspofungin, amphotericin B and posaconazole were found as 0.06, 2, 8 and 4 Âµg/ml, respectively. Since neutropenia was resolved, the patient was discharged with continued voriconazole therapy. It was concluded that antifungal susceptibility tests should be performed for Scedosporium species and the results should be compared to the clinical response. The determination of MIC breakpoints may provide useful information for the recommendation and use of optimal choices for the treatment of Scedosporium infections.\n\nRedisposition of phoma-like anamorphs in Pleosporales\n\nPubMed Central\n\nde Gruyter, J.; Woudenberg, J.H.C.; Aveskamp, M.M.; Verkley, G.J.M.; Groenewald, J.Z.; Crous, P.W.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe anamorphic genus Phoma was subdivided into nine sections based on morphological characters, and included teleomorphs in Didymella, Leptosphaeria, Pleospora and Mycosphaerella, suggesting the polyphyly of the genus. Recent molecular, phylogenetic studies led to the conclusion that Phoma should be restricted to Didymellaceae. The present study focuses on the taxonomy of excluded Phoma species, currently classified in Phoma sections Plenodomus, Heterospora and Pilosa. Species of Leptosphaeria and Phoma section Plenodomus are reclassified in Plenodomus, Subplenodomus gen. nov., Leptosphaeria and Paraleptosphaeria gen. nov., based on the phylogeny determined by analysis of sequence data of the large subunit 28S nrDNA (LSU) and Internal Transcribed Spacer regions 1 & 2 and 5.8S nrDNA (ITS). Phoma heteromorphospora, type species of Phoma section Heterospora, and its allied species Phoma dimorphospora, are transferred to the genus Heterospora stat. nov. The Phoma acuta complex (teleomorph Leptosphaeria doliolum), is revised based on a multilocus sequence analysis of the LSU, ITS, small subunit 18S nrDNA (SSU), Î²-tubulin (TUB), and chitin synthase 1 (CHS-1) regions. Species of Phoma section Pilosa and allied Ascochyta species were determined to belong to Pleosporaceae based on analysis of actin (ACT) sequence data. Anamorphs that are similar morphologically to Phoma and described in Ascochyta, Asteromella, Coniothyrium, Plectophomella, Pleurophoma and Pyrenochaeta are included in this study. Phoma-like species, which grouped outside the Pleosporineae based on a LSU sequence analysis, are transferred to the genera Aposphaeria, Paraconiothyrium and Westerdykella. The genera Medicopsis gen. nov. and Nigrograna gen. nov. are introduced to accommodate the medically important species formerly known as Pyrenochaeta romeroi and Pyrenochaeta mackinnonii, respectively.

RNA-mediated silencing of sirZ gives rise to transformants that produce only residual amounts of sirodesmin PL and display a decrease in the transcription of several sirodesmin PL biosynthetic genes. This indicates that SirZ is a major regulator of this gene cluster. Proteins similar to SirZ are encoded in the gliotoxin biosynthetic gene cluster of Aspergillus fumigatus (gliZ) and in an ETP-like cluster in Penicillium lilacinoechinulatum (PlgliZ). Despite its high level of sequence similarity to gliZ, PlgliZ is unable to complement the gliotoxin-deficiency of a mutant of gliZ in A. fumigatus. Putative binding sites for these regulatory proteins in the promoters of genes in these clusters were predicted using bioinformatic analysis. These sites are similar to those commonly bound by other proteins with Zn(II)2Cys6 DNA binding domains.

Detection of these airborne inocula is important in forecasting both the onset and the risk of epiphytotics. Species-specific primers targeted at the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of Leptosphaeria maculans and L. biglobosa - the causal organisms of phoma stem canker and stem lesions of Brassica spp., including oilseed rape - were used to detect DNA extracted from particles deposited on tapes obtained from a spore trap operated in Rarwino (northwest Poland) from September to November in 2004 and 2006. The quantities of DNA assessed by traditional end-point PCR and quantitative real-time PCR were compared to microscopic counts of airborne ascospores. Results of this study showed that fluctuations in timing of ascospore release corresponded to the dynamics of combined concentrations of DNA from L. maculans and L. biglobosa, with significant positive correlations between ascospore number and DNA yield. Thus the utilization of PCR-based molecular diagnostic techniques enabled the detection, identification, and accurate quantification of airborne inoculum at the species level. Moreover, real-time PCR was more sensitive than traditional PCR, especially in years with low ascospore numbers.\n\nRecent advances in genes involved in secondary metabolite synthesis, hyphal development, energy metabolism and pathogenicity in Fusarium graminearum (teleomorph Gibberella zeae).\n\nPubMed\n\nGeng, Zongyi; Zhu, Wei; Su, Hao; Zhao, Yong; Zhang, Ke-Qin; Yang, Jinkui\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe ascomycete fungus, Fusarium graminearum (teleomorph Gibberella zeae), is the most common causal agent of Fusarium head blight (FHB), a devastating disease for cereal crops worldwide. F. graminearum produces ascospores (sexual spores) and conidia (asexual spores), which can serve as disease inocula of FHB. Meanwhile, Fusarium-infected grains are often contaminated with mycotoxins such as trichothecenes (TRIs), fumonisins, and zearalenones, among which TRIs are related to the pathogenicity of F. graminearum, and these toxins are hazardous to humans and livestock. In recent years, with the complete genome sequencing of F. graminearum, an increasing number of functional genes involved in the production of secondary metabolites, hyphal differentiation, sexual and asexual reproduction, virulence and pathogenicity have been identified from F. graminearum. In this review, the secondary metabolite synthesis, hyphal development and pathogenicity related genes in F. graminearum were thoroughly summarized, and the genes associated with secondary metabolites, sexual reproduction, energy metabolism, and pathogenicity were highlighted.

Incubation period to the onset of lesion development, number of lesions and lesion diameter were assessed. Symptomless growth of L. maculans from leaf lesions to stems was investigated using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing isolate carrying AvrLm6. L. maculans produced large grey lesions on Darmor (lacking Rlm6) at 5-25 degrees C and DarmorMX (carrying Rlm6) at 25 degrees C, but small dark spots and 'green islands' on DarmorMX at 5-20 degrees C. With increasing temperature/wetness duration, numbers of lesions/spots generally increased. GFP-expressing L. maculans grew from leaf lesions down leaf petioles to stems on DarmorMX at 25 degrees C but not at 15 degrees C. We conclude that temperature and leaf wetness duration affect the phenotypic expression of Rlm6-mediated resistance in leaves and subsequent L. maculans spread down petioles to produce stem cankers.\n\nGenetic Variability and Distribution of Mating Type Alleles in Field Populations of Leptosphaeria maculans from France\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGout, Lilian; Eckert, Maria; Rouxel, Thierry; Balesdent, Marie-HÃ©lÃ¨ne\n\n2006-01-01\n\nLeptosphaeria maculans is the most ubiquitous fungal pathogen of Brassica crops and causes the devastating stem canker disease of oilseed rape worldwide. We used minisatellite markers to determine the genetic structure of L. maculans in four field populations from France. Isolates were collected at three different spatial scales (leaf, 2-m2 field plot, and field) enabling the evaluation of spatial distribution of the mating type alleles and of genetic variability within and among field populations. Within each field population, no gametic disequilibrium between the minisatellite loci was detected and the mating type alleles were present at equal frequencies. Both sexual and asexual reproduction occur in the field, but the genetic structure of these populations is consistent with annual cycles of randomly mating sexual reproduction. All L. maculans field populations had a high level of gene diversity (H = 0.68 to 0.75) and genotypic diversity. Within each field population, the number of genotypes often was very close to the number of isolates. Analysis of molecular variance indicated that >99.5% of the total genetic variability was distributed at a small spatial scale, i.e., within 2-m2 field plots. Population differentiation among the four field populations was low (GST < 0.02), suggesting a high degree of gene exchange between these populations. The high gene flow evidenced here in French populations of L. maculans suggests a rapid countrywide diffusion of novel virulence alleles whenever novel resistance sources are used.

This gene encodes isocitrate lyase, a component of the glyoxylate cycle, and is essential for the successful colonization of B. napus. It was identified by a reverse genetics approach whereby a plasmid conferring hygromycin resistance was inserted randomly into the L. maculans genome. Twelve of 516 transformants tested had reduced pathogenicity on cotyledons of B. juncea and B. napus, and 1 of these 12 had a deletion of the isocitrate lyase gene, as well as an insertion of the hygromycin resistance gene. This mutant was unable to grow on fatty acids, including monolaurate, and the isocitrate lyase transcript was not detected. When the wild-type gene was reintroduced into the mutant, growth on monolaurate was restored and pathogenicity was partially restored. L. maculans isocitrate lyase is produced during infection of B. napus cotyledons, while the plant homologue is not. When 2.5% glucose was added to the inoculum of the isocitrate lyase mutant, lesions of sizes similar to those caused by wild-type isolate M1 developed on B. napus cotyledons. These findings suggest that the glyoxylate pathway is essential for disease development by this plant-pathogenic fungus, as has been shown recently for a fungal and bacterial pathogen of animals and a bacterial pathogen of plants. Involvement of the glyoxylate pathway in pathogenesis in animals and plants presents potential drug targets for control of diseases.

Not only plants but also diverse microorganisms are able to produce phytohormones, including CKs, though knowledge concerning their biosynthesis and metabolism is still limited. In this work we demonstrate that the fungus Leptosphaeria maculans, a hemi-biotrophic pathogen of oilseed rape (Brassica napus), causing one of the most damaging diseases of this crop, is able to modify the CK profile in infected B. napus tissues, as well as produce a wide range of CKs in vitro, with the cis-zeatin derivatives predominating. The endogenous CK spectrum of L. maculans in vitro consists mainly of free CK bases, as opposed to plants, where other CK forms are mostly more abundant. Using functional genomics, enzymatic and feeding assays with CK bases supplied to culture media, we show that L. maculans contains a functional: (i) isopentenyltransferase (IPT) involved in cZ production; (ii) adenosine kinase (AK) involved in phosphorylation of CK ribosides to nucleotides; and (iii) CK-degradation enzyme cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX). Our data further indicate the presence of cisâtrans isomerase, zeatin O-glucosyltransferase(s) and N6-(Î2-isopentenyl)adenine hydroxylating enzyme. Besides, we report on a crucial role of LmAK for L. maculans fitness and virulence. Altogether, in this study we characterize in detail the CK metabolism of the filamentous fungi L. maculans and report its two novel components, the CKX and CK-related AK activities, according to our knowledge for the first time in the fungal kingdom. Based on these findings, we propose a model illustrating CK metabolism pathways in L. maculans.

SSP-encoding genes are often located in particular genomic environments and show waves of concerted expression at diverse stages of plant infection. To date, little is known about the regulation of their expression. The genome of the Ascomycete Leptosphaeria maculans comprises alternating gene-rich GC-isochores and gene-poor AT-isochores. The AT-isochores harbor mosaics of transposable elements, encompassing one-third of the genome, and are enriched in putative effector genes that present similar expression patterns, namely no expression or low-level expression during axenic cultures compared to strong induction of expression during primary infection of oilseed rape (Brassica napus). Here, we investigated the involvement of one specific histone modification, histone H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me3), in epigenetic regulation of concerted effector gene expression in L. maculans. For this purpose, we silenced the expression of two key players in heterochromatin assembly and maintenance, HP1 and DIM-5 by RNAi. By using HP1-GFP as a heterochromatin marker, we observed that almost no chromatin condensation is visible in strains in which LmDIM5 was silenced by RNAi. By whole genome oligoarrays we observed overexpression of 369 or 390 genes, respectively, in the silenced-LmHP1 and -LmDIM5 transformants during growth in axenic culture, clearly favouring expression of SSP-encoding genes within AT-isochores. The ectopic integration of four effector genes in GC-isochores led to their overexpression during growth in axenic culture. These data strongly suggest that epigenetic control, mediated by HP1 and DIM-5, represses the expression of at least part of the effector genes located in AT-isochores during growth in axenic culture. Our hypothesis is that changes of lifestyle and a switch toward pathogenesis lift chromatin\n\nDescription of Hyphopichia buzzinii f.a., sp. nov. and Hyphopichia homilentoma comb. nov., the teleomorph of Candida homilentoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nRibeiro, Lucas R; Santos, Ana R O; Groenewald, Marizeth; Smith, Maudy Th H; Lara, Carla A; GÃ³es-Neto, AristÃ³teles; Jacques, NoÃ©mie; Grondin, CÃ©cile; Casaregola, Serge; Lachance, Marc-AndrÃ©; Rosa, Carlos A\n\n2017-07-01\n\nDuring studies of the yeast diversity associated with rotting wood in Brazil and fruits, plants and insects in French Guiana, three strains of a new species were isolated. Analysis of the sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-5.8S and D1/D2 domains of the large subunit of the rRNA gene showed that this species belongs to the genus Hyphopichia and its closest relative is Candida homilentoma. These species differ by 44 nucleotide substitutions in D1/D2 sequences. A new species Hyphopichia buzzinii f. a., sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate these isolates. The type strain of Hyphopichia buzzinii sp. nov. is CLIB 1739 T (=CBS 14300 T Â =Â UFMG-CM-Y6121 T ; MycoBank number is MB 815609). In addition, we isolated 11 strains of C. homilentoma from rotting wood, leaf surfaces, and water bodies in Brazil, and these strains when crossed among one another and with the type strain (CBS 6312 T ) of this species, produced hat-shaped ascospores typical of the genus Hyphopichia. We describe the teleomorph of C. homilentoma as a new combination, Hyphopichia homilentoma comb. nov. (type strain CBS 6312 T ; MycoBank number is MB 820009). We also propose to transfer the other six Candida species of the Hyphopichia clade to this genus as new combinations. Hyphopichia homilentoma produced ethanol and xylitol from D-xylose whereas H. buzzinii was only able to convert this pentose to xylitol.\n\nAssessing Quantitative Resistance against Leptosphaeria maculans (Phoma Stem Canker) in Brassica napus (Oilseed Rape) in Young Plants\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHuang, Yong-Ju; Qi, Aiming; King, Graham J.; Fitt, Bruce D. L.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nQuantitative resistance against Leptosphaeria maculans in Brassica napus is difficult to assess in young plants due to the long period of symptomless growth of the pathogen from the appearance of leaf lesions to the appearance of canker symptoms on the stem. By using doubled haploid (DH) lines A30 (susceptible) and C119 (with quantitative resistance), quantitative resistance against L. maculans was assessed in young plants in controlled environments at two stages: stage 1, growth of the pathogen along leaf veins/petioles towards the stem by leaf lamina inoculation; stage 2, growth in stem tissues to produce stem canker symptoms by leaf petiole inoculation. Two types of inoculum (ascospores; conidia) and three assessment methods (extent of visible necrosis; symptomless pathogen growth visualised using the GFP reporter gene; amount of pathogen DNA quantified by PCR) were used. In stage 1 assessments, significant differences were observed between lines A30 and C119 in area of leaf lesions, distance grown along veins/petioles assessed by visible necrosis or by viewing GFP and amount of L. maculans DNA in leaf petioles. In stage 2 assessments, significant differences were observed between lines A30 and C119 in severity of stem canker and amount of L. maculans DNA in stem tissues. GFP-labelled L. maculans spread more quickly from the stem cortex to the stem pith in A30 than in C119. Stem canker symptoms were produced more rapidly by using ascospore inoculum than by using conidial inoculum. These results suggest that quantitative resistance against L. maculans in B. napus can be assessed in young plants in controlled conditions. Development of methods to phenotype quantitative resistance against plant pathogens in young plants in controlled environments will help identification of stable quantitative resistance for control of crop diseases.

For functional annotation of unknown or hypothetical genes, the production of collections of mutants using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) associated with genotyping and phenotyping has gained wide acceptance. ATMT is also widely used to identify pathogenicity determinants in pathogenic fungi. A systematic analysis of T-DNA borders was performed in an ATMT-mutagenized collection of the phytopathogenic fungus Leptosphaeria maculans to evaluate the features of T-DNA integration in its particular transposable element-rich compartmentalized genome. A total of 318 T-DNA tags were recovered and analyzed for biases in chromosome and genic compartments, existence of CG/AT skews at the insertion site, and occurrence of microhomologies between the T-DNA left border (LB) and the target sequence. Functional annotation of targeted genes was done using the Gene Ontology annotation. The T-DNA integration mainly targeted gene-rich, transcriptionally active regions, and it favored biological processes consistent with the physiological status of a germinating spore. T-DNA integration was strongly biased toward regulatory regions, and mainly promoters. Consistent with the T-DNA intranuclear-targeting model, the density of T-DNA insertion correlated with CG skew near the transcription initiation site. The existence of microhomologies between promoter sequences and the T-DNA LB flanking sequence was also consistent with T-DNA integration to host DNA mediated by homologous recombination based on the microhomology-mediated end-joining pathway.\n\nEvolution of Linked Avirulence Effectors in Leptosphaeria maculans Is Affected by Genomic Environment and Exposure to Resistance Genes in Host Plants\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVan de Wouw, Angela P.; Cozijnsen, Anton J.; Hane, James K.; Brunner, Patrick C.; McDonald, Bruce A.; Oliver, Richard P.; Howlett, Barbara J.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBrassica napus (canola) cultivars and isolates of the blackleg fungus, Leptosphaeria maculans interact in a âgene for geneâ manner whereby plant resistance (R) genes are complementary to pathogen avirulence (Avr) genes. Avirulence genes encode proteins that belong to a class of pathogen molecules known as effectors, which includes small secreted proteins that play a role in disease. In Australia in 2003 canola cultivars with the Rlm1 resistance gene suffered a breakdown of disease resistance, resulting in severe yield losses. This was associated with a large increase in the frequency of virulence alleles of the complementary avirulence gene, AvrLm1, in fungal populations. Surprisingly, the frequency of virulence alleles of AvrLm6 (complementary to Rlm6) also increased dramatically, even though the cultivars did not contain Rlm6. In the L. maculans genome, AvrLm1 and AvrLm6 are linked along with five other genes in a region interspersed with transposable elements that have been degenerated by Repeat-Induced Point (RIP) mutations. Analyses of 295 Australian isolates showed deletions, RIP mutations and/or non-RIP derived amino acid substitutions in the predicted proteins encoded by these seven genes. The degree of RIP mutations within single copy sequences in this region was proportional to their proximity to the degenerated transposable elements. The RIP alleles were monophyletic and were present only in isolates collected after resistance conferred by Rlm1 broke down, whereas deletion alleles belonged to several polyphyletic lineages and were present before and after the resistance breakdown. Thus, genomic environment and exposure to resistance genes in B. napus has affected the evolution of these linked avirulence genes in L. maculans.

In a new study, two scientists examine whether Sun-like stars or low-mass M dwarfs are the best bet for hosting exoplanets with detectable life.Ambiguity of HabitabilityThe habitable zones of cool M-dwarf stars lie much closer in than for Sun-like stars, placing habitable-zone planets around M dwarfs at greater risk of being affected by space weather.Most exoplanet scientists will freely admit frustration with the term habitability its a word that has many different meanings and is easily misinterpreted when it appears in news articles. Just because a planet lies in a stars habitable zone, for instance, doesnt mean its necessarily capable of supporting life.This ambiguity, argue authors Manasvi Lingam and Abraham Loeb (Harvard University and Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics), requires us to take a strategic approach when pursuing the search for primitive life outside of our solar system. In particular, we risk losing the enthusiasm and support of the public (and funding sources!) when wefocus on the general search for planets in stellar habitable zones, rather than specifically searching for the planets most likely to have detectable signatures of life.Illustration of the difference between a Sun-like star and a lower-mass, cooler M-dwarf star. [NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center/S. Wiessinger]Weighing Two TargetsSo how do we determine where best to look for planets with detectable biosignatures? To figure out which stars make the optimal targets, Lingam and Loeb suggest an approach based on standard cost-benefit analyses common in economics. Here, whats being balanced is the cost of an exoplanet survey mission against the benefit of different types of stellar targets.In particular, Lingam and Loeb weigh the benefit of targeting solar-type stars against that of targeting stars of any other mass (such as low-mass M-dwarfs, popular targets of many current\n\nGenome Wide Identification of the Immunophilin Gene Family in Leptosphaeria maculans: A Causal Agent of Blackleg Disease in Oilseed Rape (Brassica napus)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZouhar, Miloslav; Mazakova, Jana; Rysanek, Pavel\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAbstract Phoma stem canker (blackleg) is a disease of world-wide importance on oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and can cause serious losses for crops globally. The disease is caused by dothideomycetous fungus, Leptosphaeria maculans, which is highly virulent/aggressive. Cyclophilins (CYPs) and FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs) are ubiquitous proteins belonging to the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) family. They are collectively referred to as immunophilins (IMMs). In the present study, IMM genes, CYP and FKBP in haploid strain v23.1.3 of L. maculans genome, were identified and classified. Twelve CYPs and five FKBPs were determined in total. Domain architecture analysis revealed the presence of a conserved cyclophilin-like domain (CLD) in the case of CYPs and FKBP_C in the case of FKBPs. Interestingly, IMMs in L. maculans also subgrouped into single domain (SD) and multidomain (MD) proteins. They were primarily found to be localized in cytoplasm, nuclei, and mitochondria. Homologous and orthologous gene pairs were also determined by comparison with the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Remarkably, IMMs of L. maculans contain shorter introns in comparison to exons. Moreover, CYPs, in contrast with FKBPs, contain few exons. However, two CYPs were determined as being intronless. The expression profile of IMMs in both mycelium and infected primary leaves of B. napus demonstrated their potential role during infection. Secondary structure analysis revealed the presence of atypical eight Î² strands and two Î± helices fold architecture. Gene ontology analysis of IMMs predicted their significant role in protein folding and PPIase activity. Taken together, our findings for the first time present new prospects of this highly conserved gene family in phytopathogenic fungus.

To date, the determinants of the late colonization stage are poorly understood; L. maculans may either successfully escape plant defences, leading to stem canker development, or the plant may develop an 'adult-stage' resistance reducing canker incidence. To obtain an insight into these determinants, we performed an RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) pilot project comparing fungal gene expression in infected cotyledons and in symptomless or necrotic stems. Despite the low fraction of fungal material in infected stems, sufficient fungal transcripts were detected and a large number of fungal genes were expressed, thus validating the feasibility of the approach. Our analysis showed that all avirulence genes previously identified are under-expressed during stem colonization compared with cotyledon colonization. A validation RNA-seq experiment was then performed to investigate the expression of candidate effector genes during systemic colonization. Three hundred and seven 'late' effector candidates, under-expressed in the early colonization stage and over-expressed in the infected stems, were identified. Finally, our analysis revealed a link between the regulation of expression of effectors and their genomic location: the 'late' effector candidates, putatively involved in systemic colonization, are located in gene-rich genomic regions, whereas the 'early' effector genes, over-expressed in the early colonization stage, are located in gene-poor regions of the genome.

However, evidence for a role of genes coding for proteins with LRR domains in resistance against extracellular (apoplastic) fungal pathogens is limited. Here, the distribution of genes coding for proteins with eLRR domains but lacking kinase domains was determined for the Brassica napus genome. Predictions of signal peptide and transmembrane regions divided these genes into 184 coding for receptor-like proteins (RLPs) and 121 coding for secreted proteins (SPs). Together with previously annotated NLRs, a total of 720 LRR genes were found. Leptosphaeria maculans-induced expression during a compatible interaction with cultivar Topas differed between RLP, SP and NLR gene families; NLR genes were induced relatively late, during the necrotrophic phase of pathogen colonization. Seven RLP, one SP and two NLR genes were found in Rlm1 and Rlm3/Rlm4/Rlm7/Rlm9 loci for resistance against L. maculans on chromosome A07 of B. napus. One NLR gene at the Rlm9 locus was positively selected, as was the RLP gene on chromosome A10 with LepR3 and Rlm2 alleles conferring resistance against L. maculans races with corresponding effectors AvrLm1 and AvrLm2, respectively. Known loci for resistance against L. maculans (extracellular hemi-biotrophic fungus), Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (necrotrophic fungus) and Plasmodiophora brassicae (intracellular, obligate biotrophic protist) were examined for presence of RLPs, SPs and NLRs in these regions. Whereas loci for resistance against P. brassicae were enriched for NLRs, no such signature was observed for the other pathogens. These findings demonstrate involvement of (i) NLR genes in resistance against the intracellular pathogen P. brassicae and a putative NLR gene in Rlm9-mediated resistance against the extracellular pathogen L. maculans.\n\nLeptosphaeria maculans effector AvrLm4-7 affects salicylic acid (SA) and ethylene (ET) signalling and hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) accumulation in Brassica napus.\n\nPubMed\n\nNovÃ¡kovÃ¡, Miroslava; Å aÅ¡ek, VladimÃ­r; TrdÃ¡, Lucie; KrutinovÃ¡, Hana; Mongin, Thomas; ValentovÃ¡, Olga; Balesdent, Marie-HelEne; Rouxel, Thierry; BurketovÃ¡, Lenka\n\n2016-08-01\n\nTo achieve host colonization, successful pathogens need to overcome plant basal defences. For this, (hemi)biotrophic pathogens secrete effectors that interfere with a range of physiological processes of the host plant. AvrLm4-7 is one of the cloned effectors from the hemibiotrophic fungus Leptosphaeria maculans 'brassicaceae' infecting mainly oilseed rape (Brassica napus). Although its mode of action is still unknown, AvrLm4-7 is strongly involved in L. maculans virulence. Here, we investigated the effect of AvrLm4-7 on plant defence responses in a susceptible cultivar of B. napus. Using two isogenic L. maculans isolates differing in the presence of a functional AvrLm4-7 allele [absence ('a4a7') and presence ('A4A7') of the allele], the plant hormone concentrations, defence-related gene transcription and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation were analysed in infected B. napus cotyledons. Various components of the plant immune system were affected. Infection with the 'A4A7' isolate caused suppression of salicylic acid- and ethylene-dependent signalling, the pathways regulating an effective defence against L. maculans infection. Furthermore, ROS accumulation was decreased in cotyledons infected with the 'A4A7' isolate. Treatment with an antioxidant agent, ascorbic acid, increased the aggressiveness of the 'a4a7' L. maculans isolate, but not that of the 'A4A7' isolate. Together, our results suggest that the increased aggressiveness of the 'A4A7' L. maculans isolate could be caused by defects in ROS-dependent defence and/or linked to suppressed SA and ET signalling. This is the first study to provide insights into the manipulation of B. napus defence responses by an effector of L. maculans.

The result is an extensive revision of taxonomic concepts, typification, and nomenclatural details of many anamorph- and teleomorph-typified genera of the Nectriaceae, most notably Cosmospora and Fusarium. The combined phylogenetic analysis shows that the present concept of Fusarium is not monophyletic and that the genus divides into two large groups, one basal in the family, the other terminal, separated by a large group of species classified in genera such as Calonectria, Neonectria, and Volutella. All accepted genera received high statistical support in the phylogenetic analyses. Preliminary polythetic morphological descriptions are presented for each genus, providing details of perithecia, micro- and/or macro-conidial synanamorphs, cultural characters, and ecological traits. Eight species are included in our restricted concept of Cosmospora, two of which have previously documented teleomorphs and all of which have Acremonium-like microconidial anamorphs. A key is provided to the three anamorphic species recognised in Atractium, which is removed from synonymy with Fusarium and epitypified for two macroconidial synnematous species and one sporodochial species associated with waterlogged wood. Dialonectria is recognised as distinct from Cosmospora and two species with teleomorph, macroconidia and microconidia are accepted, including the new species D. ullevolea. Seven species, one with a known teleomorph, are classified in Fusicolla, formerly considered a synonym of Fusarium including members of the F. aquaeductuum and F. merismoides species complex, with several former varieties raised to species rank.

L.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nUsing cultivar resistance against pathogens is one of the most economical and environmentally friendly methods for control of crop diseases. However, cultivar resistance can be easily rendered ineffective due to changes in pathogen populations or environments. To test the hypothesis that combining R gene-mediated resistance and quantitative resistance (QR) in one cultivar can provide more effective resistance than use of either type of resistance on its own, effectiveness of resistance in eight oilseed rape (Brassica napus) cultivars with different R genes and/or QR against Leptosphaeria maculans (phoma stem canker) was investigated in 13 different environments/sites over three growing seasons (2010/2011, 2011/2012 and 2012/2013). Cultivar Drakkar with no R genes and no QR was used as susceptible control and for sampling L. maculans populations. Isolates of L. maculans were obtained from the 13 sites in 2010/2011 to assess frequencies of avirulent alleles of different effector genes (AvrLm1, AvrLm4 or AvrLm7) corresponding to the resistance genes (Rlm1, Rlm4 or Rlm7) used in the field experiments. Results of field experiments showed that cultivars DK Cabernet (Rlm1 + QR) and Adriana (Rlm4 + QR) had significantly less severe phoma stem canker than cultivars Capitol (Rlm1) and Bilbao (Rlm4), respectively. Results of controlled environment experiments confirmed the presence of Rlm genes and/or QR in these four cultivars. Analysis of L. maculans populations from different sites showed that the mean frequencies of AvrLm1 (10%) and AvrLm4 (41%) were less than that of AvrLm7 (100%), suggesting that Rlm1 and Rlm4 gene-mediated resistances were partially rendered ineffective while Rlm7 resistance was still effective. Cultivar Excel (Rlm7 + QR) had less severe canker than cultivar Roxet (Rlm7), but the difference between them was not significant due to influence of the effective resistance gene Rlm7. For the two cultivars with only QR, Es-Astrid (QR) had less severe stem\n\nSurveys of microfungi in a former industrial area in Duisburg-Nord.\n\nPubMed\n\nFeige, G B; Ale-Agha, N; Dachowski, M; Kricke, R\n\n2002-01-01\n\nOne hundred and forty microfungi (Ascomycetes and Deuteromycetes) were collected in the \"Landschaftspark Duisburg-Nord\" located in North Rhine-Westphalia.

Monitoring the migration of airborne fungi using microscope based spore identification is limited when different species produce very similar spores. In our study, DNA-based monitoring with the use of species-specific probes allowed us to track the aerial movements of two important fungal pathogens of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.), i.e., Leptosphaeria maculans and Leptosphaeria biglobosa, which have identical spore shape and size. The fungi were identified using dual-labelled fluorescent probes that were targeted to a Î²-tubulin gene fragment of either Leptosphaeria species. Spore identification by Real-Time PCR techniques capable of detecting minute amounts of DNA of selected fungal species was combined with back-trajectory analysis, allowing the tracking of past movements of air masses using the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model. Over a study period spanning the previous decade (2006-2015) we investigated two specific events relating to the long distance transport of Leptosphaeria spp. spores to Szczecin in North-West Poland. Based on the above mentioned methods and the results obtained with the additional spore sampler located in nearby Szczecin, and operating at the ground level in an oilseed rape field, we have demonstrated that on both occasions the L. biglobosa spores originated from the Jutland Peninsula. This is the first successful attempt to combine analysis of back-trajectories of air masses with DNA-based identification of economically important pathogens of oilseed rape in Europe. In our studies, the timing of L. biglobosa ascospore dispersal in the air was unlikely to result in the infection of winter oilseed rape grown as a crop plant. However, the fungus could infect other host plants, such as vegetable brassicas, cruciferous weeds, spring rapeseed\n\nScytalidium parasiticum sp. nov., a New Species Parasitizing on Ganoderma boninense Isolated from Oil Palm in Peninsular Malaysia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGoh, Teik Khiang; Marzuki, Nurul Fadhilah; Tung, Hun Jiat; Goh, You Keng; Goh, Kah Joo\n\n2015-01-01\n\nA mycoparasite, Scytalidium parasiticum sp. nov., isolated from the basidiomata of Ganoderma boninense causing basal stem rot of oil palm in Johor, Malaysia, is described and illustrated.

Ten of these are described as new, including teleomorphs for two previously known anamorphic species. In two species the teleomorph has been found in nature and in three others it was obtained in culture; only anamorphs are known for the rest. None of the studied tropical collections belongs to the common temperate species H. rosellus and H. odoratus to which the tropical teleomorphic collections had previously been assigned. Instead, taxa encountered in the tropics are genetically and morphologically distinct from the nine species of Hypomyces/Cladobotryum producing red pigments known from temperate regions. Besides observed host preferences, anamorphs of several species can spread fast on soft ephemeral agaricoid basidiomata but the slower developing teleomorphs are mostly found on polyporoid basidiomata or bark. While a majority of previous records from the tropics involve collections from Central America, this paper also reports the diversity of these fungi in the Paleotropics. Africa appears to hold a variety of taxa as five of the new species include material collected in scattered localities of this mostly unexplored continent. In examining distribution patterns, most of the taxa do not appear to be pantropical. Some species are known only from the Western Hemisphere, while others have a geographic range from southeastern Asia to Africa or Australia. The use of various morphological characters of anamorphs and teleomorphs as well as culture characteristics in species delimitation is evaluated. For detecting genetic segregation, partial sequences of the two largest subunits of the ribosomal polymerase perform the best in terms of providing informative sites and the number of well-supported groups recognised in the phylogenies. These are followed by the sequence data of the translation-elongation factor 1-alpha, while the ribosomal DNA\n\nFungal dimorphism: the switch from hyphae to yeast is a specialized morphogenetic adaptation allowing colonization of a host.\n\nPubMed\n\nBoyce, Kylie J; Andrianopoulos, Alex\n\n2015-11-01\n\nThe ability of pathogenic fungi to switch between a multicellular hyphal and unicellular yeast growth form is a tightly regulated process known as dimorphic switching. Dimorphic switching requires the fungus to sense and respond to the host environment and is essential for pathogenicity. This review will focus on the role of dimorphism in fungi commonly called thermally dimorphic fungi, which switch to a yeast growth form during infection. This group of phylogenetically diverse ascomycetes includes Talaromyces marneffei (recently renamed from Penicillium marneffei), Blastomyces dermatitidis (teleomorph Ajellomyces dermatitidis), Coccidioides species (C. immitis and C. posadasii), Histoplasma capsulatum (teleomorph Ajellomyces capsulatum), Paracoccidioides species (P. brasiliensis and P. lutzii) and Sporothrix schenckii (teleomorph Ophiostoma schenckii). This review will explore both the signalling pathways regulating the morphological transition and the transcriptional responses necessary for intracellular growth. The physiological requirements of yeast cells during infection will also be discussed, highlighting recent advances in the understanding of the role of iron and calcium acquisition during infection.

Z.; Braun, U.; Dijksterhuis, J.; Starink, M.; Hill, C.F.; Zalar, P.; de Hoog, G.S.; Crous, P.W.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe Cladosporium herbarum complex comprises five species for which Davidiella teleomorphs are known. Cladosporium herbarum s. str. (D. tassiana), C. macrocarpum (D. macrocarpa) and C. bruhnei (D. allicina) are distinguishable by having conidia of different width, and by teleomorph characters. Davidiella variabile is introduced as teleomorph of C. variabile, a homothallic species occurring on Spinacia, and D. macrospora is known to be the teleomorph of C. iridis on Iris spp. The C. herbarum complex combines low molecular distance with a high degree of clonal or inbreeding diversity. Entities differ from each other by multilocus sequence data and by phenetic differences, and thus can be interpreted to represent individual taxa. Isolates of the C. herbarum complex that were formerly associated with opportunistic human infections, cluster with C. bruhnei. Several species are newly described from hypersaline water, namely C. ramotenellum, C. tenellum, C. subinflatum, and C. herbaroides. Cladosporium pseudiridis collected from Iris sp. in New Zealand, is also a member of this species complex and shown to be distinct from C. iridis that occurs on this host elsewhere in the world. A further new species from New Zealand is C. sinuosum on Fuchsia excorticata. Cladosporium antarcticum is newly described from a lichen, Caloplaca regalis, collected in Antarctica, and C. subtilissimum from grape berries in the U.S.A., while the new combination C. ossifragi, the oldest valid name of the Cladosporium known from Narthecium in Europe, is proposed. Standard protocols and media are herewith proposed to facilitate future morphological examination of Cladosporium spp. in culture, and neotypes or epitypes are proposed for all species treated.

Probably, the most studied biocontrol agents are species of the genus Hypocrea/Trichoderma. Results Here we report an analysis of the genome sequences of the two biocontrol species Trichoderma atroviride (teleomorph Hypocrea atroviridis) and Trichoderma virens (formerly Gliocladium virens, teleomorph Hypocrea virens), and a comparison with Trichoderma reesei (teleomorph Hypocrea jecorina). These three Trichoderma species display a remarkable conservation of gene order (78 to 96%), and a lack of active mobile elements probably due to repeat-induced point mutation. Several gene families are expanded in the two mycoparasitic species relative to T. reesei or other ascomycetes, and are overrepresented in non-syntenic genome regions. A phylogenetic analysis shows that T. reesei and T. virens are derived relative to T. atroviride. The mycoparasitism-specific genes thus arose in a common Trichoderma ancestor but were subsequently lost in T. reesei. Conclusions The data offer a better understanding of mycoparasitism, and thus enforce the development of improved biocontrol strains for efficient and environmentally friendly protection of plants.

A hybrid endochitinase gene under a constitutive promoter was introduced by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation into a winter-type oilseed rape (Brassica napus var. oleifera) inbred line. Progeny from transformed plants was challenged using three different fungal pathogens (Cylindrosporium concentricum, Phoma lingam, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum) in field trials at two different geographical locations. These plants exhibited an increased tolerance to disease as compared with the nontransgenic parental plants. 31 refs., 1 fig., 2 tabs.\n\nComparative genome sequence analysis underscores mycoparasitism as the ancestral life style of Trichoderma.\n\nPubMed\n\nKubicek, Christian P; Herrera-Estrella, Alfredo; Seidl-Seiboth, Verena; Martinez, Diego A; Druzhinina, Irina S; Thon, Michael; Zeilinger, Susanne; Casas-Flores, Sergio; Horwitz, Benjamin A; Mukherjee, Prasun K; Mukherjee, Mala; Kredics, LÃ¡szlÃ³; Alcaraz, Luis D; Aerts, Andrea; Antal, Zsuzsanna; Atanasova, Lea; Cervantes-Badillo, Mayte G; Challacombe, Jean; Chertkov, Olga; McCluskey, Kevin; Coulpier, Fanny; Deshpande, Nandan; von DÃ¶hren, Hans; Ebbole, Daniel J; Esquivel-Naranjo, Edgardo U; Fekete, ErzsÃ©bet; Flipphi, Michel; Glaser, Fabian; GÃ³mez-RodrÃ­guez, Elida Y; Gruber, Sabine; Han, Cliff; Henrissat, Bernard; Hermosa, Rosa; HernÃ¡ndez-OÃ±ate, Miguel; Karaffa, Levente; Kosti, Idit; Le Crom, StÃ©phane; Lindquist, Erika; Lucas, Susan; LÃ¼beck, Mette; LÃ¼beck, Peter S; Margeot, Antoine; Metz, Benjamin; Misra, Monica; Nevalainen, Helena; Omann, Markus; Packer, Nicolle; Perrone, Giancarlo; Uresti-Rivera, Edith E; Salamov, Asaf; Schmoll, Monika; Seiboth, Bernhard; Shapiro, Harris; Sukno, Serenella; Tamayo-Ramos, Juan Antonio; Tisch, Doris; Wiest, Aric; Wilkinson, Heather H; Zhang, Michael; Coutinho, Pedro M; Kenerley, Charles M; Monte, Enrique; Baker, Scott E; Grigoriev, Igor V\n\n2011-01-01\n\nMycoparasitism, a lifestyle where one fungus is parasitic on another fungus, has special relevance when the prey is a plant pathogen, providing a strategy for biological control of pests for plant protection.

We exploit this result to obtain DFs for the general relativistic extension of the hypervirial family introduced by Nguyen and Lingam [Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 436, 2014 (2013), 10.1093/mnras/stt1719], which Newtonian potential is given by Ï (r )=-Ïo/[1 +(r /a )n]1 /n (a and Ïo are positive free parameters, n =1 ,2 ,â¦ ). Such DFs can be written in the form Fn=ln -2Î¾n(É ) . For odd n , we find that Î¾n is a polynomial of order 2 n +1 in É , as in the case of the Hernquist model (n =1 ), for which F1âl-1(2 É -1 ) (É-1 ) 2 . For even n , we can write Î¾n in terms of incomplete beta functions (Plummer model, n =2 , is an example). Since we demand that F â¥0 throughout the phase space, the particular form of each Î¾n leads to restrictions for the values of Ïo. For example, for the Hernquist model we find that 0 â¤Ïoâ¤2 /3 , i.e., an upper bounding value less than the one obtained for Nguyen and Lingam (0 â¤Ïoâ¤1 ), based on energy conditions.\n\nPhylogeny and taxonomic revision of the Planistromellaceae including its coelomycetous anamorphs: contributions towards a monograph of the genus Kellermania\n\nTreesearch\n\nA.M.

This has led to an increase in the number of genomes sequenced in all the fungal tree of life as well as a wide variety of plant genomes. The increase in sequencing has permitted us to study the evolution of organisms on a genomic scale. A number of talks during the conference discussed the importance of transposable elements (TEs) that are present in almost all species of fungi. These TEs represent an especially large percentage of genomic space in fungi that interact withmoreÂ Â» plants. Thierry Rouxel (INRA, Nancy, France) showed the link between speciation in the Leptosphaeria complex and the expansion of TE families. For example in the Leptosphaeria complex, one species associated with oilseed rape has experienced a recent and massive burst of movement by a few TE families. The alterations caused by these TEs took place in discrete regions of the genome leading to shuffling of the genomic landscape and the appearance of genes specific to the species, such as effectors useful for the interactions with a particular plant (Rouxel et al., 2011). Other presentations showed the importance of TEs in affecting genome organization. For example, in Amanita different species appear to have been invaded by different TE families (Veneault-Fourrey & Martin, 2011).Â«Â less\n\nCharacterization of Glomerella Strains Recovered from Anthracnose Lesions on Common Bean Plants in Brazil\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBarcelos, QuÃ©len L.; Pinto, Joyce M. A.; Vaillancourt, Lisa J.; Souza, Elaine A.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAnthracnose caused by Colletotrichum lindemuthianum is an important disease of common bean, resulting in major economic losses worldwide. Genetic diversity of the C. lindemuthianum population contributes to its ability to adapt rapidly to new sources of host resistance. The origin of this diversity is unknown, but sexual recombination, via the Glomerella teleomorph, is one possibility. This study tested the hypothesis that Glomerella strains that are frequently recovered from bean anthracnose lesions represent the teleomorph of C. lindemuthianum. A large collection of Glomerella isolates could be separated into two groups based on phylogenetic analysis, morphology, and pathogenicity to beans. Both groups were unrelated to C. lindemuthianum. One group clustered with the C. gloeosporioides species complex and produced mild symptoms on bean tissues. The other group, which belonged to a clade that included the cucurbit anthracnose pathogen C. magna, caused no symptoms. Individual ascospores recovered from Glomerella perithecia gave rise to either fertile (perithecial) or infertile (conidial) colonies. Some pairings of perithecial and conidial strains resulted in induced homothallism in the conidial partner, while others led to apparent heterothallic matings. Pairings involving two perithecial, or two conidial, colonies produced neither outcome. Conidia efficiently formed conidial anastomosis tubes (CATs), but ascospores never formed CATs. The Glomerella strains formed appressoria and hyphae on the plant surface, but did not penetrate or form infection structures within the tissues. Their behavior was similar whether the beans were susceptible or resistant to anthracnose. These same Glomerella strains produced thick intracellular hyphae, and eventually acervuli, if host cell death was induced. When Glomerella was co-inoculated with C. lindemuthianum, it readily invaded anthracnose lesions.

Pairings involving two perithecial, or two conidial, colonies produced neither outcome. Conidia efficiently formed conidial anastomosis tubes (CATs), but ascospores never formed CATs. The Glomerella strains formed appressoria and hyphae on the plant surface, but did not penetrate or form infection structures within the tissues. Their behavior was similar whether the beans were susceptible or resistant to anthracnose. These same Glomerella strains produced thick intracellular hyphae, and eventually acervuli, if host cell death was induced. When Glomerella was co-inoculated with C. lindemuthianum, it readily invaded anthracnose lesions. Thus, the hypothesis was not supported: Glomerella strains from anthracnose\n\nNeoerysiphe kerribeeensis sp. nov. (Ascomycota: Erysiphales), a new species of Neoerysiphe on native and introduced species of Senecio (Asteraceae) in Australia.\n\nPubMed\n\nBeilharz, Vyrna; Cunnington, James H; Pascoe, Ian G\n\n2010-04-01\n\nAnamorphic powdery mildew fungi on introduced taxa of Senecio and Pericallis Ã hybrida in Australia have previously been identified as Neoerysiphe cumminsiana on the basis of a combination of Euoidium-type conidiophores and lobed mycelial and germ tube appressoria. But, two specimens with chasmothecia on the indigenous Senecio glossanthus did not agree with published descriptions of N. cumminsiana. The teleomorph of the S. glossanthus mildew differed from that of N. cumminsiana in the morphology of its peridial cells, the pigmentation of its appendages, and the morphology and pigmentation of some secondary hyphae. Ribosomal DNA ITS sequences from the two S. glossanthus mildew specimens and five other specimens of Senecio mildews from south-eastern Australia demonstrated that all Australian Senecio mildews are conspecific and distinct from the northern hemisphere Senecio mildew (N. cumminsiana) and from other Neoerysiphe taxa. Based on morphological characters and rDNA sequence data, the Australian Senecio mildew is described as a new species, Neoerysiphe kerribeeensis. This is the first native teleomorphic powdery mildew described from Australia. Copyright Â© 2010 The British Mycological Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Only one other rust is known to parasitize Kalanchoe spp. A DNA sequence of A. kalanchoe suggests that the teleomorph is related to Puccinia.\n\nDiscussion of teleomorphic and anamorphic Ascomycetous yeasts and yeast-like taxa\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nThe relationship of ascomycetous yeasts with other members of the ascomycete fungi (Ascomycota) has been controversial for over 100 years. Because yeasts are morphologically simple, it was proposed that they represent primitive forms of ascomycetes (e.g., Guilliermond 1912). Alternatively, the ide...\n\nOccurrence of Clavispora lusitaniae, the teleomorph of Candida lusitaniae, among clinical isolates.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGargeya, I B; Pruitt, W R; Simmons, R B; Meyer, S A; Ahearn, D G\n\n1990-01-01\n\nOf 13 clinical isolates of Candida lusitaniae from diverse geographical regions, 7 represented the mating types (6 alpha, 1 a) of the ascomycete Clavispora lusitaniae. Selected nonfertile isolates showed significant DNA relatedness (greater than 90%) to representatives of both mating types. Phenotypic physiological characteristics, such as cellobiose fermentation and rhamnose assimilation, proved insufficient for separation of Clavispora lusitaniae and Clavispora opuntiae.

We sought to examine the contribution of outdoor fungi to childhood and adolescent asthma hospitalizations. The Melbourne Air Pollen Children and Adolescent study is a case-crossover study of 644 children and adolescents (aged 2-17Â years) hospitalized for asthma. The Melbourne Air Pollen Children and Adolescent study collected individual data on human rhinovirus infection and sensitization to Alternaria and Cladosporium and daily counts of ambient concentrations of fungal spores, pollen, and air pollutants. Conditional logistic regression models were used to assess associations with increases in spore counts while controlling for potential confounding and testing interactions. Exposure to Alternaria (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.07; 95% CI, 1.03-1.11), Leptosphaeria (aOR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.07), Coprinus (aOR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07), Drechslera (aOR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00-1.05), and total spores (aOR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.09) was significantly associated with child asthma hospitalizations independent of human rhinovirus infection. There were significant lagged effects up to 3Â days with Alternaria, Leptosphaeria, Cladosporium, Sporormiella, Coprinus, and Drechslera. Some of these associations were significantly greater in participants with Cladosporium sensitization. Exposures to several outdoor fungal spore taxa, including some not reported in previous research, are associated with the risk of child and adolescent asthma hospitalization, particularly in individuals sensitized to Cladosporium. We need further studies to examine cross-reactivity causing asthma exacerbations. Identifying sensitization to multiple fungal allergens in children with asthma could support the design and implementation of more effective strategies to prevent asthma exacerbations.
