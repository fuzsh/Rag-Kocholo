        "text": "Hysteriaceous ascomycetes are an interesting and important group of fungi belonging to a small number of families and orders in the class Dothideomycetes. They can be saprobes, endophytes and/or ectomycorrhizal. Hysteriaceous fungi mainly occur on twigs or bark of various woody and herbaceous plants in terrestrial and aquatic environments worldwide. They have evolved convergently at least five times, and further studies are needed to resolve the taxonomic placement of new and previously described taxa. In this study, we introduce a new order, Gloniales, to accommodate Glonium, a new family, Acrogenosporaceae, to accommodate Acrogenospora, five new species (Hysterium doimaeensis, H. thailandica, Hysterobrevium hakeae, Hy. rosae and Mytilinidion didymospora) and a new combination (Purpurepithecium minus). New records are provided with descriptions and illustrations are given for Gloniopsis subrugosa, Hysterium angustatum and Hysterographium fraxi. The findings are supported by morphological and phylogenetic analyses of LSU SSU, RPB2 and TEF1 sequence data. In addition, amino acid sequences of RPB2 were phylogenetically analyzed.\n\nNumerous new taxa and classifications of Dothideomycetes have been published following the last monograph of families of Dothideomycetes in 2013. A recent publication by Honsanan et al. in 2020 expanded information of families in Dothideomycetidae and Pleosporomycetidae with modern classifications. In this paper, we provide a refined updated document on orders and families incertae sedis of Dothideomycetes. Each family is provided with an updated description, notes, including figures to represent the morphology, a list of accepted genera, and economic and ecological significances. We also provide phylogenetic trees for each order. In this study, 31 orders which consist 50 families are assigned as orders incertae sedis in Dothideomycetes, and 41 families are treated as families incertae sedis due to lack of molecular or morphological evidence. The new order, Catinellales, and four new families, Catinellaceae, Morenoinaceae Neobuelliellaceae and Thyrinulaceae are introduced. Seven gen...\n\nABSTRACT One-hundred and sixteen genera are listed as incertae sedis in the class Dothideomycetes. This is a first of a series of papers in which we re-examine the herbarium types of these genera, which are generally poorly known. By examining the generic types we can suggest higher level placements, but more importantly we illustrate the taxa so that they are better understood. In this way the taxa can be recollected, sequenced and placed in a natural taxonomic framework in the Ascomycota. In this study we re-examined the genera Dermatodothella, Dothideopsella, Gloeodiscus, Grandigallia and Hysteropeltella. We re-describe and illustrate the type species of these genera and discuss their placements using modern concepts. Dermatodothella is placed in Polystomellaceae, Dothideopsella in Phaeosphaeriaceae, Grandigallia in Shiraiaceae and Hysteropeltella in Schizothyriaceae, while Gloeodiscus is retained in Dothideomycetes incertae sedis. Fresh collections of these genera are needed for further studies, so that they can be epitypified and molecular data can be analyzed to obtain a natural classification\n\nWe provide an expanded and updated, 2-locus phylogeny (mtSSU, nuLSU) of the lichenized fungal familyTrypetheliaceae, with a total of 196 ingroup OTUs, in order to further refine generic delimitations and species concepts in this family. As a result, the following 15 clades are recognized as separate genera, including five newly established genera:Aptrootia,Architrypethelium,Astrothelium(including the bulk of corticate species with astrothelioid ascospores; synonyms:Campylothelium,Cryptothelium,Laurera),Batheliums. str. (excludingB. degeneransand relatives which fall intoAstrothelium), the reinstatedBogoriella(for tropical, lichenized species previously placed inMycomicrothelia),Constrictoluminagen. nov. (for tropical, lichenized species ofArthopyrenia),Dictyomeridiumgen. nov. (for a subgroup of species with muriform ascospores previously placed inPolymeridium),Julella(provisionally, as the type species remains unsequenced),Marcelaria(Laurera purpurinacomplex),Nigrovotheliumgen. nov...."
