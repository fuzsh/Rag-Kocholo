        "text": "The paper presents characteristics of cercosporoid fungal species from three genera, Cercospora, Passalora, and Pseudocercospora, occurring in Poland and deposited in Polish herbaria or to be expected due to the occurrence of their host plants in the Polish flora. The physiographic literature, but primarily own collections, as well as those gathered in the national herbaria, were the object of the revision.\n\nThis monograph provides morphological descriptions, lists of hosts and distribution in Poland and worldwide as well as detailed illustrations for 41 species. Dichotomous keys for identification of fungi parasitizing hosts from different plant families were prepared within the individual fungal genera.\n\nThe present study represents a compilation of 115 cercosporoid species, of which 63 are reported from Poland and another 6 were doubtful and excluded. The fungi parasitize 221 taxa of host plants from 131 genera and 47 families, out of which 158 taxa from 94 genera and 29 families have been actually found in Poland. Fourteen species described in this book belong to Cercospora apii s. l. Nine quarantine species are listed, from which only three have been published so far.\n\nThis study will be helpful to mycologists, plant pathologist, and Polish plant protection services for identification purposes of the fungi concerned."
