        "text": "The Sigatoka leaf spot complex on Musa spp. includes three major pathogens: Pseudocercospora, namely P. musae (Sigatoka leaf spot or yellow Sigatoka), P. eumusae (eumusae leaf spot disease), and P. fijiensis (black leaf streak disease or black Sigatoka). However, more than 30 species of Mycosphaerellaceae have been associated with Sigatoka leaf spots of banana, and previous reports of P. musae and P. eumusae need to be re-evaluated in light of recently described species. The aim of the present study was thus to investigate a global set of 228 isolates of P. musae, P. eumusae and close relatives on banana using multigene DNA sequence data [internal transcribed spacer regions with intervening 5.8S nrRNA gene (ITS), RNA polymerase II second largest subunit gene (rpb2), translation elongation factor 1-alpha gene (tef1), beta-tubulin gene (tub2), and the actin gene (act)] to confirm if these isolates represent P. musae, or a closely allied species. Based on these data one new species is described, namely P. pseudomusae, which is associated with leaf spot symptoms resembling those of P. musae on Musa in Indonesia. Furthermore, P. eumusae, P. musae and P. fijiensis are shown to be well defined taxa, with some isolates also representing P. longispora. Other genera encountered in the dataset are species of Zasmidium (Taiwan leaf speckle), Metulocladosporiella (Cladosporium leaf speckle) and Scolecobasidium leaf speckle.\n\nCitation: Crous P, Carlier J, Roussel V, Groenewald JZ (2020). Pseudocercospora and allied genera associated with leaf spots of banana (Musa spp.). Fungal Systematics and Evolution 7: 1–19. doi: 10.3114/fuse.2021.07.01\n\nDNA extraction, amplification (PCR) and phylogeny\n\nFungal mycelium ( ) was scraped from the agar surface of cultures with a sterile scalpel and genomic DNA was isolated using the Wizard® Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega Corporation, WI, USA) following the manufacturers’ protocols. Eight loci were amplified following previously published protocols. First, the partial ITS region was sequenced for all isolates included in this study (for amplification conditions, see Fan et al. 2018). Amplification of the partial DNA-directed RNA polymerase II second largest subunit gene (rpb2), the partial translation elongation factor 1-alpha gene (tef1) and the partial beta-tubulin gene (tub2) followed Braun et al. (2018), while the amplification of the partial actin gene (act) followed Videira et al. (2016). The resulting fragments were sequenced in both directions using the respective PCR primers and the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit v. 3.1 (Applied Biosystems Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA); DNA sequencing amplicons were purified through Sephadex G-50 Superfine columns (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in MultiScreen HV plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Purified sequence reactions were analysed on an Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The DNA sequences were analysed and consensus sequences were computed using SeqMan Pro v. 13 (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA).\n\nThe sequences for each gene region were subjected to megablast searches (Zhang et al. 2000) to identify closely related sequences in the NCBI’s GenBank nucleotide database. Sequences of the individual loci were aligned using MAFFT v. 7 (http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/index.html) (Katoh & Standley 2013), and the alignments were then manually edited in MEGA v. 7.0.21. Sequence Matrix v. 1.8 (http://www.ggvaidya.com/taxondna/) was used to concatenate the individual loci in various combinations. Phylogenetic trees on the combined datasets were generated using Bayesian analyses performed with MrBayes v. 3.2.7 (Ronquist et al. 2012) as explained in Braun et al. (2018) and Pseudocercospora individual gene trees were evaluated using distance and parsimony analyses with PAUP v. 4.0b10 (Swofford 2003). All resulting trees were printed with Geneious v. 11.1.5 3 (http://www.geneious.com, Kearse et al. 2012) and the layout of the trees was done in Adobe Illustrator v. CC 2017.\n\nPhylogeny\n\nBased on the blast results, the majority of strains belonged to Pseudocercospora musae (104 strains) and Pseudocercospora eumusae (48 strains), while other Pseudocercospora species included Pseudocercospora fijiensis (two strains), Pseudocercospora longispora (two strains) and five strains representing a novel Pseudocercospora species related to Pseudocercospora musae ( ). The remainder of the strains tentatively identified as Mycosphaerella musae based on symptomatology (seven strains), Zasmidium musae (five strains), Scolecobasidium musicola (= Ochroconis musicola) (four strains, ), Parapallidocercospora thailandica (three strains), while one strain was identical to Pantospora guazumae and the last strain represented a Penicillium infection and was discarded from further analyses ( ).\n\nTwo Bayesian analyses were performed ( ); the first on a concatenated ITS/act/tef1/rpb2 alignment of Pseudocercospora sequences ( ) and the second on a concatenated ITS/act/tef1/tub2 alignment of Scolecobasidium sequences ( ). The Pseudocercospora phylogeny ( ) delimits four known species clades, namely Pseudocercospora eumusae, Pseudocercospora fijiensis, Pseudocercospora longispora and Pseudocercospora musae, with five strains from Musa (Indonesia) clustering in a lineage sister to Pseudocercospora musae and representing a novel species which is described below. All five species clades were fully supported in the Bayesian analyses (posterior probability value of 1.0). Based on the Scolecobasidium phylogeny ( ), two strains are very closely related to the ex-type strain of Scolecobasidium musicola while two other strains form a closely related sister lineage. The two lineages have the following numbers of fixed nucleotide differences: ITS (19 substitutions and one indel), act (13 substitutions; no sequence available for the ex-type), tef1 (23 substitutions) and tub2 (8 substitutions and one indel; no sequence available for CPC 37348).\n\nTable 2.\n\nAnalysisNumber of ingroup sequencesNumber of generationsNumber of trees used1Substitution models used for Bayesian analyses; Number of unique site patternsITSactrpb2tef1tub2Ochroconis26100 00015 002GTR+I+G; 462HKY+G; 186–HKY+I+G; 332GTR+I+G; 262Pseudocercospora1846 680 000100 202HKY+I; 75HKY+G; 69GTR+I; 178HKY+G; 183–\n\nTaxonomy\n\nPseudocercospora pseudomusae Crous & Carlier, sp. nov. MycoBank MB837605. .\n\nEtymology: Name reflects the genetic similarity to Pseudocercospora musae.\n\nColonies sporulating on PDA. Conidiophores aggregated in dense fascicles forming sporodochia on agar surface; consisting of septate, medium brown, thin-walled, smooth, subcylindrical conidiophores frequently branched below, 20–60 × 3–5 μm. Conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal and intercalary, proliferating sympodially, subcylindrical, smooth, olivaceous, 13–20 × 3–4 μm. Conidia solitary, olivaceous, thin-walled, smooth, subcylindrical, straight to curved, apex obtuse, base truncate, (60–)70–80(–100) × (2.5–)3 μm, (2–)4–5(–6)-septate.\n\nCulture characteristics: Colonies erumpent, spreading, surface folded, with sparse to moderate aerial mycelium and even, lobate margins, reaching 8 mm after 2 wk at 25 °C in the dark. On MEA and PDA surface olivaceous grey, reverse iron-grey. On OA surface olivaceous grey with diffuse yellow pigment in agar (more prominent in isolates CPC 37273, 37378 and 37279).\n\nTypus: Indonesia, on leaves of Musa sp., 1988, J. Carlier (holotype CBS H-24557, culture ex-type CPC 37270 = IDN 02 = CBS 147147).\n\nAdditional materials examined: Indonesia, on leaves of Musa sp., 1988, J. Carlier CPC 37269 = IDN 01 = CBS 147148; on leaves of Musa sp., 1988, J. Carlier, 37273 = IDN 29 = CBS 147149; on leaves of Musa sp., 1989, J. Carlier, CPC 37278 = IDN 57 = CBS 147150, CPC 37279 = IDN 58 = CBS 147151.\n\nNotes: Pseudocercospora pseudomusae is closely related to P. musae, which has more obclavate-cylindrical conidia, that are (10–)20–80(–110) × (2–)2.5–5(–6) μm, (0–)2–7(–9)-septate (Braun et al. 2014). Conidia of P. pseudomusae differ in being more subcylindrical (not obclavate), and on average being longer than those of P. pseudomusae.\n\nThe five isolates of P. pseudomusae clustered together with full support in the multi-gene phylogeny ( ). In the individual gene phylogenies based on distance and parsimony analyses (data not shown), the species can be distinguished from P. musae based on ITS and rpb2 while the distinction is less well-defined for tef1 and the strains are intermingled on act. The ITS sequence of CPC 37270 is 455/468 (97 %, including one indel) to 460/468 (98 %, no indels) similar to the included P. musae ITS sequences. The act sequence of CPC 37270 is 545/550 (99 %, no indels) to 498/501 (99 %, no indels) similar to the included P. musae act sequences. The rpb2 sequence of CPC 37270 is 588/592 (99 %, no indels) to 647/650 (99 %, no indels) similar to the included P. musae rpb2 sequences. The tef1 sequence of CPC 37270 is 448/453 (99 %, no indels) to 449/453 (99 %, no indels) similar to the included P. musae tef1 sequences.\n\nSeveral of the isolates associated leaf speckle turned out to be representative of the genus Scolecobasidium, which together with its generic synonym, Ochroconis, were recently treated by Shen et al. (2020). All species of Ochroconis for which DNA data are available have since been transferred to Scolecobasidium, except O. ailanthi, which is thus treated below.\n\nScolecobasidium ailanthi (Jayasiri et al.)
