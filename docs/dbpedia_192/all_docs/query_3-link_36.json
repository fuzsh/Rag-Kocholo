        "text": "The genus Cercospora was erected by Frensious (1863). Etymologically the generic name means a fungus has obclavate (Tail shaped) spores. The species concept and taxonomy of Cercospora are based upon morphological criteria, primarily the dimensions and characteristics of the conidia (length, width, base, and tip) and conidiophores (length, diameter, geniculation, and fasciculation) (Chupp, 1954). In his monograph on the genus Cercospora, Chupp (1954) discussed the reliability of the various characteristics used to distinguish and identify the species. Among the characteristics of conidia, spore width is considered to be the most reliable feature. Indeed, this characteristic is a major criterion used to distinguish C. canescens from leaves of mungbean, and other legumes. In general, other conidial features are less reliable, because they are either influenced to a large extent by environmental conditions (e.g., length) or represented by too few distinctive forms (e.g., features of the..."
