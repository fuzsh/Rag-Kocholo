In this study, genome sequence assembly of C. sesami isolate Cers 52–10 (MCC 9069) was generated using native paired-end and mate-pair DNA sequencing based on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. The genome assembly of C. sesami is 34.3 Mb in size with an N50 of 26,222 bp and an average GC content of 53.02%. A total number of 10,872 genes were predicted in this study, out of which 9,712 genes were functionally annotated. Genes assigned to carbohydrate-active enzyme classes were also identified during the study. A total of 80 putative effector candidates were predicted and functionally annotated. The C. sesami genome sequence is available at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank, and other associated information is submitted to Mendeley's data.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13205-023-03468-4.\n\nKeywords: Cercospora leaf spot, Effectors, Gene annotation, Genome assembly, Plant pathogens, Sesame\n\nIntroduction\n\nSesame (Sesamum indicum) is one of the India’s oldest oilseed crops, cultivated throughout Asia, Africa, and South America’s tropical and subtropical climates (Zhang et al. 2013). Decorticated sesame seeds contain 45 to 63% oil, protein, vitamins, minerals and lignans. It is also used in the bakery industries and herbal medicine (Anilakumar et al. 2010). Sesame consumption is rising globally due to changes in the food habits of consumers for health-related benefits. Like any other crop, sesame is also prone to different diseases. Cercospora leaf spot caused by Cercospora sesami is the major fungal disease that hinders sesame cultivation resulting in significant yield losses. C. sesami belongs to one of the largest genera of hyphomycetes, Cercospora, with its teleomorph Mycosphaerella (Capnodiales, Mycosphaerellaceae) (Groenewald et al. 2013), which comprises about 3000 described species (Wijayawardene et al. 2017). C. sesami was first reported by Zimmermann in 1904 on Sesamum indicum, Ceratotheca triloba and Pretrea zanguebarica. The pathogen was reported from Asia, Africa, West Indies, and South and Central America (https://www.mycobank.org/). In India, the pathogen is widespread in all the places where sesame is cultivated (Kamal 2010). The pathogen affects the crop at all phases of development. The infection causes defoliation and damage to the sesame capsule, leading to 20 to 55% yield loss (Enikuomehin et al. 2010).\n\nThe genome organization of C. sesami is still unknown. Molecular data on barcodes is rarely available for C. sesami. The genes responsible for pathogenesis are still unidentified in this pathogen. As the knowledge of genome structure is very vital for understanding the pathosystems, therefore, in this study we report a detailed analysis of de novo whole-genome assembly and gene annotation of C. sesami isolate Cers 52–10. We have also identified and functionally annotated effector repertoires of C. sesami. The predicted effectors can be used further for functional genomics studies.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nCollection, identification and monoconidial isolation\n\nCercospora sesami infected leaf samples were collected during a survey from Birsa Agricultural University, Ranchi, Jharkhand, India. The leaves were observed and photographed by a Nikon D5200 digital camera (Nikon, Japan), and examined microscopically for characteristic symptoms using a Nikon Eclipse E200 microscope. The NIS-Elements v 4.0 imaging software was used to capture the micrographs of conidia and conidiophores at 20 × and 40 × resolution. The characteristic symptoms of the leaf spot and morphological characteristics of conidia and conidiophores were confirmed with the MycoBank database. The leaves for isolation were selected based on typical symptoms of Cercospora leaf spot and disease severity. The disease severity was recorded on a 1–9 disease rating scale (Alice and Nadarajan 2007). The leaf with above 75% infection (Rating scale – 9) was chosen for isolation.\n\nThe methods given by Chupp (1953) and Choi et al. (1999) were modified and used for the monoconidial isolation of the pathogen. The leaf spot was directly observed under the microscope to locate the spots where maximum sporulation has occurred. The ash gray center of the leaf spot having spore deposits was lifted with the help of a sterilized needle. The spores were spread over 2% water agar (Goode and Brown 1970) plates and incubated at 26 ºC for 24 h. The germinated spores were located under the microscope at a magnification of 100 × and marked. The individual germinated spore together with a water agar block was excised with the help of a sterilized cork borer of 5 mm and was inoculated on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) plates. The plates were incubated at 26 °C.\n\nPathogenicity test and culture deposition\n\nThe pathogenicity of the C. sesami isolate Cers 52–10 was tested in a greenhouse on healthy sesame plants. The inoculum was prepared by multiplying the C. sesami isolate Cers 52–10 on boiled sorghum grains following the protocol given by Chand et al. (2013). The spore suspension of 104 spore ml−1 was used for inoculation at the 50% flowering stage in five sesame plants. Similarly, control plants were sprayed with sterile distilled water. The plants were kept in the greenhouse, and high relative humidity (> 80%) was maintained by spraying water every two hours for two days and a temperature of around 25–28 ºC. Leaf spot symptoms appeared on the inoculated plants 7 days after inoculation. The symptoms were absent in the control plants. C. sesami was re-isolated from the leaves of the inoculated plants showing typical Cercospora leaf spot symptoms. The morphology was identical to the original isolate. Thus, the pathogenicity test revealed that C. sesami isolate Cers 52–10 fulfilled Koch’s postulates.\n\nThe culture of C. sesami was submitted to the National Fungal Culture Collection of India (NFCCI), Agharkar Research Institute, Pune, India, and International Depositary Authority (IDA) recognized repository, National Centre for Microbial Resource, National Centre for Cell Science (NCMR-NCCS), Pune, India, with an accession number NFCCI 3832 and MCC 9069.\n\nDNA isolation and PCR amplification\n\nThe mycelium of C. sesami isolate Cers 52–10 was grown aseptically on PDB (Potato Dextrose Broth) in a 100 ml conical flask and was incubated at 25 °C for 10 days. The mycelial mat was harvested aseptically and used for DNA extraction. Total genomic DNA was extracted using the modified Cetyltrimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) protocol (Murray and Thompson 1980). The concentration of genomic DNA was determined using the Thermoscientific UV–Vis spectrophotometer NanoDrop™ One/One c. The DNA extracted was used for molecular confirmation of C. sesami isolate Cers 52–10 and further for genome sequencing.\n\nThe extracted DNA was diluted to a final concentration of 20 ng/µl for use in Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The DNA amplification was performed by Bio-Rad T100 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad, California, USA) using Qiagen HotStar Taq Master Mix Kit (Qiagen, Germany). Three different primers, that is, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region (White et al. 1990), large subunit of ribosomal RNA (LSU) (Vilgalys and Hester 1990; Rehner and Samuels 1995) and actin (ACT) (Carbone and Kohn 1999) were amplified. The amplification products were separated by electrophoresis at 70 V for 1 h on 2.0% agarose gel. The representative sequences resulting in 545 bp ITS, 1032 bp LSU and 166 bp ACT were deposited in GenBank with accession: {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"MK027103\",\"term_id\":\"1487549121\",\"term_text\":\"MK027103\"}}MK027103, {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"MK029365\",\"term_id\":\"1487707701\",\"term_text\":\"MK029365\"}}MK029365 and {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"OM365916\",\"term_id\":\"2370658636\",\"term_text\":\"OM365916\"}}OM365916, respectively.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis\n\nThe phylogenetic tree was constructed using the concatenated ITS, LSU and ACT datasets. Reference sequences of different Cercospora species were retrieved from Groenewald et al. (2013), Nguanhom et al. (2015) and GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) (Table S1). The sequences were concatenated using Geneious Prime v 2022.1.1 (http://www.geneious.com/). The concatenated sequences were aligned using Clustal Omega (McWilliam et al. 2013). The phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA11 (Tamura et al. 2021). The statistical method used for phylogenetic tree construction was the Neighbor-Joining method (Saitou and Nei 1987). One thousand bootstrap repetitions calculated the confidence level for each branch. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Tajima-Nei model (Tajima and Nei 1984). The number of base substitutions per site was 0.02. The positions containing gaps and missing data were deleted entirely. Zymoseptoria tritici (CBS 100329) was used as an outgroup.\n\nGenome sequencing and assembly\n\nThe genome of C. sesami isolate Cers 52–10 was sequenced using paired-end (2 × 100 bp) and mate-pair (2 × 250 bp) sequencing based on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina, California, USA). The quality of raw fastq files obtained from the sequencer was checked using FastQC (Andrews 2010) before performing assembly. The adapters and low-quality reads with an average quality score of less than 30 in any paired-end and mate-pair reads were removed using AdapterRemoval v 2.3.1 (Schubert et al. 2016). The duplicate reads were removed, and unique reads were obtained using FastUniq v 1.1 (Xu et al. 2012). The de novo assembly was performed using MaSuRCA v 3.2.3 (Zimin et al. 2013). A range of 31–95 k-mers was used for MaSuRCA assembly. The genome assembly quality was assessed using QUAST v 4.6 (Gurevich et al. 2013). The genome annotation completeness was assessed using the BUSCO v 2.0 Ascomycete odb_9 dataset (Simao et al. 2015). The repeat regions were identified through RepeatMasker Open-4.0. with default parameters (Smit et al. 2015).\n\nGene prediction and annotation\n\nThe protein-coding genes from the MaSuRCA assembled contigs were predicted by applying the ab initio gene predictor AUGUSTUS v 3.3.2 (Stanke and Morgenstern 2005) with default parameters. Cercospora beticola was used as the reference model for gene prediction. The predicted genes were annotated using the following in-house pipeline. The predicted genes were compared with the UniProt database (UniProt Consortium 2021) using the BLASTx v 2.6.0 tool (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/) with an E-value cutoff of 10–3. The best BLASTx hit for each gene was chosen based on query coverage, identity, similarity score, and gene description. The predicted genes were annotated using BLASTx searches against UniProt and other databases. The gene ontology (GO) terms (Molecular Function (MF), Cellular Component (CC), Biological Process (BP)) for genes were mapped using InterProScan v 5 (Jones et al. 2014), KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto 2000), eggNOG-mapper (Huerta-Cepas et al. 2017) and Pfam (El-Gebali et al. 2019) databases. The predicted genes were subjected to the dbCAN2 meta-server with default parameters (Zhang et al. 2018) to predict and classify carbohydrates active enzymes (CAZymes) classes.\n\nGenome comparison using dashing\n\nGenome assembly of all 21 available Cercospora genomes were downloaded from the NCBI WGS database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/wgs/). The pairwise genomic distance and similarity of 21 Cercospora genomes were calculated using Dashing v 1.0 (Baker and Langmead 2019) with K-mer length 16. The following subcommands were used in Dashing – “dist,” “sketch,” “hll,” “union,” and “printmat.” The Dashing “dist” command was used to generate an upper triangular distance matrix. This distance matrix was further used for generating the Pearson correlation plot using the “cor” function and “ggplot2” package in R (R Core Team 2021; https://www.r-project.org/).\n\nEffector prediction and annotation\n\nThe effectors in the C. sesami genome were predicted using a computational pipeline. The predicted protein dataset was subjected to SignalP v 5.0 (Armenteros et al. 2019,b) to detect secretory proteins. The non-secretory proteins were eliminated and the secretory protein dataset was then subjected to PredGPI (Pierleoni et al. 2008) to eliminate glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored proteins, followed by TMHMM v 2.0 (Krogh et al. 2001) to eliminate the proteins with one or more transmembrane domains. TargetP v 2.0 (Armenteros et al. 2019a) was used to eliminate proteins targeted to mitochondria and chloroplast. WoLF PSORT (Horton et al. 2007) and DeepLoc v 1.0 (Armenteros et al. 2017) were used to identify apoplastic and cytoplasmic proteins. Further, cysteine content (≥ 4 cysteine residues) and the size of the proteins (≤ 300 amino acids) were determined using Geneious Prime v 2022.1.1. EffectorP v 2.0 (Sperschneider et al. 2018) was used to identify putative effector candidates. The predicted effectors were functionally annotated by assigning GO terms using OmicsBox (Götz et al. 2008).\n\nResults\n\nMorphological and molecular identification of C. sesami\n\nC. sesami infected leaf spots were 0.5–3 mm in diameter, circular to sub-circular with a gray center and brown to black margin (Fig. a, b). Conidiophores were in fascicles of 2–9, olivaceous brown, multiseptate and geniculate with a scar at the sub-truncate tip (Fig. c). Conidia were acicular, hyaline, multiseptate with acute tip (Fig. d). The colony of C. sesami was white on the obverse side and reddish-pink on the reverse side of the culture plate (Fig. e, f).\n\nMolecular identification was carried out by constructing a phylogenetic tree based on the combined ITS, LSU, and ACT datasets (Fig. ). A BLAST search in GenBank using the ITS sequences revealed that the sequences showed over 99–100% identity with many Cercospora species, including C. canescens, C. physalidis, C. beticola, C. capsici, C. apii and many others. However, LSU sequences showed 99–100% identity only with C. beticola, C. citrullina and C. malayensis. ACT sequences showed 99–100% identity only with C. kikuchii, Cercospora sp. Q JZG-2013 (CPC 10551) and Cercospora sp. 2 LO-2017. The phylogenetic tree constructed using three combined datasets, showed that C. sesami from S. indicum formed a well-supported clade sister to a clade consisting of Cercospora species as well as formed a distinct clade from other genera such as Zymoseptoria. Furthermore, the C. sesami pathogen isolated from the leaf spot on S. indicum was closely related to C. chrysanthemoides on Chrysanthemoides monilifera.\n\nThe estimation of pairwise distances and similarity of 21 Cercospora genome datasets was obtained from Dashing software (Tables S2–S3). The distance matrix value represented the most similar (0) and the most divergent (1) genome. The observed distance matrix was correlated by the Pearson correlation approach. It varied between – 1 (distantly correlated) to 1 (identical). The correlation profiling revealed the expression similarities among 21 genomes (Fig. , S1).\n\nGenome assembly and annotation\n\nThe assembled draft genome of C. sesami was 34.3 Mb in size with an N50 value of 26,222 bp and an average GC content of 53.02%. Genome assembly statistics are presented in Table . Currently, 21 genome assemblies of Cercospora are available in the NCBI WGS database. The assembly statistics of all the genomes are presented in Table .

The maximum and minimum sizes of the genes were 6325 bp and 25 bp, respectively. The number of predicted genes with significant BLASTx matched with the UniProt database was 9712 (89.30% of 10,872 genes). The annotations were supported using publicly available databases. Gene ontology analysis mapped 1038 genes associated with molecular functions. Most genes were associated with metal ion binding, ATP binding, oxidoreductase activity, catalytic activity and RNA polymerase II transcription factor activity. There were 350 genes related to cellular components majorly linked to an integral component of the membrane, nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondria, ribosome and extracellular region. There were 977 genes related to biological processes such as metabolic processes, transmembrane transport, intracellular protein transport, DNA repair, transcription and translation (Fig. ).\n\nThe carbohydrate-active enzyme family\n\nCAZymes play an essential role in colonizing host tissues by phytopathogenic fungi. Their primary functions include the breakdown, biosynthesis or modification of glycoconjugates and oligo- and polysaccharides (Lyu et al. 2015). CAZymes are classified into four main classes: glycosyl transferases (GT), glycoside hydrolases (GH), polysaccharide lyases (PL) and carbohydrate esterases (CE) (Cantarel et al. 2009). The genome of C. sesami was mapped to study the presence of CAZymes. A total of 291 genes were assigned to carbohydrate-active enzyme classes as defined in the database. The most abundant class was GH, with 159 (54.6%) genes followed by GT, with 52 (17.86%) genes. A comparative overview of CAZymes of C. sesami with other plant pathogenic fungi belonging to dothideomycetes is presented in Table .\n\nTable 4\n\nTaxaGHGTPLCECBMsCercospora sesami159523148Pseudocercospora fijiensis24410966430Mycosphaerella graminicola1849732020Stagonospora nodorum28492105774Dothistroma septosporum20211465728Zymoseptoria tritici19810634724Sphaerulina musiva18010764126Bipolaris maydis268102158381\n\nEffector prediction and annotation\n\nThe predicted protein dataset of C. sesami consisted of 714 (6.5%) secretory proteins. Out of 714, 52 proteins with a GPI-linked domain were eliminated. Of the remaining 662 proteins, 60 proteins with one or more transmembrane domains were eliminated. Eighty putative effector repertoires were predicted from the above protein dataset by EffectorP analysis. Out of 80, 36 (45%) effectors were small-secreted proteins with ≤ 300 amino acids and ≥ 4 cysteine residues. Functional annotation analysis of the predicted effectors identified 27 (38%) proteins with hypothetical functions. Other effectors included proteins belonging to different enzyme classes like glycosyl hydrolases, carbohydrate esterases, proteases, endo-peptidases, oxidoreductases, catalases and peroxidases. Many others were rich in essential domains that may play a crucial role in pathogenesis.\n\nDiscussion\n\nCercospora leaf spot of sesame is a very prevalent disease across the regions of the world where sesame is cultivated. Due to a lack of resistant sources, the released sesame varieties are highly susceptible to Cercospora leaf spot, resulting in a low yield. This study generated a C. sesami genome assembly of 34.3 Mb with 53.02% of GC content. The study reports the first genome assembly of C. sesami until now. The assembled size of the genome of C. sesami was found to be comparable to the genome assemblies of other Cercospora species (Table ). Comparative genome analysis involved gene annotation, estimation of genomic distances, identification of repeat elements, characterization of carbohydrate-active enzymes and identification and functional characterization of putative effector proteins.\n\nThe calculation of genomic distances for the delineation of fungal species is very important. It is reported that genome pairs within and between species of the same genus could be correctly distinguished in almost 90% of cases, using an uncurated dataset of fungal genomes from GenBank and in more than 90% of the cases on a minimally curated dataset (Gostinčar 2020). The tools like Mash (Ondov et al. 2016) and Dashing (Baker and Langmead 2019) are user-friendly tools used in the calculation of genomic distances. Mash is considered one of the standard tools of comparative genomics which uses MinHash sketch whereas Dashing uses HyperLogLog (HLL) sketch and cardinality estimation methods that provide improved speed and accuracy for a wide range of genomic datasets (Baker and Langmead 2019). In this study, Dashing was used to generate pairwise distance and similarity matrix of 21 currently available Cercospora genomic datasets using the default setting and k-mer size 16.\n\nEighty effectors were predicted in this study. There are various criteria to define the candidate effector proteins which often involve the use of different in-silico tools. These criteria include the presence of signal peptide, no transmembrane domain, small size containing ≤ 300 amino acids and high cysteine residues (Stergiopoulos and de Wit 2009; Lo Presti et al. 2015; Sperschneider et al. 2015a; Sonah et al. 2016). These features have been used widely for screening a large number of candidates for functional analysis of potent effectors. Although these criteria help reduce the number of candidates, the problem remains unsolved as not all secreted small cysteine-rich proteins will function as an effector and on the contrary not all fungal effectors will be small and cysteine-rich (Sperschneider et al. 2015b). The web-based tools are 89% accurate in the prediction of effectors from the predicted secretome (Kanja and Hammond-Kosack 2020). Therefore, additional studies such as in-planta expression, diversifying selection and understanding of genomic features are needed to ensure that potential effector proteins are not being missed (Sperschneider et al. 2015a; Selin et al. 2016).\n\nBefore this study, there was minimal information available on the genome structure of C. sesami. Consequently, this research was initiated as the first step toward understanding the genome organization of C. sesami and narrowing down the number of effector candidates. This will open a window for future functional genomics studies of effectors. The predicted effector candidates can be confirmed using additional studies like in-planta expression and together with the understanding of genome structure, can play an essential role in the development of disease management measures for effective control of Cercospora leaf spot of sesame that can be used worldwide.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nShagun Sinha is thankful to the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi, India, for the Senior Research Fellowship (SRF) and the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and the British Council for Newton-Bhabha PhD placement fellowship 2019-2020.
