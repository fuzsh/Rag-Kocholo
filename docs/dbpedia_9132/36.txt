German East Africa (Deutsch-Ostafrika)

German East Africa (GEA) was an area of Africa colonised by Germany between 1884 and 1919. It comprised Burundi, Rwanda and Tanganyika (now Tanzania). Germany acquired control of the area by treaties with coastal chiefs in 1884. After World War I it was entrusted to Great Britain as a league of Nations mandate, and after World War II as a United Nations trust territory. There were treaties with local chiefs, and some gunboat diplomacy.

German East Africa Coins

The currency of German East Africa was the Rupie. As the colony was only in existence for approximately 30 years, it is not surprising that we don't see many of it's coins.
