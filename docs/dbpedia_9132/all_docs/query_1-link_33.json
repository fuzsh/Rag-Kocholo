If any Government should default on any payment due under this paragraph, the amount in default may be recovered from any subsequent payment due to that Government out of the Surplus Account as provided in Article 5 of this Agreement.\n\nProvided that:\n\n(a) if on the last day in any year the face value of the currency notes and current coin in circulation exceeds the value of the Fund calculated in accordance with Article 3(7) of this Agreement there shall be paid into the Fund the whole of the said surplus in the Income Account or such part thereof as shall make up the monies of the Fund as aforesaid to an amount equal to the face value of the currency notes and current coin in circulation; and\n\n(b) if on the last day in any year the value of the Fund so calculated exceeds one hundred and ten per centum of the face value of the currency notes and current coin in circulation the Board may with the sanction of the Secretary of State direct:\n\ni. that the whole or part of the excess over one hundred and ten per centum shall be transferred from the Fund to the Income Account: and\n\nii. that the annual appropriation out of the Income Account of the one per centum aforesaid shall be wholly or partially discontinued for so long as it shall appear that the necessity for such annual appropriation no longer exists.\n\n5. (1) There shall be set up a British Caribbean Territories (Eastern Group) (Currency Surplus) Account, into which shall be paid any surplus in the Income Account arising as provided in Article 4.\n\n(2) The participating Governments shall be entitled to share in the Surplus Account according to the following scale:\n\nProvided that if; on the expiration of a period of two years of the quinquennial period commencing from the first day of January, 1951, a new scale is agreed upon that new scale should be substituted for the above and shall remain in force until the end of the quinquennial period; but provided further that if at the end of any such quinquennial period no such agreement is reached the scale then in force shall continue in operation for the next quinquennial period.\n\n(3) Each of the participating Governments shall authorize from time to time the Board to pay out of its share of the sums standing to the credit of the Surplus Account its share of such charges in addition to the charges referred to in Article 4 of this Agreement as the Governments may from time to time agree should be so paid.\n\n(4) Any balance remaining in the Surplus Account to the credit of any participating Government at the end of any year after the payment of any charges as provided in paragraph (3) of this Article shall be paid to that Government on demand.\n\n6. (1) If the assets of the Fund should at any time prove inadequate to meet legal demands upon the Board for the conversion of currency into sterling, each participating Government shall be liable to meet any deficiency in the Fund.\n\n(2) If the value of the Fund calculated as provided in Article 3(7) shall at any time be less than the face value of the currency notes and current coin in circulation and in the opinion of the Secretary of State it shall be necessary to make up such deficiency in the Fund either wholly or partly each participating Government shall be liable for the sum which in the opinion of the Secretary of State is required to be paid into the Fund.\n\n(3) Any liability under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article shall be apportioned between the participating Governments according to the scale prescribed in Article 5 (2).\n\n(4) Should one or more of the participating Governments make default in respect of the above imposed obligation the other participating Governments shall be liable to make good such default each in the proportion which its liability as set out in the scale bears to the total liability of such non-defaulting Governments. Provided that in the event of a default being so made good any sums due thereafter to the defaulting Government or Governments from the Surplus Account shall be paid to the Governments which have made good such defaults in the like proportions until the amount so made good by them has been refunded.\n\n7. (1) The Accounts of all transactions of the Board shall be audited once in every year by such persons and in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary of State may prescribe.\n\n(2) An abstract of such Accounts shall be as soon as may be after such audit published in the Gazette of each participating Government.\n\n(3) The Board shall on the first day of each month make up and as soon as may be thereafter published in the Gazette of each participating Government, an abstract showing the whole amount of currency notes in circulation on the said day and the average amount in circulation during the previous month.\n\n(4) The Board shall also publish half yearly in the Gazette of each participating Government an abstract showing:\n\n(a) the amount of the liquid portion of the Fund;\n\n(b) the nominal value and price paid for and the latest known market price of the securities belonging to the Fund.\n\n(5) The amount of notes in circulation at a particular date shall be deemed to be the total nominal amount of notes issued prior to that date by the Board after deducting the total nominal amount of notes received by the Board prior to that date.\n\n(6) The said abstracts shall from time to time and at least once a quarter be verified by a Board of Survey appointed in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary of State may prescribe.\n\n8. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago, having undertaken to advance such funds as may be necessary to repay preliminary expenses and initial expenditure in connection with the establishment of the unified currency, the Board shall reimburse the Government of Trinidad and Tobago the amount of such advances.\n\n9. Any dispute arising from the interpretation of this Agreement shall be referred to the Secretary of State whose decision shall be final and binding on all the Governments concerned.\n\n(b) British Guiana Law Enacting Above\n\nAn Ordinance to implement an agreement to provide for a uniform currency in the Eastern Group of the British Caribbean territories.
