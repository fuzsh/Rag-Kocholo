Rwanda used the currency of Belgian Congo until 1960, when the Rwanda and Burundi franc was introduced. Rwanda began issuing its own francs in 1964. There are plans to introduce a common currency, a new East African shilling, for the five member states of the East African community.\n\nSource: Wikipedia"
