        "text": "Reissued with obsolete COVID-19 page links removed.\n\nExercise increased caution when traveling to Turkey due to terrorism and arbitrary detentions. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.\n\nDo Not Travel To:\n\nSirnak province, Hakkari province, and any area within six miles (10 kilometers) of the Syrian border due to terrorism.\n\nCountry Summary: Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Turkey. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, local government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, and other public areas.\n\nSecurity forces have detained tens of thousands of individuals, including U.S. citizens, for alleged affiliations with terrorist organizations based on scant or secret evidence and grounds that appear to be politically motivated. U.S. citizens have also been subject to travel bans that prevent them from departing Turkey. Participation in demonstrations not explicitly approved by the Government of Turkey, as well as criticism of the government (including on social media), can result in arrest.\n\nRead the country information page for additional information on travel to Turkey.\n\nIf you decide to travel to Turkey:\n\nStay alert in locations frequented by tourists.\n\nAvoid demonstrations and crowds.\n\nStay at hotels with identifiable security measures.\n\nMonitor local media and be prepared to adjust your plans quickly.\n\nEnroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive travel alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.\n\nFollow the Department of State on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nReview the Country Security Report for Turkey.\n\nVisit the CDC page for the latest Travel Health Information related to your travel.\n\nPrepare a contingency plan for emergency situations.

Terrorist attacks, including suicide bombings, ambushes, car bomb detonations, and improvised explosive devices, as well as shootings, and illegal roadblocks leading to violence have occurred in these areas. U.S. government employees are subject to travel restrictions in the entire provinces of Sirnak and Hakkari, and any areas within 10 km of the Syrian border.\n\nVisit our website for Travel to High-Risk Areas.\n\nVisit the Embassy of the Republic of Turkey website for the most current visa and residency permit information.\n\nIn Turkey, contact the nearest Directorate General of Migration Management office to obtain a residence permit.\n\nObey all Turkish visa regulations and maintain valid residence permits at all times. The U.S. Embassy is unable to assist with Turkish immigration or visa-related matters. Turkish authorities enforce immigration laws.\n\nPassports must be valid for six months beyond your entry date.

Visit “Living in Turkey” on the U.S. Embassy’s website.\n\nSyria: See the Syria travel advisory. The U.S. Embassy in Damascus suspended operations in February 2012. The Department of State continues to warn U.S. citizens against all travel to Syria. At this time, the Turkey-Syria border is closed except in cases of urgent medical treatment or safety from immediate danger as defined by the Government of Turkey.\n\nIraq: See the Iraq travel advisory. The Department of State continues to warn U.S. citizens against all travel to Iraq. The Turkish Government tightly controls entry and exit on the border.\n\nHIV/AIDS restrictions: The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Turkey.\n\nFind information on dual nationality, prevention of international child abduction and customs regulations on our websites.\n\nTerrorism: The potential for terrorist attacks in Turkey, including against U.S. citizens and interests, remains high.\n\nTerrorists have previously attacked U.S. interests in Turkey, including the U.S. Embassy in Ankara, the U.S. Consulate General in Istanbul, and the U.S. Consulate in Adana.\n\nTerrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Turkey. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, local government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, and other public areas. Terrorists have also previously targeted Western tourists and expatriates.\n\nUnder laws passed in 2018, Turkish security forces have an expanded legal ability to stop and search individuals and to detain individuals without charge.\n\nFor your own safety:\n\nCarry a passport or identity document at all times.\n\nFollow local news sources during your stay to remain abreast of any potential areas, dates, or times of concern.\n\nExercise caution and good judgment, keep a low profile, and maintain a high level of vigilance.\n\nAvoid demonstrations, which may become violent and unpredictable.\n\nObey the instructions of Turkish security personnel at all times.\n\nThere have also been threats and acts of violence targeting religious minorities, groups, institutions, and places of worship in Turkey. The level of anti-Israeli and anti-Semitic sentiment remains significant.\n\nProtests and gatherings: Public gatherings are common in Turkey and can include protests or demonstrations, holiday celebrations, family events, sporting events, and political events in the lead up to elections and following the announcement of election results. U.S. citizens should\n\nAvoid demonstrations and gatherings, as they may become violent and unpredictable.\n\nBe aware celebratory gunfire is common in some areas and has resulted in deaths in recent years.\n\nFollow local authorities instructions, police may take action to disperse the group, including possibly using teargas or detaining participants, even when the government has approved gatherings.\n\nCrime: Overall street crime in Turkey is low; however, you should use the same precautions you would take in the United States. The following types of crime have been reported in Turkey:\n\nPick-pocketing, purse snatching, and mugging. Carry only necessary items when in tourist areas.\n\nResidential crime occurs more often in major cities, with criminals targeting ground floor apartments for theft.\n\nSexual assault has occurred in Turkish baths (hamams) or spas, in taxis, and when traveling alone at night. Assaults involving date rape drugs have also been reported.\n\nConfidence schemes occur where travelers are tricked into ordering food or drinks at a restaurant, and then are charged incredibly high prices. Patronize well-established restaurants and ask to see a menu with prices before ordering anything.\n\nScams are common in Turkey, particularly internet scams involving people who met online. Typically, the person in Turkey asks the other person to wire large sums of money to provide financial assistance. Do not send money to someone you have never met in person. Exercise due diligence when purchasing jewelry, rugs, or real estate. See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information on scams.\n\nEastern and Southeastern Turkey: We strongly recommend that U.S. citizens reconsider travel to specific areas in eastern and southeastern Turkey, and do not travel to areas near the Syrian or Iraqi borders.\n\nU.S. Government employees are subject to travel restrictions to the provinces of Batman, Bingol, Bitlis, Diyarbakir, Gaziantep, Hakkari, Hatay, Kilis, Mardin, Sanliurfa, Siirt, Sirnak, Tunceli and Van. Mount Ararat, in Agri province, is a special military zone, and access permission must be obtained before coming to Turkey from a Turkish Embassy or Consulate.\n\nThe following incidents and activities have taken place in eastern and southeastern Turkey:\n\nTerrorist attacks: Terrorist groups, including Da’esh, also referred to as The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) or The Islamic State of Iraq and ash Sham (ISIS), and the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers’ Party), have conducted large-scale attacks in the area, including suicide bombings, ambushes, and the detonation of car bombs, improvised explosive devices, and other homemade weapons. The PKK has attacked Turkish military and police personnel in the eastern and southeastern provinces, occasionally harming bystanders.\n\nRestricted access: Turkish security forces control access to the southeastern provinces of Hakkari, Mardin and Sirnak along the Iraqi border, and the entire Turkey-Syria border. Do not photograph or video Turkish military operations or attempt to enter military installations anywhere in Turkey.\n\nShootings: Turkish towns located along the border with Syria have been struck by bullets and artillery rounds that originate in Syria, some resulting in deaths or injuries.\n\nRoadblocks: Use commercial air travel whenever possible while traveling to southeastern Turkey. If road travel is necessary, drive only during daylight hours and on major highways. The Turkish Jandarma (rural police) monitors checkpoints on roads. Cooperate if stopped at a checkpoint. Be prepared to provide identification and vehicle registration. Remain calm, do not make any sudden movements, and obey all instructions. We strongly discourage the use of public transportation in the southeastern region.\n\nDemonstrations: Violent clashes have taken place between Kurdish groups and Turkish police resulting from organized demonstrations.\n\nCurfews: The Turkish Government has instituted temporary curfews in cities throughout the southeast due to blockades of certain neighborhoods by the PKK. Adhere to any locally imposed curfews.\n\nVictims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police by dialing 155 and contact the U.S. Embassy or nearest consulate. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime. See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas. We urge U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault to contact the U.S. Embassy or closest consulate.\n\nWe can:\n\nhelp you find appropriate medical care\n\nassist you in reporting a crime to the police\n\ncontact relatives or friends with your written consent\n\nProvide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion.\n\nprovide a list of local attorneys\n\nprovide our information on victim’s compensation programs in the U.S.\n\nprovide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution\n\nhelp you find resources for accommodation and flights home\n\nreplace a stolen or lost passport\n\nDomestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance and visit the Embassy webpage for resources.\n\nTourism: The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules with regard to best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.\n\nCriminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.\n\nAlways carry with you a form of official government photo identification, such as a residence permit or copy of your passport.\n\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website.\n\nArrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. Turkish authorities may not inform U.S. officials of dual nationals arrested in Turkey. See our webpage for further information on arrests.\n\nInsulting the State: It is illegal to show disrespect to the name or image of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, or to insult the Turkish Government, flag, President, or security forces, including on social media. Erase any sensitive photos, comments, or other materials from your social media pages, cameras, laptops, and other electronic devices that could be considered controversial or provocative.\n\nDrug offenses: Turkish law enforcement is very aggressive in combating illegal drugs. Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking of illegal drugs are very strict, and include heavy fines and jail sentences between four and 20 years.\n\nCultural artifacts: Turkish law has a broad definition of “antiquities” and makes it a crime to remove any from the country. If you buy antiquities, use authorized dealers and get museum certificates for each item. Failure to have a receipt and certificate at departure can result in your arrest, and jail time. Contact the Embassy of the Republic of Turkey in Washington for specific information regarding customs requirements.\n\nDual citizenship: U.S.-Turkish dual nationals may be subject to laws that impose special obligations or hardships on Turkish citizens.\n\nMale dual nationals over the age of 18 may be subject to Turkish conscription and compulsory military service. Consult officials at Turkish Embassies or Consulates with any questions before entering Turkey.\n\nCounterfeit goods: Do not buy counterfeit or pirated goods, even if widely available. They are both illegal to bring back into the United States and to purchase locally.\n\nReligious proselytizing: There is no law against religious proselytizing.\n\nFaith-Based Travelers: See our following webpages for details:\n\nFaith-Based Travel Information\n\nInternational Religious Freedom Report – see country reports\n\nHuman Rights Report – see country reports\n\nHajj Fact Sheet for Travelers\n\nBest Practices for Volunteering Abroad\n\nLGBTI Travelers: Homophobia, transphobia, and intolerance towards homosexuality are widespread throughout Turkey. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) individuals are not protected by anti-discrimination laws and have been the targets of violence in recent years. References in the law relating to “offenses against public morality,” “protection of the family,” and “unnatural sexual behavior,” are sometimes used as a basis for abuse by law enforcement officials. In addition, the law states that “no association may be founded for purposes against law and morality,” a clause which has been used by authorities in attempts to shut down or limit the activities of associations working on LGBTI matters.\n\nSee our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details.\n\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: The Turkish constitution prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities in the provision of state services, employment, education and access to health care. However, access to buildings and public transportation for the disabled in most cities is quite limited, and generally, accessibility for people with disabilities in Turkey is poor. Airports and metro stations are typically accessible, but other forms of public transport (buses) are not.\n\nStudents: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips.\n\nWomen Travelers: The Embassy is aware of multiple sexual assaults against U.S. citizens in Turkey, including assaults against tourists traveling alone or in small groups, and at spas and hamams.\n\nIf you are sexually assaulted, please seek immediate help from the Turkish National Police, Turkish Health Services, or nearest hospital if you feel safe doing so.\n\nWe urge you to contact the closest U.S. Embassy or Consulate for assistance.\n\nSee our travel tips for Women Travelers.\n\nEarthquakes: Earthquakes occur throughout Turkey. Make contingency plans and leave emergency contact information with family members outside Turkey. General information about natural disaster preparedness is available from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and at Ready.gov. For more information on disaster preparedness, please click on the following links:\n\nU.S. Geological Survey (USGS)\n\nFEMA: Earthquakes\n\nFEMA for Kids: Emergency Preparedness\n\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Earthquake Preparedness\n\nMedical care provided in Turkish hospitals varies greatly. Though new private hospitals in Ankara, Antalya, Izmir and Istanbul have modern facilities, equipment, numerous U.S.-trained specialists, and international accreditation, some still may be unable to treat certain serious conditions. Health care standards are lower in small cities in Turkey.\n\nWe do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.\n\nMedical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance overseas.\n\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\n\nIf traveling with prescription medication, check with the government of Turkey to ensure the medication is legal in Turkey. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. Some medications may be unavailable in Turkey.\n\nFor U.S. citizens who live in Turkey, please see the Embassy’s website for information on the Turkish General Health Insurance (GHI) law. If you are considering enrolling in Turkish GHI, carefully research what is and is not covered. Once you enroll in GHI, your coverage can only be cancelled if your residence permit expires or if you no longer reside in Turkey.\n\nVaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nFurther health information:\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)"
