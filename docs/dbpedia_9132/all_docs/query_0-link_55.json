        "text": "Stipends are paid in two parts, one after each successful evaluation. The dates below are based on the standard 12 week project. If your project is longer, your evaluation and payments schedule will be different. The first evaluation will occur at the halfway point of your project (e.g. For a 16 week project the evaluation will occur after week 8). You can also check your GSoC dashboard to view when your evaluations occur.\n\nFirst Evaluation (paid July 15): 45%\n\nFinal Evaluation (paid September 3): 55%\n\nStipend amounts are calculated based on your location.\n\nHow is my location determined?\n\nYour location is determined by the country where you are residing during the GSoC 2024 coding period.\n\nHow are the stipend amounts determined?\n\nWe are using a Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) based calculation to determine the stipend.\n\nFor medium sized projects: We start with a base amount of 3000 USD and then adjust it based on each country's PPP value. There is a minimum (1500 USD) and maximum (3300 USD) stipend amount.\n\nFor large sized projects: We start with a base amount of 6000 USD and then adjust it based on each country's PPP value. There is a minimum (3000 USD) and maximum (6600 USD) stipend amount.\n\nFor small sized projects: Google starts with a base amount of 1500 USD and then adjust it based on each country's PPP value. There is a minimum (750 USD) and maximum (1650 USD) stipend amount.\n\nWhat is Purchasing Power Parity? (PPP)\n\nPurchasing Power Parity is a way to estimate the exchange rate between two currencies to determine equivalent purchasing power.\n\nWikipedia: Purchasing Power Parity\n\nWorld Bank: Fundamentals of Purchasing Power Parity\n\nTotal Stipend Amount\n\nAll amounts in USD"
