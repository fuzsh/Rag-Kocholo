        "text": "Travelling to Burundi?\n\nGet the best rates for Burundian currency online.\n\nPrepare for your trip to Burundi and order your Burundian francs at Manor FX today.\n\nBenefit from our competitive exchange rates and get more Burundian francs for your money.\n\nYou can opt for convenient home or office delivery of your Burundian franc banknotes or collect them from the Manor FX bureau near Heathrow.\n\nManor FX guarantees rapid delivery and a straightforward online process to order your Burundian franc travel money.\n\nBurundian travel money\n\nAre you getting ready for your journey through the Kibira National Park, a haven for wildlife and lush forest landscapes? Here are some useful insights about using cash and cards to make payments in Burundi.\n\nWho uses the Burundian franc?\n\nThe Burundian franc is the official currency in Burundi.\n\nCan you buy Burundian francs in the UK?\n\nYes, you can buy Burundian francs in the UK, but as a minor currency it’s harder to find.\n\nAvoid the hassle of visiting an exchange bureau by ordering your travel money through Manor\n\nFX.\n\nBenefit from our quick and safe delivery service and have your Burundian francs sent directly to your doorstep via Royal Mail Special Delivery.\n\nWhere can you get Burundian francs?\n\nBuying Burundian francs (BIF) in the UK might be challenging.\n\nNot all foreign exchange offices or banks in the UK offer this less common currency.\n\nIf you want to buy Burundian francs, our bureau de change in Datchet offers great rates.\n\nBenefit from free home delivery if your order totals over £750 or pick up your Burundian francs in-store.\n\nShould I exchange money before I travel to Burundi?\n\nCertainly! It’s wise to have Burundian francs ready for use upon your arrival in Burundi.\n\nAlthough it’s possible to exchange money once you get there, exchanging some beforehand can save you time and hassle.\n\nThis ensures you have cash available for immediate needs such as transport and small purchases, making your travel experience smoother right from the start.\n\nDoes Burundi accept US dollars?\n\nYes, US dollars are widely accepted in Burundi, especially in tourist areas and hotels and for larger transactions like safaris.\n\nWhat is the best currency to take to Burundi?\n\nWhen travelling to Burundi, it’s advisable to carry both local and international currencies.\n\nThe Burundian franc is the primary currency, but US dollars are frequently used, particularly for larger purchases like safaris. Safari companies, lodges, and other tourist services often prefer payments in USD.\n\nAlways verify payment preferences with your chosen service providers beforehand. To make your trip more convenient, it is recommended that you have Burundian francs for daily expenses and US dollars for activities such as tours.\n\nIt’s also recommended to carry newer and undamaged US dollar bills since older or worn notes might not be accepted.\n\nCan I use my bank card in Burundi?\n\nYes, you can use your bank card in Burundi. Major credit and debit cards like Visa and Mastercard are commonly accepted in the country’s urban centres.\n\nHowever, in more rural or safari areas, it is advisable to use cash, either in US dollars or Burundian francs, as the economy largely operates on cash transactions.\n\nDo you need cash in Burundi?\n\nWhile places in Burundi accept cards, cash payment is preferable in BIF or USD.\n\nHaving Burundian francs on hand can be helpful when visiting smaller towns, local markets, or remote areas of the country.\n\nReminder: Bring clean 50 USD and 100 USD notes from the newest series. Small denominations of Burundian francs are also great, as it can be challenging to get change for larger bills in some places.\n\nOnce you return from your travels, remember to convert your leftover US dollars and Burundian francs to GBP with us.\n\nIs it better to use cash or a credit card in Burundi?\n\nWhether using cash or credit cards in Burundi, having a mix of both can be handy.\n\nIn Burundi’s major cities and tourist hubs, credit cards are handy for covering significant expenses such as hotel stays and dining out.\n\nYet, for everyday transactions like shopping at local markets, tipping, and smaller vendors that don’t accept cards, carrying Burundian francs is essential. This is particularly true in more secluded or rural areas where cash is necessary.\n\nBalancing credit cards for convenience with cash for smaller, local transactions offers the most flexibility during travels.\n\nHow can I avoid ATM fees in Burundi?\n\nTo minimise ATM fees in Burundi, use ATMs from major banks for better rates and fewer fees, withdraw large sums less frequently to reduce transaction fees, and check if your bank has partnerships with local banks for fee-free withdrawals.\n\nAlways notify your bank of your travel plans to avoid additional charges, and lastly, research your bank’s fees for international transactions to avoid surprises.\n\nIs Burundi a cheap country to visit?\n\nCertainly! Burundi is an economical destination, offering low living and travel costs compared to many Western nations.\n\nAccommodation, meals, transport, and various activities are available at attractive prices, which can help extend your travel budget.\n\nThe country’s breathtaking landscapes, diverse wildlife, and rich cultural scenes make it a great value for money, ensuring a memorable and affordable travel experience.\n\nHow much money do you need per day in Burundi?\n\nOn average, budget-conscious travellers to Burundi should consider allocating about 120,000-190,000 BIF (£25 to £40) daily for essentials like meals, travel, and lodging.\n\nThose preferring mid-range comforts might spend approximately 405,000 BIF (£85) each day, covering food and transportation costs.\n\nFor a luxurious experience, around 800,000 BIF (£170) per day would suffice for premium accommodations, gourmet dining, and exclusive activities such as private tours and spa visits.\n\nAlways plan for extra funds to accommodate any unplanned expenditures or special experiences.\n\nHow does tipping work in Burundi?\n\nTipping is optional but appreciated in Burundi. Consider tipping 5-10% of the bill in restaurants, but check for service charges first. For tour guides and drivers, $5 to $10 per person daily is typical, depending on service quality.\n\nA small tip, around $1 to $2, shows gratitude for hotel housekeeping or bellhops and taxi drivers or porters who assist with luggage.\n\nBurundian currency\n\nBanknotes in Burundi\n\nThe banknotes in Burundi are the 2015 series issued by the Bank of the Republic of Burundi. Older banknotes are no longer in circulation.\n\nThe Burundian franc banknotes in circulation are 500 francs, 1,000 francs, 2,000 francs, 5,000 francs, 10,000 francs, and 20,000 francs BIF.\n\nThe banknotes are thoughtfully designed, showcasing important national landmarks and the country’s rich fauna.\n\nCoins in Burundi\n\nBurundian coins range from 1 franc to 500 francs. The bi-metallic 500 franc coin is used alongside the 500 franc banknote.\n\nBurundi’s currency import and export regulations\n\nYou can bring Burundian francs and foreign currency into the country without specific limits. However, if you’re carrying an amount equivalent to $10,000 or more, you’ll need to declare it upon arrival.\n\nReview currency regulations closely before your trip to ensure a seamless experience with your finances while travelling.\n\nOrdering Burundian francs online\n\nExchange your pounds for Burundian francs easily online and receive them swiftly and securely at your home or office using Royal Mail Special Delivery Guaranteed®.\n\nAlternatively, collect your currency from our travel money outlet near Heathrow.
