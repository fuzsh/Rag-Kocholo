It’s also well worth comparing some providers based on transfer times, as the delivery time can also vary pretty widely.\n\nSome international money transfer services offer discounts for high value transfers, either through lower fees or a better exchange rate. Use the Exiap cost comparison calculator to make sure you’re getting the very best deal available for your specific transfer.\n\nHow to send large amounts of money to Burundi\n\nWhile sending a high value payment works very similarly to sending any other transfer overseas, the provider may require additional information to verify the payment. You might be asked to prove the source of the funds, for example, to comply with local and international financial services legislation. If you’re sending a large amount of money you’ll also need to make sure the provider you’ve picked can support the amount, as maximum payment limits may apply.\n\nHere’s how to send a large sum of money internationally with a specialist international money transfer service:\n\n1\n\nCreate an account\n\nRegister a new account with your preferred service\n\n2\n\nVerify\n\nVerify your account by uploading an image of your ID documents\n\n3\n\nAdd the transfer information\n\nIncluding the value and currency\n\n4\n\nAdd recipient details\n\nAdd your recipient’s personal and bank account details\n\n5\n\nFund your payment\n\nMake a local bank transfer, use your card or pick another supported payment method. Your money will be on the move as soon as it’s been received by the provider.\n\nSafest way to send money from Australia to Burundi\n\nThe safest way to send money to Burundi is to select a provider which is properly registered and regulated both in Australia and Burundi. There are many global regulators around the world, and it’s common for international money transfer providers to be registered and regulated by dozens of different bodies, depending on where they operate.\n\nIn Australia for example, you’ll usually find providers are registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and they may also need to hold a state license depending on how they’re set up.\n\nInternational money transfer limits to Burundi\n\nThere is no legal limit on how much money can be sent to or from Australia, although banks and other payment providers may impose their own limits. Money transfer limits can vary quite widely between providers, and may also change depending on how you want to fund your transfer. You could find different limits in place when you pay by card compared to paying using a bank transfer, for example.\n\nAUD/BIF exchange rate trends\n\nAs with many currencies, the AUD/BIF exchange rate moves over time, due to changes in supply and demand. Exchange rate fluctuations can be caused by underlying shifts in how well the economy in Australia or Burundi is doing, changes in political stability, or even simple speculation, where traders buy or sell currencies based on how they think trends are going to change.\n\nRight now, 1 Australian Dollar buys 1,924.970 Burundi Franc.\n\nInternational bank transfer fee to Burundi\n\nTo send money to Burundi using one of the international money transfer providers in our tables, the fees range from 18.24 with Remitly to 32.83 with Western Union (but the fee could be even higher with a bank). The exact cost depends a lot on where you’re sending money, how much you’re sending, how you want to pay, and how you want the payment to be received.\n\nTypically sending money directly to a recipient’s bank account using a specialist service can be done with fairly low costs, while traditional bank transfer fees can be higher. Paying for your transfer with either a credit card or cash can often mean the fees crank up, too.\n\nWhen you’re sending money internationally, don’t forget that the overall fee you pay can include the transfer fee, an extra charge wrapped up in the exchange rate used, and third party charges like a cash advance fee from your credit card issuer.\n\nBest money transfer rate to Burundi\n\nThe best rate available to send money to Burundi will usually be the mid-market exchange rate. The mid-market exchange rate is the rate used when banks buy and sell currencies on global markets.\n\nHowever, this rate isn’t always available to individual customers sending money abroad. Instead, providers often add a markup – an extra fee – to the exchange rate they offer customers. This pushes up the costs and makes it harder to see exactly what you’re paying for your international bank transfer.\n\nRight now, the mid-market rate for a Australian Dollar to Burundi Franc is 1,924.970.\n\nHow long does an international bank transfer to Burundi take?\n\nThe length of time it takes to transfer money to Burundi depends on a variety of factors including the provider you use, how you’re paying, and how you want your recipient to get the money in the end.\n\nFrom the providers that we display, the fastest international money transfer provider to Burundi is Remitly, which can deliver the money to your recipient in Burundi in 0-2 Days. The slowest provider to send AUD – BIF is Western Union, which takes 0-2 Days to send money to Burundi.\n\nSend money online with a credit card or debit card\n\nSome specialist international money transfer providers do offer the option to fund transfers with a credit card or debit card. Paying for your transfer with a card can mean your funds are received quickly, so the provider can deposit the payment into the recipient’s account faster. However, this often comes with additional fees which might make it more expensive than paying by bank transfer.\n\nHere’s a handy list of providers that support card payments:\n\nRemitly: Bank transfer, Card (debit or credit), Prepaid Card, Online\n\nWestern Union: Bank transfer, Card (debit or credit), Online\n\nConclusion\n\nWhen it comes to choosing the best provider for sending money to Burundi from Australia, it really depends on what your needs are.\n\nThe cheapest provider shown in our comparison table is Remitly and the fastest is Remitly. If the transfer time is what you're interested in, then Remitly is the fastest to transfer money to Burundi.
