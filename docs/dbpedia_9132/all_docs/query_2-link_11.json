It comprised Burundi, Rwanda and Tanganyika (now Tanzania). Germany acquired control of the area by treaties with coastal chiefs in 1884. After World War I it was entrusted to Great Britain as a league of Nations mandate, and after World War II as a United Nations trust territory. There were treaties with local chiefs, and some gunboat diplomacy.\n\nGerman East Africa Coins\n\nThe currency of German East Africa was the Rupie. As the colony was only in existence for approximately 30 years, it is not surprising that we don't see many of it's coins.\n\nFurther Information\n\nFor more information on German East Africa history and coinage please see our history page.\n\nSpecifications\n\nDenominationDiameterWeightAlloyAMW 1 PesaCopper 10 Heller23Copper-nickel Quarter Rupie192.91600.917 silver0.0859 Half Rupie245.83190.917 silver0.1719 1 Rupie3011.66380.917 silver0.3437\n\nNotes to Table\n\nDenomination = Face Value\n\nDiameter = Diameter in millimetres.\n\nWeight = Standard weight in grams.\n\nAlloy = Fineness of silver content.\n\nAMW = Acutal Metal Weight = Fine Precious metal (silver) content in troy ounces.\n\nPrices & Availability\n\nAll prices on our websites are subject to fluctuation and availability.
