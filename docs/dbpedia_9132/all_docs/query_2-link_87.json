        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am trying to tie in family legend with fact.\n\nBelow is an extract from a piece of writing which records my great uncle's (Jack) memories of my great grandfather time (John Lewis (no middle name)) in the Great War:\n\n*******\n\nHe got married in 1913. Jack was born on August 31 1914, then in 1915 his father went to the war, joining the Royal Engineers. They regarded themselves as 'gentlemen'. Jack remembered him in later life polishing his badge which as on the mantelpiece at home.\n\nHe was very good with horses, and Jack was taken to see him winning a Regimental Championship. He was sent to German East Africa.\n\n(Daar Es Salaam a port used. 2 brigades of the British and Indian troops, sent there from India were defeated there by November 1914, the Huns using ambushes and guerilla warfare afterwards very successfully. Experienced troops were sent there beginning to fight 8 august 1916)\n\nHis wife says he came back a different man - having caught some serious kind of malaria, the bad kind that affects the front of the brain - blackwater fever and dysentery together... he was the only one of his group that survived...\n\n*******\n\nThe way his memories were written down were sketchy as you can see from the footnote. General history seems to be mixed in with specific family information. However, I read it to mean that my great Grandfather, did use the port of Daar Es Salaam...\n\nI have no medals of his (at the moment.) I'm trying to track them down within the family.\n\nI was hoping that from the above information and the picture below that we might be able to ascertain which regiment etc he was in and positively identify his medal card etc, beyond all reasonable doubt.\n\nI found this picture with a load of rubbish at the back of my grandmother's cupboard. I am so glad I found it - she had no idea it was there! You can see my great grandfather's face directly on the left (but one) of the man standing in the foreground.\n\nLook forward to hearing what you think.\n\nSam\n\nThe soldiers in the above photograph are Royal Engineers. Also note the Sergeant's RE grenade above his chevrons. The two men on the extreme left of the previous larger photo do not appear to be sappers nor is the officer.\n\nThe photo is not associated with East Africa and was almost certainly taken in the UK or somewhere in Europe. Given that there are three types of cap badge in the photo, I just wonder if these RE's are members of a Field or Signal Squadron attached to the cavalry. If anybody can identify the cap badges of the two soldiers on the left of the larger photo, and that of the officer, it may provide further clues.\n\nTerry Reeves\n\nHello fellow Derbyshire person\n\nMy grandfather was in 330 Supply Company the ASC in East Africa, arriving via Daar-Es- Salaam - in June 1917 . He also suffered the usual dysentery and malaria - his records are on Ancestry - he was a butcher. He was treated in Masasi and Moroguro. I have no photos of him in uniform but I do have a canvas bound leaflet entitled 'Service Book for Temporary Follower'. This was issued to a Faume Brahimu in March 1918 at a place that looks like Pamelia - I can find no reference for this. He was paid 6 rupees a month by my grandfather for being his 'Boy'. My grandfather is recorded as his employer. Apparently they used to set out into the bush with money and buy cattle from local tribesmen which they then drove back to camp to slaughter.\n\nCan any-one recommend any good backgound reading and source of further information??"
