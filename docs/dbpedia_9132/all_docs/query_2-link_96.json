        "text": "As mentioned above, Sultan Majid bin Said supported missionary work with gifts of land, letters of introduction to inland tribal leaders and general logistical and security support.\n\nIn 1873, the British Consul, Sir Bartle Frere, forced Sultan Seyyid Bargash bid Said, Majid Bin Said’s successor, to close the Zanzibar slave markets effectively shutting down major slave trade in the entire region and tearing down the Zanzibar slave market placing the Anglican Church with its altar directly on the whipping post location.\n\nThe Anti-Slavery Conference of Brussels attempted to ban all slave trade in 1889 but some trade continued particularly between warring mainland tribes. The conference introduced basic rights for slaves, which slave owners had to obey:\n\nThe right to practice religion freely; The right to marry; The right to free food and free housing; The right to have two days a week without any work; The right to be paid for work done; The right to have own possessions; The right to gain a share of the owner’s heritage; The right that families cannot be separated by sale.\n\nAdditionally, Germany and Belgium determined four ways to liberate a slave from slavery in the colony “German East Africa” as\n\nBy purchase; By being released by the owner; By decision of Court; By self-purchase.\n\nDocuments of manumission were created to include the name of the slave, information on place of birth or origin, current residence, age, gender, name of slave owner and the work they did. Copies of official manumission documents were maintained by German colonial district offices and remain a strong source of information.\n\nThe decree of December 31, 1905 determined that children of slaves born after January 1, 1906 would be permanently free within the German East African colonies. Letters of manumission continued to be dated as late as 1915 showing plantation labor as the primary source of slavery along the mainland coast.\n\nStatistics from Bagamoyo alone indicate the following total number of liberated slaves as:\n\nFrom 1870-1879: 1513 slaves\n\nFrom 1880-1889: 758 slaves plus 70 families in 1880\n\nFrom 1890-1899: 1158 slaves\n\nFrom 1900-1920: 203 slaves\n\nFor a total of 3616 slaves plus 70 families. Estimates indicate 234,000 slaves on the mainland for the period so 3616 appears to be a very low percentage. Many, not all, of the freed slaves were baptized with official church documents containing various details including age, status, gender and some notes.\n\nA few examples:\n\nApril 20, 1870 Maria Anna Pascha, 5 months, “lost her parents due to slavery and was then freed by us”\n\nBarbara granted an emergency baptism on June 3, 1876 at the age of 90 years. (Emergency baptisms were often offered to those close to death.)\n\nConstantius Deusdedit, baptized April 2, 1877 was “purchased free by Fredericus and Julius, baptized on Dec 5, 1877, by his godfather of same name Julius”.\n\n1884, entry 9: Henricus freed on January 31, 1884 by Fr. Meves. “His mother, a slave, was publicly burned as a witch. Her son, seven years old, was to suffer same destiny but Fr. Meves could buy him for 3 rupees and took him to the Christian Freedom Village for protection.”\n\n1884, entry 24: Maria Magdalena from Nzole near Bagamoyo “belongs to the Wadoe tribe and came to us at the age of 50. Due to her weakness, we offered her baptism. She agreed, but firstly asked for a tobacco pipe and got baptized after having smoked it. She died a few days later.” (The missionaries understood the Wadoe tribe to smoke or take a pinch of snuff before important ceremonies took place and honored her request.)\n\n1885, entry 49: Dionysia Mlauselle, from the tribe of Wemba, was caught as a slave during her childhood. “She came to us with her son, who was also a slave.” Dionysia was baptized on August 3, 1885 at the age of 19. She married on March 12, 1886 and moved with her husband to the new missionary station Mhonda where she helped establish a Christian parish.\n\n1885, entry 108: David Titoreke, also from the tribe of Wazaramo, was 6 years old when he was baptized on 17th February 1885. He died on August 31, 1888; probably “due to syphilis or leprosy.”\n\n1885, entry 113: Alexina Kitunga, also of the tribe of Wazaramo, was bought and freed on March 29, 1884 and baptized on July 12, 1885. “Because she had burns all over her body, we could purchase her for a little money. She was full of fear because her owner had told her that the white men intended to eat her. She showed her body and said: ‘My flesh is burned and therefore not tasty.’ “\n\n1886, entry 224: Bartholomaus Kocheni was baptized on January 6, 1886. He knew that he had been stolen but did not know by whom.\n\nSimilar entries abound revealing more about the slavery in the region and conditions to which all ages and abilities were taken in by the Bagamoyo Spiritan mission. Other missions have equally compelling documentation as a matter of routine to keep track of their efforts and the souls saved in the name of their religions.\n\nDespite continued efforts by missionaries and governments, slavery was not completely abolished on the East African mainland until 1920.\n\nOther missionaries included Dr. David Livingstone who worked in Africa from 1840-1873. His loyal African companions brought his dead body to the Spiritan missionaries in Bagamoyo on Feb 24, 1874. “It was a day when a group of Africans arrived in great grief. They entered our ground silent and put a body in front of the church door. When one of the Fathers arrived, the leader of the group said: ‘The body of Daudi – the corpse of Dr. Livingstone’ We sent a dhow to Zanzibar immediately for reporting the message to the British consul. The coffin was made in our carpenter’s shop and a few hours later the body of Dr. David Livingstone was at rest in our church. Hundreds of former slaves, men, women and children honoured him with a nightly vigil.” On February 25th, a dhow brought the coffin to Zanzibar and on April 18th Dr. David Livingstone was buried in Westminster Abbey in London.\n\nLivingstone had begun his missionary work on behalf of the London Missionary Society in South Africa and been encouraged to move north to end human trafficking. His first journey to East Africa was in 1852 and, unlike other European explorers of the time, was without fanfare or large caravan preferring to be accompanied by only a few men. Already on his first journey, he saw cotton fields and knowing the demand for cotton from his textile work near Glasgow as a young man a vision grew in him: “To open the spirit of the Africans for Christianity a trade with them need to begin. The prospects are better than expected. I hope the production of raw material for our factories will link the African and English interests and I hope both sides benefit from this. Anti-slavery agitation will also benefit from this.”\n\nThus, Livingstone developed his ‘3-C-Concept’: “Commerce, Christianity, Civilisation”. As a prolific reporter back to the developed world, Livingstone inspired many missions and actions to abolish slavery. In Zanzibar, he described the central slave market in 1866 as “I found nearly 300 slaves on this market being put up for auction like cattle. The bidders examine the teeth and lift their clothes to see their legs, then they throw a stick away so that the slave can bring it back thereby showing his way of walking. The bidders also palpitate the muscles of the slaves. Female slaves were brought to a cabin to be examined there.”\n\nThese observations fortified the abolishment of slavery as he intended. “If my reports can contribute to abolishing this horrible slave trade then this will mean much more to me than having found the springs of the Nile.” Dr. Livingstone died on May 1, 1873 some distance from the coast. The doctor, Matthew Wellington, took out his heart and intestines and buried them at the spot where he died. The body was mummified and loyal servants carried it to Bagamoyo and the coast.\n\nTo the present day, the old tower of the first church on the grounds of the Catholic Parish in Bagamoyo is called “Livingstone Tower.” The interior reminds of “all missionaries who did all one can do for the welfare of all East Africans.” Both Fr. Anton Horner and Dr. David Livingstone are remembered on site.\n\nIn 2009, the Catholic Parish of Bagamoyo interviewed descendants of slaves and descendants of slave owners to document family stories and lore. Ranging in age from 42-109, some had first-person memories and others recalled stories of parents and grandparents. All are available for review, but the effort shows the continued presence of the Spiritan mission to guide and heal more than a century later. Additionally, the Mission is dedicated to continued efforts to abolish human trafficking of all forms throughout East Africa as are many other missions in the region."
