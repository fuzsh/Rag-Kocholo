The Fund believes that these papers will be found helpful by government officials, by professional economists, and by others concerned with monetary and financial problems. Much of what is now presented is quite provisional. On some international monetary problems, final and definitive views are scarcely to be expected in the near future, and several alternative, or even conflicting, approaches may profitably be explored. The views presented in these papers are not, therefore, to be interpreted as necessarily indicating the position of the Executive Board or of the officials of the Fund.”",

        "text": "Original organization and functions\n\nCurrency matters in former British colonies were under the authority of the U.K. Government and were the responsibility of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. The Secretary of State issued the regulations governing the operations of currency boards and appointed their individual members and Secretary. Usually they were officials from the Colonial Office, the Office of the Crown Agents, and the Treasury. Unlike most other British currency boards, neither the East African Currency Board nor the West African Currency Board was situated in the area in which its currency circulated, but in London. Both boards acted directly, rather than through the Crown Agents, with whom they were, however, connected.\n\nWithin its area, EACB was responsible for minting coins, printing currency notes, and fixing the denominations of coins and notes. EACB’s principal task was, on demand, to issue at its main offices in the constituent territories notes or coins in exchange for equivalent values in sterling1 lodged with it in London and to pay sterling in London equivalent to the value of currency notes or coins offered to its offices in the constituent territories. For these services, EACB was entitled to charge a commission, variable at its discretion but not to exceed ½ per cent. It could also fix and vary minimum amounts for its transactions.\n\nProfits of EACB, i.e., revenue after deduction of all expenses and of any contributions it made to the constituent territories, were to be credited to the currency reserve fund; losses were to be debited to this fund. EACB was allowed to invest its funds in public sterling securities or in such other manner as approved by the Secretary of State. The extent of investments was left to the discretion of EACB, but it was obliged to hold, subject to any directions from the Secretary of State, a sufficient proportion of its reserves in a liquid form.\n\nPeriodically, it had to submit to the Secretary of State a statement of the position of the currency reserve fund on the last day of each half year, including a statement of securities. It also had to publish in the government gazettes of the constituent territories statements of the East African currency notes and coins in circulation and the total amount of the currency reserve fund, as well as the nominal value, the actual cost, and the latest known market price of the securities that formed part of the currency reserve fund. Subject to the approval of the Secretary of State, EACB was allowed to distribute appropriate parts of its income to the constituent territories. The accounts for all its transactions were subject to audit by the Colonial Audit Department.\n\nThus, EACB operated like all other British currency boards as an automatic money changer. It issued legal tender locally on demand against payment of sterling in London and redeemed the local currency on demand by paying out sterling. In this sense, it provided the equivalent of a pure gold coin standard, the coins, however, being sterling rather than gold. It had no control over the quantity of currency in circulation, which was determined by changes in the balance of payments position of the constituent territories. Therefore it could not follow independent monetary, credit, or balance of payments policies. It had some discretion in the selection of investments provided that the securities chosen were gilt-edged public securities expressed in a sterling area currency and could be easily sold on the London market. Though not expressly prohibited by its Regulations, EACB followed the accepted practice of other currency boards and did not invest in securities issued by the constituent territories it served until 1955, when the Regulations were amended.\n\nWhile EACB had authority to deal with any person (provided the minimum limits per transaction set by it were adhered to), in practice it dealt almost exclusively with the commercial banks operating in the East African currency area.\n\nProblems of the early sixties (1960-62)\n\nGeneral economic conditions in East Africa in 1960/61,4 and partly also in 1961/62, were affected by political and other uncertainties. These uncertainties induced an outflow of funds, a decrease in private capital investment, and a drawing down of bank deposits. From the end of June 1960 to the end of June 1961, currency in circulation declined by £EA 1.2 million (Table 3). Part of the decline was due to the withdrawal of East African shillings from the former British Protectorate of Somaliland in 1961.5 The decline would have been even greater had not the capital outflow been financed partly by the commercial banks which reduced their overseas cash holdings and expanded their credits to the private sector. These operations led to a considerable decrease in the liquidity of the commercial banks. To improve this situation, the banks raised their minimum lending rate to 7 per cent in July 1960 and to 8 per cent in October of the same year. Between June 1961 and June 1962, notes and coins in circulation had contracted further by £EA 1.4 million, reflecting the economic slowdown.\n\nTable 3.\n\nEAST African Currency Board: Sight Liabilities and Currency Reserve Fund at End of Period, Annually on June 30, 1956-61 and quarterly 1962-65\n\n(In millions of East African pounds)\n\nSources: East African Currency Board, Report for the Year Ended 30th June, various years, and The Kenya Gazette, various issues.\n\n1The decrease reflects the withdrawal of the East African shilling from Aden.

Because of rounding, figures do not add to the total.\n\nIn order to act as a lender to the banking system in a period of scarce liquidity and to ensure the processing and marketing of crops, EACB asked the Secretary of State in November 1960 for permission to discount and rediscount bills and other appropriate instruments issued in connection with the marketing of specified crops.6 These new powers were granted, subject to the limitation that advances under this type of financing would not exceed £EA 5 million or raise the total fiduciary issue above £EA 25.0 million. In 1960/61, however, rather high ad valorem stamp documentary duties on crop bills in the constituent territories, together with the rate of 7 per cent imposed by EACB, discouraged this type of financing. Therefore, no use was made of this facility until 1961/62, when the commercial banks, for the first time, turned to EACB to obtain financing. Even so, bank borrowing (including rediscounted Treasury bills) did not exceed £EA 0.9 million during this period. Amounts made available during each month and EACB’s holdings of crop-financing paper at the end of each month are shown in Table 4. EACB’s lending to commercial banks remained rather limited for two reasons: First, heavy rains severely affected the harvest of cotton in Uganda and eliminated the need for the wider refinancing that had been anticipated. Second, EACB accepted only the highest standard of paper.\n\nTable 4.\n\nEast African Currency Board: Crop-Financing Advances, Monthly, December 1961-December 1965\n\n(In thousands of East African pounds)\n\nSources: East African Currency Board, Report for the Year Ended 30th June, various years, and data furnished by EACB.\n\nTable 4.\n\nEast African Currency Board: Crop-Financing Advances, Monthly, December 1961-December 1965\n\n(In thousands of East African pounds)\n\n1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 Made available during month Outstanding at end of month Made available during month Outstanding at end of month Made available during month Outstanding at end of month Made available during month Outstanding at end of month Made available during month Outstanding at end of month Jan — — 588 588 1,650 1,200 566 566 3,378 2,853 Feb — — 290 150 — 1,000 — 300 1,610 2,028 Mar — — 100 — — — 1,650 1,000 1,920 1,568 Apr — — — — — — 200 200 1,150 900 May — — — — — — — — 850 850 Jun — — — — — — 750 750 1,010 1,010 Jul — — — — — — 1,650 1,000 1,835 890 Aug — — 1,150 500 450 450 1,250 750 2,030 30 Sep — — — — 63 226 425 425 2,140 2,040 Oct — — — — — 226 385 235 2,350 2,350 Nov — — 50 50 226 200 690 600 1,775 2,095 Dec 160 160 750 — 450 200 3,300 3,200 3,684 2,979\n\nSources: East African Currency Board, Report for the Year Ended 30th June, various years, and data furnished by EACB.\n\nTable 4.\n\nEast African Currency Board: Crop-Financing Advances, Monthly, December 1961-December 1965\n\n(In thousands of East African pounds)\n\n1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 Made available during month Outstanding at end of month Made available during month Outstanding at end of month Made available during month Outstanding at end of month Made available during month Outstanding at end of month Made available during month Outstanding at end of month Jan — — 588 588 1,650 1,200 566 566 3,378 2,853 Feb — — 290 150 — 1,000 — 300 1,610 2,028 Mar — — 100 — — — 1,650 1,000 1,920 1,568 Apr — — — — — — 200 200 1,150 900 May — — — — — — — — 850 850 Jun — — — — — — 750 750 1,010 1,010 Jul — — — — — — 1,650 1,000 1,835 890 Aug — — 1,150 500 450 450 1,250 750 2,030 30 Sep — — — — 63 226 425 425 2,140 2,040 Oct — — — — — 226 385 235 2,350 2,350 Nov — — 50 50 226 200 690 600 1,775 2,095 Dec 160 160 750 — 450 200 3,300 3,200 3,684 2,979\n\nSources: East African Currency Board, Report for the Year Ended 30th June, various years, and data furnished by EACB.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that EACB decided not to apply the concept of territorial allocation to the funds available under its crop financing facility that it used in its lendings to the Governments. Since most of the commercial banks operated in all the constituent territories and funds could move unhampered between the territories, EACB considered it more important to influence their over-all liquidity position than the liquidity position of their branches in the country where produce was, at any particular moment, being harvested and processed. However, limits were placed on borrowings by the individual commercial banks.\n\nTo make borrowing by the commercial banks from the central institution more attractive, EACB in May 1962 lowered its discount rate for crop-financing bills from 7 per cent to 5½ per cent (Table 5). It justified this action by indicating that it did not wish to impose a “penalty rate”7 for crop financing. At the same time EACB said that it would ensure that the funds advanced would be used by the commercial banks to finance crops, and not for working capital, and that the banks had recourse to EACB as a lender of last resort. Simultaneously with the rate reduction by EACB, the commercial banks lowered their minimum overdraft rate from 8 per cent (to which it had been raised in October 1960) to 7 per cent.\n\nTable 5.\n\nEast African Currency Board: Rates of Interest and Exchange Commission, at the End of June, 1955 and 1960-64, and at the End of November 1964\n\n(In per cent)\n\nSources: East African Currency Board, Report for the Year Ended 30th June, various years.\n\n1The exchange commissions in connection with both the buying and the selling rates in Aden remained at ¼ per cent, but a charge of ⅛ per cent was applied for transfers from East Africa to Aden.\n\nTable 5.\n\nEast African Currency Board: Rates of Interest and Exchange Commission, at the End of June, 1955 and 1960-64, and at the End of November 1964\n\n(In per cent)\n\nExchange Commissions on Rediscount Rate for Treasury Bills Rediscount and Advance Rate for Crop Financing Purchases Sales 1955 Jun ¼ ¼ — — 1960 Jun ¼ ¼ — — 1961 Jun ¼ ¼ — 7 1962 Jun ⅛1 ½ per cent above the local tender rates 1963 Jun ⅛1 1964 Jun ⅛1 1964 Nov ⅛1\n\nSources: East African Currency Board, Report for the Year Ended 30th June, various years.\n\n1The exchange commissions in connection with both the buying and the selling rates in Aden remained at ¼ per cent, but a charge of ⅛ per cent was applied for transfers from East Africa to Aden.\n\nTable 5.\n\nEast African Currency Board: Rates of Interest and Exchange Commission, at the End of June, 1955 and 1960-64, and at the End of November 1964\n\n(In per cent)\n\nExchange Commissions on Rediscount Rate for Treasury Bills Rediscount and Advance Rate for Crop Financing Purchases Sales 1955 Jun ¼ ¼ — — 1960 Jun ¼ ¼ — — 1961 Jun ¼ ¼ — 7 1962 Jun ⅛1 ½ per cent above the local tender rates 1963 Jun ⅛1 1964 Jun ⅛1 1964 Nov ⅛1\n\nSources: East African Currency Board, Report for the Year Ended 30th June, various years.\n\n1The exchange commissions in connection with both the buying and the selling rates in Aden remained at ¼ per cent, but a charge of ⅛ per cent was applied for transfers from East Africa to Aden.\n\nEACB’s rediscount rate for Treasury bills or similar bills of the Governments remained at ½ per cent above the current tender rate. The latter was ⅛ per cent below the London Treasury bill rate and moved during the period according to fluctuations in that rate. In 1961/62, rediscounted Treasury bills reached £EA 350,000.\n\nThe downward trend in economic activities also had the effect of reducing government revenue. The Governments, therefore, had more recourse to short-term borrowing from EACB than previously. At the end of December 1960, EACB’s holdings of Treasury bills amounted to £EA 4.2 million; Kenya and Tanganyika had issued almost £EA 2.0 million each. In February 1961 the total holdings, though roughly the same amount, represented different borrowers. EACB’s short-term claims on the Government of Tanganyika amounted to £EA 2.6 million, EACB held no Kenya Treasury bills, and its short-term claims on the Government of Uganda reached almost £EA 1.7 million. Four months later, Treasury bills made up only £EA 2.8 million of the total fiduciary issue of £EA 12.8 million, but by the end of 1961 they had risen again to £EA 6.0 million.\n\nIn this period EACB developed certain guidelines for lending to the Governments, One was to allocate as equitable a share as possible of the fiduciary issue to each Government; another was normally to leave an unused margin within the limit of the authorized fiduciary issue to the Governments so that this amount might be available for exceptional demands and other unforeseen contingencies, as well as for rediscounts of government securities or Treasury bills held by the commercial banks. EACB therefore required that all Governments would have to consult with it before issuing any bonds or bills to it.\n\nEACB also sought an equitable formula for sharing the portion of net income to be distributed to member Governments. It was thought that, in theory, each Government’s share should be equal to the amount of currency circulating in its territory. After the withdrawal of East African shillings from Somalia was completed, EACB reviewed the estimates of currency circulating in the remaining five member territories. It concluded that statistics of issue and redemption for each of the countries were not a sufficient guide for this purpose since trade and capital movements between the territories were allowed freely and physical transfers of currency had taken place on a large scale. It therefore adopted, as more practical and politically more acceptable, a formula giving equal shares to the three mainland territories of nearly 28.2 per cent each, 3.5 per cent to Zanzibar, and 12.0 per cent to Aden. In 1962, EACB distributed £EA 2 million according to this formula (Table 6).\n\nTable 6.\n\nEast African Currency Board: Distribution to Governments from Net Income, Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 1961-651\n\nSources: East African Currency Board, Report for the Year Ended 30th June, various years.\n\n1Payment usually made in the year following the one indicated. Because of rounding, figures do not add to all totals.\n\n2Through 1961, these percentages were calculated by matching the amounts distributed to the Governments, as shown in the EACB’s balance sheet in the years in which actual payment was made, with EACB’s net income as shown in its balance sheet of the previous year, the year for which the distribution to the Governments was intended.

Because of rounding, figures do not add to all totals.\n\n2Through 1961, these percentages were calculated by matching the amounts distributed to the Governments, as shown in the EACB’s balance sheet in the years in which actual payment was made, with EACB’s net income as shown in its balance sheet of the previous year, the year for which the distribution to the Governments was intended. In 1961, the new EACB showed in its balance sheet not only the payment to the Governments of the previous year’s distribution, but also an allocation to a newly created income distribution reserve account. For easier comparison, only the former entry has been used here in calculating the percentage. Starting with 1962, the figures shown in this column present the percentage of EACB’s net income allocated to the income distribution reserve account as shown in each year’s balance sheet.\n\nOnce this new formula was established and accepted, EACB used it also to determine each Government’s share of the fiduciary issue. Thus, from the £EA 20.0 million authorized fiduciary issue to the Governments in 1962, slightly over £EA 5.6 million each was apportioned to Kenya, Uganda, and Tanganyika; £EA 0.7 million to Zanzibar; and £EA 2.4 million to Aden.\n\nIn May 1962, EACB made the first change in its exchange commissions since 1946 (see Table 5). For 16 years the rates for both issues and redemptions of East African shillings against sterling had remained at ¼ per cent. The charge for buying sterling was now set at ⅛ per cent and the charge for selling sterling at ⅜ per cent. EACB’s aim was to create some incentive for traders to return their export proceeds, to encourage the inflow of private investment capital from abroad, and to discourage the outflow of funds from East Africa. While the significance and practical impact of this move should not be overrated, it nevertheless demonstrated a break with EACB’s former inflexible approach. EACB also reserved the right to deal in the exchange market at its discretion. The commercial banks followed EACB in readjusting their charges to the public.\n\nThe considerations prompting EACB to change its commissions and to favor inward remittances did not, however, apply to Aden. There, the exchange market had remained broadly in balance, and the demand for sterling was matched by sufficient demand for East African shillings. It was therefore not necessary to introduce any changes, and the equal issue and redemption commissions of ¼ per cent were kept in force. However, to avoid undesirable arbitrage movements, EACB imposed a ⅛ per cent charge on transfers from East Africa to Aden, which, like other transfers within the currency area, had previously been free of charge.\n\nDevelopment since 1962\n\nAfter the middle of 1962, economic conditions in East Africa improved, partly because of more favorable weather, but also because of a general revival of confidence in East Africa’s economic position and potential. Investment increased somewhat and higher commodity prices led to larger receipts from abroad.\n\nThe downward trend of currency in circulation now reversed, as the end of June figures for 1963 and 1964 show (see Table 3). The amount continued to increase in 1964/65 if allowance is made for the £EA 11.4 million withdrawn from Aden. Without the withdrawal, currency in circulation in June 1965 (actually £EA 60.8 million) would have been £EA 72.2 million, against £EA 68.3 million in June 1964. Superimposed on this persistent upward trend, however, was a recurring pattern of seasonal fluctuations caused mainly by the rhythm of crop seasons. After the middle of the year, currency in circulation usually rises, reaching a peak in December or January. Thereafter, it declines until the next crop season starts, around June. Other events, of course, may weaken or reinforce these natural cycles.\n\nIn the general setting of a reviving economy and encouraged by the continued strong position of EACB and the East African currency, even throughout the years when the pace of economic development had slackened, EACB decided that a further increase in its fiduciary issue would not be inconsistent with prudent currency management. At first, in December 1962, it increased its limits for crop financing through the commercial banks from £EA 5 million to £EA 10 million; then it raised its ceiling for lending to the Governments in 1963 from £EA 20 million to £EA 25 million and again in the fall of 1964 to £EA 35 million, bringing the maximum limit for the total fiduciary issue to £EA 45 million. If full use were made of the new powers, the fiduciary issue could amount to more than 50 per cent of the currency in circulation. At the end of December 1965, however, EACB’s total fiduciary securities actually amounted to £EA 23.8 million, equal to 36 per cent of the total currency in circulation, while external assets represented 76 per cent of the currency issue.\n\nSeasonal and other fluctuations in the Governments’ need for short-term financing can be discerned from EACB’s lending to them after mid-1962 (see Table 2). EACB’s holdings of Treasury bills are usually higher at the end of the year, when the commercial banks are in a less liquid position because their funds are employed in connection with the marketing of crops. Toward the middle of the year, EACB’s Treasury bill holdings decline. For example, its holdings of Treasury bills decreased from £EA 7.4 million at the end of 1963 to £EA 3.8 million by the middle of 1964 but then increased again to £EA 12.3 million at the end of December 1964.\n\nThe rise was especially sharp in the second half of 1964 because of large borrowings by the Governments of Uganda and Tanzania (mainland). The Government of Kenya had not found it necessary to issue Treasury bills since early in 1962 because it had been able to borrow from companies and other sources direct, a sign of a relative abundance of liquid funds in Nairobi. Tanzania (mainland), on the other hand, had borrowed up to the limit by August 1964 and had to approach EACB for permission to borrow beyond its apportioned share. After consultation and careful consideration, EACB permitted the Government of Tanzania to exceed its allotment of the fiduciary issue to the Governments by applying the amount above Tanzania’s mainland share against the unused portions of Kenya and Aden. However, EACB’S increase in the maximum limit of the fiduciary issue to Governments in October 1964 to £EA 35 million brought Tanzania back within the permissible limit with some margin to spare.\n\nLong-term borrowing by the Governments from EACB did not expand after 1962. It totaled £EA 9.7 million on December 31, 1964 and declined to £EA 8.8 million by the end of June 1965, after Aden’s long-term debt had been wiped out in connection with the currency conversion in its territory. EACB has not encouraged long-term borrowing by the Governments because it might tie up resources needed for short-term financing and limit flexibility in monetary policy.\n\nEACB continued after 1962 to distribute part of its profits to the Governments in accordance with the established formula, raising the amount distributed to £EA 2¼ million in 1963/64 and to £EA 2½ million in 1964/65 (see Table 6). Earlier, EACB had decided to help strengthen the financial system in East Africa by providing for the East African Government’s subscriptions to IMF and the World Bank without charging the funds against the credit lines available to the Governments in connection with fiduciary issues. On August 23, 1962 it allocated £EA 1.1 million to cover the Government of Tanganyika’s subscriptions. On the same day, it set aside comparable amounts in a trust fund to cover the other Governments’ gold subscriptions to IMF and the World Bank and its affiliates. When Uganda became a member of IMF and the World Bank in September 1963 and Kenya in February 1964, EACB made available from this trust fund £EA 1.1 million to each Government for payment of its gold subscriptions. A second trust fund was established to provide for the Governments’ subscriptions to the African Development Bank.8 Additional gold payments to IMF, for the 25 per cent general quota increase approved by the Fund’s Board of Governors in March 1965, will also be made out of these trust funds.\n\nDuring this time also, EACB further solidified its relations with the commercial banks, especially in three areas—crop financing, rediscount of Treasury bills for the banks, and operation of clearing settlement accounts.\n\nCrop financing reached a peak in January 1963. During the following crop season, funds made available by EACB for this purpose were somewhat less but were more evenly spread over the crop season (see Table 4). To facilitate these operations, EACB accepted promissory notes from the banks’ customers as security for advances to the banks, and, for discounts, the banks were allowed to tender their own acceptances when customary bills of exchange were not available. EACB continued to urge the Governments to standardize the ad valorem documentary stamp duties on commercial bills.\n\nIn November 1964, EACB lowered its rate for rediscounts and advances in connection with crop financing from 5½ per cent to 5 per cent. It took this step at a time when rates were rising in London. The effect of lower rates in Nairobi than in London was soon apparent. Within a month from the end of November 1964, lending by EACB to banks for crop financing rose from £EA 0.6 million to £EA 3.2 million. Although it declined at the end of the crop season, it remained higher than during earlier comparable periods (see Table 4). By December 1965 it had again risen to £EA 3.0 million. Nevertheless, even at its peak, the amount lent was only a small part of the £EA 10 million which EACB is authorized by its Regulations to lend for crop financing. The limited use made by the commercial banks of this facility is due partly to EACB’s deliberate encouragement of short-term borrowing from abroad during the main crop season. Under a special cover facility, EACB reported that it\n\n… offered the banks an opportunity to cover their net requirements or surpluses of shillings at finer rates at the beginning and at the end of the two main crop seasons. Previously the high cost of bringing funds from overseas and of returning them at the end of a short period of use had militated against the temporary drawing of funds from abroad for seasonal purposes.9\n\nTreasury bills rediscounted by EACB for the commercial banks fluctuated between £EA 300,000 and £EA 600,000 per annum during 1962-65. All transactions were for the benefit of banks operating in Uganda. The amounts of rediscounted Treasury bills were rather small, but EACB attached considerable importance to its readiness and ability to act as a lender of last resort in this way. The rate at which the Board stood ready to rediscount Treasury bills remained unchanged at ½ per cent above the tender rates in the constituent territories.\n\nDuring 1962-65 the number of EACB’s bank customers rose and the operations of their clearing settlement accounts with EACB expanded. These accounts can be used for almost all transactions between the commercial banks and EACB and between the banks themselves. This facility has greatly reduced the necessity of handling and holding cash and has enlarged the resources available to the commercial banks for lending. EACB made it a rule that no commercial bank with an office in one of the capitals of the three mainland territories could obtain any of its services other than those available to the general public unless the bank maintained an account with EACB.\n\nEACB lacked legal authority to oblige the commercial banks to hold a minimum balance in these accounts. It has stated that this authority would have been useful, especially in the last few years, when credit extension has risen and the commercial banks have become increasingly overlent.\n\nOver the years EACB has endeavored to improve its currency services through the establishment of new currency subcenters in various parts of East Africa and on the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba, and through the conclusion of new currency agency arrangements with commercial banks. Under these arrangements the banks have been authorized to hold coins (but not notes) on behalf of EACB. These measures have eliminated unnecessary shipments of coins to and from Nairobi, reducing some of EACB’s costs.\n\nEACB saw no need to alter its general commissions on foreign exchange operations when a temporary spurt in outflow of funds occurred in early 1964 as a result of political events. Until November 1964 the charges had remained unchanged at ⅛ per cent for buying sterling and at ⅜ per cent for selling sterling. On November 25, 1964, in response to the rise of the bank rate in London from 5 per cent to 7 per cent, EACB increased its commission on selling sterling from ⅜ per cent to ½ per cent. As the buying commission remained at ⅛ per cent, the spread between the two rates widened, making it less attractive to send funds to London in search of higher rates. A three-month placement in London would have to earn over 2½ per cent more than the rate in East Africa, compared with 2 per cent more when the two commissions totaled only ½ per cent of the funds moved.\n\nWhen EACB raised its commission on selling sterling to ½ per cent, it reached the maximum permitted under its Regulations. In March 1965, in order to assure continued flexibility, the Regulations were amended to increase the permissible dealing margin from ½ per cent to 1 per cent of either side of par. So far, EACB has not made use of this new authority.\n\nThroughout the whole period since 1961, EACB has sometimes dealt with the banks at rates between the two official limits for its exchange commissions. It did so with the dual aim of (1) encouraging temporary short-term borrowing by the banks from abroad to finance crop movements and (2) bringing finer rates to the public and thus making dealings in the unofficial “compensation market” outside the banking system less attractive. By charging lower rates to the banks on certain operations, EACB has enabled the banks, in turn, to reduce their charges to their customers for transactions amounting to £EA 100,000 or more. As a result, more exchange transactions have been handled through the banking system and “compensation arrangements” have been reduced. “Compensation arrangements” were largely eliminated when the three East African Governments introduced exchange control in June 1965.\n\nIn 1964, EACB relaxed the relatively automatic link between changes in the local rates for Treasury bills and those in London. From the fall of 1961 to early 1964, these rates in East African territories had remained approximately ⅛ per cent below the London rates. When the bank rates in London rose to 5 per cent in February 1964 and to 7 per cent in November 1964, EACB intervened to keep the rates for Treasury bills of its constituent Governments from rising sharply in sympathy with the London rates although it still allowed day-to-day changes to be related to the London market. This policy led to broadly parallel moves of the rates in East Africa and in London, but to spreads that widened and narrowed with increases or decreases of the bank rate in London. Early in 1965 the maximum local rate was 4.4 per cent compared with the Treasury bill rate in London of 6.6 per cent.\n\nThe proportion of EACB’s sterling assets to total investments ranged between 82 and 86 per cent during 1961-64 (Table 7). By June 1965 it had declined to 72 per cent. This decline resulted mainly from the currency conversion in Aden. By June 30, 1965, EACB had redeemed £EA 11.4 million from the South Arabian Currency Authority in exchange for £EA 0.9 million of Aden Government securities and £EA 10.5 million of sterling securities. Sterling assets at market value at the end of June 1965 (£EA 50.2 million) were equal to 81 per cent of EACB’s sight liabilities (£EA 61.8 million). Its balance sheet entry for sterling assets included (1) the sterling portion of the shares of profits that will be distributed to the Governments, (2) the amounts that will be paid in foreign exchange to IMF to cover the increase in the quotas of the three East African countries, and (3) Aden’s residual share of the eventual “surplus assets.” After allowing for these three items, EACB estimated in its annual report for 1965 that its sterling holdings were equivalent to nearly 3½ months of imports into the East African area.10\n\nTable 7.\n\nEast African Currency Board: Composition and Degree of Liquidity of Assets,1 Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 1961-65\n\nSources: East African Currency Board, Report for the Year Ended 30th June, various years.\n\n1Value at or below market.\n\nTable 7.\n\nEast African Currency Board: Composition and Degree of Liquidity of Assets,1 Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 1961-65\n\nAmount Per Cent of Total 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 Million East African pounds Sterling assets Cash, Treasury bills, and crop-financing advances 26.4 26.6 33.6 35.2 22.5 47.0 47.2 52.1 55.6 44.8 Securities maturing in 5 years or less 18.1 21.9 22.3 24.9 27.5 32.2 38.8 34.6 39.3 54.8 Over 5 and up to 10 years 10.1 6.3 8.4 3.1 0.1 18.0 11.2 13.1 4.9 0.2 Over 10 years 1.6 1.6 0.1 0.1 0.1 2.8 2.8 0.2 0.2 0.2 Total and per cent of grand total 56.2 56.4 64.4 63.3 50.2 83.5 82.3 85.6 83.4 71.8 East African assets Cash, Treasury bills, and crop-financing advances 2.8 5.1 3.2 4.6 12.3 25.2 42.1 29.6 36.5 62.4 Securities maturing in 5 years or less 0.3 0.3 1.4 1.1 1.0 2.7 2.5 13.0 8.7 5.1 Over 5 and up to 10 years 1.2 2.3 1.7 1.8 2.0 11.0 19.0 15.7 14.3 10.2 Over 10 years 6.8 4.4 4.5 5.1 4.4 61.1 36.4 41.7 40.5 22.3 Total and per cent of grand total 11.1 12.1 10.8 12.6 19.7 16.5 17.7 14.4 16.6 28.2 Total assets Cash, Treasury bills, and crop-financing advances 29.2 31.7 36.8 39.8 34.8 43.4 46.3 48.9 52.3 49.8 Securities maturing in 5 years or less 18.4 22.2 23.7 26.0 28.5 27.4 32.4 31.5 34.1 40.8 Over 5 and up to 10 years 11.3 8.6 10.1 4.9 2.1 16.8 12.5 13.4 6.7 3.0 Over 10 years 8.4 6.0 4.6 5.2 4.5 12.4 8.8 6.2 6.9 6.4 Grand total 67.3 68.5 75.2 75.9 69.9 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0\n\nSources: East African Currency Board, Report for the Year Ended 30th June, various years.\n\n1Value at or below market.\n\nTable 7.\n\nEast African Currency Board: Composition and Degree of Liquidity of Assets,1 Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 1961-65\n\nAmount Per Cent of Total 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 Million East African pounds Sterling assets Cash, Treasury bills, and crop-financing advances 26.4 26.6 33.6 35.2 22.5 47.0 47.2 52.1 55.6 44.8 Securities maturing in 5 years or less 18.1 21.9 22.3 24.9 27.5 32.2 38.8 34.6 39.3 54.8 Over 5 and up to 10 years 10.1 6.3 8.4 3.1 0.1 18.0 11.2 13.1 4.9 0.2 Over 10 years 1.6 1.6 0.1 0.1 0.1 2.8 2.8 0.2 0.2 0.2 Total and per cent of grand total 56.2 56.4 64.4 63.3 50.2 83.5 82.3 85.6 83.4 71.8 East African assets Cash, Treasury bills, and crop-financing advances 2.8 5.1 3.2 4.6 12.3 25.2 42.1 29.6 36.5 62.4 Securities maturing in 5 years or less 0.3 0.3 1.4 1.1 1.0 2.7 2.5 13.0 8.7 5.1 Over 5 and up to 10 years 1.2 2.3 1.7 1.8 2.0 11.0 19.0 15.7 14.3 10.2 Over 10 years 6.8 4.4 4.5 5.1 4.4 61.1 36.4 41.7 40.5 22.3 Total and per cent of grand total 11.1 12.1 10.8 12.6 19.7 16.5 17.7 14.4 16.6 28.2 Total assets Cash, Treasury bills, and crop-financing advances 29.2 31.7 36.8 39.8 34.8 43.4 46.3 48.9 52.3 49.8 Securities maturing in 5 years or less 18.4 22.2 23.7 26.0 28.5 27.4 32.4 31.5 34.1 40.8 Over 5 and up to 10 years 11.3 8.6 10.1 4.9 2.1 16.8 12.5 13.4 6.7 3.0 Over 10 years 8.4 6.0 4.6 5.2 4.5 12.4 8.8 6.2 6.9 6.4 Grand total 67.3 68.5 75.2 75.9 69.9 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0\n\nSources: East African Currency Board, Report for the Year Ended 30th June, various years.\n\n1Value at or below market.\n\nEACB has made continuous efforts to shorten the maturities of its assets and thus strengthen its liquidity structure.
