        "text": "TANGANYIKA as a geographical and political entity did not take shape before the period of High Imperialism; it's name only came into use after German East Africa was transferred to Britain as a mandate by the League of Nations in 1920. What is referred to here therefore is the history of the region that was to become Tanganyika.\n\nGerman CARL Peters had secured treaties with tribal leaders on East Africa's coast, providing the German government with legitimation to negotiate with Britain over spheres of interest in East Africa. In the treaty of 1886, Germany renounced it's claims on the WITU AREA (on Kenya's coast, north of Mombasa) and on Uganda, and Britain recognized Germany's claim to what was to become German East Africa. In another treaty of 1890, Germany traded the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba for the much smaller island of Heligoland, off Germany's coast in the North Sea. The Germans bought off the Sultan of Zanzibar's rights to the Tanganyikan coast for $ 800,000.\n\nThe German East Africa COMPANY (founded 1887, succeeded by the German government in 1891) established BAGAMOYO as their colony's capital, soon moving it to DARESSALAAM. The colony was called DEUTSCH-OSTAFRIKA (German East Africa). The colony's borders had been established in treaties with Britain (Kenya, Uganda, Northern Rhodesia), Belgium (Belgian Congo) and Portugal (Mocambique); interests of the indigenous people were disregarded. From the coast, the Germans penetrated the country and established their rule. The currency was 1 Rupia = 64 Pesa.\n\nFor many years Tanzania was the world's leading producer of Sisal but the introduction of synthetic fibres depleted the market. Cashew nut and cotton, Pyrethrum and tobacco are grown as well as Arabica coffee in Arusha district and Robusta coffee in the Bukoba area. Tea is grown in the Usambara and Tukuyu regions. Main timber products are camphorwood, mahogany (mkangazi), mangrove, mninga, ebony (mpingo) and teak (mvule).\n\nDiamonds, alluvial and ore gold are found near Shinyanga and the German 'Tabora Sovereign' was minted from Sekenke gold. The famous Tanzanite gemstone is known all over the world.\n\nIn British East Africa, the Indian Rupee replaced the Cowrie Shell in 1896 (I Rupee = 200 cowries). The Rupee was replaced by the Florin which was itself replaced in 1922 by the current official tender, the Shilling with 100 cents per unit.\n\nPopulation by 1990 was approximately 26 million with an average density of 25 inhabitants per sq. km.\n\nI can across the email below (see link) and I am very interested to know the answers.\n\nPlease help because right now I know somebody who has the coin written Dr. Kaiser Rupee ii of 1913 the rest being same as below described and the ironbox and wants to dispose it to Kaiser foundation in return for some millions of dollars as he is told. Can I get the true facts about it.\n\n'I am a Kenyan citizen currently residing in Nairobi. I recently came a cross an Old man claiming to have taken part in the first world war and to prove it, he un-vailed some of the artifacts that he claim he was given.\n\nOne of the items was a round copper coin with one of its sides swollen have an inscription of what he refered to as William Kaisas Head with a bird on top of it. The other side was flat with the name William Kaisa inscription on the edges,& other German wording in the mild. When placed closely to the ear & Shaken, some form of heavy liquid can be hard moving & when you fold it into your palm, it sensationalizes your hand.\n\nWord on the street has it that this item is a lot of money.\n\nQuestion (1): Is it true?\n\nQuestion (2): How much is it worth?\n\nQuestion (3): If we were to exchange it for monetary gains, how & where would the transaction take place.\n\nAlso shown was a Knife & a Stove egg sharped with palm tree & two Lions on the sides.'\n\nI am a Kenyan citizen currently residing in Nairobi.

However, I would like to know if you have any information pertaining to the banknotes . My Question would be\n\nHow many different Signatories (or Governors ) has the GEA '10 Rupien' been issued between 1905 - 1917 and what were its different types / prefixes.\n\nI shall be grateful if I can get this information.\n\nThanking You Sincerely,\n\nPercy Siganporia\n\nWow, what an interesting hobby! I thought that Northern Tanzania was pretty specialised, but finding 10 Rupee bank notes must call for real dedication.\n\nAnd it's a shame that I cannot help you, because I donï¿½t think that Iï¿½ve got anything in my collection which will give the kind of detail you want. Most books just say something like \"the currency used to be the Rupee\" and stop there.\n\nMy guess is that many of the sources you need will be in German, and that's always a challenge for non-German speakers.\n\nHowever, Iï¿½ll try to remember you request as I look arround, and if I see anything Iï¿½ll let you know.\n\nI truly appreciate your fast response and your gesture in helping me in the information I seek for my subject of specialization. As you rightly said, there could be sources in German which can provide me with certain detials of the '10 Rupien' banknotes issued between 1905 & 1917 by GEA . It is a matter of time / efforts that one can get the information they require, thanks to the internet.\n\nAnyway, if you do come across information or even banknotes of '10 Rupien ' GEA or '10 Rupees' of Mombasa (East Africa) , Zanzibar , kindly let me know. I shall be truly grateful for the same."
