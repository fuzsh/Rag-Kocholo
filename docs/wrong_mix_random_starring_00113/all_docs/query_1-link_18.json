The economic rationale for the method of multiple valuation method is the law of one price, i.e., identical assets should sell for the same price. To compute the multiple valuation method we needed to define the peer group first. Apple, IBM and HP are not suitable because of their bigger dimension (market capitalization, Debt, Equity and Share price). Also, to be comparable, firms need to be similar in terms of risk, profitability, and growth. Once the comparable companies were identified, the multiples were computed and a comparison was established between the peer group's market capitalization and share price and those of the target company (Sun). In this context, where a company wants to acquire another, corporate executive are interested in assessing a target's total value, reflecting both debt (we assumed net debt in this case) and equity. In this case, the enterprise value is a better basis for the valuation. That way we used the EV/EBITDA ratio, which resulted in a meaningless value as Sun's EBITDA is negative. EV/Sales ratio should then be used. In fact, the EV/Sales ratio raised the firm's valuation to $16375,51 Million against its $6198,17 Million market capitalization. We can also use the Price Earnings (P/E) ratio, which provides an indication of how much investors are willing to pay for a company's earnings. To ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n3. Evaluating A Clinical Microsystem Utilizing The... The intention of this paper is to analyze a clinical microsystem utilizing the microsystems guide and the 5Ps (see Appendix A). The microsystem is a behavioral health pilot program with the organization Palo Alto Medical Foundation (PAMF). First, the purpose of the microsystem will be discussed and then move on to describe the patient population. Next, will be a discussion of the professionals working in the system. Following this, I will review the process of delivering care to patients and the patterns within the system. Lastly, the paper will explore areas the microsystem could improve to better serve the patient population. Purpose The integrated behavioral health pilot program is quite new and different from other behavioral health models. Prior to the program, there was no behavioral health services located with PAMF, which is serving the needs of 97,000 patients. As primary care struggled with this, a group offered PAMF a grant and the primary care providers (PCPs) wanted a behavioral health team. PAMF formed a team and they spent a year researching behavioral health models. They then developed our current model that was adapted from many different models found in research. The purpose of the model was to improve access to quality mental health services through supporting PCPs in meeting their patient 's behavioral health needs.

Using the Du Pont System of Analysis, which is net income divided by the stockholders' equity, the percentage of return on stockholders' equity for 2000 is 67%, and for 2001 is 33%. Analyzing the ratios, some of the results found are: Profit Margin = Net Income/Sales 2000 = 11% 2001 = 5%, Return on Assets (investment) = Net income/Total Assets 2000 = 13% 2001 = 5%, Net income/Sales x Sales/Total Assets 2000 = 11% x 1.1% = 12.1% 2001 = 5% x 1% = 5%, Return on Equity = Return on Assets/ (1–Debt/Assets) 2000 = 0.13 / 1–0.483 = 26% 2001 = 0.50 / 1–0.417 = 11% The DuPont system of analysis looks at the return on assets (investment) = Profit margin x Asset turnover. Sun Microsystems return on stockholders' equity shows a decrease from 26% in 2000 to 11% in 2001. Sales increased over the previous year, the company incurred more debt in line items, such as operating cost of sales, R&D, increasing total expenses on assets.

Neck Posture: Neck posture involved forward bending/flexion while glancing downward at the keyboard/mouse, and viewing paper documents on the desk surface. It was noted that the instructor does not wear bifocals or progressive lenses, hence there was no need to adjust the monitor tilt angle. Twisting and tilting of the neck was observed when the instructor turned her head to improve viewing angles at the workstation of both monitors. 3.

The Language Of A Programing Language A Programing language is a formal language that is designed to communicate information to machine. By using programing languages we will write code to control the machine and for the computation. The programing languages are preceded by the invention of computer. The first computer programing language was written in 1950's. The first high level programing language \"Short Code\" was proposed by John Mauchly's in 1949 for an electronic computer. Generally the artificial language can been split into syntax (form) and semantics (meaning). During that period the computer hardware was very cheap and advanced which requires a good programing tool to develop a computer application software for the system. C was developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972. C was the most popular programming languages at that period. As time goes on programmers found that it was difficult with structure syntax and they developed a new philosophy language called as OOP. The main concept in OOP was reuse of code. By including all the features and fundamentals of OOP, the new programing language was named as C++ which was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979. In OOP, problem is made into small units known as objects. Class is the basic unit of code which helps in creating the run time objects. OOP uses bottom up approach. The design of OOP is the chain of responsibility i.e the pattern consists of a source command objects and a series of processing objects. The basic features of OOP are 1. Object. 2. Class. 3. ...

Oracle had acquired the two main transactional engines that MySQL could have used, namely Innobase and its replacement Sleepycat. In a way it gave Oracle some control as a partner with MySQL. Increasing competition: New open source database startups such as db4o leveraged open source community for development, marketing and sales and hence enjoyed an extremely low cost structure. This enabled them to expand their customer base in enterprise domain. Some closed source databases became open source. Eg: Cloudscape from IBM. This further increased the competition. 3. What is the current status of MySQL?

Java, in it's simplest definition, is a dynamic computer application that can run a program to accomplish a task. Java runs in all sorts of things in the average person's life; things such as car stereo systems, televisions, cell phone applications, websites, and more. But, where did it come from, and how does it work, and how has it impacted our lives today? Java was first created by Patrick Naughton, Mike Sheridan, and James Gosling in 1994. However, they started writing the code for it four years earlier in 1990. They originally started making it to try and make a new and more practical way of computing. Originally, Java was called \"Oak\", and it was being made for the Green Project in Sun ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... The different types were called Java 2 Platform: Standard Edition, which was made for stand–alone developers with desktop workstations and anything related, Java 2 Platform: Enterprise Edition, which was created for an enterprise that was very dependent on their server systems, and Java Platform 2: Micro Edition, which was for consumer devices like phones, stereos, etc (oracle.com). Next year, co–founder and Chief executive of Apple Inc. Steve Jobs announces that each new version of the Mac OS X will contain Java 2 Standard Edition. In 2004, Sun Microsystems takes a big step and considers making Java an open–source application. At this point, official Java projects must go through certain process, and if altered, it must be approved. Even though at first James Gosling, Sun Microsystem vice president Rob Gingell, and Redmonk Analyst James Governor all disagree to allow Java to be open–sourced, it does in 2006 (oracle.com). In 2005, the tenth year of Java, the object–oriented language has gone from it's original web–animation purpose to doing much more. At the time, Java has driven more than $100 billion dollars of revenue a year for companies, has more than 4.5 million developers, over 2.5 billion Java–enabled devices, and an estimated 708 million Java handsets worldwide (oracle.com).

Java Ring CHAPTER–1 INTRODUCTION The Java Ring is a stainless–steel ring, 16–millimeters (0.6 inches) in diameter that houses a 1–million–transistor processor, called an iButton. The ring has 134 KB of RAM, 32 KB of ROM, a real–time clock and a Java virtual machine, which is a piece of software that recognizes the Java language and translates it for the user's computer system. At Celebration School, the rings have been programmed to store electronic cash to pay for lunches, automatically unlock doors, take attendance, store a student's medical information and allow students to check out books. All of this information is stored on the ring's iButton. Students simply press the signet of their Java Ring against the Blue Dot receptor, and ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... Every iButton product is manufactured with a unique 8–byte serial number and carries a guarantee that no two parts will ever have the same number. Among the simplest iButtons are memory devices that can hold files and subdirectories and can be read and written like small floppy disks. In addition to these, there are iButtons with password protected file areas for security applications, iButtons that count the number of times they have been rewritten for securing financial transactions, iButtons with temperature sensors, iButtons with continuously running date/time clocks, and even iButtons containing powerful microprocessors. The java ring was first introduced in the year 1998, in the java one conference .the ring was built by the Dalas semiconductor corporation. 2.1 The postal security device For over 10 years, Dallas Semiconductor also has been designing, making, and selling a line of highly secure microprocessors that are used in satellite TV descramblers, automatic teller machines, point–of–sale terminals, and other similar applications requiring cryptographic security and high resistance to attack by hackers.

Microsystem Summary Johnson (2006) eloquently talks about healthcare systems as \"cumbersome, unwieldy, unfriendly and opaque to its users\" (Johnson, 2006, p. i10). It is the challenge of this post to take the clinical microsystem where I practice, the HIV Health Service Center clinic, and discuss the interrelationships of this microsystem to the microsystems of other primary care clinics in the county system. The main role of the mesosystem is to support the microsystems. According to Bronfenbrenner's ecological system's theory, the mesosystem contains the relationship between two systems, or between the primary care clinics in the county system and the macrosystem which contains both the microsystem and the mesosystem.

In 2010, the Oracle Corporation finalized an acquisition of Sun Microsystems, Inc. for 7.3 billion dollars by way of a merger through a wholly owned subsidiary adjacent to Sun. At the commencement of this acquisition, Oracle corporation established an integration of certain hardware systems, of which 2 operating systems emerged: system products and system support. The Hardware System Product operating system emphasizes the physical use of storage products and computer server tactics where as the Hardware Systems support acted as a supplement to customers through ambiguous software updates to functionally essential software components. The establishment of these hardware systems, both Hardware Systems Product systems and Hardware Systems Support further placated one of Oracle's intentional goals that prompted the acquisition of Sun; the optimization of database software performance. The second intention was the want for an array of commodities, in Sun's possession, that posed value against other products in the industry.

In Conclusion, looking at the financial statement analysis for Sun Microsystems one can definitely see the company's strengths and their needs. The balance sheet indicates what the firm owns and how these assets are financed in the form of liabilities or ownership interest and the statement of income is the major device for measuring the profitability of a firm over time Sun Microsystems needs to implement a new plan quickly to save its company from going under as its stockholders' equity continues to decrease. It has experienced a decline in its net income between 2000 and 2001. Not all changes were specific to Sun Microsystems. Some of these changes were industry wide. If Sun Microsystems was to outsource some of its employees it can save money appealing to its stockholders. Consequently, outsourcing will allow for more emphasis and focus on product development, which can ultimately increase revenue.

The decrease in asset turnover (1.11 to 1.00) made a small contribution to the decline, as did the decline in the debt ratio (48.4% to 41.8%). Ratios for return on assets and return on equity offer support for the loss in stockholders' equity. Return on assets went from 13.1 in 2000 to 5.1 in 2001 and return on equity dropped from 25.4 in 2000 to 8.7 in 2001. Return on equity represents return on assets divided by the difference of 1 and debts/assets. This supports the conclusion that cost of sales, a reflection of asset investment, is most responsible for the lackluster net income of 2001. The price/earnings (P/E) ratio further demonstrates the fluctuation in value to stockholders from 1998 to 2001.

Industry The industry in which Sun Microsystems is competing in is computer workstations for scientists, engineers, and commercial companies. Sun's founder's believed there was demand for a desktop computer workstation costing between $10,000 and $20,000 in a market niche, ignored by minicomputer makers such as, IBM, Data General, Dec, and Hewlett–Packard. Sun's executives believed that they would only have a short time in this market before the other large companies decided to enter, because it was an exclusive market with a high entry barrier, but with opportunity for extensive profitability. The workstation market for engineers and scientists was rapidly becoming saturated. The company is now concentrating more of its efforts on airlines, banks, insurance, financial companies, and other commercial companies, trying to persuade users to utilize Sun workstations to solve new problems.
