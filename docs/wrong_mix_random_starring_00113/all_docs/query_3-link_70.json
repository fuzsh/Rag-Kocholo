Consider this: Project A: -Licensed under your proposed modified sleepcat license. Project B: -Incorporates project A, and licensed under the MIT license. Project C: -Incorporates Project B, and as a result project A, Project C can't must be licensed under a free software license, otherwise it would violate the terms of the modified sleepcat license of project A. As a result, even though Project B wanted to use a permissive license, users of Project B, still have to release their source code. You've made non-viral permissive licenses like MIT, viral as a result. > > On Sun, Apr 16, 2017 at 03:11:43PM -0400, Bob Jonkman wrote: > > -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- > > Hash: SHA1 > > > > So, to play devil's advocate: The new licence provides all the same > > freedoms to the user as xGPL licenses, and gives the developer the > > additional freedom to choose any other license that must also give > > users and developers the same freedoms as an xGPL license.
