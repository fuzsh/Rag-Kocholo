        "text": "Oracle Corp. this month bought Sleepycat Software Inc., its second acquisition in the past five months of a company offering technology that can be used as a storage engine for the MySQL open-source database.\n\nBut the purchase of Lincoln, Mass.-based Sleepycat isn’t prompting the same level of concern among MySQL users as did Oracle’s October purchase of Innobase Oy in Helsinki, Finland. Innobase’s InnoDB software is used much more widely with MySQL than Sleepycat’s Berkeley DB is, according to users and analysts.\n\nMany users fretted that Oracle bought Innobase simply as a hostile move against MySQL, said John Abbott, an analyst at The 451 Group in New York. “It was hard to see why Oracle did it other than to screw up MySQL,” he said.\n\nSleepycat claims that there have been more than 200 million deployments of Berkeley DB. The software is embedded in open-source products such as the Linux and BSD Unix operating systems, the Apache Web server, the OpenLDAP directory and the OpenOffice application suite. Deployment Limited\n\nBut Berkeley DB hasn’t been widely adopted by MySQL users, said Jeremy Cole, a former MySQL AB employee who now helps oversee about 8,000 installations of the open-source database at Yahoo Inc.\n\n“The BDB storage engine was added to MySQL in the early days as a prototype for adding transactional support,” Cole said. “InnoDB came along shortly afterward and quickly surpassed BDB in usefulness, speed and features. No one has looked back since.”\n\nBoyd Hemphill, an Austin-based MySQL administrator for the Texas state government, concurred with Cole’s point of view. Berkeley DB “was never fully supported [on MySQL], and I’m unaware of anyone using it in production,” Hemphill said. “Oracle’s purchase of Inno-DB was much more shocking [and] troubling because it was a much better-supported engine.”\n\nOracle said in documents posted on its Web site that there “currently are no plans to discontinue any of Sleepycat’s products.” Berkeley DB will be marketed for network edge applications, according to Oracle, which said the software will be a companion product to its existing TimesTen and Oracle Lite embedded databases.\n\nThe company added that it will maintain Sleepycat’s dual-license approach by offering commercial licenses for Berkeley DB and making it available to open-source developers. In a similar vein, Oracle said last fall that it expected to negotiate an extension of Innobase’s contract with MySQL, which expires this year."
