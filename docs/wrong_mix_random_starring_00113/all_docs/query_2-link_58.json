I do consulting on and off site, and have a training package for Berkeley DB developers, whether you are programming in Java, C, C++, C#.Â My services include code reviews, debugging and performance analysis, as well as developing BDB applicationsÂ My client list for expert BDB consulting have been both direct and through Sleepycat/Oracle stretch around the world and have included Siemens, Nokia, Kineto, EMC, Ebay, AOL, CSB-Systems, Ironport, Marconi, Next Page, StorageTek, Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Motorola, ISS Proxy.\n\nI also do a lot of java, C, C++ and C# contracting, specializing on the server side. In the past, I've done Unix kernel development, compiler development, system architecture and had my hands in most kinds of software. In fact, I find having a broad set of skills and interests to be very useful when I'm solving a particular task.\n\nI really love working with smaller organizations and helping to develop prototypes, processes and eventually products. In a couple of companies, I was brought in as the first java programmer and/or lead architect.\n\nMy resume is here.\n\nHere's a more readable blurb about my career.\n\nHere's a set of bios, more specific to Sleepycat work.\n\nMore information about my berkeley db work is here."
