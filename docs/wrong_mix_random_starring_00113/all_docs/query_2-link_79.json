        "text": "Leading XML Database and Tools Vendors Partner to Simplify Advanced XQuery Data Integration\n\nBedford, MA and Emeryville, CA  Feb 8, 2005  Stylus Studio (http://www.stylusstudio.com), the industry-leading innovator of XML development and productivity tools, and Sleepycat Software (http://www.sleepycat.com), the makers of Berkeley DB, the world's leading open source developer database with over 200 million deployments, today announced the immediate availability of new integrated XQuery development tools which fully support XML development using Berkeley DB XML 2.0.\n\n\"Berkeley DB XML 2.0 was a major feature release for Sleepycat, adding support for XQuery 1.0, XPath 2.0 and XML namespaces, and many other advanced services that our customers told us they wanted. Developers need excellent XML tools support, not just for XQuery but also for related technologies like XML and XML Schema. Our partnership with Stylus Studio gives our developers access to the world's most productive XML development tools when they use our native XML database technology,\" said Greg Burd, Product Manager for Sleepycat Software. \"Web services and SOA are moving into the mainstream. A combination like this delivers on XML's promise, making sophisticated networked applications simpler and faster to build. Best of all, it's available now and you can try it for free.\"\n\nStylus Studio's Senior Program Manager, Carlo Innocenti, had this to say about the new integrated XML tools: \"Using Stylus Studio®, users can now directly access XML files stored in Berkeley DB XML 2.0 as they would any local file resource. What's more, users can seamlessly operate on Berkeley DB XML 2.0 databases as abstract data sources for use with the Stylus Studio XML mapping tools. This makes it possible for Berkeley DB XML sources to be used as a live data input or target output for sophisticated XSLT or XQuery transformations. The advanced XML tools of Stylus Studio and the Berkeley DB XML 2.0 database provide a very productive platform for rapidly building custom XML database applications; together, it represents a cost-effective alternative to complicated server-based EII solutions and the overpriced, proprietary code generation schemes offered by other XML tools vendors.\"\n\nAbout Stylus Studio\n\nStylus Studio®, a product from DataDirect Technologies, an operating company of Progress Software Corporation, is the industry's most innovative XML IDE providing advanced support for XML and its related technologies: XSL, XSLT, XML Schema, DTD, SOAP, WSDL, SQL/XML, XML mapping and XQuery.
