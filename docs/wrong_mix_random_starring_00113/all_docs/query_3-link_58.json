String readBytes(int length)\n\nReads the specified number of bytes from the buffer, converting each unsigned byte value to a character of the resulting string. char readChar()\n\nReads a char (two byte) unsigned value from the buffer. void readChars(char[] chars)\n\nReads the specified number of characters from the buffer, converting each two byte unsigned value to a character of the resulting array. String readChars(int length)\n\nReads the specified number of characters from the buffer, converting each two byte unsigned value to a character of the resulting string. double readDouble()\n\nReads a signed double (eight byte) value from the buffer. float readFloat()\n\nReads a signed float (four byte) value from the buffer. int readInt()\n\nReads a signed int (four byte) value from the buffer. long readLong()\n\nReads a signed long (eight byte) value from the buffer. short readShort()\n\nReads a signed short (two byte) value from the buffer. String readString()\n\nReads a null-terminated UTF string from the data buffer and converts the data from UTF to Unicode. void readString(char[] chars)\n\nReads the specified number of UTF characters string from the data buffer and converts the data from UTF to Unicode. String readString(int length)\n\nReads the specified number of UTF characters string from the data buffer and converts the data from UTF to Unicode. int readUnsignedByte()\n\nReads an unsigned byte (one byte) value from the buffer. long readUnsignedInt()\n\nReads an unsigned int (four byte) value from the buffer."
