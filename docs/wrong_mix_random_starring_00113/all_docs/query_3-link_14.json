        "text": "The Sleepycat Java Collections API is a Java framework that extends the well known Java Collections design pattern such that collections can now be stored, updated and queried in a transactional manner. The Sleepycat Java Collections API is a layer on top of DB.\n\nTogether the Sleepycat Java Collections API and Berkeley DB provide an embedded data management solution with all the benefits of a full transactional storage and the simplicity of a well known Java API. Java programmers who need fast, scalable, transactional data management for their projects can quickly adopt and deploy the Sleepycat Java Collections API with confidence."
