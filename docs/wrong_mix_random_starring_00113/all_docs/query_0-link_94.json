Much of this is driven by the current investment boom around it that has raised the exchange rates over the 1000 USD mark. But really, looking at Bitcoin as a medium for currency or asset speculation is a bad idea. Instead, we should see it...\n\nInterview with J. Paul Morrison, the father of Flow-Based Programming\n\n06 September 2013 in Berlin, Germany. 1 minute read.\n\nJ. Paul Morrison invented Flow-Based Programming while at IBM in 1969.\n\nNoFlo coverage in August 2013\n\n02 September 2013 in Berlin, Germany. 2 minute read.\n\nAugust was a big month for NoFlo. We launched the Kickstarter campaign, which went from 0 to 90% inside the month.

Iâve built both software and community services for it.

But I do not speak with the authority of the MeeGo project, and...\n\nOpenwashing\n\n05 May 2011. 1 minute read.\n\nSomehow I had missed this term being coined: The old \"open vs. proprietary\" debate is over and open won. As IT infrastructure moves to the cloud, openness is not just a priority for source code but for standards and APIs as well. Almost every vendor in the IT market now wants to position its products as \"open.\" Vendors that don't...\n\nInteraction Design's Bauhaus moment\n\n19 April 2011. 1 minute read.\n\nThe Bauhausâs philosophy was that form should follow function and all other distractions and decoration should be avoided. It wanted space to be experience for its purity, stripped off all the âdirtâ and clutter of decor.

As a result of last weekend's Midgard developer meeting in FSCONS, the OpenPSA suite has...\n\nOpen Source is more than just code dumps\n\n29 October 2010. 1 minute read.\n\nGreat quote from Matt Asay's analysis of what went wrong with the opening of Symbian: Open source isnât a one-time announcement, coupled with a code drop. Itâs exceptionally hard, ongoing work that requires equal parts evangelism, programming, and customer success stories to keep developers believing that their work matters. This is very much in line with what I wrote about...\n\nHow to be a designer\n\n12 October 2010 in Helsinki, Finland. 1 minute read.\n\nAza Raskin on how to be a designer:\n\nOpen Source? Free Software? What we need is Open Projects\n\n14 June 2010. 3 minute read.\n\nBoth companies and public administration are starting to understand the benefits of free software: reducing vendor lock-in, possibility to continue development of a project after a vendor has gone out of business or lost interest, and in general enjoying the four freedoms. But unfortunately much of this understanding has been limited to the context of licenses. In reality, licenses are...\n\nStaff meeting in the park\n\n04 June 2010. 1 minute read.\n\nAt Nemein we have a monthly staff meeting to go through all project backlogs, new initiatives and happenings in the R&D side of things.

Thanks to Aslan for the cake!...\n\nPrivacy: how Qaiku is doing it\n\n18 May 2010. 1 minute read.\n\nFacebook is facing a backlash on their constant erosion of privacy. They have a privacy policy longer than US constitution, and a track record that has even sparked a federal complaint. While I'm a big believer in a transparent society I still believe users should be in control of who can see their information and how. I think Qaiku, the...\n\niPad and information appliances, a free software angle\n\n28 January 2010. 3 minute read.\n\nApple iPad is certainly interesting. It seeks to challenge the concept of PCs by providing something that is at the same time more personal, and a lot easier to use. The personal computer of the future. Gone is difficult file organization - instead, applications use their own purpose-build content repositories. Instead of seeking software from many places, all of it...\n\nIn defence of URLs and the Open Web\n\n17 November 2009. 2 minute read.\n\nAn increasing number of web services and applications are emphasising search terms or pre-selected websites instead of allowing users to enter any address they choose. This is worrying, as while searches are more user-friendly, URLs are the heart of an open web where anybody can publish without obscure business dealings or oppressive app store policies. There are many examples of...\n\nOpen Source and why forking is good\n\n14 October 2009. 1 minute read.\n\nFake Steve Jobs on the Trouble with Android: Um, hello? Folks, the whole point of doing open-source code is to let it fork. The idea is to accelerate evolution by encouraging weird mutations. Creating an open source program and hoping it won't fork is like decorating your house with a zillion Christmas lights and a forty-foot inflatable Santa and hoping...\n\nMaemo.org is testing workstreaming with Qaiku\n\n22 June 2009. 1 minute read.\n\nWorkstreaming means collecting activities of geographically dispersed team members into a consistent news feed, enabling managers to track process and colleagues to stay up-to-date with the day-by-day happenings. As maemo.org is a distributed project worked on by a group of both volunteers and paid employees, some sort of activity monitoring is quite necessary. For a while this has been done...\n\nWe will move to Hietalahti\n\n24 April 2009. 1 minute read.\n\nAbout one year after Operation Suvilahti, Nemein has now grown out of the space there and so we're moving again, this time to a 50s industrial building in the Hietalahti district of Helsinki. Here's the initial floor plan that still lacks couple of desks: Our development servers and other network infrastructure will move to AfHeurlinia where there is a diesel...\n\nOracle Sun acquisition: time to think about a content repository?\n\n20 April 2009. 1 minute read.\n\nSo, Oracle bought Sun, and MySQL with it. Since MySQL runs much of the current web, I'd imagine many developers are now concerned with the future of that database and looking at alternatives like PostgreSQL. But instead of locking yourself to another specific database, how about going with a content repository? Content repositories are services that wrap different storage back-ends...\n\nTurn Internet trash into money with ReFuel\n\n01 April 2009. 1 minute read.\n\nLast night Finnish energy company St1 launched ReFuel, their new biofuel product. ReFuel is interesting in the sense that it is produced from biowaste, and so no farmland is used in its production. To support the product launch we helped to create ReFuel Tehdas, an application for converting internet trash (bad pictures, advertisement banners) into money. To use it, you...\n\nWe're joining the Qaiku project\n\n13 March 2009. 1 minute read.\n\nI've been beta testing the new conversation-oriented microblogging service Qaiku, and after some negotiations we today signed a cooperation agreement to join in developing the site: Qaiku is a microblogging service, focusing strongly on discussion. Microblogging differs from ordinary blogging by the length of the posts, more topical content and automatically published micromedia, such as Flickr photo stream, Audioscrobbler stream...\n\nTracking impact instead of effort\n\n10 February 2009. 2 minute read.\n\nFrom the bubble-era start-up times in 2001, Nemein has based its invoicing on hours used, as is typical in the software consulting industry. The company provides services on a 100% pure, organic free software stack, and therefore there are no other additional costs beside maintenance on top of the normal work hours used for a client's benefit. With some clients...\n\nLast of the Christmas holidays\n\n06 January 2009. 1 minute read.\n\nSince today is Epiphany, the last of Christmas holidays, I thought to post a screenshot of our xmas-themed staff page before it goes the way of the Christmas tree: Technorati Tags: nemein\n\nNemein is going to Ubuntu Server\n\n14 November 2008. 1 minute read.\n\nAt Nemein we do maintenance for quite a few servers of our customers. While some customers have their own Linux distribution preference - usually RHEL - in most cases we have a say what distribution runs their servers. So far this has been debian, but now we're going for Ubuntu Server. The reasons for this are quite simple: Ubuntu follows...\n\nLinkedIn Applications: automatic data into your resume\n\n29 October 2008. 1 minute read.\n\nLinkedIn, the popular resume maintenance tool just got a little smarter: they added an applications catalogue that can make your profile there more dynamic. This is good as then potential business partners can find out more about myself from a single source, and I need to do less work to keep it up-to-date. I immediately added three apps, displaying my...\n\nFreedom Fry on GNU's 25th anniversary\n\n07 September 2008. 1 minute read.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation's GNU project turned 25 last week, and the English humorist Stephen Fry made a video to commemorate it: Benjamin Mako Hill posted some thoughts on how the first generation of free software developers has grown: Certainly, GNU has matured and accomplished wonderful things in last quarter-century. More importantly perhaps, it's produced wonderful progeny. It has spawned...\n\nKnol: a unit of knowledge\n\n29 August 2008. 1 minute read.\n\nGoogle's Wikipedia competitor Knol launched a while back. It seeks to make writing informative entries more appealing to authors by offering a cut of advertisement revenue from the Knol pages. This can be a substantial thing as calculations say if Wikipedia had ads the revenue from them would be 42 million USD per year. Having read Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash...\n\nPart-time Istanbullu\n\n26 August 2008. 1 minute read.\n\nA thousand years ago, men from my lands traveled here in search of opportunities and adventure. Now, due to intercontinental relationships and working permits, I follow their footsteps. While Istanbul didn't score perfectly in Monocle's Quality of Life index, I still find it a quite appealing place for a web worker.
