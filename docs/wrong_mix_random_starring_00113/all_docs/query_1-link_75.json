Installation ------------ To build and install a new version, execute the 'build' script. This will build the Apache-1.3.2 webserver, Tcl8.0.3-lite (enough Tcl to run the NeoWebScript extensions), the NeoWebScript modules, and installs everything into /usr/local/apache-nws-3.0/. This directory must exist and you must have write access to it (or you must have write access to /usr/local). The best way to do this is: % su # mkdir /usr/local/apache-nws-3.0 # chown (you) /usr/local/apache-nws-3.0 # ^D % ./build If you don't want to use this directory, build it the same way and put a symlink at /usr/local/apache-nws-3.0 which points to a directory you have write permissions. Upgrades -------- If you are upgrading from a previous release of NeoWebScript, see the README.db185 for information on converting your existing database files. Licensing --------- Please see the file called LICENSE, and various LICENSE, license.terms, and README files in the source distribution.
