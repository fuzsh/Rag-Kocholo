[libreplanet-discuss] Potential of the Sleepycat License

From: NicolÃ¡s A . Ortega Subject: [libreplanet-discuss] Potential of the Sleepycat License Date: Sat, 15 Apr 2017 11:55:52 +0200 User-agent: Mutt

I've tried having this discussion on #fsf and #gnu, and I think that this license has the potential to be a great software license, especially for libraries. To my understanding the Sleepycat License[0] is a copyleft license in which all derivatives of the work must be licensed likewise (under the Sleepycat license) and works that use a project under this license must disclose source code. There are, however a couple problems with this license, the first one (as you most likely have noticed while reading the above) is that disclosure of source code does not mean free software, and secondly is the issue that the license uses very specific terminology referring to the BerkleyDB (the software that uses this license) and refers mostly to DB software. Given, disclosure of source code is better (imo) than the LGPL since it forces the disclosure of the sources (while LGPL only does so in the case of static linking if there is no exception), and still gives more freedom for the programmer to choose a license unlike one of the GPL licenses (despite how much I love them). However, if we can find people with the knowledge to write/modify licenses ('cause I for sure will not be able to do that) then I think that this license could be modified to fix those two problems (for example, instead of requiring that code be disclosed, all 4 freedoms could be required). I am not an expert in licensing, which is why I brought this up here. Hopefully someone here has the ability, time, and will to do this (if it is possible).
