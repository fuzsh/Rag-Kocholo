Ornella Barra has been a member of the Board of Directors of Generali since 30 April 2013.

Ornella Barra graduated in pharmacy at Genova University and started her career in healthcare. She began as pharmacist, initially running a drugstore and then buying her own. In 1984 she founded the Di Pharma pharmaceutical distribution company, which was subsequently purchased by Alleanza Salute Italia.

Since then she has had multiple roles and responsibilities as member of board of directors of many listed and non-listed companies of the group. These subsequent cycles have led, in 2014, to the creation of Walgreens Boots Alliance (Nasdaq: WBA), the first global reality in the world for health and well-being with roots in pharmacy.

Generali is one of the largest global insurance and asset management providers. Established in 1831, it is present in over 50 countries in the world, with a total premium income of € 82.5 billion in 2023. With almost 82,000 employees serving 70 million customers, the Group has a leading position in Europe and a growing presence in Asia and Latin America. At the heart of Generali’s strategy is its Lifetime Partner commitment to customers, achieved through innovative and personalised solutions, best-in-class customer experience and its digitalised global distribution capabilities. The Group has fully embedded sustainability into all strategic choices, with the aim to create value for all stakeholders while building a fairer and more resilient society.
