They include Neil Ashe, president and CEO of Walmart's mission-critical global e-commerce business, as well as Ian McLeod, who once turned around the Australian retailer Coles, and is now the CEO of Southeastern Grocers. Also new on the list are Linda Filler of Walgreens, Tina Tyler and Casey Carl of Target Corp., and Mike Motz of Shoppers Drug Mart. Those leaders singled out as the industry's top 10 include two new names: Bob Miller, who has orchestrated the rise of Albertsons, and Brian Cornell, who has transformed Target\n\nThe 50 Most Influential People in Mass Market Retailing\n\nStefano Pessina, CEO--Walgreens Boots Alliance\n\n[1]\n\nDEERFIELD, Ill. -- A new stage in the evolution of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WB A) began last month with the appointment of Stefano Pessina as permanent chief executive officer. Pessina had been interim CEO as well as executive vice chairman since the retirement of Greg Wasson shortly after completion of the merger of Walgreen Co. and Alliance Boots GmbH last December.\n\n\"In Walgreens Boots Alliance's initial six months as a newly combined company, Stefano has done an extraordinary job leading the new enterprise, focusing our strategy while enhancing our financial performance,\" said James Skinner, executive chairman of WBA. \"The integration of Walgreens and Alliance Boots is proceeding exceptionally well, with Stefano's vision for the company driving the organization forward. Through his leadership, our organization is meeting the challenges of combining our two companies, and many of the opportunities we anticipated from our strategic combination are now becoming a reality.\n\n\"In order to continue this momentum and to recognize the progress that is already being made, the board concluded Stefano is the very best person to achieve our vision to be a truly global health care champion.\"\n\nThe decision to keep the reins in Pessina's hands did not come as much of a surprise. During the WBA Analyst Day in April, he acknowledged that the search for a new CEO had been more difficult than hoped for. \"It is not easy to find someone with the experience and gravitas we want, to be able to lead a strong team through challenging periods of transitional transformation for the business, with experience and understanding of our markets to be able to lead us [in] the ever-changing markets that we participate in.\"\n\n\"I will not sit still and just be a caretaker CEO,\" he promised. \"This is just not in my nature.\"\n\nIt is significant that Skinner paid tribute to Pessina's vision, because it is clear that the merger and the organization that is evolving out of it owed a great deal to Pessina's grasp of the strategic opportunities in the global health care landscape.\n\nDuring the Analyst Day, Pessina revealed some facets of his thinking. \"Bringing together two businesses by definition will always change both,\" he said. \"And the secret of capturing the true value of any such merger is recognizing this, expecting it and embracing it as it happens.\"\n\nHe further emphasized the global character of the new organization. \"When I talk of our opportunities I am talking on a global basis,\" he said. \"The size and scope of our business means that if we are professional in our approach and effective in our delivery, we will almost inevitably be one of the businesses that help shape the future of health care pharmacy at retail on a global basis. As our business and the markets we are operating in evolve and change, we have near endless opportunity and potential, and we are not blind to this. This is a dynamic and exciting business to be in.\"\n\nAs the company's transformation proceeds, the memory of Walgreens as just America's largest neighborhood drug chain is fading fast. Although the U.S. retail pharmacy division generated 71% of the company's total sales and 74% of its operating profit in its most recent quarter, much of its future growth may come from beyond this country's borders and outside the retail sector.\n\nPessina describes the company's new business model as consisting of three pillars: pharmacy-led retailing (including both Walgreens and Boots, the U.K.'s leading drug chain), wholesale distribution and brands. He noted that the wholesale business has been a valuable vehicle for expansion through new market entry and/or acquisitions.\n\n\"Our selling business gives us some important tactical and strategical advantages that give additional strength to the group as a whole,\" Pessina explained. \"It is an extremely cash-generative business that provides a common platform and true international presence in a sector [where we expect] further consolidation.\n\n\"It is an enabling business: It lets us enter new markets at scale more rapidly than retail. Its cash flow gives us financial scale and efficiencies.\"\n\nSpecifically, he said, the wholesale business provides \"the mind-set of running a low-margin business with all the rigors and disciplines that it demands,\" an ingredient that helps optimize inventory and working capital management in the company's pharmacy and retail businesses.\n\nThe brands group exists to give WBA's retail businesses a distinct competitive edge. In addition to sourcing and manufacturing branded health and beauty aids products, the group includes an insights and best practices group. The brands portfolio encompasses such global brands as Boots' No7 and Soap & Glory, and owned brands that include Well, which is sold at Walgreens outlets, and Boots Pharmaceuticals, which is available at the U.K. chain.\n\nLooking ahead, Pessina was understandably upbeat about the company's prospects. \"We have achieved a lot in a short period of time,\" he told analysts. \"And everything we have seen convinces us that there is, as we expected, a huge potential for this business.\n\n\"It may take different forms in different markets. There may be many components to it, and there is absolutely no doubt that it will take time to deliver. But the potential is huge.\"\n\nDoug McMillon, President, CEO--Walmart\n\n[2]\n\nBENTONVILLE, Ark. -- Since Doug McMillon took over as president and chief executive officer of Walmart in February 2014, he has overseen the launch of numerous initiatives intended to improve the customer experience and, consequently, the company's performance and competitive strength.\n\nWhile it is still too early for many of these actions to have borne fruit, more grumbles are being heard from an ever-impatient Wall Street that is unimpressed with the financial results so far.\n\nPerhaps the most striking initiatives are two measures unveiled in February with Walmart's fiscal 2015 financial results.\n\nFirst, Walmart announced that during the first half of fiscal 2016 about 500,000 full- and part-time associates at Walmart U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs would receive pay raises that would elevate Walmart's minimum hourly wage to $9 per hour. Next February, that level will be increased to $10 per hour.\n\nThe wage measures were accompanied by additional actions that are intended to increase opportunities for Walmart workers. They include a new training and orientation program to create career paths for associates by encouraging them to continue their education.\n\nIn addition, Walmart has enacted changes in its store operations structure that provide, among other things, more control for associates over their schedules.\n\nThe retailer has also revived the position of department manager. In earlier years, Walmart had encouraged those managers to consider their departments as their businesses, but the position was later abolished, probably as a means of reducing store labor costs. The unintended result was to create greater distance between associates and store-level management. Bringing the department manager position back should help to address that issue.\n\nWalmart sees the personnel moves as an investment that will pay dividends for the company.\n\n\"This set of initiatives is designed to improve the customer experience and translate into higher comp-store sales over time,\" McMillon told analysts during the first quarter conference call in May. \"We know that we won't see it overnight, but we're confident these are the right things to do for our business and our team.\"\n\nThe investment in associates will total around $1 billion this year, and Walmart is dedicating another $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion over a year and a half to two years to further develop its digital and e-commerce business.\n\nMcMillon has placed special emphasis not only on building Walmart's e-commerce capability, but also on blending e-commerce seamlessly with the brick-and-mortar business. Consequently, he also puts a great deal of stress on innovation and inventiveness, including taking risks.\n\n\"There are going to be times when customers want to have something delivered,\" McMillon told analysts recently. \"There are going to be times when they want to pick it up. There are going to be times when they want to come in a store and shop for it. All of those lines are getting blurred, and we think we are one of the retailers that has a unique opportunity to put those things together in a way where customers have new experiences and are delighted and surprised in some cases.\"\n\nThe new wage structure, training and educational programs are expected to trim about 20 cents per share from fiscal 2016 earnings, while the cost of the incremental investment in global e-commerce is calculated at 6 cents to 9 cents per share for the year.\n\nIncluding the impact of those investments, Walmart's first quarter revenues and earnings fell short of analysts' projections, in part because of an unexpectedly severe impact from foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nBut some analysts and financial media pundits, taking a typically short-term view, complained that the giant retailer is not paying enough attention to returns on investment.\n\nMcMillon, however, is by no means unmindful of the need to achieve improved results in the short term and midterm. During the investors' update session of the Walmart annual meeting in June, he acknowledged that the company needs to improve its merchandising and inventory management.\n\n\"It is a clear priority for us in the short term to have better stores and clubs, and some of our customer metrics are telling us now that we are on the right track,\" he said. \"I think what will happen, particularly in the Walmart U.S. Supercenters, is you will see week-to-week, month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter--assuming a steady-state external environment, particularly gas prices--you're going to see us continue to make some progress and improve with the customer.\"\n\nMcMillon also clearly addressed investors' impatience, even if his response did not satisfy all.\n\n\"We are excited and comfortable with the choices we have made and understood when we made them that it was not going to immediately pay off, and we can't magically answer for you which date things are magically going to be better,\" he said. \"I don't think it will feel that way, anyway.\n\n\"You will just have to watch our results and see what happens, and we are comfortable with you doing that, and we will just keep doing the right things that we need to do to build a stronger business over time.\"\n\nLarry Merlo, President, CEO--CVS Health\n\n[3]\n\nWOONSOCKET, R.I. -- When Larry Merlo took over the chief executive officer's role at then-CVS Caremark Corp., his first priority was to guide the integration of its retail and PBM divisions and drive synergies between them. Having achieved that goal in impressive fashion, he is now clearly directing CVS Health on a dynamic and innovative path to become one of the players, if not the leading player, in pharmaceutical distribution in this country.\n\nMerlo's latest coup is CVS' agreement to acquire Target Corp.'s pharmacy and health clinic businesses for $1.9 billion. The announcement followed by less than two months the blockbuster agreement to acquire Omnicare, the nation's largest provider of pharmaceutical services to long-term-care facilities, for a whopping $12.7 billion.\n\nThe Target deal will add the discounter's network of more than 1,660 pharmacies across 47 states and nearly 80 in-store clinics. That will boost CVS into the No. 1 position by pharmacy market share and store count, giving it nearly 9,500 pharmacies.\n\nThe Target pharmacies will be rebranded as CVS/pharmacy while the clinics will be rebannered as MinuteClinics. The agreement further calls for CVS to open up to 20 new clinics in Target outlets within three years of completing the agreement. In addition, the two companies plan to codevelop five to 10 small-format stores that will operate under the Target Express banner but will have CVS pharmacies.\n\n\"When we introduced the new name for our company, CVS Health, we began a new era of growth with a broader health care focus and an appreciation of the rise of health care consumerism, with consumer choice and accountability growing,\" Merlo said when the agreement was announced. \"This relationship with Target will provide consumers with expanded operations and access to our unique health care services that lead to better health outcomes and lower overall health care costs.\"\n\nThe Omnicare deal, on the other hand, gives CVS entry into a new sector of the health care industry--long-term-care facilities, including assisted living and nursing homes. It is a profoundly strategic move, because the Congressional Budget Office estimates that by 2050 fully 20% of the population will be 65 or older, compared with 12% in 2000.\n\nOmnicare, which had 2014 sales of $6.4 billion, operates 160 locations in assisted-living and long-term-care facilities in 47 states.\n\n\"The acquisition of Omnicare significantly expands our business, providing CVS Health access into a new pharmacy dispensing channel,\" Merlo said. \"It also creates new opportunities for us to extend our high-quality, innovative pharmacy programs to a broader population of seniors and chronic care patients as they transition across the care continuum.\"\n\nBoth the Omnicare and Target deals will provide further fuel for growth for CVS' specialty pharmacy business. Omnicare's network includes a complementary specialty pharmacy platform and clinical expertise, while the addition of the Target pharmacy network will give its patients access to CVS' Specialty Connect program as well as other services, such as Pharmacy Advisor and Maintenance Choice. CVS will also develop a low-cost generic drug alternative for Target's customers who pay with cash.\n\nWhile the Omnicare deal will load up CVS' balance sheet with debt, the acquisition is expected to add about 20 cents per share to CVS earnings in the first full year, excluding integration and onetime transaction costs, and its profit contribution is expected to grow in subsequent years.\n\nMerlo has aggressively guided CVS into new growth channels, and the result is one of the most powerful and complex health care organizations in the country. Its retail pharmacy network is now arguably the most diverse in the industry, with stand-alone pharmacies, in-store clinics and in-store pharmacies operated in other retail formats.\n\nMeanwhile, its pharmacy benefits management wing, CVS Pharmacy Services, includes mail order and a growing specialty pharmacy business. The PBM business has, moreover, become the leading engine for both top-and bottom-line growth, with both revenues and operating profit growing by double digits during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 and during fiscal 2014 as a whole.\n\nTo ensure its innovation leadership, CVS is investing in more than acquisitions. It recently opened its Digital Innovation Lab, which is responsible for developing new services and capabilities for personalized health care experiences. \"We're going to invent things here that don't exist anywhere on the planet, things that are going to be focused on what truly matters, our health,\" said Brian Tilzer, CVS' chief digital officer.\n\nMerlo has also demonstrated the quality and depth of his leadership in other ways. The decision to withdraw CVS/pharmacy from the tobacco business had an undeniable impact on front-end sales not only because of the lost tobacco sales but because customer traffic inevitably suffered as well, eliminating the chance to generate additional purchases by tobacco customers. Merlo, however, recognized that selling tobacco was not, ultimately, reconcilable with a company positioning itself as a health care provider, and called the decision \"simply the right thing to do.\"\n\nRodney McMullen, Chairman, CEO--Kroger\n\n[4]\n\nCINCINNATI -- Since taking the chief executive officer's position in January 2014, Rodney McMullen has provided steady leadership to the exceptional retail machine that Kroger Co. has become. This January he added the role of chairman with the retirement of David Dillon.\n\nKroger has defied the conventional wisdom that the traditional supermarket in the middle market has little chance for growth competing against price-oriented operators such as Walmart or Aldi on one hand and upscale food retailers such as Whole Foods Market Inc. on the other.\n\nMcMullen and his colleagues attribute the success to the organization's ability to execute its Customer 1st strategy, although the reality is a little more complicated than that. In October 2012, when McMullen was president and chief operating officer, management identified four key performance indicators it would track to gauge its progress:\n\n* Positive identical-supermarket sales growth.\n\n* Expanding non-fuel FIFO operating margin.\n\n* Increasing return on invested capital.\n\n* Growing the company's market share annually.\n\nIn fiscal 2014 the company met or exceeded each of those goals, and by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2015 it had recorded its 46th consecutive quarter of identical-store sales growth excluding fuel--an industry record. All in all, Kroger has plenty to celebrate, particularly because it is well equipped to continue to perform at the high level it has achieved.\n\n\"We are innovating to grow,\" McMullen said during the fourth quarter conference call in March. \"We expanded our digital capabilities to deepen our relationship with customers in new and exciting ways. More customers than ever before are engaging on our digital properties. The learnings from both our Vitacost and Harris Teeter mergers are allowing us to build an experience that gives our customers the ability to interact with us when, where and how they want. Our corporate brands team keeps pushing the boundaries on what customers can expect from store brands. Our leading natural and organics brand, Simple Truth, hit $1 billion in annual sales for the first time in less than two years after the introduction.\"\n\nMcMullen added that the mergers with Harris Teeter, a North Carolina-based regional upscale supermarket chain, and Vitacost, an online retailer of health and wellness products, have opened up new markets that represent significant growth opportunities. In addition, the company continues to pursue a fill-in strategy in its existing markets.\n\nKroger saw no loss of momentum in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, as adjusted net earnings grew 11% and identical-store sales (excluding fuel) rose 5.78%. \"Kroger has produced consistently remarkable results for so long that it might be easy to take a quarter like this for granted, but these results don't happen accidentally,\" McMullen told analysts. \"They happen because we lead and drive our business toward these goals. Customer 1st and our four keys--our people, products, pricing and the shopping experience--remains our fundamental strategy. We strive for balance across these four keys, and each quarter we do a little better in each. And when we do that--consistently, as we have for so long--our results are more powerful.\"\n\nAs McMullen's remarks indicate, Kroger has been excelling for a long time. During the 1990s, when several of the largest supermarket companies engaged in a frenzy of acquisitions, only one proved capable of successfully integrating its acquisitions and generating sustained growth from them: Kroger.\n\nBecause of his modesty, it requires the testimony of others to reveal the significant role that McMullen has had in that success. When the CEO succession was revealed in September 2013, his predecessor, Dillon, noted that McMullen had played a leadership role in every major decision at Kroger for the past 25 years. And since McMullen is just 54, that means he played a role in the executive decision-making process since the age of 27.\n\nHowever, McMullen's track record with the company goes back to 1978, when he became a part-time stocker at a Kroger in Lexington, Ky., at the age of 17. He continued working nights and extra shifts while completing college and even obtaining a master's degree within four years.\n\nAlthough he had planned to join an accounting firm upon graduation, when a Kroger regional executive asked him if he would be interested in working for the grocer, McMullen ended up taking a position as an accounting supervisor in the Charlotte, N.C., regional office. He was on his way.\n\nEventually McMullen became assistant treasurer, vice president of planning and capital management, corporate controller and, in 1995, chief financial officer. In 2000 he was promoted to executive vice president of strategy, planning and finance, then was named vice chairman. He became president and COO in 2009.\n\nBecause of his rapid rise within Kroger, McMullen had the privilege of working closely with three CEOs whom he refers to as \"legends\"--Lyle Everingham, Joseph Pichler and David Dillon. It will be no surprise if in time McMullen earns the same legendary status from his successors.\n\nBob Miller, Chairman, CEO--Albertsons\n\n[5]\n\nBOISE, Idaho -- Bob Miller leads the nation's second-largest supermarket operator with sales of approximately $57.5 billion. His rise to that position constitutes a triumph for an executive who began his supermarket career at the age of 16 as a bagger.\n\nIronically, he began that career at an Albertson's supermarket--the same company that he leads today and at which he worked for much of his career. He became a store manager in 1969 and was promoted to district manager five years later. By 1988, he had risen through the executive ranks to become executive vice president of operations, the third-highest position in the company.\n\nMiller's success at that point was already remarkable. Raised by his mother from the age of 6, he had overcome the effects of polio as a child to become an avid athlete and made his ascent into the executive ranks without the benefit of a college degree, opting instead to work full time at his supermarket.\n\nWhen Miller was passed over for the CEO spot upon the retirement of Warren McCain, he moved on to Fred Meyer Inc., a Portland, Ore.-based chain of 120 multi-department stores often classified as supercenters but with little of the discount store about them.\n\nWith Miller at the helm, Fred Meyer undertook an aggressive expansion plan fueled by acquisitions. By 1998 the retailer's sales had grown to $15 billion from $2.5 billion, making it attractive enough for Kroger Co. to acquire.\n\nAfter a year with Kroger as vice chairman and chief operating officer, Miller found a more interesting opportunity in then-beleaguered Rite Aid Corp. He took on the roles of chairman and chief executive officer in December 1999 and brought in a management team that eventually turned around the No. 3 drug store chain. In addition to assembling an expert turnaround team, Miller's own reputation was a vital ingredient in convincing the company's lenders to rework its massive debt burden into a manageable configuration.\n\nBy 2003 Miller felt comfortable with passing on the CEO responsibility to Mary Sammons, although he continued as chairman for four more years.\n\nThe turning point came in 2006.\n\nAfter Miller's departure from Albertsons, the company waded into the consolidation wave that was reshaping the supermarket business and acquired several regional and local chains as well as the disparate collection of banners and operating companies owned by American Stores Co. After a few years of trying to get the resulting organization to work, former General Electric executive Larry Johnston threw in the towel and effectively destroyed Albertsons Inc. by agreeing to sell most of its assets, including 1,124 supermarkets, to Supervalu Inc. and all of its freestanding drug stores to CVS Corp.\n\nHowever, Cerberus Capital, a private equity firm, bought 661 of the less desirable supermarkets and hired Miller as chief executive officer of the reborn Albertsons LLC, headquartered here in Boise. For Miller, it was sort of a homecoming.\n\nSix years later, when Supervalu gave up its unsuccessful efforts to digest the Albertsons acquisition, Cerberus was poised to purchase it. Miller once again was in charge of Albertsons, which now fielded approximately 1,100 stores. Unfazed, Albertsons pursued Safeway Inc., which was considering its own sale, and completed that $8 billion acquisition early this year, creating an organization of 2,200 stores stretching from coast to coast.\n\nWith that deal finished, Miller became executive chairman while former Safeway CEO Robert Edwards took that role over the combined Albertsons-Safeway entity. But in April, Edwards was eased into the position of vice chairman, while Miller took back the reins as CEO of Albertsons, NAI (New Albertson's Inc.) and Safeway.\n\nWhile Miller has reason to feel triumphant, he nonetheless faces challenges. Rather than continue to try to integrate the sprawling collection of banners and operating units, his strategy has been to apply a decentralized management approach that centers authority and responsibility at the regional and local levels, with each division responsible for its financial results.\n\n\"We know the best way to grow our business is to have the highest-quality fresh departments; lower prices; clean, well-stocked stores; and the best customer service in the market,\" Miller said. \"Our teams will focus on delivering what customers want locally, and we will give our store teams more flexibility to make decisions that are right for their neighborhoods. The division teams will have the responsibility to have the right assortment for their markets.\"\n\nLast month Albertsons filed for an initial public stock offering, with the expectation of raising perhaps $100 million. According to its SEC filing, the company intends to upgrade and remodel stores and add new outlets; offer more and better perishables, including natural and organic products; expand on existing store brands, particularly such powerful Safeway brands as O Organics and Lucerne; expand store loyalty programs; expand health and wellness offerings; and adopt the Safeway information technology systems throughout the company.\n\nThe next chapter in Bob Miller's saga may yet prove to be the most exciting.\n\nBrian Cornell, Chairman, President and CEO--Target\n\n[6]\n\nMINNEAPOLIS -- When Brian Cornell was hired to replace Gregg Steinhafel as chairman, president and chief executive officer of Target Corp., it was clear that the board of directors perceived a need to transform the discount retailer. Not only had its entry into Canada turned into an embarrassing debacle, but sales momentum in the United States had slackened, aggravated by a major data breach at the end of 2013.\n\nCornell quickly launched a strategic review that took a cold-eyed look at Target's business performance. In January 2015 he pulled the plug on the Canadian operation, stating that management had been unable to find a way that Target Canada could reach profitability until at least 2021.\n\nDuring the company's investor conference in March, Cornell unveiled a program of extensive changes designed not only to restore Target's competitive muscle but to take Target into the retail landscape of the future as well. It clearly is also designed to eliminate the bureaucratic lethargy that appeared to have infected the Target organization.\n\n\"We know that, to compete today, speed and simplicity are critically important,\" he said. \"And we are looking at every opportunity to eliminate complexity, to facilitate efficiency and accountability, and to get our guests what they want and get it out to the market as quickly as possible.\"\n\nThe Target turnaround plan was encapsulated in five priorities that Cornell elucidated. The first recognized the compelling need to become an effective omnichannel retailer.\n\nThe reason for that is simple: As Cornell explained, the multi-channel shopper is, by far, Target's most valuable guest, shopping three times more frequently and generating triple the sales and more than two and a half times more margin dollars.\n\n\"In-store sales from these guests are much higher than store-only guests, meaning that digital engagement doesn't take away from our stores; it actually creates additional store trips and sales,\" Cornell elaborated.\n\nTarget's merchandising, which has always been a point of differentiation for the retailer, is also receiving a makeover. Four categories--style, baby, kids and wellness--have been identified as signature categories that are most important to Target guests, and the retailer is investing in those segments, which account for more than 25% of Target's sales, to inject more newness and differentiation into them.\n\nInterestingly, although food generates 20% of Target's sales, it is not considered a signature category and it is being repositioned with a greater emphasis on healthful food, including natural and organic items.\n\nThe third priority involves personalizing the online experience for Target's guests and tailoring in-store product assortments to local preferences and needs. \"This is not a new concept in retail,\" Cornell acknowledged. \"At Target we've just begun to scratch the surface in this opportunity. We'll be investing to build the capabilities to deliver a much more relevant in-store and online experience going forward.\"\n\nFormat development constitutes the fourth priority. Target had not publicized the performance of its initial eight CityTarget outlets or its single Target Express store, and the investment community had been unclear about the company's plans for them.\n\nCornell, however, is extremely upbeat about the CityTargets, which have generated \"phenomenal\" results, including gross margins in the high 30% range--about 10 basis points higher than the chain average. \"As a group, they have consistently comped in the mid-to-high single digits over the last couple of years,\" he explained. \"On average, these stores are about 25% smaller than a general merchandise store, and they generate higher average sales per store. This means that sales productivity is approximately double the average of our larger stores.\"\n\nThe Target Express test is being expanded from the single location near the University of Minnesota, with eight additional units slated to debut this year.\n\nThe fifth priority is centered on the simplification that Cornell referred to, and it involves a massive headquarters restructuring that is eliminating thousands of jobs. The goal is to produce a more efficient and lean management structure as well as free up capital to finance investments of about $2 billion.\n\nThe most recent initiative in this area was the bold decision to sell Target's entire pharmacy and clinic business to CVS Health for almost$1.9 billion. The agreement also calls for Target and CVS to open five to 10 co-developed TargetExpress stores, with an option to open additional small-format stores together over time.\n\nThe early results of these efforts appear to be promising. Target's first quarter earnings exceeded expectations, and the company raised its full-year profit guidance as a result. Importantly, comparable-store sales also grew more than anticipated, and sales in the new signature categories grew much more than total sales over the preceding six months.\n\nFor Cornell, his role at Target is the summit of a distinguished career that includes serving as CEO of Walmart's Sam's Club division and CEO of Michaels Stores Inc. Earlier he had been chief marketing officer at Safeway Inc. His resume also includes extensive executive experience at PepsiCo Inc., where he most recently served as CEO of the Americas Foods division before taking the reins at Target.\n\nCraig Jelinek, CEO--Costco\n\n[7]\n\nISSAQUAH, Wash. -- Costco Wholesale Corp. continues to outperform most of the retail industry while maintaining its unique values and culture. That is vitally important to chief executive officer Craig Jelinek, who has been with the company for 32 years.\n\n\"The culture, in our view, is the most important part of any organization,\" he said during an interview in late 2013.\n\nIt is a theme he returned to earlier this spring when addressing the annual convention of the Western Association of Food Chains. Companies can lose their way because they lose their core values and culture, he warned, concluding that a business can evolve but cannot afford to lose its values and culture.\n\nTo be sure, in many companies the official corporate culture is a fiction with no relevance to the experience of most employees. But that is not the case at Costco, and central to the company's ethos is a respect for employees that receives concrete expression in wages and benefits that far exceed the industry average.\n\nThe reasoning behind that approach is simple: Employees cannot give their best to their job if they are worried about paying the rent or medical expenses.\n\nAmid the debate over calls to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour, with some denouncing the figure as extravagant, Jelinek described that rate as barely a living wage in an interview with the Seattle Weekly News last year. He did acknowledge that while Costco, which had a starting wage of $11.50 per hour, could handle a minimum wage of $15, doing so could be a struggle for some small businesses.\n\nIn addition to remaining committed to the company's values and culture, another priority for Jelinek is ensuring that the company continues to implement its business model with consistency while engaged in an aggressive expansion program and facing a major leadership transition in the years ahead.\n\nHe pointed out that when he retires most of the current senior management will already have left and a new generation of leaders will be in place. Maintaining their commitment to the company's values and its proven business model will be paramount.\n\n\"People don't forget their jobs when the CEO changes,\" he said. \"And there aren't a lot of changes that have to be made when nothing is broken.\"\n\nCostco is opening around 25 warehouses a year, a pace that will double the retailer's business in 15 years. Domestically, it sees potential for perhaps another 400 to 500 warehouses in addition to the approximately 480 it now operates. Jelinek noted that because of Costco's popularity now, sales from new warehouses ramp up much faster than in the past.\n\nCostco is, however, increasingly looking to international markets for growth. Last year saw its debut on mainland Europe with a warehouse in Seville, Spain, and the company plans to open two more units in Madrid late this year and early in 2016.\n\nPlans for this year originally called for 30 openings, half of which would be in foreign markets, but that figure has been scaled back to 24, as some openings have been pushed into 2016.\n\nThe rapid growth does create challenges, though, one of which is sourcing. If Costco finds it difficult now to maintain adequate stocks of an extremely popular item--such as organic blueberries--that difficulty is going to escalate as more warehouses come on line.\n\nNevertheless, for now the company is continuing to perform at a level that most retailers can only envy. While foreign currency exchange rates and gasoline price deflation limited sales growth during the third fiscal quarter that ended in early May, Costco reported a comparable-store sales increase of 6% excluding those factors.\n\nCostco also maintained its steady growth in customer traffic, which rose 3.5%, year over year. The other component of same-store sales growth, average transaction, would have increased 2.5% with gas prices and foreign exchange factored out.\n\nAnother major ingredient in Costco's success has been its ability to maintain and grow membership. During the third quarter, membership renewal reached 88% worldwide, and 91% in the United States and Canada.\n\nLooking to the future, Costco not only enjoys huge scope for further deployment of its brick-and-mortar warehouses, but also is gearing up for expanded e-commerce. Over the past few years, the company has made major ongoing investments in modernizing its information technology platform to accommodate its store growth and e-commerce.\n\nWhile the warehouses clearly remain the main focus of the business, e-commerce sales are growing rapidly, rising 21% in local currencies during the third quarter. At present, Costco online operates in just four countries: the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Mexico. It is also active in Asia through Alibaba Tmall.\n\nIn addition, some of Costco's ancillary businesses, such as gasoline and travel services, have grown into major revenue sources.\n\nSo the horizon remains bright for Costco, and Jelinek sees little to obstruct the company's continued growth. \"We think we do very well even in tough times, and good companies build market share in tough times,\" he said. \"We're here for the long haul; we're not a short-term company.\"\n\nJeff Bezos, CEO--Amazon.com\n\n[8]\n\nSEATTLE -- These are heady days for Amazon.com Inc. founder and chief executive officer Jeff-Bezos.\n\nAfter the world's largest Internet retailer posted a solid profit and a 20% sales increase for the second quarter, the company's stock price soared and Bezos woke up the next day approximately $7 billion richer by some estimates. All in all, not a bad quarter for the entrepreneur who quit a well-paid Wall Street job to launch his Internet venture from the garage of a rented house in 1995.\n\nBezos and Amazon have achieved their incredible success by pursuing a singular path of inspired innovation. It is that seemingly inexhaustible and unrelenting wave of innovation that makes Amazon a constant and growing threat to brick-and-mortar retailers.\n\nA recent example is Amazon Dash, a button available to Amazon Prime customers for $4.99 that enables them to order a particular branded product with a push of the button and receive it within a few days. Each button represents a specific brand and item, such as Bounty paper towels, Tide detergent or Huggies diapers. When the test of the Dash button was announced in March, 256 buttons and name-brand products were available, and that number is sure to expand quickly.\n\nAmazon has already extended the concept to consumable replacement items through Dash Replacement Service. For example, a new water purifier from Brita LP will automatically reorder filters from Amazon after a predetermined amount of water has passed through the current filter. And Whirlpool Corp. is developing a dryer that will reorder detergent, while Brother Industries Ltd. is working on a printer that will reorder toner ink.\n\nA recent research note from Piper Jaffray analysts predicted that automated replenishment \"will be the next wave of e-commerce and that Amazon will dominate this segment. If they are right, the implications for traditional retailers are serious.\"\n\nHowever, even without Dash, Amazon has already had a profound impact on many product categories because of its ability to sustain double-digit sales growth for far longer than competitors expect. For example, analysts have noted that if Amazon's sales of a category such as diapers grows at a 20% to 25% rate for five or six years, by the fifth and sixth year, the sales base of that growth is much larger, and suddenly Amazon's business is growing at an exponential rate, doubling every two or three years.\n\nSo it is hardly surprising that Procter & Gamble Co. named Amazon as one of its top five customers for its diaper brands in 2012. A recent analyst's report from Cowen & Co. predicts that Amazon will pass Macy's Inc. as the largest apparel retailer in 2017.\n\nLast month the company celebrated its 20th anniversary with a special promotion, Prime Day, which featured thousands of special deals, but only for Prime members. According to the company, customers bought more items on Prime Day than on Black Friday in 2014.\n\nCustomers pay a $99 annual fee for the benefits of Prime membership, which include two-day shipping at no extra cost as well as other services.\n\nPrime is growing impressively enough that Amazon has expanded it to three additional cities, including the first international location, London. Analysts estimate that the subscription fees alone generate approximately $4 billion in revenue.\n\nAnother major growth driver for Amazon has been Amazon Marketplace, which allows third party sellers to sell through the Amazon website, in some cases using Amazon fulfillment centers for distribution. Currently more than 40% of the units sold through Amazon come from more than 2 million third-party sellers worldwide, Bezos stated in his 2014 letter to shareholders.\n\n\"By allowing third parties to offer products side by side, we became more attractive to customers, which drew even more sellers,\" he explained. \"This also added to our economies of scale, which we passed along by lowering prices and eliminating shipping fees for qualifying orders. Having introduced these programs in the U.S, we rolled them out as quickly as we could to our other geographies. The result was a marketplace that became seamlessly integrated with all of our global websites.\"\n\nIt is difficult to see when Amazon's growth trajectory will begin its descent. Its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services, claims more than 1 million customers, including a growing number of large corporations, and has generated $5 billion in revenue and is even profitable, according to the company.\n\nPerhaps Amazon's most unlikely success is the fact that it is Wall Street's darling in spite of the fact that it rejects the traditional Wall Street metrics of financial success, which center around profitability and investor returns.\n\nIn fact, because the company had reported losses in three of its last five fiscal quarters, its unexpected $92 million profit in the second quarter was enough of a surprise to Wall Street to drive the stock's price up to an all-time high of $580 per share. That pushed Amazon's market capitalization past that of Walmart, which still dwarfs Amazon in terms of sales and profits.\n\nSo far, innovation and creativity have trumped the bottom line in driving the company's value.\n\nRick Dreiling, Chairman--Dollar General\n\n[9]\n\nGOODLETTS-VILLE, Tenn. -- This year marks the end of the Rick Dreiling era at Dollar General Corp., an era that has seen the rapid evolution of the chain into a new type of retailer and a financial performance that is the envy of the retail industry. Dreiling relinquished the chief executive officer's role as planned in early June, but will continue to serve as chairman and senior advisor until the end of fiscal 2015 next January.\n\nDreiling will leave behind a company well equipped to continue on its impressive growth trajectory, with a solid leadership team that includes key leaders whom he recruited. In fact, Dollar General today is in almost every major way Rick Dreiling's creation.\n\nWhen he joined the company in January2008, Dollar General was a sizable chain with more than 8,000 stores but no clear strategic direction. Its merchandising and assortments still reflected its heritage as a low-end dollar store focusing on closeouts and remaindered items.\n\nDreiling soon changed that. His first step was to define the retailer's strategy, which it retains today. That strategy involves driving productive sales growth; enhancing gross margin; leveraging process improvements and information technology to lower costs; and strengthening and expanding Dollar General's culture of serving others.\n\nHis next step was to form an executive team capable of bringing Dollar General into the 21st century. A key addition was Todd Vasos, who succeeded Dreiling as CEO in June. Vasos was appointed division president and chief merchandising officer, and immediately set about rebuilding the merchandising organization from the ground up with personnel from various retail channels, all with a solid grasp of category management disciplines.\n\nAnother key addition was John Flanigan, who took the role of senior vice president of global supply chain. Like Vasos and Dreiling, Flanigan was a veteran of Longs Drugs Stores, but he also shared with Dreiling experience at Safeway Inc., where he had been vice president of logistics.\n\nThese key players joined some valuable incumbents who played instrumental roles in the transformation of Dollar General. David Tehle, chief financial officer, has retired this year, while Kathleen Guion, who was division president of store operations and store development, retired at the end of 2012.\n\nDreiling's career had included time in both the supermarket channel at Safeway and chain drug retailing at Longs and Duane Reade, where he led a successful turnaround before coming to Dollar General. He clearly perceived the potential to convert Dollar General into a small-box neighborhood discount store, with a product assortment geared toward daily consumables to drive traffic, and offering an assortment that skillfully blends the store brand with respected name brands that conferred legitimacy and built customer trust.\n\nThat strategy was not fundamentally unlike that of major competitors, but Dollar General executed it far more successfully. It would be difficult for any other mass market retailer to approach the numbers that the company has achieved during Dreiling's tenure. Since the end of Dreiling's first year at the helm in January 2009, sales have expanded 81% to $18.91 billion while net profit has soared 885% to $1.07 billion. The store base has expanded to just over 12,000, and the company sees opportunities for another 10,000 or so locations.\n\nIf Dreiling has one regret, it is probably the failure to acquire chief rival Family Dollar Stores Inc. during the past year. Dollar General entered the bidding after Family Dollar announced it had agreed to a buyout by Dollar Tree Inc., and although Dollar General offered Family Dollar shareholders a higher price, regulators placed hurdles in Dollar General's path that ultimately proved too high to overcome.\n\n\"The scale of this combination would have provided better value and greater selection to customers of both Dollar General and Family Dollar,\" Dreiling said in January, when Family Dollar shareholders approved the Dollar Tree offer. \"Despite our best efforts over the past few months, Family Dollar's lack of engagement and a contracted transaction time line ultimately prevented us from completing this transaction.\"\n\nHowever, the outcome might well prove to be a blessing for Dollar General and its shareholders. The company would have had to dedicate considerable resources and management attention to dealing with Family Dollar's problems, rather than focus on continued growth. With a store base only slightly smaller than the Dollar Tree/Family Dollar combination and a robust pipeline of new stores, it will be no surprise if Dollar General soon reclaims the position of largest small-box discount retailer, both in terms of sales and store count.\n\nThe more intriguing question, though, is what the future might hold for Dreiling, who is only 61. There would seem to be few potential opportunities of interest in the massively consolidated chain drug business, but the supermarket channel is another question altogether, since there remain several multi-regional and large regional chains. There would seem to be no shortage of companies that could benefit from Rick Dreiling's leadership.\n\nGalen Weston, President, Executive Chairman--Loblaw\n\n[10]\n\nBRAMPTON, Ontario -- Galen Weston has exercised operational leadership of Loblaw Cos. for a little over a year and, based on its recent financial results, the company is performing solidly despite intense competition and other hurdles.\n\nWeston, who had been executive chairman, added the role of president when Vicente Trius suddenly left the company in the middle of last year. As Weston acknowledged at the time, Trius had made a strong positive contribution during his tenure, which began in 2011.\n\nBut Weston is clearly in control now, and he is making the decisions that will determine the retailer's future. While Loblaw's businesses include real estate and financial services, it is the retail operation that generates 98% of its revenues and 91% of operating profit.\n\nMost recently, the company revealed last month that it will close 52 underperforming stores--including food, drug and apparel stores--over the course of the next 12 months. While the closures are expected to reduce sales by approximately $300 million, they are projected to increase operating profit by $35 million to $40 million (Canadian).\n\nDuring a quarterly conference call with analysts, Weston agreed that the decision reflects an increased management focus on returns on invested capital.\n\n\"We have always thought that we are pretty disciplined in terms of the way we invest capital,\" he said. \"Certainly when you have a big debt load as we do and your growth is not as significant as perhaps it has been in previous periods of the company's history, [you are] getting better at managing capital efficiently, making sure that you don't have inefficient assets in the business.\"\n\nWeston noted, however, that the company would normally shutter between 10 and 15 stores every year, so the total of 52, while an increase, is not a drastic move and does not represent any strategic change in any of its businesses. \"We continue to plan to invest and grow in our network,\" he said.\n\nThe retailer's second quarter results should have provided any reassurance investors might have needed. The retail businesses are performing very well indeed in a difficult environment.\n\nRetail sales rose 2.2% to $10.32 billion, with the food stores up 1.9% to $7.63 billion, while the top line at Shoppers Drug Mart (SDM) increased 3.1% to $2.69 billion. Both adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) showed strong single-digit growth.\n\nCanada's largest grocer has faced increasing competition from Walmart, which is opening more Supercenters in the country, and from such domestic rivals as Sobeys Inc., which acquired Canada Safeway last year to bolster its own competitive portfolio. Nonetheless, Loblaw food stores achieved both higher average basket size and increased customer traffic during the quarter, which in turn drove same-store sales growth.\n\nMoreover, the acquisition of SDM, Canada's largest drug chain, continues to look like a brilliant strategic move on the company's part. Not only has it given Loblaw a dominant position in a segment of the retail industry that promises to grow faster than food retailing, it is providing greater sales and profit growth in the near term.\n\nLike the rest of the retail pharmacy industry in Canada, Loblaw and SDM face obstacles in the form of provincial health care reforms that have targeted pharmacy profitability to lower overall health care costs.\n\n\"We are working as collaboratively as possible with governments to identify innovative services that can both reduce costs and improve patient outcomes,\" Weston said. \"Our business remains focused on the strategic framework that has supported our progress over the last year, providing the best in food experience, best in health and beauty, operational excellence, and growth.\"\n\nMany, if not most, retailers avow that they are dedicated to innovation, but Loblaw has for decades walked the walk as well as talked the talk. The company pioneered the development of high-quality private label products in North America and can claim three of the top consumer brands in Canada as its own; President's Choice, Life Brand and noname. It has even ventured into the apparel business with the Joe Fresh fashion label.\n\nThe combination with SDM added the highly regarded Shoppers Optimum loyalty program to Loblaw's PC and PC Plus program. As a result, more than one in three Canadians carry one or both of the company's customer loyalty cards.\n\nAs Weston pointed out, the company is investing to keep these programs relevant in the digital age. \"In the second quarter we launched My Optimum, a fully digital one-to-one customer-centric version of the Optimum loyalty program,\" he said, adding that more than 700,000 customers had already registered for the digital Optimum account, which enables them to load and redeem personalized digital offers directly to their card.\n\nWeston has good reason to be upbeat about the future. Despite a competitive retail environment and a host of governmental challenges in the health care sphere, Loblaw is well positioned to prosper, thanks to the initiatives that have been carried out over the past several years.\n\nSteve Anderson, President, CEO--National Association of Chain Drug Stores\n\nARLINGTON, Va. -- The National Association of Chain Drug Stores has been energized under the leadership of Steve Anderson. The trade group has succeeded in winning wide-ranging recognition of the vital role of retail pharmacy in the swiftly evolving health care landscape, particularly since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAwareness of the industry and its contribution has been greatly increased on Capitol Hill, in no small part due to the grassroots program created by Anderson, NACDS Rxlmpact Day. The aptly named event brings NACDS members to Washington to meet with their congressional representatives and present their views on industry issues.\n\nThe association has also aggressively pursued means to enable its members to broaden their health care role with new services. A recent example is the point-of-care testing certificate program launched in partnership with the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Pharmacy. The certificate program trains participants to administer a variety of point-of-care tests and health assessments.\n\n\"More and more patients are looking to their pharmacists for new services that help maintain their health and wellness,\" Anderson said at the time of the launch in May. \"One of the great things about this NACDS certificate program is that it demonstrates the extensive education and training of pharmacists, and that it will create even greater access to services that can help improve patient health.\"\n\nUnder Anderson's leadership, NACDS has also significantly enhanced the value of its annual trade show, Total Store Expo. For example, the show now includes a program dubbed Meet the Market, which brings together retail merchants with suppliers in prescheduled 10-minute sessions. In addition, NACDS provides webinars for both suppliers and retailers to coach them on how to prepare for and get the most out of their meetings.\n\nIn addition to Meet the Market and meetings on the show floor, attendees can benefit from an array of highly relevant Insight Sessions. This year's show, for example, offers no fewer than 21 sessions, dealing with such topics as the ACA, business planning and logistics, innovation, genomics, and digital trends.\n\nNeal Ashe, President, CEO, Global E-Commerce--Walmart\n\nBENTONVILLE, Ark. -- As the head of Walmart's e-commerce operation, Neal Ashe arguably is on the leading edge of the most exciting segment of the retailer's business.\n\nIt is the fastest-growing part of Walmart, with global e-commerce sales up 22% in fiscal 2015 to around $12.5 billion.\n\nThe growth is being driven by serious investment, which totaled approximately $1 billion in fiscal 2015 and is budgeted at $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion for the current 2016 fiscal year. The investment for this year will include technology and infrastructure, with new fulfillment centers in Georgia and Pennsylvania, each more than 1 million square feet. New fulfillment centers are also slated to open in Brazil and China.\n\n\"We have delivered the core components of our new global technology platform,\" Ashe said during Walmart's annual analysts conference last October. \"We are expanding our next-generation fulfillment network to reach our customers fast and efficiently, and we're building new data capabilities to enhance our customer experience.\"\n\nDesigning and implementing its own proprietary technology platform, known as Pangea, was a massive achievement that Ashe emphasized during a presentation in June at the Goldman Sachs Dot-Commerce Day Conference. \"We built a cloud; we built a back-end logic system; we built sites, apps and mobile Web experiences,\" he elaborated. \"And we built all the tools necessary to run an e-commerce business. And we've done that inside of three years.\"\n\nThe goal of this enormously ambitious activity is to integrate digital and brick-and-mortar retail in ways that please and energize customers, as well as ways that enable them to find and buy what they want at Walmart anytime and anywhere, including home delivery or pickup at a convenient store location.\n\n\"We're growing faster than the market in each one of the countries in which we operate,\" Ashe said in October, referring to global e-commerce. \"And we expect to continue to grow faster than the market in the future. We're focused on building an enduring business, and we're making good choices about where to invest and what to build. And we're making the investments necessary to win in the long term.\"\n\nRichard Ashworth, President, Pharmacy and Retail Operations--WBA\n\nDEERFIELD, Ill. -- There was a time not that long ago when the leadership ranks of Walgreen Co. were filled with executives who had spent not years but decades with the company. In recent years that has changed, and particularly since the merger last December that created Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA), many top positions are being filled with new names and new faces.\n\nConsequently, it is a bit surprising to find a longtime Walgreens veteran, Richard Ashworth, in charge of pharmacy and retail operations for the U.S. chain. But Ashworth's career and his present responsibilities in fact reflect the transformation the company is undergoing.\n\nAshworth began his Walgreens career as a part-time employee in 1992, when the chain was enjoying reliable growth with a consistent and conservative strategy that had served it well for years. But as Ashworth's career progressed through the roles of pharmacist, store manager, district manager and up the executive ladder, the chain drug marketplace was undergoing tumultuous change that called for a new approach.\n\nThe two biggest changes, according to Ashworth, are the empowerment of customers through their access to data and a rapidly altering competitive landscape, as different kinds of companies combine and partner in new ways. The creation of WBA is a prime example of the latter trend, having grown out of the 2012 strategic partnership between Walgreens and Alliance Boots GmbH.\n\nAs a result of that partnership, Ashworth spent part of 2013 and 2014 in the United Kingdom overseeing the development of health care strategy at Boots. He was promoted to his current post last September. The combination of pharmacy and front-end operations under one executive represents a new management approach and a new, more holistic, view of the customer. A number of initiatives designed to improve execution, particularly in the stores, are under way. One effort involves restructuring the retailer's field organization. Ashworth and his team are also focused on how merchandising programs can be simplified and made easier to execute properly.\n\n\"By putting these two strategies together, we can unlock the potential of our team members,\" Ashworth says.\n\nOrnella Barra, President, CEO, Global Wholesale & Int'l Retail, and Exec. VP--WBA\n\nDEERFIELD, Ill. -- The merger of Walgreen Co. with Alliance Boots GmbH created a global health care company offering services that span retailing, wholesaling and beyond. A pharmacist by training, Ornella Barra now leads the global wholesale and international retail businesses for the new company, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA).\n\nPrior to the merger, Barra had been chief executive officer of Alliance Healthcare, Alliance Boots' pharmaceutical wholesale division. She had led that business on an impressive growth track that involved the creation of a new business model and new relationships.\n\nThe division now has wholesaling operations in 19 countries and delivers pharmaceutical products to more than 200,000 dispensing points from more than 350 distribution centers. The wholesaler typically is among the three largest pharmaceutical distributors in the countries in which it operates.\n\n\"We realized that we had to take our relationship with our main stakeholders--manufacturers upstream and pharmacists downstream--to another level,\" she explained during WBA's Analyst Day in April. \"From one centering on price negotiation, we had to move to a true partnership based on the development of a new service that added value to our and their businesses. In other words, we had to move to a vertical evolution of our businesses.\"\n\nThe wholesale division of WBA occupies a position at the fulcrum of the pharmaceuticals supply chain, said Barra, and has partnerships with approximately 60 manufacturers.\n\nAlliance Healthcare also services the largest network of independent pharmacies in Europe, Alphega, which now tallies more than 6,000 locations in eight countries.\n\nAdditional growth clearly lies ahead, including emerging markets. Alliance Healthcare already has strong footholds in China and Turkey.\n\n\"Wholesaling enables us to get a better knowledge from inside, to reinforce our presence with our full offering,\" she pointed out. \"In any new market we enter we have the possibility of bringing unique know-how, which gives us a unique market proposition.\"\n\nDick Boer, CEO--Ahold\n\nAMSTERDAM -- Since he became chief executive officer of Ahold NV in 2011, Dick Boer has led a search for a strategy that can sustain the international supermarket operator in a rapidly changing marketplace. That strategy, called Reshaping Retail, recognizes the increasing importance of technology and convenience in food retailing.\n\nHowever, the biggest recent initiative Boer has authored is a traditional growth tactic: mergers and acquisitions. Ahold and Delhaize Group, based in Brussels, agreed in June to a \"merger of equals\" that would create a retail network of more than 6,500 stores in the United States and Europe, generating sales of approximately 54.1 billion euros ($59.8 billion). Boer would become CEO of the combined company.\n\n\"The proposed merger with Delhaize is an exciting opportunity to create an even stronger and more innovative retail leader for our customers, associates and shareholders worldwide,\" Boer said when the deal was announced. \"With extraordinary reach, diverse products and formats, and great people, we are bringing together two world-class organizations to deliver even more for the communities we serve.\"\n\nThe transaction is expected to be completed in the middle of 2016, assuming regulatory clearance and approval by the two companies' shareholders. Under the terms of the agreement, Delhaize shareholders will receive 4.75 shares of Ahold ordinary shares for each Delhaize share owned. Ahold shareholders will own 61% of the new company; Delhaize investors, 39%.\n\nIn the United States, the combination will create a formidable regional supermarket organization with chains operating from New England into the Southeast.\n\nWhether that will enable those chains to compete more effectively against low-price rivals such as Aldi and Walmart, or more upscale chains such as Wegmans Food Markets and Publix Super Markets Inc., remains a big question.\n\nIn Europe, the new company would enjoy the dominant market share in both the Netherlands and Belgium, although Delhaize Group is facing challenges in both Belgium and southeastern Europe. The combined organization expects to benefit from synergies of about 500 million euros per year by the third year after completion of the transaction.\n\nRosalind Brewer, President, CEO--Sam's Club\n\nBENTONVILLE, Ark. -- These are challenging days for Rosalind Brewer and her leadership team at Sam's Club. Although the division ended fiscal 2015 with decent if unexciting numbers, it has gotten off to a slow start in the current year despite investments made last year to ignite growth.\n\n\"Our first quarter results were disappointing, as comp sales missed guidance, and we delivered softer net sales and profit than last year,\" she said in prepared remarks for analysts. \"This year is one of investment and testing, and we're very focused on strengthening our foundation for business improvement in the longer term.\"\n\nThat effort is concentrated in four initiatives. The first involves upgrading the merchandise assortment to inject newness and differentiation into the chain's offering. An example is a 20% increase in organic offerings since the beginning of the year.\n\n\"Our merchant teams continue to work on bringing newness and trend-right merchandise into the clubs,\" Brewer commented. \"We still have opportunities for improvement, and we continue to invest in price to drive value for our members.\"\n\nThe second initiative is focused on membership. A new position, chief member officer, oversees a team of data scientists and marketing and insights professionals that is developing new, targeted membership efforts.\n\nThird, new programs to enhance member value are being launched. One example is a pharmacy program called Free/4/10, which provides Plus members free or discounted prescriptions for five costly health issues: Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, vitamin D deficiency, prostate health and mental health.\n\n\"This program is being merchandised at our pharmacies and contributed to a number of Plus [membership] upgrades since its rollout,\" Brewer commented. \"We are optimistic about its ability to continue to drive membership growth.\"\n\nFinally, significant long-term investments are being made in the Sam's Club e-commerce business. Both the Walmart U.S. and International divisions also stand to benefit from massive investments being made in Walmart's global e-commerce operation.\n\nCharles Butt, Chairman, CEO--H-E-B\n\nSAN ANTONIO -- As chairman and chief executive officer of H-E-B, Charles Butt leads one of the most dynamic regional supermarket chains in the United States. He is the grandson of founder Florence Butt, who started the business in 1905 with a single store in Kerrville, Texas, and the son of Howard E. Butt, who took over the business and whose initials now constitute the chain's banner.\n\nCharles Butt appears in more headlines these days due to his wealth rather than his involvement with the supermarket chain. This spring, when Forbes magazine published its 2015 list of the world's billionaires, Butt and his family had broken into the top 100, ranking 94th with a net worth of $10.4 billion.\n\nAs a private company, H-E-B no longer releases any financial data, but its 2014 sales are estimated to have reached $20.2 billion. The chain operates about 358 stores, mostly in Texas, although it has a few across the border in Mexico.\n\nH-E-B has successfully expanded from its power base in south central Texas into the Houston market, and it appears poised to expand its footprint in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, where it operates five of its Central Market outlets. Press reports have indicated that the company has purchased more than 12 potential locations in the area.\n\nThe company's growth has been aided by its willingness to adapt and evolve, whether that meant developing new store formats or expanding its offerings. Among the most recent innovations for the retailer are in-store restaurants, which now can be found in three locations, with plans for another three by the end of 2016.\n\nH-E-B supports the communities it serves with environmental initiatives, disaster relief, educational support and commitment to diversity. The company regularly allocates 5% of its pretax profit to charities.\n\nEducation has been a particularly strong focus: The company awards $800,000 in cash to deserving teachers, principals and school districts through its Excellence in Education awards. In 2012, Butt told the Houston Chronicle that education had long been a passion of his.\n\n\"I've gotten myself pretty involved in it because I feel the future of Texas is tied to what we do about this,\" he said.\n\nCasey Carl, Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer--Target\n\nMINNEAPOLIS -- As chief strategy and innovation officer, Casey Carl stands at the very vortex of the transformation of Target Corp. Carl was promoted to this position, reporting directly to chairman and chief executive officer Brian Cornell, last December.\n\nDuring Target's annual investors' meeting in March, Carl succinctly described his role: \"My enterprise strategy team sets the strategic agenda for the corporation, identifies the critical priorities and investments, and determines key capabilities needed to position Target for sustainable market share growth.\"\n\nCarl's investor presentation in March included a blunt assessment of the missteps that led to a change of CEOs at Target. First, he said, was an excessive reliance on promotions that decoupled the retailer's Expect More, Pay Less brand promise.\n\nIn addition, although technology had swiftly evolved from a support function to a critical core capability, the company remained too reliant on third-party vendors and consequently lacked inhouse expertise. Finally, Target reacted too slowly to consumers' embrace of digital technology.\n\nThat has changed. As Carl stat ed, to become a growth company in retail, the future is digital. And Target has moved aggressively to seize that future, bringing digital expertise in-house and investing heavily in technology and supply chain infrastructure.\n\nCarl noted that 98% of Target's shoppers shop digitally, and most use mobile devices to do so. \"An important focus for us isn't how we grow mobile as a sales channel, but how we will apply a mobile first approach in every way we engage with our guests,\" he said. \"Every touch point is an opportunity to inspire, to anticipate a need and to help simplify our guests' busy lives.\"\n\nIn addition to his strategy work, Carl leads a center of excellence that was established to centralize all data and analytics, which had been decentralized. An important achievement has been the creation of a personalization engine that combines in-store and online purchase and browsing data.\n\nTarget is exploring and testing potential growth drivers, including products, services and even platforms. \"We need to be creative in imagining new ways to leverage our existing strengths and assets,\" Carl said.\n\nDavid Cheesewright, President, CEO--Walmart International\n\nBENTONVILLE, Ark. -- Although growth has slowed at Walmart International, the division continues to perform respectably, and David Cheesewright has the enviable task of building on strength rather than fixing something broken.\n\nNonetheless, International is arguably the most complex of Walmart's businesses, in part because it operates almost 6,300 stores with 750,000 associates in 27 different countries across five continents. And because much of Walmart International is composed of acquired businesses, it operates a wide array of retail formats, ranging from hypermarkets/supercenters to small kiosks.\n\nCheesewright and his team currently are focused on a number of strategic priorities, including driving comparable-store sales growth, accelerating e-commerce, actively managing the store portfolio and strengthening such key enablers as being the lowest-cost operator in its markets.\n\nIn the division's major markets (Canada, Mexico, China, Brazil and the United Kingdom) comparable-store sales growth has been positive recently, except in the United Kingdom, where food deflation and intense com petition have stymied Asda PLC. Comp-store sales also lagged in Japan in the first quarter of fiscal 2016.\n\nLike Walmart's other divisions, International is benefiting from huge investments in global e-commerce. In the U.K., Asda has been achieving double-digit compstore sales growth with its grocery home shopping program, which will undoubtedly be launched in other markets as well.\n\n\"We have a newly created 'international acceleration team' based in the U.K. that is building close partnerships with our markets to speed up the adoption of grocery home shopping processes and technologies,\" Cheesewright said during the company's first quarter conference call.\n\nCheesewright had previously singled out three markets for priority attention. In China, the goal is to establish a platform for sustainable growth, while Brazil is a turnaround situation. In Mexico, which has been a strong performer through most of the years of Walmart's ownership, the objective is to reenergize the business.\n\nAll three markets have demonstrated recent progress, Cheesewright told analysts at the company's annual meeting in June.\n\nEd Crenshaw, CEO--Publix Super Markets\n\nLAKELAND, Fla. -- Publix Super Markets Inc. is a sterling example of what an employee-owned company can achieve. The regional chain, which is the largest majority employee-owned company in the nation, has not only maintained its position in its core market of Florida, but has successfully expanded into Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama and Tennessee.\n\nEd Crenshaw is the chain's fourth chief executive officer. Although he is the grandson of founder George Jenkins, he began his Publix career as a grocery clerk in 1974, the year after he graduated from college. He subsequently rose through the ranks and was named director of retail operations for the Lakeland division in 1984. In 1991 he led Publix's first foray outside Florida as vice president of the new Atlanta division. Two years later he was named executive vice president of retailing, and he was named president in 1996.\n\nLast year saw Publix rev up its expansion plans, entering the Charlotte, N.C., area. It was Publix's first new market in 10 years and the first new state since 2002, when it entered Tennessee. In April, Publix acquired two locations from Lowes Foods Stores in Cary and Gastonia, N.C.\n\n\"We've opened eight stores in North Carolina within the past year, solidifying our commitment to growth within the state,\" Crenshaw said at the time of the purchase.\n\nPublix now operates 1,103 stores, 341 of which are outside its home market of Florida. Meanwhile, the company continues to generate an exceptional financial performance, including what might be the highest net profit ratio in the supermarket industry. For fiscal 2014, Publix reported $1.74 billion (up 4.9%) in net profit, which amounted to 5.7% of sales. Neither Kroger Co., with a net ratio of 1.6%, nor upscale Whole Foods Markets Inc., whose 2014 bottom line totaled 4.1% of sales, approached Publix's accomplishment.\n\nPublix has also been named one of Fortune magazine's \"100 Best Companies to Work For\" every year since 1998, and ranked first in the Temkin Customer Experience Ratings this year. Its pharmacies have been rated highest in customer satisfaction among supermarket pharmacies by J.D. Power and Associates every year since 2010.\n\nRandy Edeker, Chairman, President, CEO--Hy-Vee\n\nWEST DES MOINES, Iowa -- Hy-Vee Inc. is one of the most innovative and distinctive supermarket chains in the country, and Randy Edeker, who has been chairman, president and chief executive officer since 2012, is determined to maintain that distinction.\n\n\"We're not afraid to be a little revolutionary in what we're doing,\" he said during an interview earlier this year. \"We see a national evolution in the business coming, and when that's happening and you don't revolutionize, you're going to be left out.\"\n\nAs an example, he points out that Hy-Vee committed to building a natural and organic food business 20 years ago, and has experienced double-digit increases in that segment ever since. The chain has also positioned itself as a genuine health and wellness retailer, staffing stores with full-time dietitians and adding in-store health clinics. Last year it acquired a specialty pharmacy, Amber Pharmacy, with which it had partnered since 2010.\n\nThat strategy has not, however, led Hy-Vee to lose sight of its primary identity as a purveyor of food. Many of its stores are staffed with trained chefs, and the chain is at the forefront of a movement to make supermarkets centers of culinary excellence, where customers can not only buy high-quality food, but also learn how to prepare it or have it prepared for them.\n\nEdeker began his career with HyVee 34 years ago as a part-time employee. He rose through the managerial ranks, starting as a store director, and eventually was appointed executive vice president and chief operating officer. He was named president in 2009. This year he is also serving as the chairman of the board of the National Association of Chain Drug Stores.\n\nOne of the distinguishing characteristics of Hy-Vee is the fact that the company is employee-owned. In addition, though, the organization is highly decentralized, and store directors have the power to make decisions, including assortment choices, and run their stores as if they owned them--which they do, of course, to a degree.\n\nMore change lies in store. HyVee is poised to enter the highly competitive Minneapolis/St. Paul food market, and it is developing new formats, including a smaller store concept, while exploring the challenging world of e-commerce as well.\n\nLinda Filler, President, Retail Products, and Chief Merchant--Walgreens\n\nDEERFIELD, Ill. -- Analytical tools play an increasingly critical role in creating effective merchandising, but imagination is still a vital skill for a merchandiser, according to Linda Filler, Walgreens' chief merchant.\n\n\"There is part of a merchant's role that's about imagining the future, and being sure that we move with innovation and imagination and creativity toward a future state, so there is an art to it, with a judgment factor that may not always be data fueled,\" says Filler. \"That's important to a merchant's capabilities.\"\n\nAt the same time, Filler appreciates the enhanced capabilities that technology delivers, particularly in such areas as media and promotional planning. Holder of an M.B.A. degree from Harvard Business School, she is well equipped to balance the art and science of merchandising.\n\nFiller joined Walgreens as president of retail products and chief merchandising officer in January. She had most recently served as president of Claire's Stores Inc., a specialty retailer catering to young women, teens and girls, with more than 3,000 stores in 17 countries as well as 450 franchised outlets worldwide.\n\nPrior to that, Filler was executive vice president and chief merchandising officer of the Sam's Club division of Walmart. Before entering the retail world, she was an executive vice president at Kraft Foods Group Inc. and also held leadership roles in the Hanes Brands division of Sara Lee Corp. That background, spanning both the retail and supplier spheres, has given Filler a valuable collaborative approach as a merchant.\n\n\"With her deep experience across a broad range of product lines and strong supplier relationships, Linda has the expertise to understand what our customers want and to innovate quickly to create an experience that drives loyalty and results,\" Walgreens president Alex Gourlay said at the time of her appointment.\n\nFiller's background and collaborative spirit suit her particularly well to be part of the Walgreens leadership team at this juncture, as the retailer strives to regain its position as America's favorite drug store through Gourlay's One Plan strategy. \"All of us are very geared toward a common goal,\" she says. \"It's a great feeling when you're at that high-performing level and you have that vibe.\"\n\nJosh Flum, Executive VP, Pharmacy Services--CVS Health\n\nWOONSOCKET, R.I. -- Earlier this year Josh Flum was promoted to a new position as part of changes designed to better align the elements of CVS Health's organizational structure and thus drive its growth strategy more effectively.\n\nAs executive vice president of pharmacy services, Flum now leads a new enterprise product innovation and development team as well as a new enterprise pharmacy growth team. He is also responsible for retail pharmacy operations, pharmacy professional services and payer relations.\n\nThe enterprise product innovation and development team represents a move to integrate retail product development with CVS Health's existing pharmacy benefits management team to create what the company calls \"a centralized center of excellence for end-to-end product development.\" Anita Allemand, senior vice president of enterprise product innovation and development, leads that team and reports to Flum.\n\nThe enterprise pharmacy growth team, meanwhile, is tasked with developing strategies to increase CVS' pharmacy share across all channels. It is led by Grant Pill, who has been promoted to senior vice president of enterprise pharmacy growth. Both Allemand and Pill report to Flum, who continues to report to Helena Foulkes, president of CVS/pharmacy.\n\nFlum's new role illustrates the rapid evolution of pharmacy in the changing health care landscape. \"Community pharmacy practice is evolving from being just a dispenser of medications to a provider of services,\" he says. \"Whether it is by providing medication counseling, influencing patients about the importance of medication adherence, administering vaccinations or helping patients understand complex drug therapy issues, CVS pharmacists are playing an increasingly important role as health care providers in their communities.\"\n\nLike Foulkes, Flum's career has not followed a typical path for retail executives. A1997 graduate of Yale Law School, he served as a law clerk in the U.S. Court of Appeals before joining a Washington law firm. He later joined the Boston Consulting Group before entering the CVS management ranks. His career has advanced rapidly, having been promoted to his previous position of senior vice president of pharmacy services in 2011.\n\nGreg Foran, President, CEO--Walmart U.S.\n\nBENTONVILLE, Ark. -- Greg Foran was appointed leader of Walmart's largest division not only to improve its results but to effect much-needed change. Since he took the job in July 2014, some encouraging progress has been made, but, as Foran himself acknowledges, much remains to be done.\n\nDuring the last two quarters, Walmart U.S. has achieved same-store sales growth that met management's goals, driven by increased customer traffic--the lifeblood of same-store sales. That achievement followed a disturbing string of six consecutive quarters of declining customer counts.\n\nRecognizing that improving the customer experience requires store associates who are engaged and motivated, the company announced a significant investment in higher wages and training programs for its U.S. associates in February. Also, a scheduling system is being piloted to give associates more predictable hours and greater scheduling flexibility.\n\nSome of the changes that have been made reverse cost-cutting measures that had unforeseen negative effects on execution and sales. The role of department manager, which had been eliminated, has been restored.\n\n\"These department managers will have responsibility for a smaller area of the store, ensuring that they have the knowledge and the time to engage with both the customers and store associates, driving an overall better experience,\" Foran explained during Walmart's first quarter conference call in May.\n\nWhile these operational changes have perhaps received the most attention, Foran and his team are also addressing a number of merchandising issues ranging from assortment to instock (also an operational issue) to managing fresh food.\n\n\"Merchandising is the key to our success,\" Foran told analysts in June. \"We know that even if we run really clean, tidy, friendly stores, that's actually not the DNA that makes Walmart work. What makes Walmart work is when you excite customers with merchandise and they go in there and they see something and they go, 'Wow, I just can't believe [this].\"'\n\nForan also says there are opportunities to improve space allocations, adjacencies, ambience, navigation and flow in both the Supercenter and Neighborhood Market formats.\n\nHelena Foulkes, President--CVS/pharmacy\n\nWOONSOCKET, R.I. -- It would be difficult to list in this space all the contributions that Helena Foulkes has made to CVS Health in the course of a career that began in 1992. Her executive experience across several different areas of the organization through the years has perfectly qualified her to lead the company's retail business.\n\nFoulkes was promoted to her current position in January 2014. Her experience is not limited to the retail side of CVS; she also served as senior vice president of health services from May 2008 to January 2009.\n\nFoulkes was responsible for developing CVS' ExtraCare loyalty program, generally considered the most widely recognized customer loyalty program in the industry. She also played a key role in the development of CVS' Internet strategy, which produced the launch of cvs.com in 1999. Foulkes is one of the few senior executives in retailing today to have both an undergraduate and graduate business degree from Harvard University.\n\nFoulkes is currently leading a revitalization of CVS/pharmacy's front-end business, a move necessitated by the decision to stop selling tobacco products. That decision delivered a significant blow to front-end sales that affected more than the tobacco category since it reduced customer traffic.\n\nNow the chain is revamping its assortments to align itself with the corporation's health focus. \"After we stopped selling tobacco, the No. 1 thing customers asked us about was healthy food, which is why we are rolling out healthier choices in our consumables assortments,\" she said. \"We are also driving tighter enterprise integration with beauty by delivering more clinical solutions and services in the category and putting more focus on naturals and healthy skin solutions.\"\n\nThe retailer is also working to diversify its offerings and store environments to meet the preferences and needs of different customer bases. After acquiring Miami-based Navarro Discount Pharmacy last summer, the company this June launched CVS/ pharmacy y mas, a new concept implemented in 12 stores in the Miami market.\n\nOne thing is clear as Foulkes leads CVS/pharmacy into the future: This is a chain that will strive to keep its edge and stay relevant to all its customers.\n\nMichelle Gloeckler, Executive VP, Consumables, Health & Wellness--Walmart U.S.\n\nBENTONVILLE, Ark. -- Since she joined Walmart in 2009, Michelle Gloeckler has steadily ascended the retailer's executive ranks. She now leads two of Walmart's most critical product segments as well as overseeing the company's domestic sourcing initiative. If that were not enough, she was also selected this year by Walmart president and chief executive officer Doug McMillon to lead the President's Global Council of Women Leaders.\n\nBefore joining Walmart, Gloeckler served 21 years at Hershey Co. Her first role at Walmart as vice president of candy, seasonal food, gifts and impulse items represented a natural transition path. She subsequently was promoted to senior vice president of merchandising execution. After that, Gloeckler was appointed senior vice president of the home division, with oversight of buying, branding, product development and cross-function collaboration. Home had long been a problematic business for Walmart, and under Gloeckler's leadership the division began a significant and sustained turnaround.\n\nIn 2013 Walmart unveiled a program to help revive manufacturing in the United States, and Gloeckler was chosen to lead that initiative. Last month Walmart held its third annual U.S. Manufacturing Summit. In her welcoming remarks, Gloeckler acknowledged that the initiative met some skepticism when it was first announced. \"The evidence speaks for itself: Our initiative is real,\" she said. \"In two and a half years we've made a lot of progress, but there is still much work to do. We face challenges in certain categories of merchandise that are more difficult to source here.\"\n\nGloeckler's portfolio has expanded to encompass much of what is sold in a typical Walmart U.S. outlet, including beauty and personal care, pet care, household paper and chemical products, baby care, over-the-counter remedies, pharmacy, and optical. In a recent interview, she noted that she and her team are examining how Walmart can grow its already significant role in the U.S. health care industry.\n\n\"We want to be the destination for health and wellness in the U.S.,\" she remarked. \"We are not only doing a lot of work to better understand our pharmacy customers, but also making sure we're staying one step ahead of their needs.\"\n\nAlex Gourlay, President, Walgreens, and Exec. VP--Walgreens Boots Alliance\n\nDEERFIELD, Ill. -- Alex Gourlay is on a mission to return Walgreens to the position of America's most loved drug store chain. And while progress has been made since he was named president of the chain in January, he acknowledges that much remains to be done.\n\nGourlay is well equipped to lead this effort precisely because he is a recent addition to the Walgreens leadership team, having spent 37 years at the Boots drug chain in the United Kingdom before being named president of customer experience and daily living in October 2014. While he clearly values Walgreens' heritage of customer service, he has been able to objectively examine and identify the areas that must be improved.\n\n\"The reality is we are no longer No. 1 in pharmacy volume, and no one here is OK with that,\" he told analysts in April.\n\nIn order to reclaim that position, he continued, he and the rest of the leadership team took a hard look at Walgreens' business to understand its strengths and weaknesses and identify the best way to move forward. The result is a strategy dubbed the One Plan, which he says begins and ends with the customer.\n\nAt the heart of the strategy is what Gourlay calls an \"integrated, back-to-basics approach in our pharmacy and front of store that delivers ultimate convenience, customer loyalty and extraordinary customer care,\" supported by a sustainable cost model.\n\nGourlay acknowledged that Walgreens had drifted from some of the core fundamentals that had made the chain successful for so long. As a result, product assortments are being evaluated and revised to meet regional needs, and pricing optimized to improve the chain's competitive position. The stores themselves are receiving more attention in the form of improved layouts and assortments that include updated offerings of health, wellness, beauty and gift items.\n\n\"We have a lot of work to do and a lot of opportunity ahead of us,\" he told analysts during the company's third quarter conference call last month. \"But the basic things we're doing are reducing unprofitable promotions and making sure that we focus more investment in our best customers and more investments in our destination categories.\"\n\nOlaf Koch, CEO--Metro\n\nDUSSELDORF, Germany -- When Olaf Koch took on the role of chief executive officer of Metro AG at the beginning of 2012, Germany's largest retailer was in dire straits. Three years later, after strategically jettisoning underperforming or low-growth businesses, the company is ready to resume a growth track.\n\n\"We are in the middle of a huge transformation that is still ongoing,\" Koch said last month. \"We are therefore aware that we have not finished yet, but after three years of heading in the right direction, we have reached the point where we can emphasize, intensify and possibly even speed up.\"\n\nKoch acknowledged the severity of the challenges faced in 2012. \"We were in a deep crisis in 2012, and the company has struggled to find a new strategic path,\" he said. \"We found that new strategy three years ago and have changed a lot since then.\"\n\nIn June Metro Group agreed to sell its Galeria Kaufhof department store chain to Canadian retailer Hudson's Bay Co. in a transaction valued at 2.83 billion euros ($3.14 billion). According to the company, the sale will generate cash totaling around 1.6 billion euros and reduce its net debt by about 2.7 billion euros.\n\nKoch pointed out that Metro has transformed its leadership and organizational structure and the business models of the chains it still operates.\n\n\"We have completely overhauled how our chains work,\" he explained. \"We had a 'push' model for decades: We pushed products into the market, towards the consumer. Nowadays, it is the other way around: Our consumers are our 'asset,' and their loyalty is what it is about. That is why we have to relate to them and engage them, which is why everything--and I do mean everything--has to create customer value.\"\n\nSeveral of the company's chains are developing omnichannel strategies, and Metro Group is again looking at investing in acquisitions, with a focus on smaller buys of innovative start-ups and access to new markets.\n\n\"There is a huge difference between the position we are in now and where we could be in five to 10 years' time,\" he said. \"We will spend more time in the next few years preparing acquisitions than we will selling off business units.\"\n\nHoward Levine, CEO--Family Dollar\n\nMATTHEWS, N.C. -- For Howard Levine, 2015 will very likely be remembered as a bittersweet year. With the sale of Family Dollar Stores Inc. to Dollar Tree Inc. completed last month, the chain he has led for the last 17 years is now part of another company.\n\nThe sale brought to a conclusion a tumultuous two years during which Family Dollar's operational and financial performance continued to decline while powerful investors exerted increasing pressure on Levine to sell the company. After several years of strong results, same-store sales had suddenly flattened at the end of fiscal 2013, and efforts to reignite growth with price cuts depleted profits and failed to revive sales.\n\nAs detailed in a Fortune magazine article to which Levine contributed, the deal with Dollar Tree was not, in fact, Family Dollar's first choice and was threatened by a tardy and ultimately unsuccessful bidding war launched by Dollar General Corp.\n\nAlthough Dollar General outbid Dollar Tree, Levine and the Family Dollar board supported the Dollar Tree offer as the best deal that was likely to win regulators' approval, and in the end they were proven correct. Because of the similarity of offerings and strategy between Family Dollar and Dollar General, Levine and the board repeatedly warned that a sale to Dollar General would probably result in the Federal Trade Commission demanding far more store divestitures than Dollar General's leadership would acknowledge.\n\nLevine's stand was vindicated when the FTC informed both Family Dollar and Dollar General that they would have to divest between 3,500 and 4,000 stores to win approval for a merger. Since Family Dollar's store count totals around 8,000 stores, the divestitures would have gutted any combination.\n\nSo now Dollar Tree, for the time being, is the largest extreme-value small-box retailer in the country, with annual sales of around $19 billion and more than 13,600 stores in the United States and Canada.\n\nGary Philbin, who was president and chief operating officer of Dollar Tree, has assumed those titles as the head of Family Dollar, while Levine, who retains the title of chief executive officer of Family Dollar, has been appointed to the Dollar Tree board of directors.\n\nJohn Mackey, Co-CEO--Whole Foods Market\n\nAUSTIN, Texas -- After a challenging 2014, Whole Foods Market Inc. is forging ahead undaunted, with aggressive expansion plans and a new format in the works. Cofounder and co-chief executive officer John Mackey is confident that the retailer is well positioned to continue its astounding success story.\n\nThe disappointments of last year were in part results of the chain's very success. Rapid growth produced cannibalization of same-store sales in key markets such as Texas and Florida. And Whole Foods' success has validated its premise that more Americans want to eat high-quality food and are willing to pay for it, resulting in intensified competition from such mainstream grocers as Kroger Co.\n\nBut Mackey's vision is undeterred: The company has 120 signed leases that will result in 40 new stores a year for the next three years. And he and his fellow executives still see room for 1,200 or more Whole Foods Markets eventually.\n\nMoreover, in response to the competitive challenge that impacted the chain last year, the company will debut a new format, 365 by Whole Foods Market, next year. \"Offering our industry-leading standards at value prices, this new format will feature a modern, streamlined design, innovative technology and a curated selection,\" Mackey said during the grocer's second quarter conference call in May. \"It will offer a convenient, transparent and values-oriented experience geared toward Millennial shoppers, while appealing to anyone looking for high-quality, fresh food at great prices.\"\n\nThe new format is viewed as a key to unlock further growth.\n\n\"We want to underscore that we see this as an 'and' to our Whole Foods Market brand, and not an 'or,'\" he stressed. \"We believe the growth potential for this new and complementary brand to be as great as it is for our highly successful Whole Foods Market brand.\"\n\nMackey and Whole Foods Market have won recognition from numerous sources over the years. The company has been on Fortune magazine's list of \"100 Best Companies to Work For\" for 18 consecutive years. Mackey, meanwhile, was named \"World's Best CEO\" by Barron's magazine and \"Most Inspiring CEO\" by Esquire, among other awards.\n\nKen Martindale, CEO--rite aid stores\n\nCAMP HILL, Pa. -- Soon after John Standley returned to Rite Aid Corp. in 2008 following a stint as chief executive officer of Pathmark Stores Inc., he called on an executive who had served with him at the supermarket chain: Ken Martindale. In the years since, Martindale has proved his worth in helping lead the retailer back from a stalled turnaround to renewed growth.\n\nAt Pathmark, Martindale last served as copresident and chief merchandising and marketing officer, and when he joined Rite Aid in December 2008, he was named senior executive vice president of merchandising, marketing and logistics. In 2010 he was promoted to senior executive vice president and chief operating officer, followed by his elevation to president and COO in June 2013.\n\nHis most recent advancement, which took place earlier this "
