Terms used but not defined in this Amendment No. 17 have the respective meanings given to such terms in the original Schedule 13D, as previously amended.\n\nItem 2. Identity and Background.\n\nItem 2 is amended and supplemented as follows:\n\nThis Amendment No. 17 is being filed by: (i) Walgreens Boots Alliance Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“WBA Holdings”) (f/k/a WAB Holdings LLC); (ii) WBA Investments, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“WBA Investments”); and (iii) Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“WBA”). WBA Holdings, WBA Investments and WBA are collectively referred to as the “Reporting Persons.”\n\nWBA Holdings was formed solely for the purpose of investing in the Issuer. All of the shares of Common Stock reported as beneficially owned by any Reporting Person in this Schedule 13D are held by WBA Holdings. WBA Holdings is a wholly owned subsidiary of WBA Investments. WBA Investments is a wholly owned subsidiary of WBA. WBA, together with its subsidiaries, including the Reporting Persons, is a global pharmacy-led, health and wellbeing enterprise.\n\nThe principal business office of each of the Reporting Persons is: c/o Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., 108 Wilmot Road, Deerfield, Illinois 60015.\n\nAttached as Annex A hereto and incorporated herein by reference is a list containing the (a) name, (b) residence or business address, (c) present principal occupation or employment and the name, principal business address of any corporation or other organization in which such employment is conducted, and (d) citizenship, in each case, of each director and executive officer of the Reporting Persons, as applicable.\n\nDuring the last five years, each Reporting Person and, to the knowledge of such Reporting Person, each person listed in Annex A with respect to such Reporting Person, has not been convicted in any criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) and has not been a party to a civil proceeding of any judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction as a result of which such person was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding of any violation with respect to such laws.\n\nItem 4. Purpose of Transaction.\n\nItem 4 is amended and supplemented as follows by adding the following:\n\nAugust 2024 Sale\n\nOn August 1, 2024, WBA Holdings sold 3,398,929 shares of the outstanding common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Issuer (the “Common Stock”) in an unregistered block trade pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “August 2024 Sale”), representing approximately 1.7% of the outstanding Common Stock after giving effect to the August 2024 Sale and concurrent share repurchase described below (as represented by the Issuer in its Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 5, 2024).\n\nIn addition, the Issuer and WBA Holdings concurrently entered into a share repurchase agreement (the “Share Repurchase Agreement”) whereby the Issuer repurchased directly from WBA Holdings 1,039,242 shares of the Common Stock at a price per share equal to the price for the August 2024 Sale (the “Concurrent Share Repurchase”).\n\nProceeds from the August 2024 Sale and the Concurrent Share Repurchase will be used by WBA primarily for debt paydown and general corporate purposes, as WBA continues to build out a more capital-efficient health services strategy rooted in its retail pharmacy footprint.\n\nFrom time to time, WBA undertakes a review of its strategic and capital allocation priorities. As part of this review, WBA may effect one or more further sales of Common Stock. Any such sales, which may be undertaken at any time without further notice, may take a number of forms, including registered public offerings effected pursuant to WBA’s registration rights under the A&R Shareholders Agreement (which offerings may be underwritten and/or marketed), unregistered or registered block trades, unregistered market or private sales, pledges, hedges, forward sales and other derivative transactions.\n\nDecisions to effect any such sales, as well as the size and timing thereof, are also subject to a number of factors outside of the control of WBA, including current and anticipated future trading prices of the shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Issuer, the financial condition, results of operations and prospects of the Issuer and general economic, financial market and industry conditions, other investment and/or business opportunities available to the Reporting Persons, strategic considerations in respect of the Reporting Persons, general stock market and economic conditions, tax considerations and other factors. WBA will periodically consider such sales opportunistically based on such factors and, as a result, the ultimate number of shares of Common Stock that may be sold by WBA, if any, is not ascertainable.\n\nAll existing commercial agreements between WBA and the Issuer (including the US pharmaceutical distribution agreement), as well as the A&R Shareholders Agreement, remain in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms.\n\nOrnella Barra remains a director of the Issuer. It is currently expected that Ms. Barra (or another designee of WBA) will remain a director of the Issuer unless and until the occurrence of a Walgreens Investor Rights Termination Event (as defined in the A&R Shareholders Agreement).\n\nThe foregoing summary of the Share Repurchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Share Repurchase Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.28 and is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nItem 5. Interest in Securities of the Issuer.\n\nItem 5 is amended and supplemented as follows:\n\n(a) and (b). The ownership percentages set forth below are based on the adjusted 196,007,584 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of August 5, 2024 (as reported by the Issuer on its Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 5, 2024). WBA Holdings may be deemed to beneficially own 19,980,000 shares of Common Stock, representing approximately 10.2% of the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding, as of the filing of this Amendment No. 17.\n\nBy virtue of relationships reported in Item 2, each of WBA Investments and WBA may be deemed to share the power to vote or direct to vote or to direct the voting of, and to dispose of or to direct the disposition of and, accordingly, may be deemed to beneficially own the 19,980,000 shares of Common Stock held by WBA Holdings, representing approximately 10.2% of the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding, as of the filing of this Amendment No. 17.\n\nNeither the filing of this Schedule 13D nor any of its contents shall be deemed to constitute an admission by any Reporting Person (other than WBA Holdings) that it is the beneficial owner of any shares of Common Stock for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, or for any other purpose, and such beneficial ownership is expressly disclaimed."
