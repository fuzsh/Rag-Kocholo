The Executive acknowledges that the Company may require her to permanently relocate to work at any head office or other place of business of the Company and/or any Group Company.

Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the duration and terms and conditions of any such scheme (including without limitation targets and related payments) shall be as the Company may from time to time in its absolute discretion expressly notify the Executive in writing. 8.2 The Company shall be entitled at any time to amend, modify, replace or terminate the Pension Scheme or the Executive’s membership thereof subject to providing the Executive with the benefit of an equivalent pension scheme (‘the New Scheme’) each and every benefit of which shall be no less favourable than the accrued benefits provided to the Executive under the Pension Scheme. The Company shall be entitled to amend or modify the Pension Scheme provided that the benefits provided under such amended or modified scheme are no less favourable than the accrued benefits provided before any such amendment or modification took effect. 9.2 The Company shall be entitled to vary or replace any such schemes referred to in clause 9.1 from time to time provided always that the benefits provided under any such varied or replacement scheme are in all material respects (in the Company’s reasonable opinion) at least as beneficial to the Executive as the schemes thereby varied or replaced. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if in the reasonable opinion of the Company (whose opinion shall be conclusive) the continuation of any of the benefits set out in this clause 9.2 is not reasonably practicable (including without limitation by reason of the cost thereof) the Company shall be entitled to terminate the provision of any such benefits. 11.1 The Company shall reimburse to the Executive on a monthly basis all travelling, hotel, entertainment and other expenses reasonably incurred by her in the proper performance of her duties subject to the Executive complying with such guidelines or regulations issued by the Company from time to time in this respect and to the production to the Company of such vouchers or other evidence of actual payment of such expenses as the Company may reasonably require.

On the termination of her employment for whatever reason, the Executive shall not be entitled to pay in lieu of outstanding holiday entitlement (save if her employment has been terminated by the Company in breach of the terms and/or conditions of her employment) and the Executive shall be required to repay to the Company any holiday pay received in excess of her actual entitlement. 13.1 If the Executive shall be prevented by illness (including mental disorder), injury or other incapacity from properly performing her duties hereunder she shall report this fact forthwith to the Deputy Chief Executive and if the Executive is so prevented for seven or more consecutive days she shall provide a medical practitioner’s statement on the eighth day and weekly thereafter so that the whole period of incapacity is certified by such statements, immediately following her return to work after a period of absence due to incapacity the Executive shall complete a self-certification form available from the Company Secretary’s office detailing the reason for her absence. 13.2 If the Executive shall be absent from her duties hereunder due to illness (including mental disorder), injury or other incapacity duly certified in accordance with the provisions of clause 13.1 hereof, she shall be paid her full remuneration hereunder for up to 180 working days’ absence in any period of 12 consecutive months and thereafter such remuneration, if any, as the Board shall from time to time determine provided that all such remuneration shall be inclusive of any Statutory Sick Pay to which the Executive is entitled or other benefits recoverable by the Executive (whether or not recovered) may be deducted therefrom. 13.4 At any time during the period of this employment the Executive shall at the request and expense of the Company permit herself to be examined by a registered medical practitioner (if in the Company’s reasonable opinion any such examination is necessary or appropriate), such medical practitioner to be selected by the Company. The Executive authorises such medical practitioner to disclose to and discuss with the Company’s medical adviser the results of such examination (“the Results”) and any matters which arise from it in order that the Company’s medical adviser can notify the Company of any matters which, in her opinion, might hinder or prevent the Executive (if during a period of incapacity) from returning to work for any period or (in other circumstances) from properly performing any duties of her appointment at any time. Subject to the provisions of law or professional conduct prohibiting disclosures of the Results to the Executive, the Executive shall be entitled to be informed of the Results. 15.1.4 The Executive irrevocably appoints the Company to be her attorney in her name and on her behalf to execute documents and/or deeds to use the Executive’s name and to do all things which may be necessary or desirable for the Company to obtain for itself or its nominee the full benefit of the provisions of clauses 15.1.2 and 15,2,2 and a certificate in writing signed by the Chief Executive that any instrument or act fails within the authority hereby conferred shall be conclusive evidence that such is the case so far as any third party is concerned. 15.2.2 The Executive hereby assigns to the Company by way of future assignment all copyright, design right and other proprietary rights (If any) for the full terms thereof throughout the world in respect of all copyright works and designs originated, conceived, written or made by the Executive (except only those works originated, conceived, written or made by the Executive wholly outside her normal working hours which are wholly unconnected with her appointment) during the period of her appointment with the Company, 15.3.1 The Executive shall comply, where relevant, with every rule of law, every requirement of the London Stock Exchange and every regulation of the Company from time to time in force in relation to dealings in the shares, debentures or other securities of the Company or any Group Company and unpublished price sensitive information affecting the shares, debentures or other securities of the Company and any Group Company or any other company and, in relation to overseas dealings, the Executive shall also comply with all laws of the state and all regulations of the stock exchange, market or dealing system in which such dealings take place. 15.3.2 The Executive shall not (and shall procure so far as she is able that her spouse and children shall not) deal or become or cease to be interested (within the meaning of Part I of Schedule 7 to the Companies Act 1985) in any securities of the Company or any Group Company except in accordance with any Company rules or guidelines from time to time relating to securities transactions by directors. 15.4.1.4 not directly or indirectly receive or obtain in respect of any goods or services sold or purchased or other business transacted (whether or not by her) by or on behalf of the Company or any Group Company any discount, rebate, commission or other inducement (whether in cash or in kind) which is not authorised by any Company rules or guidelines from time to time and if she or any person firm or company in which she holds any Material Interest shell obtain any such discount, rebate, commission or inducement, she shall immediately account to the Company for the discount rebate commission or other inducement so received;

and 15.6.1 The Executive shall not during her employment (save in a purely social capacity or with the prior express written consent of the Chief Executive) make any contact, whether formal or informal, written or oral, with any of the Company or Group Company’s past, current or prospective suppliers of goods for resale, customers or clients for any purpose (including but not limited to an intention to set up a competing business or to seek employment) other than for the legitimate business interests of the Company or Group Company, 16.8.1 In the event that either party gives notice to terminate the appointment of the Executive then for a period not exceeding 12 months (or 6 months in the case of a notice served by the Executive in accordance with clause 2.2) the Company shall be under no obligation to vest in or assign to the Executive any powers or duties or to provide any work for the Executive and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing the Company may in its absolute discretion require the Executive to perform only such duties as it may allocate to her (including without limitation research projects or any other work whether or not directly related to the Executive’s duties) or not to perform any of her duties under this Agreement or to work in such other capacities as the Company may require (commensurate with the Executive’s status) and/or to exclude her from any premises of the Company or of any Group Company (without providing any reason therefor) provided always that throughout any such period the Executive’s salary (and other contractual remuneration, if any) under clause 6 and other contractual benefits shall not cease to be paid or provided (unless and until her employment shall be terminated). 16.8.3 If the Executive fails to make herself available for work during any period of notice of termination of the Executive’s employment, other than at the request of the Company pursuant to clause 16.8.1 or with the express permission in writing of the Chief Executive, the Company reserves the right to deduct one day’s salary (and any amount payable under any discretionary performance related remuneration scheme pursuant to clause 6.3) for each day of each such absence. 16.8.4 If and insofar as the Company exercises its rights under clause 16.8.1 so as to exclude the Executive from the premises of the Company during the notice period, then the Executive may carry out other activities (for persons other than the Company or any other Group Company) subject to obtaining the previous express written consent of the Chief Executive which consent may be given subject to such terms and conditions as he may determine (each of which shall be deemed a condition of this Agreement) and such consent, if given, may be revoked at any time.

It is nevertheless agreed that if any of those restrictions shall taken together or separately be held to be void or ineffective for any reason but would be held to be valid and effective if part of the wording were deleted, that restriction shall apply with such deletions as may be necessary to make it valid and effective. 17.6 The Executive has given the undertakings contained in clauses 17.1, 17.3 and 15 to the Company for itself and as trustee for each Group Company and the Executive will at the request and cost of the Company enter into direct undertakings with any Group Company which correspond to the undertakings in clauses 17.1, 17.3 and 15, or which are less onerous only to the extent necessary (in the opinion of the Company or its legal advisors) to ensure that such undertakings are valid and enforceable."
