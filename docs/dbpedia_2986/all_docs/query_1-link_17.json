        "text": "The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and Walgreens Boots Alliance are delighted to announce the next phase of their partnership in support of the organisation’s E²-RADIatE platform, the only radiation oncology platform in Europe.\n\nThe partnership\n\nOver the past decade, WBA has supported EORTC in building and developing the SPECTA platform into the leading pan-European translational research infrastructure.\n\nDuring the next three years, WBA aims to raise €1.8 million in support of the E²-RADIatE platform, aimed at defining optimal radiation oncology treatment strategies and interventions that can become the new standard of care for patients through the performance of clinical trials.\n\nEORTC CEO, Dr. Denis Lacombe, commented, “Understanding the optimal use of new technologies for cancer patients is paramount to therapeutic progress. E²-RADIatE is the sole platform in Europe embracing the developing field of radiation oncology to deliver evidence for the best use of novel therapeutic options. We could not be prouder to count WBA as our partner.”\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance Chief Operating Officer – International, Ornella Barra, commented: “Everyone at WBA is proud to continue to support the essential work of the EORTC, including this ground-breaking technology. E²-RADIatE is a platform that collects evidence to address health equity and could reduce health disparities in cancer care. This reflects WBA’s commitment to improving health equity as well as our mission to promote ‘More joyful lives through better health.”\n\nThe programme\n\nRadiotherapy is one of the mainstays of cancer treatment. Approximately 1 in 2 of all cancer patients need radiotherapy at least once in the course of their disease. Most of the time radiotherapy is given at an early stage of the disease, conveying the potential for cure. Improved technologies and their proper use are therefore critical factors in increasing the cure rate and decreasing the probability of radiation-induced toxicity.\n\nThe E²-RADIatE platform (a joint scientific collaboration between the EORTC and the European Society of Radiation Oncology, ESTRO) will streamline the efficient collection and linking of clinical information with diagnostic imaging data, radiation imaging, and treatment data as well as with health economic data. The platform will also collect patient-reported outcomes to address the increased emphasis on patient-centered care and the role of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in evaluating new treatments.\n\nThe E²-RADIatE platform and downstream clinical research projects aim to make it easier to appropriately document new clinical indications treated with radiotherapy and to monitor the impact of new radiation treatments, techniques, and technologies, while new standards of care are developing in parallel.\n\nE²-RADIatE will provide Europe with the means to maintain the capacity of excellence in high-level, science-driven knowledge development, in the best interest of patients. The platform combines the expertise of a knowledgeable network of specialists and the expertise of solid clinical research infrastructure, embedding the highest level of quality assurance in delivering radiation therapy.\n\nAbout WBA\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance (Nasdaq: WBA) is an integrated healthcare, pharmacy, and retail leader serving millions of customers and patients every day, with a 170-year heritage of caring for communities.\n\nA trusted, global innovator in retail pharmacy with approximately 13,000 locations across the U.S., Europe, and Latin America, WBA plays a critical role in the healthcare ecosystem.
