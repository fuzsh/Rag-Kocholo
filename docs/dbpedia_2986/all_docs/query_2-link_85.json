        "text": "Israel’s rape of Gaza’s Natural Resources (Final Part)\n\nWhat the conflict was really about\n\nAs you would aspect it’s all about oil and gas…..just like all the other conflicts in the Balkans, Kuwait, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya etc !!\n\nJust ask the executives of Noble Energy – A joint venture between the Zionists of the US and Israel…..they have become experts at ripping off someone else’s oil and gas……especially when it comes to Gaza and the people of Palestine.\n\nThe Eastern part of the Mediterranean is prolific in natural gas with a very good change of oil being found much deeper. In many parts of the world we find sufficient reserves for everyone to share and benefit from. For some strange reason Israel does not agree with this principle and in actual fact wishes to take not only its own reserves but also those belonging to the Palestinians.\n\nWe will first look again at the offshore natural resources and see how Israel could or already have the ability to deprive Palestine of its own vital resource. Later in this article we will also look at the onshore possibilities in the West Bank and show that some of the areas taken by and under the control of Israel could well yield some interesting finds.\n\nAs I have previously pointed out Israel’s Mari B natural gas field sits on the border with Gaza and in surrounded by a cloak of secrecy. The area around the platform is totally off limits as one would normally expect but is there more to this gas field and could it extend into Gazan waters? Should this be the case then a grave injustice has taken place which basically is depriving the Palestinians of a shared resource and all the incredible wealth that goes with it.\n\nThe Mari B platform came on line in December 2003 and delivered around 100 million cubic feet per day (MMcfpd). Later in 2004 this increased to reach around 170 MMcfpd. The production facilities for the Mari B were expected to produce up to 600 MMcfpd. The company estimates total recoverable reserves in the Mari-B field to exceed one trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Noble Energy also has an undeveloped discovery, Noa, which is estimated to contain over 200 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas. Noa is scheduled to be brought on line at a later date through a sub-sea tieback to the Mari-B platform.\n\nLet’s look again at this issue and ask the question does the Mari B gas field extend over the border and if so then Israel is guilty of stealing a shared resource. Noa natural gas field (which sits further out to the West of Mari B) is expected to be commissioned in the near future. This field in actual fact is two fields consisting of Noa and the Noa South. My concern is the fact that they certainly do extend into the Gaza Marine Area and therefore are a shared resource. Finally we have Gaza’s own legal reserves in Marine 1 and Marine 2 all of which are totally in their own territory.\n\nI have drawn up my own map of the current situation (above) which shows that the US Company Noble Energy and its Joint Venture Partners in Israel (Mari B and Noa gas fields) are clearly taking Palestinian Gas all under the watchful eye of the United Nations and the world…….we have another word in England for such an act – “Thieving Bastards”\n\nAgain I ask the question do the Palestinian know this and if so what is being done to investigate and stop this exploitation by the Israeli Government? It is absolutely disgraceful that the world just watches and says nothing whilst the people in Gaza live in absolute poverty. Where is the United Nations and where is our conscience?\n\nIt is also important to note that the Oslo Accord (with manipulation by Israel) shows a buffer zone on both side of this area thus reducing the Gaza Marine Area and depriving them of their own legal territorial rights. The Israel gas platform (Mari B) actually sits barely one nautical mile from this border which again may indicate that something sinister is going on here. Gas platforms normally sit well inside the limits of their respective reserves which would again indicate that this field does extend beyond the Israeli border.\n\nLet’s now take a look at the onshore oil and gas scene. In one of my earlier articles I talked about an onshore oil field that sits very close to the north-eastern corner of Gaza. This reserve is called the Heletz Field and has been producing crude oil over many years. Some wells were drilled within the Gaza Strip and have been abandoned for some considerable time; one can only assume that one day we will see a return to exploration in this area. I would assume that with the offshore reserves in the Gaza Marine Area and the crude oil sitting close to Gaza onshore that this area could bring is some exciting finds. It is also interesting to note that such productive areas as Heletz once belonged to the Palestinians.\n\nHaving worked in the oil and gas industry for many years it is clear to me that many oil companies use a technique known as slant drilling or diagonal drilling to take the natural resources from someone else’s territory and Noble Energy certainly have a very shady past.\n\nThis image clearly shows how oil companies can drill under borders and take the natural resources of another country without that country even knowing………this has happened in many locations around the world and the outbreak of the Iraq War was no exception when oil rigs positioned on the Kuwait-Iraqi border started taking the resources of Iraq from the Kuwaiti side – hence one of the reasons for Iraq going into Kuwait………..ask that mongrel George W Bush how it is done because his family are experts at cheating the system!!!\n\n“Hey George are you by any chance taking my oil from under the border” ? – “No Sir – we in Texas do not do such things”\n\nThe Israeli’s are experts at taking anything that does not belong to them as we can see from above map showing just how much Palestinian Territory is actually controlled by Israel and that US Stooge Abbas is a traitor to his own people and is currently illegally running the country since his term of office expired some years ago.\n\nOver in Gaza we can see a clear indication that gas and oil does exist. The main areas of interest has been declared as Israeli Military Restricted Areas and therefore are off limits to Palestinians. It is ironic that the West Bank is zoned as Palestinian territory and yet barely a third of it is available for their usage. Historically tar frequently popped up in the Dead Sea giving a clear indication that the underground geology had something to offer.\n\nIn more recent times oil has been found on the western shores of the Dead Sea which is controlled by the Israelis. The reserves were found in the Northern, Middle and Southern shores which clearly puts them in Palestinian – West Bank Territory. Because of the nature of the geology in the region I would say that oil/gas would also exist along the rift valley separating West Bank from Jordan. Exploration activity is also taking place on the other side of the border in Jordan.\n\nSo what lies ahead for the Palestinians? Will they ever see justice and have the opportunity to explore and recover their own natural resources? I have to say that Israel can do exactly what it wants, when it wants and the United Nations continues to be non effective. The United States likewise sits on the fence and says nothing and for a very good reason…..most of the oil/gas exploration programmes are Joint Ventures with US companies and such interference would be counter productive.\n\nIsraeli washing his hands in Dead Sea Oil\n\nOne must also remember that the Dead Sea area brings other natural resources that Israel has been commercialising for many years. The region has been a worldwide producer of fertilizers, some of which are based on minerals extracted from the Dead Sea. The evaporating Dead Sea waters leave behind them a unique array of chloride salts magnesium, sodium, potassium, calcium and bromine etc. The other unique aspect in such an environment is that of Health Care and Body Products. As we have already discussed the Palestinians are totally deprived of their own resource and the commercialisation of its resources are stolen by Israeli companies.\n\nMaybe you do not believe me – well folks just visit any Zionist run major shopping centre around the world – they are called “Westfield” – we have many here in Australia (the home base of the company) – this empire is run by Frank Lowy, AC – an Australian — Israeli businessman.\n\nThe Westfield Group has interests in and operates one of the world’s largest shopping centre portfolios. The global portfolio has 105 high quality regional shopping centres in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, the United Kingdom and Brazil valued in excess of $62.9 billion, with approximately 22,964 retailers in 9.6 million square metres of retail space.\n\nSoap & Co UK\n\nTake a stroll around any Westfield Shopping Centre and look out for a small store selling soap and other skin products…..in the UK one such store/kiosk is called Soap & Co and always employs young Zionist staff all of whom intercept its potential clients as they walk past in a very insistent way…….in the UK I have studied such stores and many times observed the staff talking to many Islamic women, holding their hands and charming them with their hand creams or face creams etc……….if only these women knew!!!……..around Christmas time many other small kiosks suddenly emerge which are all staffed by young Zionist……..I can clearly remember one Palestinian male challenging the staff that these products belong to Palestinians……one of the Soap & Co staff really lost his mind and starting yelling at the Palestinian as hating his homeland and existence and denying the holocaust etc…..as you would expect the holocaust always manages to become the main theme in their defence and yet no ones says anything about the genocide that Israel itself has carried out via its secret service Mossad (9/11) and the use of depleted uranium weapons in both Lebanon and Gaza which has also nuked the citizens of its own country – Israel!!!\n\nDead Sea Salts\n\nThis brief below was recovered from an activist webpage and clearly explains what they feel about Westfield’s and these cosmetic company that are in all of their centres……especially in Australia and New Zealand:\n\nIf you visit a shopping centre, chances are that you’ll eventually come across a kiosk selling Dead Sea beauty products. These kiosks have attracted a lot of attention, not just for the origin of their natural resources, but also for their shady practices and coercive sales techniques that would make a snake oil salesman blush.\n\nStop for just a few seconds to check the label and you’ll be approached by a young Israeli of the opposite sex, dressed in black and pawing at your hands to entice you to purchase an overpriced container of lotion. If you think they’re just being friendly, think again. Most of them work from scripts like this:\n\nNAIL KIT SALE SPEECH\n\nSPEECH\n\nSTEP\n\nExcuse me mam, may I ask you a question?\n\nShow me your hands please.\n\nI want to show you something amazing.\n\nCome with me.\n\nAPPROACHING\n\nMam, You see those lines on your nails – those lines called ridges, and it’s the main reason why nails splits and breaks.\n\nNow, I’m going to show you a natural way to prevent it.\n\nChallenge me with you worst nail.\n\nThis is the professional buffer.

It removes all dry and dead skin, opens the pores and allows the dirt and toxic to come out. At the same time it is also enriching you skin with\n\nthe 27 unique minerals you can find in the dead sea.\n\n(at this point you wash the costumers hand)\n\nYou have to do this only once a week from the neck down, you should give extra time for the elbows, knees and heels.\n\n(give the costumer a paper towel to wipe the hands)\n\nThis is a very good treatment for a lot of skin problems such as exsema, psoriasis, acne, fungus, stretch marks (for the ladies) and also dry skin from bad weather.\n\nHow does it feel?\n\nThe presentation of the body butter\n\nNow to close the pores you can use any lotion toy have in the house but I recommend this body butter.\n\nIt is very rich and thick but because it is based on the same 27 minerals you have in the salt and not based on water and oil, it will not feel sticky and greasy like other body butters. It will absorbed very quickly into the skin and make it soft and smooth. (Like the babies bum…)\n\nNow when the last time was your hand were so soft?

Don’t forget to save the receipt; it will give you 10 percent discount for all our products the next time you come. Have a nice day.\n\nKiosks stocking Dead Sea beauty products can be found in many malls run by Israeli companies who employ almost exclusively Israelis.\n\nThese kiosks are legitimate targets, as every sale supports companies who in turn support the apparatus of oppression in the racist apartheid state. Dead Sea Premier kiosks were targeted in April and July 2011 at malls in Auckland, New Zealand and in June and November, Seacrest kiosks in Brisbane and Perth Australia were also targeted.\n\nSo there you have it folks and when one looks at the tourism potential available to the Palestinians we can see that if the international community stood firm and insisted that West Bank be returned to the people of Palestine we could well see a dramatic change in the prosperity of West Bank and Gaza. Only when each and every Israeli has left the region will stability return.\n\nAs I have said so many times before if the people of Gaza and West Bank were allowed to recover their own natural resources Palestine could become the Dubai of the Eastern Mediterranean within a very short period of time – with one exception – they have been nuked by the Israeli’s who have now basically killed the genetic code of all Palestinians by attacking their DNA with depleted uranium weapons and other illegal WMD’s and “Dirty Bombs”.\n\nThe progressive mass genocide of the Palestinians using depleted uranium weapons on a daily basis\n\nHow the US, UK, France, Germany, Israel , NATO and the United Nations are secretly carrying out mass depopulation (of not only many Islamic Nations) but also the world in general via its Agenda 21 policy and its mass vacination programmes……….now that is what I call a real holocaust!!!\n\nPeter Eyre – Middle East Consultant – 22/11/2012\n\nIsrael’s rape of Gaza’s Natural Resources\n\nWhat the conflict is really about\n\nIsrael is openly taking Palestinian gas from the Gaza offshore marine area\n\nBack in 2000 Gas was discovered close to shore off Gaza. The vast majority of this vital resource lies within the Gaza Marine Area. Israel from the onset decided it wanted the entire field for its own purposes having decided to changeover to Natural Gas as the main fuel for its power stations and industry. Two plans were originally drawn up.\n\nTake the gas by sub-sea pipeline to El Arish (Egypt) and then by sub-sea pipeline to Ashkelon (making it look like Egyptian Gas)\n\nTake the Gas directly to Ashekelon.\n\nIn December 2007, BG Group withdrew from negotiations with the Government of Israel for the sale of gas from the Gaza Marine field to Israel. In January 2008, BG Group closed its office in Israel and continued to evaluate options for commercialising the gas. In my own opinion I found the share ratio between all parties very unbalanced with Palestine only retaining 10%.\n\nBy mid 2008 BG had signed up with Egypt to pipe the entire supply to Egypt and then convert it to LNG for onward shipment to the US or EU. This was a potential disaster for Israel as they needed the gas desperately to fulfil their supply requirements having decided to convert to natural gas.\n\nThe other problem was that the Gaza Strip had, during these discussions, come under the control of Hamas and added even more complications to a possible deal. By June 2008 Israel was now on a war footing with Gaza with a clear intention of removing Hamas from the strip in order to try and get something salvaged from the failed deal. It was during this time that the ex British Minister, Tony Blair became involved and tried to get BG and Israel to come back to the table and open up negotiations. BG responded and again returned to Israel for urgent talks and scrapped the deal with Egypt.\n\nThe Israeli Government then decided that the attack of Gaza would now have to be put back on hold as any activity could jeopardise talks between BG, Israel and the PA. Unfortunately yet again the talks failed and BG continued looking into other possibilities. By the end of the year Israel had made up its mind to go into Gaza and remove Hamas and in doing so would be in a good position to get their hands on these vast offshore reserves.\n\nThe Ex IDF Chief stated “We have to remove Hamas in order to drill for oil and gas”\n\nNow that’s what I call true Israeli style democracy!!!\n\nThe attempted take over of the Gaza Strip failed as a direct result of the fortitude and spirit of Hamas and worldwide condemnation. We now have a situation whereby the people of Gaza/Palestine have this incredible offshore wealth but are unable to bring it ashore.\n\nWe read about all the financial aid that was promised by so many governments but where is this aid and do they really need it? The answer is simply no as they have all the wealth in the world in their offshore natural gas reserves.\n\nGaza does need urgent short term help in medical supplies and basic infrastructure support to get it up and running again. It needs significant help with its health infrastructure to cope with the ongoing sickness as a direct result of the Israelis bombardment and their use of weapons containing uranium components. There will now be a progressive rise in cancers, diabetes and birth complications which will put great pressure on their health system. Gaza also needs good quality water and basic food supplies and most of all it needs assistance to update and maintain its sewerage system which has totally collapsed.\n\nDoesn’t it appear strange that raw sewerage now has to be dumped into the sea as a direct result of Israelis blockade? Would anyone in Israel imagine that to swim off their beautiful beaches is now a severe health risk? Can they even imagine the volume of sewerage from 1.5 million people…I think last year alone it somewhere in the region of 16 billion litres. This year the system is in total collapse and therefore the sea is the only answer. The tidal currents will take all the pollution North along Israel’s beautiful coastline. As they say what goes around comes around!\n\nNow that we all fully understand what lies behind the Israeli – Gaza conflict we should be asking the question where are the United Nations and what are they doing about this? They were very quick to respond to Israel’s disproportionate attack on Gaza. They were very quick to place a war crimes team into Gaza but what about the long running issue of the exploitation of Gaza/Palestine natural resources and these so called disputed borders that they have known about for many years? Let’s just refresh their memories!\n\nThe EU and the UN Security Council have a prominent role to play in law enforcement and regulation in the region. Israel should be condemned internationally for its grave violations of international law regarding the exploitation of the Occupied Territory’s natural resources. The country’s blatant disregard for the pronounced international regulations has done nothing but increase Palestine’s dependency on Israeli oil supplies. Israel is also in violation of the Oslo Accord which it manipulated to its own advantage.\n\nResolution 1803 (XVII) 18 December 1962 declares the right of peoples/nations to permanent sovereignty over their natural wealth/resources,\n\nUN resolution 3005 (XXVII) 15 December 1972 affirmed the principle of sovereignty of the population of occupied territories over their natural wealth and resources and called upon all States, international organizations and specialized agencies not to recognize or co-operate with, or assist in any manner in, any measures undertaken by the occupying Power to exploit the resources of the occupied territories or to effect any changes in the demographic composition or geographic character or institutional structure of those territories\n\nAffirms the right of the Arab States and peoples whose territories are under foreign occupation to permanent sovereignty over all their natural resources,\n\nReaffirms that all measures undertaken by Israel to exploit the human and natural resources of the occupied Arab territories are illegal and calls upon Israel to halt such measures forthwith;\n\nAffirms the right of the Arab States and peoples whose territories are under Israeli occupation to the restitution of and full compensation for the exploitation and looting of, and damages to, the natural resources\n\nResolution No. 3175 (XXVIII) 17 December 1973\n\nAffirming the Right of the Arabs to Permanent Sovereignty over National Resources in the Occupied Arab Territories\n\nThe above map shows UN International Maritime Borders but doesn’t give any reference to Gaza/Palestinian Waters\n\nIt is ironic however that the UN does acknowledge that a disputed international border exists (as the map below shows) so why doesn’t the UN do something about all the above violations or address this so called disputed international border?\n\nThe UN forms part of the New World Order so what chance do Palestinians have in the recovery of their own natural resources and for their future prosperity? Decades of false promises has left this enclave with no future!!\n\nIt is obvious that despite the UN condemnation of such issues it has no real strength in its ability to perform its duty. One would hope that the UN does not follow in the footsteps of its predecessor The League of Nations which failed dismally.\n\nIn the map below several natural gas fields sit within or stagger the Gaza/Israel disputed border which I have redrawn in white which is the 12 + 12 limits (that should apply to Gaza) and the extended red area which would be their EEZ. The area is prolific in Gas and I also believe that crude oil lies deeper under these fields. The map is not to scale but gives some idea of the proximity of the resources. As you can see considerably more offshore territory is available if it could rightfully claim its own EEZ (which is applicable to any other country).\n\nMy map showing not only the legal limits (White) but also the extended legal EEZ (Red)\n\nThe areas in yellow are the current vast gas fields which Israel is taking under the watchful eye of the UN!!\n\nNow you can see what all the fuss is about. How can we, as an international community or how can the UN just sit on our hands and allow Israel to rape the natural resources of Gaza/Palestine. It is obvious that one of the above fields is Gazan owned and sits totally in the middle of their zone (Gaza Marine 1 & 2). The one to the North (staggering the border) is jointly owned even though Israel claim it as their own (Noa & Noa South) and then we have the production platform called Mari B that may also be jointly owned sitting right on the border. We will discuss these fields in more detail in Part 2 of this series.\n\nIt is obvious that if Gaza/Palestine were allowed to claim what is rightfully theirs and if the United Nations stood firm in supporting them we would see a transformation in Gaza and West Bank that is beyond imagination.\n\nWhy does this simple problem become a major headache for them all to resolve? Why cant the UN Peacekeepers move into Gaza and take over the border control and once in place lift the entire blockade of Palestine by land, sea and air?\n\nI think I already know the answer which caused the same problem in the Balkans and in Lebanon. All locations had been bombarded with new tech weapons which contained components of depleted or enriched uranium. All locations were used as a test bed for US manufactured weapons. What peacekeeper, in their right mind, would subject themselves to such contamination?\n\nAs we have already know the UN peacekeepers in the Balkans fell victim to DU contamination and many of those have since died. In Lebanon we saw a similar situation but this time the IDF did not reveal it had used such weapons even though samples recovered since the 2006 attack have tested positive to DU/EU weapons usage. The Lebanese and the UN suppressed this information in order to put in place the peacekeeping forces. It is obvious that had such troops found out the truth no troops would have gone into such a contaminated environment.\n\nThe writing is on the wall that we are unlikely to see UN Peacekeepers in Gaza or West Bank. To add insult to injury the UN through its agencies the UNEP and the UNDP have now commenced the clearing of all bombed structures and will over the next year remove and crush the rubble. This highly toxic residue will then be spread around the Gaza Strip for new roads.\n\nAs I have previously pointed out this is against the normal policy of the UNEP and UNDP in dealing with potentially contaminated sites so why has this been allowed to happen. Why are both these authorities allowed to create a vast secondary contamination of aerosols to drift over the entire strip once again and also spread into adjacent countries such as Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon etc? It is extremely hard to ascertain what the final death toll will be from the initial action by Israel (Cast Lead) and how this secondary contamination (by the UNEP/UNDP) will affect the entire region and beyond.\n\nGaza/Palestine does not need any handouts or run of the mill aid when it has such vast reserves. It can have whatever it wants if it were given the same chance like any other country to reap in its own resources….rather than let Israel rape it of its future. When we look at all the aid that is sent by boat or by convoy it’s easy to understand that in most cases it doesn’t get through….why? Because Israel doesn’t allow it to get through? They control all borders (even the so called Egyptian controlled border) and have been handed control of the offshore waters by President Abbas.\n\nWE should stop wasting these vast sums of money in aid, which incidentally frequently gets dumped in vast stockpiles out in the desert, because it has either expired or that the authorities don’t allow it to be kept in good storage and it perishes. Is this the right way to treat compassionate donations from around the world?\n\nSo what is the simple solution….”Allow Gaza/Palestine to bring their own natural gas onshore to the Gaza Strip. Allow the wealth of these resources to fund major projects such as a large Domestic Gas Plant, a large Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plant, build new Industrial Gas Turbine power stations (that run on natural gas), promote new Joint Venture industrial entities that run on natural gas and then create a public transport system that also runs on gas.\n\nAs you can see Gaza/Palestine could have a very prosperous future but will we, the world, allow this to happen and what price will the people of Palestine have to pay? One thing for sure the United Nations must accept that it failed Palestine miserably. As for the Oslo accord we can also look at this extremely flawed agreement in the next part and show how Israeli manipulated this agreement and then totally disregarded it.\n\nIDF for the second time on standby around the border with Gaza\n\nDepleted Uranium Weapon exploding in Gaza in total violation of the Geneva Convention\n\nIn closing we now have a second conflict on the horizon with Israel on full alert for yet another genocidal attack on the Gaza strip and as you may have guessed using the same illegal weapons of mass destruction against these innocent people.\n\nWhat the people of Israel do not know is that their government and the IDF are “Nuking” their own country as a result of using depleted uranium in all of their weaponry…………millions upon millions of radioactive nano particles are now drifting over the border into Israel from this ongoing conflict causing a major hike in many forms of cancer and infertility within their own country!!\n\nPeter Eyre – Middle East Consultant – 17/11/2012\n\nPart 7\n\nAmerica and NATO’s burning desire to use DU/EU in all areas of conflict\n\nThis final article is totally dedicated to the millions of people that have become victim to the US, UK, NATO and IDF continued use of weapons containing uranium. It is in support of all the war veterans and innocent civilians in the Balkans, Kuwait, Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Gaza and now Pakistan. It is also dedicated to those thousands that have suffered terrible pain and since died. Can we ever imagine the pain of a mother that has lost her baby at birth or born with terrible disfigurement? Each and every day they are reminded of the consequences of having DU dumped in their backyard. Finally we have the pain of all those who know DU caused their problem and who are afraid to speak out. If they do the American Government will not support them or their families.\n\nThis chapter is probably the most difficult to write as it explains in detail how a country has become contaminated and how individuals at all levels have had their lives turned upside down by the deplorable use of weapons containing uranium. Beyond this human factor we also have to look at how such local conflicts become a global issue and how the instigators have no regard for their own military forces or the masses of innocent civilians.\n\nI think it would be appropriate as this stage to again repeat those terrible words once uttered by Henry Kissinger (Past US Secretary of State) when he said the following: “Military men are just dumb stupid animals to be used as pawns in foreign policy.” One could assume a similar understanding still exists when our respective own governments use uranium based weapons knowing that their own troops are going to become victim of its aerosol contamination. Doug Rokke put this into true perspective when he said that if you send your sons or daughters into a war zone “They will die”.\n\nWhat I find incredible is the massive recruitment drive currently underway in the UK whereby the recruitment teams set up in the main shopping centres and are always surrounded by young guys. This is particularly relevant in the low income/ high unemployment areas. They target these young guys and before they are 19 years (or less) are out in the battle field with nerves of steel but with no experience. Particularly saddening was a new soldier only 18 years of age who had arrived in Afghanistan and within one week went out on his first patrol and was killed (lambs to the slaughter).\n\nDustin Brim died at 22 of very aggressive cancers.\n\nDustin Brim – How DU Kills U.S. Soldiers – Author Christopher Bollyn\n\nThe widespread use of depleted uranium weapons in Iraq has led to a much higher death rate among U.S. military personnel than the Pentagon is willing to admit. The tragedy of Dustin Brim is the untold story of one such casualty.\n\nAn alarmingly high percentage of U.S. military personnel who have served in Iraq have been afflicted by a variety of health problems commonly known as Gulf War Syndrome. Exposure to uranium spread through the use of depleted uranium (DU) weapons is thought to be the primary cause of the high rate of chronic ailments and mortality among Gulf War vets.\n\n30 percent of Gulf War veterans from the first invasion of Iraq were afflicted with chronic health problems, a disability rate 5 times that of the Viet Nam War.\n\nWhile initial casualties from the first U.S. invasion of Iraq were light, long-term casualties from the 1991 war ultimately exceeded 30 percent, according to Terrell E. Arnold, former Chairman of the Department of International Studies at the National War College. The long-term casualty rate from the current war in Iraq, Arnold says, is likely to be much higher.\n\n“Gulf War II is and has been a far more hairy experience,” Arnold wrote. “Fighting has been heavier and much more prolonged. Many tons more of depleted uranium weapons have been used, along with other toxic devices. Thus, a long term casualty rate for American forces of 40 to 50 percent appears realistic.”\n\nIndeed, as AFP discovered in 2004, 40 percent of the soldiers in one unit were found to have malignant cancerous growths when they returned from a tour of a year and a few months in Iraq.\n\nIn one unit of 20 soldiers, 8 men were found to have “malignant growths” when they returned to the U.S.\n\nOfficial statistics of killed and wounded from the 15-year long war against Iraq do not reflect the veterans whose service related injuries only become apparent after they return from Iraq. The official death rate of those killed and wounded in Iraq does not include these vets, many of whom suffer slow and painful deaths as a direct result of their service. Dustin Brim was one of them.\n\n“In the end, will we be able to say that the outcome was worth 60-70,000 damaged, distorted or destroyed American lives, to say nothing of the effects on their families and communities?”\n\nAs I listened to Lori Brim, a single mother who lost her 22-year-old son in the war in Iraq, where he served as an U.S. Army mechanic, to ask whether she thought the outcome was worth her sacrifice never even entered my mind. The depth of her tragedy made such a question seem cruel and absurd.\n\nLori lost Dustin, her only child, when he died at Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, D.C. on September 24, 2004, after 6 months of fighting what was eventually diagnosed as Non-Hodgkins Diffuse Large Cell B Type Lymphoma. When Lori had asked the doctors how her young, healthy and strong son had contracted cancer all they would say was “bad luck.”\n\nHer case worker and nurses at the hospital were more forthcoming with information. At different times during the six months nurses would take Lori aside and urge her to do some research on DU. The nurses’ comments were “off the record,” Lori said.\n\nAsked whose idea it was for Dustin, a 20-year old from Daytona Beach with a passion for cars, to join the army in the summer of 2002, Lori said, “It was mine.” Dustin had not wanted to join the army, his mother said.\n\nBut Dustin was never meant to be in a war zone, she added. The U.S. Army recruiter had promised her, that as her only child, he would not be sent to war.\n\nDustin’s work in Iraq involved working on disabled army vehicles, including tanks, which his unit repaired and retrieved, or if damaged beyond repair, destroyed with explosives on the spot. Most of these vehicles, having been in the battlefield, would have been heavily laden with DU and other toxins.\n\nDr. Doug Rokke, former director of the U.S. Army’s Depleted Uranium Project, said that mechanics like Dustin are not properly prepared or protected to be working on DU contaminated vehicles. Lori said that her son had not even been equipped with a pair of gloves, not to speak of a mask or protective garb. The army’s failure to inform and instruct its personnel about the dangers of DU exposure is one of Dr. Rokke’s main concerns.\n\nDuring the last two weeks of March, he wrote to his mother telling her that he could not keep anything down and that his pain was so persistent and unbearable he was afraid he would lose focus and let his buddies down.\n\nOn March 31st he passed out from pain and breathlessness. His sergeant happened to be with him and took him to the doctors who thought he had gall bladder problems and sent him to the hospital in Baghdad.\n\nThe next day, April 1st, was Dustin’s 22nd birthday. After being assessed and heavily drugged with morphine, the doctors allowed him to call home to tell his mother that was very ill with cancer.\n\nIn Baghdad, the doctors had discovered that Dustin had a huge cancerous tumor on his esophagus, which severely restricted his breathing, a collapsed lung, the loss of a kidney, numerous blood clots and a tumor progressing on his liver.\n\nFrom April through September, Dustin underwent 6 different types of chemo-therapy. Each therapy seemed to work only for a few days after which the cancer returned with a vengeance. On September 24, 2004, Dustin succumbed to the cancer that had affected every organ in his body except for his heart and brain as the autopsy later revealed.\n\n“I knew from the start that Dustin had been either exposed to something in Iraq or his immune system had been affected by the vaccines they had to take,” Lori said. “The doctors would not comment on my thoughts but at the end they agreed they had never seen anything like it.”\n\nThe nurses, however, told Lori to keep researching DU. “Dustin is not the first and he won’t be the last,” one nurse told her confidentially.\n\n“The medical profession is the most controlled group in the U.S. in order to protect the nuclear weapons and nuclear power programs,” Lauren Moret, a Berkeley-based radiation expert told AFP about the silence of the doctors. The gagging of medical professionals has been achieved through a piece of legislation called the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), under which a doctor or nurse can be fined and imprisoned for disclosing health information to another person, even a family member.\n\nThe above is only an extract from the original story and I am sure you will all agree it is rather sad and clearly shows a US Government cover-up.\n\nJust ask the many thousands of returned vets, some of whom have paid the ultimate sacrifice, ask them how they are being cared for? Will their government accept that “WAR SYNDROME “Is as a direct result of uranium aerosols that are used extensively in all the theatres of war? So now let’s look at this in more detail and its symptoms.\n\nInhalated nanoparticle aerosols of DU/LLR are extremely complex. Insoluble DU particles deposited in the respiratory bronchioles and alveoli are cleared much more slowly, and, therefore, would be expected to deliver a higher radiation dose to the lung from alpha radiation. Once DU/LLR has entered the blood and irreversible cycle commences. The tissues in our bodies filter out the depleted uranium particles from the blood and cause a web of diseases called “Gulf War Syndrome”. So what can a victim of such a syndrome expect?\n\nLeuren Moret once compiled a list from Interviews with Gulf War Vets and their families.

Her response was as follows: Depleted uranium are particles that form at very high temperatures. They are uranium oxides that are insoluble. They are at least 100 times smaller than a white blood cell, so when the soldiers breathe, they inhale them. The particles go through the nose, go through the olfactory and into the brain, and it messes up their cognitive abilities, thought processes. It damages their mood-control mechanism in the brain. Four soldiers at FortBragg came back from Afghanistan, and within two months, those four had murdered their wives. This is part of the damage to the brain from the radiation and the particles.\n\n“The soldiers from Gulf War I in a group of 67 soldiers who came back, they had DU in their equipment, in their clothes, in their bodies, in their semen, and they had normal babies before they went over there to war. They came back and the VA did a study. Of 251 Gulf War Veterans in Mississippi, in 67 percent of them, their babies born after the war were deemed to have severe birth defects. They had brains missing, arms and legs missing, organs missing. They were born without eyes. They had horrible blood diseases. It’s horrific”.\n\nA US victim of his father’s involvement in a DU War\n\n“If you want to look at something, Life magazine did a photo essay which is still on the Internet. It’s called “The Tiny Victims of Desert Storm.” You should look at that — oh, my God, the post-Gulf War babies playing with their brothers and sisters who are normal. Basically, it’s like smoking crack, only you’re smoking radioactive crack. It goes straight into the blood stream. It’s carried all throughout the body into the bones, the bone marrow, and the brain. It goes into the foetus, it’s a systemic poison and a radiological”\n\nIt is fact that no matter whoever turns up with evidence that uranium based weapons are a significant danger to our health they still keep manufacturing them and using them in every theatre of war. Even hard line critics refuse to accept peer reviewed journals such as that by biochemist Diane Stern of the Northern Arizona University who stated that “recent studies should make the issue hard to ignore”. Her results — published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at a recent Society of Toxicology conference — established that when cells are exposed to uranium, the uranium binds to DNA, and the cells mutate. She said “exposure during the Gulf wars may link to increased cancers and birth defects in soldiers and in civilian survivors of exposure in the Middle East”. I have no doubt that Diane, like many before her will be removed from office for revealing the truth (Stearns’ research was published in the journals Mutagenesis and Molecular Carcinogenesis).\n\nWe should now turn back the clock to the time of the First Gulf War when Depleted Uranium (DU) was used extensively. It became apparent to US senior military staff that DU had created a major problem. On one hand, military speaking, DU was extremely effective and on the other hand it had severe consequences on the environment and its health effects on military personnel and innocent civilians.\n\nLets again re visit the story as told by Doug Rokke in his own words: “I was assigned to the DU assessment team as the team health physicist and medic by directive of Headquarters Department of the Army in Washington, D.C. via a message sent to the theater commander during March 1991. What we found can be explained in three words: “OH MY GOD”.\n\n“According to official documents each uranium penetrator could loose up to 70% of its mass on impact creating fixed and loose contamination with the remainder passing through the equipment or structure to lie on the terrain. On-site impact investigations suggest that the mass loss is about 40% which forms fixed and loose contamination leaving about 60% of the initial mass of the penetrator in the solid or pencil form. Equipment contamination included uranium oxides, other hazardous materials, unstable unexploded ordnance, and by-products of exploded ordinance. U.S. Army Materiel Command documents sent to us during ODS stated the oxide was 57% insoluble and 43% soluble with at least 50% was respirable. In addition other radioactive materials were detected that could pose a risk through inhalation, ingestion, or wound contamination. In most cases except for penetrator fragments, contamination was inside destroyed equipment or structures, on the destroyed equipment, or within 25 meters of the equipment. After we returned to the United States myself and two others with assistance wrote the Theater Clean up plan which was reportedly passed up through U.S. Department of Defense officials to the U.S. Department of State and consequently to the Emirate of Kuwaiti. Today, it is obvious that none of this information regarding clean up of extensive DU contamination ever was given to the Iraqi’s. Consequently, although we knew there were and still are substantial hazards existing within Iraq they have been ignored by the United States and Great Britain for political and economic reasons”.\n\n“Iraqi, Albano-Kosovar, and Serbian representatives have asked numerous times for DU contamination management and medical care procedures but they have been continuously rebuffed by U.S officials. Although residents of Vieques, who are U.S. citizens, have also asked for medical care and completion of environmental remediation DOD officials have not responded. Dr. Bernard Rostker, Assistant Secretary of the Army, recently said that he did not see any reason why the United States should tell anyone where DU was used in Kosovo. Consequently military personnel and civilians have been exposed.”\n\nDoug’s article went on to say: The probable hazards were known before the use of depleted uranium munitions during the Gulf war as official documents substantiate. A United States Defense Nuclear Agency memorandum written by LTC Lyle that was sent to our team in Saudi Arabia stated that\n\nAs Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD), ground combat units, and civil populations of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Iraq come increasingly into contact with DU ordnance, we must prepare to deal with potential problems. Toxic war souvenirs, political furor, and post conflict clean up (host nation agreement) are only some of the issues that must be addressed. Alpha particles (uranium oxide dust) from expended rounds is a health concern but, Beta particles from fragments and intact rounds is a serious health threat, with possible exposure rates of 200 millirads per hour on contact.\n\nThis memorandum, the reports that we prepared immediately after the Gulf War as a part of the depleted uranium assessment project to recover DU destroyed and contaminated U.S. equipment, the previous research, and other expressed concerns led to the publication of a United States Department of Defense directive signed by General Eric Shinseki to quote:\n\n“Provide adequate training for personnel who may come in contact with depleted uranium equipment.\n\nComplete medical testing of personnel exposed to DU contamination during the Persian Gulf War.\n\nDevelop a plan for DU contaminated equipment recovery during future operations.”\n\nIt is thus indisputable that United States Department of Defense officials were and are still aware of the unique and unacceptable hazards associated with using depleted uranium munitions. Consequently, I was recalled to active duty in the U.S. Army and assigned to the U.S. Army Chemical School located at Fort McClellan, Alabama as the DU Project Director and tasked with developing training and management procedures. The project included a literature review; extensive curriculum development project involving representatives from all branches of the U.S. Department of Defense and representatives from England, Canada, Germany, and Australia; and basic research at the Nevada Test Site located northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada, to validate management procedures.\n\nThe products of the DU project included three training curricula:\n\nTier I: General Audience\n\nTier II: Battle Damage and Recovery Operations\n\nTier III: Chemical Officer / NCO\n\nThree video tapes:\n\nDepleted Uranium Hazard Awareness\n\nContaminated and Damaged Equipment Management\n\nOperation of the AN/PDR 77 Radiac Set and\n\nThe draft DU and LLRM contamination management procedures including a United States Army Regulation: Management of Equipment Contaminated with Depleted Uranium or Radioactive Commodities and an United States Army Pamphlet Handling Procedures for Equipment Contaminated with Depleted Uranium or Radioactive Commodities.\n\nAlthough, these products with approval of all participants were all completed and ready for distribution by January 1996, U.S. Army, U.S. Department of Defense, British, German, Canadian, and Australian officials disregarded repeated directives and did not implement or only have implemented portions of the training or management procedures. Unfortunately, only a few U.S. personnel have been trained. The training and management plan have not been given to all individuals and representatives of governments whose populations and environment have affected by DU contamination. These failures have been verified by U.S. General Accounting Office investigators and the report was published during March 2000.\n\nDoug and his team were put under tremendous pressure by the careful wording of a memo that placed an emphasis on how important DU weaponry was to the US military and that their final report should not jeopardise DU usage by revealing such sensitive issues. .\n\nA second memo around the same time was written by Gregory K. Lyle of the Defense Nuclear Agency, part of which said: “Alpha particles (uranium oxide dust) from expended rounds is a health concern but, Beta particles from fragments and intact rounds is a serious health threat, with a possible exposure rate of 200 millirems per hour on contact.” The memo warns that “specific DoD guidance concerning the disposition of DU material in the post combat period/restoration phase is currently lacking.” The writer hoped that “expression of our concerns over the side effects of DU use will help ensure protection for our troops and allies”.\n\nWe see time and time again the serious attempts, by the powers that be, to cover up, not only the extreme dangers of DU but also in the creation of their own chosen experts that tell the world that DU is safe. They are totally responsible for this false façade of carefully concocted stories. It is they themselves that manipulate the UNEP, WHO and DOD’s and leave us with their own hidden agenda of WMD. However, the world is now waking up to their evil intentions by saying enough is enough! Educated people around the world now see that WMD has a different meaning: “Weapons of Mass Deception and Weapons of Mass Dependency”.\n\nDoug clearly pointed out that not only was his team of experts totally unprepared and unprotected for such a task but so was every military man in the field of battle. The masks provided do not filter out DU aerosol particles! and thus expose everyone to its inhaled contamination. Doug and his team have all become victims of DU, many of whom have since died.\n\nLet’s now turn our attention to the war vets themselves that have returned to their respective countries from the many theatres of war. It is a well know fact that those soldiers that had children prior to going to war have fathered perfectly normal children. However since their return this has not been the case thus resulting in a higher that normal incidence of still births or giving birth to babies with terrible disfigurements. This strengthens the link between the inhalation of DU aerosols and its ability to alter our DNA. The fact is that US, UK, NATO and the IDF are subjecting their own military personnel to high levels of contamination from the very weapons they are using whilst at the same time having no regard for the civilian populations living nearby. We fully understand that these aerosols do not identify international borders and are creating thousands of indirect casualties elsewhere.\n\nThis became more obvious after the IDF attacked Lebanon and contaminated their own people in Northern Israel resulting in sharp rises in many forms of cancers, diabetes and infertility problems etc.\n\nIt would be appropriate to share the experience of Bud Deraps, an 82 year old WW2 Navy veteran when he said: “Please let me share with you what I learned when I visited Iraq in 2001 with the Veterans for Peace Iraq Water Project. A major purpose of our trip was to visit sewer polluted water plants in the Basra area which were being rebuilt in part with VFP funds. We also spent time looking at other public institutions, in particular hospitals, where I saw for myself the misery and devastation our weapons and sanctions had caused. For example, we visited the Basra Children’s Hospital where we saw rooms and hallways overflowing with children seriously ill from drinking polluted water. Many more were dying from leukaemia and other cancers. The doctors said they would all surely die there because they could not obtain the many medicines needed due to the sanctions. We stood in the midst of this disaster feeling stunned, ashamed, and entirely helpless”.\n\nHe went on to say “Prior to the current war, the Birth Defect Research for Children based in Florida produced a study showing 31 specific birth defects that radiation and other Gulf War exposures could cause in birth defects. They found that the Gulf veterans parented on average 2 to 4 times more defected babies than those who had not served there” “The Medical Journal of the Basra hospital reported that from 1991 to 2001, there was an increase of 426% in general malignancies, 366% in leukemia’s and 600% in birth defects. With respect to birth defects, the doctors explained that when a person becomes DU contaminated, his or her DNA can be altered, thus, the person is potentially subject to parenting a child with minor to extreme birth anomalies”\n\nBud highlighted the fact that in the initial short war a relatively low number of troops had been killed in action (148) but that since that event around 13,000 had died as a result of DU related illnesses. During 2003-2004 massive amounts of DU weaponry were used and contaminated a vast area. Millions of troops and civilians had entered this contaminated zone and one can only imagine the fallout from aerosol contamination to all those concerned. Other factors would enhance the situation by way of secondary contamination such as from on going dust storms and helicopter down wash etc .Bud lost his grandson in Iraq at the tender age of only 19.\n\nAmerican, British and NATO soldiers are returning from the battlefield with numerous health problems that have been highlighted in Leuren Moret’s previous statement. As we have seen they include cancers, lung and skin problems, cerebral lesions, and badly deformed new-born babies. We have seen the extremely high genetically induced problems in Iraqi. Prof Selma Al Taha, Director of a genetic laboratory said “since the war we have significant increase in congenital deformities: hydrocephalus [an abnormal increase in the amount of cerebrospinal fluid within the cranial cavity, which is accompanied by enlargement of the skull, forehead and atrophy of the brain], encephalitis, spinal bifida [incomplete closure of the bones of the spinal column, depriving the spinal marrow of protection], but also monstrous deformities of the limbs, and infants born without a head or a heart.” His colleague, Al Askri, a specialist in nuclear medicine, emphasized “a large increase in thyroid problems and cancers”.\n\nUS Depleted Uranium Shell\n\nDepleted Uranium upon impact\n\nAsk the mother who lost her baby if Depleted Uranium is safe!!\n\nThe consequences in the use of Depleted Uranium on innocent civilians is not only a crime, it is also slow genocide and makes the holocaust look rather minuscule by comparison!!\n\nExtensive use of DU by NATO forces in the Balkans has dramatically changed the health statistics. Before the war many locations had typically normal statistics in their respective regions. Since the war however things have changed significantly. Kosova for instance had a 3 x increase in cancers and Bosnia-Herzegovina a 5 x increase resulting in hundreds of people dying from cancer related illnesses. It is also a known fact that many NATO peacekeepers had also contracted cancer and since died.\n\nDoctor Slavko Zdrale has treated several cancer patients over the past years. During an interview he said:\n\n“a few years ago we started noticing that there was as many as five times the number of people dying of different kinds of cancer as compared to the number of people who had been sick before the war.”\n\n“We worked out that 90% of them came from areas NATO had bombed and from areas where ammunition with uranium was used. Nobody in the international community took much notice until Italian soldiers who were stationed in those areas started dying from cancer-related illnesses.”\n\nSimo Tusevljak, the coordinator of the Research and documentation of war crimes, stated that “we believe that this was a deliberate attempt by NATO forces to kill as many people as possible. It was also a chance for the West to test new weapons.” .\n\nIt is interesting to note that we have seen these same tactic used in Lebanon and Gaza where these same so called dirty weapons were tested. I also might add that despite the resounding comments from all the powers that be (UNEP, WHO, ICRP, IAEA, Governments, DOD’s and NATO etc) the conclusive evidence is not in their theoretical evidence but rather in the practical real time evidence in the growing statistics in illness and deaths from various forms of cancer etc.\n\nTime and time again we see a dramatic increase in cancers immediately following the use of weaponry containing uranium components. It is obvious that this entire deception by the above authorities has now gone beyond the realms of gross neglect. One can only relate to this as being one of the greatest crimes against humanity ever to have existed and has the potential to exceed the Holocaust many times. It is extremely sad that the terrible fate that befell Jewish communities years ago will again be relived in many parts of the world.\n\nIt is ironic that those that suffered are now creating another Holocaust not only on their neighbours but also on themselves (Israelis killing Israelis) as the contaminated aerosols do not identify international borders and drift over from Lebanon into Northern Israel and likewise in Gaza to adjacent Central and Southern Israel. The world must prohibit without delay the use of any weapon that contains uranium components……these are certainly not conventional. So far only Belgium has had the courage to stand firm against these evil weapons.\n\nOut of all the theatres of war Iraq must take centre stage. This country has been blasted so heavily with uranium based weapons that one could not even contemplate its future. One man with tears in his eyes accused the West of taking away the “Genetics” of his country. Can we the public even think of the implications that have now fallen upon this proud country that was once the birthplace of civilization? How can we all, as responsible citizens, just continue to allow our governments to get away with this mass murder?\n\nJust take a moment and look at the statistics coming out of Iraq and then decide for yourself if DU/EU weapons are safe? Of course you can take the expert advice of the Nigel Lamb’s of this world or just look at factual figures and the coincidence of increase illnesses immediately after such attacks. The level of cancers in children became so high that USAID and an American NGO called Project Hope decided that a specialist children’s hospital had to be built in Basra. Child mortality rates were very high with 150 out of 1,000 children dying before reaching the age of five. The incidence of childhood cancer was found to be eight to 10 times more common than in the West, and cancer rates in southern Iraq were even higher than the National average. With such high statistics it was obvious that a children’s hospital with a special focus on paediatric oncology should be built in Basra.\n\nDoesn’t it appear hypocritical that US/UK forces created this major problem as a result of the extensive use of DU weaponry in Southern Iraq and then turn this self induced disaster into a huge PR exercise by showing that they really care? This huge “Basra Children’s Hospital Project” all comes under the watchful eye of the US Corps of Engineers. The project was funded through multiple sources, including the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund; Project HOPE; and the Spanish government through the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). Needless to say the project was given to that notorious US Company Bechtel.\n\nOccasionally we see a glimmer of hope in the fight to bring justice to the many thousands of victims. As we already know Italian troops became victim to DU during their duties in the Balkans. One such case shows that despite all the stress and pressure individuals can make a difference. Here is such a story of the courage and determination as told by Francesco Iannuzzelli | Peacelink, Italy:\n\nIn memory of Stefano Melone\n\nStefano Melone began his service in the Italian army in 1977. For many years he had been deployed to a whole host of missions abroad. He had been in Lebanon, Albania, Somalia, ex-Yugoslavia and Kosovo. He was a helicopter pilot but he was also assigned to NBC troops.\n\nSuddenly, in February 2000, he was diagnosed with cancer (Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma of the bone, lung and pleura). In August 2000 a military commission acknowledged the link between his illness and the military service abroad, so he applied for a pension. However, after many surgical operations, he died on 8th November 2001 in Milan, at the age of 40.\n\nSince then, his wife has been engaged in a battle to obtain compensation from the Ministry of Defence, together with many other soldiers and families in similar situations. Before dying, Stefano had asked his wife to do this, so that their children and all the other families could safeguard a future in spite of the terrible pain and loss.\n\nTo date, 25 Italian soldiers have died of lymphoma, cancer or leukemia, and 260 are currently ill, after their missions abroad. Many of these missions took place in countries where depleted uranium has been used, including Bosnia, Kosovo, and Iraq.\n\nAfter three reports and many mistakes, a commission nominated by the Ministry of Defence, has eventually acknowledged an increase in lymphoma among soldiers assigned to missions in the Balkans.\n\nIn spite of that, the Italian Ministry of Defence refuses to give compensation to their families, let alone to admit that depleted uranium has a role in these cases. Hardly any information is given to soldiers currently on missions abroad about the risks they’re facing, and whoever complains about this lack of information is treated as a traitor and marginalised. It’s too expensive and difficult to obtain medical tests and therapies for this kind of health problems. Only few soldiers or families have the courage to stand up and ask for compensation after illness or death.\n\nPaola Melone, Stefano’s wife, has been very active during all these years. She has finally won her battle. On the 26th of June, in Rome, the magistrates of a local court have sentenced that the Ministry of Defence must pay 500.000 Euros in compensation to Stefano Melone’s family.\n\nFor the families that have been struggling all these years for their rights, this is a major achievement. Veterans associations, some peace organisations, and a few MPs have expressed their appreciation of this sentence, as it brings some light of justice in the darkness created by the military on the issue of depleted uranium.\n\nAnother promising report came from Anes Alic (Oct 2007), a senior correspondent for ISN Security Watch in Southeastern Europe. In this report Anes revealed that an increase of the number of Italian soldiers who served in the Balkans during the 1990s who are falling seriously ill due to depleted uranium exposure is causing a public outrage in Italy, as the government downplays the extent of the problem, widely referred to as “Balkan Syndrome.” It was interesting to note that the Italian government passed a decree allocating €170 million (US$245 million) in compensation for military personnel who have contracted diseases during their service – some 28,000 of them in Balkan missions alone.\n\nIt was also interesting that some time ago an independent enquiry was set up in the UK which called on the Ministry of Defence to admit the existence of Gulf War syndrome and set aside millions of pounds to compensate sick veterans. Lord Lloyd of Berwick, the former law lord heading the inquiry, said it was time for defence staff to stop “assuming blithely that everyone else was wrong” and start restoring the trust and confidence of the Gulf War veterans, who felt “let down and rejected”.\n\nThe Government had already missed one opportunity to begin building bridges by refusing to take part in the anonymously funded inquiry, he added. While stopping short of blaming the MoD for sending the forces into a “very toxic environment”, Lord Lloyd said: “We are not in the business of establishing blame … Whether they are culpable in a wider sense; it is a matter for you to make up your own minds after reading the report.” It was also interesting to note the comment made by Ian Townsend, secretary general of the Royal British Legion, said: “We asked for an independent public inquiry. The government denied us that”.\n\nIt is obvious in conclusion that all the authorities and governments listed in all my previous articles are guilty of a major conspiracy to cover up, especially those governments who form part of NATO. At least Italy has gone part of the way to heal the wound but the remainder remain stubborn to the core!\n\nPrevailing winds continue to transport these toxic aerosols to every corner of the globe and as we have seen Europe takes a significant amount of fallout from the Middle East. When one studies the wind currents it is also easy to see how these aerosols also enter the US via the polar region. One could assume that almost half of the planets are currently breathing the bi products of these weapons. You will find little of this written in the media as most are controlled from higher authority. It is only the public who have the ability to object to this outrageous crime. It is the public that must keep up this pressure until such time as these weapons have been totally prohibited. To the many War Vets and innocent civilians around the world I ask you all to remain strong and to keep up your fight for truth and justice. To those that have created this evil act of slow genocide against the populations of the world I remind you that your day will come. To those countries who manufacture and use these weapons, in particular the United States of American, the United Kingdom, NATO and the IDF I remind you that one day they will be prohibited.\n\nFinally we come to those many governments, departments and organisations that must be held responsible for allowing this deception to continue for decades. For their gross neglect in standing up for what they were supposed to safeguard and who were assigned to represent the peoples of the world – to protect them – to care for their health and their environment namely: The United Nations(UN) – United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) – The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP World Health Organisation (WHO) – The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) – International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) – The Governments of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) – The respective Departments of Defence/ Military – The Nuclear Industry – The Pharmaceutical Industry and all those Medical Experts and Institutions who accepted that DU was safe. I guess one must also add the World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to this list, not because it is has any connection to Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) but because of the suffering they have caused around the world by Weapons of Mass Deception and Weapons of Mass Dependency. Shame on you all.\n\nDo we really care about our planet?…………I certainly do……..now its up to you…….remember “what goes around comes around”\n\nPeter Eyre – Middle East Consultant – 30/10/2012"
