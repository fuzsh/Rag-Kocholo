        "text": "At 72, Stefano Pessina, the Italian billionaire who owns Boots the Chemist, is not a big fan of wrinkle-smoothing serums aimed at the masculine complexion.\n\n‘What do I use? Nothing, as you can see. Every morning, I take a shower, and I use the shampoo I find at the hotel – at most I might use a conditioner. At home, of course, I use Boots products.’\n\nHis answer gives a glimpse into his globetrotting lifestyle – he racks up more air miles in a year than he can count. But perhaps he can forgo a fix with No 7 For Men Anti-Ageing Balm because he has his own elixir of youth: deal-making.\n\nPessina is in the midst of an ambitious tie-up he embarked upon two years ago with Walgreens, one of the biggest chemists’ chains in the US.\n\nPhase one involved the American giant taking a 45 per cent stake for around £4.5billion in Alliance Boots, the parent company of the British pharmacies. The second stage is a full-scale transatlantic merger likely to happen next year – which is one reason he may be spending even less time at the Monaco home the he shares with his partner, Ornella Barra, 60, who is also a senior executive at the company.\n\nBarra and Pessina built the Alliance Boots empire together and are probably the planet’s most formidable corporate power-couple.\n\nIf Walgreens takes up its option to buy the remainder of Alliance Boots next year, the pair will be at the helm of the world’s leading pharmacy, healthcare and cosmetics retailer, with more than 11,000 stores in 25 countries, more than 365,000 employees and sales of $110billion (£66billion).\n\n‘I will be the biggest shareholder by far,’ Pessina adds, with a holding expected to be around 18 per cent, and Greg Wasson, the Walgreens boss is lined up as the chief executive of the combined group.\n\nAs if a merger with Walgreens, based in Deerfield near Chigaco, were not enough, Pessina has also forged a partnership with Amerisource Bergen, a US pharmacy wholesaler. The deal gives Walgreens and Alliance Boots the ability to buy drugs together, which Pessina says will give them enormous pricing power. The pair also have the right to buy a stake of up to 25 per cent in Amerisource by 2017.\n\nCould that tie lead to yet another merger? ‘I don’t believe we should buy or merge with AmerisourceBergen,’ he says. ‘I believe we can leave them as an independent company but integrate our operations so we have as many synergies as possible. Today the wholesaling business should be global.’\n\nEven as he finds enormous success across the Atlantic, Pessina is dogged in Britain by hostility arising from his buyout of Boots – one of the UK’s oldest and best-loved companies – which opened its first shop, in Nottingham, in 1849.\n\nAttacks on his corporate tax affairs remain a thorn in his side, almost a decade after he took over the chain, with campaign groups such as War on Want slating Alliance Boots for its Swiss base.\n\n‘Honestly, I believe companies have to pay taxes where they make money, and this is what we do,’ Pessina counters. ‘But you can be based wherever you want to be. We decided we wanted to be based in Switzerland. For us it is a practical choice, because it is a friendly base for pharmaceutical companies, but Boots is still in Nottingham.’\n\nPessina began his extraordinary career almost by accident. He studied nuclear engineering at Milan Polytechnic, and initially went into academia. It was only in his mid-30s that he joined his family business, a pharmaceutical wholesaler.\n\n‘My father was not particularly happy about the business, so I started by chance, because he asked me jokingly whether I would be able to restructure his business, and I accepted the bet,’ he says.\n\nThen other business owners asked him to restructure their firms. ‘I said yes, but I don’t want to be paid, I want a piece of the business. That way I put together a nice collection of businesses.’\n\nDuring his Italian acqusition trail he met Ornella Barra, who sold her business to him but carried on working for the enlarged company, setting in train decades of personal and professional partnership.\n\nIt is an unusual arrangement at the top of a global company, but it works, insiders say, because the pair are like peas in a pod, both multi-lingual hyper-achievers sharing a ferocious work ethic. In their spare time he collects fine art and designs his boats, while she has projects restoring their property.\n\nPessina says they operate in separate spheres at work. ‘She is much more operational and I am much more strategic.’\n\nIndustry insiders say Barra – a director of global insurer Generali and 21st in Forbes magazine’s list of the 50 most powerful women in global business this year – is a serious player in her own right. ‘If she had never met Stefano, she would be up there with the female titans like Sheryl Sandberg on her own merits,’ said one.\n\nPessina and Barra ventured beyond Italy into Portugal, Greece and France in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nIn 1998 his Alliance Sante Group merged with Britain’s UniChem, and then he orchestrated a merger with Boots in 2006. A year later the Italian teamed up with venture capitalists KKR to take the group off the stock market in Europe’s biggest ever private equity deal, financed by £10billion of debt.\n\nThe move, which signalled the high water mark of the pre-crisis private equity boom, was hugely controversial. Criticism of private equity was rising to a crescendo amid accusations of asset-stripping, wholesale dismissals, tax avoidance, short-term profiteering and mountainous debt burdens.\n\nMany predicted Boots would be bled white, but Pessina says the doom-mongers have been proved wrong. ‘We have done a relatively good job in Boots. We have re-energised it. We had almost £10billion of debt, but we invested in the first two years something like £1billion, most of it in the stores.’\n\nHe says the company as a whole has doubled its earnings before interest and tax in five to six years, as well as repaying ‘a substantial portion’ of debt and contributing in excess of half a billion pounds to the Boots staff pension fund to make good its past deficit.\n\nShareholders – of which he is the largest – have not extracted any dividend payments. ‘We did not distribute one penny of dividend. We have used all the money to grow the business and to repay the debt.’\n\nFar from contemplating retirement, Pessina has his sights set on new markets. ‘We are very active in China, we are looking at Latin America. And sometimes we have been able to do deals – in Turkey, in Egypt, in Russia, in Thailand.’"
