        "text": "Nasdaq has finally found a way of exercising its power over the London Stock Exchange.\n\nOn Tuesday night it put a call through to Paternoster Square informing the LSE that it would not be voting for a resolution at the group's AGM allowing the exchange to allocate up to 33% of new shares, if it so wished.\n\nIts reasons for doing so, it told the LSE, were ones of corporate governance. The convention in New York is that there should be no allocation greater than 19.9% and as the LSE's biggest holder it didn't want to see the rules infringed.\n\nBob Greifeld, who has been shown the door twice by LSE chief executive Clara Furse, must have a big smile on his face. Nasdaq insists, of course, that its vote on a technicality has absolutely nothing to do with its view of the LSE's proposed takeover of Borsa Italiana which has to be approved at an EGM next month.\n\nThe LSE told investors yesterday that if the Italian deal goes ahead it would be 10% earnings enhancing in year one. But it could also be the start of a new Club Med strategy for rolling out the LSE's cash model across Southern Europe.\n\nNow there is a small obstacle on the horizon in the shape of Greifeld.\n\nWith 30% of the LSE's stock, Nasdaq could potentially lead a revolt at the EGM where Furse requires at least 50% of the votes.\n\nThe exchange is confident that it has enough friends among its investors, the people who saw off Nasdaq, to win approval anyway.\n\nBut this time around it will be very hard for Furse or her chairman, the urbane Chris Gibson-Smith, to ignore Greifeld.\n\nHe will have to be courted like all other shareholders, especially as they will have to persuade him to substantially dilute his Nasdaq stake.\n\nIt is very hard for any company under siege, as the LSE was for so long, to be kind to the predators. To do so would have been an indication of weakness. Marathon runner Greifeld clearly has not forgotten the snub.\n\nBut with the LSE still powering ahead on dealing volumes and initial public offerings, Furse still has the trading momentum to keep Nasdaq at bay.\n\nBoots exit\n\nThe departure of Richard Baker from Alliance Boots, first reported on these pages, was predictable.\n\nIt was one thing working with Stefano Pessina when he was the deputy chairman of the business and his partner Ornella Barra was also sitting on the board.\n\nBut when Pessina cemented his position by becoming executive chairman and the domineering figure of KKR private equity boss Dominic Murphy was looking over his shoulder it all became too much.\n\nIt was always clear that the governance set-up after Alliance UniChem and Boots merged a year ago would be uncomfortable.\n\nBut Baker and his advisers convinced themselves that because the Boots chief executive was not a person with a 'big ego' he could work well alongside the Italian pair.\n\nHowever, the working relationship was not good enough for Baker to consider another five years as chief executive working under Pessina.\n\nBaker is right to point to his achievements at Boots. His decision to refocus the company on pharmacies and healthcare paid off with sales gains. He recognised the value of the company's cash flow backed by taxpayers money across Europe.\n\nAs a result shareholders achieved a better exit price than they might ever have imagined.\n\nHis mistake, and that of former non-executive chairman Sir Nigel Rudd, was to fail to consider that if Alliance Boots has remained a public company the benefits could have been more broadly shared as they have been at Marks & Spencer, the London Stock Exchange and hopefully J Sainsbury.\n\nBy selling out to private equity the bond between Alliance Boots, its employees and other stakeholders has been fractured.\n\nSky surge\n\nBSkyB has had more than its fair share of regulatory troubles of late as Virgin Media has challenged it in the court of government rather than the marketplace.\n\nBut it looks as if James Murdoch, who has invested heavily in turning BSkyB into a premium pay TV, broadband and telephony supplier, is having the last laugh. The group surpassed market expectations by grabbing 90,000 customers in the last quarter of the year.\n\nFrom a standing start it has won 5pc of the telephone/broadband market and its surge will soon start to give pause not just to Virgin Media, but BT and TalkTalk, the other broadband challenger.\n\nSky built its position as a broadcaster on the back of sport and movies. Content remains a key driver.\n\nInvestment in premium services, Sky Plus and High Definition, at a competitive packaged price has also become a powerful weapon."
