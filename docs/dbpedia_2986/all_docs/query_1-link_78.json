        "text": "The board of high street retailer and drug wholesaler Alliance Boots today rejected a Â£9.7bn takeover bid from its deputy chairman Stefano Pessina and private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.\n\nThe board said the Â£10-a-share offer 'did not reflect the fundamental value of the company or the attractive prospects, opportunities and synergies available to Alliance Boots'.\n\nDirectors said the offer would not be recommended to Alliance Boots shareholders.\n\nThe Alliance Boots board met today to consider the bid in an emergency meeting, without Mr Pessina or his fellow director and long-term partner Ornella Barra being present.\n\nThe rejection of the 'friendly approach' comes less than nine months after the creation of Alliance Boots through the Â£7.8bn merger between Boots and Alliance UniChem in July last year.\n\nThe company's shares rose more than 8% today - or 75p - and were trading at 1005p immediately after the rejection of the offer, suggesting investors were expecting a higher bid to emerge.\n\nMr Pessina owns a 15% stake in Alliance Boots but is reportedly keen to take the group private to grow the merged company away from the public spotlight.\n\nAlliance Boots has about 2,600 healthcare outlets in the UK, plus 400 overseas pharmacies in Norway, the Netherlands, Thailand, Italy and Ireland.\n\nThe group's healthcare and pharmaceutical distribution operation spans 14 countries.\n\nShares in Alliance Boots had soared today 58p to 988p, in anticipation of the meeting.\n\nAt issue for the seven Alliance Boots non-executive directors was whether to allow KKR full access to the company's books - despite the fact KKR will already have been well-briefed by Pessina.\n\nShares in Alliance Boots shares soared in late Friday trading, up nearly 20% to 930p, after news broke of the buyout offer. After trading closed, Pessina confirmed his interest in doing the deal at Â£10 a share.\n\nBoots is not due to make a trading statement until the end of the month, but the current situation may bring that forward.\n\nDealing with the dilemma was Alliance Boots' highly experienced chairman Sir Nigel Rudd, the former boss of the Williams congomerate who has had a string of lucrative City directorships, which currently include the chairmanship of Britain's biggest car retailer Pendragon and the deputy chairmanship of Barclays bank.\n\nBoth Rudd and the board's senior non-executive director Guy Dawson, the former Merrill Lynch and Deutsche merchant banker who now heads Tricorn Partners, were both on the Boots board prior to the Alliance merger.\n\nThe other former Boots non-executive directors still on the board are Tim Parker, chief executive of The AA motoring organisation and former boss of Kwik-Fit and Clarks shoes, and HÃ©lÃ¨ne Ploix who brings the company's board some private equity insight as the chairman of French venture capital house Pechel Industries.\n\nThere are also three former Alliance UniChem non-executives on the board: Adrian Loader, director of strategy at Royal Dutch Shell; Patrick Ponsolle, the former boss of Eurotunnel who now has a senior role at Morgan Stanley; and top Unilever executive Manfred Stach.\n\nIt is understood that all seven non-executives took part in the meeting via a conference call."
