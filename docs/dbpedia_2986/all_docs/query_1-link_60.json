        "text": "When Stefano Pessina struck a deal to merge Alliance Boots with Walgreens, it was seen as an astute and glorious finale to the veteran dealmaker’s time in charge of Alliance Boots, Britain’s biggest pharmacy chain.\n\nInstead it appears that this mega-merger may just have been the start. Rather than settling into retirement, the Italian is excited about the future, having effectively engineered an extraordinary reverse takeover of Walgreens, one of America’s oldest companies, with himself in control as acting chief executive.\n\n“Well, this has been a necessity because someone had to do it,” the billionaire insists in an exclusive interview.\n\n“But, what was motivating me to stay and work to create the strategy of the company and buy other companies? It’s a desire to build, to build something. I am engineer at the end of the day, I like building things.”\n\nThe story of how Pessina ended up at the helm of the newly merged Walgreens Boots Alliance, a company employing 370,000 people, began when he struck a deal in 2012 with America’s biggest pharmacy chain to combine it with Alliance Boots in two stages.\n\nHe was due to become the executive vice-chairman in charge of strategy and M&A.However, the second stage of the agreement did not go as smoothly as anticipated. The board of Walgreens rejected Pessina’s plan to move the enlarged company’s tax base from Illinois to London through a so-called tax inversion. Although the cunning piece of financial engineering would have saved billions in tax, the directors feared it would also spark a backlash from politicians and consumers.\n\nThe rejection of the tax saving plan is thought to have been pushed by Greg Wasson, the chief executive, resulting in him clashing with Pessina – and activist shareholders who had scooped up shares in Walgreens on the back of the tie-up with its European rival led by its highly regarded boss.\n\nJust 18 days before Walgreens shareholders were due to vote on the Alliance Boots deal in December, it was announced that Wasson, a 34-year company veteran, was stepping down, to be replaced by Pessina as acting chief executive.\n\nThen, after the deal was overwhelming voted through on December 29, further changes were made. Pessina named George Fairweather, a Brit, as chief financial officer having served in the same role at Alliance Boots since 2006.\n\nNot only that, but a string of other key positions have been taken by Alliance Boots, with four of the five key divisions in the hands of Alliance Boots executives, including wholesale brands, Boots, and Walgreens itself.\n\nOnly Jeffrey Berkowitz, president of pharma and global market access, was with Walgreens before the deal.\n\n“No, and I am acting chief executive and there is a search out there. No, absolutely not,” Pessina says.\n\n“I thought that Greg could stay as chief executive. Of course we were thinking of changing certain people together with Greg, but no, I was not planning it. He added: “He has not been pushed by the board, he has not been pushed by me. One of the reasons that I have done this deal was because of the personality and let’s say level of reciprocal sympathy and understanding I had with Greg Wasson.\n\n“To be honest, he had problems with the shareholders, particularly in the US with these shareholders who are very active. It was better for him not to fight them. He left without being too tarnished. He did the right thing I believe for himself, and at the end also for the company.\n\n“When he announced he would leave immediately before the [merger] we of course had to organise something. I was probably the most experienced person on the board and I believe this is this most rational decision.”\n\n“I don’t care about managing the company,” he said. “What I want, what I care about, is steering the company towards a certain direction and to be influential, very influential, on the strategy.”\n\n“We have tried to select people for the best job and this was done before the chief executive and finance director were coming from Alliance Boots,” he insisted.\n\nPessina is adamant that the deal should not be seen as a takeover or reverse takeover. “Alliance is in the name of all the companies we are involved in and Alliance means partnership and we have to work in partnership. Today we have a lot of British people at the top of this company, in five years we could have all Americans, who knows, or maybe Canadians, or Italians, or whatever. What does it mean? The company is the company.”\n\nNone the less, it is difficult not to conclude that Pessina, who describes his own relationship with Walgreens Boots Alliance shareholders as “fantastic”, has played a blinder.\n\nEver since he left the University of Milan with a degree in nuclear engineering, Pessina has carefully constructed his path to the top.\n\nHe was persuaded by his father to take on the family pharmaceutical business in the 1970s and built it into the largest drug wholesaler in Italy. In 1997, he merged with Britain’s UniChem to form Alliance UniChem and then, in 2005, created Alliance Boots by merging with Boots. Two years later, he oversaw the biggest-ever leveraged takeover in the UK when private equity fund KKR bought out Alliance Boots with his backing.\n\nOverall, Pessina believes he has done at least 1,500 deals, so he could hardly have been more prepared for jousting with Walgreens. He is thought to be the richest man in Monaco, where he has lived for 30 years.\n\nDespite now being in control, he insists the tax inversion plan will not be reignited due to changes in US law and because the company would struggle to meet the conditions needed to move its tax base.\n\n“Everybody knows that I was in favour of the inversion. I am not upset or unhappy just because the board decided differently. I accept it and carry on.”\n\nPessina insisted the decision would have no bearing on the company’s commitment to the UK, where it employs 70,000 people across 2,511 Boots stores and has a key research and development base in Nottingham.\n\n“If we were based in London, the commitment to Walgreens in the US would not have changed. We have to improve the assets wherever the assets are. I have to tell you, when we made the agreement [with Walgreens], we made clear that Nottingham would stay as the centre of R&D for the new company.”\n\nThe commitment to Nottingham was “forever, for long term”, he added, and the site will be boosted by supplying products to Walgreens stores in the US as well.\n\n“I don’t understand how people can just imagine that whoever is in charge could take a decision which could damage Boots,” Pessina said. “It’s surreal just to think of it. Our business is really the pharmacies, the stores of Walgreens and Boots, our brands, and our distribution network. These are the four assets of this company.\n\n“All the rest is there just to serve these assets, including the management team and the chief executive.”\n\nThose will be welcome words for the 70,000 UK staff employed by the enlarged company who must already feel boosted by the fact that Pessina, their former boss, is going to be in charge.\n\nPessina describes Boots as being “part of the heritage of this great country” and has overseen the growth of the retailer through a troubled period for the high street and the economy. Pessina won’t admit it, but the appointment of Alliance Boots executives into key roles suggests that Walgreens has a lot to learn from its European partner.\n\n“If we exchange our know-how and we try to make the most of what we have learnt in well over 100 years of existence for the company, we can improve both businesses, particularly Walgreens,” Pessina explains. “Boots has gone [through] a phase of rejuvenation, revitalisation, Walgreens is just starting this journey, so the effect will probably be more evident in Walgreens.”"
