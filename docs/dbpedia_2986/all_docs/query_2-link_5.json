        "text": "FRIDAY WRAP | 03.03.23\n\nStory of the Week: Fox News election fraud revelations could take down the network's embattled chief\n\nGoodliest of the Week: U.S. regulators rejected Elon Musk‚Äôs bid to test brain chips in humans, citing safety risks\n\nAssholiest of the Week: Steve Toth\n\nTexas Republican wants ISPs to block a wide range of abortion websites\n\nToth is on a roll. He is authoring bills on a variety of fronts: violating trans rights, requiring partisan membership on school boards, requiring in-person attendance on home equity loans, prohibiting business institutions from having values‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs just this year!\n\nExhaustingest of the Week: Excessive online shopping IS KILLING OUR WHALES\n\nBOARD SABERMETRICS STORY OF THE WEEK‚Ä¶\n\nDO YOU KNOW WHO ACTUALLY CONTROLS WALGREENS?\n\nOver the weekend, our team stumbled across this headline: Walgreens won‚Äôt sell abortion pills in these states even though abortion is legal there. While most headlines no longer surprise us, this one did because Walgreens is one of the few Fortune 500 companies that is led by a woman, Rosalind Brewer. This headline piqued our curiosity about how much power Brewer actually has as CEO.\n\nIt turns out that the executive chair, largest shareholder, and former CEO of Walgreens is Stefano Pessina. In 1977, Pessina took over a family pharmaceutical wholesaler, which he later named Alliance Sant√©. About thirty years later, Alliance Sant√© merged with Boots Group, creating Alliance Boots. Pessina took Alliance Boots private in 2007 with a $22B deal. In 2014, Walgreens bought Alliance Boots, creating the new entity we know today, Walgreens Boots Alliance.\n\nAs Walgreens‚Äôs executive chair and its largest shareholder, currently, at 17% of shares, Pessina is effectively a founder of the company. Not to mention, Pessina is married to Walgreens‚Äôs Chief Operating Officer, Ornella Barra. Interestingly, neither of their official biographies on the Walgreens website mentions this relationship.\n\nOf course, now that we‚Äôve done the research, we wanted to uncover exactly how influential Stefano Pessina is on the company‚Äôs board. Diving into the Board Sabermetrics data, our team discovered that Pessina has 64% of the total influence at Walgreens, while CEO Rosalind Brewer has a measly 10% influence.\n\nTL;DR: Walgreens Boots Alliance is Stefano Pessina‚Äôs company. Not only does he control the influence on the board, but he is married to one of the leading operations executives and living the highlife in their Monte Carlo mansion. üí•\n\nAre you looking for comprehensive data from which to glean powerful insights? Check out Board Sabermetrics today!\n\nüö® NERD ALERT üö®\n\nDo women on the board of directors reduce corporate bad behavior?\n\nThis study examines the impact of gender diversity on corporate obedience in a sample of 660 public corporations, and finds that gender diversity has a substantial positive impact on corporate compliance. Notably, every one percent increase in female representation on the board is associated with at least a four percent decrease in the probability that the corporation will be associated with a violation of the law.\n\nMEANWHILE, ON STAGE‚Ä¶\n\nThe Walt Disney Company‚Äôs Jiminy Cricket writes an open letter to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.\n\n‚ÄúWhen I think of how Mr. Walt Disney himself would react to DeSantis and his policies, it makes me want to defrost the old man myself and turn him loose on the go-go boot-wearing fraud‚Ä¶\n\nListen, I know that the Disney Company is not perfect and never has been. Like every company, it‚Äôs had its share of great achievements and embarrassing blunders. Yeah, I‚Äôm looking at you Song of the South! But at least they‚Äôre putting out fairly progressive material dealing with diversity and inclusivity. They‚Äôre showing kids that it‚Äôs 100% A-OK to be you, and the world is not just full of White, heterosexual suburban Mickey Mouse Club-like drones, pardon the irony. Besides, they must be doing something right to make these self-appointed guardians of virtue so upset. To bully a company with vengeful laws just because that company doesn‚Äôt agree with your warped concept of family values is just flat-out wrong. And to think that you can control and manipulate artistic expression‚Äîthat‚Äôs just downright evil.‚Äù\n\nCAN‚ÄôT GET ENOUGH ESG?"
