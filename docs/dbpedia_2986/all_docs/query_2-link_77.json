        "text": "Class war is so last century. New Labour made a decision in 1997 to jettison the politics of envy and, make no mistake, that is a good thing. Our economy would not now be outperforming the eurozone and the City would not have overtaken New York as the planet's premier financial centre if we were still attempting to levy a top tax rate of 83 per cent.\n\nBut when the UK is identified in an IMF working paper - alongside Latvia and Uruguay - as an offshore tax haven, catering to an extensive foreign clientele, we are entitled to wonder whether it has gone too far. Gordon Brown has been reviewing the status of 'non-domiciles', such as Roman Abramovich, Lakshmi Mittal and scores of less famous but seriously rich City bankers, for several years, to little effect.\n\nIt is possible for someone who is foreign-born to claim non-domicile status, even if they spend most of their time in Britain, have a British passport and, in some cases, play a very important role in our national life. The upshot is that London has the largest community of non-domiciled tycoons in the world. A leading player in the Monaco community told me the principality is worried about losing out to London, though it is still graced by wealthy Brits such as Sir Philip Green's wife Tina.\n\nThere is no list of those with non-domicile status on the grounds that it is a private matter between an individual and the tax authorities. The only way to know for certain is if someone outs themselves or their spouse, as Formula One tycoon Bernie Ecclestone did when he said he had transferred shares to his wife Slavica, who was domiciled abroad.\n\nWho knows how many others benefit from the rules? American-born Bob Diamond, Barclays' star investment banker, might qualify, as might Gordon Brown's key adviser, Sir Ronnie Cohen, who came here from Egypt as a child.\n\nJohn Jay, a director of fund manager New Star, makes an eloquent case (on page 4) for why we should embrace wealthy non-doms as a good thing. There are no Treasury figures showing how much they contribute in terms of job creation and spending, though their presence has undeniably helped create a cluster of talent and boosted the City.\n\nThe problem is one of perceived unfairness, as people have seen taxes increase, and of widening inequality. The capital is becoming a city state detached from the rest of the UK, and the divisions within London itself are becoming starker. The danger is that we create an enclave economy with the super-rich behind gilded fortress gates.\n\nIt is often claimed that the non-doms would defect en masse if their tax treatment were tightened, but that's not a foregone conclusion. London has other advantages, including a fabulous cultural life, easy access to air transport, a convenient time zone and the English language, the lingua franca of business. It would take years for rival financial centres to build up the expertise and standing of the City. And where would they go - apart from the Republic of Ireland? No comparable developed nation offers the same concessions.\n\nThe popular image of a tax haven is one of lax regulation and dodgy money. We like to think this is not true of Britain, but if a country comes to rely on footloose tycoons for its prosperity, the incentives are there to lower standards.\n\nIt would be wrong to blame individuals for taking advantage of perfectly legal loopholes, but it is legitimate to question the wisdom of the rules, especially when they risk undermining faith in a fair tax system. Do we really want Britain to be the tax asylum-seeker's destination of choice?\n\nBattle of Boots descends into panto, but who will be booed off the stage?\n\nMuch of the fun in a takeover battle is the verbal onslaught one side hurls at the other. This takes on a particularly piquant flavour when you have two private equity bidders slugging it out for a target, as with the competing bids from KKR and Guy Hands for Alliance Boots. 'You're great big asset strippers!' 'Oh no we're not, you are.' It's the City version of panto, eight months early.\n\nThe intervention of Guy Hands in partnership with HBOS and the Wellcome Trust, is good news for the Boots chairman Sir Nigel Rudd (pictured). He and other non-executives were in an awkward position when presented with an offer from KKR and Stefano Pessina, the company's executive deputy chairman and biggest shareholder, who was threatening to leave if thwarted. Hands has ratcheted the price up. That absolves Rudd of some of the suspicion he might sell out on the cheap in a cosy boardroom deal.\n\nBut it would still be uncomfortable for Rudd, who had last week pledged his shares to Pessina, if Guy Hands and Wellcome turned out to be the fight's winners.\n\nThere is the scent of fear within the Boots board at the prospect of Hands succeeding. This is not allayed by the presence of the Wellcome Trust - although it is a charitable foundation, its investments are run by a hard-nosed former Goldman Sachs banker, Danny Truell. The worries centre on Hands's mixed success rate and his plans for Boots, which have not yet been spelt out. Hands has ruffled feathers by making it clear he considers current management, including Pessina and his girlfriend Ornella Barra, to be replaceable. The concern, though his supporters deny it, is that a victory for Hands could involve a carve-up of assets, which is not the legacy that Rudd wants to leave.\n\nWe should not forget that whoever wins, Boots will be the first FTSE 100 firm to disappear into private equity hands. We will watch the stores for any slippage in service, prices and products. The board not only has a duty to shareholders, but also to 100,000 staff and millions of customers."
