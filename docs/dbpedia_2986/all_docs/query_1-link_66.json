        "text": "Alliance Boots yesterday rejected the tentative £9.7bn offer from its deputy chairman Stefano Pessina and his private equity backers Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.\n\nIn a statement, issued after a five-hour board meeting, the company said the approach had failed to reflect the \"fundamental value\" of the business. The board also said it had not fully appreciated the potential benefits of the recently completed merger of Boots and Alliance Unichem. The meeting, led by Boots chairman and City grandee Sir Nigel Rudd, was held without Mr Pessina or his long-term partner Ornella Barra, the group's wholesale and commercial affairs director.\n\nMr Pessina and KKR had no immediate response. But one leading shareholder said the rejection had placed Mr Pessina in a tough corner. \"Clearly we are into the ritual language that you have to use in these situations. By rejecting the offer they've put Stefano Pessina into a very difficult position. He has to convince KKR to increase the offer. If KKR say we are going hostile, Stefano Pessina would have to resign and so would Ornella Barra. Similarly, if KKR walk away, Stefano Pessina will also have to resign. He cannot continue as a director having tried to action a bid on the QT. Nigel Rudd is playing a good hand here. He thinks he can get more. Now they have to put up or shut up.\"\n\nThe takeover approach disclosed late on Friday took most in the City by surprise, as well, apparently, as the rest of the Alliance Boots board. It is less than eight months since Mr Pessina completed the merger of his Alliance Unichem business with Boots, leaving him as the largest shareholder with a 15% stake. If successful, it would the largest private equity-backed buyout of a European company to date.\n\nAnalysts had broadly described the offer, pitched at £10 a share, as a good price, although many had suggested the board might be expected to squeeze a little more from the 65-year-old Italian and his American backers. The shares closed 66.5p higher yesterday at 996.5p.\n\n\"I'm surprised, but then I'm not surprised,\" said Richard Ratner at Seymour Pierce. \"The board will have been under some pressure not to accept the first thing from an inside offer but it is a bloody good price. It is likely they are trying to force the price up so they can do a volte face with honour. I don't think this is over.\"\n\nSam Hart at Charles Stanley said the offer had been \"fairly generous\". \"Clearly the company is under the obligation to act for all shareholders. They especially can't be seen to be disregarding the long-term interests of the other shareholders just because the deputy chairman is involved in a bid. The fact that he did this so soon after the merger does raise one or two questions and one or two eyebrows.\"\n\nMr Pessina had pitched the offer as a \"friendly approach\" and said he intended to keep current management, including chief executive Richard Baker, in place.\n\nAnother shareholder said there was a case for locking Mr Baker out of any discussions, suggesting that he was conflicted because Mr Pessina wanted him to stay on. Mr Baker and the other directors have a strong financial incentive to accept a takeover offer as share options would vest, handing them windfalls and stakes in the new business. Mr Baker stands to make £1.3m from his options at the proposed take-out price.\n\nInsiders at Alliance Boots sought to downplay any rift between the board and Mr Pessina, who began talking to KKR in January. \"I don't think anyone thinks he has behaved in an underhand manner. The board share some of his frustrations. They are trying to get the merger completed and are having to focus on next quarter's like-for-like sales figures.\"\n\nMr Pessina turned his family's struggling Naples drug wholesaler into one of the largest pharmaceutical firms in Europe over three decades. \"His whole career has been about growth and you can understand that KKR might see a decent return in it,\" said one City observer."
