        "text": "In its report for the year ending March 2010, the company said it had continued to concentrate its efforts in four key areas : Community, environment, marketplace and workplace.\n\n“Corporate social responsibility is an everyday commitment and truly embedded in our philosophy across the group’s business,”​ said Ornella Barra, chairman of the social responsibilities committee for Boots Alliance.\n\n“We continue to pursue our investment in the agenda and I have every confidence that we are on track to build a world-leading sustainable group, with a strong corporate responsibility culture that others will strive to emulate.”​\n\nThe report is divided into the four principle areas the company is targeting on CSR, highlighting some of the principle achievements during the year.\n\nCommunity focus​\n\nFor its community focus, the company stressed its charity partnership with Macmillan Cancer Support, as well as highlighting its participation in the annual Business in the Community Corporate Responsibility index.\n\nWith respect to the environment, key achievements included the Carbon Trust Standard award, which recognized achievements including the reduction of the company’s carbon footprint.\n\nThe company says that over the past year it has managed to continue to reduce its carbon footprint through initiatives such as minimizing staff travel, particularly medium- to long-haul air flights, which have been increasingly replaced by webcasting and video conferencing facilities.\n\nReduction in carbon footprint​\n\nFurther reductions in the carbon footprint have also been achieved through a major reorganization of the company’s supply chain, especially the introduction of a new automated distribution facility at its Nottingham manufacturing base.\n\nWith respect to the marketplace, the report highlights a clinical study by the University of Manchester, highlighting the long-term anti-ageing benefits of its No. 7 Protect & Perfect Intense Beauty Serum.\n\nFinally, in the workplace, the report highlighted initiatives including the progress of the company’s e-learning courses for staff, an initiative introduced by Boots Norge targeting its pre-management academy for pharmacists, together with a programme to provide internships at its Depolabo distribution centre in Angers."
