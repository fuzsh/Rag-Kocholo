As she prepares for her new job as President of the San Francisco Bay Market for Sutter Health, following are some of the most impactful lessons I learned from her: 1. Asking someone their name is good manners. Remembering it is transformational. 2. Creating a workplace environment where colleagues have a voice and a future is an investment in the future. 3. Like a major league baseball team, always look for the next generation of leaders who can be encouraged, developed and promoted. 4. Individual and group commitments and accountability are critical to creating a unified team of leaders. 5. By honoring an uncompromising commitment to each patient, it’s possible to consistently deliver high quality, compassionate care to a large patient population that is increasingly in need of complex medical care. Christina leaves Trident in good hands. As a result of her leadership, we’ll continue her vision of expanding access to high quality, compassionate care throughout South Carolina’s Lowcountry and beyond. #hcahealthare #sutterhealth #integrity #leader\n\nThe Senior Executives Association released a statement on the Presidential Rank Award winners.

Staffing changes typically have less to do with the individual and more with the job that needs to be done. Sometimes, the best thing you can do for your organization is to replace a good employee with an employee who better fits your goals. While challenging, this can be a good thing for employees because it allows them to find an opportunity to utilize their skills and potential better. I look forward to seeing where Rosalind will land. Wherever it is, I anticipate her making a positive impact. #pivot #leadership #transition #resilience https://lnkd.in/ewBhXVis\n\nHappy Mother's Day to all the amazing moms out there!
