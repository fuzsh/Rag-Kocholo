        "text": "The past week has not been kind to Stefano Pessina, the deputy chairman of Alliance Boots of Britani. While he and a partner, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, are expected to raise the 9.7 billion pound ($18.8 billion) bid that his company rejected last month, rival suitors came into the picture. Then he was reportedly banned from the health and beauty store’s central office.\n\nCiting unnamed sources, the Telegraph reported that the Blackstone Group has been studying a possible counterbid and has approached potential advisers about a bid for the drugstore chain. Earlier this week, reports said that the British investor Guy Hands was studying making his own approach.\n\nThe news arrived as the company banned Mr. Pessina from its central London head office. The Guardian said that the billionaire has been told he can continue with his work but cannot enter Alliance Boots’ Sedley Place office off Oxford Street.\n\nThe ban reportedly also applies to Mr. Pessina’s partner and fellow board director, Ornella Barra. Ms. Barra has links to the trust that holds Mr. Pessina’s shares.\n\nRichard Baker, chief executive of Alliance Boots, told shareholders Wednesday that the company was on track to “deliver full-year results in line with management’s targets.”"
