        "text": "The US owner of Boots could be taken off the stock market with help from private equity titan KKR in what would be the biggest-ever buyout deal.\n\nKKR has reportedly put forward a formal proposal to buy out Walgreens Boots Alliance’s shareholders, making the two firms bedfellows for a second time.\n\nPharmaceutical company Walgreens is known to be exploring a $70bn (£54bn) take-private deal, although there is no guarantee that a tie-up with KKR would get approval from its investors.\n\nWalgreens, which is worth $56bn and has $18.6bn of debt, saw profits fall by almost 10pc last in the three months to August - primarily because of its lacklustre performance in the UK.\n\nThe company plans to save $1.8bn a year by the end of 2022. It is shutting stores on both sides of the Atlantic, with 200 sites due to close in Britain.\n\nIt has been struggling with increasing competition from the likes of Amazon’s PillPack and Pharmacy2U, as well as supermarkets and niche websites.\n\nStefano Pessina, Walgreens’ chief executive and founder, has been working with financial advisers amid buyout interest.\n\nA successful deal would shock industry observers, who have said it is unlikely to happen and would involve unprecedented mountains of debt."
