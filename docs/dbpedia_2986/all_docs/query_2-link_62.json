        "text": "Over his lifetime as a health industry magnate, Stefano Pessina says he has completed more than 1,000 acquisitions — and is now adding Rite Aid to his Walgreens-Boots empire.\n\nAnd at 74, he is still not finished.\n\nThough “consolidation is close to an end” in the United States, Mr. Pessina said in an interview on Wednesday, “we are still willing to make acquisitions in Europe or Asia or anywhere else.”\n\nHe added: “To be honest, if we’d had the opportunity to buy something somewhere else instead of buying Rite Aid, we’d have done it. But the U.S. market is just so important, so dynamic, so irrational and expensive. The need for consolidation, and the need for reducing costs, is much stronger here than in other parts of the world.”\n\nWalgreens’s $9.4 billion purchase of Rite Aid, if approved by regulators looking at antitrust issues, would result in the biggest retail pharmacy chain in the United States, and in a global drugstore behemoth with estimated combined revenue of almost $150 billion."
