        "text": "25= Alan Hardy - £55m (new entry)\n\nAlan Hardy has been called a serial entrepreneur. He’s certainly a successful one and has also become a collector of football clubs.\n\nAt the beginning of this year he acquired the world’s oldest football club, the 155 year-old Notts County. And in the summer he completed the purchase of Ilkeston FC from the liquidator, reverting back to the club’s original name of Ilkeston Town FC.\n\nThe purchase of League Two Notts County was a knife-edge affair, held up by a dispute over a £1.5 million loan owed to the trustees of the Haydn Green Estate. However it was resolved and the acquisition went through.\n\nThe Magpies maintained their place in the Football League last season and are well placed to go up this season. There’s still a lot of financial work to do though, with Alan Hardy revealing the club is losing £1.6 million a year. A League One slot would certainly help that.\n\nAlan Hardy has put ex-Nottingham Forest legend Steve Chettle as Ilkeston Town’s manager. The Robins are sitting close to the top of the Midlands Football League division one.\n\nAlan Hardy, 53, runs Nottingham-based Paragon interiors, which he has built into a £50 million turnover business. He has plans to further expand the interior design business. He has opened a Birmingham office and is looking to break the £100 million turnover barrier by 2020.\n\nHe appointed ex CBRE property consultant Gary Perry as chief executive at the beginning of the year. Paragon counts Jaguar Land Rover, O2, Adidas and RBS among its blue-chip customer base. In 2016 Paragon was named in the London Stock Exchange’s “1,000 Companies to Inspire Britain” report, and he hasn’t ruled out a flotation.\n\nParagon turned over £54 million in 2016, with a pre-tax profit of almost £3 million. It reported net assets in excess of £8 million.\n\nHe also owns The Nottinghamshire Golf and Country Club - formerly Cotgrave Golf Club - which he acquired from owners Crown in 2011. As well as a 1,000-member golf club he has built up the weddings and corporate side of the operation, and has created a 25-room boutique hotel. The club hosts more than 100 weddings a year.\n\nHe also owns a 50 per cent stake in golf clothing operation Bunker Mentality which was founded by Nottinghamshire-based Robert Hart and Tamasine Green.\n\nHe also has a property business specialising in creating convenience stores for supermarket companies.\n\nA summary of the Nottinghamshire Rich List 2017\n\nSo there we have it - the 40 wealthiest people (and their families) in the county are ranked below. Before we wrap up, Ian Strachan reflects on what this year’s Rich List tells us about Nottinghamshire’s economy and individual wealth.\n\nForget all the talk of the Brexit impact or economic uncertainty. If you’re at the top of the wealth pile things are going pretty well. The richest people in Nottinghamshire have increased their combined fortunes and are heading towards the £20 billion mark according to the 2017 Nottingham Post Rich List.\n\nThere’s winners and losers of course, but those involved in construction, property, manufacturing and automtive have all seen an increase in their wealth over the last year, or at the very least they have protected their position. One of our biggest winners is John Kirkland and family whose Bowmer and Kirkland construction business is posting growing profits.\n\nRetail is struggling nationwide as life on the high street gets tougher and the online/offline battle between bricks and clicks continues. But some of our Nottinghamshire retailers are bucking the trend. Trevor Finn’s Pendragon automotive group is growing, as is Sir Paul and Lady Smith’s fashion business.\n\nThe entrepreneurship of Nottinghamshire people and the hard work and determination of those who were born here or have chosen to make our county their home have combined to ensure that the money keeps rolling in for the county’s wealthiest individuals and families.\n\nFor many on our list, life has been a story of risk-taking and a desire to better themselves. Many came from a humble background, but have used their talents, combined with hard work, to join the exclusive club of multi-millionaires. Many started life toiling in the mines and the markets, but have fought their way outwards and upwards.\n\nIn fact only two people in our league table of the 40 super-rich has inherited their fortune through ancestral accident. This list is a story of entrepreneurs who, through extraordinary talent, a great idea, or hard work have reaped the reward of enviable wealth.\n\nAnother striking feature which crops up year after year is philanthropy, with most on our list giving generously to charities and good causes, much of it locally. Carphone Warehouse founder David Ross and textiles millionaire Sir Harry Djanogly secure their places thanks to their extraordinary generosity in the city of Nottingham, with many institutions benefiting from their help.\n\nThe amassed fortunes of our richest 40 add to up to a remarkable total of £19,219 billion, which is an increase on last year. The region again has its trio of billionaires - Stefano Pessina, Mike Ashley and Tony Langley.\n\nProperty remains the biggest source of wealth, either building it, investing in it or selling it. Peter Gadsby, John Kirkland, George Akins and Gary Dutton have all rich via property investment or construction. Tony Langley and Nat Puri fly the flag for manufacturing.\n\nIt is clear too that we live in a part of the world which fosters creativity. Robert Harris, Bruce Dickinson and Ian Paice all began their creative journeys breathing Nottinghamshire air.\n\nThe entry price for making the list is high. You’ll need a personal fortune of at least £18 million to qualify for a place.\n\nWe have some new entrants this year - the highest being the new owner of Nottingham Forest, Evangelos Marinakis. Plant hire and traffic management millionaire Harols Martin and Newark-based animal renerer Jeffrey Pears make the list, as does Notts County and Paragon Interiors owner Alan Hardy.\n\nAgain there are few women in our list. Judy Naake is listed in her own right, while Lady Smith and Cassie Topham are jointly listed. However it is fair to say that many have made their fortunes with the indispensable help of wives and partners.\n\n1. Stefano Pessina - £10.6 billion\n\n2016 ranking: 1\n\n2016 worth: £9.5 billion\n\nFormer nuclear engineer Stefano Pessina has big plans for Boots. Having turned the 170 year-old company name into a global brand, his ambition is to conquer the huge market in China.\n\nStefano Pessina is executive vice-chairman, chief executive officer and the largest single shareholder of the biggest health and beauty chain in the UK and Nottingham’s biggest employer.\n\nHe has no illusions that cracking China wouldn’t be easy, but it remains one of the 76 year-old’s declared ambitions.\n\nHe was born in Pescara on the east coast of Italy, and has been resident in Monaco for more than 30 years. He is the largest shareholder in Chicago-based retail pharmacy chain Walgreens, who took over Beeston-based Boots on the last day of 2014.\n\nHaving trained as an engineer, he left the academic world, where he disagreed with the left wing politics of the university campus. He joined the family pharmaceutical wholesale business – Alliance Santé - in 1977.\n\nHe developed the company and oversaw its growth, with a vision of a multi-national pharmacy-led health and well-being enterprise. In 1997 it merged with Unichem and became Alliance Unichem. He joined its board of directors and became chief executive and then executive chairman.\n\nIn 2006 Alliance Unichem joined forces with Boots in a merger led by Stefano Pessina. A year later he took the merged Alliance Boots private in an £11 billion deal backed by private equity firm KKR. It was the first ever private-equity backed acquisition of a FTSE 100 company.\n\nIn 2012 US-based Walgreens took a 45 per cent stake in the company with an option to acquire the remainder. That option was taken up and Walgreens Boots Alliance was born – a global giant operating in 30 countries worldwide and employing 370,000 people, more than 2,500 of them in Nottingham. Stefano Pessina owns 15 per cent of company. He also sits on the board of Swiss healthcare company Galencia.\n\nIt’s a far cry from the day in 1849 when John Boot opened his first herbalists store in Goose Gate. Now Boots operates from a 280-acre site on which important listed buildings sit side by side with state-of-the-art technology in the Nottingham Enterprise Zone.\n\nThe site was acquired by Boots in 1927 and it is where the anti-inflammatory drug Ibuprofen was invented. Despite its international presence Boots remains firmly rooted in Nottingham.\n\nBoots has 2,500 stores across the UK and more than 90 per cent of the UK population is within 10 minutes of a Boots outlet. The merged group is the world’s largest purchaser of prescription drugs, with a global distribution and wholesale operation supported by a worldwide network of 350 distribution centres delivering to more than 200,000 pharmacies.\n\nCompetition from supermarkets has resulted in job losses and cost-cutting exercises in recent years, but the business remains robust. The Nottingham-based beauty contract manufacturing business is being taken over by French company Fareva, but with a 10-year contract to supply Boots.\n\nStefano Pessina’s long term partner is Italian-born pharmacist and businesswoman Ornella Barra who is also on the board of Walgreens Boots Alliance. In 2016 she was appointed co-chief operating officer.\n\n2. Mike Ashley - £2.1 billion\n\n2016 ranking: 2\n\n2016 worth: £2.4 billion\n\nMike Ashley’s Sports Direct is still splashing the cash, despite taking a big post-Brexit referendum hit from currency woes on several fronts. The devaluation of the euro against the US dollar took its toll when the company’s hedging position expired in April.\n\nThe firm has also taken a further big hit linked to the fall in sterling, resulting in a 60 per cent drop in underlying profits.\n\nThat, combined with a tough trading environment for most high street retailers which has hit Shirebrook-based Sports Direct’s bottom line, has meant a roller-coaster ride for the company’s shareholders.\n\nBut despite this Mike Ashley still found time and a reported £25 million to splash out on lingerie firm Agent Provocateur. He saw off competition to buy the business out of administration, and acquired the struggling company in a pre-pack deal. Agent Provocateur has 10 stores in the UK and employs 600 people. Sports Direct has also increased its stake in department store Debenhams to 21 per cent.\n\nSports Direct has also agreed a deal to buy Eastern Outfitters, the US parent of discount chain Bob’s Stores and outdoor retailer Eastern Mountain Sports for almost £80 million. It has also taken a major stake in Game Digital.\n\nMeanwhile he has invested £300 million in property to open new flagship stores which he intends to be “the Selfridges of sport” and this strategy is showing early signs of success.\n\nTwo years of criticism about the business’s working practices haven’t helped the operation on the Nottinghamshire-Derbyshire border, with the business select committee describing conditions as being like “a Victorian workhouse.\n\nMike Ashley, who owns 50 per cent of the business, wasn’t slow to take action to tackle the issues raised. His workers are receiving about £1 million in back-pay for non-payment of the minimum wage and he plans to scrap zero-hours contracts. An independent review is looking at all aspects of working practices including conditions in the firm’s warehouse, and a workers’ representative now sits in on board meetings.\n\nManaging his other significant business interest - Newcastle United FC - is also a challenging business - so much so that he has put it on the market for around £400 million. It is said that interest has come from Japan, America and the Middle East\n\nThings took a dive at the Magpies when they lost their relegation battle in the 2015-16 season despite an investment of £82 million in the squad. Rafael Benitez was brought in as manager to sort things out, replacing the sacked Steve McClaren and the team is back in the Premiership despite a stuttering end to the season.\n\nMeanwhile Mike Ashley is on record as saying he wishes he had never bought the club, despite bankrolling it to the tune of £300 million. He says the bank account is empty.\n\nHopefully recent success will fill it up again, although he might not be around for much longer after financier Amanda Staveley reportedly made a £300 million bid on behalf of investment vehicle PCP Capital Partners last week.\n\nMike Ashley, 53, began Sports Direct 1n 1982 with a £10,000 loan from his parents and a single store in Maidenhead. Today, the company is the UK’s leading sports retailer with more than 420 stores across the country. Around 20 per cent of the firm’s revenue is earned from its online business.\n\nMike Ashley’s MASH Holdings Group, through which he owns his stake in Sports Direct as well as Newcastle United FC, received a profits boost through two share disposal deals in 2014 which netted £283 million. In January 2015 Mike Ashley disposed of a 2.57 per cent stake for £117 million in a deal with US bank Goldman Sachs.\n\nSports Direct was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 2007, earning Mike Ashley £929 million in a single day.\n\nThe company, now valued at around £1.8 million, is busy building up its international presence, and has 270 stores in 19 European countries. Its strategy is to continue to expand internationally including the US. Much of its overseas expansion has been through acquisitions. The firm’s brand portfolio features most globally-known sports and lifestyle brands. Its headquarters acts as a test bed to trial and develop the presentation of goods in its stores.\n\nBuckinghamshire-born Mike Ashley also has stakes in JD Sports, Tesco, Debenhams and MySale. As well as owning Newcastle United he has a nine per cent stake in Glasgow Rangers. He has helped the Scottish club’s perilous financial position by entering into a £10 million long term credit agreement.\n\nHe also has property interests. He is the financial muscle behind a deal to build homes worth £900 million in one of the most expensive parts of London. He purchased a prime development site in Chelsea from John Lewis. The site near the King’s Road is a stone’s throw from the Qatari-owned Chelsea Barracks.\n\nHe has had other high-end property interests in Majorca, Miami and Switzerland.\n\n3. Tony Langley - £1.3 billion\n\n2016 ranking: 3\n\n2016 worth: £1.15 billion\n\nTony Langley’s Retford-based Langley Holdings continues to boost its profits and revenue as the broad-based international engineering group has reported another successful year.\n\nTony Langley started in business in 1975 aged just 20. He began by taking orders for a company owned by his grandfather. He taught himself engineering while running a company making a wide range of machinery from electrical systems for data centres, food packaging lines, welding equipment, dockside cranes, printing presses and materials handling equipment for the quarrying industry.\n\nIn 2016 Langley Holdings increased profits to £104 million on sales of £766 million. The company is worth over £1.2 billion pounds, with half a billion in net assets.\n\nTony Langley’s youngest son William, aged 21, is MD of the company’s cement products division while his eldest son Bernard, 24, who runs the house-building operation sits on the main board. His father John stepped down from the board aged 85.\n\nLangley Holdings - with more than 80 subsidiaries - has a raft of companies under its umbrella. Its operations include the production of components for the automotive industry, producing parts for Airbus wings, and supplying back-up power for data centres. In 2012 Langley Holdings bought the sheet-fed operations of giant German printing press company Manroland Sheetfed out of insolvency for just under £140 million. That deal almost doubled the size of his business empire, and Langley Holdings now employs 4,300 people worldwide. Some land in Germany owned by Manroland is being used to house Syrian refugees.\n\nTony Langley is chairman and chief executive of Langley Holdings. The company’s worldwide manufacturing and commercial operations occupy more than two million sq ft. More than half of this is in Germany. Power supply systems group Piller has been part of the Langley empire since 2004 and is the principal driver of the group’s improved profitability. Claudius Peters GmBH, a leading supplier of materials handling and process equipment, joined the group in 2001.\n\nIn 2014 the group acquired German print chemicals company Druck Chemie, while Manroland Sheetfed opened a subsidiary in India.\n\nThe group is made up of five divisions based in Germany, France and the UK, with subsidiaries in the Americas, the Far East, Europe and Australasia. Other businesses include housebuilder Oakdale Homes and LPG vehicle manufacturer Protran.\n\nTony Langley, aged 63, has other assets and owns a racing yacht – Gladiator. Sailing is his passion, and Gladiator competes in the grand prix 52 Super Series, the world’s foremost mono-hull yacht racing circuit. Gladiator competes all over the world including at events in Sardinia, Majorca, Florida and Barcelona. He also has a helicopter and a twin-engined jet.\n\n4. David Ross - £850m\n\n2016 ranking: 5\n\n2016 worth: £920m\n\nCarphone Warehouse co-founder David Ross, who gets into the Nottingham Rich List thanks to his enormous generosity to the city’s institutions, has seen his shares in the Dixons Carphone business drop this year. But he’s still worth close to a billion pounds.\n\nOriginally from a fishing family in Grimsby, he attended the University of Nottingham where he obtained a law degree before qualifying as a chartered accountant with Arthur Anderson and Co.\n\nHe has not forgotten his alma mater and has become one of the largest donors to the university. He also sits on the University Council.\n\nHe was the major funder for the £40 million David Ross Sports Village being developed on the University of Nottingham’s Park Campus, providing all of its sports teams and clubs with a wide range of facilities. The complex includes a sports hall, a 200-station fitness suite, dance studios, martial arts dojo, squash courts and sports science facilities.\n\nPassionate about education and the opportunities it offers, he set up the David Ross Foundation which, among other educational inititiaves, supports the Nottingham Potential programme which aims to help less-advantaged young people achieve their academic potential through programmes at Nottingham University. The programme received a £2.1 million donation from the Foundation.\n\nThe David Ross Education Trust provides funding and expertise to more than 30 academies across the East Midlands, providing education opportunities to more than 9,000 young people.\n\nHe has been appointed chairman of the National Portrait Gallery with a brief to boost the gallery’s standing as the world’s leading centre for portraiture.\n\nDavid Ross, 52, built up the Carphone Warehouse mobile phone chain in the early 1990s with former school friend from Uppingham Sir Charles Dunstone, He became the group’s chief operating officer and later deputy chairman.\n\nAfter it de-merged its Talk Talk broadband and telecoms operation it merged with Dixons in 2014 to form Dixons Carphone. David Ross has shares in the business worth more than £350 million. He also has a substantial property portfolio, including homes in London and Switzerland and the Nevill Holt estate in Leicestershire, and a villa on the Caribbean island of Mustique.\n\nHe has sat on the boards of several other companies including National Express, Big Yellow Group, Wembley Stadium and Trinity Mirror. He has also been a member of Sport England, and the Home Office Audit Committee, and is a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery. His family is part of the Ross frozen food dynasty.\n\nA shooting enthusiast, he once spent £22 million on two grouse moors in Yorkshire.\n\n5. Evangelos Marinakis - £700m (new entry)\n\nNottingham Forest’s former owner Fawaz Al Hasawi wrote off loans of nearly £18 million before selling the club to its current majority shareholder - Greek shipping magnate Evangelos Marinakis.\n\nThe new owner enters the fray with a promise to keep Nottingham Forest firmly embedded in English football and a commitment to support manager Mark Warburton and the team as they strive for promotion to the Premier League.\n\nEvangelos Marinakis, 50, took over in May through an English-registered company NF Football Investments, in a £50 million deal. One of the country’s leading sports lawyers, Nicholas Randall QC, was installed as chairman. The aim was to ensure transparency and good governance, something the new owner was keen to demonstrate in order to allay fears emanating from allegations of match-fixing - vigorously denied - in Greece. He was cleared of match-fixing in 2015 but other allegations persist.\n\nEvangelos Marinakis is a Greek ship owner and owner of Olympiacos football club in Greece. Founded in 1925, Olympiacos is the biggest and most successful club in Greek football history having won 44 league titles, 27 Greek Cups and four Greek Super Cups. They were league champions lasts season for the seventh time in a row. They are listed in the top 25 clubs in Europe.\n\nNow he plans to bring that kind of success to Nottingham Forest, saying he wants to bring the club back to the “glory days” and rekindle past success.\n\nSuccess is something he is used to outside the world of football. He is chairman of Capital Maritime and Trading Corporation, a major shareholder of Capital Product Partners and owner of Alter Ego Media. He is active in other family-owned businesses, all related to shipping. He is also a member of Piraeus City Council.\n\nHe has close ties to England, having lived in Watford as a teenager.

He has a yacht - Amore Mio II.\n\nHe is married to Athanasia and has three children.\n\n6. John Kirkland OBE and family - £420m\n\n2016 ranking: 7\n\n2016 worth: £325m\n\nProfits at East Midlands construction giant Bowmer and Kirkland are on the up, pushing through the £60 million mark.\n\nFigures for the year to August 2016 show an increase in pre-tax profits from £40.1 million in 2015 to £61.5 million last year. Revenue, including its share in joint ventures, climbed to £931 million from £849 million a year earlier.\n\nIt was in 1923 when joiner Alfred Bowmer and bricklayer Robert Kirkland teamed up to provide building work. They can’t have known that 90 years later Bowmer and Kirkland would be one of the most successful independent construction and engineering companies in the UK.\n\nBowmer and Kirkland has grown through expansion and acquisition and now has net assets of £369 million.\n\nJohn Kirkland, 80, is the group chairman and the third generation of his family to run the business, together with his younger brother Robert and his son Jack who is a director. Robert Kirkland’s sons Michael and Christopher also sit on the board, making it truly a family company. Jack Kirkland is chairman of Nottingham Contemporary international art centre.\n\nThe award-winning company’s headquarters is in Heage, with regional offices in Newark, Manchester, Reading, Sunderland and Glasgow. The firm also has homeland security and public safety companies in the United States and the UK under the Soncell name, and an office in Dubai. The group includes B&K Structures, specialists in timber and steel structural frameworks.

He joined the business in 1967 and became its chairman in 1976. He received an OBE in 1999, and is a passionate Derby County supporter along with his brother Robert who joined the business in 1975, having been a chairman of the Prince’s Trust in the region, and a governor of Repton School.\n\nJohn’s son Jack studied history at Oxford before attending Westminster University and BPP Law School. He went on to work for law firm Lovells before joining the family business. He serves on the Tate Gallery International Council.\n\nHe lives on The Park in Nottingham, an estate built on the site of Nottingham Castle deer park and famously lit by gas street lighting.\n\n7. William Parente and family - £335m\n\n2016 ranking: 6\n\n2016 worth: £330m\n\nThe Harley Gallery at William Parente’s Welbeck Abbey is displaying 5,000 items from the historic Portland Collection of fine and decorative art amassed over the centuries by the Dukes of Portland and their families.\n\nThe magnificent collection includes work by Michelangelo, Van Dyck and Stubbs, and is housed in a new £3 million gallery which opened last year. The Harley Gallery is named after Edward Harley who married Lady Henrietta Cavendish Holles, heiress to Welbeck, in 1713.\n\nWilliam Parente inherited 62,000 acres of the East Midlands, including the 15,000 acre Welbeck Abbey estate straddling the border of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, when his aunt, Lady Anne Cavendish Bentinck died in 2008.\n\nThe inheritance also included another 45,000 acres in Scotland, Bothal Castle in Northumberland, 30 prime acres of Central London around Harley Street and a hugely valuable collection of significant artworks. The Welbeck Estates Company and Bolsover Properties have net assets of more than £200 million in 2015.\n\nWilliam Parente, aged 66, the only grandchild of the 7th Duke of Portland, is involved in the Welbeck Project, a scheme to transform listed and architecturally significant 18th and 19th century buildings into a 21st century business community combining rural and creative industries.\n\nThe project, supported by the charitable Harley Foundation, is bringing together rural industries, the arts, the creative industries and technology companies.\n\nAs well as the historic abbey and Welbeck village, the estate includes a fishery, a brewery and two solar farms.\n\nThe Welbeck Abbey estate was mentioned in the Domesday Book and the abbey can trace its roots back to 1120.\n\nIn its history, the house has fallen into disrepair and then been restored to its original glory. It was used by the Ministry of Defence until 2005, after which it became the family home.\n\nWilliam Parente served as the High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire in 2003-2004. Apart from the estate, the main family business is Bolsover Properties. However it is the works of art which make up much of the family fortune.\n\n8= Sir Harry Djanogly - £300m\n\n2016 ranking: 8\n\n2016 worth: £300m\n\nSir Harry Djanogly isn’t just one of Nottingham’s greatest benefactors in the fields of art and education; he is also the owner of the world’s largest collection of the paintings of LS Lowry.\n\nThe name Djanogly can be found all over Sir Harry Djanogly’s adopted city of Nottingham - indicating the extent of the family’s philanthropic giving to the arts, museums and educational institutions.\n\nThe University of Nottingham, Nottingham Trent University, the Nottingham Playhouse and Lakeside Arts are just some of the organisations to benefit from Djanogly generosity. In addition there is the Djanogly City Academy, previously the technical college, the Djanogly Community Orchestra and the Sir Harry and Lady Djanogly learning resource centre. He is a patron of the UNESCO City of Literature in Nottingham.\n\nThe Djanogly’s arts and education philanthropy goes back to the 1970s, having made substantial contributions to the Victoria and Albert Museum, the National Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, Tate Modern and Tate Britain where they made a large donation to the Milllbank Project. He also supported the British Museum which has a Sir Harry and Lady Djanogly Gallery for Clocks and Watches, and the Royal School of Ballet where there is a Djanogly studio.\n\nAs well as art philanthropists they are also collectors, with a passion for British decorative art. Their collections include ceramics, woodwork and watches, and they own a substantial collection of paintings by LS Lowry.\n\nSir Harry Djanogly, 79, fled Nazi Germany with his family in 1935. He came to Nottingham and built up the family business supplying of knitwear and hosiery. This developed into a substantial textiles business - Nottingham Manufacturing - with facilities in Mansfield and Loughborough. Marks & Spencer was among its customers. The company merged with Coats Viyella - now Coats plc - in 1985 and Sir Harry Djanogly was its chairman until the company was taken private.\n\nHe was knighted in 1993 for services to charity.\n\nHe made headlines last year when he was charged with dangerous driving and assault after a Metropolitan police officer stopped him for speeding when rushing his wife Lady Carol Ann Djanogly to hospital. He was cleared of all charges at Isleworth Crown Court.\n\nHis son Jonathan - a lawyer - is the Conservative MP for Huntingdon.\n\n8= Tony Wilkinson and family - £300m\n\n2016 ranking: 9\n\n2016 worth: £280m\n\nInvestment at Tony Wilkinson’s discount household goods chain Wilko is on the up, despite tougher times on the high street. Investment in the year to January 2017 it almost doubled to £41 million with 19 new store openings.\n\nThat, combined with cost increases following the Brexit vote has taken a slice out of profits which have slipped to £5.1 million from £25.9 million.\n\nBut turnover at the Worksop-based company was up at £1.5 billion. The firm continues to have a strong balance sheet and has eliminated past debts. It also has an ambitious store opening plan, looking to open 100 stores in the next five years. A reorganisation will mean that supervisory jobs will be cut, but up to 1,000 new staff will be recruited on the shop floor.\n\nTony Wilkinson’s father JK Wilkinson, who died in 1997, opened his first store in Leicester in 1930. Now nearly 40 years later Wilkinson has 400 stores around the country and continues to expand. It has more than 20 new stores in the pipeline and is targeting London and the south east where it feels under-represented. It now has seven stores in the capital.\n\nWilkinson’s value-for-money principals have resulted in one of the UK’s most successful chains of hardware and convenience stores, with well over six million sq ft of trading space and more than seven million people visiting a Wilkinson store every week.\n\nIt has a successful online operation and has launched Wilkinson Asia which is rolling out Wilkinson products and values in the Far East from its Hong Kong and Delhi offices.\n\nTony Wilkinson, now 79, retired in 2005. The business is run by the third generation with grand-daughter of its founder, Lisa Wilkinson serving on the board as a director.\n\nThe company and its employees put a big emphasis on raising money for charity, with one per cent of profits being donated to good causes and Wilkinson employees putting well over 5000 hours into volunteering and fund-raising for 25 nominated charities.\n\nThe company has a distribution centre in Manton Wood, Nottinghamshire and has a second distribution centre in Magor, South Wales.\n\n10. Sir Paul and Lady Smith - £270m\n\n2016 ranking: 10\n\n2016 worth: £260m\n\nRevenue is down but profits are up for Sir Paul Smith’s fashion brand which has been feeling the chill of pressures on the high street, along with a tough trading environment in overseas markets.\n\nThe company improved its profits from £9.7 million to £11.1 million in the year to June 2016, but turnover dropped from £191.5 million to £178.6 million.\n\nThe year saw the closure of the flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York, as well as the first shop he had opened 47 years ago in Byard Lane.\n\nHowever new stores opened, including in London and Glasgow, and income from Japan remained stable. There has been positive growth in Australia and South Africa.\n\nSir Paul Smith’s fashion products are wholesaled in more than 60 countries around the world, but he still believes in getting personally involved in his growing company – both as designer and chairman.\n\nThe Beeston-born designer famously despises debt, and believes in growing his fashion business from its own resources. This principle served him well during the downturn and allowed him to invest further in the business, including a £10 million warehouse and head office facilities in his native Nottingham and stores around the world. A wholesale showroom was built in Dusseldorf in Germany.\n\nHe is as well-known in Japan as he is in the UK, with more than 200 stores there. A 40 per cent share sale was made by his wife in 2006 to Japanese licensee Itochu.\n\nFour years ago he opened a new shop in the Mandarin Gallery in Singapore – his third shop in that country. A women’s wear shop in Paris was also opened, as well as his flagship store on Albermarle Street in London.\n\nThe Albermarle Street shop was the venue for the unveiling of his collaboration with Land Rover to produce his bespoke Land Rover Defender. As a longstanding fan of the vehicle (he has one at his home in Italy) he designed a version using 27 different colours, using interior fabrics by US upholstery company Maharam, which he designs for. He marked the end of production of the Land Rover Defender by driving the patchwork special edition around central London.\n\nPaul Smith stores can be found in Melbourne, Amsterdam, Kuwait, Bangalore, Los Angeles, Antwerp, The Philippines, Istanbul, Hong Kong, Milan, St Petersburg and Red Square in Moscow – all part of a business worth more than £300 million. Sir Paul’s 57 per cent stake is worth more than £200 million. He has other assets, including a share in the Colston property company.\n\nAt the age of 16, with no career plans or qualifications, Paul Smith was propelled by his father into a menial job at a local warehouse in Nottingham where he lived. Ambitions to become a racing cyclist were crushed following a bad accident and so, inspired by conversations with students at the local art college, he moved into the world of fashion.\n\nAfter managing a boutique, he poured his modest savings into a shop. At the same time he took evening classes in tailoring and enlisted the help of his then girlfriend Pauline Denyer (now Lady Smith).\n\nThat was in 1970. Now, 47 years later Paul Smith, art lover and enthusiastic blogger at the age of 71, is a global fashion icon.\n\nSir Paul continues to play an active part in the company. He also takes a detailed interest in the Japanese business, designing the clothes, choosing the fabrics and approving shop locations. He remains an enthusiastic supporter of cycle sport, and is also an admirer of good design in bicycles.\n\nHe was awarded an honorary Fellowship of RIBA, the Royal Institute of British Architects. He was knighted in 2000 for services to British fashion.\n\n11. Peter Gadsby - £185m\n\n2016 ranking: 11\n\n2016 worth: £155m\n\nPeter Gadsby has made his fortune from property development and investment across the East Midlands. His developments include NG2 – the premium Nottingham business park occupied by Experian, Coutts and Mercedes Benz among others.\n\nPeter Gadsby, 69, has been worried that Brexit could have a negative effect on the region’s business and technology parks.\n\nIn particular he thinks the UK’s divorce from the EU may mean it is harder to attract global investors to Derby’s Infinity Park, a £200 million 100-acre technology park adjacent to the Rolls-Royce Aerospace campus.\n\nThe site, which has enterprise zone status, is a collaboration between Cedar House Investments, of which Peter Gadsby is chairman, along with Derby City Council, Rolls-Royce, Wilson Bowden, Peveril Securities, the University of Derby and the Harpur Crewe Estate.\n\nPeter Gadsby has made his fortune from property development and investment across the East Midlands. His developments include NG2 – the premium Nottingham business park occupied by Experian, Coutts and Mercedes-Benz among others.\n\nHe sold his stake in professional landlord group Birch Properties for £40 million. His main company is now Ark Capital which acts as a holding company for the group which includes Cedar House, Miller Birch and the Radleigh Group. He is chairman and major shareholder in Ark Capital, which reported profits of £7.1 million in 2015.\n\nCedar House is one of the Midlands leading commercial developers and over the last 10 years or more has developed more than a million square feet of mixed use, retail, office and industrial space.\n\nMiller Birch is a 50-50 joint venture between Ark and the Miller Group. Formed in 2000 Miller Birch has also developed more than a million square feet of retail and commercial space.\n\nThe Radleigh Group develops residential housing and commercial property. The award-winning operation builds traditional homes throughout the East Midlands.\n\nAs well as acting as a holding company for these three operations Ark Capital, with its headquarters at Pride Park, has a substantial strategic land bank of commercial and residential development plots. It is also involved in a number of joint ventures, including the Castle Marina development in Nottingham with Miller Homes.\n\nArk Capital also operates a private equity fund which invests between £2 million and £5 million in growing businesses. Peter Gadsby set up a £10 million venture capital fund to provide backing for companies in the food, IT and telecoms sectors.\n\nPeter Gadsby, who lives in Quarndon, is a former chairman of Derby County football club, having been a lifelong fan. In 2006 he led a consortium to buy the club and clear its £52 million debts.\n\nHe sits on the D2N2 Local Enterprise Partnership and is a former chairman. In 2009 received an honorary doctorate in business administration from the University of Derby.\n\n12. The Duke of Rutland - £140m\n\n2016 ranking: 12\n\n2016 worth: £140m\n\nThe Duke of Rutland is probably best known for owning one of the jewels in the East Midlands crown - the magnificent Belvoir Castle, set in 18,000 acres on the Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire border\n\nHe also owns the spectacular Haddon Hall, near Bakewell, the setting for the Keira Knightley film Pride and Prejudice.\n\nAccording to Tatler magazine the Duke of Rutland’s three daughters, Lady Alice, Lady Eliza and Lady Violet Manners, would top any list of party invitees, guaranteed to liven up an function.\n\nTheir father, the Duke of Rutland – David Charles Robert Manners – inherited his title when his father died in 1999. The 58 year-old Duke became the 11th Duke of Rutland. He separated from his wife, Emma, in 2012 but she still lives at Belvoir in a separate wing of the building.\n\nInheritance tax has taken its toll of estate values, but significant art collections increase overall wealth. He sold two Poussin paintings for £19 million to pay death duties and help maintain Belvoir Castle which, together with Haddon Hall, is worth at least £65 million.\n\nHis Terrace Hill Farms business - the Duke and Duchess are both directors - has assets of more than £32 million.\n\nBelvoir Castle is the fourth stately home to stand on the spot of what was originally a Norman Castle. It has been home to the Manners family for more than 500 years and the seat of the Dukes of Rutland for three centuries. Over the years an impressive collection of art, tapestries and furniture has been assembled and is now on public view in the lavish state rooms. The art collection includes work by Gainsborough, Reynolds and Holbein.\n\nThe current Regency castle has been used for several film and television locations, including The Da Vinci Code, Little Lord Fauntleroy and The Young Victoria. Its grounds also host the Country Landowners Association Game Fair and numerous rock concerts.\n\nBelvoir is undergoing a £6.5 million repair programme, and the Duke also plans to turn part of the estate into a vineyard. The family also manages The Manners Arms, a country hotel and restaurant on the Belvoir Estate.\n\nHaddon Hall is a fortified medieval manor house dating from the 12th Century, and has been in the Manners family since 1567. Described by Simon Jenkins in 1000 Best Houses as “the most perfect house to survive from the Middle Ages”, the strikingly designed house is surrounded by terraced Elizabethan gardens set among the rolling countryside of the Peak District National Park.\n\nAfter laying dormant for 200 years, the 9th Duke and Duchess of Rutland restored the house in the 1920s.\n\nThe house is surrounded by Elizabethan terraced gardens overlooking the River Wye.\n\n13. Gary Dutton MBE - £135m\n\n2016 ranking: 13\n\n2016 worth: £130m\n\nGary Dutton believes that selling is a science, and he believes in sharing his knowledge with others. So much so that his autobiography - The Business Builder - carries the message that everyone can learn the business of wealth creation.\n\nMany people make their fortune by selling a company at the right time at the right price, and Gary Dutton has done it twice.\n\nBuilding supplies tycoon Gary Dutton sold Huthwaite-based Synseal, one of the UK’s biggest suppliers of PVC conservatories, door frames and windows, in a deal worth £80 million. That was in 2009. His next company, Door-Stop International, was sold in 2014 for £30 million.\n\nHe founded Synseal Extrusions in 1980, initially as a domestic installation company working out of a corner shop in Sutton-in-Ashfield before diversifying to become a fabricator and later a systems company. When it was founded it had just £200 in the bank. In 1990 the company closed its retail outlets and became a trade supplier. In 1995 he sold the manufacturing operation to JBS Industries for £3.2 million.\n\nWhen the rest of the business was sold eight years ago it employed 500 people on its 32-acre site and supplied more than 700 independent fabricators in the UK. Sales were £90 million with profits approaching £10 million.\n\nThe business was bought by a management buyout team led by chief executive David Leng with other members of the management team, and backed by private equity firm HIG Capital. The sale was awarded the Deal of the Year accolade at the East Midlands Dealmakers dinner and HIG invested £30.5 million in the business.\n\nSince the MBO it has continued to grow, investing in acquisitions and its own facilities which now include seven manufacturing sites.\n\nGary Dutton, 69, founded Door-Stop in 2008 with his son Nick and a business partner, producing composite doors on an automated production facility in Huthwaite.

Earlier this year the business received the Queens Award for Enterprise in International Trade, and the company is planning a new headquarters building.\n\nThe £100 million-plus company was founded in 1902 by Robert, 68, and Jonathan Mould’s great grandfather, also Robert, and remains a family business run by the fifth generation. Robert Mould gave his name to the company.\n\nOriginally a furniture manufacturer on a small scale, Romo now designs and markets exclusive furnishings.

Bailey Asset Management. He and his family established the business in 1999 after dissatisfaction with the returns offered by private stockbrokers.\n\nTheir St James Street investment house was set up initially for their own purposes.

Roger and Charles Holehouse - £85m\n\n2016 ranking: 16\n\n2016 worth: £92m\n\nA mild winter and a reducing demand for coal have taken their toll of the Fernwood Group’s balance sheet.
