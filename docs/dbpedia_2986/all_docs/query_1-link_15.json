        "text": "What you are about to read is my opinion.\n\nCompanies live and die based on the competence of their CEOs and boards of directors. In the case of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), they're learning this lesson the hard way.\n\nWalgreens CEO, Rosalind Brewer, was forced to step down as CEO amid the drugstore giant’s flagging share price and a botched multibillion transformation to provide more healthcare services. Brewer, who is 61 years old, became Walgreens CEO in March 2021, leaving her high-profile job as chief operating officer at Starbucks Corp. Brewer was president and CEO of Walmart’s Sam’s Club prior to her stint at the coffee chain.\n\nIn tapping Brewer to become CEO, Walgreens made the argument that they were getting a seasoned executive with two decades of retail and consumer experience. Walgreens executive chairman, Stefano Pessina, the 82-year-old Italian billionaire who preceded Brewer as CEO was instrumental in her hiring. Pessina, who owns 17% of the shares of Walgreens stock, is the company's largest stockholder. (Pessina is married to Walgreen's Chief Operating Officer, Ornella Barra. The information about the marriage is disclosed in the company's Form 10-K under information about executive officers.)\n\nBrewer is a case study for how not to hire a CEO. Yes, Brewer was the CEO of Sam's Club. It's also true that Brewer was the Chief Operating Officer at Starbucks. However, Walgreens Nominating and Governance Committee obviously failed to ask this question: Did working for Kimberly-Clark, Sam's Club, and Starbucks give Brewer the necessary skills to identify the best strategy for Walgreens, and make her an expert in health and pharmacy operations? The answer is no, it didn't.\n\nIf Brewer had experience turning around a large failing company, making acquisitions, and integrating different companies into a coherent operating model, she wouldn't have to be an expert in health care and pharmacy operations. However, Brewer lacks such experience.\n\nBased on my knowledge of Brewer, I must question how thoroughly Walgreens Nominating and Governance Committee, and Walgreens HR department, evaluated Brewer's background. I've written multiple articles about Walmart and in the course of my research, I spoke with many current and former executives. Brewer was a topic during some of the conversations. Sam's Club blossomed after Brewer left and John Furner became the CEO of Sam's Club. I was provided with many reasons and examples of why Sam's Club improved after Brewer's departure. (Many of the individuals I spoke with in off the record conversations at Walmart, Sam's Club, and Starbucks who worked for and with Brewer, have a low opinion of her.)\n\nIn researching this article, I focused on trying to find the reason why Walgreens is in the shape they're in. In my opinion, the smoking gun of why Walgreens has been suffering comes from the hand of Pessina. Instead of selecting an executive who could truly elevate Walgreens as a company, Walgreens hired Brewer over a large number of qualified candidates. Pessina, who was still CEO and well aware of the challenges of the job, could have stopped the hiring of Brewer, but he didn't. Pessina supported hiring Brewer because of the DEI goals of Walgreens.\n\nAccording to a Walgreens spokesperson, \"Mr. Pessina, who was CEO at the time, did not lead the recruitment process for his successor. After an extensive search, the appointment of Ms. Brewer was recommended by the Nominating and Governance Committee to the board of directors, led at the time by Executive Chairman Jim Skinner.\"\n\nI never stated that Pessina led the recruitment process. What I dispute is that there was an \"extensive search\" to find a CEO. Jim Skinner gave specific instructions to the search committee to find a diversity candidate vs. stating that he wanted the search committee to find the best candidate for the CEO role. It's inconceivable to me that Walgreens Nominating and Governance Committee, couldn't find a more experienced and qualified candidate than Rosalind Brewer, someone with no healthcare or pharmacy experience.\n\nWhen Pessina learned that Rosalind Brewer was being recommended to replace him as CEO, Pessina chose to overlook Brewer's lack of experience and he supported Brewer's hiring. It turned out to be a terrible mistake on the part of Pessina and Walgreens.\n\nWhy then was Brewer hired since she didn't have any industry experience? Hiring Brewer was designed to make a \"statement\" about the importance of diversity and to further Walgreens support of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). It worked. As soon as Brewer became CEO, Brewer pushed hard to change Walgreens culture to become \"as woke as possible\" according to several sources. Walgreen's embrace of DEI is \"killing the company,\" according to sources I've spoken with at all levels of the company.\n\nGoing woke did nothing to make the company better. Instead, the policies were viewed as being a \"waste of time and a distraction\" by many inside the company. It's clear that instead of wanting to hire the best candidates, Walgreens focused only on, \"hiring candidates that would allow the company to tout their diversity.\" This raised considerable alarm inside the company.\n\nDEI has clearly harmed Walgreens and limited their ability to be a competitive company. Valerie Jarrett, a major proponent of DEI, is on the board of directors at Walgreens. She and Brewer worked closely to expand DEI across the company. I can't stress enough how destructive Jarrett and Brewer's influence has been based on discussions with sources.\n\nBrewer was hired to transform Walgreens and to make the company more competitive with CVS. CVS has become much more aggressive in moving into healthcare, and Walgreens executives watched as CVS generated more revenue and profits and became, \"a much better company than Walgreens,\" according to several executives I spoke with.\n\nWhat did Brewer choose to do to close the gap with CVS? One of the first things she did was champion Walgreens to address racial equity and healthcare disparities, \"that most often affect people who live in underserved areas.\" Brewer has a history of championing rights for minorities and women. Pessina and the board supported Brewer, although there were more pressing issues that required the attention of Brewer and her team. Brewer's efforts did nothing to close the gap with CVS.\n\nBrewer also chose to copy CVS' playbook as it related to healthcare partnerships and acquisitions. Under Brewer, Walgreens acquired a 63% ownership stake in VillageMD for $5.2B, a doctor-staffed clinic developer which is rolling out 700 primary care centers attached to Walgreens drugstores. (I estimate that Walgreen's will have to close 100 hundred or more VillageMD location because they're co-located with a retail pharmacy. The clinics are simply too small to make the economics work.)\n\nWalgreens also acquired Summit Health CityMD in an $8.9B deal...and overpaid by $1.2B in my opinion. Neither decision has helped Walgreens improve their financials or gain market share. M&A experts that I spoke with are skeptical that the acquisitions will return any value to Walgreens. Based on sources, there was too little focus placed on integrating the acquisitions by Brewer, and the acquired companies have yet to be integrated into the Walgreens ecosystem.\n\nIt's plausible that Walgreens will end up divesting VillageMD and Summit Health CityMD. The companies should have never been acquired according to several M&A analysts that I spoke with.\n\nAt its core, Walgreens is a pharmacy. The company earns money by attracting consumers to choose Walgreens to fill their prescriptions and get vaccinated against certain diseases. Walgreens stores also sell many different retail items like food and Health and Beauty products. The stores also offer a service to process photos.\n\nIn order for Walgreens to operate at peak performance, they must manage their staffing needs for store labor, pharmacy technicians, and especially pharmacists. This is not happening. Based on discussions with multiple sources, Walgreens is experiencing a 40%+ monthly turnover ratio of store personnel, and a 35%+ monthly turnover ratio for pharmacists. Walgreens can't hire and retain the people they need the most to meet the needs of their customers and grow the company.\n\nBrewer's first priority should have been addressing the high turnover ratio of labor, pharmacy technicians, and pharmacists, and identify a strategy to improve store and pharmacy operations to make Walgreens the preferred employer of choice for pharmacists. This wasn't done and Walgreens continues to hemorrhage labor and pharmacists.\n\nI'm also amazed that with 9,000+ stores, improving retail operations, supply chain management, and logistics weren't a priority for Brewer. Instead of hiring the most experienced and capable individual, Brewer hired Tracey Brown, who she had worked with at Sam's Club, to be EVP, President of Walgreens Retail and Chief Customer Officer. Brown was hired to oversee store operations, merchandising, marketing, product, digital, omnichannel, store format, data and analytics, and the supply chain organization.\n\nAccording to sources, \"Brown lacks experience in the majority of the areas she is responsible for at Walgreens.\" Obviously, that didn't matter to Walgreens when they hired Brown. (Like Brewer, individuals from Sam's Club and Walmart that I spoke with in off the record conversations have a negative opinion of Brown.)\n\nBrown and Brewer are friends. Sources at Walgreens told me that Brown operated freely within the company with no oversight from Brewer. Big mistake. Brown \"vacillated from one project and strategy to another and so far has delivered nothing of value to Walgreens\", according to sources. Brown's lack of performance didn't matter to Brewer. She promoted Brown a few months prior to her departure although Brown \"didn't deserve a promotion\" according to sources. Many people inside Walgreens believe Brewer knew her time at the company was coming to an end, \"so she promoted her friend into a role with more responsibility and a higher salary.\" Why did the board of directors and Pessina allow the promotion to take place?\n\nWalgreens, which has always done a poor job of managing their retail stores, has become even worse at retail and the stores have declined significantly. Brewer and Pessina share some of the blame for Walgreens failed retail store strategy but the \"majority of blame should be directed at Brown\" who is responsible for improving the stores.\n\nAccording to sources, the consensus inside Walgreens is that the company made a mistake in hiring Brown as she doesn't have the \"leadership or business experience Walgreens needs.\"\n\nTo be fair to Brown, I encourage Walgreens board of directors to investigate the facts related to Brewer and Brown's relationship, and audit Brown's actual job performance, skills, and leadership.\n\nThe Walls Come Tumbling Down\n\nAccording to executives that I spoke with, the worst run department within Walgreens is IT. Several executives used the same phrase when speaking to me about the IT organization, \"It's a disaster. I've never seen a worse IT department.\"\n\nWhen Brewer joined Walgreens, she immediately began to voice her displeasure about the IT department to her professional contacts. Brewer apparently shared her feelings about Walgreens with the founder of Dell, Michael Dell, telling Michael, \"I have no faith in my IT organization.\"\n\nInstead of contracting a consulting firm to assess the Current State and identify the optimal Future State, as well as conduct in-depth gap analysis, Brewer chose to bring in a new Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer for Walgreens Boots Alliance, Hsiao Wang, formerly of Michaels Stores. Brewer had worked with Wang at Sam's Club. Brewer is the only person who interviewed Wang. Big mistake.\n\nIndividuals who worked with Wang at Michaels, revealed to me that Wang's strategy, \"weakened the company's IT capabilities and provided no value to Michaels.\" What's shocking about Brewer hiring Wang is that he had just been fired from Michaels for failing to deliver any value to the company. Wang reported to Michaels CEO Ashley Buchanan; Buchanan worked with Brewer at Sam's Club. You can read about Michaels failed IT transformation here. When Wang went to Walgreens, he followed the exact strategy he had used at Michaels.\n\nUpon starting at Walgreens, Wang told Brewer, and others inside and outside the company, that his goal was to, \"Make Walgreens technology better than Amazon's, and sell Walgreens technology to other companies.\" I used to work for Amazon. I spoke with Amazon associates in AWS and IT about Wang's plan and they stated to me that it would be \"virtually impossible\" for Wang to achieve his goal even if Walgreens invested \"several billion dollars.\"\n\nBrewer should have informed Wang that she didn't support his strategy. However, Brewer knows so little about technology that she didn't push back against Wang. In any other company I've worked, Wang would have been fired for suggesting something so ridiculous.\n\nAlthough Walgreens was going through a technology upgrade when Wang arrived, Wang fired over 1,000 people, many with first-hand knowledge about how Walgreens technology operated. Sources have told me that the company will be unable to recover from the loss of the systems expertise.\n\nBrewer did nothing to stop the terminations as she saw the move as a way to report \"cost savings.\" This is another example of Brewer proving her lack of IT experience. Walgreens should have retained the associates with experience in legacy systems until the technology upgrade was completed. The board should have immediately intervened when they learned of the terminations.\n\nWang was unfazed at the loss of experienced associates. Instead, Wang presented a plan to Brewer that he said would \"accelerate the company's technology and software capabilities.\" The plan consisted of Wang, \"hiring 5,000 engineers, building a Walgreens version of Databricks, and hiring 200 engineers experienced in AI to build a Walgreens version of ChatGPT.\" Wang was so committed to building an army of engineers that he personally spent hours reviewing resumes and choosing engineers to be interviewed and hired, according to sources.\n\nWalgreens must have a strategy for how to leverage AI to its full potential. However, hiring 200 engineers skilled in AI to build a version of ChatGPT, \"is the strategy of an amateur and a bad idea for Walgreens,\" according to an expert in IT familiar with Walgreens internal IT systems and operations.\n\nAccording to sources, \"Wang's plan was the worst possible strategy for Walgreens. The cost and complexity of the plan are too high. In addition, Wang failed to contract an unbiased and independent consulting firm to conduct a thorough review of the Current State tech stack and software being utilized in the company, and identify the optimal Future State Operating Model, tech stack, and software.\"\n\nSince joining Walgreens, sources told me that, \"Wang has alienated people inside and outside of Walgreens including consulting firms, system integrators, and technology vendors. Wang even refused to attend meetings with any vendors. Wang won't even attend meetings with members of his own department. Human Resources has had to investigate Wang many times but so far he has been able to keep his job.\" Sources also told me, \"There is a concern that the IT organization has become dysfunctional, and that Walgreens IT systems are lacking and its causing severe issues within the company.\"\n\nThe failure on the part of Brewer to insist that an independent consulting firm assess the tech stack, operations, and strategy, prevented Brewer from being able to thoroughly understand how poorly the IT department was being run. For example, Walgreens is constantly going through technology upgrades and the company relies on an army of contractors to perform many of the functions that should be done by Walgreens associates. Why? In my opinion, Walgreens relies on contractors as they're unable to attract the necessary IT talent, and the company is constantly upgrading their systems because they lack a coherent IT strategy. A logical question Brewer should have asked a firm to answer is this, Should Walgreens outsource their IT department and technology? Why or why not?\n\nUpdate: Since this newsletter was posted, I've received calls and emails from dozens of executives and associates at Walgreens complaining that Hsiao Wang has \"destroyed\" Walgreens IT department and that Walgreens is at risk of a \"massive systems failure that could shut down stores and clinics.\"\n\nI can state with 100% certainty that in any company I've worked for or provided consulting to, Wang would have already been fired as a result of his behavior and lack of respect. The fact that Walgreens has yet to terminate Wang has created the perception inside the company that \"no one at the board level or in HR cares about what's going on even though Wang has put Walgreens at risk.\"\n\nAnother individual within the IT department, Maria Lensing, Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer, Technology Team, has also alienated many individuals inside and outside of Walgreens, and has also alienated and insulted companies that Walgreens depends on, according to sources. There is a concern that Maria is putting \"Walgreens at risk\" due to her lack of experience and abrasive personality. Sources tell me that Lensing has active \"HR cases open against her\" and that Lensing appears to be \"struggling\" in her role.\n\nDuring my research for this article, I spoke with individuals with direct knowledge of Maria and her behavior while she was the SVP and CTO, Engineering Infrastructure and Operations, at McKesson. Maria quickly established herself as being \"unqualified for the job and lacking any semblance of leadership.\" Lensing was terminated by McKesson according to sources.\n\nLike Wang, Lensing would have already been fired at my past employers or at any of my consulting clients.\n\nI recommend that an independent 3rd party should be contracted to investigate the leadership, management, and strategy of Hsiao Wang and Maria Lensing, measure the morale within the IT department, and conduct a thorough audit of the leadership and management ability of anyone hired by Wang. This must be a priority for the company. This must also be a priority for Ginger Graham.\n\nBased on my experience working with best-in-class IT organizations, Walgreens must address their current issues ASAP and make the necessary changes in leadership and management. In my estimation, Walgreens is wasting hundreds of millions of dollars on their lack of a coherent IT strategy.\n\nThe Slow Decline\n\nWalgreens’ share price has been sliding to a 14-year low as investors wait impatiently for results of the drugstore giant’s transformation into a major provider of healthcare services. In Walgreens’ most recent quarter, profits tumbled to $118 million—less than half of what they were a year ago—due to, Brewer said, “significantly lower demand for COVID-related services.” A decrease in COVID-related services should have been expected, and a plan should have been put into place to grow revenue via other means.\n\nBrewer had to step down because she didn't have a strategy to reverse the losses or make Walgreens a better company. I'm not surprised for one reason - Brewer had no prior healthcare or pharmacy experience. Brewer was destined to fail regardless of how hard she tried. Brewer's time as CEO of Walgreens reminds me of Ron Johnson's ill-fated stint as JC Penney's CEO.\n\nI don't want to give the impression that Brewer didn't do anything right at Walgreens. That's false. Brewer was 100% correct in ending the relationship with the company Cooler Screens. According to Brewer, walking into a Walgreens store that had installed Cooler Screens was like, \"being on the strip in Las Vegas.\" Cooler Screens has filed a lawsuit against Walgreens for ending the deal, but I applaud Brewer for making the decision to end one of the worst agreements ever signed by Walgreens. This is another example of where the board should insist that an audit be conducted to document the facts surrounding the agreement with Cooler Screens. Who played a major role in negotiating and getting an agreement signed with Cooler Screens? Stefano Pessina. (I would never have agreed to installing Cooler Screens in any of the stores. Walgreens should remove all of the screens.)\n\nAs for Pessina, and the board of directors, I believe they should be held accountable to answer these questions:\n\nWhy are so many things broken inside Walgreens? Why has the board allowed Walgreens to decline as a company? Why hasn't the board been more involved?\n\nIs the board considering selling Walgreens Boots Alliance? Why or why not?\n\nWhy did Pessina allow the terminations in IT to take place?\n\nWhy hasn't Pessina insisted that a consulting firm be contracted to audit the IT department's strategy, operations, and tech stack? What are the facts?\n\nWhat changes, if any, does Pessina plan to make in HR to improve morale in the company, and attract more qualified managers, directors, and executives?\n\nWhy hasn't Pessina insisted that an independent 3rd-party, in collaboration with HR, audit and investigate Wang, Lensing, and other executives in the company?\n\nWhy does the board and Pessina continue to support DEI when it's clear that DEI has resulted in the hiring of extremely unqualified executives that have weakened Walgreens as a company?\n\nIn my opinion, the board of directors must meet to discuss removing Pessina as Executive Chairman. At 82-years of age, the time has come for Pessina to step down or be removed and a new Executive Chairman be named. This should be done to reduce risk to Walgreens Boots Alliance.\n\nDuring everything that's been going on at Walgreens since Brewer was hired and replaced, CVS has been firing on all cylinders under the leadership of President and CEO, Karen Lynch. Karen Lynch is exactly the type of CEO that Walgreens should have hired. After reviewing Karen's background and experience, it's easy to see why Walgreens selection of Brewer as CEO doomed the company to failure.\n\nCVS has done an exceptional job of hiring competent and qualified executives for all senior level positions in the company.\n\nReaders can review CVS earnings and other financial information here.\n\nWalgreens has a market cap of only $20B. CVS has a market cap of $84B. CVS generated $321B in revenue in 2022. Walgreens generated $132B in revenue in 2022. CVS is no longer concerned about Walgreens.\n\nAccording to a Walgreens spokesperson, I am overlooking the fact that, \"In the 5-year period between Mr. Pessina joining the board and the beginning of COVID, adjusted earnings per share grew more than 50% from $3.88 to $5.99.\" I am not overlooking what Pessina accomplished. This article is focused on the time period of when Rosalind Brewer became CEO until she was fired. There was no need for me to write about what Pessina accomplished from 2015 to 2020.\n\nThe same Walgreens spokesperson stated to me that, \"You are implying that Walgreens is a large failing company by your comments.\" Forgive me. My intent is not to imply that Walgreens is a failing company. My intent is to make it as clear as humanly possible that WALGREENS IS A FAILING COMPANY due to their lack of growth, an IT organization teetering on the edge of collapse, a number of executives incapable of showing leadership and respect, a number of executives woefully unqualified for their jobs, a bloated bureaucracy, a declining share price, poor utilization of the stores, operating too many uninspiring stores, a sub optimized supply chain, excessive logistics costs, excessive complexity across the company, a poor customer experience, ignoring opportunities to enter new categories with much higher margins and revenue, and continuing with a corporate strategy that doesn't provide Walgreens with a competitive advantage in their industry.\n\nWithout better leadership and a bold plan, the slow decline at Walgreens will continue. I believe that Walgreens stock price will decline to between $10.00 to $14.00 by the end of 2024.\n\nGinger Graham - Let's Break Some Rules\n\nWith Brewer out as CEO, board member Ginger Graham has been named as interim CEO. Note: Graham takes over at a time when Walgreens is also operating with an interim CFO. Graham is legitimately qualified to be the interim CEO but she isn't the best choice to be named the permanent CEO.\n\nWalgreens should hire someone from outside the company to be CEO like Andrew Witty, Dan Schumacher, or Brian Thompson. There are many other qualified candidates that I didn't name. John Rex should be considered for the open CFO role at Walgreens.\n\nWalgreens should consider a co-CEO arrangement whereby one CEO focuses on stores and customer experience and another CEO focuses on strategy and business development; not my favorite idea but worth considering for Walgreens.\n\nI'm confident that Ms. Graham will be receptive to everything that I recommend the board and company consider. Graham wrote an interesting article for the Harvard Business Review in 2002 titled, If You Want Honesty, Break Some Rules. In the article, Graham outlines the importance of being brutally honest about a company's culture, operations, products, strategy, technology, and the people running the company. Only by being honest can a company truly understand what they must improve.\n\nI wrote this issue of the No Retreat/No Surrender newsletter after reading Graham's article. I believe someone owes Graham the truth and apparently, based on the number of people from Walgreens who have reached out to me, the truth isn't appreciated at Walgreens. That has to change. Fast.\n\nThe Wrong Focus\n\nIn my professional opinion, Walgreens has the wrong strategy as a company. Becoming a consumer-centric healthcare company severely limits the ability of Walgreens to generate higher margins, revenue and growth. All Walgreens is doing is copying CVS's strategy and removing all differentiation between the companies. In reading Brewer's comments about what she accomplished as CEO, it appears that Brewer wanted to turn Walgreens into a non-profit organization focused on serving \"marginalized and underfunded communities\" across the U.S. There are much better ways for Walgreens to address the lack of health care for many communities than the strategy championed by Brewer and the board.\n\nEven when presented with a chance to do something positive for Walgreens, Brewer chose to do the opposite. For example, Walgreen's pilot with Kroger was exceptionally successful. Brewer, however, didn't like the idea of partnering with Kroger and she ended the relationship. Kroger's CEO was rightfully livid at the decision as he understood how beneficial the partnership would have been to Kroger but also to Walgreens. Brewer simply doesn't understand business.\n\nThe next CEO must review everything championed by Brewer. I believe most of what Brewer did as CEO should be undone.\n\nFocusing on being a consumer-centric healthcare company isn't enough for Walgreens. Amazon and Walmart are investing heavily in primary care, and I anticipate that both companies are prepared to make multiple acquisitions to support their strategy. I believe Amazon has a better chance of succeeding in pharmacy and healthcare than Walmart.\n\nWalgreens must do more. Walgreens must Think BIG.\n\nInstead of copying the moves of CVS, Walgreens should have sought out ways to differentiate the company from CVS. I understand why Brewer chose to copy the strategy used by CVS, but Pessina and the board should have recognized the importance of not turning Walgreens into a CVS clone.\n\nWalgreens must seek out opportunities for growth. For example, Walgreens should identify a strategy for becoming the leader in 24 hour, seven days per week, in-home IV therapy treatments (Myer's cocktails, NAD+, immunity boosts, custom IVs) in the U.S. Mobile and in-home IV treatments and mobile doctor visits are one of the fastest growing segments of health-related services and is on the way to becoming a multi-billion-dollar industry.\n\nWalgreens should go after the health and exercise supplements market including SARMs, a form of legally available products that promote muscle growth. The market for supplements and SARMs is expected to reach $250B by 2030.\n\nWalgreens should strive to become the leader in anti-aging treatment, supplements, and nutrition. The anti-aging market is projected to reach a value of $106B by 2030. Walgreens should offer their own private label products where possible.\n\nWalgreens hasn't invested in offering Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT) and other options for men. The TRT industry is expected to generate nearly $4B in sales by 2030. Walgreens can command a significant share of the market with the right strategy.\n\nWalgreens should invest in strategies to become a leading destination for Botox treatments for men and women. The market for Botox is expected to reach $13B by 2030. Additional revenue can be generated by offering dermal fillers and laser treatments for skin. The dermal fillers market in the U.S. is estimated to reach $6B by 2030. Cosmetics are another opportunity that Walgreens should pursue. Walgreens should offer their own private label products where possible.\n\nWalgreens should staff a team inside the company to identify what it will take for Walgreens to become the \"go to\" destination for weight-loss treatments via the use of Wegovy, Ozempic, and Mounjaro. The weight-loss market for these drugs is estimated to reach $150B by 2030. Walgreens should offer their own private label GLP-1 drug.\n\nWalgreens should lead the charge to get low-level steroids like Winstrol, Anavar, high dosage testosterone, and Primobolan, approved for use via a prescription. Why? Because one of the side effects of the GLP-1 weight loss drugs will be the loss of muscle. Stacking certain muscle building steroids with the weight loss drugs will eliminate the loss of muscle. Walgreens can achieve a first mover advantage in this category and generate billions of dollars in sales. This is truly an untapped market opportunity for Walgreens. Walgreens should offer their own private label steroids where possible.\n\nWalgreens should come to market with as many of their own branded generic drugs as possible. This has substantial revenue possibilities.\n\nWalgreens should partner with 7-Eleven, Casey's, Alimentation Couche-Tard, etc., to design a pharmacy program specific to the needs of convenience stores and their customers. This has significant potential for Walgreens.\n\nWalgreens should turn their stores into distribution centers by forming a partnership with Uber, DoorDash, and other last mile delivery providers. Walgreens will need to greatly improve their inventory optimization and replenishment capability to keep shelves stocked with products so when customers place orders online, there are products in the store to fulfill the order. I think Walgreens will struggle to fulfill orders from stores. If so, opening micro-fulfillment centers among a cluster of stores is a better strategy.\n\nWalgreens is making a mistake by not offering their own high-quality private label groceries. Walgreens should explore the use of private label products as much as possible to reduce costs for consumers and maximize margins.\n\nWalgreens should also explore the use of mobile vehicles that consumers can hail to arrive at their home or apartment. The vehicles would be mobile pharmacies stocked with the top selling products and also able to deliver medications in secured compartments.\n\nWalgreens should utilize the integrated store planning and shelf optimization software from the company 345 Global. Walgreens must maximize sales in their stores and the platform from 345 Global will give them the best strategy for doing so.\n\nWalgreens should approach Kroger and discuss how Walgreens can provide Kroger (and Albertsons if the merger is approved) with a best in class pharmacy. Kroger and Walgreens have worked together in the past on different initiatives. I believe discussing how Walgreens can merge with Kroger and Albertsons should be discussed. Walgreens can approach other grocery retailers as well if a deal can't be made with Kroger.\n\nWalgreens must also find a way to establish a relationship with Gen Z. There are many things that the company can do but for some reason, Gen Z is invisible to the senior executives at Walgreens. TikTok, TikTok, TikTok. What is Walgreen's TikTok strategy? What is Walgreen's plan for creating influencers?\n\nAs stated earlier, one of the challenges faced by Walgreens is hiring and retaining pharmacists. Automation can reduce the need for pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and store labor. Walgreens must pursue every opportunity to introduce digital/tele pharmacists where possible. Walgreens must imagine a new pharmacy experience powered by automation, AI, and leading edge digital and telehealth technology.\n\nWalgreens has opened 11 micro-fulfillment centers (MFC) to automate filling prescriptions and has plans to open a total of 22 MFCs. However, based on sources, Walgreens is struggling to achieve the desired savings and efficiencies gains from the MFCs. Based on my analysis, Walgreens is using a subpar automated system that will limit the ability of the company to gain the desired efficiency and cost reductions. Automated micro-fulfillment centers should still play a role but the company must select a better solution.\n\nI strongly encourage Walgreens to assess outsourcing most if not all of their supply chain and logistics needs to Amazon or a third-party logistics company. Due to so many strategy and personnel changes over the years, and a habit of naming individuals with no supply chain and logistics experience to run the company's supply chain, Walgreens has excessive costs and complexity within their logistics network and operations. The company also lacks best in class technology, and appears to have no strategy for how to leverage their supply chain to enable growth.\n\nWalgreens recently appointed a new SVP, Chief Sourcing and Supply Chain Officer, Rajnish Kapur, who reports to Tracey Brown. Kapur has no end to to end supply chain, distribution, transportation, or inventory optimization experience. Sources have told me that Brown and Kapur, \"constantly contradict each other as it relates to strategy,\" and it's clear that Kapur, \"lacks the required leadership skills and experience necessary for the job.\" Sound familiar?\n\nBased on my experience, Walgreens is losing hundreds of millions of dollars annually as a result of their sub-optimized supply chain. Walgreens must either hire a qualified and competent Chief Supply Chain Officer, or the company must outsource their supply chain and logistics to Amazon or a 3PL.\n\nWalgreens isn't changing the company with their strategy, they're merely rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic. The appointment of Kapur, for example, will do nothing to improve Walgreens supply chain. In fact, I believe it will only make things worse for the company.\n\nA phrase I heard often when researching this article was, \"No one is in charge at Walgreens.\" Rosalind Brewer wasn't in charge as she lacked the experience and industry knowledge to transform Walgreens. Rosalind didn't motivate and inspire Walgreens associates, she merely alienated associates and forced them to choose sides in an internal culture war that should never have been fought. The culture war will continue inside Walgreens until a competent CEO puts an end to the company's DEI initiatives. (According to the latest research, over 70% of companies that implemented DEI programs within the last three years have ended the use of DEI and terminated their executives focused exclusively on diversity and inclusion.)\n\nStefano Pessina's involvement with Walgreens is referred to collectively inside the company as, \"The Hostile Takeover.\" Championing DEI, allowing the company to falter across all areas, supporting the hiring of Brewer while allowing multiple executives, mostly hires of Brewer, to remain in the company even though their behavior and inability to do their job should have gotten them fired, has created the perception that Pessina, \"doesn't care about WBA.\"\n\nGinger Graham is a Walgreens insider who has served on the WBA Board since 2010. Graham isn't viewed positively or negatively inside the company. She is viewed merely as having little authority because of Pessina. Graham also lacks the experience to transform Walgreens and no one is expecting Graham to do anything big.\n\nThe future of Walgreens will be determined by what happens over the coming months. Does the WBA Board take my advice and launch an investigation into the topics I highlight in this article, or does the board maintain the status quo and do nothing at all? Does the WBA Board insist that Walgreens hire the most qualified and experienced CEO, or does the board support the hiring of another DEI candidate that lacks experience and leadership? Does the WBA Board relocate Walgreens headquarters from Chicago, IL to Texas?\n\nWalgreens is in a world of hurt but it's not too late to save Walgreens from itself. All it will take is courage, grit, and leadership...and for someone to be in charge.\n\nNow What?\n\nAt the top of the list, Walgreens must hire a competent and qualified CEO to run the company. By \"qualified\" I mean that the CEO must have extensive healthcare, pharmacy, PBM, insurance, operations, and M&A experience; at least 20 to 30 years of industry experience. Walgreens needs a CEO who can assess every aspect of the organization and identify a strategy for growing Walgreens or selling the company.\n\nWalgreens also needs a much better team and process for M&A. I have been told multiple times that the person responsible for M&A is, \"slow and inexperienced.\"\n\nIn my opinion, Walgreens should consider these options:\n\nOption 1.\n\nInstead of immediately hiring another CEO, I believe Ginger Graham and Stefano Pessina, should contact Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon, and propose that Amazon acquire Walgreens.\n\nHumana, United Healthcare, or Cigna may have an interest in acquiring Walgreens.\n\nOption 2.\n\nFind a buyer for their retail operations. Walgreens can run their pharmacies and health clinics, and another company can run Walgreens retail stores. Walgreens would lease the stores, not sell them. Amazon should be at the top of the list as a potential buyer. Kroger is buried with their attempted merger with Albertsons so they're unable to take over Walgreens retail operations. Starbucks, ByteDance, Target, Shopify, and many other retailers would be interested in operating the stores.\n\nNote: Unless Walgreens is willing to hire a qualified executive to design a new retail store strategy, invest in the right technology, and significantly improve store operations and replenishment, Walgreens should sell their retail store front end. On another note, Walgreens should close all of their stores being impacted by theft in high crime cities.\n\nOption 3.\n\nOutsource the management of their supply chain, logistics, store replenishment, and automated MFCs that Walgreens built to fill prescriptions. Amazon is once again at the top of the list of companies that are most capable of meeting the needs of Walgreens. However, there are other 3PLs that are capable of managing Walgreens supply chain and operations. Note: As Walgreens closes stores, they will have to close distribution centers as well. I anticipate that Walgreens will shutter two or three distribution centers in 2024.\n\nOption 4.\n\nBreak up the company. Spin off Boots from WBA and run Walgreens as a separate company. Selling Boots will make it easier and more attractive for Amazon to acquire Walgreens. Regardless of what happens with Amazon, Boots should be sold.\n\nThe Best Option for Walgreens is selling the company to Amazon. Is it the best option for Amazon? No, but it's an option worth considering.\n\nBarbarian At The Gate - Stefano Pessina\n\nAfter this article was posted, individuals inside Walgreens reached out to me to say that I, \"didn't fully understand what was going on inside the company.\" Among the things I was told is that, \"Pessina isn't interested in building Walgreens into a better company. Pessina only wants to suck the cash out of the company.\" Listening to the individuals who reached out to me reminded me of the book, Barbarians At The Gate, about the leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco.\n\nAccording to a Walgreens spokesperson, \"The engagement letter Mr. Pessina signed when he joined the board in 2015 shows that Mr. Pessina did not take a salary. The vast majority of Mr. Pessina's remuneration comes from long-term share options, and is aligned with the company's other shareholders. Mr. Pessina does have a significant stake in the company, but he receives the same dividend per share as every other investor.\"\n\nI was also told that, \"Pessina hired Rosalind Brewer as a way to get the U.S. Government off of his back.\" Walgreens continues to face many legal troubles related to the opioid epidemic and the company's role in filling millions of prescriptions which made the epidemic worse. Walgreens is also facing issues related to their relationship with Theranos. Supposedly, members of the Biden administration agreed to back off pursuing more severe charges against Walgreens in exchange for what can only be described as a commitment by Pessina to make the company more woke and increasing the number of diversity hires inside Walgreens.\n\nAccording to a Walgreens spokesperson, \"This is untrue and unfounded. Last November, Walgreens agreed to pay about $5.7B to resolve opioid lawsuits, without admitting wrongdoing; more than the $5B agreed to be paid by CVS.\"\n\nPessina informed Brewer that she could hire whoever she wanted as long as they increased diversity in the company. Pessina also stressed that Brewer \"must follow his instructions to the letter regarding strategy\" according to sources. Among the instructions given to Brewer was, \"Don't waste capital. Cut costs. You'll receive a portion of what the company saves.\" Stated another way, Brewer's job was be a CEO in name only. I was told that Brewer signed a contract with Pessina that outlined her duties. (A review of the executives hired while Brewer was CEO proves that supporting DEI initiatives was more important than hiring the best talent.)\n\nIn return for Brewer keeping the agreement confidential, she was given a substantial pay package and severance agreement. Brewer was paid $9M in severance and she will receive a monthly consulting fee of $375,000 through February 29, 2024, to assist with the selection and hiring of a new CEO. (I find this part of the story troubling. In my experience as a consultant, I've never seen a company terminate a CEO only to retain the CEO to help the company find their replacement. I don't believe Brewer should have any involvement in selecting the next CEO.)\n\nI was unable to independently verify the information I was told about Pessina and his relationship with Brewer. Therefore, I strongly encourage the board of directors at Walgreens to contract a forensic accounting firm and a legal firm (follow the money) to investigate the claims.\n\nConclusion\n\nI have shared this document for the purpose of encouraging Walgreens to investigate the issues that I've raised. So many current and former employees of Walgreens voluntarily shared their stories and information with me that I owe it to Walgreens to ensure that they're aware of the issues that were raised in this newsletter, and to give Walgreens an opportunity to investigate, audit, validate, refute and/or correct any issues they uncover. Among the individuals from Walgreens who contacted me were corporate attorneys; that's when I realized how bad things are inside Walgreens.\n\nThis article was reviewed by Walgreens. I voluntarily added information that was provided to me by a Walgreens spokesperson to correct information that was false and unclear in the article. I appreciate the spokesperson reviewing the article to make sure that everything contained in the article is accurate based on Walgreen's review.\n\nI mean no malice or harm to anyone mentioned in the article. I have not slandered anyone in the article. If anyone named in the article disputes anything I wrote, please contact me. I will correct any information that is misleading or false. The comments in quotation marks and all content in this article were provided to me by multiple individuals from Walgreens. Many people from Walgreens have contacted me to state that the article is accurate. I had no prior relationship with anyone from Walgreens who contacted me. As an analyst and journalist, I chose to write the article due to the importance of the subject matter, and to make Walgreens aware of the severity of the issues inside their company.\n\nI do not work for Walgreens nor do I own any Walgreens stock. I do not have a personal or business relationship with any competitors of Walgreens. I do not own stock in any competitors of Walgreens."
