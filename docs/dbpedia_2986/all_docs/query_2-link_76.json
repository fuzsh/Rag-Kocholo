Walgreens Boots Alliance filed today (7 August) Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that confirms that they are considering a VillageMD sale. On page 2, Walgreens is considering the “sale of all or part of the VillageMD businesses, possible restructuring options and other strategic opportunities.”\n\nThe broad reason why is that VillageMD has “substantial ongoing and expected future cash requirements”. The specific event is VillageMD’s default as of 2 August on the VillageMD Secured Loan, a senior secured term loan and credit facility amounting to $2.25 billion. Currently (6 August), the loan is in a forbearance agreement while the companies work out terms. The 8-K also reiterates that Walgreens “is actively engaged in discussions with VillageMD’s stakeholders and other third parties with respect to the future of its investment in VillageMD”.\n\nNone of this should be surprising given recent statements made by CEO Tim Wentworth on the dismal Q3 earnings call [TTA 2 July], disclosing that Walgreens plans to lower its Village MD ownership below a majority holding (currently 63%). This signaled a partial sale at least–and that Walgreens was giving up on VillageMD as an integral part of the company. Between the direct investment of $5.3 billion and subsidizing Village MD’s purchase of Summit Health/CityMD with an additional $3.5 billion plus development costs, the Village MD Money Pit has disappeared roughly $10 billion of Walgreens’ fisc. Closing 160 locations did not, and could not, unsink this ship. While VillageMD is not the only dark spot for Walgreens’ business (retail is crashing, pharmacy is going soft), the plunging stock price has kicked off multiple shareholder class action lawsuits.[TTA 17 July]\n\nIt’s going to be tough to find any buyer at all at even a fraction of what Walgreens invested. An industry analyst estimated VillageMD’s 2023 losses at $800 million last April. WBA took a writedown last quarter, a $12.4 billion non-cash impairment charge related to VillageMD goodwill. Cigna also wrote off $1.8 billion of its 2022 $2.2 billion investment which gave it a ‘in the teens’ share [TTA 2 May]. Even CVS is trying to amortize its $10.6 billion buy of its own Money Pit–much smaller Oak Street Health–by finding a joint venture private equity partner [TTA 29 May].\n\nThis filing, coupled by the announcement of a third sale of Cencora stock to generate cash [TTA 7 Aug], points to no end in sight of Walgreens’ troubles. The SEC filing took place after markets closed; investors can expect a very down morning in an unstable market. Crain’s Chicago Business, Forbes\n\nMidweek wrap: Walgreens sells off $1.1B Cencora shares, R1 RCM goes private for $8.9B, Steward’s unwinding with 2 hospital closures, 1,200+ laid off, $30M state funding, bids due for physician group, CEO Senate hearing\n\nRetrenching is the theme this (crazy) week.\n\nWalgreens sells another 2% of Cencora shares, raising $1.1 billion of much-needed cash. Walgreens reduced its ownership share of the drug distributor formerly known as Amerisource Bergen to 10% by selling the remainder of their unencumbered shares, approximately 2% of the common stock. Known as a Rule 144 sale of restricted or control stock, the proceeds as of 1 August are $818 million followed by a concurrent share repurchase by Cencora of $250 million. This is the third sale this year: in May Walgreens sold 1% for $400 million and in February 2% for $990 million. All these sales were to fund operations and pay down debt. Despite the further reduction, Ornella Barra, COO International of Walgreens Boots Alliance, will continue on Cencora’s board. The partnership agreement remains in place. Release, Healthcare Dive, Reuters\n\nRevenue cycle management company R1 RCM finally found investors to take it private. TowerBrook Capital Partners and Clayton, Dubilier and Rice are the winners, acquiring R1 for $8.9 billion. They will purchase outstanding shares at $14.30 per share in an all-cash deal expected to close by the end of 2024. Private equity investor TowerBrook already owns 36% of the company. This shuts out rival New Mountain Capital as their 23 February bid was offered at a lower $13.75 per share. At that time, New Mountain owned 32%; that bid valued the company at nearly $6 billion. The purchase will be financed with a combination of committed debt financing and equity from investment funds affiliated with TowerBrook and CD&R. Large shareholders Ascension Health Alliance (also R1’s major customer) and Coliseum Capital Management were not mentioned in the acquisition release.\n\nIn March, a special committee was formed by their board to evaluate strategic alternatives, code for ‘we believe it’s undervalued’. The company is currently traded on Nasdaq and closed today at $13.96. R1 closed 2023 profitably with net income of $3.3 million, flipping a $63 million 2022 loss, on a revenue increase of nearly 25% to $2.3 billion. Q1 and Q2 2024 are a more mixed picture. Q1 had revenue of $603.9 million, up 11% year-over-year, but with a net loss of $35.1 million caused in part by $10 million in losses created by the Change Healthcare ransomware attack. Q2 continued the trend, with revenues of $627.9 million up 12% versus prior year, but a widening net loss of $7.6 million versus $1 million in the prior year. Q2 earnings release, Q1 earnings release, FierceHealthcare, Healthcare Dive\n\nSeeking ‘strategic alternatives’ for current investors and going private seems to be the new fashion in the crowded healthcare business process outsourcing (BPO) and RCM sectors. Profitable but problematic companies such as Veradigm [TTA 28 May] and GeBBS [TTA 17 Apr] both up for sale or investment. To date, Veradigm has not gone public with any offers, but GeBBS was scheduled last month to have binding offers submitted by Carlyle Group, Hillhouse Investment, and CVC Capital Partners. ChrysCapital, India’s largest private equity firm, owns 80% of GeBBS. Economic Times (India)\n\nThe messy unwinding of Steward Health Care in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas continues.\n\nThe court approved the closure of two Massachusetts hospitals, Carney Hospital in Dorchester and Nashoba Valley Medical Center in Ayer, at the end of August. Neither hospital received qualifying bids in the sale process and both hospitals, serving primarily low-income patients, are among the worst performers in Steward’s anemic portfolio.\n\nBased on WARN notices filed with the state, over 1,200 people will lose their employment as well as communities losing services.\n\nYesterday, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts agreed to provide $30 million to keep the six remaining hospitals in the state running in two tranches: $11.3 million on 9 August and $18.7 million on 16 August.\n\nThose hospitals are being handed over to NYC-based Apollo Global Management, a global alternative asset manager, to facilitate their sale from current landlords Medical Properties Trust and partner Macquarie Infrastructure Partners to new operators.\n\nAuctions pushed forward include the Arizona hospitals, with a new bid deadline of 12 August with a 19 August sale objection deadline and a 22 August sale hearing. Other hospitals in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Arkansas, and Louisiana have not been rescheduled after their canceled auctions.\n\nThe Stewardship Health practice group now has a bid deadline of 6 August, with the sale objection deadline now 9 August and the sale hearing set for 13 August. Optum walked away from its deal back in April with the Chapter 11 filing and there is no word if they are bidding in bankruptcy.\n\nAdditional updates: the Senate investigation of Steward is going forward with a subpoena issued to CEO Ralph de la Torre. The public hearing of the HELP Committee and his appearance are scheduled for 12 September. FierceHealthcare No further developments in the US Attorney’s Boston office investigation of violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act about Steward’s business dealings in Malta between 2018 and 2023. One wonders whether Dr. de la Torre will sail off on his 190-foot superyacht to one of the few places where extradition is difficult, such as Ecuador, Bolivia, Venezuela, or Iceland.\n\nHealthcare Dive, Becker’s 31 July, Becker’s 6 August Most recently in TTA 2 July, 18 July, 25 July\n\nNews roundup: Waystar $1B IPO is on (updated); CVS looking for Oak Street PE partner; 23andMe net loss doubles to $667M, may go private; Otsuka dives into digital therapeutics; HoneyNaps’ $12M no snooze\n\nWaystar finally getting around to starring in its IPO. Again. The on-again/off-again public offering for this healthcare payments software platform developer is back on, according to their Form S-1 filed yesterday (28 May) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Their first filing draft was in October 2023 on Nasdaq which would have valued the company at $8 billion. The IPO was again revived in December and postponed. This filing for WAY floats 45 million shares valued between $20 and $23 which would raise $1 billion with a far more reasonable valuation of $3.7 to $3.83 billion (latter updated per Waystar). Lead book-running managers are JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, and Barclays.\n\nCornerstone investors, who purchase stock before the formal listing, have expressed interest in buying up to $225 million in shares; these investors include funds managed by Neuberger Berman and a wholly-owned subsidiary of sovereign wealth fund Qatar Investment Authority.\n\nUnderwriters have a 30-day option to purchase up to 6.75 million shares at the IPO price less the underwriter discount. Their current investors are EQT AB, Bain Capital, Francisco Partners, and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. The net proceeds from the offering will repay outstanding indebtedness. No timing is stated for when the IPO will happen. Usually, there are roadshows for institutional investors that showcase the prospectus (in the S-1) and positive points such as their $5 billion in annual transactions. After the listing, the current investors will still have substantial shares: EQT, CPPIB, and Bain will own about 29.2%, 22.3%, and 16.8% stakes respectively.\n\nRelease, Morningstar, FierceHealthcare, Reuters\n\nCVS Health is reaching out for a private equity partner to expand Oak Street Health’s clinics. Bloomberg News reported this unusual move by CVS with a handful of private equity firms to explore what was termed by ‘insiders’ as a joint venture. It’s all very preliminary and a JV may not be the final form. OSH is far smaller than rivals One Medical (Amazon) and VillageMD (Walgreens) but CVS apparently does not want to go it alone to fully take on the development cost. On February investor calls, CVS projected building out to 300 clinics by 2026. Reuters\n\nEven in early 2023 with rivals Amazon (One Medical), Walgreens (VillageMD), and Walmart Health on primary care clinic buying and building binges, CVS’ buy for $10.6 billion for the ‘runt of the litter’ was widely derided as a waste of money [TTA 16 Feb, 2 Mar 2023]. OSH had only 169 offices in 21 states. It was also a money loser, $510 million in the red in 2022 and $200 million projected in 2023, with no breakeven predicted until 2025. A large part was due to OSH’s patient population, heavily skewed towards Medicare Advantage and underserved, high-risk patients. Those factors have gotten worse, not better. CMS has now tightened payments on MA with new rates and on reimbursement for diagnoses, making the growth of this population even riskier. Further dimming prospects for a willing partner: Walmart Health is shutting at end of June and VillageMD has shed or is shedding 140 locations to perhaps 620.\n\n23andMe’s losses double while revenue shrinks by 31%. Things continue to dim at the beleaguered genetics testing company. Their Q4 ending 31 March 2024 (FY24) closed with a net loss of $209 million on $64 million in revenue, compared to a net loss of $64 million on $94 million in revenue in the prior year Q4. In adjusted EBITDA, Q4 lost $33 million, compared to a loss of $39 million in prior year Q4. Net loss in full year FY24 was $667 million on revenue of $220 million, versus prior year’s loss of $312 million on revenue of $299 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $176 million versus prior year’s $161 million. As previously reported [TTA 20 Apr], CEO and co-founder Anne Wojcicki may offer to buy out the 80% of shares she does not already own. In developments, 23andMe has introduced an ancestry feature called Historical Matches, three new genetic reports for 23andMe+ members covering breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer based on polygenic risk scores, and some clinical trials moving forward. 23andMe also lost revenue in mid-year from GSK’s expiring agreement, had an impairment relating to Lemonaid Health, and of course (but not mentioned here) their massive 6.9 million record data breach. Shares closed today at $0.61, slightly up from April’s lows. Release\n\nOtsuka America bucks the down trend, moves into digital therapeutics with Otsuka Precision Health. The Japanese pharmaceutical company’s US division is moving forward with a new digital health unit, Precision Health (OPH), headed by 14 year veteran Sanket Shah. Their first rollout later this summer will be based on the newly FDA-cleared Rejoyn, the first prescription digital therapeutic authorized for the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) symptoms. Rejoyn was developed in conjunction with Click Therapeutics. Mr. Shah and Otsuka are taking the longer view in terms of development, that future developments will be about both partnerships and solo effort, and that the road is long–and littered with the burnt-out shells of failed companies like Pear Therapeutics, Babylon Health, and way back to Happtique. Otsuka has had its own digital health learning experience. They partnered in 2017 with Proteus Digital Health’s smart pill tech for its Abilify MyCite anti-depressant. After abruptly ending the partnership, Otsuka bought the smart pill technology out of bankruptcy [TTA 19 Aug 2020].

Bloomberg and other sources on Monday reported that WBA is now once again searching for buyers for the UK-based Boots pharmacy chain. Earlier reports from end of 2023 into Q1 [TTA 5 March] that it was up for sale were later denied. WBA is at a preliminary stage in working with advisers to seek out some buyers.\n\nThe price will be steep. Boots’ estimated value is £7 billion (about $8.78 billion). One rumored possibility other than a sale is a UK IPO. The news sent WBA shares up by 5% during Monday trading to a close of $18.12. If a sale or spinoff does go through, it will bring to an end an unusual trans-Atlantic alliance for Walgreens, though other than some Boots beauty products in the No. 7 line, there’s little crossover between the two chains, at least here in the US. Reuters, Crain’s Chicago Business\n\nMeanwhile, back in the trenches, Walgreens’ Chicago-area pharmacists wrapped up on Friday a month-long protest at Walgreens’ Deerfield HQ. These actions, which have been rolling since last year, center around increased staff and hour cutbacks plus the rise of telepharmacy. This replaces pharmacists with technicians for filling prescriptions, with patient questions answered by a remote pharmacist via an iPad. Pharmacists represented by the National Pharmacists Association-Laborers’ International Union of North America (NPhA-LIUNA) have been working without a contract since last May. In the past seven years, they have received a 2% wage increase. The local dispute has been mirrored at Walgreens and CVS locations nationwide. Crain’s Chicago Business\n\nNews roundup: UHG CEO’s Bad Day at Capitol Hill; Kaiser’s 13.4M data breach; Walgreens’ stock beatup; Cigna writes off VillageMD; Oracle Cerner shrinks 50%; Owlet BabySat gets Wheel; fundings for Midi, Trovo, Alaffia, Klineo\n\nIt was a Bad Day at Boot (Capitol) Hill for UnitedHealth Group’s CEO Andrew Witty. On May Day, he was the Man In The Arena facing two Congressional grillings–the first from the Senate Finance Committee in the morning, and the second in the afternoon from the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. The precipitating event was the Optum/Change Healthcare data breach and system hacking by ALPHV/BlackCat, a disruption which is as of today not fully resolved. Millions of patients may have had data stolen and exposed–a number that has yet to be determined, but an outcome for which UHG, while paying the ransomwaristes, has prepared. Already, the VA has notified 15 million veterans and families of that possibility.\n\nThis Editor will be linking below to multiple articles and Mr. Witty’s prepared testimony. Interested Readers can also refer to YouTube for extensive links to video testimony. Highlights:\n\nBoth houses criticized the slow response and amount of financial assistance given to providers after the shutdown of Change’s systems prevented (and still is preventing) timely claims processing and payment. While ‘near normal’ volumes of medical claims and 86% restoration of payment processing sounds good, that leaves a lot of wiggle room on over two months of totally disrupted processing and payment. The billion or so cited sounds impressive but much of this is in loans. Most practices and groups simply do not have the financial cushion or billing skillset to bridge this disruption, to pay back loans, or to bookkeep this.\n\nAlso criticized at this late date was UHG being unable to determine how many individuals had PHI exposed in the breach.\n\nAs to cause, the description of UHG finding that surprise, surprise, Change’s systems were way out of date, stored on physical servers versus the cloud, and used Citrix remote access without multi-factor authentication (MFA) was utterly savaged. According to Mr. Witty, ALPHV after days of knocking around got in on the one server that did not have MFA authentication.\n\nThe blunt fact is that UHG had close to two years (January 2021-Oct 2022) before the buy closed. Due diligence consisting of a full audit had to have been done on Change’s IT systems. They processed what UHG wanted to buy. In this Editor’s estimation, Job #1! for UHG should have been ensuring that Change’s systems were hardened, then upgrading to what Mr. Witty called UnitedHealth’s standards. This Editor will go further. A minimum requirement for the sale should have been security hardening. There was time before the closing.\n\nSenator Thom Tillis, R-North Carolina, had the best riposte. He brought a copy of “Hacking for Dummies” to the hearing, highlighting MFA. I doubt he was much moved by UHG now bringing in cybersecurity company Mandiant to both investigate and harden their systems, nor by UHG having to pay ransom, without knowing whose data was compromised.\n\nBeyond the breach, UHG was called ‘monopolistic’ by both Republican and Democrat Members. There were calls to break up UHG as not ‘too big to fail’. UHG has grown by acquisition and consolidation of services. As this Editor has speculated, this is likely coming to an end with the new, much more stringent Merger Guidelines. This sentiment paints a large, unmissable target on UHG’s back for aiming FTC’s and DOJ’s missiles. (DOJ also has a huge score to settle with UHG dating back to the failure to block the Change sale.)\n\nBy the end of the day, Mr. Witty looked quite the worse for wear–tie and collar askew, slightly sweaty, versus the perfect poses of the various Members. Becker’s, FierceHealthcare, Axios, HealthcareDive Mr. Witty’s Senate testimony statement, House testimony statement\n\nSpeaking of data breaches, Kaiser Permanente reported a big one to Health and Human Services (HHS). This relates to ad tracker information shared with third-party advertisers such as Google, Microsoft, and X. Kaiser used it in secured areas of their website and mobile apps. Information disclosed could be name and IP. Kaiser reported it on 12 April but only disclosed on 25 April that 13.4 million records may have been affected. The ad trackers have since been removed. TechCrunch, FierceHealthcare\n\nWalgreens stock not recovering. April was WBA’s worst month in five years and May is no better, with the stock muddling around $17.50. The month slid around 18%. Their 52-week high was $33. As of now, CEO Tim Wentworth’s actions such as closing locations and writing down VillageMD haven’t convinced Mr. Market of WBA’s worth, but in fairness it’s early in his tenure. In the Insult to Injury Department, it was revealed that the IRS is seeking to claw back $2.7 billion in unpaid 2014-2017 taxes. Crain’s Chicago Business\n\nCigna is also writing down its interest in VillageMD. Almost forgotten is that in late 2022, Cigna invested $2.5 billion into VillageMD. They have now written down $1.8 billion of that ‘low teens’ ownership. The planned tie was connecting Village Medical into Evernorth, Cigna’s medical services area. It was also supposed to provide Cigna with an annual return on investment, but one assumes it did not. The writeoff threw Cigna’s Q1 into the red with a net loss of almost $300 million versus a prior year profit of $1.3 billion, despite a strong quarter that grew revenue 23% versus prior year to $57.3 billion.

Cerner itself reported 12,778 local full-time-equivalent employees in 2022.

Economic Times-India Times, HIStalk\n\nOpinion: Further thoughts on Teladoc, Amwell, and the future of telehealth–what happens next?\n\nThe end of last week marked an Apocalypse Light in telehealth, but it was coming in this Editor’s opinion. And Pepper the Robot has nothing to do with it, other than representing telehealth’s state, and perhaps this Editor’s.\n\nTwo events–the forced exit of 15-year CEO Jason Gorevic from Teladoc and both Teladoc’s and Amwell’s continued market weakness and long roads to breakeven, if ever–have caused many in the field to think hard about our direction and where telehealth is going.\n\nBoth Teladoc and Amwell are the pioneers in provider-to-patient telehealth, going back over 20 years. While Amwell is no longer the #2 to Teladoc’s #1, both were in the forefront of how remote consults have transformed healthcare. The ability to remotely diagnose and provide care at distance is now a ‘given’ that has shifted the baseline for providers, patients, and payers. Nearly every entrant has or has acquired a remote in-person or app feature, whether care management, diagnostics, health education, or telemental health.\n\nBecause Teladoc’s struggles are writ large in the industry, we might benefit from a closer look at What Happened–and what in this Editor’s opinion might happen next.\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nThe pandemic. Yes, it provided a major boost to any telehealth provider’s business whether corporate or provider-based. It mainstreamed telehealth. Smaller players like MDLive and Included Health snatched market share. But it also introduced ‘silly money’ that led companies to think that all they had to do was hold out the buckets, fill them with cash, and buy business. By late 2020, practices had reopened–and telehealth usage nosedived quickly, stabilizing to around 5% of medical claims, over 60% of which is mental health according to the FAIR Health end of 2023 telehealth tracker.\n\nThe integration of telehealth into multiple platforms is now commonplace. This Editor observed in her work with her then-employer in early 2020 that the population health platform they had introduced already had integrated HIPAA-compliant telehealth platforms as a module–all that was needed to get the practices up and running on it–and coding correctly. Health systems now integrate telehealth into their patient portals. EHRs even for the small practice market now have integrated telehealth. As mentioned, specialized telehealth such as telemental health took off during the pandemic and, after a cleanout period, have largely stayed with us. Asynchronous telehealth has also become acceptable to consumers. (Interestingly, the leading asynchronous diagnoses are for hypertension and respiratory diseases that benefit companies like Amazon Clinic and triage-type systems.)\n\nPeople use it when needed, but the enterprise payment model is subscriber-based. Teladoc has long claimed its subscriber base is 90 million people–but user data from HHS (ASPE 3/2023) indicates that only one of four use it. For an enterprise, paying for subscribers, this is a big fat line item ready to cut. Payers have also integrated telehealth into their coverage. Teladoc has, to its credit, created payer partnerships such as with Aetna, but so have others.\n\nBottom line: there’s no more ‘blue water’ market left for a big player like Teladoc with a model dependent on growth and on enterprise sales that are inherently price-driven. It’s a hard and painful change to realize that your technology is no longer the future, and that you have to slug it out in the mud with everyone else.\n\nA closer look at Teladoc.\n\nAfter 20 years, why wasn’t it profitable? A look back on our Teladoc coverage prior to the pandemic indicated growth was created by buying up smaller competitors, domestic and international, at premium prices. InTouch Health was a notable one, acquired January 2020 for $600 million. But Teladoc was way overdue on turning a profit before 2020, at which point it should have firmly moved into the black. And then reality hit by early 2022.\n\nWhere was the board in all this? This Editor does not pretend to know the minds of those far more experienced in the financial aspect of business than she. But after 15 years of CEO Jason Gorevic and the 2022 $6.6 billion write-down of Livongo which precipitated the long 90%+ loss in market value slide, why was he given walking papers only last Friday? Boards are supposed to be wise heads, looking out for the business and the shareholders. Did they get caught in the hype or hope that BetterHelp would save the company? Did something else happen? (Fun fact: Mr. Gorevic remains on the board.)\n\nA track record of flawed judgment and recovery. In December 2018, their COO/CFO was dismissed after charges of insider trading and sexual misconduct. There have been two COOs since then, the first, David Sides, moving to CEO of NextGen Healthcare in 2021. In May 2019, Teladoc’s NCQA accreditation, first won in 2013, was placed under an unusual “corrective action” by NCQA which was termed by the CEO ‘much ado about nothing’. Au contraire, it was a black eye at the time and the industry never quite knew what happened. And then there was Livongo….\n\nThe Livongo deal killed Teladoc; saying the quiet part out loud. As this Editor stated at the time, the $18.5 billion purchase price of Livongo was dangerous for Teladoc (see ‘Gimlet Eyes’ from August 2020 here and here). It was a too-fast too-much too-soon deal that closed in three months at the summer peak of the pandemic and lockdowns looking like forever. The very notion that Livongo would open doors in hospitals and cross-selling to enterprises was suspect even at the time. The deal that Gorevic and 7WireVentures’ Glen Tullman and Livongo CEO Zane Burke concocted was ‘Grand Theft Auto’–for Livongo and their leadership, especially if they sold their Teladoc shares. It was never a merger of equals nor was it additive in value. Teladoc then made multiple, continuing transitioning and management errors, including not retaining Livongo executives, which have been well documented. And again–where was the board on this?\n\nWhere are the analysts? They seem to accept a storyline that ‘all is OK’ for 2024 now that Gorevic is gone. But standing pat on the Q1 and 2024 guidance as nearly all have done is suspect. Unlike Amwell, Teladoc has not forecast when it will achieve breakeven, much less profitability.\n\nWhat’s Next? Given all the above, when will the aftershocks hit? Sooner or later?\n\nIf one looks to Walgreens as an example, where disaster hit quickly and hard last summer, a board member, Ginger Graham, took the acting CEO position. She took front and center on investor calls and executing reorganizations, which for an interim is unusual. Almost immediately, the cleanout began at the CIO and CFO levels and moved downward. Tim Wentworth joined as CEO in mid-October 2023 seven weeks after Roz Brewer was separated. VillageMD was identified quickly as a large part of the problem. He took the writedown even before locations were fully closed and made multiple moves to cut costs starting at the corporate level before moving into the field. This is not to make light of the human damage and the jury remains out on the wisdom of some of the moves. But Wentworth has moved quickly, decisively, and positioned it realistically in saying ‘this is not a 12-month turnaround’ and wisely caveating that board alignment around the strategic review was essential. Timid he is not.\n\nTeladoc needs to move quickly, and intelligently–now, not later. While acting CEO Mala Murthy, backed by the board, makes decisive moves, Teladoc must find and appoint a Tim Wentworth-type at the helm for the turnaround. Quickly. It’s important not only for Teladoc but also for the telehealth industry. But neither Mr. Market, judging on share price, nor this Editor, based on their track record, are hopeful.\n\nWalgreens’ latest cuts affect 646 at Florida, Connecticut distribution centers\n\nWalgreens closes two distribution centers to ‘streamline capacities to best support our stores’. Two large centers serving Walgreens retail stores, in Orlando, Florida and Dayville (Killingly), Connecticut, are closing permanently in May, with workers discharged on or before 17 May. Affected are 324 workers in Orlando and 322 workers in Dayville who according to Walgreens will receive severance, additional separation pay, on-site career fairs, and/or outplacement services. While workers in Orlando have a better employment situation locally with unemployment at 3%, Dayville, in northeastern Connecticut’s rural Windham County near the Rhode Island border, is up to 5%. WARN notices were filed in both states about 14 March. Crain’s Chicago Business, Becker’s\n\nPress accounts do not mention corresponding closures of Florida or New England Walgreens stores. The puzzle is that Florida, particularly central Florida, is a growing market with a permanent population as well as seasonal/tourism. Yet all 52 Village Medical co-located offices have closed in that state [TTA 22 Feb]. Reasons why range from too small co-locations unable to support full practices to lack of doctors and medical saturation.\n\nWalgreens, after several quarters of losses, is cutting to the bone expenses, with layoffs, consolidations, and closures everywhere from their Illinois headquarters to VillageMD. Despite the $1 billion in cuts for 2024 announced last October, Mr. Market is not responding–Walgreens’ stock price continues its downward trend and has lost 15% sharply since January. The new CEO Tim Wentworth has already positioned Walgreens’ recovery as ‘not a 12-month turnaround story’. Walgreens, over the past three years, drilled a lot of holes. Some worked out well, such as Shields, but the $10 billion investment in VillageMD may be a dry hole. In the strategic review he announced earlier this month, Boots may be on the block, not Shields, but there will be more and deeper cuts to come–if WBA’s closely held ownership agrees. Based on the distribution center closures, expect more closures of retail locations served by those centers to be announced.\n\nFacing Future: Walgreens CEO moves company into strategic review–will he get WBA board alignment?\n\nWalgreens’ CEO Wentworth positions for turnaround. “This is not a 12-month turnaround story” said Mr. Wentworth at the TD Cowen healthcare investor conference. To this Editor, the public honesty and lack of cant (a/k/a “PR Speak”) was refreshing. His unobvious caveat though was aligning the board around what he and the new executive team–very few if any carryovers from the prior regime–see as the direction of the company and asset management.\n\nThe WBA board is led by executive chairman Stefano Pessina, who has a vested interest in a turnaround. He is the lead individual shareholder of WBA with apparently 10% of shares with other insiders (including the COO of WBA International, Ornella Barra, spouse of Mr. Pessina) having about 17%. Large institutional investors (Vanguard, State Street, etc.) have over 60% of the company. The share price has fallen about 40% in the past year (from early March 2023) and 55% from this time in 2022. (Derived from WBA and Yahoo Finance)\n\nExample: This Editor has estimated from public information that Walgreens sank north of $10 billion into VillageMD, from initial and then controlling interest, then funding the buy of Summit Health/CityMD. This is a huge and recent investment that is going sideways in a span of less than three years. It does take some nerve to walk it back. TTA 22 Feb\n\nOther key points Mr. Wentworth made, according to the most complete report in Crain’s Chicago Business, was that this was not a prelude to some massive unveiling of a New Walgreens, that it would be a ‘starting gun’ for the work to be done, and that investors would be updated through the process. The review will include:\n\nEvaluating its 8,000+ location footprint based on current and projected population and type of usage\n\nUS Healthcare assets including the already shrinking VillageMD [TTA 29 Feb], home care benefit management services primarily for payers CareCentrix, and specialty pharmacy Shields Health Solutions.\n\nShields is apparently no longer up for sale per earlier reports but Boots now may be\n\nSmaller assets around clinical trials and pharmacy fulfillment centers\n\nThe next earnings call is 28 March, when undoubtedly more will be revealed.\n\nFierceHealthcare caught up to this as well.\n\nEditor’s POV on ‘musts to avoid’: Walgreens’ chief medical officer, Dr. Sashi Moodley, was interviewed during ViVE24 by Mobihealthnews, It is only remarkable in how he sidestepped direct questions beyond the first two lengthy ones on a virtual care initiative, generating a fog of non-answers around VillageMD closures and corporate strategy that became peasoup thick by the last question. (Kudos to Jessica Haden for not going wobbly.) The dubious wisdom of placing a C-level in front of the press at a ‘hard and tough news’ time, one whose expertise is clinical in nature, most comfortable in speaking to that and not corporate strategy, plus evidently has a hard time editing/limiting responses, should be rethought.\n\nBreaking: VillageMD exiting Illinois clinics–in its home state–as closures top 80 locations\n\nVillageMD to cut six locations in the Chicago area–five standalone, one attached to a Walgreens store. The clinics will close on 19 April.\n\nThe irony is that VillageMD is headquartered in Chicago.\n\nIn October, Walgreens announced that 60 Village Medical clinics would close. The Florida closings announced last week were in two phases, 14 and 38, a total of 52. With Illinois, the total would be 58. However, Crain’s Chicago Business stated late on Wednesday in its article that 12 Massachusetts locations closed in February. Last month, three locations in New Hampshire and all 12 Indiana clinics closed, bringing the total to 85.\n\nThis story will be updated as it develops.\n\nRoundup: Walgreens’ new chief legal officer; Digital Health Collaborative launched; fundings/M&A defrosting for b.well, R1 RCM, Abridge, Reveleer; Veradigm likely delists, buys ScienceIO–mystery?

Leavitt Equity Partners led the raise which tops up b.well’s funding to $98.8 million. Their last funding round was a $32 million Series B in July 2021 with HLM Venture Partners as the lead. b.well markets its FHIR-enabled Connected Health platform to unify healthcare data, solutions, and services for end users at payers, providers, and employers. Joining the board are three new members: Andrew Clark, Managing Partner at Leavitt Equity Partners, Ryan Howells, Principal at Leavitt Partners and Executive Director of the CARIN Alliance, as an independent director, and Hon Pak, MD, Head of Digital Health at Samsung.

An investor group led by New Mountain Capital is offering to take the revenue cycle management (RCM) company private to buy up shares they do not already own at $13.75 per share. New Mountain holds 32.43% of shares and is working with an investment group that includes another major shareholder TCP-ASC (TowerBrook Capital Partners that has a 29.64% stake, plus Ascension Health Alliance–Ascension accounts for nearly half of R1’s income), putting them at over 62% if TowerBrook goes all in. Mr. Market has weighed in and says that the offer price is already obsolete. It represented a tidy premium to Friday’s close at $11.10, but the current trading on Nasdaq is well above the bid at $14.45. Current shareholders such as Coliseum Capital Management LLC, one of the five largest shareholders, have already stated to the board that the company is undervalued at the offer price. R1 traded in the $18 as recently as last summer, but hit a headwind at end of year with the loss of customer Pediatrix on implementation issues. But based on their 2023 performance despite this, the other investors are making a good case. R1 RCM is the largest publicly traded RCM company for hospitals and healthcare systems. They closed 2023 profitably with net income of $3.3 million, flipping a $63 million 2022 loss, on a revenue increase of nearly 25% to $2.3 billion.

Release\n\nVeradigm nears a delisting on Nasdaq due to reporting–but plans acquisition of ScienceIO, in what has to be a first. The continuing delisting watch on Veradigm (the former Allscripts) is fading to black with the company anticipating its failure to file needed financial statements with Nasdaq. Its stock continues to decline (today at $7.32 as of noon ET).\n\nSince March 2023, Veradigm has had trouble with required reports due to faulty financial software and has begged extension after extension. The required reports due by Tuesday 27 February are for 2023 quarterlies on form 10-Q and its annual 2022 report on form 10-K.\n\nVeradigm is also facing a slew of shareholder lawsuits on the decline in its share price [TTA 3 Jan]. To counter this, Veradigm announced today (27 Feb) that the board of directors is adopting a limited duration stockholder rights plan that issues by means of a dividend one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of Company common stock to stockholders of record on the close of business on 8 March 2024. This becomes exercisable only if a person or group secures beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the outstanding shares in the next year. The rights plan is obviously designed to compensate shareholders in the event of a takeover not approved by the board (i.e. a hostile takeover) via accumulation of stock and make a sale to an unapproved buyer less attractive. Release, MarketWatch/WSJ\n\nApparently Veradigm is healthy and profitable, according to analysts reported in Healthcare Dive. The company estimated unaudited revenue between $608 million and $622 million for its fiscal year 2023. Net income from continuing operations is estimated between $49 million and $58 million, according to the filing. This, coupled with its business as a data company, further adds to the mystery around their reporting to Nasdaq.\n\nSimultaneous to the delisting, Veradigm announced today that it is acquiring yet another company, ScienceIO, that is (surprise!) an AI company. Veradigm will leverage ScienceIQs proprietary large language models on Veradigm’s rich data set and more. Acquisition cost of $140 million in cash (subject to customary adjustments for cash, indebtedness, working capital and transaction expenses) has approximately $44 million deferred, substantially all of which is payable in installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the closing date. Release\n\nThis is not the first acquisition that Veradigm has made with the delisting hanging. In January, Veradigm announced the acquisition of Koha Health, which specializes in orthopedic/musculoskeletal (MSK) revenue cycle management (RCM).\n\nUpdated 28 Feb: Nasdaq is delisting Veradigm effective 29 February. It will continue to trade OTC under MDRX until whatever time they become compliant with their reports. Veradigm is not appealing at this time. Healthcare Innovation. Veradigm release\n\nBreaking: Walgreens’ VillageMD shutting in Florida; Change Healthcare system websites cyberattacked (updated 23 Feb)\n\nThe New Reality Strikes Again. Walgreens is closing all VillageMD locations in Florida. In addition to the 14 already closed, an additional 38 will be shuttered on 15 March for a total of 52. These are all co-located and attached to Walgreens locations (left).\n\nFlorida was a major expansion market for co-located clinics and its third largest market following Texas and Arizona) according to a report by investment analyst Jefferies. In October, Walgreens announced the closure of 60 Village Medical locations in ‘non-strategic locations’. In January, CEO Tim Wentworth confirmed that about half of those locations were already closed. Doing the math, the rest of those locations will be in Florida. Updated–see 29 February\n\nEvidently, Walgreens’ US Healthcare unit views Florida as non-supportable to warrant a drastic move like this in a growing population market. Business Insider, which appears to have an inside track on this from the Jefferies report, “theorized” that many of these Village Medical locations were actually inside pharmacies–too small to attract patients and to recruit primary care doctors. If this is true, for a company that prides itself on retail know-how, as in the old real estate saw ‘location-location-location’, it has made a major and costly misstep.\n\nWalgreens has sunk close to $9 billion into VillageMD: $5.2 billion for the majority stake and another $3.5 billion to aid with the Summit Health/CityMD buy. This does not include the earlier minority investment in VillageMD, so the total is likely well north of $10 billion. It all looked very different in 2020 when it was ‘go big or go home’. One wonders if VillageMD / Village Medical or its parts are on the selling block along with Shields Health if Walgreens has decided on a major strategic change. Healthcare Dive\n\nAnd another Reality is Cyberattack. Revenue cycle management and leading patient payment processor Change Healthcare is the latest victim. It notified users that it was disconnecting systems hours after Wednesday morning Eastern Time when it noticed disruptions to some applications that grew into “enterprise-wide connectivity issues.” The disruption is continuing into today (Thursday 22 Feb). There are few public specifics other than the timing and confirmation of the attack as of now, but it appears to have reached down to the local pharmacy level, into providers of all sizes, and shut down nearly every Change Healthcare system. This Editor visited the main website, which appears altered (shrunken); attempts to go to connecting links go to blank screens. Optum is not disclosing further information and perhaps shouldn’t at this point. Change Healthcare is part of UnitedHealth Group’s Optum and processes 15 billion transactions a year filled with PHI and PII, which adds to the scariness factor. TechCrunch, Becker’s, HealthITSecurity This is a developing story and will be updated\n\nUpdate 22 Feb: HISTalk reports that athenahealth customers are also affected, as their electronic data interchange is supported by Change Healthcare technology.\n\nUnitedHealth Group said in an SEC filing that a “suspected nation-state associated cybersecurity threat actor” gained access to Change Healthcare’s information technology systems. It “cannot estimate the duration or extent of the disruption at this time.” UnitedHealth has retained security experts and was working with law enforcement. As of Thursday evening, the disruption continues and affects pharmacies nationwide in an inability to process insurance claims for prescriptions. Healthcare services are also being disrupted, said an unnamed director at a regional hospital system in Pennsylvania. Reuters\n\nUpdate 23 Feb: Further corroboration in Fox Business on the above and continuing effects on pharmacies. Tricare, which covers active and retired military, stated on its website in a news release that this is impacting all military pharmacies worldwide. “Military clinics and hospitals will provide outpatient prescriptions through a manual procedure” until the ongoing cyberattack against Change Healthcare “is resolved.”\n\nIn more unwelcome news that this cyberattack is ongoing, the American Hospital Association (AHA) is formally advising healthcare facilities to not only disconnect from Change/Optum, but also check their own IT for vulnerabilities. AHA notice.

Using the “realigning some resources to help accelerate our efforts” meme, there are about 115 to 400 staff who will be ‘transitioned’ out of their present jobs, according to sources (Business Insider, Seeking Alpha). Areas affected were not disclosed. However, the Amazon division likely taking the hardest hit is One Medical, according to these sources.\n\nAmazon has already announced that One Medical must reduce operating losses by $100 million this year. A large step they are taking is to close One Medical’s corporate offices in New York, Minneapolis, and St. Petersburg, Florida, reducing its San Francisco office space to one floor. They cited to industry publications that most employees are remote workers.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Amazon is targeting major cost reductions. Fixed operating costs that are currently at 41% of total revenue will be reduced to 20% by 2028. Cost per patient visit will be reduced from $372 in 2023 to $322 in 2024, from $372 in 2023.\n\nLegal, finance, and technology teams will report to Amazon’s healthcare business structure\n\nOperating areas will increase from four to seven, reporting to a new head of operations\n\nCFO Bjorn Thaler will move to a new position focused on growth initiatives, reporting to VP of Health Services Neil Lindsay\n\nAt the time of the acquisition, industry thinkers were wondering what Amazon would do with the money-losing One Medical clinics, for which they paid $3.9 billion but never turned a profit and lost $420 million in 2022, its last year of independent operations. Neither membership nor revenue has been reported since the 2023 closing. In 2022, One Medical had 700,000 patients, 8,000 company clients and 125 physical offices in 12 major US markets including NYC, Los Angeles, Boston, and Atlanta. Amazon has been promoting One Medical online and on TV, most aggressively to its Prime members with promotional membership pricing.\n\nAmazon has aggressively cut tens of thousands of jobs and costs since 2023 in its Audible, Prime Video, Twitch and Buy with Prime units, and completely shut down Halo, its entry in fitness bands and sleep trackers. It has also been aggressively challenged on patient privacy and cross-using information by the FTC, most recently around Amazon Clinic.\n\nNot mentioned in reporting was the FTC and DOJ scrutiny One Medical’s acquisition received between Amazon’s offer and the closing. The two agencies declined to move at that time [TTA 23 Feb 23], but FTC is continuing to build its case against Amazon–and One Medical may be a factor. For context on Amazon’s situation, Readers may want to review last December’s assessment of Amazon to date, Has Amazon lost its ‘edge’ in healthcare? Or finally seeing reality? FierceHealthcare, Healthcare Finance, Healthcare Dive\n\nWalgreens’ Reality includes C-suite reshuffles, scaring up cash. The new president of US Healthcare and EVP reporting to CEO Tim Wentworth is Mary Langowski. She is currently CEO of Solera Health. Her prior experience at CVS was as EVP and chief strategy and corporate development officer. Moving to an advisor position is the current president, John Driscoll. US Healthcare includes VillageMD, Summit Health/CityMD and CareCentrix. In addition, Manmohan Mahajan was appointed as permanent CFO, having held the position on an interim basis from July. Elizabeth Burger was named as EVP and chief HR officer from a similar position at industrial Flowserve, replacing Holly May who departed in November and is now with Petco. Crain’s Chicago Business, FierceHealthcare\n\nSlipping under this was a further sale of Walgreens’ position in Cencora, the former AmerisourceBergen, a highly diversified pharmaceutical distributor. The sale of approximately $942 million of Cencora common stock was subject to the completion of the Rule 144 sale, and included a concurrent share repurchase by Cencora of approximately $50 million for a total to WBA of $992 million. WBA’s position is now 13% versus 15%; partnership and board representation remains in place. From the WBA release, “Proceeds to Walgreens Boots Alliance will be used primarily for debt paydown and general corporate purposes, as the company continues to build out a more capital-efficient health services strategy rooted in its retail pharmacy footprint.”\n\nIs NeueHealth creating its own Reality? At the end of January, Bright Health Group faded to black and relit as NeueHealth, its value-based care medical practice division, and moved its HQ from poky, cold, failing Minneapolis to Doral, Florida. It sold or closed all its health plans in a heap of losses, most of which have bills coming due via CMS Repayment Agreements which come due on or before 14 March 2025. Most of the industry is shaking its head in wonder that NeueHealth has made it this far.\n\nThe discussion in MedCityNews is worth reading. It includes Ari Gottlieb of A2 Strategy who points out that the company is $1.4 billion in debt to the likes of investors Cigna Ventures, New Enterprise Associates, and CalSTRS. They owe $89 million to Texas to cover risk liabilities for its shuttered ACA plans. Over $100 million remains in escrow from the Molina sale to cover obligations from its Medicare Advantage plans. Mr. Gottlieb predicts that NeueHealth will be drained and go bankrupt before the Feds come calling in March 2025. Another analyst, Tyler Giesting, director of healthcare and life sciences at West Monroe, takes a sunnier view that NeueHealth is in a sector, value-based care, that payers are interested in and will buy into, as long as the practices perform. This Editor will reiterate her wonder at NeueHealth’s management maneuvers. They’ve managed to play multiple ends against the middle and tie masterful Gordian knots (pick your analogy) to stay alive until, they hope, 2025 and better times.\n\nMore Reality delivered in two layoffs in once-hot companies that thought pandemic les bon temps rouler would last forever:\n\nSan Diego-based Cue Health, a biotech company that produced Covid-19 tests, is laying off another 245 employees. This adds to the 884 workers in primarily San Diego laid off last year. Cue grew to over 1,500 employees when it got the first FDA approval for its 20-minute molecular test kits to supply the US government, the NBA, Google, and other large companies. Cue IPO’d in September 2021 at $200 million and $16/share, with a valuation of $3 billion. Its shares on Nasdaq are today at $0.25. The company also offers a test for mpox (monkeypox) and is seeking FDA approval for its RSV and Flu test kits. San Diego Union-Tribune\n\nNew York City-based Nomad Health, a healthcare staffing service that took advantage of the pandemic demand for travel nurses but had not fully transitioned into other temporary healthcare workers, released 17% of staff, from 691 to 572 employees. Nomad was reeling not only from lower demand but also correspondingly lower rates. It raised $200 million to date from investors such as Adams Street Partners and Icon Ventures. Forbes\n\nAnd the final Reality is how healthcare companies, from providers to digital health, are phrasing what seems to be endless layoffs. Euphemisms such as rightsizing, org change, involuntary career events, corporate outplacing, and offboarding are all being used to sweeten for public consumption that a lot of people, hired so eagerly in 2020-22, are losing their jobs. From the Bloomberg article (paywalled), “They somehow seem to believe that if they use language that is more vague and less emotional, that people won’t get as upset,” said Robert Sutton, PhD, professor of management science and organizational behavior with Stanford University School of Engineering. Instead, euphemisms tend to have the opposite effect. Becker’s This Editor has been both a survivor and a victim of same, being in marketing which is always vulnerable. Contract and consulting work, which anticipate a stronger market, are like the Sahara–few and dry water holes. Expect layoffs and a dead market for experienced talent to be a major factor in this year’s US elections, despite the reported low unemployment numbers (that no one believes anymore).\n\nNews roundup: Cano Health files Ch. 11 bankruptcy, delisted (updated), Walgreens lays off more, Allina Health outsources 2,000 RCM jobs to Optum\n\nCano Health’s telenovela moved to a Delaware court, where it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. This prearranged voluntary Chapter 11 was filed on Sunday 4 February in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. Based on this Editor’s reading of their release, it’s a prepackaged reorganization of this beleaguered primary care provider. It also promises an exit by Q2 2024. It features several parts that have to be approved by the Court in short order:\n\nA Restructuring Support Agreement (the “RSA”) with major lenders (the “Ad Hoc Lender Group”). They hold approximately 86% of Cano’s secured revolving and term loan debt and 92% of its senior unsecured notes. The RSA provides for the conversion of nearly $1 billion in secured debt to a combination of new debt and full equity ownership in the reorganized company. (See below as to what that means for Class A shareholders.)\n\nSecuring liquidity via a commitment for $150 million in new debtor-in-possession financing from certain of its existing secured lenders.\n\nIn addition, Cano itemized several ‘first day’ motions to ensure continuity of operations–these also have to be approved by the Court:\n\nPaying associate wages, including for its doctors and nurses, without interruption\n\nContinuing operations and honoring obligations to its affiliate physician groups\n\nEnsuring patients at its clinics continue to receive quality value-based healthcare\n\nSeeking authority to pay the existing pre-petition claims of certain vendors that are critical to the health and safety of Cano Health’s patients and critical to the operation of the Company’s medical centers.\n\nCano has authority to continue making ordinary course payments for all authorized goods and services provided on or after the filing date.\n\nEarlier actions by their CEO laid groundwork for this reorganization through selling off operations and divesting staff. In September, they sold their Texas and Nevada operations to CenterWell Senior Primary Care, a unit of Humana, for $66.7 million, and exited California, New Mexico and Illinois late last year, with Puerto Rico winding up this quarter. Cano also cut 21% of staff (842 people) by November .\n\nNo comfort for their common Class A shareholders, though. Shareholders approved a 1 share for 100 reverse share split to buoy price last December, though the NYSE had notified Cano on 29 December of delisting based on their market capitalization not meeting their standards. Cano’s shares stopped trading as of last Friday at $2.30. What is usual, and signaled by the RSA conversion, is that common shareholders–probably including the infamous Cano 3 who owned about 35% of the shares–will receive bupkis, nada, zip, zero in the reorganization.\n\nUpdate: The NYSE delisted Cano Health’s (CANO) stock late on Monday, citing the RSA conversion. Press release, Healthcare Dive. The Class A shares are now listed OTC (the ‘pink sheets’) under CANOQ at $0.70. Shareholders are wholesale unloading with the day’s volume over 580,000 compared to the previous average of 340,000 shares.\n\nCano remains for sale during this process according to the release.\n\nHere’s the 36-page filing, courtesy of Industry Dive. Healthcare Dive. FierceHealthcare dubbed this a ‘spectacular collapse’ (which it isn’t–that was Babylon Health) but includes some speculation from Ari Gottlieb, a principal at A2 Strategy Group whom this Editor has quoted before, that since Humana has a stake in and partnered with Cano, they should simply pick up what’s left. However, Humana may not be in a cash position to do so, given its recent losses in its Medicare Advantage business that also helped to sink Cano (partly paywalled). The local take in the Sun-Sentinel.\n\nLess drastic but equally, more signs of the times:\n\nWalgreens laid off 145 more staff, primarily in corporate. This follows on November’s 5% corporate layoff. No WARN notices have been filed and all are mum on what areas or states are affected. Nor is there any confirmation that this will be the end. Speculation is that more store closings are in the offing and once leaned down, Walgreens Boots Alliance will be sold off or parted out, with Shields Health Solutions perhaps the first on the block [TTA 25 Jan]. Healthcare Dive, Becker’s\n\nAllina Health, a 10-hospital non-profit health system based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, is outsourcing 2,000 IT and revenue cycle management jobs to Optum. Happily, this is being done as a transition on 5 May from Allina to Optum with no layoffs or shift in workplace, as of this time. Rationale given is to trim needed expenses and ‘deliver on emerging spaces’, whatever that means. Star-Tribune\n\n*Updated for Cano Health delisting and additional information on Walgreens’ layoffs.\n\nShort takes: Orion digital pain therapeutic to be commercialized by Newel Health; Verma to head Oracle Health; CVS to shut 25 LA-area MinuteClinics\n\nOrion Health licenses its chronic pain therapeutic to Newel Health. Orion’s ODD-533 (Rohkea), classified by FDA and the EU MDR as software as a medical device (MDSW or SaMD) will be developed, manufactured, and commercialized by Newel. Newel, located in Salerno, Italy, designs and commercializes digital medicine and digital therapeutics (DTx) for the US and EU such as Soturi, a digital therapeutic app for Parkinson’s Disease [TTA 23 Feb 23], Orion, located in Espoo, Finland, develops primarily human and animal pharmaceutical products. Orion release\n\nOracle wastes no time in finding a new Oracle Health head, Seema Verma. Conveniently in-house, the former head of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) from April 2017 to January 2021 joined Oracle in April last year as senior VP in charge of life sciences. As executive VP, she will oversee both Oracle Health and life sciences as general manager. Verma’s appointment was announced internally in December, according to Bloomberg. In January, Oracle Health’s general manager, Travis Dalton, announced his departure effective 1 March to join MultiPlan as CEO and president. Verma’s government experience will come in handy, as she has the difficult situation of the stalled Millenium EHR at the VA as well as finalizing the Military Health System rollout, ensuring interoperability–as well as growing the faltering hospital EHR business. By combining the positions, Oracle also eliminates one large C-suite salary. Becker’s\n\nAnd confirming signs of softness in the clinic business [TTA 24 Jan, JPM’s new reality], CVS announced the closure of 25 MinuteClinics in the Los Angeles area. Closing date is 25 February. They will retain 11 MinuteClinic locations in the Los Angeles area, including an on-demand virtual care practice. Clinics are losing out to virtual care and for more immediate needs, urgent care. This follows Walgreens’ closure of a planned 60 VillageMD adjacent practice locations and softness in their CityMD clinic group. List of 25 closures (LA Times), Becker’s"
