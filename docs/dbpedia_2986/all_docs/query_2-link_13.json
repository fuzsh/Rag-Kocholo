        "text": "Thanks to Jonathan Atkins for sharing this picture, mostly to take highlight how young I look, making me feel old on route to London. An award-winning sales team from 2011, celebrating success together! The picture made me reflect this morning on my years working in team's and leadership principles. I realised early on from sport that good team's respected each other - controversial, but you dont all have to be best friends to work well together, heated debate can be good but always finish with a laugh and agree that the debate is never personal, ultimately people want to win (whatever winning looks like for them) Businesses now spend more time speaking about \"culture\" than ever. From my perspective, culture isn't something you can agree on and then execute. The people and the standards lived each day create the culture, the respect in communication, and honesty of those conversations set the tone. Understand that people have lives, I believe in family first, personal life and work life will always work together when people are happy. Finally, a couple of things which would make me question the authentication of the culture; 1. \"We have an open door policy\" - weird! If you call that out as a benefit - you probably don't have it! 2. T-E-A-M written on the walls - This won't change the culture or results and if you are in an office today with this peeling off the wall - get out of there! Question- Any others to add to the list........... #oldphoto Julia Forster Jonathan Atkins Andy Plumley #culture #sales #companyculture\n\nüåü Celebrating Success Harry International Private Limited üåü We're thrilled to announce an exciting milestone at Harry International! In our relentless pursuit of excellence and employee satisfaction, we've recently implemented a Cash Bonus system that complements our already robust incentive and increment programs. üíº *Leadership in Action* Our very own manager Trideep Trivedi have set the bar high, leading by example as they've smashed the targets necessary to secure this substantial Cash Bonus. It's no small feat, and as the adage goes: \"Leaders don't just meet expectations; they exceed them and inspire their teams to do the same.\" üèÜ *Rewarding Excellence* This initiative isn't just about numbers; it's about people. It's a testament to our belief that our employees are the cornerstone of our success. We're proud to offer an opportunity for our team members to earn an additional ‚Çπ25,000 on top of their salaries and incentives. üë• *Why Harry International Stands Out* At Harry International, we understand something fundamental that seems to elude half the industry: businesses are built on the dedication and hard work of their employees‚Äînot solely on services or client relationships. The true essence of any company is its workforce, the very 'blood and sweat' of those who toil day and night for growth and success. üë©üíºüë®üíº *Our Priority: Our People* We prioritize employees with a fiery passion for propelling Harry International forward, contributing with both their hearts and their intellect.

It's as simple as that.\" - Richard Branson* Join us in celebrating this achievement and the continued success of our incredible team. Here's to setting benchmarks, achieving goals, and most importantly, to our employees who make it all possible! #HarryInternational #EmployeeFirst #CashBonusSuccess #LeadershipExcellence #IncentivesThatInspire #RewardingDedication #CareerGrowth #WeValueOurPeople #IndustryLeaders #SettingTheStandard\n\nOn business trips I always make sure to get some downtime to decompress and find inspiration. Emails can wait! This week I was in London and, through pure serendipity, found out about a free exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery ‚Äî a selection of Moleskine notebooks used by artists from around the world. Fabulous! Also, I had scheduled my meetings such that I wouldn't have to rush between them across town. As the weather turned out nice I walked everywhere rather than take the tube ‚Äî clocking up over 10K per day. No gym required... and I got to explore new neighbourhoods along the way. Of course, not every trip is like that. Last week I was in the north of England to deliver a leadership development programme. With daily prep and review this resulted in 11-hour work days. But in the evenings you could always find me in the local park. To me, these things are non-negotiable. And yet, I‚Äôm always baffled by how many people don‚Äôt take time to explore or look after themselves while away on business. No downtime, no exercise, every spare minute spent on their laptops ‚Äúcatching up‚Äù. Except they‚Äôre not catching up ‚Äî they‚Äôre missing out. Business emails are not what you‚Äôll remember six months down the line, let alone on your deathbed. A Saatchi exhibition, or anything else that tickles your interest, stands a much better chance. Not to mention the walk there ‚Äî what else could you find on the way? #work #travel #inspiration\n\nEnsuring growth and leadership success, especially during times of great change, is about understanding the motivations, pains, goals, and desires of all employees, and ACTING on them. Asking the right questions ‚Äì offering vulnerability, stepping Outdoors, and venturing Outside what's typically comfortable ‚Äì create the bonds and communication styles CRITICAL to healthy growth. I don't just believe this, I know it to be true... That's why I'm so pleased to have joined Shamir Insight's National Sales Meeting down in San Diego. I see this philosophy throughout their teams; using authentic connection not just for sales, but to uplift and encourage each other throughout their dynamic advances. I encourage everyone to keep abandoning antiquated norms and corporate \"social protocol\". You'll find a far more intentional, fulfilling, and connected life.

Would you tell them what your job is or would you also tell them why you do it and how you go about it in a way that leaves them feeling inspired and curious to learn more? If you can get clear on your personal purpose and your how as well as your what, and use these things to guide your words and actions, this will help you elevate your impact and create positive change in the organisations your work for/with. Oliver Strong and I have been discussing this with members of the 30% Club Ireland this week and the conversations have been thought-provoking and energising. Personal brand is a topic that has evolved a lot over the years. Nowadays, instead of it just being about what clothes you wear and how you come across when speaking, it covers powerful things like having a strong personal purpose, being clear on your magic moves and superpowers and how to use them to best effect. It also covers things like how to use iconic actions to let people know what you stand for and how to cut through personal brand blandness on platforms like LinkedIn. Thank you to Gillian Harford for inviting us back to Ireland and to everyone who came along and made the discussions memorable. #30%clubireland #personalbranding #purpose #leadership #culture\n\nManchester United CEO Omar Berrada Berrada quoted today in the times \"If you‚Äôre going to recruit well, recruit the recruiters well\". ‚ÄúGetting the right player with the right character for the right price and getting the right principles back in <Manchester> United.\" He emphasises 'character', 'values and value‚Äô. Like most things it comes from the top, the leadership. Having the right 'values' and value and ensuring the people you are working with internally and externally share those 'values and value‚Äô. So, \"If you‚Äôre going to recruit well, recruit the recruiters well\" and get someone with the same 'values and value‚Äô after all they are a custodian of your brand. This applies to all business sectors including SaaS world.\n\nWrapping Up the Week with Some Amelia Earhart Inspiration ‚úàÔ∏è As we finish up another week at WHY Hospitality, let‚Äôs get some motivation from the amazing Amelia Earhart: \"The most effective way to do it, is to do it.\" In our industry, there are always challenges and opportunities. Every day is a chance to make a difference and bring new ideas to life. Amelia‚Äôs words remind us that action is key. üåü Whether you‚Äôre leading a team, helping guests, or trying out new ideas, remember: the first step is the most important. Let‚Äôs keep moving forward with energy and determination, knowing each step brings us closer to our goals. üí™‚ú® Here‚Äôs to going after our dreams and making things happen. Whether you're relaxing or planning your next adventure, have a great weekend! üåûüöÄ #WHYHospitality #AmeliaEarhart #Inspiration #Leadership #TakeAction #HospitalityHeroes #GlassHalfFull #Innovation #Community #WeekendMotivation"
