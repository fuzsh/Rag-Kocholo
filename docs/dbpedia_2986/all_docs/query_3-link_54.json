        "text": "Nottingham will “always be the home of Boots”, says the man at the very top of the company as the health and beauty retailer unveiled its new-look flagship store following a multi-million pound transformation.\n\nStefano Pessina was one of four senior bosses who attended the opening ceremony at Boots’ intu Victoria Centre shop today (Thursday, November 9).\n\nMarking the completion of a 23-week refurbishment project which began in May, it is the most extensive makeover the company has carried out in any UK store for more than 15 years, creating a dedicated healthcare floor and making it more accessible for online customers to collect purchases.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the ribbon-cutting ceremony, Mr Pessina, CEO and vice-chairman of US-based parent company Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), said the fact that customer feedback was taken into account when designing the new-look store showed that employees “really respect the tradition and values of Boots”.\n\n“Nottingham always has and always will be the home of Boots ,” he added.\n\n“It has a very special place in our hearts and I am very proud to be here to give the refurbished intu Victoria Centre store back to the city.\n\n“It is one example of our ongoing investment in Boots, also contributing to the local economy and community.\n\n“Ten years ago, we started a journey to showcase the Boots brand and Boots products to the world, and I am very pleased with what we have achieved towards that goal.\n\n“Boots is now an international brand, its products are sold across the world, and that’s managed from here in Nottingham. Boots, and our colleagues are part of a global family that make a real difference to the lives of tens of millions of our patients and customers around the world.”\n\nMr Pessina was joined by WBA co-chief operating officers Alex Gourlay and Ornella Barra, as well as Elizabeth Fagan, senior vice-president and managing director of Boots.\n\nMs Barra, who is also the partner of Mr Pessina, said: “Giving back to our communities is at the heart of Boots, and nowhere is this clearer than in Nottingham.\n\n“We have a long and proud tradition in the city, and are still inspired today by the values that drove Jesse Boot in his time.\n\n“At WBA, our aim is to use our combined strengths to be a force for good. Our colleagues working at the heart of their local communities, bring our ambition to life in big and small ways every single day.”\n\nAre you looking for a job in Nottingham? Check out our jobs listings here.\n\nThe entire 29,000 sq ft store, opened in 1972, was transformed during the refurbishment project, which began in May and is designed to make it easier for customers to find products.\n\nIt involved moving the pharmacy department upstairs to offer a consolidated healthcare floor, refurbishing the Boots Opticians and Boots Hearingcare practices, introducing more than 1,000 new product lines and beauty experiences, including a new Benefit Brow Bar and the make-up brand Bare Minerals.\n\nMore till points have been added, alongside a dedicated collection point for online purchases.\n\nMs Fagan said: “We know that while times are changing, the things that matter most to customers when shopping remain constant – great care and customer service, as well as great value, products and services.\n\n“Boots has always been about the customer – anticipating what they want and adapting to make sure that we’re meeting all of their needs, and that is what this entire refurbishment of Boots intu Victoria Centre has been about.\n\n“We have invested in this important store and listened to customers throughout the journey and we trust that our Nottingham customers will continue to enjoy shopping here for many more years to come.”\n\nThe ribbon-cutting ceremony was performed by two women who have worked at the store for more than 40 years each.\n\nCustomer assistant Beverly Tyler, of Wollaton, began working at Boots in July 1972, aged 16.\n\nNow 61, she said: “The new layout is the best layout ever so far, it looks great. The customers really like it and it is the biggest achievement for the store.”\n\nAssistant manager Adrienne Bainbridge, 58, of Carlton, added: “When I first started working for Boots I only came for a Saturday job and have been here ever since.\n\n“I love the new layout, I think it’s been long time coming for the store. The whole place looks amazing.”\n\nCustomers were also impressed with the new layout.\n\nRebecca Pritchard, 34, of Rempstone, near East Leake, said: “From what I have seen it’s a lot better from before. It’s lot less crowded, which is especially when just cutting through.”\n\nGill Newbould, of Wollaton, added: “I think it needed doing. It was definitely a good idea to put the pharmacy up stairs, keeping it separate from the rest of the shop.”"
