Grey's Anatomy was initially dismissed by a "room full of old men", claims creator Shonda Rhimes.

Now in its 19th series, the medical drama starring Ellen Pompeo as the iconic Meredith Grey has produced over 400 episodes and holds the title for 'longest-running scripted primetime show' at ABC.

Joining today's (October 26) episode of the podcast , Rhimes and producer Betsy Beers recalled the response to their Grey's pilot pitch, which featured intern Meredith sleeping with Patrick Dempsey's Derek Shepherd.

"It feels really obvious now, I think, but at the time, you have to remember, there had never been a show in which there was a lead character who owned her sexuality on network television," said Rhimes.

"I remember getting called into a room full of old men to tell me that the show was a problem. Because nobody was gonna watch a show about a woman who would sleep with a man the night before her first day of work, and they were dead serious."

Beers went on to reveal that it was she who countered their misgivings by admitting these bedroom antics were based on her own experience.

"Shonda looked like she wanted to throw up, which was the appropriate response to this, but I couldn't help it, and I said, 'Oh, that's me. I did that. That's absolutely me.'

"I remember I was saying that and I just blurted it out, because it was true," she shared.

Following that revelation, Rhimes (who also produces hit shows such as Bridgerton) suggested that the execs couldn't "get out of that room fast enough".

"They didn't know what to do. They were like, 'These are these kinds of women we don't like.'"
