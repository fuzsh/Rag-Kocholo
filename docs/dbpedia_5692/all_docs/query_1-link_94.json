        "text": "Through the last 19 seasons, fans have seen a lot of actors come and go — so much so that creator and producer Shonda Rhimes has become pretty well-known for her sudden additions and often heartbreaking departures from the medical drama. But no character has affected fans more than Ellen Pompeo a.k.a. Dr. Meredith Grey.\n\nThe news that she was leaving the show — at least as a full-time cast member — last year left fans shocked, seeing how she is the Grey in Grey's Anatomy, and has been the heart and soul of the series since its beginning in 2005. But with confirmation that she will still remain an executive producer and do the show's voiceovers, fans are left wondering — will we see Ellen at all on-screen during the upcoming 20th season? Here's what we know.\n\nWill Ellen Pompeo be in season 20 of 'Grey's Anatomy'?\n\nLucky for fans, the 54-year-old actress is will make appearances throughout season 20, and continue her voiceover for the intro and endings of the episodes. In season 19, fans saw Meredith on-screen for a total of eight episodes, but for season 20, she's expected to be in at least two of them. \"She's in the first episode,\" co-star and director Debbie Allen told ET. \"And she's in the one I'm going to direct, so she won't be too far.\"\n\nTwo actually isn't bad, considering season 20 overall will be much shorter with only 10 episodes slated to premiere on March 14, 2024.\n\nAnd fans are certainly eager for an update on the skilled surgeon's storyline. Last we saw, Meredith returned for the two-hour season 19 finale, where we saw her rekindle her relationship with Dr. Nick Marsh (Scott Speedman). But like with all Shonda storylines, we know that anything's game when it comes to Meredith Grey.\n\nAs for concern about her fully leaving the show in the future? There simply wouldn't be a show. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Shonda has emphasized that there would \"be no Grey's Anatomy without Meredith Grey.\""
