        "text": "This is a copy of my PhD thesis, completed in 2011 at the University of Exeter. It represents a new history of Home Box Office, and particularly considers the importance of analysing the early history of the company for understanding its later success as a quality programming brand. As the thesis was researched and written between 2007 and 2011, its historical scope only goes up to 2007, with some mention of later series. It doesn't cover Game of Thrones or other recent HBO series, but I'm happy that certain trends identified in the thesis are still going strong. Feel free to contact me for questions about the thesis.\n\nAmericans have always been divided generationally, from the Lost Generation and the Greatest Generation to the Baby Boomers and Generation X. Until September 11, 2001, the Millennial Generation (“Millennials”) was only defined in relation to other demographic cohorts. A review of popular culture from 1998–2003, specifically television programming targeted to and embraced by the Millennials, demonstrates a search for legitimation at a time when this generation existed only in the context of others, with no obvious distinguishing characteristics. This paper will explore popular culture trends as a marker of broader social change in the context of the declining need of the Millennial Generation to define itself through popular culture (and earlier generations) when presented with its own “defining moment.” By comparing trends in youth-oriented programming at the end of the 21st century to shows that premiered following the September 11 terrorist attacks, it becomes clear that popular culture begins to transform from a means of legitimation to a mechanism for escapism."
