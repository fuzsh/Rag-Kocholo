The high-intensity medical drama, now in its 18th season, follows Meredith Grey and the team of doctors at Grey Sloan Memorial who are faced with life-or-death decisions daily. They seek comfort from one another, and, at times, more than just friendship. Together they discover that neither medicine nor relationships can be defined in black and white. \"Grey's Anatomy\" stars Ellen Pompeo as Meredith Grey, Chandra Wilson as Miranda Bailey, James Pickens Jr. as Richard Webber, Kevin McKidd as Owen Hunt, Kim Raver as Teddy Altman, Camilla Luddington as Jo Wilson, Caterina Scorsone as Amelia Shepherd, Kelly McCreary as Maggie Pierce, Chris Carmack as Atticus \"Link\" Lincoln, Jake Borelli as Levi Schmitt, Richard Flood as Cormac Hayes and Anthony Hill as Winston Ndugu. \"Grey's Anatomy\" was created and is executive produced by Shonda Rhimes (\"Scandal,\" \"How to Get Away with Murder,\" \"Station 19\"). Betsy Beers (\"Scandal,\" \"How to Get Away with Murder,\" \"Station 19\"), Mark Gordon (\"Saving Private Ryan\"), Krista Vernoff (\"Shameless\"), Debbie Allen, Zoanne Clack and Meg Marinis are executive producers. \"Grey's Anatomy\" is produced by ABC Signature, which is a part of Disney Television Studios."
