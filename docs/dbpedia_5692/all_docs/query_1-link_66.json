Fans have passionate feelings, and I was always fine with that. I understand that the characters felt like their friends. They were my imaginary friends, too. That’s why I was writing them. And I think people just had very strong feelings about what happened with their friends,” she said. “But then it became weird.”\n\nRhimes is gearing up for the new season of the Shondaland-produced Bridgerton, which drops soon on Netflix."
