        "text": "Debbie Allen is further expanding her role on Shonda Rhimes’ medical drama Grey’s Anatomy. Allen is set to serve as executive producer/director on the veteran ABC medical drama’s upcoming 12th season pending an official pickup by the network, which is considered a formality.\n\nAllen landed one of her highest-profile drama series directing gigs to date in 2010 when she helmed three episodes of Grey’s Anatomy‘s sixth season. That led to a recurring role on the series as Jackson Avery’s mom. (Multi-tasking talent is a trademark of Shondaland series, with Eric Stolz directing an episode of Private Practice before appearing in Grey’s and Dan Buchatinsky serving as writer on Grey’s and co-star on Scandal.)\n\nAllen went on to direct four more episodes of Grey’s as well as episodes of the other two Shondaland/ABC Studios dramas for ABC, Scandal and How To Get Away with Murder. This season, she was a director on three of the most buzzed about new broadcast hourlong series, HTGAWM, Fox’s Empire, on which she directed the season finale, and the CW’s Jane the Virgin. Allen is currently in Atlanta where she is directing an episode of the Starz series Survivor’s Remorse.\n\nIn addition to executive producing and directing multiple episodes of Grey’s next season, Allen will continue to recur as Catherine Avery. Rob Corn has previously served as executive producer/director on the show.\n\nAllen, who started her career as a dancer, choreographer and Broadway actress until becoming a household name as the star of Fame, is the founder of Los Angeles-based DADA (Debbie Allen Dance Academy) with her husband, Norm Nixon. This summer she has been invited to direct a group of high school seniors as part of the Presidential Scholars program honoring aspiring artists nationwide, with an original program to be presented at the Kennedy Center.\n\nAllen is repped by Jill and Geoffrey Brandt of Course Management and Kaplan/Stahler."
