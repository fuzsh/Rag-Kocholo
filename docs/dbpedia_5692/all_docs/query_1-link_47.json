JUST KIDDING, IT IS BECAUSE OF OUR AWESOME FANS’—ELLEN POMPEO, ON THE REASONS FOR GREY’S ANATOMY’S LONG RUN GREY’S ANATOMY AT 20: STILL OPENING HEARTS EXCLUSIVE New People Interviews • On-Set: Interns’ Photo Diary • Top Medical Shockers! PLUS The Cast’s Favorite Episodes & More…\n\nI was just 16 years old when Denny Duquette died in a hospital bed at Seattle Grace. May 2006. He wasn’t a relative or friend, or even a real person. But I was devastated, nonetheless, when his weak heart gave out. I remember Izzie Stevens—his doctor, his fiancée, his rogue advocate in jumping the transplant list—lying on his chest as she said, “An hour ago he was proposing, and now … and now he’s going to the morgue.” My mom, over my sobs, told me, “If this show is going to do this to you, maybe you shouldn’t watch.” No quitter, I pushed though, because I loved the series, though I had no idea how influential it would become in our lives.

I must have watched 100 flash mob proposals on YouTube in anticipation of this moment. It took us all day to shoot it, and it felt like such a departure. I loved every second of that day.” NIKO TERHO’S PICK THE BROKEN HEART “I loved the whole Denny Duquette-Izzie Stevens saga,” says Terho (Dr. Lucas Adams). Izzie (Katherine Heigl) falls for a cardiac patient (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and moves him up the transplant list by cutting the cord to his LVAD heart pump. “Heartbreaking to this day,” adds Harry Shum Jr. The…"
