        "text": "“It’s a big studio in a small footprint. It allows us to have all of our equipment here and it’s walkable between all of the stages, all the facilities,” (Season 2 Producer Jeff Rafner)\n\nFollowing the success of 2021’s 10-episode first season, La Brea returned to Docklands Studios in 2022 with another 14 eps, following the story of a family’s survival after they are separated by a massive sinkhole that mysteriously opens up in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nThe NBCUniversal drama was one of the biggest ever to film in Victoria and built major sets in a number of our stages while parts of Melbourne doubled for LA.\n\nThe shoot, post-production and visual effects took place with support from the Victorian Screen Incentive and the Federal Government’s Location Incentive.\n\nSeries 1 premiered in September 2021 and Series 2 in September 2022.\n\nRafner singled out Docklands’ new super stage, Stage 6, for its flexibility:\n\n“Stage 6 has been an amazing giant stage to go into. It feels like it’s big enough to build anything you would want… you could do any giant visual effects work… you could build a big two-storey set.”\n\n“The other thing that’s really great about Docklands studios is the location of it. It’s very close to the CBD, it’s very close to the airport.”\n\n“Everyone’s great, from the person at the gate who stops me to ask how my family is, to everyone I’ve run into, it’s just been positive and happy.”\n\nLa Brea is is created and executive produced by David Appelbaum and produced by Universal Television and Victorian company Matchbox Pictures, both divisions of Universal Studio Group, in association with Keshet Studios."
