        "text": "Recipient of the 2007 Golden Globe® Award for Best Drama Television Series and nominated for multiple Emmys®, including Outstanding Drama Series, GREY’S ANATOMY is considered one of the great television shows of our time. The high-intensity medical drama, now approaching its 20th season, follows a team of doctors at Grey Sloan Memorial who are faced with life-or death decisions on a daily basis. They seek comfort from one another, and, at times, more than just friendship. Together they discover that neither medicine nor relationships can be defined in black and white.\n\nGREY’S ANATOMY stars Ellen Pompeo as Meredith Grey, Chandra Wilson as Miranda Bailey, James Pickens Jr. as Richard Webber, Kevin McKidd as Owen Hunt, Kim Raver as Teddy Altman, Camilla Luddington as Jo Wilson, Caterina Scorsone as Amelia Shepherd, Kelly McCreary as Maggie Pierce, Chris Carmack as Atticus “Link” Lincoln, Jake Borelli as Levi Schmitt, Richard Flood as Cormac Hayes, and Anthony Hill as Winston Ndugu.\n\nGREY’S ANATOMY was created and is executive produced by Shonda Rhimes (SCANDAL, HOW TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER, STATION 19). Betsy Beers (SCANDAL, HOW TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER, STATION 19), Mark Gordon (Saving Private Ryan), Krista Vernoff (SHAMELESS), Debbie Allen, Zoanne Clack, and Meg Marinis are executive producers. GREY’S ANATOMY is produced by ABC Signature, which is a part of Disney Television Studios."
