        "text": "Q: Tell us about a project you worked on you are especially proud of and why. What was your role?\n\nA: I'm primarily an ukulele artist...but recently I switched it up and focused on crafting my songwriting. In 2020, despite of the Covid craziness and our world being turned upside down...I pushed through and released my first ever singer-songwriting EP project!\n\nQ: What are you working on at the moment?\n\nA: A lot! I'm currently working on songwriting, music production, composing for several recording projects, and endless business and entrepreneurship endeavors...the list never ends, and I don't think it ever will. Lol!\n\nQ: Is there anyone on SoundBetter you know and would recommend to your clients?\n\nA: Absolutely! You need to check out BoomFox Productions (Kris Bradley is the REAL DEAL!)\n\nQ: Analog or digital and why?\n\nA: DIGITAL! It's easier, quicker and lighter (literally).\n\nQ: What advice do you have for a customer looking to hire a provider like you?\n\nA: I'm reliable, a seasoned artist and entrepreneur...and I always try my absolute best to contribute my musical gift to yours.\n\nQ: If you were on a desert island and could take just 5 pieces of gear, what would they be?\n\nA: My ukulele, some extra strings, a tuner, my computer...and my phone (yes, my phone is a piece of gear, Lol!).\n\nQ: What questions do customers most commonly ask you? What's your answer?\n\nA: \"Do you think an ukulele would sound great with my song?\" YES! ABSOLUTELY!\n\nQ: How would you describe your style?\n\nA: I love the organic acoustic sound of a song...whether it's ukulele, guitar or piano, that's my vibe. In my mind...I'm always thinking...\"what would it sound like if I add some ukulele to it?\"\n\nQ: What's your typical work process?\n\nA: I first like to find the groove of the song. I then try to connect with the melody, lyrics, and instrumentations...and from there... I ask, \"how can I add more dynamics through my ukulele?\"\n\nQ: What questions do you ask prospective clients?\n\nA: I love to ask, \"why are you doing what you doing?\" From this question...I can easily find out what is the client's main objective and intention.\n\nQ: What other musicians or music production professionals inspire you?\n\nA: Jason Mraz, John Mayer, Ingrid Michaelson, Bruno Mars, Shawn Mendes and Ryan Tedder\n\nQ: Tell us about your studio setup.\n\nA: MacBook Pro (13-Inch 2020), Logic Pro 10.6.1, Focusrite Scarlett 2i2, Komplete Kontrol A61, MPK mini, Neumann TLM 103, Focusrite CM25 MkIII, ATH-M50x, KRK Rokit 5 G4, Analysis Plus Cables\n\nQ: What's the biggest misconception about what you do?\n\nA: The ukulele is totally an underrated instrument...and I love proving to the world that the ukulele isn't a \"toy-like\" instrument. Case and point...a HUGE thank you to the LA Lakers, who were considerate enough to give me this opportunity. In 2016, I was the first ever ukulele artist to play the national anthem on their home court in Staples Center...and 19,000 plus fans went bananas! It was a historic night I'll never ever forget - especially because it was also Kobe Bryant and LeBron Jame's last game competing against each other.\n\nQ: What was your career path? How long have you been doing this?\n\nA: I started playing the ukulele at age 11...and I recall the moment I picked it up, I knew the ukulele was going to be a part of me. Fast forward to today...it's now been a 27-year musical journey and I'm overwhelmingly humbled and blessed to have shared and inspire the world through the ukulele. And...the best thing about this journey is I've developed great relationships along the way!\n\nQ: What do you bring to a song?\n\nA: Through my ukulele, I believe I can lift and bring a new direction to a song.\n\nQ: Describe the most common type of work you do for your clients.\n\nA: I'm a performing and recording ukulele artist, singer-songwriter, composer, producer and educator.\n\nQ: What's your 'promise' to your clients?\n\nA: I promise to be professional, consistent, work hard, and put my entire heart and soul into every project I'm hired for.\n\nQ: Which artist would you like to work with and why?\n\nA: I'd love to collaborate with Jason Mraz...I love his vibe, songwriting and style of music!\n\nQ: Can you share one music production tip?\n\nA: Don't worry about knowing everything and all the logistics about production...just trust in what sounds good to you.\n\nQ: What's your strongest skill?\n\nA: I have a few - I feel that my strongest skills are...I'm easy to work with, I love collaborating and developing great working relationships and I believe the ukulele can play to any song or genre."
