I am finishing up after nearly 10 years of involvement with Iskandar Malaysia Studios. I've had an incredible journey. I'm grateful for the opportunity to have worked on 4 continents, visited over 10 countries for work, met thousands of people. Worked with & developed some fantastic teams. We've set up, sold and delivered some very creative solutions to some pretty unique projects with these teams. I've made lifelong friends and, most importantly, been able to share it all with my fabulous family. Thank you to all involved at IMS; you know who you are. I'll miss this place... It's time for new adventures... I am genuinely delighted to be returning to Melbourne to join the Docklands Studios Melbourne team and take up the CEO position. Big shoes to fill, well done Rod, a fantastic job. A big thank you to all the well-wishers! Cut to me rolling up my sleeves ..."
