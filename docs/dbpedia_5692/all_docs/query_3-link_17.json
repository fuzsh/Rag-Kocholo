        "text": "1.1. Understanding Flexibility\n\nFlexibility is a cognitive ability that helps humans to achieve flexible behavior in different environments (Ionescu 2012). Flexibility has been defined based on different ideas (see Ionescu 2012): (a) as the cognitive ability to adapt to changing demands (e.g., task set-switching (Colzato et al. 2009; Monsell 2003)), (b) as a combination of flexibility and persistence (Nijstad et al. 2010), or (c) as one property of the cognitive system (e.g., modification of processes based on a change in task demands (Deák 2004)). Ionescu (2012) unified these views and ideas by describing flexibility as a general characteristic that is based on the interaction of knowledge, attention, monitoring, and executive functions with environmental cues such as task demands. When studied as an aspect of the ability to think divergently, flexibility is usually assessed in two instantiations: ideational flexibility and associative flexibility. Ideational flexibility describes the use of a variety of ideational categories (Guilford 1967; Runco 1986; Runco and Okuda 1991), whereas associative flexibility includes the ability to build a diversified association chain (Benedek et al. 2012b). However, in terms of understanding flexibility as an aspect of divergent thinking, it is predominantly conceptualized as ideational flexibility, and we will restrict our discussion to this aspect of flexibility.\n\nIdeational flexibility is a prominent aspect in models of cognitive abilities (e.g., Carroll 1993) and features saliently in theories of creativity (e.g., Nijstad et al. 2010). Factor analytic studies of creative-thinking abilities (Wilson et al. 1954) list flexibility as a key aspect of idea production and creativity. It is described as the “adaptability to changing instructions”, the “freedom to inertia of thought”, and the “spontaneous shifting of sets” (Wilson et al. 1954, p. 298). In models of cognitive ability, flexibility is mostly described as an aspect of the general retrieval ability in the area of idea generation/production—such as in the Cattell-Horn-Carroll model (CHC, McGrew 2009). Within Carroll’s (1993) discussion of abilities in the domain of idea generation, several flexibility factors are listed in addition to fluency and originality factors. They date back to measures proposed in the Kit of Reference Tests for Cognitive Factors (Ekstrom et al. 1976; French et al. 1963) as summarized in . These factors all tap ideational flexibility and include the “shifting of sets” (Wilson et al. 1954) while differing between verbal and figural content.\n\nTable 1\n\nFactorDescriptionFigural Adaptive Flexibility“The ability to change set in order to meet new requirements imposed by figural problems” (p. 49)Semantic Spontaneous Flexibility“The ability to produce a diversity of verbally expressed ideas in a situation that is relatively unrestricted” (p. 50)Figural Flexibility“The ability to change set in order to generate new and different solutions to figural problems” (p. 73)Flexibility of Use“The mental set necessary to think of different uses for objects” (p. 197)\n\nThe tests listed in were all scored with regard to the number of spontaneous changes from one category to another (within the predefined categories (Carroll 1993)). The same scoring schemes of the predefined categories are still used in contemporary divergent thinking tasks that are instructed in a hybrid way for fluency as well as flexibility (e.g., Jäger et al. 1997; Reiter-Palmon et al. 2019) or specifically for flexibility (Runco and Okuda 1991). In fact, these tasks all seem inspired by the factor descriptions listed in or the task materials published either by Wilson et al. (1954) or within the French Kits.\n\nAs described above, one idea for understanding flexibility is viewing it as a function of flexibility and persistence within a task. Both determinants are deemed essential for creativity and can mutually compensate each other. Originality can then emanate from the number of categories generated in a task but also from persisting in developing ideas within the categories in more depth (e.g., Nijstad et al. 2010, Zhang et al. 2020). Flexibility (and persistence) can therefore be understood as concepts that promote the generation of an original set of ideas (Nijstad et al. 2010). Flexibility is deemed a cognitive process that reflects the ease of subjects to switch to a different approach or different perspective. Persistence is defined as a process that reflects the degree of task-directed focused maximal cognitive effort and how this effort is sustained over time and distraction. Flexibility and persistence are seen as being substantially due to attention control and working memory—the former presumably being more strongly implied in the case of flexibility. Within models of divergent thinking, the flexibility of a person is usually assessed through the number of predefined categories used in a response. Persistence can be expressed as the mean number of solutions generated within a response category. Obviously, both persistence and flexibility are strongly related to fluency measures of the same task. In fact, multiplying the persistence with the flexibility score should deliver the sum of all solutions generated. In this sense, the dual pathway model is not a theory of creativity but a simple decomposition of fluency performance.\n\nPrevious factor analytical considerations have also strengthened the conclusion that meaningful individual differences can be equally found in fluency, originality, and flexibility (e.g., Carroll 1993; Wilson et al. 1954). However, the prominent usage of solely creative fluency indicators in the assessment of divergent thinking (Hargreaves and Bolton 1972) as well as the confounding effects of fluency in assessing originality and flexibility (e.g., Forthmann et al. 2020) appear to point to the direction that fluency is—in terms of reliability, validity, and scoring—a better indicator for capturing individual differences than originality or flexibility.\n\nFrom a psychometric perspective, a key feature of flexibility is the approach to performance appraisals that stresses the diversity of responses. Evidently, unusual procedures—for instance, instructions that are incongruent with the performance appraisal—could be subject to explicit modelling. Evidently, fluency and originality are best understood as dispositional trait factors, whereas different methods of instructing subjects—for instance, performance appraisals that apply fluency scoring to an originality task—could be incorporated into overarching measurement models as so-called method factors (Eid et al. 2017; Weiss et al. 2021b). The strength of such method factors could provide us with an idea of how strongly such inconsistencies can affect the measurement of fluency and originality. Equally plausible, the instruction to provide persistent responses in a number of flexibility tests could also strengthen the relevance of some performance aspects relative to others.\n\nIn sum, ideational flexibility has been theoretically and empirically linked to divergent thinking (fluency and originality)—going back to several cognitive theories—but also to creative and original outcomes (Benedek et al. 2012b; Guilford 1967; Johnson-Laird 1988; Nijstad et al. 2010). Therefore, it is not surprising that flexibility and other aspects of divergent thinking—such as fluency and originality—are highly related. However, the correlations reported are so strong that the existence of flexibility beyond a less complex factor for fluency is questionable. In the literature, such high correlations with fluency have often led to understanding divergent thinking as unidimensional (e.g., Weiss et al. 2021a) or as evidence in favor of the so-called equal odds that describe the number of qualitative creative ideas as a linear function of fluency (e.g., Forthmann et al. 2020). Scores, such as those reported in Benedek et al. (2012a), that present a correlation on the manifest level of r = .86 between ideational fluency and ideational flexibility might be highly fluency confounded. Please note, that in Benedek and colleagues (and, unfortunately, many more studies) the tasks were scored so that fluency, originality, and flexibility were all assessed in any one task (Reiter-Palmon et al. 2019). Obviously, this causes stochastic dependencies that are at odds with standard psychometric models. More importantly, instructions to participants are inevitably opaque. Participants are often not aware if they should demonstrate fluency, originality, or flexibility. Often, they are simply instructed to be “creative” and are then coded for fluency, originality, and flexibility at the same time. Such unwanted stochastic dependencies can be avoided by instructing tasks only regarding one of these aspects of divergent thinking. Other studies replicated the strong relations between fluency and flexibility (e.g., r = .98, Shen et al. 2018) but also share this operational opaqueness. The key issue is that the instruction (e.g., be flexible) is mostly not congruent with the scoring (e.g., flexibility) (Reiter-Palmon et al. 2019). Therefore, published evidence can be deemed insufficient for estimating the amount of variance in flexibility measures that is accounted for by other factors such as originality and fluency. Other things being equal, more conclusive evidence should be based on tasks in which the scoring is congruent with the instruction given to participants.\n\nTheoretically, fluency and ideational flexibility tasks are akin to one another. This means that, even though they capture different aspects of divergent thinking (quantity vs. diversity), they are theoretically related as diversity without quantity is not possible. It is also the case that a key feature—i.e., to produce a solution or an idea—is the same in both tasks, and instead of quickly producing a chain of conceptually similar responses, flexibility instructions stress diversity. Therefore, both concepts should be correlated and should show some uniqueness. In fact, once a categorization for responses is developed, fluency tasks can be instructed as flexibility tasks. Similarly, ideational flexibility tasks can be instructed as ordinary fluency tasks if the quantity of solutions is stressed and the diversity of responses is omitted from the instructions.\n\nBesides, the ability to retrieve information from long-term storage is crucial for creative fluency and hence also for retrieving information from different categories in flexibility (Carroll 1993; Silvia et al. 2013; Unsworth et al. 2013). Verbal fluency and retrieval can be understood as hinging upon four ingredients (Rosen and Engle 1997). First, activation spreads in long-term memory starting with a cue delivered in the instruction. In flexibility tasks, more than one chain of activation might need to be pursued, thereby making such tasks harder, at least by virtue of putting a stronger load on cognitive control and working memory. Second, as a task progresses, more and more generated responses must be monitored to avoid repetitions and omissions. These executive functions are supposedly harder in tasks in which several chains of solutions are pursued, i.e., if solutions across a number of categories are generated instead of exhausting solutions from one category. Third, subjects will usually adhere to Grice’s maxims (Grice 1975) and avoid useless repetitions, although they are often not instructed as such. Therefore, generated solutions must be supervised, and this activity might put a higher strain on working memory if solutions are generated from different response categories. This should be the case because the response categories also need supervision in flexibility tasks apart from the solutions. The fourth ingredient is the self-generation of category cues to access new items (Rosen and Engle 1997). This includes that previously retrieved answers must be suppressed in order to access new answer categories. If this is not done, someone will resample already used categories and only generate answers within the same category.\n\nTaken together, verbal fluency partly depends on working memory. In contrast, ideational flexibility should depend more strongly on working memory. Participants who are low in working memory should have more difficulties than those with high working memory in successfully monitoring and supervising solutions. They should also struggle to maintain response chains and the self-generation of cues. Given that the role of working memory is strengthened in flexibility tasks relative to fluency tasks, the difference between subjects with low and high working memory should be of higher magnitude in flexibility tasks. Similarly, mental speed should be more highly related with flexibility than with fluency. Flexibility tasks require more complex cognitive processes—maintaining response chains, etc.—that are not only demanding working memory capacity but also mental speed. Previous research has shown that general task complexity is related with mental speed and that this complexity is best understood as working memory requirements (e.g., Goecke et al. 2021; Sheppard and Vernon 2008). This implies that more complex tasks—as they require a greater amount of working memory—should show a higher correlation with mental speed than less complex tasks. An assumption based on that idea would be that flexibility, as the more complex task, is more strongly related with mental speed than fluency. However, on the contrary, Forthmann et al. (2019) have shown that general retrieval—which can be seen as the less complex task—is more strongly related with general mental speed than creative ideation (i.e., divergent thinking).\n\n4.2. Future Directions of Research\n\nThe findings implied that the aspects of divergent thinking—as discussed and measured hitherto—might need some revision. Creative fluency is the most prominent factor in previous research and this manuscript, and previous research shows that originality and flexibility are of limited utility over and above fluency (Hargreaves and Bolton 1972). However, a number of articles have provided evidence for the theoretical and practical importance of originality and flexibility, and based on novel automated scoring approaches (e.g., Reiter-Palmon et al. 2019) or the adaption of older scoring approaches (e.g., Forthmann and Doebler 2022), an incremental utility of originality and flexibility is conceivable. This implies that either the tasks or associated performance appraisal standards must be improved in order to better capture unique variance of flexibility and originality. Alternatively, the concept of divergent thinking should be revised towards a construct that is best depicted based on indicators of fluency. Such a revision would imply losing theoretically important aspects of creativity, such as the creation of novel ideas, and would therefore narrow the construct to retrieving previously learned information. Prior to discarding flexibility from divergent thinking, we propose a number of interventions to strengthen the flexibility measurement.\n\nEven though this multivariate study included a variety of indicators that assessed fluency and originality, the indicator that was used to assess flexibility was limited to a single task with six items (four-word sentences; Schoppe 1975). This limited the findings as the employment of a single paradigm exacerbates the distinction between trait and method variance. Methodological specificities of this ideational flexibility paradigm might be crucial for the results reported. Therefore, administering additional flexibility measures, preferably also including associational flexibility (Benedek et al. 2012b), the flexibility of use, and indicators for figural flexibility (Ekstrom et al. 1976; French et al. 1963) in a replication and extension of the present results, would deliver more conclusive results concerning the utility of flexibility. Studying a broader range of flexibility tasks would allow the testing of whether or not flexibility is best understood as a flexibility method factor below an overarching fluency/originality factor. If we pursue such research, we should be open to the result that the diversity of responses (usually collected in measures that could serve as fluency tasks if instructed as such) is not essential for capturing individual differences in divergent thinking beyond fluency/originality. In this case, it would be better to focus on originality as that facet seems to build the true core of creativity, but it often has limitations in terms of measurement. The conclusion that flexibility does not capture variance beyond fluency/originality does not necessarily contradict theories such as the dual pathway theory (Nijstad et al. 2010). This model could—for instance—be further addressed by assessing if flexibility mediates the relationship between fluency and originality. On the other side, we should be open to the perspective that the concept of flexibility is mostly reflecting increased demands on attention control and working memory rather than performance aspects that should be deemed intrinsic to creativity. If that were the case, dismissing flexibility from the realm of creativity would be the correct conclusion.\n\nAccording to Ockham’s razor, flexibility tasks need to capture something relevant that goes beyond what is measured with fluency tasks; if not, it makes sense to stick to fluency tasks because they are the more basic concept, and they are cheaper to administer and score (Hargreaves and Bolton 1972). Costs of scoring are usually substantial, given that all responses in flexibility tasks require human attention. Studies that capitalize on technological developments to evaluate responses from flexibility tasks could greatly facilitate and thereby cut the cost of scoring flexibility tasks. One such technological approach builds upon a semantic analysis of answers (Cosgrove et al. 2021). In the semantic analysis, the participants’ responses can be used to generate semantic networks displaying the connectivity of various nodes (words) in the semantic space (Cosgrove et al. 2021; Li et al. 2021). Such lexical network structures can categorize answers and express flexibility based on different indices, such as clustering coefficients, average path lengths between clusters and words, network modularity, and network diameter (Boccaletti et al. 2006; Kenett et al. 2016). Similar approaches are imaginable for processing images by blending images or comparing various image vectors and properties with one another (Rafner et al. 2020).\n\nThe flexibility within lexical network structures was mostly restricted to single words in the last years. Additionally, most of these studies use fluency tasks (that are instructed for fluency), but they are later scored for the semantic flexibility of participants (Kenett et al. 2016). This implies that flexibility is assessed based on the responses given to a fluency task, which is incongruent with the instruction (Reiter-Palmon et al. 2019). Studying semantic networks in flexibility tasks with congruent instructions (i.e., participants are instructed to maximize the diversity of their responses) would be of great interest. In addition, most semantic network approaches calculate networks for different groups (e.g., low creativity and high creativity (Li et al. 2021) or low intelligence and high intelligence (Kenett et al. 2016)). Such a procedure requires an a priori set threshold that allows for splitting the sample into low and high ability groups. This comes along with a loss of information. Therefore, future lexical network studies should focus on dimensional approaches. For instance, flexibility networks could be established along the working memory continuum using locally weighted structural equation models (Hildebrandt et al. 2016)."
