        "text": "which is clearer than the original comic page and the same size. â€”theusaf (talk) 05:20, 18 August 2022 (UTC)\n\nAs specificaly implemented above, I certainly see no immediate problem (need to check across machines/devices), but I suspect that part of the mechanism here is the \"imagesize = 315x317px\", which seems like it would need (albeit by the page-create bot, algorithm8cally) to be tailored to the 'input' image, not always in this ratio). I'm not technically conversant with the nature of your back-end scripting and doubtless it's all possible (scripts can do almost anything... once you know that they (may) need to do them and rewritten them to catch all the contingencies ;) ), but I don't know know if that's something you've accounted for (e.g. test with a three/four-panel wide comic, or the Earth Temperature Timeline or whatever, and see if it can facilitate them all nicely). Not to mention that if theusafBOT goes offline, the manual-add instructions (as used prior to your replacing the prior functioning bot, for which I thank you) also need this extra step of user involvement to be done, whereas usually the fallback manual method needed little thought in this direction (or indeed however much carbon or silicon there is in the 'brain' involved) except for exceptional circumstances or those rare prior slip-ups by Randall.\n\nI'm just going through the first obvious issue (to me), didn't mean to concentrate so many words on just this before even checking everything else! 172.70.91.80 09:15, 18 August 2022 (UTC)\n\nBasically, on the backend, the bot will fetch both the small and the large images, and measure the size of the small image, which is what it will use for the imagesize. I have actually used this system in the past for this bot, but was told to revert it due to the \"click comic to enlarge\" text. As for if the bot goes offline, there is no problem with falling back to the small image, and if editors want to, I can also provide instructions for using the large image. I'm mostly just waiting to see what others think about this. Are there any other problems to consider? â€”theusaf (talk) 14:44, 18 August 2022 (UTC)\n\nI'm making an App that collects web comics\n\nMy original idea was to use the rss feed present on xkcd, and other webcomic websites, but now im starting to wonder if there was a way to make a better service, that allowed users to maybe look at older comics, and explanations and such as well, and thats how i happened to come across explainxkcd.com. The RSS Feed for this website, would be pretty helpful, if it were like reddit's but apparently, the rss feed is only maintained for the home page. I was wondering if you guys provided that data through an API or something? Also are there wikis for other famous comics like this one? Any other suggestions and ideas for the app are welcome ðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ.\n\nComics edited after their publication\n\nmany more comics have been changed than are in Category:Comics edited after their publication ! please add them (i already have done two i remember off the top of my head) 172.70.134.223 12:56, 7 October 2022 (UTC)Bumpf\n\nDiscord category\n\nDo we need categories for comics that mention various popular social media clients, such as Google and Discord? 172.69.134.98 03:29, 21 March 2023 (UTC)\n\nIf there are a group of them, then list them, then they can be added. I can think of a couple of Google-related ones (well, Google search-page, not whatever Alphabet is currently doing insofar as social media), but don't have their names/numbers in my head right now. Do the search and list them here for someone to catalogue up?\n\nI'm not sure there are specific Discord mentions. Noting that just because some unidentified headshot dialogue/notification looks Discordish, it doesn't make it a mention. Too much cross-pollination of appearance. 172.70.90.252 09:56, 21 March 2023 (UTC)\n\nWhat if 2 book page creation\n\nWhat if 2 has come out, but I don't know which page is to be created. There is already a comic under the same name. ClassicalGames (talk) 08:54, 3 May 2023 (UTC)\n\nDefault to 3 Section Headings for Each Explanation: Non-Obvious Info, Recap, and Background Trivia\n\nThis is a proposal that all new comic explanations should, by default, have 3 Sections:\n\nI. Explanation of the Non-Obvious (an actual explanation of the non-obvious elements of the comic for the average reader who might not understand the references/joke/relevant science)\n\nII. Full Recap\n\nIII. Background Trivia\n\nMost of us can agree that Category I is where the value of this website shines.\n\nBut today, all 3 of these categories of explanation are typically merged together, making it hard to find the Category I nuggets of goodness.\n\nIf we make these 3 section headings the default on every comic explanation, then this default will helpfully nudge editors to put the juiciest stuff up top, and not to clutter that section up with fluff or trivia.\n\nâ€”â€”\n\nAs an example, take the recent comic #2878 about Astronomer Happiness and Supernova distance.\n\nThe main thing a lay reader would want to know â€” the Category I information â€” isâ€¦\n\n..That the shape of the graph is probably a clever reference to a Light Curve, a type of supernova graph\n\n..why astronomers like it when a supernova is close, and what happens when it gets too close\n\nEverything else in the (currently) very wordy explanation gets in the way of the lay reader finding out these two things. Itâ€™s a bunch of Category II and Category III info that makes it hard to tease out the Category I info. Itâ€™s not BAD information, but itâ€™s sandpaper. Itâ€™s friction slowing down the average reader.\n\nObviously I could go in and edit this particular comic, and I often do this kind of edit, but I think this issue pops up for most explanations, so I think changing the standard default interface will help everyone put their contribution into the right section.\n\nIn sum, my proposal would elevate Category I info to the top of each explanation, so instead of full recaps, we get right into the explanation that is going to be most efficiently illuminating for the average, non-expert reader, answering the most common questions.\n\nLaser813 (talk) 10:50, 12 January 2024 (UTC)\n\nIn general (if I get dibs on the edit, or think I can legitimately re-edit/rearrange), I do try to go for \"hook, line, sinker\" format (i.e. establish the basics, relate that to what the comic shows, move on to any relevent speculations/extrapolations), very like your setup. Though it is often much too complicated (multi-layered, cross-disciplinary, etc, so that maybe it has to be interwoven 'mini explanations' per tabulated item) so I'm not sure how easy it would be to enforce a strict structure. I think there's merit to the principle, though. Assuming we can all agree what each comic needs focus on (apply that problem to the following proposal too!), as I've occasionally inserted a sort of \"first you need to know <subject>\" into an established cold-start explanation (\"you see <foo>\" only for a later editor to consider it more an afterthought and shuffle it to later (\"you see <foo>\" ... \"<foo> is part of <subject>\"), or variations on such layouts. Especially as different people have different ideas as to what's obvious/can be keyword-wikilinked and what needs more waffle to properly enlighten readers.\n\nAlso, prosaic variation is a good thing. Too formulaic and it could be (whilst accurate) considered too robotic, so some leaway should really always be allowed as we collectively bash together a community interpretation and elaboration. Within communal guidelines, clearly. 172.69.194.203 15:53, 12 January 2024 (UTC)\n\nFAQ Style Editing should be the norm\n\nSimply, we should experiment with more FAQ-style explanations.\n\nWe think of the top questions that the average reader might have about a comic, and we use those as bolded headers to explain the most curious/confusing/subtle/sciency parts of the comic.\n\nThe structure would be this (using a recent comic as an example)â€¦\n\nQ: Why did Randall use this shape of graph? A: Itâ€™s likely a clever reference to a Light Curve, a similarly shaped graph in the study of supernovae thatâ€¦\n\nQ: Why do astronomers prefer it when supernovae are closer? A: It makes it easier to glean information becauseâ€¦\n\nLaser813 (talk) 10:50, 12 January 2024 (UTC)\n\nsidebar revamp\n\nI think that the sidebar looks plain and it should have a new design. It could be voted on by users Moderator (talk) 02:16, 5 February 2024 (UTC)\n\nIn leiu of you telling us what you think would be better, my starting vote is that I'm perfectly happy with that 'plain'. If it has the links I might need, why does it need a reskin? Or, worse, a functional revamp which probably removes the easy to use bits I was using already.\n\n...could you do a mock-up screenshot (or render equivalents directly in markup) of before/after side by side, at least? 172.69.194.120 03:11, 5 February 2024 (UTC)\n\nMy biggest problem is it doesnâ€™t scroll down with you which can be a big pain Moderator (talk) 01:43, 6 February 2024 (UTC)\n\nDon't know about anyone else, but (when not on a desktop) I read this on a tablet, in landscape, with the effective window quite short (ratio of 1:2 with width, approaching 1:3.5 with already narrowed onscreen keyboard popped up) and if I'm scrolled to the top I see nothing beyond Browse Comics.\n\nIf we assume separate scroll-control on the sidebar, setting Main Page at the top of browser pane gives What Links Here at the bottom. Now, I rarely use the next three links (or at least reach those pages using them), and separate scrolling wouldn't stop me even seeing the even lower Ad bit (but it would defeat the entire purpose of the Ad, in that position, whether or not I bother to notice it these days).\n\nSo whatever missing about you propose, I'm betting it would impact me. Perhaps not negatively, but I've seen enough awful assumptions about my screen-area in the name of scroll-free design. Including the \"give us permission (or not) to give you cookies\" popovers where it appears the actual buttons to confirm (or deny, or go somewhere to review and customise, if they have that option) are beyond the bottom of my screen. I can temporarily rotate the screen, of course, but often I just back out and don't bother in those cases. I wouldn't be reticent to rotate this site, on occasion, but I'd really rather not have to, if I can be so selfish and stick-in-the-mud, because websites just are not good to use (even temporarily) in narrow-portait mode. (What's worse is the websites that detect I'm on a mobile platform and redesign styles/placements on-the-fly to 'fit portrait view', assuming a vertical smartphone, regardless of my actual viewport orientation, etc.)\n\nSo, please, a hard no from me. Notwithstanding that just as solidly \"always browse in portrait\" people might be overjoyed at changes that would give them a better site design. But that's a tricky circle to square (or letterbox!), and not what you were suggesting anyway (now we know what it is). I just want to plea that any changes be made with a very good idea of all the knock-on effects of 'improving' certain edge-cases, especially when it comes to yet other edge-cases. 172.70.85.23 10:29, 6 February 2024 (UTC)\n\nNew Logo and Banner Proposals\n\nI have new logo and banner proposals for this site.\n\nThey're made on Scratch, an all-ages block-based programming language, and are in the style of Right Click.\n\nHere they are!\n\nLogo proposal: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Logo_proposal_for_explain_xkcd.png\n\nBanner proposal: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Banner_proposal_for_explain_xkcd.png 172.69.71.37 (talk) 01:54, 19 February 2024 (please sign your comments with ~~~~)\n\nI can't see the xkcdicity of the logo, really. The banner is certainly flavourful in the right way (does it scale down well? ...is that what your use of Scratch is for, as opposed to standard static Photoshop/GIMP image editing?), but not sure it'll work better for the current top-left-of-page xkcd (with three xkcd figurses idling away, sat on the letters).\n\nDecent concept art for something else related, certainly. I could believe it was a Randall's-own interactive comic front-end of some kind (which would make sense of the \"play button\" that is the \"â–º\"-bit). Given that it's now in a programming system already, have you tried making a drag'n'click game of the idea of linking/looping the blue-trail, and animating the hanging-on characters? 172.70.90.29 13:34, 19 February 2024 (UTC)\n\nIt's an arrow, not a play button. Get it right. 172.69.71.72 (talk) 01:05, 20 February 2024 (please sign your comments with ~~~~)\n\nHold your horses... I was just trying to find a good reason for the whatever-it-is triangle to be there (gave the example of a 'play' button in my speculated usefulness of it). And it isn't really obviously any more of an arrow (c.f. \"â†’\"), either. I like your(?) banner's use of xkcd-figures, just not sure where the logo exhibits any form of being xkcd-related, except by the literal reading of it.\n\nPerhaps if it were \"xkcd font\" (i.e. artfully composited from actual samples of Randall's ALLCAPS comic-writing) then it wouldn't matter so much, but I just wouldn't say it was any more on-brand than the current logo/etc. This being intended as constructive criticism, I hope you understand. And there's more opinions than mine, so maybe I've indeed just missed some point that everyone else (especially named-users) have already realised. 172.70.86.5 02:33, 20 February 2024 (UTC)\n\nWould it be possible to add an extra decimal point for the sake of precision? Currently, it shows that 0% of comics are unexplained, which is (as of 13:21 UTC on March 27, 2024) incorrect. It's a small thing, but it's rather annoying. 162.158.158.233 (talk) 13:23, 27 March 2024 (please sign your comments with ~~~~)\n\nWith the current 2911 comics (give or take #404), 0.1% would be slightly under 3 comics. You'd need at least three before 0.1% appeared instead of the equally unuseful 0.0%.\n\nI'm of the \"at least give everyone a week before you unilaterally declare it 'done'...\" camp, so right now just the latest M/W/F comic incomplete would hover at a token 0.1%.\n\n(Actually, from two (0.06...% rounded up) to 4 (0.13...% rounded down. The good news is that it'll be almost seven years until two-rounded-up is insufficient, but also up to six-rounded-down is now \"0.1%\", if I've not goofed the carries/etc.)\n\nIf going to the trouble of editing it to 1DP, make it 2DP with exactly the same editing effort..?\n\nWelcome to the explain xkcd wiki!\n\nWe have an explanation for all 2974 xkcd comics, and only 4 (0.13%) are incomplete. Help us finish them!\n\n(As of time of posting, the above says \"only 2 (0.07%)\". From 0.0687049...% rounded up to 2DP.)\n\nThough given that we're only going to go into the future,[citation needed] I suggest we can state the flat-out number. It's not now really going to be as scarily huge as it might have been, as the actual percentage becomes generally less significant.\n\nAnd, for niceness, give it a grammatically/factually agreeable form:\n\nGeneral form\n\n... and {{#ifeq: <!-- count here --> | 0 | no | <!-- count here --> }} comic{{#ifeq: <!-- count here --> | 1 | | s }} [[:Category:Incomplete explanations|{{#ifeq: <!-- count here --> | 1 | is | are }} incomplete]]. ...\n\nZero cases (hardcoded)\n\n... and no comics are incomplete. ...\n\nOne case (hardcoded)\n\n... and 1 comic is incomplete. ...\n\nMultiple cases (hardcoded)\n\n... and 42 comics are incomplete. ...\n\nCurrent cases (dynamic)\n\n... and 4 comics are incomplete. ...\n\n...easy to replicate to get \"Help us finish them!\" to change (upon a zero-test truth) to \"But they all might be improvable!\". Or change the :Cat:Link to not even be a link when zero, with alternate phrasing dodged over to in order to avoid \"no comics are incomplete\" in other ways.\n\nI wrote the above for minimal nesting of overlapping conditions. You might prefer just to go with {{#ifeq: <count> | 0 | <whole \"zero cases\" version> | {{#ifeq: <count> | 1 | <whole \"single case\" version> | <whole \"plurality of cases\" version> }} }} - both approaches involve repetitions, but maybe this other one can be given a degree of wikimarkup-readability within each case, to take pity on future editors. 172.70.160.166 16:02, 27 March 2024 (UTC)\n\nHear me out: What If? discussion page.\n\nThat's it. That's my idea. Go crazy, everyone. Psychoticpotato (talk) 14:05, 4 April 2024 (UTC)\n\nYup, I've been thinking the same thing. I would like a page on each What If entry. Maplestrip (talk) 07:42, 8 April 2024 (UTC)\n\nI've thought about this, over the years. Having 'a page' (rather than the summary table, in the overview page, etc) does sound more completist than what we currently have but I then tend to hit the main ontological problem...\n\nIn the What-Ifs, Randall takes a 'simple' question and then explains the consequences. At length. A 'comic page' structure (starting with how we'd deal with the multiple midpoint images, so we would stray far from using the {{comic}} introduction) that followed the header(image,etc)/explanation/transcript/(trivia)/included-comments format would be silly and have many parts inappropriate. Remove the Transcript, for starters. Or need a mini-Transcript for each 'illustrative' image. (e.g. \":[Black Hat:] What if we tried more power?\", several times.)\n\nIs there an actual need to explain Randall's explanation..? Because that's the only thing 'we' can do. Which is rather silly, and seems like it would take a small (entertainingly rambling) essay and expand it into a large (pedantically rambling) one.\n\nOr else we just straight-copy the What-If over here as a 'backup'-blag? Allowable, but not exactly a USP, there'll be Internet Archive and personal copies, should things go bad at Randall's end. Not really a noble-cause.\n\nMy suggestion, as to how to cover the remaining \"explanation gap\" and provide a useful 'service' that's worthwhile maintaining, is maybe two What If? (Blag) sub-pages:\n\nA place to collate all inter-text images (and hover-/title-texts), and Transcript them, for easy searching.\n\ne.g. when you know you want to refer to the \"bomb to the eyeball\" one (internally or for something external) but think you might not realise where you need to go to (the supernova neutrinos one!) just by scrolling a bare comic list.\n\nOr you'd like to see, at a glance, how many different places the Black Hat Try More Power running joke occurs.\n\nEven if you don't want to open the page itself (160+ 'comics' with say 5 images each, is an 800ish-image page, less rationalising 'repeats' to a single entry), it should at least give you a search result for \"dry waterfall\" that points you in the direction of the \"Niagra Straw\" one (and maybe others?).\n\nI could see these being brief Image/Titletext/Transcript/(optional explanatory context), but not enough material to make them separate comic-style-pages in their own right, right?\n\nSomething of the same 'collation page mechanism' for all those superscript-popup-'footnote' bits. Though I admit I'm not entirely sure for what purpose except that it just seems like a good \"collection page\" to maintain. Perhaps to offer updated onward-links if any of the originals suffer link-rot? (But then, that fate can occur to all non-popupped links, so maybe I've chosen the wrong thing to highlight.)\n\n...the question is, what do you want from it. Bear in mind that if you can creae pages here then you can set up what you think you'd like to see (e.g. for What-If#1, for starters) then get the community to assess it. Do it as a sub-page to your Userspace, maybe, as proof-of-concept.\n\nJust because it's not been seen as necessary so far, doesn't mean it's not necessary. I've thought about it a lot (not thst I'm in a position to inplement anything), but I've only decided that I don't see a need for a straight copy (others' views may differ on that) and not enough reason to pester for my 'ideas' to be fulfilled.

How long do you think the voting period should be?PDesbeginner (talk) 03:42, 19 June 2024 (UTC)\n\nRather than a voting period, I think it would be ideal if people could \"vote\" on the completeness of an article at any time. As I go through all the old pages, I come across lots of pages that feel a little bit incomplete. It would be nice if we had a measurement of completion that wasn't binary. Maplestrip (talk) 10:16, 19 June 2024 (UTC)\n\nFeel free to add the incomplete tag again. But don't forget to mention WHY (either in the tag or the discussion or both) you think it's incomplete. :) The tag is mainly there so you can have a list of \"incomplete\" comics. A comic is either on that list or it isn't. This is pretty much binary. As for voting: If I think an explanation is complete and it bothers me that it's flagged as not I generally juts make a comment in the discussion asking if someone has still something to add or actually knows WHY it's still incomplete. If there's no response after a few days I delete the tag. There's no need to make a voting out of this. And if somone strongly disagrees to you there's always the \"Undo\"-link ;) Elektrizikekswerk (talk) 11:09, 19 June 2024 (UTC)\n\nSometimes I just feel \"this could use more detail,\" without specifically knowing what the detail would look like. This can be a problem when it's about explaining complicated science: the \"completion\" of a description of quantum mechanics that is readable by a novice, is very subjective. I am realizing the problem with the persistent voting idea tho: many people will vote something as \"incomplete\" but wouldn't come back to check on it later. Maplestrip (talk) 12:08, 19 June 2024 (UTC)\n\nI'm more in the \"less is more\" camp. Most of my recent contributions to this wiki were deleting parts of bloated explanations: You don't need to explain quantum mechanics unless it's absolutely crucial for understanding the respective comic. Of course, if you are an expert in any given field, it's hard to tell whether or not the current explanation is sufficient for a layperson and most contributors tend to write \"too much\". Which is totally fine. People like me take care of the \"too much\". ;) So, if you are an expert in quantum mechanics ignore \"completed\" comics about quantum mechanics. Surely you could contribute a lot to it but chances are high that most of it is unnecessary for the comic. Instead ask yourself if you need more information to understand that comic about biology. And if you do, add an incomplete and ask for that information ;) Elektrizikekswerk (talk) 12:31, 19 June 2024 (UTC)\n\nI've been here a long time, effectively back to when there were missing explanations (other than the \"too new to have the barebones put in\" ones, these days only seen when the current BOT is tardy or offline for some reason), and I've seen the Incomplete template change from the useful 'infill marker' to become a regular joke-tag of a similar nature to the Citation Needed. Yes, I agree that both of these (and the Because You're Dumb\" tag) are perhaps a bit confusing for new users (like the one who badly edited out a link, just now, apparently thinking it was spam, because of the way it mentioned viagra), but I have grown to see them as community in-jokes (of various degrees of subtlety) that many people seem to appreciate under their current incarnations.\n\nWe've recently removed the Main Page's more literal \"there are # incomplete articles\" announcement, which leaves the purpose of more accurately using the Incomplete tag a little less important. Apart from letting us dive into the (purported) list of Incomplete Explanations, one of the main serious purposes of the Incomplete tag is removed, leaving the now consistently employed purpose of doing a \"Created by a THING OTHER THAN THE BOT\" joke much more prominent.\n\nReally, all articles are potentially incomplete, still. Some more than others. Something big, like Hoverboard or Gravity, might truly have easter-eggs or subtle details as yet not properly commented upon, but there have been edits to double-digit comics recently which might be considered improvements. As such, there are really only two 'sensible' direct courses of action:\n\nCompletely remove the Incomplete tag, from use, as all pages are only ever as complete as the eye of any particular beholder, and the more recent pages are obviously incomplete by their being barely 15 minutes (or a day, or maybe a week) old. Or being so huge (or Time-like!) that they clearly still haven't been 'completely' documented. Maybe the BOT can add a Created By The Bot tag that gets wiped out by the first serious attempt at human editing, but if we wish to lose this part of our site culture so readily then why ever have it at all? A wikivote system is not really that accurate under these circumstances, for a number of reasons that I needn't explain, so go straight to assuming that any such 'vote' would pass, right from the off...\n\nEmbrace it for its THING OTHER THAN A BOT usage, alone. Don't be so eager to remove them just because you have no personal changes you'd wish to see. (Votes or not, there could always be another editor along in a minute who has, unlike the rest of you, picked up on an obscure visual pun rendered in what turns out to be hieroglyphs, or similar.) If we have to cull them (not a given!), then let it be an unstated rule (or a stated one?) that if there are more than (e.g.) half a dozen then the 'least amusing' may be removed by the first editor who wishes to express a critical opinion. Just the one at a time. No reinstating, no resurrection, no adding to old articles that never ever had a 'joke Incomplete' before, no entirely new joke (but you can refine what's there, to a degree), just a rolling (and not necessarily consecutive!) set of the \"finest natjve explainxkcd wit\". Or at least the least objectionable surviving examples of same.\n\nAs a practical guide, the \"reason why you think it is Incomplete element\" could be entirely served by in-line tags (the \"What?\" and \"Why?\" and \"Date?\" things you might see elsewhere). Perhaps we could even do both things by instead having a \"Complete\" tag explicitly for BOT-REPLACEMENT-type tomfoolery (and tongue-in-cheekness about Completion, as we might currently be about Incometeness) from the off. That might confuse the newbods, of course. At least until it doesn't, and then they're not newbods anymore...\n\nThe companion tag, for Incomplete Transcript, is presumably going to serve as it currently does (as a still serious hint as to actual Incompleteness), albeit that I've noticed a trend for the first editor of a brand new published comic to (possibly after doing the BOT-replacement joke, or after the editor who did only that) go straight in and enTranscript it (to varying degrees of accuracy and completion), whether or not they also then remove that specific tag-template at the same time. It seems that some people are more comfortable at providing a Transcription-service than they are at establishing even the seed of an Explanation. (Or they only have enough time to do the latter, to the level of detail they wish to achieve in the moment open to them.)\n\nThis is, of course, a cultural issue. All the above (from me) is just my own perception of practical aspects, notwithstanding those opinions already expressed before that (and elsewhere). I don't speak for everyone. And, as a perpetual IP, technically I should say that I don't speak for anyone, either... 172.70.160.140 14:21, 19 June 2024 (UTC)\n\nI like the idea of removing the Incomplete tag. What do you think? PDesbeginner (talk) 14:57, 19 June 2024 (UTC)\n\nI greatly approve of a Template:what tag, as a Wikipedian that's actually really funny. I would want to keep the Incomplete tag, as I think it has purpose, even if it no longer represents a goal to achieve. I think this website will never reach 100.00% completeness and that is good, actually. Maplestrip (talk) 14:05, 26 June 2024 (UTC)\n\nOkay. If someone wants to they can just ignore the incomplete tags. PDesbeginner (talk) 14:37, 28 June 2024 (UTC)\n\n\"As of <now>\"...\n\nWhat would be rather useful is an {{As of now}} template (or similar wording, and perhaps an \"as of now\"-cased alternative for use mid-sentence). There are many articles that will have words along the lines of \"this has not yet happened, as of August 2024\" or \"this situation is continuing, as of August 2024\". Every now and then, someone will come across one of these with an older date (perhaps only just out of date, perhaps years old) and edit it accordingly. You could also seek them all out, deliberately, with a bit of effort in the search-bar.\n\n(Note that \"as of\" does not always need updating, there are non-dated examples such as in 1074: Moon Landing#Trivia, static transcript versions, like 1071: Exoplanets#Transcript and other instances where the text \"as of\", with or without a date, really does not need to be changed... but sometimes is anyway by a well-meaning passer-by.)\n\nSometimes, this can be done along with another useful edit/update/revision that is spotted, or is just one of the revisions that some other need for change conveniently allows. But it seems a bit vague to rely upon occasional attention. Instead the template will implement something like \"As of {{Monthyear}}\" (here having to use {{#time:F Y}}, ...\"As of August 2024\"...), though there's the possibility that a parameter-mediated switch can let it alternatively become a to-the-day-level format option (at which point you could even implement/calcuate something like {{Yesterday}} would be) or just to the year-level. (Or add {{As of this year}}, {{As of this month}} and {{As of this day}} separately.)\n\nThis would negate the need to just poke and prod any article that happened to 'need' updating every month (or year, or possible day). And to deal with the possibility that some of these cases might actually need to be edited because \"as of\" does not now apply, include within it a Category:As of membership, letting anyone who is interested keep an eye on these aggregated 'As of's, ready to jump in there and change it to some straight up \"Up until <fixed date>\" equivalent should any one of them actually no longer apply.\n\n...obviously, I can't even begin to create the template page required, but I'd be happy to work on the exact wikimedia code required if anyone thinks it needs anything but the most basic transcluded formatting and doesn't know how. Open to discussion, and I'll tag on more if I happen to see that discussion developing. 172.70.162.186 18:04, 4 August 2024 (UTC)\n\nAs an addendum/change to my above suggestion, considering a simpler {{as of}} (and {{As of}}) which does no automagical continuous updating (just gives the \"as of\" literal on its own), but still guarantees \"Category:As of\" membership, so that it doesn't actively give wrong (new) date+circumstance relationships in the likes of 1047: Approximations. In that, the several mentions of populations can safely stay as old years until someone rewrites the proposed value and assessment as well, but it still could be a task to pursue every new year after checking the Cat for likely comics needing a quick check'n'edit.\n\nTechnical\n\nWe need more maintainers\n\nI'm moving a thread that Davidy22 started on my talk page. The gist is, we need more people with server-side access (especially mediawiki-savvy ones) so we can properly deal with several issues that have been plaguing the wiki for a while now, most notably spam, but also the image scaling problem, a possible extension for proper comments, clean urls, etc. Below is the original thread, please comment. --Waldir (talk) 17:56, 25 November 2012 (UTC)\n\nCould you set the permissions so that all anon users have to pass a captcha to edit? The spam has gotten obscene, and they've stopped posting links, so our current detection mechanisms aren't working anymore. Davidy22(talk) 08:21, 25 November 2012 (UTC)\n\nI would love to have the ability to tweak the wiki more thoroughly, but currently Jeff's the only one with server access. To be honest, I am not terribly familiar with server-side mediawiki management, so I haven't asked Jeff for access, but it's clear we can't be dependent on a single person to do all the mediawiki config (and Jeff probably knows even less about mediawiki than I do). Are you by any chance acquainted with server-side mediawiki maintenance? I think we could present a good case for having someone else with access to a dev/prototype instance of this wiki on Jeff's server so we could at least experiment and tell him exactly what needs to be done. Thoughts? --Waldir (talk) 17:40, 25 November 2012 (UTC)\n\nI agree that we need more people that are empowered to actively fight spam. I think that we ought to promote Davidy22 to administrator also, so that he can delete pages and block spammers/vandals as he notices them rather than letting them pile up until yourself, IronyChef, or myself notice that there's work that needs done.\n\nWhat I think we should do is break out rights into more groups than simply administrator and bureaucrat. I think that's too big of a jump, and that there should be some gradiation. I think we should add a moderator (mark pages as patrolled and rollback ability (as much as it's a sledgehammer when you really only need a ball-peen hammer)) position.\n\nI think we also need a spam fighter position, but that might not be possible to implement. It should be a position that allows the person to delete pages with 1 or 2 edits (page creation, marked as spam, maybe as high as 3 or 4 for the bots that repeat edit certain pages) and block users with 1 or 2 edits. The real problem there is how to grant those super-powerful abilities without allowing them to lose their mind and go crazy and destroy the wiki. Of course, if we don't catch it early enough there's going to be those IPs that manage to get to six edits, and those will have to be squashed by a full admin. We will also need a way of tagging those spam accounts so when a full admin passes by they will also know to ban the IP address after a spam fighter has deleted all the pages it created.\n\nFinally, we also need a more active bureaucrat so that we don't have to bug Jeff to promote admin's as well as future moderators and/or spam fighters, and recognize bot accounts as bot accounts. We also should find someone knowledgeable to help Jeff (and maybe he has little helpers) to maintain the actual server. I've done some PHP work, but I've never touched anything deep inside a wiki (I like Ruby and Rails much more). This is my first time gaining admin status on a wiki, so I have no idea what the extra dials and levers do/mean. I look up on the MediaWiki manual and Wikipedia help pages things that I think should be possible, and often times pages exist in places about doing these things, but I'm nowhere near being called knowledgeable. After I finish up some IRL work I'm currently tied up in, I intend to set up a VM webserver on my computers and run a mediawiki install so I can learn how to work (and not break) things without putting explain xkcd in jeopardy.\n\nAnother really wordy post from, lcarsos_a (talk) 22:01, 29 November 2012 (UTC)\n\nFrom what I know, a moderator user group is possible, but not the spam fighter one. Then again, too many hierarchical levels may be too much for such a small body of regulars. Implementing the moderator group is easy, mw:Manual:User rights has the details (the \"ninja\" example and the \"list of permissions\" section should be enough for putting together the configuration commands to be added to the wiki's LocalSettings.php).\n\nAs for bureaucrats, I think it makes sense but it seems to me that Jeff only takes longer to perform changes that affect the server, as they understandably may take longer or be more complex (or break the wiki!). Bureaucrats' only difference from admins is that they can promote/demote other users, and this Jeff has been doing without delay, so perhaps there isn't a need for more bureaucrats at the moment. Please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nWe do need more sysadmins (people with access to the server), though, for sure. This is a little tricky as none of us is comfortable enough to confidently make server changes in a mediawiki install. Jeff, how about putting the wiki in source control and giving two or three people access to it, so that any wrongdoings can be easily reverted? You could setup a git repository in the server and we could fork it locally to our machines, make tests and push the commits to the server repo whenever they're ready. --Waldir (talk) 17:20, 5 December 2012 (UTC)\n\nThis is good stuff. I'm down with promoting more admins for spam fighting. If they screw stuff up we can demote them if necessary. I really haven't found a spam fighting extension that I think will be the best possible solution. I'll keep looking as it may be a combination of things. Server access is much more complicated as it is not even my server and it is shared hosting. I think that would be best to be accessed just by me. --Jeff (talk) 19:10, 19 December 2012 (UTC)\n\nRegarding the server, I understand -- your position seems reasonable. In any case, I've been looking for extensions that may help taking some workload out of server actions and make more stuff configurable via the wiki itself. I'll report back if I find something usable.\n\nOn another note, how do you feel about promoting more bureaucrats? I suggest Lcarsos who's been consistently active for the past few months. --Waldir (talk) 12:47, 4 January 2013 (UTC)\n\nPersonally I'd kind of like to go and make some changes myself. Come up with a nice short url pattern and set it up. Upgrade the wiki. etc... Dantman (talk) 02:44, 23 March 2013 (UTC)\n\nThe shorter URL is being looked into, although Mediawiki strongly advises against it. As for upgrades to the wiki, monetary donations towards Jeff so he can buy better bit for the server would be appreciated. DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 03:06, 23 March 2013 (UTC)\n\nMediaWiki does not advise against it. Half the code currently running short URLs in core was written by me. Same for the new standard for rewrite rules in the new guides. And the tool to automatically generate the config needed to apply short urls to a wiki. Short URLs are not advised against.\n\nWe do however strongly advise against installing a wiki in /wiki. Because you do not want to create /wiki/$1 style paths while your script path makes scripts look like /wiki/index.php.\n\nIn this case my plan would be to move /wiki to /w then come up with some other short url pattern like /e/$1, some other path, or maybe /$1.\n\nAnd setup some 301 redirects to redirect from the old urls to the new ones.\n\nAnd upgrading the version of MediaWiki so that it doesn't have security holes doesn't require server replacement. Dantman (talk) 07:09, 23 March 2013 (UTC)\n\nOhwait, software upgrades. Uh. I knew you were talking about that. Yep. Definitely. The wiki recently had issues with running out of hard drive space, so that was all that was on my mind there.\n\nAlso, I thought you had been referring to this. Whoop. Well, you could leave Jeff a message at his talk page to get server access. DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 08:05, 23 March 2013 (UTC)\n\nI strongly support this. It's been far too long since we decided we'd want the short url scheme (/$1 seems like the best option since it would be simpler/cleaner and allow http://explainxkcd/1234 to point to the correct comic without any extra rewrite rules). While you're at it, I'm sure many would appreciate a look at the current situation with image resizing, which doesn't seem to be working for some reason. Installing Extension:Comments would be awesome, too, as well as Extension:Contribution Scores (live example). I'll ask Jeff to take a look at this thread. --Waldir (talk) 20:07, 23 March 2013 (UTC)\n\nDantman (talk) email me and I'll get you set up with whatever you need. All the suggestions sound good to me. --Jeff (talk) 00:10, 24 March 2013 (UTC)\n\nAlso, the Contribution Scores are up. I'm not even top 10 all time, I need to step up my game. Comments will take more work as it needs its own database. --Jeff (talk) 00:10, 24 March 2013 (UTC)\n\nAwesome! I did some styling changes to make it more interesting :) Let me know what you guys think about it! --Waldir (talk) 20:32, 24 March 2013 (UTC)\n\nHoly crud, what did you do when the wiki started to have almost double my lifetime score? DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 23:57, 24 March 2013 (UTC)\n\nHahahah :P I'm pretty sure I cheated a little, IIRC there was an image renaming operation for which I used mwclient ;) --Waldir (talk) 03:22, 25 March 2013 (UTC)\n\nSort by numbers in categories\n\nI noticed that in Category:Comics all comics are sorted correctly by numbers; but not in any subcategory. (I didn't really get the explanation of how it works on the comics page.) How to fix this? -- St.nerol (talk) 10:40, 22 December 2012 (UTC)\n\nThe comics template uses a template called num4 that turns the number in the comic number field into a four-digit number. That's then passed as a parameter to the category link, and the comics category page sorts articles by those four-digit numbers instead of their actual names. If we wanted to do the same for other categories, we would have to type them all out as [[Category:Politics|0200]], or whatever the comic number is. I would rather wait for mediawiki to come out with an in-built feature to solve this. Davidy22[talk] 11:28, 22 December 2012 (UTC)\n\nIs there a reason that the template applies that directly to Category:Comics and not as a default sortkey via DEFAULTSORT? â€“ Philosopher Let us reason together. 12:10, 1 January 2013 (UTC)\n\nGood thinking. Using DEFAULTSORT oughta make it work for all categories. I'll give it a try. --Waldir (talk) 15:37, 1 January 2013 (UTC)\n\nResize\n\nI haven't been here (to edit) for a while, but have we still not addressed the bug that doesn't allow image resizing? I know most of us don't have access to that kind of lower-level coding on the site, but I think it's a bit of a notable issue that we can't display comics smaller than their actual size. TheHYPO (talk) 14:24, 21 January 2013 (UTC)\n\nTake it up with User:Jeff, but I suspect that adding your voice to the already insistent roaring that images are broken isn't going to inspire much change. lcarsos_a (talk) 18:08, 23 January 2013 (UTC)\n\nIncidental Ads\n\nas ive noticed i think you should check if someone has embeded some of your links with ads really annoying please fix\n\n--TheWeatherMan (talk) 14:00, 23 January 2013 (UTC)TheWeatherMan\n\nDo you have any specific examples of this? By the way, using punctuation, capitalization, spell check, and complete sentences are more likely to get someone to help you. lcarsos_a (talk) 18:10, 23 January 2013 (UTC)\n\nThere is known malware (both adware and viruses) that makes Wikipedia look like it has ads. This wiki uses the same wiki software, so perhaps that malware affects our site too? â€“ Philosopher Let us reason together. 05:42, 15 February 2013 (UTC)\n\n/wiki/\n\nNow that explainxkcd redirects straight to the wiki, could we take the /wiki/ out of the url? I'd also like the wiki's edit log to be purged to clean out the history and forget about past spam, but that's probably wishing for too much. Davidy22[talk] 04:06, 28 January 2013 (UTC)\n\nBut seriously, could the /wiki/ go? It'll screw with the spammers for a day or two, at the very least. Davidy22[talk] 11:37, 30 January 2013 (UTC)\n\nJust created the my first page, 220: Philosophy, but I could use a little guidance. How do I find the date that an xkcd comic was originally posted, and how do I rig up the previous-comic and next-comic arrows on a page? (Actually, I've noticed several pages that should have the arrows but don't.) Ekedolphin (talk) 11:19, 28 January 2013 (UTC)\n\nThose arrows will automagically insert themselves when you make the adjacent comic explanations. There *is* a little backstage magic that needs to be taken care of, but we can do that for you. Davidy22[talk] 11:40, 28 January 2013 (UTC)\n\nOK. How about the dates? Ekedolphin (talk) 11:41, 28 January 2013 (UTC)\n\nClick on \"All Comics\" in the navbar on left-hand side of the site. The dates are in the form YYYY-MM-DD. Davidy22[talk] 11:56, 28 January 2013 (UTC)\n\nThe comic template checks for the existence of the numerical redirect for the comic before and the comic after. If it finds the page to exist it will display the next/previous button as appropriate. So, by creating the redirects listed on the List of all comics (third column, only worry about the number and title links) future pages will automatically get the links created. Redirect pages look like #REDIRECT [[####: Comic Title]] and that's it (here is a link to the redirect page with redirect disabled so you can look at the source to see what I'm talking about). That's all that needs to exist on the number and title redirects. If you feel up to creating them yourself, feel free, otherwise someone else goes through occasionally and mass adds all the missing redirects. lcarsos_a (talk) 17:55, 29 January 2013 (UTC)\n\nError message\n\nI've been getting this error message a lot the last cup'o days.

I don't think there's much we can do about this, other than move the wiki onto a more powerful server. But, there are no ads on this site, there is no revenue model, just a very kind person paying for hosting that keeps this site up.

I had to find Jeff on twitter because I'd get SQL errors when I tried to edit his talk page. He's looking into history deletion plugins, to clear out our vast archives of deleted spam and obsoleted prototype comic templates. DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 08:10, 23 March 2013 (UTC)\n\nInstall a caching reverse proxy to handle heavy load\n\nAccording to returned headers, this server runs from Apache directly. I would recommend setting up a reverse caching proxy in front of Apache to handle high traffic load (like, e.g. current load). The one I use is nginx (http://nginx.org/) -- admins, drop me an email if you need help setting it up Fry-kun (talk) 21:38, 26 March 2013 (UTC)\n\nThe standard software to use is either Squid or Varnish. Nginx is a bit too much of a webserver to be configured in the way MW needs iirc. Although nginx would help with serving the static assets. Unfortunately there will be a need to switch to a proper server first. The site seems to be hosted on shared hosting. Dantman (talk) 04:59, 27 March 2013 (UTC)\n\nI had gotten burned before with both Squid and Varnish but Nginx had always kept my systems alive. It's extremely lightweight and works great to fix these kinds of problems. But, of course if it's a shared server where you can't use it, it won't help... Fry-kun (talk) 16:35, 27 March 2013 (UTC)\n\nNginx is a great webserver. It'll serve out static pages much better than Apache. But the issue here isn't the webserver. It's PHP and all the work that the database needs to do on every request. Switching webservers won't get rid of that issue. Using squid/varnish a proper reverse proxying cache will allow complete pages to be cached and served directly to readers bypassing the webserver, php, and the database entirely on some requests. That'll reduce the load the site has to cope with. Dantman (talk) 23:47, 27 March 2013 (UTC)\n\nA couple of enwiki features implemented\n\nI have \"imported\" {{disambig}} and the related category for the one page it was needed for (to avoid having a page that was uncategorised :-) ).\n\nI have also created {{unsigned ip}} (and converted the one use of {{unsigned}}) and applied it for a handful of existing uses of {{unsigned}}. It hardly matters, but then it's also only three more characters to type for new uses.\n\nImportantly, however, I implore you to consider including the second datestamp parameter when applying either template -- it's actually the more useful information. I know it's a pain to convert times back to UTC, but, hey, most of you don't have to deal with a half hour timezone :-) Mark Hurd (talk) 16:19, 13 April 2013 (UTC)\n\nUrrggh, there's an option to make UTC the default display time. The template oughta be a little more automated, mebbe filling the time in automagically with five tildes if no date field is entered? The time will be a bit off when editors fill in the unsigned templates, but it'll be close enough to the actual value. DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 23:59, 13 April 2013 (UTC)\n\nNo, especially while there's existing templates to adjust, where the \"default\" datestamp would be way out. If someone wants to fix a lot of the existing usage, setting their timezone to UTC is the simplest option. Mark Hurd (talk) 09:14, 14 April 2013 (UTC)\n\nThis thread has been moved to The proposals board.\n\nNeed password reset\n\nSorry to bother you all, but I seem to have lost the password to this account and don't have an email set (which requires the password). I'm still logged in thanks to the \"remember me\" feature but after 30 days I'll lose access. This isn't fixable at the MediaWiki level; someone with access to the server mysql or whatever will need to change something. Is there such a person I can email with? Splainr (talk) 03:05, 15 April 2013 (UTC)\n\nI assume your browser isn't remembering it for you? Mark Hurd (talk) 03:08, 15 April 2013 (UTC)\n\nOh wow that was fast. Nope, neither Firefox not OSX keychain access know what it is. Splainr (talk) 15:18, 15 April 2013 (UTC)\n\nI'm not sure how to solve that problem, but I know account usurpation has been done for the single-login transition in Wikimedia wikis, so technically it should be doable. --Waldir (talk) 23:04, 16 April 2013 (UTC)\n\nSee mw:Manual:Resetting passwords. --Mormegil (talk) 11:59, 15 May 2013 (UTC)\n\nAnalytics\n\nRecently I found out about WikiApiary, an interesting site that collects analytics from mediawiki wikis. I added explain xkcd. Check the stats that have been collected so far: http://wikiapiary.com/wiki/explain_xkcd --Waldir (talk) 00:03, 17 April 2013 (UTC)\n\n\"External\" hotlinking enabled to confirm issue with other car.jpg\n\nFYI I have enabled \"external\" hotlinking to this wiki's own images to show File:other car.jpg can display correctly. See further notes about that issue here. Mark Hurd (talk) 14:32, 21 April 2013 (UTC)\n\nIf the problem is lack of thumbnail generation, it should display correctly even without hotlinking, simply by using the original size, e.g.\n\nI'm not sure why it doesn't. In any case, this image hotlinking thing reminded me, would it be a good idea to use the images hosted at XKCD.com and only upload variants to the wiki (e.g. those at Category:Helper comic images) and images Randall for some reason deleted from the server (e.g. images with typos)? This would reduce the load on the explainxkcd server and provide a better experience for viewers since xkcd is already optimized for high loads and actually openly provides the image urls for hotlinking. --Waldir (talk) 15:01, 21 April 2013 (UTC)\n\nSeeing as User:Daddy's upload has fixed the wiki always attempting to display the thumbnail version (which still don't work), I have disabled the \"hotlinking\" again.\n\nMark Hurd (talk) 11:32, 22 April 2013 (UTC)\n\nRedirect from explainxkcd.com/1234\n\nIt would be really cool if http://www.explainxkcd.com/<number> redirected to the explain page for that number. That would allow people to get to the correct explanation by simply adding explain to the comic url.\n\nIf you are willing to do this, all you would need to do (assuming you run apache with mod_rewrite enabled) is put the following in .htaccess in your web root:\n\nRewriteEngine on RewriteRule ^(\\d+)/?$ /wiki/index.php?title=$1 [R,L]\n\n-Sionide21 (talk) 22:28, 7 June 2013 (UTC)\n\nYeah!

Now if we could just have clean URLs too, that'd be swell! ;) --Waldir (talk) 05:02, 14 November 2013 (UTC)\n\nIncomplete â€“ motivation\n\nIs it possible to fix (or is there already) a way to add a motivation with the \"incomplete\"-tag? I tried {{incomplete|the title text needs explaining}}, which made \"edit it\" in the banner link to the uncreated page \"the title text...\"... â€“â€“St.nerol (talk) 12:16, 10 June 2013 (UTC)\n\nYou can use the {{notice|Your text...}} template:\n\nHere is my notice.\n\n--Dgbrt (talk) 17:30, 10 June 2013 (UTC)\n\nThanks!

When I hit edit a screen appears which says \"This page has been protected to prevent editing.\" I've never edited before, but I'm annoyed by the improper use of the word candid. \"It would be candid and unrealistic\" would be better off in that sentence if candid was removed. How do I make it so I can edit the page, so I can remove this affront to the English language?\n\nI believe you are trying to edit the main page. You can click \"Latest comic\" in the left sidebar or the \"Go to this comic\" button in the top right corner of the grey box to go to the actual page for today's comic.

This covers up some of the useful buttons up there, like LOGIN for example. The workaround is to refresh the page. Because the banner ad is the last thing to load, you have a brief window of maybe three seconds to find and click the link you need. Gardnertoo (talk) 20:24, 26 July 2013 (UTC)\n\nFixed. --Jeff (talk) 21:12, 25 October 2013 (UTC)\n\nBookmarklet for jumping to explainxkcd.com from xkcd.com\n\nI wrote a short bookmarklet for jumping from xkcd.com to explainxkcd.com.

But bringing it to general attention.

Which I uploaded to the wiki here, for convenience and because it's part of this wiki's history, in a way, and also, cool. - Cos (talk) 10:39, 16 April 2014 (UTC) (PS: also, facebook.com/explainxkcd/photos/10150144122985214; but JPEG.)\n\nBy adding \"exp\" at the beginning of the URL one can easily switch from xkcd.com/1234 to expxkcd.com/1234, which redirects to the corresponding explanation here, and that's nice. But right now, expxkcd.com redirects to 1355 (at least for me), instead of 1356, the latest comic.

The LATESTCOMIC template is updated and so it seems only be an issue on that damn Cloud Service Cache. Even Randall's pages are affected. At \"What-if\" I still have to use <CTRL+R> to get the latest content. --Dgbrt (talk) 00:26, 18 April 2014 (UTC)\n\nWe're talking about a different thing related to shortened URLs.

I could have it grab the number from your page and do this once a day at something like 00:10 EST (because Randall sometimes does things on other days), that's a possibility as well (other times / intervals may also be done if you wish/want). greptalk04:34, 02 May 2014 (UTC)\n\nOur LATESTCOMIC page and Randall's xkcd json page should both have up-to-date comic numbers for you to pull. Ours is probably the better one to pull since your site is linking to us. DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 06:30, 2 May 2014 (UTC)\n\nThe script now checks Template:LATESTCOMIC every 30 minutes to see if the comic has changed or not. If you wish, I might be able narrow this down to 11PM->6AM (for 30 minute checking) and then have it check every two hours at other times or something similar to that (if systemd.time has a way to do it) greptalk12:13, 09 May 2014 (UTC)\n\nI still do not see that problems. Please touch this wiki as less as needed, this is still the best choice. But there is still a big problem on the cache, an update on a picture lasts many hours. Some statements in \"LocalSettings.php\" should work, if not this wiki version is buggy. Problems should be solved at the cause and not be overridden by some additional scripts. --Dgbrt (talk) 21:51, 9 May 2014 (UTC)\n\nWe have ample bandwidth for a bot that only checks once every half-hour. The image caching issue is irrelevant to the current topic. DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 03:45, 10 May 2014 (UTC)\n\nExplain xkcd upgraded to version 1.19.17\n\nWoo! DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 17:59, 26 July 2014 (UTC)\n\nThe header seems to have broken, there is no longer a link to the explanation in it. 173.245.56.154 22:00, 26 July 2014 (UTC)\n\nWhich header are you talking about? All the links I can think of still seem to work. DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 02:13, 27 July 2014 (UTC)\n\nIt fixed itself shortly after I mentioned it. It was the incomplete explanation, the link to 428 was bold, but not a link. 173.245.56.154 04:48, 27 July 2014 (UTC)\n\nOne of the ads is broken.\n\n0100011101100001011011010110010101011010011011110110111001100101 (talk page) 04:33, 27 July 2014 (UTC)\n\nOoh, thanks for catching that. Should be fixed now. DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 17:08, 27 July 2014 (UTC)\n\nNice :) But is this update a preparation for an upcoming update to one of the latest versions, or are we limited to 1.19 for some reason? I'm asking because 1.19 is only supported for a few more months, and also because with newer versions we'd have access to some niceties -- for example, after version 1.20 the PAGESINCAT magic word accepts parameters, which would allow the count of explained comics in the main page to work using less hardcoded hacks. --Waldir (talk) 16:08, 27 July 2014 (UTC)\n\nPrior attempts to update the wiki have been prevented by the realization that Lunarpages doesn't give us quite as much control over our server share as we thought we had. Checking again, they seem to have upgraded the version of PHP on our server since we last attempted and failed to run one dumb update script, which should mean that it'll work next time we try it. The wiki also has quite a bit of user effort invested into it now, and I'm a little less ready to jump into .0~.3 releases than I would normally be on my own machine, so I upgraded down the LTS path that I knew would be safe. After the first ill-planned attempt, I've been eyeing the 1.23 LTS line for the next major jump, but I'm certainly not stepping into it while it's still relatively fresh. DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 17:08, 27 July 2014 (UTC)\n\nSounds reasonable. Thanks for the details. I'll be looking forward to the next update :) --Waldir (talk) 18:52, 28 July 2014 (UTC)\n\nJust wanting to offer, I use ARP Networks for hosting, you should check them out if you want more control. 173.245.56.154 (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~)\n\nHum, there's an option. I'll keep that in mind. DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 04:35, 29 July 2014 (UTC)\n\nIt wasn't me that posted that comment. But surprisingly enough anon and I have the same first two bytes in our IP addresses. Congrats on the version upgrade. lcarsos_a (talk) 05:31, 29 July 2014 (UTC)\n\nWhy does the site say I'm blocking ads when I'm not? I do use AdBlock Plus, but it's turned off for this site. Screenshot here. And while I'm here, that \"unblock us\" text has an error- the first \"and\" in the second sentence shouldn't be there. NealCruco (talk) 01:51, 29 July 2014 (UTC)\n\nThe text only appears when the ads fail to load. The error message actually says noscript, which means that the Javascript that the ad box uses to fetch images isn't running. How long has this been happening for you? DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 04:35, 29 July 2014 (UTC)\n\nIt just started. I came over here as soon as I noticed it. NealCruco (talk) 19:07, 29 July 2014 (UTC)\n\nHave you recently made any changes to your browser? Does the problem persist when you hit CTRL+SHIFT+R? DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 12:43, 30 July 2014 (UTC)\n\nNope, no recent changes. And yes, the problem persists when I hit Ctrl+Shift+R. NealCruco (talk) 14:04, 30 July 2014 (UTC)\n\nI am genuinely puzzled. The message tells me that something is causing your browser to fail to load/run the Javascript that makes the ad render and report stats, so the problem could be anything that can cause that: noscript, outdated browser, experimentation. I don't know anything about your setup, and it works on my test machines, so I can't tell currently what's wrong.

(|< < Prev Comic Next > >| format)\n\nI usually browse in a very small window and the menu buttons split kind of strangely (http://i.imgur.com/wPE7szZ.png). Would it be possible to replace the spaces with nonbreaking spaces? --173.245.56.202 15:13, 1 August 2014 (UTC)\n\nAnnoyingly, the spaces that are giving you trouble can't be changed because they're text string inputs, and Mediawiki has no regular expression markup yet. Every other instance of formatting-critical spaces has been changed to non-breaking spaces though, thanks for the heads up! DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 18:13, 2 August 2014 (UTC)\n\nI think I fixed this by adding a space between the buttons. Unfortunately, this only works as long as the comic is not as wide as the button bar. I guess this is because of the surrounding table. --SlashMe (talk) 20:15, 2 August 2014 (UTC)\n\nNot receiving password reset emails\n\nI've forgotten my password, and password reset is not working for me. I went to Special:PasswordReset, and had it send me a reset email. However, I have not received the email. I am sure that I have an email associated with my account, and it's confirmed. 173.245.54.174 08:38, 18 August 2014 (UTC)\n\nTested, password reset emails seem to work for me. Have you checked your spam folder? DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 18:04, 24 August 2014 (UTC)\n\nI checked in Gmail in \"Mail & Spam & Trash\", and it still doesn't find it. I tried a fresh reset, so we'll see if that comes through. No luck after a minute or two. 108.162.216.71 04:59, 28 August 2014 (UTC)\n\nTOR Captcha\n\nHi, I use TOR. To access your website, cloudfare has made it such that I have to enter a captcha. This is very inconvenient, as your site is not the only one doing this. Can you please fix this issue? You should be able to see a guide here: https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/599/cloudflares-captcha-screen-insurmountable . Thank you for taking the time to consider this. 141.101.104.60 11:34, 13 September 2014 (UTC)\n\nIs it better now? DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 13:06, 13 September 2014 (UTC)\n\nSorry, no. I still get the captcha. What did you try doing? 108.162.216.87 22:09, 13 September 2014 (UTC)\n\nSet the threat level threshold way up. Any further steps into cheap botnet territory. For your security, you may want to reconsider the nodes through which you're operating through. Also, why do you need to use Tor to visit us? DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 04:17, 14 September 2014 (UTC)\n\nAh, okay, thanks, now I'm not getting the captcha. As for why I'm using Tor, I don't need to, but I'd rather do so just to be anonymous. I wouldn't have written if it were just your site, but since Cloudfare has made captchas the default setting for Tor, the internet is starting to become near unusable. So that everyday people aren't scared away from using Tor due to the perceived complexity of daily browsing, whenever I have to enter a captcha, I try to contact someone at the site to ask them to change the setting. 108.162.216.82 06:52, 14 September 2014 (UTC)\n\nUpgrade to the latest MediaWiki version?\n\nI think we should start trying to maintain a regular upgrade schedule of some sort. 6 months ago was the last time we've upgraded, and I think we should upgrade again. The impetus for this change would be for translation features, plus other multilinguality efforts that require the new versions of MediaWiki. Localization efforts should be put into place, and the translate feature would work well for that. Chess (talk) 01:53, 12 November 2014 (UTC)\n\nPlans to upgrade only include LTS releases. That said though, the recent and unintentional server downtime was actually the result of a setup for a coming mediawiki upgrade, among other things. The plan is to upgrade to 1.23 sometime in the coming months, during the weekend after a satisfactory number of bugfix releases. We're very interested in setting up translations, although mediawiki in it's current form already supports translation; the extensions you linked are mostly quality-of-life additions. It's been delayed because the plan is to eliminate all incomplete comics first so that translators have a solid base to work from. DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 02:42, 12 November 2014 (UTC)\n\nCan I just be nitpicky and say that we last upgraded about 3.5 months ago, not 6? Thanks. NealCruco (talk) 03:17, 12 November 2014 (UTC)\n\nFix HTTPS access\n\nexplain xkcd is using Cloudflare which recently enabled HTTPS for all users, but when accessing it via HTTPS it returns error 521. In order to fix this in addiction to the solution steps proposed by CloudFlare check if SSL settings are correct. 173.245.52.138 (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~)\n\nOn it DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 18:51, 13 November 2014 (UTC)\n\nHTTPS is working now, there just some mixed-content warnings, mostly on style tags which being active mixed content are blocked, but it's still a good improvement as it's possible to have more privacy when browsing explain xkcd. 188.114.99.35 (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~)\n\nWhoever has server access, can they try changing $wgServer (Manual:$wgServer) to use a protocol relative url? As the manual page says, you may also want to set $wgCanonicalServer to a fully-qualified url (hopefully defaulting to https). Behrat (talk) 04:17, 29 October 2015 (UTC)\n\nDone. How's it now? DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 08:42, 31 October 2015 (UTC)\n\nMuch better! The styles and scripts are loaded now, and the page looks good. It's still not completely green https because it's loading some images over plain http, but my browser at least appears to be allowing them for now. If you want any more suggestions on technical issues, let me know. I currently maintain my own mediawiki installation with full https, cloudflare, and short urls. Behrat (talk) 20:27, 4 November 2015 (UTC)\n\nHuh. Is it the ad images? The comic pictures *should* be also done over https, no? DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 07:10, 5 November 2015 (UTC)\n\nYeah, one of them is the ad images (http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/lunarpages_160x600.jpg). Most of them are from MediaWiki:Common.css, so you could just change all the urls on that css page to protocol-relative. The only other one I see is http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/3.0/88x31.png, which I think is set at $wgFooterIcons, but I'm not sure. All of them appear to be accessible over https, so just changing the links should work. Behrat (talk) 01:13, 6 November 2015 (UTC)\n\nIf I replace xkcd with explainxkcd I get a very ugly CSS-less page in Chrome on Win7. If I change the https to http, the page works 141.101.105.12 06:07, 3 September 2015 (UTC)\n\nCan you provide more information about your setup? Test a different browser? Unable to reproduce. DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 11:56, 3 September 2015 (UTC)\n\nI can reproduce in Firefox. This is due to the mixed content blocker. Usually, it should only block active content (scripts) and maybe warn about passive content (stylesheets), but at least in Firefox, it is configurable to block both. But I cannot see why the stylesheets shouldn't be served via HTTPS.\n\nCurrently, the styles are referenced absolutely (http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/...), but they should rather by referenced domain-relative (/wiki/...) or at least protocol-relative (//www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/...). --SlashMe (talk) 16:29, 3 September 2015 (UTC)\n\nRSS feed issue\n\nWhen attempting to access the feed for this wiki I'm told \"Sorry. No feed found.\" Is there some way that the feed can be restored to the satisfaction of Feedly? Could it be due to some validation issues, or should I consider changing my news reader? Pmw57 (talk) 23:08, 7 January 2015 (UTC)\n\nHuh. The feed updates automatically with a script that I wrote a while ago, I'm very sure it passed more than this the last time I checked. Fixed a few things, left the one about the date because that's a pain to fix, and one that I can't figure out for the life of me. I think I fixed the line that was causing the actual problems though. Should update on feedly now. DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 01:52, 8 January 2015 (UTC)\n\nHallelujah - the feed was mixed in with other geeky material and it only took me nearly 8 months to notice that nothing was coming through from here anymore. I'm premature with my thanks though. The RSS link in the navigation pane to the left still doesn't want to be understood by Feedly. By contrast, other feeds such as for latest changes can be picked up. Pmw57 (talk) 02:04, 8 January 2015 (UTC)\n\nHrm. Sent an email to feedly about it, Just tested and I'm having similar issues with feedly. DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 02:17, 8 January 2015 (UTC)\n\nIt seems it's not just Feedly. When I use Chrome's RSS Feed Reader, that too also tells me \"No posts here yet\" followed by the an ever helpful \"Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp\" Pmw57 (talk) 02:33, 8 January 2015 (UTC)\n\nCould it be that it's just not valid XML? I see that it ends at line 236 with </item> with no other closing tags, for example. Pmw57 (talk) 03:18, 8 January 2015 (UTC)\n\nOhwait a minute, the auto updater rips old entries off the bottom and that's where there's supposed to be a closing channel and RSS tag. well. DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 07:19, 8 January 2015 (UTC)\n\nIt's good to know that the cause is now known - I'll let you (or someone else with the authority) get on with fixing things up :-) Pmw57 (talk) 07:46, 8 January 2015 (UTC)\n\nHullo. It's not perfect that only one specific formation of the URL works, but it's a start. DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 08:01, 8 January 2015 (UTC)\n\nYou sir do God's work - and that coming from a Dillahunty-following Atheist is saying something. Pmw57 (talk) 08:11, 8 January 2015 (UTC)\n\nMy reader has been refusing to process the feed for the last few days. I finally un-busied enough to poke into why.

I could pro'ly come up with something workable, given the access. --Ericm301 (talk) 16:50, 9 August 2015 (UTC)\n\nWhat on earth is happening here I don't even know. The script seems fine, I repaired the RSS file again manually. See if it malfunctions again today. DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 01:22, 10 August 2015 (UTC)\n\nScript is behaving very strangely. Today's update warped the feed file in a weird way, this doesn't usually happen. I'll test it on my machine to see what's happening. DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 13:56, 10 August 2015 (UTC)\n\nIt was fine for a minute (that must have been your edit), but now it's broke again. --Ericm301 (talk) 19:53, 10 August 2015 (UTC)\n\nAlright, I figured out what was going on with the feed. There was a bit of code I had in the update script that trimmed off the last entry of the RSS file and when I recreated an empty file for the feed after the inexplicable wipe, I forgot to turn it off so it was still shaving off the end of the file. This time it should be working.

(I also snipped everything up until that unique-looking Redirection data, for brevity.)\n\nCompare that with the equivalent snippet from an adjacent page:\n\n\"wgRedirectedFrom\":\"1544\"}); }</script><script>if(window.mw){\n\n...and then continues with a working rest of the page. (Also snipped, but this time both before and after. I've kept it short while imagining I've given enough to ID the precise breakpoint though.)\n\nSame problem encountered when using \"Next\" link from 1544 or \"Previous\" link from 1546. Page http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/List_of_all_comics itself suffers the exact same error. (Last wgVariable listed in LoaC page is \"wgSearchNamespaces\":[0], instead, but still similarly ends after apparently the same close-script and open-script flagging point.)\n\nDoes not go wrong in Mozilla-based browsers also on this machine (Firefox, Seamonkey). Page sources for 1545 look exactly like the above 1544 snippet, as expected, with no obvious funny characters or 'Little Bobby Tables' anomalies, SFAICT. In case it's a spurious downloading error that has ended up being cached, I've also \"shift-refreshed\" in my browser to force download.\n\nUtterly Baffling me, but FYI in case it's something someone needs to know about, although I'm hoping it's just local strangeness and not anything actually of significance.141.101.98.252 04:33, 5 July 2015 (UTC)\n\nOpened in Internet Explorer 11, it seems to appear for me. Are any site features being impacted by this bug? DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 15:44, 5 July 2015 (UTC)\n\nNothing I was previously familiar enough with to spot an adverse effect. Note that http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1545:_Strengths_and_Weaknesses - the link I tried to get from the LoaC page (but only just now tried in non-IE!) works perfectly. Even while the \"/1545\" (i.e. 'RedirectedFrom') version of the page continues to be truncated. I can only assume that (despite attempts to force things anew), it's buggily-cached iteration.\n\nHang on, that gives me an idea. Which works. I changed the 1545 page (change labelled as \"Troubleshooting\" in history) and... it opens perfectly. Removed change (should probably have self-reverted, in hindesight, but suspect it'd be fixed anyway) and no further issue. \"List of all Comics\" page still as broken (because I haven't forced it to update, and am not inclined to 'interfere' with it), but I shall check again after 1547 forces its own changes upon it. Otherwise, consider this closed. Sorry to bother you.\n\nTL;DR; problem solved. Pretty much proven to be not even a site issue, I now think. 141.101.98.252 21:38, 5 July 2015 (UTC)\n\nOk, FYI, once 1547 'Solar System Questions' finally appeared, I check \"List of all comics\" page.

Database returned error \"1114: The table 'objectcache' is full (db423085716.db.1and1.com)\".\n\nNo other page gives me this error, just 881.--162.158.92.6 19:42, 2 August 2015 (UTC)\n\nI just got this on 564 141.101.98.200 22:44, 2 August 2015 (UTC)\n\nDatabase error\n\nI can't see Category:Interactive_comics (1114: The table 'objectcache' is full (db423085716.db.1and1.com)). 199.27.128.105 00:18, 3 August 2015 (UTC)\n\nRSS missing\n\nHey it looks like there's an issue with the rss feed, when you browse to the url on the right it just displays an empty page, not sure what's going on. Eluvatar (talk) 14:19, 3 August 2015 (UTC)\n\nHuh, in the last few hours the rss file was inexplicably wiped. I've restored the base of it, the bot should start populating the feed with new comics, but old ones are gone. DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 16:49, 3 August 2015 (UTC)\n\nExtra Comics\n\nIn extra comics, the header of the comic has \"Expression error: Unrecognised punctuation character \"{\".\" such as in The Rise of Open Access. Forrest (talk)13:32, 13 September 2015 (UTC)\n\nâœ“ Done - It was because 0 was created, so the logic that #ifexist:0 should be false failed. I changed it to default to -2 when number is not present, which will work as long as no one creates -1! Mark Hurd (talk) 11:15, 14 September 2015 (UTC)\n\nExplanations for all -4 comics!\n\nThe main page header now contains this text:\n\nWe have an explanation for all -4 xkcd comics, and only 23 (1%) are incomplete. Help us finish them!\n\nI'm assuming this is a bug. -- Okofish (talk) 01:00, 15 September 2015 (please sign your comments with ~~~~)\n\nâœ“ Done It was a temporary artifact due to recent categorization changes. It's now fixed. Thanks for the quick report :) --Waldir (talk) 01:14, 15 September 2015 (UTC)\n\nDiscussion pane missing on comic 1592?\n\nAfter checking the Discussion tab to make sure there was a Discussion, I thought that someone had removed the {{comic discussion}} tag, and went into full-page edit to put it back. But it's there. Maybe it's just me, maybe it's just temporary, but FYI in case it isn't. 141.101.75.185 15:06, 19 October 2015 (UTC)\n\nFixed. --SlashMe (talk) 16:21, 19 October 2015 (UTC)\n\nCaptcha\n\nCaptcha not appearing at all. Can't edit pages without turning off security settings (which were set to default). Chrome and \"Edge\" on Windows 10. Both yell at me about some components of the page being insecure. 15:48, 18 February 2016 (UTC)\n\nSame issue with other browsers. reCAPTCHA won't load from an \"insecure\" resource when the wiki is accessed over HTTPS. TisTheAlmondTavern 15:07, 6 December 2016 (UTC)\n\nOooh, I see. Alright, I'll get to fixing it now I know what the problem is. DavidyÂ²Â²[talk] 01:00, 7 December 2016 (UTC)\n\nSlight bug in the editing panel, when asked what webcomic we're talking about, it cannot be in all caps, it must be strict lowercase, despite appearances on xkcd.com. Could someone take a look at it? 108.162.249.158 00:54, 5 November 2015 (UTC)\n\nIt took me several months to figure out that \"this wiki\" is named \"explain xkcd\" and not \"explainxkcd\". I spent those months answering two questions every time the \"what's this wiki's name\" question appeared (when I missed the answer, a different question appeared).--Jojonete (talk) 09:06, 5 November 2015 (UTC)\n\nI was sure "
