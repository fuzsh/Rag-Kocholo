        "text": "Back to index of \"this and that in my life\" pages by Donald Sauter.\n\nConversations with me, No. 60a\n\nEmail highlights, ca. December 2006\n\nDedicated to the proposition that every thought that's ever been thunk may be of use or interest to someone . . .\n\nTHEE: unarchy Hey, you *would* make a great president! You've already mastered most of the presidential press conference techniques: a)In response to a question, present an interesting yet unrelated fact that is intended to demonstrate that the questioner is inferior, thus rendering the original question impotent, b) In response to a question, make a rhetorical statement that everyone can agree with thus creating an aura that the original question was answered satisfactorily, and c)state facts in such a way that the mere statement is what makes the fact a fact. However, I'm guessing that you've come up with these techniques on your own because (I'm guessing again) that you have never seen a presidential press conference because - and I'll go out on a limb here - you don't watch TV or maybe don't even own one. If that is the case, then there is something truly fascinating amidst - you disagree with the way 98.9% of the population spends the majority of their free time, yet you unequivocally trust the judgment of 51% of any group of that population to administer justice! That's very interesting -- but more on that later. I hope my new comments below don't warm up your feet *too* much;-) >>unarchy and your presidential ideas seem to be based largely on the vote of the \"bare\" majority. how do minorities fare in this philosophy? >They fare according to the compassion of the majority. Yes, and the way you perform heart surgery is to cut open the chest, fix the heart and then sew the chest back up. Medical school complete. I'll have you know that the \"compassion\" of the majority has decided that torture is now acceptable when interrogating \"suspected\" terrorists - which is the same as saying torture is acceptable for interrogating anyone. I'm sure I'm not telling you anything new as this phenomenon has been widely reported on TV. Errrr, well I'm sure you read the papers or CNN.com. Personally, I would be dismayed if even 0.1% condoned this 2nd most egregious violation of the golden rule. So much for the compassionate majority. >We're all minorities, by the way. Me, first of all, by being male, on on top of that, white. What's that, maybe 35% of the population? Kudos on you adept use of technique \"A\". But just to indulge -- I thus can assume that Unarchy would dictate that a jury in Poughkeepsie would include a proper sampling of folks from Mongolia, Iraq, Zaire, etc., etc. To state what you already know, \"minority\" is a word that, when used in proper context, describes a group of people who have been historically subject to discrimination. Hey, you're not one of those people who say, \"sorry, I only have a tissue\" when someone asks for a Kleenex, are you? >>i'm sure that in certain parts of the country it would be easy to find a majority that would vote that Christianity be taught to all students at a public school. >In tiny pockets - *maybe* I agree - if you consider the mid-west and the south \"tiny\". >If you live there and object, you homeschool, turn to private schools, or move. So we should complicate and cause massive upheaval in what we do 99.99% of the time (i.e., live) to accommodate a new and improved methodology for doing what we do 00.01% of our time (i.e., litigate). I thought the goal was to simplify. Btw, not everybody can afford to homeschool - some folks require a tad more income than can be generated from, say, tutoring a dozen kids a week. >>slightly less plausible would be that a majority of a particular jury would sentence a black man to prison for dating a white woman. >Inconceivable. Factiousness in lieu of acknowledgment - a tried and true technique!! >>why, I dare to say that I could even find a jury where the bare majority would vote to prohibit the playing of classical guitar music in public places. ;-) >I'd probably vote for that myself. I'll send you the ballot. >>regarding your explanation of sentencing: i think all (or at least the bare majority) would agree that if true justice is anything, it is consistent. if we administered perfect justice, punishment (or restitution) would always be the same for a given injustice. >No two crimes in the history of the world have been identical in all the partitculars and circumstances. Well, at least weight would always be identical to mass - except for the rare case when one wants to consider an object somewhere in the universe that doesn't happen to be resting on earth at sea level. (Hey, what's good for the goose is good for the gander!) The point, of course, is that perfect justice is perfectly consistent. So, if I understand correctly, Unarchy will reduce the thousands of existing laws to one, but it will increase the branches of the \"punishment/restitution decision tree\" to infinity. >>In today's system, we've failed miserably. >The understatement of the millenium. Technique \"B\"! Excellent! >>unarchy, with its thousands of juries determing their own \"level\" of justice, would exacerbate the problem to the point where we would have achieved the antithesis of justice. >What evidence do you have showing anyone, much less everyone, wants injustice to prevail? Hey, that's the famous \"Well, don't you support our troops?\" tactic used to quiet the anti-war people! (or is that a \"strategy\"?) Separating the email into sections doesn't obfuscate the main point of the original paragraph - Perfect justice is perfectly consistent. And Unarchy would increase imperfections by 22,393%. It's an interesting exercise to discuss the trees in the Unarchy forest - however, I prefer to consider the forest. I'm reminded of the Miss America candidates in the 60's who, when asked how they would use their reign, they would say (insert sexy breathy voice), \"I would create peace and harmony for all mankind\". The bathing beauties' laudable goal is to their 30 second explanation of how they would achieve that goal as Unarchy's laudable goal is to its proposed implementation. Unarchy, as presented, does not put the cart before the horse - it speaks of the cart as if it were the horse. Before I move on to a more bird's eye view of the forest, I'm going to indulge myself in analyzing one of the trees. Unarchy says that the violated and the violator should represent themselves in court. Well how about those who can't state their case? Like, for example, someone who is dead or a three year old or someone disabled? Perhaps Unarchy would supply those guys with a representative of sorts? That could work I guess, but the representative would have to gather evidence since the representative wasn't there at the time of the violation. But the representative probably wouldn't have the time or expertise to collect evidence, so maybe some state institution should do that. I guess then, the violated might have to hire somebody to look at the evidence if it's too complicated - like trying to understand the massive set of Enron's books. And I guess the evidence probably should be shared with the alleged violator so that he/she can verify that the evidence is not made up. Gee - this horse looks familiar. As an armchair student of human behavior what I find most fascinating is the view of the forest from space. Reading in between the lines of your musings, opinions and suggestions, I would assert that you have no faith in the common sense of anybody (excluding yourself). The world's scientists don't have the common sense to realize that their basic tool for communicating with one another, units, should be normalized. Educators don't have the common sense to realize that any attempt at educating should utilize one-on-one tutoring as the staple of any educational endeavor. I'm sure that the vast majority of all classical guitarists are wrong about something or other. The people who use calendars don't know that they are living in misery. Why, even vegetable eaters don't have the common sense to eat mixed vegetables the right way. And let's not forget about 98.9% TV watchers that are using their spare time incorrectly. \"They\" are always wrong. There must be a conspiracy among all dairies because it would be inconceiveable that your taste buds that have been assigned to tasting butter are declining in sensitivity. So what I find quite interesting is the paradox that, for your \"flagship idea\", you would choose as a foundation the common sense of the common man. I can only surmise that the only thing that would keep you from disagreeing with 98.9% of all of the \"common sense\" decisions made by the thousands of Unarchy juries would be the simple fact that Unarchy; i.e., your idea, is being used. Don't take any of this personally; it's just that I love these puzzles. And I know the answer to the paradox!! Here it is: The obsession with keeping *all* aspects of life simple is so strong that it has conquered reason. That is, the at-all-costs need to devise a simple solution to man's greatest challenge has trumped common sense - and yet the system itself depends solely on common sense!! Fascinating!! I suppose an obsession with making any aspect of life simple/optimal is manageable as long as arms can be wrapped that particular aspect of life (e.g., the simplest and best brownie recipe). But when absolute obsession with fixing even the most gargantuan of man's problems comes face-to-face with complexity of the problems, something has got to give. Two choices here: either acceptance or reality must bend. My guess is that reality is losing. Now, I've already overstepped, so I might as well go all the way. Consider this: Bent reality is delusion. Delusion mixed with grandiose aspirations is Megalomania. Megalomaniacs operate on absolute certainty. Absolute certainty has always been and always will be the primary cause of all human-on-human violence. That is to say, absolute certainty is in direct conflict with the golden rule. Btw, making the footbath too cold hurts the circulation. THEE: Winter buffet Whatever you hear about the Oklahoma weather today . . . it's true. At any given moment today, I counted at least a dozen cardinals, chickadees, and some sort of fat little grey and black birds with white bellies . . .all vying for the goodies. Somebody sure did a great job building the feeder conveniently hung from a plant hook on the patio where the birdies can enjoyed from the kitchen window and diningroom door. THEE: Any idea how the land of Nod got from its spot east of Eden in Genesis to dreamland? ME: >Any idea how the land of Nod got from its spot east of Eden in Genesis to dreamland? Trade hazard, I 'spect, when you go around naming your burgs with three- letter common nouns. Now how did Baltimore float over from the tip of Eire . . . >River risin', OK, but what the heck is a river raisin? Dunno. Raisins are good for you. >The author changed every bit as much as, perhaps more than, the Kiowa although she had her impact. That sounds like a blurb on the back of Jenny's book. \"It is the story about the challenges, heartbreaks, lessons, and joys of a woman participating in the transformation of the city while being transformed herself.\" I know what the writer means, although I'm guessing Jenny is basically the same person I met 26 years ago, but who has seen and gone through a *lot*. I'm enjoying the book, but I think the main audience would be people who know Baltimore, and people who are considering urban ministries anywhere. >The Man that Corrupted Hadleyburg is excellent. It was used for an episode in the American Short Story series years ago on PBS. Herman Munster played The Man. (Well, make that Fred Gwynne.) I haven't seen it for years, but I remember some catchy music as the townspeople started receiving letters. Funny you should mention music in relation to the story. First thing I did when I went online before checking that batch of emails was search for the Gilbert & Sullivan lyric from the Mikado, \"When a man's afraid, a beautiful maid - \". That's the tune the crowd fitted their impromptu song to - \"Hooray! hooray! a symbolical day!/And don't you this forget/Corruptibles far from Hadleburg are/ But the symbols are here, you bet!\" Twain is great, no two ways about it, and this story is another tour de force, but, to be honest, he's already worn me down with the satisfaction and glee he derives from human shortcomings. Come on, Sam, I think we all know how imperfect we are and have been. In the last book of short stories of his I read, I had to give up half way through a relentlessly painful one, after suffering through one or two others. And I never give up on something, figuring that I've invested so much in it, and it may all pull together in the end. There have been a few instances in my life where I'm screaming to myself the whole time, \"What am I reading this miserable/boring/crummy thing for?\", but the last paragraph or sentence justifies it all, and I lean back and think, \"Wow, . . . wow.\" Still, I wish a had a doppelga\"nger to lay out my reading, listening and watching agendas. Hey, do you know what makes people tick? Been having a round of emails with a Tamara L- who bristles at every last word she finds on my web site. Heaven help us if she finds my paean to the cool whip bowl. ME: seedy talk All's right with the world. Those 2 skips in Lester Lanin ate away at me bad enough that I went and redid those 2 tracks, recording fresh from the vinyl. It was about an hour's worth of work restoring those 4 seconds of music. Another hurdle was overcome today when I downloaded a program called SnagIt to capture text from Windows windows. This was my hold up in burning cds of ucsb opera mp3s. Now I have a searchable text file to tell me where to find the songs on the mp3 disc. The first disc has 200 tracks, and I need just a few more to make up a second 200-track disk. Here's what the accompanying info for the first 10 tracks looks like. UCSB Opera 1 1 ucsb0046 La Gioconda. Cielo e mar Florencio Constantino 1911 2 ucsb0047 Forza del destino. O tu che in seno agli angeli Carlo Albani 1911 3 ucsb0069 Good-bye everybody Helen Clark and Joseph A. Phillips 1915 4 ucsb0088 Favorite airs from The Prince of Pilsen Edison Light Opera Company 1914 5 ucsb0089 Ballet music from William Tell [Guillaume Tell. Selections] (take 1) Edison Concert Band 1914 6 ucsb0114 Where's the girl for me: The lady in red James F. Harrison 1915 7 ucsb0137 Favorite airs [Ernani. Selections] Edison Light Opera Company 1914 8 ucsb0152 Hear me, Norma [Norma. Mira, o Norma] Julius Spindler and Anthony Giammatteo 1915 9 ucsb0227 Dost thou know that sweet land [Mignon. Connais-tu le pays?] (take 1) Marie Morrisey 1914 10 ucsb0228 Dost thou know that sweet land [Mignon. Connais-tu le pays?] (take 2) Marie Morrisey 1914 Again, that's all captured details - Title, Artist, Year - from a Windows folder display of the mp3 files. My own opera database includes the composer for every item, but I suppose I can live without it for the cylinders. [No, I broke down and put composers in.] ME: to: James McConnahy program hung up; now ALL text on computer is raggedy I downloaded CaptureText yesterday December 2, 2006. I experimented with it and determined \"Select window with scrolling\" was the selection mode I needed. I eventually brought it under my control and managed to capture file details shown in a Windows folder. I continued my work today, but the program hung up on one of my attempts. I forget now exactly which point it hung up on; clicking somewhere within the window, or at \"copy plain text\". A nasty-looking error message window came up, filling up the middle third of my screen. I didn't have the foresight to copy anything down. I could move the cursor around - it stayed an hourglass - but it wouldn't activate anything. I figured I would use my one-and-only technique on a completely frozen computer - power off and power back up. After I did that, things seem to work ok, except that ALL text, in ALL windows, on ANY sort of screen (desktop, word processor, browser...) has the ragged, dot-matrix-y look that CaptureText uses to indicate it's ready to capture text. How do I get all the normal fonts back, or deactivate whatever CaptureText is doing to all the text? I haven't uninstalled the program, thinking it may be needed in the fix. Thanks for your help. THEE: Re: nothin' world-changing again, dang >>River risin', OK, but what the heck is a river raisin? >Dunno. Raisins are good for you. As long as one doesn't put them in brownies. River raisins sound a little to much like something left behind by the catfish, but it IS a dynamite CD. Too bad that Sedalia would never pay to bring in an orchestra of this size. >>The Man that Corrupted Hadleyburg is excellent. It was used for an episode in the American Short Story series years ago on PBS. Herman Munster played The Man. (Well, make that Fred Gwynne.)

That's the tune the crowd fitted their impromptu song to - \"Hooray! hooray! a symbolical day!/And don't you this forget/Corruptibles far from Hadleburg are/ But the symbols are here, you bet!\" Cool! Guess I never would have picked up on that. >Twain is great, no two ways about it, and this story is another tour de force, but, to be honest, he's already worn me down with the satisfaction and glee he derives from human shortcomings. Come on, Sam, I think we all know how imperfect we are and have been. If we only had happy, uplifting stories, I suspect we'd get tired of them, too. We'd be saying, \"What's wrong with these folks? Don't they know anything about real life?\" I tried a little experiment with Twain last week by assigning his \"War Prayer,\" which appears as a supplemental reading in the back of my Reading II textbook. I asked my students to do a little writing: \"What are the townspeople's feelings about war? What are the minister's? What are the aged stranger's? Which side do you think Twain agrees with? How does Twain's 'War Prayer' relate to current world situations?\" Those weren't the exact words, but that's the general idea. About 90% of my students said that Twain sided with the patriotic, celebrating townspeople and the minister. Why else would he have the people call the aged stranger a lunatic? And in the world today, towns are still cheering on their soldiers and praying for them in church.\" Now, I ask you, how can anyone fault that preacher's invocation: \"God the all-terrible! Thou who ordainest, Thunder thy clarion and lightning thy sword!\" Or his kindly prayer entreating God to make the soldiers \"invincible in the bloody onset\" and to \"help them crush the foe.\" With all their cynicism about the government and the media, why can't these kids see Twain's point? When the aged white-haired, robed stranger, who says he has come with a message from God, recites the \"unspoken\" side of their prayer, the Twain's townspeople and my students don't get it: \"O Lord our God, help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreds with our shells; help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of their patriot dead; help us to drown the thunder of their guns with the shrieks of their wounded, writhing in pain; help us to lay waste their humble homes with a hurricane of fire; help us to turn them out roofless with their little children to wander unfriended that wastes of their desolated land in rags and hunger and thirst, sports of the sun flames of summer and the icy winds of winter, broken in spirit, worn with travail, imploring Thee for the refuge of the grave and denied it--for our sakes who adore Thee, Lord, blast their hopes, blight their lives, protract their bitter pilgrimage, make heavy their steps, water their way with our tears, stain the white show with the blood of their wounded feet! We ask it, in the spirit of love, or Him Who is the Source of Love, and Who is the ever-faithful refuge and friend of all that are sore beset and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts. Amen.\" And we had just finished studying irony. Perhaps I should shut up and be happy with the 10% who understood. ME: squawkers >>Funny you should mention music in relation to the story. First thing I did when I went online before checking that batch of emails was search for the Gilbert & Sullivan lyric from the Mikado, \"When a man's afraid, a beautiful maid - \". That's the tune the crowd fitted their impromptu song to - \"Hooray! hooray! a symbolical day!/And don't you this forget/Corruptibles far from Hadleburg are/ But the symbols are here, you bet!\" >Cool! Guess I never would have picked up on that. Whoa! Hold on! I take *zero* credit. Twain spelled it out, just like the parody songs \"To the tune of...\" in the old Mad magazines. He wrote: [The Chair:] \"'Nicholas Whitworth'\" \"Hooray! hooray! it's a symbolical day!\" Somebody wailed in, and began to sing this rhyme (leaving out \"it's\") to the lovely \"Mikado\" tune of \"When a man's afraid, a beautiful maid--\"; the audience joined in, with joy; then, just in time, somebody contributed another line-- I didn't even recognize the lyric, which doesn't appear in the index of songs because it's internal to No. 18, \"The criminal cried as he dropped him down\" (the snickersnee song). >If we only had happy, uplifting stories, I suspect we'd get tired of them, too. We'd be saying, \"What's wrong with these folks? Don't they know anything about real life?\" Don't get me wrong, I'm sure not saying \"Ban all unhappy stories, and particularly those mean Mark Twain ones!\" I was mostly confessing something about myself. (But note I didn't actually name the story I gave up on - you might look it up!) Also, I claim there's limitless territory for non-\"happy, uplifting\" stories besides this particular type of Twain's, where he mocks any- and everyone who envision a better world and try to do something to move it in that direction. I guess it's because he's so good at it and he's such a master story-teller that I come away battered and bruised. To be honest, any story where the bad guy with no redeeming values \"gets away with it\" leaves me feeling kind of rotten. Guess it's my thing about justice. You would know better than I, but I think such stories represent a miniscule fraction of all that are written. After all, what can a writer say in such a story, except, \"Hey, chumps, it's hopeless! Might as well go kill yourselfs!\" Who needs to pay $2 (or whatever) for a box of books to be told that? >About 90% of my students said that Twain sided with the patriotic, celebrating townspeople and the minister. Wow! I would think that the fact that he went to the trouble to create that unique character, the stranger, would tip even a casual reader off that the author was using him to say something. (I just had a big jolt of deja vu; have discussed this before?) What would be the point of creating a lunatic to say something lunatic, just to get shot down? >>Heaven help us if she finds my paean to the cool whip bowl. >Why can't I find that one? Guess cuz you nor nobody needs to. The cool whip bowl? Good grief... >Btw, the Caesar Rodney link doesn't work. Thanks for pointing that out. Theoretically, that's impossible, since I just copied the same text and link down from the \"What's new\" section. Somehow a space got in. I fixed it up. >Forgot to ask until too late: What was Ms Landham bristling about? My ideas on justice set her off. Then she pulled something out of every web page she could get her hands on - education, guitar, units, the calendar, butter, etc - as more ammo against me, although I could hardly ever catch the point. To be honest, I'm borderline thrilled that anyone is inclined to dig in and respond. By the way, among the loose ends I can never wrap up, here's a link that provides almost half of the chicken lady's album: http://cdbaby.com/cd/orriel Your challenge is to listen all the way through without laughing. Then compare her Queen of the Night with another amazing one (if I haven't already sent you here before): http://cylinders.library.ucsb.edu/search.php?queryType=@attr%201=1016%20&query=galvany&num=1&start=1&sortBy=&sortOrder=id THEE: Cylinders rule! I believe we need to launch the Beatles-Cash-In Digitization Project. At last, the Manchesters, et al, will get their due. ME: > I believe we need to launch the Beatles-Cash-In Digitization Project. At last, the Manchesters, et al, will get their due. *Way* too mainstream. I had \"Dance and Sing Mother Goose with a Beatle Beat\", featuring Wynken, Blinken, and Nod and The Golden Rock-A- Twisters, more in mind. I went to the library today to snag enough opera mp3s to fill out my second cd. Getting the mp3 files and their information all lined up was no easier the second time around. Windows was telling me there were 200 mp3 files in the folder when there were really only 195. What a confused mess. And *then* the text capturing program hung up and left *all* the text on my computer raggedy looking! I sure hope their support department knows what to do. For the time being do NOT download and install CaptureText, as if you were inclined. (Yesterday I was calling it SnagIt.) THEE: follow up Wow, I was re-reading some of the emails that i sent out last week ago and, to the casual observer, I see that the last one I sent you could have been labeled caustic, pretentious and dripping with sarcasm. I guess Internet communication has some of the same issues as anonymous- driver to anonymous-driver communication - tact and protocol are victims. Also, my last email belies the fact that many of the things you'd like to improve, I'd like to as well. At any rate, I apologize for my uncouth behaviour. ME: Hi Bev and Kevin, It's still a gaping gap in my life that I don't have a copy of the various WGS ensemble recordings. Any chance you can find time to dig through old discs and dats and send me copies on cd (not mp3)? No need to do any editing or programming; I can put it all together. Besides being a memento of more than 10 years of my life, I know the final product will sound great. It's important enough to me that I'd willingly pay for your time and effort, but I'm guessing that wouldn't make anybody particularly happy. The ones that I already have, and DON'T need are: Tango estampie Summerset follies, Phyllis conducting. Trip to Rocky Point The ones that I NEED, that I can think of, are: Summerset Follies (Kevin leading) The Old Castle (Kevin's recording) Brouwer quartet (recorded same day; first section may be salvageable.) Floating Ancillary Ants (I can stitch together the sections) 4 Praetorius pieces (Bob leading) Little Irish pieces (Bob leading) Looking over that list, I see I was the one who prepared the music (cut and paste, numbered measures, copied parts, etc.) in every case except the Irish pieces. I feel like there may have been more, so don't stop there if there are any I've forgotten. ME: Dear Google, A few weeks ago you received a few frantic messages from me based on some idea that my Kumon page was plummeting in your ratings based on nefarious activity by people who wanted to keep it down. Since then, I've read up on \"search engine optimization\" and have found, to my great shock and disappointment, that page visits have nothing to do with your ratings. You know better than me that it's all based on links and keyword positioning within the page, the urls, and the anchor text. I've been on the web 8 or 9 years and have pages of valuable content on a variety of topics, so this revelation is more than somewhat devastating to me. Besides not being inclined to humiliate myself going around begging people to link to me, I am facing months of miserable work making my pages and filenames \"google friendly\"; for instance, rewriting titles and headers from what I want to what Google wants. And with no assurance of any actual benefit for all that work. And at immeasurable sacrifice to the blessedly simple way I have always done things. For instance, I could have lived forever with good old, simple, 4- and 5-letter filenames, laughing up my sleeve at the ridiculously complicated way modern computer people do things. But now you've yanked me kicking and screaming into the massively-long-file-name world. Do the Pulitzer Prize people tell authors how to write and format their books? I read that Google has an underlying principal, \"Do no evil\", and I know you're all good guys, and I discovered and touted you within the first few months of your existence, but dictating how web pages should be presented has to rank up there with the great non-violent crimes against humanity. I implore you to keep brainstorming about ways in which actual page usefulness, as evidenced by popularity, as evidenced by traffic and/or votes, could be worked into the mix, or perhaps yield an alternate rating system. I want my pages to stand or fall in fair and square shootouts. The argument against traffic is that people would cheat, but they cheat using bogus links. I'll bet you could find a way to weed out cheaters. Perhaps there could be an \"exact keyword\" tag for each page, and on Google's search results page could be a link to pages with the exact keywords the user typed, and those pages ranked by popularity as evidenced by traffic or vote. To make stuffing the ballot box harder, perhaps only negative votes would be tallied so a page owner would be faced with voting *against* a thousand other pages, and that with negligible benefit to himself. No doubt everybody and his brother thinks his own pages are the greatest, but I know it's not my imagination how worthless those 100 or so pages between my Kumon page and the top are (one of the top 10 had nothing but an outdated Kumon logo - not even captioned!); or all the Scrabble pages above mine (which I've never been able to dig down deep enough to); etc., etc. At least could you give us a \"non-commercial\" search mode so a person looking for ideas or information have a fighting chance? This may come as a shock, but not every web searcher is looking to buy a video or take a trip. Please, keep brainstorming. Thanks! ME: My cousin wrote an interesting book called \"A Thousand Resurrections - an urban spiritual journey\". I just put in an order for one for you. There's some powerful stuff in there, although I predict you'll find yourself saying, \"I couda tol' you that!\" after every sentence. I hope that makes it a *more* enjoyable read. One of the nice things that happened recently was getting a note from a singer in California who needed a copy of a record in my collection called Aria senza Voce - orchestral backings for 9 lyric soprano arias. In appreciation, she sent me her recent recording, which had me laughing all the way through. You can sample almost half of it here: http://cdbaby.com/cd/orriel Her main site is: http://www.orrielsmith.com Then compare her Queen of the Night with another amazing one on the UCSB cylinder site I mentioned: http://cylinders.library.ucsb.edu/search.php?queryType=@attr%201=1016%20&query=galvany&num=1&start=1&sortBy=&sortOrder=id Also plug \"chicken little\" into the search box. Also \"guido gialdini\" to hear his whistling Musetta's Waltz from La Boheme. Also, Conrad's Orchestra playing Cho-cho-san - a rocking \"Un bel di\". Well, you don't need me to tell you what to listen to. The problem is finding the time to listen to a fraction of the neat things on the site. (On the other hand, somebody might hate everything.) Almost forgot to finish up the chicken lady's story. I had sent her a cd of our guitar trio to even up the balance of trade. Not only was she and a friend very impressed, but she mentioned she's been struggling with the guitar for 40 years, for instance with Recuerdos. Her solution - bag the struggle, sing it! So she also sent me a cd called \"Ghosts of the Alhambra\", with her singing that and good old \"Romanza\" in a nicely spooky way. That arrived the day before Halloween, so I got some good use out of it Halloween night. Going back a ways, I had a nice day at the Maryland Renaissance at the end of August. I borrowed my little friend Mizan. I've probably been to about 10 of the festivals since it started around 1976. It's always a blast, even if you have the feeling it was only yesterday you saw the same act. It was Mizan's first, and she accounted for the highlights this time around. We had seen tons of amazing magic and sword swallowing and feats of derring-do, and when we came to a stage with a group of madrigal singers I thought I would have to use a little coaxing to stop for a few songs. But Mizan herself said, \"Let's go in.\" Fine with me! Now madrigal singers don't draw the same crowds as the crazy guys, so there were *lots* of free spots on the benches. And it's sort of like church, where nobody wants to sit way up front. But Mizan walked right down to the front and plunked herself down a little left of center. Well, a foot and a half from the stage was a little close for me, so I took the second row, center. The singers were in the middle of a song, and it was obvious they got a kick out of a little kid making herself right at home like that. I know it had to make their day, with Mizan swaying and clapping along to all their songs. They ended up by getting some kids and grown-up kids (e.g. me) from the audience for their last piece. We kept circling around and through an arch made by two of the singers, and whoever was the last to pass through got caught, and his head \"chopped off\" (imaginarily). That's how Mizan got her head chopped off. And then they gave her a Renaissance Reveler's cassette, figuring, I guess, that nobody buys cassettes anymore. (I've already turned it into a cd.) And I had a pen in my pocket so I suggested that Mizan get a few autographs on the cassette card. Of course, they were quite delighted by that, too. Anyhow, the point is, I know how much musicians like to feel they were appreciated, and I'm sure Mizan made their day. Along those same, lines, we stopped by a guitar/fiddle duo playing Irish music, and Mizan tried some Irish jigging, at least it looked quite authentic to me. The musicians got a kick out of that. And at another consort we stopped to hear, the harper invited Mizan to have a few zings on his instrument. So see, you should call me to say, \"I will call in 24 hours. Please have your stories ready.\" THEE: Re: squawkers >Whoa! Hold on! I take *zero* credit. Twain spelled it out, just like the parody songs \"To the tune of...\" in the old Mad magazines. He wrote: > [The Chair:] \"'Nicholas Whitworth'\" > \"Hooray! hooray! it's a symbolical day!\" > Somebody wailed in, and began to sing this rhyme (leaving out \"it's\") > to the lovely \"Mikado\" tune of \"When a man's afraid, a beautiful > maid--\"; the audience joined in, with joy; then, just in time, > somebody contributed another line-- Good. Then you have proof that I do forget. I must have read right past several times without it registering. However, I haven't read that story for quite a few years. Worse yet, I fell asleep last weekend watching the Mikado. Gosh, darn, it seemed to go on for hours and I'd started after 11:00 p.m. >To be honest, any story where the bad guy with no redeeming values \"gets away with it\" leaves me feeling kind of rotten. Guess it's my thing about justice. You would know better than I, but I think such stories represent a miniscule fraction of all that are written. After all, what can a writer say in such a story, except, \"Hey, chumps, it's hopeless! Might as well go kill yourselfs!\" Who needs to pay $2 (or whatever) for a box of books to be told that? Hard to say. There's a whole lot of depressing literature out there. But I understand what you're saying about the Twain pieces that mock those trying to do good. Were most of these late in life, do you recall. For a man who started out with some fun stuff, he ended up having more than his share of tragedies in life. >>>Heaven help us if she finds my paean to the cool whip bowl. >>Why can't I find that one? >Guess cuz you nor nobody needs to. The cool whip bowl? Good grief... It would fit right in there with cereal, mixed veggies, raisin brownies, and ice water. >>Forgot to ask until too late: What was Ms L- bristling about? >My ideas on justice set her off. Then she pulled something out of every web page she could get her hands on - education, guitar, units, the calendar, butter, etc - as more ammo against me, although I could hardly ever catch the point. To be honest, I'm borderline thrilled that anyone is inclined to dig in and respond. Sure this wasn't someone having some fun with you? Why would anyone go out of her (or his) way to attack a complete stranger's ideas on a website? Strange person. >By the way, among the loose ends I can never wrap up, here's a link that provides almost half of the chicken lady's album: > http://cdbaby.com/cd/orriel >Your challenge is to listen all the way through without laughing. I made it! Admittedly, I had my hand clasped tightly over my mouth after the first few seconds. You're almost certainly familar with the Swingel Singers. They're the only performers who even come close, and they don't cluck. When I was a teenager in Denmark, my host family and I watched them perform on TV one night. Thereafter, my host mom went about her business in the house giving a great imitation of what we'd heard. She was a natural. To this day, I can't help laughing when I listen to them. >Then compare her Queen of the Night with another amazing one (if I haven't already sent you here before): If you did, I didn't get there. I enjoyed listening this time and listened to Orriel a second time as a follow-up. THEE: Re: seedy talk I love computers! They always know how to disappoint. THEE: Is this a valid word in Scrabble? Is REFUSION a valid word? I couldn't find it in OSPD4. ME: You would know better than I. I use a collegiate dictionary for scrabble, and it's not in there. I see the web supplies a few definitions for it. ME: B>You're more than welcome. The book was power-packed. Of course, I'm always awed by anyone who can write a book - I struggle over a paragraph (and I'm never happy with the paragraph!) The scrabble game was a classic. I was going to plunk my last S T R E A onto the K at the top for a triple word score - but YOU took it, and not only that, but for 45 points! I was rooting for C-, but it's not in me to not scramble as hard as possible. In a very low-level coincidence, the opera I was recommending to C-, Amahl and the Night Visitors, came to mind more than a few times reading your book. Amahl's a crippled boy who lives with his mother in a hut. The Magi stop there on their journey. The Mother: \"Oh, these beautiful things, and all that gold!\" Melchior: These are the gifts to the child. The Mother (with great excitement): The child? Which child? Melchior: We don't know. But the Star will guide us to him. The Mother: But perhaps I know him. What does he look like? . . . Kaspar, Melchior, and Balthazar: The Child we seek holds the sees and the winds on His palm. The Child we seek has the moon and the stars at his feet. The Mother (absorbed in her own thoughts): The child I know on his palm holds my heart. The child I know at his feet has my life. He's my child, my son, My darling, my own, and his name is Amahl! THEE: Good news is that I gave away my laptop to serve as a house computer at my folks house -- partly because they needed it more (we have 2 desktops) & partly because I've been spending too much time surfing the web & not enough playing music.

ME: Hi Bev, Thanks for prodding me to take stock of exactly what trios I do and don't have. Counting both tapes and cds, it turns out I have most everything. It took some hair-pulling, and I'd be surprised if I got this 100% right, but this should be pretty close. c = I have complete recording on cd. t = I have the complete recording on tape, but not cd. x = I do not have complete recording on tape or cd. c 3 Renaissance Pieces (Ballo, When Daphne, Rondo/Tripla) t Ambrosius - Fugato c Ambrosius - Suite in G major c Bach - Presto, Fugue, Trio c Barker - Plunkety Plunk Schottische c Blanchard - Prolog & rondo c Boudounis - Tsitifelli t Bowers - Earl of Salisbury Pavane variations t Buchholz - Strelitzia t Cardoso - Trios # 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 (I have two of these on cd.) t Chiereghan - Toccata del cucu. (I have all but first part, Calmo, on cd.) c? Chobanian. Missing Yeraz and Alakiaz, but maybe we didn't record them? t David - Drei Canzonen c Farkas - Csango Sonatina x Gagnon - Alice. (I have parts I, IV, and an extract from part III.) c Gagnon - Kaleidoscope t Goldstein - A little music t Horn - Sporades suite c Houghton - 6 mvmts. c JC Smith - Pavan of the Midnight Stars c Kleynjans - Suite Baroque c Kruisbrink - For all I care c Morricone - Canone breve c Mozart - Fantasia K. 475 c Paulsen-Bahnsen - Preludio y fuga Antiguo c Pilsl - Klangbilder c Pujol - Fin de siglo x Pujol - Tangondo. I *think* we recorded this. Did we? c Purcell - King Arthur t Rak - Four moods t Rogaliov - Times of the Miraculous. (Have 4 of 6 mvmts on cd.) c Santorsola - Concertino c Stuckle - Friendship March c Szordikowski - Irish Dreams c Vivaldi - mando cto t Volle - Trio Does that list agree with your records of what we recorded? Here are most of the other trios we played, but I'm pretty sure we didn't record. But I might be wrong here or there. Almeida - Discantus Almeida - Brazilliance Bellinati - Baiao de gude Chiereghin - Canzone, Lunare e Danza Rituale Koshkin - Let's play together Stingl - Spielmusik in C (3 mvmt) Ulrich - einersaits Vivaldi - Sonate in A Vivaldi - Sonate in E ??? - God rest ye merry I hadn't seriously considered anyone going to the trouble to revisit the recordings to pick out the very best takes, or doing any editing work. That would involve *so* much time and effort. But I was talking to B-, and he sounded quite willing - enthusiastic, even - to do just that. I think it would be great to pursue that. It's easy for me to say, since you two would be doing all the work, but it would wrap up our trio efforts very nicely. No need to drop everything right now, but does it sound like a possibility, copying all the complete takes to cd for Bob? As far as the wgs ensemble pieces, it looks like between what I have and what you put on the web, that's about it for what you have. I thought there may have been 4 (or more?) Pil O'Pals, and I think there are only 3 on the web. Some time ago I did some comparative listenings between wav and mp3 files, and I was absolutely amazed at how indistinguishable they were to my ears. So I'm perfectly comfortable with mp3 whenever I want more on a disc than cd audio format will allow. But I have a *little* reluctance to go from wav to mp3 back to wav. It seems wrong, even if I still couldn't tell a difference. Thanks for trying to help with my Sony cd recorder problem. I never got to the bottom of it. Now I just operate in a work-around mode - never erasing a track and re-recording, and almost always going to computer to create the final product. What I had wanted to do was get it right on the cd-rw and do a quick and easy disc-to-disc copy with no diddling at all on the computer. But since I use declicking on most of my records, often convert to mp3 to get a whole opera or multi-record or multi-tape set on one cd, and like to get track breaks just right, I'm resigned now to processing on the computer, like everybody else. By the way, did you know B- broke his leg pretty badly a few weeks ago? C- called a few days ago. She mentioned that her car was stolen, and then found 2 weeks later pretty beat up. ME: Got slightly burned on my last mp3 project. It used about 675 of the 700 MB, so I was a little concerned about the tracks at the end. The last 17 were missing. Hmmm, instead of completing the story, I'll turn it into a quiz. What do you think happened to the last 17 tracks? If you want some opera cylinder recommendations, you may try: 0921 - whistling Musetta's waltz (La Boheme) 2803 - buzzing intermezzo from Cavalleria Rusticana 2426 - whistling Anvil chorus from Il Trovatore 1243 - cranking Un bel di from Madama Butterfly 4553 - listen to end for technical difficulties ME: RE: Doing Math the Easy Way Regarding: \"Kumon covers everything from basic algebra all the way up to differential calculus,\" Kumon actually starts with the most fundamental counting skills. It also puts calculus in the middle of its curriculum, with subjects like probability and trigonometry coming later. I'm sure only a small fraction of Kumon students actually progress beyond the arithmetic levels into algebra, so unpleasant - and difficult - is the drilling. As far as I know, there have been no independent studies showing any measurable benefit of Kumon. I was a Kumon instructor for 2 years. For a complete dump of my thoughts, search for my Kumon page using my name and \"kumon\". THEE: Yes, it is hard not to Scrabble for all you've got! Here's a dark family secret: I play my mom and sister once a year or so on vacation, and I play as hard as I can, but I drop digits when I add my score so that my mom will win sometimes. But I wouldn't dream of not playing that triple-word-score word! Thanks for the quote from Amahl and the Night Visitors. I've only seen it once, years ago. What a beautiful passage. I may use that quote in a talk I give at a banquet in a few weeks. ME: If you're inclined to make use of that scene in Amahl, let me fill it out for you. The libretto's not on the web, that I can find, and that's fair enough since it's still protected. The Mother: \"Oh, these beautiful things, and all that gold!\" Melchior: These are the gifts to the child. The Mother (with great excitement); The child? Which child? Melchior: We don't know. But the Star will guide us to him. The Mother: But perhaps I know him. What does he look like? Melchior: Have you seen a Child the color of wheat, the color of dawn? His eyes are mild, His hands are those of a King, as King He was born. Incense, myrrh and gold we bring to His side, and the Eastern Star is our guide. The Mother (as though to herself): Yes, I know a child the color of wheat, the color of dawn. His eyes are mild, his hands are those of a King, as King he was born. But no one will bring him incense or gold, though sick and poor and hungry and cold. He's my child, my son, my darling, my own. Melchior and Balthazar: Have you seen a Child the color of earth, the color of thorn? His eyes are sad, His hands are those of the poor, as poor He was born. Incense, myrrh and gold we bring to His side, and the Eastern Star is our guide. The Mother: Yes, I know a child the color of earth, the color of thorn. His eyes are sad, His hands are those of the poor, as poor he was born. But no one will bring him incense or gold, though sick and poor and hungry and cold. He's my child, my son, my darling, my own. Kaspar, Melchior, and Balthazar: The Child we seek holds the seas and the winds on His palm. Kaspar: The Child we seek has the moon and the stars at his feet. Balthazar: Before him the eagle is gentle, the lion is meek. Kaspar, Melchior, and Balthazar: The Mother Choirs of angels hover over His roof (absorbed in her own thoughts): and sing him to sleep. The child I know He's warmed by breath, on his palm holds my heart. He's fed by Mother The child I know who is both Virgin and Queen. at his feet has my life. Incense, myrrh and gold He's my child, my son, we bring to His side, My darling, my own, and the Eastern Star is our guide. and his name is Amahl! So, see, you wouldn't be able to make out the mother's last verse without the libretto in front of you. That's opera! There was a wonderful production in Smyrna, the town just north of Dover, last year, and they indicated they were hoping to make it a tradition. I hope so, too. I have recordings by two of the tv casts, from the early 1950s and early 1960s. I found a nice, short article on the web that references that scene by a woman who played the mother, with her own son as Amahl. http://www.stlukesbethesda.org/2005%20anniversary%20-%2080.pdf It's about halfway down. THEE: Turn left at Greenland So close to that bookstore! Man! I was in that neighborhood last Monday, running an errand at the store where M~ got our replacement printer. It was a quickee. I had no fun. I finished the raking today. It's party time. I dunno what happened to those 17 tracks. Do tell! I will take those recommended cylinders under advisement. I will get to them eventually, oh yes! ME: > I dunno what happened to those 17 tracks. Do tell! Hint: RCD-W500C Operating instructions, page 10, col. 2, note 4. Went to Baltimore County on Sunday for dinner with the family. My brother had a great ebay story. He got a Don Swann (I think) lithograph from an aunt to put up on ebay. He checked out the activity on ebay to get an idea for a starting price, and lo and behold, one of the lithographs had the exact same number - 235/300! He even emailed the seller to have her double check, and she's sure it's right. A scan of the serial number is even shown on the ebay ad. Shades of those old \"limited edition\" Beatle bootlegs, where the joke was thay could throw a convention for owners of 37/200? He also mentioned a set of children's books called \"My Bookhouse\" that he's selling for the same aunt. I threw him for a loop when I said, I just bought a set at Dover's auction a couple of months ago. He's kicking himself for selling the first volume separately for $50, and finding out there's little or no interest in the other five volumes individually. He says complete sets have sold upwards of $100 on ebay. Of course, I didn't buy my set to pass on. There was a woman there that day who really wanted them and took me up to my max, $20. If she had made another bid, they would have been hers. If she weren't there, I probably would have got the set for $4 or $5. THEE: Re: Turn left at Greenland That's a great eBay story. Did you know my friend Mark won fifth-row Who tickets for their Columbus, Ohio, show yesterday on eBay, and one of those tickets was mine! Man, am I tired from the drive! No I'm not. The eBay seller decided, after M~~ sent money, that she'd rather go herself and just didn't bother sending M~~ the tickets. He got his money back but we're still mad. Fortunately, Roger Daltrey apparently has bronchitis. The show got a terrible review. Do you mean I have to dig out my operator's manual for the CD player? That's asking a lot! ME: ccc > Do you mean I have to dig out my operator's manual for the CD player? That's asking a lot! Man, kids today! Need to be spoonfed everything! All right, I'll kick all the stuffins out of the \"Oh, wow!\" experience. The sony cd recorder has a maximum of 300 mp3 files and folders on a single disc. I can play the last 17 tracks on my computer; I can play them in my car (I'm pretty certain); but I can't get at them on the sony. Why 300? Sounds pretty piddly to me, and is not even a computer-type number (2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 . . .). I guess they sized it for the average '50's pop song: 700 min. per disc / 300 songs = 2:20 per song. Is it possible that anyone has not figured out by now, that even in the best pop song, there's only 45-52 seconds that you really need? Never mind people out there archiving 20 second answering machine messages? Sheesh. My second D~~ Chronology disk, just 7 tapes this time, only ran over by 5 tracks. My joy at seeing the number of mp3s come in at 296 was short- lived - you have to add the folders in, too. Sorry about the Who disappointment, although it takes all the empathetic power I can muster not to see it as an act of mercy on the part of the ebay seller. Had a nice time tonight at a Christmas party put on for the adult literacy center, which I've gotten involved in again. I hosted a short Family Feud game, which was fun. ME: christmas is coming the geese are getting fat I finally got you an answer on Akeela and the Bee. M~~'s father said he doesn't think she has it. He was chuckling that M~~ likes presents so much it wouldn't matter if she already did have it. But then K~~ was very definite that she doesn't. At today's auction I picked up another neat Mother Goose. This \"only\" goes back to 1968 (speaking like a true geezer), but adds quite a few new ones to my collection, plus different illustrations to look at, of course. These are by Gyo Fujikawa. I implemented something I wish I had done sooner. By lumping all the Mother Goose first lines into a separate file, and then nudging them around to all start at the same place on the line, I can sort the whole thing alphabetically. Then you can see at a glance all the places a given Mother Goose appears in my collection. My search program does a similar thing, but you have to keep typing in keywords. Here, you can just step from one item to the next in a given book, say, and see where else the rhyme appears, or if it's a new one. I'll attach the sorted file so you can get an eyeful of haute culture. I also got \"Papa\", no, not a biography by Hemingway's daughter, but by Mark Twain's daughter Susy when she was 13. It has lots of annotation by Twain and looks like it will be fun. >>>Forgot to ask until too late: What was Ms Landham bristling about? >>My ideas on justice set her off.

At least, in my experience in life, I would say somewhere between most and almost all people are inclined to to dig in and do battle with any new proposal, especially from a peer. (We take new ideas from disembodied experts, leaders and manufacturers much more in stride.) I don't know, I guess that's more fun than actually thinking about something for a few minutes first. Maybe it's a resentment or jealousy thing - I really don't put much stock in psychological analyses. What made this case strange was that T~~ wrote back a week later saying she had reread some of her earlier emails and was shocked at how mean she came off. I had planned to calmly respond anyway, although it still hasn't bubbled up high enough on my list of priorities. Did you notice the crazy vocal technique on Maria Galvany's Queen of the Night cylinder? I've never heard that anywhere else, at least. I mentioned my first Charlotte Church cd. I got another one with a few opera cuts off half.com for $1.01 plus shipping. No regrets, but it definitely doesn't hit the spot for me as well as the first one. Her 15-year-old voice doesn't even sound as mature as her 14-year-old voice did to me. I had written off the adult literacy center, but I got a call lately. I'm hoping they can find a good fit for me. I went to the Christmas party on Tuesday, and emceed a short and sweet game of Family Feud. THEE: Re: ccc Hmm, still confused.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

(smileys galore!) Really, I'm always thrilled with feedback, and I'm very used to it delivered nastily. It just keeps me on my toes. And, to be absolutely honest, I can see how the way I present things might rub people the wrong way, if they don't dip down just deep enough to see I'm chuckling all the while. Anyhow, who would it benefit to preface every sentence with, \"Well, I'm not infallible, and I've made plenty of mistakes, and there have been any number of occasions in my life when I was absolutely sure about something and then it turned out I was wrong, but here's my little opinion on . . . \" Who else is obligated to write like that? >Whatever happened to with the Hispanic man?

THEE: I need to ask you a question regarding - Chas. (Charles?) de Janon. I need to know what nationality Chas. (Charles?) de Janon was. ME: I could only think of one place to go for a bit of bio on de Janon - and luckily, it didn't let me down! According to Peter Danner, whom I trust above all others in matters of 19th C. American guitarists, in his anthology, \"The Guitar In America - a historical collection of classical guitar music in facsimile\", published with the cooperation of the Guitar Foundation of America (1978): \"Charles de Janon was born in Cartagena, Columbia in 1834 and came to New York at the age of six. In his own day, de Janon was probably best known for his widely used edition of Carcassi's celebrated guitar method. He died in 1901.\" Now that I think about it, I'll bet Peter provided more extensive info on de Janon in the Soundboard somewhere along the line. Let me know if you'd be interested in more info, and I'll look it up. THEE: Geddy babel * Andre Gardner played \"Rocker\" on his show last week and identified it as \"Ready, Willing, and Able\" by Fats Domino. I dug around. I think he meant \"I'm Ready.\" Did we know this?! Here's the first line of the song: \"Well, I'm ready, I'm willin', and I'm able to rock and roll all night.\" Sounds familiar to me. * The other day, on my favorite bit-torrent site, I discovered a concert Robyn Hitchcock gave just five days ago in which he performs nothing but Syd Barrett songs. That screams L~~, I think. So I've made a CD and I'm going to send it to him at the radio station, with a note. If that doesn't work, what will? Happy holidays! Gary Crimble and so on! ME: I was still wondering if things are back to normal enough for you on Boxing Day for a visit. January in Dover sounds good, in any case. None of that about Rocker sounds familiar to me. Also, blanking on \"geddy babel\". Thanks for the heads up on Alan. I got L~~'s whole show on tape, minus the few seconds for side and tape switches. It was a brave, new world for me, hearing a radio show on the internet. I didn't think my dial-up would allow it. Or, I'd at least need a month of computer courses to figure out how to get it. In fact, I'm so fuzzy on the matter that I couldn't have told you whether it's even legal for a radio station to broadcast on the web. Don't really know what to do with the recordings, though. Good luck with the Hitchcock/Barrett bait. ME: I was a Kumon instructor for two years. They were in this country for a few decades without doing any noticeable corporate advertising - that was left to the franchisees. My understanding is that the intensive advertising campaign of the last few years has been a flop. In a communication to the instructors they admitted, \"Kumon's ALS (average length of stay for the student) and retention declined last year (2004) despite the big campaign.\" When I came on board 3 years ago, Kumon had something like 140000 students. (One child taking both math and reading counts as 2 students.) Now they're up to 200000 students. But that can be explained by the opening of hundreds of new centers; their big push into the pre-K market; and students being forced to take the second subject, reading, by presumably well-meaning parents. I've heard there is another indication things may not be going so well for Kumon: a spate of brochures in the waiting rooms with titles like \"My child is caught up, why continue?\", \"Why shouldn't I take a break from Kumon?\", and \"Why do Kumon and the school curriculum not match?\". ME: Thanks, Gerhard, und auch eine sehr fro\"hlische Weihnachten und glu\"cklisches Neue Jahr fu\"r Ihnen! THEE: I was surfing the net and came across your article which drew a lot of interest. I have known Kumon coming from Asia for years but my children have never been to one and while I have heard, I have never embraced other teaching techniques of worksheets, drilling, rote learning except that there are practices that are great for some children and not for others. As a Learning and Teaching Styles practitioner, I am even more intrigued by some of your comments of the Kumon franchise management. I was a Franchise Owner of an international drama organization based in Singapore and Hong Kong for 5 years before I moved up to the role of Master Franchisor for Eastern Asia and now based in Maryland to help develop more Franchises here in America. Therefore other franchise practices are of interest to me but certainly I never knew there are issues like the ones you highlighted. You certainly make a very dedicated instructor/business manager of the franchise because if you do not know, you would never be wise enough to give good explanations and some children do learn just solely on listening to your advice. One of my children learns that way - homework, practices and so forth are totally meaningless. He just sits and pick up everything in class and scores his \"A\" that way even without his homework done! ME: Thanks for the merry Christmas presents! I've had a good time with what I've heard so far, and will continue to do so. I've played 1776 a couple of times. Good laughs right off with John Adam's song and Richard Henry Lee's, with the stream of Lee/ly puns. Lucky thing Virginia's grandest old family wasn't called Davis or something! Too bad the producers didn't invest in $.49 worth of my consultation - I'm sure Americans hadn't added Ls to the long O sound that early on. \"He bowls and bowls . . . for he Knowles, he Knowles . . .\" A Baltimorean probably couldn't even figure out \"Volt yes\" and \"Ol' say can you see?\" What was that about a whole, not half?, zanna? (For a a crystalline \"O\", listen to Baltimore Oriole fans blast it out at the line, \"OH! say does that star-spangled banner . . .\" It's a pun, too, you see?) Got a nice gift from I~~ - a little still life on a wooden plaque. She supplied some words of inspiration with a great elision in the last line: Dear Dony, Don't live still explore your opptions in the world is your playground! (I see the dictionary doesn't support my notion of an elision being where an ending of something takes up as the beginning of the next thing, as in a musical elision. Too bad.) My index of first lines of Mother Goose rhymes in my collection turned out so handy I did the same thing for Grimm's titles. That was actually a little trickier since there is the potential for completely different titles given to the same story. I tracked 'em all down and standardized 'em, though. At one of last week's auctions I got a kid's poster book from 1938 where you cut out figures and layer them on the poster and on top of each other to get a 3-D effect. Besides being old, an attraction was each poster being a Mother Goose rhyme. I've done 4 out of the 6, and I think the final results are really neat. If the book was more valuable un-cut up, then I guess the surviving copies are even more valuable now! One of the rhymes was: Tom, Tom, the piper's son Stole a pig and away he run. The pig was eat and Tom was beat And Tom ran crying down the street. which brings to mind my interest in > ...that killed the Rat, > that eat the Malt, > that lay in the House that Jack built. I don't know, but I'm guessing that most people don't know that \"et\" is an acceptable past tense for \"eat\", although it's spelled \"eat\", not \"et\". I think most people wouldn't read those lines correctly, but I could be wrong. I was surprised to find recently that I was named in a patent. That explains this round of emails from a few years ago. I'll leave it in it's back-to-front form. I guess people are more used to that now. Once, I presented an email conversation to H~~ in chronological form, and he couldn't figure it out. Date: Mon, 18 Sep 2000 14:13:44 -0400 From: Bill.Pierce@USPTO.GOV Subject: roofball I work for Patent and Trademark Office. My group is concerned with new type of games including those related to tennis and the like. Copies of your web site are being added to our files and we needed a date to put on them should they ever become of use. Thank for you prompt response. >Hi Bill, >It looks like I put my roofball webpage up in June 1999. That's the date of a file that I downloaded to my disk of an image I found on the web of 2 people playing their version of roofball. I make mention of that picture in my webpage. I don't have any other documents, but I'm sure you know of the roofball website, which I added a link to at the bottom of my page. Nope, it never occurred to me to use paddles - roofball always seemed like a volleyball variant to me. I am more than a little intrigued by your mention of \"office files\" on roofball. (Are roofballers under government surveillance?) >>When (dated) was your webpage to roofball first published. Do you have any other dated documents on the sport. Do you have any dated documents with a version using a racket or paddle? This information is requested to add to office files about the sport. Ex. Pierce You can find the patent via Google, by the way. I don't know how many people know about all those other search functions Google offers if you click on \"more>\" and \"even more>\". I haven't thought of a use for it, but they actually rip apart and scan mail order catalogs that otherwise don't appear online! I just plugged \"quit kickin\" into the news archives and got 117 hits. Anyhow, can there be any lingering doubt about who *really* invented roofball, the real version? Courteously, Donald ME: Oh, right, you enjoy a relaxed week at work while the rest of the world squanders vacation time. Good thinking! Nope, we hadn't talked about Boxing Day, but if you read your mail . . . (I think this is where they use a ;-) How I taped L~~'s show off the computer is a story that would have burned up half of Boxing Day. Where's Oliver Stone when you need him? No, I didn't actually listen to it all. The last in line of all the amazing things I had never done before was realize there's a U-turn switch on my tape recorder, allowing me to record the last 110 minutes (I had an extra-length, high bias tape!) while I was tucked away in bed, although, admittedly, sleeping somewhat fitfully with all that futuristic technology cranking. As far as my peace of mind was concerned, there might as well have been a convention of Neptunians out in the kitchen. Sorry about the colds. I'm the last person to bend an ear to anybody else's home cures, but have I ever mentioned my near certainty that hitting ye olde Listerine hard when I feel a cold coming on has foiled dozens of them for me? THEE: subject \"Oh, there's a NEW Mexico!\"--Simpson, H. Did you do a direct hookup from computer to tape deck? Will wonders never cease? If you can pick up KUNM, you're ready for WMGK, and \"Breakfast With the Beatles\" with Andre Gardner, tomorrow, 9-11 a.m. He'll be playing a \"Love\" isolation track! Go to http://www.wmgk.com/, and click on \"Listen Live Here.\" THEE: >Too bad the producers didn't invest in $.49 worth of my consultation - I'm sure Americans hadn't added Ls to the long O sound that early on. \"He bowls and bowls . . . for he Knowles, he Knowles . . .\" I've often wondered about pronunciation back then. British pronunciation often baffles me, such as the pronunciation of Lady Chonmondeley as Lady Chumley. THEE: How many student average at each Kumon center? Reading your interesting article, while we have been thinking about to open a center ourselves, I have a quiestion not answered by the office: How many students in average are at Kumon center? We try to figure out a business plan. Average, $50k~75k per year after costs after two years? The first year can be a total loss due to marketing process? ME: That's a very good question. I've wondered myself about average enrollment and also the average tuition set by U.S. Kumon centers. A year or so ago I *heard* that the average tuition in the Southeast is $115/month. I *believe* the average enrollment is about 100 students per center. I get this from 200,000 students and 2000 centers, BUT I'm not sure how accurate or up-to-date those figures are, and I have never been sure whether the figures I hear are both for the same geographic area, that is, both for the U.S. or both for North America. I'm sure many Kumon centers are able to make a profit in the first year, especially given the low startup costs and the rent subsidy. Good luck! THEE: subject fingering suggestion for guitar tablature I feel strange writing you, we being perfect strangers and all. I read through your thoughts on tablature, and thought I could relieve your issue on how best to finger it. What I do is get four highlighters of different color, one color corresponding to each finger. I use pink, orange, yellow, blue, for 1, 2, 3, 4. Each fret number in the tab gets a quick highlight with the appropriate color. It's pretty easy going once the colors are securely learned. I hope this was of some assistance. ME: That sounds like a great idea! Unless you object, I'd like to add your fingering idea to my tablature page, with full credit to you. ME: I just got around to a web search to see if we were the only people on earth who know that toadfish growl. This came up right at the top: http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1823976 ME: Also wondering if you could do me a favor before then. I'm curious about a setting on my computer related to the appearance of characters. A program crashed and left my characters looking horrible. I diddled around and got them looking pretty good, but I'm not sure they're back 100% Here are the steps: start Control Panel Appearance and Themes Display Appearance (tab) Effects... __ Use the following method to smooth the edges of screen fonts: I'm wondering if that last one is checked or not, and if so, whether Standard or ClearType is selected in the drop-down box. I'm mostly interested in how this is set on your laptop. Windows help indicates that ClearType might help a laptop, but not be needed on a desktop. So I'm wondering if your laptop has Cleartype set, and what are the effects of temporarily disabling Cleartype. While I'm typing away, maybe you have some thoughts on a problem that's completely stumped everybody I've talked to so far. Are there hands- free headsets for old-fashioned land-line phones? If so, can the the mouthpiece/mic be separated from the headset? If there is nothing off- the-shelf that will do this, can you think of any solution for playing guitar duets over the phone with a guitar partner? THEE: subject: toadfish I'm telling you, this just proves the www can confirm most anything. That was some pretty interesting stories.I'll tell you, those toadfish did freak me out when stumbling across them. I still say they come from the prehistoric days. ME: C~~ said he bought something from you recently, and when he started to talk about a print, I asked if it was the infamous 235b Don Swann print - and it was! Tell him he ought to erase the 3 and the 5. THEE: subject That Hard Day's Night Chord I've been using this chord for years for the beginning chord to Hard Days Night. It's a D7sus4 add B ----- 3 ---- ----- 1 ---- ----- 2 ---- ----- 0 ---- ----- 2 ---- ----- X ---- Muffle the low E note. Please let me know what you think. ME: Thanks for visiting, and thanks for sharing. To my ears, the low B sounds a bit suspect, but I'd ask somebody with sharper ears than me! ME: mom on tv When Mom and Pop were on that local \"yard sale\" tv show, were you the ones that taped it, and if so, do you still have the tape, and if so, would A~~ or anybody you know be able to convert it to a format to put it up on Youtube? I thought Mom put on a good show with the old fan and opera glass, and it would be neat to have the video on the web. THEE: RE: That Hard Day's Night Chord Yes I was a little indifferent about that low B too, but nothing else on that string sounds as close and I don't believe the chord is a straight d7sus4 with a added low G or even the open A either. But if it's played with more emphasis on the higher strings and not so much on the B I think it's pretty close. I just saw the making of A Hard Days Night DVD and in it George Martin said he was the one that suggested to John Lennon to come up with a strong opening chord and John fooled around for awhile and then George suddenly said \"That's it\". George even said to this day he has no idea what chord that was. ME: Yes, I noticed that too about not emphasizing the low B. And it seems like other people have trouble with the 5th string, stopping with 4-note chords, for example. Notice that my friend Bob's solution uses the 5th fret on the 5th string, which is the same as the open D string. Interesting story from the Making of HDN dvd. I read an earlier interview with George where he said something totally wrong about the chord. He said it was a barred F chord with the G on the first string added. I went straight to my guitar with high hopes, but that was *way* off! THEE: subject sears guitar hey don,I have a older sears and roebuck acoustic guitar and wondering if you can give me a rough idea if it is worth anything? ME: Wish I could help. Best I can suggest is keep an eye on ebay for similar items. Good luck! ME: We went back to my office just before the New Year's Eve grand finale. The star stickers came off N~~'s princess crown, which she made. The animal demonstration was fascinating. The turtle was HUGE; the shell alone was about 2 feet, front to back. The baby monkey was some sort of species I'd never seen before. N~~ means he was primping his \"mother\", which is what those monkeys naturally do for friends and family. He combed through her hair and checked down the back of her sweater for looking for mites and fleas. He thinks any little speck - freckle, scab, mole - is one and will try to bite it off. He'd be happy to do that all day long. Besides a python, skunk, aligator and eagle owl they also had a legless lizard - looking to us just like a snake - and a binturong, a.k.a. bear cat. The fussball table was an outdoors, enormous model constructed for First Night. I was really irked when I noticed I had lost the wicker basket N~~ made. Besides hating to lose things, it was a cute little basket, plus we had sunk so much effort into lugging our haul around up to that point. Last I remember seeing it was with all our things under the fussball table, although I might have dropped it later. ME: The fact that you get something when you type in a composer says you know what you're doing, so I probably don't have those exact album titles. A tip about doing searches is to search on the fewest words or terms that will probably give what you want. So if I type in the whole title, and you type in the whole title, but one of us puts in an extra space, it won't match. So search on the most oddball word, or pair of words, in the title. Searching for these records is just for the fun of it, but it's also good to have good search abilities. I guess you noticed when you start your search you can just keep hitting enter to go to the next occurrence. If you break that flow, but want to continue searching later, then you hit the F3 key, and it will search on the last thing you looked for. Sometimes it starts from where you left off; sometimes it starts from the beginning again. The way Windows and Microsoft do searches is the absolutely most clumsy, unreliable way I've seen since being involved in computers, but it's what the world has to live with. Went to Dover's First Night last night. Saw some amazing magic acts, a fascinating animal show, and a couple of fireworks displays, one of which was \"best ever\". Lots of other fun things, too, like the giant outdoor fussball table. http://www.geocities.com/donaldsauter/opcat.htm [now http://www.donaldsauter.com/opera-record-catalog.htm ] ME: The opening fireworks was a display by Pyrotecnico. I've mentioned before how much I enjoyed their fireworks. As far as I can tell, there's no people involved; the whole thing is like a computerized fountain of choreographed fireworks. Looks like they all come blasting out of the same spot, even. Don't know how they do it. And what's really great is how close they let you get; just across the street, practically. There was a segment where you really got the impression they were aimed at you. Don't blame I~~ for \"electroccuted\". When I went to toss a piece of scratch paper, I see that's how I jotted it down for her. Some help. One of the funniest parts of the magic show was when the magician picked a boy from the audience and stood him on a stool and dressed him up like Harry Potter with a great, big coat on. Then the magician hid behind and stuck his own hands through the sleeves and did all sorts of groovy tricks, like fanning cards and hooking and unhooking rings. He must have whispered instructions to the boy, so he would blow on the rings to make them separate, for instance. samed = seemed The amazing and hilarious optical illusion was having us look at a spinning wheel for 20 seconds, and then immediately to the magician's head - and it looked like it was expanding! Spinning the wheel the other way made his head shrink down to apple-size. (Shades of Caesar Rodney?) bean bug = bean bag toss This was Dover's 10th First Night and they made big boards painted with all 10 First Night logos with holes cut in for bean bag tossing. Of course, most kiddies stand a few steps away for their little tosses. Of course, I gathered up a basket of bean bags and moved half way down the block. I don't know how, but poor I~~ kept getting pelted. Then my bean bags started falling out of the sky, over both ranks of targets. Last I saw, there was a riot going on. Ring toss was done with hula hoops. That was a little more dangerous, so I only took my hoops a quarter of the way down the block. Poppy papper dance is self-explanatory. There was a crazy guy bucket percussionist out in front of the Schwartz Center and he beat away while everybody jumped and danced and stomped on sheets of bubble wrap. page with comments I~~ didn't mention the Pyrates Royale musical comedy. They swore us all to a life of pyracy before it was over - the main thing you need to know is you can't be a pirate with all your parts. She did get a hug from all five pyrates in the crew. Good idea - easier to administer than an autograph collection. You see the baby monkey primping his mama's hair. You also see his true-to-life diaper. What I thought were fireworks are apparently earrings, the foamy originals of which I stuck on below. Luckily, the one that fell off in my sleep didn't get lost. There are no buttons on the shiny blue shirt because they're hidden by the flap down the front (which actually goes up to the collar, which actually closes up in front, sort of like a priest's. I also dispute the proportions.) Never confuse wodsim for wisdom. I~~ didn't mention how she tried to starve me out. You know better than me what a pain in the neck it is lugging kids around. (Oops, sorry, E~~.) I mean, I could'a seen TWICE as many shows AND snuck in a bite here and there, but we were always too far from the People's Church basement to expect a little kid to dash on over so I could have my annual chili dog. But we finally found time around 11:00 - and it was the BEST CHILI DOG ON EARTH. When I went back for one to savor, it turned out I had gotten their LAST hot dog, so I settled for a dogless, bunless chili dog (in a bowl). As Damon Runyon will say, \"Some parents are very fond of children, though personally I will not give you a dime for a dozen of them, male AND female. Then it was back to my office, via the bean bag toss and poppy papper dance, for letter writing, and then back to Legislative Mall for the ball drop, which we got right up to just as it hit bottom (try that in Time's Square) and the fireworks went off. I met I~~'s father at the auction today and he said I~~ slept for 12 hours. THEE: I~~ already writes as well as an occasional student of mine. I wouldn't have figured out the poppy papper dance, but now that you explained it, her name for it is perfect. ME: rarer than hens' teeth (almost) The only actual guitar quartet from the 19th C. I've ever heard of, American or European, is the Lhoyer quartet. Full name is Air Varie et dialogue pour quatre Guitares, no opus (Paris). It's nice. It's in 3 movements, with the 2nd movement being a theme and 5 variations. I have a nice copy from LC - better than original. Would you like that? The only other thing that comes to mind as a possibility is the American programmatic piece, A Trip To Rocky Point. It's actually for 2 banjos and guitar, plus a mandolin in one section, and a vocal quartet in another, and could be easily done on 4 guitars (although the mandolin is nice.) It also has bells and whistles and sand blocks and castanets. Could your audience handle that? :) The guitar society recorded it. Would you like a copy of the recording to see what you think? THEE: subject Help with Pictionary I am in the middle of a dispute with the opposing Pictionary team. The word was Northeast. By drawing a compass, I was able to get my team to say \"North\", \"South\", \"East\", \"West\". Since my team said North and then said East, was this a win within the Pictionary rules? Your help would be appreciated. PS - Totally had a blast playing the game. ME: Well, I'm not sure my opinion counts more than anyone else's, but I would have to say I need to hear the word \"northeast\", all run together. BUT... that's just my very strong opinion. Don't anybody start punching or stabbing anybody! THEE: We have finally recovered from colds and flu and want to wish you all a wonderful New Year ahead! May we finally have the PEACE John Lennon envisioned! ME: By the way, I'd been thinking about that Gobble duet arr. by Foden lately (don't know if it's on the cd) because the song pops up a few times on the UCSB cylinder site, once in Spanish as \"Duo de los Pavos\". It's a funny song. ME: Here's the music - hope you can pull off Rocky Point. Regarding Rocky Point: It might be a little confusing at first, but you'll figure it out. I took the original parts and did a little cutting and pasting to cover a few options, such as for guitar trio, or guitar trio plus a mandolin, or even if a vocal quartet were handy. (You can find the words on the cd notes. You won't want to use them.) The 4th guitar can keep himself busy with the mandolin, sound effects, and doubling banjo 2 or the guitar part. THEE: Re: Help with Pictionary I believe you are correct......thank you so much. ME: big surprise I got a call today from H~~, the 9th-grader's, mother. They had shown up at my office *yesterday* (Wednesday)! When she had said on Monday, \"Next Wednesday\", to me that means the Wednesday that's about a week away, not the day after tomorrow. Plus I figured she was just getting into a weekly groove. The tutoring ad below mine in the Dover Post is already gone, which disappoints me slightly. ME: I got your music off to you. Forgot to mention in the note to play the tape with Dolby on. I've never heard a tape in my life that needed dolby as bad as this one. THEE: Re: poppy papper dance band >Fireworks pictures aren't any great shakes, but this is neat, with them erupting about 150 feet from Legislative Hall. Definitely a striking backdrop. Yesterday afternoon we went to see Night at the Museum. From the first few minutes, I had little hope for it. Turned out to be a pretty funny movie. Imagine Teddy Roosevelt gazing through binoculars at Sacagawea for 50 years without the nerve to talk to her and a pharoah's mummy rising from the tomb speaking perfect British English because he had been on display for years at Cambridge or bands of Huns, Romans, and cowboys--most from miniature dioramas--teaming up to capture the trio of newly retired night guards (Bill Cobbs, Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney) who were trying to steal the Egyptian tablet of Ahkmenrah that made them and everything else in the natural history museum come to life every night. It even had a memorable monkey . . . but no mother. Night at the Museum won't become a classic, but it was a funny afternoon's entertainment. Kids will love it but would benefit from a history lesson before hand. THEE: subject [Fixing skips in phonograph records Question] I have read your page \"Fixing skips in phonograph records\". Actually, i just bought a ($70) record which unfortunately is scratched. (~5 millimeters scratch, almost parralel to the grooves) I have understood your method but i really don't think i can handle it (even with a magnifying glass). Do you accept to repair other's records ? If not, thank you nevertheless for putting your method online. ME: I'm sorry, it's not feasible to try to repair records for other people. If your scratch is almost parallel to the grooves, that's the worst situation, but not hopeless. I would suggest practicing on a worthless record to get a feel for the motion with the pin. If you're still afraid, ask a friend you trust to give it a try. It's very unlikely you will do anything to make the skip worse. Good luck. ME: he staid, sate and eat >I don't see a hole for the bags. I'm almost positive it was the bell of that Seuss-like sousaphone instrument in the middle. There's a tell-tale line that would be the cut in the plywood. I have a theory about my drumline question. I think it was S~~ who mentioned there was a movie called Drumline. A quick search says it came out in 2002. So if that started the drumline craze, it would be consistent with me only being exposed about the time of my move to Delaware. That's a bunch of ifs, of course. Thanks for the Purple Cow In Court. It's made itself at home on my table here, which explains why I forget to mention it, and why I keep forgetting to do a little search on the Dailey/financier/libel business, which I couldn't figure out from the article. Went to a very interesting talk on Delaware governors at Legislative Hall on Saturday. There are some really crazy episodes, like our first governor (called president) being kidnapped by the British, and Delaware not wanting him back. I wished that the presenter would put his talk together in a booklet or on the web. It was just the right amount of knowledge to have on such a subject, and I sure don't want to have to read a fat book to bring some of it back. Today I was less lucky. There was a book discussion at the library, the first in a series called \"For Grown-ups Only: Children's Literature Revisited\". This one was devoted to fairy tales, which is what snagged me. I got the two books on Thursday and plugged away at them in my usual way, dragging out all the versions I have in my own collection. I guess I was hoping that they would do a story by run-through, and that I would get up courage now and then to add 2 cents. It didn't turn out like that. The leader had a batch of discussion questions like, \"What stereotypes of older women are found in these stories?\" That isn't exactly what I was thinking about plowing through the 48 stories, which, by that time, you're starting to get Goldilocks and Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty and Little Red Riding Hood all mixed up, anyhow. One book was The Classic Fairy Tales by the Opies, which has the earliest English versions of all the well-known tales. My biggest surprises were the earthy language in The History of Tom Thumb, and the main character in The Three Bears was an old woman. But mostly I'm bugged at myself, because I did miss opportunities to pipe up in a few places that I think would have been appreciated. I had a few comments for the leader at the end, and she said, \"You should have said something!\" For instance, I showed her the great, great ending of Tatterhood that I got off the web. (Kumon gave the first half of the story in one of their worksheet sets.) Tatterhood is *so* much cooler in the web version than in the 1970s book \"Tatterhood and Other Tales.\" Hey, I know! I'll unload my 8 pages of notes on my writing perfessor friend! Just kidding; don't keel over. But looking forward to the day when I hoist all my email up on the web, let me digitize a few of them. At one point Dr. D~~, the leader, brought things back to earth and simply asked if we had any favorites. I kept mum, but the one person who piped up named \"Kupti and Imani\". Judy said, \"Ah, yes! And I also like \"The Lute Player.\" This was amazing - those were *my* one-two favorites! Kupti was the 16th story in the book, and I wrote a little note, \"best yet\". Then, for the very next story, \"The Lute Player\", I wrote, \"very good\". They were both standouts, if you ever get hold of the Tatterhood book, and assuming my recommendation is not the kiss of death (definitely the world's most dubious assumption.) The story after that, \"Clever Manka\" was very interesting to me because a little bit into the story, it turns into the Grimms' \"Die Kluge\" (smart woman). The editor's notes on the story mention all kinds of variants in all kinds of countries, but not Grimm. It's not like it's an obscure one; Carl Orff turned it into an opera. I also found at least three more instances of eat as the past tense of eat, although I guess I'm the only one who collects those. Another nice -n past participle for my collection (my single favorite English language word is \"mown\") was \"gnawne\" from \"The History of Tom Thumbe\" (1621). Thanks again for the Christmas cds. After the dust settled, 1776 was still the big favorite, and my favorite on that was the opener, Sit Down, John - very operatic, but even more fun.

It was the night before Christmas. The house was very quiet. No creatures were stirring in the house. There weren't even any mice stirring. The stockings had been hung carefully by the chimney. The children hoped that Saint Nicholas would come and fill them. ME: I mentioned the For Grown-ups Only: Children's Literature Revisit"
