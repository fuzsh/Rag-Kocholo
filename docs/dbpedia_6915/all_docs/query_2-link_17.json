He adds:\n\nâBeing a sports-enthusiast and an intermediate level table tennis player, I have tried to pen down the nitty-gritty of this racquet game in this poem using âsimileâ as one of the figures of speech while comparing the playing surface with a mini-playground! I also like to share the experiences that I have had while playing in different level tournaments and the essential requisites with the special mention of the âGOATSâ (Greatest player of all timesâChinaâs Ma Long, Franceâs Alex Lebrun, and Adam Bobrow, American table tennis commentator whom I greatly adore) through this poem. As a matter of fact, I do have a strong bonding, a feeling of camaraderie with my duo (my racquet-ping pong balls) and one canât deny the fact that a sport teaches you significant skills and life values even at a very early age!\n\nâI like to venture into varied activities and learn associated skills, which I feel is a life-long process. I envision myself to be a world-class table tennis player and grow up to be a sports coach or may pursue sports medicine! I wish to transform my passion into an initiative that would strengthen the feeling of âLove Sportsâ in the minds of youngsters or rather every common individual.\n\nâI also do a lot of sketching of famous personalities and exhibit interest in playing musical instruments like tabla and keyboard. I have drawn a sketch of Neymar da Silva santos Jr, a Brazilian professional soccer player as he is a great role model for young athletes. He is humble and gives 100% on the field. He posts funny videos of himself on social media and I relate myself to him as he is hyperactive and playful.â\n\nCelebrating Earth Day!\n\nHugging an Evergreen Tree on a hike in Central Oregon. Photo: Mel Bankoff, Oregon.\n\nEarth Day Greetings!\n\nAs I bicycled to work this cool, breezy spring morning in the Pacific Northwest, I admired the many new shoots reaching for the sun, and spring flowers seeking bees and other insects along the bike trail and sidewalks. I vividly recalled my childhood in central India. We lived in an apartment building right in the middle of downtown in the city of Indore. There was no room for any backyard gardens. But we had a very small windowsill garden space for a couple of pots. I remember the excitement I felt as the garbanzo bean plants grew new leaves or when those beautiful red flowers appeared on another potted plant.\n\nAlmost Everything in the Garden is Growing Vibrantly.Â Photo: Arun N. TokÃ©\n\nWe have been enjoying spring flowers in our garden, and harvesting arugula, fennel shoots, green onions, etc. Apple trees and various berries are doing their usual spring growth with a promise of bountiful fruit harvest! And, various nature hikes in the area fill our hearts with a sense of appreciation and gratitude to Mother Nature.\n\nWhile many of us might be looking forward to visiting some special wonders of nature during school break this yearâDenali, Yellowstone, Grand Canyon, Grand Titon, Redwoods or another beautiful placeâlike the Horseshoe Bend in Arizona, let us not forget that natural beauty can be found all around us, even in our backyard!\n\nYet, I must share my deep sadness with you. Everyday, I am feeling the pain of countless children, mothers and fathers in places like the Gaza, Sudan, and Ukraine, where wars, climate change and droughts make living conditions dire for tens of millions. The military operations and environmental destruction responsible for human suffering go on unabated. Governments, including ours, are unresponsive to the needs of innocent, civilian victims. The human rights of millions of children, women and men are being violated. They are forced to live in subhuman conditions. Even in our own cities all across this so-called rich nation, countless homeless men and women live in less than desirable conditions. We are told there is no money for social programs, as the government spends close to a trillion dollars on feeding the war machines.\n\nSkipping Stones, like any other socially responsible media outlet, has often shed light on the plight of suffering humanity around the world. While we donât want to forget this pain and suffering, we also donât want our readers to get depressed by the doom and gloom thatâs all around us.\n\nThe list of issues we can and must face is long. It includes our ever-increasing use of plastics and forever-chemicals, the decimation of insect and bird populations, the climate change, disappearing glaciers, deforestation and destruction of natural habitats, over-fishing and overgrazing, mindless mining of fossil fuels, environmental pollution, groundwater contamination, land-use issues, nuclear weapons, environmental and social justice, and homelessness, poverty and hunger. You can add many more items to this listâboth of local concern and global importance!\n\nOur future survival and flourishing depends on how we respond to these problems we have created with our ever-increasing consumption of resources, economic systems, greed, privatization and exploitation of resources, for example.\n\nYou might like to ask yourself a few deep questions (see some examples below) and try to answer them honestly and at length:\n\nWhat do we love about where we live?\n\nHow can we make a difference right where we are planted, in our communities?\n\nHow can we let Mother Earth know how much we love her?\n\nWhat might we cultivate in our own backyard?\n\nHow can we help out our neighbors?\n\nWhat small thing might we do today to heal the world and ourselves?\n\nWhat is happiness?\n\nWhat makes us really happyâhappiness that might last for a really long while?\n\nHow much of material consumption is sufficient or plenty for our happiness?\n\nWhat is the law of diminishing returns?\n\nWhat is the difference between needs and wants?\n\nAnd as a group of friends or community, we might ask:\n\nCan an economy based on ever-increasing growth be sustained?Â\n\nCan we continue to use natural resources in an uncontrolled manner?\n\nWhat can we as a community or society do to minimize our negative impact on nature?\n\nAs conscientious citizen and human beings, how can we respond constructively?\n\nLet us not abuse the gifts we have been granted by Mother Nature. Let us not knowingly degrade or destroy the very web of life of which we are an integral part. Human life cannot continue without this web of lifeâour biosphere. As âintelligentâ species, we must address these issues that we have created collectively since industrialization.\n\nLet us make an effort to appreciate the beauty around us, as we work to address these adversities. Letâs respect the many miracles of nature that surround us. Let us learn to enjoy even the smallest gifts that we receive everyday, be it listening to a bird song, fluttering of a butterfly or hummingbird, observing a cluster of green leaves or the multitude of seeds and fruits that plants produce.\n\nLet us be grateful for the many blessings we have been granted. Let us live fully and let nature liveâin all its glory! Let us commit ourselves to doing what we can to sustain these blessings, this beauty, for all future generations.\n\nDear fellow earthlings, let’s remember that Earth Day is not just April 22nd; we can observe it each and every day.\n\nâArun Narayan TokÃ©, Skipping Stones editor.\n\nName the Past for Our Future:\n\nOn the Armenian Genocide\n\nBy Laurel Aronian, age 17, Connecticut.\n\nIn 1915, the Armenian Genocide commencedâthe systematic mass murder of 1.5 million Armenians by the Ottoman government. I wrote this poem as a representation of the ongoing effects of the genocide on Armenians; even survivors found their lives uprooted as they were forced to move to other countries and begin from nothing. This poem not only serves to comment on my ancestorsâ abrupt relocation from their homeland but also as a reflection on how my opportunity to visit Armenia in 2019 allowed me to return to the place my ancestors unwillingly left behindâmetaphorically restoring them to their native land and simultaneously instilling in me an appreciation for a culture and history that I will carry forward.Â\n\nâThe Land Aheadâ\n\nSoot swirls around our footsteps,\n\nthe dust from our lives before.\n\nBefore, when we lived in the stonyÂ\n\ncliffs of the Caucasus.\n\nWith my family who sent me\n\non my own.\n\nTo start a new life.\n\nA life away from those who had takenÂ\n\nit from us.\n\nThe land that my family had livedÂ\n\non for hundreds of years was seized.\n\nBitlis, Diyarbekir, Erzurum, where I had\n\nplayed in the long grass of the mountains with my brothers.\n\nLuck is what saved me from the massacres.\n\nI do not knowÂ\n\nwhat happened to my brothers,\n\nwho I had left\n\nbehind me.\n\nThe rocky road ahead is also littered\n\nwith dust.\n\nIt obscures my vision on all sides.Â\n\nI do not know what is ahead of me\n\nor what I have left behind.\n\nThe smell of gasoline is strong\n\nas I board the plane.Â\n\nI have left my home for the flight,\n\nbut will return in a jetÂ\n\nmoving as swift as an Eagle.\n\nThe sign above is in letters\n\nI canât read\n\nÔ¹Õ¼Õ«Õ¹Ö Õ¤Õ¥ÕºÕ« ÕÕ¡ÕµÕ¡Õ½Õ¿Õ¡Õ¶ Õ¿Õ¥ÖÕ´Õ«Õ¶Õ¡Õ¬ 4A\n\nOnly one word is clear to me,\n\nÕÕ¡ÕµÕ¡Õ½Õ¿Õ¡Õ¶, Hayastan, where myÂ\n\nsecond great-grandfather is fromÂ\n\nand where IÂ\n\nam going.\n\nBack in his day,Â\n\nthere were no planes,\n\nwhen he traveled to the US\n\nAlone.\n\nDid he know that hisÂ\n\ngreat, great-granddaughter would be going to his homeland?\n\nHis homeland where he had to leave\n\nhis home.\n\nHe left his country in the hope\n\nthat one dayÂ\n\nthe part of him in meÂ\n\ncould return.\n\nBy Laurel Aronian, age 17, Connecticut. She adds: âI love to write in all genres (poetry, prose, journalism). I also enjoy taking photos and creating art. I have a passion for music and perform as a singer-songwriter and accompany on guitar. When I’m not writing or making music, I play competitive chess. My pieces also reflect the awe of nature, earth stewardship, and our planet’s majesty and magic.â\n\nPS: Laurel entered the poem for our 2023 Youth Honor Awards last year at the age of 16.\n\nArt in the Time of War:Â The Children of Zaporizhzhia\n\nBy Svitlana Budzhak-Jones, President, Sisterâs Sister, Inc.\n\nThe unprovoked, brutal war against Ukraine sadly has entered its third year. It has brought much destruction and sorrow to the people of Ukraine. Millions were displaced internally. Millions became refugees elsewhere in the world. Countless Ukrainian children have lost their homes, have difficulties in accessing education, health care and even basic necessities such as drinking water. Bomb shelters and cellars have replaced their rooms, metro benches have become their beds, and air raid sirens on a daily basis drone instead of school bells. While many Ukrainian men and women actively fight on the battlefield for their country, culture and independence, others stay dedicated to the children who remain in Ukraine.\n\nThe Central Southern city of Zaporizhzhia is under constant artillery shelling and aerial bombing. But the Center for Childrenâs and Youth Creativity in the city continues to operate, and attempts to create a safe space to safeguard the childrenâs childhood. The Gradient creative Computer Design Circle at the Center has not closed its doors even when its teacher Ms. Nadiya Chepiga was forced to flee Ukraine to Poland in the first months of heavy enemy assaults on the city. Ms. Chepiga then continued to work with her students online for the entire year before returning back to her home city and to her students.\n\nThe Gradient Circle is now in its thirteenth year of operation. Hundreds of children between the ages of 6 and 17 have learned to create beautiful art there and connect with their inner spirit, bringing them one step closer to becoming professional graphic designers and artists. The Circle creates a comfortable environment for shaping children’s creative abilities, meeting their individual needs for intellectual, moral, aesthetic, and creative development, shaping a culture that includes a healthy lifestyle and organizing their free time. The children learn the principles of drawing art objects, creating drawings and 3D images, acquiring skills in making artwork in various media and styles, learning the basics of graphic design, creating postcards, posters, calendars, and memorabilia. The children search for their individual style of work and aesthetic preferences, develop their creative imagination and fantasy, learn to take creative initiative, and develop their independence.\n\nThe Circleâs founding director and teacher Nadiya Chepiga is a creative artist herself, who has implemented numerous creative projects with her students, has helped them realize their creative vision and brought them to life, and trained hundreds of creative individuals. Despite the ongoing war, the students and their teacher continue participating in various nationwide Ukrainian and International competitions as well as in art exhibitions.\n\nLife goes on even in the extremely challenging circumstances created by the war. The students and their teacher continue meeting twice per week. Frequently, instruction needs to be done online because of constant air raid warnings. But on Sundays, the students try to meet with their teacher in person in the Center. And if an air raid siren goes off, they seek cover in the basement (see below) or in corridors where they continue their lessons. Since the enemy missiles and bombs focus on destroying power plants, there is usually no heat, and the students wear winter coats and jackets during their lessons. Yet they enjoy their meetings and continue creating beautiful, original works of art.\n\nFifteen of their art creations were exhibited by the humanitarian aid organization Sisterâs Sister (www.SistersSister.org) in State College, Pennsylvania on March 23, 2024 during a benefit concert for Ukraine. Sisterâs Sister provides humanitarian support to the Ukrainian people, particularly to children, hospitals, orphanages, and the disabled in Ukraine, including State Collegeâs sister city, Nizhyn, located in the Chernihiv region. The artwork exhibited at the concert was created by the students and enhanced with computer graphics under the supervision and guidance of their teacher. Their work draws, in part, on Ukrainian art, famous for its folk traditions and exquisite embroidery, the red and black threads of which represent happiness and sorrow. Sadly, there is too much of the black threads of sorrow in these difficult times for the children of Ukraine, while Nadiya Chepiga, whose first name means âhope,â brings hope to the children of Zaporizhzhia through art.

(www.SistersSister.org)Â\n\nMemories of a Guava Tree\n\nBy Dawson Yee, age 13, grade 7, California.\n\nMy grandmotherâs hands reach for my face\n\nFeeling to be sure I am the child she remembers\n\nHer mind has only enough space\n\nfor past Decembers.\n\nMy mother, father, and aunt turn in surprise\n\nHer knotted hands grip my shoulders in recognition\n\nWith a teasing crinkle in her eyes\n\nshe calls my name, an intermission\n\nThree years ago, she gave me a white guava seedling\n\nWith hardy red stems and elliptical leaves\n\nShe explained what it was needing\n\nLearned from years of shielding it from disease.\n\nAfterwards, she ushered me into the guest room, where she unearthed treasure:\n\nAn embroidered Japanese trinket box, a logic puzzle, an old plush toy\n\nHer smiling eyes watched my curiosity with pleasure\n\nAs she entered the absurdly colorful world of a little boy.\n\nBut now we sit together watching nature shows\n\nAnd she is like a sailor disappearing into a storm.\n\nI can see her boat sinking but Iâm not sure she knows\n\nsheâs lost her tiller and our roles will transform.\n\nA logger chopping a tree flashes on the screen\n\nShe worries for the animals inside, knowing they are doomed.\n\nI reach over her frail figure and push the remote to intervene\n\nI tell her that our guava has finally bloomed.\n\nâDawson Yee, age 13, grade 7, California. Dawson writes:\n\nâI see creative writing as a puzzle of wisdom. Iâm 13 years old and in 7th grade but take high school English and philosophy at a local independent school.Â\n\nâIâve also adored challenging myself to understand the symbolism behind not only prose such as in magical realism, but also the figurative language in poetry. When I recently analyzed âBoy and Eggâ by Palestinian-American poet Naomi Shihab Nye, I found that searching for evidence of Nyeâs purposeful line breaks and sound devices to convince a reader she was contrasting the innocence of a childhood immersed in nature versus the chaotic world to be beyond satisfying as a puzzle to solve.Â\n\nâI use my heritage as a third-generation Asian American to inform my writing, as it is an important part of how I view the world. I also write with an eye to health, both physical and mental, as I personally have several life-threatening allergies as well as Mass Cell Activation Syndrome, which shape my view of the world. My maternal grandmother, who recently passed away from Alzheimerâs disease, provided the basis for my poem âMemories of a Guava Tree.â In addition, I am influenced by my parentsâ experiences as second-generation Americans growing up in predominantly non-Asian rural and inner-city U.S. communities and by my grandparentsâ stories of the immigrant experience and their childhoods wrenched by memories of war and poverty.Â\n\nâIâm also an Event Coordinator for an online, international Asian American youth writersâ collective, Asian Youth Writers Alliance (asianyouthwritersalliance.com). In the writing groups that Iâve found surrounding these events and projects, where my classmates and fellow writers are insightful and tactful, I feel I have the space to put the puzzle of wisdom together. I would love to connect with a multicultural and global community of young writers who share the same values as these online initiatives. In finding literary magazines like Skipping Stones to share my writing, I realize more and more that Iâm truly searching for the exact kind of wisdom and togetherness it provides.â\n\nAffirmative Action Was Never Enough\n\nBy Alexandra de Graeve, age 13, New York.\n\nWhen affirmative action was struck down, the New York Times interviewed a bunch of high school students. Connor, from St. Peter High School in Minnesota, said, âI like the idea of having diverse campuses but not at the expense of hard work. I think that everyone is equal so everyone should be treated equally and given the same opportunities. I believe that colleges should look more at the hard work put in by the students than at race.â\n\nI donât completely disagree or agree with Connor. I agree that everyone should be treated the same way and given the same opportunities, and that colleges should reward hard work. But not everyone gets the same opportunities, which diminishes diversity on campuses. Black students often attend poorly-equipped elementary, middle or high schools. This causes Black students who need help to not get any, which makes it more difficult for them to get into elite colleges. The question is, what should we do to change this for the better? Affirmative action was a controversial solution, but it did help marginalized students have a better chance at getting into good colleges, and on June 29, 2023 the U.S. Supreme Court ended it.\n\nAffirmative action tried to help historically marginalized groups have better chances at getting into good colleges. According to NPR (National Public Radio), when the Supreme Court ended affirmative action, it ended â…the ability of colleges and universitiesâpublic and privateâto do what most say they needed to do: consider race as one of the many factors in deciding which of the qualified applicants should be admitted.â Unfortunately, lots of people thought that students with lower scores would get into schools over students with higher scores. But, the truth is, if two students had the same SAT scores and the same quality for their essay, affirmative action let colleges pick the student from a marginalized group.\n\nA student named Hamid from Glenbard West High School in Illinois said, affirmative action ââ¦is not picking a minority student over a white student simply on the basis of race. Affirmative action literally means âthe practice or policy of favoring individuals belonging to groups regarded as disadvantaged or subject to discrimination, over similarly qualified non-minority individuals.â The idea wasnât to disadvantage privileged kids, but help less privileged ones. This was important because it would start a chain reaction, allowing less wealthy students to get better jobs, which would also help their kids do better, and their kidâs kids do better because they would have more opportunities.\n\nEnding Affirmative action was a controversial decision. NPRÂ said, âIndeed, the reality is that in those places where affirmative action has been eliminated, there has been a severe drop in minority, and particularly, African American, admissions.â In its job of increasing diversity at schools, it worked. Affirmative action let more minorities into colleges. But even with it, there was still a severe wealth gap in marginalized groups. Without it, the wealth gap will grow again. Speaking to the NY Times, Amalia, a student at RFHS in Colorado, said, âIncreasing diversity in schools, jobs, and major positions of power starts in colleges. So we need to include race in college applications.â We need more diversity among powerful people. We canât have a congress that only has white and/or rich people in it. While Amalia is right, we also need to consider education at every level. It helps to get into a good college if you go to a good high school; it helps to get into a good high school if you go to a good middle school; it helps to get into a good middle school if you go to a good elementary school; it helps to get into a good elementary school if you go to a good preschool. Itâs important to have access to quality education at every stage. Even when youâre really young.\n\nTo help students from marginalized groups access higher education we need more than just affirmative action. Tobz, of Baker High School said, âNow, of course, ideally, we wouldnât need affirmative action. It probably isnât even that effective at curbing racial biases and inequalities due to how limited its application would be. But itâs not a negative for anyone, and it has a reasonable and logical justification for existing.â While affirmative action is helpful, it isnât going to change everything. We need more than that. To do well in school, you need accessible teachers, healthcare, a supportive family, food, and a home. Snacks, living close to school, having someone at home to help you, and extra curricular activities are all also very helpful. The government should make sure everyone has what they need to have a good education.\n\nContrary to what Connor believes, diversity isnât just going to happen. There are too many things working against people from marginalized groups. For a while, some members of historically marginalized groups had better chances of getting into colleges because of affirmative action. Thatâs why the Supreme Courtâs decision to end it was highly controversial. The truth is, affirmative action was a step in the right direction, but it was not enough. Now that itâs gone, we need to share our resources much more equitably so that everyone has access to a good education.\n\nâAlexandra de Graeve, age 13, grade 7, New York. âI live in New York City but both my parents come from Europe. I speak English and Dutch, and I am taking French and Latin at my school. I donât know what I want to be when Iâm older, but I want math to be a part of it. I was annoyed at my English teacher for talking about affirmative action in a careless way, and so I researched it to find out more.â"
