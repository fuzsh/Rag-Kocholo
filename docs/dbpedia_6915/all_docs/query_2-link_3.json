        "text": "Why Aren’t We?\n\nBy Henry Bakos, H.S. Junior, Washington\n\nThere are an uncountable number of things I should be doing.\n\nThis very instant.\n\nThe should-beâs of\n\nworking on late homework,\n\nresponding to friends,\n\nthinking of my futureâ¦\n\nBut am I?\n\nNo. And I’m pretty sure Iâm not the only one.\n\nHow many late math papers,\n\nwaiting friends, unplanned futures\n\ndo you think are out there? Why?\n\nThe mass of problems plague this world,\n\nclimate change, racism, homophobia, misogyny,\n\nand the fact that kids are being slaughtered.\n\nBy their own classmates.\n\nWhy is nobody else climbing this bloody hill\n\nto take down this monument of debt, death and deceit?\n\nThese things should be universally abhorrent,\n\nthey should be struck down the moment their ugly head\n\nemerges from their loathsome den.\n\nIâm just a White boy\n\nwho checks almost every box for privilege,\n\nwho hasn’t seen half of the atrocities that ravage our world.\n\nCompared to many I live in a small, safe haven\n\nthat sure has its issues but what doesnât, right?\n\nI live shielded\n\nin a society that covers up the very thing Iâm being shielded from,\n\nletting me ignore the beast\n\nthat ravenously takes black men\n\nand imprisons them.\n\nOr the ghoul that makes women watch over their shoulders\n\nevery time they leave their house.\n\nOr the fiend whispering in Asian student’s ears,\n\nmaking them feel worthless\n\nwhen not living up to the stereotypes that plague them.\n\nBecause of who I am,\n\nwho I was born to,\n\nwho I wish to be,\n\nI have not had to experience these,\n\nonly watch from out the window.\n\nAnd even then, I know things must change.\n\nWhy does it seem that\n\nnot one person\n\nseems to be sucked into this endless vortex,\n\nthis gyre of problems,\n\nthat seems to conquer anything foolish enough to approach it?\n\nBut wait.\n\nMaybe that’s the problem.\n\nMaybe nobody is willing to sail into this whirlpool\n\nfor fear they will be sucked down\n\nand have left no more impact than a small wake that quickly fades\n\ntoo fast for anyone to even realize it was ever there.\n\nBut surely it can’t swallow us all.\n\nSurely if we just tried hard enough,\n\nif we were smart enough,\n\nand if we read the wind,\n\nwe should be able to find a path through it,\n\nand get to the beautiful warm shallows\n\nwhere we find nothing but a cool breeze\n\nand the water is so still that\n\nthere is not even a pull of the tides.\n\nâHenry Bakos, High School Junior, Washington.Â\n\nThe World Environment Day, June 5\n\nGreetings! We wish you all a very happy World Environment Day, being observed today (5 June 2024) around the world with the theme of Land restoration, desertification and drought resilience.\n\nWorld Environment Day is one of the biggest international day for remembering our relationship to the environment. Led by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP),Â and held annually since 1973, itÂ has grown to be the largest global platform for environmental outreach (similar to the Earth Day that has been observed in the United States since 22 April 1970). It is celebrated by millions of people across the world.\n\nEarly this morning, as I began my day, I ventured out in our backyard garden, nibbled on a handful of berries that had ripened, and looked at how the garden was doing in the warm, late spring weather. Then later while I bicycled to work, I enjoyed the clean air that I breathed in and appreciated the shrubs and trees that enlivened my way to work. This daily, relaxed way of commuting to work gives me some time to think on what I need to focus on at work and to plan my day to achieve the needed tasks.\n\nWithout the natural environment (aka biosphere) that makes life on our precious Earth possible, we simply canât exist. We owe Mother Nature our immense gratitude for this lifetime of opportunity to experience the incredible beauty and complexity of life.\n\nLet us do everything humanly possible to keep the biosphere intact. Letâs appreciate what nature has sustained for millions of years. Human life has been around for just a small fraction of that time. True, with our intelligence and industry, we are able to alter the natural conditions in our surroundings for our temporary pleasures. And that is a big problem! We donât see the long-term impact of what our technology and industry, economic and political systems, and greedy ways are able to do.\n\nLand restoration is a key pillar of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030), a rallying call for the protection and revival of ecosystems all around the world, whichÂ is critical to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Visit the World Environment Day website.\n\nAs we observe the World Environment Day, I would like to leave you with some images I carry with me on my cellphone. Whenever I look at them, I remember my immersions in natureâbe it working in the garden, camping, hiking, and wandering through the woods, rafting in a river, kayaking in a quiet lake, or feeling tiny in the vicinity of the Pacific Oceanâthat these moments represent.\n\nWhispers in the Waves\n\nBy Ella Schott, h. s. junior, Connecticut\n\nWhen she first arrived in the small town, she realized how much quieter life was on this side of the world. Everything moved slower in a village that was cradled by the ocean, rocked to sleep every night by its gentle lull. There was a rhythm to life in a world so remote from everything that moves to tick of a stopwatch. Milliseconds and seconds dividing up the days until life is fragmented, shattered by time. To some it is a mosaic, but others canât swallow the shards.\n\nFew nervous tics remained with her, the scratching at her ears, rubbing of her eyes, clicking of her fingernails. She could walk in silence without the need for a drone in her ears. When she first found herself able to exist in the silence, she was brought to tears. Â\n\nOne afternoon she wandered down to the shore, stripped off her sandals and made her way into the open arms of the ocean. Â\n\nSince she was a little girl, and her family first visited the ocean, she could hear the waves calling to her. She had lived by a beach, but this was the real ocean, not one gripped by land. Â\n\nDancing with the waves, back and forth, the foam playing at her feet. Finally, she gave in, picking up her skirt and running full force against the waves. When she was little her mother would try to hold her hand, pull her away from the rapture of the waves. Her mother would explain that one should wait until the waves receded, then dash for deeper water. But she always plunged in just when she knew she might be knocked down, when the sea was beckoning to her with curling foam.\n\nShe reveled in the thump of the wave against her torso. A few more steps and she dove under the wave, eyes pressed tightly together. When she emerged, she could float on her back on waves that were yet to be born. Â\n\nLying there, she watched the sun crisp the tops of the waves, closing her eyes every so often. The ocean wrapped its soothing fingers around her. Â\n\nI wish I could lay here forever. Â\n\nâCaecilia (Ella) Schott, high school junior, Connecticut. She writes:\n\nâI am an avid writer. My cultural background is German and Norwegian, but my family has been in America for a long time. I speak English and recently earned my seal of bi-literacy in French for speaking, reading, and writingâ¦ I find comfort and companionship in animals. I also foster cats, and volunteer at my local pet store. My dream is to become a professor of English and History.Â I was inspired to write this short story by my own connection with nature, and fear of losing it.â\n\nEducational Struggles in Latin America\n\nBy Camila Ayala, age 17, Georgia\n\nâI spent much of my childhood in Honduras, where I was able to observe firsthand the disregard for children’s education. Children without the means to pay for tuition were not assured of a quality education. Later, I was fortunate enough to move to the United States. Nevertheless, when a family member who works as a teacher in Honduras begged my family for school supplies for the children she teaches, I was moved to revisit this harrowing subject. She mentioned the number of children who don’t even have notebooks or pencils. These children also had difficulty traveling to school, and once they were there, they were not provided with the necessary amenities, such as air conditioning in the classrooms to deal with Honduran intense heat. I was astounded at how little thought was given to obtaining the right materials for these young students, and how the teachers were forced to seek assistance because they were not receiving any. My awareness of the severity of the issue has increased as a result of these first-hand encounters, which is why I feel compelled to discuss it and perhaps help others see how serious it is.â\n\nIn America, the majority of children eagerly await their summer break. They look forward to living in June and July, when there are no obligations related to school. These children enjoy those months as they are unaware of the privileges of the months that come before June and July. These formative months are filled with possibilities for education.\n\nIn contrast, according to Latin America Resource & Training Center (2023), only about 46.8% of children in Latin America are thought to have completed their high school education, compared to 86.7% in the United States. Moreover, approximately 50% of Mexicans, Colombians and Brazilians do not have the skills necessary to solve simple math equations or to explain basic scientific phenomena. They are not granted the same benefits as the children who look forward to summer vacation, the same children who possess something so precious that appears to be a burden to them: an education. Due to their poverty and the lack of government support for these issues, these kids are unable to receive the fundamental right to an education. Additionally, for those that do, the challenges of poverty resurface, forcing them to drop out of school and find employment abruptly in an attempt to support their afflicted family.\n\nThe ability to receive a quality education creates a clear divide between the rich and the poor in Latin America. Identity, background, and ability determine educational opportunities for many of these children. According to the Global Education Monitoring Report, “In Panama, 21% of indigenous males aged 20 to 24 had completed secondary school, compared with 61% of their non-indigenous peers, in 2016. In Paraguay and Honduras, 32% of indigenous people are illiterate. Afro-descendants were 14% less likely in Peru and 24% less likely in Uruguay than non-Afro-descendants to complete secondary education in 2015. On average, 12-to 17-year-olds with disabilities were 10 percentage points less likely to attend school than those without disabilities.â These unfortunate children on the other side of the border struggle with discrimination in their education, which leads them to not qualify for prosperous jobs in the future. In a report published by the World Bank it was determined that the completion rates of lower-secondary school are lower for boys than for girls in most Latin American and Caribbean countries. All these factors contribute to children remaining in poverty, unable to access proper education, and subsequently as adults, they bring up children who also face similar struggles, thus continuing the cycle of poverty. Additionally, the World Bank in Latin America and the Caribbean (2023) states that Latin America was the area most severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused many school closures.\n\nIt is still challenging to offer these students the education they need and return to normalcy following COVID as a result of the lack of resources in most Latin American countries. Even the kids who are lucky enough to attend school frequently struggle to get enough supplies. In several countries, buying school supplies is not a yearly ritual, and many children are lucky to own a book-bag at all. For these kids, going to school is a hardship in every way, including getting the materials they need for the entire school day.\n\nFinding qualified educators to instruct these receptive minds also becomes difficult, particularly in underprivileged areas where a large proportion of the people lack the necessary skills. Furthermore, children’s transit to the schools is often troublesome due to the rural seclusion in some areas. A report by UNESCO highlighted that “while nearly all children living in urban areas eventually enter the education system, the problem of lack of access to primary education is much greater for those living in the more impoverished rural areas.â Families often find themselves contributing to the truancy of the children, as the students oftentimes forgo attending school altogether due to the familyâs inability or stagnation in their efforts. I have seen first hand that often the rural communities are less developed and therefore more impoverished. By giving more focus and resources to something thatâs so important, many of these problems could possibly be mitigated over time. These children are their most valuable resource, yet they arenât receiving the education needed to succeed in life and improve the communities in which they live.\n\nMuch of this could be improved by making efforts to fund school infrastructures and guarantee an equitable resource distribution. Everyone should be able to learn, regardless of their financial situation, so more efforts should be made to support children from low-income families and to provide them with high-quality education and whatever flexibility they may require. In order to help these children as well as themselves, the governments of Latin America should take a more serious approach to the problem of inadequate education. After all, as more people receive adequate education, more prosperity will be brought to these nations.\n\nThe education of these young people deserves international investments, and even though we reside far from them, we can still contribute by supporting educational initiatives financially and in other ways. Individuals possessing financial resources and power ought to think about investing in something truly worthwhile. Even though going to school can be stressful, knowledge and growth serve as the cornerstone for all future endeavors, and when these things are denied to you, your lifeâs foundation begins to splinter. We ought to remain strongly committed to education for all because itâs not always a given and those who understand its value should do their part to assist the unlucky ones around the world who lack it.\n\nBy Camila Ayala, age 17, Georgia.

Discovering a passion for writing, she dreams of becoming a lawyer to help those in need. Her future is guided by a desire to advocate for justice and compassion.\n\nReferences:\n\nThe World Bank in Latin America and the Caribbean (2023).

Photo: Mel Bankoff, Oregon.\n\nEarth Day Greetings!\n\nAs I bicycled to work this cool, breezy spring morning in the Pacific Northwest, I admired the many new shoots reaching for the sun, and spring flowers seeking bees and other insects along the bike trail and sidewalks. I vividly recalled my childhood in central India. We lived in an apartment building right in the middle of downtown in the city of Indore. There was no room for any backyard gardens. But we had a very small windowsill garden space for a couple of pots. I remember the excitement I felt as the garbanzo bean plants grew new leaves or when those beautiful red flowers appeared on another potted plant.\n\nAlmost Everything in the Garden is Growing Vibrantly.Â Photo: Arun N. TokÃ©\n\nWe have been enjoying spring flowers in our garden, and harvesting arugula, fennel shoots, green onions, etc. Apple trees and various berries are doing their usual spring growth with a promise of bountiful fruit harvest! And, various nature hikes in the area fill our hearts with a sense of appreciation and gratitude to Mother Nature.\n\nWhile many of us might be looking forward to visiting some special wonders of nature during school break this yearâDenali, Yellowstone, Grand Canyon, Grand Titon, Redwoods or another beautiful placeâlike the Horseshoe Bend in Arizona, let us not forget that natural beauty can be found all around us, even in our backyard!\n\nYet, I must share my deep sadness with you. Everyday, I am feeling the pain of countless children, mothers and fathers in places like the Gaza, Sudan, and Ukraine, where wars, climate change and droughts make living conditions dire for tens of millions. The military operations and environmental destruction responsible for human suffering go on unabated. Governments, including ours, are unresponsive to the needs of innocent, civilian victims. The human rights of millions of children, women and men are being violated. They are forced to live in subhuman conditions. Even in our own cities all across this so-called rich nation, countless homeless men and women live in less than desirable conditions. We are told there is no money for social programs, as the government spends close to a trillion dollars on feeding the war machines.\n\nSkipping Stones, like any other socially responsible media outlet, has often shed light on the plight of suffering humanity around the world. While we donât want to forget this pain and suffering, we also donât want our readers to get depressed by the doom and gloom thatâs all around us.\n\nThe list of issues we can and must face is long. It includes our ever-increasing use of plastics and forever-chemicals, the decimation of insect and bird populations, the climate change, disappearing glaciers, deforestation and destruction of natural habitats, over-fishing and overgrazing, mindless mining of fossil fuels, environmental pollution, groundwater contamination, land-use issues, nuclear weapons, environmental and social justice, and homelessness, poverty and hunger. You can add many more items to this listâboth of local concern and global importance!\n\nOur future survival and flourishing depends on how we respond to these problems we have created with our ever-increasing consumption of resources, economic systems, greed, privatization and exploitation of resources, for example.\n\nYou might like to ask yourself a few deep questions (see some examples below) and try to answer them honestly and at length:\n\nWhat do we love about where we live?\n\nHow can we make a difference right where we are planted, in our communities?\n\nHow can we let Mother Earth know how much we love her?\n\nWhat might we cultivate in our own backyard?\n\nHow can we help out our neighbors?\n\nWhat small thing might we do today to heal the world and ourselves?\n\nWhat is happiness?\n\nWhat makes us really happyâhappiness that might last for a really long while?\n\nHow much of material consumption is sufficient or plenty for our happiness?\n\nWhat is the law of diminishing returns?\n\nWhat is the difference between needs and wants?\n\nAnd as a group of friends or community, we might ask:\n\nCan an economy based on ever-increasing growth be sustained?Â\n\nCan we continue to use natural resources in an uncontrolled manner?\n\nWhat can we as a community or society do to minimize our negative impact on nature?\n\nAs conscientious citizen and human beings, how can we respond constructively?\n\nLet us not abuse the gifts we have been granted by Mother Nature. Let us not knowingly degrade or destroy the very web of life of which we are an integral part. Human life cannot continue without this web of lifeâour biosphere. As âintelligentâ species, we must address these issues that we have created collectively since industrialization.\n\nLet us make an effort to appreciate the beauty around us, as we work to address these adversities. Letâs respect the many miracles of nature that surround us. Let us learn to enjoy even the smallest gifts that we receive everyday, be it listening to a bird song, fluttering of a butterfly or hummingbird, observing a cluster of green leaves or the multitude of seeds and fruits that plants produce.\n\nLet us be grateful for the many blessings we have been granted. Let us live fully and let nature liveâin all its glory! Let us commit ourselves to doing what we can to sustain these blessings, this beauty, for all future generations.\n\nDear fellow earthlings, let’s remember that Earth Day is not just April 22nd; we can observe it each and every day.\n\nâArun Narayan TokÃ©, Skipping Stones editor.\n\nName the Past for Our Future:\n\nOn the Armenian Genocide\n\nBy Laurel Aronian, age 17, Connecticut.\n\nIn 1915, the Armenian Genocide commencedâthe systematic mass murder of 1.5 million Armenians by the Ottoman government. I wrote this poem as a representation of the ongoing effects of the genocide on Armenians; even survivors found their lives uprooted as they were forced to move to other countries and begin from nothing. This poem not only serves to comment on my ancestorsâ abrupt relocation from their homeland but also as a reflection on how my opportunity to visit Armenia in 2019 allowed me to return to the place my ancestors unwillingly left behindâmetaphorically restoring them to their native land and simultaneously instilling in me an appreciation for a culture and history that I will carry forward.Â\n\nâThe Land Aheadâ\n\nSoot swirls around our footsteps,\n\nthe dust from our lives before.\n\nBefore, when we lived in the stonyÂ\n\ncliffs of the Caucasus.\n\nWith my family who sent me\n\non my own.\n\nTo start a new life.\n\nA life away from those who had takenÂ\n\nit from us.\n\nThe land that my family had livedÂ\n\non for hundreds of years was seized.\n\nBitlis, Diyarbekir, Erzurum, where I had\n\nplayed in the long grass of the mountains with my brothers.\n\nLuck is what saved me from the massacres.\n\nI do not knowÂ\n\nwhat happened to my brothers,\n\nwho I had left\n\nbehind me.\n\nThe rocky road ahead is also littered\n\nwith dust.\n\nIt obscures my vision on all sides.Â\n\nI do not know what is ahead of me\n\nor what I have left behind.\n\nThe smell of gasoline is strong\n\nas I board the plane.Â\n\nI have left my home for the flight,\n\nbut will return in a jetÂ\n\nmoving as swift as an Eagle.\n\nThe sign above is in letters\n\nI canât read\n\nÔ¹Õ¼Õ«Õ¹Ö Õ¤Õ¥ÕºÕ« ÕÕ¡ÕµÕ¡Õ½Õ¿Õ¡Õ¶ Õ¿Õ¥ÖÕ´Õ«Õ¶Õ¡Õ¬ 4A\n\nOnly one word is clear to me,\n\nÕÕ¡ÕµÕ¡Õ½Õ¿Õ¡Õ¶, Hayastan, where myÂ\n\nsecond great-grandfather is fromÂ\n\nand where IÂ\n\nam going.\n\nBack in his day,Â\n\nthere were no planes,\n\nwhen he traveled to the US\n\nAlone.\n\nDid he know that hisÂ\n\ngreat, great-granddaughter would be going to his homeland?\n\nHis homeland where he had to leave\n\nhis home.\n\nHe left his country in the hope\n\nthat one dayÂ\n\nthe part of him in meÂ\n\ncould return.\n\nBy Laurel Aronian, age 17, Connecticut. She adds: âI love to write in all genres (poetry, prose, journalism). I also enjoy taking photos and creating art. I have a passion for music and perform as a singer-songwriter and accompany on guitar. When I’m not writing or making music, I play competitive chess. My pieces also reflect the awe of nature, earth stewardship, and our planet’s majesty and magic.â\n\nPS: Laurel entered the poem for our 2023 Youth Honor Awards last year at the age of 16.\n\nArt in the Time of War:Â The Children of Zaporizhzhia\n\nBy Svitlana Budzhak-Jones, President, Sisterâs Sister, Inc.\n\nThe unprovoked, brutal war against Ukraine sadly has entered its third year. It has brought much destruction and sorrow to the people of Ukraine. Millions were displaced internally. Millions became refugees elsewhere in the world. Countless Ukrainian children have lost their homes, have difficulties in accessing education, health care and even basic necessities such as drinking water. Bomb shelters and cellars have replaced their rooms, metro benches have become their beds, and air raid sirens on a daily basis drone instead of school bells. While many Ukrainian men and women actively fight on the battlefield for their country, culture and independence, others stay dedicated to the children who remain in Ukraine.\n\nThe Central Southern city of Zaporizhzhia is under constant artillery shelling and aerial bombing. But the Center for Childrenâs and Youth Creativity in the city continues to operate, and attempts to create a safe space to safeguard the childrenâs childhood. The Gradient creative Computer Design Circle at the Center has not closed its doors even when its teacher Ms. Nadiya Chepiga was forced to flee Ukraine to Poland in the first months of heavy enemy assaults on the city. Ms. Chepiga then continued to work with her students online for the entire year before returning back to her home city and to her students.\n\nThe Gradient Circle is now in its thirteenth year of operation. Hundreds of children between the ages of 6 and 17 have learned to create beautiful art there and connect with their inner spirit, bringing them one step closer to becoming professional graphic designers and artists. The Circle creates a comfortable environment for shaping children’s creative abilities, meeting their individual needs for intellectual, moral, aesthetic, and creative development, shaping a culture that includes a healthy lifestyle and organizing their free time. The children learn the principles of drawing art objects, creating drawings and 3D images, acquiring skills in making artwork in various media and styles, learning the basics of graphic design, creating postcards, posters, calendars, and memorabilia. The children search for their individual style of work and aesthetic preferences, develop their creative imagination and fantasy, learn to take creative initiative, and develop their independence.\n\nThe Circleâs founding director and teacher Nadiya Chepiga is a creative artist herself, who has implemented numerous creative projects with her students, has helped them realize their creative vision and brought them to life, and trained hundreds of creative individuals. Despite the ongoing war, the students and their teacher continue participating in various nationwide Ukrainian and International competitions as well as in art exhibitions.\n\nLife goes on even in the extremely challenging circumstances created by the war. The students and their teacher continue meeting twice per week. Frequently, instruction needs to be done online because of constant air raid warnings. But on Sundays, the students try to meet with their teacher in person in the Center. And if an air raid siren goes off, they seek cover in the basement (see below) or in corridors where they continue their lessons. Since the enemy missiles and bombs focus on destroying power plants, there is usually no heat, and the students wear winter coats and jackets during their lessons. Yet they enjoy their meetings and continue creating beautiful, original works of art.\n\nFifteen of their art creations were exhibited by the humanitarian aid organization Sisterâs Sister (www.SistersSister.org) in State College, Pennsylvania on March 23, 2024 during a benefit concert for Ukraine. Sisterâs Sister provides humanitarian support to the Ukrainian people, particularly to children, hospitals, orphanages, and the disabled in Ukraine, including State Collegeâs sister city, Nizhyn, located in the Chernihiv region. The artwork exhibited at the concert was created by the students and enhanced with computer graphics under the supervision and guidance of their teacher. Their work draws, in part, on Ukrainian art, famous for its folk traditions and exquisite embroidery, the red and black threads of which represent happiness and sorrow. Sadly, there is too much of the black threads of sorrow in these difficult times for the children of Ukraine, while Nadiya Chepiga, whose first name means âhope,â brings hope to the children of Zaporizhzhia through art.

(www.SistersSister.org)Â\n\nAffirmative Action Was Never Enough\n\nBy Alexandra de Graeve, age 13, New York.\n\nWhen affirmative action was struck down, the New York Times interviewed a bunch of high school students. Connor, from St. Peter High School in Minnesota, said, âI like the idea of having diverse campuses but not at the expense of hard work. I think that everyone is equal so everyone should be treated equally and given the same opportunities. I believe that colleges should look more at the hard work put in by the students than at race.â\n\nI donât completely disagree or agree with Connor. I agree that everyone should be treated the same way and given the same opportunities, and that colleges should reward hard work. But not everyone gets the same opportunities, which diminishes diversity on campuses. Black students often attend poorly-equipped elementary, middle or high schools. This causes Black students who need help to not get any, which makes it more difficult for them to get into elite colleges. The question is, what should we do to change this for the better? Affirmative action was a controversial solution, but it did help marginalized students have a better chance at getting into good colleges, and on June 29, 2023 the U.S. Supreme Court ended it.\n\nAffirmative action tried to help historically marginalized groups have better chances at getting into good colleges. According to NPR (National Public Radio), when the Supreme Court ended affirmative action, it ended â…the ability of colleges and universitiesâpublic and privateâto do what most say they needed to do: consider race as one of the many factors in deciding which of the qualified applicants should be admitted.â Unfortunately, lots of people thought that students with lower scores would get into schools over students with higher scores. But, the truth is, if two students had the same SAT scores and the same quality for their essay, affirmative action let colleges pick the student from a marginalized group.\n\nA student named Hamid from Glenbard West High School in Illinois said, affirmative action ââ¦is not picking a minority student over a white student simply on the basis of race. Affirmative action literally means âthe practice or policy of favoring individuals belonging to groups regarded as disadvantaged or subject to discrimination, over similarly qualified non-minority individuals.â The idea wasnât to disadvantage privileged kids, but help less privileged ones. This was important because it would start a chain reaction, allowing less wealthy students to get better jobs, which would also help their kids do better, and their kidâs kids do better because they would have more opportunities.\n\nEnding Affirmative action was a controversial decision. NPRÂ said, âIndeed, the reality is that in those places where affirmative action has been eliminated, there has been a severe drop in minority, and particularly, African American, admissions.â In its job of increasing diversity at schools, it worked. Affirmative action let more minorities into colleges. But even with it, there was still a severe wealth gap in marginalized groups. Without it, the wealth gap will grow again. Speaking to the NY Times, Amalia, a student at RFHS in Colorado, said, âIncreasing diversity in schools, jobs, and major positions of power starts in colleges. So we need to include race in college applications.â We need more diversity among powerful people. We canât have a congress that only has white and/or rich people in it. While Amalia is right, we also need to consider education at every level. It helps to get into a good college if you go to a good high school; it helps to get into a good high school if you go to a good middle school; it helps to get into a good middle school if you go to a good elementary school; it helps to get into a good elementary school if you go to a good preschool. Itâs important to have access to quality education at every stage. Even when youâre really young.\n\nTo help students from marginalized groups access higher education we need more than just affirmative action. Tobz, of Baker High School said, âNow, of course, ideally, we wouldnât need affirmative action. It probably isnât even that effective at curbing racial biases and inequalities due to how limited its application would be. But itâs not a negative for anyone, and it has a reasonable and logical justification for existing.â While affirmative action is helpful, it isnât going to change everything. We need more than that. To do well in school, you need accessible teachers, healthcare, a supportive family, food, and a home. Snacks, living close to school, having someone at home to help you, and extra curricular activities are all also very helpful. The government should make sure everyone has what they need to have a good education.\n\nContrary to what Connor believes, diversity isnât just going to happen. There are too many things working against people from marginalized groups. For a while, some members of historically marginalized groups had better chances of getting into colleges because of affirmative action. Thatâs why the Supreme Courtâs decision to end it was highly controversial. The truth is, affirmative action was a step in the right direction, but it was not enough. Now that itâs gone, we need to share our resources much more equitably so that everyone has access to a good education.\n\nâAlexandra de Graeve, age 13, grade 7, New York. âI live in New York City but both my parents come from Europe. I speak English and Dutch, and I am taking French and Latin at my school. I donât know what I want to be when Iâm older, but I want math to be a part of it. I was annoyed at my English teacher for talking about affirmative action in a careless way, and so I researched it to find out more.â"
