        "text": "I’ve often written about popular representations of faeries, and how they may shape our perceptions and expectations. Postal communications were extremely popular, cheap (and fast) in Victorian and Edwardian England and were a major medium by which people became familiar with art of various types. Cards might bear reproductions of famous ‘old masters,’ they might feature an engraving of the latest sensation from the Royal Academy (a new painting by Millais for instance) or they might offer ‘popular art’. One of the major publishers of postcards and greetings cards was Raphael Tuck, and it’s informative to look at how they chose to depict supernatural beings for sale to a mass market. It seems very clear from many of these designs that the assumption was that these cards would be bought by or for children.\n\nFaeries & Elves\n\nEstablished artists were often employed to design cards. Hence we find a Christmas elf carrying mistletoe by Mabel Lucie Atwell (head of page) and a set of three cards by prolific faery painter Agnes Richardson which very much play up the cute, cuddly side of the faeries’ (presumed) nature- see the girlie faeries and bunnies below. Richardson also supplied Tuck with some Christmas faeries in fetching furry onesies (1923)- or fluttering naked in the snow in 1925 (see below). Two tiny, naked winged beings helped to celebrate Easter with a little girl in 1917 and, on a birthday card from the ‘Once Upon a Time’ series, issued in 1930, the faes teach a little girl to tell the time with dandelion clocks (see above). We also find the faes playing ping-pong across a toadstool in 1903 and, in a set of cards from 1909, symbolising the four seasons as painfully cute little girls.\n\nFred Spurgin in 1942 carried the big-eyed little cutie theme to a distressingly saccharine conclusion with a set of six cards plainly designed for lovers’ messages during war time. There was doubtless demand for them, but… A stark contrast is a set of faery Valentine cards from 1902, which give the impression that the images are in 3D relief on the background, rather like Wedgwood ware. The messages are, naturally, sentimental, but nowhere near as mawkish as those written for Spurgin’s images.\n\nFlower Fairies\n\nA series of six cards issued in 1902 aspired for something rather more aesthetic, matching ‘fairy ladies’ with quotations from poets such as Rossetti, Swinburne, William Morris, Goethe and others. These were evidently designed for a more adult audience- those who liked to consider themselves cultured too. Similar were some other ‘flower fairies’ issued in the same year- tall women seen with blossoms. Another set of four cards, issued in 1911, paired young faery girls in transparent gowns with flowers to celebrate Easter (see below). Small girl faeries were also matched with bowls of flowers, butterflies and birds by the obscure American commercial artist, Ellen Hattie Clapsaddle (1865-1934), for a set of cards bearing sentimental messages to loved ones in a set from 1902.\n\nSexy Sprites\n\nThings got rather saucier (and arguably more authentic in folklore terms) in a set of six very striking cards designed by Alice Marshall from 1924. The faery females illustrated may be tiny, but they know what they want… There was a good deal of cavorting going on in the countryside in this series- plus the appearance of a small faun (or Pan)- some might say a sure sign of wantonness, despite the otherwise bland and conventional settings\n\nNeedless to observe, probably, but the Faery depicted on these postcards is very far from the perilous and cruel place known from British tradition. The worst accusations that might be levelled against them is that the faeries get a bit randy or a bit maudlin from time to time.\n\nBrownies\n\nThere are brownies, but not as we know them. In the ‘Brownie Family’ set of 1909 they are seen celebrating Christmas- shopping, admiring the tree, hanging up their stockings, opening presents, singing carols and eating Christmas pudding. The hitherto unknown ‘Easter Brownies’ cultivate the flowers and bring seasonal greetings. The explicit link between faery kind and human religious festivals made obvious commercial sense for Raphael Tuck and other such companies, but makes a nonsense of the traditional antipathy of faeries for all things linked to the Christian faith.\n\nGnomes\n\nI have described before how ‘gnome‘ is an invented word, unknown before the sixteenth century, but one which has steadily come to parallel or displace the older term ‘dwarf.’ In the British Isles, though, dwarves are absent. Hence, Germanic influence had plainly prevailed in the Christmas cards featuring gnomes that were offered for sale in 1903-1904; note in the example above that the gnomes are enjoying themselves in the proximity of an illuminated church. Although they were not a native British species, the Scandinavian nisse and tomte appeared on our cards, perhaps slightly mystifying the English public- not least when the little man was depicted painting a pig (?) with Irish shamrocks. This seems to be some even stranger hybrid of the gnome and the lucky Irish leprechaun.\n\nIt may be the case that the continental influences that began to dilute and confuse British traditions derive as much from these cards as from, say, Perrault’s fairy tales, the work of the Grimm brothers, or Thomas Keightley’s comprehensive study of the Fairy Mythology across Europe and the wider world. Firms like Raphael Tuck had much of their engraving and printing work undertaken by German suppliers before the First World War and this connection may help to explain some of the German gnomes and Swedish tomten.\n\nMermaids\n\nThree cards published by Tuck in 1908 illustrated mermaids in very typical poses- lying or sitting on rocks admiring their shells and jewels, interacting with other wildlife, or playing music. Probably the most interesting feature of these depictions is the artist’s decision to give the mermaids two scaled legs, rather than a single fish tail. A 1904 series, illustrating scenes from Wagner’s Ring Cycle, also made the Rhine Maidens into two legged mermaids.\n\nA card from 1933, part of a series ‘Fun at the Seaside’ went for a more conventional mermaid, with a single tail- in this case, a merchild meeting some human infants playing on the beach.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nEvidently, these cards cannot be relied upon as any sort of guide to British faery traditions. They are, however, highly instructive as to the process of change in popular views of the faes. As I have discussed in other posts, books like Peter Pan and The Water Babies, and designs such as Cicely Mary Barker’s ‘Flower Fairies‘ were very powerful in shaping the modern image of the faery. These postcards drew upon, and reinforced, those trends- and, of course, they were often seen and absorbed by children from a young age.\n\nFor more on the role of art in shaping our ideas, see my Fairy Art of the Twentieth Century and The Modern Fairy Faith.\n\nIn a number of previous posts, I’ve tackled the idea of faeries as spirits of place, genii loci, trying to define their intimate links to the British landscape. I can see how their characters and habits might be related to the environments they inhabit, but it feels more complex than that for me.\n\nDuring these postings I’ve made reference to one of my favourite artists, Paul Nash, whose work over many years tackled this issue of the meaning and spirit of the English landscape. He often identified particular ‘places’ that had special significance for him- such as Wittenham Clumps, which he painted repeatedly at the start and end of his career. He was keenly sensitive, too, to the character of places like Avebury, Maiden Castle and the Uffington White Horse- ancient sites that still carry their mystique and potency.\n\nI’m currently reading Nash’s autobiography, Outline, and this inevitably set me thinking again about the faeries as the ancient souls of the land. Nash could discover a ‘place‘ with detectable atmosphere even in the most busy and unlikely of locations, such as Kensington Gardens in central London. He describes playing there as a very young boy, “at a time before Barrie took over” (in other words, before Peter Pan became inseparably associated with the gardens). Nash then observes: “The place was not infested by fairies; you found them in just one special place, if you wanted them.” (Outline, chapter 1) Of course, others had detected a faery presence here before Nash- such as poet Thomas Tickell.\n\nSo, it seems that the meaningful place that young Paul sensed (somewhere between the Round Pond, the tea gardens and the Serpentine) was a spot that derived its uniqueness partly from the arrangement of the trees and the sense of secrecy, but also from a supernatural aura (if you were alive to it). It’s a sensitivity to atmosphere- except that I think the observer actively contributes to that by the knowledge that they bring.\n\nThe faeries seem never to have been too far from Nash’s vision of the countryside- at least, early in his life. In 1913 he drew a picture of strip lynchets on the Berkshire Downs, which he called Their Hill. As it happened, the owner of the land saw the picture at an exhibition and asked Nash the reason for the title. He replied “I felt it was the sort of hill which could not belong to anyone in particular, but to an ancient people or to the fairies, even.”\n\nDoubtless, being open to these sensations is important; you may need to have a certain mindset in the first place. Over and above that, though, I think the ‘spirit of place’ I’ve been trying to define, to put into words, amounts to this: the Britishness of British faeries in large measure derives from a sense of depth of time and connection. Whatever the nature of the initial experience(s) that linked a faery or elf or brownie to a particular site, what instils a tangible if elusive meaning are the accrued associations that have accumulated over subsequent centuries. These create a weight of significance, a resonance across generations, that has meaning and magic in itself (the story) as well as bestowing the sensation of connecting with previous believers. Over centuries, believers have responded to and shaped the landscape in light of its supernatural links and connotations- “This happened here to your predecessor.”\n\nWhat feels meaningful to me, therefore, is the awareness of the deep roots of the faery tradition, coupled with the consciousness that it is an inheritance- a shared perception passed down over ages of the interaction between place, incident and emotion.\n\nI suspect I’m still struggling to express adequately the combined power of landscape, meaning and myth, as it strikes me as a feeling, not a theory, that’s generated by certain locations. To understand my response, it helps for me to set faerylore alongside other national accounts, such as the ‘Matter of Britain’ (the Arthurian stories) and the legends of the Mabinogion. What these evoke is a sense of profound mystery- and romance; there’s an elusive contact with something very ancient, the meaning of which I can’t yet wholly grasp. That- vague as it sounds- is what ultimately underlies all the writing on this blog.\n\nFor further discussion, see my 2022 book The Spirits of the Land- Faeries and the Soul of Britain (Amazon/KDP):\n\nA recent book on modern paganism and fairy belief, Magic and Witchery in the Modern West (Feraro and White, 2019), suggested that many of the contemporary conceptions of fairies as planetary guardians and green protectors came not from age-old faery tradition but from books like Cicely Mary Barker’s flower fairies, books that adult pagans had seen as and absorbed as children. Is this really true? Is the view of faeries as green champions really so recent and untraditional a development?\n\nIn fact, there is a reasonable amount of evidence to indicate that faeries have been connected with nature conservation and environmental causes for a quite long time. For example, there is a widespread popular story of a woodcutter just about to fell a tree who is stopped by the appearance of a fairy being from beneath the ground. This is described as having happened as far apart in Britain as Northamptonshire and Nithsdale in the Scottish Borders. The idea of faeries as active defenders of the natural world was therefore accepted in folk belief from at least the start of the nineteenth century, a situation that was reflected in the literature of the time. In his 1810 poem Alice Brand, Sir Walter Scott had the elfin king demand:\n\n“Why sounds yon stroke on the beech and oak,\n\nOur moonlight circle’s screen,\n\nOr who comes here to chase the deer,\n\nBeloved of our Elfin Queen?”\n\nIn the ballad of Tam Lin, the young Tam appears to his lover-to-be, Janet, after she plucks a rose in the forest. He complains that she has taken the flower without his permission. Similarly, in the ballad Hynde Etin complaint is made by the fairy when nuts are picked, “For I’m the guardian of the wood/ and ye maun [must] let it be.” Whether this is environmental stewardship or cases of trespass on private land is not entirely clear, but the faeries are evidently highly protective of their natural resources. We might see those faeries that protect (human) orchards and nut groves, such as Owd Goggie, in a similar light.\n\nLastly, an article carried by the Welsh Western Mail in September 1878 described the industry that had brought prosperity to Nant y Glo and Blaenau, in Gwent, albeit at the cost of the local woodlands. The extensive tree-felling was dated back some ninety years to the time when ironworking first started in the area and demand for charcoal expanded steeply. Before then, we are told, the fairies had protected the trees of the hills and valleys thereabouts. These were yr tylwyth teg yn y coed, the fairies of the wood, who often used to be seen assembled under the female oaks there, and who guarded the trees and harmed those that felled them. Sadly, however, they couldn’t resist against the “inroads of a gross material civilisation” (as the writer called it, even then) and they were driven off west into less spoiled parts of the Principality. These sentiments might surprise us from a Victorian, but they demonstrate that environmental awareness, and a sense of the faeries’ role as eco-guardians, might not be that new.\n\nJacobean Precedents\n\nAs far back as the start of the seventeenth century, in fact, there is evidence of the fairies being seen as friends and protectors of wildlife and the natural world. Sir William Browne in Britannia’s Pastorals imagined the fairies\n\n“Teaching the little birds to build their nests,/ And in their singing how to keepen rests…”\n\nThe ‘eco-fairy’ as a concept is not new, therefore, even if the label is. An examination of the folklore and literary sources discloses three interrelated functions that the faes were believed to undertake: they cared for small mammals and birds; they had a special link with certain flowers and trees and, lastly, they assumed a more general supervisory role over the natural world, keeping it in balance and preventing over-exploitation and pollution.\n\nFairies’ Furry Friends\n\nFairies not only lived and played in the countryside- according to Victorian poetry they talked to the birds, taught them how to sing and kept their eggs warm in the nest by curling up to sleep beside them. Poet Rose Fyleman, famous for There’s a Fairy at the Bottom of my Garden, in her verse A Fairy Went A-Marketing, imagined how a fae might buy pet fish and birds and then set them free. For Fyleman, fairies and wildlife were best of friends, with robins serving as a page in the fairy court and tiny faes living contentedly in flowers.\n\nVerse and popular conceptions went hand in hand, as there are reported encounters with fairies helping birds find berries in the snow and looking after wildlife in wintry weather. Early Victorian child poet, Annie Isabella Brown, imagined fairies describing how:\n\n“We gathered flannel-mullen leaves,\n\nAgainst the winter’s cold;\n\nTo keep the little dormouse warm,\n\nWithin its hedgerow hold.”\n\nPoet Menella Bute Smedley also imagined the fairies “twisting threads of bloom and light” to make butterflies’ wings.\n\nFlower Fairies\n\nJust as there was active supernatural involvement with the animal kingdom, folk tradition identifies two aspects to the relationship between fairies and plants. They are attracted to certain herbs, whether supernaturally or for merely utilitarian reasons (foxgloves, for example, are called fairy gloves and fairy thimbles) and, secondly, the fairies are said inhabit certain trees, such as oaks, thorns and elders. It was a relatively easy transition from these associations to come up with the idea of flower fairies as popularised by artists Cicely Baker and Margaret Tarrant, but the foundations of this twentieth century phenomenon are much deeper and older (see Lewis Spence, British Fairy Tradition, pp.178-80).\n\nIt looks as though the first step towards the flower fairy idea was to emphasise the affinity between fairies and particular flowers. Next, it was an easy step to conceive of the spirits living in those flowers and the miniaturisation of the fairies popularised by Shakespeare and his contemporaries assisted with this. Inevitably, too, the fairy character began to be softened by association with bloom, scent and colour.\n\nThis change seems to have proceeded from the seventeenth century, judging by scattered indications in our literature. For instance, William Browne (1588-1643) in his verse The Rose imagined that “the nimble fairies by the pale-faced moon/ Water’d the root and kissed her pretty shade.” From the eighteenth century there is good literary evidence for the idea of fairies taking up residence in flowers. Coleridge, for example, described “Fays/ That sweetly nestle in the foxglove bells.” His contemporary George Darley imagined little fairies with scented wings emerging at night from blossoms and flitting from flower to flower enjoying nectar like wine (George Darley (1795-1846), What the Toys do at Night and The Elf Toper).\n\nBy the late nineteenth century this idea was exceedingly widespread: American poet Madison Julius Cawein repeatedly housed his fays in toadstools or in blooms and in his adult fairy tale, Phantastes, Scottish author George MacDonald described how “the flowers die because the fairies go away, not that the fairies disappear because the flowers die. The flowers seem a sort of house for them, or outer bodies, which they can put on and off when they please… you would see a strange resemblance, almost a oneness between the flower and the fairy… [but] whether all flowers have fairies, I cannot determine.” When J. M. Barrie adopted these ideas for Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens, he was simply making use of an already well-established idea- although the success of his books and plays took it to a much wider audience.\n\nConsequent upon inhabiting flowers, other connections were seen- for example, gardens become an ideal place to see fairies according to the poetry of Philip Bourke Marston and others. It was also during the nineteenth century that the fairies’ role as conservers of plant life was crystallised. In The Fairy’s Promise Edwin Arnold had fairies promise to help a love-sick poet because “Thou hast never plucked daisy or heather bell/ From the emerald braes where the fairies dwell.” The fairies’ floral duties are spelled out in detail in The Wounded Daisy by Menella Bate Smedley. They are to be found at work in the corners of meadows:\n\n“Perhaps you’ll see them… setting the lilies steady,\n\nBefore they begin to grow;\n\nOr getting the rosebuds ready\n\nBefore it is time to blow.\n\nA fairy was mending a daisy\n\nWhich someone had torn in half…”\n\nAccording to numerous nineteenth century poets the fairies shaped and inspired growth and, even, taught the plants how to grow at special schools over the winter.\n\nFinally, Menella Bute Smedley made an important leap by involving humans as partners in the task of caring for the natural world:\n\n“Then pull up the weeds with a will,/ And fairies will cherish the flowers.” (A Slight Confusion)\n\nThere are, then, two conceptions of the exact interrelationship between fairies and the natural world. The first is that they exist simply as a part of the natural world and its processes. The second, and more significant, is that they act as ‘guardians of nature’, actively watching over plants, animals and the earth as a whole and keeping the intricate systems in balance.\n\nFairies and the Green Revolution\n\nMany contemporary writers on fairy matters stress how the faes are opposed to intensive agriculture, to overuse of fertilisers, to pollution and to general environmental degradation. It would be easy to imagine that these ideas have been imported into the faery faith since the 1960s, but the examples given so far make it abundantly clear that they were present in folklore and, thence it would seem, in literature, well before any conception of the harms of over-intensive cultivation even occurred to the scientific community.\n\nFairies have always been linked more closely to rural and uncultivated locations than to towns, although it would be wrong to suggest that they’re never seen in urban places (and the evidence of the recent Fairy Census and of the witness accounts recorded in Marjorie Johnson’s Seeing Fairies both suggest this is changing anyway). Even in the countryside, though, they’re not a people solely of wild places and woods. They often live and work around human farms (the Hobs and the Brownie type of spirit) and they frequently take advantage of the human environment, using mills and dancing in pastures and meadows at night. There is no antipathy with agriculture as such, therefore.\n\nThat said, ideas of fairies as a champion of more traditional, organic, self-sufficient production date back to the mid-nineteenth century at the very latest. For example, folklorist Evans Wentz in the 1900s heard in Scotland that the Highland clearances also drove off the sith. Highlander John Dunbar of Invereen told him that “no one sees them now because every place on this parish where they used to appear has been put into sheep and deer and grouse and shooting.” A vision of them fighting with sheep was seen, in fact, as a premonition of what was the follow (Evans Wentz, Fairy Faith, 94).\n\nConclusion\n\nWorks such as Peter Pan and the various Flower Fairies books unquestionably popularised the conception of the fairy as protector and champion of nature, but these ideas had been around since Elizabethan times and had been consolidating during the Victorian period. Such perceptions of the faeries are, arguably, as traditional as notions of them dancing in rings and stealing children. The ‘green fairy’ is not some hippy, environmentalist creation, grafted on in recent decades, but is a fundamental element of the nature of Faery.\n\nFor further discussion of the environmental role of faeries, see my more recent post on the relationship of faeries to the natural world and my book Faeries and the Natural World (2021):\n\nI’ve discussed before the musical Starlight Express by Sir Edward Elgar. As I stated, the 1915 production was based upon the novel, A Prisoner in Fairyland, which was published in June 1913.\n\nBackground\n\nThe novel was written by Algernon Blackwood (1869-1951), an author who specialised in horror and fantasy themes. Several of his short stories build up mystery and fear using a fairy incident as the foundation for the plot: these include ‘Ancient Lights,’ ‘The Trod,’ ‘The Glamour of the Snow’ and ‘May Day Eve.’ His story, ‘A Touch of Pan,’ is his contribution to the Pan cult of the early twentieth century, which I have also mentioned before. Many of his stories can be read online.\n\nA Prisoner in Fairyland is unlike any of these. It is a gentle, delicate, optimistic story, with some beautiful passages of imaginative description. It is not really about Fairyland at all- at least, not about the fairy realm in the sense in which I use it on this blog.\n\nI know nothing definite about Blackwood’s inspiration, but I can’t help wondering if he saw the 1901 pantomime Bluebell in Fairyland, by Seymour Hicks. This production was definitely seen by J. M. Barrie, and inspired Peter Pan, but the idea that fairyland and dreams are the same, that there is a king waiting in a cave to be woken by children so he can do good in the world, and the fact that golden dust is sprinkled in the children’s eyes (“Eyelids droop and close as darkness falls/ Fairyland is waiting as the dustman calls) all seem very similar to Blackwood’s story (as I’ll show).\n\nThe Moral of the Story\n\nBlackwood’s ‘fairyland’ and his references through out to fairies and fairy things is almost unique. As readers may know (especially if you’ve read any of the poems in my Victorian Fairy Verse), ‘fairy’ was used freely by writers from the eighteenth century onwards to denote anything that was small, dainty or cute. Blackwood’s usage derives from this, but it is still wholly his own. What springs to mind is a word no longer used in modern English, but which was, in the past, often to be found in conjunction with fairy- and that is ‘ferly,’ which means a wonder or marvel. It appears, for example, in the sixteenth century Scots drama, The Crying of Ane Playe. The main character, Harry Hobilschowe introduces himself as the play begins, telling us he has just arrived on a whirlwind from Syria, where he:\n\n“lang has bene in þe fary/ Farleis to fynd.”\n\n(he’s spent a long time in fairyland, searching for marvels).\n\nThe word is also used at the outset of the Middle English poem, Piers Plowman. Its use here is even more apposite, for Piers associates it with lying down to rest on a grassy bank near Malvern, one summer’s day. He may then have fallen asleep and dreamed- or else he had a vision:\n\n“In a somer sesun, whon softe was the sonne…\n\nWente I wyde in this world wondres to here;\n\nBote in a Mayes morwnynge on Malverne hulles\n\nMe bifel a ferly, of fairie, me-thoughte.”\n\nIn Blackwood’s story, dreaming is directly associated with access to the fairyland he portrays. Very broadly, the plot involves a successful business man, Henry Rogers, who retires early with the intention of using his wealth on good causes. Rogers takes a holiday with his cousin and his young family at their home in Switzerland and there, in the company of the niece and nephew, rediscovers his childhood dreams. The plot is negligible and the action is entirely concerned with the family’s thoughts, emotions and dreams. In my previous mention of the book, I called it a children’s story; it isn’t: the psychology and philosophy the book contains aren’t intended for younger readers, even though children and their inner life are central to the narrative.\n\nFairies in Fairyland?\n\nSo, are there any fairies in A Prisoner in Fairyland? I must tell you, dear reader, that there are not- and that, in a sense, I was grossly misled when purchasing the book! There are, nevertheless, numerous references to fairies and fairyland, so I need to explain what Blackwood is doing.\n\nThere is one scrap of traditional fairylore, it’s true: in chapter 23 he observes that “People lost in fairyland, they say, always forget the outer world of unimportant happenings.” This is quite true, as folklore makes it very clear how a person may become ‘elf-addled.’ Blackwood is using ‘fairyland’ in quite a different sense, however, to that of a place called Faery.\n\nThe moral of his story is captured is a single paragraph:\n\n“Only the world today no longer believes in Fairyland… and even the children have become scientific. Perhaps it’s only buried, though. The two ought to run in harness really- opposite interpretations of the universe. One might revive it- here and there perhaps. Without it, all the tenderness seems leaking out of life.” (c.5)\n\nAs this may begin to indicate, there are (inevitably) marked traces of Victorian views of Faery in Blackwood’s work. As I have emphasised in my new book, Victorian Fairy Verse, for most writers of the period fairies were synonymous with everything tiny and cute. These underlying assumptions pervade Blackwood’s novel:\n\n“Fairy things, like stars and tenderness, are always small.” (c.31)\n\n“A Fairy blesses because she is a Fairy, not because she turns a pumpkin into a coach and four…” (c.28)\n\n“that raciness and swift mobility, that fluid, protean elasticity of temperament which belonged to the fairy kingdom.” (c.23)\n\nSo, what exactly is Blackwood’s fairyland and how do you get there? The answer is very simple. Fairyland is the inner world of fantasy and imagination that we all inhabit during childhood. It is a source of joy and wonder and it is something that many adults mourn: “The world, too, is a great big child that is crying for its Fairyland.” (c.24)\n\nFor adults to be able to recover their fairyland, they need two things. They need to be close to children and to share their vivid imaginative life. Rogers is sitting with his niece and nephew on his knees and realises:\n\n“Their plans and schemes netted his feet in fairyland just as surely as the weight of their little warm, soft bodies fastened him to the boulder where he sat. He could not move. He could not go further without their will and leadership.” (c.13)\n\nIn their sleep, the children’s spirits leave their bodies and travel on the Starlight Express to a place where starlight is stored. They then use this to heal sick and unhappy adults. “Like Fairies, lit internally with shining lanterns, they flew about their business” (c.16). Rogers, too, learns to join the children in their dreams and to explore this fairyland. It is “a state of mind, open potentially to all, but not to be enjoyed merely for the asking. Like other desirable things, it was to be ‘attained.'” (c.30) Fairyland can be entered only so long as some of its benefits will be taken back to the mortal world.\n\nThe Starlight Express\n\nThe Express carries dreamers’ souls to and from Faery, where they collect starlight. These are memorable images (in fact, stars and constellations sparkle throughout the prose, producing some passages of great beauty) and they clearly had the potential to capture the popular imagination.\n\nAs I mentioned in my preamble, the book appeared in June 1913. By the next summer, the need for Blackwood’s joy and child-like wonder began to seem acute. This explains why it was so quickly adapted as a musical; war-time Britain needed the boost and Blackwood’s text had plenty of uplifting ideas to offer. His key concept was that the uplifting and inspiring thoughts from fairyland must be distributed back to the rest of the world- on “their mission of deliverance.” (c.27) Henry Roger’s cousin is an author and for him the starlight from Faery is inspiration- “a thing of starlight, woods and fairies”- that he may then share with the rest of humanity through his novels: “flakes of thought like fairy seed” (c.27).\n\nAndrew Lloyd Webber’s Musical\n\nThe 1984 musical of the same name as Elgar and Blackwood’s work shares nothing with it except the name. The modern production was inspired by the Thomas the Tank Engine stories and it is, naturally, about trains, which don’t seem very magical to me.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nAs I have described before, the theatrical adaptation of Blackwood’s work was one of several Great War plays and musicals that sought to harness Faery to the Imperial war effort. All of these works have fallen into obscurity since- mostly for good reason.\n\nBlackwood’s novel may have been caught up by jingoism, but it predates the war and has something much deeper to say that the others fairy plays of the time. It can be found cheaply on Amazon etc if you want yourself to travel on the Starlight Express.\n\nJohn Atkinson Grimshaw, Dame Autumn hath a mournful face, 1871\n\nEver since Peter Pan appeared on the stage in 1904, the idea of fairies as flitting points of light has been fixed in the popular imagination. This post looks at the facts and the fiction of these perceptions of faery.\n\nTinkerbell\n\nIn contrast to her theatrical representation, in his book of the story of Peter Pan, J. M. Barrie imagined Tinkerbell as a full physical creature. For example, she is described as being-\n\n“exquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf cut low and square, through which her figure could be seen to the best advantage. She was slightly inclined to embonpoint.”\n\nTink is very evidently not just solid- she’s sexy, she’s sexual and she’s possessive.\n\nHowever, in the stage-play the fairy was reduced to a flickering light and a tinkle of bells. The light “darts about” using language that is variously furious, acerbic, shrill and impudent- we are told. But it all sounds the same to us; Tinkerbell is a presence that can hardly be seen and barely understood except through the mediation of Peter.\n\nThis image of a flickering light caught hold though, despite its insubstantial nature, and is noticeably strong in the evidence of contemporary witnesses.\n\nJohn Atkinson Grimshaw, Iris.\n\nTraditional fays\n\nIs this all Barrie’s fault and invention, though? By and large, traditional sightings don’t have much to say about glowing lights- except for the will o’the wisp, who was nothing but a flitting light. These fairy apparitions have only one purpose, though, to lure travellers out of their way into bogs and mires; they are not fully rounded characters like Tink and most faeries. Nevertheless, despite the paucity of evidence, there is an interesting report from Dartmoor published in 1876 which describes the pixies.\n\n“The pixies are never really seen, but in some cases white spots are seen moving about in the dark and then they are heard- although you can’t understand their words.” (Transactions of the Devonshire Association, vol.8, 1876, p.57)\n\nSecondly, from Evans Wentz’ Fairy faith in Celtic countries, there comes a sighting on the Isle of Man dating from about the 1860s. The witness, a member of the island’s legislature at the time of recording his experience, had been walking home at night with a friend when he saw across a small brook:\n\n“a circle of supernatural light… The spot where the light appeared was a flat space surrounded on the sides away from the river by banks formed by low hills; and into this space and the circle of light, from the surrounding sides apparently, I saw come in twos and threes a great crowd of little beings smaller than Tom Thumb and his wife. All of them, who appeared like soldiers, were dressed in red. They moved back and forth amid the circle of light as they formed into order like troops drilling.” (Wentz p.133)\n\nThe witness’ companion declined to get any nearer and, after a while, struck a wall with his walking stick, thereby causing the fairies and their ‘aura’ to vanish instantaneously.\n\nLastly, Walter Gill recorded in his Second Manx Scrapbook of 1932 that fairies might be seen far off at night on the Isle of Man, as sparks or little flames dancing on hilltops.\n\nThese three are intriguing, if rather isolated, reports.\n\nJohn Atkinson Grimshaw, Midsummer Eve.\n\nContemporary fays\n\nIn the more recent witness reports of Marjorie Johnson’s Seeing fairies and, even more so, in the Fairy Census 2017, the luminosity of fairies is often mentioned, so it’s worth analysing the figures a little.\n\nMovement is the most noticeable feature of the sightings in the modern period. In the Census there’s total of 69 cases of luminous fays (14% of the total); Johnson meanwhile has 34 instances. Whilst 15% of the Census lights were stationary, 73% were in motion. Sometimes a fairy body will be seen with the light, or the fairy is said to have ‘an aura’ but they can too be simple points of light: 28% of the Census witnesses described the fairy as a ball of light. We may very well suspect here the influence of J. M. Barrie‘s stage representation of Tinkerbell in the minds of those having the experience. This seems to be confirmed by a woman from Michigan describing an experience during the 1990s. She wrote that:\n\n“They were like little lights. Like Tinker Bell while she’s flying. A little pixie light. Several of them.”\n\nAnother witness told Johnson about “a Tinker Bell light.”\n\nThere’s more to say though. A variety of effects have been associated with the bright fairies. Some give off flashes of light, others sparkle (“as though speckled with stardust”). Some produce a noise (for example, a high pitched buzz or humming) and some also wax and wane in their brilliance:\n\n“the whole area of trees seemed to glow as though there were a lot of lights in that area of the woods. The light seemed to pulsate, growing brighter and growing dimmer again. I watched closely and saw the light changing colour. There were several different colours, blue, red and orange and they all seemed to blend together. ” (Census no.6, England, 2014)\n\n“a ball of energy that looked like a sparkler.” (Census no.349)\n\n“a light appeared on or from within a half dead pecan tree. It swirled around the trunk from ground level to about twenty five feet or so high. At its highest point the light appeared to come from within the tree … It then swirled around the trunk again losing brightness until it faded.” (Census no.414, US, 1990s)\n\nA variety of colours are seen. Blue, white and multi-coloured are most common, but a full spectrum of hues from pink and violet through green to silver and gold have been reported.\n\nIn Johnson’s reports 25% of the fairies had an aura. For example, one was “a lovely little fairy dressed in silver and green and it floated before her, lighting the way.” (p.37) A woman and her child in Cornwall saw a patch of mist in the garden, which-\n\n“gradually cleared to light like neon-lighting, but ball-shaped and then, fascinated, she watched what she called the ‘glitter of the fairies’, mauve, blue, green, orange, yellow, red and white lights brighter than any gems, going round in a little circle and then darting backwards and forwards.” (p.168)\n\nAnother witness on the Scottish island of Iona in 1954 saw a mass of light shaped into small clouds and another being with a ‘halo’ of spring green and sunset pink around the head (p.226)\n\nAs already seen in some of the quotations, 20% of the Census cases the fairy lights are associated with trees, bushes and other foliage. Today, of course, we very much conceive of greenery as the natural abode of the fays but nonetheless it is an interesting association.\n\nPeople may of course see lights for a variety of reasons. Their eyes may be dazzled; there may be some physiological problem that has yet to be diagnosed. Even so, many of the experiences on the Census don’t seem capable of explanation by such means and the witnesses themselves are frequently critical and cautious of ascribing supernatural origins. For example, they will often consider other explanations, such as insects. The comparison may be made to a firefly, but there will be something to make it clear that it is not an insect that has been seen- generally the size of the being. One of Johnson’s correspondents described seeing in Spain in the mid-1950s “quantities of small lights- which were too big for glow worms- flitting about.” (p.313)\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThe experience of bright, flitting fairies is now so common that we may have to regard it as one of the features of the species. Despite the paucity of older sources recounting similar effects, darting lights now seem to be a determining element for deciding what a witness has seen. These sightings may be very puzzling, but they are persistent and consistent, so we may need to revise our preconceptions about the supernatural and how it appears to us.\n\nJohn Anster Fitzgerald, The fairy’s lake, 1866, Tate Gallery\n\n“There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,\n\nThan are dreamt of in your philosophy.”\n\n(Hamlet, Act 1, scene 5).\n\nIn January this year the Fairy Investigation Society published a Fairy Census covering 2014-2017. The document makes fascinating reading and I will be examining its contents over a couple of posts. Here, I want to raise the intriguing question of what, exactly, we understand by the word ‘fairy’ in the early 21st century.\n\nThe data for the census comes from individuals across the world, although primarily from Britain, Ireland and the USA. They submitted descriptions of their fairy experiences to the Society and these give us an opportunity to consider what today is popularly understood to be ‘a fairy.’\n\nWe all think we know what a fairy looks like: we envisage either a fluttering girl or a small pixie in green. Whatever the detail, the fundamental assumption is that they are humanoids, closely resembling us. Nevertheless the Census, along with Marjorie Johnson’s Seeing fairies, confronts us with a body of sightings which within themselves are consistent and which challenge our conventional ideas. Some fairies apparently do not look like fairies at all.\n\nSmall animals\n\nIt is not unusual to hear of fairies and pixies being described as particularly hirsute and shaggy, with dark and unkempt hair, but a small number of encounters have been with mammalian beings that display human-like characteristics. Marjorie Johnson gathered together several of these.\n\nDuring the summer of 1920 fairy seer Tom Charman spent nine weeks in the New Forest and repeatedly met with small cat-like creatures. Similar beings were described to Johnson by witnesses from Kent, Essex and Cheshire, but she also received a comparable report from Indiana- of a cat standing on its hind legs and wearing brown trousers. When disturbed, it ran away ‘like a rabbit.’\n\nIn his valuable little book, Somerset fairies and pixies (2010), Jon Dathen interviewed a Somerset farmer who recounted a sighting from his childhood, some seventy years earlier. Late at night he had sneaked downstairs to find a small person “like a hare done up in clothes” sitting in front of the farmhouse fire. He had long ears, whiskers and buck teeth, but he could speak- explaining he had come in to escape the cold. Later in his life, the farmer had heard of other hare-type pixies being sighted in the county.\n\nJohn Anster Fitzgerald, The storm.\n\nFurry shapes\n\nA handful of reports take furriness even further. A woman on holiday in mid-Cornwall during the 1930s described how she regularly met some cliff dwelling pixies; both were about two feet in height. The male was a small human with some distinctive features but the female was covered in short dark brown hair with yellow rings on her body and arms, somewhat like a bee.\n\nTwo other accounts are even more surprising. During the early 1940s in Kent one woman was on a country walk when she saw a furry tennis ball rolling up a slope towards her. It briefly opened when it drew close to where she was sitting to reveal a pixie within- and then disappeared. Returning to Cornwall in the 1930s, a final witness on a coastal walk sighted a pisky who then changed into “a long furry black roll, which gambolled about on the grass and then disappeared.”\n\nJohn Anster Fitzgerald, The painter’s dream.\n\n‘Ent fays’\n\nOver the last hundred and fifty years the identification of fairies with the environment and natural processes has become more and more commonplace. Some fairies are seen dressed in garments made from leaves and flowers, but it may not be especially surprising to find that supernatural beings are met with who appear to be more vegetative than animal. These are creatures whose body seems to be composed of vegetable matter; they may perhaps be subdivided into ‘ents,’ walking trees, and smaller hybrid entities.\n\nThe tree-beings can be tall, seven feet high or more, perhaps with faces showing in the bark of their ‘bodies.’ The smaller vegetation fairies appear to be far more mixed in their appearance. Some have bodies made of animated leaves and sticks, some are composed of a mixture of plant and insect elements, some are tiny leaf-like creatures. With more evidence it may very likely be possible to analyse these types further.\n\nCharles Altamont Doyle, A creeper.\n\nMonsters\n\nLast of all, there is a collection of witness accounts that tests our conceptions of fairies to the limits. There are strange hybrid creatures: a dragonfly-fish, a frog-sparrow or a butterfly-bird. There are also semi-human forms: beings that are part human and part insect, reptile, dog, spider or frog, as well as fairies that seem to be a combination of traditional fairy and mermaid features. Some fays have appeared as huge tadpoles, another as an ape dressed in leaves.\n\nSome other less conventional forms\n\nThere are various other classes of sighting which, whilst fitting within the conventional imagery of fays, still display some unique features.\n\nAliens\n\nThe boundaries between ‘aliens’ and ‘fairies’ are increasingly uncertain and permeable, it seems. In Seeing fairies a tiny number of witnesses mentioned beings with pronounced pointed faces or slit/ black eyes. The proportion of such sightings was distinctly higher in the Census, suggesting that the now-standard concept of a ‘grey alien’ may be shaping fairy experiences.\n\nHumanoids\n\nAlthough the commonest fay form is human, they are sometimes said to be noticeably disproportionate, being too tall or having overlong limbs. This is occasionally hinted at in Johnson’s reports, but spindly or gangly bodies are considerably more frequent in the Census, with bodies described as being very slender, long-limbed or above normal height.\n\nLights\n\nThe luminosity of fairies is often mentioned, but the last transformation is the eradication of the body altogether: the fairy is reduced to a point of light, which is often seen darting about. Johnson’s witnesses experienced this only a handful of times. In the Census fourteen per cent of cases were sightings of bright lights, of which nearly three quarters were moving. We may suspect here the influence of J. M. Barrie‘s stage representation of Tinkerbell in the minds of those having the experience.\n\nJohn Anster Fitzgerald, The stuff that dreams are made on (detail).\n\nConclusions\n\nOn their own, these reports are so anomalous as to make no sense, but grouped together some sort of pattern does appear to emerge and it is possible to identify certain ‘species’ that are regularly sighted. Perhaps they are so different from the standard idea of fairy to demand a new name, but at present ‘faery’ is the only category to which we may assign them.\n\n‘Ferdinand and Ariel,’ by John Millais\n\nWhatever our view of the existence of fairies and of a supernatural realm, there can be no denying the profound impact of faery (or the idea of it) upon our art and culture. The reason for all this creativity, it seems to me, is that faery as a subject is so rich and complex. Fairies can offer artists every emotion- sexual obsession, love, fear, jealousy, unbounded joy, mystery and mysticism- the list is lengthy.\n\nFae themes have been persistently rich sources of inspiration for a range of artists, whether in literature, song or the visual arts. I’ll present a few examples, though I’m sure that proof is scarcely needed:\n\nOn the stage– whether inspiring the high art of Shakespeare or pantomimes and popular plays such as Peter Pan. There was a particular trend for patriotic fairy stage plays during the Great War, which I have discussed;\n\nMusicals, such as Edward Elgar’s Starlight Express of 1915 (this is the original production of this title, plainly, and not that by Andrew Lloyd Webber);\n\nNovels and short stories (for both adults and children), from Charles Kingsley and George MacDonald through Enid Blyton, Beatrix Potter and E. M. Nesbit to Tolkien to Alan Garner;\n\nRomance and myth– fairy themes are strong throughout many of the Arthurian myths and related stories, including the Welsh Mabinogion;\n\nPoetry– from Robert Herrick and Michael Drayton through Keats and Blake to Walter de la Mare and Ivor Gurney. On this blog I have been particularly interested in examining the interaction between fairy verse and the First World War, in the work of Robert Graves, Rose Fyleman, J R R Tolkien and others;\n\nPainting- from Fuseli to Peter Blake and Brian Froud;\n\nIllustration– from Rossetti and Burne-Jones through Edmund Dulac, Arthur Rackham and Henry Justice Ford to Cicely Mary Barker and Margaret Tarrant;\n\nSculpture– for example the puppets of Wendy Froud or the wire creations of Robin Wright;\n\nFilm and cartoon– we have both fictional films, such as Disney’s Peter Pan or The Dark Crystal, as well as documentaries and ‘factual’ stories based upon the Cottingley case; and,\n\nMusic– ranging from classical to pop, from ballet, opera, ballads, symphonies and lieder, light opera (Gilbert and Sullivan) to contemporary rock (Led Zeppelin, Marc Bolan or Sigur Ros).\n\nOf course, the additional value of all of the above is that they are a supplement to the folklore evidence. Just as much as traditional stories of fairies gathered by folklorists in the field, these various media give us a view of contemporary beliefs on the conduct and appearance of the fays.\n\nWhat’s more, fairy works have inspired other fairy art. For example Shakespeare’s Midsummer Night’s Dream has inspired many works of art (by Paton, Dadd, Millais and many others). In particular, it inspired a painting by Thomas Stothard, Titania and Oberon, which in turn inspired a poem by Elizabeth Landon, The fairy queen sleeping. In just the same way in 1825 Louisa Anne Meredith wrote The enchanted island in response to seeing the painting of the same name by Francis Darby; “’Tis the fairies’ home” the verse declares.\n\nI’ll make a radical suggestion: even were fairies not to exist, their impact upon human culture would be almost undiminished. We might even propose that, even if fairies did not exist, it would have been necessary to invent them to provide ourselves with such rich and fruitful veins of imagery and ideas.\n\nThe fairies have inspired our creativity for centuries, whether the source of that inspiration is our own imaginations or is an external supernatural force. The power of this creative stimulus is expressly acknowledged by artists working in this genre. It is not just a matter of the work produced, but of the transformative impact upon the artists themselves. Interviewed by Signe Pike in Faery tale, painter Brian Froud said that many of his readers and fans feel that with a rediscovery of their fairy faith:\n\n“they feel they are coming home. They tell me they want to go away and write, or make something…”\n\nHis wife agreed: “often people have a creative response to our work.” She starts her puppet workshops with meditation, within which “you do actually, genuinely, touch faeryland- you’re in it, whether you realise it or not. So when you come back, and make a figure, it’s imbued with its own personality.” In the act of imaginative creation, it would seem, there is a re-creation of the creator (Pike, 2010, pp.86-66).\n\nIn his introduction to David Riche’s Art of faery (2003), Froud argued that “Fairies mediate art, the mysterious moments of our creative relationship with the world.” Whilst the twentieth century had emphasised our alienation from the world, the resurgence of visionary fairy art in its last decades and into the new millennium suggests the reversal of this and through that “the beginning of a spiritual journey. To paint fairies is not childish- but it could certainly said to be childlike- in its openness to creative and emotional impulses.”\n\nOur culture is richer for fairies; we are richer for fairies….\n\nFurther reading\n\nNeil Rushton on his dead but dreaming blog on WordPress provides a very useful overview of the entire world history of fairy art.
