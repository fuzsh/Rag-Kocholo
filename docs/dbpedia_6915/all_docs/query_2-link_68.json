And they handed out medals too. I'm quite elated because the pressure is off now! Although I have to go into Freshman XC next year with quite the burden on my shoulders…\n\nI saw the trailer to Prime but it looked really weird. Meryl and Uma are certainly attractions, but I can't say the storyline looked anything interesting.\n\nAdios everyone!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nMadam Pince - Nov 2, 2005 7:06 pm (#1502 of 2980)\n\n68 degrees, Viola!!! Lawsy me -- I'd freeze to death! If I had my say, it would be set at 75 year-round. I freely admit to having very thin blood -- a sweater just doesn't do it for me, and I refuse to go around inside my own house looking like the little kid from A Christmas Story in his Michelin-Man suit. This is, of course, a constant source of battle between Mr. Pince and I and is probably the one reason we might get a divorce someday. As soon as he leaves in the morning, I turn the thermostat up (usually to 72, but maybe 74 if I'm feeling rebellious), and as soon as he gets home, he turns it down. I also find that when I'm tired, I feel the cold more, too. I suspect that my thyroid is wonky -- it did weird things when Little Pince was born and that probably contributes, but the Dr. says no worries. He doesn't see me wearing sweats and sweatshirts during the summer when Mr. P has the A/C cranked up, though. I can honestly say that I don't ever remember a time in my life when I have ever been too hot, but plenty of times when I've been cold. I once told an employer who made fun of me for wanting a spaceheater in my office that I didn't care what else I had to do without, I would pay my electric bill so that I could turn the heat up in my house as high as I pleased. He thought I was nuts.\n\nI am a devoted fan of The Waltons and am buying the DVDs as they come out. I figure when Little Pince is old enough to watch \"real TV\" rather than cartoons, rather than having him watch the stuff that's on now that's not very well-suited for kids, we can always watch re-runs of the Walton clan. One reason I like it so much is that I always felt like I was watching my Mom's family when she was growing up -- there were seven kids, they lived in the mountains of Virginia and grew up during the Depression, and the family ran a sawmill / lumber business. Pretty darn similar!\n\nI liked Little House at the time, but after reading the books, the TV series paled in comparison (although Nellie Olsen still remains as one of the greatest TV villains ever, in my opinion.) I still re-read anything by Laura Ingalls Wilder to this day (she wrote a lot aside from the \"Little House\" books.) She lived through an extraordinary period of American history and did such a great job of recording it through her observant writing. You'd be surprised how often her tidbits of \"prairie wisdom\" I end up using in my everyday life even today!\n\nCongrats on the track and field medals, Finn! Woo-hoo!\n\nGood idea on the cookies, Jenn! Aaron will be very pleased, I'm sure!\n\nWay to go, Shayla and Lexie, for doing so great in school! You must be doing something right, Marie!\n\nDenise, great parenting job on the Halloween thing! Mean Moms Unite! LOL. Actually I haven't had to be too mean lately; Little Pince has been well aware of Halloween. But I'm convinced he is in training to be a lawyer -- I told him not to touch the candy until after dinner, and then he went all \"wide-eyed\" on me when I caught him holding a Milky Way bar. He said quite earnestly \"I didn't touch the candy, Mom, I was only just touching the paper.\"\n\n_____________________________________\n\nViola Intonada - Nov 2, 2005 7:36 pm (#1503 of 2980)\n\nHubby keeps a space heater at his desk at work. He also keeps a jacket at his desk year round (so he can wear it in the summer when they over-aircondition the office)\n\nTonight at dinner, we were both shivering. We may pay the extra money to turn it up a couple of degrees. Meanwhile our children are sitting there in short sleeves looking at us like we are nuts for being cold. Alas, to be a kid again and not be bothered by being cold.\n\nWay to stick to your guns, Denise. My kids have been fighting a lot lately. I told them if they fight any this week, half of their candy is mine. I'll keep taking half of what they have left every time they fight. They have been behaving much better since Halloween. (Dash it all, the one time I was looking forward to carrying out my threat! )\n\n_____________________________________\n\nkaykay1970 - Nov 2, 2005 8:53 pm (#1504 of 2980)\n\nI was only touching the paper. That is so cute!!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nAmilia Smith - Nov 2, 2005 9:22 pm (#1505 of 2980)\n\nWelcome, Tazzygirl. Woo-hoo!!! I have another forumer near me now!\n\nThey keep the air-conditioning on way too much in Hamilton Library, where I work. The thermometer says it is only down to 65, but we don't believe it. You should see us. We all bring jackets and hoodies in to work. One of my co-workers insists on sitting near the wall so that she can plug her heating pad in. And our noses still turn bright red and start dripping. I tell you, it doesn't take long for your blood to thin.\n\nMills.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nTazzygirl - Nov 2, 2005 11:14 pm (#1506 of 2980)\n\nWow Amilia! I thought I was the only one here in Hawaii. How many other people are here in Hawaii? How much longer are you at UH? I was born in Utah, but I only lived there until I was 6. How long have you been out here? Hamilton Library is really cold- wait, so are the classrooms now that I think about it. There is a classroom up in George Hall that seems to be in the negatives. You think they would set the thermostat to a more comfortable temperature. At least Hamilton has an excuse- keep it cold so the books don't get all mildewy!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nThe giant squid - Nov 3, 2005 12:36 am (#1507 of 2980)\n\nPuck, like I said, when the average temps over the last few months have been in the 90s, 68 is just too cold. When I was growing up in North Dakota, I'd be running around in a t-shirt at that point; now they only come out to be worn under my work shirts...\n\nMadame Pince, it's a known fact that the two things married couples argue about most are money & the thermostat. I keep seeing these ads for a dating service that boasts \"29 degrees of compatibility\"; I wonder if one of those is \"temperature comfort zone\"?\n\n--Mike\n\n_____________________________________\n\nCatherine - Nov 3, 2005 5:50 am (#1508 of 2980)\n\nHe said quite earnestly \"I didn't touch the candy, Mom, I was only just touching the paper.\" --Madame Pince\n\nI think Baby Pince and Hayley will have to set up a law practice together. If confronted about misbehavior, Hayley will ask, \"Did you SEE me do it?\" Next thing you know, she will call in an expert witness.\n\nHayley says quite amusing things all the time. Yesterday after school, she launched into the stories about who got in trouble that day in Kindergarten (this is a favorite topic for Hayley). She said, \"Those boys need to be focused on their learning\" (this was a common phrase from her Montessori preschool). Yesterday, Hayley said, \"They are not focused on their learning; they are focused on being 'astracted' (distracted).\"\n\nPoor Hayley was offended when I laughed at her paradoxical statement. But I knew exactly how those boys were acting if they were \"focused on distraction.\" Unfortunately, sometimes I feel like I am focused upon distraction....\n\n_____________________________________\n\nLina - Nov 3, 2005 7:05 am (#1509 of 2980)\n\nYesterday I caught my 6 year old in a lie. I really can't stand lying or a feeling that I couldn't believe my kid, and I'm not used to her lying, so we had a little talk. I asked her: \"How about telling me the truth?\" She said: \"I don't understand it. Could you explain me what does the truth mean?\"\n\n_____________________________________\n\nLoopy Lupin - Nov 3, 2005 7:15 am (#1510 of 2980)\n\nI don't understand it. Could you explain me what does the truth mean? –Lina\n\nI think I spent three semesters of graduate school trying to answer that question.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nMadam Pince - Nov 3, 2005 7:25 am (#1511 of 2980)\n\nLina, that's so funny! I've been trying to explain that same abstract concept to Little Pince, too! It's one of the things about parenting that you don't really think about until your kid really sincerely asks you something that they don't understand. It would never occur to me to have to explain to someone what \"truth\" is, until I realized that of course a 3-year-old wouldn't know. So I tried saying, \"Well, it's when you aren't telling a fib, then you're telling the truth.\" Naturally, next came \"What's a fib?\" OK, start over. \"Truth is when you say something that is correct.\" Blank look. \"Or when you say something that is right.\" Then I got \"Right like my shoe?\" (We're working on left vs. right.) Ummmmmm.... no not quite. It's like playing that board game \"Taboo\" where you try to give clues to a word without using the words that are most closely associated with that word. Arrrrghhh.... This parenting thing is over my head sometimes....\n\nCatherine, Hayley sounds so adorable! Has she seen The Incredibles by any chance? When that kid was confronted about something he did at school, the Mom said \"You SAW him do this?\" and he ended up getting out of it. Maybe Hayley thinks if it worked for Dash, it might work for her! And the \"'astracted\" is too cute! It's so funny when they get the words almost right! I try to look at it as a mind exercise for me to keep me from getting Alzheimer's as I try to figure out what word he's trying to say -- they are pretty funny sometimes!\n\nEdit: I think I spent three semesters of graduate school trying to answer that question.\n\nLOL, Loopy! And I love your avatar -- go Seabiscuit! Another weepy movie for me... at the end I thought the former jockey was just holding back so Seabiscuit could beat at least one horse and would feel good about himself, and that started the flood.\n\nEdit again: I'm so glad Tazzy and Mills found each other! I soooo wanted to post in the \"Introduce\" thread and tell Tazzy \"Ooh, Oooh, you have to meet Mills!\"\n\n_____________________________________\n\nYdnam96 - Nov 3, 2005 9:48 am (#1512 of 2980)\n\nI have nothing relevant to say, I don't have children and well my cat hasn't learned to lie just yet I think he's still a little young for that. He's only 3. Although he does give me that \"you can't prove it was me\" look sometimes.\n\nSpeaking of kitty. He's been throwing up again. I know it's nothing serious, he just has a sensitive tummy. But my whole apartment is carpet and it's hard to clean up. You know, I thought a cat would be easier than a kid...\n\nWell...I should get ready for work. Have a great Thursday.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nT Brightwater - Nov 3, 2005 10:06 am (#1513 of 2980)\n\nMandy, I feel your pain; I have two 18-year-old Siamese and they get hairballs no matter how often we brush them. Also, they seem to prefer upchucking on carpet or upholstery instead of linoleum. :-(\n\nLina and Madame Pince, when you figure out how to explain truth to your kids, would you mind taking a little trip to Washington DC and explaining it to a few more people?\n\nMadame Pince, what part of VA? My (adoptive) father's family was from around Bassett and he grew up around the same time.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nCatherine - Nov 3, 2005 10:10 am (#1514 of 2980)\n\nAlthough he does give me that \"you can't prove it was me\" look sometimes. –Ydnam\n\nMy Daisy tried that last week. I got home from work and there was an unholy mess in the bathroom. Someone had shredded the tissues from the trash can into teensy confetti bits. What was amusing is that both dogs were in their dogbed, and sleeping in the same position they had assumed before I left for work.\n\nDaisy raised her head to greet me, and there was a piece of tissue stuck to her face. She acted so innocent, but the evidence suggested otherwise.\n\nOf course, Phoebe may have plotted to frame Daisy for this crime.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nazi - Nov 3, 2005 10:17 am (#1515 of 2980)\n\nWoohoo, I have premium membership-ness! Discovered a friend had paypal...couldn't resisit...\n\nHope your cat gets better soon, Ydnam! I can't think of anything to suggest other than covering the whole of the carpet with some wipable plastic or something, and that's a silly idea really!\n\nKids say the funniest things. I don't have any examples, except my little cousin's reaction to discovering the concept of cremation at a funeral - 'You can't bake her, she'll burn!' (she was told that the person would be baked in a big oven). Morbid, but I couldn't help laughing to myself.\n\nCongrats Finn! I'm sure you'll live up to your reputation next year!\n\nHorrible weather today, and a bad day also. I was forced to go up to the blackboard in maths to write the answer to an equation, even though I told the teacher I didn't know the answer or how to work it out. I was in tears by the end of the lesson.\n\nHopefully everyone will have a much better day than that!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nLina - Nov 3, 2005 10:21 am (#1516 of 2980)\n\nLoopy Lupin: I think I spent three semesters of graduate school trying to answer that question.\n\nLol, Loopy. Somehow, I didn't feel like I had the time to wait for her to go to the graduate school and then spend three semesters looking for the answer, so I had to do something immediately... I asked her, should I go to the teacher to ask what happened? She said: \"No.\" So I asked her to tell me what would the teacher tell me if I asked her. Well, I explained, this is the truth. It was cute, actually, because she didn't try to lie when she was supposed to tell the teachers version, maybe because she knew that I could ask her. Madam Pince, my husband told me that he read somewhere that the kids up to the age of 5, actually never lie. I don't know if that is the truth or if he interpreted it correctly, but something like they don't see the purpose of lie, if they don't say the truth, that's just because of the imagination, not because they want to gain something by telling the lie. As a matter of fact, that is the age that I had to deal with the subject with each of my girls. I usually tell them: \"I'm used to believe you when you tell me something, I would like it to remain this way.\" Then I spend some time in checking everything they tell me and it usually helps. Except with one kid that liked to go back to lying from time to time, not that I see the reason for that. I had to make a really big threat to make it stop. I just hope it worked. So, if little Pince doesn't understand the concept of truth, it seems normal for his age.\n\nOoooh, I really didn't plan to make such a long post when I started! Sorry! I just got carried away...\n\nEdit: Woohoo, congratulations, Azi! And healing charms to your kitty, Mandy!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nSoul Mate for Sirius - Nov 3, 2005 11:21 am (#1517 of 2980)\n\nI don't have much to say on the children telling lies subject, as I don't have kids, but good luck to all of you trying to explain it to them!!\n\nFinn, congrats on yet another CX win! That's awesome! and don't worry, I'm sure you'll have no problem living up to your reputation next year!\n\nMandy, I hope your cat starts feeling better. But I know how hard it is to clean up the carpet after a sick cat. I have two cats (at home at my parent's house) and they get sick a LOT!\n\nSo I got some awesome news this afternoon. The Channel 3 news up in Cleveland (ABC's local branch there I believe) is doing this thing called Salute to Service for Christmas. Family and friends of service men & women over in Iraq can tape Christmas greetings for them and Channel 3 will send the tapes over to them. Anyway, there was a very limited number of taping slots and I got a call this afternoon that I got one! The man who called said that I could bring anyone I wanted to with me, such as Aaron's family or some of his other friends. I was thinking maybe I'd try to get on his mother's good side, by inviting her and his sisters to come with me. I know it would mean a lot to him if they came with me. Now the hard part is just getting up the nerve to call and ask her!!\n\nNot really too much else to say. Have a good day everyone!!\n\n-Jenn\n\n_____________________________________\n\nPuck - Nov 3, 2005 11:58 am (#1518 of 2980)\n\nI admit, though usually we try to wait until November, we did turn the heat on a couple of weeks back. We would have suffered through, but the house was down to 55 degrees, which seemed too cold for a newborn. I had her in onsie, with a sleeper over that, and leggings and a fleece sweater covering the lot.\n\nMy son told his first lie around age five. Told me he had eaten all his fruit, and was ready for dessert. He seemed to have eaten quickly, so I asked if I should look in the trash can and got \"NO! DON'T!\" I let him know it's wrong to lie, and Mommy will always catch him. He's been truthful since.\n\nI get to go out to dinner with friends tonight, so excited. Natalie is coming too, so they can meet her. (One is driving up from New Jersey.) Daddy is just not ready for 3 kids on his own at bedtime.\n\nWell, I hear a basket of laundry calling me- it's been waiting a couple of days to be folded.\n\nOh, and just to be a total geek, Almanzo was the youngest of the Wilder Brothers. It must have been Royal who lost the presents.\n\nKathy\n\n_____________________________________\n\nMadam Pince - Nov 3, 2005 12:13 pm (#1519 of 2980)\n\nJenn, that's great! What a wonderful holiday gift to send to Aaron! Great opportunity to score major points with \"Mom\" too, no less.\n\nAzi, congrats on the star! And the great avatar! Is that you?\n\nPuck, have fun with your dinner tonight!\n\nLittle Pince has already done that bit with me -- I ask him something like \"Did you finish your snack?\" And he says \"Yes\" and then when I say \"Great! Let me just go and see your nice clean plate!\" and he runs in front of me going \"No, no no!!!\" Soooooo.... Lina, unfortunately I think he already knows when he's fibbing, he just wasn't exactly sure what it was called! Actually, that was a good learning opportunity -- I turned it into \"Now, see, when you told me that, that was a fib, and that was wrong. It's very bad and makes Mommy and Daddy very sad. Don't ever do it again.\" Sigh.... it's neverending I guess.\n\nJust like hairballs -- also never-ending..... I miss my kitty-cat so much (he died right before Little Pince was born) but the one thing I don't miss is stepping in the hairballs in the dark...\n\nLOL about poor Daisy with the tell-tale tissue stuck to her face! A dog just can't get away with anything these days!\n\nI don't remember the Royal / Almanzo Christmas story -- Farmer Boy was my least favorite of the series and so I re-read it less often. It sounds about like them, though.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nJulie Aronson - Nov 3, 2005 1:33 pm (#1520 of 2980)\n\nJenn,\n\nFYI, Channel 3 is the local NBC affiliate.\n\nJulie\n\n_____________________________________\n\nTazzygirl - Nov 3, 2005 1:48 pm (#1521 of 2980)\n\nThe series of Little House on the Prairie is waaaaaay different than the books- I am also a die hard fan. The brother that Almanzo showed the christmas presents to was not Royal- it was another brother according to the show. Farmer boy was also my least favorite. Don't have cats or kids- but I am a nanny to a two year old girl and a six month old boy. Neither one has the telling a lie down yet! One can only hope...\n\n_____________________________________\n\nhaymoni - Nov 3, 2005 1:50 pm (#1522 of 2980)\n\nJenn - you might want to call his mom and let her think that you did this for HER.\n\nA news station will send a tape to Aaron of his family and friends. I thought of you and thought you might like to do it and YOU WON!!!\n\nThe only problem is that she could take the opportunity and not include you, but you could let Aaron know later that it was all your doing!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nDenise P. - Nov 3, 2005 2:45 pm (#1523 of 2980)\n\nMadam Pince, that Christmas story was never recounted in either the Little House series of books or in any of the several biographies I have read of Laura Ingalls Wilder. Probably like a good portion of the tv series, it was pure TV. (Mary...married...with a baby??!!! Don't get me started on Albert. And Almanzo called her Bess or Bessie, not Beth...)\n\nI actually liked Farmer Boy and I even have a Little House Cookbook. You know ginger water, that Laura raves about being such a wonderful treat? Blech!!! I have made the snow candy too. Blech!! Part of it is that today, our tastebuds are so used to a load of refined sugar that the coarse sugars used back then don't taste as sweet to us.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nFinn BV - Nov 3, 2005 2:50 pm (#1524 of 2980)\n\nJenn, that's great! What a great present for Aaron!\n\nAzi, congrats on the pretty little star next to your name!\n\nTazzygirl, I do believe Mills also grew up in Utah unless I'm much mistaken…\n\nNot much to say here, have a good evening, all!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nSoul Mate for Sirius - Nov 3, 2005 3:25 pm (#1525 of 2980)\n\nThanks Julie! I couldn't remember which it was and all the channels are different down here in Columbus!\n\nHaymoni, you're probably right about letting Aaron's mom think this is for her. But I'd hate to think she'd take all the credit. But, I wouldn't put it past her! I think I may just have to suck it up and take my chances though! I'd really like to get on her good side!\n\nWell, I'm busy chatting it up in the Chat room, so this is all for now!\n\n-Jenn\n\n_____________________________________\n\nThe giant squid - Nov 3, 2005 3:29 pm (#1526 of 2980)\n\nazi, congrats on your membership, and condolences on your awful day. Why do some teachers insist on publicly embarrassing their students? If, as you said, you clearly had no idea what the answer was and how to get it, what point is there to have you stand in front of the class other than humiliation? Let someone else who does know do it so you can see how it's done. It's the old \"honey vs. vinegar\" thing.\n\nJenn, that's great news, and I think haymoni's on the right track to getting Mom in on it. If she does squeeze you out, though, make sure you smile and be polite, and when you tell Aaron keep it nonchalant and all \"it's a good thing\". The last thing you want to do is bad mouth his mother to him (even if he does it himself). Guys are touchy about that sort of thing.\n\nAs for the lying thing... I swear I never fibbed to my parents. But then, I could be lying now...you never know.\n\n--Mike\n\n_____________________________________\n\nAmilia Smith - Nov 3, 2005 3:53 pm (#1527 of 2980)\n\nHey, Tazzy!

I don't have a cat or a dog because my dad is allergic, but I would find it a pain to clean up after it! I really want an animal though...

I know! That little error always aggravated me to no end! I mean, what's the difference -- why not do it right? It's like putting Hermione in a pink Yule Ball dress instead of a blue one... grrrrrr...\n\nAnd the \"Mary married with a baby\" bit was very far off from reality, but I must say that the episode where the Blind School had the fire made me a soppy mess for days... and I didn't like Albert either, but that fire episode was so heart-wrenching.\n\nOK, so I'm a total sap...\n\n_____________________________________\n\nFinn BV - Nov 3, 2005 4:40 pm (#1531 of 2980)\n\nAnd I've only been here since May. –Mills\n\nWhoa, really?

If this 'ship does turn into a marriage and she ends up as your mother-in-law, and then around some big family dinner some one lets it slip that you had tried to manipulate a situation to alter her feelings about you... well, it could backfire.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nI Am Used Vlad - Nov 3, 2005 5:06 pm (#1533 of 2980)\n\nazi, congrats on your membership.

I wasn't really thinking I'd let her take the credit or even think this was all about her, but just that I would invite her and his sisters to join me in wishing him Happy Holidays for the sole reason that it would mean the world to him!

A friend at work told me that some of the opening night shows of Goblet of Fire were already sold out. I raced into the office after work and conferred with my fellow HP-obessive friend Nikki. She talked me into going to the midnight showing and then booking IMAX tickets for Sunday the 20th. Mr. E will watch Lexie. She still can't make it through Babe without bawling. I don't think she can see Cedric die.\n\nMy cat Samantha always threw up on the carpet.

I've experienced a lot of strategies with them and finally found out that the \"a la McGonagall\" glance added to a \"I know this is a lie, don't make things worse for yourself\" usually works till they're 7 or 8. But don't worry, if one of them is ever found on the school roof, I'll know it was emotional magic... (Funny no kid ever thought of saying that till now BTW, you know \"I don't know what happened, it must have been emotional magic\").\n\nI loved watching \"Little house\" when I was a kid!

Nov 4, 2005 5:19 am\n\nThere are three girls in my class: Aleksandra (Alexssandra), Nikolina and Matea. That are three \"popular\" girls in my class. They always stick together. They aren't really so bad in private life, and only two of them talk big, and only in school. One of them really acts \"popular\", second one sometimes just goes on nervous, but the third one seems like she doesn't belong there. She is kind, she cares about others. She is the only person I can never reject to help on exams. Because, as my (let me count) fifth homeroom teacher says: \"You can get anything if you know how to ask.\" She knows how to ask and she always says: \"Don't you dare to say me the answer before you wrote yours.\" So sweet of her. There is only one more person who can do the same to me.\n\nCongrats Azi! I would like to have premium membership. I ran out of posts twice and I would like to have an avatar.

Someone had the nerve to ask my sister if she really planned to put her daughter through another heart surgery. What does she think the alternative is anyway? Let her veins continue to dump blue blood into her heart until it completely over works itself? She thought that because my niece \"feels ok\" that the surgery is unnecessary. She acted as though my sister is actually being cruel to her child.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nThe giant squid - Nov 4, 2005 7:00 am (#1545 of 2980)\n\nkaykay, I've found that the best way to deal with that sort of person is to smile sweetly and walk away. They've already decided what is \"right\" and no amount of evidence to the contrary will convince them otherwise.\n\nFrankly, I think that anyone who makes a habit out of sharing their opinions on things when they don't have all the relevant facts should be slapped.

When Devin was going through his transplant, Ryan was actually happy to donate bone marrow (and two others cried when they didn't match and could not do it...weirdos). I had someone ask me what I would have done if Ryan had not been willing to do it on his own. I am sure I looked at them like they were not using their brain. \"He had no choice, we would have forced him.\" Hmmm, let's think. Let a 7 year old decide to not have surgery so he can exercise his free will but gee, sorry, the 5 year old has to die now. Some \"options\" really are not options and you do what you have to do.\n\nToday is showing me why I prefer to not go walking with others. Last night, a friend said she would like to come along when I go out for my morning walk today. I said sure and suggested 9. She said she would like to go earlier, I said anytime after 8 is good. She said she would call me after the bus left. It is now 8:30, I have been ready for 30 minutes and no call yet. **:sigh****\n\n_____________________________________\n\nFinn BV - Nov 4, 2005 7:38 am (#1547 of 2980)\n\nYes, Marie, I saw the movie version too.

It's too bad that this person doesn't understand the impact of what they're saying, as I understood it. I'd let it be and have them think it off themselves.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nPuck - Nov 4, 2005 8:04 am (#1548 of 2980)\n\nKaykay, I understand. I worked with a woman who thought that just about any health problem could be solved naturally without medical intervention. She commented that she didn't know what she would have done in my situation, as if it was wrong to get a pacemaker. I simply told her \"You accept medical intervention, or you die. That simple.\" Another time she balked at my saying I was ready for a second child. She thought it was horrible that I would take the chance, after Parker getting the heart condition. (He's not limited in any way, simply takes a pill.) Of course, I had to take her with a grain of salt, as this was the same woman who said the reason she spent her money so unwisely was because the toilet was in the money corner of her house, causing her to \"flush\" it away.\n\nAsk the vet about milk of magnesia or Pepto for the cat. A friend was told to do this for her cat and it put an end to years of excessive vomiting.\n\nNever thought of going to see GoF by myself.

It isn't right, it isn't fair and it sucks that she needs to have another surgery - does she really need it???? The woman was probably hopeful that it really wasn't that necessary or that it was something that could be put off until she was older.\n\nBut even the most well-intentioned folks can be bone-heads!\n\nI agree with Mike, smile sweetly and hit 'em with a brick!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nChemyst - Nov 4, 2005 12:25 pm (#1550 of 2980)\n\nI had to take her with a grain of salt, as this was the same woman who said the reason she spent her money so unwisely was because the toilet was in the money corner of her house, causing her to \"flush\" it away. – Puck\n\nIsn't she just a little Human Dynamo of Geopathic Stress! ...but she may have a point about the \"flushing.\" For a philosophy/lifestyle that claims to be as simple and down-to-earth as feng shui does, they have a lot of expensive high-tech ways to take one's money.\n\nRe: Chat & Greetings 2005\n\nLady Arabella Mon Aug 10, 2015 4:27 pm\n\n_____________________________________\n\nGood Evans - Nov 4, 2005 12:56 pm (#1551 of 2980)\n\nKaykay, definitley feeling for you and your sister.

It was later that I changed my reasons from taste to moral. My parents are not vegetarians.\n\nNoises Off was pretty good tonight, done by an amateur crowd. It was really long though, about 2 and a half hours! The set changes took forever, as those who have seen it know, the second act requires the set to be completely flipped, and the third needs it to be reversed back to the original state!

It just happens that she seems to like to turn on this kind of discussions on this thread, she has even done worse... Now, the fact is that I used to be in a similar situations when I was at school and I can say that it is really hard, when you are asked to give the right answer, to say no. The teachers keep telling us (parents) that it is not their job to raise our kids and that only parents can teach the kids what is right and what is wrong. Now, I happen to disagree with that opinion, but if it is not teachers' job to teach right from wrong, it is even less a teenage friend's job to do that. Then, I have met some teachers who think that no cheating can help a kid who has no clue on the subject and that this kind of \"helping\" makes no difference. Although, an interesting story comes to my mind... My aunt came one day to school without he Latin homework and copied it from her friend. The teacher saw her copying and called both of them to show their homeworks. It turned out that my aunt's homework didn't have any of mistakes that her friend's homework had, and a teacher had a big problem...\n\n_____________________________________\n\nCatherineHermiona - Nov 5, 2005 6:16 am (#1560 of 2980)\n\nTBE, I do help them. And when they come to me, I see how much they know. And then I ask: \"Wouldn't it be much easier to pay attention on class then coming all the way over here (I live pretty away from others)!?\". But it doesn't help. And I can't be the right person to tell them that, I'm the same way. And sometimes when they come, we study, and study, and study, but it doesn't help. Then becomes too late and they have to go home. So it can't be either mine or their fault.

I was making a funny and it looks like my little joke went awry. Sorry for any confusion.\n\nLina, I can see how frustrating it is when parents and teachers don't agree on their responsibilities. I remember teaching high school years ago, and I called a parent about the rude language and disrepectful, disruptive behavior her son exhibited. She said, \"It's not my job to teach him manners; that's your job. Besides, I work, and I don't have time.\" EEK!\n\nI think it is definitely the teacher's job to enforce academic honesty in her class. I believe that students won't engage in dishonest acts if they believe that the teacher takes such behavior seriously, and is vigilant, and will enforce consequences.\n\nMr. Catherine has a brilliant system for deterring cheating in his college class. He gives out two copies of the exam. It is very amusing to grade these exams and see the answer copied verbatim from a question three on the first test which has NOTHING to do with question three on the other test. It's self-punishing behavior, and it penalizes those who sneak peeks onto someone else's test. It also gives Mr. Catherine the evidence he needs to prove that someone did cheat, especially if the \"other\" answers are on multiple questions.\n\nOff to work \"Black Dog Day\" for the Humane Society.

There are some parents that, well, all I can do is shudder thinking of them. (*shudders again*) Actually, I don't expect anybody to raise my children for me, it is just that I know that not all parents care about how their kids behave and there I expect the school to protect my children. I could talk mountains about this subject, but this is probably not he right place.\n\nTBE, I appreciate very much your concern and must say that I agree with you. All I can add to the discussion is that I would never go hiking with \"friends\" who never do the effort to learn their own knowledge.\n\nElanor: \"don't give the answers to your friend because it won't help him in the end\"\n\nDoes it rhyme in the French too?\n\nWell, yes, \"helping\" in the exams, could not really be called help, although a little hint could sometimes help the person to remember what they actually know. Helping with homework is help, but doing the homework for someone else, that is not help at all.

I had to chuckle a little.\n\nWell, we're sick again at the E. house. We're thinking about just moving Lexie and I into a giant plastic bubble. It started Thursday night when Shayla put herself to bed at 6:30, which scared me. She said she had a headache so I gave her some Tylenol and water in case she was dehydrated (happens a lot here). She woke up 8:30, ate dinner, and was fine the next day. I woke up Friday with a horrible stomach ache and spent the whole day feeling like I'd be sick. I wanted to call in sick to work but I already knew we were short two staff. I have this silly commitment to work thing. By 3:00 I was practically asleep and then Lexie saved the day by throwing up. I'm really sorry she got sick too, but we both got to go home. Poor baby was sick a few more times at home and I went to bed and slept from 6pm to 6am. I'm better today but she's barely eaten and has been sleeping for the past five hours. I've checked on her a few times to make sure she's not feverish or dead.\n\nNow that the new movie is coming soon all the older kids at the daycare are pumping me for plot info. Most of them haven't read the books. I'm not letting anything out. For some reason a lot of them think Hermione dies, which I don't understand. I ordered a GoF poster book from a Scholastic book order and had to wrestle it away from the kids.\n\nWe had a freak snowstorm this morning which almost ruined the Veteran's Day parade. The clouds broke right before the parade started. It's supposed to be in the 60's for the next four or five days, very warm for this time of year. I'll take it!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nChemyst - Nov 5, 2005 7:42 pm (#1576 of 2980)\n\nThe story of Mr. Catherine ( and why does that sound OK but Professor Catherine sounds wrong? ) reminded me of an earth science professor I had (and for whom I am just now making this connection, but he did look a lot like Alan Rickman +25 lbs.). Anyway, one of the fraternities had purloined a copy of the mid-term. Ah, but the professor was no procrastinator and had already begun grading the first class's tests before the second class was scheduled to take the test that afternoon, and so, discovered what had happened. So the professor had made a new test over lunch but kept the form similar. Apparently some of the frat guys in the second class still answered the questions for the first one. How dumb is that?\n\nWe had gorgeous weather today and I spent a good four hours out in it working on a retaining wall along the creek bank. We had so much rain the first part of the summer that erosion had been especially bad this year. We can't, and wouldn't want to, wall in the entire creek, but there are a couple of trees whose roots were being undercut that are worth trying to save. With all the leaves turning golden now, it wasn't hard to imagine our stream as a tributary to the Silverlode in Lothlorien. If the weather continues this spectacular tomorrow, I will have to lie in the hammock and review GF as prep for the movie release.\n\nthere was a new report tonight about internet sites that sell essays and reports. I had to chuckle a little. –Marie\n\nYou know, I always thought it might be fun to supplement the income by writing essays and then letting others fret about the grade I mean, you'd get paid for doing the fun research & writing part and let your client take the fall if it didn't work, but, that wouldn't be right...\n\n_____________________________________\n\nTazzygirl - Nov 5, 2005 8:16 pm (#1577 of 2980)\n\nI mean, you'd get paid for doing the fun research and writing part and let your client take the fall if it didn't work, but, that wouldn't be right...- Chemyst\n\nThink of all those poor little students who worked hours to find the perfect ready- made essay, and just when they are so proud of their 'work', the teacher hands it back with a big red 'D' (or lower!). I can just see their faces now, upset because they just knew they would get an 'A'. heeheehee ... do you think there are people out there who actually do that? I would have to say I would not feel the slightest bit sorry for the student!!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nEponine - Nov 5, 2005 9:31 pm (#1578 of 2980)\n\nI discovered tonight that you can buy Shakespeare papers on eBay. Does that go against their policies?\n\nI mean, you'd get paid for doing the fun research & writing part and let your client take the fall if it didn't work, but, that wouldn't be right...\n\nThat would be fun. Especially since they probably wouldn't read it you could make all sorts of outlandish claims like Shakespeare wrote about cyborgs and Jane Austen wrote westerns.\n\nToday at work, I was helping someone with the microfilm reader (first time for me) and somehow ended up with half the roll of microfilm in a large pile on the floor. I couldn't get the machine to stop spinning the microfilm off the roll so I had to yank it off as it was spinning. It was quite amusing. Thankfully, I didn't ruin it.\n\nI hope everyone is having a great day.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nAmilia Smith - Nov 5, 2005 11:24 pm (#1579 of 2980)\n\nO frabjous day! Callooh! Callay! I have internet! Did you hear that? I am writing to you from my very own room. No more sneaking minutes here and there on the library computers! I can come on in the middle of the night; on weekends; in my pajamas! I can go in the chat room! Use Messenger! Yes, yes, I know . . .

How horrendous are the repairs going to be?\n\nI'm a little confused, Kate. Are you just helping your friends with their homework, or are you feeding them answers on tests? I don't see anything wrong with helping them study before hand. But once the test has been handed out, I agree with everyone else. You have to practice tough love and let you friends take what they can get on their own. I feel your pain though, as I am also \"a girl who can't say no.\" And your mother's right. It is not fair that you should feel guilty for helping them instead of them feeling guilty for asking. However, since you are the only one you can control . . .\n\nTazzy, are you sure you wouldn't mind if I horned in on your group for GoF? I feel really tacky inviting myself like this. But I really hate going to movies alone. Especially this one, where I have built myself up to much.\n\nSpeaking of movies, some of you may or may not remember my story about the local film crew coming to my Deli. Well, I thought the film was only going to be released in Utah, but guess what? It opened this weekend in Pearl City!

I have to admit it is good to be able to use the net whenever you feel like it.\n\nI went thru a rough patch in October (kinda like - Huh? where did October go???) and I couldn't sleep very well. I normally sleep 8-9 hours a night but for most of October it was 3-4 hours per night - pure torture .\n\nBelieve me it was great to be able to catch up all the changes to the lexicon and I cleaned out two fan-fiction sites of all their completed works that I was interested in reading (not including the HPL Fan-fiction forum which I completely forgot about in terms of reading fan-fic! ). All while I was in my Jammies. I do not want to see my internet usage stats for October .\n\nNow that I am over my rough patch, I am finally catching on other things like email and posting in forums . Next week is another busy week for me and then I will have the rest of November off. This is not good money wise, but after October, I think I could use some more downtime.\n\nHave a great weekend everyone!\n\nLizzy\n\n_____________________________________\n\nTazzygirl - Nov 6, 2005 1:00 am (#1581 of 2980)\n\nTazzy, are you sure you wouldn't mind in I horned in on your group for GoF?

In fact, I insist that you come! I wanted to ask you before, but as I was new I didn't know if you would want to or not. It is not a big group going- it is just me and my friend, Scott. You can't possibly go to the premiere of GoF by yourself!!! (it's just not done... ) and it will be great to have another big fan of HP (Scott doesn't get as excited as I do about such things ) What most likely is going to happen is we will meet at Ward at around 7:30 pm (my class gets out at 7), and then kill the four hours waiting at Buca de Beppo's, getting something to eat. I just checked online, and I am going to go ahead and get three tickets (just so then we are guaranteed a spot in the theater!) So you have to come, no matter what! Let me know if that works for you.

Are you just helping your friends with their homework, or are you feeding them answers on tests?—Mills\n\nAfter Kate's last post, I was wondering the same thing. if we're just talking about homework, then I think the group's been a little harsh on the poor girl. Her friends still should be learning the stuff themselves instead of letting Kate do the thinking for them, but tutoring is perfectly acceptable. Here in the states (and, I think, in the UK as well) \"exam\" refers to the actual tests. You know, \"Put your books away and pick up your #2 pencil. You have 1 hour to complete this...\"\n\nMarie, is it \"sick\" time already? Have you had your annual bout of bronchitis yet? I'm a little under the weather myself, having come down with a severe case of ennui It's not that I don't want to go to work, I just don't want to go anywhere.

Are you just helping your friends with their homework, or are you feeding them answers on tests?--Mills [...\n\n...] After Kate's last post, I was wondering the same thing... Mike\n\nI think Kate meant both. Her English is very clear. She starts out helping her friends study (which is good) but then as they run short on time, they ask her to finish their homework for them, (probably appealing to her pride in being a good student,) and she often gives in and does it. (A truly good friend would not abuse the friendship by getting the other person to do their work for them.) Sometimes her friends get grades on homework she has done or had partially done for them; so when they get grades for her work, that is also cheating, even if it is not a test or exam. She has also given them test answers sometimes, (which is definitely cheating.) So she needs to either learn how to say 'no' to her friends' requests to do their homework for them, or find some better friends that don't ask her to cheat.\n\nHave I got that right, Kate?\n\nAnd then there had been a separate but related question about plagiarism; I think if you translate someone else's work, you should still put in a footnote that you used their idea, but then add \"Translated by Kate\" in the footnote so you get full credit for that.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nCatherineHermiona - Nov 6, 2005 7:10 am (#1586 of 2980)\n\nYou got that right, Chemyst. And I really should start to practice word 'no', you are right. But, as Amilia, I sometimes 'can't say no'. And if that doesn't work, new friends. But there are pupils I wouldn't help on exam even if my life depends on it. There is pupil in my class that just comes and tells me: \"Give me the answer!\" or \"Give me your homework!\". Then I can without thinking say: \"In your dreams!\". But when they say magic word 'please'........\n\nAnd on plagiarism thing, when I translate it, it's pretty much my work.\n\nI'm in the chat room now. Kate\n\nno, no, no, no, no, no, no,................\n\n_____________________________________\n\nCatherine - Nov 6, 2005 7:38 am (#1587 of 2980)\n\nLOL about \"Professor Catherine,\" Chemyst, and about the frat guys who were so clueless that they wrote the answers from the wrong test.\n\nMr. Catherine is always amazed when someone does this. He gets an almost fiendish enjoyment when he passes back the first test and says, \"We'll go over version A of the test first.\" What's great is that even if the alleged copying was only on a few questions, (and harder to prove) they lose points anyway. Mr. Catherine also appreciates that the students cannot try to weasel partial credit (which he gives on longer problems) without drawing attention to the fact that their answer is from the other version of the test and has absolutely nothing to do with the question at hand.\n\n** sends bubble-head charms to the Marie E. family to stop the spread of germs ** Stay well!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nSolitaire - Nov 6, 2005 9:09 am (#1588 of 2980)\n\nI just wanted to post and tell those of you who know him that I've been in touch with MickeyCee. His name came up in a search I did for something last week, at which point I realized I had not seen him around for a while. A further search showed me he had not posted since before HBP. I remembered that he lived in Louisiana, so I crossed my fingers and emailed him.\n\nI have since heard from him a couple of times. The condensed version of things: Although Katrina missed their home, a tornado that spawned inside Rita completely wiped out their neighborhood and destroyed their home. The only things they were able to save were his computer and a dining room set. He told me that he and his wife have relocated to Houston and are seeking new jobs and looking for a new home.\n\nMickey said he is not up to posting just yet, but he is trying to keep up with the forum. I am sure he probably checks this thread, and I thought there might be some others who want to post greetings.\n\nHang in there, Mickey! We're pulling for you, TBE, and all of the other \"Forum-ers\" who've been hit. You're in our prayers!\n\nSolitaire\n\n_____________________________________\n\nMadam Pince - Nov 6, 2005 9:25 am (#1589 of 2980)\n\nWelcome back, TBE! So glad to hear the good news about your house, and I hope that you can soon get things more settled! It's so awful to contemplate -- a storm can only take hours to ruin people's lives, and it can take months and months or even longer to fix... arrrrgh. Anyway, sending out good thoughts your way!\n\nAnd the same good thoughts go out to Mickey Cee! Thanks for that research, Solitaire!\n\nMarie, sorry to hear about the \"sickies\" already! Ugh, what a yucky way to spend a weekend. Hope everyone's well soon!\n\nShe said, \"It's not my job to teach him manners; that's your job. Besides, I work, and I don't have time.\" --parent in Catherine's class.\n\nThat just totally floors me! I cannot imagine what I would say to a parent who said that to me, but I'm sure it probably would have ended up in my being fired. What in the world did you do? I mean, someone chooses to be a parent but then \"doesn't have time\" to teach them manners???? Wonder where the kid learned his rude behavior? Oh that's right -- that didn't take any extra time to teach, did it?\n\nMy ultimate goal in life is to do absolutely nothing and get paid obscenely well to do it! --Squid Mike.....\n\nMike, I am laughing so hard! I was once on a panel of people interviewing someone for a job, and that's actually what he told us when we asked him what he could see himself doing in the position five years from now if we hired him! And he was dead serious -- he wasn't even trying to just lighten the mood of the interview or something! We all just sat there and looked at him -- none of us knew what to say! After we politely told him \"not to call us, we'd call him,\" I wanted so badly to run after him, grab him in the hall, shake him, and tell him to wake up and learn some interview skills! He was probably one of the fraternity boys who copied on his exams!\n\nI'm not going to step in on the \"helping / cheating\" debate too much here -- I agree with what seems to be the general consensus: helping or tutoring shows great friendship and support and is to be encouraged; doing work for someone or giving answers during a test is absolutely not cool. Another similar real-life example is one that is going on in our community now -- the local fire departments are being pressured to \"lower\" the physical requirements for being a firefighter so that less-physically-strong applicants can be given jobs. For example, if \"normally\" the firefighter must be able to lift and carry 125 pounds, there are people who think that's just \"too much\" and it's \"not fair\" to those who aren't able to carry that. All I can say is, if I'm unconscious in a burning house and the firefighter who comes in to save me is unable to lift me, then I'm going to be pretty bummed out! Now if that fire dept. employee is being interviewed to be a dispatcher or whatever -- fine. But the powers-that-be are seriously considering reducing the physical requirements for the firefighter jobs that actually require physical ability. Arrrrrgh.... don't get me started. I'm all for equality -- just be sure that you can actually DO the job! Every job has different requirements -- find one that fits your abilities rather than adjusting the job requirements to fit your ability, particularly if it's a \"life or death\" kind of job! It's not a discrimination thing, it's a practical thing! OK, /rant.\n\n***Is happy that Lizzy and Mills are having things go right for them and are happy, too!***\n\nLina, I love your avatar!

I can't think of anything more to add to be honest.\n\nEveryone have a great day/evening!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nSolitaire - Nov 6, 2005 10:00 am (#1591 of 2980)\n\nPlease tell Mr. Catherine I like his style! I teach junior high and am currently seeing more cheating and copying than ever before. Last week we were listening to the CD of The Highwayman in my language arts classes. The kids had an in-class assignment to do immediately following it, so they were supposed to be reading and doing my work.\n\nAs I trolled through the room, I noticed one of my best students working away on her social studies assignment. I quietly picked up that book and put it under her desk, opened her language arts book to the appropriate page, and then took the papers she'd been working on back to my desk. After class, I noticed that she had another top student's homework and was copying it. She was irritated when I would not give back the work; I told her I'd give it directly to the social studies teacher myself (I did) with an explanation of how I came to have it. We all have consistent policies on such things, so I knew how she would react.\n\nThe student was upset the next day and said it was my fault she got a zero on the assignment, because I would not let her leave the room and get her own book so she could do the work herself! She couldn't seem to own the fact that she should not have been doing other work in my class when she had LA work to do. (I do let kids work on other things when they satisfy me that they have finished what I've given them and are caught up on all other things we are doing ... but this was not such a case.)\n\nThe next day, in another class, I saw that one student had put his quiz paper face up on the corner of his desk, and the student sitting in the next row was blatantly leaning over and copying his answers! The copier was extremely indignant when I took both papers and told the kids they had a grade of zero. He informed me that he hadn't copied all of the answers ... only about half of them. So he should get half credit! I just looked at him and tried hard not to say what I was really thinking. Two weeks before, I'd caught a student red-handed with a cheat-sheet under her test paper. I guess the time has come for me to do the Version A, Version B thing, too.\n\nWhen I am looking at homework and see word-for-word answers from several students, I call the culprits back to my work area for a chat. I tell them that one person has obviously done the work, so there will be one set of points assigned to the whole group. I then open my gradebook, get out my pen, and ask how they would like the points divided. At this point, the one who has actually done the work usually rats out the others. It's kind of a cheap trick, but it often gets results.\n\nI am greatly bothered by what I perceive as a complete lack of ethics among kids. What is worse, I teach in a rural school that has high parent involvement (almost like a private school), no gangs, and generally good kids. If it is like that here, what must it be like in other schools?\n\nSolitaire\n\n_____________________________________\n\nMadam Pince - Nov 6, 2005 10:03 am (#1592 of 2980)\n\nI tried to edit but it won't let me for some reason....\n\nI just had one other thought, Kate. Back in my day (egads that makes me sound old!), we used to go up to the teacher's desk and beg her for \"hints\" during tests, but we didn't ask each other for hints! Could you suggest this to your friends? Let the teacher make the decision as to what \"hints\" would be acceptable or not. Lina is right that the people who \"ask\" should certainly be feeling guilty, too. Also, perhaps the teacher could be made aware of the situation so that he/she could exercise some influence? That might take some of the pressure off you to say \"no.\" You wouldn't have to name names necessarily.\n\nSolitaire, I share your concern. It is really troubling -- more so not even that it's happening period, but that they don't even see why it is a problem. Lack of ethics really carries through into all areas of life, and it is very worrisome to me.\n\nMaybe it's sappy, but perhaps the \"Little House\" books should be required reading in all schools. They didn't seem to have the same ethics dilemmas back then!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nLupin is Lupin. Natch. - Nov 6, 2005 11:17 am (#1593 of 2980)\n\nThey didn't seem to have the same ethics dilemmas back then!---Madam Pince\n\nLOL Yeah, well, that's just because she left them out! As long as there's been temptation, there's been cheating. Unfortunately, there seems to be a dearth of role models in today's society.

Do you know what movie, or is it something minor?\n\nAs I was reading back to your linked post, I must chime in I also love the movie Clue. …so she ran down the hall and stabbed the cook! … Husbands should be like Kleenex: soft, strong, and disposable. … Well, I had to stop her from screaming! … Mrs. Peacock was a man?\n\n_____________________________________\n\nTazzygirl - Nov 6, 2005 1:21 pm (#1596 of 2980)\n\nMills- Yeay! I can't wait to meet you too.

However, I also have some wonderful and very charming kids, too. In fact, the majority of my students are good; it's just that a small minority can make teaching a big headache some days.\n\nI am more fortunate than many of my friends who teach. For one thing, we have a wonderful principal who has tremendous respect for our teachers. He likes our input, and he usually heeds what we say. I also like our location (except for the heat in summer). I teach in a relatively small rural school in central California. We are surrounded on all sides by almond and pistachio orchards, cotton fields, and alfalfa fields.\n\nAlthough some of our rooms are in dire need of refurbishing, our outdoor campus is beautiful, if somewhat older. We have lots of basketball courts, a football and a soccer field, a regulation track, a swimming pool, baseball diamonds, tetherball courts, swings, monkey bars, and lots of grassy areas and trees. We have a wonderful after-school sports program with talented and generous coaches and lots of parent volunteers. Friends of mine who teach in urban areas of Los Angeles and Orange County are envious.\n\nThe ethics issues among our kids, however, are troubling. But it is so difficult to address anything like values in schools these days, given new laws and restrictions.\n\nSolitaire\n\n_____________________________________\n\nLina - Nov 6, 2005 3:27 pm (#1598 of 2980)\n\nMickey Cee, some settling charms sent your way! And repairing charms to all who need it!\n\nI could agree that the ethics is becoming weaker day by day, although I thought it was happening only here, because of the war and some other circumstances. It is just that I don't remember anybody in my class expecting me to do their work for them (helping, a lot, but doing something for them???) and now I do meet a lot of people at my work who do expect other people to do their jobs. When you know that the boss is well aware of the fact and doesn't seem to care, and you know that you will feel the consequences if the job isn't done, you don't feel as you can do much to change it... You can just hope for a wiser boss. You can change a job, of course, but then you have to weight the pros and contras.\n\nWhen it comes to cheating, I do blame it on the teachers. They have the power to stop it or to encourage it. There will always be the kids who will think than they can outsmart the teachers. As with puppies, you have to show them that they can't do it right from the beginning. We have had the A and B (sometimes even C and D) groups of tests since forever. Kids know that they can copy just from the kids who sit in front or behind them and not from the kids who sit at the same desk, but still, there are kids who do both the tests and pass the answers to the others. There must be something wrong with that kind of tests. Some kids just do get a poor education at home and teachers can do wonders with them. The parents should be included, if possible. Some time ago, in my town, one father came to the school and broke the nose to the teacher who expected his daughter to learn his subject well enough to get the passing grade. So, all you teachers without such experience should consider yourselves lucky!\n\nA great new week to everybody!\n\nEdit: Solitaire: The ethics issues among our kids, however, are troubling.

It means a lot to me.\n\nYour right Soli, the lack of ethics, sense of responsibility, and values lacking in such a large percentage of youth is scary. And it has been coming for 30+ years. Like Lina pointed out, is common in the work force now too. Liberal laws that have taken all control from parents and teachers began the slide down a very slippery slope. Can't offend or hurt the little darlings feelings dontcha know? ;-)\n\nRe: Chat & Greetings 2005\n\nLady Arabella Mon Aug 10, 2015 4:30 pm\n\n_____________________________________\n\nMadam Pince - Nov 6, 2005 7:11 pm (#1601 of 2980)\n\nYes, it is certainly not a new thing. And Kate, please don't feel like anybody's \"singling you out\" or anything, because you're certainly not alone -- it's just that you're here within earshot. You are just a good soul who wants to be kind and helpful.\n\nAnother way to look at it that might help you a bit is to think that these people are really taking advantage of you. They know you are kind and helpful, and they are pressing that to their full advantage. Besides the fact that it's basically wrong, there's really nothing in it for you, either. (How's that for being Slytherin? ) Things like this have been happening for years. When I worked outside my home, probably in the mid-1990's, we had an onslaught of young newly-hired employees who thought they were \"entitled\" to the same salary as the people who were department heads, even though they were working at an office assistant position. They felt that they were just as \"smart\" and just as \"educated\" so they should make the same salary. It would have been laughable if it hadn't been so pitiful. They just didn't get it that you need to DO THE WORK to earn the pay. These friends of yours, Kate, will need to learn the same lesson.\n\nAlthough, maybe not. As Lina noted, sometimes bosses don't really care if some employees slack off, as long as another employee is conscientious (dumb?) enough to take up the slack -- the work is getting done, so why does the boss care exactly who does the lion's share? I know -- I've been in the \"dumb\" category before. I worked with a lady whose job was ordering the product needed in our department, and my job was paying the bills after the fact. Her job absolutely had to be done, or else our dept. would grind to a halt. My job was not as crucial time-wise (to us, anyway.) So whenever she would go on vacation, I was forced to do her job, as well as mine, and she would come back from vacation all refreshed and with a clean desk. Whenever I would go on vacation, she would not pay one single bill, and then I would return to a desk piled high with unpaid bills that needed to go out ASAP. It was so totally unfair, but because I was young and meek and inexperienced and felt the responsibility, I ended up getting dumped on. So this is just the voice of experience, Kate!\n\n***Suddenly feels very very very old....*** ((((Gives Kate big hugs))))\n\n_____________________________________\n\nLoopy Lupin - Nov 6, 2005 8:36 pm (#1602 of 2980)\n\nMr. Catherine has actually gotten praise from his students that he \"encourages\" honesty and \"discourages\" cheating. Thank goodness some students realize the value of integrity.- Catherine\n\nMy question is what is the penalty for getting caught in Mr. Catherine's class? I mean other than the blinding by laser point. It is here that I think the Honor Code at me alma mater, UVa, deserves some praise. Expulsion is the penalty and the only penalty. This certainly doesn't mean that cheating does not occur at UVa or any other school with a single penalty system. It doesn't even mean that cheating occurs, necessarily, with less frequency. But, it did and, I'm sure, still does make one think twice about it.\n\nI'm also confused by what laws and restrictions are in place that hamper one from teaching \"values\" or \"ethics\" in school today. I'm not a teacher, so I'm honestly more curious about those statements than I am trying to start an argument. (I would never do that of course ) Certainly, there are laws and restrictions that would prevent one from placing \"values\" into a particular religious context. All things considered, that is as it should be. But, what prevents today's teachers from explaining that lying, cheating and stealing are wrong?\n\n_____________________________________\n\nI Am Used Vlad - Nov 6, 2005 9:11 pm (#1603 of 2980)\n\nI would never do that of course\n\nNo comment.\n\nI think the current topic could easily erupt into a political debate. We all probably think that \"values\" and \"ethics\" are important, but discussing how they should be instilled into children, or laws that prevent us from doing so, could easily get out of hand. This is, of course, just my opinion, which I am well aware holds no sway here.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nPigwidgeon - Nov 6, 2005 9:14 pm (#1604 of 2980)\n\nAllow me to chime in on this from another angle.\n\nI do not for a moment condone cheating or slacking off at a job. But consider our society now. 30 years ago, most of your population worked at one place and stayed there, retiring after their allotted years. Nowadays, that is nearly impossible. You have children growing up with fathers who have been laid off, grandparents losing their pensions, aunts and uncles seeing their jobs outsourced and older siblings or cousins having a hard time finding anything beyond low-wage service sector jobs. Why should the younger generations care about doing a good job? With a few exceptions, company loyalty doesn't mean anything anymore, so why should their employees feel obligated to go above and beyond the minimum? It certainly isn't rewarded.\n\nToday, children are taught to proficiency tests and other standardized exams. If they pass, all is well. If a school system does poorly, it is penalized and never mind the possible reasons for the poor performance. There is little time to teach students to become lifelong learners, only the cookie-cutter curriculum is doled out. Education, for even the honest young people, is a means to an end. This is not the fault of the teachers, but of the nincompoops at the state and federal level who fancy themselves education experts without ever setting foot into a classroom.\n\nThe problems with ethics go beyond the classroom and even the home. Those are only two small pieces of the puzzle. If corporate America gripes about the younger generations not being up to snuff, the leaders need to take a long hard look in the mirror and acknowledge that they are a big part of the problem. If cheating has become more prevalent and even accepted, we need to look at the underlying reasons why. Are students encouraged to learn on their own, in the way they learn best? Or are they force-fed a state/federally mandated curriculum emphasizing high-stakes test scores over real learning?\n\nAnd what are the younger generations learning from the so-called leaders of society? The executives who let companies go belly-up while collecting million dollar bonuses? Sports stars and celebrities who get a slap on the wrist from the law because they can afford the best lawyers?\n\nLet's face it, the society has become dog-eat-dog, where the ends justify the means. And we are all the poorer because of it.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nYdnam96 - Nov 6, 2005 11:38 pm (#1605 of 2980)\n\nSo to change the topic rather abruptly...\n\nI had a rather productive weekend. I cleaned my entire apartment, did some shopping for birthdays coming up and some much needed clothes. I also did some work for work. I'm pleased with myself\n\nThe weather has been strange here in Southern California. It's been in the 70's during the day but super hazy/smokey/foggy-like. But it's great at night. It's getting chilly enough to wear long sleeves and cuddle up in a blanket. I love it.\n\nDid anyone see tonight's Extreeme Makeover Home Edition? I thought it was a good one. They donated all the good stuff from the house to Habitat, which I think is great.\n\nOkay, it's pretty close to bedtime. Have a great week all!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nAmilia Smith - Nov 7, 2005 12:25 am (#1606 of 2980)\n\nGlad you had a good weekend, Mandy.\n\nFinn, the movie is called Mobsters and Mormons, so yeah, it is pretty much a niche movie, which is why I was so surprised to see it released outside of Utah. The basic premise is that a New York mafia type turns state evidence, gets put in the witness protection program, and moved to Utah. Culture shock ensues. The reviews I've read say it is predictable, but still funny.\n\nMills.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nThe giant squid - Nov 7, 2005 2:39 am (#1607 of 2980)\n\nMadame Pince, if it helps any I'm right behind you on the job restriction thing. There's a reason firefighters are required to lift that much, as you pointed out. It kinda goes with the ethics discussion--rather than find a job they can fit (or work to make themselves meet the requirements) people are demanding that standards be lowered to fit them.\n\nBread & circuses...it's all downhill from here.\n\nI'll leave the classroom ethics discussion alone, except to say that I wish I'd had Mr. Catherine for a teacher when I was in school, and that most kids these days need to be spanked.\n\n--Mike\n\n_____________________________________\n\nLina - Nov 7, 2005 3:13 am (#1608 of 2980)\n\nLoopy Lupin: I'm also confused by what laws and restrictions are in place that hamper one from teaching \"values\" or \"ethics\" in school today.\n\nForgive me if I think that I can answer the question without starting a political debate. The aim of the \"laws and restrictions\" that are discussed, is to prevent teachers like Umbridge to do as they wish. I can really talk about Croatia, but as I see some comments of the teachers here, it seems that it is similar all around the World.\n\n“Expulsion is the penalty and the only penalty.” For one thing, this is not possible here until the kid is 16. Next, it is not allowed to punish the kid for a misbehavior with a bad mark. It is not allowed to raise your voice or give a kid detention like staying in the corner for 5 minutes (which is quite helpful with younger kids). There are just so many things that are not allowed that the teachers rightfully wonder what they may do? It is not impossible to enforce the \"values\" or \"ethics\", it just requires much more energy and, well, not all the teachers have that energy, so some just give up, say what they have to say about their subject and don't try to influence kids on the values that actually exist regardless of the religion or anything else.\n\nIt is so nice to have a school, like Solitaire, where the principal cares about the children's welfare and supports the teachers in their efforts to help this kids become respectful people. It is not the case with all the schools. My experience, having two children in two different schools, shows that it is possible that two schools, only few hundreds of meters far from each other, can be diametrically different and all I can do at the moment is cry that I ever set my foot in the first one. That's why I feel so much like discussing it, because it is bothering me very much at the moment. And I wish I could do something to change the situation and I feel so helpless. So forgive me again.\n\nThe fact that TBE made her remark on Kate's post, shows that she cares and that she believes that the things can be changed and that's what brings some optimism in life.\n\nPigwidgeon, I must say that I agree with most of your post except for localizing it only to America. I used to blame communism for that. So, if it is any comfort to you, these things don't happen only in America. My humble opinion is that we still can change it just by caring about our neighbors for the beginning and doing things like They donated all the good stuff from the house to Habitat, which I think is great. (Mandy)\n\nGlad about your weekend, Mandy.
