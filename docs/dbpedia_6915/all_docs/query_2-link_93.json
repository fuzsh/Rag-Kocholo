Attributes such as nobility and dignity were portrayed through stance, gesture, and attire, and portraits often involved elaborate costumes and props.

Although we are conditioned to believe that the purpose or function of a photograph is to provide a commentary or text about a subject, that need not be the case: it may have nothing to do with making a concrete statement, answering a speciﬁc question, or even being about something. Rather, it can be something uniquely in and of itself. A photograph may be enigmatic, or it may allow a viewer access to something remarkable that could not be perceived or understood in another way. It is analogous to what Isadora Duncan, the mother of modern dance, said: “If I could explain to you what I meant there would be no reason to dance.” Think of a photograph as a conversation among the photographer, the subject, and the viewer. During such a conversation, the participants not only exchange words but also formulate meaning based on the context of how the words are spoken, to whom they are spoken, the body language of the participants, and the environment 1.1 “This series questions what defines an image as a photograph, and in fact, asks what is a camera? In my work there is no distinction between a ‘pure’ photograph and a digitally created image, as the medium of photography has been built upon the practice of change, especially in relation to technological advancement. In this series, the only instrument used for creation was a flatbed scanner (as camera), and another traditional artist tool — the hand — within the photographic editing environment.” © Liz Lee.

When the participants think about a speciﬁc subject or image, a distillation and reﬁnement of meaning becomes possible. Such thinking involves the creative interaction among the participants in a visual conversation and can lead to deﬁnition. Deﬁnition allows us to acknowledge, take responsibility, and act to solve a problem, respond to the aesthetics, or reach a conclusion about what an imagemaker deemed signiﬁcant.

Our notions about how we understand images have also undergone substantial changes, as we have come to realize that there are no neutral photographs. All depictions have a particular bias. Photography has three distinct kinds of bias. The ﬁrst bias comes from the people who create and manufacture the commonly used photographic systems, which include the cameras, lenses, consumable supplies, and ancillary equipment that the vast majority of photographers relies on to physically produce a photographic image. These companies set up the 1.2 Enfield created a technical dialogue between the 19th and 21st centuries by using an 8 ¥ 10 inch view camera with a 5 ¥ 7 inch back to expose a collodion wet-plate, which she scanned and output as an inkjet print.

The second predilection comes from the prejudices of the photographer who uses these systems to create speciﬁc images. Every photograph reveals the “photographer’s eye” — a combination of the subject, the photographer, and the process.

The collodion, or wet-plate, process that became the major commercial photographic method of the 1850s had a low sensitivity to light, which resulted in long exposure times that made group portrait making difﬁcult. The wet plate’s limited sensitivity to blue and ultraviolet light made it impossible to make naturalistic, full tonal range landscapes. If the exposure for the subject or landscape was correct, the sky would be grossly overexposed, and when printed it would appear at best as a mottled white. Combination printing was developed to overcome such inherent technical problems. Separate exposures were made for the subject and the sky and, through the use of masking, printed on a single piece of paper. This technique received a great deal of notice with Oscar Gustave Rejlander’s Two Ways of Life (1857): a tableau vivant (living picture) or staged image of a group of people arranged to represent a scene\n\n1.5 Utilizing the tableau vivant, Witt digitally composites himself as a character to explore his own anxieties, desires, humor, and trepidations. This format, which references the ability of the subconscious mind to combine elements from different events and places, allows Witt to transform the everyday into the uncanny.

This type of printing was favored by the Pictorialists and championed through the work and writing of Alfred Maskell and Robert Demachy in Photo Aquatint, or The Gum Bichromate Process (1897). The Pictorialists stressed the atmospheric and formal effects of the image over that of the subject matter. Composition and tonal values were of paramount concern. Soft-focus lenses were used to emphasize surface pattern rather than detail. Pictorialists did not want to be bound by the tyranny of exactitude. These expressive printmakers favored elaborate processes to show that photography was not a mere mechanical process, but could be controlled by the hand of the maker and therefore was a legitimate visual art form. The Pictorialists’ attitudes and procedures dominated much commercial portrait and illustrative work throughout the ﬁrst part of the twentieth century, with an emphasis on constructing beauty as opposed to ﬁnding it in nature.\n\nThe Photo-Secessionists In the United States, the Pictorialists were followed by the PhotoSecessionists, under the leadership of Alfred Stieglitz. In their quest to have photography recognized as an art form, they experimented with a wide variety of inventive printmaking methods.\n\n1.6 “When I was a small girl, I imagined that my perfect other, my doppelganger perfect friend, lived in my house. I could speak and play with him, but never see him. As I grew older, he became the perfect father, brother, or boyfriend. As I entered puberty, I began to fear that I would never meet him, and, if I did, how he would change my life. This is a story about that transitional period in childhood when gender moves from a reflection of self to the other. Working with Photoshop allowed for greater enhancement and utilization of images that would otherwise not work for the final gum bichromate process. For instance, before Photoshop negatives, color originals could not be used, as the traditional film was insensitive to large parts of the spectrum.” © Kay Kenny.

Strand had successfully incorporated the concepts of painterly abstraction directly into the idea of straight, sharp-focus, nonmanipulative photography. Strand believed that photography’s raison d’être was its “absolute unqualiﬁed objectivity” and that this could be found by investigating photography’s own inherent characteristics. The emphasis of the art of photography switched from post-exposure methods to creating the image in the camera at the moment of exposure and maintaining a much narrower range of simpliﬁed printmaking techniques.\n\nModernistic Approaches Documentary Modern documentary photography practice developed during the 1930s in the pioneering work of Jacob Riis in the slums of New York City and Lewis Hine’s depictions of immigrants arriving at Ellis Island and children being forced to work in inhuman conditions instead of\n\n1.7 Although not a traditional documentary, World in a Jar: War & Trauma (consisting of 850 individual jarred images) pays homage to the documentary tradition and expands the genre into a postmodern form.

I am not redefining an image as much as I am inquiring into metaphysical contradictions and opposing social forces that swirl around each image.

Their use of blur, grain, movement, and off-kilter compositions gave photographers a new structure for discovering new content and creating innovative, formal ways of making photographs through the picture-making process. This approach to photographing the social landscape in the 1960s was summed up by street photographer Gary Winogrand’s remark: “I photograph to ﬁnd out what something will look like photographed.” The social landscape is a personalized response to life that incorporates the informal artistic qualities of the snapshot to comment on “people and people things.” Diane Arbus used what was commonly known as the snapshot aesthetic to challenge the deﬁnition of what it means to be human and confront us with the “secret” that nobody is “normal.” The snapshot aesthetic refers to the practice of professional photographers intentionally adopting the immediate and spontaneous conventions of the family snapshot into their photographs.\n\nThe Alternative Scene The mid-1960s was a time of experimentation in many aspects of\n\n1.8 Schneider updates Winogrand by wanting to “see what things look like scanned.

During this era, Cindy Sherman made a series of photographs, Untitled Film Stills (1977–1980), that featured and thus questioned female stereotypes based on 1950s ﬁlm adver1.9 Since the early 1960s, Christenberry has used a Kodak 127 Brownie camera to plumb the regional identity of the American South, focusing primarily on Hale County where he came of age. Christenberry’s ritual documentation of “home” evokes pensive memories and scrutinizes scenes that unwaveringly record the physical changes brought about by nature and time without evoking nostalgia, establishing a connection between the past and the present. Each fleeting and simple structure can be considered a sculpture, an anxious agent for aging, decay, fragility, insecurity, and shifting purpose, as well as a signifier for the closing of a way of life.

Sherman’s work exempliﬁes a movement by women and minorities to picture their own identity rather than having it imposed by society. Another example of this is Carrie Mae Weems’s photographic work, which explores issues about who we are and how we got to be that way from the perspective of African-American culture and experience. By the 1990s, postmodernism had also challenged the notion of separate, speciﬁc boundaries for different media and encouraged the cross pollenization of mediums, giving rise to new and widespread use of installations that\n\nMetzker, Bea Nettles, and John Wood rejected the notion of a single,\n\nincorporated photographs, three-dimensional and found objects, pro-\n\nﬁxed perspective and actively sought alternative viewpoints.\n\njected images, and sound.\n\nThe Rise of Color Photography\n\nElectronic Imaging: New Ways of Thinking\n\nIn the 1970s, the alternative innovations challenged the dominance\n\nDigital imaging started to surface in the scientiﬁc community during\n\nof the straight, black-and-white print as the ﬁne art standard.

Then the image is allowed to oxidize and produce a corrosive effect to which she adds oil paint. Next, the original magazine and Mordancage images are scanned, combined, and manipulated in Photoshop.

Yet it was not until the late 1980s, with the advent of affordable home computer graphics workstations, that digital image manipulation became a viable means for creating photographs. Digital image manipulation has removed the burden of absolute truth from photography. By doing so, it has revolutionized how images are created and generated a conceptual shift from a medium that records reality to one that can transform it. In the late 1960s, Sonia Landy Sheridan incubated the notion of a Generative Systems Department at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. It was conceived to provide artists and scientists the opportunity to investigate new means of image production that included electrostatic photocopy machines, video, and computer-generated images, and it offered its ﬁrst course in 1970.

This panoramic view was created by combining 165 images taken by the Cassini wide-angle camera over nearly three hours on September 15, 2006. Color in the view was created by digitally compositing ultraviolet, infrared and clear filter images and was then adjusted to resemble natural color.” Such space images made by astronauts and unmanned remote controlled cameras have had a noticeable influence on photographic practice.

During the 19th century, people believed the stationary camera was a reliable and automatic witness. The photographer’s job was to make “every person” views, photographs that acted as stand-ins, witnessing a scene and depicting what you would have observed had you been an eyewitness.

The German artist Joseph Beuys said it best: “Once you’ve got an idea, the rest is simple.” Step back from the familiar to better understand it. One peril facing photographers is a lack of commitment that translates into indifference in their work. Talking, thinking, and writing about photography are vital components of understanding the process, but these activities do not make one a photographer. Ultimately, to be a photographer one must act and fully engage in the process of making photographs (usually lots of them). 2. Why is photography important?

An engaging image contains within it the capacity to sensitize and stimulate our latent exploratory senses. Such a photograph asserts ideas and perceptions that we recognize as our own but could not have given concrete form to without having ﬁrst seen that image. 6. How is the meaning of a photograph determined? Meaning is not intrinsic. Meaning is established through a ﬂuid cogitative and emotional relationship among the maker, the photograph, and the viewer. The structure of a photograph can communicate before it is understood. A good image teaches one how to read it by provoking responses from the viewers’ inventory of life experiences, as meaning is not always found in things, but sometimes between them. An exceptional photograph creates viewer focus that produces attention, which can lead to deﬁnition. As one meditates on what is possible, multiple meanings may begin to present themselves. The result is that meaning, like the weather, is local; viewers interpret images based on their own understanding of the world, 1.18 Talbitzer uses herself as the subject to produce tangible evidence of the human condition that is unseen or indescribable. “For me words fail the complexity of the human emotional landscape. This failure is why my images exist. They communicate complicated feeling using symbolism that is both personal and universal and free from the burden of concrete meaning. What makes me human is also what makes viewers human. I cultivate that connection with heavily manipulated images that still appear photographically true while obviously defeating that truth.” © Shelia Talbitzer.

How can photographers know and deﬁne beauty and truth in the 21st century? Beauty is the satisfaction of knowing the imprimatur of this moment. Although beauty and truth are based in time and may exist only for an instant, photographers can capture a trace of this interaction for viewers to contemplate. Such photographs can authenticate an experience and allow us to reﬂect upon it and gain deeper meaning. During the past 25 years, issues of gender, globalization, identity, race, and sexuality have been predominant because previously they\n\n2 1\n\nWHY\n\nW E\n\nMAK E\n\nP ICT UR E S :\n\nA\n\nCO N CI S E\n\nH I S T O R Y\n\nOF\n\nV I S U A L\n\nI D EA S\n\nhad been neglected. In terms of the practice of digital imaging, the artistic ramiﬁcations have been the overriding concern. But whether an imagemaker uses analog silver-based methods to record reality or pixels to transform it, the two greatest issues that have concerned imagemakers for thousands of years — beauty and personal truth — have receded into the background, especially in academic settings, where irony has been the major form of artistic expression. Beauty is not a myth, in the sense of just being a cultural construct or creation of manipulative advertisers, but a basic, hard-wired part of human nature. Our passionate pursuit of beauty has been observed for centuries and should not be ignored simply because it can’t be scientiﬁcally measured. The history of ideas can be represented in terms of visual pleasure. In pre-Christian times, Plato recognized the three wishes of every person: “to be healthy, to be rich by honest means, and to be beautiful.” More recently, American philosopher George Santayana postulated that there must be “in our very nature a very radical and widespread tendency to observe beauty, and to value it.” Although elusive, there are certain visual patterns that can be observed that deﬁne a personal truth (a conclusion beyond doubt). When we recognize an individual truth, it may grab hold and bring us to a complete stop — a total mental and physical halt from what we were doing — while simultaneously producing a sense of clarity and certainty that eliminates the need for future questioning and reinforces the genuine voluble role that art plays in our lives. 8.
