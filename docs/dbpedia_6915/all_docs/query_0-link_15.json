        "meta_description": "The report is written by the Emergency Defense Council of the Seattle branch of the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) in order to provide an accurate portrayal of the Japanese in Washington State to the Tolan Committee as they make decisions on the evacuation of the Japanese from the West Coast. The authors write \"We present this report in the hopes that the facts and figures contained in it may assist the Congressional Committee to make its decision on the issue of evacuation of Japanese nationals and their citizen children in a matter most advantageous to the war effort of the United States, and in keeping with the traditions of fairness and justice that all Americans hold dear.\" The report touches on topics of the Japanese in American economic life (including statistics on Japanese farmers and business owners); public opinion regarding the Japanese; and reasons for their opposition to evacuation. They state that evacuating the Japanese population based on race is akin to the unjust racial segregation utilized by Hitler. In concluding the report, the authors write \"If it is for the greater good that evacuation be decreed, we shall obey to the best of our ability. But, we are convinced that here in our homes and in our community is where we belong, where we can lend every ounce of our strength, and every cent of our resources, in creating the sinews of war so necessary to total victory. We are Americans. We want to do our duty where we can serve best. We make these statements, not because we fear evacuation, but because we believe, to the bottom of our hears, that the best interests of the United States, our nation, are to be served by being permitted to stay, work, fight, and die for our country if necessary here where we belong.\"",
