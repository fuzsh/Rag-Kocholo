        "text": "Back to index of \"this and that in my life\" pages by Donald Sauter.\n\nConversations with me, No. 59b\n\nEmail highlights, from about September 2006\n\nDedicated to the proposition that every thought that's ever been thunk may be of use or interest to someone . . .\n\nTHEE: Tell me, as an astronomy chap, any comments on Pluto's sorry fate? ME: I think we should leave it as the 11th planet (base 8). ME: Thanks for the recent cd mailings. DDVI had at least three moments of true genius: Ring Worm, Good Ole Country Music, and Blue Jay Way. Not counting Maria Galvany, of course. Joanne O'Connell on Arthur Godfrey was superb. She's nowhere in my record collection, though. Joel Whitburn has California Sun by the Rivieras released on Feb 1 1964, making the claim they were kept from No. 1 by the Beatles quite plausible. They got to No. 5 anyhow. I don't recall any song called California Sun. This was your second dip into the Mark Hamill Muppet Show for me. I had you on the lookout for it for something like 8 years for Scooter's transcendent \"Six-string Orchestra\" song. Couldn't find that thumbing through my bound notes to the DChron series. Get me the original computer files. That's no longer a friendly request. I chose \"A Piece of Pie\" for my first Damon Runyon Theater listen since it was one of my favorites. I smiled or laughed throughout the whole thing. And that's in spite of them stonewalling the funniest line. In the rundown of rules of the eating contest between Hilda Slocum and Joe Duffle: \"The decision is to be strictly on the amount of food consumed, and the judges are to take account of anything left on the plates after a course, but not of loose chewings on bosom or vest up to an ounce.\" It's funnier in the context of the whole list of rules. I was surprised to find a passage that definitely had its origins in O. Henry - coincidentally, the story I recorded for last year's holiday season, Two Thanksgiving Day Gentlemen. \"Then Nicely- Nicely gives the first cheer in person, but the effort overtaxes his strength, and he falls off the chair in a faint just as Joel Duffle collapses under the table, and the doctors at the Clinic Hospital are greatly baffled to receive, from the same address at the same time, one patient who is suffering from undernourishment, and another patient who is unconscious from overeating.\" There are 7 stories in the radio series which I've never read. I had recently read a review of Mojo's \"The Beatles - 10 years that shook the world\" in the latest Beatlfan (you gave me). I picked up a copy at Spence's auction on Friday. In what I've read so far, there's some good, new information. It starts off with a picture of Raymond Jones. I didn't pick up the copy of Bill Adler's \"Love Letters To The Mets\" (1965). I see what you mean when you say he was a trendy sorta guy. I went to the Renaissance Festival on Sunday. Had a great time. This year marks their 30th anniversary (or 30th production?) I'm pretty sure I hit their 2nd or 3rd one, in 1978, in Columbia. For some reason, I can't put my finger on my hanging folder of Renaissance Festival programs. I do know I lost one somewhere along the way, which bugs me. ME: o runyon Had to mention a funny discovery in the first episode of the Damon Runyon Theater I chose to listen to from the complete run that Hself sent me. It was \"A Piece Of Pie\", which I remember as one of his funniest stories. There was this passage: \"Then Nicely-Nicely gives the first cheer in person, but the effort overtaxes his strength, and he falls off the chair in a faint just as Joel Duffle collapses under the table, and the doctors at the Clinic Hospital are greatly baffled to receive, from the same address at the same time, one patient who is suffering from undernourishment, and another patient who is unconscious from overeating.\" That scene surely had it's origin in O. Henry's \"Two Thanksgiving Day Gentlemen\", the story I recorded for last year's holiday season. I went to the Maryland Renaissance Festival on Sunday with Mizan. Highlights were too numerous to list, but Dame Mizan said for her it was being knighted by the King. Her good deed was \"helping a kid to learn multiplication.\" >It has a built in tapeplayer and CD player, but won't record. Shucks. ME: Thanks a lot for the clips. I've been to the Arbutus record show at least 3 or 4 times. One visit in particular had a big impact on my life. I bought 2 operas, The Magic Flute (Mozart) and Cavalleria Rusticana (Mascagni), simply because I wanted to hear the original versions of some pieces of music that had been arranged for guitar. Both operas totally knocked me out, and that in spite of them being different styles of music, from different countries and different centuries. And that was the start of my opera kick. I agree that Posamentier meant the hundreds place, but keep in mind the difference between slips and being wrong about something. His brain might have been on the next paragraph when he typed that. Or maybe somebody else goofed it up for him. I could write a two-volume set by now called \"This Is What I Wrote... This Is What They Printed!\" If you do write him about it, see if he can figure out the date of the 4th Sunday in June, 2006. [On an invitation, my sister had provided a date that didn't match the day of the event.] What he meant when he said \"many\" two-digit numbers obey that trick for multiplying by 11 was, it always works whenever the two digits add up to a single digit number. If the two digits add up to something in the \"teens\" (all the numbers from 10-19) then you have to add the 1 into the hundreds place. I wish him the best of luck with his \"wow\" approach to math. To be honest, though, he and I are at opposite ends of the spectrum. What I try to get across is the amazing power you have in math with just a few simple, basic concepts. For instance, I try to break down the distinction between addition and subtraction in a student's head. Subtraction is nothing new. When you see 11-7, you'd better not be counting back from 11, you'd better be hearing yourself saying, 7 plus what gets me up to 11? Same thing with multiplication and division. When J~~ was telling about his students who get stuck on 56 divided by 8, I didn't manage to get in, when I do division with kids, I don't even give them the problem. I just say, \"56. *You* give *me* the problem, and answer.\" What else can it be? A firm grip on addition, multiplication and algebra would put somebody up in the 98th percentile of math skills. And algebra is nothing more than \"whatever you do to one side of the equation, you do to the other side\", or, what I call, WYDTOSOTEYDTTOS (wydtos, for short). I bought a book so I can help kids with SAT prep. I was amazed to find there is not a single thing in the math part of the SAT that I didn't learn by 7th grade. I have a student now that is having trouble passing the math part of the PRAXIS exam to become a teacher. Again, there is not one single thing in the math part of PRAXIS I didn't learn by 7th grade. In fact, I learned a lot in 7th grade, such as factoring polynomials, which does not appear on the SAT or PRAXIS. The writer's \"trick\" of seeing if a number is a multiple of 3 by recognizing the sum of the digits is a multiple of 3 is so useful in simplifying expressions that I hardly think of it as a trick. I think I learned that in 3rd grade. But putting things in perspective, obviously people can live full, happy, productive lives with little or no math skills. It's not like, just because everything is either words or numbers, they have equal importance. But I claim that math skills open up good career opportunities fantastically out of line with their importance in everyday life. Here's how I try to \"elicit\" Posementier's \"wow\" reaction. I tell my students, I have a niece who studied math, became an accountant, and will be a millionaire before you can blink an eye. THEE: Re: pardon my french >Also good news today, the coordinator of the adult literacycenter finally got me a number for a young man I was hoping to have a chance to help. He's been described as a \"real trip\". The director says he's excited about getting another tutor. What's got me charged up is, its eems there's a good likelihood of a job for him at a restaurant in his area if we can get him comfortable reading the menu. Good deal. He'll have a definite goal to achieve. Keep me posted on his progress. For Tuesday, my Reading II students have a little writing assignment. They're to think about all the times they read during the day--not just sitting down to read a magazine, newspaper, or book (cuz they don't do a lot of that unfortunately) but all the times they find themselves reading ANYTHING. I didn't provide hints, but they all drive to school, for instance, and most of them spend time on the Internet. Then they're to talk about how their lives would be different if they couldn't read at all or if they maybe read first or second grade level. >After despairing forever about finding a good phonograph turntable, I finally got just the thing from Amazon. I'm a kid with a new toy, going through my record collection and turning all my records into cds in the process. Actually, my tests show that mp3 and wav sound identical to me, so I'm going with mp3, and that lets me put about 16 or 18 albums on one cd. I've discovered the benefits of doing this go beyond simpleminded compactness. I figure about 8 decades should do it. Hey, that would be marvelous. I don't have all that many records anymore because I haven't had a working turntable in years and finally ditched a lot of the records. But we do have a fair number that I couldn't part with. I found a turntable a while back, which I mainly wanted to play 78s. Unfortunately, it has no output connections and can't be connected to a computer. It has a built in tapeplayer and CD player, but won't record. Shucks. >And today I received from my friend Hself a cd that has 24 hours worth of the Damon Runyon Theater radio program (1949) on it. Time's a problem, nec pas? 24 hours on one CD. That's amazing. Damon Runyon Theater should be fun! And that's n'est-ce pas? Speaking of languages, I sent D~~ the German dog song yesterday. Made her day. Made mine, too, since she was able to explain all those contractions that made no sense to me although I could make out many of the full words. I still haven't asked her if real Germans would write those contractions or if it's more just a matter of the way they would say them. Btw, all our Internet classes have more female than male students. Most are 19 to 20-year-olds. THEE: Kumon and alternatives Donald, I read your web site and your conflict with Kumon headquarters and found it to be very enlightening. It's sad that they couldn't appreciate your suggestions to improve their curriculum. My kids have been attending Kumon since June and so far its been beneficial simply because they had not mastered their math facts. Kumon was a ready-made external way to get them to learn it. For now we are benefiting from it and it's better than nothing. In College Station, Tex, Kumon and Sylvan are the only alternatives for supplementing and enriching my children's education. My children are 9 and 11 and I want to help them to appreciate Math and develop a thorough understanding of it. My son recently started getting frustrated when facing harder worksheets which prompted me to search for ways to help him so he doesn't develop an anxiety with it. Would you mind sharing your opinion on what resources/facilities you do recommend? Any online alternatives that do a better job than Kumon or Sylvan? Recommended workbooks? Do you think finding a private tutor with a committment to the child's development a better way to go? I haven't explored this option as I suspect it will be more expensive than Kumon and Sylvan. ME: You ask a very good, and very difficult, question. One would think by now that some very good math minds have gotten together and put together the near-perfect curriculum leading any student from the very beginning all the way through math. How hard could that be? If the developers don't get it right on the first shot, they observe where the students have trouble, and modify those sections until students can get through them easily. Perhaps such programs are out there, but wading through the choices is simply overwhelming. Just type \"math worksheets\" into google to see what I mean. One thing I've looked into and like are the Math League contests. The Math League runs annual contests for the different grades. Then they publish the contests in books which can be purchased from their site. (Just search on \"math league\".) Don't let the word \"contest\" confuse matters. The material is basic and worthwhile, not what I call mathematical gymnastics (until you get to the high school contests, which I don't like.) The books give complete solutions to all the problems. The problems mostly all involve words. In general, they look and feel nothing like Kumon. Although the contests for each grade level are a little more difficult than the ones for the previous grade, they were not designed as a self-contained, self study program,of course. But the contests give an excellent idea of what a solid student at each grade level should be able to handle easily. So you might try one book of contests for 4th through 6th grade for a start. If you do, let me suggest a Kumon-like approach. Don't worry so much about time, but remove the solution and answer pages so your children are forced to come to you to see how they scored. See if they can fix their mistakes on their own, and when that fails, let them look at the solutions. Hope this helps a little. If *you* ever stumble on the perfect math program, let me know, ok? THEE: There's a photo of Raymond Jones!? THEE: The Renaissance Festival sounds like fun. We have one about an hour from here in Muskogee . . . at the castle. I've never been. It started after our kids were pretty well grown, and they never had much interest. Norman, where OU is located, also has one. The kids went, but I never got there either. The son of a friend of mine used to go in his kilt and with his bagpipes. Bet he was the only black piper around. THEE: Subject: Disqualified . . . or Giggles OK, I belatedly have gotten through about half of your latest CD. And, I'll have you know, I've never peeked at the wrapper because I follow instructions. I remember Tubby the Tuba oh so well and enjoyed all the Golden Slumbers variations. Somehow that laugh-track sounded vaguely familiar. You had to be there. Gosh, I see that the Saturday night feature [at the Buster Keaton festival] is Keaton's College. I could make the drive Thursday after work and be there for the beginning of the festival . . . but I don't relish driving those remote roads alone on Friday and Saturday night. Those critters on the road can be pretty dangerous. No kidding. A couple of years after I left Pittsburg State University, a former colleague, who was head of composition there, hit a horse on the road about 2:00 in the morning when returning from a conference. He died instantly. My guess is that the horse died pretty quickly, too. ME: I'm taking it easy tonight while we get dumped on by Ernesto. I got some disappointing news yesterday. It happens that the man I was hoping to help learn to read the menu so he could get a better job at the restaurant quit his current job there. He thought his boss was being unreasonable about not letting him take time off for a couple of things which, according to the coordinator at the literacy center hardly justified missing work for. So I won't pursue working with V~~, which I viewed as kind of a short term side project. I put up the web page about Caesar Rodney's ride. I had second thoughts about doing it because there's really very little of me in it, and I feel like that's the purpose of a personal web site. But I figured what the heck, a few people might find it vaguely fun and interesting. The story was not on the web until now, and I do have other pages that involve wholesale copying (the way to do history!) Feel free to put it on the deep back burner. http://www.geocities.com/donaldsauter/rodney.htm [now http://www.donaldsauter.com/caesar-rodney.htm ] A singer invited me to her web site. It's kind of funny. I thought you might get more out of it with your high speed connection. She wrote: >You have such an impressive selection of classical music, I thought you might like to check out my website for a bit of *comic relief*. > http://www.orrielsmith.com >Cluckingly yours, >Orriel I said there were too many Renaissance Festival highlights to mention, but this was probably my favorite. Mizan and I had seen tons of amazing magic and sword swallowing and feats of derring- do. When we came to a stage with a group of madrigal singers I thought I would have to use a little coaxing to stop for a few songs. But Mizan herself said, \"Let's go in.\" Fine with me! Now madrigal singers don't draw the same crowds as the crazy guys, so there were *lots* of free spots on the benches. And it's sort of like church, where nobody wants to sit way up front. But Mizan walked right down to the front and plunked herself down a little left of center. Well, a foot and a half from the stage was a little close for me, so I took the second row, center. The singers were in the middle of a song, and it was obvious they got a kick out of a little kid making herself right at home like that. I know it had to make their day, with Mizan swaying and clapping along to all their songs. They ended up by getting some kids and grown-up kids (e.g. me) from the audience for their last piece. We kept circling around and through an arch made by two of the singers, and whoever was the last to pass through got caught, and his head \"chopped off\" (imaginarily). That's how Mizan got her head chopped off. And then they gave her a Renaissance Reveler's cassette, figuring, I guess, that nobody buys cassettes anymore. (I've already turned it into a cd.) And I had a pen in my pocket so I suggested that Mizan get a few autographs on the cassette card. Of course, they were quite delighted by that, too. Anyhow, the point is, I know how much musicians like to feel they were appreciated, and I'm sure Mizan made their day. Along those same, lines, we stopped by a guitar/fiddle duo playing Irish music, and Mizan tried some Irish jigging, at least it looked quite authentic to me. The musicians got a kick out of that. And at another consort we stopped to hear, the harper invited Mizan to have a few zings on his instrument. >Somehow that laugh-track on your cd post card [an audience watching a Buster Keaton film] sounded vaguely familiar. You had to be there. Not to laugh along with it. Something infectious about laughs. My guitar friend got a copy of the cd post card. She said she tried to imagine the scenes causing the laughter. You told me once. Something to do with scooting around in the water, or popping up out of it. Just learned a little more about geography out your way by looking up Iola on my road atlas. The Kansas page conveniently lets the part of Okla. with Tulsa survive. By the way, what do you all call yourselves, \"Centrallers\"? \"Middlers\"? \"Tweeners\"? >Remember my John H. Curran E-Mail? What a wacky wife! What crazy connections you turn up! I'll try to keep my eye out for Patience Worth books at the auction. The local freebie paper printed a letter of mine this week. It's one of my usual fly-off-the-handle rants about schools - don't ask me what gets into me. I know there's a missing transition between the 1st and 2nd sentence in paragraph 2, but I gave up and figured the reader could wrestle with it if he wanted. >By the way, that letter to Kennedy reminded me of something one of my students wrote. Picking up on your comment about being a slow reader but missing your point (\"If there were a contest to see who reads a story the fastest, I'd lose by a country mile - but so what? It takes me longer, but I cover more territory.\"), one of my students once wrote that she identified with you because she's a slow reader, too. Now you go back and give that kid an A+ for his perception. (I'm throwing in the towel on multi-genderism; it's back to \"the pronoun that feels best to the writer\" for me.) Funny to see myself quoted. It started sounding familiar about 2/3 of the way through. Of course, it still applies to everything I read, but what jumped to mind when you wrote that was a funny article I had just read in Mark Twain's Library of Humor. It was called \"John Phoenix Renders The Editor Of The San Diego Herald An Account Of His Stewardship\" by George H. Derby (a.k.a. John Phoenix). I laughed my head off, not even having any idea of the background for what was going on. For example, \"...and I now close the series with an entirely literary number, in which I have carefully abstained from the mention of Baldo and Wigler--I mean Wagler and Bildo; no, never mind--as Toodles says, I haven't mentioned *any of 'em*...\" So I went to the web - and the background to this article is *hilarious* - not to mention, I learned amazing things like southern California trying to form its own state with the Sandwich Islands, etc. (Waldo and Bigler were candidates for Cal. governor.) In a nutshell, the article describes the return of the regular editor of the San Diego Herald, Judge Ames, after trusting the editorship for a few weeks to John Phoenix in his absence. And Phoenix completely flipflopped the political stance of the paper! In this final editorial he describes the \"interview between the editor and Phoenix\" - a hilarious brawl, actually. Phoenix apparently had quite a knack for words; he could listen to a sermon and later quote it word for word. Don't view these as reading assignments, but here are the links to this good stuff: Whoops. It looks like Twain's Library of Humor isn't on the web. I thought it was. Kind of kicks the stuffins out of picking through this chapter of San Diego history: http://www.sandiegohistory.org/books/smythe/2-13.htm If you do, search on the word \"combat\". THEE: RE: request to copy william p. frank chapter The Del American Bicent Commission became the Delaware Heritage Commission and yes we do hold the copyright. I think it would be fine to create the information for the web. ME: Here's how my web page on Caesar Rodney/Katharine Pyle/William Franks turned out. I think a few people might find it interesting, and the Katharine Pyle version was nowhere on the web. Thanks again for your help. THEE: I just received the music three minutes ago. I opened the package and I saw that wonderfull music by Carulli inside! I am so happy now!!! I will be keeping informed about ths project. This is a wonderful material and you have been so kind! I saw some corrections you suggest in scores, one more valuable point!. Muchas gracias! Thank you, Grazie mille!! THEE: I have a copy of the grimm's fairy tales that matches the description exactly of the one you have. do you know anything of its worth? Do you know the publish date? Can you send me all the info you have on it? ME: I really don't know any more about it than what I wrote in the web page. I hate when books (or records) don't show years! I guess the thing to do is keep a running search for it on ebay. THEE: >>Somehow that laugh-track sounded vaguely familiar. You had to be there. >Something to do with scooting around in the water, or popping up out of it. Yeah, they man and woman were on a boat. Everything was going wrong and it was flooding. I don't recall if they were having trouble getting a romance started or if there had been a fight between them, but this sort of started everything on the right path in a very crazy way. >Just learned a little more about geography out your way by looking up Iola on my road atlas. The Kansas page conveniently lets the part of Okla. with Tulsa survive. If you want my two cents, go for it. By the way, what do you all call yourselves, \"Centrallers\"? \"Middlers\"? \"Tweeners\"? The way I look at it, I've always been a Midwesterner, but that's debatable. Some people lump Oklahoma with Texas and Texas with the Southwest. Personally, I think \"Tweeners\" is better because Oklahoma doesn't have the Mexican heritage of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. I guess we're one of a kind--just Okies. >The local freebie paper printed a letter of mine this week.It's one of my usual fly-off-the-handle rants about schools - don't ask me what gets into me. So you're a published author yet again. Always fun. Must be in the genes to voice those opinions. >Whoops. It looks like Twain's Library of Humor isn't on the web. I thought it was. Kind of kicks the stuffins out of picking through this chapter of San Diego history: > http://www.sandiegohistory.org/books/smythe/2-13.htm >If you do, search on the word \"combat\". Wow! That's what history oughta be! Terrific find! THEE: We'll say a prayer as we head back into New York for our trip home for those who sadly lost their lives five- years-ago during the attacks on the World Trade Center; the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. (we change planes there) as well as those who perished on the three aircraft involved. If only we had all the money wasted in Iraq--billions per month--to make our borders safer, our ports safer and lives better for our American poor, elderly, infirm or ailing. Perhaps a nice increase in the minimum wage for so many hard-working folks who can barely make ends meet? Our hearts go out to these Americans. Would also be ecstatic to see some of those billions go to free pet neutering and no-kill shelters. And, finally, speaking of animals, big prayers for the family of Steve Irwin, the Crocodile Hunter and Aussie T.V. personality/performer who was killed yesterday by a Sting Ray while diving. At least he was doing what he loved--adventure with creatures. ME: Thanks again for your help with the liability insurance. Your agent didn't return my call, but at the same time I had luck with a State Farm agent here in Dover. It was about the same price as yours. I eventually got quotes from two other agents - one for $650 and one for $800. Whether those were based on a misunderstanding of what I plan to do, or were simply attempts to rob me, I don't know. THEE: Subject: Are you the guy? Don, Did you used to work for the Southwestern Company for a man named Jim Calder? If so, how can I get in touch with you? ME: Hi Jerry, Nope, not me. Good luck! Donald THEE: Subject: Vote for Oklahoma Quarter Design Interested in shaping numismatic history? If the link doesn't hold up after all the forwarding, you know how to get to it. Frankly, I think some of the designs are hideous. >The oil and natural gas industry has a unique opportunity to be recognized nationwide for all it has given to the State of Oklahoma. Gov. Henry is asking the public to vote on the design of the Oklahoma state quarter, and the industry is featured in a few of the design options. >Below is a link to a Web site, where you can vote every 24 hours for your favorite designs. You can vote for multiple designs. >http://www.gov.ok.gov/coin2.php ME: Thanks, I'm still chuckling!

I'm gritting mine until then . . . and taking Wednesday and Thursday off. A colleague will fill in for me because I'm not a believer in canceling class although I'm sure my students wouldn't mind. THEE: Subject: elvis record I enjoyed your instructions on fixing a record skip. I have a first Elvis recording of That's All Right worth $1000 and it skips right at the end. Under magnification, it looks like a deep gouge rather than a scratch (maybe a little bigger than a pin head. How can this be fixed? . . would a little epoxy filler work or something?..Are there expertas who repair these rare records? ME: Did you give my method a try? Based on your description, it sounds like it might work. I've also wondered about filling in gouged vinyl and reforming the grooves over a small section, but have never heard of it being done. Would you be happy to own the rare record, but capture once and for all a good digital recording of it? How I handle a skip in the middle of recording a record to cd is lift the needle back to before the skip and then apply very light *sideways* pressure to the tone arm in the opposite direction of the skip to get the needle to follow the groove. I use a toothpick. It doesn't matter how many times you fail at this, as soon as you get through the skip point one time successfully, let the record play out. Then it's a simple job (believe me) with even free sound editing software (such as WavePad) to cut out all the extraneous material and get a seamless recording. Then you could put your record in a nice display case and play the cd for everyone. ME: Hi Matt, Here's a voice from out of the past. Any chance you still have the cd of guitar duets I recorded with former buddy R~~. It was a set of arrangements of \"Scraps from the Opera\" by 19th C. black American guitarist Justin Holland. They came out dreadful sounding. Unfortunately, though, it was my only copy. I know how unlikely this would be for the average person, but I'm guessing you're much more organized. I'd be glad to reimburse you for your trouble and mailing costs. Thanks for your help. THEE: Re: guitar duo cd I think you have the wrong Matt W~~ here. I'm the sort of person who might have an album of guitar duets of yours -- I've got a Borbetomagus album or two around -- but I don't think we've ever met personally. (If we have please forgive me for forgetting!) Are you by any chance looking for the Matt W~~ who's a double bassist in Seattle? I know him slightly, I might be able to help dig up his contact information. Or, if there's some connection through Greg P~~ in Pittsburgh (and Delaware), I can certainly help get in touch with him. I guess I should be a little clearer about who I am, to help you figure out if it's me you're thinking of -- I lived in Pittsburgh for a long time and played with the Pittsburgh free music folks, Greg P~~ and Mike J~~. Hope you can find your CD! best, Matt ME: Whoops, sorry bother you! Thanks for taking it in good humor - in this busy day and age when even a little thing like a wrong number is supposed to send us into a rage. Could have sworn I got your email address off of a page that had discussion of events at American University, which is where another Matt W~~ teaches, or taught, recording technology. The web's so big, I guess, that there's a page that brings together *any* two (3, 4, 5 . . .) unrelated entities! Guess I'll send a note to American U.

While installation of state of the art sound barriers may be prohibitively costly, we hope that there may be more or less inexpensive measures that reduce the noise. Your engineers would know best, but these are some thoughts that occur to me: If and when the toll plaza rumble strips need replacing, replace them with strips that actually \"rumble\", rather than produce the piercing \"buzz\" we hear constantly. Perhaps some sort of inexpensive fencing in the vicinity of the rumble strips would take the edge off of the buzz. If and when Rt. 1 needs resurfacing in this area, perhaps a much quieter blacktop, rather than screaming concrete, could be used. In lieu of installing noise barriers, perhaps a taller and longer fence separating our neighborhood from the highway would reduce traffic noise. As it is, the tops of tractor trailers are visible over the top of the fence, so the noise they produce has a straight-line shot at us. Again, we all know this is not a high-priority, life-and-death traffic matter, but perhaps something can be done very inexpensively, or at no additional expense in the natural course of highway maintenance, that would make life much more pleasant for the 150 households in this neighborhood and the apartments just beyond. Thank you very much for your consideration. ME: Here's a small tip for the two batches of opera records I got from you. It doesn't come close to making up what they're worth, but I hope it makes all your effort putting up the auctionS and packing and sending the records off a little more worthwhile.

THEE: Subject: Karl Katz You may have found an answer to your query about the contents of the two volumes of Kinder- und Hausmdrchen (Children' and Household Tales) by the Brothers Grimm. But if not, here is a helpful link. I, too, am searching for the origins of this story, with no luck (Karl Katz). Thanks for your insights. http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm.html#chronology THEE: Subject: FW: Karl Katz Hello again- It occurred to me, looking at the site below that Karl Katz could have been published in the Deutsche Sagen (a collection totaling 585 German legends). This came to me after looking at another website which is a reading list/course outline from professor Paul Kent Oakley(Rutgers University), posted in 1996. The notation of the discussion of \"Karl Katz\" states that it is from Germany, written in 1818. The second volume of Deutsche Sagen was published in 1818. So, perhaps this is the answer to the mystery. If not, it's close! ME: Thanks for your thoughts on the Karl Katz mystery. My best guess, which seems impossibly far-fetched, is that in the evolution of the 7 editions of Kinder- und Hausma\"rchen from 86 to 200 stories some were simply dropped along the way, and of the people who have compared the different editions and actually noticed this, no one thought it was a big enough deal to tell anybody else. Very strange, for the \"most influential book ever created in the German language.\" I *think* your theory about Karl Katz appearing in the Deutsche Sagen can be shot down. Project Gutenberg has the Deutche Sagen online, and there's no Karl Katz (or Peter Kraus) in the index. I also see some discussion in German which pulls in a \"Peter Klaus\", as opposed to Kraus, but from what I can gather, no one in the discussion has authoritative answers.

A few minutes later, as the oral surgeon inserted the IV needle in the back of my hand and announced he was about to start the Valium-family anesthetic, he added, \"In 10 seconds, you'll have a smile on your face.\" I started counting to myself: One-one thousand, two-one thousand . . . ten-one thousand.\" Nothing! I kept counting. I recall reaching \"twelve-one thousand.\" The next I remember, the nurse was walking me to a wheelchair and wheeling me to a different room. I may have dozed off briefly sitting there. The oral surgeon walked in saying that the tooth came out in two pieces, and that was a piece of cake. He was going to the lobby to get C~~. They showed C~~ a door from the recovery room to a back parking lot, and told him to pull the car around there. They walked me to the car. I looked at the clock. About 40 minutes had passed since I walked first sat down in the dental chair. A half hour later, the Broken Arrow Brit periodonist was working on me. Within another half hour, I had a cadaverous bone implant and a neat row of sutures, and was headed out his door. That cadaverous bit bothers me a little, but I'm assured its perfectly safe. A colleague has been walking around with an armful of cadaverous bone for five years after a car accident that smashed her arm shortly after she was hired to teach English at my campus. She has full use of her arm and no more than scar to clue anyone in to the past mishap. The Oral surgeon prescribed the second highest possible dose of Percoset for the pain and Amoxicillin. The periodonist looked at the presecriptions, and said, \"Fill the antibiotic, and forget the Percoset.\" He gave me 6 days worth of steroids instead, explaining that the pain comes mainly from the swelling and that he could avoid that. \"Take Advil or Aleve\" was his advice. \"Enjoy your five-day weekend without being knocked out!\" He wrote down his home phone number and cell number and told me not to hesitate to call--day or night--if anything seemed \"untoward.\" When did you last run into a member of the medical profession like that? Mom is coming over tomorrow--not because I need the help, but because she needs to see for herself that I'm doing fine. ME: Glad things went well! Your story reminds me of my visit to the surgery center earlier this year for a standard 50-year-old-geezer sort of procedure. (Never mind I procrastinated for a few years.) When I woke up I was *mad*! \"What are all these people standing around talking so *loud* for?\" I thought. \"Don't they know they're trying to put me out so the doctor can get to work???\" That thing about hustling you out the back door sounds familiar, too. Can't be a coincidence; must be a reason for it. THEE: >Glad things went well! Your story reminds me of my visit to the surgery center earlier this year for a standard 50-year-old- geezer sort of procedure. Sounds like the same one I've procrastinated on. They get me for that in a few months. THEE: RE: Karl Katz Hi Donald - After sending the last email, I found the Project Gutenberg link and as you observed Karl Katz isn't listed there. If an answer to the mystery should ever present itself (clearly), I'll pass it along for you to look at as well. Thanks for your thoughts! ME: Forgot to mention I got a big kick out of the Hokey Pokey Shakespeare. I'm usually pretty leery of those sorts of things, don't know why, but that was funny. >The way I look at it, I've always been a Midwesterner, but that's debatable. It's always seemed to me that once our country reached its manifest destiny we should have gone back and renamed the various sections. (I suppose we can do this at the same time we finally decide to come up with a name for our country.) You're actually much closer to the Atlantic than the Pacific, so you're not even west, much less in the middle of the west. I always thought the \"Midwest\" was the Indiana/Ohio region. Somehow, they don't seem to like my proposal of renaming it the Middle East. I learned some geography last night that surprised the heck out of me. I read a \"trivia\" question that asked, \"Is any part of the United States (other than Alaska) north of the 49th parallel?\" *Whenever* I see a map of our united states, my brain always extrapolates that upper line of the western half of the country to slice through Maine somewhere, making Maine the northernmost connected state. It also just *looks* like it juts way up there into Canada. Well, I guess I was the last person, or maybe only ever person, alive to think that. I had to go to my atlas, and, sure enough, Maine doesn't get anywheres near 49 deg. north latitude. Looks like about 47.5. What you don't learn everyday... By the way, the point of the trivia question was that little wart on the top of Minnesota. I transferred one of my favorite records to cd the other day. It's \"Songs of the Elfin Pedlar\", music by Charles Stanford, sung by James Griffett. It's all English - it *drips* Englishness - but that doesn't mean one can make it all out, of course. The texts are all old, so I figured it would be easy to get them all off the web. No such luck. I only got 3 out of 25. Twelve of the songs come from the book \"The Elfin Pedlar\" by Helen Douglas Adam. In my failed attempt to find the text, I found something about the writer. (I wouldn't be surprised if you know her; maybe kinda surprised if you don't.) I'm familiar with musical child prodigies, but I'm not sure I've heard of literary child prodigies (sorry Daisy! [Ashford]) so this amazed me. By the time that she was 20, Helen had published three books of poetry with a major English press, Hodder and Stoughton: The Elfin Pedlar and Tales Told by Pixie Pool (1923), Charms and Dreams from the Elfin Pedlar's Pack (1924), and Shadow of the Moon (1929). Her first book, The Elfin Pedlar, was published when she was 14 years old, and includes 120 ballads composed from the time that she was two, at which time, according to the book's forward, the child \"talked to her dolls in rhyme. She would tell them stories of fairies and flowers all clothed in beautiful language and in faultless rhythm.\"3 The 35 odd columns from different newspapers throughout Scotland and England that reviewed the book loved recounting certain anecdotes about the child's precocious mannerisms: \"Sometimes, her mother, overhearing this casual flow of dainty rhymes would say 'Helen, can you repeat that? To which the child would answer, Oh No Mummy; but I shall say some more.\"4 The book was met with enthusiasm, and Helen was hailed as having \"an extraordinary sense and handling of rhythm and rhyme.\"5 with a \"perfect ear and a delicate imagination\"6 and \"a mind elect\"7 which was \"entirely free from self-consciousness or any thought of posing.\"8 Indeed, for whatever reasons that a country needs its prodigies, whether for the pride of Nationalism or for the moral support that comes from a strong youthful spirit that re-embodies the rhythms of its history, Helen Adam became the pride of Scotland. The Elfin Pedlar was graced even by a note of praise from the Queen of Scotland herself. That's from this page: http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/prevallet/adam.html Another really nice record in my collection I transferred to cd lately was Beethoven's setting of Scottish and Irish folksongs. Actually, the last one was English - \"The Miller of Dee\". What's funny is that now I recognize the text as a Mother Goose rhyme. It's in a few of my collections, such as the 1895 British one. There was a jolly miller Lived on the river Dee: He worked and sang from morn to night, No lark so blythe as he. And this the burden of his song For ever used to be-- I care for nobody--no! not I, Since nobody cares for me. Beethoven and Mother Goose - who'da thunk? There was another big batch of books at the auction on Friday. I sifted through about 9 boxes and found The Green Fairy Book by Andrew Lang, in an \"unaltered republication\" (the book). That's one that I've been on the lookout for. So then I had to scrounge around for enough other books of borderline interest to put a box together. In this case that was mostly a few books of math puzzles and a batch of classic fiction for giveaways (Charlotte's Web, Little Women, for example.) All in all, well worth $2, even though I'm not thrilled to bring another box of books into the house. When I took a closer look, though, I was pleased with the haul. The 49th parallel question, for example, came from one of the math puzzle books. There's a paperback of Mark Twain's \"best\" short stories, mostly unknown to me, and now I know from his \"Library of Humor\" that I've got to catch up on the guy. He's a whole lot more than just Huck and Tom. There's a book with 24 Arabian Night stories - another thing I need to catch up on. I've passed up the huge, complete Arabian Nights Entertainments on several occasions, because I know I would never tackle that. Here's one of my favorites from The Arrow Book of Funny Poems. On John Bun Here lies John Bun; He was killed by a gun. His name was not Bun, but Wood; But Wood would not rhyme with gun, and Bun would. Now what sort of crazy brain would think that up? There was also a borderline horror poem by Walter de la Mare. One of the math books, \"Fantasia Mathematica\", turned out to be neat surprise - an anthology of fiction with mathematical themes. The backlog grows and grows. Again, I had planned to do a little more catching up, but enough's enough. One thing that I'm finally remembering is, thanks for the Baltimore Electric Blue Print Co. souvenir ruler. It's been sitting on my table here forever as a reminder, but I guess it made itself so at home that I stopped noticing whenever I was plugging away at email. ME: what got into me I bought a big batch of beat up, old 45s at Friday's auction. Looks like just about 200 of them. Don't know why. Must have been \"Rockin' Crickets\" by the Rockin' Rebels on Swan. ME: almost rich and famous Had to mention that a copy of the trio cd that I put together found its way to one of the \"who-dunits\" here in Dover. Joe was really impressed, and lent it to the music director at his church. Next thing I hear is Joe asking what we charge to put on a performance. I told Joe that, sorry, but all things considered, it really wasn't feasible. [Would take aliens with suitcases of gold.] THEE: I found your letter on the Kumon learning center very informative and helpful, thank you. Its hard dealing with corporate environments when you have two separate goals, Theirs is money, and your was sincerely trying to help your students, regardless of the time restraints. Its sad. I am a mother of a 4th grade child and 8th grade child. Both IEP. Both extremely bright. The 7th grade child was diagnosed with Written Expression Disorder,, he still spells phonetically and has a hard time with reading and spelling. The other child is behind almost two years in reading they say. I think the child is not a mature reader, but neither was I. She went through a very traumatic experience in 2nd grade and had a hard time learning, thoughts were consumed on other things, worrying, and a hard time relating to anything, especially because her traumatic experience stemmed from her 2nd grade class room. What do you recommend I do to give the children extra support needed, I thought about a center,after reading you're letter I 'm not to sure if that's the answer, what about a private tutor, and how do I make sure there being taught the skills needed to them to be successful. Not just a bunch of work sheets. Please advice what you thinks best. ME: I surely don't qualify as an expert in situations such as yours, so please view this as just a friend talking to you. As funny as it may sound, I think the Kumon reading program might be very beneficial for both children, especially if you accept the advice I gave parents in the web page and do all the assignments yourself. If you forget why I suggest that, take another look at my web page where it discusses the reading program. Good luck!

I was reading the info on your website and I have a question. My family (3 of us) have been playing Scrabble on the regular board that we lay on top of a lazy-susan. We would like to upgrade to the Scrabble Deluxe with the built-in turntable. So the question is... when I looked at the new ones on Amazon the reviews at the bottom of the page acted like this new version sucks. Many said that an old one purchased on eBaby would be a better idea (grid is deeper and doesn't look/seem as plastic/cheap). What is your opinion??? On eBay I see new ones, one from 1989 and many from between 1976- 1977... what is best??? Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. ME: I'm not familiar with the newer, \"cheaper\" Deluxe scrabble board. I will say that I don't think the older ones were anything to write home about. The glare was horrible. And my turntable, at least, broke down, so to turn the board I had to lift, turn and set it back down. To be honest, I like the simple elegance of the folding cardboard board. We never have any trouble turning the board directly on the table top without tiles shifting. We don't even think about it. I'm wondering if that wouldn't work better for you than a lazy susan. By the way, try some of the ideas in my page, like a mixed set of tiles, no-risk challenges, and three-letter minimum! Thanks!

THEE: Subject: Taranaki Climb I came across your page on the internet about Harry Vernon. I was one of the hikers that reported a man calling for help on Mt. Taranaki and later provided information to the search and rescue crews. I have been deeply affected by what happened that day. My condolences to everyone that knew him. ME: Thank you for the condolences. And thank you for your help on that day. You might gather from the web page that Harry was what you would call \"quite a character.\" He still pops to mind frequently - always will. Somehow, though, as shocked and saddened as I was by Harry's death, and as much as I'd rather he still be with us, it wasn't one of those unbearable, painful, grief situations for me. He was, after all, 80 years old, and went out doing one of the things he loved most, and in grand style. Maybe Ronnie (whom you saw in the web page) and I are even a little bit envious! And Harry didn't leave a wife and family behind. I can't speak for everyone, of course, but I'm guessing all of his family and friends would say more or less the same. Last Sunday I was playing Scrabble with my father, sister and brother-in-law and when it got to my last turn I dramatically read off the scores: 112 to 109 to 105 . . . to 51 - with me in last place. While everyone was chuckling, I emptied my rack for a 79-point play to leap into victory and end the game. Man, I wish Harry was around to tell that one to! Thanks for writing. It was nice to meet another hero of that day. THEE: I'll swap a copy of this for the full version of \"The Frog\" -- assuming that wasn't the full poem, that is.

Every time I look at what I wrote I change a little something here and there trying to get something that maybe sounds ok, or at least won't embarrass me too much. Fat chance. I got Krystal and Mizan out on Charlie's boat again this weekend. This time Charlie had a raft-like device for pulling somebody along behind the boat. It was quite a blast. 18 mph felt like 50. I wish you could see even a 30-second vid of Mizan on it. Unfortunately, Krystal didn't even have a camera, which was sort of my fault since I kept it a secret what was in store. ME: to owens corning I inquired at Lowe's in Dover about installing a new roof. I have a low-pitched roof, 3/12. I want maximum overlap of the shingles. I would like the shingles overlapped halfway (1.5 ft), as opposed to the modern way of one half tab (6 in.) Lowe's said they cannot do that. Their reason was, it would nullify the manufacturer's warranty. That sounds absurd to me. Did I get correct information? Thanks. THEE: Subject: shingles Thank you for contacting Owens Corning.

I assume you have received emails about these two subjects? ME: Surely there are many more negative comments then just the one you saw. Did you look over the closed-out guestbook as well as the still active one? I use \"active\" loosely; it is very infrequent that anyone submits something for my guestbook. If you want negative comments, look, for example, at the feedback to my football page. Also look at my pages on evolution and \"the human race is special\". There's hardly a word of agreement in there. I have gotten some emails regarding the Kumon page, but actually not much in the way of agreement or disagreement. It's been a long long time since anyone has commented on unarchy. In fact, the main discussion took place in a few fanzines before the web came along. I would love to see some discussion of unarchy. THEE: \"In December 1997, a study said that boys start out as girls, but nothing in the article supported the claim. It said that if a male embryo doesn't produce male hormones, \"the female body blueprint will prevail\". So??? The male embryo does produce male hormone - probably because it's male, I guess. Anyhow, this was good enough to get a few scientists a bit of much-needed attention.\" Just saw this and had to email you again, are you saying that this statement is false? ME: Giving it everything I've got, I can only see the claim, as stated, as totally ridiculous and absurd. If the girl-embryo- which-will-turn-into-a-boy produces hormones that the girl- embryo-that-really-is-a-girl does not, then they are not the same thing.

Here's a paragraph I wrote to my friend Hself: >Something that's had me going around kicking puppies and little old ladies the last few weeks is being done dirty by a newspaper, as usual. The Delaware State News asked if they could feature me in their \"Meet Your Neighbor\" feature. Not without some misgivings I went ahead with it. I had responded immediately to their set of questions and after giving it a little more thought submitted a far, far more fun, meaty and interesting batch of responses. I was in running communication with the writer, so had no reason to think the update had fallen throught the cracks, but it did. They printed the draft. Talk about the mama of all blown opportunities... I made a proposal that they give me another shot a year and a half or so down the line, presuming I would have anything interesting at that time. The newspaper's editor offered an upcoming slot, which I would not have proposed, or wanted. Readers would take a glance and either think, \"Him again???\", or \"Look, the newspaper made a mistake!\" But I wasn't going to squander the opportunity, and I made this submission as different as possible from the first one, which wasn't hard. Now it's just a matter of holding my breath to see what they're gonna do to this one... You wouldn't believe (but of course you would) what I just went through to get an ad set up right by the Delaware State News. My logo is pure text. What took a couple of days and lots of frazzled nerves would have taken 8 seconds if I could have stood over the graphics specialist shoulder and said, \"Put a space back in there.\" I don't think I mentioned Krystal's job taking care of an elderly couple, Becky and Joe, in particular, Becky. She had been doing this for months, and I would hear occasional anecdotes, but it wasn't until the first boat trip with Krystal and Mizan that I realized I knew Joe. I probably would never made the connection, except Mizan said, \"... and they have a dog that's taller than your car!\" And I went, \"Ka-boiiingg! - Irish Wolfhound!\" And it turned out that, yes, Joe, was definitely the nice guy with the Irish Wolfhound I met up on Dover's Green on St. Patrick's day earlier this year. Of course, the Irish Wolfhound world is a small world, and he knew my friend Karen, and I even knew most of the story behind his dog, Erin, a rescue from an animal horror house up in New York. Becky had been going downhill lately, and getting visits from Senator Biden, Gov. Minner, etc., etc. She was also just awarded Delaware's Democrat of the Year award. A week or so ago, Krystal called with a funny story. I had given her that guitar trio cd with the enjoyable program. She never played it, and one day it fell out of her phone book at Joe's house. Joe wanted to hear it and Krystal said sure. Well, Joe loved it. He gave it to the music director at his church who was also impressed. So Krystal called to say that Joe wanted to know if we would put on a concert for the church. Well, even the promise of a blank check for our fee wouldn't be enough to resuscitate the Patowmack Guitar Trio at this point (shades of Distant Signals). I mention all of this for no particular reason, except the fun of the coincidences, and that my emails serve as my diary. But it comes to mind because Krystal called on Wednesday to say Becky died that day, which made me sad even though I hadn't met her. They're hoping [perhaps mostly Krystal's enthusiastic imagination] that Jimmy Carter, whom Becky had worked for, can come to the funeral. Last week I got a very nice \"Just So Stories\" by Kipling at the auction. Most recent date in it is 1912, but I'm guessing it's a much more recent reprint. Have you read The Elephant's Child lately? Hilarious! My second favorite might be The Butterfly That Stamped. Earlier this week I got a 6-volume set called \"My Bookhouse\" (c. 1920, 1925). It's a really lovely set, never mind the wear and mold, which I cleaned up pretty well. The bid took me right up to my maximum. For a while I was thinking I should have let the lady have them; she looked so disappointed when she bowed out. She probably figured I was gonna go on forever. One more bid would have gotten them for her. But now I see how bad my library needed this set. I've indexed the contents, which you may glance over if you'd like. They even mixed a couple of little Shakepeare rhymes in with Mother Goose. I'll be going to the auction this afternoon - anything I can get ya? ME: parigi o cara Here's my part of No. 15 La Traviata. When I played back my first \"good\" take I was totally sick at how ragged my rhythm was in the melody part. The next half-decent take had some squonked notes, which you can hear. I blasted the next to last chord louder than I wanted. There's a delay on the last chord, which I forget if it was inspiration or I just lost my mind. You'll find a fermata somewhere. Actually, it was kind of fun to play along with - I've rarely enjoyed that. Even if you make something great out of it, we'll see if we can beat it live. It was also a good test for me in that now I think I've got a good level and mic placement. So thanks for making the suggestion. Just before sending this off, I realize that I recorded to both tracks instead of just one. Both tracks are identical, so just delete one, the left. You'll be left on all our recordings. THEE: Saw a terrific silent film this afternoon with Mabel Normand, William Randolph Hearst's mistress of something like thirty years. It was called Mickey. Another Internet coincidence because several years ago a man in California contacted me because an ancestor of his was a ragtime era lyricist (not composer, if I remember correctly). I recall that this ragtime era guy's biggest hit was \"Mickey,\" naturally the theme of the film score this afternoon. ME: I picked up 32 oil paintings at the auction today. No Rambrandts or Van Goghs, but I think the overall effect on a wall in my office will be striking. In fact, they'll be freebies for the kids, too. THEE: Next time you get to the LC, will you please copy a couple of orchestrations for which I have only the first violin part. These are nothing that particularly interests me, but I have another reason. The grandson of Charles Horwitz (of the team Horwitz & Bowers (Fred. V.)is seeking his grandfather's music, and I have a chance to help him. Here's what I'd like: Everyday is Sunshine When the Heart Beats True (Stern, 1903) M 1350.0 Where the Sunshine Turns the Oceans Blue to Gold, Intro. The Altar of Friendship. M1350.0, Box N At the moment, I'm hopelessly behind although I've worked all weekend. If I EVER say anything about changing textbooks again, please talk some sense into me. ME: Would any of these old emails help? (If not, the 0'Hare joke is good for another chuckle.) A google search on horwitz bowers mickey didn't put a handy page near the top linking the songwriters and the song. I bought 32 oil paintings at the auction today. A wall in my office is gwine to look *good*! Maybe a bit garish for some people's taste, nuts to 'em. ME: >Everyday is Sunshine When the Heart Beats True (Stern, 1903) M 1350.0 >Where the Sunshine Turns the Oceans Blue to Gold, Intro. The Altar of Friendship. M1350.0, Box N Shouldn't be any problem finding the Bowers. For \"Everyday... I'll try the box that would seem to cover \"E\". If I can't find it under 0'Hare, I'll try O'Hare. >If I EVER say anything about changing textbooks again, please talk some sense into me. Hey, if I had any say, we'd be using 100-year-old textbooks. Truth doesn't change *that* fast. Plus'd save a pocket of change. ME: I was wondering if the grandson of Charles Horwitz you've been helping is named John M~~~. John just contacted me for a Horwitz & Bowers piece in my collection, and I'd rather surprise him with it in the mail than go back and forth describing the piece and asking for his address, etc. Do you have John M~~~'s address - or was this just a little coincidence? After all, there's *lots* of composers named on my site. For example, just a few days ago, a man from the Tirindelli Appreciation Society in Italy found Tirindelli in my opera record catalog and asked about the piece (track 5 of side 2 of record 10 of a humongous Longines Symphonette 12-record set.) THEE: A good night. Tonight's film was D.W. Griffith's Battle of the Sexes, not a Keaton film, not really a \"funny women\" film either because, despite a few funny scenes, it wasn't intended to be all that funny. It centered on a wealthy family man who got taken in by a young blond gold-digger, and had to learn his lesson the hard way. After she'd taken him for a lot of money, diamonds, and such, his daughter went to the woman's apartment threatening to shoot her. The daughter and mistress got in a scuffle, the daughter dropped the gun, and the mistress locked it up. Her young boyfriend showed up just before the girl's dad. So the daughter and floosie's boyfriend ended up being relegated to a back room of the apartment while blondie let in the old guy. He eventually spotted the gold-headed cane of the young rake, whom he'd encountered in the apartment once before. Searching for him, he found the guy kissing his daughter. When daughter claimed the young rake was \"her boyfriend\" (a false claim if anything ever was), dad told her she was disgracing the family name . . . and eventually realized his double standard and went home. Rather than booting him, his wife forgave him, and the film ended as it began with the wife's birthday party, telling us that the whole story covered a year. As for the music, the score included WC's \"Dramatic Suspense.\" It came in at least three times, all during confrontation scenes in blondie's apartment. Worked well. I'd heard only a small bit of that piece in another film, but much more this time. Another nice piece, pretty typically WC, but not as good as \"Solemn Scenes from Nature,\" \"Andante Cantabile,\" and \"Plaintive.\" Well, maybe as good for a very different mood, but suspense isn't my thing, perhaps. This film exhausted me. Thirty-two oil paintings, huh? Gonna start an art gallery? That's far more paintings than I have framed sheet music in my office. Color is good. Let me know how that second \"Meet Your Neighbor\" comes out. Btw, I don't think you answered my question about the Monett Times. And why didn't you talk that sense into me last spring? Truth is, though, that I like the new books a whole lot better. The main instructional material may not change much, but the readings sure have. Of course, out of three reading classes, I can count the students on both hands (and maybe a toe or two) who bother to read them. (The readings, not the fingers and toes, that is.) Passed the Coffeyville Amazon distribution center today. What a place that would be to move in and read for the rest of my life. ME: manet or monett? one can not be sure >Did I mention making the Monett Times? Nope. >Btw, I don't think you answered my question about the Monett Times. There. I just did. When you first asked about mentioning making the Monett Times (as opposed to mentioning making the Monett Times) I went out and did a search for a~~~ in google news. Nothing. So I searched for \"monett times\", probably both within google news, and on the web itself. I seem to remember it had a very slender profile. I could repeat the experiment, but I'll betcha somebody is bustin' to spill the beans anyhow. >Thirty-two oil paintings, huh? Gonna start an art gallery? Maybe not in a perfectly conventional sense, but something like that has always been bouncing around my mind, even for the Kumon center. I don't know art, but I know what I hate. (Being silly there.) My claim is that you can take a bunch of paintings which aren't so great individually, perhaps even borderline execrable, and create a stunning effect by crowding them all on a wall. Museums are too wimpy in that regard. Another difference with my art gallery is that the tootees will be encouraged to steal their favorite painting. They didn't cost that much. (There is actually an entertaining story behind the bidding war, but it would take *way* too much to type it out.) So they'll just be more freebies to join my bookcase of freebies. Now, based on all that, yer probably doubting the artistic genius of these paintings. I have this to say about that: Candace Battaglia. Remember that name. You heard it here first. ME: I got the Panasonic answering machine about 2 weeks ago. It looks great and is in perfect operating condition, except for one thing. It records a crackling sound, both on the outgoing and incoming message tapes. (You could hear it by dialing 302-672-9356 some time when I'm not home.) Cleaning the heads did not make a difference. Otherwise, the recording is so clear that the crackle doesn't really affect the understandability, and most *normal* people might not worry about it. The problem is, I specifically need this style of answering machine because I archive messages of interest - generally, anything with personal content. And for archiving purposes, the crackle is not acceptable. I'll definitely have to keep searching till I find a machine in perfect condition. I'm cool as a cucumber, not upset or angry or anything. In the scheme of things, it's definitely no big deal. But I thought I'd fill you in and let you make the first suggestion about how we should handle it. Thanks! ME: Do you know about sitemaps? I've just been poking around in google and horrified to find that they say they only have 18 of my pages indexed. I'm guessing putting together and submitting a sitemap is no big deal, but all their instructions are somewhat overwhelming. I'm guessing that all I need is just a simple little file listing my web pages somehow. I'm hoping this is all baby stuff to you, and can get me going with a few words and simple example. ME: hobnobbing Went to Becky's funeral today. There were some big names there, not surprisingly. But mostly wanted to mention that Miss Becky's now resting 19 steps from Caesar Rodney. THEE: Subject: Home again, home again, jiggety jig 'bout enough said. I'll catch up . . . one of these days. Soon, I hope. THEE: Re: panasonic answering machine Sorry that the machine is not what you were looking for. Since you apparently cannot use the machine you may return the machine and I will refund your purchase price plus the original shipping amount once I receive it back. ME: That's very generous - thanks. I'll pack it up and send it off as soon as possible. ME: Great news. Before packing the answering machine up I had to get the few messages off of it. It never occurred to me the whole time I was editing and saving them on my computer, but it hit me later - no crackle! It turns out the crackle is not actually recorded on the tapes, but is added by the machine when either is played back. That doesn't matter much to me, so I'll keep the machine in service. Sorry to give you a fright. THEE: Just a reminder that your Meet Your Neighbor will rerun this Sunday in the State News. I have attached the profile, so you can make sure I have the right answers. Again, sorry for the confusion. ME: It looks pretty good. I think \"light bulbs\" is two words. Also, \"time frame\"? (Thanks for fixing \"racetrack\".) My dictionary shows \"one-on-one\" with hyphens, and \"one-on-two\" seems a reasonable extrapolation. Can I have a \". . .\" after micro-step evolution? I have other interests, plus the \". . .\" makes the answer seem more like a sentence. My dictionary shows \"down to earth\" with the small e. I think the idiom is more about down to the ground, or surface, or soil - not landing on the third planet from the sun. I suppose there are reasons that make it infeasible, but I wish my paragraph breaks could be observed. The way it is, all the bite-size ideas fall over each other. No chance I can have \"(It sure beats that mug shot over there.)\" restored? After all, for the reader, it's only a little chuckle, and might make a few more readers curious enough to visit my site. Could I have the \"What I feel strongly about:\" heading restored? I'd like the Golden Rule standing all by itself, plus those things I feel strongly about are not really guiding philosphies. Thanks for bearing with me. THEE: Re: hobnobbing Glad you went. And good to know that Becky is hobnobbing with Caesar Rodney, too. You leaving me in suspense? ME: Sorry, didn't mean to lead you on. Yes, that was the hobgobbling I was referring to. The big names were only Delaware- big, like Senator Carper and Governor Minner. No national- biggies that I was aware of. There was a really sweet picture of President Carter and Becky on display - wish there was a copy machine handy. ME: Re: manet or monett? one can not be sure I was wondering if the subject line rang any bells, or did I go too obscure this time? It was a running joke with some college buddies of mine. THEE: I stumbled across your site while looking for my daughter's Kumon center email, and although I don't have the time now to commit to reading at length now, I found it very interesting and jam-packed with many meaningful topics. I plan to read further about your experience with employment at Kumon. I confess to having mixed feelings about the program, one main reason being that the owner of this center holds a masters in ESL or something along those lines, is being paid to help my daughter with reading comprehension, yet shows difficulty expressing thoughts articulately and with proper English grammar. Adding insult to injury, I myself am a math teacher (yes, savor the irony!) and from what I've read on your site with regards to the lack of teaching conceptual math, I have to ask myself if this will benefit her in the long run. Just thought I'd acknowledge your site and say hello from the Windy City! :^) ME: Thanks for visiting. Sticking up for Kumon just a wee bit, remember that the Kumon instructor is really just a \"director\"; Kumon's success, or lack thereof, sits almost entirely upon the method and the materials. Regarding the benefits of Kumon, it's pretty clear from my web page that I have doubts. Still, the proof is in the pudding. I know of nothing concrete Kumon can point to. There is, or was, a study by TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Studies) in which Kumon participated (ca. Jul 2005). I haven't seen the results, if they are available yet. And even if I saw the results, whether they be positive or negative, I'd have my doubts about *them*. When you stop to think about it, you realize how fantastically difficult it is to measure such a thing. How \"average\" is the average Kumon student when he starts out? Is the great student a great student because of, or in spite of, Kumon? You really need a time machine so you could send the same student through life twice, with and without Kumon. But don't misunderstand; I would never argue that we shouldn't try anything unless we have firm, statistical proof IT WORKS! Things may have benefits in peripheral ways, or benefits that we don't even perceive. Is that enough rambling? Thanks again for stopping by! ME: You forgot to remind me about the paddlelball ball under my car. It's still in the parking lot, I guess. Still, I counted up about 100 useful freebies for my $2. I plan to put the really good ones, like the porcelain dolls, out around Christmastime. V~~ called me yesterday. Crazy as it sounds, we talked for probably 1.5 hours. It took him a long time to get around to what he wanted, so I'm not totally sure it's on the level. He wants to videotape me giving short math lectures, which can be downloaded from algebra.com for a fee. I'd get a royalty, which even he doesn't pretend would make anybody rich. ME: First of all disregard my frantic note about site maps. It looks like google maintains two entries for some of my pages, with the full-blown www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Lobby/7049 url, and the personalized www.geocities.com/donaldsauter. They say they have 18 of my pages indexed under the short form, but it seems like they've got most of them under the long form. Wanted your musical opinion on something. You noticed I flip- flopped gtr 1 and 2 where music was repeated in La Traviata. Do you think that improves the listening experience? I think it does, but somebody might say it's artificial and silly. If you like the idea of flip-flops, let me know where you think they'd be appropriate, and I'll cut and paste the parts. In our first five, I think a flip-flop would work well in Norma 2 (\"No. 13\"), in the top section of both pages. (You 8 measures; me 8 measures; you for the rest of the page.) If that sounds good, let me know and I'll do a paste up and mail it to you. ME: It's been a while since I tuned into the crazy man's doings. Looks like he got 29 votes in the primary election. THEE: Re: manet or monett? one can not be sure Manet or Monet would have made perfect sense because I'm pretty well up on my artists. Then, of course, Monett fit this occasion though Missourians would never go for the pronunciation. You oughta see what they do with the town name Bolivar! Spanish, French, whatever, they're gonna term it into 100% Missourah! THEE: Re: manet or monett? one can not be sure Are you going to tell me where the question originated? ME: 'Deed I will, to the best of my abilities. Apparently there was a PBS series in the early 1970s (or maybe \"Educational tv\" back then) that discussed art, or perhaps there were art-related episodes in a more general series about culture or civilization or something like that. (Wid me?) Of course, it was all very high-brow, and the host was a brainy J. Bronowski sort. He introduced one of the art episodes by displaying an impressionistic painting and asking, \"Manet? Or Monet? One can not be sure,\" and indulging in a little high-browed chuckle, which I don't begrudge him at all. It's good. Again, I never actually saw this, but some college friends had a good time with that line, impersonating the host and including his chuckle. Don't press me for exactly what sort of circumstances calls for this quote. I waited 30-some years for the perfect opportunity. While I'm writing, let me pass on to one person in the universe that I believe Mark Twain's \"How I Edited An Agricultural Paper\" was almost definitely inspired by that \"John Phoenix Renders An Account Of His Stewardship\" story/editorial I mentioned recently. I'm not complaining; Twain's is hilarious, too. Here's a reckoning of the contents of the box I bought at Tuesday's auction: 29 small plastic/metal/wood toys 13 plush toys, normal 10 jigsaw puzzles 1 story on cassette 2 musical instruments (uke, maracca) 5 porcelain dolls 12 plush toys, high class 5 electronic games, trains 10 gooshy purple brains, in cellophane Looks like 87 freebies for the kids. Not bad for $2? THEE: Re: manet or monett? one can not be sure >You need my nattering like a hole in the head, but I was wondering if the subject line rang any bells, or did I go too obscure this time? E-mails like yours help me keep my sanity. >While I'm writing, let me pass on to one person in the universe that I believe Mark Twain's \"How I Edited An Agricultural Paper\" was almost definitely inspired by that \"John Phoenix Renders An Account Of His Stewardship\" story/editorial I mentioned recently.

ME: eddie or claude, who knows? >Figured the line had a history since I've heard it before. Aha, that's what I was wondering, whether it was strictly an in- joke, or whether it made any impression on the public at large. Veddy interessant. Thanks for the link to Twain's dissertation on German. I laughed continuously. In one spot he made hay with the heavy duty done by Schlag and Zug in German. Coincidentally, not so many minutes before I had worked out Nebelzug in an aria from Weber's Oberon. Zug's main def. is train, of course, and I don't think I've ever seen an opera translator get so literal, rendering Nebelzug as \"train of mist\". I'm wondering if the writer had anything more in mind than \"fog\". Actually, that writer was himself a translator, since Weber's Oberon was written in English. So why must I wrestle with arias in German when they started out in English??? And another ??? for good measure. I recently bought the complete opera from amazon - and got German. :( And not only were the spoken parts not literal translations, they were redone and changed completely, even adding different characters! So fat lot of good it did sitting there with an English libretto, itself painfully extracted from the web. (\"And if elected, I promise literal translations of the most popular 60,000 operas, freely available on one shiny little cd...\") I had to laugh throughout his list of suggestions for improvements to German. I don't exactly know why, but our ordinal numbers in adverbial form have always sounded somewhat nutty to me - firstly, secondly, etc. By the time Twain got up to seventhly, I was squirming around helplessly on the floor. I wanted to send you a link to Twain's hilarious \"Our Italian Guide\" in his Library of Humor. At first glance, it looked like the web didn't have it, but further sleuthing shows it is an extract from a chapter of his The Innocents Abroad. http://twain.thefreelibrary.com/The-Innocents-Abroad/27-1 Start with the line: In this connection I wish to say one word about Michael Angelo Buonarotti. . . and end at: --or by George we'll brain you!\" Couldn't help thinking about Phyllis when I read this.

Just so you all can spend the rest of the day laughing your heads off, here's the letter I sent again: [pasted in letter] ME: dames >I don't think we have auctions like that around here. Looking for a career change? Wanna do something fun? Got a touch of the entrepreneur in you? Could you stand being filthy rich? Came back from today's auction empty-handed - hoo-ray for me. Actually, it was just dumb luck that, even after starting up a 2nd auctioneer, it looked like more than an hour before they'd get to that great, huge grab-bag of kid's toys that would've kept me in stock for years. The Delaware State News ran my \"Meet Your Neighbor\" on Sunday. Haven't gotten up courage to see what they did to it. But it made me something of a celebrity at the auction today. I mentioned the auction as one of my favorite regular activities. I risked closing out with, \"And the auctioneer is quite a funny guy, even when we put him in a bad mood!\" (I ask you, what makes editors so afraid of me?) As I was looking up and down the rows, Blake took a moment out from his auctioning to holler out, \"Hey, there he is! That's my hero! There's the guy interviewed by the Delaware State News!\" Being taken by surprise, the best I could do was a few bows to the crowd looking my way. Later, another friendly young man came up and told me I was the guy in the newspaper. He mentioned they put a copy of it up in the office of the auction. I hope all my thoughts in the column designed to save the world have as much effect. Forgot to put a funny little thing in my last email about German and translations thereof. This is part of a duet from the atonal, ultra-modern (for 1961) comic opera \"The Barber of Darmstadt, by Bruno Heinz Jaja. Tenor: Tenor: Wer war die Dame, Who was the dame mit welcher ich Sie with whom I you gestern gesehen habe? yesterday seen have? Bass: Bass: Das war keine Dame. That was no dame. Das war That was meine Frau. my wife. Translation of the German libretto was by William Mann, the British music critic who a few years later would create a bit of a stir by hearing \"pandiatonic clusters\" and \"aeolian cadences\" in the Beatles' music. Finally getting back to finishing up The Peterkin Papers. I'd laugh a little harder if I was a little more sure there was a definite line separating me from the Peterkins. I'm having a new roof put on my house Thursday. Keep your fingers crossed for me, even if it makes your teaching chores awkward. THEE: I wanted to thank you for your generous mention of my name under your Wine and Water problem. Every now and then I google my name, that comes right up and well - it's nice to see the web has something nice to say about me ! I'm very interested in problems like these. The best solution to W&W teaches us nothing really about fluid dynamics, but packs a huge lesson as to the workings of the human mind. The solution itself causes one to say \"Oh. Geez. Of course.\" The question is why does virtually nobody see that solution first? It's rather like an optical illusion, which gives a vivid example of how the mind can be led down the wrong path. I thought of the best solution first, but my brain works a little differently. I am slightly autistic. I'd love to claim earth- shattering brilliance, but I believe it's because I lack certain abilities that I wasn't drawn down the wrong path. Like a color- blind person won't be fooled by certain optical illusions. In scientific thought, \"divide and conquer\" is a tried and true strategy. When faced with almost any problem, the best thing to do is get a careful look at what all the component parts are up to, and think about them. In a few cases (like the W&W problem) however, this scheme fails spectacularly. It's a peculiarity of my form of autism that breaking something down into its components is very, very difficult for me to do. My brain cannot re-integrate the component parts back into the whole, and I get overwhelmed. For instance, if I get too close to a tree I am visually overwhelmed by hundreds of leaves, veins in leaves, pattern in bark, etc. So my brain is naturally aversive to componentizing things. The W&W problem seduces the listener into deconstructing the components and mechanisms; the transfer cup, the fluid percentages, the two-pass transfer, etc. The scientific brain goes there *first*, because that's where the answer usually is. So they miss the real answer, which lies outside the system, and is simply \"liquid is conserved.\" There are two other puzzles that point up, I believe, this same issue. Two cars start off 10 miles apart, heading toward each other at 10 miles an hour. A fly takes off from the bumper of car one and heads to car 2, with a ground-speed of 20 mph. When the fly reaches the bumper of car 2, it reverses direction and heads to car 1, repeating this pattern until the cars collide head-on. How much ground does the fly cover before its squished (as if it had an odometer, so doubling back still counts as more distance.)? Many people will calculate the distance the fly takes goin from car1 to car2, then from car2 back to 1, and so on. It forms an infinite series. They find the value of the series. But the best solution is to simply say : the cars collide 30 minutes later. In 30 minutes the fly has gone 10 miles. This is another example where the reader is drawn into the *mechanisms* and misses the underlying principle. At least in both these problems, the reader is drawn to the correct answer, if by complicated means. But there is another infamous problem, the Monty Hall Problem, where some great mathematicians like Paul Erdos have given the wrong answer - and vehemently defended it - because they get trapped into thinking about the problems components rather than its underlying principles. You can imagine how gratifying it is for someone like me, with a cognitive impairment, to be able to offer insight to a 'normal' person. There is an ancient fable where a bird sees a cheetah blazing across a field. The bird asks the cheetah \"Why are you so amazingly fast?\" The cheetah says, \"Because I can't fly.\" There are many cognitive tasks which I cannot do that a normal 10 year old can. But nature, in her wisdom, made both birds and cheetahs. ME: thinking Thanks for getting in touch. You have a fascinating story. You're right about the fly between the two cars problem. When I was first exposed to that problem I thought you would have to do it step by painful step - never mind wondering how you were supposed to handle an infinity of them. When you mentioned the Monty Hall problem, my first thought was to wonder if you saw my thoughts on my web site. Then I realized I never put them on the web. I claim that Marilyn vos Savant never stated the problem rigorously, and I wrote to her about it. I got that confused with a couple of rounds of vos Savant bashing in my web pages. I looked over the wikipedia entry on the Monty Hall problem, which takes pains to state it rigorously. My contribution to the discussion is that what's interesting about the problem is that it only takes a few real life trials, using 3 cards for instance (a joker and two deuces, say), to make the average person think, \"Aha, I see what's going on!\" No need for page after page of explanations and discussion!

Just getting caught up with digests to that point. I'm a bit teary-eyed. At one juncture in the interview, as Paul mentions a plan to record with Ringo, the inevitable question of whether the Beatles will get back together is asked. Since this is an early 80's interview, our dear John is still very much alive. It's a poignant few moments some 26-years-ago. One almost begs, in hindsight, for the opportunity to warn Paul that they better get back together NOW because in just a few months the chance will be forever gone... ME: October 13, 2006 a bit of exercise Got a new roof today. John let me help. Said he couldn't give a discount, though. Didn't matter to me; what's 6 hours times 6 bucks, anyhow? But when we squared up the bill, he insisted on knocking $50 off. Started about 8:30 and they were gone a little before 3:30. Turns out I won't be needing a magnet after all. The roof looks great from on top. From below, you don't get the effect. Like all work I have done, something has to be worse than when it started. When I went to turn on the kitchen light, now it won't come on. Just a coincidence, or related to the roof work? I'll take it apart tomorrow, but I can't imagine I'll see anything wrong. ME: Back in 2002 I made a tape recording of a record in my collection that had Tirindelli's Reverie. You very generously sent a 2-cd collection of songs by Tirindelli, \"La versatilita\", which I've enjoyed immensely. More recently I've been transferring my records to cd when I play them. I've just transferred the entire 12-record set, \"The LONGINES Symphonette: Treasury of the World's Most Honored Musical Favorites\" onto one cd in mp3 format. I was thinking you might like a copy, since it places the Tirindelli selection in perspective with the 150 or so other selections. In fact, I'm *hoping* you'd like a copy, since it's much n"
