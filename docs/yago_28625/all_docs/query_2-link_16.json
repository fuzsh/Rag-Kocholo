        "text": "From the Emperor’s Desk: In Part one I will address the Grand Dukes family background and reign. In Part two I will address his two marriages.\n\nLeopold II (October 3, 1797 – January 29, 1870) was a member of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine and was Grand Duke of Tuscany from 1824 to 1859. Leopold was recognised contemporarily as a liberal monarch, authorising the Tuscan Constitution of 1848, and allowing a degree of press freedom.\n\nBorn in Florence, Leopold II was the son of Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany and Princess Luisa Maria Amelia Teresa of the Two Sicilies, who were double first cousins. His maternal grandparents were King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and Archduchess Marie Carolina of Austria.\n\nFamily Background\n\nHis father, Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany, born an Archduke of Austria, was the second son of Archduke Leopold of Austria, then the ruling Grand Duke Leopold I of Tuscany, and his wife, Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain, daughter of King Carlos III of Spain, formerly King of Naples and Sicily, and and his wife Princess Maria Amalia of Saxony.\n\nWhen Archduke Ferdinand III’s father was elected Emperor Leopold II of the Holy Roman Empire, Archduke Ferdinand succeeded him as Grand Duke of Tuscany, officially taking the office on July 22, 1790.\n\nGrand Duke Ferdinand III of Tuscany was also the Prince-Elector and Grand Duke of Salzburg (1803–1805) and Grand Duke (and briefly Prince-Elector) of Würzburg (1805–1814), during the time he had been deposed as Grand Duke of Tuscany during the Napoleonic Wars. On May 30, 1814, after Napoleon’s fall, Ferdinand was restored as Grand Duke of Tuscany.\n\nGrand Duke Leopold II of Tuscany’s mother, Princess Luisa Maria Amelia Teresa of the Two Sicilies, was a double first cousin to her husband, was a member of the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, and was the daughter of King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and his wife, Archduchess Maria Carolina of Austria, thirteenth child of Empress Maria Theresa, (Queen of Bohemia, Hungary, Croatia and Archduchess of Austria in her own right) and her husband Holy Roman Emperor Franz I, former Duke of Lorraine.\n\nPrincess Luisa Maria Amelia’s paternal grandparents were King Carlos III of Spain and Princess Maria Amalia of Saxony.\n\nSuccession\n\nArchduke Leopold succeeded his father upon his death on June 18, 1824 and became Grand Duke Leopold II of Tuscany. During the first twenty years of his reign he devoted himself to the internal development of the state.\n\nHis was the mildest and least reactionary of all the Italian despotisms of the day, and although always subject to Austrian influence he refused to adopt the Austrian methods of government, allowed a fair measure of liberty to the press, and permitted many political exiles from other states to dwell in Tuscany undisturbed.\n\nDuring the early 1840s unrest spread throughout Italy, even in Tuscany demands for a constitution and other political reforms were advanced; in 1845 and 1846, riots occurred in various parts of the country, and Leopold granted a number of administrative reforms. But Austrian influence prevented him from doing more, even had he wished to do so.\n\nThe election of Pope Pius IX gave fresh encouragement to Liberalism, and on September 4, 1847 Leopold instituted the National Guard – a preparation for a constitution; soon afterward the Marchese Cosimo Ridolfi (1794–1865) was appointed Prime Minister. The granting of the Neapolitan and Piedmontese constitutions was followed (February 17, 1848) by that of Tuscany, written by Gino Capponi.\n\nNew elections in the autumn of 1848 returned a constitutional majority, but it ended by voting in favour of a constituent assembly. There was talk of instituting a central Italian kingdom with Leopold as king, to form part of a larger Italian federation, but in the meanwhile Grand Duke Leopold II alarmed at the revolutionary and republican agitations in Tuscany encouraged by the success of the Austrian troops, was, according to Montanelli, negotiating with Field Marshal Radetzky and with Pope Pius IX, who had now abandoned his liberal policies.\n\nGrand Duke Leopold II had left Florence for Siena, and eventually for Porto Santo Stefano, leaving a letter to Francesco Domenico Guerrazzi in which, on account of a protest from Pope Pius IX, he declared that he could not agree to the proposed constituent assembly. The utmost confusion prevailed in Florence and other parts of Tuscany.\n\nOn February 1849 a Republic was proclaimed and on that same day Leopold sailed for Gaeta. A third parliament was elected and Guerrazzi appointed dictator. But there was great discontent, and the defeat of King Charles Albert of Sardinia at Novara caused consternation among the Liberals.\n\nThe majority, while fearing an Austrian invasion, desired the return of the Grand Duke who had never been unpopular, and in April 1849 the municipal council usurped the powers of the assembly and invited him to return, “to save us by means of the restoration of the constitutional monarchy surrounded by popular institutions, from the shame and ruin of a foreign invasion.” Leopold accepted, although he said nothing about the foreign invasion, and on May 1, sent Count Luigi Serristori to Tuscany with full powers.\n\nBut at the same time the Austrians occupied Lucca and Livorno, and although Grand Duke Leopold II faked surprise at their actions it has since been proved, as the Austrian General d’Aspre declared at the time, that Austrian intervention was due to the request of the Grand Duke Leopold II himself.\n\nOn the 25th of July the Austrians entered Florence and on July 28th Leopold himself returned. In April 1850 he concluded a treaty with Austria suspending the continuation for an indefinite period of the Austrian occupation with 10,000 men; in September he dismissed parliament, and the next year established a concordat with the Church of a very clerical character.\n\nHe feebly asked Austria if he might maintain the constitution, and the Austrian premier, Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg, advised him to consult Pope Pius IX, King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies, Duke Charles II of Parma and Duke Francis V of Modena.\n\nOn their advice he formally revoked the constitution (1852). Political trials were held, Guerrazzi and many others being condemned to long terms of imprisonment, and although in 1855 the Austrian troops left Tuscany, Leopold’s popularity was gone.\n\nGrand Duke Leopold II attempted a policy of neutrality with regard to the Second Italian War of Independence but was expelled by a bloodless coup on April 27, 1859, just before the beginning of the war. The Grand Ducal family left for Bologna, which was then papal territory since the Congress of Vienna of 1814.\n\nTuscany was occupied by soldiers of King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia for the duration of the conflict. The Armistice of Villafranca, agreed to between Emperor Napoleon III of France and Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria on July 11th, provided for the return of the Habsburg-Lorraines to Florence, but Leopold himself was considered too unpopular to be accepted, and on July 21, 1859, he abdicated the throne in favour of his son, Archduke Ferdinand, technically Grand Duke Ferdinand IV of Tuscany, who never reigned, but issued a protest from Dresden (26 March 1860).\n\nBecause the new Grand Duke Ferdinand IV of Tuscany wasn’t any more acceptable to the revolutionaries in control of Florence, his accession was not proclaimed. Instead, the provisional government proclaimed the deposition of the House of Habsburg on August 16, 1859.\n\nThe former Grand Duke Leopold II of Tuscany spent his last years in Austria, and died in Rome on January 29th, 1870.\n\nMaria Sophie, Duchess in Bavaria October 4, 1841 – January 19, 1925) the last Queen consort of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.\n\nEarly life\n\nMaria Sophie was born on October 4, 1841, at the Possenhofen Castle in Possenhofen, the Kingdom of Bavaria. Her parents were Princess Ludovika of Bavaria and Duke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria. She was the sixth of ten children and one of the eight that survived to adulthood. She and her siblings enjoyed an unrestricted childhood, shared between Possenhofen Castle in the summers and the Herzog-Max-Palais in Munich.\n\nShe was the younger sister of the better-known Elisabeth of Bavaria (“Sisi”) who married Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria.\n\nIn the winter of 1857, at the age of 16, Marie Sophie’s hand was sought by Francis, Crown Prince of Naples, Duke of Calabria, and the eldest son of King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies. The marriage was political, since King Ferdinand II wished to ally himself with the Emperor of Austria, Franz Josef I, a powerful fellow absolutist.\n\nAt that time the kingdom was already threatened by revolutionary forces. At that time Marie Sophie had not experienced menarche, and underwent treatments to induce menses. She also had to learn Italian.\n\nIn January 1859 she traveled to Vienna to spend time with her sister before they went to Trieste to formally enter her new kingdom, and say farewell to her family on the Neapolitan royal yacht Fulminante. She set sail for Bari on February 3, 1859.\n\nQueen\n\nOn January 8, 1859 in Munich at the Allerheiligen-Hofkirche Maria Sophie was married by proxy and then again married in-person on February 3, 1859 in Bari to Prince Francis, the Duke of Calabria, the eldest son of King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies and his first wife, Maria Christina of Savoy.\n\nWithin the year, with the death of the king, her husband ascended to the throne as King Francis II of the Two Sicilies, and Maria Sophie became Queen of a realm that was shortly to be overwhelmed by the forces of Giuseppe Garibaldi and the Piedmontese army.\n\nIn September 1860, as the Garibaldine troops were moving towards Naples, his capital, King Francis II decided to leave the city. At the beginning, he planned to organise a resistance in Capua. However, after that city had also been lost to the Garibaldines in the aftermath of the battle of the Volturnus (October), he and Marie Sophie took refuge in the strong coastal fortress of Gaeta, 80 km north of Naples.\n\nDuring the Siege of Gaeta in late 1860 and early 1861, the forces of King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia-Piedmont bombarded and eventually overcame the defenders. It was this brief “last stand of the Bourbons” that gained Marie Sophie the reputation of the strong “warrior queen” that stayed with her for the rest of her life. She was tireless in her efforts to rally the defenders, giving them her own food, caring for the wounded, and daring the attackers to come within range of the fortress cannon.\n\nRome\n\nWith the fall of Gaeta and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, Marie Sophie and her husband went into exile in Rome, the capital of what for 1,000 years had been the sizeable Papal States, a large piece of central Italy but which, by 1860, had been reduced to the city of Rome, itself, as the armies of Victor Emanuel II came down from the north to join up with Garibaldi, the conqueror of the south.\n\nKing Francis II set up a government in exile in Rome that enjoyed diplomatic recognition by most European states for a few years as still the legitimate government of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.\n\nHer wealth and privilege were, to a certain extent, overshadowed by personal tragedies. Her marriage was not consummated for many years, as her husband suffered from phimosis.\n\nFrancis II (January 16, 1836 – December 27, 1894) was King of the Two Sicilies from 1859 to 1861.\n\nEarly life\n\nThe only son and heir of King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies by his first wife, Princess Maria Christina of Savoy, the youngest daughter of King Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia-Piedmont and Archduchess Maria Teresa of Austria-Este.\n\nPrincess Maria Christina of Savoy’s maternal grandparents were Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este and Maria Beatrice Ricciarda d’Este. Archduke Ferdinand was the fourteenth child and third son born to Franz I Stefan, Holy Roman Emperor, and Empress Maria Theresa, Queen of Hungary, Bohemia and Croatia and Archduchess of Austria. Maria Beatrice was the eldest daughter of Ercole III d’Este and Maria Teresa Cybo-Malaspina, Duchess of Massa and Princess of Carrara.\n\nKing Francis II was the last of the Bourbon kings of Naples and Sicily (Kingdom of the Two Sicilies), where he was born in 1836. His education had been much neglected and he proved a man of weak character, greatly influenced by his stepmother Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, whom he feared, and also by the priests, and by the camarilla, or reactionary court set.\n\nOn February 3, 1859 in Bari, Francis married Duchess Maria Sophie of Bavaria, of the royal Bavarian House of Wittelsbach. Duchess Maria Sophie was one of the ten children of Maximilian Joseph, Duke in Bavaria and Princess Ludovika of Bavaria. She was a younger sister of Empress Elisabeth “Sissi” of Austria).\n\nMaria Sophie, along with Elisabeth, was a great beauty. However, their marriage was unhappy. Their only daughter, Maria Cristina, was born ten years after her parents married, and lived only three months (December 24, 1869 – March 28, 1870).\n\nThe Two Sicilies\n\nThe kingdom was formed when the Kingdom of Sicily merged with the Kingdom of Naples. The Kingdom of Naples was officially also known as the Kingdom of Sicily. Since both kingdoms were named Sicily, they were collectively known as the “Two Sicilies” (Utraque Sicilia, literally “both Sicilies”), and the unified kingdom adopted this name.\n\nReign\n\nFrancis II took the throne on May 22, 1859, after the death of his father. For the post of prime minister he at once appointed Carlo Filangieri, who, realizing the importance of the Franco-Piedmontese victories in Lombardy, advised Francis II to accept the alliance with the Kingdom of Sardinia proposed by Cavour.\n\nCavour proposed an alliance to divide the Papal States between Piedmont and Naples (the province of Rome excepted), but Francis rejected an idea which to him seemed like heresy. Filangieri strongly advocated a Constitution as the only measure which might save the dynasty, but on the king’s refusal he resigned.\n\nGaribaldi’s invasion\n\nMeanwhile, the revolutionary parties were conspiring for the overthrow of the Bourbons in Calabria and Sicily, and Giuseppe Garibaldi was preparing for a raid in the south of Italy. A conspiracy in Sicily was discovered and the plotters punished with brutal severity, but Rosalino Pilo and Francesco Crispi, who had organized the movement, escaped execution. When Garibaldi landed at Marsala (May 1860) with his Expedition of the Thousand, he conquered the Sicilian island with astonishing ease.\n\nThese events at last coaxed Francis II into granting a constitution, but its promulgation was followed by disorders in Naples and the resignation of several ministers; Liborio Romano became head of the government.\n\nThe disintegration of the army and navy proceeded apace, and Cavour sent a Piedmontese squadron carrying troops on board to watch over these events. Garibaldi, who had crossed the strait of Messina, was advancing northwards and was everywhere received by the people as a liberator.\n\nAfter long hesitations and even an appeal to Garibaldi himself, and on the advice of Romano, Francis II left Naples on September 6 with his wife Maria Sophia, the court and the diplomatic corps (except the French and British ministers), and went by sea to Gaeta, where a large part of the army was concentrated.\n\nThe next day Garibaldi entered Naples, was enthusiastically welcomed, and formed a provisional government.\n\nPiedmontese invasion\n\nKing Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia-Piedmont had decided on the invasion of the Papal States, and after occupying Umbria and the Marche entered the Neapolitan kingdom. Garibaldi’s troops defeated the Neapolitan royalists at the Battle of Volturno (which took place on October 1, 1860), while the Piedmontese captured Capua.\n\nBy late 1860, only Gaeta, Messina, and Civitella del Tronto still held out. The Siege of Gaeta by the Piedmontese began on November 6, 1860. Both Francis II and his wife behaved with great coolness and courage.\n\nEven when the French fleet, whose presence had hitherto prevented an attack by sea, was withdrawn, they still resisted. It was not until February 13, 1861 that the fortress capitulated and Francis II was deposed.\n\nOverthrow\n\nThus, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies ceased to exist. After the overthrow he people voted in a plebiscite to join the Savoyard Kingdom of Sardinia. The annexation of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies completed the first phase of Italian unification, and the new Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed in 1861.\n\nKing Francis II and Queen Maria Sophia first lived in Rome as guests of the Pope Pius IX, where they maintained a government in exile recognized by some Catholic powers including France, Spain, Austria and Bavaria.\n\nAfter the Prussian victory against Austria in 1866 and subsequent expansion of Italian territory, they disbanded this government and left Rome before it was occupied by the Italians in 1870. They led a wandering life from then on, living in Austria, France, and Bavaria.\n\nIn 1894, Francis died at Arco in Trentino (now north-eastern Italy, but at the time in Austria-Hungary). His widow survived him by 31 years and died in Munich. Upon the death of Francis II, his half-brother, Prince Alfonso, became the pretender to the throne of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.\n\nCause of beatification and canonization\n\nOn December 11, 2020, the cause of the beatification of King Francis II of the Two Sicilies was introduced by the Cardinal Crescenzio Sepe, the Archbishop of Naples. Pope Francis declared the king a Servant of God."
