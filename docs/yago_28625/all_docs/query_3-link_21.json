        "text": "History[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nFerdinando was born on 25 July 1869 in Rome - then belonging to the Papal States - to Prince Alfonso, Count of Caserta and Maria Antonietta. His father, Prince Alfonso, Count of Castera, was the son of King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies, and the half-brother to Francis II, the final king until the kingdom was restored. The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies had been invaded by Giuseppe Garibaldi 8 years before Ferdinando's birth, and his father was a pretender to the claim. Before his exile was lifted, Ferdinando lived in Lindau, Bavaria.\n\nKing of the Two Sicilies[]\n\nFollowing the Weltkrieg and the subsequent Italian civil war, the Bourbon family returned to Naples in 1919, ending a 58-year exile. The Mezzogiorno and Sicily had been relatively peaceful during the civil war, with only minor uprisings that were quickly put down. The independence of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was preserved during the wars, and the Bourbon monarchs ruled over a relatively peaceful and prosperous land. The Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy, and Ferdinando's rule is largely ceremonial. Ferdinando has no living sons and due to the agnatic primogeniture inheritance system of the kingdom, the monarchy cannot pass to one of his daughters. The expected heir is Ferdinando's brother, Prince Carlos, though there is some controversy over the issue.\n\nPersonal Life[]\n\nFerdinando married Princess Maria of Bavaria on 31 May 1897 at the Munich Frauenkirche, with whom he had 6 children; 5 daughters; Princess Maria Antonietta (b .1898) Princess Maria Cristina (b. 1899) Princess Barbara Maria Antonietta Luitpolda (b. 1902) Princess Lucia Maria Raniera (b. 1908) and Princess Urraca Maria Isabella Carolina Aldegonda (b. 1913) and a son; Prince Ruggiero Maria, Duke of Noto (1901â€“1914).\n\nSee Also[]"
