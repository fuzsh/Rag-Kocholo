Ferdinand II was King of the Two Sicilies from 1830 until his death in 1859. He initially promised liberal reforms but grew increasingly autocratic, violently suppressing revolts in Sicily in 1837 and across his kingdom in 1848 in response to demands for a constitution. His repression earned him the nickname \"King Bomb.\" He died in 1859 shortly before the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was invaded and annexed by the Kingdom of Sardinia during the Italian unification process.",
