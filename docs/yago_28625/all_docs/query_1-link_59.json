        "text": "Family\n\nMaria Cristina was the youngest daughter of King Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia and Archduchess Maria Teresa of Austria-Este.\n\nHer maternal grandparents were Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este and Maria Beatrice Ricciarda d'Este. Ferdinand was the fourteenth child and third son born to Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor, and Maria Theresa of Austria. Maria Beatrice was the eldest daughter of Ercole III d'Este and Maria Teresa Cybo-Malaspina, Duchess of Massa and Princess of Carrara.\n\nQueen\n\nOn 21 November 1832, Maria Cristina married Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies. The bride was twenty years old and the groom twenty-two.\n\nMaria Cristina was described as beautiful but also timid and shy: modest and reserved, she was never comfortable at the royal court. Her relationship to Ferdinand was not happy, and he had little patience for her nervous modesty.\n\nShe died at the age of 23, after having given birth 5 days before to her only child, Francis II of the Two Sicilies.\n\nBeatification\n\nOn 10 July 1872 she was declared to be a Servant of God, on 6 May 1937 a Venerable Servant of God, and on 3 May 2013 Pope Francis authorised a decree recognising a miracle due to her intercession, a further stage on her process to beatification. Her beatification took place on 25 January 2014 at the Basilica of Santa Chiara, where she is buried, making her Blessed Maria Cristina of Savoy.\n\nTitles and styles\n\n14 November 1812 – 21 November 1832: Her Royal Highness Princess Maria Cristina of Savoy, Princess of Sardinia.\n\n21 November 1832 – 21 January 1836: Her Majesty The Queen of the Two Sicilies.\n\nPosthumously:\n\n10 July 1872 – 6 May 1937: Servant of God Maria Cristina of Savoy, Queen of the Two Sicilies.\n\n6 May 1937 – 25 January 2014: Venerable Servant of God Maria Cristina of Savoy, Queen of the Two Sicilies."
