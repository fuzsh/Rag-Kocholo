        "text": "The Altavilla (Hauteville) and the Creation of the “Kingdom”\n\nIt was the “Kingdom” per excellence. Its territory was delineated since the very first years of its creation under Roger II of Altavilla and remained unchanged along the centuries until its fall in 1861: its northern boundary followed a line that stretched out from Civitella del Tronto (south of Ascoli) to Gaeta and touched Leonessa, L’Aquila (north of Pontecorvo) and then continued south to the Tyrrhenian Sea; its southern boundary was the sea itself, including Sicily. After the fall of the Roman Empire, part of the territories that would then form the Kingdom were under the Byzantine rule (Southern Apulia, Calabria, Sicily and the Duchy of Naples); others were under the Longobard rule (the Duchy of Benevento); in the IX century Sicily fell under Muslim rule. In the subsequent centuries, especially in the 11th century, the geopolitical situation of southern Italy showed a sad breaking up into small local states, whereas the ancient Byzantine and Longobard dominions gradually lost the control of the situation.\n\nA sort of “war of all against all” was the gradual outcome of this situation, worsened by the continuous Saracen raids. The South of Italy grew weaker and poorer: the Normans, led by the bold family of the Altavilla (Hauteville) were able to profit of this situation.\n\nAround the 11th century the first Norman mercenaries came to enrol in the armies of the various lords fighting each other; in this mercenary policy, the Altavilla stood out and were able to create an earldom of their own in Melfi in 1043.\n\nFrom that moment on, their political and military expansion was steady (especially under Robert the Guiscard, who conquered Apulia and Calabria) until they meddled also in the War of Investitures and were unscrupulously able to make the Pontiffs acknowledge their infeudation of the Church’s Southern dominions (in 1091 they expelled the Muslims from Sicily). Then, in 1130, Roger II of Altavilla (1101-1154) succeeded in convincing Pope Anacletus II to proclaim him King of Sicily, Apulia and Calabria (although he was the Pope’s vassal) and subsequently ruled also on Capua, Benevento and Naples. That was the formal birth of the Kingdom of Naples, at that time called “Kingdom of Sicily”.\n\nWilliam I the Evil (1154-1166), William II the Good (1166-1189), Tancred (1189-1194), and William III (1194) succeeded Roger II."
