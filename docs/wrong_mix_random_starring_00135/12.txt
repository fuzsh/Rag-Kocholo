THOMAS Thurston, venture capital data scientist and managing director of WR Hambrecht, has been announced as the keynote speaker for the 2017 Marketing Conference program.

Thurston's work led him to develop the Market Exaptation Simulation Engine (MESE) a quantum based computing system which predicts the likelihood of a startup's success while measuring its corporate growth efforts.

Thurston was motivated by the experience of launching an intel business that was ultimately spun-out and acquired by a competitor.

Thurston will share his journey, knowledge, and wisdom, along with the ongoing research that drives his life's ambition to reduce business failure at the 2017 Marketing Conference.

The Conference, which is themed 'Chasing Unicorns: Capturing Relevance in a Transient World', is to be held in Brisbane on the 8th of June at the Pullman.
