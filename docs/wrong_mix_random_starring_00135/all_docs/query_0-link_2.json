        "text": "For the last 18 months the Two Tribes podcast has been uncovering the real stories of Australian start-up founders and investors. Through our partnership with Tank Stream Labs we have had everyone from first time founders starting up (Parallel Parking, Share with Oscar, and Mashay) tear away successes (Shippit, Recomazing, BrickX, and Car Next Door) as well as experienced investors/mentors like Annie Parker, Michelle Duvall, Mike Zimmerman and Thomas Thurston.\n\nNow at our 35th episode we felt we would have a bit of fun and release the last 3 episodes of the year at the same time to encourage a bit of 'binge mode' for the loyal Two Tribes listeners. Also it is a good time to announce our plans for the new 2018 season of Two Tribes - exciting!\n\nTwo Tribes 'Binge Fest'\n\nThe last 3 episodes of the year cover 3 very different types of stories so by listening to all three you will get a sense of the breadth and depth of the other episodes on Two Tribes.\n\nEp.35 - Millie Zinner & Alice Pritchard Davies - Motherhood App\n\nThese first time founders have created a service which connects mums to other mums for childcare - a community and network of families. On the podcast we hear about where the idea for Motherhood App came from including harking back to primal roots where communities used to raise kids together. Millie and Alice are old school friends who have a passion for childcare and could see a problem space parents who are strapped for time, money and balancing demanding jobs. Great to hear the story of two aussie female founders solving an issue for Aussie parents.\n\nEp.36 - Two Space - Tashi Dorjee\n\nTwo Space identifies un- or under-utilised spaces like restaurants and bars for start up teams to use as co-working space and also plays a role in connecting and sharing across this community. It is now open in locations in Sydney and Melbourne and prides itself on being affordable and unique. We hear about the founding story of Two Space and in particular the unique mix of physical and technical requirements for a business like Two Space. Tashi Dorjee is the Chief Space Officer and is a serial entrepreneur who previously built and led Carbon Conservation a sustainability-tech business. From Tashi we learn about his 'hustle in' approach to entrepreneurship and how he balances his time on the business.\n\nEp.37 - Zynga, Y Combinator, GAP - Marcus Segal\n\nTwo Tribes meets with Marcus Segal the former COO of Zynga, mentor at Y Combinator and the Google Launchpad Accelerator Program and GP at UpShift Capital. Marcus was in Australia for StartCon in Sydney in December and stopped for a discussion on his start up story, advice for founders and investors and his perspectives on the Australian start up ecosystem. Marcus describes himself as 'gasoline on the fire' for new businesses in that he loves to build, scale and operate businesses. This is a candid discussion about growing and scaling business and the Australian start up community. My favourite quote from this podcast:\n\nThis tall poppy stuff... you guys have to knock that off... there is enough room for you all to succeed.\n\nTwo Tribes 2018 Season\n\nWhen you are on top of your game, change your game - 2018 will be a fantastic year for fast growing Australian businesses. With this outlook, we felt that a change in the format and style of Two Tribes was warranted to keep up with a maturing founder and investor scene in Australia. The plan for the coming year is 3 fold:\n\nFewer episodes - We have managed an output of episodes for the last 18 months of ~1 a fortnight (minus holiday time). The coming year we plan to do no more than 12 episodes to improve the quality of information but also to fit in with busy schedules!\n\nA new style - We really enjoy the interview style of podcast however we often get comments from listeners asking for more of our opinions in the episodes. In 2018 we are planning for Two Tribes to be more investigative in nature (think a rougher version of This American Life) with founder and investor stories coming to life through investigation of topics or issues in the Australian ecosystem.\n\nNew topics - Holding true to the theme of real stories of founders and investors we aim to address the topics that are shaping Australia's start up ecosystem. Topics include: 'What it takes to build a co-working space in Australia', 'Series A...or not: the journey to find investors, securing it or not at all', 'Going global - the companies that have stayed and the ones that have left our shores' or 'Shutting down - founders that made the call to stop'.\n\nIf you would like to be involved or have an idea for an episode in 2018 please send us an email.\n\nThat's a wrap on 2017 - thank you to the founders and investors we had on the podcast this year, Brad at Tank Stream Labs, and those who have listened and continue to listen to Two Tribes."
