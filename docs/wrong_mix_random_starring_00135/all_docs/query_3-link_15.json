        "text": "–5– January–March 1889\n\nEdison began the new year vacationing at his wife’s family home in Akron, Ohio. Before leaving Orange in December, he gave his blessing to a long-discussed consolidation of the Edison electric light and power businesses, and he returned to New Jersey just days after the resulting Edison General Electric Company was incorporated in the state. Its leadership and structure were still inchoate, and Edison weighed in with proposals intended to sustain the “enormous and rapid development” and “phenomenal” earnings enjoyed by his electrical manufacturing shops.1 Before the new firm had its legs, financier Henry Villard was already guiding it toward a selective alliance with the rival Thomson-Houston Electric Company. As much as Edison trusted Villard (whom he endorsed as the company’s presumptive president), he was unwilling to follow this lead. Expanding markets and huge appetites for capital had driven Thomson-Houston and the Westinghouse Electric Company, the other major electrical concern, into strategic cooperation, but Edison characteristically took a go-it-alone approach. “We have all that is required,” he assured Villard, and his arguments against “intangling alliances with any competitor” prevailed for the time being.2 Unsurprisingly, he turned down an invitation (arranged through Edward Dean Adams, a financial pillar of the Edison light businesses) to visit George Westinghouse, Jr., in Pittsburgh. The offer came without conditions, but Edison scorned Westinghouse as an arriviste in the electrical world who was “flying a kite that will land him in the mud sooner or later.”3 A short while later, Edison signed a testimonial letter (Doc. 3330) in support of Harold Brown, a provocative activist against alternating-current electrical systems and the Westinghouse firm in particular.\n\nEdison devoted much of his time to the phonograph. He continued experimenting with significant changes to the minutely sensitive parts in the recording and reproducing mechanisms.4 Some of these alterations were to accommodate “new material blanks”—that is, the latest form of his still-evolving wax cylinders. One idea he continued to explore was applying a veneer of recording wax to an inexpensive base material.5\n\nEdison had a number of projects going simultaneously, as usual. The kinetoscope—an instrument “for recording & reproducing moving objects photographically”—was more a concept than a device, but he opened an experimental account in February and toyed with ideas about it, particularly for adapting the curved surface of a cylinder to a series of tiny flat photographs.6 And he never went long without trying to improve his incandescent lamp. Still facing the limitations and inconsistencies inherent in natural fibers, he now returned to the idea of attaining greater uniformity by extruding filaments from plasticized carbon materials.7 In what had become a clear pattern by this time, relatively little of this work found its way into Edison’s notebooks, and much of what did took the form of draft caveats or patent applications. In particular, his drafts of caveats, for which the Patent Office’s rules were looser than for patents, were beginning to carry much of the record-keeping burden for which he had previously used notebook entries, and individual drafts sometimes rambled over a number of topics.8\n\nEdison had a special space at the laboratory (“room 12”) where he did his own experiments.9 The wider lab complex, however, remained the working home for about ninety skilled and unskilled men with a payroll hovering around $1,300 per week. It was closely allied with Edison’s manufacturing enterprises, with direct expenses for most projects reimbursed by the electrical factories (soon to be Edison General Electric), Henry Villard, North American Phonograph, or various other companies.10 According to payroll records, much of the work at the lab in this period was on the phonograph and its cousin, the toy phonograph (or talking doll); ore milling; an electrical transformer; lamp testing; electrical insulation (in conjunction with the Machine Works); the Edison Phonograph Works (possibly designing and making tools); and unspecified “bug killing”experiments.11 Four machinists, a pattern maker, a carpenter, and a wireman put some of their time toward a “birthday present” in the February week that their employer turned forty-two. They reportedly gave him a “complete new phonograph made of gold, silver and steel” and restored his old clock, now regulated by a telegraph signal from Washington, D.C. The entire staff pitched in for the purchase of new furniture, including oak tables and chairs carved with Edison’s initials, that was put in while he was away.12 Citing the staff’s workload, Edison put off a request from George Gouraud, his foreign phonograph agent and an entrepreneurial showman, to record the sound of Niagara Falls to accompany the London exhibition of a large painted diorama of the famous falls.13 He did send Walter Miller to Washington, D.C., long enough to record greetings by Japanese, Korean, and Chinese diplomats in a bid by his Asian agent to secure market concessions in their home countries.14\n\nThe laboratory force worked on one other significant project through the winter: Edison’s “Paris Exhibit.” Patrick Kenny, a trusted experimenter, and several machinists spent virtually all of their time preparing a comprehensive exhibit of Edison’s inventions for the Exposition Universelle, set to open in Paris in May.15 Edison financed much of the affair himself, intending to showcase his new phonograph.16 Having already hired William Hammer to construct and manage the display, Edison engaged in awkward correspondence with George Gouraud about their respective responsibilities for presenting the machine to the expected crowds. Trust between Edison and Gouraud seems to have frayed on both sides as the former issued directives and the latter reluctantly agreed to share in the expenses. Hammer sailed for France in early March with Edison’s clear authority over the phonograph.17\n\nIn February, an all-male cohort of scientists and engineers (and their female guests) came to the laboratory for a meeting of the American Institute of Mining Engineers. Distinguished engineer John Birkinbine presented a paper on “The Concentration of Iron-Ore” written with Edison’s help.18 Nothing was said publicly at the time, but Edison had recently begun buying land around Bechtelsville, Pennsylvania, on behalf of the New Jersey and Pennsylvania Concentrating Works, in anticipation of building a large plant to recover commercially viable quantities of iron from marginal ore.19 Two or three days after the engineers’ meeting, he narrowly avoided catastrophic injury in the laboratory when a vessel of acid exploded and burned his face and eyes.20 Edison decided over the winter to furlough his university-trained chemists.21\n\nThe dramatic rupture of Edison’s friendly relations with Ezra Gilliland and John Tomlinson in September continued to echo in the winter. Press reports of the breach began appearing on 17 January and multiplied rapidly.22 At the same time, Edison negotiated a retainer for Sherburne Eaton, a former president of the Edison Electric Light Company, to act as his personal attorney in Tomlinson’s stead; Eaton also took Tomlinson’s place as general counsel of the Edison Electric Light Company.23 And there was the practical matter of keeping up the shared Florida property where he and Gilliland had built separate homes while looking forward to joint winter vacations. Edison sent terse instructions to the caretaker that charges for work there on behalf of himself and Gilliland “should be kept separate, the dividing line of the property being the dividing line for charging to either of us the work which is done in that connection.”24\n\nIn the second week of March, days after William Hammer left for the Paris Exposition, Edison’s oldest child, Marion Estelle, also sailed to France. Marion was a few weeks past her sixteenth birthday, and she traveled with Jennie Miller to join Grace and Mary Emily Miller, all sisters of her stepmother, Mina Edison.25 It is not clear what thought was given to her return; she remained abroad for three years.26\n\n1.

These “bug killing” experiments began in early September and continued intermittently through the end of 1888, apparently overlapping with Arthur Kennelly’s germicidal research in the fall (see Doc. 3265).

Marion did not return to Bradford Academy after Christmas, and Mina had been planning since at least mid-February to send her on an extended European trip. Two of Mina’s younger sisters, Grace and Mary Emily Miller, were already in Paris, and Mina asked them to arrange a tutor in two (apparently quite different) lists of subjects. She left the travel plans to her father, who in the end had Mina’s older sister accompany Marion to France.

Hammer\n\nALS (letterpress copy), DSI-AC, WJH, Ser. 1, Box 4 (TAED X098C008). aObscured overwritten text.\n\n1. It is not clear where Hammer typically worked in this period. Although he was sometimes in New York, he was gathering materials at the laboratory for Edison’s Paris exhibit and likely conducted related correspondence from there. Hammer to Edison Machine Works, 31 Dec. 1888, WJH (TAED X098C005); cf. Alfred Tate to S. K. Dingle, 31 Dec. 1888, Lbk. 27:593 (TAED LB027593) and Francis Upton to Samuel Insull, 2 Jan. 1889, DF (TAED D8939AAA).\n\n2. In letters similar to this one, Hammer solicited telegraphic instruments from Western Union, electric lighting equipment from Bergmann & Co. and, from the Edison Machine Works, a municipal dynamo, disc dynamo, three-wire central station plant, and a one-third size ore-milling machine. Regarding the requisitions from Bergmann & Co., he stated that the lighting department would include “Indicating & regulating apparatus” and a “model meter department” and noted that the three-wire central station plant would provide power for the Edison exhibits. The London journal Iron Age described plans for the exhibit in March. Hammer to Thomas Eckert, 21 Dec. 1888; Hammer to Edward Johnson, 29 Dec. 1888; Hammer to Samuel Insull, 28 Dec. 1888; Hammer to Edison Machine Works, both 31 Dec. 1888; all WJH (TAED X098C001, X098C003, X098C002, X098C004, X098C005); “Edison Exhibit at Paris,” Iron Age 43 (14 Mar. 1889): 393.\n\n3. Edison later decided not to send the transformer and multipolar dynamo. Tate to Edison Lamp Co., 24 May 1889, Lbk. 30:46 (TAED LB030046).\n\n4. After a fruitless search of the laboratory for this experimental machine, it was located at the Edison Machine Works and sent from Schenectady on 7 January. Hammer to Insull, 5 Jan. 1889, WJH (TAED X098C009); John Kruesi to TAE, 11 Jan. 1889, DF (TAED D8946AAC).\n\n5. That is, the pyromagnetic generator and motor.\n\n6. At the end of December, Hammer had asked the Machine Works to send him plans and blueprints of “cross sections of wire tubing all styles of connection boxes, catch boxes &c.” He noted that the exhibition would include “large collections of plans, blueprints” and statistics “illustrating the growth of the electric lighting business.” He proposed to exhibit them in different ways, such as “frames, portfolios, scrap books.” Hammer to Edison Machine Works, 31 Dec. 1888, WJH (TAED X098C005).\n\n7. Edison’s first commercial central station plant, at 255–57 Pearl St. in lower Manhattan, had been providing power to New York’s financial district since 4 September 1882. An annex station opened at 60 Liberty St. in 1886 to help meet rising demand. Doc. 2243 (headnote); New York Edison Co. 1913, 109.\n\n8. Two central stations in New York City (at 47–51 W. 26th and 117–19 W. 39th Sts.) opened in late 1888 to serve the area from 17th to 59th Sts. between 8th and (probably) 3rd Aves. on the Edison three-wire system. “The New Uptown Edison Stations, New York,” Electrical World 13 (19 Jan. 1889): 29–32; Martin 1922, 171; New York Edison Co. 1913, 108–11, 131, 165, 241.\n\n9. The plant of the Edison Electric Light Co. of Philadelphia was nearing completion. It began operating on 5 March 1889. William Marks to Edison Electric Light Co. of Philadelphia, 15 Apr. 1889, DF (TAED D8937AAH).\n\n10. The editors have not identified a source for this estimate of attendance; possibly Edison based it on the 1878 Exposition in Paris, which attracted between 13 and 16 million visitors. The 1889 exposition ultimately drew more than 30 million. Findling and Pelle 1990, 376–77; Swift 2008, 100.\n\n[Orange,] Jan. 11, 89.\n\nMy Dear Sir:—\n\nI wrote you a few days ago, stating that I was arranging to make an exhibition of the phonograph at the coming Paris Exposition.1 I had in mind at the time certain details in connection with this exhibit which I was not quite prepared to explain, but which I will refer to more particularly in this present letter. My object in advising you briefly of my intention, was to forestall any preparations which you might have been entering upon in the same direction, as you of course understand, that considering the extent to which my inventions are to be exhibited, it would not be proper to have the phonograph placed anywhere except within my own circle. I have not made any accurate calculation as to the expense which will be incurred in connection with the phonograph exhibit, but I assume that you will share this expense equally with myself. I, of course, refer only to the phonograph exhibit, the benefits to be derived from which will accrue in your interest as well as my own. Yours very truly,\n\nThos A Edison T[ate]\n\n<I have expected to hear from you on this subject in the belief that you have some suggestions to make and which I will be very glad to receive. Tate>2a\n\nTL (letterpress copy), NjWOE, Lbk. 27:685 (TAED LB027685). Signed for Edison by Alfred Tate. aMarginalia written by Alfred Tate.\n\n1. Edison’s letter is Doc. 3298.\n\n2. Gouraud’s 5 January reply to Doc. 3298 would not yet have reached New York, a fact he surmised in his answer to this letter on 25 January. In accepting Edison’s wish that he share the cost, Gouraud made a claim for having some hand in the phonograph’s exhibition (cf. Doc. 3326):\n\nI have no objection to sharing expenses directly attendant upon the exhibition of the Phonograph, and presume you will consider it to your advantage as I do to my own, that in that case, I should have control of that expenditure. I presume that whatever is done with the Phonograph on that occasion will be under my direction, as it will not answer to have anyone acting in Paris in connection with the phonograph independently of myself; this view I presume is only anticipating your own.

This document is one of the few technical items by Edison, other than caveats, pertaining to his early work on motion pictures. The dearth of contemporaneous technical notes and drawings makes it hard to follow his thinking without the interpretive aid of retrospective accounts, especially testimony given in court cases years later. Paul Spehr, a biographer of William K. L. Dickson (Edison’s principal assistant on photography), has mined those subsequent records to create a useful narrative of the laboratory’s motion picture work in late 1888 and 1889. Spehr 2008, 82–99, 119–78.\n\nThe ideas embodied in this document appear in several related drawings on laboratory letterhead on the same day. Taken together, they appear to mark the start of a significant shift in Edison’s approach to motion picture devices. (Edison v. American Mutoscope & Keith, Complainants Exhibits, pp. 410–15, Lit. [TAED QM001410–QM001415]). On 3 February, Edison drafted a lengthy omnibus caveat that included a detailed drawing and brief description of a kinetoscope “for recording & reproducing moving objects photographically.” (Edison did not sign the completed caveat 114 until 22 March.) The editors have not selected the draft because of its length and diffuse character, but one of its drawings (figure 19), reproduced here as an illustration, represents a break from the earlier smooth-faced cylinder covered with ei ther a photosensitive emulsion or a sheet of celluloid coated with the emulsion (cf. Doc. 3271). The cylinder at the drawing’s center (14) was “not round but paralell with its length are a number of flat places about 1/32 wide This gives a flat face for the photographic record from the microscope & the picture is not thrown out of focus as it would be if the cylindrical surface was round, especially on very small Cylinders which it is necessary to use on a Commercial apparatus.” A detail (26) showed contours of the flat surfaces. The cylinder, on a closely threaded shaft (12), was driven through a shaft at the other end (20, evidently with splines) by a motor (19 at lower right), pulley (18), and belt (16). An escapement wheel (25) on the cylinder shaft engaged a lever (23), moved by magnets (24) between limiting stops (21 and 22). A similar escapement mechanism (at top left) controlled the movement of a shaft (6) carrying “the revolving shutter 7,” though the source of its rotation was not named. The shutter would pass intermittently before the objective (8) of the camera (27 at lower left). The two sets of magnets acted in unison, controlled by “break & contact wheels” (not shown) on a single shaft turned by a governed electric motor. Edison summarized the action of the complete mechanism this way: “The cylinder stands still. The shutter advances & opens the shutter while the cylinder is still the photographic effect takes place on the flat of the cylinder; the shutter closes then the cylinder advances another notch but such advance only takes place while the shutter closes off the light These actions take place continuously at the rate of 15 or 20 times per second.” Caveat Case 114 draft, 3 Feb. 1889, PS (TAED PT031AAE1); see also Caveat 114 esp. fig. 54, Edison’s Caveats, Pat.

Edison referred to “Inventors Beware,” an unsigned critique of Patent Office policies and practices (especially interference proceedings) that filled nearly five columns of the seven-column New York World on 12 January (pp. 1–2). The article’s tone was conveyed by four subtitles, one of which called the Patent Office “A DANGEROUS INSTITUTION” while another promised an exposé of “Frauds That May Be Practiced by Its Employees and Remain Undiscovered.” A fragmentary clipping from the article was added to an Edison scrapbook. Cat. 1085:81, Scraps. (TAED SM085081a).\n\n3. The article cited five interference cases in which Edison’s application was not the first filed as examples of endemic procedural unfairness. It made no allegations of malfeasance in these cases but, as they were printed immediately above the subheading “OPPORTUNITIES FOR FRAUD,” Edison may have misread it that way.\n\n4. The editors have not found any communication to or from Richard Dyer or his law partner on this subject.\n\nNEW JERSEY AND PENNSYLVANIA CONCENTRATING WORKS Doc. 3309\n\nDoc. 3309 outlines a business strategy that took the Edison Ore Milling Company—and Edison himself—a step closer to actual iron ore-mining operations. Instead of leasing ore separator equipment to any operator willing to pay the royalties, the firm planned to partner exclusively with mining companies working under Edison’s aegis. This arrangement would create a series of controlled experiments and allow Edison to demonstrate the commercial and technical success of his separator system. It also appeared to be a tacit recognition of the fact that running the machinery required special training and experience, and that any other engineer, no matter how skilled otherwise would, as Edison put it, be “working in the dark and encountering all the obstacles which I was obliged to overcome during the Early stages of my Experiments.”1 Edison accordingly organized two ore-milling companies of his own. The first was the Edison Iron Concentrating Company, which set up a milling operation in Humboldt, Michigan, in late 1888.2 The second was the New Jersey and Pennsylvania Concentrating Works (NJPCW), organized at the end of 1888 with Edison as president, Samuel Insull as vice president, and Henry Livor as general manager.3\n\nEven as Edison was working out the “bugs” that cropped up at the Michigan plant, he enlisted financier Robert Cutting, Jr., to help him organize the NJPCW and build a new ore-concentrating plant at the Gilbert Mine in Bechtelsville, Pennsylvania, some ten miles from Reading.4 The Gilbert Mine had, in addition to what seemed an abundance of lean ore, the advantage of close proximity to Bechtelsville Furnace, where the concentrated ore could be tested.5 The NJPCW began erecting an experimental plant at Bechtelsville in early 1889 and brought it into operation by the end of May.6\n\nEdison had kept his distance from the Humboldt operation, preferring to work out technical difficulties at the Orange laboratory. But he visited the Bechtelsville plant soon after it began working, and the experience may have been decisive, leading him to plunge further into ore milling, both personally and financially.7 Having seen for himself the working of the experimental plant, Edison began telling mining companies that “we do not sell our concentrating machinery as we have gone into the business of concentrating ourselves.”8 This policy appears to have marked a shift from the year before when he expected to profit more by licensing the patents to outside companies, manufacturing and selling the equipment to them, and collecting a royalty per ton of processed ore.9\n\nEdison soon decided to expand operations at Bechtelsville.10 He visited his Pennsylvania operation a second time in mid-July in company with Insull and Arthur Kennelly.11 The three men, reportedly “attired like cowboys, wearing straw hats with immense brims,” made a magnetic survey of nearby properties using a magnetic dipping needle.12 Edison purchased several additional acres near the Gilbert mine and Livor began ordering more equipment, including rollers for crushing and another separator. The company also began constructing buildings at the site to house the new equipment.13 As Insull reported to Tate, “The plant at Bechtellsville is a remarkable success. There is no doubt that we are going to make a lot of money. Livor and Edison are practically intoxicated by the business.”14 Edison now resolved to “waste no time” leasing his equipment to mine owners and instead decided to buy up mines himself and put up his own mills.15 Soon after his return to Orange, he filed a new patent application for separating iron from lean ores (Doc. 3386).\n\nEdison also prepared a prospectus (Doc. 3389) for a potential investor, noting that by July’s end the mill was housed in a building 300 feet long and 40 feet high. He claimed that 200 tons of ore could be crushed and processed daily and that from raw material containing just 14 percent iron, the Bechtelsville plant was delivering to the furnace ore containing 65 percent iron, the percentage needed by the Bessemer steel process. Once the company was able to tap into ore containing 30 percent iron, he expected to make a profit of 150 percent on investment. His intention was to buy up “practically all the magnetic ore deposits in the Center of the coal & iron district of Penna” and process the ore himself.16 Among the first mines he purchased were those at Ogdensburg, New Jersey, a remote spot about thirty-five miles northwest of Orange.17 Before the end of the year, Edison had convinced NJPCW’s stockholders to increase the company’s capital to $150,000 and build a large ore-milling and concentrating plant at Ogdensburg.18\n\nIn the meantime, despite the initial optimism, the Bechtelsville operation ran into trouble. Soon after Edison’s July visit, engineer Philip Daugherty fell into the rolls and was crushed to death. Livor, who said he could not understand how such an accident could happen, vowed to spare no expense to make the rolling house safe.19 But the chief problem was the insufficient supply of lean ore suitable for magnetic separation. By January 1890, Edison, having thought “the Bechtelsville Mill business all over,” ordered Livor to concentrate his attention on Ogdensburg. A week later, he ordered the mill shut down until the Gilbert mine proved capable of providing a sufficient quantity of suitable ore. It never reopened, and its equipment was moved to Ogdensburg.20\n\n1. See Doc. 3335.\n\n2. See Doc. 3228 (headnote).\n\n3. Such a strategy, entailing an operating company paying royalties to a patent holding company and buying its equipment from Edison’s shops, was similar to the one Edison used for the electrical central station business. In both cases, Edison encouraged the formation of operating companies whose success might spur the formation of others, though in the case of NJPCW, he invested his own money up front. See Doc. 3309 n. 2 regarding incorporation of the NJPCW.\n\n4. Edison contracted to purchase land at the Gilbert Mine from George Greiss on 5 February 1889.

Legal [TAED HX89039]; see also Doc. 3228). The NJPCW incorporation papers also mention that the company had the right not only “to purchase or acquire patents, inventions or rights” pertinent to its mining and concentrating operations but also to lease such rights (Certificate of Organization, NJPCW minute book, 27 Dec. 1888, pp. 1–2, CR [TAED CJ074001]).\n\n10.

His work in this connection has resulted in what would appear to be complete success. The Officers of the Company have made preliminary arrangements with a Syndicate to operate the patents of the Company for dealing with Iron Ores in Pennsylvania and New Jersey2 The first plant is now being constructed3 and will doubtless be in operation within the next few months. Should this plant prove successful the same Syndicate will proceed to erect plants throughout New Jersey and Pennsylvania\n\nExactly what royalty the Ore Milling Company will receive from the Syndicate has not yet been decided upon It has been thought better to postpone the final decision on this matter until such time as the exact economy of the Concentrating Process can be fully established.4 The arrangements under which the Pennsylvania and New Jersey business will be operated are very favorable to your Company inasmuch as should the enterprize prove a failure no obligation whatever will be incurred by The Ore Milling Company, but in the event of the business proving a success, your Company will derive benefits in the shape of royalties.\n\nA somewhat similar arrangement has been made with relation to the States of Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. A plant is now being erected in the Lake Superior District5 by a Company recently formed in Chicago to work the patents in the States above mentioned\n\nIt has been thought desirable to await the results of these two initial plants, one in the Eastern States and the other in the Western States, before vigorously pushing the business in the remaining territory. Parties who in the first case are willing to risk their money on a comparative uncertainty, naturally expect better terms than they would be able to obtain were the business a firmly established one, and the profits accruing from the Edison System beyond question should the two plants referred to prove a success, there is very little doubta but that a large and lucrative business can be developed in all Magnet Iron-bearing Districts.\n\nSince the re-organization Mr. Edison has devoted a great deal of time to experimental work on his system for working Rebellious Gold Ores.6 The success which has so far attended his efforts would seem to show that eventually he will produce a system which will successfully deal with these Ores, and consequently bring a large revenue to your Company. So far, Mr. Edison has not been able to devote the whole of his time to this particular line of experimental work, but he promises in the near future to do so.\n\nWith the immediate development of the Iron Concentrating Process, and the possibility of Mr. Edison’s experiments to work the Gold Process proving a success, we think that your Company has reason to take a very favorable view of its future prospects doing a successful business.\n\nSamuel Insull Vice Prest\n\nD (copy), NjWOE, CR (TAED CG001AAN4).

The New Jersey and Pennsylvania Concentrating Works (NJPCW) was organized in New Jersey on 27 December 1888, with a capital stock of $30,000, “to mine, separate, smelt or otherwise treat, concentrate and deal in iron and other metallic ores” in those two states. Stockholders included Edison and financier Robert L. Cutting, Jr., (100 shares each); Insull, Harry Livor, and William Perry (30 shares each); and Alfred Tate and Joseph Hutchinson (5 shares each). At a stockholders meeting in late January, Edison was elected president, Insull vice president, Hutchinson secretary, and Livor general manager. Like the Edison Ore Milling Co., the NJPCW had its headquarters in New York at 19 Dey St. Day-to-day operations at the company’s Bechtelsville, Pa., plant were left to P. F. Gildea, superintendent, Philip Dougherty, engineer, and Frederick Willer, who took care of the magnets, one of which was said to have been nine feet long.

The editors have not found the original of this document, which Edison presumably signed and returned to Eaton. Ten days later, several brief press notices announced that Edison had appointed Richard Dyer as his legal advisor in place of Tomlinson. Those reports were in error; Eaton clearly held that responsibility as Dyer (and his partner) remained in charge of Edison’s patents.

Within two months, Sigmund Bergmann was using his own letterhead as a manufacturer of gas and electrical fixtures at 527–31 W. 34th St. in New York. He also had a lease on 79 Fifth Ave., where he intended to open a showroom. Bergmann was in the process of forming a stock company with longtime associate Philip Klein, Jr. The trade press reported in late March that the new Bergmann Electric and Gas Fixture Co. was entering “the general business of manufacturing electric light and gas fixtures.” It presumably was to be independent of the Edison enterprises; as Bergmann pointed out in Doc. 3283, he had been doing profitable business apart from them for years. Uriah Painter and Edward Johnson had some financial stake, though they seemed to be in the dark about Bergmann’s plans, and Painter, in particular, opposed the idea of incorporating a stock company. As Bergmann pressed ahead, Painter pointed out in April that Johnson was “very sensitive about his status with the Edison Light Co.” with respect to the new company, and that “Edison is extremely bitter in reference to it, and Insull will spend a great deal of money to injure it.” Bergmann to Painter, 16 Mar. 1889; Bergmann to Johnson, 28 Mar. 1889; Painter to Bergmann, 7 Apr. 1889; Bergmann to Painter, 17 May 1889; all UHP (TAED X154A8BD, X154A8BE, X154A8BN, X154A8CD); “A New Electric Fixture Company,” Electrical Review 14 (23 Mar. 1889): 1.\n\nUnder the terms of Bergmann & Co.’s absorption into Edison General Electric, its stockholders were “to receive for every $100 share $120, of which one-third will be cash, one-fourth will be stock on which the dividends will be deferred and the balance will be stock immediately entitled to 8 per cent dividends.” Bergmann & Co. stockholders’ circular and agreement, n.d.

The application prepared from this draft was one of nine that Edison signed on Friday, the first of February. Because patent attorneys Richard Dyer and Henry Seely substantially rewrote the draft, in addition to the time they invested in the other applications, the editors conjecture that Edison gave it to them several days earlier, perhaps at the start of the work week.\n\n2. This is the case number assigned to the patent application created from Edison’s draft; it was cross-referenced by Edison’s attorneys on a related draft application (Doc. 3316). This application was filed on 16 February; it issued, with two drawings and ten claims, in July 1889. U.S. Pat. 406,576.\n\n3. In the issued patent, Edison stated his preference for a metallic soap, which had become his standard recording material by this time. Also cf. Doc. 3253 n. 26.\n\n4. Reference to “the usual means” was omitted from the completed application. The “usual means” of refrigeration at this time was ice, either produced naturally and conserved throughout the year (as by the Hudson River, which supplied the New York City region) or, increasingly, by mechanical methods. Artificial refrigeration by the compression and condensation of gases (typically flammable ammonia) required machinery that was bulky, expensive, unreliable, and often custom-built, and was feasible only for large-scale commercial uses. Pat. App. 406,576; Rees 2013, 27–47; also cf. Doc. 3265.\n\n5. Asphalts and bitumens, pitch-like hydrocarbons formed by the same geologic processes as petroleum, were used in the ancient world; in recent times, different types of asphalt, in particular, were often still distinguished by their place of origin. Since the seventeenth or eighteenth centuries, they were created artificially as byproducts of petroleum distillation (Abraham 1920, chap. 1; OED, s.vv. “asphalt” and “bitumen”). Edison had considerable experience with asphalt and similar materials in a variety of uses, notably experimental attempts to manufacture or treat lamp filaments with them (see, e.g., Docs. 3012, 3039, 3041, 3091, 3117); as insulation on conducting wires (e.g., Doc. 3085); and for phonograph cylinders (e.g., Docs. 3060, 3101).\n\n6. Edison likely referred to his Case 743 (Doc. 3119, recently divided and re-filed as Case 751), in which he briefly described a cylindrical mold, sawed longitudinally into several sections, for making duplicate recordings. See also Doc. 3101.\n\n7. Edison included a very similar idea in an 1887 draft caveat (Doc. 3101; see esp. n. 6).\n\n8. Edison may have meant to write “enable” after originally beginning to write “so enough.”\n\n9. The editors have not identified the source of Edison’s cost calculations and other information about the wax-covered wound paper cylinders favored by American Graphophone, but it could have been Charles Stolpe, former assistant to Charles Tainter. See Doc. 3252 n. 2; for a further brief description of the cylinder, see “Reproduction of Articulate Speech and Other Sounds,” Sci. Am. 49 (14 July 1888): 15–16.\n\n10. As Edison makes clear in the postscript below, a thin coating could not be turned off on a lathe multiple times as required for recording repeatedly on the cylinder.\n\n[Orange,] Jan. 30, 1889.\n\nDear Sir:—\n\nIn view of the recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, I desire to modify Rule No. 3 of my letter of instructions to you under date Dec. 15th, 1888,2 which will now read as follows:—\n\n“In countries which grant patents for various terms up to fifteen years, you may without awaiting the issue of the corresponding U.S. patents make application for and take out fifteen year patents only, paying the fees for the short terms and making proper provision for the payment of subsequent fees necessary to maintain such patents for the full term for which they are originally granted. Following is a list of such countries:\n\nPortugal\n\nTurkey\n\nAustria\n\nItaly\n\nArgentine Republic.\n\nIn your letter to me under date 5th instant, you state that the 15 years fees which you paid the Austrian Government in connection with Cases 86 and 87 will be refunded for 14 years without any prejudice to the Austrian patents,3 and as the decision which I have previously referred to prevents such refundment from prejudicing my United States patents, I have no objection to your accepting the same. Yours Truly\n\nThos A Edison\n\n<Note: The Supreme Court decision herein referred to is that disposing of the Bate Refrigerator Case— A. O T[ate].>a\n\nTLS (letterpress copy), NjWOE, Lbk. 28:21 (TAED LB028021). aPostscript handwritten by Alfred Tate.\n\n1. This letter was written at the suggestion of Dyer & Seely, to whom Alfred Tate sent it for review and transmittal to Gouraud. Dyer & Seely to Tate, 25 Jan. 1889, DF (TAED D8954AAJ); Tate to Dyer & Seely, 22 and 30 Jan. 1889, Lbk. 27:857, 28:23 (TAED LB027857, LB028023).\n\n2. Edison’s prior letter is Doc. 3297. The modification set forth below was in response to the U.S. Supreme Court’s 21 January ruling in Bate Refrigerating Co. v. Hammond (129 U.S. 151 [1889]) concerning ambiguities in section 4,887 of the U.S. Revised Statutes. The court held that the life of a U.S. patent was not necessarily abbreviated by the short term of a foreign patent, provided that the latter was properly renewed or extended for a longer term. It declined, however, to decide whether the date of a U.S. specification’s application or its issue should be the governing fact in such cases. Because of its potentially far-reaching effects, the Bate case had been closely watched by the principal electrical companies, including Edison’s associates (“Supreme Court Opinions,” NYT, 22 Jan. 1889, 3; “Patenting the Lightning,” 24 Jan. 1889, NYT, 8; “The Supreme Court Decision,” Electrical Review 13 [2 Feb. 1889]: 10; “The Edison People Happy,” New York Tribune, 23 Jan. 1889, 2; see Doc. 3120 n. 3).\n\n3. In his letter of 5 January (one of four he sent to Edison that day), Gouraud sought approval to accept the refund from the Austrian government.

The telegram was addressed to the Adams home in New York City.\n\n2. A financier with an engineering background, Edward Dean Adams (1846–1931) represented the New York banking firm of Winslow, Lanier & Co. He was a principal investor in the Edison Electric Light Co. and the Edison Electric Illuminating Co. Doc. 2690 n. 2; John McClement to Alfred Tate, 29 Oct. 1888, DF (TAED D8856ADN).\n\n3. Adams wrote the same day that he had been invited by George Westinghouse, “an old personal acquaintance,” to visit Pittsburgh “and see his electrical plant and what they are doing”; at his request, Westinghouse extended the invitation to Edison. Adams wished him to go “for the purpose of adding to our knowledge of the strength and weakness of our competitors, as well as aiding our judgments in dealing with the problems that are now coming up, by reason of the extensive consolidations which Mr. Westinghouse has consummated.” Adams promised to arrange the trip with little or no public fanfare. Adams to TAE, 2 Feb. 1889, Box 78, Folder 552, Villard.\n\n4. Edison disdained George Westinghouse’s business methods generally (cf. Doc. 3008) but probably was referring specifically (as Adams did) to several recent acquisitions by the Westinghouse Electric Co.: purchase of the Consolidated Electric Light Co., for its incandescent lamp manufacturing capacity; purchase of the Waterhouse Electric and Manufacturing Co., for its arc lighting system; and lease of the United States Electric Lighting Co., for important patents on arc and incandescent lamps and dynamos.

Feb. 2nd, 1889.a\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have lately received Yokohama letters dated Jan. 7th, advising receipt of my cable of the 1st ulto.1 requesting that the Edison Phonograph be advertised in the Japanese papers, with instruments and expert to arrive out early in Feb.2 Enclosed I hand you copy of notice put in the foreign and native Japanese papers.3 Frazar & Co., send me enclosed copy of “Japan Gazette,” dated Yokohama Jan. 5th, containing interesting article on the Edison Phonograph for your perusal.4 They write: “We have, in anticipation of any special concessions which we understand the Graphaphone agent is trying to secure from the Government, advised the U.S. Minister5 of the superiority of the Phonograph and at the same time made inquiry if, under the new patent regulations,6 protection can be secured by foreigners. On the 2nd inst. we wired you7 recommending seeing Mr. Mutsu, Jap. Minister at Washington,8 and securing from him letters of introduction, i.e., phonograms, to prominent Jap. officials, as similar letters were given to the agent of the Graphaphone. Mr. Austin Herr (not Herv)9 agent for the Graphaphone here has placed samples of his instruments in the U.S. Legation Tokio and in the Consulate, Yokohama and has now left for Kobe, Osaka &c.. Among foreigners who have heard the Graphaphone, the impression is that that instrument cannot prove of great commercial value in Japan. We trust, however, that when the Edison Phonograph arrives, it will be found to be a much superior instrument to the Graphaphone.10 (As previously mentioned, the Graphaphone on exhibition in Japan is worked by foot only and this will be objectionable as compared to the running of the Edison Phonograph with an elec. battery). Frazar & Co., Yoko., also add: “In the ‘Scientific American’ of July 14th last the Tainter Graphophone is illustrated and described.11 This is the instrument here which has been brought out by Mr. Herr. The samples we have seen at the Consulate and Legation do not bear the name of maker or patentee, but the box containing the record cylinders has the following: Record Cylinders Am. Graphophone; Washington D.C. patent May 4th, ’86 No. 341,288, patent Nov. 29th, ’87 No. 374,133.” On Jan 2nd, ’89 my firm addressed the U.S. Minister at Tokio, Hon. R. B. Hubbard as follows: “We beg to inform you that we have received a telegram advising us that the perfected phonograph, the invention of Mr. Thomas A. Edison, will be sent out here next month in charge of an expert. This is stated to be far superior to an instrument termed the ‘graphophone.’\n\nIn this connection we shall esteem it a favor if you will kindly advise us if under the new patent regulations recently promulgated and published in the ‘Japan Daily Mail’ of this date, foreigners can now obtain protection in Japan for their inventions.”\n\nThe above information you no doubt will be glad to receive and place on file for future reference.\n\nThis morning I received your valued favor of the 1st inst. handed me through Mr. Tate, enclosing copy of your letter of Jan. 31st to the Edison-Berlin Co.12 On behalf of my Japan friends, I have to thank you for the prompt and firm manner in which you have taken up this question of interference by the Germans with our reserved rights in Japan, Korea and China. I fear that another incident has occurred, showing the probable interference in the same direction. For many months past Mr Lindsley13 has been in correspondence with the Engineer of the Korean Govt. in Seoul, having charge of all the elec. lighting matters, and as late as Dec. 16th and 17th last this engineer, Mr. Bjerre,14 hands my firm a memo. of just what elec. fixtures are required for furnishing the Korean Home Office with suitable elec. lights, among them being orders for over 6,000 lamps, 1,200 assorted fixtures, 2,000 shades, 300 lt. dynamos, engines, boilers, wire, electroliers, &c. &c., the most important and difficult question then under negotiation being to arrange payment for the plant. My firm require to give some credit and take some risk in this matter, which we are willing to do. Now I learn from Mr. Upton that by mail received from Mr. Dyer in Antwerp, he has received letters from Japan, evidently inspired by such Japs. as the Niwas, inquiring for prices for this identical plant for Korea. I have personally explained this matter in detail to Mr. Tate this noon, and shown him copies of the correspondence which passed between my firm and the Korean engineer. I await anxiously the result of your request for explanation from the German Co. in regard to their interference with our Japan territory. As soon as received, if of value, I will at once cable to Japan, as it is of vital importance to us.\n\nPHONOGRAPH. I have suggested to Mr. Tate that you take the young gentleman proposed from Schenectady15 into the phono. works not later than Feb. 15th, that he may have a good schooling and be ready to leave N.Y by March 10th, to take our C.P.R str.16 from Vancouver March 22nd, due Yoko. about April 7th. With the expert I would be very glad to have you furnish me with at least 20/25 phonos. These should be sent from here not later than March 1st, to make sure of their accompanying the expert. Will you please try to have this carried out?\n\nIn connection with the Korean plant, I last evening wired to Yoko. as follows: “Telephone Co. Yokohama, cables Dyer, Antwerp about Korean Plant.” This will enable Mr. Lindsley to ascertain at once from headquarters where this interference comes from and who are the parties interested. Possibly, the German Co. may have representatives in Japan who are canvassing secretlyb for such Edison Incandescent lighting business, but I am not advised of such being the case.\n\nPlease keep me informed of the progress of the outturn of the phonographs from your factory, and the proposed movement of our expert for Japan. I remain, Yours very truly,\n\nEdward Frazar\n\nTLS, NjWOE, DF (TAED D8905AAU). Letterhead of Everett Frazar. a“NEW YORK.” preprinted. bInterlined above.\n\n1.

As early as April 1888, Edison advised Frazar that introducing the phonograph in Japan and China would require a “trained expert” who could “teach local agents…the use of the machine.” He also expected that “The blanks and material used in running the phonograph should be made in China and Japan and not sent from this country.” Frazar at first resisted the expense of an expert’s salary and instead wanted Edison to prepare phonograph instructions for his company’s electrician, W. H. Brenner. Edison, however, was adamant and at one point warned that the phonograph rights to Japan and China could be transferred to his English agent if Frazar found it too costly to introduce the machines on those terms (Frazar to TAE, 18 Apr. [with TAE marginalia] and 30 Apr. [with TAE marginalia], TAE to Frazar, 20 Apr. and 2 May 1888; all DF (TAED D8805ACF, D8849AAK, D8818AJC, D8818AJS]). The matter of a new hire was revisited in December, after the graphophone’s debut in Japan, and Samuel Insull reviewed candidates. After Robert Lozier wavered in accepting the position, Arthur Churchill was selected and approved for the post in March 1889 with Edison’s assurance that he would also be “a first class all-around man” for Frazar’s electrical business in China, Japan, and Korea (Alfred Tate to Insull, 15 Jan. 1889; Tate to Lozier, 21 and 28 Jan. 1889; Tate to Frazar, 16 Feb. and 8 Mar. 1889; Lbk. 27:736, 843, 943; 28:253, 578 [TAED LB027736, LB027843, LB027943, LB028253, LB028578]; Frazar to TAE, 31 Dec. 1888; Insull to Tate, 18 Jan. 1889; Lozier to Tate, 24 Jan. 1889; Frazar to Tate, 12 Feb. and 11 Mar. 1889; all DF [TAED D8849ADF, D8905AAJ, D8914AAC2, D8905ABG, D8960AAQ]; “Misc.

Richard Bennett Hubbard, Jr., (1832–1901) was the U.S. diplomatic envoy to Japan during the Grover Cleveland administration. A former governor of Texas, he was born in Georgia and studied law at the University of Virginia and Harvard University before moving to Texas; he was a Confederate colonel during the Civil War (“Death List of A Day,” NYT, 13 July 1901: 7; J. Duncan 1978, 29–34). Frazar considered him “not in a position legally to take any diplomatic action tending to suppress the piracy of Japanese manufacturers,” but Hubbard occasionally exercised some influence on behalf of the American electric light business. Hubbard also had a personal interest in sound recording and in December 1888 had received from Austin Herr a message recorded on a graphophone by fellow diplomat Durham White Stevens (Frazar to Thomas Bayard, 17 Oct. 1888; Frazar and Co. [Yokohama] to Frazar, 27 Dec. 1888; Frazar to Alfred Tate, 17 Jan. 1889; all DF [TAED D8839ACF, D8849ADD, D8960AAC]).\n\n6. The Japanese government had recently promulgated new patent regulations which, as Frazar noted below, were published in the Daily Mail. The editors have not found the published version but, according to an explanation in the Japan Weekly Mail of 5 January 1889, the new rules did not protect foreigners. When Frazar inquired whether he might face competition from Japanese-made imitations of the phonograph, Tate reassured him that it “will be practically impossible for the Japanese to make phonographs by any method within their reach as cheaply as your firm will be able to supply them from our factory.” “New Patent Regulations,” Japan Weekly Mail 11 (5 Jan. 1889): 7; “Patent Regulations,” ibid., 9–10; Frazar to TAE, 16 Jan. 1889, DF (TAED D8905AAF); Tate to Frazar, 24 Jan. 1889, Lbk. 27:897 (TAED LB027897).\n\n7.

Count Mutsu Munemitsu (1844–1897) was the Japanese Minister in Washington, D.C., from 1888 to 1890.

The son of a successful miller in Washington D.C., Austin Herr (1851?–1900) inherited his wealth in 1886 and became a founding director of American Graphophone the next year. He obtained the Volta graphophone concession for China and Japan by the end of 1888 and arrived in Japan on 19 December prepared to promote the machine among influential members of the government. His demonstrations included messages recorded by Japanese and American diplomats in Washington. He was identified as “Austin Herv” in Frazar’s 17 January excerpt (to Alfred Tate) of a letter from Frazar & Co. in Yokohama.

Am. 59 (14 July 1888): 1, 23.\n\n12. On 1 February, Tate gave Frazar a copy of Edison’s 31 January letter to Allgemeine Elektricitäts Gesellschaft (AEG). Edison’s letter had been sent to Berlin enclosing a copy of his as-yet unanswered November complaint (Doc. 3278) about the firm’s willingness to serve East Asian markets. Edison blamed AEG for “our losing a very large contract in one of the principal cities of China, after my agents had spent a great deal of time and money to secure it” (Tate to Frazar, 1 Feb. 1889; TAE to AEG, 31 Jan. 1889; Lbk. 28:63, 61 [TAED LB028063, LB028061]). The matter had come to the fore after Frazar forwarded to Edison a report from his Osaka branch ascribing their loss of a central station contract to the Niwas relaying price information from Berlin and to the related influence of Kunihiko Iwadare. Frazar suggested that a review of the German contracts might clarify AEG’s legal obligations to Edison, but Tate replied that the German lighting interests had “passed through a number of different stages, and it would be a difficult, if not fruitless task, to attempt to sift their various contracts…to ascertain their present legal status with respect of their obligations to Mr. Edison.” Frazar pressed the matter in a visit to Orange on 8 February, when he apparently urged Edison to draw Henry Villard into the matter (Frazar to TAE, 16 Jan. 1889; Frazar to Tate, 12 Feb. 1889; both DF [TAED D8905AAF, D8905ABG]; Tate to Frazar, 1 Feb. 1889, Lbk. 28:63 [TAED LB028063]).\n\nThe German company responded to both Edison letters on 19 February. According to the translation in Edison’s files, it denied having sold lamps directly to China or Japan and doubted “if the complaints of your agents really refer to our product, which, as we know to our regret, is frequently imitated.” More significantly, it declared itself free of the Edison orbit. Having closed out relations with the umbrella European firm, the Compagnie Continentale Edison,\n\nwe do not stand any longer in the position, as you describe it, of one of the Edison Companies, confined to a certain territory.\n\nWe also do not work exclusively under the Edison patents, acquired in common with the firm of Siemens & Halske, but we own many more…. The market for our product is the entire world, and we cannot restrict ourselves in the sale of the same any more than do Siemens and Halske and the other manufacturers of incandescent lamps, with all of whom we are in the same position. [AEG to TAE, 19 Feb. 1889, DF (TAED D8941AAH)]\n\nAEG’s advertised readiness to construct central stations anywhere in the world caught the eye of Francis Upton, who also saw copies of some of Edison’s correspondence on the subject (Tate to Upton, 1 Feb. 1889, Lbk. 28:65 [TAED LB028065]; Upton to Tate, 16 Feb. and 8 Mar. 1889, both DF [TAED D8939AAK, D8939AAU]). Frazar, however, was evidently unmoved by AEG’s declarations and urged Edison to take up the matter personally when he visited Berlin in the summer (Frazar to Tate, 23 May and 26 June 1889, both DF [TAED D8905ADK, D8941AAV]).\n\n13. John Lindsley (1845–1909), the resident partner of Frazar & Co. in Yokohoma, was born in Dorchester, Mass., and was the younger brother of Frazar’s wife. Lindsley became associated with the Frazar businesses after graduating from Harvard College in 1867 and became a partner in 1872 while based in Shanghai. He also established a short-lived branch in Hong Kong before going to Yokohama. Poole 1950, 1–3; Harvard College 1892, 80; “In Memoriam.

When Bjerre left Korea in October 1889 under suspicion of embezzlement, Lindley proposed W. H. Benner to take his place.

The trainee (see note 2) was Arthur Churchill (b. 1867). Born in Islington, near London, to Eliza and Robert Churchill, he had been working as an electrician at the Edison Machine Works. He became Frazar’s new phonograph expert and electrical associate in East Asia at a salary of $1,200 per year plus expenses, arriving in Japan in mid-April 1889.

The material I use for this purpose is the stearates of the metals and their cofefficienta of Expansion is very small compared to waxes parafine and like material. Hence I am enabled to use Hard Rubber or Ebonite, sometimesa called Vulcanized Rubber a commercial product of a very variable character Consisting of Rubber ora allied gums in combination with Sulphur— The coeff the expansion of this material is very great so that it nearly approaches The Expansion of the stearates of the metals, hence the two can be used together. The veneer of Recording material may be put on by dipping the Ebonite shell in the molten liquid or it can be placed in a mould & poured around it in a molten state. The surface of the Ebonite should not be polished but made rough to cause adherence.\n\nAfterward the surface is turned true & is ready for the phonograph The great value of the backing shell of Ebonite is that the it has great strength with abnormal Expansion it being unique in this respect, standing almostb alone in this respect Hence Musical or other phonographic records or duplicate made on material with Ebonite backing may be handled & shipped without danger of breaking— As Ebonite varies so much in composition the Expansion of the stearate of a metal may be increased or diminished by using a little Oleate of a metal, for instance if Monob Stearate of Soda is used the Expansion of may be increased by adding to it a small quantity of Oleate of Alumina the proportions must be determined Experimentally to suit the particulara Ebonite used—\n\nClaim a phonogram blank of Hard Rubber Sometimesa called Ebonite, Vulcanized Rubber faced with phonographic Recording material\n\n2nd.

Patent attorney Henry Seely marked this draft as received on 5 February.\n\n2. This is the case number assigned by Edison’s patent attorneys to the application created from this draft. Someone (perhaps Henry Seely) wrote at the top of the page: “See Case 829,” which is Doc. 3312 and to which the text of the finished application referred specifically. Edison did not sign Case 830 until 22 March. It was filed at the Patent Office three days later and issued in November, with two drawings and four claims, as U.S. Patent 414,759.\n\n[Orange,] Feb. 5, 1889.\n\nMy Dear Mr. Frazar:—\n\nI have your note of 4th instant,1 and will be glad to see Mr. Tyson2 to-morrow afternoon.\n\nI think you are already aware that the Graphophone people are making strenuous efforts in China and Japan to obtain concessions, giving them the exclusive right to introduce their machines. They, of course, will try to exclude the phonograph altogether. Would it not be well to let the Japanese and Chinese officials know that the Edison Perfected Phonograph is to be sent to those countries shortly? To-morrow night we are sending a young man3 to Washington, with a phonograph, for the purpose of giving an exhibition before the Commissioners of the Patent Office,4 to overcome some objections which have been raised in that Dep’t. of the Government in connection with patents.5 I suppose it would be impossible for you to arrange in so short a time to utilize this man for the purpose of obtaining records and giving an exhibition before the Japanese and Chinese officials?6 I am quite sure that if they once heard the phonograph, no special grants would be made on behalf of the Graphophone.7 Yours truly,\n\nA.

Frazar wrote on behalf of Alexander Tison, recently “appointed by the Jap. Minister in Washington to fill the law chair in the Tokyo University.” Tison was also to assist with Frazar’s business interests in Japan, and Frazar wished Tate to receive him at the laboratory on 6 February to see the phonograph, electric light, and phonograph factory. Frazar to Tate, 4 Feb. 1889, DF (TAED D8960AAG).\n\n2. A native of Missouri, Alexander Tison (1857–1938) was an 1886 graduate of Harvard Law School. He practiced in Tokyo and concurrently served as professor of English and American law at the Imperial University from 1889 to 1894. Obituary, NYT, 17 July 1938, 26; Leonard 1907, s.v. “Tison, Alexander.”\n\n3. Walter Miller went to Washington on the evening of 6 February after first visiting Frazar in New York.

The matter may have involved Edison’s Case 783, the text of which is Doc. 3219. Having been twice rejected, the application was the subject of an appellate hearing on the afternoon of 7 February, shortly after Walter Miller’s arrival in Washington. Case 783 file wrapper, PS (TAED PT032ABB).\n\n6. Frazar had been anxious to obtain recordings by Chinese, Japanese, and Korean diplomats to send to their home countries, as the graphophone’s promoters were doing (Frazar to Tate, 17 and 24 Jan. 1889; Frazar to TAE, 2 Feb. 1889; all DF [TAED D8960AAC, D8960AAF, D8905AAU]). Frazar provided Miller with letters of introduction to the Washington delegations of those countries and also mailed his own letters to the same officials, requesting in each case a brief recorded interview with Miller (Frazar to the Chinese minister, both 6 Feb. 1889; Frazar to Munemitsu Mutsu, both 6 Feb. 1889; Frazar to Horace Allen, both 6 Feb. 1889; all DF [TAED D8960AAH, D8960AAI, D8960AAJ, D8960AAK, D8960AAL, D8960AAM]).\n\n7. Walter Miller was not initially received by the Chinese or Japanese legations, but he and Frazar recorded the Japanese minister and associ ates in March. The phonograms were presented to Japanese officials in Tokyo.

Having released Drs. Johannes Braun and L. Cornice ten months earlier, Edison would also dismiss Dr. Henry Wurtz in March (Tate to Braun, 19 Apr. 1888, DF [TAED D8815ABB]; see Doc. 3329). Wilmowsky remained employed at the laboratory until mid-May, after which Edison gave him a general letter of recommendation (Time Sheets, 16 May 1889, WOL; TAE to Wilmowsky, 31 May 1889, Lbk. 30:183 [TAED LB030183]). Increasingly, Edison seems to have been relying on Reginald Fessenden, an aspiring electrical engineer redirected into chemical experiments (cf.

Edison wrote this date on the first page of his draft but then marked subsequent pages as 10 February 1888. Adding to the confusion, he used this notebook from both the front and back (re-numbering the pages) over a considerable period of time, perhaps copying material into it from other books or loose sheets. In the absence of a finished or filed caveat, however, the editors believe that 1889 is the correct year because of the overlap of subjects in this draft (specifically, phonograph cylinder veneers and squirted lamp filaments) with those in other documents positively dated from early 1889. Edison seems to have repeated the mistaken date in a related draft patent application (Doc. 3320) on the same day. Cf. Docs. 3312, 3316, and 3334; PN-88-05-01, N-87-12-10, N-89-03-01, N-88-03-15.2 [Mar. 1889 patent application draft and 31 Mar. 1889 caveat draft]; all Lab. (TAED NB008AAY, NP033C, NB067AAA, NA023188, NA023207).\n\n2. The editors have not identified this experimental compound.\n\n3. That is, the reproducer and recorder, respectively.\n\n4. The idea embodied in this drawing appears to have made it into a caveat that Edison executed on 22 March and filed three days later. There he described a similar drawing (figure 16) as a “steel belt with tightner” to rotate one cylinder against another at a set pressure in a duplicating process. Case 114, Edison’s Caveats, MdCpNA (TAED W100ABX); cf. Doc. 3152.\n\n5. Figure label is “Transformer.” This drawing and the following one (with a “continuous reducer”) appear to represent a rotary converter for changing voltage.\n\n6. Figure labels are “Low Tension,” “High Tension,” and “Continuous Reducer.”\n\n7. These filaments may be related to “Edison Speci[a]l” carbons (treated and untreated) placed in experimental lamps on 20 February (N-87-12-10, Lab. [TAED NB008AAY]). In addition to the contemporaneous records of squirted filaments mentioned in note 1, Edison jotted a number of prospective materials and experiments into a pocket notebook on 23 February (PN-88-05-01, Lab. [TAED NP033C]).\n\n8. Figure label in first drawing below is “Trans”; in second drawing, “Trans” and “magnet.”\n\n9. Edison made several undated and unlabeled drawings on the following pages that may be related to the electric railroad.\n\nOrange Feby 10 18891\n\nDyer & Seely—\n\nThe object of this invention is to produce an economical simple a practical system of distributing Electricity to street Railway Cars without too great a loss in leakage and without the use of Conduits with travelling Contacts which are Expensive or without the use of Overhead Conductors & Trol leys which are now allowable in large cities2 The invention consists in distributing from Cutting the tracks up in sections of say 250 feet Each [-]a and Causing the Entrance of a Car & motor on the section to Automatically cause a magnet to Close a circuit increasing the Current from a weak oneb tob its full strength and when the car passes out of that particular section the Automatic device disconnects the main circuit from such section leaving still a circuit for the magnet thus The loss due to leakage is reduced to a mere fraction when the section is not occupied by a car or cars3 A multiple arc circuit passes along the street paralell with the track & buried underneath the pavement at any convenient point between the track and the pavemen sidewalk A small box sunk to the level of the Street preferably at the intersection of two streets Contain the Automic circuit closer.

Document multiply dated; drawings made on separate sheet. aCanceled. bObscured overwritten text. cWritten in left margin of first page. dText accompanied by index pointer toward drawing.\n\n1. Edison wrote this date and place on a single sheet of drawings that was found pinned to his three pages of text, the first of which he dated 10 February 1888. Because of the overlap between this draft and Doc. 3319 (and the absence of congruence with extant documents from February 1888), the editors believe that he wrote 1888 in error, as he apparently also did in Doc. 3319.\n\n2. Edison presumably meant that such overhead electric wires were not allowed in large cities. His own earlier experimental electric railway at Menlo Park had used a locomotive (instead of motorized cars) with current distributed through the rails, and attenuation of electric power over its short distance had been a persistent problem. See TAEB 5–6 passim.\n\n3. Edison’s idea of dividing the track into sections is analogous to the block signal system used on American railroads, an automated variation of which he described in an 1887 patent application (Doc. 3072).\n\n4. Edison had several patents issued or pending for reducing voltage in substations with motor-generator machines, devices in which a motor in one circuit drives a generator in another circuit. Among them were an application filed in December 1887 that issued in May 1888 and another pending since December 1886 that did not issue until 1895 (U.S. Pats. 382,415 and 545,405). Edison also had a broad patent on the general concept that issued in September 1887 with two related specifications (U.S. Pats. 369,441; 369,442; and 369,443; see Doc. 3011).\n\n5. Electrical welding (or resistance welding) was a new process of fusing metal pieces together with the heat created by a heavy low-voltage current passed through them. It was developed in the mid-1880s by Elihu Thomson, who eventually took out dozens of patents, and was widely adopted in manufacturing. Compton 1939, 153–54; Thomson 1904.\n\n6. This design appears similar in principle, if not its particulars, to one Edison created in 1879 to limit sparking on electric railroad switches. See Doc. 1745 esp. n. 1.\n\n7. The editors have not found evidence that Edison’s attorneys completed or filed an application based on this draft.\n\n8. Edison sometimes instructed his attorneys to “claim the Earth” or other astronomical objects—that is, to make broad claims (cf. Docs. 3089 n. 1, 3103, 3152, and 3157). Intentionally or not, the phrase echoed an editorial retort to the 1885 decision of a British court to uphold an expansive interpretation of Edison’s patent claim on the carbon telephone transmitter. The case hinged on the definition of a diaphragm so broad that, the writer observed, it could include the Earth itself: “Did Edison, then, intend to patent the earth? Surely not” (Beauchamp 2015, 154; “Some Thoughts about the Telephone,” Teleg. J. and Elec. Rev. 17 [3 Oct. 1885]: 291).\n\n9. The editors have not found evidence of completed applications on either subject.\n\nOrange, N.J., Feby 14th 1889a\n\nDear Mr Villard:\n\nI enclose you herewith memorandum of suggestions as to the organization of the new Edison General Electric Company.\n\nThis memorandum is but an elaboration of the one I handed you in your office some time back.1 I have not dealt with details. These are matters which should not I think be decided on until your staff is organized. The people who will run the details of the business will I am sure be able to give valuable suggestions on such matters.b\n\nAll I claim for my memorandum is that it follows the same general policy on which the manufacturing business has been run for years. This policy has led to enormous and rapid development and has enabled us to reach an earning power which is phenomenal notwithstanding the severest possible competition. It is on this earning capacity that you are acquiring control of the business— Surely it is best to leave well done alone and not inaugurate changes the successb of which are to say the least uncertain. Yours very truly\n\nThomas A Edison\n\nALS, Villard, Box 78, Folder 552. Letterhead of Edison laboratory. a“Orange, N.J.,” and “188” preprinted. bRepeated at bottom on one page and top of the next.\n\n1. The editors have not identified what Edison gave to Villard, but it likely was some version of a long typed document without date titled “Memorandum of Thomas A. Edison as to the Organization of the Edison General Electric Company.” It listed the company’s offices, their responsibilities, and candidates to fill them. It was heavily amended in pencil, in part by Edison. The memorandum is similar in essence to a brief outline, handwritten by Edison and also undated, listing additional names and positions (TAE draft memoranda, both n.d. [Feb. 1889?]; both DF [TAED D8938ABD1, D8938ABY]). In the latter, Edison named Villard as president; John Dougherty or Calvin Goddard (former treasurer of both the Edison Electric Light and the Edison Electric Illuminating Co.) as secretary and treasurer (specifically rejecting John McClement and Frank Hastings); Samuel Insull as vice president and general manager of manufacturing; William Marks as chief engineer; John Vail as assistant engineer; John Henderson (a longtime Villard associate) as constructing engineer; Cornelius Field (chief engineer of the Edison United Manufacturing Co.) as engineer for isolated lighting and superintendent of construction; Charles Chinnock (vice president of the Edison United Manufacturing Co.) reporting to the vice president as head of the “Isolated Co.”; and William Preston Hix (former agent for the Edison Construction Dept.) as the “General Agt Outside franchises, etc.” Edison wished the heads of the manufacturing plants to remain as they were except for Sigmund Bergmann, who was leaving Bergmann & Co. to form another company, with Insull to fill his place on an interim basis. The long typed draft stated that the manufacturing “establishments are operated by men who for years have conducted their businesses as if they were private concerns, and are entirely unaccustomed to the necessary restrictions of corporation management,” a paragraph that was substantially enlarged by hand. The typed memorandum also identified a “Technical Advisory Board” consisting of Edison, Marks, Henderson, Insull, and Villard as chair. It would review for the president “all plans with relation to Central Stations” and all proposed changes in equipment and operating methods. Edison’s own handwritten outline included a “Technical Ex[ecutive] Com[mittee]” to be composed of the same members (absent Villard). This group “not only decides as to plans specifications etc of any new station or scheme, but also to report to the finance Com their ideas as to the Commercial aspect of the scheeme.” No such technical body appears in the organizational structure drafted by Sherburne E"
