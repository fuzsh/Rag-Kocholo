        "text": "The Antitrust and Unfair Competition Law Section of the California Lawyers Association is pleased to honor Bonny E. Sweeney of the United States Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division as the 2023 “Antitrust Lawyer of the Year.” The Section will honor Bonny on October 26, 2023 at our Antitrust Lawyer of the Year dinner following the Golden State Antitrust and Unfair Competition Law Institute.\n\nBorn in Wenatchee, Washington, Bonny grew up in a rural part of the Puget Sound area. She began her working career at age 11, picking berries and delivering newspapers on her beloved horse Snowball. Bonny’s love of horses led her to work at a local racetrack, grooming race horses and mucking out stalls. Bonny majored in Political Science at Whittier College and then, after studying Chinese at Beijing’s Language Institute, completed a Master’s Degree in Chinese Politics at Cornell University. She earned her J.D. from Case Western Reserve University but spent half of her law school tenure at Stanford and Harvard.\n\nBonny began her legal career as a litigation associate at Foley, Hoag, and Eliot in Boston and started specializing in antitrust law after moving to California. She worked for Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd and a predecessor law firm in San Diego for many years, first as an associate and then as a partner, before joining Hausfeld LLP in 2015, where she served as a managing partner and co-chair of the antitrust practice. While in private practice, Bonny served as lead or co-lead counsel for plaintiff classes in numerous antitrust cases, including In re Payment Card Antitrust Litigation, In re Packaged Seafood Antitrust Litigation, In re Parking Heaters Antitrust Litigation, In re Aftermarket Automotive Lighting Antitrust Litigation, and others. Bonny has tried several antitrust cases to a verdict, including the landmark Section 1 case brought by college coaches challenging the NCAA’s restricted earnings rule, Law/Hall/Schreiber v. NCAA.\n\nAfter a successful private practice, Bonny joined the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice as Senior Trial Counsel in 2022. At the Antitrust Division, Bonny has investigated several conduct matters and was a member of the trial team in United States v. American Airlines and JetBlue Airways, in which the United States and several states and commonwealths successfully challenged the airlines’ Northeast Alliance under Section 1 of the Sherman Act.\n\nA former Chair of the Antitrust and Unfair Competition Law Section, Bonny is also active in the ABA’s Antitrust Law Section and serves on the Advisory Boards of the Institute for Consumer Antitrust Studies at Loyola University and the American Antitrust Institute. Bonny frequently speaks and writes on diverse antitrust topics and previously served as Adjunct Professor at the University of San Diego School of Law.\n\nWhen not editing briefs or preparing for trial, Bonny enjoys hiking, mountaineering, golfing, and baking with her husband David, her sons Ben and Sam, and her dog Rusty.\n\nThe Antitrust and Unfair Competition Law Section of the California Lawyers Association is pleased to honor Elizabeth C. Pritzker of Pritzker Levine LLP as the 2022 “Antitrust Lawyer of the Year.” The Section will honor Elizabeth on November 10, 2022, at our Antitrust Lawyer of the Year dinner following our Golden State Antitrust and Unfair Competition Law Institute.\n\nElizabeth has been a leading plaintiffs-side antitrust attorney for over two decades, establishing herself in key roles in the In re DRAM Antitrust Litigation, the In re SRAM Antitrust Litigation, and the California Natural Gas Antitrust Cases.\n\nIn 2007, Judge Susan Illston appointed Elizabeth to serve as Liaison Counsel for the Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs in the In Re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust Litigation. Since then, she has held lead roles representing plaintiff classes in antitrust cases throughout the United States, including as Class Counsel in Il Fornaio (America) Corporation v. Lazzari Fuel Company, LLC et al., as Additional Class Counsel in the In Re NCAA Grant-in-Aid Antitrust Litigation, as Co-Lead Class Counsel in the In re: EpiPen (Epinephrine Injection, USP) Marketing, Sales Practices and Antitrust Litigation, as Co-Lead Class Counsel in Al’s Discount Plumbing, LLC et al., v. Viega, LLC, and as Liaison Counsel for the Consumer Class in the In re Google Play Store Antitrust Litigation.\n\nElizabeth also has served on other plaintiffs’ leadership teams, representing end-user plaintiffs in the In re Packaged Seafood Antitrust Litigation, indirect purchaser plaintiffs in Wood Mountain Fish LLC et al, v. Mowi ASA (aka Marine Harvest) and the In re Keurig Green Mountain Single-Serve Coffee Antitrust Litigation, and direct purchaser plaintiffs in In re Lithium Ion Rechargeable Batteries Antitrust Litigation and In re Transpacific Passenger Air Transportation Antitrust Litigation, among others.\n\nElizabeth is a past Chair of the Antitrust and UCL Section of the California Lawyers Association. Before serving as Chair, she was Editor-in-Chief of the Section’s Competition journal, presented at the Golden State Antitrust and Unfair Competition Law Institute, and authored articles for Competition and E-Briefs, News and Notes. Elizabeth currently serves as an Advisor to the Section, and remains active in the Section’s diversity and mentoring programs.\n\nIn addition to her work for the Section, Elizabeth has a long history of volunteer service to the legal community. She currently serves as a Lawyer Representative to the Ninth Circuit Conference Executive Committee, and previously served as a Lawyer Representative to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California; on the Board of Governors of Consumer Attorneys of California (CAOC); and as a board member of the Legal Aid Society of San Mateo County and Bay Area Lawyers for Individual Freedom (BALIF).\n\nIncreasing diversity in the legal profession has been one of Elizabeth’s interests and goals for many years. She was instrumental in creating the Section’s Inclusion & Diversity Fellowship and increasing the Section’s focus on ensuring diversity on the Executive Committee and during Section events. Elizabeth co-founded a majority women law firm, and served for many years as a board member of BALIF (Northern California’s LGBTQI+ Minority Bar Association), where she also headed up the judicial evaluations and mentoring committees. She has been an outspoken advocate for increasing diversity amongst the leadership in MDL and other large, complex cases pending in California and elsewhere.\n\nIn her spare time, Elizabeth and her wife, Patricia, split their time between Oakland and Palm Springs, enjoying the hiking, vibrant communities, and great food and wine that both locations have to offer.\n\nThe Antitrust and Unfair Competition Law Section of the California Lawyers Association is pleased to honor Daniel M. Wall of Latham & Watkins LLP as the 2021 “Antitrust Lawyer of the Year.” Dan is widely recognized as one of the leading antitrust lawyers in the United States. Throughout 40 years in the antitrust bar, Dan has litigated landmark antitrust matters, including before the United States Supreme Court, as well as guided clients through cutting-edge government investigations and merger reviews.\n\nDan’s entire career has focused on antitrust. After graduation from Santa Clara Law in 1980, he joined the DOJ Antitrust Division, where he was assigned to the trial team in U.S. v. AT&T, the historic monopolization action that led to the break-up of the Bell System. After a short stint in the Washington D.C. office of Skadden, Arps, he returned to San Francisco in 1984 as an associate and later partner at McCutchen, Doyle Brown & Enersen. In 1999 he moved to Latham & Watkins, where over the past 20 years he has led Latham’s growth into one of the top antitrust practices in the world.\n\nIn acknowledging his selection, Dan cited the development of Latham’s antitrust practice as his proudest accomplishment. “We are now 44 antitrust partners in ten offices around the world. We are at the top of every ranking, we have developed many of the top women antitrust lawyers in the world, and the group is wonderfully cohesive. I get an award like this because of the incredible team around me.”\n\nDan’s practice has focused heavily on the Silicon Valley and the evolving field of “high-tech antitrust law.” The many cases he has handled over the years include monopolization claims against iconic tech companies such as Apple, Intel, Microsoft, Electronic Arts, Broadcom and Eastman Kodak. Dan has also had an active class action defense practice, for example representing BMW in the ongoing “Circle of Five” cases, and Union Pacific Railroad in In Re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litigation I & II. Dan represented Apple before the Supreme Court in Apple v. Pepper, the Court’s first consideration of how the Illinois Brick indirect purchaser rule applies to an e-commerce platform.\n\nUnlike most antitrust litigators, Dan has also maintained an active mergers and acquisitions practice. He has represented clients in over 50 deals, including Live Nation’s merger with Ticketmaster, US Airways’ acquisition of American Airlines, Yahoo!’s sale of its search business to Microsoft, and Oracle’s acquisitions of PeopleSoft, Siebel Systems and Sun Microsystems. Dan has tried several merger challenges, most notably U.S. v. Oracle, the DOJ’s 2004 suit to block Oracle’s hostile takeover of PeopleSoft. The extremely high-profile case culminated in a month-long bench trial before Chief Judge Vaughn Walker, who rejected the DOJ’s case, principally concluding that DOJ’s market definition was flawed but also casting doubt on its competitive effects case. The decision was front page news and the National Law Journal named the matter its Top Defense Win of 2004.\n\nThroughout his career Dan has been a prolific writer and speaker on antitrust issues. He was a founding editor of, and frequent contributor to, Antitrust magazine. He has taught or lectured on antitrust at Santa Clara Law, the Stanford Business School, and for the last three years at BerkeleyLaw, where he teaches a practice-oriented seminar on Mergers, Monopolization and Market Power.\n\nThe Antitrust, UCL and Privacy Section of the California Lawyers Association is pleased to honor Penelope Preovolos of Morrison Foerster LLP as the 2019 “Antitrust Lawyer of the Year.” Penelope—known to her colleagues as Penny—is a leading antitrust and consumer protection lawyer, building a career in the defense bar at a time when few women could do so, let alone do so successfully. The award will be presented at a dinner and ceremony following the 2019 Golden State Institute beginning at 7:00 p.m.\n\nPenny has spent decades representing defendants (and occasionally plaintiffs) in dozens of the most challenging antitrust and unfair competition class actions in California and around the country, including for example In re Cosmetics Industry Antitrust Litigation, In re Tableware Antitrust Litigation, American Booksellers Association v. Barnes & Noble, In re Kosher Food Products Antitrust Litigation, In re Industrial Gas Antitrust Litigation, In re Structured Settlement Brokers Antitrust Litigation, In re Ticketmaster Antitrust Litigation, and many more. Penny served as co-chair of Morrison Foerster’s antitrust practice for 14 years.\n\nBut it is not just Penny’s courtroom prowess that is cause for honors: Penny is a pioneer for women in the antitrust bar. She started at Morrison Foerster in 1980, and built her practice and reputation throughout the 1980s and 1990s, when very few women became partners at big law firms in the antitrust field. Shattering through that glass ceiling, she has served as a role model for women in the antitrust bar for decades. While there is still far more work to be done in bringing diversity to the antitrust bar, it is time to celebrate the achievements we have made, with Penny leading by example.\n\nPenny’s leadership has not been limited to the courtroom and her firm. Penny has also served as one of the first women Chairs of this Section. She has also served on the Ninth Circuit Advisory Committee on Rules of Practice & Internal Operating Procedures.\n\nView their interview here.\n\nThe Executive Committee of the Antitrust, UCL & Privacy Section of the California Lawyers Association is thrilled to announce its selection of Bruce L. Simon of Pearson, Simon & Warshaw, LLP as the 2018 “Antitrust Lawyer of the Year.” For those who practice in the field of antitrust law, Bruce needs no introduction. He is one of the leading antitrust lawyers not just in California, but nationwide. He has been appointed lead counsel for plaintiffs in many antitrust cases with national and global impact, and has secured billions of dollars in settlements for businesses and consumers.\n\nOne of his particularly notable cases is In Re: Credit Default Swaps Antitrust Litigation, a case alleging a conspiracy among the world’s largest banks to maintain opacity of the credit default swaps market as a means of maintaining supra-competitive prices of bid/ask spreads. As Co-Lead Counsel, Bruce was instrumental in achieving a landmark settlement amounting to $1.86 billion. It is one of the largest civil antitrust settlements in history.\n\nHe was also one of the lead trial attorneys in the In Re: TFT-LCD Flat Panel Antitrust Litigation . In recent times, this is one of a handful of antitrust class actions that has gone to a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiffs. The case was tried right here in the N.D. Cal, and resulted in a verdict of $87 million before trebling. Total settlements in the case amounted to $473 million.\n\nBruce has just been appointed co-lead counsel in In Re: German Automotive Manufacturers Antitrust Litigation . He represents indirect purchasers who allege collusion among the largest German car companies to stifle innovation, restrict supply and fix prices for their vehicles.\n\nBruce’s achievements are not limited to the courtroom. He is the former Chair of this Section and remains an advisor and active contributor. After Co-Chairing an ABA task force to increase participation of the plaintiffs’ bar in the Antitrust Section, and leading the Global Private Litigation Committee, Bruce is now on the Council. Bruce is also a past Chair of the Board of Directors of his alma mater, U.C. Hastings College of the Law, and served on the Board for 12 years.\n\nUpon learning of his selection, Bruce stated, “I am so honored and humbled to be chosen. It is particularly poignant given the many friendships I have made during my service with the Section. “Antitrust Lawyer of the Year” is built on the high quality and talent of all who participate in the Section, and in particular, those who have received the award in the past. Being associated with all of you has taught me so much and has always kept me on my toes.”\n\nYou will hear much more about Bruce at the “Antitrust Lawyer of the Year” Dinner and Ceremony on November 8, 2018, at the Julia Morgan Ballroom in the Merchant Exchange Building in San Francisco. The Dinner and Ceremony will cap off what is shaping up to be a fantastic 28th Annual Golden State Institute, the preeminent competition law conference in the Western United States. Mark your calendars now!\n\nFinally, I would like to thank everyone who took the time to submit nominations for the Antitrust Lawyer of the Year. The Executive Committee received many excellent nominations which made the decision all the more difficult. The process was a wonderful reminder of the bounty of accomplished antitrust lawyers who practice in California. On a personal note, I am particularly delighted the Executive Committee chose to bestow this honor on a fellow member of the plaintiffs’ bar. I know Bruce not just an eminently qualified antitrust lawyer with a noteworthy career, but as one heck of a nice guy!\n\nPlease join us in congratulating Bruce L. Simon on his selection as the 2018 “Antitrust Lawyer of the Year!”\n\nJill M.

Warren joined the U.S. Justice Department’s Antitrust Division in Washington, D.C. in 1980. In 1984, he moved to the Division’s San Francisco Office, the only office in the country with major responsibility for criminal and civil antitrust enforcement. There he was Assistant Chief from 1997 to 2002 and Chief from 2002 to January 2014.\n\nMr. Warren led or supervised grand jury investigations of dozens of international cartels in widely varying industries, including many commodity chemicals and high-technology products such as DRAM, TFT-LCD panels, cathode ray tubes, optical disk drives, and lithium ion battery cells. He was lead attorney on the first seven criminal international cartel cases the Office filed, including the citric acid price-fixing case, U.S. v. Archer Daniels Midland Co. From 1997 to 2013, he oversaw more than 40 international cartel case filings in which the Office secured criminal fines totaling almost $3 billion. He also closely supervised domestic criminal investigations, including filings in 2011-13 of more than 50 cases and plea agreements charging bid rigging on real estate foreclosure auctions in Northern California. Mr. Warren served as lead attorney on U.S. v. All Star Industries and U.S. v. Guthrie, and supervised many other criminal trials, including the prosecutions in 2012-13 of U.S. v. AU Optronics Corp., U.S. v. Leung, and U.S. v. Bai, three trials of alleged conspirators in the TFT-LCD panel cartel.\n\nFor more than 15 years, Mr. Warren worked closely with Antitrust Division management in Washington, D.C. in developing the Division’s international cartel enforcement policies, including application of the Division’s Leniency Policy, policies for negotiating plea terms with corporations and executives, and practices for coordinating investigations with foreign enforcement authorities.\n\nFor the past 35 years, the San Francisco Office has had responsibility for reviewing premerger filings. Since early 2000, the Office has been responsible for the review of filings involving California-based firms in designated high-technology industries.
