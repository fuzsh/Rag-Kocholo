        "text": "While no one knows for sure where the first Thurston to reach our shores came from or who Daniel's parents might have been, there is alot of good general information on the Thurston surname.\n\nSome suggested origins of the Thurston Surname are scandinavian, saxon, or danish names. The first part Thur or Thurs is probably a reference to the Norse God of Thunder Thor. The second part could be either ton which means place, ston which is short for stone or Tan short for Thane which was an early title for a lord or kingsman. Either way the name derives from the Norse God and his followers, religious leaders or places of worship and is an old family name in England.\n\nThere have been Thurstons in England since atleast 800 AD. Some Thurston's through time include:\n\nThuston - a danish monk who lived in the Abbey of Croyland around 800 AD\n\nThurston - a thane who lived around 1014 AD and served king Canute.\n\nThurston - a knight in King Edwards's court in 1048.\n\nThurstan - the Abbott of Glastonbury who retired in 1084 to Caen.\n\nThurstan - elected 28th Archbishop of York, Secretary and Chaplain to King Henry II in 1100 AD.\n\nThurston of Thetford - a master minter under William the Conqueror and to who arms were issued which are still borne by his decendents to this day.\n\nOf the earliest Thurstons over here in the colonies, there are actually quite a few. There is a tradition that there were 3 thurston brothers who came over at the same time. One of these is probably Daniel Thurston who settled in Newbury and who willed all his possessions to his \"Kinsman\" Daniel Thurston. Among these other Thurstons in the colonies at the same time may be listed the other 2 brothers."
