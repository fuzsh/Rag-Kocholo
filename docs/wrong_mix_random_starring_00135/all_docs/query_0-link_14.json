He publishes daring work. I saw a review of a book by E. Temple Thurston, called The Realist. It was very daring and unpleasant, D.M. says, but showed unmistakeable talent. I have ordered it from England: it is a book of stories. Do you think I did right? I was going to read [Thomas] Hardy through but have changed over to [Octave] Mirabeau instead. (7 Dec. 1906; Selected Letters, p.138; and see Notes, infra.)\n\n[ top ]\n\nReferences\n\nStephen Brown, Ireland in Fiction [Pt. I] (Dublin: Maunsel 1919), cites non-Irish fiction titles, The City of Beautiful Nonsense; Sally Bishop [A Romance]; The Evolution of Katherine, The Realist and other Tales; Mirage; David and Jonathan (1918) and others, and lists Apple of Eden (Chapman & Hall 1905), 323pp. [argument against celibacy of clergy, a freshly ordained Maynooth priest meeting a woman he had loved in the confessional; bad reports of Irish life in Waterford]; Traffic: The Story of A Faithful Woman (Lodnon: Duckworth 1906; NY: Dillingham), 452pp. [Waterford and London, thesis novel regarding refusal of right to divorce leading to immoral practices; girl leaves unworthy Irish husband, must refuse offer from Protestant in London, and goes on streets]; The Garden of Resurrection ([Chapman & Hall [1911]), 307pp. [Bellairs in restaurant hears cad speak of marrying rich West Indian girl without love; warns her; she marries; comes to unhappiness; returns to him in West of Ireland, they marry]; Thirteen (Chapman & Hall 1912), 276pp. [thirteen short stories, three with bits of Irish life]; The Passionate Crime, a Tale of Faerie (Chapman & Hall 1915), 311pp. [Anthony Sorrel, poet, meets Catholic lady in Tipperary, who is later murdered; he is hanged; author theorises causes; finds people queer, and peasants fetishistic; misunderstands Catholic doctrine, acc. Brown]; Enchantment (Fisher Unwin 1917), 316pp. Charles Desmond, Waterford squire and tippler, vows daughter to convent and reneges but daughter has vocation; meets his death on the way to greet her apparent rescue; the Prince of a Waterford family destroys her vocation; disreputable; style throws glamour over all]. All sounds peculiar, obsessive and interesting.\n\nDesmond Clarke, Ireland in Fiction: A Guide to Irish Novels, Tales, Romances and Folklore [Pt. 2] (Cork: Royal Carbery 1985), adds detail: d. 1938, and titles The Miracle (1938) [west of Ireland; a girl conceives a child by the priest, and finds Joe Fennell, to whom betrothed, to marry her, while her peasant father, distracted by superstition, throws himself off a rock]; May Eve (1924) [south of Ireland; the dg. of an entomologist is saved from the convent by Irish piping and young love]; Jane Carroll (1927) [Madden, an Irish revolution, falls in love with an English social butterfly, they consummated the relationship, and he is shot by his companions presumably for his moral lapse].\n\nWikipedia: Ernest Temple Thurston (September 23 March 1879-9 March 1933) [...] Irish poet, playwright and author [...] born in Cork, Ireland and in 1901 he married the popular novelist[,] Katherine Cecil Madden (1875-1911). They had a daughter, Emily Temple Thurston, but the marriage did not last and they separated in 1907 and were formally divorced in 1910. [...] wrote forty books from which seventeen motion pictures were made [; ...] authored several theatrical plays, three of which were performed on Broadway and four were made into motion pictures. His best known work for the stage is The Wandering Jew, a play in four parts that was performed on Broadway in 1921 and made into a film in 1933.
