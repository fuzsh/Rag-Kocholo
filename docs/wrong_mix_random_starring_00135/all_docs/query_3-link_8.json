        "text": "Quakers began arriving in the Caribbean and North America when their religious society was still new and struggling to define its core beliefs and institutional structure. There were tensions within the Society of Friends stemming from the Quakers’ validation of individual inspiration and their communal commitment to the Christian message as contained in the Bible. A bitter debate over scriptural authority wracked Quaker meetings for the remainder of the seventeenth century, and the controversy included arguments over the Quakers’ relations with Native Americans, Africans, and others outside of Europe beyond the reach of formal Christian teaching. On both sides of the Atlantic opponents of Quaker discipline challenged long-standing assumptions about the source and content of the Christian message and the social hierarchies that resulted when some groups claimed privileged access to truth. The ensuing argument influenced the Quakers’ plans for their colonies in North America, and their debate over slavery.\n\n8 See Gerbner, Katharine, “The Ultimate Sin: Christianising Slaves in Barbados in the Seventeenth Century,” Slavery and Abolition 31, no. 1 (March 2010) 57–73 Google Scholar, 61; Larry Gragg, The Quaker Community on Barbados: Challenging the Culture of the Planter Class (Columbia: University of Missouri, 2009), 38, 48–9; Richard Dunn, Sugar and Slaves: The Rise of the Planter Class in the English West Indies, 1624–1713 (New York: Norton, 1972), 57, 105; William Noel Sainsbury, ed., Calendar of State Papers, America and West Indies, vol. 7, 1669–1674 (London, 1889), 1101.\n\n18 See John Donaghue, Fire Under the Ashes: An Atlantic History of the English Revolution (Chicago: University of Chicago, 2013), 261–266. While Donaghue has uncovered evidence of religiously informed antislavery earlier than most scholars have acknowledged, Rebecca Anne Goetz has focussed on the proslavery side of the debate. Goetz argues that in Virginia many of the most consequential, deleterious decisions affecting the status of Native Americans and African Americans took place within churches. Efforts to convert the enslaved to Christianity met fierce resistance in Virginia, leading to widespread assertions among whites that people of African and Native American descent were poor candidates for baptism. Most white Virginians assumed that the words “Christian” and “white” were synonyms, and they proceeded on that premise not only when drafting their statutes, but also in the daily governance of most of their religious communities. Thus the dominant strain of Christianity in Virginia justified the maintenance of a rigid racial hierarchy and as a consequence supported slavery.
