        "text": "Local writers and bookworms share what they're reading\n\nI recently spent a couple weeks planning for and several days attending the enormous BookExpo tradeshow in New York City. Throughout both phases, I continually discovered books that are prime candidates for reading and promoting in the Northwest, which is great — for three or four months down the line.\n\nA huge majority of the titles used to entice the industry at the spring extravaganza don’t actually hit the shelves for public consumption until the fall or even next year.\n\nSo instead of regional reads you can’t have, this month I drummed up a summer picnic of choices you can devour at will. I just needed a little help with the spread.\n\nLiz Crain is a food and culture writer with a day job as publicist for Portland’s Hawthorne Books. The fact that she makes time for any books unrelated to her own projects is beyond impressive. More than one book at a time? Ridiculous.\n\nHere's what she said about her suggestions: I’m usually reading a lot of books all at once. Right now I'm reading Rachel Lyon's debut novel, “Self-Portrait with Boy,’ and I'm really enjoying it. My friend Jess and I have a book club of two and we take turns hosting our meetings. Whoever hosts prepares food and drink from the current book. There isn't a lot of food and drink in this one — poor New York artists — but there's some and I'll be creative with it.\n\nI lean toward debut novels because they're so tricky to get published (the author usually has very little name recognition and no significant audience yet) and because they're, more often than not, pretty dang good. I favor debut in many mediums because it typically has such a surge of first-time passion and vitality. First love, first film, first album. You get the picture.\n\nI'm also reading chef Edward Lee's \"Buttermilk Graffiti: A Chef's Journey to Discover America's New Melting-Pot Cuisine.\" Wow, this book has blown me away. Man alive, this is a gift of a book in our current xenophobic political state. Each chapter includes a few recipes too, so I'll definitely be cooking from it this summer.\n\nI'm looking forward to reading \"Ursula K. Le Guin: Conversations on Writing\" by David Naimon next. Portland’s “Between the Covers” radio show/podcast is a gift of an author interview program and I particularly love David's interviews on the show.\n\nFinally, I'll shamelessly point to \"Grow Your Own: Understanding, Cultivating, and Enjoying Cannabis,\" which I co-authored, because I've been using it again now that I have my two backyard cannabis plants in the ground.\n\nI can't possibly retain everything I write, so I'll be paging through ‘Grow Your Own’ from cultivation on up through to harvesting, drying and curing in late summer/early fall. I'm so happy to be an Oregonian.\n\nColin Rea, director of the Fern Ridge Public Library District, loves to discover a classic before it hits the stacks and he was an early voice touting this next pick.\n\n\" 'The Overstory' by Richard Powers is incredible. I hate that Moby just gave it a ringing endorsement, but the writing is as beautiful and dense as the canopy of one of the trees that anchor the story. Trees will save us all,\" Rea said.\n\nRea is not alone. Tiffany Harlan, manager at Grass Roots Books in Corvallis, recently shared her positive response to \"Overstory\" with NWBookLovers.org. It’s what we book peddlers call a killer handsell.\n\nAndy Traisman and I met in the early 2000s when I was coordinating author visits on campus for the UO Bookstore and he was a regular attendee. We began our rapport talking books, shortly thereafter added the Chicago Cubs, and have alternated between the two topics since.\n\nTraisman just wrapped up a 30-year teaching career, the last 17 at Eugene’s Village School, during which he continually bolstered and rejuvenated an impressive classroom library. I’m proud to say that many dozens of publisher samples filtered through my office before making it to Mr. T’s shelves.\n\nWith his life lesson plans now wide open, I expected his stack might become ambitious. Here, he confirms.\n\n“What does a teacher do with a usual summer? An ambitious reading list, mixing in a little work with pleasure, usually about two to one — two pleasure reads for every one of academic value to keep an edge on what I might teach the following year.\n\n“What does a teacher who just retired read when facing his literary endless summer? Now that’s an entirely different question staring me down like a Brandon Morrow 99mph fastball.\"\n\n(He can’t help but work in the Cubs on my behalf.)\n\n“My night stand and end tables are spilling over with possibilities. Recent reads — a lot of fiction — I’d recommend that have primed me for summer are Willy Vlautin’s ‘Don’t Skip Out On Me,’ Chloe Benjamin’s ‘The Immortalists’ and the reissue of her first novel, ‘The Anatomy of Dreams.’ Also Thomas Pierce’s ‘The Afterlives’ and ‘Smoke City’ by Portlander Keith Rosson (reviewed in this column a few months back).\n\n“On the nonfiction front, currently I’m laughing myself awake when I’m trying to read myself to sleep with the new collection by David Sedaris, ‘Calypso.’ Sharp, insightful and hilarious. The heart of the book is family and relationships. Not to be missed.\n\n\"Next up, Tommy Orange’s ‘There There.’ I’m going to buy this book with class gift money I was given, and it’s going to skyrocket to the top of my pile.\n\n“Other books recently recommended by my literate friends include Annie Proulx’s ‘Barkskins,’ Dr. Edith Eger’s memoir, ‘The Choice,’ Dave Eggers’ ‘The Monk of Mokha,’ and ‘Nighthawks,’ a new collection of short stories from National Book Award winner (and my former University of Washington professor) Charles Johnson. Also, Ali Smith’s ‘Autumn’ (which, you can see, I probably won’t actually get to until autumn).”\n\nI hit up Elly Blue, marketing director for Portland-based Microcosm Publishing, while she was attending a conference in Detroit that left her a couple days in the hole in the email department but “inspired about the future of publishing and media.”\n\nWe connected for this recommendation just in time to make the list.\n\n“I’ve fallen behind on my non-work reading, so I’ll recommend one of ours. ‘Bicycle/Race: Transportation, Culture & Resistance’ by Dr Adonia E. Lugo officially hits shelves in October (although it’s available directly from us now at microcosmpublishing.com).\n\n“It’s been so thrilling, as an editor and bicycle activist, to get to work on this chronicle of the way our transportation systems can unite or divide us. It’s about race, class and personal growth — my favorite kind of book has a compelling narrative that helps you learn to see the everyday world in new ways, and this one really fits the bill.”\n\nEugene/Springfield’s Wayne Harrison, a recent Oregon Book Award Finalist for his story collection “Wrench,” is anxiously anticipating the August release of “Whiskey When We’re Dry” from Monroe resident John Larison.\n\nWriting instructors Larison and Harrison (imagine the office hours marketing possibilities!) shared a workspace at Oregon State University while Larison’s novel was in development, so Harrison read drafts of the story almost four years ago!\n\n“I truly think of John as not only a phenomenal and important writer, but as an exceptional human being — father of three, husband, expert fly-fisherman, elk bow hunter, and just the all around friendliest guy I know.”\n\nI think The Local Shelf is definitely going to look into this Larison guy and “Whiskey When We’re Dry.”\n\n“Never just one book,” says Thurston High Language Arts teacher and award-winning “Jackaby” series author William Ritter.\n\n“I am currently finishing ‘The Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue,’ which is absolutely brilliant. I am tremendously frustrated to be taking so long, as I kept needing to shelve it for my own deadlines and grading.\n\n“I am also re-reading ‘The Extraordinary Journeys of Clockwork Charlie’ series for my 7-year-old (it is superb middle grade fantasy in the same folklore wheelhouse as ‘Jackaby’).\n\n\"And I’m reading ‘Nevermoor: The Trials of Morrigan Crow’ with my 12-year-old (a fun fantasy adventure my wife highly recommended).\n\n“I’ll be enjoying a fun panel event with Fonda Lee later this summer, so I’m going to try to get my hands on (Lee's) ‘Jade City’ before then, too.”\n\nWith so many seemingly enjoying a page-gobbling free-for-all, I’ve decided to adopt an off-menu reading plan of my own and forego the usual local label — at least for the next couple books.\n\nI discovered my first John Straley mystery more than 20 years ago while cleaning out a box of donated freebies in a bookstore. How does one not snatch a book titled “The Curious Eat Themselves?” All these years and six books later, I’m still a sucker for Straley’s cockeyed brand of Alaska noir. “Baby’s First Felony” hits store shelves next month but made it to my nightstand already.\n\nAnd stretching out even further, I’m already Pink Floyd deep in “Twilight of the Gods: A Journey to the End of Classic Rock.” This one speaks to the 12-year-old me. I quote author Steven Hyden, arguing the value of a traditional album versus the modern playlist, via the band STYX:\n\n“I like having a finite number of songs. I find meaning in filler and dodgy experiments. I live for plumbing the soul of a single artist attempting to make a singular statement, even if the statement is ‘Dennis DeYoung is afraid that killer robots from the future will murder rock ‘n’ roll.’ ”\n\nAnd that’s where you’ll find me to start the summer. I’m just a man whose reading circumstances went beyond his control.\n\nBrian Juenemann is the executive director of the Pacific Northwest Booksellers Association and a contributing editor for NWBookLovers.org."
