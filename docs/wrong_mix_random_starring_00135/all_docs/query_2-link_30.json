He’s a Partner at WR Hambrecht Ventures and developed the MESE® computing system.\n\nFormerly, he used data science to guide growth investments at Intel and led a joint R&D effort at the Harvard Business School with Professor Clayton Christensen to develop predictive statistical models for early stage innovation. He also helped found a business in the high performance computing industry that was acquired.\n\n“Once again Saltmarch has knocked it out of the park with interesting speakers, engaging content and challenging ideas.
