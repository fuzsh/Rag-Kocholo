        "text": "Like the Phaeton of mythology, as a youth Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, seemed to have everything one could desire  wealth, status, friends, attractive physical appearance, athletic ability, and talent as a writer and musician. Yet in many ways his life resembles Phaetons dramatic fall, and Oxford himself appreciated the parallel, signing a sonnet in 1591 Phaeton to his friend Florio.\n\nThe documents reprinted below illustrate Oxfords fall from a position of wealth and 63/power to a nadir in 1590-1. In 1591 he remarried, and in 1592 his first surviving male heir was born. From that time on Oxford gradually attempted to rebuild his fortunes, a project which met with little success during the reign of Elizabeth, but which took a marked turn for the better when James I became King of England. However it was cut short by Oxfords death on 24 June 1604, only a year after King James accession.\n\nTHIS PAGE CONTAINS TRANSCRIPTS OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO EDWARD DE VERE, 17TH EARL OF OXFORD, AND WORKS HE MAY HAVE AUTHORED (INCLUDING THE LANGHAM LETTER); HIS FRONT MAN, THE ACTOR WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE OF STRATFORD UPON AVON; AND THE FIRST AND SECOND BLACKFRIARS THEATRES, ARRANGED IN ORDER BY DATE OF COMPOSITION\n\nFOR MYTHS CONCERNING OXFORD AND WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE OF STRATFORD UPON AVON, SCROLL TO THE FOOT OF THIS PAGE\n\nADDITIONAL TRANSCRIBED DOCUMENTS CAN BE FOUND ON OTHER PAGES OF THIS WEBSITE\n\nLast will and testament, dated 20 March 1488, of Sir Edmund Shaa, who as Lord Mayor of London is said to have offered the crown to Richard III\n\n4/282\n\nv\n\nBL MS Lansdowne 19/50, ff. 116-17\n\n4, f. 92\n\nList prepared by Michael Lok of moneys received from the venturers in the third Frobisher voyage, likely prepared soon after the ships' departure on 31 May 1578 as Oxford's name does not yet appear among the investors (see preceding document)\n\n(?)\n\n(?)\n\n6\n\n302\n\nCopy on the patent rolls of the grant dated 18 November 1587 by which the Queen reconveyed Castle Hedingham, including her reversionary interest, to Oxford and the heirs of his body by his first wife, Anne Cecil\n\n/35\n\nSignature and seal of Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford\n\nSTRATMYTHS, OXMYTHS, NEVILLE MYTHS AND ALAN NELSON MYTHS\n\nSTRATMYTHS\n\nOne of the most prevalent myths in Stratfordian orthodoxy is the claim that tracts concerned with the wreck of the Sea Venture in Bermuda in 1609 were direct sources of Shakespeares play, The Tempest. In his 2002 edition of The Tempest, David Lindley writes at p. 31: '[I]t is difficult to demonstrate that any of these individual texts were direct sources for the play'. In recent years David Kathman has attempted to give new life to the myth in his essay 'Dating The Tempest', in which he claims to have found 53 parallels between The Tempest and the Bermuda pamphlets. All 53 of the alleged parallels are refuted in the paper below.\n\nAnother prevalent myth is that Shakespeare used post-1603 sources. In fact, no source used by Shakespeare dates from after 1603.\n\nAnother myth, perpetuated in Shakespeare Bites Back by Dr Paul Edmondson and Sir Stanley Wells, is that:\n\nDuring his lifetime Shakespeare is frequently mentioned by name as a writer, sometimes in general terms, at other times explicitly. He is identified as the author of plays and poems by writers including Henry Willobie, William Covell, Richard Barnfield, John Weever, Thomas Freeman, Anthony Scoloker, and the anonymous author of the Parnassus plays (in which a character wants a portrait of him as a pin-up: âO, sweet Master Shakespeare, Iâll have his picture in my study at the courtâ, and also wishes to âworship sweet Master Shakespeare, and to honour him will lay his Venus and Adonis under my pillowâ).\n\nIn fact none of these authors evidences any personal knowledge of Shakespeare, merely acquaintance with his poems and plays (see Stratmyth file II at the foot of this page for details). The only contemporary mentions of Shakespeare in which he is identified specifically with William Shakespeare of Stratford upon Avon refer to him as a 'player' or as a theatre shareholder.\n\nAnother Stratfordian myth is the claim that Hand C and Hand D in the anonymous play of Sir Thomas More were penned by different individuals. Greg made the claim in 1911 without providing evidence for it. Greg's claim has recently been directly questioned by Hays, Ramsey and McMillin (see link below), and inferentially questioned by Watt, who included a 22-line passage from Hand C in his stylometric study of Hand D.\n\nYet another Stratfordian myth is the claim that Hand D is authorial, whereas the errors made by Hand D as he copied the text clearly indicate that Hand D is that of a scribe copying from another document (see link below). Similar errors by Hand C establish that Hand C was also copying from another document, and that Hand C's additions are not authorial.\n\nAnother of the most prevalent myths in Stratfordian orthodoxy is the claim, most recently stated in unequivocal terms on the , that the Hand D addition in the anonymous play of Sir Thomas More was personally penned byWilliam Shakespeare of Stratford upon Avon. This myth was decisively refuted by Samuel A. Tannenbaum in Problems in Shakspere's Penmanship, (New York: The Century Co., 1927), pp. 179-211. That Tannenbaum was correct is amply demonstrated in his table on p. 209 showing the striking differences between the letter formations in Hand D and the letter formations in the six signatures of William Shakespeare of Stratford upon Avon. The myth was also refuted by R.A. Huber, a forensic expert, who wrote in Stratford Papers on Shakespeare by John Cook, Robertson Davies, R. A. Huber & C. J. Sisson, (W. J. Gage Limited, 1961), p. 66, that 'In the light of the differences noted, the evidence is not sufficiently strong to justify a positive identification of the poet'. The oxfraud website entirely ignores Tannenbaum's refutation and Huber's expert opinion.\n\nFor a detailed refutation of this Stratfordian myth, see Price, Diana, 'Hand D and Shakespeare's Unorthodox Literary Paper Trail', Journal of Early Modern Studies, n. 4 (2015), pp. 329-352:\n\nThe also perpetuates MacDonald Jackson's erroneous claim that the spelling 'scilens' is unique to the Hand D addition to the play of Sir Thomas More and to the name of the character Justice Scilens in the 1600 quarto of Shakespeare's 2 Henry IV, thus establishing that Shakespeare of Stratford personally wrote out the Hand D passage. On the contrary, Alexander Waugh notes that the spelling 'scilens' is found in the anonymous A boke of prayers called ye ordynary faschyon of good lyuynge (published by William Middleton in 1546) (âContrary to swerving, use rather scilens'), in a letter dated 7 December 1552 from John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, to Sir William Cecil ('And, yf any perille by scilens kepinge sholde happen'), and in Archbishop Matthew Parker's translation of the Bible (1568), Ezekiel 24.17 (âMourne in scilens, make no mourning of the deadâ), facsimiles of which can be accessed at the links below. The spelling 'scilens' is also found in TCD MS 165, fol. 343v (see Parry, G.J.R., A Protestant Vision: William Harrison and the Reformation of Elizabethan England, (Cambridge University Press, 1987), p. 123, and in a letter dated 17 May 1582 from the spy William Herle to Lord Burghley (SP 12/86/42 f. 193), available online at the Letters of William Herle Project. Moreover Herle uses the very similar spelling 'scylens' in seven other letters to Lord Burghley, Sir Francis Walsingham, and the Earl of Leicester. Many other earlier examples can also be found (see link below)\n\nThe also perpetuates MacDonald Jackson's erroneous claim that the spelling 'straing' for 'strange' in Hand D 'fails by one instance to qualify as \"very rare\" ', and is therefore evidence that Shakespeare of Stratford personally penned the Hand D addition. On the contrary, the spelling 'straing' was very common in the Elizabethan and early Jacobean periods, as Alexander Waugh has demonstrated (see link below).\n\nThe also perpetuates MacDonald Jackson's erroneous support for Thomas Merriam's claim ('Some Further Evidence for Shakespeare's Authorship of Hand D in Sir Thomas More,' Notes and Queries 250 (2006): 65-8) that he had identifed unique 'collocations' which establish that Shakespeare of Stratford personally penned Hand D. On the contrary, all of Merriam's alleged 'collocations' are used by other authors and can be found in Early English Books Online, as Alexander Waugh has demonstrated (see the link below), and in no way support the claim that Shakespeare of Stratford personally penned Hand D.\n\nAnother prevalent Stratfordian myth is that Jonson satirized William Shakespeare of Stratford upon Avon as Sogliardo in the 1599 stage production by members of the Lord Chamberlain's Men of Every Man Out of His Humour, and in the three printed quartos of the play in 1600. This myth originated with a suggestion by the anti-Stratfordian, Sir George Greenwood, in 1908 in The Shakespeare Problem Restated which was speedily adopted by orthodox Stratfordian scholars and Baconians. Greenwood's suggestion was based on his unquestioning acceptance that William Shakespeare had a motto, whereas in fact the alleged motto was not invented for Shakespeare until 200 years after his death, and does not appear on his monument or on the 1599 draft grant of the Shakespeare arms. A drawing with the alleged motto first appeared in print in John Bellâs 1788 edition of Shakespeare. See The Dramatick Writings of Will. Shakspere, Prolegomena, Vol. II, (London: John Bell, 1788), following p. 510:\n\nhttps://books.google.ca/books?id=8Xk0AAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y\n\nThe first person to specifically discuss Non Sanz Droict as Shakespeare's alleged motto was the forger, John Payne Collier. See Collier, John Payne, The Works of Shakespeare, (London: Whittaker & Co., 1844), p. lxxvi at:\n\nhttps://books.google.ca/books?id=DpsNAAAAQAAJ&pg=PR76\n\nStill another prevalent Stratfordian myth is that the Shakespeare plays contain Warwickshire dialect. For a detailed refutation of this Stratmyth, see Barber, Rosalind, 'Shakespeare and Warwickshire Dialect', Journal of Early Modern Studies, n. 4 (2015), pp. 91-118:\n\nOXMYTHS\n\nResearch into Oxford's life has resulted in the publication of a series of errors and misconceptions about Oxford, dozens of which are discussed in the Oxmyth files at the links provided below (scroll to the foot of this page).\n\nOne Oxmyth merits particular discussion here. The most pervasive Oxmyth is the Prince Tudor or PT theory, which was adapted by Percy Allen and B.M. Ward from the 'secret messages' discovered by the American Baconians Orville Ward and Elizabeth Gallup in the 1890s and early 1900s. These 'secret messages' revealed that Queen Elizabeth had two sons by Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester: Francis Bacon (who wrote the Shakespeare canon) and Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. See Fagone, Jason, The Woman Who Smashed Codes, (New York: William Morrow, 2017).\n\nDuring the 1930s, Percy Allen and B.M. Ward attempted to adapt these Baconian 'secret messages' to Looney's hypothesis that Oxford was the author of the Shakespeare canon. However from the outset they encountered an insurmountable obstacle since Oxford, who was born in 1550, could not be substituted for the much younger Francis Bacon as the son of Queen Elizabeth and Leicester. Allen and Ward were thus forced to turn Oxford into Queen Elizabeth's lover, and to search for Oxford and the Queen's unidentified son. In the 1930s Allen and Ward explicitly rejected the theory that the son of Oxford and the Queen was Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton. See 'The Shakespeare Pictorial' (July 1935), and Allen, Percy and Captain B.M. Ward, An Enquiry Into the Relations Between Lord Oxford as \"Shakespeare,\" Queen Elizabeth and the Fair Youth of Shakespeare's Sonnets, published by Percy Allen in 1936, (British Library shelfmark 1176. c.2), pp. 2-3:\n\nReject, as invalid, the evidence and conclusions here epitomized, and who can guess, intelligently, at the identity of the Dark Lady â even among the women whom we know to have come intimately into Lord Oxfordâs life â or at the identity of the Fair Youth, who â because he was certainly an actor â cannot have been Southampton, nor any other English peer?\n\nInstead Allen claimed that the son of Oxford and the Queen was an actor named William Hughes. See Allen, Percy, Anne Cecil, Elizabeth and Oxford, (London: Denis Archer, 1934), pp. xii-xiv, and p. 261 at the Shakespeare Authorship Sourcebook website at https://sourcetext.com/sourcebook/:\n\n[A]nd if, as seems necesssary, we must conclude that both poems aim at the intimacy between Lord Oxford and his queen, of which a son, the Tudor Rose, and the âpurple flowerâ was born, we can find modern corroboration â and from a Stratfordian writer â in Lord Alfred Douglasâs recent interpretation of the Sonnets, wherein I read, on page 15, concerning:\n\nthe truth which is as nearly obvious as anything which is sometimes disputed can be said to be; namely, that the youth to whom Shakespeare addressed the greater part of the Sonnets was one William Hughes (or Hews, as the name would indifferently have been spelt).\n\nLord Alfred further concludes that this Will. Hughes is the âMr. W.H.â of the Sonnet dedication, and that he was an actor in âShakespeareâsâ and probably in other companies as well, though particularly in one which was acting Chapmanâs plays.Â This seems to be unanswerable . . . .\n\nAlarmed by early indications of the development of Ward and Allen's theories, J. Thomas Looney, the originator of the hypothesis that Oxford was the author of the Shakespeare canon, wrote in a letter dated 3 September 1933:\n\nMr. [Percy] Allen, on the other hand, with the support of Captain [B.M.] Ward, is now advancing certain views respecting Oxford and Queen Elizabeth which appear to me extravagant & improbable, in no way strengthen Oxfordâs Shakespeare claims, and are likely to bring the whole cause into ridicule.\n\nSee Paul, Christopher, 'A new letter by J. T. Looney brought to light', The Shakespeare Oxford Newsletter (Summer 2007), Vol. 43, No. 3, pp. 8-9, available online at http://www.geoffrey-hodgson.info/user/image/paul2008looneyletter.pdf.\n\nDespite J. Thomas Looney's outright rejection of the PT theory and his prescient warning that it would likely 'bring the whole cause into ridicule', Allen and Ward and their successors continued to extensively promulgate the PT theory, and in 1947 in Talks With Elizabethans, Allen, assisted by revelations obtained via seances in which he conversed with the spirits of Oxford, Francis Bacon, and Will Shakespeare, reversed his earlier claim that Southampton could not have been the Fair Youth of the Sonnets.\n\nIn 1952, in This Star of England, Dorothy Ogburn abandoned, without explanation, Percy Allen's claim that Southampton had been born at Richmond Palace at the end of February 1575, and substituted her own version of the Prince Tudor theory in which she claimed that Southampton was born at Havering in May or June 1574.\n\nThe subsequent development of the PT theory has thus resulted in three incest theories, each more repugnant than its predecessor: (1) that Lord Burghley promoted the marriage of Oxford's daughter, Elizabeth Vere, to her half brother, Southampton; (2) that Lord Burghley impregnated his daughter, Anne Cecil (see Ogburn, pp. 574-5); and (3) that Oxford was the son of Queen Elizabeth and Thomas Seymour, and that Queen Elizabeth and Oxford were Southampton's parents.\n\nNeither Roland Emmerich, the director of the film Anonymous, nor other current PT theorists acknowledge that the source of the theory that Oxford was the son of Queen Elizabeth and Thomas Seymour is a manuscript written circa 1950 by Dr. Walter Freeman of Fairleigh Dickinson University, and published in 1991 after Freeman's death by Dr. Peter Sammartino as Vol. XIX of the Fairleigh Dickinson University Archival Series.\n\nMoreover neither Emmerich nor other current PT theorists acknowledge that a source of the theory that Southampton was the son of Oxford and Queen Elizabeth was the seances conducted by the medium Hester Dowden for Percy Allen during the years 1942-5. See Parisious, Roger, 'Occultist Influence on the Authorship Controversy'.\n\nThe cornerstone of both incestuous branches of the current version of the PT theory is alleged allusions in the Sonnets to royal imagery in connection with Southampton, the 'Fair Youth'. However PT theorists fail to acknowledge that Allen and Ward explicitly rejected Southampton as the Fair Youth of the Sonnets in their publications in the 1930s, and that even if such allusions do exist, which is doubtful, they can be explained by the fact that Southampton was descended through the Nevilles, on his mother's side, from both King Edward I and King Edward III of England. See Richardson, Douglas, Plantagenet Ancestry (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing, 2004), pp. 160, 198-201, 505-10, and Stopes, Charlotte Carmichael, The Life of Henry, Third Earl of Southampton, Shakespeare's Patron (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1922), p. 488.\n\nYet another version of the PT theory developed recently by Steve Steinburg claims that both Oxford and Southampton were the sons of Queen Elizabeth by Leicester. See the Shakespeare Oxford Fellowship website at:\n\nhttps://shakespeareoxfordfellowship.org/the-rainbow-portrait-a-lovers-complaint-more-evidence-of-the-catastrophic-failure-of-professional-elizabethan-scholarship/\n\nThe fact that the PT theory is conclusively refuted by historical documents has had no effect on its proponents, including the Shakespeare Oxford Fellowship, which actively promotes all versions of the PT theory, no matter how extreme. The most conclusive of these documents which decisively refute the PT theory are the last will and testament of King Henry VIII, which precluded any illegitimate child of Queen Elizabeth from succeeding to the crown, and Oxford's indenture of 30 January 1575, in which Oxford arranged for the descent of his lands, explicitly stating in the indenture that he had no 'issue of his body yet born', that is, no children, legitimate or illegitimate ('considering that at this present he hath not any issue of his body yet born') (see ERO D/DRg/2/25 on this website).\n\nFor a detailed refutation of the Prince Tudor theory based on historical documents, see Paul, Christopher, ''The Prince Tudor Dilemma: Hip Thesis, Hypothesis, or Old Wives' Tale?', The Oxfordian, Vol. V (October 2002), pp. 47-69, available online at https://shakespeareoxfordfellowship.org/the-oxfordian/.\n\nSee also Christopher Paul's review of Shakespeare's Lost Kingdom in Brief Chronicles, Vol. II (2010) , Print Edition, pp. 244-57, available at Shakespeare's Lost Kingdom and http://www.briefchronicles.com/ojs/index.php/bc/article/view/73.\n\nSee also Price, Diana, 'Rough Winds Do Shake: A Fresh Look at the Tudor Rose Theory', The Elizabethan Review, Vol. 4, No. 2 (Autumn 1996), pp. 4-23, and Parisious, Roger Nyle, 'Occultist Influence on the Authorship Controversy', The Elizabethan Review, Vol. 6, No. 1 (Spring 1998), pp. 9-43, both available online at https://shakespeareoxfordfellowship.org/elizabethan-review-1993-1999/."
