        "text": "Marshall Islands History\n\nBeachcombers, Traders & Castaways in the Marshall Islands\n\nby Francis X. Hezel\n\nEver since foreign ships began visiting the islands, men came ashore to stay--some as deserters and beachcombers, some as castaways, some as traders. This is a list of those foreigners who came to the Marshall Islands to stay--at least for a while.\n\nThe list is organized alphabetically by name.\n\nNames are given as we know them--with aliases in some cases, with nothing but a question mark in others.\n\nDates are the years we know that a person lived in the islands. Often the overall stay was probably much longer.\n\nAll references are followed by abbreviated sources. The full references for all sources can be found at the end of the document\n\nAnderson Jaluit (1889-1890)\n\nAnderson, a Scotchman, was the manager of Crawford Company's station on Jaluit in 1889-1890. He is described by a contemporary as \"young, genial and popular.\"\n\nSources: Farrell 1928: 367-369\n\nBaker Majuro (c1915-1918)\n\nCaptain Baker, as he was known, was a trader on Majuro during German times. He was the last store-keeper before its close in 1918.\n\nSources: Chave 1947: 48\n\nBaiser Majuro (1875)\n\nBaiser was a trader on Majuro in 1875 working for Bully Hayes, but he asked the captain of the Protestant vessel \"Morning Star\" to take him off the island later that same year.\n\nSources: Colcord 1875: Journal on the Morning Star, 1875, p. 23\n\nLouis Becke Kosrae, Majuro (1874, 1882)\n\nLouis Becke, the author, may have been the supercargo on Bully Hayes' vessel \"leonora\" in the early 1870s. He spent several months on Kosrae when the \"Leonora\" was wrecked there. He is said to have traded on Majuro in 1882, but stayed there for only one year.\n\nSources: Browning 1972: 37\n\nFrank Benson Mili, Arno (1872-1883)\n\nFrank Benson, an American, was landed at Mili in January 1872 to be the agent of Bully Hayes on that island. He next appears in the records as an agent for Hernshim on Arno between 1880 and 1883.\n\nSources: Browning 1972: 35; Thurston 1885\n\nR. A. Berry Ebon (1884)\n\nBerry was a British subject of Irish descent. He lived on Ebon in 1884 as a trader for Henderson & MacFarlane. He left in December of that year to return to Ireland. He claimed that the people of Ebon stole $250 worth of his goods.\n\nSources: Moore 1884\n\nWilliam Bonar Ebon, Yap (1877-1878)\n\nBonar evidently resided in New Zealand. He was a trader on Ebon in the Marshalls for a short time, January-March 1977. He then was taken to Yap where he was an agent for Thomas Farrell for a little longer than a year. He returned to Auckland aboard the \"Vision\" in October 1878.\n\nSources: Young 1878: 13 Sept 1877; New Zealand Herald, 8 Oct 1878\n\nGeorge Brown (Basilio Terranova) Arno (1867-1881)\n\nBasilio Terranova was an Italian who first came to the Marshalls from Hawaii in 1867. He was working on Ben Peace's ship \"Blossom\" . He was still living there in 1872, working for Bully Hayes and Charles Howard. In April 1876 he began trading for Hernsheim Co., but soon began working on the \"Vision\". Terranova and his brother was still trading on Arno in 1881 and working for Hernsheim Co.\n\nSources: Young 1881: June 30, 1876; Pitman 1872: 23 May 1872; Moore 1872: 4; Restieaux 1869; Maxwell 1881\n\nHenry Burlingham (Burlingame) Majuro, Pingelap, Mili, (1869-1876)\n\nHenry Burlingham, was an American trader who resided on Pingelap sometime during the 1860s. When he moved to Majuro in 1869 to trade for Bully Hayes, he left his wife and child in Pingelap. Hayes later brought the child to Majuro charging the trader $50 for the favor. Burlingham is said to have talked people out of killing first Hawaiian missionary on Majuro who \"amused himself by breaking in young girls.\" Burlingham was still on Majuro in December 1871, and remained there for at least another year or two as an agent for Bully Hayes. He helped Kaibuke against Jibberik, a paramount chief of Majuro. He moved to Mili some time before 1876, but in June 1876 he was back on Majuro, trading for Capelle.\n\nSources: Restieaux 1869: 11-12; Young 1878; Pitman 1872; Dana 1935: 54-55; Browning 1972: 36\n\nJohn Cameron Mili, Jaluit, Pohnpei, Kiribati (1888-1893)\n\nJohn Cameron, a Scotchman, was shipwrecked at Midway for eight months in 1888. He and two others left the island in a small boat and made Mili on November 25 of that year. After a week or two there, he went to Jaluit on the vessel \"Ehukai.\" There he was employed by Crawford & Co. As the captain of the trade schooner \"Ebon,\" he visited Kosrae and Pohnpei on trading voyages. On Pohnpei he was arrested and tried by Sapnish authorities for selling guns to the people, but was soon released. Returning to the Marshalls, he served as the master of vessels for Crawford on Jaluit for a time. In 1892 he left Crawford & Co. to trade on his own in the Gilbert Islands. Cameron had married the daughter of a chief from Mejit. Finally, in 1893, Cameron left the Pacific altogether. Years later he was the subject of a book about his experiences in the Pacific.\n\nSources: Farrell 1928; Stevenson 1914: 119-120\n\nAdolph Capelle Ebon, Jaluit, Likiep, Chuuk (1859-c1911)\n\nAdolph Capelle was born in Hanover, Germany, in 1838. He first came to the Marshalls on the \"Pfeil,\" owned by Hoffschlaeger & Stapenhorst. He arrived on Ebon in 1859 at the age of 21. Capelle lived on the island for a time trading in coconut oil. In 1864, with the newly arrived Anton DeBrum as a partner, Capelle established his own trading company, A, Capelle & Co.\n\nIn 1873, after living on Ebon for more than a decade, Capelle moved to Jaluit, which was becoming the center of commerce. With their fleet of several small ships, Capelle & Co. expanded trading operations throughout the Marshalls and even into the eastern Carolines. Capelle was in Chuuk for several months in 1879 while setting buildings for a trade station there. Capelle & Co. sold their copra to one of the larger trade vessels belonging to one of the major firms in the Pacific. For a time, Godeffroy & Son was the firm they served. The company had a large store on Jaluit. Capelle was the consular agent for the US during the years he was based on Jaluit.\n\nJames Lyle Young, an agent for another firm in the Marshalls, was unsparing of Capelle in his diary. Young writes that Capelle, once a lay preacher for the church, has backslidden. He claims that Capelle has a tendency to see everything from one point of view--\"dollars and cents.\"\n\nCapelle and DeBrum purchased the island of Likiep for about twelve hundred dollars worth of trade in 1878. Thereafter Capelle and DeBrum used this as a copra plantation and a homestead. With their sons, Capelle and DeBrum began building small ships and started a variety of other businesses. Thereafter, Likiep became their base of operations.\n\nCapelle died about 1911.\n\nSources: Young 1878: 8 July 1876; LeHunte 1883a: judicial proceedings, 2; Moore 1872: 16; Hezel 1983: 210-226, 252-254, 267-268, 302-304; ABCFM: R. Logan's letter of 1879.\n\nH. Carr Majuro (1880-1883)\n\nH. Carr was a young Englishman who worked on Majuro for Henderson & MacFarlane in 1883. He was described as \"Smart, well-spoken....belonging to Streatham in Surrey.\" He may have stayed on Majuro for a couple of years. Bn 1885, however. he was trading in Melanesia for Read, another former Marshalls trader.\n\nSources: LeHunte 1883a: 21; LeHunte 1883b: 23; Thurston 1885; Hernsheim 1983: 77\n\nI.H. Clarke Majuro (1884)\n\nI.H. Clarke was the manager of the Henderson & MacFarlane trade station on Majuro in 1884.\n\nSources: Moore 1884\n\nWilliam Clarke Pohnpei, Mili (1869-1870)\n\nWilliam Clarke was discharged from \"Malolo\" on Pohnpei in October 1869. He signed on \"Malolo\" again at Mili in 1870. He spent at least a few months on Pohnpei and perhaps a little time on Mili.\n\nSources: Bridges 1870\n\nFrank Coffin Pingelap, Majuro, Mili (1868-1876)\n\nFrank Coffin was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts. He was a seaman on \"Blossom\" in 1867 and was put ashore in Pingelap about 1868 as a trader for Ben Pease. He was apparently an old man at the time. He complained that he was tormented during his stay there and finally left the island a few months later with another trader on Capelle's schooner. He came to Majuro in the same year and continued trading for Ben Pease. At some point, he moved to Mili, where he lived for a short time in 1876. He was reportedly forced to leave Mili after exhibiting his false teeth and frightening people into thinking that he was a demon. He returned to Majuro where he later died of a sickness that he had contracted on Pingelap.\n\nSources: Restieaux 1869: 5-7; Dana 1935: 53-4; Browning 1972: 36; Bridges 1870: 10 Jan 1869\n\nDick Cole Pohnpei, Ebon (1890)\n\nDick Cole was a trader for Crawford & Co. living on Pohnpei in 1890.\n\nSources: Farrell 1928: 347\n\nW. E. Cole Majuro, Pohnpei, Kosrae (1877-1880)\n\nW. E. Cole was born in 1848. He was a trader on Majuro in December 1877. He next showed up on Pohnpei for a time in early 1880, but he apparently lived on Kosrae at this time. He died of fever aboard \"Mathilde\" on his way back to Kosrae--his home in later years--on April 10, 1880. He left a \"white\" (although perhaps Samoan) wife and two small children. Cole's wife remained on Kosrae and was an agent for Capelle & Co. during the early 1880s.\n\nSources: Young 1881: 10 Apr 1889 and 12 Dec 1877\n\nGeorge Cunningham Jaluit, Ebon, (c1860-1864)\n\nGeorge Cunningham was an American from New Bedford, Massachusetts. He was said to have lived on Ebon \"for some years.\" It is uncertain when he arrived on Jaluit, but may have come about 1860.

He then moved to Majuro, probably working as an agent there, and he met the \"Neva\" at Majuro in April 1872. Roberts moved to Pohnpei about 1873 and began working there as an agent for Capelle & Co. He spent the next several years working on Pohnpei, but with shorter periods of time on some of the outliers in the area. In January 1880, for instance, he was living on Mokil while trading, but by November of that year he had returned to Pohnpei. Roberts was married to John Rees' former wife, a half-caste Samoan by the name of Elaisa Mativa.
