Minstrel Island is a draft of the libretto for a dystopian sci-fi musical. The plot—in which technology corporation IBM has taken over the world and seeks to eradicate the last refuge of artists on \"Minstrel Island\"—evinces thematic concerns and subject matter that became hallmarks of Pynchon's literary works. Although the first act is reasonably complete, acts two and three exist only as notes, and there is significant hand-written marginalia throughout. The manuscript is held by the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. [28]\n\nDate Title Genre Publication Publisher Notes Ref.

In 1989 a Foundation archivist made this document available to several researchers, including Steven Weisenburger, who describes (but does not quote from) it. Late in 1989, at Pynchon's request, the Ford Foundation closed the author's file for the next 50 years, making this manuscript generally unavailable until 2039.

Little, Brown An introduction to the collection of Pynchon's own early, previously published short stories. In the 20-page preface, Pynchon reflects on the development of his writing, with autobiographical details that have made it a rare source of information about his life. Though almost universally accepted as a work of nonfiction, the introduction has also been scrutinized as if it were a short story or a genre-ambiguous piece that may include elements of fiction.[39] Oct 28,\n\n1984 \"Is It O.K. to Be a Luddite?\" Essay The New York Times Book Review The New York Times Essay advocating for neo-Luddism.

During that time, only one technical article with Pynchon's byline appeared in print: the feature \"Togetherness\" in Aerospace Safety, a periodical published by the US Air Force rather than Boeing. While \"Togetherness\" is the only technical article that can be attributed to Pynchon with absolute certainty, it is considered extremely unlikely that he would have produced only one article during more than two years on the job. As such, scholars have conducted research to identify articles that can plausibly be attributed to Pynchon.\n\nPynchon is known to have worked primarily as a staff writer for Boeing's Bomarc Service News, an in-house periodical related to development of the CIM-10 Bomarc surface-to-air missile.[note 6] It remains possible, albeit uncertain and unlikely, that Pynchon contributed to other publications as part of his work at Boeing.[note 7] Definitive attribution of any Bomarc Service News articles to Pynchon is impossible because the publication never used bylines. Nonetheless, at least two scholars have used textual analysis in an attempt to identify likely Pynchon pieces:\n\nIn a 2000 article for Pynchon Notes, Adrian Wisnicki compiled a list of 24 \"probable\" and 10 \"possible\" examples of Pynchon's writing in Bomarc Service News based on stylistic and thematic similarities to known works.\n\nIn a 2019 article in the journal Textual Practice, Katie Muth used a stylometry-based authorship algorithm to identify eight Bomarc Service articles that were \"closely correlated\" with Pynchon's contemporaneous writing, as well as four that she determined were not correlated. Muth later claimed that, from the \"handful\" of Bomarc articles that could be reasonably attributed to Pynchon, two were \"particularly\" likely matches: \"Torquing\" (June 1960) and \"The Mad Hatter and the Mercury Wetted Relays\" (February 1962).\n\nThe following are Bomarc Service News articles assessed as potential Pynchon articles by Wisnicki, Muth, or both.\n\nArticles Pynchon may have written for Bomarc Service News Date Title Probability of Pynchon's authorship,\n\naccording to...

In 1984, she sold a collection of Pynchon's correspondence to her: 120 letters dated between March 4, 1963 and January 5, 1982. The buyer was Carter Burden, a collector of rare American literature. After Burden's death, his family arranged in 1998 to donate his literary collection to the Pierpont Morgan Library in Manhattan. The library initially intended to make the letters available to scholars by the end of the year. It also provided access to The New York Times, which published excerpts from some of the letters.[74] However, following expressions of disapproval from Pynchon's agent and his attorney, the library and Burden family walked back their plan to provide scholarly access. Instead, the library announced that the letters will remain private during Pynchon's lifetime. Aug\n\n1965 Letter to Jules Siegel Letter Cavalier Vol. 15, No. 146, p. 16 Fawcett Publications Several paragraphs from the letter—totaling 228 words—were quoted in \"The Dark Triumvirate\", an article in Cavalier magazine by Siegel (1935–2012) about the \"black humor\" of Pynchon, Bruce Jay Friedman, and Joseph Heller. Siegel indicated that the letter had been addressed to \"a suicidal writer friend\" but did not refer to its recipient by name. Others have surmised that it had been addressed to Siegel himself. Pynchon recommended the article to a friend, the folk etymologist Peter Tamony, indicating that he did not object to Siegel's extensive quotation from a private letter. In 1984, Steven Moore reprinted the quoted portion of the letter in the Fall 1984 issue of Pynchon Notes.[79] [79] Jul 17,\n\n1966 \"Pros and Cohns\" Letter to the editor The New York Times Book Review The New York Times Response to an accusation of plagiarism directed at Pynchon by the French author Romain Gary, who asserted that Pynchon had stolen \"Genghis Cohen\"—the name of a character in The Crying of Lot 49—from the titular character of Gary's 1967 novel The Dance of Genghis Cohn (La danse de Gengis Cohn). Pynchon denied the allegation, said he had never heard of Gary or his works, and claimed that their independent invention of a \"trivial\" pun on the name Genghis Khan was purely coincidental. [81] 1976 Letter to Richard Wilbur Letter Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the National Institute of Arts and Letters, 2nd series, Vol. 26, pp. 43–46: \"Presentation to Thomas Pynchon of the Howells Medal for Fiction of the Academy by William Styron\" American Academy of Arts and Letters The letter declined the William Dean Howells Medal for Fiction, which Pynchon had been awarded by the American Academy of Arts and Letterss for Gravity's Rainbow. At the time, Wilbur was president of the Academy. [83] Apr 28,\n\n1977 Letter to John Calvin Batchelor Letter to the editor The SoHo Weekly News Vol. 4, No. 30 (quoted in \"The Ghost of Richard Fariña\" by Batchelor) Michael Goldstein In an article published by the SoHo Weekly News on April 24, 1976, Batchelor alleged that there was no such person as Thomas Pynchon. Instead, Batchelor posited, the name was merely a pseudonym of J. D. Salinger, who had withdrawn from public life and stopped publishing fiction just before Pynchon's career began. In a letter written on MGM stationery, Pynchon replied: \"Not bad. Keep trying.\"[85] Batchelor quoted the letter in a follow-up piece, in which he conceded Pynchon's existence as a real person but maintained that Salinger had written most of Pynchon's works, while suggesting that others may have also contributed to the Pynchon oeuvre, including Donald Barthelme or even Pynchon himself. Later, Batchelor accepted Pynchon's sole authorship of his works. 1988 Letter to Thomas F. Hirsch Letter The Fictional Labyrinths of Thomas Pynchon by David Seed Macmillan Press Hirsch, a graduate student, wrote to Pynchon about material in chapter 9 of V. related to historical South West Africa. Pynchon replied to Hirsch in a letter dated January 8, 1969, which was published in 1988 as an appendix to The Fictional Labyrinths of Thomas Pynchon. [91] Mar 12,\n\n1989 \"Words for Salman Rushdie\" Letter The New York Times Book Review The New York Times \"Words for Salman Rushdie\" is a collection of open letters by \"28 distinguished writers born in 21 countries\" offering support to the British Indian author Salman Rushdie during the controversy against Rushdie's novel The Satanic Verses (1988). The New York Times Book Review published the letters less than a month after Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa calling for the deaths of Rushdie and his publishers. At 68 words, Pynchon's letter for Rushdie was one of his briefest published works. 1990 Letters to Corlies Smith Letter Of a Fond Ghoul The Blown Litter Press Corlies Smith (1929–2004) was the editor of Pynchon's first two novels at Lippincott. In 1990, seven of Pynchon's letters to Smith—dated between August 31, 1961, and June 2, 1962—were published without permission in the book Of a Fond Ghoul.[95] These letters concern the editing process readying V. for publication. The original copies were stolen from the offices of Harper & Row. Dec 5,\n\n2006 Letter to Dan Franklin at Jonathan Cape Letter The Daily Telegraph Telegraph Media Group Dan Franklin, then-director of the London publishing firm Jonathan Cape, solicited letters of support for English author Ian McEwan from prominent authors of historical fiction. McEwan had been accused of plagiarizing historical texts in his 2001 novel Atonement. Pynchon's letter was quoted in \"The borrowers: 'why McEwan is no plagiarist'\", an article by Nigel Reynolds in The Daily Telegraph. Other authors who made statements in McEwan's defense included Martin Amis, Margaret Atwood, Thomas Keneally, Zadie Smith, and John Updike. [101]\n\nThe following are written works for which there has been some claim or question of Pynchon's authorship. These were either works attributed to Pynchon upon publication—albeit dubiously—or works that attracted claims of being written by Pynchon under a pseudonym. None of these are generally accepted as authentic Pynchon writings, and in some cases the possibility of his authorship has been ruled out."
