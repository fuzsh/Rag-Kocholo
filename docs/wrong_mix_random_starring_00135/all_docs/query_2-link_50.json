Grant's company. Thomas acted as a counselor to Bishop Wm. H. Hickenlooper of the Sixth Ward, Salt Lake City, for a number of years, and afterwards officiated as acting Bishop of Morgan County. Subsequently he served as a member of the High Council of the Morgan Stake. He was sent by Pres. Brigham Young on the first exploring expedition to Cache valley in 1848, and later settled at Centerrifle, Davis county, Utah, where he took up 80 acres of land and engaged in farming. Together with Chas. S. Peterson and their sons e helped to build the first road through Weber valley. With William W. Potter and others he built the first boat and made the first known trip on the Great Salt Lake, exploring all the islands. The boat was named \"Mud Hen,\" and while navigating the lake the party were overtaken by a storm in which the members of the expedition came near loosing their lives. Bro. Thurston also established the first ferry on Bear river.\n\nThomas married Elizabeth Smith on November 18, 1855 in Salt Lake City. She was born February 26, 1835 in Newton, Burtonwood, Lancashire, England.\n\nThomas married Helen Maria Davis on May 3, 1862.\n\nThomas moved to St. George around 1884 with his second wife, Elizabeth Smith Thurston. They brought along the Brown Thurston Genealogy book with 10,000 names for the newly built temple to use. He spent the last little bit of his life working in the St. George Temple.\n\nThomas died in St. George on May 3, 1885. He is buried in Plot A_C_57_6 of the St. George City Cemetery.\n\nFAMILY\n\nParents and Siblings:\n\nPeter Thurston\n\nHannah Butler Thurston\n\nThomas Jefferson Thurston\n\nReuben Harris Thurston\n\nMaria Thurston\n\nCordelia Thurston\n\n(11/xx/1760-8/29/1827) (married xx/xx/~1802)\n\n(8/18/1772-5/23/1866)\n\n(2/12/1805-5/3/1885) (married as shown below)\n\n(12/11/1806-4/13/1880) (married Mary B Morse Thurston)\n\n(4/10/1810-3/4/1860) (married Orrin Chipman)\n\n(xx/xx/1813-10/xx/1863) (married Xxxxxxx X.
