        "text": "Tom Thurston, 41, is a general contractor. His wife, Tami, their two daughters, Greta, 11 and Leona, 9, along with Tom operate Double T Kennel. Tami runs the tour operation in the winter and their small marina at Stagecoach Reservoir State Park in the summer. They have been training sled dogs for 11 years now and began racing in 2006. He has completed the 350 mile Race to the Sky three times and the Seeley Lake 200 two times, winning each race once. After finishing the Iditarod in 2009 and scratching in 2010 and then finishing again in 2011, Thurston says, “Last year we had a blast! Beautiful weather, great trail and all the dogs had fun and finished fat and happy. This year we want to pick up the pace and see what they can do. I am real excited about the 2012 Iditarod more so than any other.” Last year Tom reported that the main sponsor of his kennel, General Physics, has decided to fund the majority of our kennel for the next three years. This is allowing them to build from their experiences to date. Tom lists his hobbies and interests as “family.”"
