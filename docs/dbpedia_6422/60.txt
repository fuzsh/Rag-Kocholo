‘An Australian/Irish International Co-Production, Besieged was filmed in the North-East Region of Victoria, Kelly Country. Australian outlaw Ned Kelly’s life has been the subject of many films including the Tony Richardson film starring Mick Jagger, and more recently the Heath Ledger film also staring Geoffrey Rush. Ned Kelly’s exploits are well known, and they raise the question was he an outlaw, a freedom fighter or a murdering terrorist? This documentary sets out to examine these issues and to tell the historically accurate story of Ned Kelly.’

‘A selection of fragments and scenes from the only known surviving silent titles of Australia’s bushranger films which, in the silent years of our cinema, were both prolific and popular.

They were a distinctive genre and a significantly part of our cultural heritage. But by 1912, censorship bans, provoked by ideas of law and order and morality, effectively robbed Australian moviegoers of a national screen identity. We were then to be culturally colonised by the Hollywood cowboy.’

Needless to say these cowboys were a poor cousin to our own ‘wild colonial boys’. It is interesting to note that three years after the Government imposed these strict censorship laws on morality they shipped off tens of thousands of young Australians to die overseas in The Great War!

Produced by the National Film and Sound Archive, this video includes scenes from The Story Of The Kelly Gang, both the 1906 and 1910 re-release, Thunderbolt 1910, The Kelly Gang 1920, Robbery Under Arms 1920 and When The Kellys Were Out 1923. It is a fascinating insight into the early Australian movie industry and the views of turn of the century society.
