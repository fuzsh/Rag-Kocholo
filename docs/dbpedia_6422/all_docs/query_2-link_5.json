It was originally envisioned that it would be a mini series but it was budgeted at a million dollars an hour which was felt to be too expensive. So it was decided to make a film as well at the same time, based on separate scripts.[5]\n\nThere were two writers and two directors. Writing the script took two years.[5]\n\nThe film was shot partly on location in the Flinders Rangers and at the SAFC studios in Adelaide.[2] The two directors collaborated well together, and Ken Hannam was relieved to work with the SAFC again after the difficulties on Sunday Too Far Away.[5]\n\nProduction took 20 weeks.[6]\n\nBox office\n\n[edit]\n\nRobbery Under Arms grossed $226,648 at the box office in Australia.[7]\n\nHome media\n\n[edit]\n\nRobbery Under Arms has been released twice by Umbrella Entertainment: as a two-part dual-layer DVD in a 16:9 transfer (DAVID 0477), also as a three-part two-disc DVD pack in the original 4:3 aspect ratio (DAVID2852) released September 2017.\n\nExtras\n\n[edit]\n\nIncluded is a 45-minute \"special feature\" On Location with Robbery Under Arms, filmed separately by SA Telecasters (Channel 10, which later became Channel 7). It shows much of the art, techniques and social atmosphere involved in the making of the film at Wilpena Pound and Hahndorf, as well as commentary by the major participants.\n\nProducer/Director: Lou Sedivy\n\nTechnical producer: Greg Cameron\n\nTechnical directors: Mike McAuliffe and David Bates\n\nExecutive producer: Trevor Lanyon\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCinema of Australia\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
