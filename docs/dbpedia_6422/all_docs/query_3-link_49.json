        "text": "Or, TheÂ First Great Train Robbery (1978) if you are British. I decided to take a look at this old flick (which came out the same year I was born, so I guess I, too, count as “old”) which was written and directed by Michael Crichton of Jurassic Park fame, and stars Sean Connery, Donald Sutherland, and Lesley-Anne Down. Based on a true event that happened in 1855, the film is a pretty typical heist flick, but in fancy period costume, so it hit two of my personal weaknesses right off the bat. Of course, in true 1970s fashion the plot got a little beleaguered with its own high-minded premise and I started to lose interest about halfway through (the gin and tonics didn’t super help, either), so I can’t really comment on whether or not it’s worth watching for the plot. That said, the costumes weren’t terrible and Sean Connery is Sean Connery, if you know what I mean. So if you dig a hairy chest and a Scottish accent, I suppose you may find the film worthwhile!\n\nThe costumes were designed by Anthony Mendleson, who had a career going back to the 1940s by the time he got around to putting Lesley-Anne Down in a corset without a chemise in this film, but for folks of my generation/specific taste in bad movies, he’s probably best known for his work on Dragonslayer (1981) and Krull (1983). Honestly, while there are a couple of standout uses of upholstery in period costume inÂ The Great Train Robbery, much of the costumery is … well … It’s not great, but it’s notÂ bad.Â\n\nAll in all, this film is not going to blow anyone’s socks off with an amazing plot or amazing acting or, obviously, amazing costuming. But it was a harmless 1 hour and 50 minutes and I’m not mad about having watched it.\n\nDid you like The Great Train Robbery (1978)? Tell us about it in the comments!"
