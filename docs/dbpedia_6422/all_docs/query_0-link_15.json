        "text": "Citation preview\n\nPREFACE\n\nW E L C O M E TO T H E U N D E RWO R L D\n\nThe underworld of crime, the ‘city under the city’, is a shadowy world, full of unpleasant, untrustworthy people. But for some reason, crime movies hold a special place in cinema audiences’ affections. Many of the highest-grossing, most popular US films of all time fall into this category: The Godfather films, Pulp Fiction, and various stellar, all-action cops and robbers movies, often depicting the perfect crime. Something about breaking the law and getting away with it seems to appeal to everyone. The loveable outlaws Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), incarnated by Paul Newman and Robert Redford, were equally loveable when updated to thirties Chicago conmen in The Sting (1973), with equal boxoffice success.The aim of this book is to discover and enjoy this enduring appeal. Inspired by Turner Classic Movies’ annual Crime Wave season, the movies I’ve chosen for inclusion in this book are seminal Hollywood films, both in their genre and their respective eras. Crime is a feature of so many films, from westerns to horror movies, murder mysteries to historical epics: in fact any film in which the law is broken. As a guide, I’ve kept within certain genre boundaries, while discussing as many movies as possible. All the films examined in this book take place in the ‘real world’, and, in one form or another, look at crime fighting, corruption, thievery or vice. Crime Wave includes the classic gangster flicks of the thirties and forties, often detailing bootlegging, robbery and smuggling: The Public Enemy, High Sierra and White Heat. I also trace the development of the post-war film noir style, from The Maltese Falcon and Kiss Me Deadly to the knowing post-modernism of Chinatown and L.A. Confidential. There are tough B-movies from the thrifty fifties, such as The Big Combo; tales of gangster revenge (Point Blank and Get Carter) and Quentin Tarantino’s genre-referential Pulp Fiction. There are heist and caper movies, epitomised by The Asphalt Jungle and Ocean’s Eleven. Also discussed are lone, rulebreaking cops (Dirty Harry), buddy cops (Lethal Weapon), global crime (On Her Majesty’s Secret Service), blaxpoitation action (Shaft) and even a gangster love story: Bonnie and Clyde. And of course there are the four great gangster epics, directed by Martin Scorsese, Sergio Leone and Francis Ford Coppola: GoodFellas, Once Upon a Time in America, The Godfather and The Godfather Part II. Each film is analysed in detail, with biographies and filmographies of key participants, accounts of the films’ making (including details of sets and location filming), their critical reception, performance at the US and UK box office and influence on the crime genre. Where appropriate, there are notes on the films’ vii\n\nviii\n\nCRIME WAVE\n\nliterary inspirations or references to their historical period. Historical accuracy, particularly in B-movies, is often not one of the genre’s strong points, while other directors, notably Coppola and Leone, are scrupulous within their eras. Two notes concerning the text: firstly, when I refer to film and book titles, the film title is italicised, the book isn’t. Thus: ‘The Maltese Falcon’ for Dashiell Hammett’s book, The Maltese Falcon for John Huston’s film. Secondly, a note on the ratings certification system in the UK and US. The system in the UK is governed by the BBFC: the British Board of Film Classification. Until 1951 the main ratings were simply U (Universal) and A (Adults); in 1951 the X-rating was introduced, for over 16s. After 1970, the ratings in the UK were U (Universal), A (suitable for under-14s), AA (suitable for accompanied over-14s) and X (suitable for 18-year-olds and over). In 1982, this changed to U, PG (parental guidance) and the age bands 15 and 18. In 1989, certificate 12 was added. In the US, from the early thirties until 1968, films were subject to the strict Hayes Code. After 1968, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) introduced a ratings system: G (general), M (suggested for mature audiences), R (restricted – under-17s must be accompanied), X (no one under 17 admitted). M was soon changed to GP (general audiences, parental guidance suggested) and then to PG (parental guidance). In July 1984, this became: G (general)/PG (parental guidance suggested)/PG-13 (no one under 13 admitted, unless accompanied)/R (restricted, under 17 years need accompanying)/NC-17 (no one under 17 admitted). I hope this helps to clarify any certificates mentioned in the text. Finally, in these chapters you will find some of the great crime stars, in some of their greatest films: James Cagney on top of the world, Humphrey Bogart pursuing the black bird, Sterling Hayden prowling the asphalt jungle, Lee Marvin escaping Alcatraz, Clint Eastwood feeling lucky, Michael Caine spilling blood on the Tyne, Joe Pesci getting whacked, Robert De Niro being a wiseguy, George Clooney taking the pot and Marlon Brando making you an offer you can’t refuse. Accept it, it’s well worth the time.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nI would like to thank Philippa Brewster, my editor at I.B.Tauris, for initiating the Crime Wave project, and for her ideas and support throughout its writing. Thanks also to Deborah Susman, Paul Davighi, Hannah Ross and Stuart Weir at I.B.Tauris, and to Robert Hastings at Dexter Haven Associates. Thanks to Andrew Hanratty for additional research, for loaning me various essential source movies and for his restoration work on the posters and stills reproduced here. All illustrative material is from my own collection. Thanks also to Mike Coppack for extra research, tracking down rare source material and for offering insights on everything from the Lethal Weapon movies to the criminal psychology of the Zodiac Killer. Thank you also to Andrew Collins, Alex Cox, Paul Duncan and Stuart Maconie, for taking the time to name their top ten crime movies. All their lists are totally different and I’m sure that each of them could easily have named their top twenty crime films – and still had difficulty pruning the list. Their favourites also remind us how many great films have been made in the genre. Thanks too, to the following people who have contributed to the writing and research of Crime Wave: Belinda and Chris Skinner, Alex and Isabel Coe, Nicki and John Cosgrove, Rhian Thomas, Pen Kennedy, Sir Christopher Frayling, Paul Duncan, Gareth Jones, Tom Betts, Ann Jackson, Rene Hogguer, Chris and Roger Brown, David Weaver, William Connolly, Mike Oak and Tracey Mansell, SonyaJayne Stewart and Bob Bell, Nick Rennisson, Simon Hawkins and Lionel Woodman. Thanks again to my parents, Carol and John, for their continued enthusiasm, help and support. And finally thank you to Clara, who not only sat through the entire Lethal Weapon series on consecutive nights, she has helped me with research, sourcing illustrations, books, videos and DVDs. Without her encouragement and support, this book would never have been finished.\n\nix\n\nCRIMINAL RECORD: AN INTRODUCTION TO CRIME MOVIES\n\nGangsterism and criminality in the nineteenth-century United States were associated with outlaws in the wild west; bandits such as Jesse James and Butch Cassidy, folk heroes fronting gangs named the ‘Hole-in-the-Wall’ and the ‘Wild Bunch’. But in the east, in the big cities, with their rising immigrant populations, gangs such as the Dead Rabbits, the Shirt Tails, the Plug Uglies and the Roach Guards were fighting turf wars on the streets of New York, as depicted in Martin Scorsese’s Gangs of New York (2002). Predominant among the street gangs were the immigrant communities of Irish, Italian and Chinese; the Chinese immigrants brought with them their Triad Societies, later renamed the Tongs, secret sects rooted in ritual, which gained a foothold in these nascent cities. When crime became more organised, in the early twentieth century, it became more prominent. With the puritanical Volstead Act, declaring Prohibition in 1920, the sale and consumption of alcohol went underground and the criminals and bootleggers thrived. Irish and Italian gangsters battled it out for control of New York and Chicago. It was in the latter city that the most famous gangster atrocity\n\nThe Untouchables: gangster iconography adorns a fairground shooting gallery; Robert Stack as Tommy-gun-toting Eliot Ness (photograph Clara Hughes). xi\n\nxii\n\nCRIME WAVE\n\ntook place, after four long years of Beer War. On 14 February 1929, five gunmen, some disguised as cops, employed by mobster Al Capone (‘Public Enemy Number One’), machine-gunned seven rival Irish gangsters. The victims were members of the North Siders, Bugs Moran’s gang. They had met in Moran’s bootlegging depot, the North Clark Street garage, to plan Capone’s demise, when the killers struck. As a result of the St Valentine’s Day Massacre, Sicilian gangster ‘Lucky’ Luciano organised ‘Murder Incorporated’, a self-regulatory gangland outfit, which killed mobsters who broke the criminal code. These enforcers thought they were doing the cities a favour. As James Woods’s up-and-coming New York gangster says in Once Upon a Time in America (1984), when told that his form of urban crime is a disease: ‘This country is still growing up…certain diseases it’s better to have when you’re still young.’\n\nC R I M E WAV E 3 0 s\n\nThe thirties were the heyday of gangster movies, with Warner Bros Studios leading the way. There had been one notable silent crime movie, Joseph Von Sternberg’s Chicago-set Underworld (1927). In Germany, Fritz Lang had directed M (1931), with the criminal underworld and the Berlin Homicide Squad joining forces to track down a child murderer, chillingly portrayed by Peter Lorre. Originally called Murderers Among Us, the film was retitled when the Nazi party sensed it referenced their infiltration of society. The killer is described as ‘a danger often cloaked in a friendly disguise’ and the sense of paranoia, as fear and suspicion spread through the city like a plague, vividly brings Lang’s depiction of urban criminality to life. But with the advent of sound, the crime genre really took off in the US, concentrating on the topical subjects of bootlegging, racketeering, gang war, kidnap and murder. The most fashionable type of early gangster movies was the Broadway crime movie, which looked at the links between the underworld and the theatre world. The relatively recent addition of sound ensured audiences heard their fair share of musical numbers, in films such as The Lights of New York (1928), Tenderloin (1928 – which concerned bootleggers, not butchers), Broadway (1929) and Broadway Thru a Keyhole (1933), with chorus girls on the ladder to stardom, mixing with mobsters. The influence of such early musical gangster movies can be seen throughout crime cinema; The Girl Can’t Help It (1956), for example, featured Jayne Mansfield as a tone-deaf gangster’s moll, who mobster Edmond O’Brien is convinced can be transformed into a singing sensation. But in the thirties, a triumvirate of crime films quickly established a tougher side to the genre and ensured its global popularity. Each depicted a criminal’s spectacular rise and equally dramatic fall, and all made stars of their leading actors. Edward G. Robinson starred as Cesare Enrico Bandello, alias Rico in Little Caesar\n\nCRIMINAL RECORD: AN INTRODUCTION TO CRIME MOVIES\n\n(1930). The film ended with the death of Rico on the steps of a church and his classic final line: ‘Mother of God…is this the end of Rico?’ (which was altered by the censors to ‘Mother of mercy’ in some prints). Rico was based on Al Capone, who was incarcerated that same year for the less-than-glamorous crime of three years’ tax evasion; his defence was that he didn’t think he’d have to pay tax on money garnered illegally. The second, and best, of the three crime films was William A. Wellman’s The Public Enemy (1931), with James Cagney’s dynamic turn as Irish hood Tom Powers, based in part on Bugsy Moran’s associate, Dion O’Banion. This also climaxed with the mobster’s memorable demise: here Power’s trussed-up corpse is delivered to his mother’s doorstep. The third and most controversial of the three was Scarface, Shame of a Nation (1932), directed by Howard Hawks and starring Paul Muni as Tony Camonte and George Raft as his coin-tossing sidekick, Guido Rinaldo. Based on the novel by Armitage Traill, it was written for the screen by Ben Hecht and W.R. Burnett, as another thinly disguised biography of Al Capone. Hawks had trouble from the censors concerning the film’s violence (one version ends with Camonte being hanged) and the movie was held back for over a year. Hecht was visited by Capone’s heavy mob, who had heard it was about their boss. Hecht managed to convince them it was based on other mobsters and the ‘Scarface’ reference was simply to attract cinemagoers. Capone reputedly liked the film and even bought his own copy. With the success of these three films, many imitations followed, though few equalled their power. Unlike the conflicting wild-west heroes and villains, these gangster badmen were completely amoral: violence is underhand and treachery rife. A code of honour, which existed in the film versions of the old west, is completely absent from the crime movie. Death comes with a knife in the back, or machine-gun ambush, and there are no rules in the urban jungle. It was ironic that for the first years of the thirties, these men were heroes. As the decade wore on, James Cagney made two more films now regarded as classics. First he starred in Angels With Dirty Faces (1938), one of his most popular films. It is a highly moral version of the ‘rise and fall’ scenario, with a justly famous electric chair finale. Then Cagney released The Roaring Twenties (1939), which looked at how economic factors and unemployment following the First World War pushed men into a life of crime. In this period, future crime-movie icon Humphrey Bogart made his name as a supporting heavy, in Warners’ films The Petrified Forest (1936) and The Roaring Twenties (1939), forever in the shadow of a star, which rankled with Bogart. There were also many spoofs of the genre, including Cagney and Robinson sending up their own gangster images in Lady Killer (1933) and A Slight Case of Murder (1938) respectively, while Buster Keaton parodied bootleggers with What? No Beer? (1933). After their success in Dead End (1937) and Angels With Dirty Faces (1938), rough and tumble street urchins the Dead End Kids started a fad for juvenile crime gang films. These ranged from social dramas to knockabout comedies and\n\nxiii\n\nxiv\n\nCRIME WAVE\n\nhorror spoofs. The Dead End Kids’ imitators, competitors or spin-off projects included the ‘Little Tough Guys’ series (see Little Tough Guy – 1938, Code of the Streets – 1939, You’re Not so Tough – 1940, and six further adventures), the East Side Kids (stars of 22 features, including Spooks Run Wild – 1941) and the Bowery Boys (who made 48 features between 1946 and 1958). Stringent censorship and the reining in and dismantling of the real gangsters’ power saw the on-screen G-men (government agents) fighting back from the midthirties onwards, spearheaded by Cagney’s turn as James ‘Brick’ Davies in G-Men, based on the book ‘Public Enemy No. 1’ by Gregory Rogers. Released in April 1935, G-Men was a box-office smash and spawned many rushed-out sequels and derivatives: Public Hero Number One (1935), Counterfeit (1936 – featuring T-men, treasury agents), Trapped by G-Men (1937), When G-Men Step In (1937) and the western-set Border G-Man (1938).\n\nC R I M E WAV E 4 0 s\n\nLike everyone from Charlie Chan to Gene Autry, during the war years cinema cops tended to be combating Nazis, rather than their usual gangster opponents. Notable cop movies include T-Men (1948) and Border Incident (1949), both directed by Anthony Mann. Nevertheless, gangster biopics enjoyed a comeback. Some of the better-known examples include Lady Scarface (1941), Johnny O’Clock (1947) and Dillinger (1945), starring Lawrence Tierney, who was later to become the boss of the Reservoir Dogs (1992). Looming over all forties crime biographies and looking down from the top of the world was Cody Jarrett in White Heat (1949), given the definitive portrayal by James Cagney, in his most-remembered gangster role. With the economic cutbacks and pessimism of the Second World War came the popularity of film noir, with mysteries, haunted antiheroes and femmes fatales to the fore. The male lead in film noir was often a private eye or cop, drawn into a spider’s web of power, corruption and lies. This suffocating web of intrigue is often reflected in the films’ photographic style, with dark shadows and sinister atmospherics, more in the manner of Universal’s horror movies or German expressionism. But often, such style was a direct result of wartime thriftiness. The heroes have a fatalistic awareness of their own doom, which suited the films’ dark morality tales, often with downbeat finales. The creeping tendrils of mystery often emit from a femme fatale (literally ‘deadly woman’), who through her own obsessional kismet leads the hero to face his fate. The stories often take place in flashback, and the past tends to be something to be escaped and forgotten, rather than recalled nostalgically. Some of these noirs were little more than thin melodramas with a surfeit of style; others have stood the test of time and are perceptive and stylish works of art. Outstanding examples include Double Indemnity (1944), The Blue Dahlia (1946), The Spiral Staircase (1946), The Big Combo (1955) and Touch of Evil (1958).\n\nCRIMINAL RECORD: AN INTRODUCTION TO CRIME MOVIES\n\nHumphrey Bogart kicked off the forties by shedding his second-from-the-left, blink-and-you’ll-miss-him, bad-guy image by playing what for many is the definitive screen detective: Dashiell Hammett’s Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon (1941). Following Casablanca (1942), Bogart returned to the genre with The Big Sleep (1946), where he enacted the most famous incarnation of private eye Philip Marlowe in Raymond Chandler’s mystery. Chandler himself became involved with the film industry and co-scripted Double Indemnity and The Blue Dahlia. Other mysteries of the period included The Mask of Dimitrios (1944) and The Glass Key (1942). The best screen adaptation of Chandler’s work was Farewell My Lovely (1944 – Murder, My Sweet in the US), with Claire Trevor as the murderous Mrs Grayle and former musical star Dick Powell as Marlowe. Much was made of Powell’s new incarnation on posters: ‘Two-fisted, Hardboiled, Terrific – Meet the New Dick Powell!’ Noir posters, like their subjects, were very stylish, featuring wispy smoke, the fog of dreams and the past, guns, dames and tangled cobwebs. The femme fatale was invariably the most important ingredient in forties crime movies. As the poster to Farewell My Lovely stated, ‘Forget that Feeling…She’s got Murder in her Heart!’ Other forties films had a mobster as the central character, some of which incorporated a noir flavour. These included Bogart’s transitional High Sierra (1941), the Robert Mitchum vehicle Out of the Past (1947 – also called Build My Gallows High) and Kiss of Death (1947 – worth seeing for Richard Widmark’s wired debut as murderous Tommy Udo). Key Largo (1948) boasted an unhinged performance by Edward G. Robinson, while the 1946 film version of Ernest Hemingway’s short story ‘The Killers’ featured the steamy pairing of Ava Gardner and Burt Lancaster (in his film debut). There was also Force of Evil (1949), Panic in the Streets (1949 – in which bubonic plague represents the spread of crime) and the cult classic Gun Crazy (1949), concerning a pair of Bonnie-and-Clyde-style hoods.\n\nC R I M E WAV E 5 0 s\n\nIn fifties Hollywood, the success of The Asphalt Jungle (1950) gave rise to a new breed of urban noir, the heist movie. Other examples include Armoured Car Robbery (1950), Crime Wave (1953), 5 Against the House (1955 – a casino robbery), Violent Saturday (1955) and Stanley Kubrick’s justly famous racetrack robbery, The Killing (1956). In France, Rififi (1955) set a new standard for heist movies, with its silent 30-minute jewel robbery. There was also renewed popularity in the gangster biography, now using real names yoked to predominately invented narratives. In The Bonnie Parker Story (1958), Dorothy Provine starred as the title gangster, according to the posters, a ‘Cigar smoking Hellcat of the Roaring Twenties’ – Parker’s life of crime started in 1932. Other criminals given the big-screen treatment were Baby Face Nelson (1958), Machine-Gun Kelly (1958) and Al Capone (1959). The decade saw Humphrey\n\nxv\n\nxvi\n\nCRIME WAVE\n\nBogart’s last work, with The Enforcer (1951), The Harder They Fall (1956 – his last film), and a return to his villainous thirties roots with The Desperate Hours (1955). There were also memorable B-movies from RKO (Roadblock [1951] and The Narrow Margin [1952]), United Artists (Kansas City Confidential – 1952) and Republic (Hoodlum Empire – 1952). The cops were still in evidence, but for a while it was difficult to see whose side they were on. This was a feature of Hollywood cinema in the fifties, which had an uneasy political atmosphere. Big John Wayne moseyed into town as Big Jim McClain (1952), an investigator for the House of Un-American Activities, rooting out Communists in Hawaii; I Was a Communist for the FBI (1951) covered similar ground. The Big Heat (1953) and The Big Combo (1955) were both condemned for their violence. Orson Welles’s much-tampered-with Touch of Evil (1958) depicted police corruption in a sleepy, sleazy Mexican border town that would have probably benefited from employing a sheriff like John Wayne. There were some crime oddities in the fifties, with Robert Aldrich’s Kiss Me Deadly (1955) proving to be one of the strangest. Ostensibly an adaptation of a Mickey Spillane novel about the search for a case full of drugs, it was transformed by Aldrich into something very stylish, different and topical. Here a case containing an atomic bomb is used as a metaphor for nuclear war and the end of mankind, creating a new genre along the way: apocalyptic sci-fi noir. Following on from the Dead End Kids, juvenile delinquency kept the cops busy across town, with Crime in the Streets (1956) and a Rumble on the Docks (1956), and reached its height in the choreographed gang wars of West Side Story (1961). The fifties saw several gangster spoofs, though the humour was often rather laboured; only two films really hit the mark. The first was the UK Ealing comedy The Ladykillers (1955), with five shifty robbers posing as a classical quintet and planning their heist while staying in a boarding house with dear old Mrs Wilberforce. Among the crooks are Peter Sellers and Herbert Lom, later reunited in the ‘Pink Panther’ crime series, and the gang’s leader, Professor Marcus, played by Alec Guinness. In Billy Wilder’s Some Like It Hot (1959), two out-of-work musicians, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, go on the run after witnessing the St Valentine’s Day Massacre and hide out in drag, on tour with Sweet Sue’s all-girl jazz band, including their ‘Jell-O on springs’ lead singer, Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe). The film included a humorous cameo by thirties star George Raft as ‘Spats Colombo’, the gangster on their trail. C R I M E WAV E 6 0 s\n\nWith huge TV audiences, cinema audiences dwindled, and most of the best crime entertainment in the sixties was in TV shows such as The Untouchables, with Robert Stack as tough-as-nails Eliot Ness, and Danger Man (shown in the US as Secret Agent), with Patrick McGoohan as John Drake. Such was their popularity that The\n\nCRIMINAL RECORD: AN INTRODUCTION TO CRIME MOVIES\n\nUntouchables released a spin-off feature, The Scarface Mob (1959), while two colour Danger Man episodes (‘Koroshi’ and ‘Shinda Shima’) were glued together into a feature (released in the US as Koroshi in 1966). In 1962, United Artists adapted Ian Fleming’s ‘Dr No’ for the big screen, with Sean Connery in the lead as British superagent James Bond. The film and its sequels were a huge global success. Bond was a new type of hero – suave and sophisticated: brutal, clever and smartly turned out. He replaced the scruffy private sleuth and the explosive G-man as a new type of wisecracking antihero. In the US, such escapism was an antidote to the early sixties gloom following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The Bond films started their own spy-movie industry. The most successful were a pair of Derek Flint films starring James Coburn (Our Man Flint [1966] and In Like Flint [1967]), four Dean Martin ‘Matt Helm’ films (The Silencers [1966], Murderers Row [1966], The Ambushers [1968] and The Wrecking Crew [1969]), based on the books by Donald Hamilton, and a very hip resurrection of Bulldog Drummond in the superior, exotic Deadlier Than the Male (1967 – and its lesser sequel Some Girls Do in 1969). On US TV there was The Man from UNCLE (Ian Fleming contributed the name Napoleon Solo to the series), I Spy (with Bill Cosby and Robert Culp as the undercover agents posing as tennis stars), Mission Impossible (detailing the exploits of the Impossible Mission Force) and Get Smart! (a US Bond spoof written by Mel Brooks). If they weren’t trying to emulate the success of the Bond franchise, crime movies in the sixties were dominated by a new kind of European cinema that took the American crime movie as a template. They were spearheaded by the directors of the French New Wave (the ‘Nouvelle Vague’). François Truffaut’s Les Quatres Cents Coups (1959 – The 400 Blows) detailed juvenile delinquency in a poetic, moving way. JeanLuc Godard’s À Bout de Souffle (1959 – Breathless) told of the relationship between a young American woman in Paris and a small-time hoodlum. Godard’s science fiction Alphaville (1965) satirised French spy movies, such as those starring Eddie Constantine as secret agent Lemmy Caution; Constantine sent up Caution, his trench-coated, chain-smoking antihero, to great effect in Godard’s film. But it was Jean-Pierre Melville who created the finest French gangster movies of the decade, with Le Deuxième Souffle (1966 – Second Breath) and his slow-burning story of a hitman, Le Samouraï (1967), starring Alain Delon. Italy also made some distinctive gangster movies, often based on real-life gangsters and bandits: Salvatore Giuliano (1962), Wake Up and Kill (1966), The Violent Four and Day of the Owl (both 1968). Internationally, even Japan made their own brand of crime thrillers, dubbed ‘Yakuzas’, the best of which were two films produced by the Nikkatsu Studio and directed by Seijun Suzuki: Tokyo Nagaremono (1966 – Tokyo Drifter) and Koroshi no Rakuin (1967 – Branded to Kill). US crime movies began to show a stylistic and narrative influence from Europe, especially Bonnie and Clyde and Point Blank (1967), an existential revenge drama\n\nxvii\n\nxviii\n\nCRIME WAVE\n\nwith Lee Marvin. Both these films also highlighted a sudden rise in the US of on-screen violence, in films such as Johnny Cool (1963), The Killers (1964), Madigan, Bullit, Coogan’s Bluff and The Detective (all 1968). In the US, gangster biopics were still popular, from Ma Barker’s Killer Brood (1960) and The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond (1960) to The St Valentine’s Day Massacre and the phenomenally successful Bonnie and Clyde (both 1967). There was even The George Raft Story (1961 – also called Spin of a Coin). But these biographies became few and far between and rare seventies additions included Warren Oates as Dillinger (1973), Melvin Purvis – G-Man (1974 – also called The Legend of Machine Gun Kelly) and its sequel, The Kansas City Massacre (1975 – both originally made for TV), Capone (1975 – with Ben Gazzara in the title role) and The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover (1977). The sixties was the one era when to be an ‘international jewel thief ’ was a valid occupation. Caper films were immensely popular; they were a lighter, more ingenious and less believable version of heist movies such as The Asphalt Jungle and The Killing. Caper movie escapism began with Ocean’s Eleven (1960), a ridiculous movie about 11 army buddies who rob five Las Vegas casinos in one night. The trend continued throughout the decade and into the seventies. The best examples include the UK-made The League of Gentlemen (1960), Istanbul-set Topkapi (1964) and the classic The Italian Job (1969). Euro-heist movies include Operation San Genarro (1966), Operation Saint Peter’s (1967), After the Fox (1966), Grand Slam (1967), They Came to Rob Las Vegas (1968) and The Sicilian Clan (1969). A rash of flashy US productions included Assault on a Queen (1966), The Biggest Bundle of Them All (1967) and The Thomas Crown Affair (1968). C R I M E WAV E 7 0 s\n\nThe most successful robbery caper at the box office was the multimillion-dollar star vehicle The Sting (1973), George Roy Hill’s follow-up to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). Paul Newman and Robert Redford played a pair of Chicago conmen (Henry Gondorff and Kid Hooker) out to fleece mobster Doyle Lonnegan, ‘The Big Mick’ (Robert Shaw), in a cleverly conceived betting scam. Hill’s film is now best remembered for the rearrangements of Scott Joplin’s rag ‘The Entertainer’; a further sequel, The Sting II (1983), with Jackie Gleason and Mac Davis in the Newman and Redford roles, hinged on a rigged boxing match. Undoubtedly the biggest crime box-office hits of the seventies were the Godfather Mafia films, Parts I and II (1972 and 1974), whose influence and success were immense. Significantly, the first film was based on a best-selling novel by Mario Puzo, the producers hoping for a ready-made audience, but the film’s success was by no means guaranteed. Moreover, the four Best Picture Oscar winners, 1971–74 were all crime movies: The French Connection, The Godfather, The Sting and The Godfather Part II, proving the genre’s renewed popularity.\n\nCRIMINAL RECORD: AN INTRODUCTION TO CRIME MOVIES\n\nPrivate eyes were also back in style in the seventies. There was James Garner as Marlowe (1969), an update of Raymond Chandler’s ‘The Little Sister’, and Warren Oates as private eye Chandler (1971), named after the novelist himself. Robert Mitchum played a period Marlowe in Farewell, My Lovely (1975) and The Big Sleep (1978). Robert Altman’s offbeat The Long Goodbye (1973) cast Elliott Gould as a down-at-heel, scruffy seventies Marlowe. Altman’s film was a precursor to the everyday threat and menace depicted in Roman Polanski’s Chinatown (1974), the foremost private eye movie of the decade, with Jack Nicholson as J.J. Gittes, investigating the Water and Power company. All these films included the usual noir touches – a femme fatale who hires the hero, the dark side of the human psyche, a mystery element – and added a post-modern knowingness to the proceedings; this is particularly true of The Long Goodbye, a film that upset many Chandler purists. The seventies also saw a vogue for thirties and forties vintage stories, with authentic period settings. These ranged from the children’s musical Bugsy Malone (1976), with Tommy-guns that fire gunk, to comedies such as Lucky Lady (1975). There were serious, brutal treatments such as The Grissom Gang (1971) and Thieves Like Us (1974 – a remake of They Live by Night – 1948), and violent crime biographies: A Bullet for Pretty Boy, Bloody Mama (both 1970), Dillinger (1973) and Big Bad Mama (1974). In France, Alain Delon became a big international star, via his retro gangster movie Borsalino (1970). The finest Italian crime film of the decade was Francesco\n\nMarlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone, with Robert Duvall as Tom Hagan, his consigliere (negotiator and adviser), in Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 hit The Godfather.\n\nxix\n\nxx\n\nCRIME WAVE\n\nRosi’s Cadaveri Eccellenti (1976 – Illustrious Corpses); based on Leonardo Sciascia’s 1971 novel ‘Il Conteso’ (retitled ‘Equal Danger’), with Lino Ventura playing Inspector Rogas, investigating a labyrinthine series of murders of the judiciary. Rosi also directed The Mattei Affair (1972) and Lucky Luciano (1973), topical, factbased scenarios that chimed with Italian audiences. The most reliable crime star of the seventies was Charles Bronson, whose films made a fortune worldwide. He was one of the top ten box-office stars from 1973–76; his highest ranking was 4th in 1975, beaten only by Robert Redford, Barbra Streisand and Al Pacino. He made films in many action genres, including several crime movies, often starring opposite his wife, Jill Ireland. The Valachi Papers (1972) was based on the real-life 1963 case of Joseph Valachi, Mafioso whistle-blower on the workings of the Mafia. Violent City (1970) was a tale of hitman revenge set in New Orleans, and Death Wish (1974) was the ultimate vigilante movie. Bronson also made Cold Sweat (1971), The Stone Killer (1973), Mr Majestyk (1974) and Breakout (1975). It is a safe assumption that, with Bronson in the title role, The Mechanic (1972 – UK title Killer of Killers) didn’t repair many cars; ‘mechanic’ is a slang term for hitman. With the arrival of Clint Eastwood’s cop movie Dirty Harry and Michael Caine’s Newcastle-set revenge thriller Get Carter, 1971 was a watershed year for crime movies. The same year Richard Roundtree starred as Shaft, opening the floodgates for the blaxpoitation explosion of black action heroes and heroines. Dirty Harry was also the epitome of a new breed of crime-busting rogue cops, heralded by the arrival of ‘Popeye’ Doyle, not on the trail of spinach, but heroin, in William Friedkin’s The French Connection (1971) and its sequel The French Connection II (1975). Badge 373 (1973) used the same source material as The French Connection. A variation of the formula saw Al Pacino as the eponymous unconventional cop in Serpico (1973), in the true story of an officer who tried to expose police corruption in the NYPD. There were several oddball seventies crime fads, such as the minor craze for ‘gang’ movies, after John Carpenter’s Assault on Precinct 13 (1976) and Walter Hill’s The Warriors (1979). Another craze was the backwood’s ‘moonshine’ cycle, which produced at least one cult movie, Burt Reynolds’s White Lightning (1973). Reynolds also kick-started the good-old-boy car chase series, with his immensely popular Smoky and the Bandit (1977), featuring much burning rubber, impressive stunts and colourful language, y’all.\n\nC R I M E WAV E 8 0 s\n\nIn the eighties, with cinema audiences on the wane, period gangster films were much less successful than their seventies’ counterparts had been. City Heat (1984 – uniting Clint Eastwood and Burt Reynolds), the troubled production of The Cotton Club (1984 – from the Godfather team of Robert Evans and Francis Ford\n\nCRIMINAL RECORD: AN INTRODUCTION TO CRIME MOVIES\n\nCoppola) and The Sicilian (1987 – with Christopher Lambert as Salvatore Giuliano) struggled at the box office. The ultimate retro gangster movie of the decade was Sergio Leone’s labyrinthine Once Upon a Time in America (1984), with its authentic art design and settings; unfortunately that too died at the US box office. By far the most satisfying period piece of the eighties was Brian De Palma’s no-nonsense The Untouchables (1987), which resurrected TV’s Eliot Ness, portrayed by Kevin Costner, and pitted him against Al Capone, played by Robert De Niro. This was a return to classic form for the genre, aided by Ennio Morricone’s powerful score and Sean Connery’s Oscar-winning supporting turn as Irish cop James Malone. Experts in their field, the Untouchables were a real organisation – nine agents who in the murky Prohibition-era Chicago police were incorruptible, or ‘untouchable’. Bad guys were well served in the eighties. Manhunter (1986 – also called Red Dragon) was the first in a series of serial killer investigations culminating in The Silence of the Lambs (1991), with Anthony Hopkins as Dr Hannibal ‘the Cannibal’ Lecter, who means what he says when he remarks, ‘I’m having a friend for dinner.’ Eighties law enforcers were popular too, be they futuristic mechanical policemen in multimillion-dollar productions, such as Robocop (1987), or bloodlaced B-movies, such as William Lustig’s Maniac Cop (1988). There were tough cops – Burt Reynolds in Sharky’s Machine (1981) – and hip loners, such as Eddie Murphy in Beverly Hills Cop (1984). Dirty Harry Callahan reappeared in Sudden Impact (1983) and The Dead Pool (1988). Vigilantism was as popular as ever with grim, flame-thrower-wielding Robert Ginty as The Exterminator (1980). Buddy cop movies were raised to an art form in the eighties. Crime-fighting teams were commonplace on TV, with literally dozens vying for popularity, including Starsky and Hutch, Charlie’s Angels, Cagney and Lacey, Miami Vice, The A-Team and Dempsey and Makepeace. On the big screen, we had cops teaming up with crooks – for example, Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte in 48 Hours (1982). Alternatively, there were cop pairings that were poles apart from one another. By far the most successful example is Lethal Weapon (1987), starring Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, initiating the most popular buddy cop screen partnership of recent years. The big crime biography of the decade was Brian De Palma’s remake of Howard Hawks’s Scarface, Shame of a Nation (1932). Adapted by Oliver Stone, De Palma’s film, retitled simply Scarface, cast Al Pacino as Tony Montana, a Cuban expat trying to make it in the USA, who rises to be a Miami drugs baron. The film looks great (it was photographed by John A. Alonzo from Chinatown) and Pacino crackles with tension, but the gloomy synthesiser score and downbeat, unsympathetic characters make the story heavy going, as does its infamously explicit violence. Scarface, in its uncut version, is probably the most violent crime film ever made. An early sequence sees Montana and three accomplices arriving at the apartment of a Colombian gang for a cocaine pick-up, but they are double-crossed. Their rival’s boss turns out to be anything but a mellow Colombian and revs up his chainsaw; much bloody action ensues. It is the finale that secures the film’s\n\nxxi\n\nxxii\n\nCRIME WAVE\n\nnotoriety. Ensconced in his luxury estate, with his own personal bodyguards, Montana waits. A rival drug gang infiltrates the compound and a blood-splattered pitched battle ensues, resembling Sam Peckinpah’s The Wild Bunch (1969). Montana takes on all comers with an automatic rifle until he is blasted with a shotgun. The finale of the original Scarface saw Tony Camonte (Paul Muni) dying near a travel sign reading ‘The World is Yours’; here, what’s left of riddled Montana swandives into his indoor ornamental pool, decorated with a garishly tasteless cod-Art Deco statue, with a globe motif reading ‘The World is Yours’. In France, there was a distinctively French resurgence of cop movies, called Policiers, with for example the phenomenally successful La Balance (1982), directed by ex-pat American Bob Swaim. But the protagonists are far from the stylishly dressed heroes of their influential sixties and seventies cousins; now they are scruffy cops in blue jeans, wearing Walkmans on their heads instead of Borsalinos. As well as Policiers, there was a new New Wave, including such films as Jean-Jacques Beneix’s opera-mystery Diva (1980) and Luc Besson’s cult Subway (1985), which were particularly popular in UK arthouses; the Subway poster joined Beatrice Dalle’s Betty Blue as a must-have on every student’s wall. There were many eighties parodies and crime-film comedies, but despite huge box-office grosses, they haven’t worn well. Police Academy arrived in 1984; its\n\n‘The World is Yours’: Al Pacino, as Tony Montana, in Brian De Palma’s controversial Scarface (1983).\n\nCRIMINAL RECORD: AN INTRODUCTION TO CRIME MOVIES\n\nmassive success inspired countless terrible sequels. Prizzi’s Honor and Wise Guys (both 1986) lampooned Mafia movies, Tough Guys (1986) saw two ageing gangsters (Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas) being released from prison after 30 years, into a world that is unrecognisable to them. Johnny Dangerously (1984) failed to parody Cagney’s The Public Enemy, Dragnet tried to ridicule old TV cop shows, while The Naked Gun began where the much funnier TV series Police Files left off, with Leslie Nielsen cast as Lt Frank Drebin, attempting to foil an assassination attempt on Queen Elizabeth during a royal visit to the US. Two sequels followed: The Naked Gun 2 –12 : The Smell of Fear (1991) and Naked Gun 33 –13 : The Final Insult (1994).\n\nC R I M E WAV E 9 0 s\n\nCrime movies in the nineties were dominated by two filmmakers: Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino. Scorsese, a native New Yorker, had made the highly influential Mean Streets in 1973 and returned to the streets with his masterpiece, GoodFellas (1990), followed by Casino (1995) and Gangs of New York (2002). Tarantino directed Reservoir Dogs in 1991, which caused a furore on its release in 1992. His non-stop mix of John Woo action, hip culture references, sharp dialogue and the nostalgic pop soundtrack immediately found an audience. The follow-up, Pulp Fiction (1994), won the Palme D’Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Tarantino also scripted Tony Scott’s lovers-on-the-run True Romance (1993) and Oliver Stone’s bloodfest Natural Born Killers (1994), which saw Mickey and Mallory Knox (Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis) promoted by the media as superstars. Both films marked an MTV-era re-evaluation of Bonnie and Clyde mythology. In the eighties frenetic Hong Kong crime films, directed by John Woo and Ringo Lam, gained massive cult popularity worldwide and made a star of Chow Yun Fat. In the nineties Woo made Hard Boiled (1992) in Hong Kong, then went to the US for Broken Arrow (1996), detailing the theft of a stealth bomber, and Face/Off (1997), one of the most bizarre Hollywood crime films of recent years. Here, FBI agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) tracks down Castor Troy (Nicholas Cage), who shot his son five years previously. During the manhunt they literally change faces, but in a psychological twist, they actually swap lives, with the cop trapped in prison at one point, unable to prove his identity. Crime biography took an interesting twist with the comic book Dick Tracy (1990), featuring heavily made-up actors as cartoon characters. It starred Warren Beatty as Tracy, Madonna as singer Breathless Mahoney and Al Pacino as gangster Big Boy Caprice. Beatty also appeared in Bugsy (1991), as the title gangster, Bugsy Siegel. In the UK, Ronnie and Reggie Kray got the big-screen gangster treatment with The Krays (1990), a tale of the terrifying London mobster brothers, played by Gary and Martin Kemp, from eighties ‘new romantics’ Spandau Ballet.\n\nxxiii\n\nxxiv\n\nCRIME WAVE\n\nThe nineties saw the release of Con Air (1997), an airborne reworking of Riot in Cell Block 11, and Walter Hill’s attempt at ‘Red Harvest’, Last Man Standing (1996). More interesting was the dark, claustrophobic atmosphere of Copland (1997), with Sylvester Stallone as a small-fry cop trying to swim with the big fish in the city, as corruption permeates; a strong cast included Harvey Keitel, Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta. Boyz ’N the Hood (1991) was The Public Enemy for the rap generation; in fact the most famous eighties rap act was named Public Enemy. Pacino followed the final instalment of the Godfather story, The Godfather Part III (1990), with Carlito’s Way (1993) and Donnie Brasco (1997). Carlito’s Way, another gangster biography directed by Scarface’s Brian De Palma, saw Pacino cast as seventies Puerto Rican mobster Carlito Brigante and Sean Penn as his lawyer, David Kleinfeld (wearing what appears to be an Art Garfunkle wig). Donnie Brasco (1997) was based on a true story; Johnny Depp is the title character, actually Joe Pistone, an undercover FBI man, who is taught the ways of the mob by Pacino’s Lefty Ruggiero. Undoubtedly the most anticipated crime pairing since Bonnie met Clyde saw Robert De Niro and Al Pacino sharing the bill in Michael Mann’s modern crime thriller Heat (1995 – a remake of his own TV movie, L.A. Takedown [1989]), filmed in an ultra-stylish, steely blue Los Angeles. Heat features the least subtle heist in crime movie history, with De Niro and company ramming an articulated lorry cab into the side of the targeted armoured car, which impacts with such force that the armoured car rolls onto its side. De Niro played Neil McCauley, a robber out for one last job; Pacino is his cop nemesis, Vincent Hanna, with a wife who is permanently stoned on grass and Prozac. Heat features many such personal problems: marriages break down, stepdaughters attempt suicide and families fracture. De Niro and Pacino share two scenes together: the central dialogue between McCauley and Hanna in a coffee shop, in which the pair grudgingly acknowledge mutual respect, and the final shootout near Los Angeles airport. Mann also stages an incredible firefight following a bungled bank robbery: Pacino and his heavily armed squad ambush McCauley and his three-man gang on the streets of Los Angeles; only McCauley and gang member Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer) escape. Pity the bystanders in this fiery exchange, as all the participants are wearing bulletproof vests. The heavy artillery on display in this machine-gun shootout and Mann’s fluid camerawork, taking the audience to the heart of the firestorm, seems part bullet-ridden First Blood, part jumpy Kennedy assassination footage – ‘criminal vérité’ for the nineties. Heat is enhanced by an eerie score, composed by Elliot Goldenthal and performed by the Kronos Quartet. The finest crime movie of the nineties was Curtis Hanson’s fifties period noir, L.A.Confidential (1997), an adaptation of James Ellroy’s terse, hard-boiled novel, which threw politics, tabloid journalism, celebrity, murder and corruption into the Los Angeles melting pot. There were also several blockbusting thrillers and their rolling sequels, which used hijacking and robbery in a broader action milieu,\n\nCRIMINAL RECORD: AN INTRODUCTION TO CRIME MOVIES\n\nincluding Die Hard (1988), Die Hard 2 (1990), Speed (1994), Die Hard With a Vengeance (1995), Mission: Impossible (1996), Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997) and Mission: Impossible 2 (2000). These films rely heavily on spectacular stunts and CGI special effects to engage the audience’s attention. For example, in Speed, a superior example of the genre, Keanu Reeves is pitted against extortionist Dennis Hopper, who demands a $3.7 million ransom from the city of Los Angeles. He has planted a bomb on a bus, which will detonate if the bus’s speed isn’t maintained at a steady 50 mph. Reeves and Sandra Bullock take the wheel for a nail-biting ride. European crime movies produced La Femme Nikita (1990), Luc Besson’s story of a female assassin. Besson’s US film, Leon (1994), saw hitman Jean Reno teaming up with 12-year-old Natalie Portman to gain revenge on the murderer of Portman’s father, a corrupt cop, played by Gary Oldman. In the UK there was renewed popularity in domestic crime movies, with the success of Guy Richie’s Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000). Lock, Stock mixed the brutality of Get Carter and the Cockney charm of The Italian Job, and even spawned a short-lived TV show, with episodes entitled ‘Lock, Stock and Four Stolen Hooves’ and ‘Lock, Stock and A Fistful of Jack and Jills’. Snatch was better, featuring protagonists with descriptive names such as Turkish, Frankie Four Fingers and Brick Top, in a tale of jewel heists and fixed boxing matches: ‘Stealing Stones and Breaking Bones’ ran the tagline. Richie has since followed this with the crime drama Revolver (2005).\n\nC R I M E WAV E : 2 1 s t - C E N T U RY C O P S\n\nEntering the new century, crime films continue to diversify. They keep surprising audiences with further twists and turns, proving how flexible, adaptable and recyclable the genre is. To take some disparate examples: Gone in 60 Seconds (2000) featured Nicholas Cage stealing cars, but like the high-octane remake of The Italian Job (2003), the film was running on empty. There was the easygoing charm of Steven Spielberg’s Catch Me if You Can (2002), with a con artist (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) chased by Tom Hanks’s resolute FBI man. Shane Black, the writer of Lethal Weapon, directed the neo-noir Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005), starring Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jnr, while the same year saw the release of Sin City (2005), a monochrome, violent comic strip noir starring Bruce Willis, Clive Owen and Mickey Rourke, and based on Frank Miller’s urban gothic work. Sexy Beast (2000) features a Ronnie Biggs-style British crook hiding out in Southern Spain. Here, Ray Winston’s sunbathing is interrupted by the arrival of Ben Kingsley, as Don Logan, possibly the most offensive and frightening British crook ever to appear in a crime movie; it is little wonder Winston suffers nightmares about being machine-gunned by an evil-looking giant rabbit.\n\nxxv\n\nxxvi\n\nCRIME WAVE\n\nThe Colombian/US co-production Maria Full of Grace (2004) saw the teenage Colombian heroine smuggling condoms full of heroin in her stomach. Steven Soderbergh’s Traffic (2000), based on a UK miniseries, looked at cocaine smuggling across the Mexican border; it won Soderbergh the Best Director Oscar. Soderbergh went on to direct Ocean’s Eleven (2001), one of the slickest heist movies of the genre. Other super-smart heist thrillers include the superior The Thomas Crown Affair (1999), which pitted the audience against some of the most intricate plotting in the history of cinema, a trend initiated by the brain-teasing The Usual Suspects (1995). Something of a step back for the genre, Chicago (2002) was a musical drama set in the twenties. Renee Zellweger appeared as Roxie Hart, with Catherine ZetaJones as Velma Kelly, a pair of cabaret singers mixed up in a murder case, based on a real incident. This film, with its authentic gangster milieu and production numbers, was inspired by mobster musicals set in the theatre, such as Broadway (1929), and sees the crime genre coming full circle. One of the best and most distinctive recent crime movies is City of God (2003 – originally called Cidade de Deus), directed by Fernando Meirelles. Set in Rio de Janeiro’s worst slum, cynically christened ‘City of God’, it tells the story of street gang violence and drug turf wars, which ravaged the city in the seventies. The main character is Winston Rodrigues, known as Rocket, a young man who dreams of being a photographer, a career that will allow him to escape the slums. His brother, a hood, is killed early in the film; his other contemporaries ‘get religion’ or work honestly, but most end up joining street gangs and being swept into crime. The most notorious and bloodthirsty of the gangstas is L’il Ze and his level-headed partner Bene, who sell drugs in town. Their only competition is ‘Carrot’, who teams up with Knockout Ned, a local hero, to stand up to L’il Ze. With stories entitled ‘The Story of the Tender Trio’, ‘Flirting with Crime’ and ‘The Story of Knockout Ned’, and Rocket’s voiceover narration, City of God looks back to ‘rise and fall’ crime biographies, such as The Public Enemy and GoodFellas, but in an original way, with its intense action, brothel robberies and drug dealing (all beautifully photographed by Casar Charlone). To offset the brutality, Meirelles also depicts the community’s flourishing nightlife, with sequences set in a vast nightclub pumping out James Brown tracks and ‘Kung Fu Fighting’, by Carl Douglas. The opening chicken chase scene is among the most arresting in modern cinema, as a mob of pistol-packing kids, the Runts, chase a hapless hen (making a bid for freedom) hell for leather through back street slums, only to round a corner and confront the police in a stand-off. City of God is breathtaking, but uncompromising; be warned: it is unlike any other crime film you will have seen. Crime movies have used many settings, from the slums of Rio, the terraces of Newcastle and the towering neon palaces of Las Vegas, to the streets of San Francisco, the back streets of Paris and the mean streets of New York. To begin the movie gangster’s story, we must look back to the thirsty thirties of Prohibition, when the public enemies first appeared, riding the crest of a crime wave…\n\nCRIME WAVE TOP TENS\n\nThe films, selected from international sources, are arranged in order of preference; director and original release year in parenthesis.

Powers’s final revenge for the death of his best friend, walking into the lions’ den with a pair of pistols and subsequently staggering into the gutter, bullet-ridden, muttering, ‘I ain’t so tough’, is far more effective than Edward G. Robinson’s reedy ‘Mother of God – is this the end of Rico?’ demise. Cagney is the movie gangster and The Public Enemy is a pivotal film, though it was not Cagney’s first contribution to the genre. James Cagney was born James Francis Cagney Jnr in New York in 1899; he grew up on the Lower East Side in Yorkville and knew very well the kind of upbringing and background that could ‘turn kids bad’. He worked in a variety of jobs, including boxing, but eventually joined a revue, finding his way into the chorus on Broadway in 1920 and from there graduated to lead roles. He appeared in the musical Penny Arcade and his first film appearance was recreating this role. Warners’ film version, spicily retitled Sinners’ Holiday (1930), was a carnival romance between a barker and a penny arcade girl. Bit-parts for Cagney followed – his next film was Doorway to Hell (1930 – released as the much lighter-sounding A Handful of Clouds in the UK), a topical tale of bootleggers, released a month before Little Caesar changed the gangster movie map. Lew Ayres starred as the kingpin, with Cagney as his henchman. Cagney also made Other Men’s Women (1931 – a railroad drama) and The Millionaire (1931 – Cagney’s first comedy), before screen-testing for the role of Matt Doyle in The Public Enemy. Young actor Edward Woods was to play the lead, Tom Powers, but almost immediately director William A. Wellman realised the actors were in the wrong roles and reversed them. The casting swap of Cagney and Woods is most apparent with the two young actors who were chosen to play Tom and Matt as children. Frankie Darro (as Matt) is a dead ringer for a young Cagney, while Frank Coglan Jnr (as Tom) closely resembles Woods. The Public Enemy was based on the novelette ‘Beer and Blood’ by Baltimoreborn John Bright, who had been a crime reporter in Chicago, the setting for his story. Bright’s unauthorised biography of Chicago’s mayor, ‘Hizzoner Big Bill Thomson’, led to him being sued by the mayor. The Public Enemy was his first film script. He wrote it with Kubec Glasmon, a Polish-born pharmacist, who became his writing partner at Warners, with the novel’s dialogue adapted by Harvey Thew. In the story, Tom Powers and Matt Doyle grow up together in Chicago. As slum urchins they fall into petty crime and when they grow up become involved with a small-timer named Putty Nose, who convinces them to take part in a robbery on the Northwestern Fur Trading Company. The job is a mess and in making their escape, Tom kills a policeman. Putty Nose vanishes and leaves Tom and Matt to face the music. The pair become involved with Irish racketeer Paddy Ryan, a bootlegger and liquor-runner, who is in business with Nails Nathan, a dapper mobster from ‘the West Side’. Tom and Matt rise through the ranks of racketeers\n\n‘I AIN’T SO TOUGH”\n\nand become rich and notorious (when they catch up with Putty Nose, Tom executes him); all the while, Tom tells his mother that he is working in local politics, until his disapproving elder brother Mike discovers otherwise. Nails Nathan is killed in a freak riding accident and rival ‘Schemer’ Burns and his mobsters try to muscle in on his turf. In an ambush, Matt is machine-gunned down and Tom goes looking for revenge, attacking Burns’s headquarters and killing the kingpin, but getting badly injured. While he recovers in hospital, Tom is kidnapped by the Burns faction; one night, as his mother prepares the bed for his homecoming, his brother answers the door and Tom’s trussed-up corpse flops face down into the hallway. The Great American Depression of the thirties, with falling output and massive unemployment (at some points 33 per cent of the population), coincided with the new vogue for gangster movies, spearheaded by Warner Brothers’ Studio. The recent advent of sound meant that you could hear screeching wheels, approaching sirens and Thomson Submachine-gun fire and the wisecracking, quick-fire dialogue crackled with menace. When The Public Enemy was made, the US was still under the rules of the Volstead Prohibition (1920–1933) and the protagonists’ activities were remarkably contemporary. Jack Warner liked to make films that had\n\nEarly thirties Warners promotional portrait, published in the Picturegoer series, of fresh-faced James Cagney: Public Enemy Number One.\n\n3\n\n4\n\nCRIME WAVE\n\ncontemporary social thrust. The Prohibition act outlawed the manufacture, distribution or retail of alcohol. This led to bootlegging, or ‘alky-cooking’, as depicted in The Public Enemy, where organised crime, financed by illegal booze, resulted in inter-gang rivalry and turf wars (a bootlegger was originally a wild-west term referring to the way traders carried bottles of firewater in their boots to sell to the Indians). The Public Enemy is set between 1909 and 1920. The date captions include 1915 (the year of the fur heist), wartime 1917 (the US declaration and Mike enlisting in the Marines) and the Prohibition scenes in 1920, which begin with a sign in the Family Liquor Store – ‘Owing to prohibition, our entire stock must be sold by midnight’ – prompting a stampede by the locals to fill every available vessel with ‘hooch’. Director William Augustus Wellman had previously made the silent World War I film Wings, which won the very first Best Picture Academy Award in 1927 (it was re-released in 1929 with sound). In The Public Enemy Wellman cast Liverpudlian Leslie Fenton as spruce gangster Nails Nathan; Fenton himself later became a director in the fifties. Mae Clarke, who in the most famous scene in the film has a grapefruit thrust in her face, also appeared in James Whales’s Frankenstein (1931), as Henry Frankenstein’s fiancée, Elizabeth. Errol Flynn lookalike Edward Woods, the victim of Cagney’s promotion to leading man, was only appearing in his second film (his debut had been in Mother’s Cry – 1930) and his film career was shortlived. By contrast, Joan Blondell, as Matt’s girl Mamie, had appeared with Cagney in Sinners’ Holiday (her Warners’ debut) and Other Men’s Women, and was one of the most popular and prolific actresses of the era. The most famous of Cagney’s co-stars was Jean Harlow, the original platinum blonde screen goddess, who had caused a stir in Hell’s Angels (1930) – her looks were so influential that the two movies she made after The Public Enemy were Goldie and Platinum Blonde (both 1931). She died tragically in 1937, aged 26, of a cerebral oedema (fluid on the brain), but her iconic impact was immense. In 1928, Warners had bought the Stanley Corporation of America, owner of 250 cinemas across the US, and First National, another chain. The Public Enemy was filmed at Warner Bros’ Studios between January and February 1931; Vitaphone’s involvement was the relatively current sound-mixing elements and the Vitaphone Orchestra, conducted by David Mendoza, recorded the score. The Warners’ Studios had formerly been First National Studios, which had been wired for sound in 1928. The Public Enemy features several authentic street-scene sets (with drays piled with kegs, a Salvation Army band and kids on the sidewalk swigging beer) and some stock location footage of railways, cattle pens and thriving streets choked with trams, automobiles, horse-drawn carriages and pedestrians. Interiors accurately evoked the era, with one sign in a spit-and-sawdust social club warning: ‘Don’t Spit On the Floor!’ During the making of the film, Cagney had a near miss during a machine-gun ambush; real bullets peppered the cornerstone of a building and one almost hit the\n\n‘I AIN’T SO TOUGH”\n\nactor (a hazard of filmmaking that recurred in Angels With Dirty Faces). The scene when Cagney pushes a grapefruit into Mae Clarke’s face, after she accuses him of being unfaithful, was based on a real-life incident involving Chicago gangster Hymie Weiss, who used an omelette. On set it was decided that a grapefruit would be a good substitute. There are three versions of how the scene was filmed. Initially Cagney was going to throw it, but Wellman and Cagney changed their minds when Clarke would only allow them one take. Alternatively, Clarke had a cold and wanted to fake the shot with a stand-in, but the director insisted they do it for real, much to Clarke’s displeasure. Finally, the most widely believed and plausible version was that Clarke and Cagney were larking around on set and the scene was never meant to appear in the finished film. A brief foreword introduces the film’s moral stance on ‘the evils associated with prohibition’. Following the titles (accompanied by a staccato march arrangement of the standard ‘I’m Forever Blowing Bubbles’) we are introduced to each character, captioned with their character names: Tom mimes a punch (a gesture he repeats throughout the film) and Matt wipes his nose on his sleeve (his trademark, presumably in a joking effort to ‘keep it clean’). Another caption then says the film is about to ‘honestly depict an environment that exists today in a certain strata of American life’, rather than ‘glorify the hoodlum or the criminal’. In the US, the Hayes Code was introduced in 1930, which led to much more stringent censorship restrictions; until then films were covered by a simple do’s and don’ts outline. Under the new guidelines, The Public Enemy, without such a disclaimer, would have clearly breached the code. Playing safe, Warner Brothers Pictures claim that the story is true, but ‘all names and characters appearing therein are purely fictional’. Many of the film’s events were based on Charles Dion ‘Deannie’ O’Banion, an Irish Catholic mobster, and his gang, the Irish North Siders in Chicago (O’Banion was executed in classic gangland fashion in his florist’s shop, when a rival mobster’s men called in to collect a specially ordered wreath). In The Public Enemy, the brutal scene when Tom Powers shoots Rajah, the horse that kicked Nails Nathan in the head, is inspired by a true incident from the career of Louis ‘Two Gun’ Altieri, an O’Banion hoodlum. Nails Nathan was based on Samuel J. ‘Nails’ Morton; Morton was killed when his horse threw him and trampled him to death. Altieri, plus three other O’Banion men, kidnapped the horse, took it to the scene of the accident and shot it dead in revenge. The central relationship between Tom and Matt, from teens to tombstone, is well delineated by Cagney and Woods. They begin as kids, having a crafty swig of beer on the street outside a saloon and with petty pilfering from department stores, but with maturity comes responsibility and far more serious crimes. The fur robbery is scotched by edgy Tom taking a shot at a stuffed bear caught in the torchlight. The shot alerts the police, who shoot the getaway driver, Lippy Larry. As they escape, Tom commits his first murder, with a Smith and Wesson given to him by Putty Nose – an exploitative and untrustworthy fence who even tried to\n\n5\n\n6\n\nCRIME WAVE\n\nswindle them when they were kids. As Tom notes later, ‘You taught us how to cheat, steal and kill…If it hadn’t been for you, we might’ve been on the level.’ Following the fur robbery, Larry’s wake is a poignant moment that sees sheepish Tom and Matt introduced as ‘some of Larry’s nicer friends’, while elder relatives tut that Larry was ‘a no-good boy’. Prompted by alcohol being sold for $30 a gallon, they begin in the illicit liquor trade. Working for Irish bootlegger Paddy Ryan, they set up a brewing company (Lehman’s) with Nails Nathan and his pack of hoods, making sure that local pubs and saloons ‘buy our beer or they don’t buy any beer’. Tom and Matt are the ‘trouble squad’, the muscle, threatening bartenders that if they don’t comply, they will drop by and ‘kick your teeth out, one at a time’. Their first foray into bootleg robbery is one of the film’s highlights. Having cased the layout while working as deliverymen, the gang arrives at the booze warehouse in a tanker truck marked GASOLINE. Two cohorts pose as telegraph men and climb into the building, put taps on the storage kegs and syphon the beer into the tanker with a length of hosepipe. Tom’s relationship with women (his mother excepted) and the awkwardness of the romantic scenes are The Public Enemy’s biggest failing. Apart from his grapefruità-tête with Kitty, Tom’s snappy dating technique sees him uttering the immortal lines, ‘Hello baby, you’re a swell dish – I think I’m going to go for you!’ with his ‘date’ seemingly having little say in the matter. His relationship with Harlow, as out-of-town Texan ‘merry-go-round’ Gwen, is more complicated, but he certainly isn’t in love, and she eventually decides to skip town. By contrast, Matt and Mamie get married; ‘Matt’s decided to take something lawful…a wife,’ jokes Nails. But the night of their celebration is the night they run into Putty Nose again and the party is forestalled. It seems the bond between the two men is the singularly most important factor in their lives. As the voice of the film’s moral stance, so as not to make The Public Enemy too attractive to moviegoers deprived of drink and low on cash, Wellman has Tom’s brother Mike. Their father is a police officer, but even when they were kids it was Tom to whom he had to ‘give the strap’. As adults, with their father dead, Mike discovers Tom’s nefarious activities from policeman Pat Burke and refuses any kindness from his brother; even a keg at Mike’s homecoming from the war is described as being filled with ‘beer and blood’. Later, Tom brings his family some money, but Mike has other ideas – ‘Get an earful of this: that money’s blood money and we want no part of it.’ Tom says money is valueless to him (which suggests he does his job for enjoyment). His brother answers, ‘With no heart and no brains it’s all you’ve got…you’ll need it.’ Unfortunately this is not an entirely convincing argument: Mike works as a ‘ding-ding’ on tramcars, joins the war-bound Marines, comes back a shaking wreck and goes to night school (in Tom’s words, ‘learning how to be poor’). Tom meanwhile drinks beer and champagne throughout the decade-long drought, gets the girls, dances in tuxedos and drives the largest convertible ever seen on film. But his brother’s pontificating is shown to be moral,\n\n7\n\n‘I AIN’T SO TOUGH”\n\nwhen Tom’s corpse is delivered to their doorstep, trussed up with rope, still in the hospital blanket and bloodied head bandage: mummified and ready for entombment. In the background, a gramophone plays ‘I’m Forever Blowing Bubbles’, then reaches the repetitive click of the endless run-out groove. We don’t actually see Tom’s death, and for a film that is so black-hearted, there is surprisingly little on-screen violence perpetrated by the Public Enemy. Wellman keeps the most graphic instants of death to the narrative margins, supplying all we need to know from actors’ reactions to events off-screen. When Tom finds out Putty has run out on them, he whines: ‘Why that dirty, no good yellow-bellied stool…I’m gonna give it that Putty Nose right in the head, first time I see him.’ When Tom and Matt do catch up with him, Putty tries to rekindle their friendship with a sense of nostalgia; he even plays a song from the good old days in the Red Oaks Social Club. As the camera follows Matt to the door, Tom shoots Putty offscreen; our only indication of the events are a gunshot and a discordant piano crescendo as Putty slumps on the keyboard. The more conventional action scenes, like the moment Ryan’s premises are obliterated by grenades tossed from Burns’s speeding cars, offset the crueller elements of the film and reinforce its authenticity. Though some of the tough-guy\n\nRise and Fall: Tom (James Cagney) and Gwen (Jean Harlow) living the high life in William A. Wellman’s The Public Enemy (1931).\n\n8\n\nCRIME WAVE\n\nlanguage has dated badly (‘Are you looking for a smack on the button?’/‘Four pineapples tossed at us in three days’), the list of brutality is potent, especially for a film of 1931. Any film that can boast a protagonist who shoots people in the back, kills cops, lies to his mother, threatens bartenders, hits women and shoots a racehorse is violent fare for any era. Cagney was so effective in his portrayal of Tom Powers that by 1933 the Production Code Authority stated that gangsters should not be idolised or glamorised in the cinema; in 1935 Cagney himself made G-Men, starring as a gangbusting government agent, to redress the balance. Tom is a cocky, grinning punk, who bullies the opposition and, until the final gun battle, always wins – unfair and square. The baby-faced gangster is turned by Cagney’s gracefulness and élan into an angelic killer, for whom we almost feel sympathy in the dénouement; in one extraordinary moment the ex-dancer executes a light-footed pirouette, with a couple of half-skips thrown in, as he gets back in his car after chatting up Gwen. Later, at the ambush, the image of him standing in the lashing rain, waiting for Schemer Burns’s mob to arrive at their ‘front’, the ‘Western Chemical Company’, is one of the film’s most effective. Tom can hardly contain his loathing, Cagney’s face sneering and twitchy, overcome with hatred and a feral instinct for revenge; just like when they were kids, when he was described as ‘the meanest boy in town’. As the rival mob emerge from two cars and file in, Tom purposefully walks across the street, hands on pistols in his jacket pockets, collar up, hat low, and bursts in, unleashing his vitriol in a fusillade of shots. A moment later he emerges; in the background, screams and moans from Burns’s crew follow in his wake. No more the angel, he staggers, bloody and drenched. Tom throws both his pistols through the shop windows and collapses in the gutter with the realisation ‘I ain’t so tough…’ A final epilogue sternly gives the audience something to think about on the way home: ‘The end of Tom Powers is the end of every hoodlum. The Public Enemy is not a man, nor is it a character – it is a problem that sooner or later, WE, the public, must solve!’ No wonder it was called the Great Depression. The Public Enemy was released in 1931. The trailer simply featured a pistol firing directly at the screen, with the slogan ‘A few scenes cannot do justice to the most powerful picture of the year’. Posters depicted Harlow and Cagney embracing, or Cagney brandishing a pistol, with the effective tagline ‘The Killer-Boss who Riddled, Roared and Terror-reigned his way across the DECADE OF DEATH’. For her prominent deployment in the publicity, Harlow is actually only on screen for three scenes. The film was condemned for its violence; even if most of it happens off-screen, the savage implication is clear. Picture Play called the film ‘a grim and terrible document, with no attempt to soften or humanise the character. Of all racketeer films it is the most brutal and least like movie fiction. For this reason it is the most arresting.’ Time magazine reckoned the film’s intensity was ‘relieved by scenes of the central characters slugging bartenders and slapping their women across the face. US audiences, long trained by the press to glorify thugs,\n\n‘I AIN’T SO TOUGH”\n\nlast week laughed loudly at such comedy and sat spellbound through the serious parts.’ Of the finale Time noted that it ‘carries to its ultimate absurdity the fashion for romanticising gangsters, for even in defeat the public enemy is endowed with grandeur’. It was a huge hit in the US, even though Warner Bros were currently operating at a net loss of $7,918,604 – but it was the Depression and the studio did not begin to show a profit until 1935. The original US print distributed ran 96 minutes, but all subsequent releases have been 84; TV prints from the seventies list the running time as 90 minutes. When it went for its general release in Britain, self-censorship was rife and the film was refused a certificate. In a famous case, Beckenham Council had its own film censorship board in the early thirties and banned nine films, including Paul Muni’s Scarface and The Public Enemy. The latter was after the grapefruit scene had already been removed by the British censors; in another example, a moral-minded Cornish borough council took it upon itself to ban films throughout the decade, even though it didn’t have a single cinema. The Public Enemy was retitled Enemies of the Public for the UK, broadening the focus to Tom and Matt, and their attendant mobsters’ rogues gallery. Everywhere else the film was known by literal translations of its title: Nemico Publico in Italy; Der Öffentliche Feind in Germany. Glasmon and Bright were nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Story for their work on The Public Enemy (John Monk Sanders won for The Dawn Patrol). They worked at Warners for the next few years and wrote several Cagney vehicles: Smart Money (1931); Blonde Crazy (1931 – with Cagney and Blondell as con artists masquerading as a bellhop and a maid); The Crowd Roars (1932 – Howard Hawks’s motor racing drama) and Taxi! (1932). In 1933 Bright and Glasmon were two of the founders of the Screen Writers Guild and Bright was later blacklisted by the House of Un-American Activities. Bright also collaborated again with Harvey Thew; their greatest success was adapting ‘Diamond Lil’ to the screen for Mae West at Paramount as She Done Him Wrong (1933); made for $200,000 in 18 days, it grossed $3 million. With the runaway success of Little Caesar and The Public Enemy, Robinson and Cagney were teamed in their next movie, the mediocre Smart Money (1931), with Robinson as a barber with a sideline in gambling and Cagney as his sidekick. The film also featured Boris Karloff, and was a massive success; it was the only time the two gangster greats co-starred together. In 1931, Cagney was on $450 a week, according to his Warners’ contract. Shortly after the success of The Public Enemy he refused to work until it was revised: this resulted in a new five-year, $1000-aweek deal. In an indication of his power, Cagney pulled the same stunt in 1932. He lobbied for even more money, finally winning his case and earning $1,750 per week. Cagney’s output throughout the thirties was generally average in quality, but he remained popular; typical was the boxing saga The Irish in Us (1935). He made Lady Killer (1933), which reunited him with Mae Clarke and Leslie Fenton from The Public Enemy, and parodied his tough-guy image. In Taxi (1932) Cagney\n\n9\n\n10\n\nCRIME WAVE\n\nuttered his most famous line, a favourite with Cagney impersonators, and anyone who narrowed their eyes, clenched their teeth and whined, ‘Come out and take it…you dirty rat’. One legacy of The Public Enemy was that Cagney never again had to buy a grapefruit – every time he walked into a restaurant, someone would send one over. Although Cagney worked hard, and even played a good guy in the highly successful G-Men (1935 – by which time he had hiked his salary up to $4,500 per week), it was seven years before Cagney made a film to equal The Public Enemy’s impact, and for that role he would once more have to play an angel with a dirty face.\n\n2 ‘Just rushing towards death’ — High Sierra (1941)\n\nCredits: DIRECTOR – Raoul Walsh EXECUTIVE PRODUCER – Hal B.

Roy Earle, a lifer, wins a pardon and is released from Mossmore Prison, Chicago, but finds that he is out of step with the times. He visits Jake Kranmer, an ex-cop, who informs him that he has been sprung from prison by his old boss, Big Mac, who has him earmarked for a job. Earle travels out to Shaw’s Camp, a fishing resort in the High Sierras of California, and meets the gang: drinker ‘Babe’ Kozak, jumpy ‘Red’ Hattery and Marie, a refugee from LA who is tagging along with the duo. Earle discovers that they are to knock over the strong boxes in the luxury Tropico Hotel Resort, which at the height of the horseracing season will be brimming with diamonds. Their insider will be Louis Mendoza, who works at the hotel. When the gang carry out the job, they clear the boxes, but Earle shoots a cop and they flee in two cars; the one carrying Red, Babe and Mendoza careers off the road and only Mendoza survives. On the run with the diamonds, Earle and Marie find that Big Mac has died and Kranmer is a turncoat, so Earle kills him – but is wounded in the process. While waiting for the fence to sell on the diamonds, Mendoza squeals, so Earle puts Marie on a bus to safety. With roadblocks springing up across the region, Earle is chased by the police back into the sierras, but a closed road forces him to abandon his car. He hides out in the mountains but is trapped; Marie hears the news on the radio and goes to the siege, in time to see Earle killed by a sniper. Woven into the story is a subplot revealing a completely different side to Earle. On his way to Shaw’s Camp, he meets a couple and their granddaughter Velma travelling to LA. Earle becomes attached to Velma, who has a club foot. Once in LA, Earle pays for an operation to have her ankle corrected, and asks her to marry him, but she tells him she is in love with Lon, from back east, humiliating Earle and destroying what little faith he has in human nature. Toupee-wearing, 41-year-old Humphrey De Forest Bogart had appeared in many movies throughout the thirties, usually in a supporting role, and mostly in gangster flicks. Warners cast him in The Petrified Forest (1936) as ‘Duke’ Mantee, a killer on the loose from prison, and it proved to be his breakthrough role. He also appeared in Bullets or Ballots (1936), with Edward G. Robinson as a cop who pretends to be disgraced and infiltrates the underworld. Between 1936 and 1940, Bogart made 28 films; because of his contract he was seldom given a choice as to which assignments he took, which explains his awful appearance as the black-clad bandit Whip McCord in the western The Oklahoma Kid (1939), with James Cagney. Bogart had to deliver lines such as ‘Fork over dem moneybags’ and recalled that his co-star’s large white hat made him look like ‘a mushroom’. He also appeared with Cagney in the documentary-styled The Roaring Twenties (1939) and as the\n\n‘JUST RUSHING TOWARDS DEATH’\n\ntruck driver brother of George Raft in They Drive by Night (1940 – The Road to Frisco in the UK), both for director Raoul Walsh. Bogart tended to get lead roles turned down by other actors and High Sierra was no exception. The role of Earle was offered to Warners’ crime greats – Muni, Cagney and Robinson – but they all refused. Raft passed because he didn’t want to die at the end, so the role was Bogart’s. One-eyed Raoul Walsh had started as an actor and assistant to D.W. Griffith, appearing as assassin John Wilkes Booth in The Birth of a Nation (1915). Working at Warners from 1939 to 1951, he made some of their most famous films of the time, including The Thief of Bagdad (1924) starring Douglas Fairbanks and The Big Trail (1930) with John Wayne. He would later work with Errol Flynn (They Died with Their Boots On and Objective Burma!) and made the gangster classic White Heat with Cagney in 1949. Opposite Bogart, Walsh cast Ida Lupino, a striking actress and powerful screen presence, who had reproachful eyes and a sense of inner sadness that defined her screen persona. The pair had just appeared together in the successful They Drive\n\nMad Dog Earle: Humphrey Bogart in John Huston’s High Sierra (1941).\n\n13\n\n14\n\nCRIME WAVE\n\nby Night; Lupino played the wife of a trucking baron in love with Raft, whose brother (Bogart) loses his arm in an accident. Born in London and trained at RADA, Lupino had made her film debut aged 15 in Her First Affaire (1933), a Lolita-type role for which her actress mother, Connie Emerald, had also been in the running. In Hollywood from 1934 on contract at Paramount, she was signed by Warners in 1940, but found herself typecast as molls and villains. Of Marie in High Sierra, Lupino said, ‘It was a damn good role…Bogart was a killer and no good and I was in love with him. Perfectly normal and natural for us.’ Imposing former male model Alan Curtis played thuggish ‘Babe’ Kozak. Arthur Kennedy, as ‘Red’ Hattery, was brought to Hollywood by James Cagney, to star in City for Conquest (1940) as Cagney’s sensitive brother; High Sierra was only his second film, but he went on to make movies for the next five decades. Joan Leslie debuted on stage aged nine, and made several films in her teens under her real name of Joan Brodel. In 1941 she was signed by Warner Bros, and her role as selfish Velma in High Sierra was her contract debut. For High Sierra, Cornel Wilde was also on contract at Warners, but was constantly typecast as a heavy; he later left for 20th Century Fox and comparative fame, playing the lead in several successful pictures, including the cult crime classic The Big Combo (1955). Willie Best, as Algernon, had made a series of unfunny comedies under the derogatory stage name ‘Sleep ’n Eat’ and his sketchy portrayal in High Sierra did little to improve role models for black actors in Hollywood in the thirties and forties. Henry Hull, as ‘Doc’ Banton, was a reliable character actor, who appeared in The Werewolf of London (1935), Jesse James (1939), The Return of Frank James (1940) and later Hitchcock’s Lifeboat (1944) and Objective Burma! (1945). The crisp script was written by Burnett in collaboration with John Huston, who struck up a friendship with Bogart on set during the film’s making. Warners allotted the film a modest $455,000 budget. They Drive by Night, Bogart and Lupino’s previous film, was budgeted at $500,000. Filming began on 5 August 1940. The desert and car chase sequences were shot in the Alabama Hills, around Lone Pine, California; the area in the vicinity of Lone Pine and Independence was a popular location for shooting westerns. The ‘Tropico Hotel Resort’ was the Arrowhead Springs Hotel in San Bernardino (near Lake Arrowhead). Other scenes were shot at Warner Brothers Studios, Burbank; Stage 19 at Warners was transformed into the Tropico Hotel lobby for the robbery scene. Shaw’s Camp was filmed on location, with cabin interiors at Warners. For the climax of the film the crew travelled to the High Sierra region of east-central California, to shoot the location scenes around Mount Whitney (then the highest peak in the US). The crew’s equipment had to be brought in on horses and packmules. Stuntman Buster Wiles played both the dying Roy Earle (plummeting down the slope) and Slim, the sniper who kills him. Bogart was irascible on location and Walsh dubbed him ‘Bogie the Beefer’. After a 44-day shoot, the film wrapped in September. Some sources claim that ‘Mad Dog’ Roy Earle was based on a real-life member of the Dillinger gang. In Burnett’s book, he’s named Roy Earldon and Dillinger is\n\n‘JUST RUSHING TOWARDS DEATH’\n\nname-checked in the film. Earle is probably the unluckiest gangster of all time. The robbery fails because of his cohorts’ inexperience; as Earle says, ‘Small-timers for small jobs…this one was just too big.’ Earle falls in love with a girl who doesn’t love him, finances her corrective surgery and then watches her selfishly run off with someone else. To Earle she’s ‘pretty…and decent’, but he’s only half right. Earle’s gang – which he’s presented with, rather than chooses – are a bunch of ‘jitterbugs’, nervous and inexperienced. Babe is a drunken bruiser with a temper, Red is jumpy but keen and Mendoza is the one most likely to foul up. Earle doesn’t like him at all: ‘The cops’ll punch him and he’ll sing’ – and of course he does. The gang are honoured to be in such ‘fast company’, but the reality is they’re out of their depth. As ‘Doc’ Banton, himself a crook, now involved in ‘the health racket’, notes of Earle, ‘You may catch lead any minute.’ There aren’t many of the ‘old bunch’ left (at least the good ones) and Earle himself concedes: ‘All the A-one guys are gone…dead or in Alcatraz.’ Even Big Mac, the brains behind the operation, is worn out and dying, ‘like a kid’s toy that’s running down’. This sense of the end of the great gangsters is unusually melancholic for a genre piece, a melancholy that resonates in the film’s finale. The robbery itself is well handled by Walsh, with Huston and Burnett’s hardboiled dialogue adding to the planning and execution of the heist, and the subsequent manhunt. They hear there are ‘plenty of rocks in the strongbox’ and Earle calmly cases the joint with a tennis racket tucked under his arm, rather than a machine-gun (which he keeps hidden, according to genre convention, in a violin case). Later Big Mac is found ‘cold as a mackerel’ and Earle goes on the run. The frantic car chase into the sierras is an action highlight, with the dusty convoy of police motorbikes and squad cars zooming though the desert and up winding mountain hairpins, captured by Walsh’s 360-degree pivoting camera. For these pursuit scenes, the camera was under-cranked, to increase the speed of the vehicles, with the rapidly swirling dust a give-away. The final stand-off beneath Mount Whitney is presented as a media circus, with the cops and sharpshooters mingling with hyperbolic newsmen; ‘One is awestruck by the gruesomeness of this rendezvous with death,’ says one announcer. Nearly out of ammo, Earle hunkers down behind the rocks, while the law sends Slim, a sniper with a high-powered rifle and telescopic sight, to manoeuvre behind the fugitive. When Marie refuses to help the police negotiate a surrender, Pard, their dog, hears Earle’s voice and scurries up the mountain. Seeing the dog, Earle rushes out looking for Marie and allows the sniper a shot at his back. Newspaper headlines have christened Earle ‘Mad Dog’; over his corpse, a bystander sneers, ‘Big-shot Earle…he ain’t much now is he?’ He’s a tough man and a killer, and killers must be seen to pay. The ending, with sobbing Marie carrying Pard towards the camera, is pure melodrama, but is very effective nonetheless. But it is this wistfully sentimental aspect of the film, and of Earle’s personality in particular, where the film really scores, and where Huston’s involvement is most\n\n15\n\n16\n\nCRIME WAVE\n\nprevalent. Bogart could sleepwalk through performances as a cold-blooded convict and bank robber, but to colour his portrayal of Earle to elicit sympathy for ‘Mad Dog’ was impressive. There are references to Earle’s childhood as a farm boy in Indiana; on his way to the sierras, he nostalgically visits his old house, as though he senses that time is running out. Earle’s first action when he gets out of prison is to go to the park and reassure himself that nothing has changed in the outside world. But Earle is kidding himself: the world is very different. While he sits in the park, a discarded newspaper tells us who this character really is: ‘Desperado Released – Roy Earle, Famous Indiana Bank Robber, Wins Pardon’. Earle’s sympathetic relationship with club-footed Velma would have been unthinkable in earlier Bogart incarnations. She knows him as ‘Roy Collins’, staying ‘up in the mountains for my health’. Perhaps because of his duplicity, their relationship is doomed. For his kindness in paying $400 for her operation, her grandfather says that Roy is ‘The best man who ever lived’, but ‘Doc’ Banton, quoting Dillinger, notes that men like Earle are ‘just rushing toward death’. Earle and Velma are completely mismatched. She has a sweetheart back home named Lon and as soon as she is well, she is seen in gaudy dress and makeup. She wants to ‘live a little’ and is soon to marry Lon. ‘That’s swell,’ says Roy with a face like thunder. These and other scenes in the film show Earle for the ‘sap’ he is – too trusting of human nature and equally resentful when he is treated untrustworthily. Marie is his salvation and soulmate. During the making of the film, Bogart said to Lupino, ‘You and I were born to be bad, but we’re really saints, Ida’; Lupino replied: ‘Who? You and me? Impossible! The halos wouldn’t fit…our horns would be enormous!’ Earle’s relationship with Marie starts off on the wrong foot. Warily, he doesn’t want her as part of the gang, but gradually she, and Pard, the stray mutt she adopts, become a surrogate family to Earle – Pard’s ‘got no home, got nobody’ either. As they set off on the robbery Pard follows them and Marie pleads that he be allowed to come along. ‘Of all the 14-carat saps,’ says Earle, ‘starting out on a caper with a woman and a dog.’ But he grows to like her, especially after his treatment by Velma, and later, he places one of the rings stolen from the Tropico on the little finger of Marie’s left hand; a gesture that reduces her to tears of joy: ‘Of course, you would put it on the wrong finger,’ she fusses. There was a rumour around Shaw’s Camp that Pard was bad luck. Earle and Marie initially laugh off such suggestions, but the way events unfold they begin to suspect they are indeed jinxed, Earle finally rattily conceding, ‘OK, it’s all Pard’s fault.’ Bogart’s own dog Zero played Pard. In the final scene, Earle’s riddled corpse is played by stuntman Buster Wiles, with cookies hidden in his palm, so the dog licks the dead man’s hand. Finally, as Earle has ‘crashed out’ and is free, the dog remains by his master, a silent goodbye – and Marie, in tears, loves him too. Prior to High Sierra’s release, the stars’ billing was reversed. Bogart was originally to have received top billing, but Lupino was promoted by the studio – Bogart, who took the project partly because it was his first starring role, wasn’t very\n\n17\n\n‘JUST RUSHING TOWARDS DEATH’\n\nimpressed. High Sierra was premiered in the US on 21 January 1941 and put on general release the following week. The poster was an exciting depiction of the mountaintop shootout, with the line ‘He killed…and there on the crest of Sierra’s Highest Crag…He Must Be Killed!’ Reviewers were gushing; the Motion Picture Herald noted that ‘By painting a character with streaks of white which do not dilute the black, Huston and Burnett drive home their point with power and conviction’. The New York Times said the film had ‘Speed, excitement, suspense and that ennobling suggestion of futility that makes for irony and pity’. Less seriously, the New Republic noted: ‘This is what I should call a film worth exposing negative for…like it or not, I’ll be damned if you leave before the end or go to sleep’. As part of the film’s promotion, Bogart and his wife Mayo (known as ‘the Battling Bogarts’) undertook two weeks’ worth of lucrative public appearances at Warners’ prestigious first-run cinema, the Strand. A stage show review followed each evening’s showing of High Sierra, with other performers including the stars of TV’s Ozzie and Harriet and an Egyptian magician called Galli Galli. The film was a huge success in the US, but still didn’t gross as well as Raft’s and Cagney’s films, which irked Bogart. In the UK, it was rated an A. The film was renamed throughout\n\nWarners Bros’ publicity still of two-gun Humphrey Bogart.\n\n18\n\nCRIME WAVE\n\nEurope: in Italy it was Un Pallottola per Roy (‘A Bullet for Roy’); in Spain El Ultimo Refugio (‘The Last Refuge’); and in Germany Entscheidung in der Sierra (‘Decision in the Sierra’). In France it was known as La Grande Évasion: ‘The Great Escape’. Walsh remade High Sierra in 1949 in a western setting as Colorado Territory starring Joel McCrea and Virginia Mayo as the lovers (Mayo played a half-breed squaw), and Dorothy Malone as Velma. Another remake, I Died a Thousand Times (1955), also released by Warner Brothers, starred Jack Palance in the Roy Earle role, Shelley Winters as Marie, Lori Nelson as Velma, Lee Marvin as Babe, Earl Holliman as Red and Lon Chaney Jnr as Big Mac. It was written for the screen by Burnett and photographed in CinemaScope and WarnerColor. Palance overacts as usual; the film’s success rests very much on your tolerance of Palance, and the strong supporting cast helps. Sam Peckinpah’s The Getaway (1972), based on a novel by crime writer Jim Thomson, was Steve McQueen’s homage to High Sierra, with its robbery and chase structure. McQueen, as bank robber Doc McCoy, even dons a black Bogartstyle suit and visits the park immediately following his release from the Texas penitentiary, with his wife Carol (Ali MacGraw). He plans the robbery of the First Bank of Beacon City, but the job goes awry. Doc and Carol flee towards Mexico with the proceeds, but vengeful hoods and the cops are in hot pursuit. Filmed with familiar Peckinpah élan, memorable scenes include shotgun-wielding Doc’s slowmotion destruction of a squad car and the El Paso finale, when the hoods catch up with Doc for a hotel showdown. With McQueen and MacGraw on top form, The Getaway was a box-office smash, grossing $19 million in the US. In 1941, Bogart and Lupino were to have starred again together in their next film, The Gentle People. For whatever reason Warners couldn’t get them back together and the film was eventually made without Bogart (replaced by John Garfield) as Out of the Fog. Garfield played a crook who robs two elderly men of their savings for a fishing boat, but gets his just desserts when he falls overboard. The film is appropriately titled, as Warners had just invested in a new billowing smoke machine, which worked overtime throughout the shoot. For many,"
