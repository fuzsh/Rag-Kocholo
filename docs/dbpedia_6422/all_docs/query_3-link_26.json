        "text": "Template:Use Australian English\n\nSouth Australian Film Corporation (SAFC) is a South Australian Government statutory corporation established in 1972 to engage in film production and promote the film industry, located in Adelaide.\n\nHistory[]\n\nOrigin[]\n\nThe South Australian Film Corporation was founded as a production company in 1972,[1] established under an act of parliament by the Dunstan government. It was intended “to stimulate and encourage the formation and continued development of the South Australian film and television industry”.[2] At the time of the Corporation's establishment, the Australian film industry was stagnating, and the Corporation played a significant role in the revival of Australian film making. Premier Don Dunstan played an instrumental role in the foundation of the Corporation and its early film production activities.[3]\n\nOperation[]\n\nFrom its genesis, the SAFC collaborated with various government departments and agencies in the production of short documentaries and educational films.[4] These included co-productions with the South Australian Department of Agriculture and Fisheries,[5][6] Department of Marine & Harbors,[7] the Education Department,[8] the Office of Fair Trading,[9] the Department of Housing, Urban and Regional Affairs[10] and others.\n\nIn the 1980s, the SAFC shifted its focus to television production. It relocated to a disused Philips factory in Hendon in the north-west suburbs of Adelaide. Jock Bair was head of drama.[11][12]\n\nIn 1994 its role changed, as it ceased producing films and became the government’s central agency to provide assistance to independent film makers. The television mini-series The Battlers was the last production produced by the SAFC. As the first state film corporation in Australia, the success of its business model led other state governments to establish similar bodies charged with the promotion of film production and fostering industry development.[2] Since then, it has focused on supporting (including providing funding) and facilitating the production of films and television in South Australia, as well as making production and post-production facilities available.[2][13]\n\nSAFC facilitated the production of the Nine Network program McLeod's Daughters (2001-2009), which was filmed on location in rural South Australia.[14]\n\nRelocation[]\n\nIn 2008, SA Premier and Arts Minister Mike Rann secured cabinet approval from the South Australian Government to fund the relocation of the SAFC[15] at a cost of A$43 million.[16] The project included new sound stages and mixing suites, as well as a major refurbishment of an historic 19th-century building as a high-tech film hub. The Corporation moved its headquarters to Glenside, an inner eastern suburb of Adelaide, sharing the historic former administration building of Glenside Hospital with film production company Closer Productions. The new Adelaide Studios were opened by Rann on 20 October 2011.[17]\n\nRecent activities[]\n\nIn 2017, the Corporation announced that a new TV Series called \"Soccer Swap\" was a co-production with Australia's 57 Films and China’s Qingdao TV.[18]\n\nAs of March 2019 , the Corporation continues to operate post-production facilities which have been used for a broad range of productions.[14]\n\nMajor productions[]\n\nWorks listed below can be found via the SAFC \"Made is SA Showcase\" web page.[14]\n\nSAFC as producer[]\n\nSunday Too Far Away (1975)[2]\n\nPicnic at Hanging Rock (1975)[2] (co-production with McElroy & McElroy)\n\nSmokes and Lollies (1975) (documentary short)\n\nStorm Boy (1976)[2]\n\nThe Fourth Wish (1976)\n\nThe Last Wave (1977) (co-production with McElroy & McElroy)\n\nBlue Fin (1978)[2] (co-production with McElroy & McElroy)\n\nThe Irishman (1978) (co-production with Forest Home Films)\n\nMoney Movers (1978)\n\nThe Sound of Love (1978) (TV movie)[2]\n\nWeekend of Shadows (1978)\n\nDawn!
