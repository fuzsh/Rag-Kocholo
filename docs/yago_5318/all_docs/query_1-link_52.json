        "text": "Quinton, who played peacemaker throughout his life, even brought his parents together one last time before Burt’s death last fall. “We went out to dinner and [Burt] brought me flowers,” says Loni, who remembers the sweeter side of her ex-husband. “Burt could be quiet, shy and self-deprecating. He was a bookworm and we loved to read mysteries aloud to one another so that we could share them.” Together, they’d spend many happy hours guessing about the ending of those stories. “He was a voracious reader.”\n\nWith a bittersweet twinge, Loni returned to Burt’s Florida estate after his death. “There are lots of memories there,” admitted the actress, who is working with Quinton to build a permanent memorial to his father. “Burt’s adored,” Loni noted. “We are working on [creating] a place for people to go to remember him.”"
