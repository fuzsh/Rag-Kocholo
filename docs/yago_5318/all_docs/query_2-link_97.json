        "text": "Loni Anderson, best known for her role as Jennifer Marlowe on the sitcom \"WKRP in Cincinnati,\" stopped by Good Day LA to talk about a new guest-starring role on \"Baby Daddy.\"\n\nThe 70-year-old actress (and still strikingly beautiful) will hit the small screen Wednesday night to play Nana Lyle, Bonnie's (Melissa Peterman) estranged mother who makes a surprise visit.\n\nAnderson also reminisced about the \"WKRP\" days, explaining that when she initially heard about the role, she didn't want to \"do the dumb blonde thing.\"\n\nAnderson's agent, however, advised her to go in with the hope of being cast for something else down the line.\n\n\"I said, 'No, and thank you very much, but I don't want to do this. I think you're show is very funny,'\" she explained about the audition. \"Grant Tinker at the time was head of MTM and said, 'Well, how would you do it?'\"\n\nAnderson did her own version of the character - and ended up landing the role, modified to being \"the smartest person in the room.\"\n\nDuring her career, much of the actress' personal life was covered in the press as well, but she recognizes the added level of scrutiny celebrities face today as a result of social media.\n\n\"The kind of notoriety we had, I mean they were everywhere, but it's not as invasive as the kids have it now,\" she said.\n\nAnderson is now married to singer Bob Flick, a founding member of the 1960s folk group The Brothers Four. She said they first met when she was 17 and a big fan of the group.\n\nDecades later, she saw him on PBS and called him.\n\nThe rest was history.\n\n\"Baby Daddy\" airs Wednesdays at 8:30 p.m. on Freeform."
