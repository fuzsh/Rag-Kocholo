        "text": "Loni Kaye Anderson (born August 5, 1946) is an American actress best known for her role as Jennifer Marlowe on the television sitcom WKRP in Cincinnati and as a former wife of Burt Reynolds (from 1988â€“93). Her divorce from Reynolds was a bitter, well-publicized debacle.\n\nAnderson was born in St. Paul, Minnesota to Carl K. Anderson and Maxine H. Kallin. As she says in her autobiography, My Life in High Heels, her father was originally going to name her \"Leiloni\", but then realized to his horror that when she got to her teen years it was liable to be twisted into \"Lay Loni\". So it was changed to just plain \"Loni\".\n\nHer most famous acting role came as receptionist Jennifer Marlowe on WKRP in Cincinnati. Her pinup photo in a bikini became one of the best-selling wall posters of the 1970s."
