        "text": "Burt Reynolds passed away this week at the age of 82, with fans of Smokey and the Bandit mourning the loss of one of their favorite actors. At the time of his death, Reynolds was living in Florida, far away from the fame and fortune of Los Angeles where he made his name. After his death from cardiac arrest, ex-wife Loni Anderson and son Quinton both paid tribute to the acting legend, with Anderson telling Fox News they would miss him and “his great laugh”. Burt Reynolds lived a relatively private life, but was not married at the time of his death. […]\n\nThe post Was Burt Reynolds married and did he have children? Here’s who acting legend leaves behind appeared first on Monsters and Critics."
