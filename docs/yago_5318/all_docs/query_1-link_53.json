        "text": "Born in Georgia, Burt Reynolds, 79, is best known for his action films Deliverance, Smokey And The Bandit and The Cannonball Run, and for his Golden Globe-winning role in the 1997 movie Boogie Nights. He had relationships with Sally Field and the late Dinah Shore, and is divorced from Loni Anderson, with whom he has a son. His new memoir, But Enough About Me, has just been published and he appears at a Guardian Live event on 2 December.\n\nWhen were you happiest?\n\nWhen I was under contract to Universal Pictures in 1959, just before I got my role on Riverboat.\n\nWhat is your greatest fear?\n\nThe next ache I get – I got hurt doing a lot of stunts and now I’m paying.\n\nWhat is your earliest memory?\n\nMy dad going off to war in 1942.\n\nWhich living person do you most admire, and why?\n\nMy son Quinton. He’s working behind the scenes in the picture biz and he’s done it all on his own.\n\nWhat is the trait you most deplore in yourself?\n\nMy inability to say no to people who ask me favours.\n\nProperty aside, what’s the most expensive thing you’ve bought?\n\nA ring for my ex-wife, Loni.\n\nWhat is your most treasured possession?\n\nI just received the Richard Farnsworth Diamond Award from the Stuntmen’s Association: it is the highest honour I’ve received and better than an Oscar.\n\nWhat would your superpower be?\n\nWhat makes you think I don’t have any? But if I got another, I’d say flight.\n\nWhat do you most dislike about your appearance?\n\nMy short legs.\n\nWho would play you in the film of your life?\n\nGeorge Clooney.\n\nWhich book changed your life?\n\nThe Catcher In The Rye: I was shocked to find my fears and concerns about life were shared by others.\n\nWhat did you want to be when you were growing up?\n\nA football player, a coach, a teacher.\n\nWhat makes you unhappy?\n\nLosing friends. Too many have passed away.\n\nWhat is top of your bucket list?\n\nTo play a role that surprises and shocks everyone – I have a few good ones in me still.\n\nTo whom would you most like to say sorry, and why?\n\nDozens of women – I think you’ll figure out why.\n\nWhat or who is the greatest love of your life?\n\nMiss Dinah Shore.\n\nWhich words or phrases do you most overuse?\n\n“Don’t act – behave.” I say that a lot in the class that I teach – and the students listen.\n\nWhat is the worst job you’ve done?\n\nMy dad got me a job for one summer harvesting sugarcane in Belle Glade, Florida – it was the most gruelling physical labour I’ve ever done.\n\nIf you could edit your past, what would you change?\n\nI wouldn’t have done the naked centrefold in Cosmopolitan magazine in 1972.\n\nIf you could go back in time, where would you go?\n\nDodge City, Kansas, in the 1870s.\n\nHow often do you have sex?\n\nNot often enough – or maybe it’s too often.\n\nWhat song would you like played at your funeral?\n\nThe psalm would be the 23rd. I’ll have to think about the song."
