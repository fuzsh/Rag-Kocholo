        "text": "Loni Kaye Anderson (born August 5, 1945)[1] is an American actress who played the role of Jennifer Marlowe on the television sitcom WKRP in Cincinnati. Is there something wrong with Loni Anderson??\n\nEarly life[]\n\nAnderson was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, the daughter of Maxine Hazel (née Kallin), a model, and Klaydon Carl \"Andy\" Anderson, an environmental chemist and grew up in suburban Roseville. She attended the University of Minnesota. [2] As she says in her autobiography, My Life in High Heels, her father was originally going to name her \"Leiloni\", but then realized to his horror that when she got to her teen years it was liable to be twisted into \"Lay Loni\". So it was changed to just plain \"Loni\".\n\nCareer[]\n\nAnderson's most famous acting role came as receptionist Jennifer Marlowe on WKRP in Cincinnati. Her pinup photo in a bikini became one of the best-selling wall posters of the 1970s. She and Burt Reynolds made one film together, the 1983 stock-car racing comedy Stroker Ace, a huge box-office failure.\n\nShortly after her divorce from Reynolds, she appeared as a regular in the final season (1993–1994) on the NBC sitcom Nurses. Anderson portrayed actress Jayne Mansfield in a made-for-TV biopic with Arnold Schwarzenegger as her husband, Mickey Hargitay. She teamed with Lynda Carter in a 1984 television series, Partners in Crime.\n\nAnderson made a series of cameo appearances on television shows in the late 1990s and early 2000s, such as the Spellmans' \"witch-trash\" cousin on Sabrina, the Teenage Witch and Vallery Irons' mother on V.I.P..\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nAnderson has been married four times; her first three marriages were to: Bruce Hasselberg (1964–1966), Ross Bickell (1973–1981), and actor (and one-time co-star) Burt Reynolds (1988–1993). On May 17, 2008, Anderson married musician Bob Flick, one of the founding members of the folk band The Brothers Four.[3] The couple had met at a movie premiere in Anderson's native Minneapolis a few years after Flick's group hit #2 on the pop charts with \"Greenfields\" in 1960. The ceremony was attended by friends and family, including son Quinton Reynolds.\n\nShe has two children: a daughter, Deidra Hoffman[4] (from her first marriage),[5] who is a school administrator in California;[6] and a son, Quinton Anderson Reynolds (born August 31, 1988), whom she and Burt Reynolds adopted.[7][8] Her autobiography, My Life in High Heels, was published in 1997.\n\nAnderson is currently a practicing Lutheran.[9]\n\nFilmography[]\n\nVigilante Force (1976)\n\nStroker Ace (1983)\n\nThe Lonely Guy (1984)\n\nAll Dogs Go to Heaven (1989) (voice of Flo)\n\nCoins in the Fountain (1990)\n\nMunchie (1992)\n\n3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain (1998)\n\nA Night at the Roxbury (1998)\n\nSelected television work[]\n\nWKRP in Cincinnati (1978–1982)\n\nThe Incredible Hulk (1 episode, 1978) – \"Of Guilt, Models and Murder\", (playing \"Sheila Cantrell\")\n\nThree's Company (1 episode, 1978) – \"Coffee, Tea, or Jack\", (playing \"Susan Wallace\")\n\nThe Jayne Mansfield Story\n\nPartners in Crime (1984)\n\nA Letter to Three Wives (1985)\n\nAmazing Stories (1 episode, 1985) – \"The Guilt Trip\"\n\nEasy Street (1986)\n\nBlondie and Dagwood (1987, voice)\n\nToo Good to Be True (1988)\n\nSorry, Wrong Number (1989)\n\nWhite Hot: The Mysterious Murder of Thelma Todd (1991)\n\nThe Price She Paid (1992) TV Movie, she played Lacey.\n\nNurses (cast member from 1993 to 1994)\n\nWithout Warning (1994)\n\nThe Mullets (2003–2004)\n\nSo NoTORIous (2006)\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nTemplate:Title without disambig at the Internet Movie Database\n\nREDIRECT Template:AllRovi person\n\nLoni Anderson at TV.com\n\nPersondata NAME Anderson, Loni ALTERNATIVE NAMES Anderson, Loni Kaye SHORT DESCRIPTION Actress DATE OF BIRTH August 5, 1946 PLACE OF BIRTH Saint Paul, Minnesota, U.S. DATE OF DEATH PLACE OF DEATH\n\nfi:Loni Anderson nl:Loni Anderson pl:Loni Anderson"
