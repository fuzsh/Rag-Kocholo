        "text": "Burt Reynolds died aged 82 after suffering a heart attack in a Florida hospital on Thursday morning, with his family by his side.\n\nHis ex-wife Loni Anderson and son Quinton have since broken their silence to pay moving tribute, saying that they will ‘miss’ the actor and ‘his great laugh.’\n\n‘Quinton and I are extremely touched by the tremendous outpouring of love and support from friends and family throughout the world,’ Anderson said in a statement to Fox News after his death.\n\nThe statement continued: ‘Burt was a wonderful director and actor. He was a big part of my life for twelve years and Quinton’s father for thirty years. We will miss him and his great laugh.’\n\nThe pair were married in 1988 and adopted Quinton before splitting up in 1994.\n\nSince Burt’s passing a 911 call for him has been released revealing how he was ‘having difficulty breathing and chest pains.’\n\nCo-star and ex Sally Field paid a touching tribute to Reynolds following his death, writing: ‘There are times in your life that are so indelible, they never fade away.\n\n‘They stay alive, even forty years later. My years with Burt never leave my mind. He will be in my history and my heart, for as long as I live. Rest, Buddy.’"
