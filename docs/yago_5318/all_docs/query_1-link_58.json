Together they have a daughter and six sons.\n\nGibson admitted in 2011 that their marriage culminated after his drunk driving incident. Gibson took a long 10-year-hiatus from acting until 2006, following several legal issues and controversial statements which were leaked to the public.\n\nLionel Richie & Diane Richie – $25 Million\n\nSinger and five-time Grammy winner Lionel Richie had an affair with Diane Alexander while he was married to his first wife and college sweetheart, Brenda Harvey. Lionel and Brenda got divorced after 18 years in 1993 so that he could pursue his relationship with Diane. The two also divorced 8 years after having two children together, Miles and Sofia.\n\nConsidering that Lionel has sold over 90 million records worldwide and has a net worth of $200 million, we think his bank account survived the $25 million divorce settlement just fine.\n\nDonald & Ivana Trump – $25 Million\n\nIt's no secret that the former U.S president Donald Trump has been married three times. The former businessman and TV personality married his first wife at age 30, Czech model Ivana Zelníčková. Together, they have three children; Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric. The two got divorced in 1992, after Ivana found out that Donald was having an affair with actress Marla Maples. Their divorce was the subject of a lot of media attention, and it was featured on New York tabloids newspapers' covers for 11 days in a row.\n\nThe following year Donald married Marla (which also ended in divorce six years later). In 2017, Ivana released her autobiography, Raising Trump, in which she shares about her upbringing and the early days of raising children with Donald.\n\nCraig McCaw & Wendy Petrak – $450 Million\n\nThe founder of McCaw Cellular, Craig McCaw successfully sold his company to AT&T for over $12 billion. His marriage to California newspaper publisher Wendy Petrak wasn’t as successful and the two divorced after 21 years of marriage in 1995.\n\nShe must have had a convincing divorce attorney considering that she walked away with $450 million. Craig is no longer on the list of the 400 wealthiest Americans, but with a net worth of over one billion dollars, we somehow don't feel so bad.\n\nHarrison Ford & Melissa Mathison – $118 Million\n\nIndiana Jones star and Hans Solo, also known as the iconic actor Harrison Ford, was married to his second wife, screenwriter, Melissa Mathison for 17 years before their marriage came to an end in 2004. The pair had two children together, Malcolm and Georgia.\n\nHarrison Ford has a net worth of around $240 million and still their divorce settlement of $118 million seems a bit steep. Still, with five of his films being in the 30 top-grossing films of all times, we're sure he's bounced back.\n\nAlec & Jocelyn Wildenstein – $2.5 Billion\n\nBillionaire businessman Alec Wildenstein and Jocelyn Perisse met when she was a guest at Ol Jogi Ranch in Kenya. They got married in 1978 and divorced 21 years later in a huge divorce settlement with Jocelyn getting $2.5 billion in addition to $100 million every year for 13 years. Their two-year divorce proceedings gained wide media coverage.\n\nThe couple is remembered most for their extensive plastic surgeries, specifically Jocelyn who got catlike features to satisfy Alec’s desires. During the divorce settlement, the judge ruled that Jocelyn could not use the money for plastic surgery. That was a great call on his part.\n\nBernie & Slavica Ecclestone – $1 Billion\n\nBritish businessman Bernie Ecclestone was married to the Croatian international model Slavica for 23 years. Despite the 28-year age difference between the pair plus the very obvious language barrier at the beginning of their relationship, their love was strong for many years during which they had two children.\n\nLove, however, wasn’t enough to keep the two together (and neither was money) and they divorced. They both hired a divorce attorney in 2009 to dispute on the divorce settlement. Slavica meanwhile walked away with a hefty amount of money, $1 billion.\n\nHeidi Klum & Seal – $70 Million\n\nWe loved Heidi and Seal together and we were surprised and sad to see them split. The singer and model duo married in 2005 and even renewed their vows to each other every year on their wedding day in front of family and friends.\n\nThey were married for seven years before calling it quits. They have three biological children together and Seal adopted Heidi’s daughter from her first marriage. Heidi and Seal announced that they were separating in January 2012, after nearly seven years of marriage. Their divorce was finalized in 2014.\n\nRupert Murdoch & Wendi Deng – $1.8 Million\n\nJust a mere 17 days after Murdoch divorced Anna Maria Torv, the $19.3 billion Australian media mogul tied the knot with Chinese-born and Yale graduate Wendi Deng. 17 days! You just can’t make these kinds of things up. At the time, Rupert was 68, while Wendi, 30.\n\nWell, that marriage lasted surprisingly long but also ended in divorce 14 years later. They had two daughters together, Grace and Chloe.With rash marriage choices like that, it isn’t surprising that Murdoch has been married four times and is the father to six children.\n\nDavid Hasselhoff & Pamela Bach – $5 Million\n\nThis is definitely one of the strangest settlements out there. In 1989, Baywatch hunk, David Hasselhoff and actress Pamela Bach got married. They had two daughters together over the span of their marriage.\n\nIn 2006, David announced that he was filing for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. Hasselhoff has struggled with alcoholism, so perhaps that has something to do with it. Pamela got $5 million from the divorce settlement while the Guinness World record holder of the most watched man on TV got his name “The Hoff.” We’re pretty sure that’s a win for him.\n\nEddie & Nicole Murphy – $15 Million\n\nComedian actor Eddie Murphy and Nicole Mitchell met in 1988 at an NAACP Image Awards show. A few years later, in 1993, they tied the knot at the Grand Ballroom of The Plaza Hotel in New York City. The model-comedian duo had five children together: Bria, Myles, Shayne, Zola, and Bella.\n\nSadly, the children couldn't keep the two together and they got divorced in 2006. Considering Murphy’s success, from projects like Shrek and The Nutty Professor, he definitely could have paid more than $15 million but they had signed a prenuptial agreement. This was unfortunate for Nicole who is reportedly in debt.\n\nMichael Jordan & Juanita Vanoy – $168 Million\n\nBasketball legend Michael Jordan and Juanita Vanoy met on a blind date in 1984. They had two sons together, Jefferey Michael and Marcus James. Seventeen years later they divorced. When their divorce was finalized in 2007, they held the record for the most expensive celebrity divorce. Another record to add to Jordan’s already long list of achievements, we’re sure just not the kind he’s proud of.\n\nBut, one thing is for certain, the greatest basketball player of all time could afford to hand over the hefty cost, considering his net worth of 1.7 billion dollars.\n\nJeff and MacKenzie Bezos - $140 Billion\n\nAmazon tycoon, Jeff Bezos met his now ex-wife Mackenzie in 1992, when she was working in one of his hedge funds. They quickly got married in 1993 and became one of the richest couples in history. They went on to have 4 children (three sons and an adopted daughter from China). After 25 years of marriage, the couple announced it would be divorcing in 2019.\n\nJeff Bezos is said to have fallen for another woman, Lauren Sanchez, an actor and helicopter pilot. Even though divorces are never simple, it's good to know that these two at least ended in amicable terms (as much as they could). The question now is, will this be the most expensive divorce settlement ever?! Bezos' fortune comes mainly from Amazon, and since there is no prenuptial agreement, Mackenzie technically has the right to take half of the company. But, what does this mean for Amazon's future, it's workers, and most importantly, its customers? Only time will tell...\n\nRupert Murdoch & Anna Maria Torv – $1.2 Billion\n\nScottish journalist Anna Mann and Australian media mogul Rupert Murdoch married in 1967. Anna worked for his Sydney newspaper The Daily Telegraph. She was Rupert’s second wife. 32 years later, the pair divorced in 1999. During their marriage, they had three children together: Elisabeth Murdoch, Lachlan Murdoch, and James Murdoch.\n\nRight before their separation, Murdoch was made a Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Gregory the Great, a papal honour awarded by Pope John Paul II. Their divorce settlement of a staggering $1.2 billion was mind blowing, but considering Murdoch’s net worth of $18.1 billion, he’ll be okay.\n\nMichael & Diandra Douglas – $45 Million\n\nIn 1977, Wall Street actor Michael Douglas married Diandra Luker, daughter of an Austrian Diplomat. The age difference was clearly visible between the two, with him being 32-years-old while she was just 19-years-old at the time.\n\nIt seems like the 13-year age difference had its impact on the couple and they divorced in 1995. They had a son together, Cameron, one year after their wedding. The generous divorce settlement of $45 million didn't put much of a dent on Michael's $300 million net worth.\n\nDmitry & Elena Rybolovleva – $4.5 Billion\n\nElena Rybolovleva filed for divorce from Russian businessman and investor Dmitry Rybolovlev. She cited his \"serial infidelity,\" for their divorce stating that he used to \"share his young conquests with his friends, and other oligarchs.\" That just ain't cool.\n\nAt first, the courts awarded Elena a staggering $4.5 billion in the settlement in 2014, but after Dmitry appealed, she was granted \"only\" $604 million.\n\nDemi Moore & Bruce Willis – $90 Million\n\nJust like Demi and Bruce’s marriage was very public, their divorce also had everyone talking. The Die Hard actor was Demi's second husband. Their marriage lasted for 11 years during which they had three daughters together, Rumer, Scout, and Tallulah.\n\nTheir marriage ended in 2000 and Willis made a public statement saying that “he had failed as a father and husband.” Willis credited Will Smith for helping him deal with the situation. Willis and Moore have maintained a good relationship with one another since the divorce.\n\nNeil Diamond & Marcia Murphey – $150 million\n\nThe singer-songwriter, musician, and actor Neil Diamond married production assistant Marcia Murphey in 1969. Their marriage lasted for 25 years during which they had two sons, Jesse and Micah.\n\nMarcia accused Neil of having an affair countless times which led to the pair’s divorce. Neil's current net worth is $175 million so it seems like the divorce settlement may have set him back a lot.\n\nMadonna & Guy Ritchie – $92 Million\n\nMadonna and director Guy Ritchie met in November 1998. Ritchie is known for his crime films and has directed such films like Snatch, Revolver, and Sherlock Holmes. He became Madonna's second husband in Scotland in 2000 in an impromptu wedding at the stunning Skibo Castle. A short time later, Madonna gave birth to their son, Rocco. In 2006, they adopted together David, from Malawi.\n\nUnfortunately, the marriage didn’t work out and Madonna filed for divorce just two years later. The marriage ended by decree nisi. Luckily, they came to an agreement regarding their children. Ritchie has since moved on to model Jacqui Ainsley and the two have three children together.\n\nPaul McCartney & Heather Mills – $48.6 Million\n\nThe legendary English bass guitarist and singer of The Beatles, Paul McCartney married former model Heather Mills in a stunning ceremony at Castle Leslie in Ireland. They have one child together, Beatrice. They both did not expect to be divorcing only six years after they got married.\n\nMills was her own representative for all of the divorce proceedings. McCartney later said that she was gutsy to do this. With his net worth of over $1 billion, the divorce settlement surely was of no inconvenience to his bank account. Through her former marriage to Paul, Heather is entitled to the title of Heather Mills, Lady McCartney, although she doesn't go by it.\n\nSteve & Elaine Wynn – $741 million\n\nBusinessman and art collector Steve Wynn married Elaine originally in 1963. They were married until 1986. During their marriage, they founded together Mirage resorts in 1976. The couple divorced for the first time in 1986. They reunited a few years later in 1991 and thought that maybe their marriage would work out the second time around. Well, it once again flopped in 2010. During their second marriage, they co-founded Wynn resorts together.\n\nSteve very publicly split the Wynn Resort share with Elaine and she walked away with $750 million in Wynn stock in the divorce settlement. I guess it was a good idea to marry him for the second time. Today, Steve still serves as the CEO with Elaine as the board director.\n\n$3 million (+)\n\nWe thought Kim and Kanye would make it to the end, but sadly, their love wasn’t meant to last. Kim filed for divorce after seven years of marriage and four children.\n\nWhile the couple has a combined net worth of $2.1 billion, a prenuptial agreement protected most of their individual assets. What's more, the couple waived spousal support. West is ordered to pay $200 000 in child support every month, and on top of that, the couple will share their children's tuition and children's security costs 50/50. As for their properties, they're split in accordance with their prenup.\n\nApproximately $800 million\n\nOne of the most iconic hip-hop artists of all time, Dr. Dre, divorced his wife Nicole Young after twenty-four years of marriage. While the numbers are not finalized, Dr. Dre’s millions are up for grabs.\n\nThe pair did opt to have a prenup agreed to before getting married, but it still could get costly for the hip-hop mogul. He is estimated to be worth 800 million dollars, and you can bet if Nicole has her way he could be losing up to half of that.\n\n$63 million\n\nJennifer Aniston, America’s sweetheart, split with her partner Justin Theroux in 2018. The couple was together for nine years, two of them being married. However, there is ambiguity with those last two years of marriage, and the question of whether they were legally married at all!\n\nThis could help protect Jennifer’s finances even more, along with the prenup the couple agreed to when they “wed.” It's yet to be seen how Justin and Jen sort it out but based on her making $63 million during their time together, it could get costly...especially if that prenup is not as ironclad as she thinks.\n\n$1.3 million (+)\n\nKelly Clarkson should have been warned that her divorce could also be costly when she married into the McEntire family. Mrs. Clarkson married Brandon Blackstock, the stepson of country star Reba McEntire, in 2013 and they spent seven years together.\n\nThe couple filed for divorce in 2020, and the proceedings were finalized in 2022. The first “American Idol” winner now has to pay a one-time sum of $1.3 million, monthly child support of $45,601, and monthly spousal support of $115,000. Yikes!\n\n$3 million\n\nCountry music superstar, Kacey Musgraves separated from her husband Ruston Kelly, after two and a half years of marriage. While the couple didn’t get messy during the divorce, Kacey still had to sell their house and split the earned revenue from the time they were together.\n\nShe is worth an estimated 10 million dollars, and luckily she gets to keep a majority of it. On the bright side, she now has new material for her next album. Silver lining!\n\nApproximately $4.1 million\n\nAfter marrying young, LeAnn Rimes and Dean Sheremet decided to get divorced young as well. At the time, Rimes had an estimated net worth of 10 million dollars, and she was going to have to part ways with some of it during the proceedings.\n\nWhile the final amount of the divorce remains private, Rimes did have to sell their home which only sold for $4.1 million compared to their asking price of $7.45 million. She then married Eddie Cibrian two years later, and for her wallet’s sake, we hope this one lasts.\n\n$80 million\n\nA true country music power couple, Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert split after four years of marriage. Rumors of infidelity surrounded both parties, and that may have led to their demise.\n\nThe pair was estimated to be worth $160 million combined, but lucky for both of them they signed a prenup before joining forces. The specifics of the divorce are still private, but the two agreed to split all shared assets and now happily are with different partners. Seems like they've both moved on. Blake with new wife Gwen Stefani and Miranda with new hubby Brendan McLoughlin.\n\n$200 million\n\nThe Shania Twain/Robert Lange matrimony only lasted 14 years, but that didn’t mean the divorce would be cheap. She is worth an amazing 400 million dollars while her husband is worth 225 million dollars.\n\nThe divorce did not leave either of them broke, but who they chose to date after got a little weird. Robert ended up two-timing Shania with her friend Marie-Anne Thiebaud, and a few years later Shania married Marie-Anne’s ex-husband. We may never understand ultrarich people.\n\n$125 million\n\nYou may think if you know a person for longer it will make it easier (or at least cheaper) if you two do divorce. Well, that is not the case; just ask Garth Brooks. He married his college sweetheart, Sandy Mahl, in 1986 and divorced in 2000.\n\nThe couple had a net worth of 400 million dollars, and he had to pay her a cool $125 million of that in the divorce settlement. This just reminds us that when money is involved, even things between college sweethearts can get messy.\n\n$ 6.6 million (+)\n\nSlash, the lead guitarist for Guns N’ Roses, divorced his wife of 13 years, Perla Ferrar in 2014. The divorce was contentious and took them a LONG 4 years to settle. It ended up costing the guitarist a lump sum of $6.6 million, $100,000 per month in spousal support, and $39,000 a month in child support.\n\nLuckily, he was able to keep his music and guitars and continues to shred with Guns N’ Roses to this day. Good thing too, because he needs a way to pay back both of those supports.\n\n$20 million\n\nAfter the former “Today” host Matt Lauer was disgraced, his troubles didn’t stop. He and his wife of nearly 20 years Annette Rose divorced in September 2019 and she took a whopping $20 million with her.\n\nIt forced him to sell his $44 million house in the Hamptons and other assets just to pay for it. Although they signed a “postnup” after their initial separation she still was able to take home a large bag of Matt’s money. Good for her!\n\nUnknown\n\nAdele probably wishes she signed a prenup before marrying Simon Konecki in a secret marriage in 2012. It would have helped keep her share of the $180 million she is worth. The details of the divorce and payout are not open to the public, but we assume it was a large amount.\n\nWhile it cost her a pretty penny, the divorce did inspire one of her albums, and she has found love since. We know she was thinking \"nevermind I'll find someone like you!\"\n\n€550 million\n\nWhile some people may not recognize the names of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum & Princess Haya bint al-Hussein immediately, they are responsible for one of the most expensive divorces ever recorded in the UK’s history.\n\nThe ruler of the Emirate of Dubai had to pay his wife €550 million during the settlement. That’s over half a billion euros! Now she can wave to him from her yacht next time they bump into each other in Monaco.\n\n$1.4 million\n\n“Real House Wives of Orange County” stars Shannon and David Beador settled for $1.4 million in 2019. The couple has three children between them and MANY assets. The divorce negotiations got ugly and lasted for nearly two years.\n\nWhile they finally settled, we can’t imagine the stress from it all. It also doesn’t help to have camera crews documenting every stage of the process.\n\nApproximately $20 million\n\nDenise Richards and Charlie Sheen’s marriage didn’t last long. The couple only stayed together for three years, and it was volatile near the end. Richards accused Charlie of numerous allegations and the pair split shortly after that, in 2006.\n\nAt the time, Sheen had a net worth of $100 million and Denise was worth $12 million. His number has since dwindled down to 10 million, and we can only assume that is partly from the settlement and child support he had to pay.\n\n$12.5 million\n\nBritain's sweetheart, Colin Firth split with his wife Livia Giuggioli after 22 years of marriage. They first met in 1996 on BBC’s “Nostromo” and married shortly after. The partnership lasted until 2019 when Livia had an extramarital relationship with Italian journalist Marco Brancaccia.\n\nFamily close to the couple weren’t surprised by the divorce, but Colin’s bank account was. In total, the settlement cost him $12.5 million dollars, and you can bet he will be signing a prenup next time!\n\n$130 million\n\nWhen tennis star Andre Agassi hooked up with movie star and model Brooke Sheilds the world thought their matrimony would stand the test of time. Sadly, it did not, and the couple divorced two years later.\n\nAlthough it was a short marriage it still cost Agassi $130 million for the settlement! The shocking sum certainly put pressure on the tennis champ to win a few more tournaments.\n\n$ 75 million (+)\n\nKobe Bryant and Vanessa Laine Kobe divorced after 10 years of marriage. In addition to the legal fees, Kobe was also ordered to pay Vanessa $75 million in their divorce settlement.\n\nNot a small amount of money for the NBA superstar. The couple eventually found their way back to one another and seemed happy for the rest of their time together until Kobe's tragic passing.\n\n$30 million\n\nFormer NBA player, Kenny Anderson had to pay his ex-wife Tami Roman $30 million to settle their divorce. After numerous extra martial affair allegations against Kenny, the writing was on the wall for their divorce.\n\nWe think if we find ourselves in that situation, it might be cheaper to have an open marriage than think about a divorce. Just think of all the money that could've been saved!\n\n$26 million\n\nIn 2010, Cheryl Tweedy divorced then-Chelsea soccer player, Ashley Cole, after four years of marriage. The romance ended after a slurry of rumors dealing with infidelity around the soccer star.\n\nWorst of all, Cheryl had gotten Ashley’s name tattooed onto her shortly after their wedding. Hopefully, Cherly used some of the nearly $26 million Ashley paid during the settlement to get that tattoo removed before her next relationship.\n\n€8 million\n\nFrench soccer star, Thierry Henry, divorced Claire Merry in 2008 after reaching a settlement reported to be worth € 8 million euros. It was a nasty divorce and was only made worse because their daughter got caught in the middle of it.\n\nThe marriage only lasted for four years, but still cost Thierry Henry a bunch of money in the end. We think he is doing better, and being a sports commentator has been financially fruitful even after his athletic career ended.\n\n$10 million\n\nPrimetime, aka Deion Sanders, had to pay Pilar Biggers $10 million to settle their divorce. The couple was together for 12 years and had three children together.\n\nThis is the second time Deion has had to divorce a partner, although the second cost a lot more. People say “third time is a charm,” but we don’t know if Deion wants to risk his money again...\n\n$9 million\n\nDuring her time on the court, Justine Henin was a force to be reconned with. She reached the title of number one tennis player in the world and holds over 40 WTA singles tennis titles along with seven Grand Slam titles to her name.\n\nNone of those, however, stopped her from paying $9 million to former husband Pierre-Yves Hardenne. The five-year marriage ended with Justine paying a hefty sum and may have put too much stress on ending her tennis career early.\n\n$6 million\n\nFormer baseball star Jose Canseco had to pay $6 million dollars to his ex-wife Esther Haddad to settle their divorce. This eventually forced him into bankruptcy along with tax evasion, and a variety of other factors.\n\nHis $45 million that he had amassed while playing quickly went out the door, and left Canseco scrambling. He is now worth $500,000, but things could be much worse. This is another reminder to be smart with your money and pay your taxes on time. The government will come for them.\n\n$15 million\n\nNick Faldo has enjoyed his time as one of golf’s greats, but we bet he wishes he had some of his money back from his first two divorces. The break-up with Gill Bennet in 1995 had him lose $10 million, and his divorce with Valerie Bercher cost him $15 million.\n\nWhile it was less than what Tiger Woods had to pay out, it was still a lot of money. Let’s hope his third marriage lasts because you can bet the payout would be well above $15 million if he had a third divorce.\n\nUnknown\n\nShane Warne, one of the most beloved Australian cricketers, had to pay his ex-wife Simone Callahan $10 million to settle their divorce.\n\nThe split came after allegations of infidelity from the former wicket-taker. The entire process was not easy for either of them and having three children in the middle of it doesn’t help either. We are glad they settled and both have moved on with their lives.\n\n$4 million\n\nFormer heavyweight champion of the world Evander Holyfield paid his first wife Paulette $4 million in 1991 to settle their divorce. Their nuptials only lasted six years and infidelity was cited as the cause of divorce.\n\nHolyfield grossed around $205 million in the ring, so $4 million of that doesn’t sound too bad. While losing money was never easy, he seemed to forget his pains quickly and married again shortly after. That one also ended in divorce, but we will see if he learns for his next time.\n\n$5 million\n\nAfter a long and ugly divorce, former NBA great, Dwyane Wade paid his former wife Siohvaughn Funches $5 million to settle. There were numerous allegations in the relationship as to why it ended, but either way, it didn’t seem like a healthy partnership.\n\nDwyane has since found love and is now with Gabrielle Union. We hope this one goes better than the previous one, for his and his wallet's happiness too.\n\n$3 million\n\nFormer NBA MVP, Allen Iverson had to pay $3 million in his divorce settlement with his ex-wife, Tawanna Turner.\n\nThe couple was only together for two years, but due to various hardships including Iversons's numerous affairs and gambling habits, the two parted ways. Tawanna's settlement of $ 3 million roughly works out to $1.5 million for each year spent with him.\n\n$100 million\n\nOne of the best big men in the NBA, Shaq O’Neal also had to pay a big payout for his divorce from Shaunie O’Neal in 2011. The total cost equaled either $5 million a year in alimony payments until she remarried or collected $100 million.\n\nThis is on top of the $100,000 a month he pays for child support! Luckily for Shaq, he is worth 400 million dollars, but it still hurts to lose that much money.\n\n$20 million\n\nEven billionaires aren’t immune to losing money during divorce; their settlements just cost more than most. Billionaire Elon Musk found this out when he divorced his college-sweetheart Justine Musk.\n\nThe couple had six children together, and have since gone their separate ways. The total payout was worth $20 million dollars, but to a billionaire that is a drop in the bucket.\n\n$1 billion\n\nSergey Brin, the co-founder of Google, announced he and former wife Nicole Shanahan were splitting up after 3 years of marriage. They said they have “irreconcilable differences,” but we think it’s most likely because of the alleged affair between Nicole and Elon Musk.\n\nMusk has since denied those allegations, but you can never be sure. Even with a prenup, Shanahan is seeing more than $1 billion in divorce settlement payments. No one wants to go through a divorce, but a payout like that cuts the edge a little.\n\nUnknown\n\n“Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Erika Jayne filed for divorce from her husband, Tom Girardi, in 2020. This came after 21 years of marriage and was a shock to the fans of the show.\n\nThey had met while she was a waitress at one of his favorite restaurants and seemed happy to be together. But all is not what it seems. While it wasn’t ugly at first, not having a prenup might change that. We bet they will both have great lawyers and we will have to see how it all plays out.\n\nUnknown\n\nJana Kramer and Mike Caussin's relationship never seemed easy, so it’s not a surprise to many that these two didn’t last.\n\nKramer filed for divorce in 2021 citing, \"inappropriate marital conduct, irreconcilable differences, and adultery.\" This would be the second time the couple broke up, after a split in 2016. They did renew their vows in 2017 but finalized the divorce in 2021.\n\nUnknown\n\nAfter working together on “The Hart of Dixie,” couple Jamie King and Kyle Newman filed for divorce. This came after 13 years of marriage, but rumored allegations don’t shine a great light on the director.\n\nJamie had filed for a restraining order as well. While the terms and payout of the divorce are still being discussed, you can bet with the acquired wealth they have gained over the years it won’t come cheap.\n\nUnknown\n\nWe thought these two would last, but like everyone on this list, it wasn’t meant to be. Jay Cutler and Kristin Cavallari seemed cute when they were together on “Just Cavallari”, her own reality tv show, but apparently, under the surface, things were much worse.\n\nThey were both stubborn people and butted heads constantly. The only time they were on the same page was in front of their kids. The ink is still drying after Kristin filed for divorce in 2020, but knowing how much they have made together as a couple we can only imagine the numbers that the settlement will become.\n\n$5 million\n\nAfter 22 years of marriage, Wendy Williams filed for divorce from Kevin Hunter in 2019. She cited the reason for the divorce as, “Kevin fathering a child with his mistress.\"\n\nThe divorce got ugly and now the pair only speak to each other when necessary. He is only worth $5 million but as a tv executive, we are sure she got all the money she could.\n\n$720,000 (+)\n\nOne of the most widely recognized artists today, Mary J Blige filed for divorce from former hubby Martin “Kendu” Issac in July 2016. This was after 12 years of marriage, and many fights in between which ultimately lead to her leaving.\n\nShe ultimately paid her ex-husband $30,000 a month in spousal support for two years during the proceedings and settled for an undisclosed amount after. We can only imagine what it was, but with her net worth of $20 million, it had to be less than that.\n\nUnknown\n\nStars of “The Real Housewives of New York City” Jules and Michael Wainstein filed for divorce in 2016.
