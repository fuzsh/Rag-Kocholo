        "text": "Burt Reynolds' former home in the mountains is on sale for $2.9 million.\n\nOriginally built in 1972, the four-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bathroom home in the hills of Highlands, North Carolina, was purchased by Reynolds in the 1970s after he fell in love with the city when filming the Academy Award-nominated movie \"Deliverance.\"\n\n\"I own about fourteen houses. Whenever I am asked which one is my favorite, without a moment's hesitation I always say my house in the mountains,\" the actor said in a letter in December 1983, according to the listing.\n\nNestled on a .9-acre property, the home is surrounded by nature. Designed by renowned architect Jim Fox, the home boasts many unique features, including big round windows, which seamlessly blend the house into its surroundings.\n\nRYAN GOSLING SHARES 'ODD PIECE OF ADVICE' BURT REYNOLDS GAVE HIM\n\nThe exterior of the home includes hues of green, red and brown, and was built using steel, stone and wood.\n\nWith multiple entry points on the main level, guests can enjoy panoramic views of the cascading mountains surrounding them from every room of the house. Once inside, visitors will feel as if they are inside a country cabin, with wood flooring, ceilings and accents throughout the home.\n\nThe main level boasts much of the home's living spaces, including a sunken living room with a stone fireplace.\n\nDirectly above the sunken seating area is a second living room. The room also features a wall of windows, not only providing a perfect look at the picturesque views, but also bringing in plenty of natural light.\n\nRounding out the main level are the kitchen and dining rooms. The kitchen has two ovens, a breakfast bar, an extra large stovetop, a wine rack, a sizable refrigerator and a walk-in pantry, as well as plenty of counter and shelf space for storage.\n\nJust steps away from the kitchen is the dining room which, due to the home's open floorplan, is also connected to the two seating areas. It features a circular dining table, placed under a unique light fixture made out of tree branches.\n\nAll rooms on the main level are surrounded by oversized windows, with access to the terrace, a new addition to the home, found between the dining room and the kitchen.\n\nThe upper level of the home features the private primary bedroom, which is accessed through a separate entrance. The primary suite features a walk-in closet, a private ensuite bathroom and floor to ceiling windows with access to a private upper deck.\n\nIn addition to a Jacuzzi tub, the ensuite bathroom also features a standing shower and dual sinks, which are set in front of a big window overlooking the rolling hills around the house.\n\nTwo additional bedrooms are found on the upper level. However, they are accessed via a separate stairway.\n\nThe home's lower level features a guest suite, office, wine cellar and a unique all-stone bathroom custom-built for Reynolds by his then-wife, Loni Anderson.\n\nFollowing the \"Gunsmoke\" star, there have been multiple other owners, with the current residents upgrading the home with a terrace on the main floor.\n\nThe outdoor terrace is one of the home's biggest highlights. Wrapping around the entirety of the home's main level, the terrace provides a plethora of additional seating space, as well as an outdoor fireplace.\n\nIn addition, there is an outdoor dining room and bar, which makes the home perfect for entertaining.\n\nLocated up a stone staircase, just a short walk away from the outdoor fireplace, is an in-ground heated lagoon-style pool and waterfall.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nWhile completely surrounded by nature, it is only a 10-minute drive to many five-star restaurants, art galleries, cultural opportunities and world-class shopping, giving owners the perfect balance between city life and nature living."
