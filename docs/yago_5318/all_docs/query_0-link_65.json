        "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Loni Anderson was married Saturday to Bob Flick, a founding member of the 1960s folk group The Brothers Four.\n\nThe ceremony was attended by friends and family, including son Quinton Reynolds, who walked the \"WKRP in Cincinnati\" and \"Nurses\" star down the aisle. Reynolds is Anderson's son with Burt Reynolds, whom she divorced in 1993.\n\nFlick met Anderson at a movie premiere in her native Minneapolis a few years after his group hit No. 2 on the pop charts with \"Greenfields\" in 1960. A local newspaper had sent her out to pose with the group as the \"lucky young fan,\" an image that was used Saturday night as the couple's wedding poster, her publicist, Cheryl Kagan, told The Associated Press.\n\nAnderson's granddaughters wore the same diamond hearts the actress wore in the 1983 movie \"Stroker Ace,\" in which she starred with Reynolds.\n\nAnderson, 62, plans to keep her maiden name."
