        "text": "NORTH PALM BEACH, Fla. — About 80 of Burt Reynolds' friends and relatives shared memories of the late actor at a private memorial service.\n\nReynolds' ex-wife Loni Anderson and their son Quinton Anderson Reynolds were among the speakers at the Thursday service at Quattlebaum Funeral Home in North Palm Beach, Florida, a family spokeswoman, Cheryl Kagan, told The Associated Press.\n\nReynolds died at age 82 on Sept. 6 at a hospital in Jupiter, Florida, and a death certificate issued Sept. 10 that was obtained by \"Entertainment Tonight\" said that he had already been cremated. Neither family nor officials have revealed a cause of death.\n\nBobby Bowden, former longtime football coach at Florida State University, where Reynolds was a player, opened the service with a prayer and went on to tell stories from throughout the actor's life.\n\nAnderson, who had a famously difficult divorce from Reynolds, shared happier moments from their 12 years together, calling their son Quinton their \"greatest collaboration.\"\n\nOther guests included Lee Corso, the ESPN football analyst who was a teammate and roommate of Reynolds in college, and former NCAA and NFL quarterback Doug Flutie."
