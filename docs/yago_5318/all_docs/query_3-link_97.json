        "text": "Based on her looks, time seems to have stood still for Loni Anderson.\n\nBut believe it or not, the sultry co-star of the classic sitcom “WKRP in Cincinnati” is now 62 and even has a teenage grandaughter.\n\nPlaying the blond, buxom and brainy Jennifer Marlowe on “WKRP” for five seasons made Anderson a star. Her high-profile marriage and subsequent divorce from third husband Burt Reynolds further enhanced her fame.\n\nAnderson, who lives in Los Angeles, still acts and appeared in two short-lived series in recent years: “The Mullets” and as Tori’s Spelling’s self-absorbed mom in the autobiographical comedy “So NoTORIous.”\n\n“That was a great comedy that we did, and I wish we were still doing because what a great character to play,” she said. “I’ve been a Goody Two-shoes all my life, I don’t like to play one. I really like being the naughty person, I like the evil, I like the left of center and I like comedy.\n\n“Comedy is my favorite thing to do.”\n\nIn the post-“WKRP” decade, she co-starred with Lynda Carter in the detective series “Partners in Crime” and in the sitcoms “Easy Street” and “Nurses.”\n\nThe role in “Nurses” came in 1993, about at the same time that Anderson underwent a very bitter and public divorce from Reynolds, whom she had been with since the early 1980s and married in 1988.\n\nReynolds and Anderson adopted a son, Quinton, who is now 19. And Deidra, Loni’s daughter from her first marriage, has given her two granddaughters.\n\n“I love being me,” she said. “I’ve loved it through the good and the bad because it took all of that to make you who you are. I love my family, my children. I’ve just had a very blessed life, a great career – and now, the man of my dreams.”\n\nThe man is Bob Flick, whom she met in her native St. Paul, Minn.\n\n“We met a long time ago when I was a senior in high school,” Anderson said. “We were in love then but we lost contact with one another until just recently. So, it’s a love story through the ages.”\n\n“We’re planning on getting married,” she added. “We’ve moved into a new house, and we’re having a wedding and it’s all very exciting.”\n\nIf she could choose just one DVD of her work to be placed into a time capsule, she wouldn’t choose “WKRP.”\n\n“As far as just an individual performance that I loved was `The Jayne Mansfield Story.”‘\n\nIn that movie, Anderson starred opposite future California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who played Mansfield’s husband, bodybuilder Mickey Hargitay."
