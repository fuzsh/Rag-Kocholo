        "text": "A Night at the Opera\n\nThe Marx Brothers take on the high brow with full comedic force in A Night At The Opera. With non-stop wise-acre zingers, antics, gags, and fabulous musical interludes (the brothers’ shining stamps), this laugh-a-moment adventure posits Groucho as Otis P. Driftwood, would-be manager and opera producer trying (with Chico and Harpo as co-conspiring stowaway tramps/petty con artists) to kick-start the burgeoning careers and love lives of two young performers, making big Broadway bucks doing it. Playing off both the brothers’ humorous and musical talents, this classic harnesses the energy of old-timey vaudeville and plays it uproariously on the biggest Opera stages in the world!\n\n“The loudest and funniest screen comedy of the Winter season.” – Andre Sennwald, The New York Times\n\nDirector\n\nSam Wood\n\nWriter\n\nScreen play by George S. Kaufman and Morrie Ryskind from a story by James Kevin McGuinness\n\nStarring\n\nThe Marx Brothers, Kitty Carlisle, Margaret Dumont, Allan Jones\n\nYear\n\n1935\n\nCountry\n\nUSA\n\nFormat\n\n35mm\n\nRunning Time\n\n91 minutes\n\nDuck Soup\n\nEnjoy a bowl of Duck Soup, hilariously served by the genius of The Marx Brothers – Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and Zeppo. Grouch plays Rufus T. Firefly, who at the behest of the wealthy widow Mrs. Gloria Tisdale (Margaret Dumont), becomes the leader of Freedonia, a country that is about to be taken over by neighboring Sylvania and its scheming Ambassador. There are plenty of quotable one liners and delightfully choreographed physical gags when spies Chicolini (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo) are sent over to spy on Firefly – “You know this means war!” Groucho relishes in the absurdity of it all, and you’ll recognize The Marx Brothers’ vaudevillian influences in countless comedies such as Bananas, Blazing Saddles, Airplane! and Monty Python’s Flying Circus, to name a few. Duck Soup features the famous “mirrorscene” and the dizzying exchange of hats between Chico and Harpo with Edgar Kennedy victimized as a Lemonade Stand vendor, but the key ingredient in Soup, is its political satire, putting it in the rarefied air of The Great Dictator and Dr. Strangelove.\n\n“The Marx Brothers in their greatest movie.” – Pauline Kael, The New Yorker\n\nDirector\n\nLeo McCarey\n\nStarring\n\nThe Marx Brothers\n\nYear\n\n1933\n\nCountry\n\nUSA\n\nFormat\n\n35mm\n\nRunning Time\n\n68 minutes"
