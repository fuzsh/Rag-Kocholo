This book will appeal to motion picture enthusiasts, Marx Brothers' fans, and film historians.\n\nReview: HOLIDAY at Washington's Arena Stage: Deeply Flawed Show, Flawless Performance\n\nThey sure don't write them like Holiday anymore. A play about the foibles of a family of rich White people that supplies no meaningful social or racial context, a critique of the world of wealth which is bafflingly superficial, and a romance almost lacking in visible courtship, playwright Philip Barry's 1928 Broadway hit has very little claim to be produced now. Yet it's given a sumptuous and impressive production by Arena Stage in Washington. Go for the performances, the costumes, and the direction, and you'll be fine. Seek more, and you may be disappointed.\n\nNorth Coast Repertory Theatre to Stage AN EVENING WITH GROUCHO\n\nAward-winning actor/director Frank Ferrante re-creates his acclaimed New York and London stage portrayal celebrating America's greatest comedian - Groucho Marx.

The two-act comedy consists of the best Groucho one-liners, anecdotes and songs including 'Hooray For Captain Spalding,' and 'Lydia, the Tattooed Lady.' The audience literally becomes part of the show as Ferrante ad-libs his way throughout the performance in grand Groucho style.\n\nTHERE'S NOTHING LIKE LIBERTY: THE MARX BROTHERS AND AMERICA to Stream in October\n\nFreedonia Marxonia, the annual Marx Brothers festival held on the SUNY Fredonia campus, will once again be held virtually this year.

Frank Baum's children's 1900 book, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. While the book and the film are fairly well aligned as children's entertainment, author Gregory Maguire's 1995 spin on the story, Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West is most definitely for the adults. Political upheaval, adultery, multiple murders, family dysfunction, betrayal, it's downright Shakespearean. All three serve as fantastical fodder for Stephen Schwartz and Winnie Holzman's Broadway production of Wicked, a sort of Oz-ian 'Odd Couple,' were Neil Simon a fan of J.R.R. Tolkein and J. K. Rowling: 'On Ozmember the 13th, Elphaba was asked to remove herself from her place of residence; that request came from her father. Deep down, she believed he was right, but knew that someday she would return. With nowhere else to go, she appeared at university and meets Galinda, fresh off an off-Broadway run of LEGALLY BLONDE. Can two strange women share a dorm room together without driving each other crazy?'\n\nAN EVENING WITH GROUCHO Starring Frank Ferrante Announced Gets Chicago Premiere\n\nRandolph Entertainment is pleased to announce today, on the 42nd anniversary of Groucho Marx's passing, the Chicago premiere of An Evening with Groucho, starring award-winning actor and director Frank Ferrante, will play one night only on Sept. 17, 2019 at 8:00 p.m. at The Spiegeltent ZaZou located on the 14th floor in the Cambria Hotel Chicago Loop-Theatre District, 32 W.

'Minnie's Boys' purported to be modeled on 'Gypsy,' using a meddlesome, domineering mother to get her progeny, the four Marx Brothers, into show business. Unfortunately, a tepid book and uneven score made this a flop in 1970 and it doesn't fare much better today, despite the valiant efforts of the MTG cast.\n\nGroucho Returns to the Walnut With Frank Ferrante in AN EVENING WITH GROUCHO\n\nFor one night only, Frank Ferrante will perform his acclaimed portrayal of legendary comedian Groucho Marx in An Evening With Groucho. The performance that Variety called \"a Tour de Force\" will happen on the Walnut Mainstage on Monday, February 25.
