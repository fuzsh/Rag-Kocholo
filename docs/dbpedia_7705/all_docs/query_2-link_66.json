The Marx Brothers burst into cinema during Hollywood’s transition from silent films to talkies—a transition essential to the effective translation of Harpo’s character from stage to screen. Although Harpo never spoke in his movies, he was anything but silent. His character was a creature of sound, dependent on an emotive level of communication accessible to all with little need for translation—emotions he expressed in honks, whistles and, most eloquently, in his music. This allowed Harpo to transcend class and wartime politics; a freedom not afforded his brothers, or any character explicitly tied to verbal language and, by extension, a specific cultural outlook.",

        "text": "Introduction: a Transnational Trickster\n\n1In early autumn, 1933, New York critic Alexander Woollcott telephoned his friend Harpo Marx with a singular proposal. Having just learned that President Franklin Roosevelt was about to carry out his campaign promise to have the United States recognize the Soviet Union, Woollcott—a great friend and supporter of the Roosevelts, and Eleanor Roosevelt in particular—had decided “that Harpo Marx should be the first American artist to perform in Moscow after the US and the USSR become friendly nations” (Marx and Barber 297).\n\n“They’ll adore you,” Woollcott told him. “With a name like yours, how can you miss? Can’t you see the three-sheets? ‘Presenting Marx—In person’!” (Marx and Barber 297)\n\n3Why Harpo, and not his brothers? What was it about Harpo Marx the Americans hoped might traverse the icy walls of politics to reach their guarded new allies?\n\n5As his career progressed, Harpo and his harp stumbled unknowingly, and unintentionally, into a musical and temperamental affiliation with the mythical Trickster archetype: an instinctive association that struck a visceral chord with audiences across the world, and lent his character a distinctive transnational aspect (Fix chap. 7, Kindle; Smith 101). The strange incongruities and juxtapositions inherent to his unspeaking, musical persona both fascinated and discomfited his contemporary viewers, but they also allowed Harpo a singular freedom—a freedom not afforded his fast-talking brothers or, indeed, any character explicitly tied to verbal language, yet which was recognized, and envied, by Woollcott and the Russian artists who witnessed his live performances (Marx and Barber 301-3). This was the freedom to cross and challenge established societal boundaries: boundaries of class, culture, and wartime politics in a world increasingly defined by the strains of two world wars, a great depression, and the polarizing ideologies that would eventually shape the Cold War (Marx and Barber 301-3).\n\nCrossing Boundaries: Flirting with Society\n\n7Harpo and his brothers grew up, worked, and developed their distinctive characters together as a family team, sharing the hardships of the road and the fickle tribulations of show business. As a result, when the group comes together on screen, their complementary talent and energy is greater than the sum of its parts. Any analysis of Harpo must acknowledge this context. This section will compare each brother’s approach to social conventions and the boundaries of social class to illustrate how Harpo used his music to transcend them.\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\nNightly now in the performance of The Cocoanuts at the Lyric Theatre […] there comes a moment when a mute and ineffably comic clown stops his antics, cuddles up in a pool of light to a great, golden harp and plays it with a caressing stroke that is all his own. Nightly the hilarious audience, of which you would have sworn that each member would rather die then and there than listen to anyone play anything pays him the tribute of an abrupt and breathless hush. Even the commuters forget all about that 11.25 for Mamaroneck and when his turn is done, the applause is an avalanche (45).\n\n19Harpo’s earnest, playful performances earned him those warm moments in the spotlight, but he did not reach that place alone. Harpo’s creation of a zany pantomime character who spoke only through his music had as much to do with his family’s rough and tumble dynamics as it did with his own rather shy, quirky personality. Growing up, it was always Chico and Groucho being singled out for their musical abilities, leaving Harpo to wonder if he had any talents at all (Marx and Barber 12, 65). After observing how his big brother Chico charmed local audiences with his playful piano techniques, Harpo resolved to teach himself to play piano too. He practiced “like a madman” every chance he got and, once he had learned two songs all the way through, he and Chico devised a plan to get Harpo a job playing accompaniment for silent movies at the neighborhood nickelodeons: Chico going to each audition for him, then Harpo showing up to play (Marx and Barber, 66, 83-84). Of course, once the managers realized Harpo’s entire repertoire consisted of two songs played in one key, he’d be fired. This was not an encouraging start for a budding musician. But even then, Harpo recognized that the piano was Chico’s instrument, just as singing was becoming his younger brother Groucho’s burgeoning claim to fame. No matter how hard he practiced, Harpo could only hope to be an echo…until he found his own voice in his beloved harp—an epiphany of self-discovery that came only after he reached adulthood (Marx and Barber 30, 83-84, 123-25).\n\n20Harpo was well into his twenties and his early vaudeville career when his mother, Minnie, shipped him his first harp. Yet, her decision to send a harp to a son who’d long been struggling to find a place for himself did not come out of the blue, and neither did Harpo’s fascination with the instrument (Marx and Barber 30, 123-25). Harpo’s grandmother had played the harp in 19th century Germany, accompanying her husband’s traveling magic show. After immigrating to New York City, Harpo’s grandfather preserved her small harp’s worn, stringless frame in his room where, as a child, Harpo spent hours staring at the silent instrument, trying to imagine what harp music might sound like (Marx and Barber 23-30). From the moment he first opened his own harp case, Harpo felt a visceral connection with the complex instrument—a connection that, over the years, developed into a tender, respectful relationship that helped define his public persona and private identity (Marx and Barber 12).\n\n23\n\n24In 1924, the Marx Brothers’ fortunes began a dramatic upward swing. After decades of climbing up, falling from, and reestablishing their grip on the vaudeville ladder, the team made the jump to Broadway stardom. Their musical show, I’ll Say She Is (1924), took New York by storm—followed closely by The Cocoanuts (1925) then Animal Crackers (1928). From opening night, it was clear that people besides Harpo’s brothers were beginning to notice, and appreciate, the wizard-like qualities of this strange, silent, musical little man. Educated, highly cultured people like Alexander Woollcott, who took Harpo under his wing and introduced him to the trendsetting literary elite of 1920s New York City: the members of the famed Algonquin Round Table (Marx and Barber 169-72).\n\n25\n\nCrossing Boundaries: Breaking the Ice\n\n27The Marx Brothers have often been described as anarchists in their films, held up as the anti-establishment, unapologetically biting satiric vanguard of the cultural revolutions that rocked the 1960s (Gardner chap.1, Kindle). This interpretation may be a symptom of the fact that, like any honestly made work of art, every audience, from Depression-era immigrants to the political protestors of the 1960s and beyond, has been able to find meaning in their films; meanings that unavoidably reflect their own times and troubles. This, in large part, explains the Marx Brothers’ lasting transnational appeal: “[t]he Marx Brothers were second-generation assimilationists” (Dale 157).\n\n28Yet, viewed through a historic lens, it is clear these films are very much in keeping with the hopes, desires, and problems of their time—namely, the 1930s and 40s. Far from acting to topple or redraw the social order, or ridicule high culture in and of itself, most of the comedy and character interaction in their films is based on the Marx Brothers’ characters’ desire to carve a place for themselves within the established order—much like the immigrant communities they grew up entertaining (Louvish 262-63, Kindle). While “their humor does have the turbulence that comes from merging with the mainstream […] [t]he Marx Brothers’ movies lack satire’s concentrated, utilitarian purpose... Rather, they follow in a long tradition of ‘festive abuse’ that isn’t so much aimed at a target as released and left free to radiate in all directions, even back on the clowns themselves” (Dale 132-33).\n\n29Viewed this way, the Marx Brothers’ films support a meritocratic system strongly evocative of the American Dream that brought their parents, and so many others, to the United States. For all their puns, antics, and insults, the Marx Brothers stand as symbols of that dream’s fulfillment, having climbed their way from poverty to the mansions of Beverly Hills. As their biographer, Simon Louvish, wrote: the Marx Brothers are “not the enemies of Art [and Culture] but the greatest defenders of its integrity,” opposed “only to their usurpation by those who wish to use them merely as instruments of manipulation and power” (297).\n\n30This image was no fluke. One of the most important influences on the Marx Brothers’ characters as they transitioned from stage to screen was George S. Kaufman, a Pulitzer Prize winning playwright, satirist, and member of the Algonquin Round Table, who used his biting wit to lampoon American politics. While developing and writing The Cocoanuts, the Broadway smash that later became the Marx Brothers’ first movie, Kaufman clearly saw parodic potential in these four madmen, using their forthright style and childlike insolence to call out social snobbism and conceit; punch holes in pretentious, posturing speeches; and champion true love and talent over the kind of inherited status and social obligation that rob the individual of their freedom to choose, and to fully express themselves (Louvish 93, 237, 297). As Groucho’s biographer put it, in their films the Marx Brothers became the modern equivalent of the little boy who shouted that the Emperor had no clothes (Arce 315).\n\n31This was a pervading theme in the Marx Brothers’ movies: the promotion of inclusion over exclusion, and straightforward honesty over polite prevarication. But, unlike his brothers, Harpo could not use words to name the bullies or shed light on society’s absurdities. He had to demonstrate them, using the props he pulled from his threadbare raincoat’s impossibly commodious pockets to strip the varnish from charlatans, reveal dictators as war hungry clowns, and simultaneously befuddle, exasperate, and charm the upper class.\n\n32Perhaps this is why Harpo’s friend Alexander Woollcott decided Harpo should be the first American to perform in Russia once the United States officially recognized the USSR in 1933. Woollcott was good friends with Eleanor Roosevelt, and he delighted in playing opposites off each other. To his mind, sending silent, impish Harpo Marx to entertain Marxist Russia was a coup that could not be topped. Harpo could play his harp, perform a couple sketches, then close with a second round of harp music (Marx and Barber 316). But, for Harpo, it was as terrifying, eye-opening, and as life-changing an experience as a trip to “the other side of the moon” (Marx and Barber 300, 316).\n\n33Harpo’s connections, through Woollcott, were able to acquire the papers and letters of introduction he required but, in order to get to Russia, Harpo first had to pass through Germany by train. He had initially been enthusiastic about the prospect of seeing his mother’s birthplace, but very quickly discovered that Hitler’s Germany was no place for the son of Jewish immigrants to linger. He described the experience in his autobiography:\n\nIn Hamburg I saw the most frightening, most depressing sight I had ever seen—a row of stores with Stars of David and the word “Jude” painted on them, and inside, behind half-empty counters, people in a daze, cringing like they didn’t know what hit them and didn’t know where the next blow would come from. Hitler had been in power only six months, and his boycott was already in full effect. I hadn’t been so wholly conscious of being a Jew since my bar mitzvah. It was the first time since I’d had the measles that I was too sick to eat. I got across Germany as fast as I could go (Marx and Barber 301).\n\n35Before long, the Russians had developed a show of their own around his material—a very talky show delivered in Russian that Harpo never managed to fully comprehend. But, an American journalist in the audience, Louis Fischer, did, and he recorded his impressions of the historic performance in his autobiography:\n\nWe [Fischer and the American Ambassador William C. Bullitt] went to the Myusik Hoi, as the metropolitan vaudeville theater was called. First, Harpo had to be shown Moscow’s variety, and so the regular performance dragged on for many hours with about one laugh per hour. Finally, it did end. Now for Harpo. Yes, but. . . Harpo Marx had to be introduced to the Soviet audience. Accordingly, Pudovkin, successful Soviet cinema producer, rose in front of the curtain and delivered a speech punctuated with appropriate quotations from Lenin, Stalin, and Engels on the role of humor in society, on the social significance of Hollywood, and finally on the real meaning of Marx, Harpo (Fischer 301).\n\n36\n\n37This introduction may have been part of the boundary-crossing Harpo never did comprehend, but “if Harpo could function without even understanding” what might this suggest about the relationship between his “hokum” and the “rational narrative” his hosts built around it (Davison 178)? During the 1920s, an avant-garde movement rose in Soviet Russia. Described in the 1921 Eccentric Manifesto, it incorporated circus-like stunts, absurdity and breaks in logic to challenge or reject traditional theater and the old order. The movement had briefly attracted the imaginations of burgeoning Russian directors such as Sergei Eisenstein, but it was short-lived, unable to survive the rise of Stalinist bureaucracy and Soviet Realism. Yet, while the Marx Brothers’ films—particularly their latest, Duck Soup—“…would have been incredibly exciting to the authors of the Eccentric Manifesto…,” when the “Stanislavskian criteria of story and explicable psychological motivation [were] applied to the example of the comic approach of the Marx Brothers,” in this case, specifically to Harpo, “[he] unsurprisingly [was] found wanting… [T]his kind of comedy was clearly not circumscribed enough, had too much of a risk of competing interpretations” (Hatherley 179).\n\n38Harpo’s description of his audition before Stanislavski at the Moscow Art Theater demonstrates this attitude. According to Harpo, he was told to do his pantomime schtick alone, without a straight man, in what he described as “the most miserable performance I’d ever given” (Marx and Barber 311). The director seemed similarly unimpressed, telling Harpo his “juggling of the cutlery was not exceptionally clever. I said I could do any of a dozen different bits, but they wouldn’t mean anything without an audience. ‘I shall be the judge of what your acting will mean to an audience’,” the director said (Marx and Barber 311). So, the Russians developed a script around Harpo’s “hokum” to provide an acceptable context (Marx and Barber 316). In this script, “[a]s in much of the Marx Brothers’ film output,” there was “an almost total split between plot and gags,” so, adaptable as ever, Harpo shrugged and went along, just waiting for his turn onstage (Davison 180).\n\n39As Fischer recalled, once the introductions and explanations had come to an end,\n\nAt last the curtain went up. It was nearly midnight and Harpo in his famous straw wig appeared in a two-actor sketch. It was one unending laugh. Several times the performance was interrupted because the heroine just couldn’t stop laughing. The Russians, whose laughing muscles had grown flabby from insufficient exercise, held their sides and asked for more. Harpo, among other things, did his renowned cutlery trick. Dozens of knives, spoons, and forks dropped from his sleeves. Then he took a huge quantity of silver from inside the actress’s dress (Fischer 301).\n\n40Once loosed from contextual restraints, Harpo’s noisy mute needed no further interpretation. But as much as his humor delighted the gathered crowds, his music spoke straight to the Russians’ hearts. Surviving footage from his trip shows Harpo, without his wig, performing on his harp for his admiring Russian audience who, as Harpo put it, couldn’t have been warmer. “I got tremendous satisfaction out of going into the hinterlands of the Soviet Union, where no Marx Brothers picture had ever played—where, in fact, nobody had ever heard of any non-Russian Marx except Karl—and scoring a hit…” (Marx and Barber 326). His return to Moscow for a second two-week stand was “triumphant… The house was sold out for every performance… I could do no wrong. I got so cocky I refused to play ‘Rose Marie’” (a popular and much-requested song at the time) (Marx and Barber 326).\n\n42It is an integral characteristic of Harpo’s trickster-like character that, on stage or screen, he could transcend the barriers of language, culture, and even ideology with his noisy, musical, wordless comedy, and this did not go unnoticed, or unenvied, by Russian artists, especially those who remembered Eccentrism. For example, the famed silent film director Sergei Eisenstein who, according to Fischer, had a natural penchant for comedy and longed to produce a satire lampooning the absurdities of Russian bureaucracy (Fischer 301-2). Prevented from pursuing this project by the Russian government, Eisenstein found himself unable to cross the rigid boundary Harpo had been required to traverse just to perform his act in Russia. After all, Harpo had just starred in Duck Soup, the Brothers’ most pointedly political escapade which involved the four Marx Brothers mocking warring dictators into the realm of ridiculousness (Hatherley 179). But, Harpo was a jester, a musical elf, and, once in the spotlight, it was not hard for him to appear more supernatural than human—a character trait that, even in Russia, rendered Harpo all but immune to the political constraints that bound Eisenstein’s creative hands. As Fischer wrote, “The mature can laugh at and criticize themselves… It is sacrilege to make fun of the dictatorship. Nor can you make light of its enemies. You can’t shoot a man after you’ve dismissed him with ridicule” (302-3). Unless, perhaps, you are a Marx Brother, and your ammunition is a bowl of fruit (as in Duck Soup).\n\n43When it finally came time for Harpo to depart, he left “Soviet cinema directors dejected and jealous,” but his experience in Russia triumphantly demonstrated the transnational appeal of a character whose only audible language was music (Fischer 302-3).\n\nCrossing Boundaries: from Tramp to Guardian Angel\n\n44The Marx Brothers’ later films are often disparaged by critics, and the Brothers themselves, as lesser works, but they demonstrate an interesting progression in Harpo’s use of music and musical solos from the direct, energetic goading of class and authority he employed in early films, like Monkey Business, to the more thoughtful, surreal, and even metaphorical solos featured, most notably, in The Big Store (Louis K. Sidney, 1941), A Night in Casablanca (Archie Mayo, 1946) and Love Happy. According to Richard Rowland, “It is not hard to find an explanation of the endless appeal of [the Marx Brothers’] films. They deal with the gravest question with which comedy can deal. They ask us […] intermittently but irresistibly, ‘What is reality?’ Theirs is an unreal world: anyone can see that” (265).\n\n45\n\n46Examples of this ‘unreality’ abound in all the Marx Brothers’ films, particularly where Harpo’s scenes are concerned. Whether eating buttons or sipping ink in Cocoanuts, shooting at living statues in Animal Crackers, glibly pulling a cup of steaming coffee from his pocket in Horse Feathers (Norman Z. McLeod, 1932), taking the place of a camera in Monkey Business, posing as Groucho’s reflection in Duck Soup, climbing up the scenery in A Night At The Opera, causing a piano to self-destruct in A Day At The Races, gobbling food without pause in Room Service (William A. Seiter, 1938), getting coached by a seal while playing checkers in At The Circus (Edward Buzzell, 1939), turning a loom into a harp in Go West (Edward Buzzell, 1940), or holding up a building in A Night in Casablanca, as the brother least tied to social convention and, therefore, most likely to shatter it, Harpo seems free to walk or cross the line between realistic comedy and surrealism at will, blithely demonstrating his ability to flip a scene from one side to the other at least once in every movie. “This is more than a joke; it is a moral lesson,” Rowland noted. “In their world, disorder succeeds… Nothing is sacred; nothing is real” (Rowland, 266).\n\n47\n\n49\n\n50The surrealistic nature of Harpo’s character and performances was present from the start of the Brothers’ film career but, like his skill on the harp, his dexterity as a performer matured and developed over time, culminating in a spectacular conclusion at the end of Love Happy, the Brothers’ last film together. At the start of the story, Harpo employs his character’s more supernatural attributes to all but literally become a street-rumpled guardian angel to a starving theatrical troupe, his coat pockets holding enough pilfered groceries to feed the whole ravenous gang. Later, his fingers become birthday candles for a ballerina whose thoughts are with someone else; a magical, though bittersweet scene that leaves Harpo alone with his golden harp [62:50-67:14]. His otherworldly nature is again emphasized in the concluding chase scene in which he cleverly plays with the light and shadow of film itself. Here, the trickster Harpo proves he can still out-surreal the surrealists as he transforms a rooftop full of tacky billboards into a dreamscape playground. Using his character’s unique attributes to simultaneously lampoon and transcend the encroachment of Hollywood commercialism on cinematic art, the old dogcatcher demonstrates he has not lost his bite (Fix chap. 13, Kindle).\n\n52In the end, of course, the Marx Brothers hijack the Nazis’ getaway plane and Harpo flies them straight into the local jail where the bad guys are captured, the stolen treasures are recovered, and the Marx Brothers prove that they can still chase the girl.\n\nConclusion: Harpo’s Legacy\n\n54Throughout his long and vibrant career, Harpo’s close connection with sound, music, and particularly his beloved harp imbued his public persona with an ineffable, otherworldly quality, affiliating the characters he played with classic Trickster archetypes capable of shifting appearance, crossing socio-cultural and political boundaries, and even altering reality to suit his whims. This association crossed over into his private life, where his dedication to his instrument revealed a key facet of his personality, and his perception of music, to his son, Bill Marx, a Julliard-trained composer and musician.\n\n55“Most people who play by ear pick up first on the melody, and next on the beat. The subtle colors and textures of harmony are usually way beyond them. With Harpo, just the opposite,” Bill wrote of his father, the self-taught harpist who never did learn to read music. “He was virtually oblivious to melody… But harmony! Ahhh! It was sheer sound that sent him into raptures, swamping whatever sense of melody he had” (II. Bill).\n\n56In a similar way, it can be argued that “silent” Harpo provided the harmony to the Marx Brothers’ fast-paced patter. As demonstrated in the three above sections, Harpo was a creature of sound, of transition and inclusivity, his oxymoronic attributes and emotive honks, whistles, and strums weaving over, under, and around Chico’s puns and Groucho’s barbs while, simultaneously, allowing his character the freedom to cross from realism to surrealism, from ragamuffin pickpocket to trickster/angel. Ultimately, it was Harpo’s unique relationship with music, with his horns and whistles, his clarinet and, of course, his harp, that allowed him to crisscross between boundaries other artists, filmmakers and performers could only dream of approaching."
