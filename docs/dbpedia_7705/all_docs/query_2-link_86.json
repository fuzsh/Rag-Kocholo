        "text": "Just some thoughts on current happenings:\n\nOur monthly feature of “Classic Film Screenings from around the world” will be suspended as there are no reliable reports of future theatrical screenings during the Corona virus pandemic.\n\nThere are 17 recommended films to watch on Turner Classic Movies in the U.S. this month:\n\nMy first must-see TCM film recommendation is Italian director Vittorio De Sica's neo-realist masterpiece The Bicycle Thief (Ladri di biciclette), one of the most emotionally devastating films of all time (See: Top Ten World Cinema Treasures). No amount of superlatives can possibly describe the spiritual rewards one gleans from witnessing this simple but profound odyssey taken by a father and his dutifully loving son while desperately searching for a stolen bicycle. It airs on Sunday, May 3 at (late evening) 12:45 am PST.\n\nNext is The Treasure of the Sierra Madre with Humphrey Bogart portraying perhaps his darkest and most psychologically troubled character. Watching his slow transformation from an honest and idealistic adventurer to a tormented, paranoid psychotic is one of the art's most stunning, dramatically forceful experiences perfectly matched to a magnificent and fatalistically ironic conclusion. My previous thoughts on this film are here. This \"treasure\" can be discovered Tuesday, May 5 at 2:15 pm PST.\n\nOut of the Past, is one of film noir's finest and most highly recommended here. She will arrive Saturday, May 16 at 11:15 am PST.\n\nMany of the films first listed as \"Hidden Gems\" are not so hidden anymore thanks to those companies releasing them on DVD and Blu-ray in addition to their regular showings on TCM. One of these is Hidden Gem #59, The Hill, an intense dramatic achievement. I've previously reviewed this film here. The Hill can be marvelled at on TCM Saturday, May 16 at 2:45 pm PST.\n\nWhat exactly is film noir? Many enthusiasts and experts continue to debate the subject, with numerous examples of films that should, and just as many that should not, be included in the category. Some, who most likely feel that noir films rely on a certain look, dismiss any colour film as unworthy of being categorised as such. Others like myself, prone to distinguishing noir by its subject matter, are more inclined to include colour films produced during noir's classic time period that focus on crime and the psychologies of those involved. This brings me to my next TCM selection and a prior Blu-ray recommendation here, 1953's Niagara, one of the strongest arguments for colour noir that exists. See for yourself on Sunday, May 17 at 3:15pm PST and again on Friday, May 29 at 8:30 pm PST.\n\nIn case anyone who missed last month's screening of Casablanca would like to have another shot at seeing this revered classic in May, your prayer has been answered. Previously reviewed as one of the Top Ten “All that Glitters…”, this blend of romance, patriotism and political intrigue admittedly has a polish unmatchable by most Hollywood fare. 1944's Academy Award Best Picture Winner will air Saturday, May 23 at 5 pm PST.\n\nOn this Memorial Day in the U.S., TCM will show The Best Years of Our Lives, an incisive look into how each of three returning servicemen adapt to civilian life at home, after World War II. Previously, I highly praised The Best Years of Our Lives for its exceptional musical score composed by Hugo Friedhofer in the first part of a series entitled Top Ten: Motion Picture Music Treasures. This emotionally powerful tour de force will commence on TCM Monday, May 25 at 5 pm PST.\n\nGovernmental rules and regulations, declarations of war and how easily they can happen, not to mention many other subjects of unimaginable wisecracks, sight gags and irreverence are all delivered in an incongruous celebratory musical setting: an outrageous rapid fire procession that shocks and delights in equally strong measures, care of contributing writers Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby, including Leo McCarey’s spirited direction. Actors Louis Calhern, Margaret Dumont, Raquel Torres, Edgar Kennedy, Charles Middleton, among others, lend distinctive and lively characterisations to the uproarious calamity on display. The (in)famous and hilarious mirror scene, Chicolini’s trial and Pinky’s lemonade vendor spat can be found here, but none of the sickly love story elements or serious musical performance “time outs” that tend to mar the Brothers’ other films. This is pure Marx mayhem through and through, containing a sharper wit and mockery than can be witnessed in just about any comedy made since. Duck Soup is a masterful concoction and will be served up (updated) Thursday, November 2 (2023) at 5 pm PDT.\n\nTCM's current monthly schedule can be confirmed by clicking on any of the above TCM related images. For those who live in parts of the U.S. other than the western region, the time zone can be adjusted in the upper right-hand corner of TCM's programme.\n\nDuck Soup is also May’s Blu-ray pick of the month. See the last entry in this column for more details.\n\nTom attended the University of Missouri to study journalism. It was there he first auditioned for a part in \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\" at the college theatre and obtained the role of “Nick”. Later, at the Herbert Berghof Studio School for Acting in New York City, he would study with the great acting coach Uta Hagen, the latter who, interestingly enough, became famous for her theatrical performance of “Martha” in the same play. Tom made his first important film debut in Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1977) which led to his exceptional performances in films such as The Dogs of War (1980), The Big Chill (1983), Platoon (1986, for which he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor) Shoot to Kill (1988), At Play in the Fields of the Lord (1991), Gettysburg (1993), Training Day (2001) and Inception (2010). He also made a strong impression in the excellent TV mini-series Hatfields & McCoys (2012, receiving an Emmy “Best Supporting Actor” nomination).\n\nUlzana’s Raid has highly revealing exchanges of dialogue and physical conflict between complex characters. De Vol, a frequent collaborator with director Robert Aldrich, especially excels at underscoring scenes of action and their brutal aftermath in this intelligent and contemplative western starring Burt Lancaster in a perfectly modulated performance. The characters’ intensity, their differences and unwavering resolve are brilliantly enhanced by the composer who additionally, thanks to this World Premiere release on CD by Intrada Records, provides an exceptional listening experience on its own. More information on this limited edition can be obtained from the manufacturer by clicking on the soundtrack image.\n\nMay’s Blu-ray recommendation is to the above reviewed Duck Soup contained in this very special box set from Universal Home Entertainment along with Horse Feathers, Monkey Business, Animal Crackers and The Cocoanuts.
