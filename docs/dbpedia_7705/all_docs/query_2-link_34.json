        "text": "The obituaries claim that Julius Henry Marx died in 1977 at the age of either 82 or 87. (Family sources are a little vague and contradictory.)\n\nOn Saturday, however, Groucho Marx is booked in Wilmington's Thalian Hall.\n\nFrank Ferrante has been playing the funnyman with the fake mustache since his student days at Southern Cal, when his impersonation was spotted - and encouraged - by none other than Groucho's son, Arthur Marx.\n\nAn Evening With Groucho follows the comic's life from his early days on the road through You Bet Your Life. Curtain time is 8 p.m.\n\nWith this little gem coming to town, it's high time to dust off the videos of those fabulous Marx Brothers movies.\n\nIn Hannah and her Sisters, Woody Allen's character - who's been so worried about his death that he converts to Christianity and starts eating Wonder Bread - finally concludes that Duck Soup is the main reason that life is worth living.\n\nI don't know if I'd go that far, but few screen comics have achieved so many moments of pure, carefree glee. There's Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin on the silent side, maybe Steve Martin on a good day, and Woody Allen before he realized he was a capital-G Genius - but not many more.\n\nThink of the \"Why a Duck?\" sketch from The Cocoanuts, the college football game from Horse Feathers, the declaration of war (to the tune of minstrels and hillbilly bands) from Duck Soup. It doesn't get much better than that.\n\nThe three main Marx Brothers made 13 movies between 1929 and 1949, and at least eight of them stand the test of time. (Milton Marx, alias Gummo, left the act before they hit the big screen; Herbert, alias Zeppo, the straight man of the team, retired after Duck Soup.)\n\nWhat An Evening With Groucho underlines, however, is how long and how hard the Marxes worked before the cameras ever rolled.\n\nBorn in New York City, the sons of German Jewish immigrants, the brothers grew up smelling greasepaint. Their mother, Minnie, was a famously frustrated actress who became perhaps the most famous stage mother in history. Their uncle, Arthur Sheekman, alias Al Sheen, was half of Gallagher and Sheen, one of the most famous comedy teams in vaudeville history.\n\nAll the boys started performing young. Leonard, alias Chico, started playing piano in saloons (and possibly some other, less reputable establishments - he allegedly gained his nickname for chasing \"chicks.\") Julius, alias Groucho, started off as a boy soprano.\n\nBy the early 1900s, under Uncle Al's tutelage, they had formed a musical comedy act, honing their skills, including the improvisation of snappy one-liners.\n\nLegend has it that Julius - the \"grouch\" of the family - started the trend during a tough night in Nagadoches, Texas, when he turned to the hostile audience and declared, \"Nagadoches is full of roaches.\"\n\nOK, it's not much, but it got laughs, and the brothers started working one-liners into the acts.\n\n(The brothers were famous for taking their revenge on mean crowds.\n\nA bad run in the town of Fredonia, N.Y., led to the christening of the hapless banana republic in Duck Soup as \"Freedonia.\")\n\nAs early as 1920, the Marxes collaborated on a two-reel silent, Humorisk or Humor Risk, with material by the future screenwriter Jo Swerling. No copies survived (and according to some rumors, it was no great loss).\n\nTheir real greatness would come later in the '20s, though, after the Marxes starred in a string of phenomenally popular stage revues. (By then, they were improvising so freely that one of their writers, the great George S. Kaufman, sourly remarked one night, \"Don't look now, but I think I just heard one of the original lines.\")\n\nThe brothers' first two movies, in fact - The Cocoanuts in 1929 and Animal Crackers in 1930 - were essentially remakes of their stage shows, filmed at Paramount's old Kaufman-Astoria studios in Queens, N.Y.\n\nBy then, Groucho had acquired his trademark mustache during the run of another show, I'll Say She Is. Arriving late at the theater one day, he found it quicker to paint on his whiskers than trying to apply spirit gum to hold on a false mustache. Afterward, he decided he liked the painted-on look better, and kept it throughout his movie career. He'd already acquired the Freudian cigar -- and the risque eyebrows.\n\nBy Monkey Business (1931), however, the boys had moved to Hollywood, although they brought along most of their old writers, including Mr. Kaufman, Morrie Ryskind and a young S.J. Perelman.\n\nNothing was sacred. The Marxes delighted in puncturing pretenses of society, of big business, of any sort whatsoever. They acquired their ultimate foil in 1930 with the casting of Margaret Dumont, a chirpy voiced dowager who became the Ultimate Society Lady.\n\n(Years later, Groucho would claim that Ms. Dumont always played straight and never got the group's jokes.)\n\nTheir high-water mark, from today's perspective, was Duck Soup (1933), which poked fun at fascist-style politics and militarism just as a character named Hitler was taking power in Germany.\n\nIronically, Duck Soup was also their biggest box-office flop - so big that Paramount essentially dropped the team.\n\nThe Marxes then moved across town to MGM at the invitation of its movie czar, Irving Thalberg.\n\nThe great Mr. Thalberg thought the Marx Brothers movies needed more than zany sight gags, that the group needed a plot set-up with villains and cute ingenues to make the anarchic comics more sympathetic. It was a tense arrangement; the Marxes, who had mostly done their own stuff in the past, bristled at Mr. Thalberg's controlling hand.\n\n(Once, the story goes, Mr. Thalberg left the brothers waiting too long outside his office; when he finally walked out to greet them, he found them squatting on the floor, naked, roasting potatoes over a fire lit on top of the carpet.)\n\nTo his credit, though, Mr. Thalberg sent the brothers out on tour first, to \"road-test\" the movie's gags. The results were two of their most popular hits: A Night at the Opera (1935) and A Day at the Races (1937).\n\nMr. Thalberg's death in 1937, at the age of 37, cut short the collaboration.\n\nThe brothers' comedy played less well in the 1940s, and the caliber of their writers and directors sank, but they managed to make one last first-rate movie Room Service (1938), under contract with RKO.\n\nHolding down a small role in that RKO cast was a redhead named Lucille Ball. Clearly Lucy learned a lot from the experience; years later, she happily invited Harpo on her TV show to salute the masters who taught her.\n\nFootnotes: All three brothers appeared, separately, in the otherwise limp Story of Mankind (1957). Harpo played Sir Isaac Newton with an apple, Groucho appeared as Peter Minuit, pulling a fast one on the Indians of Manhattan.\n\nGroucho's last movie appearance was in a 1968 comedy called Skidoo; he played God. It did not work as well as George Burns' O God.\n\nBen Steelman: 343-2208\n\nben.steelman@wilmingtonstar.com"
