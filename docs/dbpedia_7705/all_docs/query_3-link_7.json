        "text": "Margaret Dumont was an merican stage and film actress. She is best remembered as the comic foil to the Marx Brothers in seven of their films. Groucho Marx called her \"practically the fifth Marx brother\".\n\nDumont trained as an operatic singer and actress in her teens, and began performing on stage in the U.S. and in Europe, at first under the name Daisy Dumont and later as Margaret (or Marguerite) Dumont. Her theatrical debut was in Sleeping Beauty and the Beast at the Chestnut Theater in Philadelphia, and in August 1902, two months before her 20th birthday, she appeared as a singer/comedian in a vaudeville act in Atlantic City. The dark-haired soubrette, described by a theater reviewer as a \"statuesque beauty\", attracted notice later that decade for her vocal and comedic talents in The Girl Behind the Counter (1908), The Belle of Brittany (1909) and The Summer Widower (1910).\n\nIn 1910, she married millionaire sugar heir and industrialist John Moller Jr. and retired from stage work, but, after her husband's sudden death during the 1918 influenza pandemic, Dumont reluctantly returned to the Broadway stage, and soon gained a strong reputation in musical comedies. Her Broadway career included roles in the musical comedies and plays The Fan (1921), Go Easy, Mabel (1922), The Rise of Rosie O'Reilly (1923/24) and The Fourflusher (1925).\n\nDumont appeared in 57 films, including some minor silent work beginning with A Tale of Two Cities (1917). Her first feature was the Marx Brothers' The Cocoanuts (1929), in which she played Mrs. Potter, the role she played in the stage version from which the film was adapted. She also made some television appearances, including a guest-starring role with Estelle Winwood on The Donna Reed Show in the episode \"Miss Lovelace Comes to Tea\" (1959).\n\nDumont usually appeared as her trademark dignified dowager character, including in films with the likes of W.C. Fields (Never Give a Sucker an Even Break, 1941, and Tales of Manhattan 1942), Laurel and Hardy (The Dancing Masters, 1943) and Abbott and Costello (Little Giant, 1946), but also played dramatic parts in films including Youth on Parole (1937); Dramatic School (1938); Stop, You're Killing Me (1952); Three for Bedroom C (1952); and Shake, Rattle & Rock! (1956).\n\nHer last film role was that of Shirley MacLaine's mother, Mrs. Foster, in What a Way to Go! (1964).\n\nWith the Marx Brothers[]\n\nn 1925, Dumont came to the attention of theatrical producer Sam H. Harris who recommended her to the Marx Brothers and writer George S. Kaufman for the role of the wealthy dowager Mrs. Potter alongside the Marxes in their Broadway production of The Cocoanuts. In the Marxes' next Broadway show Animal Crackers, which opened in October 1928, Dumont again was cast as foil and straight woman Mrs. Rittenhouse, another rich, society dowager. She appeared with the Marxes in the screen versions of both The Cocoanuts (1929) and Animal Crackers (1930).\n\nWith the Marx Brothers, Dumont played wealthy, high-society widows whom Groucho alternately insulted and romanced for their money. Her role as the hypochondriacal Mrs. Upjohn in A Day at the Races (1937) brought her a Best Supporting Actress Award from the Screen Actors Guild, and film critic Cecilia Ager suggested that a monument be erected in honor of Dumont's courage and steadfastness in the face of the Marx Brothers' antics. Groucho once said that because of their frequent movie appearances, many people believed he and Dumont were married in real life.\n\nIn most of her interviews and press profiles, Dumont preserved the myth of her on-screen character: the wealthy, regal woman who never quite understood the jokes. However, in a 1942 interview with the World Wide Features press syndicate, Dumont said, \"Scriptwriters build up to a laugh, but they don't allow any pause for it. That's where I come in. I ad lib—it doesn't matter what I say—just to kill a few seconds so you can enjoy the gag. I have to sense when the big laughs will come and fill in, or the audience will drown out the next gag with its own laughter... I'm not a stooge, I'm a straight lady. There's an art to playing straight. You must build up your man, but never top him, never steal the laughs from him.\"\n\nWriting about Dumont's importance as a comic foil in 1998, film critic Andrew Sarris wrote \"Groucho's confrontations with Miss Dumont seem much more the heart of the Marxian matter today than the rather loose rapport among the three brothers themselves.\"\n\nPersonal LIfe[]\n\nDumont married millionaire American Sugar Refining Company heir and industrialist John Moller Jr. in 1910. The marriage was childless.\n\nMoeller died during the 1918 influenza pandemic. She never remarried, and died from a heart attack on March 6, 1965. She was cremated and her ashes were interred in the vault at the Chapel of the Pines Crematory in Los Angeles. She was 82, although many obituaries erroneously gave her age as 75."
