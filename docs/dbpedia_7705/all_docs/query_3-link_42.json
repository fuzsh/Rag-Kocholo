        "text": "In the Marx Brothers’ 1929 feature film debut, set during the 1920s Florida land boom, Groucho plays the manager of the Hotel de Cocoanut, a barely reputable establishment he runs with his assistant, Jamison (Zeppo). When two conmen—Chico and Harpo—arrive at the hotel, no guest is safe from their scheming, including poor Mrs. Potter, played by the great Margaret Dumont, in her first of seven collaborations with the ridiculous brothers. Adapted from their Broadway musical comedy of the same name, The Cocoanuts is not so much a story with a plot as it is a cinematic stomping ground that allows the brothers’ comedic genius and showmanship to be on full display."
