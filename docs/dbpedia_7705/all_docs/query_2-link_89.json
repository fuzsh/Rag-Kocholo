For the sixth year the Academy altered this awkward format and moved from September 1, 1932 to December 31, 1933, and for the seventh year onward they followed the chronological year. As you can see, the first movie here is Carl Dreyer’s The Passion of Joan of Arc. Ordinarily, the Academy does not allow foreign films in languages other than English (none have ever won, and only seven have ever been nominated). Part of the purpose of my Academy awards is to change that.\n\n2 Actually the best performance was by Charles Chaplin in The Circus. However, the Academy has never given an award twice to an actor playing the same role. (It did give Marlon Brando and Robert DeNiro Oscars for playing the same character). I was tempted to argue that Chaplin deserved the award for The Circus and Modern Times, since in the first he is a tramp who becomes a clown, and the second a worker who becomes a tramp. But I thought better of it. For this William Powell, Myrna Loy, Nikolai Chersakov and Al Pacino only win once, while Groucho Marx and Fred Astaire also win once, because their various characters in the thirties are basically variations on the same person.\n\n3 Two exclamation marks (!!) means the performance is one of the 20 best actor or 20 best actresses and should not be missed on any account.\n\n4 When a Director’s name is not given, one can assume the director is the one who made the best picture of the year.\n\n5 And for the first time, I agree with the Academy for Best Picture and Best Director (and anything else, come to think of it).\n\n6 A plus sign (+) means either that I have not seen enough movies from that year to really have confidence in my judgment, or that there are important performances that year that I haven’t seen.\n\n7 Notwithstanding that, Louise Brooks becomes the first actress to win two Oscars.\n\n8 I am not systematically including best supporting acting, or other awards. Generally they go to actors or to movies who have not received sufficient recognition. And with one exception, they will not go to the winner of an actual oscar.\n\n9 Foreign films have a capricious record of being released in the United States. For example, Tokyo Story, one of the most admired films ever made, officially premiered in the United States 19 years after it was originally made. Film fans will realize that Grand Illusion was actually made in 1937, but it was nominated for the Oscars in 1938. In general, films will be considered for the year they were released. However an English-Language film will be considered for the year it was nominated for an Oscar (Casablanca won in 1943, and will win here as well, but it was actually first released in New York in 1942). Meanwhile a foreign film will be evaluated in the year it was nominated for either best picture, director, actor and actress. (Supporting actor and actress would have been considered, but no supporting actor in a foreign language film has ever been nominated, and the only supporting actress performance, Valentina Cortese’ in Day forNight, was in a film nominated for best director.) This leads to anomalies, such as Fellini’s Amarcord being made in 1973, winning the Best Foreign Language Film in 1974, and Fellini being nominated as best director in 1975, when the film met the eligibility rules. This means Fellini will be considered for 1975, or would be if I did not strongly dislike that movie.\n\n10 And Gabin becomes the first actor to win twice.\n\n11 As it happens, I must admit that I do not find John Ford very impressive. But as “big picture” “social issues” movies go, The Grapes of Wrath is actually fairly good, and a good example for the future, even if it more honored in the breech than in successful execution.\n\n12 And for the first time, I agree with the Academy for a Best Actor.\n\n13 Given that Casablanca is one of my favorite movies, some justification has to be given as to why I didn’t give its director the best director prize. Although the first scenes at Rick’s Café are remarkable, the movie was notoriously improvised, and its charms are a matter of considerable luck and chemistry. By contrast, Powell and Pressburger show a more inventive and challenging structure.\n\n14 I have seen Charles Coburn in the actual winner, The More the Merrier, and critics as varied as Danny Peary, David Thomson and Jonathan Rosenbaum have praised either him or the movie. But he is not as good as Rains, in perhaps the greatest supporting performance in all of film, and the most quotable (“I’d like to think that you killed a man: it’s the romantic in me.” “Make it ten: I’m only a poor corrupt official.” “But everyone’s having such a wonderful time.”)\n\n15 Three movies have won the biggest four Academy awards (Picture, Director, Actor and Actress): It Happened One Night, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest and The Silence of the Lambs. Whatever the (genuine) merits of these films, the last two are a poor choice for this particular honor, since the characters Louise Fletcher and Anthony Hopkins play are really supporting ones. Here is the first of my three choices to win the top four.\n\n16 The best movie made in 1946 was Eisenstein’s Ivan the Terrible, Part Two. Indeed it was such a good portrait of a megalomaniacal tyrant that it was promptly banned by the Soviet authorities for twelve years. By the time it was released it was not the best picture of the year. Besides, Eisenstein wouldn’t have benefited since he had been dead for a decade.\n\n17 The Academy was shabby in its treatment of Hawks. But where to praise him? Bringing up Baby is certainly the best American movie of 1938, but it’s not as good as Grand Illusion. His Girl Friday is certainly more enjoyable than The Grapes of Wrath , but despite Hawks’ change of the story and the way the dialogue is run together, he is still directing a movie that was (a) based on a stage play and (b) had already been filmed before. So I don’t think it was unfair to give Ford the award. So, I’ll give it to him here. After all Rope is also a filmed stage play, and Hitchcock will get his reward in due course.\n\n18 And for the first time, I agree with the Academy with its choice for Best Actress.\n\n19 And thereby becoming the worst movie to have a truly great performance.\n\n20 An asterisk (*) means I have not actually seen the best actor or actress of that year, and I may change my opinion if I did so.\n\n21 Fellini joins Ford in my pantheon of overrated directors, but this is an exception.\n\n22 At the time, Olivier was an obvious nominee over Anthony Perkins in Psycho. Perkins wasn’t nominated at all (though Janet Leigh was), while the winner was Burt Lancaster in Elmer Gantry. Now the position is reversed, and given the plague of serial killers in movies, and Olivier’s superior acting abilities, I’m not sure this is fair.\n\n23 And Hollywood finally produces a Best Actress after seven years overseas.\n\n24 Actually Andrei Rublev was made in 1966, immediately shelved for three years, and was officially “released” by being showing on the very last night of the 1969 Cannes film festival. It would take until 1971 for Russians and 1973 for Americans to see it.\n\n25 Now here is an award that calls out for a defense. 1974 was an unusually good year for acting performances. I haven’t seen the actual winner, Art Carney, in Harry and Tonto, but others have thought he gave a perfectly respectable performance that year. Dustin Hoffmann was also good as Lenny Bruce in Lenny. And Peter Falk gave his best performance ever in A Woman under the Influence, while Erland Josephson was superb in a not dissimilar role in Scenes from a Marriage. But the most admired performances of the year were the best single performance by the three greatest actors of my lifetime: Gene Hackman in The Conservation, Jack Nicholson in Chinatown, and Al Pacino in The Godfather Part II. Even more striking, while Hackman has been good is virtually everything he’s ever been in, Pacino’s and Nicholson’s performances are so different from the frankly hammy performances they would later show by the eighties. So how I can justify giving the award to Finney, who has already won from me, while Nicholson and Hackman don’t get a best actor award from me at all? In my defense, I would say Finney gave a remarkable performance. Here after all is a man best known for playing working class rebels portraying a fussy smug Belgian Catholic bourgeois. The two really have nothing in common aside from their height. And Poirot is more complex than he appears (or Christie thinks). Although he could easily give his solution to Bianchi and Dr. Constantine, he gives his solution to all the passengers in such a way as to torment them, simply so he can show off his brilliance. In his fine dress, meticulous attention to detail, carefully clipped speech, it is rather appropriate that he should show off in luxurious surroundings for the most elegant lynching in movie history.\n\n??\n\nLess than a minute into The Two Towers, I was grinning so hard my teeth hurt and my hands smacked together in an involuntary clap at what I saw. Even though I'd heard about it, read about it, I couldn't believe I was seeing it, feeling that fierce joy. There was --is-- no question: Peter Jackson has roared back into theatres with the mind-blowing Part Two of the greatest fantasy epic in movie history.\n\nThat was after sixty seconds. After 10,200 seconds, I staggered out of the theatre, just trying to absorb everything I'd seen between those first few electrifying moments and the final fade to black. I'm still absorbing.\n\nThe Two Towers is a huge film, big in every way; next to it, Fellowship feels like a light-hearted little Dungeons and Dragons caper. The landscapes are huge, yawning, swallowing up Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli in leagues and leagues of hard grassy plain, or stretching in blasted vastness away in front of Sam and Frodo. The armies are packed, seething, rumbling in their thousands. The scale and the complexity and the sheer energy and impact of the Helm's Deep siege is jaw-off-tearing. But it's not just the images and the scale that's bigger-- the stakes have gone up too. Where Fellowship was quest, Two Towers is war.\n\nWe know from watching Fellowship that Jackson is committted to taking the tiniest excuse from the book and blowing it up into the biggest, coolest action scene he can devise. Faced with one of the centerpiece battles of the Lord of the Rings, Jackson has given us a war like no other, with all the brutal reality of a fully realized medieval siege battle.\n\nIn pure Jackson style, the details blast out at every second -- the clang of the iron siege-ladder, the whistling of flocks of arrows, the crunch and crushing solidity of a falling boulder. Never has a seige battle been laid out with such attention to geometry, the specific layout of the battlefield. There was a time when this is how wars were fought, and this is what they looked like, orcs or not.\n\nBut Jackson's picture of war isn't merely glorious mayhem, rousing entertainment. This is war, huddled children in the keep, their mothers' eyes wide with fear and their imagined fate should the defences fail. This is young boys taking up swords and going to fight. This is being the weak, knowing you are about to be set upon by the strong. It's powerful, big stuff.\n\nAt the same time, Two Towers is colder, bluer, grayer. The first film ends with the breaking of the Fellowship, and in The Two Towers we feel its loss. The Two Towers doesn't have the warm camaraderie of Fellowship, the intimacy of character. We don't feel quite the same connection to our heroes as we did in the first film. Now hobbits and men and elf and dwarf are scattered across Middle Earth, not to mention the host of new characters to worry about. Fellowship had nine major players, plus a half-dozen others, and Two Towers adds some big ones --Theoden, Grima, Eowyn, Eomer, Faramir, Treebeard.\n\nAnd, of course, Gollum. Gollum is quite simply one of the great characters of English literature, the soul and source of the depth of Lord of the Rings that keeps readers coming back generation after generation. He is wretched, weak, ugly, inspiring contempt and disgust in not only all the supposedly good-hearted characters but also the reader. He is a liar and a murderer and a thief, a filthy stretched-out remnant of a person. Yet we are asked to see ourselves in him.\n\nThe Gollum we see in The Two Towers is so full, there's so much to him, you know you're only getting a hint of it the first time you see the film. I want the DVD right now so I can stare at him for hours. The moments of hope on his face are some of the purest and sweetest in the movie. Seeing it once is only scratching the surface."
