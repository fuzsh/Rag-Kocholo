        "text": "This page contains a catalog of Mystery Science Theater 3000 references to any of the Marx Brothers - as a group or individuals - including jokes and other material that has entered into the popular consciousness. This includes Groucho impressions, which can sometimes be a matter of the viewer's interpretation.\n\nThese references seem have been primarily inserted by Joel Hodgson and Frank Conniff, and they became less common after those people left the show. References to Animal Crackers far exceed any other Marx source, at more than three-to-one.\n\nKTMA[]\n\nK08 Gamera vs Guiron\n\n14:40 – “He’s got Groucho Marx eyebrows,” followed by, “I’ll bet Groucho’s pissed.” Cornjob does have heavy black eyebrows that go up and down. (Then a pause) “He doesn’t need them anymore.” Groucho had died about 10 years earlier.\n\nK11 Humanoid Woman\n\n19:48 – “It's Harpo's girlfriend.” The alien girl is plucking a harp.\n\nK14 Mighty Jack\n\n47:01 – “Major, Captain. Captain. Colonel. Colonel, Major. Sergeant, Captain. (Something), Colonel.” This could be a reference to Groucho bit in A Night at the Opera. As Groucho repeatedly bows, he introduces two characters: “Mrs. Claypool, Mr. Gottlieb. Mr. Gottlieb, Mrs. Claypool. Mrs. Claypool, Mr. Gottlieb. Mr. Gottlieb, Mrs. Claypool. Mrs. Claypool – I could go on like this all night, but it’s tough on my suspenders.” A similar bit appears in the 1985 comedy film Spies Like Us in which a number of doctors are introduced to each other by title only.\n\nClose – “That’s Mr. Golf Bag to you, buddy.” This joke is made by Groucho in Monkey Business. After a mob boss refers to him and Zeppo as Bozos, he replies, “That’s Mr. Bozos to you.”\n\nSeason 1[]\n\n101 The Crawling Eye\n\nSome viewers have speculated that Dr. Forrester’s makeover was meant to make him look more like Groucho. A mustache was added, and his eyebrows and eyeglasses became more prominent.\n\n37:17 – “It was a bizarre dream. You were all there – Fannie Flagg, and Groucho, and Carl Sagan. It was a Dick Cavett PBS special.” The scientist looks like Groucho, who was a friend of talk show host Dick Cavett.\n\n39:57 – “It’s Harpo.” Again, because the scientist looks like Groucho.\n\n103 Mad Monster\n\n09:11 – “How come they’ve got Groucho Marx mustaches on their helmets?” The helmet are equipped with what seem to be mouth vents, but they look like big black mustaches painted on.\n\n104 Women of the Prehistoric Planet\n\n12:10 – “Great gag.” A Marx connection is debatable. At the climax of Go West the Brothers are hijacking a train, tying up and gagging the engineer. “This is the best gag in the picture!” Groucho observes.\n\n106 The Slime People\n\n53:38 – “Don’t point that goat at me – it might go off!” An adaptation of Groucho’s exclamation to Sig Ruman, “Don’t point that beard at me – it might go off!” in A Day at the Races. Ruman, who was one of the few actors to share the screen with the Marxes three times, was pointing his Van Dyke at Groucho in indignation.\n\n109 Project Moonbase\n\n1:00:10 – “Major.” “Colonel.” “Doctor.” (Something) “Captain.” See Ep. K14. This may or may not be a similar reference.\n\n112 Untamed Youth\n\n59:51 – “Wear a necktie next time so I’ll know who’s you.” An adaptation of Groucho’s wooing of Margaret Dumont in The Cocoanuts. “Oh, I can see it now – you and the moon. Wear a necktie so I'll know you.”\n\n113 The Black Scorpion\n\n1:23:01 – “Well don’t ask Groucho.” The actor at far right on screen has a passing resemblance to an older Groucho.\n\nSeason 2[]\n\n201 Rocketship X-M\n\n09:28 – “Either this man is dead or my watch has stopped.” From Groucho’s medical examination of Harpo in A Day at the Races.\n\n1:32:31 – “If I hold you any tighter I’d be in back of you.” A paraphrase of Groucho in A Day at the Races, “If I hold you any closer, I’ll be in back of you.”\n\n203 Jungle Goddess\n\n24:17 – (In a matronly voice) “Oh, Capt. Spaulding!” A typical response by Margaret Dumont to Groucho in Animal Crackers. See also Ep. 205.\n\n36:05 – “That’s irrelephant!” A reference to Chico’s treason trial in Duck Soup. The routine is Chico: “Now I aska you one. What has a trunk, but no key, weighs 2,000 pounds and lives in a circus?” Prosecutor : “That's irrelevant.” Chico: “Irrelephant? Hey, that'sa the answer. There's a whole lotta irrelephants in the circus.”\n\n204 Catalina Caper\n\n35:05 – (In a Groucho voice) “This is the weirdest Lamaze class I’ve ever seen.” Based on the line, “That’s the most nauseating proposition I ever had,” from A Day at the Races.\n\n205 Rocket Attack USA\n\n08:25 – (In a matronly voice) “Oh, Professor Firefly, it’s not my size.” See Ep. 203. Crow conflates two of Groucho’s characters – he played Professor Wagstaff in Horse Feathers and President Firefly in Duck Soup.\n\n19:10 – \"Uh, that's Mr. Idiot to you, sir.\" See Ep. K14. An adaptation of Groucho.\n\nSegment 2 – The duck from Groucho’s game show You Bet Your Life would drop from the air with a money prize when a contestant said the secret word.\n\n206 Ring of Terror\n\n18:55 – (In a matronly voice) “Oh, Capt. Spaulding!” See Ep. 203.\n\n207 The Wild Rebels\n\n56:09 – “Wear a necktie so I know it’s you.” See Ep. 112. An adaptation of Groucho. The setup this time is a biker inviting the driver to go outside and “serenade the moon.”\n\n208 Lost Continent\n\n1:00:15 – Servo : “What about Hungerdunger?” Crow: “Oh, you left him out. And he’s the most important one, too.” A reference to the dictation scene in Animal Crackers, in which Groucho’s lawyers are the firm of Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, and McCormick.\n\n209 The Hellcats\n\n26:08 – “That reminds me, I must get my watch fixed!” A quote from Groucho in A Night in Casablanca, after watching Lisette Verea walk away from him.\n\n1:18:25 – “That’s Mr. Slob to you.” See Ep. K14.\n\n210 King Dinosaur\n\n14:37 – “Omitted the body of the letter, eh?” A reference to the dictation scene in Animal Crackers. Zeppo has informed Groucho that he didn’t think the body of the letter was important, so he left it out.\n\n17:34 – (In a Groucho voice) “And if his wife ever found out …!” (rim shot). The setup for this was “Joe had two children at that school.”\n\n34:46 – Servo: “What are you, man or mouse?” Crow: “Put some cheese down there and you’ll find out.” A bit of dialogue between Allan Jones and Groucho in A Day at the Races.\n\n211 First Spaceship to Venus\n\n1:00:53 – “Weeyuhd figguhs, straaange figguhs.” (exaggerrated pronunciation of \"Weird figures... Strange figures...\") As he was going into his “strange interlude” in Animal Crackers (inspired by the 1928 Eugene O'Neill play of that name), Groucho said this phrase, followed by reciting low stock prices.\n\n212 Godzilla vs. Megalon\n\n21:46 – (In a Groucho voice) “Say the secret word and win $100.” This is said in response to the kid saying “You bet your life,” the phrase that was used as the name of Groucho’s game show. See Ep. 205.\n\n213 Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster\n\n19:55 – “Marx Brothers.” The four male characters are on the screen together and Joel and the Bots are guessing who they are.\n\nSeason 3[]\n\n302 Gamera\n\n11:23 – “Groucho?” Servo says this after a man with a mustache appears.\n\n303 Pod People\n\n1:01:53 – “Make that three hard-boiled eggs.” From the state room scene in A Night at the Opera. As Groucho ordered room service for three stowaways, Chico (from behind a closed door) continually inserted “and two hard-boiled eggs,” at which Harpo would honk his bulb horn, eliciting this line.\n\n306 Time of the Apes\n\n26:16 – (Singing) “I cannot stay, I must be going.” A key line from the song “Hooray for Capt. Spaulding,” Groucho’s theme in Animal Crackers and later for his game show, You Bet Your Life. In the movie Capt. Spaulding had just arrived at a society party.\n\n308 Gamera vs. Gaos\n\n33:07 – “Hey, who invited the elephant? I guess that’s irrelevant.” See Ep. 203. An adaptation of Chico.\n\n50:22 – “She can’t take it there!” A reference to Chico calling the faux fight between Harpo and Margaret Dumont before the bridge game in Animal Crackers.\n\n310 Fugitive Alien\n\n19:09 – “What’s the capital of South Dakota?” Based on a possibly apocryphal story of Groucho's youth. A group of friends took him to a seance, and when the medium claimed to have made contact with the spirit world, she asked if anyone had a question for the dead. The skeptical Groucho suggested, “What is the capital of North Dakota?”\n\n312 Gamera vs. Guiron\n\n31:24 – “Hungerdunger … Hungerdunger …” See Ep. 208.\n\n1:20:33 – “Okay, what’s the password, swordfish?” From the speakeasy scene from Horse Feathers. Chico is in charge of not letting anyone in without saying “swordfish,” and the bit goes on from there, including Harpo pulling out a sword and huge fish from his coat. Chico eventually inadvertently reveals the password.\n\n314 Mighty Jack\n\n1:20:44 – “Try swordfish.” See Ep. 312.\n\n315 Teenage Caveman\n\n16:21 – Crow: “And two hard-boiled eggs.” Tom: “Honk!” Crow: “Make that three hard-boiled eggs.” See Ep. 303.\n\nSegment 2 – “Oh, he can’t take it there!” See Ep. 308.\n\n316 Gamera vs. Zigra\n\n20:27 – “That reminds me, I must get my watch fixed.” See Ep. 209.\n\n25:22 – “Home of the Algonquin Round Table.” See Ep. 207.\n\n30:22 – “Mrs. Rittenhouse.” Margaret Dumont’s character in Animal Crackers. Considering the fish dock, the joke here may be based on the storm scene, in which Harpo produces a fish (among other things) when Chico asks for a “flash”(light). Groucho later finds the fish and asks, “Pardon me Mrs. Rittenhouse, did you lose a fish?”\n\n1:25:53 – “Whoa, he can’t take it there! He can’t take it there!” See Ep. 308. An adaptation of Chico.\n\n317 The Saga of the Viking Women and Their Voyage to the Waters of the Great Sea Serpent\n\n55:00 – “Three cheers for Capt. Spaulding!” A line from the parlor scene in Animal Crackers, spoken by Louis Sorin. In response, Harpo brings in three chairs.\n\n1:03:07 – (In a Groucho voice) “You’ll never go back to the other kind. Wooo!” This is in response to the line, “Once you’ve known a Grimolt warrior …”\n\n1:34:19 – (Singing) “I cannot stay, I must be going.” See Ep. 306.\n\n318 Star Force: Fugitive Alien II\n\nSegment 2 – ”Hey buddy, can you spare some change? I want a cup of coffee.” This may be an adaptation of a down-and-out guy’s request of Harpo in Horse Feathers, which leads to Harpo pulling a steaming cup out of his pocket.\n\n320 The Unearthly\n\n51:17 – “Either he’s dead or my watch has stopped.” See Ep. 201.\n\n51:55 – “Anything further, Father?” Zeppo asks this of Groucho in Horse Feathers.\n\n55:23 – Crow: “I’m sorry, I can’t think of the ending.” Servo: “I can’t think of anything else.” This is a paraphrase of an exchange between Chico and Groucho from the parlor scene in Animal Crackers. Chico, playing the piano, says “I can’t think of the finish,” and Groucho replies, “That’s strange and I can’t think of anything else.”\n\n56:08 – “Why, are you coming apart?” This is a line from A Night at Casablanca, when Lisette Verea invites Groucho to dine with “Will you join us?” Crow recognizes the straight line was wrong and says, “Oh, that’s a different joke.”\n\n321 Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\n\n42:21 – Servo: “Walk this way.” Crow: (In a Groucho voice) “If I could walk that way I wouldn’t be wearing the box.”\n\n48:28 – “What is that, the Groucho duck up there?” Joel is referring to a boom mic, but the scientist does resemble Groucho. See Ep. 205.\n\n1:06:40 – Crow: “And two hard-boiled eggs.” Tom: “Honk!” Crow: “Make that three hard-boiled eggs.” See Ep. 303.\n\n323 The Castle of Fu Manchu\n\n48:17 – “You inspect her, I’m busy.” This is a paraphrase of an exchange between Groucho and a police inspector investigating the theft of the valuable painting in Animal Crackers.\n\n1:22:44 – “Not da fish, da flash!” A reference to the storm scene in Animal Crackers. See Ep. 316.\n\nClose – “You know at Arby’s, when I worked there, I was so funny my nickname was Zeppo.” Zeppo is often dismissed as having been the unfunny Marx Brother, though was a credible leading man, and an effective straight man for Groucho.\n\n324 Master Ninja II\n\n18:45 – “Hey, it’s Chico Marx.” A woman entering the factory wears a hat similar to Chico’s typical Tyrolean.\n\n27:34 – Crow: “And, uh, two hard-boiled eggs.” Tom: “Honk!” Crow: “Make that three hard-boiled eggs.” See Ep. 303.\n\nSeason 4[]\n\n401 Space Travelers\n\n22:39 – “The party of the first part who in this part will be known …” An adaptation of Groucho’s line in the contract scene from A Night at the Opera, played with Chico: “The party of the first part will be known as the party of the first part …”\n\n59:56 – “Ya say the magic word and ya got a $100.” See Ep. 205.\n\n1:18:45 – “If I was any closer I’d be behind you.” See Ep. 201.\n\n402 The Giant Gila Monster\n\n57:31 – “Here comes Zeppo.” The lead actor has Zeppo’s clean-cut appearance and somewhat bland demeanor.\n\n403 City Limits\n\n19:48 – “I can’t get down, I’m stuck up here!” In At the Circus, Groucho is walking on the ceiling with Eve Arden when she leaves him hanging, and he recites a litany of lines including “I’m stuck up here” and “Help me down.”\n\n1:19:22 – (In a Groucho voice) “Once I shot an elephant in my pajamas.” A paraphrase of Groucho’s line in Animal Crackers, “One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas.” which he follows with “How he got in my pajamas, I don’t know.”\n\n404 Teenagers from Outer Space\n\n56:17 – (In a matronly voice) “Nobody asked for a ray gun, put that right away …” An adaptation of Margaret Dumont in Animal Crackers during the parlor scene when Harpo brings in three chairs: “No one asked for the chairs, you put them right back where you found them, now get out, get out.” See Ep. 317.\n\n1:23:57 – “Oh, well, there’s got to be at least two more Russian aviators in that thing.” A reference to A Night at the Opera in which stowaways Chico, Harpo and Allan Jones sneak off a ship by pretending to be a trio of famous Russian aviators, with notable beards. See also Ep. 505.\n\n405 Being From Another Planet\n\n26:54 – Crow: “And get me two hard-boiled eggs!” Servo: “Honk.” Crow: “Make that three hard-oiled eggs.” See Ep. 303.\n\n1:03:51 – (Singing) “I’m against it.” This is from Groucho’s feature song in Horse Feathers (also a college picture), “Whatever It Is, I’m Against It”. The line in the film that leads to this is “Whatever it is, …”\n\n407 Killer Shrews\n\n12:04 – “She can’t take it there!” See Ep. 308.\n\n14:09 – “Even George S. Kaufman won a prize.” See Ep. 206. The young guy looks like Kaufman.\n\n408 Hercules Unchained\n\n53:38 – “Jeez, he’s turning into Harpo.” One of Harpo’s earliest defining characteristics in films was being a woman-chaser, though that aspect of his character was toned down in subsequent movies.\n\n409 Indestructible Man\n\n11:00 – “Weeyuhd prisoners.” See Ep. 211. An adaptation of Groucho. The set-up line from the film is “… we’re returning with strange prisoners.”\n\n11:59 – “Weeyuhd captives.” See above. This time the lead-in is “Strange captives.”\n\n15:52 – “That’s Mr. Stinkin’ Rotten Mouthpiece to you!” See Ep. K14.\n\n410 Hercules Against the Moon Men\n\n38:32 – “I can’t think of anything else.” See Ep. 320. The lead-in line from the film is, “We’ve got to think about your wound.”\n\n412 Hercules and the Captive Women\n\n27:01 – “It’s the turkey from Room Service!” Room Service featured the Brothers and Frank Albertson trying to avoid being evicted from their hotel room. In one scene a live turkey created havoc in the room.\n\n414 Tormented\n\n1:15:24 – “Either this man is dead or my watch has stopped.” See Ep. 201.\n\n417 Crash of the Moons\n\n30:14 – (In a Groucho voice) “Say the secret word, and Bill Cosby rips your show off.” See Ep. 205. During MST3K’s fourth season, Cosby was hosting a reboot of You Bet Your Life. The reference is to the equipment descending from the ceiling.\n\n418 Attack of the the Eye Creatures\n\n1:22:04 – “Weeyuhd creatuhs.” See Ep. 211.\n\n419 The Rebel Set\n\n25:45 – “I replaced Gummo.” The riff is in reply to a line in the movie, “How’d you get into the act?” Gummo was the straight-man Marx Brother in their early vaudeville days, but dropped out of the act when the U.S. entered World War I. He was replaced by Zeppo, who was 17 years old at the time. They later went into business together as talent agents.\n\n1:21:31 – “Whoa, ho, he can’t take it there!” See Ep. 308.\n\n420 The Human Duplicators\n\n47:05 – “How come I never get a nurse like that?” A Marx connection is flimsy. This could be an adaptation of Groucho’s character in A Day at the Races, Dr. Hugo Hackenbush. During the examination scene a nurse helps prep Harpo and exits somehow relieved of her dress, revealing an elaborate slip. Groucho peers at her through some medical equipment and says, “How is it a dame like that never gets sick?”\n\n421 Monster A-Go-Go\n\n47:12 – “Well thank you, Pinky!” Harpo’s character in Duck Soup is called Pinky, and he’s the driver for President Firefly’s car (a motorcycle with sidecar).\n\n422 The Day the Earth Froze\n\n44:55 – (In a matronly voice) “Nobody asked for a goose, you take that right away.” See Ep. 404.\n\n49:28 – “Be careful, that’s nitric acid. We don’t have very much.” Probably inspired by Groucho in A Day At the Races, telling Harpo “Hey, don’t drink that poison. It’s four dollars an ounce.”\n\n424 Manos: the Hands of Fate\n\n06:52 – “I may be wonderful, but I think you’re wrong.” A quote from Groucho in Animal Crackers, which was a play on the popular 1929 song \"I May Be Wrong (but I Think You're Wonderful)\".\n\nSeason 5[]\n\n501 Warrior of the Lost World\n\nSegment 2 – “I couldn’t beat Margaret Dumont!” Ms. Dumont was matronly and unathletic.\n\n26:56 – “Why, are they falling apart?” See Ep. 320.\n\n1:26:03 – “Pippo – the Marx Brother nobody liked.” In chronological order, they were Chico, Harpo, Groucho, Gummo and Zeppo. One story claims that these named are from a Vaudeville-era poker game during which a performer named Art Fisher (who had a habit of giving people nicknames) applied these names (except Zeppo) as he dealt cards, all being based on a comic strip character called Knocko the Monk.\n\n502 Hercules\n\n12:02 – “Excuse me while I have a strange interlude.” A paraphrase of Groucho’s line in Animal Crackers, “Pardon me while I have a strange interlude,” before he breaks the fourth wall. See Ep. 211.\n\n33:45 – “You know, either this man is dead or my sundial has stopped.” See Ep. 201.\n\n503 Swamp Diamonds\n\n38:37 – “Upp, she can’t take it there. She can’t take it there.” See Ep. 308.\n\n504 Secret Agent Super Dragon\n\nInvention Exchange – Frank’s Virtual Comedy machine includes Groucho glasses.\n\n1:15:09 – “(Gasp) Ze Beaugard! Ze Beaugard! Ze Beaugard! Zat is not my Beaugard!” From Animal Crackers, when the fictional painting After the Hunt by the fictional artist Beaugard is revealed at Mrs. Rittenhouse’s party. The last exclamation quotes Louis Sorin, who realizes his painting has been replaced, the central plot point of the movie.\n\n505 The Magic Voyage of Sinbad\n\nSegment 3 – Joel’s repeated requests for water may be a reference to the scene in A Night at the Opera in which Chico, Harpo and Allan Jones pose as long-bearded Russian aviators in order to get off the ship they stowed away on. Harpo, when called upon to make a speech, instead poured and drank so many glasses of water that it sloshed over on his beard and washed it off. This would also touch upon the Russian nature of the film. See Ep. 404.\n\n1:08:11 – “Harpo’s coming! Honk honk honk!” Because the women are screaming. See Ep. 408.\n\n1:08:33 – “Now Harpo’s after the guys!” See above.\n\n507 I Accuse My Parents\n\n40:06 – (In a Groucho voice) “This is her over here. Isn’t she beautiful? Take a look.” Not a specific Groucho line, but this kind of banter was typical.\n\n54:03 – (In a Groucho voice) “What’s the secret word? Say the secret word and win a hundred dollars.” The teller looks like an elder Groucho. See Ep. 205.\n\n1:03:08 – “Oh, it’s the three hard-boiled eggs she ordered.” Her door buzzer sounds similar to Harpo’s horn. See Ep. 303.\n\n1:05:27 – “Zey stole ze Beaugard! – Ze Beaugard!” The crooks have a crate made for packing a framed painting. See Ep. 504.\n\n508 Operation Double 007\n\n52:15 – (In a Groucho voice) “Dressed as show girls.” The riff is in response to the line “… the experiments our technicians have been carrying out …”\n\n509 The Girl in Lover’s Lane\n\n45:40 – “It’ll be you, me and the moon. You wear a necktie so I’ll know you.” See Ep. 112.\n\n510 Lassie: The Painted Hills\n\n1:12:34 – “Either this boy’s dead or his heart has stopped.” See Ep. 201.\n\n511 Gunslinger\n\nInvention Exchange – As TV Frank’s head is being scanned at the end, he is “throwing a Gookie,” the way Harpo imitated the facial expression of a tobacconist from the brothers’ childhood neighborhood.\n\n512 Mitchell\n\n49:50 – (In a matronly voice) “Nobody asked for a prostitute …” See Ep. 404.\n\n1:00:17 – (Singing) “Sweet Adeline”: the opening to Monkey Business where the Brothers are singing within barrels in which they stowed away on an ocean liner.\n\n514 Teen-Age Strangler\n\n14:45 – (In a matronly voice) “Capt. Spaulding!” Servo mocks the woman’s tone of voice. See Ep. 203.\n\n515 The Wild, Wild World of Batwoman\n\n59:16 – (In a matronly voice) “Capt. Spaulding!” Crow mocks the doctor’s tone of voice. See Ep. 203.\n\n519 The Atomic Brain\n\n46:18 – Crow sings the tune to “Hooray for Capt. Spaulding” as the old lady walks across screen in a Groucho-like stoop. See Ep. 306.\n\n520 Radar Secret Service\n\n49:50 – “And never darken my carpets again!” A paraphrase of Groucho’s parting shot to Louis Calhern after peace talks fail in Duck Soup: “Go, and never darken my towels again.”\n\n1:05:10 – “Take it there!” See Ep. 308. This adaptation of Chico is debatable.\n\n523 Village of the Giants\n\n08:12 – “If those pants were any tighter they’d be behind her.” See Ep. 201.\n\n16:13 – (In a Groucho voice) “This isn’t kosher, I shouldn’t be eating this.” Crow speaks for the ducks, assuming they’re Jewish like Groucho. There’s a connection to Groucho’s game show You Bet Your Life; see Ep. 205.\n\nSeason 6[]\n\n604 Zombie Nightmare\n\n26:51 – “Mr. Peters, Mr. Hurley. Mr. Hurley, Mr. Peters.” See Ep. K14.\n\n605 Colossus and the Headhunters\n\n31:26 – “I’m having a strange interlude.” See Ep. 502.\n\n608 Code Name: Diamond Head\n\n1:12:36 – “If those pants were any tighter they’d be behind her.” See Ep. 201.\n\n609 The Skydivers\n\nSegment 1 – One of Dr. Forrester’s moves in his victory dance mimics Groucho during “Hooray for Capt. Spaulding” in Animal Crackers (see video above). It was most-likely standard vaudeville fare, but Groucho’s performance is the earliest filmed version widely available.\n\n610 The Violent Years\n\n16:28 – (In a Groucho voice) “Why, what are all these gin bottles doing in here?” Crow’s voice is close enough to be considered an impersonation.\n\n28:00 – “I’m weeyuhd.” See Ep. 211.\n\n57:02 – “Isn’t that Harpo on the right there?” The girl’s hair resembles Harpo's curly blond wig.\n\n58:43 – “Beat it, Harpo. (honk honk)” See above.\n\n613 The Sinister Urge\n\n1:04:49 – (In a Groucho voice) “Say the secret word and get killed by a psycho.” See Ep. 205. The riff is apparently inspired by the presence of ducks.\n\n616 Racket Girls\n\n28:48 – “Hey, it’s Harpo!” Harpo wore a blond wig in most of his movies because his red wig from their stage productions photographed too dark.\n\n35:52 – “Baravelli?” A reference to Chico, whose character name in Horse Feathers was Baravelli. Joe's short stature and thick accent are reminiscent of Chico’s Italian character.\n\n48:11 – “I get my partner Rusty. Hey, Rusty! (Honk)” A reference to Chico, whose business partner in A Night in Casablanca was Harpo’s character, Rusty. See above.\n\n48:44 – “Would you take off the rubber nose and glasses please?” Mike invokes the classic Groucho glasses novelty item. The flunky resembles Groucho, including the cigar.\n\n50:27 – “Oh, Professor Firefly!” See Ep. 203. & 205.\n\n617 The Sword and the Dragon\n\n29:35 – “Oh, Capt. Spaulding!” See Ep. 203. A matron faints.\n\n30:17 – “Mrs. Rittenhouse!” See Ep. 316. A matron smooches a guy.\n\n1:09:47 – “He’s got all our spoons.” Although they’re not falling from the character’s sleeve, this is a reference to Harpo at the end of Animal Crackers. As the police inspector exhorts him to follow a virtuous life, stolen silverware continuously clatters to the floor from Harpo’s coat sleeve.\n\n619 Red Zone Cuba\n\n34:46 – “Montreal.” A reference to the parlor scene in Animal Crackers. Chico is at the piano, and Groucho requests that song about Montreal, “I’m a Dreamer, Montreal” which is a pun on a popular song at the time - “I’m a Dreamer, Aren’t We All?” from the early movie musical Sunny Side Up.\n\nClose – As he is choked by Forrester, Frank is “throwing a Gookie.” See Ep. 511.\n\n623 The Amazing Transparent Man\n\n24:03 – (In a Groucho voice) “Other than the father at the moment of conception.”\n\n624 Samson vs. the Vampire Women\n\n15:44 – “Ah, yes, the three Russian aviators.” See Ep. 404. There are three corpses present.\n\n49:27 – (In a Groucho voice) “I’d like to apologize in advance for our wedding night.”\n\nMST3K: The Movie[]\n\nThis Island Earth\n\n57:35 – “Glad to meetchya.” A Marx connection is debatable, but this exchange, built upon the movie line “Dr. Meacham,” reflects Chico in Go West: “Mr. Beech’a, we’re here to meetchya.”\n\nSeason 7[]\n\n701 Night of the Blood Beast\n\nSegment 2 – As the song wraps up, the lyric is heard, “We’ll line you up against the wall and pop! goes the weasel.” This paraphrases Groucho’s signature song from Duck Soup, “Just Wait ’Til I Get Through With It.” The song explains the consequences of being on the wrong side of a decision: “We’ll line him up against the wall and pop! goes the weasel.”\n\n702 The Brute Man\n\n49:17 – “Harpo!” At the climax of Horse Feathers, Harpo makes a series of touchdowns simply by catching footballs and setting them down beyond the goal line.\n\n703 Deathstalker and the Warriors From Hell\n\n52:39 – “Is my Aunt Minnie in there?” In the state room scene of A Night at the Opera, as the room fills up, a random woman comes in and asks “Is my Aunt Minnie in here?” to which Groucho says, “If she isn’t in here, you can probably find someone just as good.”\n\n704 The Incredible Melting Man\n\n31:10 – “You’ve met Lydia.” A reference to “Lydia the Tattooed Lady”, Groucho’s signature song from At The Circus. Coming off of the movie’s line “Oh, uh …” the riff reflects the song’s opening line, “Lydia, oh Lydia, oh have you met Lydia …”\n\n705 Escape 2000\n\n1:22:21 – “Is there a bug on my shoulder?” The man has a gun pointing at his face. The possible Marx connection is that in Animal Crackers Captain Spaulding faints when a caterpillar is found on his lapel.\n\nSeason 8[]\n\n801 Revenge of the Creature\n\n1:00:30 – “Ah, can’t you see what I’m trying to tell you, Mrs. Claypool, I love you.” A paraphrase of Groucho from Duck Soup. Groucho said something like this to Margaret Dumont in every movie they appeared in together; the direct quote referenced here is “Can’t you see what I’m trying to tell you, I love you.” These sentiments always followed some sort of insult. Here Servo mixes in Dumont’s character name from A Night at the Opera.\n\n806 The Undead\n\nSegment 2 – The spoons fall from Servo’s sleeve just as they did from Harpo’s sleeve at the end of Animal Crackers. See Ep. 617.\n\n47:50 – “A strange interlude.” See Ep. 502.\n\n1:08:18 – “That encyclo-pidia.” See Ep. 704. This is in response to the line “Yes, Livia.” One line in “Lydia the Tattooed Lady” is “Lydia, oh Lydia, that encyclo-pidia …”\n\n808 The She Creature\n\n10:34 – (In a matronly voice) “Oh, Professor Firefly!” See Ep. 203. & Ep. 205.\n\n38:42 – “Weeyuhd figgahs.” See Ep. 211.\n\n53:26 – “The only person who can save our country is Rufus T. Firefly.” A summation of Margaret Dumont’s general attitude in the opening scene of Duck Soup.\n\n811 Parts: The Clonus Horror\n\n1:18:26 – “And never darken my towels again.” See Ep. 520.\n\n813 Jack Frost\n\n08:33 – “Back into Harpo’s chest.” In Duck Soup, Harpo reveals a tattoo of a dog house on his chest. A dog emerges and barks at Groucho.\n\n817 Horror at Party Beach\n\n53:52 – Mike sings the tune to “Hooray for Capt. Spaulding” as the monsters cross the screen in a Groucho-like stoop. See Ep. 306.\n\n818 Devil Doll\n\n36:22 – “The Margaret Dumont Society expresses its appreciation.” The SOL crew had previously identified the crowd as the League of Dowagers.\n\n820 Space Mutiny\n\n31:13 – “Ah, he’s above the stage. Now he’s going to fall right in right at the end of the opera.” A Marx connection might be debatable, but this is what happens to the brothers at the climax of A Night at the Opera. A similar event occurs with a chandelier in the novel The Phantom of the Opera and it various adaptations (including a lavish stage musical in which a chandelier falls into the audience).\n\n822 Overdrawn at the Memory Bank\n\n32:24 – “Initiate Harpo hair.” The woman onscreen has curly hair.\n\nSeason 9[]\n\n901 The Projected Man\n\n1:07:02 – “Inspect her yourself.” See Ep. 323. This is the exact exchange.\n\n904 Werewolf\n\n56:57 – “Can’t you see I’m trying to tell you I love you.” See Ep. 801.\n\n907 Hobgoblins\n\n38:11 – “Make that three hard-boiled eggs.” Because the hobgoblin is using a bulb horn like Harpo. See Ep. 303.\n\n39:38 – “Can’t you see I’m trying to tell you I love you.” See Ep. 801.\n\n910 The Final Sacrifice\n\n20:42 – “This script was punched up by Harpo Marx.” After a long period of no dialog. Harpo's characters typically did not speak in any of their productions. Some fans believed that he was mute in real life as well.\n\n911 Devil Fish\n\n1:24:12 – “It’s Harpo!” The guy on screen looks somewhat similar to Harpo.\n\nSeason 10[]\n\n1004 Future War\n\n1:19:34 – “Careful, that chin might go off.” See Ep. 106.\n\n1005 Blood Waters of Dr. Z\n\n40:05 – “Can’t you see I’m trying to tell you I love you.” See Ep. 801.\n\n1009 Hamlet\n\n1:26:39 – “Captain Spaulding, Captain Kangaroo, Cap'n Crunch.” This is in response to the line, “Let four captains bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage.” Captain Spaulding was Groucho’s character in Animal Crackers.\n\n1010 It Lives By Night\n\n20:10 – (In a matronly voice) “Oh, Professor Firefly!” See Ep. 203. & Ep. 205.\n\nSeason 11[]\n\n1102 Cry Wilderness\n\n40:18 – “Hey! I found a comedy schnozz with a mustache over here! Think there’s a connection?” See Ep. 504. There was a pair of glasses in the shot before.\n\n1108 The Loves of Hercules\n\n33:35 – “Have you seen Zeppo?” This is in response to Philoctetes calling out to Licos (pronounced Lee-co).\n\n1110 Wizards of the Lost Kingdom I\n\n1:04:10 – “With Margaret Dumont as the Black Knight.” An imposing figure in long robes is striding regally across screen.\n\n1114 At the Earth’s Core\n\n27:12 – “Black Harpo. Wow.” and a moment later, “Black Harpo is everywhere. Honk honk.” One of the humanoid races held captive is dark-skinned men wearing curly wigs.\n\n1:17:29 – “Oh, yeah, this is like that scene with the Marx Brothers where they’re acting like they’re the same reflection in a mirror. Duck Soup, right?” A couple of characters are sliding along the floor in sync; there is one moment in the mirror scene where Groucho and Harpo are both on the floor.\n\nSeason 12[]\n\n1202 Atlantic Rim\n\n17:12 – (In a Groucho voice) “I still haven’t seen it for the first time!” This is in answer to the line, “I’ve never seen something like this before.”\n\n1203 Lords of the Deep\n\nSegment 4 – “Groucho, Harpo, Chico, Zeppo …” See Ep. 501."
