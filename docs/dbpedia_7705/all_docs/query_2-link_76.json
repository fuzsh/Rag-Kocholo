        "text": "Woody Allen once famously remarked that Groucho Marx will still be funny a thousand years from now. We have to agree. Some things are just timeless. And even though Mr. Marx left our company over 40 years ago, we feel he has definitely earned his place in film history – and is clearly deserving of a post in this space. While not every one of the movies Groucho made with his brothers qualifies as a “classic,” the few earning that esteemed label contain some of the funniest moments ever committed to celluloid. We’ll take a look at them, and if you’re so inclined, help you identify those titles worth seeking out. We don’t think you’ll be sorry.\n\nGroucho Marx was born on October 2nd, 1890, into a poor neighborhood on New York’s upper East side. Both his parents were Jewish and had previously emigrated from Germany. His real name was Julius Henry, and he was the third of five brothers. Originally, Julius wanted to be a doctor, but due to his family’s extreme poverty, was pulled out of high school by his mother in order to earn money with his brothers as a “performer.”\n\nIt was the age of vaudeville and the self-taught Marx brothers pulled themselves together to form an “act.” Julius had a pretty good singing voice, while older brothers Leonard and Adolph became adept on the piano and harp, respectively. Somewhere along the line, they adopted new stage names… Julius became “Groucho” because he had a caustic sense of humor…. Leonard became “Chico” because he was a notorious womanizer who was always chasing “the chicks”… and Adolph became “Harpo” because he was so good playing that particular instrument. (Trivia Note: For years, everyone has incorrectly pronounced “Chico” as “Cheeko” because of the fake Italian accent he adopted. He was always referred to as “Chicko” by his friends and brothers. Harpo on the other hand was always recognized as a master of the harp… and since he was self-taught, it wasn’t until years later he discovered he had been playing the instrument backwards all along).\n\nDuring those early years, the three brothers led a hard life on the vaudeville circuit. They formed loose relationships with other crooners and dancers, and criss-crossed the country giving performances in a variety of seedy hotels, pool halls, and school gymnasiums. Years later, Groucho would recount dozens of stories of unethical managers who would cheat them out of their meager pay or establishments that would steal all their belongings while the trio was performing on stage. On many nights, the brothers were just grateful to get a single bed and a hot meal in return for putting on a show. This hand to mouth existence went on for over a decade during the early 1910s.\n\nOn one circuit, the Marx Brothers were performing with a young male “lead singer.” Each was being paid $35 a night. However, right before going on stage in front of packed house full of college students at the University of Illinois, the “lead” decided to engage in a bit of blackmail. He announced that unless the other three members of the group each chipped in $5 to pay him $50 a show, he was going to refuse to go on.\n\nAfter years of being abused and pushed around by unethical people, the Marx Brothers had finally had enough. They told their “star” to hit the bricks, and took to the stage on their own for the first time. Inexperienced in playing a lead role, they resorted to some impromptu slapstick to hold the audience’s attention. Groucho would push Chico off his stool while he was trying to play the piano, the two would engage in impromptu verbal banter, and Harpo would keep interrupting the show with all sorts of shenanigans. The students ate it up. And with that, the Marx Brothers crossed an important threshold. As Groucho remembered years later:\n\n“I know this may not seem terribly important, but it was all-important to us. It was actually our point of departure, our coming our age, our first timid step over that mysterious line that divides the small time from the big time. For the first time in our career, we realized that we could succeed as an act without an outside help… we were THE MARX BROTHERS.”\n\nAs their confidence grew, the brothers began to grow into their respective roles: Groucho became the wise-cracking and cynical commentator, Chico the ill-educated con man, and Harpo, the silent agent of chaos. Each had their own “wardrobe” and Groucho’s consisted of a pair of bushy eyebrows along with a big black mustache. The problem was the glue which was needed to hold the extra hair in place. Show after show… night after night… he literally had to rip his skin off when removing the mustache. One evening, the trio got held up by some poor service at a local eating establishment. They raced into the back of the theater where they were performing just as they heard their entrance cue. Groucho didn’t have time to make it to his dressing room to put on his disguise, so he grabbed some black greasepaint a backstage carpenter was using and daubed it over his upper lip.\n\nThe crowd never noticed. And the show still went over well. The theater manager complained bitterly, but Groucho told him it he’d quit before permanently scarring his upper lip. And from that night forward, it was greasepaint all the way. (Until Groucho decided to grow a real mustache in his later years…)\n\nMeanwhile, Chico began to urge the trio to try their luck on Broadway. This was a huge leap, since even the smallest of Broadway shows called for a huge financial investment. Groucho told Chico to forget it… but the latter had an angle to play. While engaging in his favorite pastime of losing money at poker, Chico had made the acquaintance of a certain celebrity: none other than the largest pretzel manufacturer in Hackensack, New Jersey. The married pretzel king confided to Chico that he had a lady friend on the side who had been teasing him with amorous advances. She had told him that in order to seal the deal, Mr. Pretzel needed to put her in a Broadway show as a dancer.\n\nChico told the guy he and his brothers would be glad to make the girlfriend part of their act, provided he put up the money necessary to launch the production. They estimated this would cost about $25,000. A deal was struck, and soon the Marx Brothers were calling in favors from every set decorator, carpenter, and choreographer they had ever met on the vaudeville circuit. But even with this barest of budgets, they still ran $10,000 into debt by the time opening night rolled around. When they went back to the pretzel king for more money, he told them they would see the extra dough as soon as he saw his girlfriend on stage.\n\nUnfortunately, when it came time for rehearsals, it turned out the aspiring hoofer had zero talent. Groucho later said she danced as though she had “borrowed her legs from her grandfather.” What the Marxs did have going for them, however, was 15 years of comedy material they had tested and honed in front of countless audiences across the country. Still, they had a problem. Their creditors were starting to hound them for the missing money, and they were unlikely to get a cash infusion from their benefactor if the show closed as a result of the girl with two left feet.\n\nSometimes it’s funny to see how fate plays a hand. After a couple of weeks, the pretzel manufacturer stopped by to see his would-be squeeze in action. But in the meantime, she had fallen for one of the chorus boys and indelicately informed her sugar daddy that not only did she not love him, but he had been using him all along as a stepping stone to a stage career. Now that she as about to become “a star,” his services were no longer needed. Imagine the Marx Brothers surprise when Mr. Pretzel came and told him that he was going to give them the check for the extra $10,000 if they DIDN’T let his former girlfriend go on stage.\n\nThe three brothers breathed a collective sigh of relief. When they told their dancing star she was out of the production, she replied it was no problem. And that there were plenty of productions that could use her talents. Two weeks later, Groucho ran into her again. She was waiting tables at a Manhattan restaurant. He later claimed that she, more than anyone else, was responsible for the Marx Brother’s subsequent success.\n\nEven bigger productions followed and soon Groucho and company had the biggest writers in the business helping pen material for them. One of them was George S. Kaufman, who wrote two musical comedies for the group: “The Cocoanuts” in 1925, and “Animal Crackers” in 1928. Both were huge hits and cemented the Marx Brothers as one of the top acts on Broadway.\n\nIt wasn’t long until the movies came calling. Paramount Studios signed the Marxs to a five picture deal, starting with their two biggest Broadway hits. Both movies were huge smashes, even if they seem incredibly dated by today’s standards. It was the dawn of the sound film, and most movies at that time were shot with stationery cameras plopped in front of an all talking cast. Both The Cocoanuts (1929) and Animal Crackers (1930) suffer from this affliction. It’s also interesting that both were shot in New York. The jokes are funny enough. But the movies look like photographed stage plays more than classic examples of film history.\n\nOne of the more interesting things to look for in “The Cocoanuts” is the scene where Groucho unfolds a set of blueprints. They look like they’re dripping wet. That’s because they were. One of the problems with the microphones in early sound films was their inability to “filter” out background noise. When Groucho rustled the papers, it drowned out all the dialogue. So, they dunked them in vegetable oil. (If you ever want an entertaining lesson in the sound-related problems the film industry dealt with during the 1929-1930 time frame, we can highly recommend watching Singing in the Rain. It’s probably more instructive on this subject than any film class.)\n\n“Animal Crackers” is similar in structure: funny jokes, but it feels at times like you’re watching the proceedings from a theater seat. And, to be fair, “Animal Crackers” also gave us Groucho’s inimitable “Hooray for Captain Spaulding” song which once stuck in your head will absolutely refuse to leave. (Hooray for Captain Spaulding, the African explorer. Did someone call me schnorer?, hooray, hooray hooray!)\n\nStill, with these two films, some key elements fell into place for the Marx Brothers’ subsequent film career. The first was the casting of one of their chief foils, Margaret Dumont. (More about her in a minute.) Secondly, Groucho, Chico, and Harpo realized they needed a straight man to play off of. So, they recruited their youngest brother, Zeppo, to fill that role. The chemistry worked. As the baby of the family, Zeppo would go on to star in a total of five films with his older siblings. (Trivia time…who can name the fifth Marx Brother? He never appeared in any of their films, but had a very successful career as a theatrical agent… Answer: Gummo!!)\n\nIt was also around this time that Groucho’s finances became a casualty of the stock market crash. Seems that he, like a lot of people at the time, had invested heavily by “buying on the margins.” In other words, he had borrowed from various lenders in order to buy stocks which never seemed to go anywhere but up. When they started to go down, he was forced to write checks to cover the losses in the vain hope the stocks would eventually rebound. They didn’t. One day, he got a phone call. It was from his broker. There was no hello, or “how’s it going?” from the other end of the line. Instead, all his broker said was “MARX, THE JIG IS UP!” before slamming the receiver down. Years later, Groucho called it the most succinct and accurate financial analysis he ever heard. His entire life savings had been completely wiped out to the tune of $240,000.\n\nHowever, all was not lost. Groucho and his brothers still had a lucrative contract with Paramount good for three more pictures. It was at this time that they packed their bags and moved to Hollywood. And it was there, with the production of their third film – Monkey Business – that the trio really began to hit their stride.\n\nFreed from the shackles of a stage-bound production, “Monkey Business” was where the Marx’s routines first began to enter “classic film” territory. Taking place on an ocean liner, the setting gave them ample room to indulge their antics. Playing a group of stowaways, Harpo chases lots of women around, Chico engages everyone in double-talk, and Groucho continued to refine his insults. Perhaps the film’s most famous scene has the three brothers trying to disembark the boat after it reaches port. With no passports, each claims to be Maurice Chevalier, a well-known singer from the early 1930s. To prove their identity, both Groucho and Chico try to sing one of his songs (…if a nightingale…could sing like you...) But they’re so awful, the custom officials throw them back into the waiting crowd. Only Harpo sounds like Maurice Chevalier. In fact, he sounds exactly like him… until the song he’s singing begins to skip and it’s revealed the silent Harpo has been playing a phonograph record hidden behind his coat.\n\n“Monkey Business” was a huge hit…but the Marx Brothers’ next film did even better. In Horse Feathers, Groucho plays the president of fictional Huxley College… which is much more concerned with winning football games than improving academics. The entire film is laced with jabs at higher education (e.g. hiring “professional athletes” to pose as students so they can play in the big game, or lines like “you know you’ve got the brain of a four-year old child and I bet he was glad to get rid of it…”). Not to mention all the inventive visual bits. In one sequence, Groucho tells Harpo “you can’t burn a candle at both ends” only to see the latter produce a candle doing exactly that from his coat. In another, he asks for a seal he needs to stamp some official papers. Harpo responds by bring a real live one and depositing it on his desk.\n\nBut perhaps our favorite gag in the film is when Groucho goes on a canoe trip with a lady friend played by Thelma Todd. She’s really a femme fatale who’s manipulating him so she can get her hands on the Huxley playbook. When Groucho realizes what she’s up to, he wrestles with her and she falls overboard into the lake. Claiming that she can’t swim, she yells for him to throw her a life preserver. Groucho responds by pulling out a packet of Lifesavers candy (which look as if they haven’t changed in 85 years) and begins pelting her with them.\n\n(Note: In addition to being incredibly beautiful, Thelma Todd was one of Hollywood’s most talented comediennes during the 1930s. Along with two Marx Brothers movies, she starred in other comedy vehicles featuring Buster Keaton and Laurel and Hardy. She was also well known for an extremely successful restaurant she ran in Los Angeles, which was known to be a favorite hangout for tourists and organized crime figures alike. One night in 1935, she was found dead in a friend’s garage while sitting in a parked car with the engine running. The cause of death was listed as “accidental”, but the exact circumstances behind Thelma Todd’s demise remain one of Hollywood’s all time great mysteries. To this day, many people feel she was murdered and the local police conspired to cover up the evidence).\n\nThe conclusion of “Horse Feathers” features a climatic football game between Huxley and their arch rival Darwin College. Full of slapstick and sight gags, ESPN.com once listed it as the best football sequence in movie history. The humor may it seems a bit dated today – especially with its use of stock footage – but audiences in the 1930s ate it up. At the end of movie, the four Marx brothers score the winning touchdown by riding a garbage wagon across the goal line as if it was some sort of chariot. The resulting image put them on the cover of Time Magazine.\n\nAt this point, the Marxs had one film left on their contract with Paramount and after the success of their two previous pictures, decided to go for broke. Their next movie would be stuffed to the max with jokes… almost to the point where there seems to be one every few seconds. It contains many of their most memorable sequences. Some people consider it the Marx Brothers’ masterpiece… The American Film Institute currently ranks it as the 60th greatest film ever made and the fifth funniest. But the odd thing is, at the time of its release, it was considered a gigantic flop.\n\nIt was called Duck Soup. And perhaps no other movie in film history better embodies the concept of laughter through sheer anarchy. In it, Groucho plays Rufus T. Firefly, the ruler of the mythical kingdom of Freedonia. Just for kicks, he decides to declare war on his neighbor Sylvania. Meanwhile Chico and Harpo play two incompetent spies employed by Groucho who can’t seem to get out of each other’s way. The laughs start flying nonstop from there.\n\nAgainst all odds, “Duck Soup” manages to simultaneously skewer high society, the establishment, the legal system, aristocracy, politics, war, as well as the 1930’s international stage (you can’t watch it without being reminded that Hitler and Mussolini were in power at the time). All while throwing one gag after another at the audience. There’s enough in there for a dozen movies. Not every one of them hits the bulls-eye, but you never have to wait long for the next assault.\n\nIn one memorable scene, Groucho – dressed in pajamas – goes downstairs to investigate a burglar in his house. Little does he know that Harpo and Chico have donned the same getup. After smashing a mirror, Chico is forced to mimic every movement Groucho makes to maintain the illusion that Groucho is still looking at himself. The payoff comes when he suddenly makes a 360 degree turn. Unable to anticipate this quick movement, Chico stays in place and throws his arms out like a stage performer who has just completed some dazzling routine. It’s difficult to describe… but if you’ve seen the sequence, hopefully you’ll agree it’s one of the funniest improvised bits in film history.\n\nCaught red-handed, Chico is dragged into court to face charges of treason. There, he’s grilled by the prosecutor:\n\nProsecutor: War would mean a prohibitive increase in our taxes.\n\nChico: Hey! I’ve got an uncle who lives in Taxes!\n\nProsecutor: No, I’m talking about taxes…money…dollars!\n\nChico: That’s where my uncle lives! Dollars, Taxes!\n\nIt isn’t long until Groucho gets into the act:\n\nGroucho: I’ll bet you eight to one we find you guilty.\n\nChico: That’s no good. I can get ten to one at the barbershop.\n\nProsecutor: Isn’t it true you tried to sell Freedonia’s Secret War Code?\n\nChico: Sure, I sold a code and two pair of plans.\n\nGroucho: Gentlemen, Chicolini here may talk like an idiot, and may look like an idiot, but don’t let that fool you. He really is an idiot…I suggest we give him ten years at Leavenworth, or eleven years at Twelveworth.\n\nChico: I’ll tell you what…I’ll take five and ten at Woolworth!\n\nThe problem with trying to recreate exchanges like this is that the written word doesn’t do it justice. The Marx Brothers had by now been performing for over 20 years. As such, they had perfected their comedic timing to the point where it was almost an art form. There’s a rhythm and a cadence to their delivery which is nothing short of magical.\n\nWe remember once getting an education about Edgar Allen Poe’s short poem “The Bells.” It’s not a piece you simply “read.” Instead, you have to say it out loud. Because only then is the underlying construction revealed. The poem is designed to actually mimic the rhythmic sounds of different bells, by juxtaposing specific consonants through the repetition of certain words. The result makes one begin to comprehend what the term “genius” really means.We’ve always felt the same way about the best of the Marx Brothers’ dialogue. It contains an affinity and a sense of playfulness toward the English language… but delivered in such a calculated manner, you’re left with the impression that Groucho and his brothers operated on a different linguistic plane than the rest of us mere mortals.\n\n“Duck Soup” also marked the return of Margaret Dumont to the Marx Brothers’ fold. An accomplished actress with decades of experience on both stage and screen, she was often referred to by Groucho as “The Fifth Marx Brother.” Specializing in playing rich, stuffy, and snooty members of the upper class, she was the perfect foil for Groucho and company. Simply put, without her presence, most of the classic Marx Brothers movies we know and love just wouldn’t be the same. Groucho once claimed the reason Dumont was so good in their movies was because “she didn’t get the jokes.” But most film historians beg to differ. Their common consensus holds she was instead an absolutely fabulous actress.\n\nAs proof, there’s a 1942 interview with the World Wide Features press syndicate. In it, Dumont said:\n\n“Scriptwriters build up to a laugh, but they don’t allow any pause for it. That’s where I come in. I ad lib – it doesn’t matter what I say – just to kill a few seconds so you can enjoy the gag. I have to sense when the big laughs will come and fill in, or the audience will drown out the next gag with its own laughter… I’m not a stooge, I’m a straight lady. There’s an art to playing straight. You must build up your man, but never top him, never steal the laughs from him.”\n\nTurns out she knew exactly what Groucho was insinuating while heaping abuse on her. And what abuse it was.\n\nAudiences during the Great Depression were delighted to see the elitists among them taken down a notch or two. So, just sit back and try to picture Dumont’s raised eyebrow while being on the receiving end of some of these barbs:\n\nGroucho (talking about possible marriage): I can see you right now in the kitchen, bending over a hot stove…except I can’t see the stove…\n\nGroucho: I could dance with you til the cows come home. On second thought, I’d rather dance with the cows until you come home…\n\nGroucho: You remind me of the Prince of Wales. Because believe you me, I know a Wale when I see one…\n\nGroucho: Well, that covers a lot of ground. Say you cover a lot of ground yourself…I hear they’re going to tear you down and put up an office building where you’re standing….You can leave in a taxi. If you can’t get a taxi you can leave in a huff. If that’s too soon, you can leave in a minute and a huff…\n\nGroucho: Not that I care, but where is your husband?\n\nDumont: Why, he’s dead.\n\nGroucho: I’ll bet he’s just using that as an excuse.\n\nDumont (offended): I was with him to the very end.\n\nGroucho: Hmmph. No wonder he passed away!\n\nDumont: I held him in my arms and kissed him.\n\nGroucho: So I see then. It was murder!\n\nWhen “Duck Soup” was released, everyone thought it was going to be another hit. It certainly had more laughs per screen minute than any of the Marxes’ previous films. But it was the depths of the depression, and audiences weren’t ready for a film which lambasted “the establishment” using a rapid-fire delivery system. They wanted something reassuring with a familiar storyline and soothing musical numbers. In fact, it wasn’t until the raucous 1960s that “Duck Soup” finally found its audience and became a staple on college campuses. It’s been considered a film classic every since. But back in 1934, after it failed to generate any buzz at the box office, Paramount decided to take a pass on renewing the Marxes’ contract. Zeppo, tired of playing the straight man, also abandoned the act for good to pursue a successful career as a talent agent.\n\nThe Marx Brothers’ career appeared to be over. But it then found the jump start it needed – the same way the trio got their first gig on Broadway… using the connections Chico made at the card table. (Groucho once jokingly referred to gambling halls as Chico’s natural habitat and said he was adept at turning each one he visited into a profitable enterprise…) It was while playing poker that Chico became well acquainted with (and indebted to) a large number of movers and shakers in Hollywood. One of them was MGM production chief Irving Thalberg. Never a big fan of comedies, Thalberg was upfront with Chico about his dislike for “Duck Soup.” He said it lacked a coherent structure and that the only way the Marxes could be a success in Hollywood was if they tied their comedy routines to a conventional story.\n\nOffering to sign them with certain conditions, Thalberg told the Marx brothers he would use MGM’s finest writers to concoct a script which “would have half as many laughs” but would be twice as funny. Skeptical about making a full blown “Hollywood” picture, but with no other options, Groucho, Chico, and Harpo decided to go along for the ride.\n\nThe result was A Night at the Opera and it represents the apex of the Marx Brothers’ film repertoire. Completely different from “Duck Soup” in both style and tone, it’s still one of the most entertaining movies ever made. The film also quite possibly represents the epitome of what the Hollywood studio system was capable of producing during the 1930s: a vehicle with an engaging story, lavish sets, quality cinematography, great musical numbers, and razor-sharp writing… just as Thalberg had promised. A lot of the things which define “The Marx Brothers” style of comedy were diluted for the film, but they were replaced or augmented with other elements which helped make the end result yet another classic in cinema history. Together with “Duck Soup” it represents one of the twin peaks in the Marx Brothers’ universe.\n\nThat’s probably because “A Night at the Opera” has some excruciatingly funny moments. Perhaps first and foremost is the ultra-famous “State Room Scene.” While taking a voyage from Europe to America and outmaneuvered by the stodgy owner of the opera company, Groucho finds himself stuck in a small room that’s little more than an oversized closet. Things only get worse when he opens up his steamer trunk to find Chico, Harpo, and the film’s leading man stowed away inside instead of his belongings. Groucho has also made the critical mistake of inviting Margaret Dumont down to his cabin in an attempt to woo her.\n\nBecause that’s when things start to get interesting. Two cleaning ladies come to make the bed. Followed by a manicurist, a ships engineer, his assistant, some odd girl looking for her aunt, a maid trying to mop up, and four waiters with trays full of food. Hmm…. just adding them up, that’s 15 people. All crammed into a small stateroom already filled with furniture and an oversized trunk. Which prompts Groucho to ask the classic question: “Is it my imagination, or is it getting crowded in here?” Of course, the payoff comes when Margaret Dumont comes trudging down the hall, blissfully unaware of the mayhem inside Groucho’s room. She opens up the door, and the sea of humanity spills out on top of her into the hallway. (Fans of 1980s music videos may remember Cyndi Lauper recreating this scene in “Girls Just Want To Have Fun.”)\n\n“A Night at the Opera” also features an extended chase scene at the end of the movie, where Harpo and Chico manage to destroy an entire live production of Il Trovatore with the greatest of ease. They replace the orchestral music cues with “Take Me Out to the Ballgame,” strip the costumes off the various dancers, drop a backdrop featuring a battleship into the performance, rip up the sets, abduct the obnoxious lead tenor, and generally create total mayhem while the snobby audience looks on in horror. Of course, Groucho is also on hand to provide additional commentary. With Margaret Dumont the usual target:\n\nGroucho: (addressing the crowd before the start of the performance): Ladies and gentlemen (I think that takes in most of you…). This is the opening of a new opera season. A season made possible by the generous checks of Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont). I’m sure the familiar strains of Verdi’s music will come back to you tonight… and Mrs. Claypool’s checks will probably come back in the morning. And now, on with the opera! Let joy be unconfined, Let there be dancing in the streets, drinking in the saloons, and necking in the parlor. Play Don! (to the unamused orchestra conductor).\n\nWhile over-analyzing why this stuff is just plain funny just tends to take the sparkle out of it, we think these types of potshots at pompous sacred cows appeal to just about everyone. Which is why “A Night at the Opera” gets our vote as one of the funniest films of all time. It manages to achieve a near perfect balance between visual and verbal comedy… with all the pieces fitting neatly together.\n\nAnother thing that makes the film unique… there are pauses built in between the jokes. As part of the writing process, Thalberg would have Groucho and the cast perform lines from the script in front of live audiences. They’d then mark the length of time each laugh got. Afterwards, while shooting, they’d leave room for the audience reaction… so the laughter wouldn’t step on subsequent jokes. It was a completely different approach from the one employed in “Duck Soup.”\n\n“A Night at the Opera” was a huge, huge hit for MGM… and continued to make money for the studio through re-releases for decades afterwards. Thalberg immediately started the production process for the Marx Brothers’ next vehicle: A Day at the Races. But then, tragedy struck. Thalberg, always a frail man, came down with pneumonia and died less than three weeks after catching a common cold. Groucho later remarked that when Thalberg died, The Marx Brothers’ careers died with him. Without a strong guiding hand to oversee the production process, none of their following films were able to replicate that same chemistry. (Thalberg is also credited with the quote which serves as the title for this post…although there are others who claim to have originated it).\n\nUpon viewing “A Day at the Races” one can see Thalberg’s imprint. It even has the same basic structure as “A Night at the Opera” – good production values, musical numbers, an elaborate climax, and several very funny sequences. But the songs are forgettable, the story conventional, and much of the comedy seems watered down. Still, it’s hard to keep from laughing when Groucho takes someone’s pulse and exclaims: “Either this man is dead, or my watch has stopped!” ...or when Chico and Harpo interrupt a romantic liaison between Groucho and a conniving girlfriend by wallpapering the entire room… or when the three brothers use a horse to escape an examination ward after setting off the sprinkler system with Margaret Dumont inside.\n\nBut unfortunately, from there, it was all downhill. The Marx Brother’s next film was Room Service. Someone at MGM with no imagination whatsover thought it would be great to pair the studio’s greatest comedy act with a hit Broadway play. The problem was the material wasn’t a good match for The Marx Brothers’ style of humor… and the result was fairly lifeless. From there, more films followed: At the Circus, Go West, The Big Store, A Night in Casablanca, and Love Happy. Out of these, “Go West” is probably the best of the bunch, followed closely by “A Night in Casablanca.” (We’re particularly fond of a gag in the latter one where a policeman goes to arrest Harpo… only to find him leaning against the side of a building. The policeman barks at him: “What do you think you’re doing? Holding up the building?” Harpo nods silently in assent. The policeman then grabs him to haul him off to jail, and the entire structure comes crashing down.)\n\nThe other films also contain some funny and entertaining sequences. But generally speaking, you’ve got a long wait between any genuine laughs. Without a strong writing staff to back them up, The Marx Brothers instinctively knew they were merely playing out the string.\n\nHowever, in 1941, The Marx Brothers did get to participate in a little bit of world history. In May of that year, at the height of World War II, German Deputy Fuhrer Rudolf Hess undertook a solo flight to England as part of an unauthorized peace initiative. Since Hess was the number two man in Germany at the time (after Adolf Hitler), this was a major event. After crashing in Scotland, he asked to be taken to see Winston Churchill. But when word reached the Prime Minister, he was just settling down at the end of the day for a little R&R in his private cinema. Upon hearing the news that Hess was in Britain, Churchill is reported to have exclaimed: “Hess or no Hess, he’ll have to wait. I’m going to watch The Marx Brothers!”\n\nWhile sitting on a ladder sticking out of a moving plane during the filming of 1946’s “A Night in Casablanca” Groucho told his siblings that he had become too old to keep playing the slapstick game. And with that, he retired from the movie business. But Groucho was still such a well known personality, he and his quick wit remained in high demand on various radio programs.\n\nThe following year, he appeared on a radio show with fellow comedian Bob Hope. But due to scheduling difficulties, Groucho had been kept in an adjoining waiting room for longer than planned. And when he finally walked out to go live on the air, he wasn’t in the best of moods. There, Bob Hope greeted him with “Why, it’s Groucho Marx…what brings you here from the hot desert?” Groucho retorted: “Hot desert my foot. I’ve been standing in a cold waiting room for 40 minutes.” From there, he completely ignored the script, responded to every line from Hope with a wisecrack, and took the segment way past its scheduled running time. The audience loved it.\n\nOne might have thought this would have made the show’s producer apoplectic. But instead, he saw dollar signs. He approached Groucho and asked him about starring in his own TV game show. Not necessarily a big fan of television, Groucho asked the producer if he lived in a tree. The executive responded by saying: “No, but my company has many branch offices…!” (Yuck, yuck, yuck). Groucho was completely taken aback. For one of the few times in his life, the champion ad-libber had been beaten at his own game.\n\nThe producer explained he had a new idea for a game show. The focus wasn’t going to be on the contest. Instead, it was going to be on Groucho. He would be given free rein to engage the contestants in any way he saw fit… and crack as many impromptu jokes as he wanted. The show’s staff would supply Groucho with a little background information on each guest, but it was going to be up to him to keep the show humming along using his amazing talent for zingers and one-liners.\n\nGroucho agreed… especially when he saw how much money they were willing to pay. And “You Bet Your Life” would go on to become a staple of American television and radio during an incredible 14 year run. It wasn’t until 1961 before it finally went off the air for good. The show featured an instrumental version of “Hooray for Captain Spaulding” from “Animal Crackers” and served to introduce one of the twentieth century’s most iconic figures to a whole new generation of fans. You can also credit Groucho and the show for coming up with the famous questions “Who’s buried in Grant’s Tomb” and “What color is the White House?” (Groucho directed them at a couple of contestants he was trying to cheer up after they failed to get any correct answers).\n\nUnlike some other shows at the time, “You Bet Your Life” was pre-recorded. Given his reputation for saying literally anything, the producers were terrified Groucho might come up with something which would get them in trouble with the censors. Such as one vintage exchange that’s among the most memorable in the history of television. On one particular show, Groucho was bantering with a female contestant who claimed to have 11 children. When she was asked why so many, she responded with “What can I say…I love my husband!” Groucho paused, wiggled his cigar in his mouth and with a knowing look toward the audience said: “I love my cigar too. But I take it out of my mouth every once in a while.”\n\nThat one sequence has gone on to become a bit of an urban legend. Groucho later claimed the exchange never took place. Another story says it was taped, but never aired. Yet another asserts that the resulting howling and laughter from the audience after he delivered that one line went on to be re-used for countless other canned “laugh tracks” used in TV shows during the 1960s. A quick search of YouTube fails to come up with the clip… so it’s likely it only exists in people’s imaginations. But it’s such quintessential Groucho, you can easily imagine the exchange.\n\nGroucho’s quick wit continued to get him in trouble the rest of his life. Once, while working with director Sam Wood, the exasperated filmmaker yelled at him in frustration over his frequent ad-libbing: “You can’t make an actor out of clay.” To which Groucho responded: “Nor a director out of Wood.” Needless to say, this didn’t improve their working relationship. Another time, Groucho was attending an all-women’s charity softball game. Turning to someone sitting next to him in the stands, Groucho said: “This is the first game I’ve ever been to where I wanted to go to bed with the third baseman.” The offended man looked at him and shot back: “That third baseman is my wife!!” On yet another occasion , Groucho was returning from an overseas trip. On his custom declaration form, it asked for his occupation. So, he wrote down “smuggler.” But then didn’t understand why officials locked him in a room and questioned him nonstop for five straight hours.\n\nSounds like those particular custom agents never went to the movies. Or saw him on the numerous talk shows and television specials he appeared in as the years went by. But plenty of other people did, including one middle-aged couple who ran into Groucho while he was walking along the street in downtown Chicago one afternoon.Thinking they were after an autograph, Groucho first tried to ignore them and go about his business. But finally the woman walked up to him, and asked: “You’re him, aren’t you? You’re Groucho!” When he replied yes he was, she timidly put her hand on his arm, and simply said: “Please…don’t ever die. Just keep on living.” And walked away.\n\nOf course, Groucho Marx finally did die. After a bout with pneumonia, he passed away on August 19th, 1977. Unfortunately, it was only three days after the death of Elvis Presley, so many people didn’t even notice the passing of one of film history’s most famous personalities. Which is kind of sad.\n\nWhy is Groucho’s legacy so important? Perhaps we’ll let him explain in his own words during a rare moment of seriousness:\n\n“My guess is that there aren’t a hundred top-flight professional comedians, male or female in the whole world. They are a much rarer and far more valuable commodity than all the gold and precious stones. But because we are laughed at, I don’t think people really understand how essential we are to their sanity. If it weren’t for the brief respite we give the world with our foolishness, the world would see mass suicides in numbers that compare favorably with the death rate of the lemmings.”\n\nBut that seems like such inappropriate way to end this piece. Groucho was all about entertaining people, not forcing them to engage in deep reflective thinking. If you need any proof, just consider what words Groucho once suggested be carved on his own tombstone:\n\n“Excuse me. I can’t stand up.”\n\n————————————————————————————\n\nPostscript: We just wanted to take a minute and make a few remarks about film critic Roger Ebert. The Marx Brothers’ “A Day at the Races” was the first film he ever saw as a child. He was taken to the theater by his father, who laughed so loud the young Ebert thought it was the funniest thing his old man had ever seen.\n\nWe remember growing up ourselves, and watching Robert Ebert spar with Gene Siskel on the PBS show “Sneak Previews.” Together they had this wonderful chemistry which you couldn’t replicate if you tried. It made an indelible impression on us, and their show quickly became one of the highlights of our week. (Anyone remember “Spot the Wonder Dog” who introduced each week’s worst film?)\n\nPeople forget, but before the advent of the internet, film criticism seemed to fall into two camps: low-brow critics for local newspapers who only reviewed films because there weren’t any other jobs around, or stuffy, “arty” types who seemed hell-bent on making everyone else feel “stupid” when it came describing what kinds of films they enjoyed.\n\nBut Siskel and Ebert weren’t like that at all. They seemed like regular guys… who just happened to have a passion for movies. With the necessary knowledge to back up their opinions. They weren’t wish-washy about describing what they liked…nor what they hated…and seemed to understand that “popcorn entertainment” and “art films” could each be enjoyed according to their own merits.\n\nFor example, we remember a special show they once did on “Guilty Pleasures.” For two of his films, Roger chose “Invasion of the Bee Girls” and the original “Last House on the Left.” Horrified, Gene responded by to the latter by saying: “But Roger, it’s just TRASH!!” To which Mr. Ebert responded: “Yes it is, but I still enjoyed it…and isn’t that the whole point of this show?” It was like music to our ears.\n\nWe’d like to share this following quote from Roger Ebert’s autobiography “Life Itself” in which he describes the very nature of movie magic and how it’s changed over the years:\n\n“What I miss though, is the wonder. People my age can remember walking into a movie palace where the ceiling was far overhead, and balconies and mezzanines reached away into darkness. We remember the sound of a thousand people laughing all at once. And screens the size of billboards so every seat in the house was a good one.\n\nWhen you go to the movies everyday, it sometimes seems as if the movies are more mediocre than ever, more craven and cowardly, more skillfully manufactured to pander to the lowest tastes instead of educating them.\n\nThen you see something absolutely miraculous and on your way out you look distracted, as if you had just experienced some kind of vision…”\n\nRoger Ebert’s passing was almost like the end of an era, and marked a very sad day for Miracle Movies. Not the least because he played an integral part in fostering our own love for the cinema. Beyond that, if you read his books and reviews, one other thing becomes crystal clear: he was also a very decent human being.\n\nWe certainly miss him."
