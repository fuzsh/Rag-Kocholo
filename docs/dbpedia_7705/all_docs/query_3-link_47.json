        "text": "Hooray for our three-week Marx Brothers Movie Night Series! Horsefeathers! A Night at the Opera! Duck Soup! (Vy a duck? Come and find out!) From vaudeville to motion pictures the famed comedy brothers are widely considered by critics, scholars and fans to be among the greatest and most influential comedians of the 20th century. They are also funny.\n\nAll ages, by donation $3-$8/person, no one turned away for lack of funds\n\nA Night at the Opera is a 1935 American comedy film starring the Marx Brothers (Groucho, Harpo and Chico), and featuring Kitty Carlisle, Allan Jones, Margaret Dumont, Sig Ruman, and Walter Woolf King. It was the first of five films the Marx Brothers made after Zeppo left the act.\n\nThe Marx Brothers run amuck in the world of opera when Otis B. Driftwood (Groucho Marx) meets aspiring singer Ricardo (Allan Jones), who is determined to win the love of fellow performer Rosa (Kitty Carlisle). Aided by Fiorello (Chico Marx) and Tomasso (Harpo Marx), Otis attempts to unite the young couple, but faces opposition from the preening star Lassparri (Walter Woolf King), who also has his sights on Rosa. Traveling from Italy to New York, Otis and friends rally to try and win the day."
