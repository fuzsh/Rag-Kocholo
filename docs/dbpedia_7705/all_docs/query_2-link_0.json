        "text": "Kay Francis is possibly the biggest of the 'forgotten stars' from Hollywood's Golden Era. Yet, for a while in the 1930s she ranked as one of America's most popular actresses, tagged the 'Queen of Warner Brothers'. By 1935, she earned a yearly salary of $115,000 (compared to Bette Davis with $18,000). The daughter of actress Katherine Clinton and businessman Joseph Gibbs, Kay did not start her working life in show business but sold real estate and arranged extravagant parties for wealthy socialites. Following her marriage in 1922 to James Dwight Francis, the son of a moneyed family, Kay adopted the surname Francis. Her first acting job was in a modernized 1925 version of 'Hamlet' (as the Player Queen), performing as 'Katharine Francis'. She then played Marjorie Grey in the melodrama \"Crime\" (1927) and appeared in the Ring Lardner play \"Elmer the Great\" (1928), produced by George M. Cohan and starring Walter Huston as Elmer Kane. On the strength of her stage work, Kay was screen-tested by Paramount and subsequently offered a contract (1929-31). A brief affair with writer/director Edmund Goulding (some time around April 1928) may also have been a contributing factor.\n\nShe had a bit in the first Marx Brothers outing, The Cocoanuts (1929), and then graduated to playing sophisticated seductresses opposite stars like William Powell and Ronald Colman. She appeared in the Lubitsch comedy Ärger im Paradies (1932), though being unhappy about being billed below Miriam Hopkins in the picture. One of her best early films was the comedy/drama Das letzte Erlebnis (1932), in which Kay portrayed a gravely-ill baroness opposite Powell's gentleman burglar. This doomed romance, interlaced with witty dialogue, was described by a reviewer as 'spilled cocktail and love at first sight'.\n\nParamount, at the time well-stocked with female stars but experiencing financial problems, decided to let Kay move to Warner Brothers. There she would remain for the rest of the decade. A tall, attractive, gray-eyed brunette with undeniable style and poise, she soon acquired a reputation as Hollywood's 'best dressed woman', wearing the most glamorous gowns designed by great studio costumers like Orry-Kelly, Travis Banton and Adrian. Female audiences, in particular, often flocked to see Kay Francis pictures simply to appreciate her sumptuous wardrobe. For her part, Kay spent a lot of time and effort on collaborative efforts with costume designers to select the right clothes for the parts she played. Dorothy Jeakins believed, that Kay possessed an 'innate sense of style'.\n\nBy the mid-1930s, Kay earned $5,250 per week and was voted by Variety as Hollywood's sixth most popular star. Numerous magazine articles were written about every detail of her life in and off the studio lot. She had major hits with I Found Stella Parish (1935) and Confession (1937), both excellent money-spinners for the studio. While much was made at the time (and since) of her famous lisp, this had not hitherto been a significant detriment to Kay's career. At least, not until her falling out with the studio executives who thought her salary too excessive. The tight control the studio exercised over the roles she played on screen caused her to file a lawsuit against Warner Brothers in an effort to escape her contract. It had all started to go wrong for her when she was assigned the role of 'women's picture star', effectively typecasting her in sentimental melodramas, earnest biopics (The White Angel (1936), and three-handkerchief tearjerkers like My Bill (1938), her script filled with Rs and Ls as chastisement for bucking the system. Though she still managed to give several good performances, the writing was now on the wall. By the end of the decade, the 'Queen of Warner Brothers' mantle had passed on to Bette Davis.\n\nDuring the mid-1940s, Kay co-produced several B-movies as vehicles for herself at Monogram, then made a brief return to stage work, acting in summer stock before retiring permanently in 1952. She spent the remainder of her life in virtual seclusion in New York and in her estate near Falmouth, Cape Cod. She left some of her estate (in excess of one million dollars) to an organization training guide dogs for the blind, Seeing Eye Inc. Her surviving personal papers are accessible at the Wesleyan University Cinema Archives.\n\nTragic songstress Lillian Roth (nee Lillian Rutstein) was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on December 13, 1910. She was given her first name in honor of singer Lillian Russell. She was the daughter of stage parents who groomed her and younger sister Ann for stardom at an early age.\n\nThe girls did not disappoint. In 1916, Lillian moved with her family to New York City, where the youngsters found work as extras in films. Lillian's precocious talent was picked up on quickly, and at age six she made her Broadway debut in \"The Inner Man.\" All the while, the girls trained at the Professional Children's School. They became billed as \"Broadway's Youngest Stars\" after putting together a successful vaudeville tour billed as \"The Roth Kids.\" In this act Lillian did serious dramatic impersonations of famous stars of the day, with Anna delivering amusing satires of Lillian's readings.\n\nLillian's vocal talents also impressed, and she was cast in the show \"Artists and Models\" at age 15. Shy by nature, the ever-increasing thrust into the limelight caused Lillian to develop severe nervous disorders, but somehow she persevered. At age 17, Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. signed her up as an ingénue headliner in his new show \"Midnight Frolics.\"\n\nThis attention led to impresario Ernst Lubitsch's invitation to Hollywood for his glossy musical Liebesparade (1929) with Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald. Lillian was a hit in her second lead role. She also impressed as Huguette in Der König der Vagabunden (1930), a rather dated early musical talkie. Paramount cast her in Honey (1930), in which she debuted her signature standard \"Sing You Sinners.\" Other roles included Cecil B. DeMille's Madam Satan (1930) and the Marx Brothers' vehicle Animal Crackers (1930), which countered her vocal stylings with the boys' zany antics.\n\nThe sudden death of her fiancé in the early '30s drove Lillian over the brink. She found that liquor gave her a calming sensation, which led to a full-scale addiction. Marriages, one to renowned Municipal Court Justice Benjamin Shalleck, came and went at a steady pace. There would be six in all. Her career deteriorated as she spiraled further and further down into alcoholic delirium.\n\nDecades would be spent in and out of mental institutions until she met and married T. Burt McGuire, Jr., a former alcoholic, in the late '40s. With his support, Lillian slowly revived her career with club work. She became a singing sensation again and toured throughout the world, receiving ecstatic reviews wherever she went. Lillian's daring autobiography, \"I'll Cry Tomorrow,\" was published in 1954 and topped The New York Times Best Seller list. She left out few details of her sordid past and battles with substance abuse. She became the first celebrity to associate her name with alcoholism and Alcoholics Anonymous, putting a well-known face on the disease (as Rock Hudson would later do for AIDS, albeit less willingly) while doing her part in helping to remove the social stigma.\n\nA bold, no-holds-barred film adaptation of Lillian's book followed. Susan Hayward's gutsy portrayal of Lillian won her a fourth Oscar nomination. Lillian herself would return to films in her twilight years, but only in small roles and to minor fanfare. A beautiful and touching vocalist and actress, she put her own wonderful spin on such vintage songs as \"When the Red, Red Robin,\" \"I Wish I Had My Old Gal Back Again,\" and \"Eadie Was a Lady.\" She overcame unimaginable odds and somehow lived to tell about it.\n\nLillian's turbulent life came to an end in New York City after suffering a fatal stroke on May 12, 1980. She was 69.\n\nThelma Todd was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts, an industrial city near the New Hampshire state line. She was a lovely child with good academic tendencies, so much so that she decided early on to become a schoolteacher. After high school she went on to college but at her mother's insistence entered several beauty contests (apparently her mother wanted her to be more than just a \"schoolmarm\"). Thelma was so successful in these endeavors that she entered on the state level and won the title of \"Miss Massachusetts\" in 1925 and went on to the \"Miss America\" pageant; though she didn't win, the pageant let her be seen by talent scouts looking for fresh new faces to showcase in films. She began to appear in one- and two-reel shorts, mostly comedy, which showcased her keen comic timing and aptitude for physical comedy--unusual in such a beautiful woman.\n\nShe had been making shorts for Hal Roach when she was signed to Paramount Pictures. Her first role--at age 21--was as Lorraine Lane in 1927's Fascinating Youth (1926), a romantic comedy that was Paramount's showcase vehicle for its new stars. Thelma received minor billing in another film that year, God Gave Me Twenty Cents (1926). The next year she starred with Gary Cooper and William Powell in the western Nevada (1927). That year also saw her in three more films, with The Gay Defender (1927) being the most notable. It starred Richard Dix as a man falsely accused of murder.\n\nAs the 1920s closed, Thelma began to get parts in more and more films. In 1928 and 1929 alone she was featured in 20 pictures, and not just comedies--she also did dramas and gothic horror films. Unlike many silent-era stars whose voices didn't fit their image or screen persona, Thelma's did. She had a bright, breezy, clear voice with a pleasant trace of a somewhat-aristocratic but unsnobbish New England accent and easily made the transition to sound films. In 1930 she added 14 more pictures to her resume, with Dollar Dizzy (1930) and Follow Thru (1930) being the most notable. The latter was a musical with Thelma playing a rival to Nancy Carroll for the affections of Buddy Rogers. It was a box-office hit, as was the stage production on which it was based. The following year Thelma appeared in 14 more films, among them Let's Do Things (1931), Der Theaterprofessor (1932), The Old Bull (1932), and On the Loose (1931). Her most successful film that year, however, was the Marx Brothers farce Die Marx Brothers auf See (1931). While critics gave the film mixed reviews, the public loved it. In 1932 Thelma appeared in another Marx Brothers film directed by Norman Z. McLeod, Die Marx Brothers in der Uni (1932). She also starred in Madame verliert ihr Kleid (1932), a profitable film which featured Cary Grant in his first major role. In 1934 Thelma made 16 features, but her career would soon soon come to a grinding halt. In 1935 she appeared in such films as Twin Triplets (1935) and The Misses Stooge (1935), showcasing her considerable comic talents. She also proved to be a savvy businesswoman with the opening of \"Thelma Todd's Sidewalk Café\", a nightclub/restaurant that catered to show-business people. Unfortunately, it also attracted some shady underworld types as well, and there were rumors that they were trying to take over her club and use it as a gambling establishment to fleece the wealthy Hollywood crowd. According to these tales, Thelma and her boyfriend, director Roland West, wouldn't sell their establishment once they found out what the gangsters had in mind, which incurred the enmity of the wrong people with whom to have differences of opinion. Whether or not the stories were true, on December 16, 1935, 29-year-old Thelma was found dead in her car in her garage in Los Angeles. Her death was ruled suicide-by-carbon-monoxide-poisoning. At the time, as today, many felt that her death was actually a murder connected to the goings-on at her club, a theory that was lent credence by the fact that no one who knew her had ever seen her depressed or morose enough to worry about her committing suicide. Another factor that aroused suspicion was that her death was given a cursory investigation by the--at the time--notoriously corrupt Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office and the case was quickly and unceremoniously closed. Her death has remained controversial to this day.\n\nThree films she made before her death weren't released until the following year: Hot Money (1936), An All American Toothache (1936), and Dick und Doof werden Papa (1936). The latter saw her quite substantial role cut down so much that she was barely glimpsed in the picture. Thelma had made an amazing 115 films in such a short career, and her beauty and talent would no doubt have taken her right to the top if not for her untimely demise.\n\nFetching Raquel Torres had a very brief but sexy reign in Hollywood with the advent of sound, but late-night viewers can still get a sampling of this spitfire's charms in one zany piece of slapstick with The Marx Brothers.\n\nBorn Guillermina Ostermann in Hermosillo, Mexico, on November 11, 1908, she began her film career at age 19 and garnered instant attention and a flurry of wolf whistles in W.S. Van Dyke's Weiße Schatten (1928), which remains best known as MGM's first film to synchronize music, dialogue and sound effects. This exquisite beauty appeared in the predominantly silent film as the lead femme opposite stoic Monte Blue. A biracial love story and morality play set in the South Pacific islands, this was supposedly the first film in which the MGM lion roared before the opening credits of the picture. The beautifully shot film went on to win the Best Cinematography Oscar.\n\nThe next year, she was third-billed behind Lili Damita and Ernest Torrence in Die Brücke von San Luis Rey (1929), the first film version of the classic Thornton Wilder novel, which was a part-talkie. This Oscar winner (for Art Direction) was an early disaster movie that bonded a group of strangers who see their lives flash before their eyes while trapped on a collapsing bridge. Raquel's other 1929 film was The Desert Rider (1929), a standard oater in which she provided spicy diversion opposite cowboy star Tim McCoy.\n\nTorres continued the tropical island pace with The Sea Bat (1930) and Aloha (1931) playing various island girls and half-caste beauty types. In her last year of filming, she played a sexy foil to the raucous comedy teams of Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey in So This Is Africa (1933) and Groucho Marx, Chico Marx, Harpo Marx and Zeppo Marx in Die Marx Brothers im Krieg (1933). It was Raquel who inspired Groucho's classic line, \"I could dance with you until the cows came home. On second thought, I'd rather dance with the cows until you came home.\"\n\nRaquel abruptly retired following her marriage to businessman Stephen Ames in 1935, who once was married to actress Adrienne Ames. Her husband later produced postwar \"B\" films including Die Seeteufel von Cartagena (1945), Tycoon (1947) and Terror der Gesetzlosen (1953), but Raquel never returned to the film industry even with this her husband's \"in\" connection.\n\nAmes died on the 20th anniversary of their wedding in 1955 and Raquel later married actor Jon Hall, who also had his share of tropical island movies. but this marriage ended in divorce. She died of complications from an earlier stroke in 1987 in Los Angeles at the age of 78.\n\nKitty Carlisle Hart wore a cloak of many professional and elegant colors. Actress, opera singer, Broadway performer, TV celebrity, game show panelist, patron of the arts, and, at age 95, this vital woman continued her six-decade musical odyssey with songs and reminisces in her one-woman show: \"Kitty Carlisle Hart: An American Icon,\" which toured from her beloved New York to Los Angeles. She developed pneumonia soon after her tour folded toward the end of 2006 and passed away of congestive heart failure in April of 2007.\n\nKitty Carlisle Hart was born Catherine Conn (pronounced \"Cohen\") on September 3, 1910 in New Orleans, Louisiana, to a family of German Jewish ancestry. Her father, Dr. Joseph Conn, was a gynecologist who died when she was only ten. Her very ambitious mother, Hortense (Holzman), escorted Kitty to Europe in 1921 with the intentions of marrying her off, Grace Kelly-style, into European royalty. When that plan didn't pan out, they stayed in Europe where Kitty received her adult education in Switzerland, London, Paris and Rome. She finally zeroed in on her acting career after being accepted into London's Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and also went on to train at the Theatre de l'Atelier in Paris.\n\nShe and her mother eventually returned to New York in 1932 wherein she first apprenticed with the Bucks County Playhouse in New Hope, Pennsylvania. She attracted notice quite early in her career. Billed as Kitty Carlisle, she found radio work and made her first appearance on the musical stage in the title role of \"Rio Rita.\" The legitimately-trained singer went on to appear in a number of operettas, including 1933's \"Champagne Sec\" (as Prince Orlofsky), as well as the musical comedies \"White Horse Inn\" (1936) and \"Three Waltzes\" (1937).\n\nHer early ingénue movie career included warbling in the musical mystery Murder at the Vanities (1934), and alongside Allan Jones amidst the zany goings-on of the Marx Brothers in the classic farce Skandal in der Oper (1935). She also played a love interest to Bing Crosby's in two of his lesser known musical outings Here Is My Heart (1934) and She Loves Me Not (1934).\n\nFilms were not her strong suit, however, and she returned to her theatre roots. Appearing in her first dramatic productions \"French Without Tears\" and \"The Night of January 16th\" in 1938, she went on to grace a number of chic and stylish plays and musicals throughout the 40s, including \"Walk with Music (1940), \"The Merry Widow\" (1943, \"Design for Living (1943) and \"There's Always Juliet\" (1944). She subsequently performed in Benjamin Britten's 1948 American premiere of \"The Rape of Lucretia.\" In 1946, she married Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Moss Hart and appeared in a number of his works including his classic \"The Man Who Came to Dinner\" (1949) and the witty Broadway comedy \"Anniversary Waltz\" (1954). The couple had two children. He died in 1961 and she never remarried, spending much of her existing time keeping his name alive to future generations.\n\nIt was the small screen that would make Kitty a welcome household commodity. The steadfast panelist of several quiz shows in the 1950s, it was the popular game show To Tell the Truth (1956) that anointed her game show doyenne and icon. A regular panelist for some 20 years, she appeared on each and every revamped format from its 1956 inception to its 2002 syndicated version. Known for her stately presence, infectious laugh, pouffy dark Prince Valiant hairstyle, and sweeping couture gowns on the show, audiences reveled at her effortless class to these simple parlor games. She also was a substitute panelist for other popular game shows such as \"What's My Line?\" and \"I've Got a Secret.\"\n\nIn later years, she became an important society maven of New York City, an avid patron and zealous supporter of the performing arts. Appointed to various state-wide councils, she was chairman of the New York State Council of the Arts in 1976 and served in that capacity for 20 years, also serving on the boards of various New York City cultural institutions. A noted lecturer, the civic-minded Carlisle Hart was active in administrative capacities as well, notably as Chairman of Governor Rockefeller's Conference on Woman (1966) and as special consultant to the Governor on women's opportunities. At one time she wrote the column \"Kitty's Calendar\" for Women's Unit News.\n\nKitty never stopped entertaining. Making her Metropolitan debut on New Year's Eve 1966 as Prince Orlovsky in \"Die Fledermaus,\" she joined the touring production the following year. She appeared in concert with the Philadelphia Orchestra and appeared with the Boston Opera Company at one point. She added stature to a number of summer stock plays including \"Kiss Me Kate,\" \"The Marriage-Go-Round\" and her husband's \"Light Up the Sky.\" Returning to Broadway as a replacement for Dina Merrill in the 1983 revival of \"On Your Toes,\" she was later spotted in Woody Allen's Radio Days (1987) and Das Leben - Ein Sechserpack (1993).\n\nCarlisle penned her autobiography, Kitty, in 1988. In the millennium, she appeared in a number of documentary films and TV movies. She died on April 17, 2007, at age 96, in Manhattan.\n\nOf Irish, English, and Scottish descent, Maureen Paula O'Sullivan was born on May 17, 1911 in Boyle, County Roscommon, Ireland. Her father was Charles Joseph O'Sullivan, an officer in the Connaught Rangers, and his wife, the former Mary Fraser (or Frazer). She was educated at Catholic schools in Dublin, Paris, and London (Convent of the Sacred Heart, Roehampton, where a fellow student was fellow future actress Vivien Leigh). Even as a schoolgirl, Maureen desired an acting career, despite her father's initial opposition. She studied hard and read widely. When the opportunity to be an actress came along, it almost dropped in her lap. American film director Frank Borzage was in Dublin in 1929, filming Song o' My Heart (1930), when the 18 year old met him. He suggested a screen test, which she took. The results were more than favorable and she won the substantial role of Eileen O'Brien, then went to Hollywood to complete filming.\n\nOnce in sunny California, Maureen wasted no time landing roles in other films such as Just Imagine (1930), The Princess and the Plumber (1930), and So This Is London (1930). She was perhaps MGM's most popular ingenue throughout the 1930s in a number of non-Tarzan vehicles. In 1932, she teamed up with Olympic medal winner Johnny Weissmuller for the first time in Tarzan, der Affenmensch (1932), as Jane Parker. Five other Tarzan films followed, the last being Tarzans Abenteuer in New York (1942). The Tarzan epics rank as one of the most memorable series ever made. Most people agree that those movies would not have been as successful as they were, had it not been for the talent, grace, and radiant beauty of O'Sullivan. But she was more than Jane Parker. She went on to roles in such films as The Flame Within (1935), David Copperfield (1935), and Anna Karenina (1935). She turned in another fine performance in Stolz und Vorurteil (1940). After the 1940s, however, she made fewer films, primarily for personal reasons, i.e. caring for her large family.\n\nIt isn't always easy to walk away from a lucrative career, but O'Sullivan did because she wanted to devote more time to her husband, John Farrow, an Australian-American writer, and their seven children: Michael, Patrick, Maria (a.k.a. Mia Farrow), John, Prudence, Theresa (a.k.a. Tisa Farrow), and Stephanie Farrow. The couple were married from 1936 until his death in 1963. After her last Tarzan venture she asked for release from her contract to care for her husband who had just left the U.S. Navy with typhoid. She did not retire completely and still found time to make occasional movies and television programs, as well as operate a bridal consulting service (Wediquette International).\n\nO'Sullivan made her Broadway debut opposite Paul Ford in \"Never Too Late\" (November 27, 1962-April 24, 1965), a great success. She would appear on Broadway again in various vehicles through 1981, and later also co-produced two Broadway productions. Later movie patrons remember her as Elizabeth Alvorg in Peggy Sue hat geheiratet (1986) (playing opposite fellow silver screen film veteran Leon Ames). Her final celluloid role was in Good Old Boy: A Delta Boyhood (1988). Some made-for-television movies followed and she retired completely in 1996, two years before her death in Scottsdale, Arizona on June 23, 1998 during heart surgery. She was 87 years old.\n\nThe statuesque American comedienne Esther Muir was a former New York model, who started in the chorus line of the 1922 \"Greenwich Village Follies\" on Broadway, straight out of high school, and with little or no theatrical training. She caught the eye, however, since her effort led to further work on stage, including \"Battling Butler\", opposite Charles Ruggles. There, she found herself in the role of the comic foil for the first time.\n\nIn 1929, she followed an acclaimed performance in the Broadway production of \"My Girl Friday\" with further work in musical comedy for Lew Leslie's International Revue, alongside such luminaries as Gertrude Lawrence. Noted choreographer Busby Berkeley, who had worked on some of the dance numbers for the show, was introduced to Esther backstage by the columnist Walter Winchell. Esther subsequently married Berkeley and accompanied him to Hollywood, after he had been signed by producer Samuel Goldwyn. The union was, however, short-lived. Esther later claimed, that Berkeley needed a mother more than he needed a wife.\n\nWhile already in Hollywood, she began acting on screen in feature films and two-reel comedies. Soon typecast, she became the obliging comic foil to Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey in the spoof So This Is Africa (1933), and to Fanny Brice in Der große Ziegfeld (1936). Often, she was given good wisecracking lines to deliver. Her most pivotal role, of course, was as the slinky, seductive Flo, doing the villain's bidding to discredit the \"moth-eaten Romeo\" (Dr. Hugo Z. Hackenbush, played by Groucho Marx) in Das Große Rennen (1937)(having already toured with the part on stage). In one of The Marx Brothers most anarchic (but memorable) scenes, Esther's Flo gets her comeuppance by being covered in paste and wallpaper (stills suggest, that the Marxes took Esther's pasting a lot further, than was played out in the released film version, but this was cut from the final print). Esther took it all in good humour and was a willing participant in the pranks played on set.\n\nGroucho's droll caption of a picture in \"The Groucho Phile\" (p. 144) reads: \"Esther struck oil while running her fingers through my hair. She retired from films as a result\". In fact, Esther stuck around for another five years, but was confined to bit parts in major films, or supporting roles for Republic and other Poverty Row studios. She was one of the few free-lance actresses in Hollywood, reluctant to commit to long-term contracts. Having lost the lucrative role of Belle Watling in Vom Winde verweht (1939) to Ona Munson, Esther became increasingly disheartened and eventually retired from films in 1943, beginning a new career as a real estate developer in Southern California.\n\nEdgar Kennedy, who was born on April 26, 1890, near Monterey, California, hit the road as a young man and traveled across the country, working in a succession of jobs. He became a professional boxer, claiming to have gone 14 rounds against The Manassas Mauler, Jack Dempsey.\n\nIn addition to his knowledge of the \"Sweet Science\", Kennedy possessed a good musical voice, and wound up singing in musical shows in the Midwest, his first taste of show business. During his cross-country peregrinations he wound up in Los Angeles, and found himself hired as an actor by comedy producer Mack Sennett. At the Sennett Studios he was allegedly one of the original Keystone Kops, but soon graduated from bit parts to supporting roles in Keystone comedies, including Tillie's Punctured Romance (1914) with Charles Chaplin. Kennedy had good roles in other Chaplin movies, but when his contract expired in 1921 he went freelance, though he did occasionally return to Sennett.\n\nAfter leaving Sennett Kennedy established himself as a first-rate supporting comic, and made a career out of playing harassed businessmen, next-door neighbors, cops, etc. By the late 1920s his craft was most prominently featured in comedies for Hal Roach, Sennett's arch-rival, where he flourished in support of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. It was with Roach that he developed his mastery of the \"slow burn\", a routine for which he became famous. He often played a none-too-bright policeman brought to the boiling point by the absurdities of Laurel and Hardy. He also directed the two in Von der Suppe zum Dessert (1928) and Ihr könnt mir mal was blasen (1928).\n\nRKO hired Kennedy to appear in a series of comedy shorts called \"The Average Man,\" in which he played the head of a family. The shorts had very tight shooting schedules, often as few as three days, but Kennedy was always a pro and delighted the audience by giving them his all. He made over 200 short subjects and appeared in over 100 feature films, still in demand right up to the day he died of cancer on November 9, 1948.\n\nAllan Jones was born Theodore Allen Jones in Old Forge, Pennsylvania. A coal miner's son, he worked in the mines until 1926. At that point in time, he received a scholarship from Syracuse University, but chose instead to study music at New York University with Claude Warford and then with Felix Leroux in Paris and Sir Henry Wood in London.\n\nClassically trained in opera, the handsome Jones worked on Broadway and in operettas until 1935. At that point, Jones was signed by MGM Grand. He is best remembered for his roles in the two Marx Brothers movies Skandal in der Oper (1935) and Das Große Rennen (1937), and for his costarring role in Show Boat (1936). The movie Tarantella (1937) produced the song \"Donkey Serenade\", which became Jones's signature song. Jones was relegated to minor roles at MGM after this. He moved to Universal Studios in 1940, and he starred or appeared in several B musicals there and at Paramount.\n\nDuring the war years, Jones was one of the first entertainers to volunteer to sing for the troops overseas. In 1945, Jones left Hollywood and toured Great Britain for two years. He returned to the stage and toured with several off-Broadway musicals. Over the next twenty years, he worked the nightclub circuit, appeared in summer-stock and off-Broadway productions, and recorded extensively, including several short \"songfests\", meant to be fillers in the early days of TV.\n\nIn the mid 1960s the busy Jones managed to fit a few appearances on television and in movies into his busy theater, nightclub, and recording career. In 1971, he took on the role of Don Quixote in \"Man of La Mancha\", a role he would perform off and on for the next eight years. He also was very successful on the lecture circuit.\n\nIn 1982, the 75-year-old Jones cut yet another LP, his voice belying his age: as clear and vibrant as singers a third his age.\n\nJones continued to work for the remainder of his life, finishing a successful tour of Australia a few weeks before his death, at 84, in 1992."
