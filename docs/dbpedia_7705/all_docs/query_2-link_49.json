        "text": "Well, it's all over but the shouting (and I expect at least a little of that). All the entries have been graded and prizes awarded. If you'd like to see a list of winners, just scroll down to the bottom of the page.\n\nIn most cases the answers to these questions show up in various places, but some are pretty obscure. In these cases I have cited my sources. Also, there are a few questions where I was either going on erroneous information or I chose misleading wording. In these cases I'm allowing not only my intended answers but also the \"more correct\" ones (these will be obvious when you get there).\n\nIt's been an interesting experience, running this contest, and while I've had a good time doing it, I must admit it has been a bit of a headache. But you don't need to hear my woes...You came for the contest results!

As an American performer in the Soviet Union, what was the most significant thing about Harpo's trip?\n\nHe was the first American performer to appear in the Soviet Union after the revolution (some people pointed out that he performed some covert activities while performing there and, while this is certainly true, I was going for his significance as an American performer, not simply as an American)\n\nIn 1933, Leo McCarey directed \"Duck Soup\" for the Marxes (which was a flop at the box office but has since become a classic).

Who was his co-writer, who was the intended star of the film, what was the title of the screenplay, and what is the chief reason it was never produced? (4 parts)\n\nKen Englund co-wrote the screenplay for \"Madcap Mary Mooney,\" which was supposed to feature Carole Lombard in the lead role. The screenplay was never produced, mainly because of the death of Amelia Earheart. (I think that covers everything...And in case you're wondering, I found this out from Robert S. Bader's outstanding foreword to \"Groucho Marx and Other Short Stories and Tall Tales.\")\n\nIn 1940, Groucho was working with Irving Brecher on a situation comedy for radio for which he was the intended star. The pilot never sold. What was the intended title of the show, and under what title did it eventually appear starring what actor? (3 parts)\n\n\"The Flotsam Family\" was retitled \"The Life of Riley,\" which starred William Bendix (Jackie Gleason is also an acceptable answer for the star)\n\nNat Pendleton appeared in two Marx Bros. films, \"Horse Feathers\" and \"At The Circus.\" He was also featured in the first starring vehicle for another famous comedy team.

This film was remade several years later as a musical. What was the title of the film, what was the title of the remake and who was the star in the remake?

What song was it and how long did it top the charts? (2 parts)\n\nAccording to Hector Arce's \"Groucho,\" \"Alone\" was number one for 17 weeks in 1936. However, one person pointed out that Zimmerman's book shows \"Alone\" at the top of the \"Lucky Strike\" charts for 16 weeks, while another claimed it topped the \"Your Hit Parade\" charts for 5 weeks. Since I didn't point out which charts I was referring to, as long as you get the song right you get full credit.\n\nWhat was the first feature film Groucho appeared in without his brothers?\n\nAs some have pointed out to me, Groucho was an extra in \"Yours For The Asking\" in 1936. I was actually looking for \"Copacabana,\" which was his first starring role without his brothers. However, this isn't the way the question was worded, so I'll accept either answer.\n\nHarpo Marx once had a pet seagull. What was the name of this bird?\n\nSiegel\n\nGroucho Marx and Margaret Dumont appeared together for the last time on what television program in what year? (2 parts)\n\nThe Hollywood Palace, 1965.\n\nThe original audition record for \"You Bet Your Life\" featured an announcer who was better known as the announcer of another popular radio program of the time. Who was the announcer, and on what program did he regularly appear? (2 parts)\n\nJack Slattery was the regular announcer on Art Linkletter's \"House Party.\" (The Secret Word Is Groucho)\n\nThe voice of \"You Bet Your Life\" announcer George Fenneman was regularly featured on what popular drama?\n\nJack Webb's \"Dragnet\" (The Secret Word Is Groucho)\n\nWho was the original musical director of \"You Bet Your Life\" and why was he finally discharged. (2 parts)\n\nHere I was looking for Jerry Fielding, who was discharged for reasons stemming from his investigation by the U.S. government during the McCarthy \"witch hunt.\" However, several people have pointed out to me that he was not the first musical director of the program -- rather the third. Billy May was the first. So I'll give credit for either one, even though my answer is clearly incorrect.\n\nDuring the run of \"You Bet Your Life,\" George Fenneman hosted what short-lived radio program for ABC?\n\n\"The Perfect Husband\" (The Secret Word Is Groucho)\n\nElgin American was the first sponsor of \"You Bet Your Life.\" Why did the company terminate its sponsorship?\n\nDue to the popularity of the program, they sold out their entire product line.

(4 parts)\n\nOzzie Nelson starred in \"The Impossible Years,\" penned by Arthur Marx, Groucho's son.\n\nIn 1969, Groucho's photo was used on the album cover of a popular recording comedy group.

What popular musical motion picture did she appear in?\n\n\"Bye, Bye Birdie\"\n\nAnn Ronell composed the musical score for the Marxes' last picture, \"Love Happy.\" Ronell's first work for film was as lyricist for what famous song (the title of which was also the title of the film in which it appeared)?\n\n\"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf\" (This according to a Lincoln Center Library exhibit of Ronnell's work...She lost a court battle over the credit for this piece, however.) Unfortunately, my parenthetical remark in this question was a bit misleading, because the movie the song appeared in was actually called \"The Three Little Pigs.\" Sorry about that.\n\nWhat was the original title of \"Love Happy?\"\n\n\"Diamonds In The Sidewalk\" (certain variations are also acceptable, provided you got the idea across)\n\n\"Love Happy\" is considered by many to have been a pioneering film in the use of product placement (i.e., the view or mention of a product or brand name in a film in return for financial backing). But the Marx Brothers' films featured \"product placement\" (without the financial backing) long before this movie was produced. What brand name was mentioned in what song from \"Animal Crackers\" and who was the singer? (3 parts)\n\n\"Frigidaire\" is mentioned in \"Why Am I So Romantic?\" sung by Lillian Roth.\n\nThe Chico Marx Orchestra at one time featured a young singer who later became famous. Who was the singer?\n\nMel Torme\n\nGroucho was a long-time fan of the work of Gilbert and Sullivan. What was the name of the actor who introduced Groucho to the work of this duo?\n\nEdward Metcalf, who worked with the Marxes on the stage and in the movies. (Hector Arce's \"Groucho\")\n\nNorman Krasna wrote a play loosely based on the lives of Groucho and his family. What was the title?\n\n\"Dear Ruth\"\n\nIn February 1950, Harpo appeared at the opening of a hotel with Jack Benny and Danny Kaye. For this appearance he agreed to be paid in supposedly oil-rich land that was later discovered to be worthless. What was the name of the hotel and in what city was it constructed? (2 parts)\n\nThe Shamrock Hotel, Houston, Texas (Hector Arce's \"Groucho\")\n\nIn 1974, Groucho performed his one-man show, \"An Evening With Groucho,\" at Carnegie Hall. Who was his piano accompanist?\n\nMarvin Hamlisch (and the year was 1972...my oops)\n\nAnd Here Comes the Winners!\n\nWell, all I can say is it was close! As a matter of fact, there was a total of half a point between the four top scorers. And since there was a tie for third place (first and second were separated by a quarter point -- likewise second and third), I've decided to award two third-place prizes instead of one. So here are the winners and what they won.\n\nFirst Place -- Wayne E. Boenig -- $50 Gift Certificate from Amazon.com\n\nSecond Place -- Aimee Darmer -- $30 Gift Certificate from Amazon.com\n\nThird Place -- Ira J. Dolnick and Joel G. Harris -- $20 Gift Certificate from Amazon.com\n\nAnd that's all she wrote. Except, I would like to point out all the honorable mentions. As I said when I started this thing, all those scoring at least 80% of the final top score would get on the honor roll. Here's how it all stacked up, in alphabetical order:\n\nThe High Honor Roll -- 90% and Above\n\nRobert J. Moulton\n\nDavid Schwalbe\n\nThe Honor Roll -- 80% and Above\n\nMelissa R. Aughe\n\nMark D. Greenberg\n\nKevin Kittleson\n\nJulie A. Tharpe\n\nJuli A. Thompson\n\nRay & Lee White\n\nFinally, here are a couple of special awards:\n\nThe Most Entries by a Single Person\n\nAimee Darmer, our second place winner, is also the winner in this category, hands down. Aimee did her best to make my life interesting by sending in no less than 17 entries and updates!\n\nThe Lowest Scoring Completed Entry\n\nGerald R. Yowell wins this category...No contest here. But one of the most impressive things about Gerald's entry is that he answered every single question and only got 3.5 out of fifty! Of course, some of his answers were pretty bizarre, which brings us to the next category...\n\nThe Most Entertaining Answer to a Single Question\n\nGerald R. Yowell wins again. In question three, when I asked, \"One of Harpo's first jobs was as a piano player, though he only knew two tunes. How did he manage to get this job?\" Gerald's response was \"He threatened to beat up the owner of the bordello.\" Of course, he also claimed that Gummo's first job in show business was scraping the gum off of theater seats. (Who knows? He might be right!) The other fascinating thing about Gerald's entry is that he actually got half of question eight correct, and I'll bet he wasn't answering it seriously!\n\nSo, there you have it. As I've said before, I've had a great time running this contest, but don't look for another one in the near future. But, thanks for playing, or not, as the case may be."
