Jeremy Sisto of “Law and Order” fame married Addie Lane, the mother of his infant daughter Charlie, in a quiet ceremony at City Hall in New York City. “We are the ones who are happy,” his new wife told onlookers outside the site of the nuptials. Sisto was previously wed to Marisa Ryan for nine years, before the pair split in 2002.
