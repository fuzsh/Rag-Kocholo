        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\n\"The O.C.\" aired on Fox for four seasons between August 2003 and February 2007.\n\nThe teen drama starred Ben McKenzie, Mischa Barton, Adam Brody, and Rachel Bilson.\n\nHere's what the cast has been up to in the years since, from more acting jobs to writing books.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBen McKenzie starred as Ryan Atwood, a 17-year-old from a broken home in Chino, California.\n\nThe series kicked off with Ryan getting caught stealing a car with his older brother, Trey (played by Logan Marshall-Green).\n\nAfter getting sent to juvenile detention, Ryan met a public defender named Sandy Cohen, who eventually took him into his home and let him become part of his family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcKenzie released a book about cryptocurrency, titled \"Easy Money: Cryptocurrency, Casino Capitalism, and the Golden Age of Fraud.\"\n\nThe subject matter of McKenzie's book isn't too bizarre, considering that he has a degree in economics from the University of Virginia and had been vocal about his disdain for cryptocurrency (and the celebrities who support it) in recent years.\n\nAside from playing Ryan Atwood on \"The O.C.,\" McKenzie is perhaps best known for starring as Jim Gordon on Fox's \"Gotham,\" which centered on the young Bruce Wayne/Batman's origin story. The show lasted for five seasons between 2014 and 2019.\n\nWhile on \"Gotham,\" McKenzie made his directorial debut and wrote the scripts for two episodes of the series.\n\nMcKenzie has been married to \"Gotham\" costar Morena Baccarin since 2017. They share a daughter named Frances (born in 2016) and a son named Arthur (born in 2021).\n\nCoincidentally, Morena guest-starred on \"The O.C.\" but the two actors didn't connect at the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMischa Barton played Marissa Cooper, a teen who became increasingly unstable as the show went on.\n\nMarissa tragically died in Ryan's arms on the season three finale, which aired in May 2006.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarton starred on season one of the reality TV show \"The Hills: New Beginnings.\"\n\nThe \"Hills\" revival series lasted for two seasons on MTV, but Barton didn't return for the latter season.\n\nAfter Marissa was shockingly killed off \"The O.C.\" fans wondered about the reasoning behind Barton's exit. Show creator Josh Schwartz told The Daily Beast in 2017 that ratings pressure from the network was one factor that led to the decision to kill off Marissa.\n\n\"It was a complicated chemistry with the cast,\" he added. \"But she certainly wasn't actively seeking to leave the show.\"\n\nIn a 2021 interview with E! News, Barton spoke candidly about her experience on the show and said that she faced \"general bullying from some of the men on set that kind of felt really shitty.\"\n\n\"There were people on that set that were very mean to me,\" she said. \"It wasn't, like, the most ideal environment for a young, sensitive girl who's also been thrust into stardom to have to put up with.\"\n\nBarton also opened up about the challenges of being in the public eye, beginning with feeling sexualized as a child actor, in a 2021 essay for Harper's Bazaar. The star said that she was stalked by paparazzi and often felt unsafe, leading to PTSD.\n\nThe actor was arrested for DUI and driving without a valid license in December 2007. Months later, she was charged with a misdemeanor DUI and pot possession. In a 2008 cover story for Nylon, she said that getting arrested was \"a lot point\" for her.\n\nBarton continued to act, with roles on shows like \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" and \"The Beautiful Life.\"\n\nIn 2016, she competed on season 22 of ABC's \"Dancing With the Stars.\"\n\nBarton has since starred in dramas like \"Deserted, \"Painkillers,\" and \"Ouija House.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdam Brody portrayed the show's sarcastic, comic-book-loving teen named Seth Cohen.\n\nHe was socially awkward and loved bands like Death Cab for Cutie.\n\nDespite being part of the upper-middle class, Seth despised living in Orange County and wanted to leave.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrody now plays a superhero in the DC Extended Universe.\n\nThe actor played the adult alter ego of Jack Dylan Grazer's Freddy Freeman in the \"Shazam!\" films released in 2019 and 2023. Coincidentally, Seth Cohen and Freddy Freeman both have extensive knowledge of comic books.\n\nAfter \"The O.C.\" Brody continued appearing in films and shows.\n\nThis included the cult classic \"Jennifer's Body,\" \"Scream 4,\" and the 2011 film \"The Oranges,\" which costarred his future wife, Leighton Meester.\n\nHe also guest-starred on season three of the hit sitcom \"New Girl\" and starred on the show \"StartUp.\"\n\nBrody and Meester went on to costar in the 2014 movie \"Life Partners.\" The \"O.C.\" alum also had a recurring role on her show \"Single Parents.\"\n\nIn more recent years, Brody starred in the horror movie \"Ready or Not\" and Emerald Fennell's \"Promising Young Woman.\"\n\nHe also had a voice cameo in the 2022 \"Scream\" movie and played Seth Morris on season one of the Hulu/FX miniseries \"Fleishman Is in Trouble.\"\n\nBrody has been married to Meester since 2014. He and the \"Gossip Girl\" star have two kids, a daughter named Arlo Day (born in 2015) and a son (born in 2020) whose name they haven't disclosed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRachel Bilson portrayed Summer Roberts, Marissa's best friend.\n\nBilson was originally cast as a guest star on \"The O.C.\" but her performance impressed show creator Josh Schwartz and she became a series regular.\n\nBilson and Brody dated in real life from 2003 to 2006 and remain on friendly terms to this day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBilson cohosts the podcast \"Broad Ideas\" with her long-time friend Olivia Allen.\n\nThe wide-ranging podcast covers a variety of topics, from sex and relationships to mental health and career challenges. Past guests have included Lucy Hale, Chace Crawford, and Aubrey Plaza.\n\nBilson also cohosted an \"O.C.\" rewatch podcast with costar Melinda Clarke.\n\nFollowing her role on \"The O.C.\" Bilson starred alongside Hayden Christensen in the 2008 sci-fi movie \"Jumper.\" The actors dated in real life, welcoming a daughter named Briar Rose in 2014. They split in 2017, after being together for almost a decade and previously calling off their engagement.\n\nBilson also had a cameo on the series finale of the original \"Gossip Girl\" series and guest starred on a few episodes of \"How I Met Your Mother,\" as the roommate of the titular mom.\n\nShe later starred on the CW series \"Hart of Dixie\" and had a recurring role on season five of the show \"Nashville.\"\n\nMost recently, Bilson appeared on the Fox anthology series \"Accused.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeter Gallagher starred as Sandy Cohen, a public defender and the father of Seth.\n\nSandy grew up in a rough part of the Bronx, with little money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGallagher starred as Andrew Finney on season three of the Apple TV+ drama series \"Truth Be Told.\"\n\nIn the years since \"The O.C.\" Gallagher has appeared in an array of shows and movies. This includes series like \"Californication,\" \"How I Met Your Mother,\" \"New Girl,\" and \"The Gifted.\"\n\nHe also had roles on \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"Grace and Frankie.\"\n\nGallagher's recent film projects include the 2020 rom-com \"Palm Springs\" and the 2021 film \"Zoey's Extraordinary Christmas,\" in which he reprised his role as Mitch.\n\nGallagher has been married to Paula Harwood since 1983 and they have two kids, a son named James and a daughter named Kathryn, who's a singer and actor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKelly Rowan played Kirsten Cohen, Seth's mom.\n\nKirsten was the breadwinner of the Cohen household, earning her income through her work at her father's company known as the Newport Group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter \"The O.C.\" Rowan starred on the TNT drama series \"Perception.\"\n\nThe show ran for three seasons between 2012 and 2015.\n\nRowan also appeared on shows like \"CSI: Miami,\" \"Castle,\" and \"Murdoch Mysteries.\" Her most recent credited role was in the 2016 TV movie \"Tulips in Spring.\"\n\nThe actor also welcomed her first child, a daughter, the year after \"The O.C.\" ended.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTate Donovan portrayed Jimmy Cooper, Marissa's dad.\n\nAt the start of the series, Jimmy was a financial planner who lost $4 million and was the subject of an SEC fraud investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDonovan played Chris Evans' on-screen dad in the 2023 action movie \"Ghosted.\"\n\nDonovan's \"O.C.\" character became less prominent on the show beginning with season two. The next season, he appeared in just three episodes and made his directorial debut.\n\nDonovan returned as a guest star in the final season, as part of an alternate reality episode.\n\nDonovan went on to continue acting and directing after \"The O.C.\" He directed episodes of TV shows like \"Gossip Girl,\" \"Glee,\" \"Madam Secretary,\" and \"Hawaii Five-0.\"\n\nYou may have seen the actor in films like \"Argo,\" \"Manchester by the Sea,\" and \"Rocketman.\"\n\nHe also guest-starred on TV shows including \"Elementary,\" \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,\" and \"MacGyver.\"\n\nAdditionally, Donovan is the recipient of a 2014 Emmy Award, for his work as a producer on \"30 for 30 Shorts.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMelinda Clarke played Julie Cooper, Marissa's mom.\n\nShe was superficial and had expensive taste, which didn't bode well when Jimmy experienced financial hardships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDale starred on The CW's \"Dynasty.\"\n\nAfter playing Caleb on the first two seasons of \"The O.C.\" the veteran actor starred as Bradford Meade on the sitcom \"Ugly Betty.\"\n\nDale also had recurring roles on \"Lost\" and \"Once Upon a Time,\" in addition to guest starring on shows like \"The Mindy Project\" and \"Entourage.\"\n\nMost recently, the actor portrayed Joseph Anders on seasons one through four of The CW's reboot of \"Dynasty.\"\n\nOutside of his TV roles, Dale also appeared in \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,\" \"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,\" and \"Captain America: Civil War.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Carmack played Luke Ward, a bully who constantly picked on Seth.\n\nLuke was the captain of the water polo team and dated Marissa at the start of the series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarmack is known for his role as Dr. Atticus Lincoln on ABC's long-running medical drama \"Grey's Anatomy.\"\n\nAfter \"The O.C.\" Carmack had a minor role in the 2006 rom-com \"Just My Luck,\" which starred Lindsay Lohan and Chris Pine.\n\nHe also guest-starred on shows like \"CSI: NY,\" \"Desperate Housewives,\" and \"NCIS.\"\n\nIn addition, the actor played a musician named Will Lexington on the CMT show \"Nashville,\" which starred Hayden Panettiere as a fictional country music star.\n\nCarmack has been a cast member of \"Grey's Anatomy\" since the season 15 premiere in 2018.\n\nThe actor has been married to Erin Slaver, who he met on the set of \"Nashville,\" since October 2018.
