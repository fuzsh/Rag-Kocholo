        "text": "I think that it's obvious why this is last but I'll say it anyway. He was the enemy of her best friend who had only recently died, he threatened her boyfriend at the time several times until she had to literally pay him to stop, and this was all before their relationship even started. Then, he chased her around for ages despite her constantly saying \"no\" to him, and when they were actually dating it just changed Marissa negatively as a person and drove her away from her friends and family. Finally of course, when they broke up, despite the reasoning for it being him cheating on her and her prom, he became obsessed with her and jealous of Ryan and her's friendship, to the point at which he tried to kill Ryan on the road but killed her instead and left her there to literally die, ran away and didn't own up to it for months.\n\nOk, I'm not sure if this even counts as a real relationship because it was literally just made up by Oliver because he was obsessed with a girl, and the obsession ended up with him holding her hostage and threatening her. Despite the fact that the story and reasoning for it are bad, so was the cover-up of it and the fact that he chose her to be a fake girlfriend. Natalie Bishop was literally his childhood nanny who had initially raised him, but he decided to choose her name as a fake girlfriend, not to mention she was unaware of the whole thing. Oliver also did loads of mad things and constantly blamed it on his \"relationship with Natalie,\" for it to be revealed that it doesn't exist.\n\nWhen I'm watching Season 4 I always forget that this even happened because of the fact that the character dynamics have changed so much since early Season 3. However, this was wild: he was her teacher who was a lot older than her, so it was clearly very inappropriate, and he very obviously used her and her need for control as a way to establish discipline. Not to mention Taylor used her relationship with him to manipulate Seth and Summer AND she actually thought he liked her.\n\nSome people like this couple and some people hate it but it might be controversial, me putting it this low down the list, but I have my reasons. The whole reason they started dating was basically because of a lie that Anna made when she was clearly interested in Seth from the start, but the whole time pretended everything she was doing was to get him and Summer together. When they were dating, though it wasn't a toxic relationship, Seth was clearly still in love with Summer the whole time and that was obvious to Anna, so they were better off as friends.\n\nI HATED this relationship so much. I think it was good that Julie was happy for the first time since Marissa's death, however, I think that had partially to do with Bullit too. The fact is, Frank's a horrible person, who abused his children and wife, and Julie is close to Ryan at this point so she shouldn't have done it in the first place, not to mention Frank also lying to Ryan about dying just to see him.\n\nAlso, the idea of Ryan and Marissa's parents dating is horrible.\n\nOkay, this was probably one of the weirdest relationships on the show. Before this happened, Luke had actually changed and was a good person and friend. However, they had massive age differences, not to mention the fact that Julie was in a relationship at the time yet was having an affair with her teenage daughter's ex-boyfriend who had cheated on her. Also, Luke was genuinely in love with Julie but she just used him and when he saw her get engaged to Caleb, it resulted in him having to go to the hospital after a car crash and initially drove him out of Newport.\n\nOk so fair enough this wasn't at all a toxic relationship and they were ☺︎ together. I just think it was rushed into and changed the dynamic of the show and characters. Firstly, their relationship was very rushed. They began the series as just friends, not close at all, and by the fifth episode they were dating, despite them both still grieving over the death of Marissa, who was literally the love of Ryan's life.\n\nAlso, this relationship completely changed both of these characters to make the relationship even slightly make sense. Ryan went from being a moody, violent, and sarcastic character to being more lively and \"funny\" (at least for him) and Taylor went from being scheming and obsessive to not scheming at all and being slightly less obsessive, as well as being just nicer — though still annoying — and just less Taylor. I think that though the relationship itself wasn't bad, the concept of it just didn't make sense and was maybe just created because Ryan and Taylor both needed someone to date to distract from Marissa's death and Taylor's recent divorce.\n\nThis relationship wasn't displayed much throughout the show, only that one time when Jimmy kissed a married Kirsten and in the alternate reality episode. However, we all know that they were previously together as teenagers and Jimmy is just a bad person who shouldn't be with Kirsten or get in the way of Sandy and Kirsten's relationship. This is just another annoying relationship that should've just been left out of the storyline.\n\nThis relationship was just bad. I love Marissa and love Luke when he isn't beating people up, cheating on people, or having an affair with his ex's mum. HOWEVER, it was just a bad relationship from the start because Luke was overprotective of Marissa and Marissa just didn't like him that much. When they're not dating though, they have a really nice friendship and were good friends so I think that it's good they broke up and were just friends.\n\nThey were kinda irrelevant and only together for like three episodes, but they weren't good. Johnny ignored Kasey to hang out with Marissa and it was obvious he was in love with her. You can't really blame Kasey for not wanting to be with him BUT did she really have to cheat on him with Volcheck who was his literal enemy????\n\nThis was a weird relationship too. they got married out of nowhere, and though it's not mentioned, I'm guessing Taylor did this so quickly to annoy her mum and because she was grieving. When Taylor wanted a divorce, this guy literally just didn't let her, and when he finally did, he wrote a book about her and tried to compete with Ryan for her, so he's basically just really annoying.\n\nI like both of these characters, and their friendship too, but I think it wasn't good for them to be in a relationship. Ryan just left Chino without telling Teresa, and they were only together at the end of Season 1 and beginning of Season 2 because of the baby which Teresa lied about. I know this was because she cared about Ryan, but it was definitely wrong. In Season 3 they almost got together, but I think Teresa was right that they shouldn't because everything had changed so much."
