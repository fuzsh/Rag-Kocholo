        "text": "Twenty-Something Girls vs. Thirty-Something Women\n\nCarrie and the girls get a share in the Hamptons...where they deal with age disparities: Charlotte gets crabs from a younger guy and Carrie finds that Mr. Big is dating a 26-year-old girl.\n\nTragedy\n\nA frantic 911 call is logged and it appears a woman is being attacked in her car. Detectives Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni) think it could be the carjack rapist, but after much digging, they discover the victim is Annika Bergeron (Karen Goberman). Her only relative is her sister, Laura (Marisa Ryan), who lives in New Jersey and tells the detectives that Annika is eight months pregnant. Her doctor also warns them that she has a dangerous condition and must have a caesarian section or both she and her baby will die.\n\nGuest\n\nBefore travelling to New York City for a conference, Nora must resolve some pending issues. When she arrives at the event, she has to face unexpected and rather odd inconveniences. Moreover, she meets someone allegedly able of taking her pain away.\n\nYou Can Go Home Again\n\nWhile Cory is anxious about getting back home to see Topanga and Shawn, Eric and Allan are anxious about different - yet very similar - turning points in their lives.\n\nDarkness\n\nDuring a blackout, a panic-button alert sends Detectives Ed Green (Jesse L. Martin) and Cyrus Lupo (Jeremy Sisto) to the home of a high level corporate executive, where they find a murdered housekeeper and his missing wife and daughter. Suspect Marty Dressler (guest star Patrick Stump, \"Fall Out Boy\"), an employee who works in the company's IT department, leads the detectives to the murderous plan. Also starring: Sam Waterston, S. Epatha Merkerson, Linus Roache, and Alana De La Garza."
