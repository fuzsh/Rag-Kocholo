        "text": "Ryan and Marisa met a little later in life thanks to the internet. Yes, they met on an internet dating website! While quickly bonding over their love of Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, music, renaissance faires, Legos, and the Green Bay Packers, Ryan and Marisa fell head over heels for one another. After chatting nonstop for a week, Ryan asked Marisa out and she said yes! Sensing Ryan was a true \"diamond in the rough,\" she decided they should go on a proper date complete with a sitdown dinner and activity (Not Panera lol!). So, for their first official date, they met up at a restaurant in Elmhurst recommended by Ryan's brother (Thanks, Tim!) and accidently crashed a wedding reception at a fancy bowling alley called Pinstripes. Their wedding photographer even snapped a photo of them because they â€œlooked like a very happy couple.\" Needless to say, they were smitten with one another. Marisa even asked Ryan to be her boyfriend on their second date! Soon enough, they met each other's parents, siblings, and close friends. Within six months, they moved into an apartment together with Marisa's cat, Coco. This proved interesting for two reasons: Coco wasn't sure about him and Ryan is allergic to cats. Now, of course, they all live in harmony! For a few years, they survived many highs and lows together (including a pandemic) in their little apartment. After a couple maybe-not-so-subtle hints, Ryan was ready to propose. Marisa, who was preoccupied with work, was truly oblivious to Ryan's tireless planning with both their families. Then, on Dec. 24, 2020, Ryan asked Marisa to marry him as they were celebrating Christmas surrounded by the people she loves most. It wasn't long until they decided to make their next big step together: Buying a house! Now, Ryan and Marisa (and Coco!) are living in a beautiful home in Aurora, Illinois, and can't wait to spend the rest of their lives together."
