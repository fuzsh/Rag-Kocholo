        "text": "Robert R. McCafferty, a gentle mentor who told his girls to always smile and “be kind to others”, fondly known as “Mac” and “Bob”, age 83, of Coraopolis, passed away peacefully on Thursday, September 13, 2018 at home surrounded by his loving family. Born in Ambridge on September 18, 1934 to the late Eva (Gause) and Robert Tracy McCafferty, Jr. Cherished husband for 57 years to the late Sandra D. (Amerando) McCafferty who he married on March 2, 1957. In addition to his parents, he was preceded in death by his sisters Jackie Guyer, Connie Moser, Donna McCafferty and Bobette Hobson. Beloved father of Robin Bartley of CA, Lynn Adland (Tom) of IL, Teri Tuschak (Tom) of MD and Debbie Garuccio (John) of Crescent; loving grandfather of Marisa, Ryan, Tyler (Hillary) Courtney (Mike), Nick, Vinnie and Rachel. Bob loved his Shih Tzu, Missy who also passed. A graduate of Aliquippa High School, Bob was proud to be from Aliquippa. In 1957, he settled in Coraopolis, a perfect place for his family. His top priority was his family. He was a true family man who loved to spend time with his wife, children and grandchildren along with making every holiday special. Bob was a steelworker for 32 years with A K Steel in Ambridge but will be remembered as the Friendly Barber with a great sense of humor at the end of town. He owned and operated McCafferty’s Barber Shop from 1962 to December 2017. Somehow, he also made time for his beloved town, Coraopolis, where he served on the School Board and City Council. Bob also was a member of St. Catherine of Siena, F & AM Blue Lodge #674, and the United States Steel Workers. Please join the family to celebrate this great man’s life, visitation Sunday 2-4, 7-9 at Copeland’s Coraopolis, 867 Fifth Ave. where prayers will be recited on Monday at 9:20 AM followed by Mass at St. Catherine of Siena. Celebrant, Father Bob Zajdel. Burial will follow in Resurrection Cemetery. In lieu of flowers, please support the Coraopolis Volunteer Fire Department with donations in his name. The family would like to thank and acknowledge Catholic Hospice and his care givers; Teresa, Paula, Dawn, Shelby and Maria.\n\nTo send flowers to the family or plant a tree in memory of Robert R. McCafferty, please visit our floral store."
