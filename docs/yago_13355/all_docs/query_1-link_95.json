        "text": "Early life\n\nSisto was born in Grass Valley, California, the son of Reedy Gibbs, an actress, and Richard \"Dick\" Sisto, a jazz musician and educator. Sisto has an older sister, Meadow Sisto, who is an actress mostly known for playing Caroline in the 1992 film Captain Ron. Sisto's parents divorced and his father was remarried to fabric artist Penny Sisto. Sisto lived with his mother and sister, and has said that his father's absence made parenting his own son more difficult. He was raised in the lower Sierra Nevada Mountains, before moving to Chicago at age seven. He attended Hayfield Montessori School in Louisville, Kentucky for first grade, then Francis W. Parker School in Chicago. Sisto worked with local theater companies Cherry Street Theater and the Absolute Theater Company. He appeared in the film Grand Canyon while attending high school. After studying at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), he began acting full-time.\n\n1991–99: Beginnings and Clueless\n\nSisto made his acting debut in the 1991 drama film Grand Canyon, starring Kevin Kline and Steve Martin.

Martin's Ed Green. Sisto had already appeared on the show, as a lawyer, in the previous season's finale. Sisto stayed on for the series' final three seasons, and his character became partners with Anthony Anderson's Detective Kevin Bernard after Martin left the series near the end of season 18.

The role was originally portrayed by Adam Rothenberg, but after the series was given its premiere date, the role was recast. It was poorly received by critics and was cancelled after airing only 3 episodes due to weak ratings by ABC.\n\nSisto was then cast alongside Archie Panjabi in ABC's drama pilot The Jury, but the project was not picked up to series. He currently stars as Freddy Green in Antoine Fuqua's drama series Ice, opposite Cam Gigandet and Donald Sutherland.\n\nPersonal life\n\nOn August 30, 1993, Sisto married actress Marisa Ryan in Las Vegas; both were 18 years old.
