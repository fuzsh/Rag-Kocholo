        "text": "… the stars aligned before we even knew it. We met as opening team Cast Members at the Disney Skyliner. While our first meeting was at the Epcot Skyliner station, we bonded during our many shifts working at the Hollywood Studios station. A friendship had immediately formed and quickly grew deeper into something more. We describe it as though we have known each other forever, bound together by an invisible string — one single thread of gold that tied \"me\" to \"you\". Our first date was in Epcot and Magic Kingdom, where we waited in line for a broken PeopleMover. We filled the time talking, laughing, and bettering our understanding of one another as well as our love. Deep within, we knew that we were developing our future. The Disney Parks continued to be special places for us, and we would spend many more long queue lines becoming special places for one another. We each found our home.\n\n… as Jake Peralta so eloquently stated. With Disney being such an integral part of our story, it makes the perfect location for our wedding. The first time Ryan asked Marisa what she would want in a wedding was while walking past Sea Breeze Point. Serendipitously, this venue was available on the exact date that we have always wanted. We can't wait to celebrate with you on October 6th!"
