        "text": "01 of 11\n\nAlicia Silverstone (Cher Horowitz)\n\nAlicia Silverstone played Cher Horowitz, a “sporadically” intelligent young woman with a deep closet and a rich vocabulary.\n\nSilverstone's first film role was in the 1993 thriller The Crush. She also appeared in several Aerosmith music videos like “Cryin’” and “Crazy” around that time, but Clueless was her breakout role. Her next major movie was the 1997 superhero blockbuster Batman & Robin, where she played Batgirl.\n\nShe made her Broadway debut in 2002 in a stage version of The Graduate. The following year, she starred in the NBC comedy-drama Miss Match, which won her a Golden Globe for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy. Silverstone soon advocated for plant-based eating and wrote a book about vegan nutrition, The Kind Diet, in 2009. This was paired with a website, The Kind Life, which is still active.\n\nIn 2012, Silverstone reunited with Clueless writer-director Amy Heckerling for the vampire comedy film Vamps. She also had a recurring role on the ABC sitcom Suburgatory alongside her Clueless castmate Jeremy Sisto. More recently, she's appeared in The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017), Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (2017), Book Club (2018), and Bad Therapy (2020).\n\nSilverstone stepped back into her iconic yellow plaid outfit in 2023, reprising her Clueless character in a Super Bowl ad for the online shopping platform Rakuten. She was joined by Clueless costar Elisa Donovan as Amber, re-enacting the film's debate scene.\n\nReflecting on her connection with her Clueless cohorts, Silverstone told Entertainment Weekly about her notably special bond with Heckerling. “Amy and I have seen each other a lot over the years,\" she said in 2023. “In fact, not until I was about 30 did we really, deeply reconnect, just because life goes on and you just sort of go about your business. But when the movie kept getting retrospectives, we just came together and we have this special bond, a love and respect for each other.\"\n\nSilverstone married rock musician Christopher Jarecki in 2005; their son, Bear, was born in 2011. The pair split in 2018.\n\n02 of 11\n\nStacey Dash (Dionne Davenport)\n\nStacey Dash played Cher's bestie Dionne, who dazzled audiences with her collection of outrageous hats.\n\nDash started working in Hollywood in the 1980s, notably appearing in the Richard Pryor comedy Moving (1988). She later worked in the Damon Wayans film Mo' Money (1992) and the Danny DeVito movie Renaissance Man (1994) before landing her breakout role as Dionne.\n\nIn fact, she was amazed to secure a gig portraying a teenager in Clueless. \"I was 27, and I was playing this high school student,\" Dash told EW in 2012, \"and I had a son at home who was 6 years old.\" Still, she was a perfect fit for the part, and she continued to star as Dionne for three seasons on the Clueless spinoff sitcom, which aired on ABC and UPN from 1996 to 1999.\n\nDash appeared in the Kanye West music video for \"All Falls Down\" in 2004.

I was just there to help them facilitate chemistry reads. I just remember when she came in and did hers, because when she walked out of the room, I was like, 'You guys! Did you see that?' As if they wouldn't know. They were like, 'Yes, we saw that!' They were excited too, but it was my first time. She was just so good.\"\n\nMurphy began taking on bigger roles in the 2000s, including the biopic Riding in Cars With Boys (2001), the drama 8 Mile as Eminem's love interest (2002), and the romantic comedies Uptown Girls (2003) opposite a young Dakota Fanning and Just Married with Ashton Kutcher (2003).
