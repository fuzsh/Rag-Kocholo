        "text": "Meet Marissa and Ryan! This fall Fort Wayne engagement session was a blast – Even though they are from around Fort Wayne, they drove all the way from Anderson Indiana where they go to school just to have us photograph their engagement! Read on to learn how Marissa and Ryan met, their plans for their future together, and, of course, see their photos!\n\nMarissa and Ryan had two awesome outfits. They were very cozy for fall and gave such a warm feeling to the photos! Marissa’s first outfit was a grey sweater, jeans, and some brown boots while Ryan wore a black and white flannel, jeans, and some boots. Their second outfits were great too! Marissa wore a flowy long sleeve white top and black leggings. Ryan wore a brown long sleeve shirt with black pants. Needless to say, these two knew how to dress for cozy fall weather!\n\nThese two are both finishing up their last year at Anderson University in Indiana. They actually met while at school! They drove all the way to Fort Wayne for their engagement session with us. We were so excited to meet up with them at Metea Park where the fall colors were at it’s peak! Everything was just glowing with all the warm tones of autumn in Indiana, so it was perfect for some engagement photos. At the end of their session, they were even willing to get into the water of the beautiful pond at Metea Park. It was super cold, but they had such great attitudes about it!\n\nMarissa and Ryan will be getting married next summer at Certuri’s in Fort Wayne, an awesome wedding venue with nice getting ready spaces and an awesome reception area. We loved photographing this fall Fort Wayne engagement, and we can’t wait to capture their wedding next summer. We hope you enjoy your engagement photos – Happy planning!\n\nCheers,\n\n– Dustin & Corynn\n\nIf you’d like to see some of our other engagement sessions, click the names below and meet some of our awesome couples!\n\nGwen & Brandon – Downtown Engagement\n\nEmily & Zach – Purdue University Engagement\n\nIzabella & Kris – Metea Park Engagement\n\nMeet Marissa and Ryan!
