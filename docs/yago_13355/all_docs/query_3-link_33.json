        "text": "Marisa & Ryan’s Wedding Day\n\nScotland Ontario\n\nSo many August weddings making their way onto the blog and next up is Marisa and Ryan’s stunning day! If you are a dog, cow or goat lover you are going to want to scroll this blog because this wedding has all three! Marisa and Ryan were originally planning their 2020 wedding at a venue in London but as changes needed to be made (pandemic life) they ended up moving their day to their beautiful property in Scotland Ontario.\n\nAnd when I say beautiful property, I mean it! Not only is their house lovely, but they have acres of land, a trail through the woods, room for chickens, ducks and goats and plenty of space for their three dogs. It was such a amazing property to photograph and it led to lots of gorgeous photos!\n\nWe began the day with Ryan and captured some details as well as him getting ready. We then headed just upstairs to capture Marisa with her best friends, her lovely bridal details and her getting into her wedding dress.\n\nA few months before the wedding, Marisa emailed myself and her planner Courtney with the idea to do a ‘fake’ first look with one of their good friends. We were incredibly excited and it was such a hilarious moment! Their friend wore a white dress and we proceeded with the first look as planned only for Ryan to turn around and see his friend instead of Marisa. The photos were so perfect!\n\nWe moved into the actual first look (which the dogs were more then happy to be apart of) and lots of couples portraits before heading back right into their sweet ceremony! The rest of the evening was filled with loving speeches, dances and candid moments. Plus golden hour photos with COWS which was just amazing!\n\nCongratulations Marisa and Ryan!!\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichelle\n\nVendor Love:\n\nPlanner: The Little Things Weddings & Events\n\nPhotography: Michelle A Photography\n\nCaterer: Tracy Winkworth\n\nMake-Up: AlyCat Wedding Hair & Make-Up\n\nDress: Valentina Bridal & Couture\n\nSuit: Sidonio’s Custom Men’s Shop\n\n10% Off ALL Wedding Packages Booked between February 14th and February 28th 2022!\n\nClick HERE to go directly to my contact form to book your free consult today!\n\n10% Off ALL Wedding Packages Booked between February 14th and February 28th 2022!\n\nClick HERE to go directly to my contact form to book your free consult today!\n\n“Michelle is a featured and award winning London Ontario Wedding Photographer, who loves to capture unique relationships and create lasting memories!
