        "text": "All the creative mistakes and backstage drama of The O.C.’s third season—the main cast’s restlessness, the strangely quick resolution of season two’s big cliffhanger, basically everything having to do with poor, doomed surfer Johnny—converged in its final episode, “The Graduates.” Volchok, still fixated on Marissa—and angry with Ryan for screwing up a plan to steal a luxury car from one of Sandy and Kirsten’s neighbors—runs Ryan’s Jeep off the road, killing Marissa. It’s a story with a lot of blame to go around behind the scenes, almost none of it falling at the feet of Mischa Barton herself.\n\nBarton was the initial face of The O.C., but she never entirely seemed at home on the show in the way so many of her costars—not coincidentally, all of them older than her—had been. Barton was also being asked to burn the candle at both ends in a way no one else on the show was.\n\nMischa Barton (Marissa Cooper): There were years when I only had six days off in the whole year. It was tiring. It was a lot. And when you weren’t filming, you were promoting the show and doing press and touring. It was exhausting. I don’t think I realized how exhausting it was for a while, though.\n\nRachel Bilson (Summer Roberts): I think there was pressure from her mom wanting Mischa to be doing [a lot]. I think it was probably too much for this teenager to be doing as much as she had to do. And she did it gracefully.\n\nAlan Dale (Caleb Nichol): I know all the stories and everything, but my experience of her was that she was delightful. I thought she worked really hard to fit in and do as well as she could.\n\nRachel Bilson: Nuala [Barton, Mischa’s mother] was always nice to me, but I think she definitely had that, Make sure that Summer doesn’t have more things to do or say than Marissa vibe. And I do think it was, like, stage mom.\n\nJosh Schwartz (creator/executive producer): When you are the breadwinner for your family, it’s really complicated. As a family member, you have certain priorities for the person you are looking after, but when they’re the manager and this is their client, it’s a different set of priorities. And I think it can be very challenging to keep those priorities separated.\n\nPatrick Norris (director): Look, it’s hard being a mom of a teenager on a TV show. Sure, we can say the mom is a pain in the ass, but I’ve been on so many teen shows where I’ve seen this play out. Where the mom is the advocate for the teen that is working fourteen to sixteen hours a day, no life, and rushed back the next day to do the same. In that sense, I couldn’t have anything negative to say. She was a protective mom.\n\nBob DeLaurentis (executive producer): Her mother was concerned for Mischa’s career— that she should be on the precipice, by Season Three, of starting to get some offers to be in the company of some other young female Hollywood actors. And they weren’t coming.\n\nStephanie Savage (executive producer): As time went on, she had a lot of responsibilities outside the show, which I think contributed to her feelings of unhappiness. It would be that everyone would shoot on a Fraturday [a production day planned to begin relatively late on a Friday and end sometime after midnight on a Saturday] and everyone would be so tired and spend the weekend sleeping and chilling out. And Mischa would have had to have flown to Ireland for the Irish Oscars, or gone to Harrods to open a boutique.\n\nLisa Cochran (unit production manager): Mischa wanted to leave. That’s not a secret, I think.\n\nBob DeLaurentis: She was starting to, I think, be really, really distracted. I could see that all was not happy, that she was going through stuff, and that their relationship was complicated. And guess what? Teenage girls and their mothers, it can be a bumpy road, especially when your mother is your manager and around all the time. And I think she was itching to get out and have a life.\n\nRachel Bilson: [By] Season Three, it was a lot of, “Oh, we’re doing this again.” It just seemed like maybe [she was] not as much into it. I don’t want to speak [for her]; I think she’s dealt with so much, and she’s been pretty vocal about how awful this experience was for her. Come Season Three, I don’t think she really wanted to be there. But I think there were a lot of people that maybe didn’t want to be there.\n\nBob DeLaurentis: Even when you thought, Well, she’s not really passionate about this, or, She’s not maybe as prepared as she could be, she would always come in, hit the mark, say the lines, deliver the performance. I remember her as being in many ways the most reliable of the four kids. And I have very, very fond memories of her, because I think her life got incredibly overcomplicated from that point on.\n\nMelinda Clarke (Julie Cooper-Nichol): Yes, there were days where you could feel negative energy. I can’t even point to anything super-specific because everyone’s so professional. I never saw anyone be unprofessional.\n\nThe producers have many decisions they wish they could have changed.\n\nBob DeLaurentis: If we went back to when we were casting The O.C., I would look to find an older actress. Because the other three had an ease and a facility with each other, and I don’t think they ever had that with her. And it was hurtful. I think she felt it. I don’t know how acutely she felt it, but she didn’t mix and mingle a lot. She’d be sitting there with her book.\n\nStephanie Savage: There was one day when we were shooting, and it was a really nice vibe on set. Everyone was sitting around laughing, telling stories. Mischa was sitting in her chair out by the pool house by herself, with her back to us, reading a CAA script. And looking back on that moment, I’m like, Why didn’t I just walk over there and go, “Hey, everyone’s sitting over here having a nice time and chatting, and we’d love for you to join us”? Whether she said yes or no, that was up to her. But I remember just looking over with a very immature feeling of, I guess she’s too cool for us now to sit around and laugh, versus a more mature feeling of, Maybe she feels left out.\n\nThat’s just a small moment, but that was definitely the vibe of it. Originally, we did a lot of things together, but as she got her different boyfriends, and was going to nightclubs with Paris and Nicole and being in Perez Hilton, she was more her own island. In retrospect, I think that was a very scary, dangerous island that she shouldn’t have been on by herself. We had the ability to give her a little tugboat to go back and forth. And we didn’t do that, and I regret that.\n\nHowever unhappy Barton may have been, Marissa might have survived if not for the shifting winds at Fox. After months of generic network pressure to generate “promotable” storylines, a more specific and definitive edict was delivered from on high.\n\nYvette Urbina (programming executive, Fox): [Then Fox Entertainment chairman Peter] Liguori, he’s the one that wanted Marissa to die, so let’s start there.\n\nStephanie Savage: The network was saying, “What you’re doing isn’t really working, and you guys need to do something big or this is the end.” We had started joking about “faux-mos”—promos that they had cut that made it seem like things happen that did not happen, because they were so dissatisfied with the lack of incident on the show that they were making things up. Basically, they were like, “You have to kill someone, or equivalent,” which, there really is no equivalent. And it had to be a main character. When they got to the promo, it was literally, “One of these people is going to die,” and then you cut to the eight series regulars.\n\nYvette Urbina: No, I think it was specifically [Marissa].\n\nFox’s orders coincided with the writing staff hitting a wall with Marissa as a character.\n\nJohn Stephens (writer/producer): This comments so much upon the paucity of our imaginations, but we didn’t know where to go with the story. The Marissa-Ryan relationship was so integral to the show, and we felt like we had gone through so many different permutations of it that we didn’t know what the next step of it was. So we thought at the very least, forcing Ryan to deal with the grief that would happen from that, we could understand how we could turn that into another season.\n\nJ. J. Philbin (writer/producer): Ryan and Marissa’s relationship had this tragic feel to it. When we were actually taking time with them just being together as a couple, it was hard. I don’t know, tragedy felt baked in, and you don’t want her character to be a bummer.\n\nBob DeLaurentis: The staff felt that we had written every iteration of this story that could be written. And there was no place left to go. And the discussion then turned to, “What do you do? Do you take Mischa out of the show? Because that is a huge deal. Or do we find a way to sideline Mischa?” The nature of the show was, we didn’t really do stories that we didn’t run through Ryan. If another character goes off, we didn’t really follow that character.\n\nBarton was not the only dissatisfied member of the cast, nor was she even the most vocal about it. No serious thought was ever given to killing off any of the others, though.\n\nJosh Schwartz: We decided we would not kill Ryan, Seth, or Sandy. Because they were the core of the show. Though they would have gladly traded places.\n\nStephanie Savage: Not Peter [Gallagher], but Adam [Brody] and Ben would have happily been killed.\n\nBen McKenzie (Ryan Atwood): Adam definitely said that, I’m sure. I don’t remember my mindset at the time. So I don’t know that I said it quite as strongly as Adam, but I certainly can understand.\n\nJosh Schwartz: Quite frankly, creatively, the show is about these two. This was the calculation at the time, and in hindsight, it was a miscalculation. But the feeling was, we couldn’t do the show without Seth and Ryan.\n\nWe thought we could do this, it would be shocking, but it would reinvigorate the show creatively. Because it would so fundamentally shake up some of the dynamics of the show, which had probably started to grow stale at that point. And again, had I been smarter earlier, there was probably more life to have gotten out of the show by putting Marissa with Seth, or getting Luke and Marissa back together. There’s a lot of dynamics we could have explored that I think would have allowed the show to keep reinventing itself, but still be itself. But we didn’t do those things, and we were at a place where they really wanted something big and shocking, and it felt like the future of the show was up in the air.\n\nSo there were business reasons, and then there were creative reasons. We felt like Marissa was always a character who had a tragic strain to her. The end of the Tijuana episode and the end of Season Three echo each other. It wasn’t outside of the realm of possibility that her character could die, as it was always on the table, even from the very beginning of the show. And it certainly felt—just very cynically—like we would be drumming up a lot of publicity for the show, in a year where we felt like we were becoming irrelevant.\n\nStephanie Savage: And then the [Television Without Pity] message board not liking Marissa, I won’t say it was the determining factor, but it definitely was a factor in feeling like, Well, we could do this [kill her], and it would be okay.\n\nSara Morrison (Television Without Pity recapper): On the forums [at the time], everybody loves Seth, everybody loves Julie, everybody loves Summer. People like Ryan. And then everyone hated Marissa. Just hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated, hated.\n\nDaniel Blau Rogge (Television Without Pity recapper): Any re-watch or reevaluation of a show that came from a time before the present is going to require a tough look at our treatment of women overall. I’m sure my recaps of The O.C. were at least 37 percent, “Marissa, well she’s really skinny, isn’t she!”\n\nBob DeLaurentis: I was out of town. I got on a pay phone, and I called Josh, and I said, “I think we finally have to deal with this as a reality. Do we want to take this step?” I had come up with, I don’t want to say what it was, but it was a version of sidelining her that kept her in the Ryan world. It was a bad idea. As you say in the writers’ room, “Here’s the bad pitch version.” And Josh thought about it for about a second and a half, and he said, “No, if we’re going to do it, we should just do it.”\n\nSavage had generally gotten along well with Barton, but she and Schwartz were afraid to even discuss the idea with their star before committing to it.\n\nStephanie Savage: Again, instead of talking to her about it as adults, we were like, “Well, we think that would work out great for her.” And then just made this decision.\n\nJosh Schwartz: And then made it Bob’s problem to deliver the news. Because again, I was too chickenshit to have those conversations. Bob had the first conversation and tried to lay it out for Mischa and her mom. And their response was not excitement and gratitude and relief. They were angry—and rightfully so.\n\nBob DeLaurentis: I had a good relationship with Mischa, and when we decided that Mischa wasn’t going to continue on the show, I called Nuala, and we had an hour-long conversation that wasn’t fun for either of us.\n\nMischa Barton: It was a little bit of a bummer. But it was sort of headed in the direction that it was becoming inevitable, I guess. The character was just doing too much. And I think they ran out of places for her to go. It was not the best thing in the world, [but] there wasn’t much you could do at that point. It was whether she could sail off into the sunset, or die. At that point, I guess it’s better to have the more dramatic ending.\n\nPeter Gallagher (Sandy Cohen): That was a confusing time. I felt sad for her, just to be cast out like that. I didn’t know all the ins and outs of all the stuff that was going on, because why would anybody tell me anything?\n\nBen McKenzie: I do remember her being upset before. And yeah, I guess that sounds right that she was probably also upset [to be killed off]. It’s a “damned if you do, damned if you don’t” thing. She was younger, so she was dealing with this whole mess of feelings that we were all dealing with to some degree, but hers were probably even more acute. So I don’t blame her. But it did become this situation that I think something had to give. So Josh, Bob, and Stephanie did what they had to do.\n\nMischa Barton: I really don’t want to get into it at length. But there was a lot going on with the producers. I ultimately don’t get to make any decisions. That’s a fact. I had to do whatever my contract said I had to do. But I think that was decided it was the best thing for the show in general.\n\nThe writers had been forced to abandon plans for Marissa to be involved in a car accident at the end of the first batch of Season One episodes. Three years later, they went back to the idea.\n\nJosh Schwartz: We had originally talked about a storyline where the car went into the water, and Ryan was trying desperately to open it, like a Chappaquiddick thing. And that was so horrific. And, frankly, quite hard to produce.\n\nStephanie Savage: Also, One Tree Hill was having a car drive off of a bridge into water. And Peter Roth [then the chairman of Warner Bros. Television Group] said, “Come on, Stephanie, they need this.”\n\nThe atmosphere in the days leading up to the car crash scene was complicated for all involved.\n\nMischa Barton: It was starting to get emotional for everyone. But we’re all professional. So we had some really nice last scenes together, like when we're all hanging out in the pool.\n\nBob DeLaurentis: It’s a terrible way to work. It’s one thing to have to leave a show. But to be working there, knowing you’ve been asked to leave, it’s pretty bad. In the conversation I had with Nuala, she kept circling back to, “How can you guys do this? She’s one of the Core Four.”\n\nBen McKenzie: I remember it being awkward. I think everyone had feelings that they weren’t able to articulate at the time, or certainly didn’t want to share with each other. But it was also sad to mark the end of this run of her character.\n\nLisa Cochran: Shooting that final episode was incredibly emotional for everybody. We all had been on pins and needles, and then as we’re out back shooting the car wreck, it became real for me, and I think some of the crew as well.\n\nMelinda Clarke: She’s unhappy on the show, but does she want to be killed off? I remember her being very sad that last week. We were having some moments where I could tell she was sad that she was leaving the show.\n\nBen McKenzie: She was pretty closed off at that point so I’m not sure [how she was doing]. I’m sure she was upset, but I don’t really know.\n\nMischa Barton: The crew was quite upset. It was pretty emotional at that point, because we’d formed such close bonds. I just really wanted to do the character justice at the end of it. I don’t think that had been depicted that much on television for teenagers: she literally dies and she’s covered in blood and he pulls her out of a wrecked car. It’s just heavy material. And once I saw that the crew was getting upset, it become quite an intense shoot.\n\nBob DeLaurentis: In Mischa’s way, she did a good job. I don’t think she phoned it in.\n\nThe aftermath of the crash is a triple callback, with Ryan carrying Marissa out of the car as we cut to footage of him similarly carrying her out of the alley in Tijuana, while Imogen Heap’s cover of “Hallelujah” is meant to invoke both the Season One finale and the shooting of Trey. Ryan offers to go for help, but Marissa—whether aware of how badly she’s hurt, or just afraid to be left alone—begs Ryan to stay with her, until the life leaves her eyes.\n\nWhile some members of the creative team at the time thought the story was a worthwhile gamble, it’s hard to find anyone willing to argue in favor of it now.\n\nAdam Brody: I felt then, and still do, that you could put her on ice in an economic way. I remember on 90210, characters going to rehab for a while, or people would disappear for a year but not disappear disappear. I’m sure she was a little unhappy. I’m sure she was a little bored. And at the same time, I highly doubt she wanted to be publicly, dramatically killed and quasi-fired. I’m sure it didn’t feel good.\n\nKelly Rowan (Kirsten Cohen): I thought it was the biggest mistake they were going to make. That whole foursome, the chemistry with those four actors, screwing with that, I thought was a big mistake. I don’t know the specifics of why that decision was made. I was almost killed by a semi [in Season Two]. There was this whole thing going on, where we don’t know which cast member we’re going to kill. We were all worried about our mortgage payments at that point; “Oh, are we unemployed and looking for a job?” But then when we found out that it was Mischa, it was sad to lose that character.\n\nStephanie Savage: The first time I watched it, I watched it with Josh and Matt Ramsey, and I was just bawling. I was like, What have we done? Not just that it was sad that Marissa died, but that we made a terrible, terrible mistake.\n\nSavage’s tears about this episode were not isolated to 2006; by the time she has finished delivering this answer, she is again crying heavily.\n\nJosh Schwartz: J. J. and [her husband] Mike Schur came to my house to watch the episode, because they had been on a trip and hadn’t seen it. Mike Schur was like, “Really good episode of television.” And J. J. was sobbing hysterically, I’m sure having the exact same feelings that [Stephanie] had. And I’m feeling like, We’ve saved the show. This is going to be epic. No one’s going to see this coming.\n\nJosh Schwartz: And then Mischa did an interview where she revealed that she got killed, right before the show.\n\nI don’t think it was intentional. Maybe it was, but it certainly drew a lot of eyeballs to the show that night. And the night that it aired, the message boards were lighting up with all of these people [upset]. All I had in my head was the criticism of the Marissa character and people feeling like we were in redundant storylines, and the writers didn’t know how to write for the character. And then all of these voices on the Internet and early Tumblr exploded, like a primordial howl from the early Internet into the night sky. Of grief, disbelief, anger, way louder than any voices had ever been complaining about the direction of the character. I very quickly realized, Oh my God, what have we done? I think we made a terrible mistake.\n\nDaniel Blau Rogge: I think there’s an extent to which the boards would judge the character—“Marissa is entitled!” “Marissa is annoy- ing!” “Marissa is too skinny!”—but that the rhetoric would at times spill over to more of a judgment of Mischa Barton herself. The show killing her off led to a backlash when viewers were like, “THAT IS NOT WHAT WE MEANT.”\n\nSara Morrison: People get joy out of picking apart or talking about or making fun of some things on your show. I guess that’s true for the recaps, too. It doesn’t necessarily mean that they know more about how to write a TV show than you. I think a lot of the sentiment was that it’s really fun to pile on something and be a part of a group effort. I think even if you don’t like the character, it’s that you don’t want to see her so much. It’s not that you want her to die.\n\nMorrison is horrified to be reminded that her headline for the finale recap was “A Twig, Snapped.”\n\nSara Morrison: Oh, no. Oh, that’s terrible. I would not have [written that now]. Oh, that’s really mean.\n\nStephanie Savage: But then there were all these other people that were not on the Internet in the same way, that were less articulate, that were less snarky, that didn’t have the tone of that Television Without Pity board. They were just beside themselves with grief, they did fan art of angels carrying Marissa to Heaven, or a thousand tears on the ground—religious iconography, like Virgin of Guadalupe–level Marissa worship. And I felt, Oh, I guess there was a whole other audience that was connecting to this character in a different way.\n\nSara Morrison: Tell them I’m sorry!\n\nMischa Barton: I remember after Marissa died, people being pretty hysterical and coming up to me in airports, crying about it. I thought that was shocking, because it’s TV, you know?\n\nJohn Stephens: Every now and then, people will learn I was on the show, and usually the first thing out of their mouths is, “Why did you kill Marissa?” Once, my wife and I were on our honeymoon, on a safari in Botswana, and we’re sitting around the campfire in the Kalahari Desert, and this woman’s there with their teenage daughter and they find out I was on The O.C. I’m here under this glorious African sky. And this girl said, “Why did you kill Marissa?!?!” I’m like, Really?!\n\nKelly Rowan: My daughter says to me, “Mom, why did they kill Mischa’s character?” I don’t know. I really don’t. From the show’s perspective, messing with that foursome, it never recovered.\n\nExcerpted from the book WELCOME TO THE O.C.: The Oral History.
