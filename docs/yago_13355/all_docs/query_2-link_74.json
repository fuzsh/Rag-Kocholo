        "text": "As a wedding photographer, it's such a joy to be surrounded by love, marriage, and life almost every weekend. More than just your wedding day, I believe in the beautiful commitment of a marriage that is so, so worth celebrating. My prayer is that these images would remind you of your covenant promises to each other throughout seasons of marriage that are joyful, messy, and everywhere in-between. One day, I believe you'll look back on these photos 60+ years into marriage and see God's faithfulness in every part of your story - right from the beginning. Images like these honor the past, celebrate the present, and give hope for the future.\n\nFor the joy of weddings, the lifelong adventure of marriage, and the kind of love that grows deeper every day. Genuine laughs, tender kisses, and the way her eyes light up seeing him at the altar. These are the authentic and honest moments that define the beauty of your love story.\n\nEngagement sessions are the perfect opportunity to get comfortable in front of the camera prior to the wedding day. Sessions are included in several of my wedding collections, and also offered as an a la carte option as well.\n\nEach of my wedding day collections are crafted to meet the unique, individual needs of each bride and groom. For more specifics on what is included in each collection, please take a moment to fill out my inquiry form and I'll be more than happy to send you my investment guide with additional details.\n\nI believe your pictures aren't just meant to live on a screen, but rather to serve as tangible art pieces in your home. I love to offer my couples fine art albums and parent albums to commemorate your special day and bring your images and memories to life.\n\n\"There will never be enough stars for all that Marisa deserves. She is without a doubt the most talented photographer with the best professional touch, all wrapped up in a natural humble persona. We loved her light and natural style that brought out the best in me and my husband as camera shy as we are on our wedding day and for our engagement photos. Thank you Marisa!\n\n\"If I could give more than 5 stars for this review, I would! We hired Marisa Kinney for our wedding and I cannot say enough good things about her. Outside of just her skills as a photographer, Marisa is genuinely one of the kindest human beings ever and we feel so fortunate that we were able to snag her as our wedding photographer!\"\n\n\"When my fianc√© and I started planning our wedding this summer, one of the very first things we did was reach out to Marisa to see if she was available on our date. We have had SO many friends recommend her over the years, so we knew she was the first vendor we needed to lock down! Our friends and family have told us that the moments Marisa captured for us are a genuine reflection of who we are!\"\n\nYay! I'm so excited to hear more about your love story. Please take a moment to fill out my inquiry form, and I'll be in-touch to ensure we're the perfect fit. To officially reserve your date, I require a completed contract and retainer, as wedding dates are available on a first come first serve basis.\n\nOnce we've made it official, it's time to start dreaming about your engagement session. I am happy to offer assistance and planning on locations, details, outfits, etc. as well! As your wedding date approaches, I'll create a personalized timeline prior to the event and we'll meet over coffee or dinner to say hello again before the big day!"
