The two were co-stars in the 1992 TV movie Desperate Choices: To Save My Child.\n\n\"She was my first actress girlfriend,\" said Sisto, 41. \"We had a long distance relationship for a long time. I was so into her. Then she went to Africa to do a movie and I guess I thought she had broken up with me because she didn't call that much, so I moved on and met my ex-wife Marisa. When she returned, I found out that wasn't her intention but i had already gotten involved. Felt badly. She's a great person.\"\n\nWitherspoon, 39, declined to comment."
