        "text": "Ryan’s hope: A divorce from ‘Six Feet’ Sisto\n\n“Six Feet Under” star Jeremy Sisto plays a wacko of sorts on the HBO series – and his private life is, well, just as colorful.\n\n“Celebrity Justice” has unearthed legal papers showing that Sisto, who plays bipolar Billy on “Six Feet Under,” married Marisa Ryan, now on HBO’s “Mind of the Married Man,” back in 1993 when they were just 18. The couple embarked on a whirlwind Las Vegas wedding – and were (not surprisingly) separated after just two days. Stranger still, Sisto and Ryan remained good friends and even collaborated on a few projects – but never bothered getting a divorce. Until now.\n\nSources tell the show that the separation was due to a “wild impulse,” not by any blowup between the two – and that they’re going through with the official divorce proceedings only now because they never “got around” to it before.\n\nThe story airs on today’s “Celebrity Justice” (4 a.m./Ch. 4).\n\nEdward seeing stars on ‘Crossing Over’\n\n“Crossing Over with John Edward” (4 p.m./Ch. 5) begins a run of celebrity readings this week.\n\nOn tomorrow’s show, actor James Avery (“The Fresh Prince of Bel Air”) is accompanied by his mother, Barbara, as John Edward does a reading in Avery’s L.A. home. Edward helps Avery and his mom connect with loved ones – and, as a bonus, also brings Avery’s publicist, Cynthia, into the reading when he connects with her grandfather.\n\nOn Thursday’s show, there’s a private reading with Backstreet Boy Brian Littrell and his pregant wife, Leighanne, in the Malibu home of Littrell’s bandmate, A.J. McLean.\n\nLittrell says he was blown away when Edward connects him with a childhood friend who died of cancer in 1980 – while Leighanne is able to connect with her stepbrother and childhood friends who passed away early in life.\n\nCorman in the zone with new series\n\nB-movie legend Roger Corman is in the midst of preparing a new TV show, “Roger Corman Presents,” which will be along the lines of “Alfred Hitchcock Presents” and “The Twilight Zone,” when hosts Alfred Hitchcock and Rod Serling appeared on camera to introduce segments of their shows.\n\nCorman is prepping for his show by making a cameo role in protege Joe Dante’s Warner Bros. flick, “Loony Toons,” in which Corman plays (what else?) a director.\n\nSo what’s with the ’90s obsession?\n\nThe Goo Goo Dolls appear on today’s “Wayne Brady Show” (10 a.m./Ch. 7) to perform “Big Machine” from “Gutterflower.”\n\nBut there’s more. After the performance, lead singer John Rzeznik, when asked by Wayne Brady where he’d like to be 15 years from now, says, that his biggest fear is being part of a “Best Hits of the ’90s” album. Rzeznik then proceeds to improvise a song, using his acoustic guitar, that he’s pretending to sing to his kids about how big his band was in the ’90s.\n\nThis just in . . .\n\nChyler Leigh, who plays Sarah in David E. Kelley’s new series, “Girls Club,” appears on tonight’s “Weddings of a Lifetime” (7 p.m./Lifetime).\n\nJohn Roberts and Gretchen Carlson guest-host “The Early Show” today; then Russ Mitchell and Carlson through Friday. And Ch. 2 has hired Phil O’Brien as assistant news director.\n\nMaury Povich, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Keith Hernandez on today’s “WB11 Morning News,” which expands to 9 a.m. starting this morning.\n\nToday, tomorrow on “Ricki Lake” (5 p.m./Ch. 9): Five women living together in a beach house, trying to find Mr. Right."
