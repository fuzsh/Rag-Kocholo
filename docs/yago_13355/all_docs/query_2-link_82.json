        "text": "The one where fans had no idea their favorite Friends couple actually had feelings for each other.\n\nDuring the iconic NBC series' HBO Max reunion special, Aniston and Schwimmer admitted they nursed crushes on each other during the first season.\n\nAs Schwimmer explained, \"Yeah, the first season we—I had a major crush on Jen.\" Aniston countered, \"It was reciprocated.\"\n\nSo why didn't Ross and Rachel's real-life counterparts ever officially get together?\n\n\"At some point, we were both crushing hard on each other,\" Schwimmer explained, \"but it was like two ships passing because one of us was always in a relationship, and we never crossed that boundary. We respected that. But we both—\"\n\nMatt LeBlanc then interrupted, saying, \"Bulls--t. I'm kidding,\" going on to suggest that the co-stars maybe did show a little PDA on set.\n\n\"Honestly, I remember saying one time to David, 'It's going to be such a bummer if the first time you and I actually kiss is going to be on national television,'\" Aniston confessed. \"And sure enough, the first time we kissed was in that coffee shop.\"\n\nBut the co-stars did take advantage of their time on-set together, with Schwimmer saying, \"I thought back on the very first year or two, you know, when we had breaks from rehearsal, like, there were moments where we would cuddle on the couch.\" Aniston added, \"Or we would spoon and fall asleep on the couch.\"\n\nFinally, Schwimmer admitted, \"I'm thinking, how did not everyone know we were crushing on each other?\"\n\nThe Big Bang Theory stars dropped a big bomb in 2010 when it was reported they had dated for two years, with Cuoco revealing details about their romance only after they split.\n\n\"It was such a huge part of my life and no one knew about it,\" Cuoco said of her relationship with Galecki in an interview with CBS Watch! magazine. \"It was a wonderful relationship, but we never spoke a word about it and never went anywhere together.\"\n\nThough their offscreen flame flickered out, their characters, Penny and Leonard, continued to date throughout the remainder of the CBS hit sitcom's run. But playing boyfriend/girlfriend was never an issue for the former couple.\n\n\"When you're dealing with two professionals who have been working since they were both four—and who kept their lives extremely private—we didn't want anything other than that,\" she explained, going on to reveal their desire for privacy may have inadvertently caused their breakup.\n\n\"We were so protective of ourselves and the show and didn't want anything to ruin that. But that also made it sad, too,\" Cuoco shared. \"That's not the kind of relationship I want—I don't want to be hiding.\"\n\nIf you thought the Saved By the Bell characters were romantically cliquish on-screen, it was nothing compared to all of the relationship drama going on behind-the-scenes.\n\n\"All of us dated at one point or another—it was incestuous!\" Gosselaar told People in 2009. \"Sometimes the girls would gang up on the guys. Tiffani and Elizabeth would hate me, and then they'd hate Lark because Lark was talking to me, and Mario was supposed to side with someone. All that stuff you did in high school, like, 'How could you talk to him?'\"\n\nBut SBTB's IRL couple that dated for the longest was Gosselaar and Voorhies, who were together for three years during the show's later run.\n\nJust how serious was the Beverly Hills, 90210 co-stars' off-set romance? Well, it depends on who you ask.\n\n\"Brian Austin Green, I mean David and Donna, we were on camera together and we are off camera, something,\" Spelling explained on the Woman on Top podcast in 2020. \"[Brian] and I have different perspectives of what that was. There's the young girl version and the young boy version, so two different versions.\"\n\nShe continued, \"It's so funny, because to me, I was like, 'Remember that summer we were together? You said 'I love you' and I said 'I love you.' And he remembers none of that. He was like, 'No, we hooked up. We were friends.' And I was like, 'Cool, OK.' Even now I'm like, 'OK, cool.'\"\n\nDuring a test on 2015's Celebrity Lie Detector, Spelling admitted she was \"always in love\" with Green, while also revealing she once kissed Luke Perry and had a summer fling with Jason Priestley. (Priestley's response? \"I'm not getting into this... It's nobody's business... Either way...,\" he tweeted at the time.)"
