        "text": "David Lynch is hoping to his fairytale animated film project Snootworld off the ground even though Netflix recently “rejected” his pitch.\n\nLynch is thinking about directing the movie, which he co-wrote with Tim Burton collaborator Caroline Thompson, who previously worked on projects including The Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, and The Addams Family.\n\nIn a recent interview with Deadline, Lynch said: “I don’t know when I started thinking about Snoots but I’d do these drawings of Snoots and then a story started to emerge.”\n\nHe added: “I got together with Caroline and we worked on a script. Just recently I thought someone might be interested in getting behind this so I presented it to Netflix in the last few months but they rejected it.”\n\nWhen talking about the film, Lynch said: “Snootworld is kind of an old-fashioned story and animation today is more about surface jokes. Old-fashioned fairytales are considered groaners: apparently, people don’t want to see them. It’s a different world now and it’s easier to say no than to say yes.”\n\nThis sounds like it would make an interesting film and it’s really unlike anything that we’ve seen Lynch do before. Thompson described the storyline as “wackadoo”.\n\nShe continued to share insight on the story saying: “It takes my breath away how wacky it is. The Snoots are these tiny creatures who have a ritual transition at aged eight at which time they get tinier and they’re sent away for a year so they are protected.”\n\nIt’s explained that: “The world goes into chaos when the Snoot hero of the story disappears into the carpet and his family can’t find him and he enters a crazy, magnificent world”.\n\nWell, that sounds fun! It’s also a movie that the whole family can enjoy. Lynch said: “I like this story. It’s something that children and adults can both appreciate…I’ve never really done a straight animation but with computers today it’s possible to do some spectacular things.”\n\nLynch is currently looking for someone to finance the film, and I hope it happens. If Lynch doesn’t end up directing it, he hoped that his daughter Jennifer could take it on. She is a regular director on American Horror Story, but has “so many things in the pipeline that she ultimately thought it would be better for me or someone else to direct it”.\n\nAs for what Lynch will do next, he played coy about what project that may be, saying: “I can’t talk about those things right now.”"
