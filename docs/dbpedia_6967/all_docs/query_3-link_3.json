Knew she wanted to write the novel but anxiety kept slowing her down.\n\n6 .\n\nTook 18 months to write the first draft, finished at age 25, threw it away because it was so bad.\n\n7 .\n\nRewrote it in three months; had a friend pretend to be a literary agent, sold it to an editor she admired.\n\n8 .\n\nAfter that one big triumph, it was hard to move on, but she'd accomplished her goal and knew she do whatever she wanted from there."
