        "text": "Thompson told Insider that years after they worked together on \"Edward Scissorhands,\" she and Depp happened to be doing sound work on different movies at the same sound studio in Hollywood.\n\n\"He would greet me at the door every morning with a margarita. What could be better than that?\" Thompson said.\n\nThe screenwriter, who also wrote \"Corpse Bride\" and directed \"Black Beauty,\" said she would \"love to go and hang out\" with Depp again.\n\n\"But I don't drink anymore, so I don't know if that's feasible,\" Thompson said. \"Alcohol is really fun until it isn't anymore. We all had fun once, and we all functioned under the fun once. It's always fun until someone loses an eye or something.\"\n\nThompson told Insider that she hoped Depp's career could recover from the libel trial Depp recently lost and that the allegations against the actor made her \"really sad.\" Thompson said she suspected Depp had \"gotten really lost at times in his life.\"\n\nIn 2018, an editor for the British newspaper The Sun wrote that Depp was a \"wife beater\" in relation to Depp's marriage to Amber Heard, who alleged that he physically abused her. Depp denied all the allegations against him, and he sued The Sun over its use of the phrase. But earlier this month, a judge ruled that there was enough evidence for The Sun to use it.\n\nAfter the trial, Depp said he had been asked to resign from his role in the \"Harry Potter\" spinoff movie \"Fantastic Beasts 3\" (though he reportedly will still receive his eight-figure salary). Mads Mikkelsen will replace Depp.\n\nSome people have said that following the trial, Depp's career in Hollywood could be effectively over.\n\nRelated stories\n\nBut Thompson said she preferred to think of Depp the way she remembers him.\n\n\"I don't want to think badly of Johnny. I only want to think well of Johnny, and I know he's a sweet man,\" Thompson told Insider.\n\nShe recounted the last time she saw him, in 2011.\n\n\"I was fortunate enough to be given an award at the Austin Film Festival,\" alongside John Lasseter and another TV writer, Thompson said. \"Johnny came and gave me my award, which was really remarkable of him, very sweet of him. He was always really warm and welcoming.\""
