It stars Johnny Depp as Edward.\"— Presentation transcript:\n\n1\n\n2 Edward Scissorhands is a 1990 film directed by Tim Burton and co-written by Burton and screenwriter Caroline Thompson. It stars Johnny Depp as Edward Scissorhands,Winona Ryder as Kim Boggs, and Dianne Wiest as Peg Boggs. Vincent Price also has a role in the film; his last performance before his death. The film centers Peg Boggs who meets a young, shy, quirky and bizarre looking man named Edward - with hands made of scissors - and adopts him into her own 'typical American' family. The movie is a fable set in an exaggeratedly stereotypical vision of American suburbia that intentionally combines clichés from both the 1950s and the late 1980s. It also has a central theme of the isolated, misunderstood major character, a theme that recurs in much of Burton's work. Further, many of the motifs and themes of the 1931 film Frankenstein are referenced in Edward Scissorhands.\n\n3 Edward Scissorhands Edward is an artificial man whose inventor died before being able to put hands on his creation. Instead Edward has many long metal scissor-blades for hands. Incomplete and all alone is the line used to describe Edward at the beginning of the movie, but he finds true love and is genuinely happy even if for only a short time. Sadly, he and his love are separated and he lives the rest of his life alone. MAIN CHARACTER\n\n4\n\n5 Edward was created by an old man that lived only with his machines,eventually he felt lonely and and made a machine that could feel. Edward’s creator died and left him alone and unfinished.\n\n6 After Edward was left alone in the castle he was found by an Avon lady that bought him to a quiet neighborhood.\n\n7 Edward’s new home was very different from the castle and he had problems adapting when he was exposed to society.\n\n8 He falls in love with Kim, who is frightened by Edward at first, but grows to love him Kim- ”Hold me” Edward- ”I Can’t”\n\n9 Everybody else in the neighborhood grows to distrust him because of his dangerous condition, especially her jealous boyfriend Jim, with whom she breaks up after he abandons Edward when they are almost caught stealing from Jim's own father.\n\n10\n\n11 Jim(Kim's boyfriend) tries to shoot and kill Edward, but Kim grabs the gun still in Jim's hands and it is fired into the air, bringing part of the roof down on Edward. Jim then begins to beat Edward in the back with a long metal rod and Kim once again comes to Edward's aid. Jim hits Kim and kicks her off, sending her flying. This enrages Edward, who stabs Jim in the stomach, pushing him toward a window. He then pulls his hands from Jim, sending Jim falling to his death. Kim manages to keep the townspeople out of the castle by telling them the roof fell in the attic and killed Edward. To prove this she holds up another scissor-hand she took from the laboratory.\n\n12 Even though Kim and Edward go their separate ways, a love remains between them.\n\n13\n\n14"
