        "text": "Family law to Caroline J. Thompson has always been an excellent hybrid of two of her passions: the law and psychology.\n\n“In family law, you get to develop a relationship with the clients that you do not have in many if any, other areas of the law,” Ms. Thompson said. “It is very gratifying to assist people, and fight for them, during a very difficult time in their lives.”\n\nShe said so much of family law is helping people sift through the emotional aspects of a divorce to get them to a resolution that they can live with and move forward with their lives. Ms. Thompson thinks it is extremely important for a client to know the pros and cons of each action and the possible outcomes.\n\n“I do not shy away from having the honest, and sometimes difficult, conversation about what to expect with clients,” she said.\n\nTHIS IS AN ATTORNEY ADVERTISEMENT.
