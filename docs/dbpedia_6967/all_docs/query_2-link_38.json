        "text": "Tim Burton: The Master of Odd\n\nTim Burtonis one of the most talented film directors, film producers, artists and writers who live on this planet. He can be considered as a perfect example of a combination of innovativeness and talent. Tim Burton has been blessed by nature for his excellent imaginativeness. He also possesses excellent drawing skills. The painting was the hobby of Tim Burton during his childhood. When he grew old, he converted his hobby into his career.\n\nAs soon as Tim Burton completed his graduation, he started working in the Walt Disney Studiosas an apprentice animator. The experience he got while working created a tremendous impact on his future as well. In fact, this experience helped him to make his mark as a poet, writer, producer, director, and a stop motion artist. He has also contributed a lot to the success of the American film industry.\n\nTim Burton has contributed towards the American film industry for four decades. He was the person to come up with fantasy, quirky horror, and macabre, gothic and dark movies. That’s why he is known as one of the most innovative film producers in the history of the United States. His influences can even be seen in movies that are produced by other directors.\n\nAccording to the statistics of Tim Burton, he has produced 12 films and directed 16 films. Few of these movies have achieved super success. Batman, Batman Returns, Pee-wee’s Big Adventure, Planet of the Apes, Alice in Wonderland andCharlie and the Chocolate Factoryare few examples to prove the above-mentioned fact.\n\nAt the Beginning of the Rabbit Hole\n\nTim Burton was born in Burbank city to Bill Burton and Jean Burton. His father was working for the Recreation Department of the Burbank Park and was a former baseball player. The mother of Tim Burton was the owner of a cat-themed gift shop in the area. Therefore, he did not get the opportunity to have the most luxurious childhood.\n\n“I started to do stop-motion when I was a kid. You take a Super 8 and make some models, and move, click, move, click. All that. I love all forms of animation, but there is something unique and special to stop-motion: it’s more real and the set is lit like a set. But I think it’s also a kind of lonely and dark thing to want to do.”\n\nTim Burton attended Burbank High School for his primary education. He was just an average student at school. He paid more attention towards drawing and painting instead of focusing on his studies. He also enjoyed watching movies throughout his childhood.\n\nWhen Tim Burton turned 12, he made his first step in filmmaking. In fact, he started shooting short movies with the help of crude stop motion techniques. He was able to make his first ever movie when he was 13. This movie was named as The Island of Doctor Agnor.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Tim Burton enrolled in a course in character animation at the California Institute of Arts. He didn’t give up his passion for making movies even he was studying at the university. In fact, he made movies like “King and Octopus” and “Stalk of the Celery Monster” while he was studying at the university. He obtained his graduation in 1979 and started working in the Walt Disney Studios.\n\nFinding Love on Set\n\nTim Burton got married to a German-born artist named Lena Gieseke. However, the marriage in between them ended after 4 years. After that, Tim Burton decided to live with an actress and model named Lisa Marie. Later he developed a relationship with an actress named Helena Carter. Tim met Helena when he was working on the movie Planet of the Apes. Tim Burton and Bonham Carter have 2 children, a daughter named Nell and a son named Billy.\n\n“Things that I grew up with stay with me. You start a certain way, and then you spend your whole life trying to find a certain simplicity that you had. It’s less about staying in childhood than keeping a certain spirit of seeing things in a different way.”\n\nHow Tim Changed the Film Biz\n\nTim Burton has contributed a lot to the American film industry. Even though he had a very short stay at the Walt Disney Studios, he was able to learn a lot, which created an impact on his entire career.\n\nDuring this short stay, he created a short film named Vincent. It was even showcased at the Chicago Film Festival. It became a successful one and he was able to win many awards for it. Before leaving Disney, Tim Burton created his first ever live action movie as well. It was titled as Hansel and Gretel.\n\nThe success that Tim Burton experienced from his first two short movies motivated him to give life to many other productions. This made him create the movie titled Pee Wee’s Big Adventure, which became popular in every corner of the world.\n\nThe success of this movie opened many new doors for him. In fact, it created an ideal platform for him to make movies such as Batmanand Beetlejuice. These two movies helped Tim Burton to establish his reputation as a successful director. The movie Batman even became a box office hit at that time. The success of Batman made him come up with Batman Returns after a couple of years. It also became a box office hit within a short period of time.\n\n“I have a problem when people say something’s real or not real, or normal or abnormal. The meaning of those words for me is very personal and subjective. I’ve always been confused and never had a clearcut understanding of the meaning of those kinds of words.”\n\nThe year 1993 was a special one for Tim Burton. That’s because he produced the movie The Nightmare before Christmas, which was an animated musical. This was a new concept to the world at that time and it helped him to impress people in all parts of the world. As a result, he got the opportunity to gain a massive critical and commercial success.\n\nIn the following year, he produced two more movies named as Ed Woodand Cabin Boy. However, these two movies didn’t get popular as the previous ones. In the meantime, he was making plans to produce the next Batman movie, which was titled as Batman Forever.\n\nLike the previous Batman movies, it became a box office hit and was able to earn more than $336 million. He came up with few more films such as The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, Superman Lives andMars Attacks during the 1990s.\n\nTim Burton gave life to Planet of the Apesin the new millennium.

Due to the tight budget, Tim Burton was clashing constantly with the other producers of the movie. However, he wanted to make this movie a box office hit and his commitment created a positive impact on the success of the movie.\n\nThis is the main reason why he took the initiative to create the other movies in the Batman series. All the other movies were low budget ones as well. He had a clear understanding on how to manage the available resources and get the best out of them.\n\nAwards for the Unique Artist\n\nTim Burton has received many awards and achievements in his life.
