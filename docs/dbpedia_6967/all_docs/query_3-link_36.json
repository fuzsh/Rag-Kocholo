        "text": "The author and screenwriter weighed in on Depp's recent libel case loss against the publishers of The Sun newspaper in the UK, which she called \"he-said-she-said\" \"bulls---.\"\n\nDepp decided to sue The Sun and its executive editor Dan Wooten for calling him a \"wife beater\" in an article referencing his former marriage with Amber Heard. Thompson told Insider she was sad to hear about these allegations.\n\n\"I don't want to think badly of Johnny. I only want to think well of Johnny, and I know he's a sweet man. I suspect he's gotten really lost at times in his life,\" Thompson said.\n\nThe screenwriter, who also wrote \"The Addams Family,\" said that she didn't follow the libel trial that Depp lost after Judge Andrew Nicol said The Sun's lawyers had proved what the newspaper reported was \"substantially true.\"\n\n\"I had a sense of what's going on. It was he-said-she-said, it's bulls---,\" Thompson said.\n\nFollowing the judge's ruling, Warner Bros. asked Depp to resign from his role as Gellert Grindelwald in the Harry Potter spin-off \"Fantastic Beasts,\" which the actor agreed to. Mads Mikkelsen has since been cast as his replacement.\n\nWhile Thompson thought Depp's removal of \"Fantastic Beasts\" was \"so cruel,\" she does understand why the decision was made.\n\n\"There are fallouts from our hyper-sensitive times. Things go to extremes, and they have to. It's all apart of the zeitgeist we are experiencing right now,\" Thompson said. \"I hope he's okay.\"\n\nThompson told Insider that she is still friends with \"Edward Scissorhands\" costume designer Colleen Atwood, who has worked with Depp frequently throughout her career and is the costume designer for the \"Fantastic Beasts\" franchise. Thompson said she spoke to Atwood about Depp recently.\n\n\"She's doing 'Fantastic Beasts' and she was doing a costume fitting with him when all this came down and I asked if he's okay, and she just said 'I hope so.'\"\n\nThompson's agent approached her to write a script for Depp\n\nThompson told Insider that she would \"never in a million years want the kind of celebrity that he has.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"The cruellest thing we could do to a human is to put them on display like that. That he's still alive is probably a miracle,\" she added.\n\nThompson hopes Depp's career can recover from this scandal, and said that while she doesn't write all that much for the film business, her agent asked her if she would write a script for Depp.\n\n\"If [an idea] occurred, of course, I think he's marvellous,\" Thompson said.\n\n\"I hope he not only lives, but flourishes and gets through this, that's really how I feel about it.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nA complete timeline of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's tumultuous relationship\n\nJohnny Depp has been officially replaced by Mads Mikkelsen in 'Fantastic Beasts 3'"
