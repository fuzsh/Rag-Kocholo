        "text": "You may have heard about the smash new British comedy movie Swede Caroline set to take the film world by storm. What you may not have heard is the film, widely thought to be the new This Is England, was co-produced by identical twin brothers from Glastonbury Jack and Boris Thompson-Roylance.\n\nThe film has a stellar cast of famous names in comedy, film and drama including Jo Hartley (After Life, This Is England, Eddie the Eagle), Irish comedian, actor and writer Aisling Bea (This Way Up, Love Wedding Repeat), Fay Ripley (Cold Feet) and Ray Fearon (Coronation Street, Beauty and the Beast). Swede Caroline is set in Shepton Mallet and it hilariously tells the story behind the growing of large vegetables for prizes and the war games behind the scenes in allotments.\n\nThere has been a lot of publicity about the film including an interview with main actor Jo Hartley on Radio 4 last week. We caught up with the Thompson-Roylance twins in advance of the film’s premiere in London on Tuesday.\n\nREAD MORE: Young girls set up business and now mum and dad have quit their jobs to help it grow\n\nREAD MORE: Work restarts on bypass for village plagued with uniquely terrible traffic for centuries\n\nThrough their company Deadbeat Studios in London they are forging a huge career in the film industry both at home and abroad – they are already working on a commission from the BBC to make a film about refugees. Although the 32-year-old brothers’ career looks set to soar, they are firmly rooted and proud of their upbringing in Somerset.\n\nJack said: “We grew up in Glastonbury and went to school there, we have really fond memories of our childhood and love coming home. Swede Caroline is set in Shepton Mallet as it is such a quintessential rural town.\n\n“It is a wonderful place, the film is a celebration of the English countryside, we think people love that, a look back at a time gone by. And it is so eccentric and funny to delve into the world of vegetable growers, we had so much fun making the film, I never laughed as much in my life.”\n\nBoris said: “I think there is a real need for people to celebrate these wonderful aspects of our culture, the weird and wonderful world of the English countryside and the hilarious things that go on. It reminds people of what we are, of course there is a comedy side to it as well but it is also paying homage to our great traditions.”\n\nJack and Boris have always been passionate about film making and as schoolboys in Glastonbury used to film around the town and make YouTube videos, it is all they ever wanted to do.\n\nSwede Caroline is an independent mockumentary filmed on a shoestring budget. It tells the story of Caroline (Jo Hartley) who has her prized marrow plants stolen.\n\nWhat follows is a tumultuous tale involving private detectives (Aisling Bea and Ray Fearon), kidnappings, big turnips and a corruption scandal that takes Caroline and her partners Willy and Paul (Celyn Jones and Richard Lumsden) all the way to the top.\n\nDescribed by Shane Meadows, director of the film This Is England, as ‘a truly one of a kind whodunnit’, the film directed by Finn Bruce and Brook Driver pokes fun at the quintessentially English, eccentric world of competitive vegetable growers.\n\nIt looks like a great laugh and there is great excitement about the film. Jack Thompson-Roylanc said: “It is so great to be part of the independent film industry, everyone put their heart into Swede Caroline and all the actors and crew are passionate about it.”"
