        "text": "Worldbuilding is the art of creating a special place for a story to live — one where the audience will lose themselves and focus only on the narrative. Every story exists in an imaginative world, whether a family is sitting down having dinner or two hobbits are climbing a volcano to destroy a ring of power.\n\nWhile a story that takes place in a world like our own does still involve worldbuilding, it tends to be more subtle than, say, inventing Middle Earth and the languages that belong to it. For this article, I’m going to share some amazing examples of worldbuilding…from films that are not adaptations of prior existing IP (but, yeah, obviously J.R.R. Tolkien, J.K. Rowling, and George R.R. Martin, have created exciting worlds with immeasurable amounts of detail).\n\nA Quiet Place\n\nWritten by Bryan Woods, Scott Beck, John Krasinski\n\nA Quiet Place began with a great concept: monsters with extremely sensitive hearing attack Earth, forcing humans to adapt in silence if they want to survive.\n\nI love curiosity experiments like this. From walking barefoot — and on paths of sand — to muffling footsteps to creating noise diversions and even the Abbotts’ plan to keep their new infant safe, the post-monster invasion world was rife with details and imagination.\n\nEdge of Tomorrow\n\nWritten by Christopher McQuarrie, Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth\n\nKeeping with the monsters-attack-Emily-Blunt theme, Edge of Tomorrow is an excellent action story about Earth’s response to an alien invasion. It begins with the technology humans have devised to respond to the superior threat but then becomes an excellent Groundhog Day-esque story of someone with the ability to reset time and do the day over.\n\nFrom sharing details about the world enmeshed in war to the reveal of the alien’s time travel abilities, this is a clever and gripping example of how to put a unique spin on a familiar concept.\n\nRead More: Do’s and Don’ts of Worldbuilding for Writers\n\nInception\n\nWritten by Christopher Nolan\n\nChristopher Nolan is a genius when it comes to worldbuilding. We could have chosen any number of his films to feature here, from the blight-ravaged earth of Interstellar to his gritty interpretation of Batman, but we’ll focus on Inception because of its layers and layers of worldbuilding and, indeed, a character who designs the worlds within the plot of the film. The dream-sharing ability at the center of Inception is so fundamental to the story that to this day fans debate over what was real in the film and what was designed by architects.\n\nInception also does a great job of explaining how the laws of the world work and portraying them visually on-screen, from the physics to the subconscious mind, and even how to wake someone up. It anticipates questions and reminds audiences subtly of the mechanics of the world so we are guided through the story and the characters’ journeys without distraction. It’s an absolute masterclass in storytelling.\n\nThe Truman Show\n\nWritten by Andrew Niccol\n\nIn The Truman Show, Jim Carrey plays Truman, a man who grew up thinking he lived an ordinary life but actually lives on an enormous set of a reality show watched by millions around the globe. Screenwriter Andrew Niccol had to create the world of the reality show as well as the real-world tuning in, interweaving the two as Truman’s ignorance dissolves during his quest for the truth.\n\nLittle details like product placement or the behind-the-scenes footage of the cast and crew operating the show cleverly illustrate the complexity of this world.\n\nMoonrise Kingdom\n\nWritten by Wes Anderson, Roman Coppola\n\nWes Anderson’s visual signature is so popular that it has become a trend on social media — from his use of bright color palettes, his love of symmetry, and his character tableaus, his films are visual treats. But that isn’t where his worldbuilding ends. He is the master of eccentric characters, quirky dialogue, and utterly charming plots that manage to suspend disbelief and wholly enthrall audiences.\n\nIn Moonrise Kingdom, a young boy scout and his theatrical and dark pen pal make a pact to run away together, upending the idyllic norm of the island they call home. Anderson’s worldbuilding makes the stakes feel serious, endearing, and satisfying.\n\nTron: Legacy\n\nWritten by Edward Kitsis, Adam Horowitz\n\nTechnically, Tron: Legacy is a sequel to the 1982 science fiction film Tron, written by Steven Lisberger. The two serve excellently as examples of worldbuilding because of how time and technology allowed Tron: Legacy to build on its predecessor, making them excellent comparisons.\n\nIn Tron, Jeff Bridges is transported inside the cyberspace of a computer mainframe where human-like programs are forced to compete in deadly games. In Tron: Legacy, Garrett Hedlund plays Bridges’ son, who responds to a message from his long-lost father and is transported into a virtual reality run by a malevolent program trying to invade the real world.\n\nThe worldbuilding of both computer programs is fascinating itself — from the visual designs to the “games” the programs and users play, but what is even more intriguing is how the story and motivations of the antagonists evolve from the first film to the second.\n\nStar Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\n\nWritten by George Lucas\n\nI had to. You know I had to. George Lucas created arguably the most impactful science fiction universe when he created his quirky little space opera about a farmboy teaming up with a wizard and a smuggler to save a princess from an evil empire. What could have been hokey became one of the most beloved franchises of all time. What distinguishes Star Wars from other incredible stories set in the grand infinity of space (Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Stargate, Firefly, the list goes on) is the Force, an energy field created by all living things that surrounds us and penetrates us and binds the galaxy together.\n\nIn short, the Force is what gives Jedi Knights — and Sith Lords — their powers of telekinesis, mind control, precognition, and superior reflexes (to name a few). The religion of the Jedi Knights weaves Star Wars stories together; stories that inevitably champion the people fighting for freedom against corrupt governments or institutions.\n\nIn A New Hope alone, Lucas imagined a desert planet rotating around twin suns, a jungle-covered moon, and a space station large enough to destroy an entire planet. He dreamt up sentient droids, Wookies, and the myriad of species in the Mos Eisley Cantina. He introduced the Galactic Empire and the Rebellion resisting it. He developed X-Wings, TIE-fighters, Imperial Star Destroyers, and the Millennium Falcon. He gave us lightsabers.\n\nScience Fiction is, by its very nature, a genre that requires imaginative worldbuilding — but A New Hope is a prime example of how to weave lore with technology with compelling characters who are unforgettable.\n\nThe Sixth Sense\n\nWritten by M. Night Shyamalan\n\nNow iconic, The Sixth Sense is the story of a child psychologist whose patient claims he can “see dead people.” The psychological thriller follows Bruce Willis’ Malcolm Crowe as he begins working with nine-year-old Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who insists he can see and communicate with ghosts.\n\nShyamalan’s worldbuilding is at its finest in this film, from slowly introducing the presence of ghosts through the trauma and injuries of Cole to the revelation that the ghosts may have a reason for visiting the living. Shyamalan’s worldbuilding includes eerie hauntings and subtle use of color that is nearly imperceptible upon first-watch. Altogether he creates suspense and the urge to know what happens next.\n\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas\n\nWritten by Caroline Thompson, Tim Burton\n\nTim Burton’s animated dark fantasy musical tells the story of Jack Skellington, the King of Halloween Town, who stumbles upon Christmas Town and tries to bring the holiday to his home. The story is an open-door invitation for imagination and worldbuilding. Directed by Henry Selick, the film conjures up a world devoted to Halloween year-round that is spooky while still being palatable for kids.\n\nThe visuals of the stop-motion go a long way toward selling this idea, but the worldbuilding behind them is fine-tuned, from the creatures who live in Halloween Town to its hierarchy and structure to the wants and needs of its denizens.\n\nRead More: The Fundamentals of Worldbuilding in Screenwriting\n\n—\n\nThere is simply no limit to the worldbuilding that can be done — but when it is done well, the effects are magnetic and unforgettable. At the heart of every new world or town or galaxy is who lives in it and what they want. The worlds must serve the characters within them.\n\nThe reveals of the worlds must also serve the characters and the story you are telling. Revelations must be earned in order to deliver the most emotional impact for the characters — and the audience. It’s a delicate art, but rewatch films like these and you can see how the storytellers trickled breadcrumbs to lead viewers through the forests of their imagination.\n\nHappy writing!"
