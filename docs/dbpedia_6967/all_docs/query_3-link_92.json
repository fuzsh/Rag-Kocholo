The book's overall narrative and structure are different than I've pictured them and I liked the book Thompson wrote a lot more than the one I imagined. Now, having said that, I don't think I'll ever read it because so much of it is heartbreaking. As Joey becomes a character, I became sadder as I was fairly certain we weren't heading for happy ending (and we weren't). Overall, still happy to have checked this hard to find classic off my list.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers."
