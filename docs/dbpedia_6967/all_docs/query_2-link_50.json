        "text": "Cute depiction of something that's decidedly not. And seeing how this is based on a true story, I bet the real tale was far worse. But I'm not sure I wanna know.\n\nCuter contributions from the geniuses over at Jim Henson's studio though. In I'm guessing during the tail-end of its decline before the digital age really took over. Goes without saying that if this ever got remade the gorilla would be CGI now.\n\nPhillip Baker Hall's only in one scene (which I feel like I'm going to be saying a lot if I keep going through his IMDb.) But, at least it was with the ape.\n\nDeadass not even sure what this film even was. Was it horror? Was it porn? Idk but it was fucking weird and not in like a hey I just found some sick ass shit kinda way but more like an I just saw a feral dog and I'm not sure if it's cool or scary kinda way. Watched with a friend for an absolutley unforgettable experience.\n\n?/10 no gorilla penis\n\nWe live in a world where making a movie about a delusional insufferable woman who forces apes to dress and act like humans would be a good commentary? I still don’t know if it is trying to say something or not.\n\nAnyway, people who have exotic animals for sport probs shouldn’t have rights.\n\nMonkey Movember Movie 14/30\n\nMonkey Movember #10\n\nA sad, boring, but mostly strange movie. “Wild animals don’t belong with humans, they belong in the wild.” Okay great but you didn’t have to get all weird about it. Might’ve been better if the main woman wasn’t a dunce. But it did have Hagrid and Floop so that’s cool.\n\nMonkeyScore: 4/5 buddy made some crazy noises and I don’t know if gorillas sound like that.\n\nMagnificent effects courtesy of Jim Henson's Creature Shop and a warm Rene Russo performance are the only real reasons to watch this. Based on a true story in the very loosest of ways, it takes a very dark and depressing history, shaves off the edges and makes a slapstick family friendly comedy. It never quite works because we can't forget how wrong-headed the lead character is at every turn.\n\nBut the creature effects on Buddy the gorilla are nice, their practicality far more effective than CG even if it was many critics main complaint back in the 90s. And it's got that kind of weird 90s fantasy sheen to it, kinda like Toys, heightened and artificial. Helped enormously by Colleen Attwood's gorgeous costume design. All helpful distractions as we work past the film's immensely sad core. And that's not even mentioning the weird racist undercurrent."
