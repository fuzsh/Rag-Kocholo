She is most known for Edward Scissorhands, Corpse Bride, The Addams Family, The Nightmare Before Christmas, etc. In the interview, we chat about how she got into the entertainment industry, her best writing tips for screenwriters, how her career came to an end, and what she is up to now (spoiler alert: she is an oil painter, her paintings are beautiful and you can check a few of them out below). I had a great time chatting with and learning more about her and I hope you do too! You can check out the interview by clicking here! #SisterhoodCinema\n\nAre you new to Sisterhood Cinema?
