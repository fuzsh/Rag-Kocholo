        "text": "Thompson dates the letter only \"Monday.\" However, Dickens made two endorsements on the verso, the first of which relates to the date of writing: \"Mrs Thompson / Received Tuesday 9th January 1855.\" In the second endorsement, Dickens appears to be noting the time and day he has arranged to meet with her: \"Sunday / 1/2 past 3\" [this has been cancelled] and \"Saturday, Shepherds Bush / 1/2 past 11.\" See the published correspondence, cited below, for additional information.\n\nWritten from \"23 Bute Street / Old Brompton.\"\n\nThe letter is part of a collection, MA 1352, which consists of letters from Charles Dickens to the Baroness, to her companion Hannah (Meredith) Brown, or the latter's husband, William Brown; with 70 letters written by others to Miss Coutts or to Dickens in his capacity as her unofficial almoner; and a few others. See the collection-level record for more information.\n\nApologizing for the intrusion, but writing \"as you may imagine I am anxious to know if your endeavours for me have been attended with success;\" thanking him for \"the kind sympathy and interest you have shewn in my affairs\" and asking \"Will you tell me if there is a possibility of my being able to leave England soon, as indeed I am very anxious to do so.\""
