        "text": "YARDLEY BOROUGH >> In a rare spring reorganization meeting, Yardley Borough Council on Tuesday, April 19 reshuffled its leadership team.\n\nAt the start of the meeting, David Bria announced that he would be stepping down as council president. He had served as the head of council for a little more than two years and was re-elected in January to another term.\n\n“I am not leaving council. I am just stepping away from a leadership role,” he said. “And that’s because I think it is in the best interest both for me personally and for the borough. I’m finding the time commitment a little difficult to keep up with, balancing it will work life, personal life and all the other great things going on. I thank everyone for what has been a little more than two years. It’s been fun,” he said.\n\nUnder Bria’s watch, the borough council and administration maneuvered its way through COVID-19, adapting quickly to Zoom meetings and never missing a beat; loosened building restrictions in the borough’s floodplain; secured grant agreements totaling more than $2 million to elevate 10 homes in the floodplain; reached an agreement to purchase the PECO lot in Rivermawr; moved forward with a number of capital projects including the Mary Yardley footbridge and the North Main Street sidewalk project; created a voluntary auxiliary police force in the borough; and raised the Progress Pride flag for the first time over borough hall.\n\nAs Bria’s last order of business as council president he asked for nominees from the council for his replacement.\n\nIn a series of subsequent votes, Council unanimously selected Caroline Thompson as president; Kim Segal-Morris as vice president; and Matt Ross as president pro tempore.\n\n“I’m very excited for the opportunity” to lead the council, said Thompson, who accepted the gavel of leadership from Bria. She is in her fifth year on council and had served under Bria as vice president for just over two years.\n\nIn addition, she has served on numerous council committees including chair of general government, where she worked closely with the borough manager in developing the annual budget; community outreach; public works; and community and economic development.\n\n“I’d like to give David my heartfelt thanks for all the hours that aren’t seen by the community – nights, days, weekends, the shear number of emails that you have responded to – and all that you have done for this town. I feel like you really brought civility back to this board, you put us on the map and I’ve learned so much from you. I’m very grateful.\n\n“I’ve got big shoes to fill,” she said after the meeting. “The borough council is more invisible now than it was four years ago, which is a good thing. I’d like to continue that – no drama and lots of productivity.”\n\nThompson said one of her first orders of business will be to ask council to cancel the July 5th scheduled council meeting.\n\nCouncil also has two major public works projects coming up this spring and early summer – the second phase of the North Main Street Sidewalk project and the replacement of the Mary Yardley pedestrian bridge linking North Main Street to Rivermawr.\n\nIn other business, council announced that it will be accepting applicants for the position of borough tax collector through May 23. Resumes and applications from borough residents can be sent to borough manager Paula Johnson or dropped off at borough hall.\n\n“There is a procedure that we are going to go through in terms of making people understand what they would be getting into and what the commitment is and what the expectations would be before we start the interviews,” said Councilman Matt Curtin, who chairs the council’s general government committee.\n\nThe process will include a mandatory information session for applicants on May 16 to outline the duties of the tax collector and what can be expected.\n\n“There’s a lot to learn. It is a part-time position, but it is a lot of work,” said borough manager Paula Johnson.\n\nBorough council is scheduled to publicly interview candidates on June 7 and possibly make an appointment that night.\n\nJust two months into the job, newly-elected tax collector Melissa Wayne resigned from the post earlier this year. She gave no reason for her resignation.\n\nAfter accepting Wayne’s resignation, the council unanimously appointed former tax collector Cheryl Lowe-Cier to temporarily fill the vacancy until a replacement can be found.\n\nIn other action at the meeting, council approved the purchase of two handheld electronic police ticketing devices at a cost of $9,750. They will come with a one year subscription and a three year warranty.\n\nThe current devices, which were purchased in 2018, will be rendered obsolete at the end of this year when Verizon drops its 3G service.\n\n“We switched over to electronic ticketing in 2018. We purchased two mobile devices. All the tickets that we write at the time we write them are instantly transmitted to district court. It cuts down on the amount of time an officer is on the scene,” said Chief Joseph Kelly.\n\nReplacement of the devices were scheduled for 2023. The change in cellular service made it necessary to move the expenditure to this year, said Kelly.\n\nDuring public comment, council heard from Fred Rabeno from La La Lobster who asked if there’s anything the Borough can do about two newly installed signs erected by the owner of the Yardley Town Center.\n\nThe exit only signs, placed at either side of the exit to the shopping center at South Main Street, warn drivers not to enter the center through the exit.\n\nThe problem, said Rabena, is that one of the signs is posted at the front of his driveway and is confusing customers planning to pull into La La Lobster thinking their driveway is the exit only.\n\n“When they see this new exit only sign they think they can’t turn into our driveway or they pull back out. It’s creating an issue there,” said Rabena. “I understand it’s private property but it’s causing an issue in the street. I foresee an accident there.”\n\nManager Paula Johnson said she did contact the property owner and they said they are looking at it. “We don’t regulate directional signs inside private parking lots. I did check with the Chief on it as well. It’s not something we can make them take out. I understand the confusion.”"
