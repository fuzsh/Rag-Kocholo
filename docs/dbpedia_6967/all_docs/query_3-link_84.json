        "text": "Welcome to week two of our new blog series focused on structuring, writing and formatting feature screenplays. In this post, we’ll examine a fundamental element of any kind of writing:\n\nCharacter descriptions.\n\nIf the function of characters is to be our emotional tether to a story, it’s vital that a character elicit some kind of emotional response the instant we meet them on the page. With juicy characters, a script can attract talent. The character’s description is the first point of creative lift-off for any number of collaborators on a film. Most importantly, it’s one place to hook a reader early in the story.\n\nCharacter descriptions pose a unique challenge to screenwriters because the key to effective screenwriting is economy (or packing the biggest emotional punch in as little space and verbiage as possible).\n\nIn the library, we’ve noticed that even the most heralded, seasoned writers sometimes fall back on easy, cliched choices in their character description. For reference, see our post from a few years ago about the empty adjectives “beautiful, pretty, attractive, cute,” etc. when describing female characters.\n\nAll this to say, it’s a lot of pressure to grab a reader by the throat AND simultaneously avoid harmful descriptive pitfalls. Where does one even begin?\n\nHere we’ll share with you some of our favorite character descriptions and the techniques that make them so effective. We’ve tossed in a few extra spooky ones because ’tis the season!\n\nAs always, if you’re looking for help or reference assistance, our e-mail library@wgfoundation.org is always open. While we can’t send PDFs of scripts, we can always advise about formatting as we do here.\n\nLet’s dive right in.\n\nALMOST FAMOUS (2000)\n\nWritten by Cameron Crowe"
