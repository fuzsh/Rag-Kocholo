        "text": "Ten-year-old Mary Lennox (Kate Maberly), a sour and spoiled child raised in India by unaffectionate parents, is forced to move to England to live with her uncle, Sir Archibald Craven (John Lynch), when her parents are both killed in an earthquake. With only the hard-hearted housekeeper, Mrs Medlock (Maggie Smith), to look after her, Mary is confined to her room, one of 100 rooms at Misselthwaite Manor, and made to care for herself. While playing outside one day, Mary finds a key to a garden that Sir Archibald has ordered locked since the death of his wife 10 years ago. With the help of her maidservant Martha (Laura Crossley) and Martha's brother Dickon (Andrew Knott), Mary begins to care for the garden. One day, while exploring the manor against the orders of Mrs Medlock, Mary comes upon the source of a strange crying she has heard throughout the house her cousin Colin Craven (Heydon Prowse), a sickly child of her age who has been confined to his bed for years. With Mary's help and the \"magic\" of the garden, Misselthwaite Manor begins to change.\n\nImmediately upon his return to Misselthwaite Manor, Sir Archibald asks Mrs Medlock, \"Where is my son?\" Much to Mrs Medlock's surprise, Colin is not in his room nor is Mary in hers. When Father asks what is going on, Mrs Medlock tries to blame it on Mary and her wild ways, but Father reminds Medlock that Mary is just a child and that he left her (Medlock) in charge. Martha suggests that the children may be in the garden, so he goes there. The children are playing blind man's bluff, and Colin is \"it\". Dickon and Mary are hiding behind some tall flowers and see Father enter the garden. Colin eventually tags his father, thinking it is Dickon but, as his hands make their way up the sleeves and touch his hair and face, Colin realizes that it is his father. \"The magic worked!\", he exclaims, and they hug each other. Mary runs off crying because \"nobody wants me!\" Sir Archibald assures her that she has brought them back to life and that there is always a place for her at Misselthwaite. Colin, Mary, and Sir Archibald walk back to the house, astounding Martha and all the other servants to tears, even Mrs Medlock. In the final scene, a woman's hand stirs the water in a lilypond while, in a voiceover, Mary tells how Father learned to laugh and she learned to cry. \"The secret garden is always open now and awake and alive,\" she says, \"If you look at it the right, you can see that all the world is a garden.\" A woman with long, dark hair can then be seen walking out of the garden. As the credits roll, Dickon rides over the moor on his white horse."
