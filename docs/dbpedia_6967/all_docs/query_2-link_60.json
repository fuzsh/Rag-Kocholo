        "text": "This happens a lot. People like to be seen as a project's sole creative force, especially when working in media like film and television, where there are dozens of people collaborating. Maybe Miramax was trying to cultivate an auteur whose name would be easier to market alone than with an occasional co-writer or maybe Tarantino was already trying to build up his cult of personality. Whatever the reason, he got sole credit as Pulp Fiction's writer-director, the genius behind everything. When something pops off, everybody wants to be the reason why. Tim Burton's name is all over The Nightmare Before Christmas, but Henry Selick directed it, Caroline Thompson wrote its screenplay and Danny Elfman wrote all of its songs. Burton, who had the basic idea and sketched designs for the film's characters, is the one who talks at Disney's press conferences. It's easier to think about movies like novels than it is to acknowledge who actually did what. \"Written and Directed by Quentin Tarantino\" is a lot more impressive without the \"except for the third of the film co-written by Roger Avary\" asterisk. Tarantino Zuckerberg'd a few friends on the way to becoming so identifiable.\n\nFor years, Avary was publicly hurt by getting minimized in the creation of Pulp Fiction, openly discussing the slight in Peter Biskind's Sundance/Miramax book history Down and Dirty Pictures in 2004. Ten years later, Avary, presumably while holding a sign that said \"Please don't ask me about this or I'll break my NDA,\" told Vanity Fair he didn't remember that happening. Today, the two men host a podcast about movies they loved in their video store days. Before the falling out, Avary was poised to become as big as his friend. Who knows how much of this is real, but Killing Zoe supposedly only exists because Tarantino and his one-time producer Lawrence Bender found an excellent bank while scouting locations for Reservoir Dogs. After hearing about the location, Avary lied to Bender, saying he had written a bank heist script that would fit it perfectly. With Bender's interest piqued, Avary banged out Killing Zoe's first draft.\n\nIt's a ridiculous story, something that would only happen in a movie, but it really is a great bank. It's spacious without looking like an office building, generic enough that you could film in Los Angeles and pretend it was almost anywhere in the world. If a movie producer was ever to praise a bank to his friends, it would have to be like this one: decent-enough looking, with enough space that filming on location wouldn't be a pain.\n\nAvary and Tarantino's relationship makes Killing Zoe's debt to the latter hard to define. Avary had written all of the Steven Wright radio dialogue in Reservoir Dogs and had come up with significant parts of Pulp Fiction. You can't dismiss him as a Tarantino copycat if he was there from the start, working on the material other writers would rip off. More importantly, he co-wrote The Open Road with his friend before Tarantino reworked the script into True Romance. And that's what Killing Zoe takes from, more than anything.\n\nZoe had its festival premiere in October 1993, one month after True Romance was released, and Avary either recycled a ton of the Open Road material that made it into True Romance or he copied off his friend's test and took liberal inspiration from the version of True Romance that Tarantino gave to Tony Scott. He either wrote fan fiction or he deserves more credit for coming up with the early Tarantino style. Because both True Romance and Zoe are about guys who meet sex workers in scene two, have deep, soul-bonding sex with them and then wind up in over-the-top shootouts as the movies end, with the guy wounded and the woman calmly walking him out of the bloody chaos. Zoe's got the requisite framed movie posters on apartment walls and conversations about movies and music. It's True Romance with a tighter focus.\n\nThat focus ends up being Killing Zoe's biggest strength, if you can make it through the parts where the focus makes you want to turn the movie off. There are, essentially, five long scenes over its 96 minutes. Where Tarantino made nonlinear storytelling one of his early signatures (as with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, True Romance's script originally played with time), Avary's story might as well be in real-time. One thing leads to the next leads to the next:\n\n1. Eric Stoltz, looking exactly like Travolta in Pulp Fiction, with this hair, earrings and suit, gets off a plane from the United States to France and a cab driver offers him access to escorts. I had assumed the music during this ride between the airport and a Parisian hotel was a bizarre remix of Moby's \"Go\" with slap bass and off-key yodeling, but it's actually part of the original score by tomandandy. It's so fun to look at Stoltz and then Travolta and think about Avary and Tarantino, two dorks, having the same idea of what a cool guy looks like. \"Of course he would have greasy, shoulder-length hair,\" one would say, and the other would nod furiously.\n\n2. Julie Delpy, the Zoe from the movie's title, meets Eric Stoltz in his hotel, where they talk and have a long sex montage not unlike the one in The Room (they even hit at about the same point in each film's running time).\n\n3. Stoltz, who I have put off mentioning is named Zed, meets up with his French friend, Eric. They go back to Eric's apartment, meet a crew of thieves and briefly look at a bank's blueprints. Zed is a safecracker. Rather than plan the heist they're going to pull in that bank, they all smoke heroin. The subsequent 25 minutes of the film are shot partially out of focus.\n\n4. Zed and his new crew go to an underground Dixieland jazz club.\n\nThat's the first half of the film-- four scenes over forty-five minutes, and the cameraperson has their hand skittering around with the focus for twenty-five of those minutes. It's not dissimilar to what Gaspar Noé might do, though he'd probably be punishing the audience. I think Avary's just making a stylistic decision that happens to make everything harder to watch. I can get annoyed when movies try to prove obvious points and think they're blowing your mind with arguments you couldn't disagree with, and that's what seems to be happening here-- Roger Avary felt he had to impress \"heroin is bad and will make you feel bad\" on the viewer and he did it by making twenty-six percent of his first movie into a headache. It's bold, at least.\n\nAt the forty-six minute mark, the crew don sequined masks and enter the bank. The fifth and final scene opens with Zed waking up in the back of a getaway van, hungover and maybe a little high, seconds away from a heist.\n\nI love how many people there are here. Seven men jump out of the van and enter the bank, and it immediately feels like too many people. The job feels sloppy, the opposite of a story like The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, where a handful of people move in tight orchestration. It's not like each of these men has a specialty, either. This is a bunch of guys with guns showing up and hoping things work out. They run into the bank yelling like children playing a game. As they get deeper into the building, they whip chains around, fire guns behind their backs and play air guitar on shotguns. Within minutes, the job goes wrong and they're bickering and pushing each other around. Back at the friend's apartment, the movie made a quick joke about how little time had been put into preparation and then a scene-and-a-half later, that joke becomes the first fuck-up in a long series of them.\n\nThe only problem with introducing so many characters into such a tight story is the limited time Avary spends identifying them. Each man, outside Zed and Eric, is interchangeable, his mask more idiosyncratic than his personality. You could get rid of the blurry heroin footage and have time to give a few of them names, at least.\n\nAs the crew are still happily fooling around, the movie gives us a quick flash of Zoe's face. She works at the bank and she's trapped in it with everybody else.\n\nZed's job is to open the big vault. Everybody else smokes cigarettes and dicks around in the bank's lobby, telling sex stories that don't really go anywhere. Eric shoots heroin in a bathroom stall. There's some interesting color work in the film. Eric's apartment is painted a solid blue and the bank's vault is a solid red. The lobby has bits of red and gets more overwhelmed by the color the closer we get to the vault. As symbolism, it's obvious. As an element of design, it's striking, helping all of these flamboyant characters in gray and navy suits really pop.\n\nThe heist includes one of my favorite tropes: a hostage who happens to be carrying a gun tries to have a heroic moment and unloads on his captors (the off-duty cop in Point Break is probably my favorite version of this character). In most movies, this doesn't pan out for the hostage, but he makes things a little more complicated before he's blown away. Killing Zoe's version of the character manages to kill one of the robbers and maims another. The crew start ripping their masks off. And then a phone rings-- the line, which they thought had been cut, is still active. An alarm has gone off. Police surround the bank. The crew start killing hostages to let off some steam.\n\nAs the movie progresses, they start killing each other. It isn't clear why, but that chaos is part of the tone. You don't really need to know their reasons beyond frustration, fear and hopelessness. In that way, the second half of the film mirrors the first half, with clear focus getting interrupted by hallucinatory nonsense. Toward the end, the members of the crew aren't even framed in the same shots. One of them will fire and then we'll cut to a different one falling down dead. You could have shuffled the shots around and achieved the same effect. All you really know and need to know is that everybody dies in the confusion."
