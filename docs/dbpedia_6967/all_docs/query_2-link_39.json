The dance piece will hit movie theatres internationally beginning September 25.\n\nBased on the Tim Burton movie of the same name, and featuring the music of Danny Elfman and Terry Davies, the dance piece first premiered in 2005. The live filming will be the latest in a long line of releases from Bourne and his company New Adventures.\n\nThe story follows Edward, a boy created by an eccentric inventor. When his creator dies, he is left alone and unfinished with only scissors for hands until a woman invites him to live with her suburban family.\n\nThe filmed production stars Liam Mower as Edward Scissorhands, with Ashley Shaw as Kim, Kerry Biggin as Peg Boggs, Dominic North as Bill Boggs, Ben Brown as Jim Upton, Nicole Kabera as Joyce Monroe, and Luke Murphy as George Monroe.\n\nCompleting the cast are Andrew Ashton, Stephanie Billers, Reece Causton, Jade Copas, AnnaMaria de Freitas, Perriera de Jesus Franque, Savannah Ffrench, Glenn Graham, James Lovell, Aristide Lyons, Xholindi Muci, Stephen Murray, Edwin Ray, Holly Saw, Molly Shaw-Downie, Xavier Andriambolanoro Sotiya, Mami Tomotani, and Carrie Willis.\n\nProduced and released by Trafalgar Releasing, the production was filmed live at Wales Millenium Centre, Cardiff, in March 2024, and is directed for the screen by Ross MacGibbon. This is the 10th cinema release for New Adventures and follows The Sleeping Beauty, which was screened in U.K. cinemas for the first time in 2023."
