        "text": "Edward Scissorhands is a 1990 romantic fantasy film about the solitary life of an artificial man - who was incompletely constructed and has scissors for hands - that is upended when he is taken in by a suburban family.\n\nDirected by Tim Burton. Written by Caroline Thompson.\n\nHis scars run deep.taglines\n\nPeg Boggs\n\n[edit]\n\nThe light concealing cream goes on first. Then you blend, and blend, and blend. Blending is the secret.\n\nDarn this stuff!\n\nBill Boggs\n\n[edit]\n\n[to Peg] Sweetheart, you can't buy the necessities of life with cookies.\n\nJim\n\n[edit]\n\nForget about holding her hand, man. Think about the damage he could do to other places.\n\n[last words] Hey! I said, \"Stay away from her!\" [Enraged, Edward stabs him in the stomach and pushes him out of a window to his death]\n\nDialogue\n\n[edit]\n\nPeg: Why are you hiding back there? You don't have to hide from me - I'm Peg Boggs, your local Avon representative and I'm as harmless as cherry pie... [sees Edward come toward her] Oh - I can see that I've disturbed you. I'll just be going now...\n\nEdward: Don't go.\n\nPeg: [sees his scissor hands] Oh, my. What happened to you?\n\nEdward: I'm not finished.\n\nPeg: My, those are your hands? Those are your hands! What happened to you? Where are your parents? Um... Your mother? Your father?\n\nEdward: He didn't wake up.\n\nPeg: Are you alone? Do you live up here all by yourself? What happened to your face? No, I won't hurt you. But at the very least, let me give you a good astringent. And this will help to prevent infection. What's your name?\n\nEdward: Edward.\n\nPeg: Edward... I think you should just come home with me.\n\nEsmeralda: It's not heaven he's from! It's straight from the stinking flames of hell! The power of Satan is in him; I can feel it. Can't you? Have you poor sheep strayed so far from the path?\n\nEdward: We're not sheep.\n\nEsmeralda: Don't come near me!\n\nEsmeralda: He has been sent first to tempt you. But it's not too late. You must push him from you, expel him! Trample down the perversion of nature!\n\nJoyce: Did you hear that? [chuckles] He's a perversion of nature. Why, isn't that exciting?\n\nBill: So, Edward, did you have a productive day?\n\nEdward: Mrs. Monroe showed me where the salon's going to be. You could have a cosmetics counter.\n\nPeg: Wouldn't that be great?\n\nBill: Great.\n\nEdward: And then she showed me the back room where she took all of her clothes off.\n\n[everyone stares; Kevin snickers]\n\nBill: [without listening] Edward, I can't tell you how thrilled I am, I'm just as pleased as punch. This whole beauty parlor venture is gonna teach you volumes and nothing like running your own business. I've never done it myself, but from what I gather it's the greatest satisfaction a working man can have.\n\nKim: Hold me.\n\nEdward: [tries to hold her]...I can't.\n\nOfficer Allen: Will he be okay, doc?\n\nPsychologist: The years spent in isolation have not equipped him with the tools necessary to judge right from wrong. He's had no context. He's been completely without guidance. Furthermore, his work - the garden sculptures, hairstyles and so forth - indicate that he's a highly imaginative... uh... character. It seems clear that his awareness of what we call reality is radically underdeveloped.\n\nOfficer Allen: But will he be all right out there?\n\nPsychologist: Oh, yeah, he'll be fine.\n\nPeg: You know- damn those TV programs!\n\nBill: Damn them all to hell.\n\nJim: [after seeing Edward accidentally cut Kim] Hey! Now you've done it!\n\nKim: It was just a scratch Jim, really!\n\nPeg: What's going on?\n\nJim: Call a doctor, he skewered Kim!\n\nKim: He didn't skewer me!\n\nJim: [bullying and shoving Edward] You can't touch anything without destroying it! Who the hell do you think you are hanging around here, huh? Get the hell outta here! Go you freak!\n\n[Edward leaves]\n\nJim: He tried to hurt you.\n\nKim: No, he did not, and you know it!\n\nJim: Are you nuts?! I just saw him!\n\nKim: Jim, I don't love you anymore. I just want you to go, okay? Just go.\n\nJim: Are you serious? I'm gonna lose you to that? He isn't even human.\n\nKim: Just get out of here, okay?! Just go!\n\n[Jim walks away]\n\nKim: You're here... They didn't hurt you, did they?\n\n[Edward shakes his head]\n\nKim: Were you scared? I tried to make Jim go back, but, you can't make Jim do anything. Thank you for not telling them that we...\n\nEdward: You're welcome.\n\nKim: It must have been awful when they told you whose house it was.\n\nEdward: I knew it was Jim's house.\n\nKim: You... you did?\n\nEdward: Yes.\n\nKim: ...Well, then why'd you do it?\n\nEdward: Because you asked me to.\n\nKim: She never saw him again. Not after that night.\n\nGranddaughter: How do you know?\n\nKim: [removes her glasses] Because I was there.\n\nGranddaughter: You could have gone up there. You could still go.\n\nKim: No, sweetheart. I'm an old woman now. I would rather he remember me the way I was.\n\nGranddaughter: How do you know he's still alive?\n\nKim: I don't know, not for sure. But I believe he is. You see, before he came down here, it never snowed. And afterwards, it did. If he weren't up there now... I don't think it would be snowing. Sometimes, you can still catch me dancing in it.\n\nTaglines\n\n[edit]\n\nHis scars run deep.\n\nThe story of an uncommonly gentle man.\n\nInnocence is what he knows. Beauty is what she sees.\n\nEdward Was Here....\n\nHis story will touch you, even though he can't.\n\nThe Director Of \"Batman\" & \"Beetlejuice\" Invites You To Meet His Newest Creation:\n\nEdward lived alone where he could hurt no one and no one could hurt him.
