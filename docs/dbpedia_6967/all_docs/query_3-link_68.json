        "text": "Early life\n\nThompson was born in Washington, D.C., the daughter of Bettie Marshall (n√©e Warner), a teacher, and Thomas Carlton Thompson, Jr., a lawyer. She received her early education in Washington. Thereafter she went to Cambridge, Massachusetts to attend Radcliffe College, Harvard University, and eventually graduating from Amherst College in English and classic literature in 1978.\n\nCareer\n\nThompson moved to Los Angeles, supporting herself as a freelance book reviewer and writer. In 1983, she published a novel \"First Born\" which director Penelope Spheeris chose to make into a film, and from whom she started learning scriptwriting while writing the drafts of the film's screenplay. Though the movie was never made, the project gave her the impetus to find a new career as a screenwriter.\n\nHer other works include Snow White: The Fairest of Them All for Hallmark, starring Miranda Richardson and Kristin Kreuk, The Secret Garden, Buddy, Black Beauty, Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey, and The Addams Family.\n\nFrom the above, she directed Black Beauty (1994) as her directorial debut, followed by Snow White in 2001 for TV and Buddy. She was the producer for Snow White and the associate producer for The Secret Garden and Edward Scissorhands.\n\nHer recent screenplay for Wicked Lovely, intended to be directed by Mary Harron, was in turnaround in 2011.\n\nThompson was recently presented with the Distinguished Screenwriter Award at the 2011 Austin Film Festival.\n\nFilmography\n\nEdward Scissorhands (1990)\n\nThe Addams Family (1991)\n\nHomeward Bound: The Incredible Journey (1993)\n\nThe Secret Garden (1993)\n\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)\n\nBlack Beauty (1994)\n\nBuddy (1997)\n\nSnow White: The Fairest of Them All (TV, 2001)\n\nCorpse Bride (2005)\n\nCity of Ember (2008)"
