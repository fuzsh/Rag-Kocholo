        "text": "Johnny Depp has claimed he was only given his role in Edward Scissorhands after Tom Cruise messed up a meeting with director, Tim Burton.\n\nThe actor, 61, who played the title character in the 1990 film, has revealed how he wasn’t the first choice for the role.\n\nCruise “was not far away from actually playing Edward Scissorhands – true story”, he said in a new documentary about Tim Burton.\n\nIn the documentary, the scriptwriter for the cult film, Caroline Thompson, told how Cruise lost his chance at the role after meeting with Burton and asking him a question.\n\n“In his interview with Tim, he asked how Edward went to the bathroom,” she said. “If you start asking those questions, the whole thing falls apart. You can’t ask questions like that. If you ask questions like that, you’re f**ked. You’ve missed the metaphor, you’ve missed the point.”\n\nOn the other hand, when Depp saw the script, “it passed through everything, anything, solid and went to the very core of whatever I am”.\n\n“The writing was beautiful. The character was beautiful. What I suppose (attracted) me emotionally was that Edward was me. It’s exactly what I should be doing,” he recalled.\n\nHowever, he almost didn’t turn up to the initial meeting with Burton, as he’d heard Cruise, Tom Hanks and Michael Jackson were also being considered for the role. He remembered thinking the filmmaker would never cast him “when everyone in Hollywood is after the part” but his agent convinced him to go anyway.\n\nDepp ended up getting the part, and the movie made $86 million (£67.5 million) at the box office.\n\nThe Tim Burton docuseries, which is still untitled, premiered at the 2024 Tribeca Film Festival in New York City on Monday.\n\n– Cover Media"
