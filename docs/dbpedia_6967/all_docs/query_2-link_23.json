        "text": "The lineup of talent slated for the Agoura Hills screenwriter’s festival this weekend is expected to give attendees a glimpse into how movie magic is made.\n\nThe official name of the twoday event this Friday and Saturday is Cinco and Ken’s “The Greatest Movies Ever Written.”\n\nScreenwriters Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio, known for the animated movies “The Lorax,” “Horton Hears a Who” and “Despicable Me,” worked with the city to organize the festival.\n\nPaul lives in Agoura Hills, and Daurio resides in Westlake Village.\n\nThe festival will present a mix of movie genres: familyfriendly “Despicable Me”; cult favorites “Tremors” and “Edward Scissorhands”; and the comedydrama “Parenthood.”\n\nCaroline Thompson, screenwriter of “Edward Scissorhands,” spoke with The Acorn about her passion for offbeat movies.\n\nShe said she launched her career at the age of 26 when she published the novel “First Born.” The story was a “very angry outsider’s vision of growing up in suburbia.”\n\n“It was the outlier, earlier version of ‘Edward Scissorhands,’” she said.\n\nThe book opened the doors to meeting film professionals in Los Angeles, said the screenwriter. She then went about trying to get her book made into a movie.\n\nThompson wanted one of three directors to tackle her project— David Lynch, since the movie “Eraserhead” had a lot in common with her book; Brian De Palma, because, she said, his horror flick “Carrie” is the “greatest movie of all time”; and Penelope Spheeris because her documentary “The Decline of Western Civilization” is genius, Thompson said.\n\nSpheeris accepted the challenge and with Thompson adapted the book into a screenplay, but the movie was never made.\n\nThe experience helped Thompson meet filmmaker Tim Burton, who told her about a drawing he made in high school that depicted a boy with scissors for hands.\n\n“Somehow I knew exactly what to do with that image, what story to tell—and that was that,” she said.\n\nThompson said she prefers her unconventional version of fantasy because it allows her to “get closer to the heart, meat (and) truth” of a story.\n\nThompson said her privileged yet lonely childhood contributed to her success as a screenwriter.\n\n“I was the youngest of three and a bit ignored except at mealtimes, which I loathed,” she said. “I hated the food put in front of me and consequently had to sit at the table until I ate the food or it was bedtime. I usually sat under the table talking to myself until bedtime.”\n\nThompson said, she majored in English and ancient Greek classics at Amherst College.\n\n“Reading ancient Greek was the perfect preparation for being a screenwriter,” she said. “I learned to sit on my ass for impossible hours trying to work out impossible ideas.”\n\nThompson is working on a TV pilot for a new series. She lives in Carpinteria with her husband, producer Steve Nicolaides, three dogs and two horses.\n\nThe dynamic duo\n\nPaul and Daurio have been collaborating on family-friendly films since they met in 1997 through their church. Paul had written a play and Daurio nabbed a leading role. The fast friends formed a band and then wrote their first script together, “Bubble Boy,” in 1998.\n\n“Since then we’ve been inseparable,” Paul said.\n\nAs members of the Mormon Church, Paul and Daurio carved out a niche for themselves in Hollywood that has reaped them praise and honors. Their faith, Paul said, influences the kinds of projects they choose.\n\n“I think that’s a big reason why we ended up in the world of animation, where we make movies for everyone,” he said. “We never want our movies to be preachy, but we definitely want them to be about something.”\n\nPaul has some simple advice for aspiring screenwriters.\n\n“The advice I give most often is not to think one screenplay is going to be your ticket,” he said. “Write one, then another, then another, then another. . . . That’s how you become a writer. And when you’re a good enough writer, someone will want to pay you to do it.”\n\nPaul and Daurio are working on “Despicable Me 3.”\n\n“We just spent a few days in the recording studio with (actor) Steve Carell and had a blast,” Paul said. “We’re really excited about this one.”\n\nFestival schedule\n\nSept. 25:\n\n•6 p.m. VIP opening reception with showing of “Parenthood,” followed by Q&A with Kristine Belson, president of Sony Animation and producer of “How to Train Your Dragon” and “The Croods,” and screenwriter Lowell Ganz. All festival screenwriters have been invited to attend the reception.\n\nSept. 26:\n\n•11 a.m., “Despicable Me” with screenwriters Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio, moderated by Kristine Belson.\n\n•2 p.m., “Tremors” with screenwriters Brent Maddock and S.S. Wilson.\n\n•6 p.m., “Edward Scissorhands” with screenwriter Caroline Thompson."
