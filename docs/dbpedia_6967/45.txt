Edward Scissorhands is a 1990 American fantasy romance film directed by Tim Burton. It was produced by Burton and Denise Di Novi, and written by Caroline Thompson from a story by her and Burton.

Edward Scissorhands is the fourth feature film collaboration between director Tim Burton and composer Danny Elfman. The orchestra consisted of 79 musicians. Elfman cites Scissorhands as epitomizing his most personal and favorite work. In addition to Elfman’s music, three Tom Jones songs also appear: “It’s Not Unusual”, “Delilah” and “With These Hands”. “It’s Not Unusual” would later be used in Mars Attacks! (1996), another film of Burton’s with music composed by Elfman. Selections from the score had been used in the trailers for other films including The Secret Garden (1993), The Indian in the Cupboard (1995), The Ladykillers (2004), Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004) and two other Tim Burton films: The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and Big Fish (2003).
