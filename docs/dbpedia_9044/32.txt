Nancy Ajram's Charity Organization

Nancy Ajram is a Lebanese pop folk singer and multi-platinum recording artist. Born in Lebanon to a Maronite Catholic, she developed a flair for music at a young age. At the age of eight, she appeared at a singing contest for kids on national television in Lebanon. At the age of twelve, she participated in a Lebanese reality television competition, ‘Noujoum Al-Moustakbal, ("Stars of the Future"), where she won a gold medal. Subsequently, she started focusing on her voice and also took theory lessons, which led to the release of her first studio album as a teenager. Although her first two albums achieved moderate success, it was her lead single ‘Akhasmak Ah’ and third studio album ‘Ya Salam’ which gained her much popularity in the Arab World. The following year, she released another international best-seller ‘Ah W Noss’, which cemented her pop icon status in the Middle East. Her 2008 album ‘Bitfakkar Fi Eih’ showcased mature vocal abilities like never before and she won her first World Music Award as Best-selling Middle Eastern Artist. She has released several studio albums till date, along with other chart-topping singles and two children’s albums. Although her reception has been generally positive, she has faced criticism for being portrayed as a sex symbol in the Arab world. A leading philanthropist and humanitarian, she is the perfect epitome of a modern woman who is loved for her liberal thinking and delightful singing

Nancy Ajram is considered to be one of the richest and most successful music-stars in the Arab world. Her personal wealth is in excess of $16 million.
