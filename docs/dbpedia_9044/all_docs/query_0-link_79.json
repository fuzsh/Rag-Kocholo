The latest celebrity expected to cross over? None other than best-selling Lebanese singer Nancy Ajram. Although the former Vogue Arabia cover star is already world-renowned for her show-stopping televised performances on the industry’s grandest stages and as a beloved judge for Arab Idol, Ajram will be making her official acting debut this Ramadan in the upcoming regional comedy series Nisa Min Dahab, or “Woman of Gold”. Ajram will be joining a star-studded cast for her first silver-screen gig, including veteran Egyptian actors Nabila Ebeid and Nadia El Gendy.\n\nAlso Read: Behind-the-Scenes of Nancy Ajram’s Vogue Arabia Cover Shoot\n\nAlthough Ajram’s role is yet to be revealed, shooting for the serial already began across Lebanon in January, with many of the cast members already present and filming. Directed by seasoned Egyptian filmmaker Wael Ihsan, the premise of the show follows two friends portrayed by Ebeid and El Gendy who are conned in a property deal and must test the limits of their friendship to overcome unexpected obstacles and emerge triumphant. Viewers can tune into this 30-episode program every night during the Holy Month for a chance to see Ajram in action and hear the award-winning musician’s vocals in the show’s theme song.\n\nWith Ajram wrapping up her stint as a mentor for the third year of MBC’s The Voice Kids: Ahla Sawt just last week as this season’s winning coach, the Beirut-born artist is bound to soon head to her native country to join the rest of the team for filming and we can’t wait for the behind-the-scenes footage."
