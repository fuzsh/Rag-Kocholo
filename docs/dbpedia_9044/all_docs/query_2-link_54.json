        "text": "New York / Abu Dhabi, January 10, 2024—Reservoir Media, Inc. (NASDAQ: RSVR), an award-winning independent music company, in conjunction with PopArabia, the leading music publisher and independent music company in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), announced a new publishing deal with In2Musica, the label, publisher, and production house of Lebanese star Nancy Ajram. The deal includes Ajram’s entire owned catalog, including hit albums Ya Tabtab and Nancy 10, as well as future works.\n\nDubbed the “Queen of Arab Pop,” Nancy Ajram has made a name for herself as a singer, television personality, and businesswoman. In 2020, she was the most-streamed female Arab artist on Spotify, achieving more than 100 million plays of her songs. Ajram began her career acting on several television shows as a child, later releasing her debut studio album, Mihtagalak, at age 15. She has since released a total of 12 studio albums, including numerous chart-topping tracks like “3am Bet3ella2 Feek,” “Ma Tegi Heny,” and “Badna Nwalee El Jaw,” all of which boast over 100 million views on YouTube. Her catalog also includes the global hit “Sah Sah” with Marshmello, which was the first Arabic language song to enter Billboard’s Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart.\n\nIn 2010, Ajram became the best-selling female Middle Eastern singer of the prior decade. She has since made the list of Most Powerful Arabs published by Arabian Business several times and was similarly listed by Newsweek as one of the most influential Arab singers. She has also served as a judge on MBC’s reality show Arab Idol and was a coach on The Voice Kids Arabia.\n\nAjram commented, “I’m thrilled that In2Musica and I will be partnering with global companies like Reservoir and PopArabia, which have a history of advocating for artists’ rights and taking them around the world. We’re looking forward to reaching even more fans across the world with our music through this publishing partnership.”\n\nSpek, PopArabia Founder and Chief Executive Officer / Reservoir Executive Vice President of International and Emerging Markets, commented, “We are proud to be working with Nancy Ajram and In2Musica.” He added, “Nancy Ajram is a household name in the Middle East, and with the combined expert creative forces of PopArabia and Reservoir, we look forward to helping carve out additional global opportunities for her while also supporting her career and music locally.”\n\nReservoir Founder and Chief Executive Office Golnar Khosrowshahi added, “This deal marks a significant addition to our catalog of music rooted in the\n\nMiddle East. Working with a global superstar of Nancy’s stature is a meaningful opportunity for Reservoir and PopArabia, as we continue to champion Arabic music locally in the Middle East, as well as across the globe.”\n\nThis announcement comes on the heels of several transactions completed by Reservoir and PopArabia in MENA, furthering the Companies’ ongoing efforts to grow in the region and contribute to the Arabic music scene globally. PopArabia continues to be supported by twofour54, Abu Dhabi’s media zone that is home to the region’s entertainment industry. Also, as part of the deal, In2Musica will be represented worldwide by ESMAA, the Gulf-based rights management entity subsidiary of PopArabia that licenses performance, mechanical, and neighboring rights."
