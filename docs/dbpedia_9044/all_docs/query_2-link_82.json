It invests in the most influential Saudi, Gulf, and Arab films by the biggest stars of the Arab world.\n\nBorn on May 16, 1983, Ajram is an acclaimed singer who’s considered one of the best female singers in Lebanon and the Arab world. She started performing as a child and has participated in several television shows.\n\nIn 1998, Ajram released her debut studio album “Mihtagalak”. She became famous after the release of the controversial hit single “Akhasmak Ah” and her third studio album “Ya Salam” in 2003.\n\nMany consider Ajram an Arabic music icon, and Oprah Winfrey described her as one of the most influential personalities in the Middle East. She has participated in many Arabic festivals and won multiple awards, including the 2008 World Music Award for best-selling Middle Eastern artist, the youngest Arab WMA winner to date, the 2012 WMA for the second time, and the 2014 WMA for the third time. Ajram is a multi-platinum Lebanese singer and also serves as a Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF."
