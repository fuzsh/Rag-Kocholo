        "text": "CAIRO- 13 July 2020: Arabic streaming service ShahidVIP released a 30-second teaser for its new documentary titled “The Full Story” featuring famed Lebanese star Nancy Ajram and her husband, Fadi al-Hashem.\n\n“The Full Story” will be released on July 16, and will narrate the story of the burglary that occurred at Ajram’svilla in Beirut earlier in the year, in which 30-year-old intruder Mohammad al-Mousa, was reportedly shot and killed by Ajram's husband.\n\nIn the trailer, a conversation between Ajram and an interviewer took place where Ajram said, \"Minutes passed like a year. Did Fadi die? He didn’t die.\"\n\nThe interviewer then says, “We need to know some details; are you are going to tell us everything,” Ajramreplies, “Of course.”\n\nThe short Arabic documentary will feature snippets of real footage from the night of the theft.\n\nEarlier a number of lawyers from different Arab nationalities announced their solidarity with the man who was killed in Nancy Ajram’s Villa and went to Lebanon to defend him.\n\nThe number of volunteer lawyers reached 28 lawyers, including 14 Syrian lawyers living in US, 4 Moroccan lawyers, 3 Egyptian lawyers, and 7 others from Syria and Lebanon.\n\nThe Lebanese forensic pathologist report revealed that the man who entered the Lebanese singer's villa for theft was killed by 17 bullets, one shot in the right forearm, two shots in the left shoulder, one shot under the left armpit, three shots in the chest, two shots in the abdomen, seven shots in the back, and one shot in the left thigh.\n\n“Thanks God for saving me and my family from this catastrophe that took place at my residence. I hope that no one would ever have to go through this misery,” Ajram previously wrote on her twitter account.\n\nIn an interview on OTV channel, the Lebanese star said,\"My husband’s reaction to the killer was after intense threatening that took place for almost 6 to 7 minutes. The man was threatening my husband and asking for the place of his wife and children. To all those who criticized my husband, what would you do if you were in Fadi’sshoes?\"\n\nAt the beginning of the year Lebanese Prosecutor GhadaAoun released Nancy Ajram’s husband, Lebanese dentist Fadi al-Hashem, after listening to his testimony and banned him from travelling outside Lebanon.\n\nSome Syrian media outlets claimed that the deceased Syrian thief was a gardener who used to work in Ajram’svilla and came to take his financial receivables, the matter that was completely refuted by Hashem's brother.\n\nDirectly after this accident, Ajram’s husband was transferred to the hospital, according to sources that revealed that Hashem had a breakdown after the accident.\n\nLebanese newspapers explained that the thief got 17 bullets, and it was later revealed that the thief had a fake pistol, but Hashem did not realize that.\n\nSome sources said that one of the employees at Nancy Ajram's house was involved in the case and that he helped the thief enter the secured villa.\n\nOn January 5, Hachim shot dead a Syrian named Mohamed Hassan Moussa who entered the Lebanese singer’s villa at dawn in New Sheileh region for theft. Ajram got a minor injury in her right leg, but her daughters are safe. Lebanese security forces arrived at the star's villa at once and launched investigations into the accident.\n\nThe Lebanese diva is always eager to post pictures on her official social media accounts with her children and husband, unlike many celebrities in the Arab World who prefer not to expose their family members to the public.\n\nAjram was born in May 1983 in Achrafieh, Lebanon. When Ajram was 15 years old she released her debut studio album \"Mihtagalak\" (I need you) produced by EMI. The following year, she released her second album \"Sheel Oyoonak Anni\" (2001) (Take your eyes off me).\n\nShe was exceptionally accepted to the Syndicate of Professional Artists in Lebanon despite being under the legal age.\n\nHer career boosted in 2003, and in 2007 she sold over 2 million records, ranking third best-selling female artist in Lebanese history. According to her website, she was described on the Oprah Winfrey Show as one of the most influential personalities of the Middle East.\n\nAjram was announced the best-selling Middle Eastern female singer of the decade (2000–2009).\n\nAjram does not shy away from diversity in her songs; her albums usually draw on many dialects, including Egyptian, Lebanese or Khaleeji (Gulf). She is also one of the judges in \"The Voice Kids\" airing on MBC Masr.\n\nThroughout her career, Ajram has released a number of studio albums, including two dedicated for children, and numerous chart toppers such as the Lebanese hits \"Yay\", \"Ehsas Jdeed\" (New feeling); the Egyptian hits \"YaTabtab\", \"Mo'egaba\" (I'm in love), \"Ibn El-Giran\" (Neighbors' son), \"Fi Hagat\", \"Ma Tegi Hena\" (come here); and the Khaleeji hit of \"Ya Kether\"."
