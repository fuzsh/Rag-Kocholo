        "text": "The illustrious Nancy Ajram was born and raised in Achrafieh, Beirut, Lebanon. As a young girl, she was passionate about music, often participating in various singing competitions during her childhood. Her breakthrough came with the release of her debut album Mihtagalak at the tender age of 15, marking the beginning of a prolific career.\n\nOver the years, Nancy Ajram has released numerous albums, including Ya Salam (2003), Ah W Noss (2004), and Nancy 7 (2010), each contributing to her widespread acclaim. Some of her most popular songs include Ah W Noss, Enta Eih, and Ma Tegi Hena. In 2020, she emerged as the top-streamed Arab female artist on Spotify, amassing over 100 million plays for her songs, surpassing Lebanese icon Fairuz’s 67 million plays.\n\nAjram owes her stardom to her outstanding vocal abilities and charm and persona; her iconic music videos are almost considered cultural relics in the Arab world. Her most popular music video, Aah W Noss, has amassed 134 million views. Most recently, she was thrown into the international spotlight when, during an interview, rising star Billie Eilish expressed admiration for the Lebanese singer’s heartbreak anthem song Enta Eih.\n\nKnown in the Arab world for her chart-topping hits, Ajram is also a dedicated philanthropist. She actively engages in charity events and concerts, prioritizing them in her music career. She released Risala Lil Aalam (A Message to the World), a song promoting peace, as part of her first children’s album. Additionally, she contributed to the charity event ‘The Big Ball’ in Dubai, raising funds for underprivileged children. Ajram was appointed the first female regional ambassador for the Middle East and North Africa by UNICEF in 2009, initiating her charity projects in 2010. She also participated in UNICEF’s 20th-anniversary commercial for the Convention on the Rights of the Child. In 2013, she performed the theme song for Worth 100 Men, a radio fiction series produced by The Womanity Foundation supporting women’s education and development.\n\nIn addition to her music and humanitarian efforts, the pop sensation is also an entrepreneur par excellence. She is the first and only female spokesperson for Coca-Cola in the Arab world. She has released popular Coke anthems like Oul Tani Keda, El Dounya Helwa, Noss El Kawn, and Shaggaa Bi Alamak. Ajram is a regular on the list of Most Powerful Arabs in Arabian Business and has been recognized by Newsweek as one of the most influential Arab singers.\n\nIn August 2011, Nissan selected Nancy Ajram as the official ambassador for the Middle East and North Africa. She unveiled the all-new 2012 Nissan Micra on September 7 at a dedicated press conference in Lebanon. In 2014, she became an ambassador for Huawei. From 2013 to 2017, she judged MBC’s reality talent show, Arab Idol, and started coaching on The Voice Kids Arabia in 2016. Most recently, KHAMSA covered her Tiffany & Co Lovelock campaign.\n\nBeyond her professional life, Nancy is active on social media, connecting with her fans and providing glimpses into her personal and professional endeavours. Her social media platforms showcase her lifestyle, fashion choices, and snippets of her family life. She is the most followed Arab person on Instagram.\n\nMarried to Lebanese dentist Fadi El Hachem, she is also a mother to three children – two daughters, Mila and Ella, and a son named Eli.\n\nThroughout the highs and lows of her life, Nancy Ajram remains a beloved figure, admired for her artistry, authenticity, and philanthropy."
