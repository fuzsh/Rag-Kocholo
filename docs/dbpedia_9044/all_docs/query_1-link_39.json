        "text": "Nancy Ajram (نانسي عجرم ‎) is one of the most famous singers and one of the most recognized faces on Arab screens. She is young, innovative, lively and fun! Her glamour never ends, and she only gains more and more fans all the time.\n\nNancy Ajram (born 16, 1973) is a multi-platinum Lebanese singer and Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF. Nancy began performing as a child and released her first studio album by the age of 15. Her breakthrough occurred with the start of her collaboration with well-known producer Jiji Lamara, when she released her smash-hit “Akhasmak Ah” and 3rd studio album, Ya Salam. In 2004, she released her second international best-seller “Ah w Noss”, which spawned several smash-hits, “Ah w Noss”, “Lawn Ouyounak”, and “Inta Eih” at which point Nancy had established pop icon status in the Middle East. By 2007, Ajram had sold over 30 million records ranking 3rd best selling female artist in Lebanese history.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDrkU0rzFu8&feature=relmfu\n\nHer 2008 album “Bitfakkar Fi Eih” spawned seven singles and won Nancy’s first World Music Award as Best-selling Middle Eastern Artist, the youngest Arab WMA winner to date. She has released seven studio albums to date and numerous chart-topping singles such as “Atabtab”, “Moegaba”, “Ehsas Jdeed”, “El Donya Helwa”, “Mashi Haddi”, and “Fi Hagat”. Nancy Ajram is the first and only female sponsor and spokesperson of Coca-Cola in the Middle East and Arab world. Considered by many as an Arabic music icon of the decade, Nancy was described on the Oprah Winfrey Show as one of the most influential personalities of the Middle East.\n\nNancy has made the list of Most Powerful Arabs on Arabian Business several times, and was similarly listed by Newsweek as one of the most influential Arabs. Nancy’s official Facebook page is the most subscribed Arabic artist page on the social-networking site and the first to reach 1 million subscribers], and her music video for “Fi Hagat” was an Internet phenomenon and is currently the most viewed Arabic music video on the Internet, being the first to hit 10 million views on Youtube.\n\nLast but not least, here are some useful words:\n\nMusic = موسيقى\n\nSinging = غناء\n\nSinger = مطربة / مغنية\n\nSong = أغنية\n\nGoodwill ambassador = سفيرة للنوايا الحسنة\n\nArt = فن\n\nArtist = فنانة\n\nAward = جائزة"
