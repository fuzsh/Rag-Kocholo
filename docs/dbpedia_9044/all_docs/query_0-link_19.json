        "text": "\"Sugar Daddy\" movie was released in Egyptian cinemas on May 24.\n\nThe Lebanese diva is always eager to post pictures on her official social media accounts with her children and husband, unlike many celebrities in the Arab World who prefer not to expose their family members to the public.\n\nAjram was born in May 1983 in Achrafieh, Lebanon. When Ajram was 15 years old she released her debut studio album \"Mihtagalak\" (I need you) produced by EMI. The following year, she released her second album \"Sheel Oyoonak Anni\" (2001) (Take your eyes off me).\n\nShe was exceptionally accepted to the Syndicate of Professional Artists in Lebanon despite being under the legal age.\n\nHer career boosted in 2003, and in 2007 she sold over 2 million records, ranking third best-selling female artist in Lebanese history. According to her website, she was described on the Oprah Winfrey Show as one of the most influential personalities of the Middle East.\n\nAjram was announced the best-selling Middle Eastern female singer of the decade (2000â€“2009).\n\nAjram does not shy away from diversity in her songs; her albums usually draw on many dialects, including Egyptian, Lebanese or Khaleeji (Gulf).\n\nShe was also one of the judges in \"The Voice Kids\" program.\n\nThroughout her career, Ajram has released a number of studio albums, including two dedicated for children, and numerous chart toppers such as the Lebanese hits \"Yay\", \"Ehsas Jdeed\" (New feeling); the Egyptian hits \"YaTabtab\", \"Mo'egaba\" (I'm in love), \"Ibn El-Giran\" (Neighbors' son), \"Fi Hagat\", \"Ma Tegi Hena\" (come here); and the Khaleeji hit of \"Ya Kether\"."
