        "text": "Nancy was born in Beirut and raised in new Sehaile. At the age of 4 Nancy started showing a real affinity for music, but it was at the age of 8 that Nancy really started to reveal her true promise. Nancy participated in a Unicef children’s singing competition show on LBC TV and took home a first place trophy. At age 10, she again took home the first place trophy – this time at “Mawaheb Zghire” program on Tele Liban TV. It was at this point that Nancy’s father, Nabil Ajram, really started to foster her talent by sending her to study voice and music theory with the best teachers in Lebanon. Without hesitation he encouraged her to pursue her dreams. All of these efforts were rewarded when, at the age of 12, Nancy participated in a TV program called “Noujoum Al Mostakbal” and won the gold medal for the Tarab category.\n\nThe latest in a string of successes for the young Nancy was, that despite the fact that she was less than 18 years old, the syndicate of professional artists in Lebanon accepted Nancy as a member because they found her to be an exceptional talent, worthy of being qualified as a professional artist.\n\nNancy launched her first album “Mouhtagalak” in 1998 and her second album “Shil Oyounak Ani” in 2001 but the real turning point in her career came with the massive hit from her the third album, “Ya Salam” in 2003 which won the hearts of people from all ages and nationalities and earned Nancy her reputation as the Arab World’s Sweetheart. Following this success, Nancy launched her fourth album “Ah w Noss” in 2005 followed by her fifth, “Ya Tabtab” in 2006. By that time, Nancy had gained a big following among the Arab world’s children, so in 2007, she decided to dedicate a special CD just for kids “Shakhbat Shakhabit” In 2008, her 6th album “Bitfakkar bi Eh” was released continuing her success.\n\nDue to her growing success, Nancy was chosen as a brand ambassador for Coca Cola, Damas Jewellery, and Sony Ericsson in 2009."
