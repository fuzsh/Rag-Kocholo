The killer had used knives from Jennifer's own set, a wedding gift the couple had only just opened. Upon returning home from work, her husband, Justin Judd, finds Jennifer lying on the kitchen floor with the blade of a knife still lodged in her back. Police immediately suspect one of Jennifer and Justin’s friends. A decade later, another man confesses. However, the case is never solved. In this captivating new series from ID, investigator Sarah Cailean attempts to answer the 32-year-old question: Who Killed Jennifer Judd? She’ll speak with Jennifer’s friends and family as she seeks to understand Jennifer’s life and untimely death.
