        "text": "This page contains a translation into English of the lyrics to the hit Egyptian pop song \"Ah Wa Noss\", which was made popular by Nancy Ajram. This song was a top hit in Egypt in 2004, following Ajram's previous success with another major hit, \"Akhasmak, Ah\". Also included is a transliteration of the Arabic lyrics into the Roman alphabet so you can sing along if you like.\n\nAh Wa Noss (Ah and a Half), 2004\n\nSong Title in Arabic: Ø¢Ù ÙÙØµâ\n\nAlbum: Ah Wa Noss\n\nLyricist: Ayman Bahgat Amar\n\nComposer: Tarek Madkour\n\nOriginal Artist: Nancy Ajram\n\nSong lyrics and other related information are provided for educational purposes. If you like the song, please purchase either the album or a download from an authorized source.\n\nAbout this Song\n\nFour singles were released from the album Ah Wa Noss. This song was the lead single, the first to be released.\n\nAbout Nancy Ajram\n\nBorn May 16,1983 in the Beirut area, Nancy Ajram is an immensely popular Lebanese singer, ranking as the third most popular female singer in Lebanese history. At age 8, Nancy began singing favorite oldies with her grandmother. She entered children's talent contests sponsored by two local television stations, TL and LBC. She achieved stardom when she appeared on a talent competition called Noujoum Al Moustakbal (Stars of the Future) sponsored by Future Television.\n\nIn 2003, Nancy released the song \"Akhasmak, Aah\", and prompted the Egyptian parliament to release an official decree banning the airing of its music video. The parliament said it was due to decency issues, both due to the nature of the video's content and also to the manner in which it was shot.\n\nAjram's major hit \"Ah Wa Noss\" was released in 2004. In 2005, she became Coca Cola's official celebrity spokesperson. Her first Coca Cola commercial used her hit \"Oul Tany Kida\".\n\nAjram won the 2008 World Music Award in the category for best-selling Middle Eastern artist.\n\nTo me, Tahseen was so much more than a contributor to my web site. Even though we lived far apart, I saw Tahseen and Kathe several times over the years. I always appreciated their warmth and generosity. I first \"met\" Tahseen online back in 1997 on the med-dance list on the Internet, where he periodically posted messages. I knew he was in Lawrence, Kansas, so when a business trip arose requiring me to travel to the Kansas City area, I emailed him to say I'd be in the neighborhood. He and Kathe came to Kansas City for an evening get-together at Tasso's restaurant, and they invited several local dancers to join us. I saw them on follow-up visits to Kansas City. They vended at Rakkasah for several years, and it was always a pleasure to greet them there in the anteroom off to the left of the main stage. I also enjoyed encountering them in Egypt at the Ahlan wa Sahlan festival.\n\nTahseen will be missed by many."
