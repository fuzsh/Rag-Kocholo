        "text": "Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (February 27th, 2024) – The Saudi Motorsport Company (SMC) – Promoter of the FORMULA 1 STC SAUDI ARABIAN GRAND PRIX 2024 – has today confirmed that Nancy Ajram, DJ Aly & Mahmoud El Esseily have joined the line-up for the post-Qualifying concert on the Jeddah Corniche Circuit Main Stage on Friday March 8th!\n\nThe pinnacle of motorsport will be returning to Jeddah, home of the world’s fastest street circuit, on 7th-9th March 2024 and will see a change to its previous weekend format, with the Grand Prix taking place on Saturday night in order to avoid a clash with the start of the holy month of Ramadan.\n\nNancy Ajram is a multi-platinum Lebanese recording artist and multiple award winner for best-selling artist in the Middle East & Arab World, with numerous chart-topping smash hits such as “Ah W Noss”, “Ya Tabtab wa Dallaa”, “Enta Eih”, “Fi Hagat”, “Akhasmak Ah”, “Badna Nwallea El Jaw”, and \"Aam Betaala' Feek\".\n\nNancy Ajram’s music revolutionized Arabic pop throughout a tremendously successful career spanning over two decades. She is considered one of the Middle East’s largest pop icons, and her music has paved the way for Arabic music to be heard all over the globe.\n\nNancy Ajram is also the youngest Arab singer to win the World Music Award to date, and the first Arabic singing female artist to be featured on a Times Square billboard. She’s also the first Arab artist with the first Arabic language song to debut on the top ten of the US iTunes charts and the American Billboard Dance Charts, with her smash-hit collaboration with Marshmello “Sah Sah”. DJ Aly – also known as Aly Fathala - has been a mainstay in the music business since 2003 as one part of the Trance Duo Aly & Fila as well as composing scores for multinational advertisements, producing music for Arab stars and recently creating remixes for classic Arab and international tracks. Aly & Fila’s first track ‘Eye of Horus’ was picked up by Paul Van Dyk, Armin Van Buuren and DJ Tiesto and kick started his and Fila’s successful careers as international trance producers and DJ’s. DJ Aly has since worked alongside some of the world’s biggest Trance DJs & producers and released countless singles, remixes, albums, and Compilations. He has also composed and produced hit tracks for advertisements starring Mohamed Mounir, Nancy Agram, Elissa, Hussein el Gasmy, Mahmoud El Esseily, Hisham Abbass , Hamid El Shaery, Asala, Ruby, Ahmed Saad, Ramy Sabry, Mostafa Haggag , Medhat Saleh and Hamza Namira amongst others. As one of the most versatile and talented artists in the region, Mahmoud El Esseily has garnered international acclaim for his captivating performances, innovative compositions, and distinctive vocal style. With hits such as \"Daloaa\" and \"Keda Keda Bayza,\" El Esseily has solidified his position as a leading figure in the world of music.\n\nEl Esseily's musical journey began at a young age when his innate talent for music was recognized by his mother, who enrolled him in piano lessons at the tender age of 4. Despite early challenges, including veering off classical paths to pursue his unique musical expressions, El Esseily's dedication and passion for music propelled him to success.\n\nHaving achieved a bachelor's degree in mass communication and integrated marketing at the American University in Cairo, El Esseily's career took off with the release of his debut video clip, \"Magnona\" (Crazy), in 2003. The song garnered widespread acclaim, leading to El Esseily’s stardom.\n\nThe addition of Nancy Ajram, DJ Aly & Mahmoud El Esseily to the Friday night line-up of A-List performers – Australian mega DJ FISHER is also set to play on the 8th March, while the iconic Alicia Keys, legendary Pharrell Williams and superstar DJ, Martin Garrix are confirmed to perform on Saturday March 9th – further underlines the unrivalled entertainment offering that fans will experience throughout the FORMULA 1 STC SAUDI ARABIAN GRAND PRIX 2024 weekend. Audiences will be treated to three action-packed days of world-class racing and live performances by the world’s greatest drivers and artists respectively.\n\nIt is increasingly clear that the FORMULA 1 STC SAUDI ARABIAN GRAND PRIX 2024 will be an event that simply cannot be missed!\n\nTo discover more about the FORMULA 1 SAUDI ARABIAN GRAND PRIX 2024 and purchase your tickets, please visit www.saudiarabiangp.com\n\nFollow us on social:\n\nTwitter: @SaudiArabianGP\n\nInstagram: @saudiarabiangp\n\nFacebook: @saudiarabiangp\n\nFor Media Enquiries:"
