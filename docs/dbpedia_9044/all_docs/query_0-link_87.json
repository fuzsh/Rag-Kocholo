        "text": "No one could do it but her. At 28, Nancy Ajram has everything a woman could want - a multi-platinum music career, a loving family and a massive following in the Middle East. Discovered at the age of 12 on a Lebanese TV singing competition, her career took off at 15 with her first album - Mihtagalak (I Need You). Since then her music has had the Midas touch turning every melody into instant gold.\n\nThe fairy tale continued in her personal life as she married her sweetheart Dr Fadi Al Hachem in 2008 after a three-year relationship and today she is the mother of two lovely girls Mila (three) and Ella (eight months). Her concerts sell out and she is the first female spokeswoman of Coca-Cola in the Middle East and the face of Damas Jewellery's popular collection, Farfasha.\n\nEven the popular American talk-show host turned media mogul, Oprah Winfrey is a fan and has called Nancy the most influential personality in the Middle East. She even went as far as to dub her the â€˜Britney Spears of the region'.\n\nLast month Nancy held a concert at the Madinat Arena here in Dubai, where she received a huge response from her fans. Given her success, it would be easy to take her foot off the gas and bask in the glory and glamour of her celebrity but that's not an option for Nancy.\n\nShe believes it's her duty as a star to help others who are less fortunate, especially children living in poverty around the world. In addition to running her own charity in Beirut, becoming the first female regional ambassador for Unicef Middle East and North Africa, she has worked on various projects that strive to protect the rights of children around the world. Nancy raised Dh940,000 auctioning her gowns and accessories at the Big Ball event in Dubai in 2008 and appeared in a Unicef commercial to mark the 20th anniversary of the Convention of the Rights of the Child.\n\nNancy released a song for her daughter Mila on the day she was born called Ya Rab Tekbar Mila (I Pray That Mila Grows Up) and now, after the birth of her second baby in April, Ella, she is planning an album for kids. \"I love singing for kids because, first of all, I love children and I feel close to them,\" she says.\n\nIn an exclusive interview, Nancy tells Friday about her responsibility to help others.\n\nYou have participated in numerous charity events for children. Why did you choose to be a Unicef ambassador?\n\nWell, I think that Unicef is a great non-governmental organisation. It is international and helps all those who are in need. Basically, that's what encouraged me to cooperate with them.\n\nAre many children around the world neglected or exploited?\n\nYes, of course. There are a lot of mistreated kids who have been denied their basic rights.\n\nHas becoming a mother inspired you to help even more?\n\nMy sentiment about this has always been strong but when I had two children - my daughters Mila and Ella - I think I've understood the situation better.\n\nYou also have your own charity, which you started in 2006. It goes beyond just helping children by distributing money to the poor, doesn't it?\n\nWell, I don't like to speak about this a lot but it helps people in need especially in difficult times like during the war of 2006 in Lebanon.\n\nDo you think it might be a better idea to give the poor some vocational guidance and provide them with a dignified life where they earn for themselves rather than being objects of compassion?\n\nIt's a good idea to help them and give them guidance so they can help themselves but that's not so easy. Sometimes the moral burden is too heavy and they need time to surpass it. Therefore, we should help them first then try to guide them.\n\nWith the wealth, success and fame you have it would be easy to lose sight of the underbelly of society. How have you managed to stay focused and remember these people?\n\nI could never forget marginalised people. They are everywhere - on TV, in the news and in the streets. Working with them is part of my life.\n\nDo your values of compassion and kindness come from your childhood? What role did your parents play in nurturing these feelings?\n\nMy parents were always kind to people in need and as a kid I used to see that, so I directly inherited this virtue from them.\n\nYour husband is a doctor. Does he also lend a helping hand in these charities?\n\nOf course, Fadi also cares a lot about people in need and helps them as well.\n\nYou have supported the Convention of the Rights of Child by appearing in a Unicef commercial to mark the 20th anniversary of the convention in 2010. As a mother of two daughters what are the rights that you feel should be upheld?\n\nAll the rights of the convention should be upheld. However, I stress the rights of education for all. That's the base of everything.\n\nDue to poverty, many children are forced to support their families. As someone who began her music career as a teenager, what are your feelings on this?\n\nWell, in my career I wasn't singing to support my family so I don't know first-hand about this issue. But I feel really bad about children who have to sacrifice their childhood and are obliged to bear responsibilities that are not in keeping with their age.\n\nShould children be exposed to showbiz?\n\nNothing should be exaggerated. If a kid is working in showbiz, they should be taken care of and their rights should be respected. If all this is done, then there is no problem. But when they are exploited, a big problem arises.\n\nWhat are the lessons your have learnt that you would like to impart to other young aspiring singers?\n\nThe most important thing I've learnt is that you should always be yourself. Make sure you keep your feet on the ground, don't become arrogant and make sure you give your work the time and devotion it needs.\n\nThere are so many crimes being committed against children - abuse, trafficking and child labour. How can we combat these?\n\nWe can never find a radical solution for all these, however, we can do our best to fight it. When we all work together and collaborate, we can build a better society.\n\nWhat dreams do you have to make this world a better place for children?\n\nI would like children to have a better education, a decent life, enough food and a caring family.\n\nIf you had the chance to change one thing in the world for children what would that be?\n\nEradicate poverty.\n\nYou single handedly raised Dh940,000 in one night during the Big Ball charity event in 2008 in Dubai by auctioning your dresses and accessories. Do you plan to do this again?\n\nMaybe, no one knows what life has in store!\n\nShould celebrities guide their fans towards philanthropy by setting an example themselves?\n\nYes, of course. Every person who is an idol or can be an example for other people should do something in the field of charity and helping others. That's our responsibility.\n\nWhat is the kind of life you envisage for your daughters?\n\nI would like them to live a decent life that fulfils all their needs and rights. I want them to be successful and of course, to have great familial bonds.\n\nYou call Dubai your second home. What do you like about the city?\n\nI love Dubai a lot. I find a lot of things to do there and I have so much fun with my family.\n\nDo you plan to come out with any special album dedicated to children? What are you are currently working on?\n\nI will issue a new album for kids in two months. And I've started listening to some songs for the next album.\n\nHow does it feel to be re-signed as the ambassador to the most popular gold jewellery brand - Farfasha - that represents the free spirit of young girls?\n\nMy collaboration with Farfasha is very successful and I really like working with this great international brand from Damas.\n\nWhat's your favourite piece from the Farfasha collection?\n\nI like all of the sets. Each one of them is suitable for a different occasion. I like the whole collection but most of all I like the set I wear in the ad with a falcon. It is nice and classy. That is from the Mora Mora collection.\n\nDo you feel the fun, femininity and energy that Farfasha stands for exists in you?\n\nOf course, I see a reflection of my personality in Farfasha and that's why I was chosen and why I accepted to be the brand's ambassador in the first place."
