Nancy is also one of the best-selling Middle-Eastern artist who is one of the richest and most successful music-stars in the Arab World. Nancy was born in Beirut, Lebanon to a Greek Orthodox family. In 1995, at the age of 12, she joined the variety show Noujoum Al-Moustakbal (“Stars of the Future”), a Lebanese talent show similar to “American Idol.” A few years later in 1998, Nancy released her first album which started her music career. However, her most famous song “Ah W Noss” made her an international star, and got her to be Coca-Cola official celebrity spokesperson in the Levant, Arabia, and North Africa regions. To this day she is the first and only female spokesperson for Coca-Cola in the Middle-East and the Arab World\n\nBesides being famous for her music, Nancy is considerably famous for her participation in many charity events and concerts. In October 22, 2009, UNICEF chose Ajram as the first female regional ambassador for the Middle East and North Africa. She also appeared in UNICEF’s commercial celebration the 20th anniversary of the “Convention on the Rights of the Child, along with other influential Middle Eastern celebrities such as Kadhim Al-Sahir, Saber el-Rebai and Karess Bashar.\n\nOne of the things that makes Nancy Ajram unique amongst other Middle Eastern singers is that she is the first woman to be a spokesperson, either for Coca-Cola or UNICEF. She is a Middle Eastern feminist icon, she in fact has said “Arab women are very special and are now reaching quite high positions in life.”"
