        "text": "Lebanese pop singer Nancy Ajram returned to California to a passionate crowd with a sold-out show at Pechanga Theater on Sunday, March 19.\n\nAlthough Ajram was born in Beirut, her catchy, danceable hits skyrocketed her to popularity across the Middle East and North African region. Syrians, Jordanians, Iraqis and more cheered when their homeland was rattled off before the show started to celebrate the various cultures under the “Arab” banner.\n\nThe San Diego show was the last stop on a very short five show “USA & Canada Tour” that began in Houston just 10 days ago. In a roughly one-hour-and-45-minute set, Ajram played the most popular songs in her more than two decade-long career kicking off the show with “Badna Nwalee El Jaw” which loosely translates to “We want to light up the atmosphere.”\n\nFrom the start, it was clear Ajram was having difficulties with her in-ear monitor, repeatedly telling her team off stage that she wasn’t able to hear or asking them adjust volume levels through out the show. At times, the sound difficulties prevented her from singing the entirety of the song, leaning on the eager crowd to sing parts of the chorus.\n\nBut, fans weren’t fazed. Concert-goers, some dressed in formal dresses and shoes to match Ajram’s dazzling floor-length gown and glistening jewelry, both young and old, male and female, were dancing and singing along for the entirety of the show.\n\nMultiple bouquets of flowers were passed to Ajram while she sang and she would often stop at the edge of the stage to take photos with fans during the show. A young fan was even lifted onto the stage for a photo and a hug.\n\nThe crowd at one point grew so big from people leaving their seats to rush the stage that an announcement, which Ajram passed off to a member of her team, was made that everyone had to return to their seats or the concert would be shut down due to safety and fire hazards. The house lights remained on for over half the show due to people moving around so frequently.\n\n“I wish there wasn’t security,” Ajram said in Arabic at one point in the show.\n\nWith the exception of one group who were escorted out during the show, most fans listened to the warning and returned to finish the rest of the show in their seats.\n\nAlthough Ajram’s music has been mostly contained to the Arab world, some collaborations have become more mainstream. One version’s of K’naan’s “Waving Flag” featured Nancy Ajram when the song exploded in popularity during the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Ajram more recently collaborated with electronic artist and DJ Marshmallo on “Sah Sah” (translated to “Yes Yes”). The track became the first Arab song to hit Billboard’s Dance Charts, debuting at No. 38.\n\nLike many of Ajram’s songs, “Sah Sah” features the santur, an instrument dating back centuries made of wood with steel or bronze strings . Ajram had a full band of 10 musicians, including two backup singers and a percussionist playing the darbuka, or goblet drum. Many of her songs included long musical interludes with a blend of traditional Arab music and contemporary Arab pop.\n\n“It’s been so long since I’ve been here, I missed you,” Ajram said in Arabic to the crowd. “I’m going to go again, but I won’t be gone as long as last time.”"
