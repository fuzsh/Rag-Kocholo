        "text": "Tiffany & Co. has unveiled its recent global campaign, with Lebanese superstar Nancy Ajram taking centre stage.\n\nNancy, who joined the heritage jewellery house as an ambassador earlier this year, stars in the campaign alongside other global ambassadors including actress Florence Pugh and K-Pop stars ROSÉ and Jimin.\n\nAll four ambassadors are adorned in the new iteration of the Tiffany Lock collection. The collection launched earlier this year and is inspired by the Maison’s archival padlock from 1883.\n\nDressed in a white blazer, Nancy wears a series of pieces from the collection including earrings, bracelets and a statement necklace.\n\nThe latest additions to the collection are designed for all genders and introduces new pieces designed in a veriety of new colourways. One stand out new release includes a new Tiffany Lock bracelet in 18k white gold with half pavé diamonds and half baguette diamonds.\n\n“To me, love is an infinite source of creativity,” she said of the collection. “Tiffany Lock represents the power inherent in love; the significance of unbreakable bonds—the connections that don’t falter with time.”\n\nThe singer, 40, was officially announced as an ambassador back in February this year.\n\nJust a few months later, at the beginning of June, Nancy inaugurated the new Tiffany & Co. flagship store in The Dubai Mall.\n\n“Dazzling in Dubai with Tiffany and Co.,” she said. “Joining the celebration of the newest flagship store, where luxury meets timeless beauty.”"
