In late 1800s Cornwall, the vicious smuggler Black John (Bernard Lee) had a splendid racket plundering the ships he caused to founder... and enough dirt on hapless local magistrate Squire Trevenyan (Peter Cushing) to keep him out of the way.

Colorful swashbuckler also stars MichÃ¨le Mercier, George Coulouris, William Franklyn, June Thorburn, Liz Frazer. 82 min. Widescreen; Soundtrack: English. Region Free
