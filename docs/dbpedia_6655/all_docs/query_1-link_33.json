        "text": "Soon after starting your adventure in Assassin's Creed Odyssey, you'll gain access to the ship, The Adrestia, and its captain, Barnabas.\n\nLike in Assassin's Creed Black Flag, you'll be able to transition between exploring on land and at sea by traveling to any port and summoning the Adrestia - which lets you engage in both naval combat and traversal.\n\nThe Adrestia boasts a wide range of upgrades, both practical and cosmetic - and these either cost money or you'll have to know which underwater ruins to loot.\n\nUpgrades are integral to all aspects of your ship - from rowing and ramming to javeling and arrow firepower, and you'll want to upgrade all of them to remain a formidable power on the seas. You can also upgrade your ship's hull to include more recruitable Lieutenants to further bolster your ships abilities."
