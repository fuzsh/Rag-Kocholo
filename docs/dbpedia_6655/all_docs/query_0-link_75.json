        "text": "Nigel Farage has sparked outrage after being spotted using a disabled parking spot for 45 minutes to go shopping at M&S.\n\nPictures taken on Monday 22 April show the former UKIP leader exit a white BMW on North Wharf Road, next to St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington in London - clearly marked as disabled parking only.\n\nHis chauffeur, who was driving the vehicle, is said to have walked Mr Farage - now president of the resurgent Reform UK - to a building before waiting while smoking cigarettes and buying food.\n\nMr Farage then exited the building and the pair then stopped off at M&S before returning to the car and leaving.\n\nAn eyewitness - who wished to remain anonymous - said: \"It's outrageous.\n\n\"Everyone else has to obey the rules but he can just park in a disabled bay when he makes rules for everybody else.\"\n\nAccording to the witness, Mr Farage's driver was parked in the bay from approximately 10.43am to 11.29am.\n\nWestminster City Council confirmed pick up and set down is permitted in the parking bay - as long as they don't exceed two minutes - but state \"subsequent waiting is not allowed without a disabled badge being on display or further exemption\".\n\nA Westminster City Council spokesperson said: \"The council monitors these bays to ensure drivers are complying with the rules.\"\n\nThe witness said: \"I wasn't too happy - there were other people trying to look for parking spaces, even to the point where they were pulling up beside me.\n\n\"It was busy so lots of people were looking over at that disabled spot then driving off.\n\n\"The chauffeur driver saw it then I just saw him reverse into the parking spot.\n\n\"Nigel Farage got out and walked into a building opposite.\n\n\"The driver walked him into the building, then came out, gone over to another building across road and eaten food.\n\n\"The driver was smoking cigs, spitting on the floor, they had no care where they were parking.\"\n\nThe witness said Mr Farage came back with an M&S bag in his hand which he didn't appear to have before.\n\n\"He must have popped to the shops after his meeting,\" they said.\n\nRepresentatives of Farage have refused to comment but he previously spoke out about refusing to be registered as partially disabled after major surgery following a near-fatal plane crash during the 2010 General Election.\n\nSpeaking in September last year, the GB News presenter said: “After the aeroplane crash that I was involved in in 2010, when the x-rays came back, and I had major surgery, the neurosurgeon said, ‘well, Nigel, with your condition if you want, I can sign you off as partially disabled’ and I told him politely, where to go.\n\n“You see, I think for many people, this is about a state of mind.”\n\nNigel Farage's office was approached for comment but did not respond."
