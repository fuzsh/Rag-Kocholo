The only way to make an NPC Friendly is to help them complete their personal quest.\n\nNote that Sasha Nevah is a little different. She becomes Unfriendly if someone is from her port city (Ilizmagorti).\n\nKarui Kage\n\nTom Qadim wrote:\n\nVanus wrote:\n\nI had a question about the NPC's starting attitude.

You make them *friendly* through normal diplomacy checks.\n\nOtherwise yes, they start as unfriendly to most PCs, or indifferent if you came from the same port.\n\nRobert G.

Was the intent of this to have the PCs grow up in that city, or just board from there?\n\nThe campaign traits in the soon-to-be-released Player's Guide only deal with boarding in a particular city, but you could make it so it applies to characters who grew up in that city as well. I probably wouldn't restrict it to only growing up there, as there's a lot of cities on Golarion, and the chances of the two matching are slim.\n\nVanus wrote:\n\nI also noticed a discrepancy in what building a shelter does for you in alleviating the bug/disease aspect.

A shelter and campfire (mentioned in the \"shelter\" section reduce it to 10%.\n\nVanus\n\nKarui Kage wrote:\n\nTom Qadim wrote:\n\nVanus wrote:\n\nI had a question about the NPC's starting attitude.

Depending on where you boarded the Jenivere (choices your PCs make by picking a campaign trait from the upcoming Player's Guide), the PCs can make those NPCs more friendly simply because the NPCs are more well-disposed toward folks who know about their home towns; the PCs don't necessarily have to be FROM those towns to get the attitude adjustment reward, though.\n\nBasically, what Rob said.\n\nTom Qadim RPG Superstar 2010 Top 16, 2011 Top 32, 2012 Top 4\n\nKarui Kage wrote:\n\nA bit of a correction to your own spoiler.\n\n** spoiler omitted **\n\nThank you!\n\nDM Wellard\n\n1 person marked this as a favorite.\n\nScipion del Ferro wrote:\n\nI am stoked to start a PBP for this.\n\nJust watch out SDF that opening scene is a pain to run PbP wise.\n\nTom Qadim RPG Superstar 2010 Top 16, 2011 Top 32, 2012 Top 4\n\nLisa, please hire an Assistant Creative Director so James can write more often. ;-)\n\nThis is REALLY good stuff!\n\nchopswil\n\nStat Block Issue: Vegepygmy Boss p. 25 sems to be missing a Feat.\n\n3= +2 (fighter 1) +1 HD\n\nSB says 2.\n\nchopswil\n\nStat Block Issue: Malikadna p. 30 should have the Alertness Feat due to her familiar.\n\nchopswil\n\nStat Block Issue: Gelik Aberwhinge p. 60, damage for longsword should use 1d8 not 1d6\n\nWolfthulhu\n\nchopswil wrote:\n\nStat Block Issue: Gelik Aberwhinge p. 60, damage for longsword should use 1d8 not 1d6\n\nA small sized longsword, such as would be used by a gnome, does 1d6 damage.\n\nHowever, Gelik does seem to be missing his Gnome Obsessive trait.\n\nKvantum\n\nchopswil wrote:\n\nStat Block Issue: Vegepygmy Boss p. 25 sems to be missing a Feat.\n\n3= +2 (fighter 1) +1 HD\n\nSB says 2.\n\nNo it's not.

Not sure why.\n\nUnderstandable. I probably wouldn't have noticed if I wasn't entering the shipwreck NPCs into Hero Lab.\n\nSpoiler:\n\nI assigned it to Profession: Gambler, just to fill the spot. With no ranks in it it doesn't make a difference, but I thought it added to his 'seedy' flavor.'\n\nErik Freund RPG Superstar 2011 Top 16\n\nScipion del Ferro wrote:\n\nHey guys, I made a small illustration to help visualize the ships journey.

This just seems really, really slow considering it took them 71 days to get to this point from Magnimar which is like 1,500 miles north (including stops).\n\nI'm just curious if there's a cause for this besides; \"The guys who made Smuggler's Shiv never saw the map in Heart of the Jungle.\"\n\nBobROE RPG Superstar 2013 Top 32\n\nI have a question about the other castaways boons.

The ship has spent 71 days at sea and 33 days at the 10 ports along the way (104 days total). They were only a day or two out of Eldedar when they wrecked.\n\nJames Jacobs Creative Director\n\nBobROE wrote:\n\nI have a question about the other castaways boons.

So, all of those images you lifted from the module (including your modified hex maps of Smuggler's Shiv) are a no-no according to Paizo's Community Use Policy.\n\nVery nice work though!\n\n1 to 50 of 509 << first < prev | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | next > last >>\n\nCommunity / Forums / Pathfinder / Pathfinder Adventure Path / Serpent's Skull / Souls for Smuggler's Shiv (GM Reference) All Messageboards\n\nWant to post a reply?
