        "text": "The quest will be a sort of \"bounty-ish\", \"cat-and-mouse\" chase/hunt mission (or a Mad Max Fury Road chase if you like that metaphor better), where all the other ships (if they want to) on the server/map will be searching/hunting for one sloop (willingly player(s) and not npc) that contains a precious diamond (worth about 10 000 gold, that it’s trying to deliver across the map - in other words a long distance, with a huge chance to encounter other ships, that will try and stop it and steal the diamond).\n\nDescription of the quest:\n\nThe quest is just obtainable by finding it in a \"message in a bottle\" and by sloops only (because this quest will probably be too easy to complete for a galleon because of their speed), where one will find a map of an big outskirt island (smugglers bay, marauders arch, old faithful isle, kraken’s fall, devil’s ridge, thieves haven, discovery ridge, crescent isle or mermaid’s hideaway) with a diamond marker (instead of a X marker). If one then goes to this outskirt island (as instructed, and preferably one that you are currently closest too), one will find a castaway pirate (which wrote the message in the bottle) at the diamond marker. The castaway pirate tells you that he has been hiding on the island for many years with a precious treasure (a diamond which is “bright as a thousand star” and can be seen at both night and day - in the same manners as you spot a “message in a bottle” on the beach), which he is willing to share with you if you deliver it to an island of his choosing (randomly chooses one of the small outskirts islands that is farthest away from the island he currently is on (if picked up at i.e. smugglers bay, then the diamond has to be delivered to either one of these islands (not a choice but randomly chosen by the game in advance); Mutineer Rock, Booty Isle or Lookout Point). Delivering to outposts will probably make it too easy for other players to guess which outpost the diamond is going to be delivered to (since there are so few outposts), and therefore will possibly be camping there – the battle for the treasure needs in other words to happen on the sea, because it will be too difficult to determine where the diamond is supposed to be delivered.\n\nThe castaway is not willingly to physically let go of the diamond, and he has also lost both his legs (when the ship went down) so you have to carry him with you (while he always clings on to the diamond). He has also forgotten the name of the island, but knows the shape of it, in the same way as some gold hoarder quests (this is to prevent enemies to just run onto the boat and quickly find out where the sloop is delivering the diamond - before possibly getting killed - and camping on that island awaiting the diamond to be delivered there).\n\nHow the mechanics of the quest would work:\n\nThis quest is only attainable when the server/map is full or nearly full (so the quest won’t be too easy to complete). The quest starts when you accept the mission from the castaway pirate, and thus you can scout on forehand to see if the coast is clear (literally),and choose when it is best to accept the mission and set sail. Because at the same moment you accept it, all the players on the server/map will be informed by a message on the screen (i.e. “there are rumors of a precious treasure travelling the seas”). This message will stay on the screen (will minimize to a small recognizable icon after a minute or so – and can be shown again by going into the menu or something similar), as long as the diamond is still not delivered. And when this quest is active, other players will be able to intervene and steal this diamond (with the castaway pirate at the same time, as he will not let go of the diamond), and deliver it themselves. One can always get the information of the delivery destination from the castaway pirate (he shows a drawing of the island).\n\nThe diamond shines brightly (both night and day) and will be able to be spotted by other ships from a great distance. In other words; If they can see the ship they can also see if it contains the diamond. It will shine in the same manners as a “message in a bottle”/spyglass (but much brighter, so it's not difficult to distinguish those two), even when under deck, so there is no possibility to hide it on ones ship without other players able to see it. The only way to hide the diamond is by holding it (and the castaway pirate that clings to it) under water (it will float up to the surface if no one is physically holding it down in the water, and much faster than a tresure chest would do), or when the diamond is behind islands or waves (i.e. in a storm) or physical objects on an island, so there is a possibility to hide in these places while awaiting the heat to die down/ships to sail away.\n\nThe diamond will shine more frequently the closer one gets to the diamond, so one have a possibility to jump out in the sea (and hope the sharks leave one alone) immediately as one see a boat in the distance, thus preventing the enemy ship to see that you are carrying the diamond on your boat.\n\nThe Diamond is worth about 10000 gold, so it will be worth taking the risk to deliver it, or hunt for it.\n\nWhen you are getting close to the island you’re supposed to deliver the diamond at (and the castaway pirate), there will spawn a pirate (friend of the castaway pirate) to receive the diamond and pay you the 10000 gold. This is to prevent other players accidentally or intentionally finding him before the diamond is delivered, and just be camping there until it does.\n\nAnd that’s it! Hope I have explained this quest adequately and coherently enough, so people understands how it works. Please vote if you like the idea, and reply to bump the topic, and perhaps Rare will take notice then! Also, if you see any weaknesses with this idea, please let me know and preferably suggest a solution if you have any. As this idea is now, I think Rare easily could implement it in a weekly patch, and not with a “huge content update” (many months away), since the idea involves more or less already existing mechanichs (at least it appears that way to me, but I could be wrong, since I don't really know anything about programming games).\n\n@loopct said in Please add a \"Mad Max Fury Road\"-type quest!:\n\nNice idea, the reward price may need to be adjusted once it has been played a while and we see how challenging it really is.\n\nAs an opposing ship, would we have any clues as to where the diamond currently is if it is not visible within eyesight distance? Otherwise it might be difficult for ships to find it considering it could be anywhere out there... maybe the ships map could show an indicator of where it was picked up once the mission has commenced, or a “last spotted here” marker that showed where it was maybe 2 minutes ago. This would make for some more strategy on what course you would need to take, as going strait for the destination would be a givaway for waiting pirates.\n\nI agree with a possible adjustment of the reward price (after seeing how this quest plays out - if it's easy or difficult to complete), but I also think it's important that the reward should be high enough to entice players to undertake this quest, and also to entice other players to bother looking for this smuggler ship. Because if the reward is to low, than players probably won't undertake this quest at all (especially those who prefer PvE - mostly sloops - and then most likely will hesitate to do a quest that is more or less putting them in the center of a potentially huge PvP chase/hunt). And this is the most important aspect of the quest's viablity; enticing players to undertake the quest, and that's why I also think it is important to give the smuggler the upperhand. In my opinion it should be easier to smuggle the diamond, than it is to hunt the smuggler down (which would involve a bit of luck of being at the right place at the right time, but also being in a galleon with a speed advantage and more scouting eyes), which is why I don't think a marker is a good idea. I have pondered this idea myself, but I was thinking more of a marker in form of a \"silverlining/ray of light\" that marks the island where the diamond was picked up, for everyone on the map to see (where one can't see exactly which island when you're far away, but just the general direction - in the same manners as skeleton fort raid events), but I was afraid that would make the delivery destination to easy to calculate for the hunters. Maybe you're idea; a \"last spotted marker\"would work better in that regard, but I think the best is to not have any markers of any sorts, because as I've already said; the most important thing is to entice players to undertake this quest. I will also say that the smugglers experience is the most important under this quest (the tensionfilled sailing with a precious cargo, while always scanning the horizon for ships, hiding behind islands etc.) For the other players on the map it will only be a little bonus excitement on top of what they already are doing. They will have the option of either go actively out and search for the smuggler, or just be lucky and spot the smuggler while doing another quest.\n\nI have been taking some test-sails across the map by the way, just to test out how many ships I would encounter in a potential smuggle quest. And I always encounter a couple of ships (mostly sloops), but this vary, and it's the reason why I said in my first post that the server should be full or nearly full before this quest is available to undertake, and perhaps there should be at least two or three galleons on the server, because only galleons are really able to stop the smuggler (because of their speed). The sloop is only able to stop the smuggler with some good navigating or predictions of the smugglers route - or if they are lucky and a galleon pressures the smuggler to take another route which cross theirs.\n\nOne good strategy for hunters is to patrol the middle of the map under this quest, because all the routes (at least the shortest routes) will go across this area. So the hunters will know that their best chance of getting a smuggler is to patrol the middle of the map when the event is taking place. But this is not a guarantee, because the smuggler can always decide to take a longer route - like for example going around the whole map - but this is not neccessarily a bulletproof decision for the smuggler either, because the smuggler can always encounter ships that aren't watching the middle of the map. And if the smuggler decides to take the long route, then perhaps he/she deserves the reward for the long travel and time put in (which also will most likely contain a lot of tension, and second guessing his or her decision to take the long route, because if they should lose the treasure after a extra long and time-consuming travel, then it will possible sting even more...)\n\nIf players on galleons think it is unfair that they cannot do this quest or feel left out because the smuggler has a potential upperhand (in the form of no one knowing where he or she is, or is going), and it is perhaps difficult to find the smuggler, than it's not worse than picking up a sloop the next time and try the quest from the smugglers point of view. But I also genuinely think this quest will bring the potential hunters some excitement also. For people that play Diablo 3, I would describe the spotting of a smuggler ship as something similar as finding a treasure goblin in Diablo 3, which is not often, but when it happens it is always exciting, even though you don't always manage to kill it and get all of it's treasure. But failing to kill the treasure goblin doesn't stop you from playing Diablo 3 alltogether, it just make you keep a better lookout for it the next time, and ponder a better plan on how to take it out - all while you keep playing the regular gameplay. And I would say the same for this quest in Sea of Thieves. It is just a little bonus quest to spice up the world and grinding of Sea of Thieves, and the more varied quests we have the more exciting it will be to play Sea of Thieves, at least that is what I think.\n\nDoes no one like this idea? (considering only 2 upvotes out of 82 views) Or is it just too much to read?\n\nBy the way; I maybe think that this quest would be more feasible when they introduce the three-man ship (which I suppose is faster than the sloop?) and the cursed cannonballs (which allegedly can make the anchor drop down or sail go up when hitting a ship), which can make it a bit easier for the hunters to stop the smuggler when they come across it.\n\nJust had another idea at the top of my head now (so it may not be any good). What if other ships become equipped with some kind of flaregun (or that time period's equivalent - fireworks?) when the quest is active, which they can fire up to signal other ships the whereabouts of the smuggler (sort of same way as in Mad Max Fury road when Immortan Joe/War Boys signals the Bulletfarm and Gas Town for help).\n\nThis is of course optional, and probably is something only sloops would benefit from because they need the help from other ships to pressure the smuggler off course or similar, to have any hope of catching up with it (or just damn good sail work/cursed cannonballs). This firework will no doubt be misused (for example to trick people), and I don't know if this would be a bad thing or a good thing (perhaps it should be a maximum of one firework/flaregun per ship, or only sloops should be equipped with it?).\n\nWhat do you think? Any feedback is much appreciated, to help me improve this idea. It will also make it easier for Rare to implement this idea, if we (the players) has already done the groundwork for them. That is, if you actually think this quest belongs in Sea of Thieves. At least I don't see the harm of having such a quest in the game, because players still have the option to undertake it or not. Or am I missing something? Will this quest in fact affect the Sea of Thieves universe negatively? Commence debate!\n\nHow many ships is it per server? Have read that it is maximum of 6 ships per server. Is that correct?\n\nBecause that is maybe to few to make this quest feasible, or is it? (I'm not sure)\n\nOnly 5 ships to hunt 1 ship down will perhaps make it a bit to easy for the smuggler, especially if a majority of these 5 hunters are sloops.\n\nSo in light of that, the hunter should be given something that will make the hunt a bit easier, for example a flaregun/firework (as mentioned in an earlier post) to signal other ships the whereabouts of the smuggler (also the smuggler should be equipped with this, so they also can signal other ship as a last \"F*\" in the event of someone stealing their diamond).\n\nThis will of course make the competition more fierce for the battle of the diamond (in the case of the smuggler being sunk/killed by multiple ships), but this is probably the only way to stop the smuggler (especially for sloops).\n\nOr instead of flareguns/firework to make it easier for the hunters, then maybe the ship (that being both sloops or galleons, where the latter is the result of it having stoled the diamond from the original smuggler, which always should be a sloop) that carries the diamond should be slowed down some? To make it easier for other ships to catch up with it, so the smuggler has to be a bit careful not to be spotted.\n\nAny other ideas?\n\nEither way I think this whole quest idea has to be put on ice until Rare introduce the three-man ship, so we can see what that's all about. Is it faster than sloops? If yes, then there is probably no reason to put a speed penalty on the smuggler, because then it is a bigger chance of there being a lot of fast hunters that can catch up with the smuggler-sloop anyway.\n\nThen flareguns/fireworks is probably the better way to go, which most likely will demand more time and resources to implement in the game.\n\nSo in other words; not a easy quest to implement any longer (or maybe never was? What do I know... I'm just a simple man that likes to play Sea of Thieves in my free time)"
