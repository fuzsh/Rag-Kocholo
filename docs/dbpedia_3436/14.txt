“I’m worried about integrity,” the quizmaster Brydon moans to the producer of his fictional panel show, which steals shamelessly from Have I Got News For You. “It’s a panel show,” comes the reply.

“You leave your integrity at the door.” Cutting, Larry Sanders-style, between the show and backstage, Annually Retentive provides the perfect platform for Brydon, playing a demonic version of himself, to mimic (often hilariously) and abuse (often brutally) his guests. It’s a bit of fun, the real Brydon has insisted. But tell that to Dominik Diamond, whose appearance on the show is described as “a new low”.
