        "text": "Jane Moore has no plans to leave 'Loose Women'.\n\nThe 61-year-old journalist appeared on the very first episode of the ITV1 lunchtime chat show in 1999 and stayed with the programme until 2002 but returned full-time just over a decade ago and even though she has not been seen on-screen since the end of last year, insisted that she is still a part of the series.\n\nAsked if she had any plans to leave the show, she told this week's edition of Woman's Own magazine: \"No, no, I'll definitely stay there. I've had a couple of months off because I've got so much other work on and I've just been on tour with Sharon Osbourne. I've had a holiday and I'll be back to Loose Women on 1 March.\"\n\nThe Sun columnist also added that she gets along with all of her co-stars, but is \"particularly close\" to the ones she has appeared on the programme with for a considerable amount of time, including the likes of singer Coleen Nolan, former 'EastEnders' actress Nadia Sawalha and broadcast legend Janet Street-Porter.\n\nShe said: \"To be honest, [I get along] with all of them. I had lunch with Nadia ]today, and Kaye came to stay with me last week. Plus, I was just speaking to Janet on my way here, and Coleen.\n\n\"The ones I'm particularly closest to are the ones who have been there the longest, but I like and get on with everyone.\"\n\nMeanwhile, last year Jane announced that she and her husband Gary Farrow had parted ways after more than 20 years of marriage but insisted that she has no plans to start dating again.\n\nAsked about the potential of finding someone new, she said: \"Oh no, absolutely not! Well, I've only just got divorced, and I'm very much of the mind that you don't have to be dating somebody to have a nice life.\""
