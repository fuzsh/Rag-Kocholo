        "text": "Loose Women's Jane Moore had a star turn recently, appearing on stage in the iconic West End musical Mamma Mia and the pictures are brilliant!\n\nJane treated us on Instagram to shots of her in a spectacular Abba style catsuit, lots of backstage shots and even a little clip of her on stage as as wedding guest taking a bow.\n\nShe wrote in the caption: \"So…I can’t quite believe that I’m saying this but, a couple of weeks ago I got the chance to appear on stage at London’s Novello Theatre in the smash hit @mammamiamusical as part of a film for @loosewomen\"\n\nSwiping through they just keep getting better!\n\nJane was singing the cast and crew's praises, continuing; \"The hugely talented cast were so kind to me and dealt admirably with my amateurish efforts, and everyone backstage was an absolute delight too. A huge thank you to them all, but in particular the spectacularly good @mazzmurray who plays Donna, producer @judycraymer for organising and authorising my fun night out and the Loose Women team for editing it so well.\"\n\nThe segment appeared on Loose Women on Tuesday (17 November) and Jane hopes it will encourage people to go and see the fabulous show, telling fans and followers; \"It was an absolute blast. To anyone who hasn’t seen the show, I can’t recommend it highly enough and, to anyone who has been before, well, you know what I’m talking about! Maybe this will make you want to go again. Anyone who missed my, ahem, star performance on today’s show can catch it on @itv hub #mammamia #novellotheatre #abba \""
