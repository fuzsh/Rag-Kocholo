        "text": "Will the real Rob Brydon please stand up? Or sit down, that's fine, because we're in a posh London hotel, having tea. The man opposite looks like Rob Brydon, with a long face and sad eyes, comic, but melancholic, too, in a Stan Laurel kind of way. But then his whole face will spring into action, and suddenly he'll turn into someone else, with someone else's voice. He's Al Pacino, then Harold Pinter, a jilted Swansea minicab driver, Steve Coogan, a photographer, Barry Humphries, a cockney London cabbie, a sing-song Welsh hill farmer. Now he's being Rob Brydon... but is this the real Rob Brydon, or the fictional character called Rob Brydon (played by the real Brydon) in his satirical show-within-a-show TV programme?\n\nRob Brydon's Annually Retentive is about a rubbish topical quiz show in which teams of (real) second-rate celebrities have to answer questions about a random year in history. The host of the show (Rob Brydon, played by Rob Brydon - keep up) is an insecure, nasty, narcissistic egomaniac. So how much of that is in the man opposite? \"It's all just exaggerated,\" he says. \"I suppose I have the seeds of all those things - in the programme I'm very insecure, I'm very vain, quite arrogant... yeah, I've probably got all that in me, probably more than I like to admit, and I think... Robert Carlyle, Robert Carlyle, Robert Carlyle, Robert Carlyle. BLOO-DY HELL!\"\n\nEh? Oh, I see: Robert Carlyle, the actor, is walking past in the street outside and Brydon seems genuinely impressed, star-struck even. We get distracted and talk about Carlyle for a minute (\"Now he's a good actor... no, never met him... I've met some Scottish actors...\") before getting back to Brydon. I point out that another character called Rob Brydon, played by the real Rob Brydon, in Michael Winterbottom's film A Cock And Bull Story, also shares that combination of vanity and insecurity. \"So it must be me,\" he sighs. \"And it is in me, yeah, but I hope not as much. What do I care if it is? I get so defensive... Can't you ask me what my favourite albums are, something like that?\"\n\nOur conversation starts a little frostily. Brydon doesn't want to sit at the first table we come to because it's too near other people who might listen in, so we move to a quieter place by the window. He seems dead wary, almost as if he's expecting some kind of stitch-up, and often says things along the lines of, \"Oh God, that's going to look awful in print.\" I ask if he hates doing interviews. \"Initially, it's an ego boost - unless you're of far more moral substance than I am. But the more you do, you just feel like an arse really... Want a few impressions? I can do that for you.\"\n\nAl Pacino then. \"[As Al Pacino] Yeah, I do, Al. That's 'cos I love Al Pacino, that's why.\"\n\nAgain we seem to have drifted away from the subject of Rob Brydon. As the interview goes on, though, and the tea goes down (actually, he has a Diet Coke), he thaws. And we get back to him. He was born in Baglan near Port Talbot nearly 42 years ago. I ask for a potted version of his life, without the boring bits, just the interesting stuff like girls. \"Girls... oh God.\" And losing his virginity. \"Bugger off! I'm not telling you that. I don't do that sort of thing.\"\n\nGirls, then. \"Oh, I was a non-starter with girls. I had very bad acne. Very bad acne. See the scars?\" He holds his face up to the light. Actually, I think the scars are worse on TV than in natural light.\n\nDid acne affect him in a big way? \"Well, yeah. Against that, what I did have was I always had an ability to be funny. I always played the lead in the big school musical, so I always had an outlet, a voice, it didn't make me go into myself. But it didn't make me... you don't have a lot of confidence with girls.\"\n\nDid being funny come out of that? \"No, no, no, it was before that.\"\n\nHe was funny before the spots? \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, I was always... yes. Erm, by... when you say funny... if you mean... what I mean by that is I had... no, no, no... I mean I had an interest in humour that was above and beyond just watching a show and laughing at it.\"\n\nHe seems to have gone shy about being funny. I say the reason I asked if being funny had come out of that... \"Because you would think so,\" he interrupts. \"The assumption is that it's a defence mechanism.\"\n\nBut humour can come out of adversity? \"Of course. More often than not.\"\n\nDoes his, sometimes?\n\n\"Yeah, yeah. I mean, in this series of Annually Retentive there's a whole episode where I'm worried about losing my hair. Now I am losing my hair. [He leans forward to show me.] That is adversity of sorts, and humour comes from that.\"\n\nHe's still got more than Gail Porter has (this is, admittedly, an unbelievably insensitive thing to say, but in my defence I am quoting Rob Brydon, the character, who said something along those lines when Porter appeared on the show).\n\n\"Oh yeah, we did do that. So, for example, you ask if I'm like the person in the show, I mean I would never be so crass.\"\n\nIs it not just having an alter ego to hide behind, a device for getting away with stuff that he wouldn't otherwise be able to say? \"Yeah, yeah, definitely. That's all part of it. It's quite complicated. I suppose you just look at a situation and think: how would this character behave? Or how would Keith Barret [Brydon's most celebrated character, the tragic, jilted minicab driver in Marion & Geoff] behave?\"\n\nAnd suddenly he's turned into Keith - innocent, naive, nice, eternally optimistic, very tragic, very Welsh - reacting to Gail Porter's alopecia: \"If anything it's better than having hair, isn't it? She's lucky, I feel awful with all this hair.\"\n\nMarion & Geoff was the show that pulled Brydon from the relative obscurity of doing commercial voice-overs (for Toilet Duck and Tango, among other things) and Welsh radio. They started as simple, 10...minute monologues, in which the only character we see, Keith, a minicab driver, narrates the story of his marriage break-up (Marion is his wife, Geoff her lover) without being aware what's really going on. It's painful, and painfully funny, beautiful television, and it's still the work Brydon is most proud of.\n\nDoggedly not giving up on the comedy-out-of-adversity thing, I suggest that Brydon wasn't happy himself at that time. \"In what sense?\" he asks, suspiciously. \"Which area of misery are you pointing at?\" I'm pointing at the fact that he was going through a marriage break-up himself. \"Oh good Lord,\" he says, a bit crossly. Then he adopts Keith's accent. \"What you're doing there is a bit like your earlier assumption that terrible acne leads one to become a comedian. Understandable, looks nice in your article, but I'm afraid not accurate.\"\n\nIs it a chronology problem again? \"Yes, it is.\"\n\nWas his marriage break-up after Marion & Geoff, then? \"Well, I don't really talk about this.\"\n\nBut he can say when it was? \"It was written and filmed while I was still with my wife. And the only thing I'll say is that the circumstances in Marion & Geoff were not my circumstances. You make your own assumptions. Only because it's so ungainly to discuss it, and there are children involved.\"\n\nIf he seems cross for a second, he's soon over it, and then goes further, sees it from my point of view. \"Yes, of course it's interesting. If I were you... I mean, a guy does a show about divorce, and he gets divorced. I appreciate that. But then you should also appreciate there are many different types of divorce.\"\n\nBrydon does that a lot, says what he thinks, then immediately sees it from the opposite point of view as well - no, you're wrong, but I can quite see why you think that, I probably would myself.\n\nHe's now married again, to a television producer, but doesn't want to talk about that either, though he does admit that she's blond.\n\nSo we talk about other things. Like being Welsh - something he's very proud of. \"I meet a lot of Welsh people who have a [adopts extra-Welsh sing-song voice] very flowery language with a wonderful expediency of words, you know. There is a natural drama to the Welsh, and I think there are parallels with Jewish people. I've always liked Jewish humour.\"\n\nWe talk about status and escalators. I want to know if he's on the up one or the down one. \"I think I'm probably on one of those Heathrow walkways, just going along like that, and that's OK.\"\n\nHe won't tell me how much he charges for corporate speaking, but he's happy to discuss how he twice beat Steve Coogan in the Top Gear star-in-a-car challenge, though he then points out that he's Coogan's biggest fan. Brydon's now totally defrosted. \"We're having a lovely chat,\" he says, slightly Keith Barret, but then he probably is slightly Keith Barret. \"We've warmed to each other... well, I won't know whether you have until I read the piece.\"\n\nHe thinks about telling me an amusing anecdote, then has second thoughts. \"I was going to tell you a story then, but I thought it would look so wanky in print...\" Oh, go on. He relents. So, we're in the life-story bit, and he was trying to get into Rada. As part of the audition he had to do something modern. \"So I did a piece of Pinter from The Homecoming. I now look back on it, and it was a piece laden with a kind of sexual menace. And I was this 16-year-old virgin with no idea, didn't understand it really at all. I did it like an evil Del Boy. And, no, I didn't get in.\n\nAnyway, many years later, Brydon, now established (on the Heathrow travelator, anyway) was in a restaurant with some friends and Pinter was at the next table. Brydon's friends knew Pinter, got chatting, about different kinds of laughter and stuff, as you do when famous playwrights are at the next table, and Brydon chipped in with his thoughts, which Pinter seemed to appreciate. \"So, emboldened by his positive response, I thought, I'm not going to waste my moment here with Pinter, I'm going to push the envelope. So I said [adopting distinguished, talking-to-Pinter voice], 'When I auditioned for Rada in 1983, I did a speech from The Homecoming.' He must get this all the time. And I said, 'I didn't get in.' He said: [adopting Pinter voice] 'Oh.' And I said, 'And I can't help thinking that if you'd tried a little harder with the writing, it would have been a different story!' And there was this silence. I thought, 'Oh, you idiot'. And then he went [adopting Pinter laugh], 'Ha ha ha.' And he seemed to genuinely laugh.\"\n\nAnd I'm laughing, too. Because Rob Brydon is genuinely funny. Whoever he is."
