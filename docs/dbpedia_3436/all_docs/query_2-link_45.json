        "text": "A Memorial Service for Dr. Jane B. Moore, a Keeper of the Auburn Spirit, will be Friday, July 16, at 2 p.m. at the Auburn First Baptist Church, with visitation immediately following.\n\nA graduate of the University of Alabama, Jane Moore came to symbolize all that is good and true about Auburn and the Auburn Spirit. She exhibited Auburn's belief in the Human Touch as much as anyone who has ever held a leadership position at Auburn University.\n\nShe was a much beloved member of her family, her church, her community, and her university. Her quick smile, her gentle laugh, her loving care and concern, and her wry sense of humor endeared her to all she met. A stranger was a friend she had not yet met.\n\nJane was a pioneer at Auburn. She was the first woman appointed to the Faculty Athletics Committee and later served as Faculty Chair of Athletics, a role the beloved Cliff Hare (Jordan-Hare Stadium) held for many years. Like Hare, she, too, had an athletics facility named in her honor, the Jane B. Moore Softball field.\n\nDr. Moore made significant professional contributions to Auburn University over a 28-year career on the faculty of the College of Education and the Department of Health and Human Performance, now the School of Kinesiology. A pioneering researcher in motor development, her academic work advanced the understanding of how children move and learn to move.\n\nBorn in 1935, Jane began her education in her beloved Dozier, AL, graduating from Dozier High School 1953. She earned an undergraduate degree from Judson College and then went on to earn a Master's Degree from the University of Tennessee. Her first teaching position was at Livingston State University, while there she continued her education at the University of Alabama in the Doctoral Program. Jane came to Auburn in 1969 after earning her Doctorate in Physical Education from the University of Alabama.\n\nShe was the cousin of the late Mal Moore, former Athletics Director at the University of Alabama. During their working years, the relationships between their respective institutions were at an all-time high. She also served on the Executive Committee of the Southeastern Conference and numerous NCAA committees.\n\nHer service to Auburn has been recognized with the Algernon Sydney Sullivan Award and the Pam Sheffield Award which recognizes Auburn women who exemplify grace, character, selfless service and commitment to Auburn students, faculty, alumni, and staff. The Auburn Alumni Association recognized her with their highest honor, the Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nShe is preceded in death by Tolbert and Evelyn Moore. She is survived by friend, Dr. Virginia Hayes, and brother-like cousin Dr. Conrad Merrill and cousin & caregiver Suzanne Zorn Boyington and a world of other cousins and friends. Appreciation is expressed for dedicated caregivers Melissa Huguley, Christela Dumas and Mary Melton and many helpful friends.\n\nMemorial gifts may be made to the scholarship named for her mother, the Evelyn Moore Endowment, at the Auburn University Foundation, or the Community Market of the Food Bank of East Alabama.\n\nA graveside service will be held Saturday, July 17, 2pm in Zion Cemetery, Leon Tower Rd., Dozier, AL."
