        "text": "Sun columnist Jane Moore has hit the big time – the blonde bombshell's 2003 novel, The Ex Files, has been optioned by Hollywood. Producer Leonard Goldberg, the movie mogul behind hits including Charlie's Angels and Sleeping with the Enemy is a fan of the book, which will be made by CBS Films – the movie arm of the US broadcasting giant. Set at a wedding that goes horribly wrong when the bride and groom decide to invite a series of ex-partners to their big day, it sounds like the perfect vehicle for Jennifer Aniston or Sandra Bullock. CBS is dropping the \"files\" from the title, presumably to avoid giving false hope to fans of Mulder and Scully, and calling it, simply, \"The Exes\". It seems the narrow streets of Wapping are just a short hop away from LA's boulevard of dreams. See you on the red carpet, Ms Moore."
