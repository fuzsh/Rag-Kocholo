        "text": "Ed.D., The University of Alabama, 1969. Physical Education.\n\nM.S., University of Tennessee, 1958. Physical Education.\n\nB.A., Judson College, 1957. Physical Education.\n\nDr. Jane B. Moore grew up in Dozier, Alabama, and graduated from Dozier High School in 1953. In 1969, she received the Ed.D. from The University of Alabama in physical education. Prior to 1969, her teaching career included Judson College, Auburn University, Livingston State University (now University of West Alabama) and teaching assistantships at the University of Tennessee and The University of Alabama.\n\nJane joined the Auburn University faculty in the Department of Health and Human Performance (now, School of Kinesiology) in 1969. Her area of specialization was physical education and motor development for young children. She loved teaching and enjoyed her students who were majoring in physical education, elementary physical education, early childhood education, child development, or special education. Her students were eager to learn and to develop useful strategies related to their curriculum requirements and career paths. Her goal was to provide meaningful and useful class assignments and experiences so that ultimately they would become competent and committed professionals in teaching or related areas. As an example of her effort to blend the practical with the theoretical in her teaching, she established the Kindergarten Motor Development Program in cooperation with the Auburn City School System. This venture was a one-of-a-kind testing and remediation program for young children who were behind in their early motor skills and provided practical experience for Auburn University students enrolled in her classes.\n\nIn addition to teaching courses and serving on master’s and doctoral student committees, Jane served regularly on departmental, college, and university committees. One of her most meaningful assignments was her appointment in 1975 by the Auburn University President as the first woman to serve on the Auburn University Committee on Intercollegiate Athletics. For over 20 years she had the opportunity to work with university administrators, faculty, student leaders, and athletics department personnel in the development of policies, procedures, and programs. She takes pride in Auburn’s strong athletics programs and still enjoys a special connection because of her work with athletics. Her role as Faculty Athletics Representative included work with the university president, athletics director, and faculty to promote institutional control, academic integrity, and to enhance students’ athletic experience.\n\nFrom 1996 – 1997, Dr. Moore served as program assistant for preparation of Auburn’s first NCAA Division I program certification self-study and also for the Interim report in 2001. She served on the Peer Review Committee for NCAA Program Certification for more than twelve Division I colleges and universities.\n\nIn 2006, Jane served on the steering committee for the Celebration of Women’s Sports hosted by the Athletics Department. Former women athletes and coaches from all sports were recognized with team reunions and meaningful weekend activities. Throughout her career, Jane has been a firm and effective proponent of women’s athletics. She is a charter member of WINGS: Women Inspiring and Nurturing Greatness in Student-Athletes, an organization for women’s sports in the Department of Athletics. She is a current member of the Strategic Advisory Committee in the Auburn Department of Athletics.\n\nDr. Moore was honored in 1995 as the recipient of the Pam Sheffield Award, which recognizes an Auburn woman each year as one “who best embodies selfless service and a commitment to Auburn University and the Auburn Family.” In 1997, she received the Algernon Sydney Sullivan Award, which recognizes individuals for outstanding nobility of character and for service to others. In 2003, the field of the Auburn Softball Complex was named the Jane B. Moore Field to honor her long-time service to Auburn athletics. In 2003, she was selected by The Judson College Alumnae Association for the annual Outstanding Alumna Award.\n\nJane has supported the philanthropic efforts of Auburn University through membership in the College of Education Patrons of the Keystone Dean’s Circle, as a member of the Auburn Development Leadership Team for the College of Education, and as a member of the Philanthropy Board of the College of Human Sciences. In 2009, she established the Evelyn Moore Scholarship in the Auburn University College of Education in memory of her mother who was a beloved house mother for Dorm 3 Willie Little Hall, Auburn University.\n\nDr. Moore is well known and respected for her many years of service to the Auburn Community and beyond through her repeated appointments to the Credit Committee of the Auburn University Federal Credit Union, as a Board Member of the East Alabama Medical Center Foundation and a member of the Institutional Review Board of the East Alabama Medical Center, as a Board Member of the Alabama School of Fine Arts, as a member of the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame Selection Committee, as a Board Member of Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Lee County, as a Trustee and member of the Child Development Center Committee of Auburn First Baptist Church, and as a weekly volunteer for the Food Bank of East Alabama Community Market.\n\nDr. Moore was a recipient in 2016 of The Lifetime Achievement Award, which is sponsored by the Auburn Alumni Association. This award was established to recognize extraordinary accomplishments by members of the Auburn family and is the highest honor bestowed by the Auburn Alumni Association."
