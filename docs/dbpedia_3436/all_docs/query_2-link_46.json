        "text": "Full Member\n\nBiography\n\nIn my horticultural career I have been a Head Gardener at an Abbey, a writer on trade and consumer gardening magazines, a researcher on BBC gardening programmes and a TV presenter. Gardening and writing about gardening have been my whole career. I have a wide ranging practical experience, a broad plant knowledge and an unswerving enthusiasm for my chosen career. I'm an award winning communicator, working for the BBC, IPC magazines, Carlton TV and other media organisations. My awards range from a Chelsea Flower Show medal, an R&C Garden Trophy, to Journalist, Broadcaster, Columnist and Practical Journalist of the Year awards from the GMG.\n\nAdditional Interests\n\nI can write and speak about anything from taking cuttings to parks management, top trees for small gardens to how to create a functioning meadowland habitat. My interests are wide ranging, and my media work is backed by my long and successful career as a hands on head gardener.\n\nTalks"
