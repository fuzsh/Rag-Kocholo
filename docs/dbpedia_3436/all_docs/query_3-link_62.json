        "text": "After studying at the Welsh College of Music and Drama he took a job broadcasting on BBC Radio Wales and there created a string of amusing characters out of which grew the blueprint for his ingenious comedy Marion and Geoff.\n\nFor a while he became prolific as a voiceover artist both for a host of adverts and as a continuity announcer for BBC One, but it was the broadcast of six ten-minute episodes of Marion and Geoff in 2000 that was to ignite his comedy career, bringing to audiences the tragically comic thoughts of cab driver Keith Barrett.\n\nThe same year Brydon wrote and co-starred with Julia Davis in Human Remains and both shows won a clutch of awards before Brydon himself won Best Comedy Actor at the 2001 British Comedy Awards.\n\nHe returned as his alter ego Keith both in a full-length series and feature-length finale of Marion and Geoff, and again later as host of spoof chat vehicle The Keith Barrett Show.\n\nAs well as starring in BBC TWO sitcom Supernova, Brydon has since fronted innovative comedies including short-lived DVD spoof Director's Commentary (ITV) and fake panel game Annually Retentive on BBC Three.\n\nA keen movie buff, he has lately moved into film acting, with a scene-stealing role alongside Steve Coogan in Peter Winterbottom's acclaimed A Cock and Bull Story."
