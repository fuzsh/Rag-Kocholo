        "text": "When I was a Carleton student in the mid-1980s, Andrea Iseminger was the Off-Campus Studies director and Mary Zeman was the office’s administrative assistant. The office was located on the first floor of Laird, with the Career Center just a door away. I was lucky enough to be hired, in satisfaction of a portion of my student employment contract, in the Off-Campus Studies office.\n\nInitially, the idea of having the entire globe accessible was a bit overwhelming. Students were making appointments with Andrea to study in Zimbabwe, India, France, Nepal, you name it. Andrea was supportive of each student’s exploration, and Mary Zeman was a positive, friendly person; it was always a pleasure to report to work there, and kind of exciting, as well.\n\nEventually, I signed on to my own program — a fall term (1985) German language-focused program based in Trier, West Germany, led by Herr Cantwell. The group of students with whom I traveled and studied was remarkably fun, resilient and adventuresome. During our time abroad, we spent one week in West Berlin — and one memorable, rather scary day in East Berlin.\n\nPassing through Checkpoint Charlie was a poignant and somewhat chilling experience, with relatives on the east side crying as they bid farewell to those heading back to the west. Oddly, moving from West Berlin to East Berlin was like the difference between viewing colored and black-and-white TV, with everything in East Berlin seeming gray, old and tired. The efforts at propaganda were flagrant and useless, but I felt like I dared not breathe out of turn that day lest I be “dealt with.”\n\nWe also had a bizarre nighttime train ride into West Berlin, with the train suddenly, screechingly, inexplicably braking shortly before we neared the city. We believe there may have been a person who committed suicide by throwing him/herself in front of the train, but I’m not positive we ever learned exactly what had transpired to cause our pause.\n\nThere are numerous other prized memories from that experience, but suffice to say my life has been richer for having had it. Additionally, I can never thank Andrea Iseminger enough for her mentorship and, later, friendship."
