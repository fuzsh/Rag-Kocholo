He played Dr Paul Hamilton in the Australian/British comedy series Supernova, Bryn West in the sitcom Gavin & Stacey and Keith Barret in the BBC comedy series Marion and Geoff and its spin-off The Keith Barret Show.\n\nContents\n\nBorn on christmas day the rob brydon show bbc two\n\nRob brydon the enttire delivery routine\n\nEarly life and studies\n\nCareer\n\nVoice over artist\n\nWriting breakthrough\n\nPanellistchairman\n\nStand up comedy\n\nPersonal life\n\nHonours and awards\n\nPolitical views\n\nFilmography\n\nReferences\n\nHe has appeared in a number of shows for the BBC with Steve Coogan, including The Trip series in 2010, released as a feature film later that year; and The Trip to Italy in 2014 and The Trip to Spain in 2017, also edited and released as feature films.\n\nSince 2009, Brydon has presented the BBC One comedy panel show Would I Lie to You? He played himself in Rob Brydon's Annually Retentive, a satirical series about a fictional panel show, which ran on BBC Three from 2006 until 2007. Between 2010 and 2012, Brydon presented his own BBC Two late-night chat show called The Rob Brydon Show. Since April 2014, Brydon has hosted the Saturday-night game show The Guess List for BBC One.\n\nRob brydon the enttire delivery routine\n\nEarly life and studies\n\nRobert Brydon Jones was born on 3 May 1965 in Baglan, Port Talbot (now the county borough of Neath Port Talbot), Wales. His mother, Joy Jones (n√©e Brydon), was a school teacher, and his father, Howard Jones, was a car dealer. He grew up in Baglan, with his younger brother Peter (born 1973).\n\nBrydon was educated at two independent schools: St. John's School in Porthcawl, which Eddie Izzard also attended, and Dumbarton House School in Swansea until the age of 14. This was followed by Porthcawl Comprehensive School, where he met Ruth Jones (with whom he later worked in Gavin and Stacey) and became a member of the school's youth theatre group. While at Dumbarton, he once stole the lunch money of fellow pupil Catherine Zeta-Jones (which he admitted while participating in a series 4 episode of Would I Lie To You?).\n\nBrydon has said that his primary childhood influences in comedy were Barry Humphries, Frankie Howerd and Woody Allen. He has also said that he used to memorise entire sketches by Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Peter Sellers.\n\nCareer\n\nBrydon attended the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama, Cardiff. He left after a year, to join Radio Wales at the age of 20. His early broadcasts included work as a disc jockey on BBC Radio Wales, when his Saturday morning shows included contributions from stand-up comedian Pete Park-Walker. Between 1992 and 1994, on Radio Wales (where he stayed for six years) he was the main presenter of Rave, one of BBC Radio 5's youth magazine and music programmes, with Alan Thompson. He developed his Marion and Geoff story from this.\n\nIn 1994 and 1995 Brydon appeared in numerous episodes of the original Radio Wales version of the cult comedy Satellite City with Boyd Clack. Although he has stayed with radio as a comedy performer on BBC Radio Five Live's The Treatment, Brydon also does occasional stints as a stand-in presenter on BBC Radio 2. He has stood in for Ken Bruce, one of the people whom he impersonates. On 1 April 2011 he appeared in Ken's place on his show as an April Fools' Day joke.\n\nBetween September and October 2011, Brydon starred alongside Sir Kenneth Branagh in Francis Veber's play The Painkiller at the Lyric Theatre in Belfast. He reprised his role with Branagh, in March and April 2016, at the Garrick Theatre in London's West End.\n\nVoice-over artist\n\nBrydon was first known nationally as a voice artist. He provided several voices for the Discworld computer games and continuity announcements for BBC 1. He is also known for voice-over work in television advertising, including for Renault, Tango, The Times, Tesco, Abbey National, Sainsbury's, McDonald's, Toilet Duck, Cahoot, Mint Card, Pot Noodle, Domino's Pizza, Crunchy Nut Cornflakes, The Observer and Fairy Liquid. He voiced the main character, Lewton, in the Discworld computer game Discworld Noir, and provided voices in animated films such as The Gruffalo, The Gruffalo's Child and Room on the Broom.\n\nWriting breakthrough\n\nFor a brief period in the early 1990s Brydon was a presenter for the Home Shopping Network. He began to find small roles in several successful films and television series. In 2000 he made his mark in television comedy, with two series which he co-wrote and performed for the BBC: Human Remains, co-written by Julia Davis; and the commercially successful Marion and Geoff.\n\nSince these series Brydon has developed a career path as a character actor, in both comedic and serious roles. He portrayed controversial theatre critic Kenneth Tynan in the BBC Four film Kenneth Tynan: In Praise of Hardcore (2005), opposite Julian Sands as Laurence Olivier.\n\nHis character Bryn West in Gavin and Stacey, written by Ruth Jones and James Corden, allowed him to return to his South Wales roots. In this role Brydon performed the 2009 Comic Relief charity single, \"(Barry) Islands in the Stream\", with Ruth Jones (both actors appearing as their characters from Gavin & Stacey) and singer Tom Jones. It reached No.1 in the UK singles chart on 15 March 2009.\n\nIn 2010 Brydon starred alongside Steve Coogan in Michael Winterbottom's partially improvised BBC Two sitcom series The Trip, in which both actors played fictionalized versions of their public personas (Brydon, optimistic and always ready to slip into an impression; and Coogan, misanthropic and angry not to be the major international star he believes he should be).\n\nBrydon's book Small Man in a Book (the title a play on his \"small-man-in-a-box\" impression) was published in November 2011.\n\nPanellist/chairman\n\nIn 2006 Brydon first appeared on the BBC Radio 4 comedy panel game I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue. His singing voice earned the unprecedented accolade from the erstwhile host, Humphrey Lyttelton, of being \"not bad\". When the team went on a tour of non-broadcast stage shows, Brydon filled in as chairman when Lyttelton was in hospital to repair an aortic aneurysm. Lyttelton died in hospital after surgery.\n\nIn February 2009, it was announced that Brydon would be one of three people to replace Lyttelton as chairman of the 51st series of I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue (the others being Stephen Fry and Jack Dee). Brydon also appeared as guest panellist in the first two episodes of series 52, chaired by Jack Dee. He returned as a guest panellist in the last two episodes of series 54 in January 2011.\n\nAdditionally, he took over in 2009 from Angus Deayton as host of Would I Lie To You?. Brydon has presented an episode of Have I Got News for You and has appeared on BBC Radio 4's panel game Just a Minute.\n\nBrydon narrated a two-part programme on BBC Radio 4, The Pain of Laughter: The Last Days of Kenneth Williams. It explored the latter part of Williams's life, featuring many of the performer's friends and contemporaries. In other radio work Brydon sat in for Ken Bruce on BBC Radio 2 for one day only on 25 August 2008. In addition to this, on 1 April 2011, Brydon impersonated Bruce for the entire two-hour and thirty minutes show. Bruce came on the air at the end of the show to reveal the prank.\n\nBrydon has appeared on the TV comedy quiz QI. In his first appearance (Series A, episode 5), his talent for mimicry was displayed with impressions of Sir Alec Guinness, James Dean, and Michael J. Fox. In the 2008 Christmas special, he provided impressions of Richard Burton and Sir Tom Jones.\n\nStand-up comedy\n\nIn 2009/10 Brydon had his first stand-up tour in the UK as Rob Brydon (rather than as a differently named character). The resulting DVD of the 2009/10 show, Rob Brydon: Live, was released on 23 November 2009. Brydon appeared as a host on episode two of series five of the BBC series of Live at the Apollo.\n\nIn 2010 Brydon took part in Channel 4's Comedy Gala, a benefit show in aid of Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital, filmed live at the O2 Arena in London on 30 March. He was one of six comp√®res for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert held outside Buckingham Palace on 4 June 2012.\n\nPersonal life\n\nFrom his first marriage Brydon has two daughters, Katie, born August 1994 and Amy, born July 1998, and a son Harry, born October 1996.\n\nAfter being divorced, on 6 October 2006 Brydon married Claire Holland, a former producer on The South Bank Show, at Windsor church. They live in Strawberry Hill in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. They have two sons, Tom, born in April 2008, and George, born in June 2011. A fanatical golfer, Brydon is also a Swansea City fan and is an ambassador to their 1912 foundation.\n\nBrydon and Ben Miller have both regularly been mistaken for each other by members of the public. As a reference to that mix-up, they dressed in similar outfits and shared a narcissistic kiss in the QI episode \"Future\", first broadcast on 20 February 2009.\n\nHonours and awards\n\nBrydon was made an honorary fellow of the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama where he previously studied. Brydon was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to comedy and broadcasting and for charitable services.\n\nPolitical views\n\nIn August 2014, Brydon was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September's referendum on that issue.\n\nFilmography\n\nActor\n\n-\n\nStitch Head (pre-production)(voice)\n\n-\n\nMy Lady Jane (TV Series) (filming) as\n\nLord Dudley\n\n- Episode #1.8 - Lord Dudley\n\n- Bluebird is Dead - Lord Dudley\n\n- Episode #1.2 - Lord Dudley\n\n- Another Girl, Another Planet - Lord Dudley\n\n- I Feel Free - Lord Dudley\n\n- I'm Gonna Change the World - Lord Dudley\n\n- Episode #1.1 - Lord Dudley\n\n2007\n\nGavin & Stacey (TV Series) as\n\nBryn West\n\n- The Finale (2024) - Bryn West\n\n- A Special Christmas (2019) - Bryn West\n\n- Christmas Special 2008 (2008) - Bryn West\n\n2023\n\nTabby McTat (TV Movie) as\n\nFred (voice)\n\n2023\n\nBarbie as\n\nSugar Daddy Ken\n\n2022\n\nThe Smeds and the Smoos (TV Movie) as\n\nUncle Smoo (voice)\n\n2022\n\nThe Amazing Maurice as\n\nThe Pied Piper (voice)\n\n2022\n\nThe Tuckers (TV Series) as\n\nTony Perrot\n\n- County Final (2022) - Tony Perrot\n\n2022\n\nGreen Eggs and Ham (TV Series) as\n\nPhilip Trousers / Snalfred\n\n- The Mom Who Loved Me (2022) - Philip Trousers (voice)\n\n- The Sam Who Came in From the Cold (2022) - Philip Trousers / Snalfred (voice)\n\n- You Only Mom Twice (2022) - Philip Trousers (voice)\n\n- Three Days of the Mom-dor (2022) - Philip Trousers (voice)\n\n- Goldenguy (2022) - Philip Trousers (voice)\n\n- Tinker Tailor Mother Spy (2022) - Philip Trousers (voice)\n\n- On Her Dookess' Secret Service (2022) - Philip Trousers / Snalfred (voice)\n\n- The Mom Identity (2022) - Philip Trousers (voice)\n\n2021\n\nDouble Trouble (TV Movie) as\n\nRob Brydon\n\n2021\n\nSuperworm (TV Movie) as\n\nCrow (voice)\n\n2021\n\nMcDonald & Dodds (TV Series) as\n\nRoy Gilbert\n\n- The Man Who Wasn't There (2021) - Roy Gilbert\n\n2020\n\nZog and the Flying Doctors (TV Movie) as\n\nKing (voice)\n\n2020\n\nRoald & Beatrix: The Tail of the Curious Mouse (TV Movie) as\n\nWilliam Heelis\n\n2010\n\nThe Trip (TV Series) as\n\nRob\n\n- The Mani to Ithaca (2020) - Rob\n\n- Hydra to the Mani (2020) - Rob\n\n- Athens to Hydra (2020) - Rob\n\n- Pelion to Athens (2020) - Rob\n\n- Kavala to Pelion (2020) - Rob\n\n- The Trip to Greece: Troy to Kavala (2020) - Rob\n\n- El Refectorium (2017) - Rob\n\n- Parador de Almagro (2017) - Rob\n\n- N√∂la (2017) - Rob\n\n- La Posada del Laurel (2017) - Rob\n\n- Etxebarri (2017) - Rob\n\n- Txoko (2017) - Rob\n\n- Il Riccio, Capri (2014) - Rob\n\n- Villa Cimbrone, Ravello (2014) - Rob\n\n- The Hotel Locarno, Rome (2014) - Rob\n\n- La Suvera, Pievescola (2014) - Rob\n\n- Da Giovanni, San Fruttuso (2014) - Rob\n\n- Il Cenobio dei Dogi, Camogli (2014) - Rob\n\n- The Angel at Hetton (2010) - Rob\n\n- The Yorke Arms (2010) - Rob\n\n- Hipping Hall (2010) - Rob\n\n- Holbeck Ghyll (2010) - Rob\n\n- L'Enclume (2010) - Rob\n\n- The Inn at Whitewell (2010) - Rob\n\n2020\n\nThe Trip to Greece as\n\nRob Brydon\n\n2019\n\nThe Snail and the Whale (TV Movie) as\n\nWhale (voice)\n\n2019\n\nDays of the Bagnold Summer as\n\nDouglas Porter\n\n2019\n\nBlinded by the Light as\n\nMatt's Dad\n\n2018\n\nZog (TV Movie) as\n\nGuards / Horse / Other Vocals (voice)\n\n2018\n\nHolmes & Watson as\n\nInspector Lestrade\n\n2018\n\nSwimming with Men as\n\nEric Scott\n\n2018\n\nTrust (TV Series) as\n\nPresident Nixon\n\n- White Car in a Snowstorm (2018) - President Nixon\n\n2018\n\nEarly Man as\n\nMessage Bird / Brian / Bryan / ...
