She works for The Sun newspaper and has a weekly column, as well as being editor of the paper's women's issues and supplements.\n\n[in 2017] I wish I'd slept with more men. I was very monogamous and I was very sort of like \"Well, obviously I'm not going to entertain you at all unless we've been dating for at least three months\", and now I just think \"Why? Why not just lighten up a bit?\" Probably I would have just been a little less uptight about that kind of thing."
