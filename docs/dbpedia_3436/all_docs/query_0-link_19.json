        "text": "Sun columnist Jane Moore - she of the red lipstick and blonde hair -is tucking into her starter at The Ivy, restaurant of choice for London's showbiz elite.\n\nMoore crops up so regularly on TV these days - most recently on Rob Brydon's spoof panel game Annually Retentive - that she is in danger of becoming part of the showbiz set herself. She has even turned down I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here. Twice.\n\nA stalwart of BBC2s Grumpy Old Women, she has made several documentaries, penned a television drama and written five books. But we are meeting to discuss a new venture: a website called Youthejury.com. The idea is simple enough - members of the public who are about to buy a new stereo, microwave or 'anything you shell out money for' can log on to the site first to read other people's reviews, or post their own.\n\nMoore receives hundreds of emails from Sun readers complaining about products, and believes the site could provide a useful service. 'In my ideal world people will say: Oh I'll just \"Youthejury\" that. There's a really good holiday website called Tripadvisor. If it becomes anything like that it would be great.' It would also make her a wealthy woman, but in the meantime 'it is going to cost me an absolute fortune. Until it gets a certain number of hits it won't attract advertising. It lives or dies by user input.'\n\nMoore contemplated approaching her employer, News International - or even Rupert Murdoch himself - for start-up cash, but decided to go it alone. 'If in five years' time somebody like Murdoch or Yahoo says: It's a nice little website, how much do you want for it?', Moore will be off to her villa in the sun. If not, she says, 'I'll be selling The Big Issue.'\n\nMoore's journey from local newspaper hack to Sun columnist is testament to the power of perseverance.\n\nShe was born in Worcester, her mother a teacher and her father a maths professor at Oxford. After a stint on the Solihull News she trained as a 'downtable sub' to get onto the Birmingham Post, where she 'drove the editor insane' until he gave her a job as a reporter. She was given her own TV column but spent weekends 'going up and down the motorway in my Morris Minor working Saturday shifts for the People.'\n\nEventually she landed a full-time job on the paper, and went on to work as a senior journalist at the Sun, Today, the Daily Mirror and, briefly, the Sunday Sport. Now she is one of Fleet Street's longest-serving, and most powerful, columnists - rather like a female Richard Littlejohn with better jokes and a slightly less vitriolic writing style.\n\nMoore has clearly found her spiritual home at Wapping, although these days she files from her home in Richmond; Rebekah Wade is a friend and Rupert Murdoch takes a personal interest in her career.\n\nShe tells an anecdote about Murdoch, who once flew her to Los Angeles, where he was based for much of the 1990s. They had lunch in the Fox Studio canteen, interrupted only when a 'big red phone' by his side rang loudly. 'He picked it up, grunted into it for a while then put the receiver down. I said [sarcastically] \"that sounded interesting\" and he replied: \"Yeah. I've just bought the LA Dodgers.\"'\n\nLater that day, Murdoch queued patiently at the Fox Studios shop while Moore raced round buying presents.\n\nMurdoch is right to keep Moore onside. If she decided to defect to a rival she could probably name her price, although she admits she was always 'desperate' to work for the Sun and will 'either be fired or carried out in a box'. Of her column, she says simply: 'I love it', although 'it is a powerful platform, and one you shouldn't abuse'.\n\nThe secret of being a successful columnist for over a decade, Moore says, is finding new ways to express the same views: 'The message is always the same but you have to find different way of saying it. Everyone has the same basic opinions about crime, single mothers, the environment or whatever. If you keep saying your opinion is different every time, you won't last very long because readers won't trust what you say.'\n\nIf the Sun's views on these subjects are sometimes predictable then it's only because 'people genuinely do feel aggrieved by the nanny state and political correctness. The sentiment behind both of them absolutely resonates with the readers - and with me'.\n\nShe has only ever written one item she regrets: criticising actor Courteney Cox for wearing a baggy pair of dungarees four days into her pregnancy and accusing her of being a baby bore.\n\nWhen readers informed her that Cox had suffered several miscarriages, she apologised. She receives threats all the time: 'I get loads of nutters writing to me. I've got one who thinks he's married to me and writes to me on brown McDonald's carrier bags.'\n\nFar more irritating, she says, are the patronising letters: 'I get [them] all the time. I'll read one to you. It's bonkers. It's everything I hate about people who look down on the tabloids.'The letter reads: 'Do you acutally do any research before you write this trash?'. Then it goes on to warn her: 'You should be more aware of your target audience. Generally they are working class people [and] your views can very quickly become their views.'\n\nMoore looks up from her BlackBerry and rolls her eyes: 'They usually preface it with \"I do not read your newspaper, but I picked it up on the Tube\".'\n\nThen she returns to her main course, and contemplates a new career as an internet entrepreneur."
