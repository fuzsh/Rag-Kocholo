        "text": "Episode 3\n\nJeremy tests the new Brooklands Bentley Super CoupÃ© on the Top Gear test track. The Producers set the Presenters a challenge: each is to buy an old Alpha Romeo for Â£1000 or less and put them through a series of feared Top Gear tests, including a track day, featuring them in calendars and showing them at a concourse day where the motto is âa passion for perfection.â Actor-comedians Rob Brydon and James Corden (currently enjoying much success in the BBCâs multi-award-winning Gavin & Stacey) are the âStars in a Reasonably Priced Car.â\n\nHammond Nearly Drowns\n\nJeremy Clarkson looks at the bling-bling Continental GT and the changing face of Bentley. James May takes a spin in the new Subaru Legacy, while Richard Hammond gives Top Gear's safety experts something to do when he investigates the best way to escape from a submerged car. This week's Star in a Reasonably Priced Car is Welsh actor/comedian Rob Brydon (Marion & Geoff, Gaving & Stacey)."
