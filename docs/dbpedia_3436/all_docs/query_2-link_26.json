        "text": "Jane Moore was notably absent from the Loose Women line-up as the show began on Monday, before being involved in a terrifying stunt moments later, as she hurtled towards her colleagues on a zip wire.\n\nAt the start of this year journalist Jane was 'missing in action' from the long running ITV panel show, having been part of its team for years and amid reports that she and fellow journo Janet Street-Porter were embroiled in a 'contract row' with TV execs. However, after speculation mounted on her Loose Women future, Jane did eventually return and was all set to join colleagues Kaye Adams, Katie Piper and Nadia Sawalha for a pre-recorded special.\n\nMoving away from the familiar surroundings of the ITV studio at Television Centre, the programme took up residence at the world famous Eden Project in Cornwall for a one-off broadcast to mark World Earth Day. After credits rolled just before 12.30pm, it became apparent that the panel were a member down, with Jane nowhere to be seen on set, as Kay, Katie and Nadia stood next to each other in front of camera.\n\nREAD MORE: Britain's Got Talent's Amanda Holden 'backtracks' over Golden Buzzer as act's career rumbled\n\nGet all the latest TV and showbiz news and gossip from Chronicle Live with our free newsletter..\n\nAll became clear a few moments later, when Kaye instructed her colleagues and viewers at home to 'look over yonder' adding: \"She'll be here in 30 seconds,\" as the camera then panned to Jane high above the set, ready to head down a zip wire. The familiar strains of the James Bond theme then sounded out, as Jane quipped: \"The name's Moore, Jane Moore,\" before beginning her descent.\n\nHer high flying exploits were captured by a camera on the helmet she was wearing, with people seeing the mix of terror and excitement on Jane's face, as she came to a safe landing and remarked: \"That was incredible!\" Asked by Kate if she got 'butterflies' Jane responded: \"No, I absolutely loved it! It was amazing to just go over the rooftops...it was a bit disconcerting at the beginning as you're just hanging over a precipice waiting for them to push you.\""
