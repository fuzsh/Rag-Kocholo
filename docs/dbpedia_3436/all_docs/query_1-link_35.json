        "text": "Rob Brydon's Annually Retentive DVD\n\n|\n\nRob Brydon plays the reluctant host of a quirky new history based panel show - Annually Retentive. Is he reluctant because he believes all panel shows except QI are beneath him or because it's the only job he can get in TV since all the acting work dried up? You decide. Go behind the scenes and witness the bitching backstabbing and scheming that runs rampant when the cameras aren't rolling... mainly from Brydon."
