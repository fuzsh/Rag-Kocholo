        "text": "ONE of the Loose Women panelists looked worlds away from the show as her brand new project was unveiled.\n\nSun columnist Jane Moore has been a part of the ITV daytime panel show since it's first episode in 1999.\n\nHowever she's embarking on her most harrowing project yet as one of the main contributors in a new Netflix documentary.\n\nOn the 26th September, 'Who Killed Jill Dando?' will drop on the online streaming service.\n\nThe broadcasting legend was killed in 1999 when she was shot through the head in broad daylight on her doorstep.\n\nA brand new trailer has been dropped by the streamer which shows Jane, 61, as one of the prime contributors to front the series.\n\nTowards the end of the trailer she is heard saying: \"To be sitting here 24 years on and saying, that we still do not know who killed Jill Dando is mind boggling.\"\n\nEarlier her voice was also heard as she labelled the late star as \"the golden girl of television,\" as she details how Jill was murdered.\n\nJill was best known for fronting huge BBC shows such as Breakfast News, Songs Of Praise and Crimewatch.\n\nIn 1997, she was also named as was the publicly funded corporation's Personality of the Year, just two years before her death.\n\nDespite one of the biggest homicide investigations in British history, the murder remains unsolved to this day.\n\nThe three-part documentary series promises to take viewers through the twists and the turns of a true crime mystery.\n\nEach episode is around 40 minutes long and the production was made by Empress Films.\n\nHer family, friends, journalists, investigators and lawyers are all set to be featured in the film as they ponder the result of the case."
