        "text": "Born in Swansea, South Wales, Rob Brydon needs no introduction. Starring as Uncle Bryn in the hugely popular comedy Gavin and Stacey, Rob originally studied acting at The Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama before joining BBC Wales as a radio and television presenter. Having moved to London in the early '90s he worked as a voice over artist and made occasional appearances on television. He also had several small film roles including, First Knight, and Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.\n\nRob's popularity began to grow in 2000 with the shows Marion and Geoff and Human Remains, winning British Comedy Awards for both. Since then his comedy credits includ A Small Summer Party, The Keith Barret Show, Directors Commentary, Supernova, Cruise Of The Gods, Black Books, I'm Alan Partridge, Little Britain, Live At The Apollo, Rob Brydon's Annually Retentive, QI, The Big Fat Quiz Of The Year, Have I Got News For You, Gavin and Stacey, Rob Brydon's Identity Crisis and Would I Lie To You?.\n\nRob's TV and radio appearances read like a list of 'who's who' and include Friday Night With Jonathan Ross, Parkinson, Richard and Judy, The ONE Show, The F Word, This Morning, Top Gear and The Paul O'Grady Show, to name but a few.\n\nRob's versatile voice has seen him narrating many programs including Little Britain Down Under, Becoming Bond, Valley Of Song, Holmfirth Hollywood and 100 Greatest Comedy Moments. He has also performed character voices for the animations The Gruffalo, The Legends of Treasure Island, Body Beautiful, The Baskervilles and Robbie The Reindeer: The Legend Of The Lost Tribe.\n\nAlongside Ruth Jones, Robin Gibb and Sir Tom Jones, Rob reached number one in the charts with the single Islands In The Stream, in aid of Comic Relief 2009. He also embarked on an eighty seven date tour of the UK with his stand up show, Rob Brydon Live; this included a three week run in London's West End.\n\nOnstage Rob is a natural entertainer and a seasoned awards host. He might well hark back to his alter ego's Keith Barret's miserable childhood, or regale audiences with uncannily accurate impressions of two Welsh heroes, Anthony Hopkins and Tom Jones. The 'man trapped in a box' may also make an appearance."
