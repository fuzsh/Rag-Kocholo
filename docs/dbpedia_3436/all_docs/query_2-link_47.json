        "text": "Overview\n\nMy area of research expertise is British and Irish Romanticism. I received my PhD from Cardiff University in 1991 for a thesis on the early feminist author, Mary Wollstonecraft, and have since published two books and several articles and essays on her work. I am currently Reader in English Literature in the School of English, Communication and Philosophy. I began my teaching career at Trinity College, Dublin, and have held several visiting lectureships at universities in Europe and overseas during my tenure at Cardiff, including Université de Gaulle, Lille III, the University of Potsdam, the University of the Philippines, Ateneo de Manila University, and De la Salle University, Metro Manila, Philippines.\n\nI have a record of international research excellence in late eighteenth-century literature and Romanticism, with a focus on Irish Romanticism, specifically the work of the satirist, poet and song-writer, Thomas Moore (1779-1852). My edition The Satires of Thomas Moore (600pp., 2003) is the first modern scholarly edition of his work and helped to inspire the current resurgence of interest in Moore. More recently, my work on Moore has broadened to include studies of his lyric writing and song in the context of Irish Romanticism. I have recently completed the MS of my monograph, The Surface Romanticism of Thomas Moore: Poetry, Sociability and Song, an interdisciplinary study of the relationship between poetry and music that offers a revisionary account of the aesthetic value and political valency of Moore’s surface technique.\n\nI am currently working towards a substantial government-funded grant proposal ‘Women in Eighteenth-Century Catch and Glee Club Culture in Britain and Ireland’, which brings together my interests in national popular song and poetry. I enjoy thinking across disciplinary boundaries, as evidenced by my jointly-authored book, Key Concepts in Romantic Literature (Palgrave Macmillan, 2010), which spans the breadth of Romantic-period history, politics, and culture, and by the production (with Professor Duncan Wu, Georgetown University, Washington DC, and Professor John Strachan, Bath Spa University) of a new, very substantial online digital resource, Routledge Historical Resources: Romanticism (2020). https://librarianresources.taylorandfrancis.com/product-info/digital-products/online-resources/romanticism/\n\nI have been influential in helping to enrich the profile of Romanticism at Cardiff and was instrumental, in 2014, in the foundation of the Cardiff Eighteenth-Century and Romanticism Seminar (CRECS), which offers a cohesive, dynamic, and welcoming intellectual community for students and teachers of eighteenth-century and Romanticism.\n\nI sit on the Government of Ireland’s three major grant awarding bodies, I am a trustee of The Charles Lamb Society and serve on the editorial board of The Charles Lamb Bulletin. I am a member of the British Association for Romantic Studies and served on the Executive Board of BARS as Treasurer and Membership Secretary from 2013-19. I have previously served on the AHRC-SWWDTP Management Group and am keen to foster the careers of PhD students, having supervised many externally-funded Cardiff PhDs to successful completion.\n\nI am currently Chair of ENCAP Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion and led the School's submission for Athena Swan Bronze accreditation (awarded January 2023). I am committed to honoring EDI principles in my teaching and resarch, and in my wider contribution to the university community.\n\nResearch\n\nCurrent projects\n\nI have recently completed the MS of my monograph, The Surface Romanticism of Thomas Moore: Poetry, Sociability and Song, an interdisciplinary study of the relationship between poetry and music that offers a revisionary account of the aesthetic value and political valency of Moore’s surface technique. I am currently working towards a grant proposal ‘Women in Eighteenth-Century Catch and Glee Club Culture in Britain and Ireland’, which brings together my interests in national popular song and poetry.\n\nMary Lamb is another area of research interest. I am interested in Lamb's work as a needlewoman, which is the subject of my essay 'Pattern and Romantic Creativity' Charles Lamb Bulletin 163 (2015). Despite murdering her mother with a carving knife, Lamb received many generous tributes from literary men her circle. Those tributes form the subject of my recent essay, 'Mary Lamb and the Men' (Charles Lamb Bulletin, 176 (2022). and my paper for the Charles Lamb Brithday Lecture (February 2020). Lamb Society, 13 February 2020: https://charleslambsociety.com/docs/Jane%20Moore%202021%20Birthday%20Lecture.mp4\n\nResearch interests\n\nMy areas of research interest are British and Irish Romanticism and women's writing of the Romantic period.\n\nPostgraduate students\n\nI welcome applications from potential graduate students interested in researching any aspect of Romantic-era poetry and prose, especially the work of Thomas Moore. I am also keen to hear from students who wish to work on women's writing and craftwork during the period.\n\nPhDs supervised to successful completion include:\n\nAlastair Dawson, Criss-Crossing the Channel: Women’s Educational Discourse in Britain and France, 1750-1820\n\nSiriol McAvoy, The Presence of the Past: Medieval Encounters in the Writing of Virginia Woolf and Lynette Roberts\n\nKatie Garner, Avalon Recovered: The Arthurian Legend in British Women's Writing, 1775 - 1834,\n\nJennifer Whitney, Playing with Dolls: Feminine Subjectivity and the Posthuman\n\nRachel Howard, Domesticating the Novel: Moral-Domestic Fiction, 1820-1834."
