        "text": "Writers: Rob Brydon, Paul Duddridge, 15, 2006\n\nStars: Rob Brydon, Dave Gorman, Jane Moore, Russell Brand, David Walliams\n\nOut to buy on DVD\n\n“I’m worried about integrity,” the quizmaster Brydon moans to the producer of his fictional panel show, which steals shamelessly from Have I Got News For You. “It’s a panel show,” comes the reply.\n\n“You leave your integrity at the door.” Cutting, Larry Sanders-style, between the show and backstage, Annually Retentive provides the perfect platform for Brydon, playing a demonic version of himself, to mimic (often hilariously) and abuse (often brutally) his guests. It’s a bit of fun, the real Brydon has insisted. But tell that to Dominik Diamond, whose appearance on the show is described as “a new low”.\n\nDVD extras"
