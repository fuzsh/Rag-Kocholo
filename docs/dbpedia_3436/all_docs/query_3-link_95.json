Arthur tells Rob about growing up in a creative family, and the pair discuss their shared love for musicals. Arthur also reveals how he landed a role in Doctor Who, and why he chose to leave the series.\n\nBy\n\nLeslie Ohanian\n\n-\n\nA Doctor Who fan from the tender age of nine, my first Doctor was Tom Baker (and I have the long scarf to prove it!) I like New Who and the classics as well as classic cars and classic rock. Geek by profession and by choice, happily married and never ready for Winter."
