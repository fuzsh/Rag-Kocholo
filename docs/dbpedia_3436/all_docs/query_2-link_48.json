Moore Field Capacity 2,316 Location 796 Biggio Dr.\n\nAuburn, AL 36849 Year Opened 1998 Field Natural Grass\n\nThe dream of an on-campus facility, which began when softball was added as an intercollegiate, sport started to take form in November of 1996, when the Board of Trustees approved a bid from French and Associates Landscape Architects for the construction of phase one which was intended to include the actual playing surface. French and Associates was responsible for the design and construction of Golden Park in Columbus, Ga., which was host to the 1996 NCAA Women's College World Series and the 1996 Summer Olympic Games Softball competition.\n\nThe Tigers started playing at the facility on April 24, 1998, when they played their first home game at the new on-campus field. The Tigers hosted Georgia, also making it the first SEC game played at the facility. Junior Kim Blair recorded the first hit for the Tigers while senior Ashley Camp drove in Blair for the first run at the new park. 1999 marked the first full season the field was in use. Prior to the new complex, the team played its games at the Auburn city complex.\n\nThe plans for the facility called for it to resemble a scaled down version of the home of Auburn Baseball, Samford Stadium and Hitchcock Field at Plainsman Park. Permanent seating for 1,500 was built in phase two of the project. The Auburn Softball Complex was renamed Jane B. Moore Field in 2002 in honor of Dr. Jane Moore who served more than 20 years as a member of Auburn's Committee on Intercollegiate Athletics. It was dedicated on April 26, 2003.\n\nThe final phase of the softball complex, completed prior to the 2003 season, added 1,400 seats, a concession area, indoor batting cages and a state-of-the-art press box with two luxury boxes.\n\nThe Tigers played their first full season at the modern Moore Field in 2003. Auburn continued to make history two season later by hosting the 2005 Auburn Regional, the first NCAA Regional to take place at Jane B. Moore Field and Auburn’s campus. The Tigers would secure their first NCAA postseason victory, knocking off Florida A&M 11-2 in six innings on May 21, 2005.\n\nSince the 2005 season, Auburn has hosted four NCAA Regionals at Jane B. Moore Field. Spanning from 2015 until 2017, the Tigers hosted and won three consecutive NCAA Regional titles at Jane B. Moore Field, including the program’s first in 2015 behind a 7-4 win over South Alabama on May 17.\n\nJane B. Moore Field has been the host site for three NCAA Super Regionals and has seen the Tigers punch their berth to the Women’s College World Series in 2016 and 2016.\n\nEntering the 2023 season, Auburn holds a 467-194-1 (.706) all-time record at Jane B. Moore Field. The Tigers also boast a 14-5 (.737) record in postseason action inside their home stadium.\n\nPrior to the 2021 season, Auburn opened the Gregg E. Heim Player Development Center at Jane B. Moore Field.\n\nThe 11,000-square-foot facility is complete with six batting tunnels, a netting system, team meeting space, LED lighting, pitching machines and a full turf infield with a clay pitching circle."
