        "text": "My first shoot with Rob Brydon was way back when he played the taxi driver Keith Barrett. Since then I have been commissioned by several different publications to photograph him, I’ve shot a live DVD cover with Rob and the poster to his live standup tour. This shoot was promoting a youtube podcast series where he interviews other comedians and celebrities. The show is a result of Covid, and is an entertaining and fun podcast with Rob having a banter with close celebrity friends, comedians and actors he has worked with and knows well. The beauty with Rob is that his comedy is not loud and in your face. Working with him is like having a relaxed banter amongst friends with his sharp whit injected into the conversations. He is a normal family dad, talking of his love for Bruce Springsteen and comedy films such as Daddy’s Home. He doesn’t keep this part of his life separate from his comedy but incorporates it, and makes it flow as natural as it can be. No point in taking yourself too serious, as that would only allow for you to be ridiculed by subtle comments perfectly placed. Always a pleasure working with Rob and I can only hope I will do so many more times in the future.\n\nShot for Observer Magazine"
