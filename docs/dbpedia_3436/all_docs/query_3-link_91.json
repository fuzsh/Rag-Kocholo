        "text": "Rob Brydon starred as Uncle Bryn in the hugely popular comedy Gavin & Stacey, joined in friendly rivalry with Steve Coogan on The Trip, and chairs Would I Lie To You. Originally a Radio Wales DJ, he first captured viewers’ imagination as Keith, the eternally optimistic chauffeur with his bittersweet, painfully comic tales in Marion and Geoff.\n\nThe one-man sitcom led to The Keith Barret Show, in which the host cheerfully delved into - and often ripped apart - his guests’ relationships. Since then he has some of the most popular comedy and panel shows on TV. His portrayal of the endlessly good-natured uncle in Gavin & Stacy made him a household name, and other credits include I'm Alan Partridge, Little Britain and Black Books. He also appears in many feature films including 24 Hour Party People, Holmes & Watson, The Huntsman and The Trip to...series. He's also been a regular on Have I Got News For You, Just A Minute and QI.\n\nOnstage Rob is a natural entertainer and seasoned host, combining wit, song, and the occasional impression of Hollywood and Welsh legends."
