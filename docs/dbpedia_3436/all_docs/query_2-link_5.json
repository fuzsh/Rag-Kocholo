        "text": "Jane Moore, a panellist on Loose Women, jokingly made a swift exit from the ITV show on Friday, admitting she's not \"good at goodbyes\". Host Kaye Adams and panellists Jane, Nadia Sawalha and Judi Love discussed goodbyes following the departure of Bradley Riches from Celebrity Big Brother, who left without a live eviction.\n\nJudi confessed that watching the emotional scenes of Bradley being informed of his eviction, under the pretence of meeting a loved one, left her teary-eyed. Bradley then hastily bid his housemates farewell before exiting the Celebrity Big Brother house. Jane found the response to the Heartstopper actor's departure amusing, joking: \"They'll all see each other again at the wrap party!\"\n\nKaye highlighted that Jane isn't one for lengthy goodbyes and often departs events without bidding anyone farewell. She recalled an instance of Jane's abrupt departure, saying: \"It was a theatre production and there was a whole bunch of people there.\"\n\nJane had attended with a friend, and as the production concluded and everyone applauded, her friend turned to find Jane had already left. Explaining her hasty exit, Jane said: \"I don't want to get stuck in that queue going out of the theatre so I go out quickly. I thought she was behind me but she didn't follow me.\"\n\nKaye interrupted, saying: \"We've got to go to the break I have no idea whether Jane's going to be here when we come back,\" and Nadia added: \"It's a great tip for young people, just leave.\"\n\nJane then proceeded to stand and exit from the Loose Women stage, disappearing behind the set. Upon returning from the commercial break, she was back in her seat.\n\nEarlier in the week, Loose Women's Denise Welch expressed her disappointment at Fern Britton following a disagreement she had with Nikita Kuzmin in the CBB house.\n\nFern, a former This Morning presenter, had told the Strictly pro that she didn't appreciate his earlier comment about her outfit, which she felt was delivered as a disguised insult.\n\nDenise voiced her frustration: \"If there's one type of behaviour I cannot stand, it's passive-aggressive behaviour.\n\n\"The definition of it is indirectly expressing negative opinions instead of addressing them and I can't bare anything that's done behind a sickly painted smile.\"\n\nShe added: \"I felt very sorry for Nikita because I genuinely think it wasn't ageist, I think it was because he nominated her four times and she didn't like it and I felt sorry for him.\n\n\"I don't think he's got a mean bone in his body, in there and knowing him a little bit outside.\"\n\nLoose Women airs weekdays at 12.30pm on ITV."
