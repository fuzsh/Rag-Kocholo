        "text": "Watch below: Jane Moore announces split from husband on Loose Women\n\nLoose Women panellist Jane Moore has announced she has split with her husband Gary Farrow after being married for more than 20 years.\n\nThe 60-year-old journalist made the revelation live on Loose Women, saying that they agreed to separate a while ago.\n\nMoore said: \"So Gary and I are separating. But it's weird that it's out there [in public] because we've been processing it for about a year.\"\n\nRead more: 'Loose Women' welcomes back live audience for first time since March 2020\n\nShe then revealed that an injury got in the way of announcing it sooner: \"We're both quite private people. We had discussed it last year... it was going to happen last year. And then he fell and broke his leg and, no, I didn't push him.\"\n\nMoore said that the split was \"amicable\" and that they will be spending Christmas together as a family: \"So we were sort of we're still in the same house together. We're still going to do Christmas together.\"\n\nShe also praised her partner of more than 20 years: \"I mean, I would always say, he is my best friend. I hope if he was sitting here he would say, I'm his best friend, and I'm just very, very keen that we don't lose that element of it, you know, so, yeah, so we're still living together.\"\n\nFarrow, a publicist, nearly missed his wedding to Moore after getting arrested the night before and was still in a cell just hours before he was due to tie the knot.\n\nElton John, who Farrow represents, was best man at the wedding.\n\nAs well as Loose Women, Moore is known for her column in The Sun and has contributed to shows such as The Andrew Marr Show, Dispatches and Rob Brydon's Annually Retentive."
