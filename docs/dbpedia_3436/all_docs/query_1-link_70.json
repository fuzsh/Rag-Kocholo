        "text": "Award-winning comedian Rob Brydon is heading back on tour in 2024 with his song and comedy show Rob Brydon – A Night of Songs & Laughter.\n\nA Night of Songs & Laughter features Rob’s brilliant stand-up comedy plus songs ranging from Tom Waits to Tom Jones, and Guys and Dolls to Elvis (and almost everything in between), telling Rob’s personal musical journey from South Wales to the West End and beyond. Audiences can expect Rob’s usual warmth and humour, along with his famed gallery of voices, as he regales them with hilarious tales from his distant and recent past.\n\nRob Brydon said, “It turns out that touring with a band is the most fun you can have, I can’t wait to get back out to some new towns and cities and to revisiting some of the old ones we loved playing on the first leg.”\n\nThe production took UK critics and audiences by storm in 2022 before playing to sold out venues across Australia and New Zealand in 2023 and is now set to return from Sunday 18 February 2024 at Festival Theatre, Edinburgh, playing through a variety of venues until its final date at Dublin’s Bord Gáis Energy Theatre on Tuesday 26 March 2024.\n\nRob Brydon’s varied career began with the TV comedy shows Marion and Geoff and Human Remains in 2000, for which he won British Comedy Awards. Since then, his comedy credits have included A Small Summer Party, The Keith Barret Show, Directors Commentary, Supernova, Cruise Of The Gods, Black Books, I’m Alan Partridge, Little Britain, Live At The Apollo, Rob Brydon’s Annually Retentive, QI, The Big Fat Quiz Of The Year, Have I Got News For You, Gavin and Stacey, Rob Brydon’s Identity Crisis, Would I Lie To You? and The Trip.\n\nSee here for Rob Brydon – A Night of Songs & Laughter tour dates.\n\nRob Brydon – A Night of Songs & Laughter\n\n,\n\nBook tickets\n\n📷 Main photo: Rob Brydon\n\nRelated News\n\nMore >"
