        "text": "Today’s first recording I almost dismissed as a repeat as it’s Doctor Who – The Parting of Ways. I watched this with my family months ago, and so I thought I’d already featured it on the blog, but no, this repeat showing is the first time it’s come up on the blog.\n\nThis is the finale of series one of New Who. If you want to catch up with the first part of this two-parter, I looked at it as part of my DVDs. But who am I kidding? You all remember that one.\n\nThis episode opens with the Doctor carrying out his promise from the last episode, flying the Tardis to the Dalek fleet while they shoot at him. Lucky they have the extrapolator from Boom Town to create a force field. Then, in a rather brilliant move that I don’t think we’ve ever seen on the show before, the Tardis materialises around Rose (and her Dalek guardian).\n\nJack uses his big gun from the previous episode to kill the Dalek – so much for the “State of Temporal Grace” that Peter Davison was talking about in a previous Confidential.\n\nThey leave the Tardis to talk to the Daleks, protected by the force field. They find the Dalek Emperor, who seems to have delusions of godhood. He reveals that this new army of Daleks is made from harvested human tissue.\n\nReturning to Satellite 5, the Doctor starts work on using the satellite’s transmitters to create a delta wave, which will fry the brains of all the Daleks it’s pointed at.\n\nJack readies the remaining people to defend the station against the oncoming Daleks. He says goodbye to Rose and the Doctor. “I wish I’d never met you, Doctor. I was much better off as a coward. See you in hell.”\n\nJack goes down to level zero, where there’s still a few remaining people who couldn’t travel back to Earth. He tries to recruit them to stop the Daleks. Roderick (Paterson Joseph) is one of them, and he’s not going. “Don’t listen to him! There aren’t any Daleks, they disappeared thousands of years ago!” As Jack leaves with the few who joined him he says “here’s a few words of advice. Keep quiet. And if you hear fighting up above, if you hear us dying… then tell me that the Daleks aren’t real. Don’t make a sound.” John Barrowman is really good throughout this episode.\n\nBack on floor 500, the Doctor and Rose are working on the delta wave. He says “There’s another thing the Tardis could do. It could take us away. We could leave. Let history take its course. We go to Marbella in 1989.” Rose replies “Yeah, but you’d never do that.” “No, but you could ask. It never even occurred to you, did it?” “Well…I’m just too good.” Then the Doctor has an inspiration. “If I use the Tardis to cross my own timeline…” He gets Rose to hold down something on the Tardis console while he goes outside to do something, but as soon as he leaves the Tardis, his body language changes, he pauses, then points the Sonic Screwdriver at the Tardis, and it starts dematerialising. A hologram of the Doctor plays to Rose, telling her that he’s sending her home, and she should forget about him. “Over the years the world will move on and the box will be buried. And if you want to remember me, then you can do one thing. That’s all, one thing.” At this point, the hologram, which had been just looking ahead, turns to where Rose is standing. “Have a good life. Do that for me, Rose. Have a fantastic life.” This never fails to send me off.\n\nThe Emperor taunts the Doctor, telling him that the delta wave will destroy not only the Daleks, but every living thing in its path, which includes everyone on Earth.\n\nBack on Earth, Rose is with Mickey and Jackie. She tells them she can’t just sit there and do nothing while the Doctor is fighting for everyone. They tell her she’ll have to go back to her normal life. I do like Jackie here. “Listen to me, God knows, I’ve hated that man, but right now I love him and do you know why? Cos he did the right thing, he sent you back to me.”\n\nRose runs off, but Mickey follows. She’s still thinking about the Doctor. And there’s tiny, almost imperceptible clues that perhaps the universe is trying to send her a message. “Bad Wolf” has followed her here, and she thinks it’s a sign that the Tardis knows how to get back.\n\nThe Daleks enter the station, and start making their way to floor 500. The few humans try shooting at them, but their bullets mostly get melted.\n\nMickey is trying to open the Tardis console with his Mini. It’s not working.\n\nSome Daleks go down to floor zero, where the remaining humans are who didn’t want to fight. Roderick’s day just keeps getting worse. “You can’t! You don’t exist It’s not fair! I won the game! I should be rich! I’m a winner, you can’t do this to me!”\n\nAfter their attempt to open the Tardis failed, Jackie tries to reason with Rose. “It was never gonna work, sweetheart, and the Doctor knew that, he just wanted you to be safe.” “I can’t give up.” “Lock the door. Walk away.” “Dad wouldn’t give up.” “Well, he’s not here, is he? And even if he was, he’d say the same.” But now Rose can drop her own bombshell. “Well, I know. Cos I met him. I met Dad. The Doctor took me back in time and I met Dad. Remember when Dad died? There was someone with him… A girl, a blonde girl. She held his hand. You saw her from a distance, Mum, you saw her! Think about it! That was me, you saw me! That’s how good the Doctor is.” Yes, dear reader, I’m crying again.\n\nJackie runs off. Rose and Mickey are outside, wondering what else they can do. I like that Mickey is still trying to help her. Then, suddenly, a bug yellow tow truck drives up, and out jumps Jackie. “You’ve only got this until six, so get on with it.” “Where the hell did you get that?” “Rodrigo, he owes me a favour, never mind why, but you were right about your dad, sweetheart. He was full of mad ideas, and it’s exactly what he would have done. Now get on with it before I change my mind.” Once again, I couldn’t love Jackie more.\n\nBack on Satellite 5, Lynda, who has been monitoring the Daleks’ movements and reporting to Jack and the Doctor, becomes a target. They start burning through the locked door, but then, a group of Daleks rise up outside the window, and in a chilling moment, the Dalek’s lights blink out the rhythm of “Exterminate” and blow out the window.\n\nThe tow truck manages to open the console, and it starts pouring Timey Wimey light into Rose’s eyes. The doors close and it dematerialises.\n\nEven Jack gets exterminated.\n\nI think in the actual extermination shot, it’s John Barrowman’s stuntman.\n\nThe Doctor has completed the delta wave, but in the end he can’t activate it. He can’t kill everyone. The emperor taunts him. “What are you – coward or killer?” “Coward. Any day.” But before the Daleks can kill him, the Tardis arrives, and Rose emerges, glowing with Timey Wimey energy. We even get something of an explanation for the whole Bad Wolf thing. “I am the Bad Wolf. I create myself. I take the words…” (referring to the “Bad Wolf Corporation” sign high above the room they’re in) “I scatter them in time and space. A message to lead myself here.” And then she turns all the Daleks to dust. And just for laughs, brings Captain Jack back from the dead.\n\nBut the power of the Time Vortex is destroying Rose. “I can see everything… All that is… all that was… all that ever could be.” The doctor replies “That’s what I see, all the time. And doesn’t it drive you mad?” “My head… It’s killing me.” “I think you need a doctor.” And we get a kiss that probably annoyed some fans who are uncomfortable with things like emotions in the show.\n\nThe newly alive Jack hears the Tardis leaving, and rushes in to see it vanishing. I’ve always loved Barrowman’s expression at this point.\n\nWhich leaves Rose and The Doctor in the Tardis, as he tells her, in a roundabout way, that he’s going to change. “before I go, I just wanna tell you, you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic! And do you know what? So was I!” And we get to see the brand new regeneration effect, with the Doctor standing up, which has never happened before, but became the norm very quickly.\n\nAnd the new Doctor, the fairly unknown David Tennant, has his first scene. “Hello! OK… New teeth, that’s weird. Where was I? Oh, that’s right! Barcelona!” In my house, every time Barcelona is mentioned, I have to repeat it in the way he does here, but my daughters have their own pop-culture reference, pronouncing it with the lisp, like Tahani is The Good Place.\n\nMedia Centre Description: Rose has seen danger and wonders alongside the Doctor, but now their friendship is put to the test as Earth plunges into an epic war. With the human race being slaughtered, the Doctor is forced into terrible action. Will the time-travellers ever be reunited?\n\nBBC Genome: BBC THREE Wednesday 16 August 2006 19:00\n\nThe next recording follows on, it’s the cut-down Doctor Who Confidential – The Last Battle.\n\nJohn Barrowman explains how the Doctor’s past with the Daleks and the Time War have been driving him throughout this series.\n\nChristopher Eccleston: “If you’re looking for back story. If you’re looking for a lot of reasons why the Doctor is the way the Doctor is, you should look at the Dalek episode. Because I think you you learn a lot there about how he feels about his past.”\n\nRussell T Davies talks about the Doctor’s survivor guilt.\n\nBillie Piper seems to be explaining the concept of acting on TV. “It has actually been one massive adventure this show and playing Rose is, it’s a great experience because obviously the things that happen in Doctor Who are not really likely to happen in my lifetime.”\n\nAndrew Collins: “This series has been as much about her as it is about about the Doctor, and that’s never happened before. You know, his assistants have always been exactly that, people there who assist him, but she’s much more than that. She pushes the narrative, so the episodes are about her sometimes as much as they are about him, and I think that’s a unique thing.”\n\nHelen Raynor: “The extraordinary thing that Rose does in episode 13 is to again be the Doctor’s equal and to finally match him with a gesture that is so noble and strong and heroic and clever as well.”\n\nHere’s a longer version of the episode than I have here.\n\nMedia Centre Description: Simon Pegg narrates a behind-the-scenes look at the new series of Doctor Who, following the production team, writers and cast as they bring the Time Lord back to the screen. As the series reaches its dramatic conclusion, will the doctor survive the final battle of the great time war? As a fitting tribute, the programme relives the the highs and lows of his time with Rose, and sees Christopher Eccleston takes his final bow.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC THREE Wednesday 16 August 2006 19:45\n\nThe next recording is just part of an episode of Gordon Ramsay’s F Word. I’ve no idea why I’ve kept this, as I don’t remember watching much of this. I watched a lot more Kitchen Nightmares and Hell’s Kitchen. So it’s slightly odd that I kept this.\n\nWhat’s on here features a competition to see whose dessert is favourite amongst the clientele of his pop-up restaurant. He’s competing against Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall\n\nAnd Janet Street Porter\n\nRamsay returns to his hometown of Greenock to see if he can find where his Grandfather’s old butcher’s shop was. He doesn’t seem impressed that it’s now a Holland and Barrett.\n\nHe gives some trainee butchers lessons on how to cook a perfect steak.\n\nDuring the series he’s been getting people to send in their unwanted celebrity cookbooks, to see who’s the least popular. The three most donated were Gary Rhodes, Ainsley Harriot and Delia Smith, so he has a taste test set up with a recipe from each of them to see which is the last popular. Which was Gary Rhodes.\n\nMedia Centre Description: Gordon Ramsay hosts a fast-paced food magazine show featuring recipes, consumer stories and cooking challenges. Here, Gordon is rejoined in the kitchen by the best-performing team of the series – the doctors. Scallops and pork are on the menu, and Tana and the kids eat at the restaurant.\n\nRecorded from Channel 4 on Wednesday 16 August 2006 21:46\n\nThe final recording today starts with the end of 60 Seconds.\n\nThere’s a trailer for football on the BBC, and for Little Miss Jocelyn.\n\nThen, finally, an episode of Rob Brydon’s Annually Retentive. After all the trailers, it’s nice to see what it’s about.\n\nIt’s a strange, awkward amalgam of a comedy panel show, and a fictional behind the scenes production that’s trying to be Larry Sanders, but failing. And Brydon has cast himself as a rather unlikeable character (definitely Larry Sanders inspired) who at one point starts chatting up his coworker who’s getting married.\n\nThe team captains are Jane Moore.\n\nand Dave Gorman\n\nThe guests are Sue Perkins\n\nGyles Brandreth\n\nTrisha Goddard\n\nand Rob Deering.\n\nIn the behind the scenes parts, both Alice Lowe and Steve Furst are part of the writer’s room.\n\nAnd Sharon Horgan plays the guest booker who Brydon is relentlessly leching over throughout the episode.\n\nOh God, Brydon even does the Larry Sanders “No flipping” gesture at the end. This is so transparent.\n\nMedia Centre Description: Comedy series in which Rob Brydon plays himself as the host of a low-rent panel show. After weeks of flirting, it’s crunch time for Rob’s romantic ambitions. Any hopes of finally getting together with Sara the guest booker are surely due to be dashed with her impending marriage to the father of her child. Joining Rob on the panel are Gyles Brandreth and Trisha Goddard.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC THREE Wednesday 16 August 2006 23:25\n\nAfter this, there’s trailers for Sinchronicity Little Miss Jocelyn and 34 Stone Teenager.\n\nThen the recording stops after a couple of minutes of 2 Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps.\n\nAdverts:"
