        "text": "Jane Moore walked off Loose Women on Friday after admitting she's not a fan of goodbyes.\n\nHost Kaye Adams and panellists Jane, Nadia Sawalha and Judi Love were discussing whether they are \"good at goodbyes\" following the shock exit of Bradley Riches, which saw the actor leave the show without a live eviction. Judi admitted she was left emotional watching the sad scenes as Bradley was told he had been voted out after being duped into thinking he was meeting a loved one.\n\nHe then quickly said goodbye to his housemates before leaving the Celebrity Big Brother house. Jane found the reaction to the Heartstopper actor's exit amusing and quipped: \"They'll all see each again at the wrap party!\"\n\nKaye pointed out that Jane isn't one for long goodbyes and often leaves engagements without saying goodbye at all. Recalling an example of an abrupt exit, Kaye said: \"It was a theatre production and there was a whole bunch of people there.\n\nJane was there with her friend and the production finishes, everyone claps, the friend looks across to Jane to see she's gone.\" Justifying the lack of goodbye, Jane said: \"I don't want to get stuck in that queue going out of the theatre so I go out quickly. I thought she was behind me but she didn't follow me.\"\n\nInterrupting, Kaye said: \"We've got to go to the break â€“ I have no idea whether Jane's going to be here when we come back,\" as Nadia added: \"It's a great tip for young people, just leave.\"\n\nJane then stood up and walked away from the Loose Women panel disappearing behind the set. The Loose Women star had returned to her seat when the show returned from the ad break.\n\nEarlier in the week, Loose Women panellist Denise Welch hit out at Fern Britton after she clashed with Nikita Kuzmin. The former This Morning presenter told the Strictly Come Dancing pro she wasn't happy with an earlier comment he had made about her outfit, which she viewed as a backhanded compliment.\n\nDenise fumed: \"If there's one type of behaviour I cannot stand, it's passive aggressive behaviour. The definition of it is indirectly expressing negative opinions instead of addressing them and I can't bare anything that's done behind a sickly painted smile.\"\n\nShe continued: \"I felt very sorry for Nikita because I genuinely think it wasn't ageist, I think it was because he nominated her four times and she didn't like it and I felt sorry for him. I don't think he's got a mean bone in his body, in there and knowing him a little bit outside.\""
