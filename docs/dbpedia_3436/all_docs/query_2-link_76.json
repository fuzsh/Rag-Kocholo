        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n1 Mar 2024, 14:12\n\nPic: Rex\n\nLoose Women star Jane Moore seems to have spilled the beans that Sharon Osborne is due to go on Celebrity Big Brother, shocking her co-stars.\n\nMoore has been away for a time, including going on tour with Mrs O.\n\nShe was talking about their time on the road together, and slipped up when co-host Nadia Sawalha asked if Sharon will be entering the Big Brother house.\n\n\"She is,\" said Jane honestly, leaving the audience and the panel stunned.\n\n\"I wasn’t expecting you to answer,\" exclaimed a shocked Nadia.\n\nHost Kaye Adams interrupted to try and undo the damage: \"I don’t think ITV have confirmed that, just a rumour!\"\n\nTrying to cover her tracks, Jane insisted: \"Oh no, sorry – it’s rumoured. She will be amazing!\"\n\n\"If indeed she were to transpire to go in,\" said Kaye, with Jane adding \"I can neither confirm nor deny…\"\n\nA rep for ITV told Metro: \"Any names are at this point pure speculation and viewers will have to tune to see who will be entering the Celebrity Big Brother house.\"\n\nOther rumoured stars include Love Island winner Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu, Strictly's Nikita Kuzmin and former X Factor star Louis Walsh.\n\nRumours say that Sharon will be a special guest star, and she will only be on the show for a week because of how much money she was asking for.\n\n\"The fee she wanted was eye-watering and in the end they struck a deal which meant she would go in for a shorter run,\" an insider told The Sun.\n\n\"It’s worked out well for everyone as she will inject some drama when she finally walks through the doors.\"\n\nThe series is set to start on Monday, March 4th.\n\nWill you be watching?"
