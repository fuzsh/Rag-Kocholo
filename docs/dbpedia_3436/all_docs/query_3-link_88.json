        "text": "He's a bona fide national treasure and a borderline ubiquitous presence on our TV screens thanks to his myriad acting, presenting and voice-over roles.\n\nAnd as he turns 50, BBC Wales have given him a birthday present of a documentary charting the Baglan funnyman’s rise to the top of the showbiz world.\n\nIronic, then, that the Gavin & Stacey star attributes being made redundant by his former employer Radio Wales to setting him off on the road to fame and fortune.\n\nRelated:Rob Brydon reprises West End role in dark slapstick comedy The Painkiller\n\nIn the documentary Rob Brydon At 50, the sell-out stand-up reveals that it was the sudden termination by the station of its late night show Rave that saw him decide to take the plunge and move away from Wales to find work.\n\n“London was where I always wanted to be and I was helped on my way by being let go by Radio Wales,” says Brydon, who’d graduated from Cardiff’s Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama to host such BBC Wales shows as See You Sunday and Invasion – a kind of cross between the board game Risk and Alan Partridge’s fictitious military-based digital quiz show Skirmish.\n\n“So I started to pick up TV presenting jobs like the Shopping Channel, which was admittedly never a great goal of mine.”\n\nIn between rocking an unseemly mullet and selling rolled gold and exercise bikes, he landed his first taste of the lucrative world of commercials.\n\nBut the man who would become the voice of Kellogg’s Crunchy Nut, Tango, Toilet Duck, Abbey National, Soda Stream, P&O Cruises and many, many more would get off to a bumpy start.\n\nLook: Rob's career highlights in pictures\n\n“Me and (Merthyr actor) Steve Speirs got cast in a Toffee Crisp ad campaign.\n\n“We were a double act in it and I remember we were both really excited. They filmed it at Pinewood – which was a thrill because that’s where the Bond movies were filmed.”\n\nYet, for some unknown reason, the execs binned the campaign and Brydon and Speirs’ series of commercials never made it to air.\n\n“These ads were going to change our lives financially,” laughs Brydon now. “Steve even took out a loan off the back of them.”\n\nIt’s something Speirs – who now plays Big Alan on the Sky hit Stella alongside Ruth Jones – remembers only too well.\n\nRelated:From Rob Brydon’s Crunchy Nuts to Duffy’s Diet Coke disaster – the ads that can make or break our celebs\n\n“I went into the branch of Midland bank in Treharris and said, ‘Any chance of a five grand loan mate, I’ve just done a big commercial.’\n\n“They just said, ‘Of course, no problem’ and I’ve never recovered from it,” jokes the star, who’s also 50.\n\n“I blame Rob for them never being shown.\n\n“I mean, the only reason I can think of is that one of us couldn’t have been much cop – and I’d always thought I’d been pretty good.”\n\nWhile voice-over work helped pay the bills, Brydon would eventually return to Pinewood for one more shot at the big time.\n\n“I think that when you’re trying to get ahead in the business you tend to have pretty strange ideas about how it’s going to happen,” admits the artist better known as Uncle Bryn.\n\n“So I sent my CV to the makers of the Kevin Costner film Robin Hood Prince of Thieves because I’d heard they’d started casting for that film.\n\n“Now, you have to remember that I was a Shopping Channel presenter at the time – in what alternate universe would they possibly have picked me over a proper actor?”\n\nRelated:Rob Brydon on the \"Brink\" of fame across the pond?\n\nHe did, nevertheless, land a small part in the 1995 sword and sorcery adventure First Knight, starring alongside Richard Gere and Sean Connery.\n\n“Me and Steve went to the cinema with our respective partners to watch it when it came out,” sighs Brydon, still clearly scarred by the memory.\n\n“I remember it coming on – my scene was right at the very beginning – and thinking, ‘This is it, this is the start of my Hollywood career.’\n\n“I stank the place out. I was terrible and I don’t think I was in another film after that for a long, long time.”\n\nIt was something which kickstarted a period of dark introspection for the comic.\n\n“There was so much impetus, so much desire to get somewhere and there I was heading towards 35 and still not having made it.\n\n“I hadn’t done anything like what I thought I might have.\n\n“What’s more, people had always been so encouraging in telling me I was good.\n\nWATCH: Tom Jones and Rob Brydon's Spirit In The Room seance\n\n“So I couldn’t understand why it wasn’t happening for me.\n\n“I was like, ‘God, won’t someone just let me show them what I can do?’”\n\nIt was at that point Brydon struck it lucky with a showreel of comedy characters he’d sent to fellow comic actor Steve Coogan.\n\n“One of the bits that was really good on it was his taxi driver monologues,” recalls Coogan, referring to Keith Barrett, the sad-sack divorcee and eternal optimist with whom Brydon would finally make a name for himself.\n\n“So I went to the BBC and with my heavyweight credentials I banged my fists of the table and said, ‘You have to give this guy a series’.”\n\nAnd so Marion & Geoff was born, through which Brydon earned both a fan and a friend in the Alan Partridge star, who admits: “It was funny, poignant and moving – I was a little bit jealous of it to be honest.\n\n“The stuff I’d been doing up to that point had been funny, but not really moving as such.”\n\nHuman Remains, a very dark collection of skits Brydon wrote with Night Night’s Julia Davis, followed.\n\n“The characters on that show just poured out,” he recalls. “I loved the process of creating them but can’t help but feel I used up all my archetypes in there.\n\n“There were six characters in Human Remains and nowadays when I try to come up with something new it does tend to sound like one of them.\n\n“After all, there’s only so many different types you can come up with.”\n\nWhile his career was taking off, his personal life was on the rocks.\n\n“My first marriage was in a bad place and was ending.\n\n“So on the one hand, I was going to all these ceremonies and winning awards but, on the other side, things were awful.\n\n“So it was an upsetting time, albeit with moments of egotistical happiness.”\n\nBut then came Gavin & Stacey and the role which would make him a household name – even if he wasn’t sure about taking the role of the naive, cardie-wearing Uncle Bryn.\n\n“Ruth (Jones) and James (Corden) had written the role for me and I thought it was really good, but I couldn’t help thinking I didn’t want to do another Welsh character.\n\n“After all, Bryn’s not a million miles away from Keith.\n\n“I suppose I was still more concerned about what people would think rather then just doing what I wanted to do.\n\n“And thank God I did do it.”\n\nSince then, Brydon’s profile hasn’t stopped growing, with his own successful chat show, stand-up tours, Christmas favourites like The Gruffalo, West End stage plays and popular quiz Would I Lie To You? under his belt.\n\nRe-teaming with Coogan for two seasons of The Trip has also helped make him a big name on the opposite side of the Atlantic.\n\nHe thinks he knows what lies behind that capacious need to always be working – the inability, even now, to predict how long it will all last.\n\n“One of the scariest things I can think to do is to flick through a old copy of the Radio Times from the ’70s, ’80s and ’90s and read the names of all the people who were big at the time.\n\n“You can’t help but think, ‘Oh my God, they used to be huge – where the hell are they now?’\n\n“That’s really frightening.”"
