        "text": "Creating digital channels for one of the UK’s favourite entertainers\n\nBrydon & is a Spotify exclusive podcast and multichannel interview series, hosted by comedian, presenter and actor, Rob Brydon. Each week Rob is joined by a friend or colleague from the world of showbiz to shoot the breeze, reminisce and share stories, including Noel Gallagher, Ruth Jones, Chris Martin, David Harbour, Will Ferrell and many many more.\n\nBrydon is one of the most popular all-round performers in British entertainment, best known for feel-good TV favourites such as Gavin & Stacey, Would I Lie To You? and The Trip. Rob became intrigued with the idea of creating a series of films for YouTube and now Facebook, hosting his own channels and using lockdown as the perfect time to learn new skills on his Mac and behind the lens.\n\nTo support this enjoyable new aspect of his career, he works closely with the team at Talent Bank and YouTube to produce his Brydon & series, which is now available to listen free and exclusively on Spotify every Thursday, and also available as bitesize versions on his YouTube channel.\n\nSeries 1 & 2, which featured the likes of Stephen Merchant, Jimmy Carr, Dawn French, Will Ferrell, & Michael Sheen, have been recognised as a Webby Honoree by The Webby Awards 2021 in the category of Interviews/Chat Shows. These interviews are available to watch on his YouTube channel.\n\nFor further information, please contact info@talentbank.uk"
