        "text": "Mary Tyler Moore (born December 29, 1936, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.—died January 25, 2017, Greenwich, Connecticut) was an American actress best remembered for her roles in two highly successful television comedies in the 1960s and ’70s—The Dick Van Dyke Show and The Mary Tyler Moore Show—and for her influential television production company MTM.\n\nFollowing World War II, Moore’s family moved from New York City to Los Angeles. While in high school, Moore got a job acting in commercials. She later became a chorus girl, appearing on several television variety shows, and in 1959 she joined the cast of the television drama Richard Diamond, Private Detective, in which she played Sam, a secretary whose face was never shown. Soon thereafter she landed the part of Laura Petrie on The Dick Van Dyke Show (1961–66).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nThe show, created by former Your Show of Shows writer and performer Carl Reiner, revolved around fictional comedy writer Robert Petrie (played by Dick Van Dyke). The emphasis was to be on his work life, but as Reiner and the writers discovered Moore’s previously untapped flair for comedy, the emphasis of the show shifted to depict more of the Petries’ domestic life. In 1964 The Dick Van Dyke Show dominated the Emmy Awards, with Moore winning the award for outstanding continued performance by an actress in a series for her portrayal of the beautiful, intelligent, and slightly wacky housewife; she won another Emmy in 1966. The Dick Van Dyke Show ran for five seasons and is often praised as one of the most sophisticated and funniest situation comedies in television history.\n\nIn 1969 Moore and her husband, Grant Tinker, formed the production company MTM, and a year later they launched The Mary Tyler Moore Show (1970–77) on the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). The new situation comedy was a hit, and during its seven-season run, it won 29 Emmys, with Moore receiving four of the awards for her portrayal of Mary Richards, a level-headed independent woman who became a feminist icon. Like The Dick Van Dyke Show, The Mary Tyler Moore Show was widely hailed for its sharp witty writing and its fine ensemble acting.\n\nThroughout the next two decades, MTM became a decidedly influential production company, responsible for such critically acclaimed programs as the comedies The Bob Newhart Show (1972–78), Rhoda (1974–78), Taxi (1978–83), Newhart (1982–90), and Cheers (1982–93) as well as the dramas Hill Street Blues (1981–87) and Lou Grant (1977–82).\n\nAlthough Moore’s subsequent attempts at series television failed, she had success in other entertainment fields. On Broadway she won a Tony Award in 1980 for her starring performance as a bitter quadriplegic in Whose Life Is It Anyway?, and she later played opposite Lynn Redgrave in Sweet Sue (1987). Moore also received an Academy Award nomination for her portrayal of an emotionally distant mother in Robert Redford’s Ordinary People (1980). Among her well-received television films are First, You Cry (1978), Heartsounds (1984), and Lincoln (1988). She also won an Emmy for her role as an unscrupulous orphanage director in the television miniseries Stolen Babies (1993).\n\nMoore was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1986. She later wrote the memoir After All (1995). Being Mary Tyler Moore, a documentary about her life and career, was released in 2023."
