        "text": "ITV's Loose Women is known for putting current affairs issues and concerns up for debate. This week, panellist Jane Moore put an empowerment issue on the table when she called a momentary halt to the show on Wednesday, March 1. The co-host stopped the programme to break the news of a new campaign involving her co-stars.\n\nIn the past, the daytime show has been praised for its moves to promote body confidence - so far panellists have posed naked for a photo shoot and proudly embraced their bodies in swimwear. Now, the ITV channel will be shaking things up for a special episode for International Women's Day, while the hosts will once again lead by example.\n\nBack in 2017, panellists took up the challenge and posed for a nude shoot to launch the show's first campaign. Music icon Bryan Adams got behind the camera to photograph the moment. This year's initiative puts a number of the Loose ladies back in front of the camera, this time in workout clothes, for a new photo shoot and acclaimed photographer Yolanda Y Liou was there to capture the moment.\n\nREAD MORE: King Charles 'evicts' Harry and Meghan from Frogmore as report says keys offered to Andrew\n\nAccording to Nottinghamshire Live sister publication Chronicle Live, Jane Moore made the announcement on Wednesday's show and officially launched the 'Celebrating Every Body' campaign. Confirming that colleagues Gloria Hunniford, Kelly Holmes, Sophie Morgan, Carol McGiffin, Judi Love and Katie Piper had all taken part, she then looked across at panellists Coleen Nolan, Linda Robson and Kelle Bryan and quipped: \"From our point of view, it's about time they got involved\". Coleen replied: \"Yes it is and they got to wear lovely, nice tracksuits, while we were there in our swimming costumes!\"\n\nIn response to the launch of the campaign, Loose Women editor Sally Shelford, said: \"Loose Women’s Body Stories campaign was originally launched in 2017 to inspire and promote body confidence for all of our viewers. We are so proud that it is returning for International Women’s Day with a powerful, joyful shoot and an equally powerful message on the importance of celebrating and seeing body diversity.\"\n\nInternational Women's Day is being celebrated on Wednesday, March 8, 2023.\n\nREAD NEXT:"
