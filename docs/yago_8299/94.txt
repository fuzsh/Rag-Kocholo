Alexandre Auguste Astruc (13 July 1923 – 19 May 2016) was a French film critic and film director.

Before becoming a film director he was a journalist, novelist and film critic.

His contribution to the auteur theory centers on his notion of the caméra-stylo or "camera-pen" and the idea that directors should wield their cameras like writers use their pens.

In 1994 he was awarded the René Clair Award for his whole body of film work.
