        "text": "[The] three premises to ‘Auteur’ Theory:\n\nThe technical competence of the director\n\nThe director’s distinguishable personality and\n\nThe interior meaning.\n\nHe says that three concentric circles can represent the three premises, of which the outer one represents technique, the middle one – individual style and the inner one – interior meaning. The director’s interrelated roles can be designated as the roles of the technician, stylist (metteur en scene) and the ‘auteur’ respectively.” (Sarris)\n\n​\n\nThe development of auteur theory is very closely linked to the emergence of the French New Wave, and particularly to the thoughts of Francois Truffaut, best expressed in his essay \"A Certain Tendency of French Cinema.\" Further details here.\n\nAuteur theory poses the idea that the style and voice of a film is founded in the creative decisions of the film director; thus, according to it, the director is the ultimate “author” of the film\n\n​\n\nThe auteur theory was grounded in Alexandre Astruc’s BIRTH OF A NEW AVANT-GARDE: LA CAMERA-STYLO–in which Astruc expressed that the pen or, in the case of filmmaking, the “camera-pen” is held by the director; it flourished with André Bazin’s Cahiers du Cinéma and its critical writers who would in turn form the movement we know as La Nouvelle Vague or The French New Wave, with François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, and others; and it was further developed by Andrew Sarris and criticized by Pauline Kael. To dig deeper into the significance of the auteur theory\n\n​\n\nAs witnessed through CINEMA! CINEMA! THE FRENCH NEW WAVE, The French New Wave was a monumental movement for the art of cinema. It emphasized mise-en-scène and personal filmmaking through the auteur theory founded in Alexandre Astruc’s BIRTH OF A NEW AVANT-GARDE: LA CAMERA-STYLO, as a reading would show. The essence of the French New Wave and as well as Astruc’s writings is the idea that a filmmaker is able to express emotions and truths through his or her use of cinema’s unique language–the filmmaker is a visual writer and the camera his or her pen (note: aural aspects of a film are still as vital as the visuals). The idea remains significant today as it leads to the notion that the filmmaker him or herself is the key tool in filmmaking.\n\n​\n\nIf the auteur theory presents the concept of director as ultimate voice of a film, it too expands on the notion that the ultimate determinant of the making of a film is the filmmaker. Since debates surround the theory in terms of director as sole author vs filmmaking as a collaborative art form, then perhaps this is the most significant feature of what should truly be called a tendency: the filmmaker’s freedom to express his or her voice by taking on a demanding art form at all costs with the hands and minds behind the production as the essential tools in the filmmaking process.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nLet’s face it: between the pure cinema of the 1920s and filmed theatre, there is plenty of room for a different and individual kind of filmmaking, wrote Alexandre Astruc. BRESSON, HITCHCOCK,\n\nWELLES, RENOIR, DREYER, even TARKOVSKY represent this “different and individual kind of filmmaking” not because they were the sole creators of their films but because they approached each with a personal sensibility to the uniqueness of film as a mode of expression. Their collaborators are also auteurs in their own rights, though more often than not it takes a visionary to accomplish what Orson Welles declares: [F]ILMS ARE BEST WHEN THEY MANAGE POETRY BY REDUCING THE ELEMENT OF REALITY AND INTRODUCING SOMETHING WHICH IS THE INVENTION OF THE FILMMAKER\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​"
