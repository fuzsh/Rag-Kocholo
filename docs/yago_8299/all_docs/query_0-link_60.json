It just seemed to be an incredibly well oiled machine and I\n\nactually enjoyed the Willis/Jackson team. It almost feels a little\n\nself-conscious, the Ultimate John McTiernan Film - though, again, I've probably not seen\n\nenough of his to make a judgment call as to the validity of the\n\nself-consciousness factor I'm intuiting.\n\nAnyway, thanks for the recommendations.\n\nPeter\n\nhttp://hometown.aol.com/ptonguette/index.html\n\n1102\n\nFrom:\n\nDate: Sun Aug 10, 2003 4:42pm\n\nSubject: Body Double\n\nIn a message dated 8/10/03 11:41:20 AM, rashomon82@y... writes:\n\n>> I will try and see Fury and\n\n>> Carlito's Way. Any other recommendations from anyone?\n\nI don't think anyone's mentioned it yet, but for me De Palma's greatest is\n\n\"Body Double\"; it certainly exists at the same level of \"Blow Out\" and \"Femme\n\nFatale,\" his other two bona fide masterpieces.\n\nStrangely, it seems to be an outside consensus choice even for diehard De\n\nPalma supporters. I seem to remember reading negative responses by both Kael and\n\nArmond White. But Dave Kehr perceptively writes, \"The first hour of this\n\nthriller represents the most restrained, accomplished, and effective filmmaking\n\nhe has ever done, and if the film does become more jokey and incontinent as it\n\nfollows its derivative path, it never entirely loses the goodwill De Palma\n\nengenders with his deft opening sequences.\"\n\nWhile I like the second half of the film more than Kehr, the first hour is\n\nindeed stunningly realized. There's an extended sequence of Wasson following h\n\nis beautiful next door neighbor (who in turn is being followed by someone else;\n\nI shall say no more) through various locales - into a big indoor mall,\n\nthrough the mall, back outdoors, culminating with a chase on a beach - that even\n\nsurpasses the Cannes jewel heist in \"Femme Fatale\" as a brilliantly modulated\n\nsustained set-piece. It's thrilling to watch De Palma's orchestration of\n\nperspective and point of view.\n\nI don't think I like \"Mission to Mars\" quite as much as Zach does (not yet\n\nanyway; it's been a while since I've seen it and I've not rewatched it since\n\nseeing \"Femme Fatale\"), but it's definitely a whole lot more interesting than its\n\nrep would suggest. I also think its a good deal more personal than some of\n\nhis more respectable jobs-for-hire (ie, \"The Untouchables\").\n\nPeter\n\nhttp://hometown.aol.com/ptonguette/index.html\n\n1103\n\nFrom: Paul Gallagher\n\nDate: Sun Aug 10, 2003 11:02pm\n\nSubject: Re: My Dinner With Andre (De Toth); also concepts versus ideas\n\n> I wonder what the consensus is here on the great Naruse.
