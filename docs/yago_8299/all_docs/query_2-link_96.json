        "text": "The Auteur theory is a theory of filmmaking in which the director is regarded as the prime creative force in a motion picture. The theory was derived largely from Alexandre Astruc’s concept of filmmaking and holds that the directors bring the film to life using all the elements of film available to them. Evidence of Baz Luhrmann’s signature style and ability to transform a film into a work of art can be seen from his films ‘The Great Gatsby’ and ‘Moulin Rouge’. Both films proved to be authentic thus making him one of the greatest Auteur directors of our time. A fetching component that profoundly propelled Luhrmann’s unique directing style evident in both films was his use of music. In both films, Luhrmann uses music as a device to grasp and maintain the audience’s attention to the films at all times. In Moulin Rouge, Luhrmann alters the way the cast break into song as a method to keep the audience awake to the story. He has avoided the conventional musical clichés within the film, where the cast would normally stop and sing a song, by integrating the songs into storytelling. This integration was best seen in the “Elephant Love Medley” scene in the film. After an argument between Christian and Satine, they both unnoticeably broke into song. An element further enhancing Luhrmann’s directing style was his use of modern contemporary songs in which Luhrmann describes as a way to “illustrate the themes to modern audiences in a relative context” (Maggie Stough, 2014). In the “Elephant Love Medley” scene, Luhrmann makes use of a combination of twelve contemporary songs such as “All You Need Is Love” by The Beatles and “Heroes” by David Bowie. Similarly, this distinctive style of Luhrmann is also seen in his film “The Great Gatsby”. The film features modern artists such as Jay-Z, Lana Del Rey, Fergie and Gotye which have been incorporated with jazz music from the twenties. In one of the scenes, Gatsby hosts one of his extravagant parties in which modern contemporary songs such as “A Little Party Never Killed Nobody” reveal the sounds of modern parties, but also integrate instruments such as horns which provides the feeling of the twenties era.\n\nA part of Luhrmann’s unique directing style is his ability to create"
