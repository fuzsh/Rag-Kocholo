        "text": "Le Forestier’s hypothesis is thus that what is called ‘montage’ at a given point in time is in fact a form of equilibrium between these variables, and that the concept’s odyssey and transformations can be understood as modifications of this equilibrium. Drawing on his highly-regarded work as an early film historian, Le Forestier will examine three such transformative periods – early cinema, the 1920s and the 1950s – to lay the foundation for what could become an (undeniably utopian) total history of montage.\n\nLaurent Le Forestier is a professor in the film history and aesthetics section of the Université de Lausanne. He is also editorial secretary of the journal 1895 revue d’histoire du cinéma and director of the Swiss branch of the international research partnership TECHNÈS, on the history of film technology and techniques. He works on early cinema, the history of film criticism and the relations between découpage and montage. He has recently published La Transformation Bazin (PUR, 2017) and is currently completing a book with André Gaudreault on editing practices in the silent era. He is also preparing two other volumes, on the international reception of Citizen Kane and its effects on the emergence of the academic discipline “cinema studies” and on comic cinema’s questioning of the thirty-year boom period following the Second World War.\n\nEmploying an innovative découpage-like writing structure that flows effortlessly between his sources and disentangles découpage for the English reader in direct prose that will find a welcome home in undergraduate lecture halls, graduate seminar rooms and on the bookshelves of general readers alike, Barnard leads us on a journey through the history and theory of découpage and argues for its importance to film theory today. The authors discussed include Henri Agel, Alexandre Astruc, Jean George Auriol, Béla Balázs, André Bazin, Raymond Borde, David Bordwell, Eileen Bowser, Luis Buñuel, Noël Burch, Sergei Eisenstein, Jean-Luc Godard, Tom Gunning, Roger Leenhardt, Rachael Low, André Malraux, Jean Mitry, Harry Alan Potamkin, Vsevolod Pudovkin, Alma Reville, Éric Rohmer, Georges Sadoul and Kristin Thompson.\n\n‘In 1952, André Bazin conceived a fine prank. Its intended victims, however, innocently sidestepped it, and it cruelly backfired on him into the bargain. Asked by the Venice film festival to write an essay whose assigned topic, we can only assume, was editing, Bazin delivered instead a theoretical manifesto which challenged the entrenched notion that editing is the basis of film art and presented a vision of film history as evolving from silent film editing to talking film analytical découpage to a form of découpage that is a fluid form of writing with a differentiating camera, modifying reality from within. He titled this major 7,500-word statement ‘Découpage’. In it we find a masterful summation of the ideas found over the previous four years in his texts on William Wyler, neo-realism and Orson Welles, in particular. And yet, until the present author stumbled on this text at a church-basement flea market in January 2009—at the same time as he was desperately searching for it, not knowing its title—it appears that not a single film scholar since Bazin’s day, working in any language, had ever laid eyes on it, even though Bazin had vaguely referenced it in the first volume of Qu’est-ce que le cinéma?, published two weeks after his death in November 1958.’ — Timothy Barnard\n\nTimothy Barnard is the proprietor of caboose, for whom he has translated The André Bazin Reader and Jean-Luc Godard’s Introduction to a True History of Cinema and Television.\n\n‘The French expression “mise en scène” is synonymous with the English “staging”, as it includes all the aspects that are involved when a play is being “put on stage”. So while the cultural hierarchies in nineteenth-century France may have privileged text and declamation over all the other elements of a play, the mere scope of what mise en scène contributes to a theatrical performance shows that the hierarchical relations could easily be reversed. Once the staging of a play came to be considered an interpretation of the text rather than a simple reproduction of the written work, it was mise en scène itself that in fact became the pre-eminent means for artistic creation. Consequently, Patrice Pavis not only adds another function of mise en scène to the ones listed by Arthur Pougin—that of ‘highlighting the meaning’ of the play—but also states that the emergence of mise en scène and the evolution of its status at the end of the nineteenth century resulted in theatre being established as an autonomous art form. As a result, the author of the text could no longer be considered the sole creator of a theatrical work of art. When Berlin audiences flocked to see Max Reinhardt’s staging of A Midsummer Night’s Dream in 1905, it was because of his spectacular mise en scène rather than to see Shakespeare’s play.’ — Frank Kessler\n\nfrank kessler is professor of media history at Utrecht University, The Netherlands, and one of the founders and editors of KINtop: Jahrbuch zur Erforschung des frühen Films. He is a past president of Domitor, an international association for research on early cinema. His research mainly concerns the period of the emergence of cinema and nineteenth-century visual culture, as well as the history of film theory. He currently leads a research project entitled “Projecting Knowledge: The Magic Lantern as a Tool for Mediated Science Communication in the Netherlands, 1880–1940”."
