        "text": "JOHN RUSSELL TAYLOR'S title is an unfortunate one, which gives no notion whatsoever of what his book is about ‐— and appears to be a fancy way of saying Sight and Sound, for which British film publication Mr. Taylor is a frequent contributor. The book, however, is one of the better surveys of serious, modern cinema.\n\nIn it Mr. Taylor examines the works of Michelangelo Antonioni, Federico Fellini, Robert Bresson, Luis Bunuel, Ingmar Bergman, Alfred Hitchcock, Francois Truffaut, Jean‐Luc Godard and Alain Resnais. He traces the rise of the “modern art film” (a substantially European phenomenon with sporadic self‐conscious attempts at it in America) from the famous essay of Alexandre Astruc (1948), which called for an altogether new style, “le camérastylo,” or the notion of making movies with a camera‐pen just as if one were writinga novel or a poem. For the auteur‐oriented directors examined in this book, the collective apparatus that hangs around the set serves solely as technical implementors, Egyptian stone‐carriers who fulfill the personal necessities of the director's pyramidal vision.\n\nMr. Taylor's book is not written for cinéastes alone, but also for the collegiate moviegoers and the spectatorrefugees from TV and legitimate theater. This is the new audience that has dug. re‐dug and endlessly discussed “L'Avventura,” “Jules et Jim,” “Breathless,” “La Dolce Vita,” “Hiroshima, Mon Amour,” “Wild Strawberries,” etc. Cut off from the fertile flow of glorious junk and inspired genius of the Hollywood movies of the 1930's and 1940's, this new audience has come by its greatest legacy in the works of the directors examined in Mr. Taylor's book. Of American movies today, for contrast's sake, who can name more than a handful of personalities or film‐makers who could cause an itchy viewer to call a friend and say: “Hey, let's go see the new‐‐‐movie!”\n\nSince the basic premise of Mr. Taylor's book springs from the critical writings and films of the French New Wave, it is surprising that he did not devote more space to their real importance; their bold attempt to literally reshape the style and content of movies in the spirit of D. W. Griffith (trying out new ways of telling a story, packing the frame with visual dynamite, etc.) and, in the bargain, doing it cheaply —at least as compared to the considerably bigger budgets of the other Big Six Mr. Taylor deals with.\n\nTHIS group of audacious young French film‐makers in fact engineered the principles and inspiration of Mr. Taylor's discussion, in spite of, and not because of, their debt to such idols as Bunuel, Bresson and Hitchcock. The irony of it is that for some time now Truffaut has been writing a devotional book on Hitchcock somewhat like Sartre's book on Genet, and although technically a Hitchcock film is a wonder to look at, I would bet anything that readers of Mr. Taylor's book would infinitely prefer a Truffaut movie.\n\nAs a survey, “Cinema Eye, Cinema Ear” is straightforward, competent, and quietly well‐written. It advances no new theories, offers no spectacular insights, and only in the instances of Fellini and Hitchcock are there some new twists of analysis that would be of special interest to the movie bug. But for the vast new middlebrow audience who do call up and say “Hey let's go see the new Antonioni movie,” Mr. Taylor's book is the best of its kind around. And since I am of the unswerving, if unoriginal, opinion that a mucky, popular American or an arty foreign movie is infinitely more rewarding than almost anything that can be seen today on the stage, I would do my little bit in encouraging people to latch on to Mr. Taylor's book."
