        "text": "Ever since the centenary of cinema there have been intense discussions in the field of film studies about the imminent demise of the cinematic medium, endless articles championing the spirit of genuine cinephilia have proclaimed the death of classical cinema and mourned the end of an era, while new currents in media studies introduced such buzzwords into the discussions as “remediation” (Bolter and Grusin), “media convergence” (Jenkins), “post-media aesthetics” (Manovich) or “the virtual life of film” (Rodowick). By the turn of the millennium, the whole “ecosystem” of media had been radically altered through processes of hybridization and media convergence. Some theorists even claim that now that the term “medium” has triumphed in the discussions around contemporary art and culture, the actual media have already deceased, as digitized imagery absorbs all media. Moving images have entered the art galleries and new forms of inter-art relationships have been forged. They have also moved into the streets and our everyday life as a domesticated medium at everybody’s reach, into new private and public environments (and into a fusion of both via the Internet). Consequently, should we speak of an all pervasive “cinematic experience” instead of a cinematic medium? What really happens to film once its traditional medium has shape shifted into various digital forms and once its traditional locations, institutions and usages have been uprooted? What do these re-locations and re-configurations really entail? What are the most important new genres in post-media moving pictures? Is it the web video, is it 3D cinema, is it the computer game that operates with moving image narratives, is it the new “vernacular” database, the DVD, or the good old television adjusted to all these new forms? How does theatrical cinema itself adapt to or reflect on these new image forms and technologies? How can we interpret the convergence of older cinematic forms with an emerging digital aesthetics traceable in typical post-media “hosts” of moving images? These are only some of the major questions that the theoretical investigation and in-depth analyses in this volume try to answer in an attempt at exploring not the disappearance of cinema but the blooming post-media life of film.\n\nIt is not possible to evaluate development of the documentary film separately from social developments that emerged in the historical process and innovations in media technology. Answers on what the role of documentaries and documentary filmmakers are revised again and again in this historical perspective. The documentaries that have produced to be watched on different platforms (such as movie screen, television or online media) have important and ongoing social, political, aesthetic and technological changes. These changes include new digital production, new editing equipment, booming in cinematic features, and sharing footage on different video sharing sites. The innovations of the digital age to the documentary film world can be summarized as, pre-production, production, post-production and distribution stages. Relatively inexpensive digital technology increased the number and diversity of those who want to be included in the documentary production process. Filmmakers, activists, wannabes and entrepreneurs from different parts of the World acces to the production of documentary field in order to gain an active role. In addition, digital technologies in terms of production as well as the distribution and exhibition, is providing a platform to documentaries. Finding potential audience is now possible without relying on traditional channels. This paper focuses on the innovations that come with the digital technology to the traditional documentary filmmaking. In the digital age, production and post-production of documentary film costs has fallen. it's observed that producing low budget documentaries is possible. Although we need to consider that the internet has been criticized by the scholars about its limitations on being an alternative public sphere. At the present day, the audience who become more sophisticated as a result of increased number of media channels seek for the challenging documentaries not for the entertaining content. THE EARLY YEARS OF CINEMA Cinema which can be defined as an art form that uses moving pictures to create a narration. Cinema as a word is shortened version of cinematograph. The word is combination of Greek kinemat –to move-and graphein –to write-. The history of cinema reflects a long efforts of several researchers, filmmakers and pioneers in the field (Onaran, 1999, p.6). Experimental trials come from different inventors who present their work in various countries such as France, Germany, United States and England. Especially the pioneers from France and United States have a leading role in the cinema history. These first experiments with moving images led the way for settlement and development of cinema in China, Japan, Latin America and the Soviet Union. Moreover these experiments made by the pioneers of early cinema were the begining of the various types of film genres. The emergence of the documentary film genre is equivalent to the birth of cinema. When Auguste and Louis Lumière brothers show moving images in the Grand Café to the people of Paris on December 28 1895, the audience watched events which were part of their everyday life on the big screen for the first time. These images had a large variety such as the arrival of a train to the station, workers leaving the factory, images of everyday life on the street, images that capture various"
