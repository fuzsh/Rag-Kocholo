        "text": "Our name, Stylo Films (StÄ’-lÅ), reflects the French director Alexandre Astruc’s idea of a film essay written with a “camera-pen” (camÃ©ra-stylo) without regard to the conventions of storytelling.Â We are drawn to elliptical filmmaking, without a standard narrative arc, aspiring to a little poetry and humor.
