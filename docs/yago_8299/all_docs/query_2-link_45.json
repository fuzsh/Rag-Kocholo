        "text": "Spring 1944. Docteur Chevalier is running a practice in the Cevennes. Having been himself involved in the war and the subsequent defeat in 1940, he is neither hostile nor sympathetic to the Resistance movement that holds the neighbouring mountains. One night he is taken at gun point to take care of a wounded Resistance fighter. The group is commanded by Carnot who also wages a war of his own against one of his men, de Brunerolles. Soon after, the Nazis surround the stronghold. Under the orders of De Brunerolles, the group has to flee and start a long march across the Cevennes mountains.\n\nCredits: Director, Alexandre Astruc ; writers, Alexandre Astruc, Jean-Charles Tacchella, Jacques-Laurent Bost ; photography, Jean-Jacques Rochut ; music, Antoine Duhamel.\n\nCast: Robert Hossein, Jean-Louis Trintignant, Maurice Ronet, Jean-Pierre Kalfon, Paul Frankeur, Robert Dalban, Berthe Granval.\n\nOur collection comprises over 40,000 moving image works, acquired and catalogued between the 1940s and early 2000s.
