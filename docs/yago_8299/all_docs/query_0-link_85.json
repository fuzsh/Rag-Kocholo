        "text": "Introduction. Violence against women is an act performed by men to reaffirm their masculinity and impose their hegemony by force. This article presents the results of a study of gender-based violence in Almodóvar‟s films, focused on the figure of the male batterer, not the victims, the female characters. Methods. The study is based on two complementary analytical models: 1) a model of visual semiotic analysis from the perspective of gender studies, and 2) the quantification of the types of abuses carried out by male characters in Almodóvar‟s filmography, as well as the factors that define these archetypes. Results and conclusions. Within the amalgam of masculinities portrayed in Almodóvar‟s films, there are different types of male characters who commit violence against women through harassment, rape and murder.\n\nThis article combines an analysis of the fabrics, surfaces and styles chosen to dress Pedro Almodóvar’s male characters with an exploration of how those codes might be read with respect to the specific and significant shifting historical contexts of 1980s and 1990s Spanish society. Through focusing our interdisciplinary analysis upon Labyrinth of Passions (Almodóvar, 1982) and The Flower of My Secret (Almodóvar, 1995), we will identify the multifarious ways in which the male subject mirrors societal and cultural trends in a rapidly changing Spain during the years following the country’s emergence from isolation after the Franco years, its subsequent return to democracy and the emergence of a high-living, fashionable cosmopolitanism. In examining the tensions that emerge between pairings of key male figures in the Spanish director’s work, we will pay particular attention to their costuming as central to the construction and performance of masculine identities. We will argue that in t...\n\nAccording to the cinema of Pedro Almodóvar, to this Spanish director, the sexuality of human beings are not steady and sole but fluid and diverse. There are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer characters represent in his films. As an opened gay man, Almodóvar does not consider himself as a gay filmmaker, his films usually recognize as melodrama instead of queer cinema. This dissertation explores the ideology of pomosexuality which Almodóvar tries to spread in his melodramatic films, which later be called ‘Almodrama’. The first part of the dissertation will look at a brief historical background of Pedro Almodóvar. As one of the most important artists in La Movida Madrileña, how do his works impact the Spanish society and what makes him become an auteur. The second part of this dissertation would discuss the why Almodóvar chooses a genre as melodrama, his auteur style, and what is the difference between Almodrama and Hollywood melodrama. The third part of this dissertation would try to deliberate what is the possible influence of Almodóver’s films and the pomosexual world Almodóver has been trying to create in Almodrama. In the final part of this dissertation would use three of Almodóvar’s films as examples and focusing on the characters in the films, each of the films represent the different period of Almodóvar, and these films are: Labyrinth of Passion / Laberinto de pasiones (1982), All About My Mother / Todo sobre mi madre (1999) and The Skin I Live In / La piel que habito (2011)."
