André Bazin, a film critic and philosopher working largely in the mid-1950’s opposed the expressive aspects of cinema such as German expressionism and Soviet montage, believing it to remove the realism from the scene, but was of the opinion that a film should be influenced by the creative mindset of the director. Bazin’s belief played a vital part in the development of the auteur theory after the publishing of an issue of his magazine ‘Cahiers du cinéma’ in 1954 which was hugely influential for French cinema and would later become a talking point for the rest of the world. Quentin Tarantino is an American director, quintessential of the idea of an auteur, expressed throughout all his films such as Pulp Fiction (1994) and his earliest film ‘Reservoir Dogs’ (1992), where his unique and captivating style of filmmaking gives his films a fresh and exciting appearance that engages the audience.\n\nOne of the most recognisable auteur-like features that Tarantino utilises within his films is the extended and heavy dialogue between characters, often occurring in one set location. Typically, most modern film directors will naturally avoid having a long drawn out scene of dialogue as it is often boring and fails to propel the story forward in an entertaining manner as exposition is given in an unengaging and boring style that doesn’t make an audience express any emotions towards a character/s. In theory, using dialogue heavy scenes to relay information would be an unwise decision when writing based on a large majority of examples that make a film uninteresting but Tarantino’s auteur style of filmmaking aids the dialogue choices he makes in creating an interesting scene and character/s. Many examples are present within Pulp Fiction but the prime example for how Tarantino’s auteur style is used effectively to create unconventional and yet intriguing dialogue can be found in the second scene, located in a car driving along a motorway before moving into an apartment building as Jules and Vincent head towards their target, a group of young associates of their boss, Marcellus Wallace, who isn’t happy with how they tried to double-cross him. The main defining feature of Tarantino’s dialogue is that it often has a mundane quality to it whilst remaining relevant to the plot and the story of the narrative. As Jules and Vincent drive towards the apartment, there discussion revolves around cheeseburgers and how European countries use the metric system so there is no such thing as ‘quarter pounder with cheese’. The two characters can be first heard discussing a ‘hash bar’, a drug that is legal in Amsterdam which Jules expresses that he want to move there because they cant search you if you are in possession of it, giving the audience an immediate look into how the two men think regarding their unsavoury business but then Tarantino switches the dialogue on its head by talking about something trivial that any ordinary American would discuss having come back from Europe, humanising the two men, portraying them as less of ruthless killers and making them more relatable people, going against traditional ideas of writing killers in film and further enforcing Tarantino’s unconventional style having a positive effect on the outcome of the film.\n\nViolence can often be the difference between deciphering whether a film has been directed by Tarantino with his over the top and exaggerated use of it becoming one of the staples of his auteur filmmaking style. Tarantino carries this aspect of his style throughout all his films, with examples such as in Django Unchained (2012) where excessive amounts of blood is used during the shootout between Django and the slavers whilst gory scenes involving a slave having his arm ripped off and another where they are being whipped is used to show the horrors of slavery for black people in the 19th century antebellum south. In Pulp Fiction, the same exaggerated violence can be seen when Vincent shoots Marvin in the face and when Butch saves Wallace from the rapist and he is gunned down with a shotgun. Violence is commonplace in crime genre films but never to the extent that Tarantino uses it, going against the idea that when it comes to the theme of violence, it must appear realistic, instead electing to utilise it to either entertain or to show or represent a specific idea, with the case being in Pulp Fiction that the violence is over the top to simultaneously entertain and show the violent and crime filled lives that the characters live in sunny LA.\n\nAccording to Bazin, mise-en-scene within film shouldn’t be expressive, instead being realistic of the world that we live in. Tarantino doesn’t entirely conform to these ideals as an auteur with the mise-en-scene of his films often being manipulated in favour of visuals rather than realism. In the film ‘Kill Bill Vol.1’, the films climax depicts a fight between ‘The Bride’ and O-Ren outside in Japan with the two facing off as the snow starts to fall just as they begin to clash swords. Tarantino’s auteur style mise-en-scene is present in Pulp Fiction also, most noticeably during the chapter “Vincent Vega and Marcellus Wallace’s Wife” when focusing on the 50’s style diner ‘Jack Rabbit Slim’s’. The interior of the restaurant is filled with, light up signs bearing the names of famous brands, pedestal seating, large dance floor, posters, old vintage cars and waiters dressed in the outfits of famous icons from years past such as Marilyn Monroe. Whilst the mise-en-scene isn’t revolutionary by any means, it varies very differently from crime genre films coming out at the same time and presents his authorship in how he wants to construct the look of the film. It could be that Tarantino was influenced by surrealist films that he watched growing up such as ‘Attack of the 50 Foot Woman’ which can be seen depicted on the wall of the restaurant.\n\nThere are very few filmmakers that can be considered auteurs but those that can are easily identifiable. Tarantino is the epitome of the word ‘auteur’ as he repeatedly goes against the conventions and ideals that other filmmakers are so keen to follow and his use of specific features such as exaggerated violence has made him easily recognisable and an iconic filmmaker. These along with other features he makes use of such as his episodic storytelling, continual use of actors that he trusts and wide varying camera angles such as his use of Dutch angles that make his films so appealing to an audience.\n\nRe-draft Essay\n\nAn auteur describes someone working within the film industry such as a cinematographer or director that has such a dramatic influence on the style of the films they work on that when viewed, it could be immediately identified as a film that person had worked on without any prior knowledge of the credits of the film.

Tarantino is the epitome of the word ‘auteur’ as he repeatedly goes against the conventions and ideals followed by most while his use of specific features such as exaggerated violence has made him easily recognisable. These along with other features he makes use of such as his episodic storytelling in which he divides his films into chapters to establish structure, continual use of actors that he trusts with stars such as Samuel L.Jackson and Leonardo Di Caprio becoming familiar faces on his set as they each bring their own unique traits to their characters and a wide variety of camera angles such as his use of Dutch angles that make his films so artistically and entertaining to an audience as everyone expects a violent and tense film when watching Tarantino.\n\nEssay Re-draft\n\nAn auteur can be defined as a filmmaker that has such a dramatic influence on the style of a film that it can be immediately associated with that specific person without any prior knowledge. This person is most commonly the director but can also include actors, cinematographers and others working within a film that add their own unique style to it.\n\nAndré Bazin was a film critic and philosopher working mainly in the mid-1950’s at a time in which the French New Wave pushed the boundaries of cinema and was vital in the development of this auteur theory. He opposed expressive aspects of cinema, believing it to remove the realism from a scene and was of the opinion that a film should be influenced by the creative mindset of the director and this belief helped push the auteur theory which was hugely influential for French cinema after its publishing in the magazine ‘Cahiers du cinema’ in 1954.\n\nQuentin Tarantino is an American director that is quintessential to the idea of an auteur director, expressed through his unique and captivating style of filmmaking which provides a fresh and exciting viewing experience for an audience. This style of filmmaking is present throughout his work such as Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Kill Bill: Volume 1 (2003) but his arguably most well regarded film is Pulp Fiction (1994).\n\nOne of the most auteur-like features utilised by Tarantino within his films is extended dialogue between characters, often occurring in one set location. Typically, modern film directors will avoid long drawn out conversations as its often boring and fails to propel the story forward in an entertaining way for the viewer as exposition is given in an unengaging manner that doesn’t promote feelings of emotion from an audience towards a character or event. Tarantino’s auteur style of filmmaking is used effectively to create unconventional and yet intriguing dialogue that allows for an audience to engage with the characters on screen. One example includes a scene in which Jules and Vincent are in a car driving along a motorway towards their target, a group of young men working for their boss. The main defining feature of Tarantino’s dialogue is that it often has a mundane quality to it whilst still remaining relevant to the plot and the films narrative. As the pair drive, the discussion revolves around topics such as cheeseburgers and how European countries use the metric system. The two characters also discuss a ‘hash bar’, a drug legal in Amsterdam causing Jules to express interest in moving there, giving the audience an intimate look into how the two men think, presenting them in one light as gangsters and juxtaposing this by making them appear as almost normal American citizens. Tarantino manipulates the dialogue from being something mundane and trivial, humanising the two men in comparison to their gangster profession, going against traditional ideas of writing gangster characters in film and further reinforcing Tarantino’s unconventional style to make an engaging film for the audience.\n\nPerhaps the most noticeable trait in Tarantino’s films however is his graphic use of over the top, exaggerated violence that has become a staple of his auteur style. In Pulp Fiction, this exaggerated violence can be seen during the scene in which Vincent shoots Marvin after recovering him and a suitcase from their bosses ex-associates and is also present when Butch saves Wallace from a rapist who is gunned down with a shotgun. Violence is commonplace in crime genre films due to their nature of murders and gore but Tarantino goes against the idea that when it comes to violence it must appear to be a realistic representation, going against Bazin’s ideas and instead electing to use violence as a method of entertainment for an audience or to show a specific idea, with the case being in Pulp Fiction that violence is exaggerated to both entertain and show the violent lives that the characters lead as gangsters in LA.\n\nAccording to Bazin, mise-en-scene within a film shouldn’t be expressive, instead remaining realistic to the world we live in without manipulation. Tarantino doesn’t conform to these ideals as an auteur as he often manipulates the mise-en-scene as he favours visuals over realism. The most notable example of this style is when Vincent takes his Mia Wallace out for dinner, driving to to a 1950’s style ‘Jack Rabbit Slim’s’ diner. The interior of the restaurant contains light up signs bearing the names of famous brands, pedestal seating, a large dance floor, posters, old vintage cars and waiters dressed in the outfits of famous icons such as Marilyn Monroe. The mise-en-scene isn’t revolutionary in terms of its style but it varies very differently from typical crime genre films coming out at the same time and presents his autership in how he constructs his films as out of the ordinary to immerse the audience in the characters’ world.\n\nTarantino is also known for his repeated use of specific actors that he trusts. Prominent actors in Pulp Fiction such as Harvey Keitel and Samuel L. Jackson are also in films such as Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Django Unchained (2012). Other directors do use actors they are familiar with but Tarantino uses a recognisable group of actors continually in his films with Samuel L. Jackson appearing in 6 of his films.\n\nThere are few filmmakers that can be considered auteurs but those that can are easily identifiable. Tarantino is the epitome of being an auteur as he repeatedly goes against the conventions and ideals established by filmmakers with his use of violence, dialogue and mise-en-scene making his films instantly recognisable. The implementation of auteur-like features is extensive in his filmmaking, with further examples of his style including his episodic storytelling present in Pulp Fiction and other films such as The Hateful Eight and his varying use of camera angles such as his use of Dutch angles which all contribute to a unique and entertaining viewing experience for an audience.\n\n“Unfamiliar approaches to narrative can be both difficult and exciting for the spectator.” Discuss this comment in relation to your film study.\n\nQuentin Tarantino’s ‘Pulp Fiction’ is a comedic and yet brutal take on the crime genre of film that promises to be engaging right from the start with an unconventional narrative structure that actively involves the viewer to think about how the plot and story are developed. Tarantino’s unique style of storytelling through his varied use of narrative structure gives Pulp Fiction a far more tense and exciting atmosphere than if the film had gone about telling the story of several hitmen, a crime boss and a boxer who all intersect each others lives but in a linear fashion.\n\nNarrative structure in Pulp Fiction differs greatly from other traditional films emerging at the time because of Tarantino’s creative narrative choices, but this isnt to say that he goes completely against narrative convention. Propp, a Russian scholar, devised 7 character roles most associated with storytelling that are all present within the film and given a modern Tarantino spin for the setting of 1990’s America. For example, the princess role is best assigned to Mia Wallace, wife of the hitmen’s crime boss, however unlike in more traditional films, she is given a more independent role rather than being based around the hero’s prize. When her husband asks Vincent to look after her for an evening, she is more than capable of handling herself such as when she willingly volunteers to dance in front of people in stage but ultimately it’s Vincent who acts as the hero character when she overdoses and he has to inject her with adrenaline, saving her life. The modernisation of Propp’s theory of character roles is more culturally appropriate in 1994 at the time of the release of Pulp Fiction as American society had converted from the western loving country in the 1960s to a crime ridden place due to the increasing easy access to weaponry such as guns. Therefore, Tarantino is able to better reflect the social aspects of society whilst delivering a more entertaining experience for the audience who are able to resonate and understand the characters’ personalities and motivations in the film.\n\nTarantino however ignores Propp’s theory that a story has 31 narrative functions but not in its entirety, as he often uses some of these narrative functions just not in there traditional chronological pattern. The non-linear structure of Pulp Fiction means that there is no absentation, where somebody goes missing at the beginning or a wedding after the villain is defeated at the end according to Propp’s ideas, instead Tarantino completely ignores this chronological structure, beginning and ending in the same place during the same event. The film opens with Honeybunny and Pumpkin, two amateur robbers set on robbing the café they are dining at. Both characters stand up and begin to threaten the customers and staff before there is a cut away from the action to an intertitle before cutting to a completely different location at a different point in time where Vincent and Jules are en route to retrieve a briefcase. This has a huge impact on the audience as it leaves them wanting to know what happens to the robbers, which isn’t answered until the very end scene, when Jules and Vincent are in the same café whilst the robbery takes place. This is incredibly exciting for an audience as they are made to wait to find out what happens so that when they do, they are aware of the ruthless and brutal traits of the two hitmen that has been shown across the film, content with killing their boss’ enemies and even their own partner, they will surely take down two amateur robbers in over their heads, but Jules’ enlightenment that happened just beforehand in the plot but long before in the story creates an understanding as to why he has mercy for them. Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction conforms to a non-linear structure to great effect, creating tension in a scene as the impact on the viewer is far greater now than if they had started off with the hitmen driving as there is an established sense of direction to the film that is all the more thrilling for the viewer.\n\nTarantino has never conformed to tradition rules which is why his films are so entertaining for the audience. On occasion though, his films conform to certain narrative ideas such as Levi-Strauss’ Binary Oppositions Theory where the basis of a story is built on to become engaging because two or more characters are in opposition to one another. This is most noticeable in Pulp Fiction in the performances of the characters. There is an established set of positive vs negative forces in the film or good vs evil that can be identified, with the dialogue of the characters creating the perception that Vincent and Jules are the positive forces despite being killers, whilst people such as Pumpkin and Honeybunny are the negative forces. On screen, the audience only see Pumpkin and Honeybunny for a brief amount of time, in which time they discuss threatening civilians and robbing them, making it difficult to sympathise with them. On the other hand, Jules and Vincent can often be seen discussing trivial matters such as cheeseburgers and taking a lady out to dinner which is far more relatable to the audience and so its more likely that the audience will be invested in what the two hitmen are discussing as the mundane conversations are entertaining because they are a breath of fresh air away from the violence involved in their jobs.\n\nTodorov’s equilibrium theory can be applied to Pulp Fiction, but rather than as a whole, it can only be applied to the story and not the plot. Looking closely at one chapter imparticular, ‘The Bonnie Situation’, this equilibrium can be seen functioning in terms of the story but the plot differs from that of a tradition film. The established equilibrium is when Vincent, Jules and Marvin are all in the car after they successfully retrieve a briefcase, but then Vincent accidentally shoots Marvin in the face, forcing them to go to a friends house and call for help. The equilibrium is disrupted here and they recognise this and attempt to resolve the problem before there is a new equilibrium established where Jules and Vincent are no longer in danger from the police but Marvin remains dead. The story aspect of Todorov’s theory fits perfectly into this chapter but the plot differs slightly as the non-linear structure of the narrative means that the audience are aware that Vincent has already been seen to be killed by Butch but it hasn’t happened in the story yet which is a thrilling revelation for the audience as creates intrigue as to what sequence of events led to his downfall.\n\nTypically, traditional films will have an established narrative perspective set out from the beginning of the film, whether that be from a first person viewpoint or a limited third person, it is clear from the start who the audience are encouraged to follow and therefore sympathise with so it is key to the enjoyment of the audience that the main focus or perspective viewpoint of the film is someone who is actively engaging. Pulp Fiction’s first person restricted view throughout conforms to typical narrative structures used within film, but the focus on the experiences of Jules, Vincent and Butch rather than just one perspective adds a greater depth of understanding as to what is happening within a short space of time, allowing for a larger flow of information to the audience as we are left to piece together how each individual story coincides with the others such as when butch shoots Vincent, seen through the first person view of Butch. The effect of this is that having three perspectives gives more information to the audience but doesn’t overload them, allowing them to infer key elements of the story.\n\nPulp Fiction doesn’t conform to traditional ideas about narrative structure, causing the film to be far more engaging and entertaining for its audience than it would have been should it have blindly followed traditional narrative structure theories. Tarantino’s unique and modern twist on how a story can be structured creates an exciting and tense experience for the audience who are challenged to think about what they are watching.\n\nRe-draft Essay\n\nQuentin Tarantino’s ‘Pulp Fiction’ is a comedic and yet brutal take on the crime genre of film that promises to be engaging right from the start with an unconventional narrative structure that actively involves the viewer in terms of considering how how the plot and story are developed in a innovative manner for effect. Tarantino’s unique style of storytelling through his varied use of narrative structure gives Pulp Fiction a far more tense and exciting atmosphere than if the film had gone about telling the story of several hitmen, a crime boss and a boxer who all intersect each others lives in a linear fashion that left no room for audiences to piece the films story together.\n\nNarrative structure in Pulp Fiction differs greatly from other traditional films emerging at the time because of Tarantino’s creative narrative choices, but this isnt to say that he goes completely against narrative convention. Character roles are a key part of all narrative films as is the case with Pulp Fiction. When looking at a character such as Mia Wallace, wife of Joules and Vincent’s boss, her assigned role is that of the princess character as devised by Propp, a Russian scholar who conceived of 7 character roles most associated with storytelling that are all present within film. Unlike in mOre traditional 1990’s crime films, a modern Tarantino spoon allows for Mia to have a more independent role in the film rather than being just a prize to the hero. When Mr Wallace asks Vincent to look after her for an evening, she is more than capable of handling herself despite her constant substance abuse, volunteering to dance on stage despite Vincent’s lack of enthusiasm, but ultimately it’s Vincent who acts as the hero character, characterised by Propp as being the one to save the princess as she overdoses and it falls to him to save her life. Mia is a modern example of the changing ‘princess’ role within film that better reflects the time the film was produced in comparison to 1960’s and 70’s as 3rd wave feminism became a growing movement. Although not upheld by everyone, such morals as greater women’s rights was a popular belief in America, shared by both men and women and therefore Tarantino is able to better reflect the social aspects of society during the period whilst maintaining an interesting story that excites audiences and appeals to many inner desires of law-breaking and an audience that are able to resonate with the characters’ motivations in the film such as Mia as people know that whilst they may not be married to a crime boss, the characters’ attitudes aren’t something from an inconceivable fairytale.\n\nThe non-linear format of Pulp Fiction creates great challenges but allows for some interesting storytelling viewpoints that help make the film even more engaging to an audience. The film begins and ends in the same location, opening with two robbers, Honeybunny and Pumpkin, threatening customers and staff at a cafe before there is a cut away from the action to several days beforehand when Vincent and Joules are en-route to retrieve a briefcase. Tarantino disregards Propp’s theory that a story must contain 31 narrative functions which has a huge impact on the audience as rather than an absentation at the beginning where somebody goes missing and the hero must find them, the audience are left wanting to know the result of the robbery, with Tarantino promising to show them in the final scene which creates dread and tension for the innocent customers. Tarantino’s master stroke comes when its revealed that Joules and Vincent are in the same cafe later on, in which Tim the audience have seen what the two men are capable of and therefore dread and fear shifts away from the customers and to the robbers. Propp states that at the end of the story the villain must be defeated and whilst the two robbers back down, they are both allowed their freedom as does other villain characters such as Mr Wallace who is freed by Butch from a rapist. Tarantino’s lack of a chronological structure has a positive impact on the tension of the film as by ignoring Propp’s set narrative functions and providing reason as to why we should fear for a group of characters as it establishes a sense of direction that is thrilling for the viewer and allows for a greater understanding of the plot and the characters that makes the audience form a motivation for wanting someone to see bad done to them or succeed.\n\nTo say that Pulp Fiction goes completely against narrative theory would be incorrect but doesn’t mean that the film loses any of its entertaining qualities. Within Pulp Fiction, the performances of the characters establish positive vs negative forces that can be identified, such as dialogue from Vincent and Joules discussing mundane topics such as cheeseburgers creating the illusion that they are good men despite the fact they are both killers, whilst people such as Honeybunny and pumpkin are portrayed as being negative forces as on screen they only discuss threatening innocent people and robbing them, making it difficult for an audience to sympathise with them. This narrative idea is in line with Levi-Strauss’ Binary Oppositions Theory where the basis of a story is built on two or more characters being in opposition with each other. Tarantino’s characters aren’t positive in that they seek to do good, rather that characters so far from the reality of the viewer such as Joules and Vincent are able to be relatable, makes an audience find what they say more entertaining and engaging than if two store owners discussed the same mundane topic.\n\nLookin closely at one chapter, “The Bonnie Situation”, Joules, Vincent and Marvin are all driving in a car after retrieving the briefcase, but suddenly Vincent accidentally shoots Marvin in the face, forcing them to go to a friends house and call for help so as not to be spotted by the police. Narrative theory is both present here and disregarded when considering Todorov’s equilibrium theory, which can fit the story but not the plot. The established equilibrium is when they are driving but the equilibrium is disrupted when Marvin is killed and they recognise they need to fix the situation before a new equilibrium can be established where they aren’t in danger of the police because the car is clean and the body is gone. The story aspect of the theory fits perfectly but the plot differs as the non-linear structure of the narrative means that the audience are aware that Vincent is killed later on by Butch but it hasn’t happened in the story yet which is an intriguing revelation for the audience as it leads to questions as to what led to his downfall which keeps the audience engaged with the film.\n\nPulp Fiction contains a first person view throughout which follows traditional film narratives where there is an established narrative perspective from the beginning. Which makes clear who the audience are encouraged to side with and so its key that this person is someone who is actively engaging so that the audience remain entertained and encouraged to side with them. Pulp Fiction differs from this set structure as the viewpoint shits between three characters, Joules, Vincent and Butch rather tan just one which adds a greater depth of understanding as to what events are taking place and at what point in time which allows for a larger flow of information to the audience who are left to piece together how each story coincides with another, such as when Butch shoots Vincent which is seen through the perspective of Butch. By using three perspectives, Tarantino allows for a lot of information to be passed to the audience in small chunks that doesn’t overwhelm which creates a sense of mystery for the audience as they desire to know what happens next and how other events occurred.\n\nPulp Fiction doesn’t conform to traditional ideas about narrative structure, causing the film to be far more engaging and entertaining for its audience than it would have been should it have blindly followed traditional narrative structure theories. Tarantino’s unique and modern twist on how a story can be structured creates an exciting and tense experience for the audience who are challenged to think about what they are watching.\n\n“Portable, digital cameras, digital sound recording equipment and non-linear digital editing have had a very significant impact on documentary film.” How far has digital technology had an impact on your chosen documentary film? [20]\n\nEssay Plan\n\nIntro\n\nThe impact that digital technology has had on film since the 1990’s can be widely interpreted based on several different viewpoints. Whilst some filmmakers argue that the introduction of digital is a negative aspect of film such as the cinematographer Ellen Kuras who describes the pursuit of digitalising an image as giving the filmmaker “less control because we give away our product that anybody can manipulate”. Other filmmakers regard digital as something to be embraced such as George Lucas who prefers to edit and shoot digitally so he has the option to alter the look of the scene more quickly.\n\nMain Headings\n\nIntroduce The film and themes kim Longinotto presents – Sisters in Law is a documentary film By Kim Longinotto, the critically acclaimed documentary filmmaker who is known for her works such as Pink Saris (2010) and Rough Aunties (2008) that focus on female oppression and giving women a voice in a patriarchal society. Sisters in Law focuses on a small courthouse in Cameroon where a State Prosecutor and Court President work together to help women in their village who feel as though they don’t have a voice.\n\nShooting- easier on digital than film stock, portable, transferable, on and off, left on for long time, cheaper means multi cam\n\nEditing- cost, damage, travel home\n\nPre-production – cheaper camera and storage – low budget for the film and no editing table in africa\n\n– production – smaller means less obtrusive and portable – not a lot of space in the village, Amina divorce trial against her husband for which he was fined 6 months imprisonment or 20,000 francs\n\n– long takes causes less disruption and left on for a long time and turn on and off on demand – court trial of lum rose against manka for beating her for which she was jailed for a combined 4 years with hard labour on 3 counts\n\n– cheaper camera means multi cam is available – sonita rape trial for which the accused was charged with 9 years imprisonment with hard labour\n\nPost-production – less chance of being damaged and can be reviewed immediately so they don’t have to bring all the way back to uk – editing table too large for their residence\n\n– the cost of copying is far less than film stock for small budget film – film had a budget less than $500,000 dollars but was screened at over 120 different film festivals\n\nConclusion\n\nMy personal belief is that the heavy influence of digital technology on Longinotto’s Sisters in Law has had a beneficial effect on the overall production on the film, causing it to have a more impactful effect on the audience due to its more crisper and sharper colours that aids Longinotto’s aims of empowering women and girls to stand up for their rights in a patriarchal society.\n\nEssay\n\nThe impact that digital technology has had on film since the 1990’s can be widely interpreted based on several different viewpoints.

Other filmmakers regard digital as something to be embraced such as George Lucas who prefers to edit and shoot digitally so he has the option to alter the look of the scene more quickly.\n\nSisters in Law is a documentary film By Kim Longinotto, focusing on female oppression and giving women a voice in a patriarchal society. Sisters in Law focuses on a small courthouse in Cameroon where a State Prosecutor and Court President work together to help women in their village who feel as though they don’t have a voice. Longinotto positions the audience as a spectator at the court trial of four different women who have experienced suffering such as rape and domestic violence.\n\nThe pre-production of a film is crucial to get right as it ensures that further stages of production run as smoothly as possible without increased costs or lack of necessary equipment that aid the overall aesthetics of the film. The introduction of digital technology has meant that securing a camera with enough storage has become far easier as digital cameras are cheaper to purchase than film cameras whilst storage is practically free and a resource that easier to attain than film stock and undemanding in its ability to be loaded into the camera. Sisters in Law had a budget of under $500,000 for all stages of production including travel and gear, meaning that the availability of digital cameras allowed her to gain access to equipment that otherwise would have been out of Longinotto’s budget.\n\nThere are several noticeable advantages to the films production due to the use of digital technology. The smaller and more compact size of the digital cameras in comparison to the large film cameras means that the film crew would have been less obtrusive and therefore the people around them would have been encouraged to behave more naturally which helped to depict the feelings of various real people in the film in order to engage with the audience more constructively. In the small town in Cameroon, it is clear that there is not a lot of space in the village which would have meant positioning cameras would have been difficult such as in Amina’s divorce trial against her husband who has pleaded guilty to beating her for which he was fined 20,000 francs or 6 month imprisonment. Filming this seen using digital cameras meant the people present wouldn’t have felt out of place and are were more likely to behave in a natural way. Portability of the cameras has also improved what the audience is able to see. Unlike film cameras, due to their small size, digital cameras are more portable as they are lightweight which means that following certain people or events is possible as the filmmaker is capable of freely moving with their subjects without interfering. This advantage is present in the scene in which Manka and her uncle walk towards the man who originally found Manka beaten. The camera follows them from behind as they walk to give the impression we are walking with them so as to immerse us; a technique made easier with digital technology as the camera doesn’t have to remain still.\n\nLong takes are utilised due to the digital technology available. Whilst film cameras are capable of shooting for at least 15 minutes before the film stock has to be swapped out, certain events can take longer to film and therefore it is necessary to swap out the film stock which can be disruptive to natural events and actions that are being focused on. Furthermore, a digital camera has the ability to be turned on and off immediately which means that the filmmaker can choose when to start filmmaking with a greater ease so as to not miss anything important that otherwise might have been missed if using a film camera. In the court trial of Lum Rose, accused of beating her niece with a hanger repeatedly which caused permanent scarring across her body, the trial would have spanned over a long period of time and therefore if using a film camera, multiple changes would have had to be made; however, because of the digital camera, Longinotto can follow the events in her trial as Rose is jailed for a combined 4 years with hard labour without disrupting court proceedings.\n\nThe introduction of digital technology has meant that cameras often start at the same prices as film cameras before decreasing in price over time which has meant that the possibility of a multi-cam setup is more realistic for low budget films. During the Sonita rape trial for which the accused was charged with 9 years imprisonment, several cameras are used to focus on specific people and how they react to the events. Two focus on each of the sisters in law whilst several other focus on Sonita, the accused and those witnessing the proceedings. This gives Longinotto the flexibility to choose who she wants to show the actions of to gain a response from the audience and to create a better understanding for what is happening.\n\nPost-production with film stock is risky business as it can become corroded and irretrievable, forcing the filmmaker to ditch the scene or re-film a scene which isn’t possible in this observatory documentary as events are being shown as the occur in real time. Images with digital on the other hand are far less likely to be damaged and can be backed up easily, also giving the filmmaker the opportunity to review the images at the time of filming. An editing table would have been far too large and costly to transport to Cameroon, meaning that Longinotto would have been forced to return from Africa with her film stock in the hope that it had survived with the potential risk that she might have lost several key parts of the film that couldn’t be replaced. Digital removes this risk, ensuring that the filmmaker can be confident that the editing process can be smooth and painless.\n\nLastly, the cost of copying film stock differs greatly from digital, working out at roughly $1500 for film stock to be reproduced in comparison to $150 for digital film. The films small budget would have struggled to keep up with the high demand from theatres and film festivals, screening at over 120 different festivals would have been costly on their budget, but with digital proving cheaper, that money can be better spent of more essential gear.\n\nMy personal belief is that the heavy influence of digital technology on Longinotto’s Sisters in Law has had a beneficial effect on the overall production on the film, causing it to have a more impactful effect on the audience due to its more crisper and sharper colours that aids Longinotto’s aims of empowering women and girls to stand up for their rights in a patriarchal society.\n\nEssay – Second Attempt\n\nThe impact that digital technology has had on film since the 1990’s can be widely interpreted based on several different viewpoints.

The introduction of digital technology has meant that securing a camera with enough storage for long shoots has become far easier as digital cameras are cheaper to purchase than typical film cameras whilst storage is practically free and is a resource that’s much easier to attain than film stock and undemanding in its ability to be loaded into the camera. Sisters in Law had a budget of under $500,000 for all stages of its production including travel and gear, meaning that the availability of digital cameras allowed Longinotto to access equipment that otherwise would have been out of budget and make certain the film was completed according to the parameters of the established budget.\n\nDigital technology has allowed for many advantages when working on set, such as the far smaller and more compact size of a digital camera in comparison to larger film cameras. This means that the film crew would have been less obtrusive when shooting and therefore the people around them would have been encouraged to behave more naturally, helping to depict the feelings and emotions of various real people in the film in order to engage with the audience more constructively as they would forget that the camera was present, allowing for a more realistic depiction of the participants’ lives as it would encourage more honest and less guarded responses that help to build an accurate representation of a persons character. Located in a small town in Cameroon, space in the village would have been limited due to the tightly-packed housing and dense population which would have meant that positioning large film cameras would have been difficult, especially during scenes such as Amina’s divorce trial against her husband who pleaded guilty to beating her and was fined and imprisoned as filming this scene using digital cameras would have resulted in the people present acting naturally and not feeling out of place which would have been the came is more imposing camera setups were utilised, promoting behaviour that is realistic and innate.\n\nCamera portability has also contributed towards what the audience are able to view on screen. Unlike large and heavy film cameras, digital cameras are much more portable as they are lightweight and small which gives the opportunity for following certain people or events as the filmmaker is capable of freely moving with their subjects without interfering which wouldn’t have been possible when using a stationary film camera. This advantage is present in the scene in which Manka, a young girl who was beaten, and her uncle walk towards the man who had originally found Manka after she was beaten. The camera follows them from behind as they walk, giving the audience the impression that they are walking with them so as to make the scene immersive which would evoke stronger emotions as they react to the visual imagery. This filmmaking technique was made easier with digital technology as the camera doesn’t have to remain still as would have been the case with a film camera.\n\nLong takes are used in the film due to the digital technology that was available to them. Film cameras are capable of shooting for at least 15 minutes before the film stock has to be swapped out for another and due to the nature of documentary filmmaking, longer takes are typically necessary compared with feature films as certain events can take longer and swapping out the film stock in the middle of the event would be disruptive to natural events taking place and for the audience watching. Furthermore, a digital camera has the ability to be turned on and off immediately, meaning that the filmmaker can choose when to start filming with greater ease so as not to miss anything important that otherwise might have been missed when using a film camera. In the court trial of Lum Rose, accused of beating her niece and causing permanent scarring across her body, the trial would have spanned over a long period of time and therefore if a film camera was utilised, multiple changes would have been forced upon the filmmaker, however, because of the use of a digital camera, Longinotto has the ability to follow the events in her trial and show the process of the victim getting justice, as Rose is jailed for 4 years with hard labour, without disrupting the court proceedings.\n\nThe introduction of digital technology has meant that cameras often start at the same prices as film cameras before decreasing in price over time, resulting in the possibility of a multi-cam setup becoming a more realistic option for low budget films. During the Sonita rape trial, several cameras are used to focus on specific people and how they react to the events unfolding. Two cameras focus on each of the sisters in law whilst several others focus on Sonita, the accused and those witnessing the proceedings, giving Longinotto the flexibility to choose who she wants to show at specific moments of time when it comes to post-production which allows for a greater response from the audience and helps to create a better understanding of what is happening in the proceedings.\n\nPost-production with film stock is very risky as it can become corroded and irretrievable, forcing the filmmaker to ditch the scene or re-film a scene which isn’t possible in this observatory documentary as events are being shown as they occur in real time.

The films small budget would have struggled to keep up with the high demand from theatres and film festivals as the film was screened at over 120 different festivals, but with digital proving cheaper than film, that money can saved and spent in areas that will improve the filmmaking process rather than distribution such as essential filmmaking equipment.\n\nThe large influence of digital technology on Longinotto’s Sisters in Law has had a hugely beneficial effect on the overall production of the film, resulting in it having a more impactful effect on the audience due to its crisper and sharper colours that aids Longinotto’s aims of empowering women and girls to stand up for their rights in a patriarchal society.\n\nTo what extent can it be said that your chosen film movement represents an expressionist as opposed to a realist approach to filmmaking? Make detailed reference to examples from the silent film or films you have studied. [20]\n\nEarly cinema throughout the 1910s and 20s explored the contrasting methods that directors took in order to convey two filmmaking approaches, one that portrays the realist and the other the expressive.\n\nGerman expressionism was at the forefront of expressive filmmaking during the early years of cinema due to the large infrastructure for film that remained after the economic problems had crippled other sectors because of the impact of the first world war. In 1917, German military supreme command took control and consolidated all major film studies under one entity known as UFA, focusing on nationalist films that would help Germany win the war. Due to UFAs restrictions, independent companies that survived were forced to produce something unique to grasp the audiences attention such as ‘The Cabinet of Dr Caligari’ which stood out because of its expressive use of mise-en-scene rather than realistic, designed to give an artificial appearance with over-scaled doors and dark-eyed makeup to achieve a creepy effect, reflecting how German expressionism used exaggerated mise-en-scene to reflect the inner psychology of the characters.\n\nSoviet montage was another expressive development that came about in a similar fashion to how German expressionism had been developed. Cinema was a powerful tool for social and political influence for the new government after the 1917 revolution, meaning they took a great interest in film, centralising the Russian film industry under one entity known as Narkompos. Restricted imports and reduced manufacturing resulted in a lack of raw film stock which resulted in many filmmakers beginning to study films, dissecting them whilst focusing on the length of shots and how they were edited together that would result in the development of new soviet montage films, such as ‘Battleship Potemkin’ (S.M. Eisenstein).\n\nLev Kuleshov discovered what became known as the Kuleshov effect during his time working at a film school, where a shot of a person with no expression, cutting to different images and then back to the person resulted in different responses from the viewer. When it was intersected with a bowl of soup he was perceived to be feeling hungry, however when it altered to a shot of a woman on a couch, the viewer thought that the person was feeling desire. Soviet filmmakers believed this technique was the true power of cinema and was something that no other art form could do: juxtapose two images to crate a new meaning.\n\nWhilst both these expressive film techniques are used to create new meaning, some opposed the classical and expressive editing, mainly the film critic André Bazin. Although he isn’t against editing due to it’s basis of a films structure, he’s against the optical illusions it creates, adding meaning through juxtaposition rather than content of an image. Expressive editing invents meaning through this juxtaposition instead of the images themselves, removing the freedom on the part of the spectator to select for themselves. Bazin prefers that filmmakers use longer takes with less cuts to create a more realistic appearance, favouring that the audience make their own judgements about what they are watching, directing their own viewing process such as how long they should look at something and what they should be looking at initially.\n\nThese beliefs that Bazin had can be further seen in the French film movement in the 1960s known as Cinema verite that focused it’s attention on the realistic day to day lives, capturing life in it’s realistic form.\n\nBuster Keaton films use both expressive and realist elements to create meaning throughout, utilising expressive aspects of mise-en-scene, cinematography, editing and performance whilst further focusing on the expressive to covey meaning to the audience.\n\nIn Keatons 1920 film ‘One Week’, expressive elements of soviet montage and german expressionism are used in favour of realistic elements typically favoured by Bazin. The film portrays a week in the life of a recently married man as he attempts to build a house and settle down with his wife. Keaton attempts to carry a supposedly heavy brick chimney up a tall ladder reaching to the roof that he had taken from the front of the porch as he attempts to build his crooked house. In taking of the front of the porch to use as a ladder it shows an abstract use of a mundane item whilst carrying a chimney up a roof should be an impossible feat due to a traditional chimney being heavier and not nearly light enough to carry that applies comedic effect to the scene.\n\nKeaton’s wife in the film washes in a bathtub after a milk bottle explodes in her face. As she reaches for a bar of soap besides the bath, half standing, stopping as she acknowledges the camera looking at her, engaging with the audience and breaking the fourth wall as a hand, presumably of the cameraman covers the lens as she reaches once gain for the soap and sits back down without being seen. This acts as a joke as it initially gives the audience the impression that she is going to stand up without clothes on, therefore breaking the illusion that the film is a realistic representation of married life whilst having dispiriting effect on the audience. The wide shot of the milk explosion in her face is very realistic however as during the 1920s, there were no tabs on milk bottles, meaning the user had to poke the cover off which caused the milk to spray everywhere after pressure inside the bottle is released, creating a mess that is present in the film.\n\nPathetic fallacy is something that could be considered as being elements of both the expressive and realistic categories as the weather is natural but the specific timing of the wether in cohesion with the disastrous events as their crooked house spins around in the wind and rain appears more expressive as it represents their futile situation as their guests leave, their house crumbles and they spend the night sleeping cold on their suitcase covered in mud. Should the decision have been made to withhold from using rain as a storytelling device, the audience wouldn’t have been capable of grasping the hopeless situation they find themselves in.\n\nThe film doesn’t however neglect to use realistic elements, using several references to superstition in the film such as the raction from the women in the house at the umbrella being open indoors and Keaton’s disposal of a horseshoe after him and his widfe have been launched from their own home, sitting drearily in the mud, perched on a suitcase. The act of opening an umbrella indoors is supposed to bring bad luck to its user whilst a horseshoe is supposed to bring good luck and fortune when hanging over a persons front door. The fact that he throws it away could signify hiss loss of hope that he and his wife will ever have a completed and settle down.\n\nAnother Keaton film that favours the expressive over the realistic is ‘The Scarecrow’. Editing throughout the film remains largely realistic as continuity editing depicts a narrative in a linear way that allows the story to play out in real time. Mise-en-scene on the other hand differs between the expressive in that it’s used for comedic effect whilst realistic features are representative of society in time in which they were made. Similar to the German expressionistic style of mise-en-scene, Keaton uses common household objects in atypical ways, placed in unusual areas such as the salt hanging above the table on string and space for the table on the wall with attached plates, presenting an abstract home with mise-en-scene designed to show he hasn’t compromised usability in a small space.\n\nThe idea of two men going after the same woman is a common theme that has branched throughout both 20th century literature and film, mainly because it connects with the audience as it was highly likely that some viewers would have experienced this for themselves as the 1920s was a very patriarchal male dominated society, making this is a film that both uses realistic and expressive elements to have an effect on the audience. The woman they both attempt to seduce briefly looks at the camera after running away from the scarecrow, engaging with the audience to convey her shock and confusion.\n\nWhen a man attempts to chase Keaton and the framers daughter, the car topples backwards when he sits at the back because he is a large man and despite being partially realistic, its an expressive depiction of what would happen in reality to emphasise the man weight. Also, the horse that Keaton intends to escape on is given the appearance of a real horse as two horses stand beside each other, one real and one fake, so when the woman gallops away on her horse he left behind on a stationary horse, leaving him in bewilderment. Both these are used for comedic effect too emphasise a characters personality or their stupidity rather than portraying a realistic depiction of life. This realistic depiction can nevertheless be further seen in the film by the use of different object such as alcohol and a cigarette. A hidden bottle of alcohol contained within the scarecrows jacket is relevant to 1920s America due to the prohibition era that banned the sale of alcohol until 1933 whilst the lighting of a cigarette after Keatons chase with a supposedly rabid dog would have been a common sight as tobacco was widely available and seen as fashionable habit as there was less awareness about the dangers it could cause.\n\nKeaton’s High Sign is based on more realistic premises whilst portraying them in an expressive manner so as to show different character traits possessed by different characters without the use of sound. The film presents an ordinary person getting caught up in extraordinary events in an American society where gangs were commonplace during the time period, hiding away behind a false front such as the “Blinking Buzzards” behind a gun range whilst the carrying of firearms was legal in America which resulted in crimes such as robbery common as it was easy to obtain a gun and commit a crime without being caught.\n\nMise-en-scene is expressive in that the newspaper Keaton starts to read is absurdly large as he continues to open it multiple times as it keeps expanding, acting as a comedic tool for the audience. The mise-en-scene is deliberately unrealistic to show how out of place he is in this new town that he has been throw into. Whilst aiming at a row of bottles on a wall for target practice, he accidentally shoots a man standing beside them who leaps high into the air and proceeds to run rapidly away, clutching his behind to exaggerate the pain inflicted upon him. Keaton’s shooting at one target and hitting another target when aiming at the bottles and his shooting from behind his back and under his legs later at the gun range causes destruction all around him as he us a careless and inexperienced gunman, showing the audience that he is quite incapable of working for a gang or preventing the killing of someone. The unique design of the house of the man he attempts to protect against the gang is an expressive method of manipulating mise-en-scene to express the rudiculousness of the event as he is far out of his depth. It’s also unrealistic that all the rooms in the house can be seen at the same time as he is chased from one room to another when running away from the gang.\n\nThe cinematography in the film is comprised of both the expressive and the realist. Wide shots are typically used in the houss as they chase each other whilst a long depth of field is traditionally used throughout the majority of scenes to give a greater focus on everything that’s happening rather than just one specific thing. There are however occasions when Keaton uses expressive cinematography to direct the audiences attention on something specific. Iris shots manipulate where the audiences focus should be such as the death note given to the old man he attempts to protect.\n\nTo conclude, whilst there are elements if expressive film techniques and realistic depictions of life, Keaton favours the use of expressive cinema as it provides far greater meaning for the audience through comedic effect or as a narrative device.\n\nPlan\n\nPan’s Labyrinth: Fig tree sequence (Cinematography)\n\nIntro: The directors of both Pan’s Labyrinth and Wild Tales employ aspects of cinematography to convey meaning throughout their films to have a wide range of effects on the audience.\n\nFig tree sequence:\n\nWhen following the horses and Ofelia, the camera pans from right to left indicating that they are venturing on a journey with much more gentle and slower arc movements with Ofelia as if she is lost in a fantasy world as it gives a floaty and dreamy effect compared to the harsh and quick movement of the horses with a warm and bright colour palette that suggests the effects of the Captain have disappeared for the time being as they are in the forest which is the rebels’ territory. The use of long lenses when looking at the soldiers places the audience on the side of the rebels as we can see the action from their perspective\n\nShots are closer into Ofelia as she is exploring on her own. As Ofelia arrives at the tree, a wide shot moves into a close-up shot, arcing around her to reveal the tree, tilting up to show the large size of the tree in order to show how small Ofelia is in comparison which also shows its significance. The camera then dolly’s back and tilts up to show her enter the tree that uses the frame within a frame technique which focuses the audiences attention on her movements down into the tunnel, then panning to the left to show a close-up of the dress waving in the wind, suggesting its going to fall off, creating fear and dread at what could happen if her dress is ruined due to it being a gift from her mother and something she must wear to impress the cold hearted Captain. The camera is always positioned at Ofelia’s height throughout this sequence in order to show that she is the main point of focus for the audience to see the story progress. The colour palette is till warm as she is surrounded by elements of the fantasy world but is now slightly darker because she is underground but she is also aware of both the dangers she will face in the tree and what she might expect when she returns to the mill and the fear of the Captains reaction to her dirty state forces the fantasy world and the Captain’s world to collide.\n\nThe Captain steps down from his horse to search for any objects that might indicate signs of rebel activity, shown through a medium shot that focuses on his commanding body language which transitions to a close-up shot so that we see just the Captain and his reaction to his discovery before a medium shot shows the reaction of the soldiers around him awaiting their orders. Following this, the camera then arcs around him so we are left to focus on what he is thinking and feeling as he comes to the conclusion that they are being watched by the rebels from a distance. Another use of a long lens shot once again gives the impression that the audience are watching the Captain from the rebels perspective as he taunts them before returning back to the mill, indicated by the camera movement panning from right to left as the soldiers exit the frame that contrasts the movement from previous when they were headed out on their journey.\n\nDespite this, the movement in the next scene appears to differentiate from this pattern as Ofelia moves from left to right and then from right to left whilst still searching for the object of her desires that sent her on this journey. It presents the fact that the environment that she is presently located within is disorientating and unsettling for her as she attempts to move through the tree. Finally, when Ofelia completes her task and emerges from the tree the setting is dark and there has been a complete transformation in colour palette from the warm and bright setting as she headed out on her journey to the fantastical warm colours inside the tree that was tainted by the captains world and the effect he has on Ofelia until it reaches almost complete darkness as she is now in deep trouble, foreshadowing what the effects of her adventure might have on her due to the captains influence.\n\nWedding sequence:\n\nSteadicam is used throughout these shots and pushes in as the song increases in tempo to focus on the bride and groom, centrally framed and emerging from behind a curtain before arcing around them greeting their parents and in-laws to give the impression that the person watching the film is a spectator as the shots are very intimate with a sense of family unity followed by a series of handheld close-up shots focusing on the interactions between the partners and their in-laws making it more personal and meaningful. The steadicam arcs around the couple from a low angle to give the impression that the camera is dancing along with them in a crowred area. Tracking shots match the pace of the dancing whilst the movement matches the energy of the music to give the scene a lively appearance.\n\nA change in location is accompanied by a change to warm yellow lighting, suggesting happiness. The camera pulls back from a shot of an energetic sousaphone, directing focus on the instrument and therefore a focus on the joy of the party as everyone immediately becomes engrossed in the music.\n\nAfter the party, there is less dramatic movement shown by less frquent, slower and more stable shots. the camera pans to the left to centrally frame the bride, isolating her in the fram with a shallow depth of field to focus on her reaction as she begins to suspect her husband might be cheating on her. The zoom draws attention to the woman sitting down in the centre of the frame but not clearly as the bride is unaware that she existed until now using a POV shot, followed by a reaction shot of the brides face to show the importance of the revelation to the development of the story and that her attenton is fully focused on the mystery woman. The camera tracks the bride as she crosses the room to the mirror, sandwiching the woman in the centre of her focus. the mirror shot foreshadows her apparent dual nature later on and a wrack focus from the brides phone the the womans phone implies that the bride has uncovered her husbands dirty secret\n\nthe camera arcs around them as they dance to present the ffect that the audience is a guest that dances with them but cuts to different arcing shots, making it disorientating as the bride is puuting her husband under pressure so that he might reveal the truth.The focus is entirely on the couple as a shallow depth of field makes the background barely visible so that the audience can focus on what they are saying. A series of close-up shots between the newlyweds as they dance whilst the bride questions him changes to a wide shot when he confirms her suspicions and the camera stops dancing immediately when the couple stop dancing, becoming less smooth and more jarring to represent the brides shock and confused state of mind.\n\nThe lighting is darker on the bride when she doesnt know the truth but becomes lighter when its been revealed to her as she walks through the corridor, tracked by low angle shots from both in front and behind her to show she feels surrounded and overwhelmed with a declining sense of reality.\n\nA BEV shot of the bride looking over the edge of the roof suggests she feels nauseated and is about to jump. The lighting in the background of the shots appears romantic, foreshadowing the romantic interaction between the bride and the chef and a romantic shot subverts the expectations of the audience as the seductive intention of the bride contrasts her despair. The long lenses with a wide aperture makes the scene seem more dreamy and the scene is shot on a spherical lens rather than an anamorphic lens and extended to widescreen which makes it appear more realistic.\n\nA reaction shot of shock from both the chef and Ariel as Romina lets out a violent outburst directed at her husband that neither were expecting. The 180 degree rule is broken during the confrontation to present the idea that the shoe is now on the other foot. The camerawork alternates to handheld as she feels free as she’s released her anger that she had stored inside her, indicating a change in attitude towards her chaotic relationship.\n\nContext: The viewer gets the impression that Argentine society is dangerous and violent, with a repulsive setting and nature. The film appears to show a corrupt society with a dissatisfied people. Corruption in Argentina remains a serious problem suffering from widespread corruption in the public and private sector. However, it has improved since the films release in 2015, moving from the 107th least corrupt country out of 175 to the 85th.\n\nConclusion:\n\nEssay\n\nThe directors of both Pan’s Labyrinth and Wild Tales employ aspects of cinematography to convey meaning throughout their films and have a wide range of effects on the audience.\n\nThe basis of Guillermo del Toro’s Pan’s Labyrinth revolves around the civil war in Spain. An election in 1936 brought to power a leftist Popular Front government where Fascist and extreme-right forces responded with an army mutiny and coup attempt that turned into a civil war. The film is set in 1944 after the fascist victory as the remaining rebels are routed out and killed.\n\nOfelia goes out on an adventure, searching for her first task located inside a mysterious tree. At the same time, Captain Vidal also rides out with his men to search for the last remaining Republican survivors. At the start of the sequence, there are two different journeys occurring simultaneously with one following the soldiers as they ride out and the other following Ofelia search for her first task. The camera pans from right to left for both of these scenes, indicating to the audience that they are venturing out on a journey. When focusing on Ofelia however, the camera uses much more gentle and slower arc movements compared to the harsh, quick movement of the charging horses that suggests to the audience that she is lost in the elements of the fantasy world as it has a floaty and dreamy effect compared to the soldiers. Also, there is a warm and bright colour palette when following Ofelia, suggesting that the influence of the Captain has disappeared at this point in time due to a lack of his dark blue colour palette typically associated with his world as they are both in the forest setting which is the rebels’ territory.\n\nOnce Ofelia arrives at the tree, a wide shot focusing on her movements moves into a close-up shot, arcing around to reveal a large tree that has captured her gaze, tilting up to show the large size of the tree in comparison to her, showing its significance to the audience and allows them to sympathise with her as it presents her task as being on a scale that is extremely difficult. The camera then dolly’s back and tilts up to show her enter the tree, utilising the frame within a frame technique which focuses the audiences attention on her movements down into the tunnel before slowly panning to the left to show a close-up of her dress which she has taken off to prevent it from getting dirty, waving in the wind to suggest that it is inevitable going to fall off, creating a sense of fear and dread for Ofelia as it was a gift from her mother and something she must wear in order to impress the cold hearted Captain who has already been displeased with her, so should it be ruined, the audience fears what the consequences might be for Ofelia. Inside the dark and damp tunnels, the camera is always positioned at Ofelia’s height to indicate to the audience that she is the main focus point for the story’s progression. The colour palette remains warm due to the fact that she is still surrounded by elements of the fantasy world but has now transgressed to become slightly darker as she is now underground but also because the tree is a mysterious and unknown place for her, lacking any knowledge as to the dangers she might face inside it and what the reactions of her mother and the captain might be when she returns to the mill, fearing their reaction to her dirty state and the consequences it will bring. Furthermore, it shows a collision between the Captain’s world and the fantasy world which further adds to the influence that he has over her.\n\nReturning the focus to the Captain, he and his soldiers are shown to have reacher their destination as they look for the rebels, causing the Captain to step down from his horse to search for for any objects that might indicate signs of any rebel activity in the area. A medium shot focuses on his commanding body language, transitioning to a close-up shot in order to fully focus on his actions and dialogue as he is superior to his soldiers. The camera then proceeds to arc around him, leaving the audience to focus on what he is thinking and feeling as he realises they are being watched by the rebels from a distance. The use of a long lens shot when looking at the Capatin has the effect of appearing to focus on him from a distance, placing the audience on the side of the rebels and viewing the action from their perspective as the Captain taunts them to come out and fight rather than hide in the trees. This effort however comes to nothing and they saddle up and return to the mill, indicated by a pan from right to left that contrasts the left to tight movement that originally showed them heading out on their journey, just like the movement of turning over a page in a book.\n\nDespite this, when in the next scene we return to Ofelia, searching further through the depths of the tree to look for any sign of her task, the camera movement appears to differentiate from this typical pattern of moving from right to left to indicate she is returning home and elects to combine a movement from left to right and then right to left. This contrasting movement presents the fact that the environment that she is presently located within is disorientating for her and therefore unsettling for the audience who are made to feel lost with her as she clambers through the winding tree.\n\nFinally, after killing the giant toad and retrieving the key, Ofelia emerges from the tree whereas instead of being triumphant, her situation has become distressing, indicated by a complete transformation in colour palette, switching from a warm and bright setting as she headed out on her journey that became slightly tainted by the dark and grim colours associated with the Captain’s world and his influence until finally, almost complete darkness is reached as she appears dishevelled by the ordeal and becomes increasingly aware of the trouble she has caused, transferring her from being a little girl on an adventure to fearing the serious consequences og her actions at the hands of the Captain.\n\nAnother Global film that appropriately uses cinematography to convey meaning is the portmanteau film Wild Tales, with six different stories, all connected by themes of violence and revenge, directed by Damián Szifron.\n\nAt the start of the wedding sequence, Szifron uses steadicam throughout the opening shots that depict guests reacting to a series of pictures being projected as a slideshow, combining this with the use of a series of handheld close-up shots in order to focus on the interactions between the couple and their in-laws which has the effect of making the performance appear more personal and meaningful to the audience. The couple is also centrally framed as they emerge from behind a curtain to focus the audiences attention on them as they greet family members, giving the impression that the person watching the film is a spectator of the wedding as the shots are made to feel very intimate with a sense of family and unity. This is further insinuated by the low angle shot of the camera arcing around arcing around the couple that gives the impression that the camera is dancing along with them as one of the guests at the wedding, matching the pace of the lively and upbeat movement and the high energy of the music to give the scene a lively appearance and show the audience that this is a jubilant occasion where everyone is unified in having a tremendous time. The emergence from behind a curtain could suggest to the audience that what they are watching is a facade however, and the affectionate attitude of the couple is a performance, foreshadowing the later events in the sequence.\n\nAs the action changes location, the joyous dancing still remains but is accompanied by a change to a warm, yellow colour palette that suggests to the audience that this is a happy time for the couple and the guests. The camera moves quickly, pulling back from a close-up shot of an energetic sousaphone, directing focus on the instrument and therefore a clear focus on the joy surrounding the room at the party as everyone dances to the music, immediately becoming engrossed.\n\nHowever, as the dancing suddenly stops and there is a change in setting to guests eating and the couple moving from one table to the next to take a photo with their families, there are less dramatic movements, shown through the use of less frequent, slower and more stable shots that focus on the dialogue of the characters rather than the chaos of the party. The bride is engaged in conversation with two relatives that query who all the vast amount of people attending their wedding are and their connection to the couple. Romina proceeds to point out several groups of tables somewhere in the distance occupied by friends of clubs that they attend before spotting the table where her husbands coworkers are seated and Ariel is talking teasingly to a woman that Romina doesn’t recognise. The camera pans to the left, centrally framing the bride in the shot and therefore isolating her in the frame with a shallow depth of field utilised in order for the audience to focus on the brides reaction as she begins to suspect her husband might be cheating on her with this mystery woman. The camera zooms in on the woman sitting at the table to draw attention to her, centrally framed although not clearly due to the brides lack of awareness that this woman existed up until this point in time which puts the audience at the brides perspective, further shown by the use of a POV shot in order to make the following reaction shot of her seem more personal and makes the audience increasingly empathetic towards her character. It also shows how the revelation is significant to the development of the story and that Romina is entirely focused on the mystery woman seen before her. As the bride crosses the room to the mirror located by her table, the camera tracks the brides movement, sandwiching the woman in the centre of focus as she looks in to the mirror with her reflection staring back at her. The mirror shot both has the effect of clearly demonstrating the reaction of both characters as Romina calls an unknown number belonging to the woman in order to find out who she might be and appears to be foreshadowing her apparent dual nature as the sequence progresses after learning that her husband has in fact cheated on her. The use of a wrack focus to differentiate between the reaction of the brides phone as she dials the number and the woman picks up her phone implies to the audience that the bride has uncovered her husbands dirt secret as the truth is slowly becoming clearer for her.\n\nRomina, now clearly in distress after learning about this apparent secret, is joined in shot by her husband as they begin to slowly dance, arcing around them to once again give the effect that the audience is a guest dancing alongside them but instead elects to cut to a variety of different arcing shots that make the scene disorientating for the audience as the bride is putting her husband under a lot of pressure as she begins to question him so that he might reveal the truth to her. At this pint, the focus is entirely on the couple, with a shallow depth of field making the background barely visible so that the audience focus completely on the dialogue as it will distinguish a turning point in the sequence for all the characters. These effects are combined with a series of close-up shots between the newlyweds as they dance, continually alternating between the two partners until Ariel finally confirms her suspicions at which point it cuts to a wide shot which stops the camera from giving the effect that its dancing with them as they are no longer dancing as the bride begins to break away from Ariel and becomes far less smooth and increasingly jarring, representing the current state of mind of Romina as she reals back in shock and confusion from her husband due to his unfaithful actions.\n\nAfter storming out of the hall, there is a change in colour palette as the lighting becomes lighter when the truth has been revealed to her as she stumbles through the cramped corridor, unlike the darker setting she was previously in when only her suspicions were aroused. When stumbling through this corridor, the bride is tracked by low angle shots of her from both in front and behind, signifying to the audience that she feels overwhelmed and claustrophobic with a declining sense of reality after learning the truth as it gives the appearance that the corridor is even smaller than it actually is.\n\nA BEV shot of the bride leaning over the edge of the unnerving effect of making the audience get the impression that she is about to jump due to the recent devastating events. The lighting in the background of the following shots showing the conversation between Romina and a kindly chef comforting her appears romantic, foreshadowing the romantic interaction between the bride and the chef later on, subverting the expectations of the audience is this is uncharacteristic of Romina and suggest to the audience that she is in a vulnerable place at the moment as the seductive intention of the bride contrasts the despair that is feeling as a result of the fear that her guests might negatively look down at her for being cheated on with a guest at her wedding. There is also a prevalent use of long lenses combined with a wide aperture that contribute to the effect of the setting appearing dreamy, linking to her current vulnerable state and is shot on a spherical lens rather than an anamorphic lens and extended to widescreen, allowing the current events to appear more realistic and therefore heightening the suspense and emotions felt by the audience as she begins to kiss him and lets out an enraged rant about what she intends to do in order to attain revenge for Ariel’s deceitful acts. Reaction shots of shock from both the chef and Ariel during this violent outburst from Romina highlight the fact that this is an unforeseen change in attitude from Romina, causing Ariel to vomit because of it. To present the idea that the shoe is now on the other foot, with Ariel and Romina now reversing roles due to her taking control, eventually causing him to breakdown just like she did previously, the 180 degree rule is broken during the heated confrontation between the couple as she is now in a stronger and commanding position over him.\n\nBoth Szifron and del Toro use aspects of cinematography to convey meaning throughout their films so that they have a wide range of effects on the audience. Del Toro utilises it to contrast the different conflicting worlds in Pan’s Labyrinth, from the perspective of the fantastical and adventurous Ofelia to the cold and calculated manner of the Captain. Szifron on the other hand t allows the audience to empathise with characters such as Romina through his clever use of different techniques that appropriately convey the attitudes and feeling of the characters on screen.\n\nEssay re-draft\n\nThe directors of both Pan’s Labyrinth and Wild Tales employ aspects of cinematography to convey meaning throughout their films in order to have a wide range of effects on the audience.\n\nThe basis of Guillermo del Toro’s Pan’s Labyrinth revolves around the civil war in Spain.

At the same time, Captain Vidal rides out with his men to search for the last remaining Republican survivors located in a forest near the mill they reside in. At the start of the sequence, there are two different journeys occurring simultaneously, one following the soldiers as they ride out and the other following Ofelia locate her first task. The camera pans from right to left for both of these scenes, indicating to the audience that they are venturing out on a journey, however; When focusing on Ofelia, the camera uses much more gentle and slower arc movements compared to the harsh, quick movements of the charging horses, suggesting to the audience that she is lost in the elements of the fantasy world as it has a floaty and dreamy effect compared to the violent world of the soldiers.

The camera then dollies back and tilts up to show her enter the tree, utilising the frame within a frame technique, focusing the audiences attention on her movements down into the tunnel before slowly panning to the left to show a close-up of her dress which she has taken off to prevent it from getting dirty, waving in the wind to suggest that it is inevitably going to fall off, creating a sense of fear and dread for Ofelia as it was a gift from her mother and something she must wear so that she might impress the cold-hearted Captain, already displeased with her, so should it be ruined, the audience fears what the consequences might be for Ofelia.
