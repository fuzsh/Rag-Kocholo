Alan Rudolph co-wrote and directed this clever "screwball film noir." Emily Watson is a treat as Trixie Zurbo, a daffy casino guard with a penchant for malaprop dropping (she calls one villain a "Jekyll of all trades"). Trixie really wants to be a private eye, and when a murder occurs at a nearby lake she dives in. Nick Nolte, Nathan Lane, Dermot Mulroney, Lesley Ann Warren.
