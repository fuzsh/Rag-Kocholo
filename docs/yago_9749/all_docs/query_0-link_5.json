Trixie meets an assortment of colorful regulars: Kirk Stans, the casino's lounge act who drinks too much and is a dead-on mimic; Ruby Pearli , a glamorous, young and knowledgeable barfly; and Dex Lang, a raffish ladies' man who pays attention to Trixie in a way that's hard for her to ignore.",

        "text": "I once saw this film described as \"if Hal Hartley had half-written Fargo and been forced at gunpoint to re-adapt it as one of those limp episodes halfway through the second season of Twin Peaks\". The writer meant this as a criticism, but when I see that sentence I see a dream film, but of course that's just me. If that description looks intriguing to you, you're my kind of people. You might also like Trixie.\n\nDirector Alan Rudolph is something of an acquired taste (one which I personally happen to be rather partial to), and I get the impression that even among is eccentric filmography this ranks as one of the most acquired of them all. Perhaps a bit…\n\ngone but not forgotten scavenger hunt: a movie starring someone we've covered on the podcast. (brittany murphy).\n\n\"steak eaters are superior people.\"\n\nI ended up liking this a lot more than I thought I would, though it was still a little underdeveloped and the mystery portion wasn't strong enough to merit an almost 2 hour runtime. I also watched it in 240p quality because this is nearly impossible to find for some reason, and maybe if it didn't look like it had been filmed on a potato, I would have been able to follow it better.\n\nEmily Watson is excellent as Trixie. She's not very smart, but Watson makes her likable and still quite clever despite her limited knowledge of…\n\nThe anti-noir; every smooth line is flubbed, every trope is reversed, every conversation turns in baffling circles. Once again, Alan Rudolph tosses an oddball female lead into a world that feels crueler than it has any right to be. Unfortunately, a pretty cool concept (rural casino vacation town neo-noir) is let down by pacing issues and weirdly inscrutable storytelling.\n\nCredit where credit is due, though. Rudolph does a fantastic job of capturing the cheap sleaziness disguised as decadence inherent to state politics, culminating in what might be the most uncomfortable public handjob scene in film history. On the flipside, Dermot Mulroney as a washed-up male sexpot is maybe the most magnetic performance I'll see all year. Felt like my brain…"
