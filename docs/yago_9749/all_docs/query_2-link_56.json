        "text": "Trixie is a film production company in Washington DC that is owned and operated by Christoph Green and Brendan Canty. Christoph is well known in the DC film world as Tangerine Studios, a design firm specializing in beautiful graphics and editing. Brendan Canty is best known as the drummer in Fugazi, but he also does lots of soundtrack work for film and television. It was inevitable they’d meet I guess. DC is a small town.\n\nTrixie formed out of a passion to film and document music and this is primarily what they’ve done for the last 11 years or so. Filming dozens of bands in the Burn to Shine series, filming Wilco in multiple film projects, and working with Eddie Vedder, Death Cab for Cutie, Deerhoof, The Black Keys, Pearl Jam and many others to create concert films and shorts, big and small for the ages to judge."
