        "text": "Venturing into out-and-out comedy, Emily Watson stars as the titular malapropism-prone dreamer; seeing her security guard gig as a springboard into PI work, she plunges headlong into land-grab skullduggery. The third of Rudolph’s four consecutive films starring Nick Nolte—here merrily playing a corrupt senator—and his final collaboration with Robert Altman as producer. With Dermot Mulroney, Nathan Lane, Stephen Lang, and Brittany Murphy as Trixie’s pal Ruby."
