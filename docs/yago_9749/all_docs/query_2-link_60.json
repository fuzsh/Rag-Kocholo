        "text": "wikipedia | imdb | linked in | contact\n\nTherese Shechter is an award-winning filmmaker, public speaker, and the founder of the production company Trixie Films. Over the past 20 years, she has created a body of work which fuses humor, social commentary, and personal storytelling to explore a host of thorny questions around women’s roles and identities.\n\nHer most recent film is My So-Called Selfish Life, a revolutionary documentary about reproductive freedom and one of our greatest social taboos: choosing not to become a mother.\n\nThe film’s digital premiere reached 35 countries and has been picked up by broadcasters and streamers in Europe, North America, Asia, and the Middle East. It was produced with the support of the Canada Council for the Arts, New York State Council of the Arts, and close to 800 individual donors.\n\nTherese launched her film career at Robert DeNiro’s production company Tribeca Productions. Since then, her work has been screened and streamed globally on TV and home video; at renowned institutions such as the Brooklyn Museum, Harvard, and the Kinsey Institute; and at film festivals from Rio de Janeiro to Istanbul to Seoul.\n\nHer work is in the collections of hundreds of universities, non-profits, and libraries, and has been featured in The New York Times, The Guardian, New York Magazine, NPR, The Globe and Mail, Elle, Q, and Ms Magazine, among others.\n\nTherese’s documentaries grow out of taboos around womanhood, and often reflect how her own life has shifted uncomfortably under their weight.\n\nAt 13, her world was rocked by the feminist TV special Free To Be…You and Me which informed her she didn’t need a handsome prince to live happily ever after. With that inspiration, she went on to make her first documentary I Was A Teenage Feminist which asks what it means to be a feminist in the 21st Century. Her second feature, How To Lose Your Virginity, investigates the myths and misogyny around female sexuality, and her new film My So-Called Selfish Life takes on the very heart of female identity: motherhood.\n\nMy So-Called Selfish Life has become a powerful tool for fostering conversations about reproductive autonomy in this post-Roe v Wade era. In addition to facilitating these screening/discussion events, Therese is researching a new film about Menopause.\n\nTherese serves as an advisor to the New Legacy Institute, a policy institute focused on the global culture and impact of pronatalism, and its threats to reproductive justice. She is also a contributor to Birthgap Facts, a fact-checking and debunking collaboration between researchers and advocates in population studies, reproductive rights, and the environment.\n\nTherese recently moved back to her hometown of Toronto after two decades making films in her adopted home of Brooklyn, NY."
