        "text": "Today, Trixie Mattel announces the December 20th release date for the soundtrack to her acclaimed documentary “Trixie Mattel: Moving Parts”, further demonstrating the talents of a singer/songwriter/pop culture figure who repeatedly has rewritten the book on what it means to be a drag artist as well as what it means to be a folk musician in 2019.\n\nThe acoustic six-song album (all one-takes with just guitar and vocals) shows the breadth of Trixie’s musical ability as she tenderly reinterprets country-folk icons Dolly Parton (“Backwoods Barbie\") and the Carter Family (“Keep On the Sunny Side”), showcases her own songwriting chops via three originals (the film’s title track, as well as “Heavy Crown\" and “Hello, Goodbye, Hello”), and flexes her comical side with an irreverent stripped rendition of “Kitty Girl”, the finale performance from RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars season 3 (which she won).\n\nAfter garnering acclaim when it premiered last spring as part of the Tribeca Film Festival, “Trixie Mattel: Moving Parts” (directed by Nick Zeig-Owens and produced by David Silver) recently debuted last week via VOD platforms last week in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, and other select territories around the world, and peaked at #1 on both the iTunes Documentary and Independent Films charts respectively.\n\nThe film is a hilarious, vulnerable and sometimes heartbreaking peek behind the curtain of an artist that has made major waves in the worlds of drag, television, music, and beyond: comedy (previously created four hilarious live tours “Ages 3 and Up”, “Now With Moving Parts”, “Super Bowl Cut” and “Skinny Legend”), streaming media (star and co-creator of the beloved YouTube series with Katya “UNHhhh”), cosmetics (launched Trixie Cosmetics in the spring and recently announced a second series of products), and books (currently prepping the release of “Trixie and Katya's Guide to Modern Womanhood”).\n\nTrixie recently was named one of the 2019 OUT100, made an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, wrote a guest-essay for NPR, and had numerous other appearances throughout the media landscape including Vogue, Rolling Stone, Billboard, Entertainment Weekly, GQ, and more. 2020 will see the superstar bring a brilliant new live show, “Trixie Mattel: Grown Up”, to cities across the country, as well as release her third official album ‘Barbara’ (following her first two chart-topping LPs ‘Two Birds’ and ‘One Stone’) and continue her current Netflix series on YouTube with Katya “I Like To Watch”.\n\nThe Acoustic Soundtrack for “Trixie Mattel: Moving Parts”\n\n1. “Moving Parts”\n\n2. “Backwoods Barbie”\n\n3. “Heavy Crown”\n\n4. “Hello, Goodbye, Hello”\n\n5. “Keep On The Sunny Side”\n\n6. “Kitty Girl”"
