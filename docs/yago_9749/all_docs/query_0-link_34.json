        "text": "Alan Rudolph should have learned his lesson by now. The director played around once before with the film noir/detective genre--in the empty-minded \"Love at Large\" (1990)--and failed. In \"Trixie,\" he revisits the form, aiming for the off-centered atmospherics of his best films. Instead, he falls perilously close to the misguided weirdness of his worst efforts.\n\nOf course, the man has gone his own way since 1972, and has never let his lack of commercial interest affect his filmmaking (with the unfortunate exception of the 1991 Demi Moore-Bruce Willis vehicle, \"Mortal Thoughts\"). His single-minded approach to directing has generally been a good thing, producing dreamy gems like \"Choose Me\" (1984) and \"Trouble in Mind\" (1985) or sharply original takes on history such as the multi-layered \"The Moderns\" (1988) and the masterful \"Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle\" (1994). But his off-the-beaten path approach has also landed him in a few ditches: the marshmallowy \"Made in Heaven\" (1987) was one, last year's leaden Kurt Vonnegut adaptation, \"Breakfast of Champions\" was another.\n\nBilling itself as a \"screwball film noir,\" \"Trixie\" is neither funny nor dark. It features all of Rudolph's signature touches: the large colorful cast of off-beat types played by respected actors, the tangled, overlapping plot lines, the nowhere town, and even the central nightclub where everybody's paths converge. But, somehow, the characters fail to charm, the atmosphere never coheres and the story is just plain confusing.\n\nThis is partly because Rudolph has put too much of the burden of the film on the rather dull shoulders of his protagonist, Trixie Zurbo (Emily Watson). A gum-cracking seeker of truth, Trixie is a hard character to warm up to. None too smart, but exceedingly determined, her bullish approach to life is often admirable, but seldom appealing. As played with a broad midwestern accent by Watson, Trixie sounds like a parody of Marge, the pregnant sheriff from \"Fargo.\" But where Marge's apparent obtuseness concealed a glittering intelligence, Trixie reveals nothing behind those big, blank saucer eyes. She finds the truth all right, but only by bumbling her way to it.\n\nAnd what is the truth? Well, it has something to do with shady dealings around the town where Trixie works as a nightclub security guard. There's a corrupt politician, Drummond Avery (a rather bemused Nick Nolte), an even more corrupt real estate developer, Red Rafferty (the satisfyingly menacing Will Patton), and a scandalous sex video that has landed in the hands of their mutual love interest (a has-been chanteuse played by Lesley Ann Warren). Meanwhile, back at the nightclub, Trixie has fallen for Dex Lang, the town womanizer (a very sleazy looking Dermot Mulroney) and has befriended Kirk, the club's sozzled one-man lounge act (Nathan Lane). Yes, they're all connected, but how it becomes increasingly unimportant as the film progresses to its clunky conclusion.\n\nMuch more time and energy is spent on Trixie's steady stream of malapropisms than on any real dialogue that might illuminate a character's motivations--or even a crucial plot point. The first few times she mixes her metaphors--\"You've got to grab the bull by the tail and look it in the eye\" or \"That's the truth, the hole in the truth, and nothing but the truth\"--it's funny and even makes a statement about how language can both obscure and reveal reality. There is even one magnificent scene between Trixie and Avery, in which her inept speech and his twisted politician's rhetoric collide to bizarre effect. But, the device ends up being more interesting in theory than in practice, and Trixie's verbal obfuscation gets tired pretty quickly.\n\nA good Alan Rudolph film is always a delicate brew, and in \"Trixie,\" he seems to have lost the dash of whimsy that made \"Choose Me\" and \"Trouble in Mind\" so magical. Here's hoping he finds it again."
