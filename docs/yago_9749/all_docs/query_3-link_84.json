        "text": "Newly Re-mastered in HD! Join an all-star in the city of the one-night stands! Los Angeles: a land of fascinating neurotics who live on the edge of loneliness and despair southern California style. The stellar cast includes Keith Carradine (Thieves Like Us) as a rock composer whose success, unbeknownst to him, is due to his father's money, Sissy Spacek (Prime Cut) as a free-spirited maid who likes to clean house stripped to the waist, Lauren Hutton (Gator) as a photographer in the midst of an affair with an older millionaire, Geraldine Chaplin (Z.P.G.) as the lonely wife of an ambitious man who fancies herself a modern-day Garbo, and Sally Kellerman (Foxes) as the desperate real estate woman with penchant for afternoon affairs with her clients. Produced by the great Robert Altman (The Long Goodbye) and directed by his protoge Alan Rudolph (Love at Large), Welcome to L.A. is a provocative, haunting and totally absorbing look at life in the fast lane of 1970s L.A. The amazing cast also includes Harvey Keitel (The January Man) and Denver Pyle (TV's The Dukes of Hazzard).\n\nPress & Exhibitors\n\nBelow please find additional information and promotional materials for this film.
