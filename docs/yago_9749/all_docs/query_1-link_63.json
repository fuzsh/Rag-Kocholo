        "text": "M*A*S*H and the 1970s\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nAltman’s next film, M*A*S*H (1970), was a phenomenal success. Released at the height of the Vietnam War, this brilliant black comedy was set during the Korean War but transparently was a reflection on the more recent conflict. The performances by Elliott Gould and Donald Sutherland as the madcap surgeons Hawkeye and Trapper John, respectively, struck a chord with the American counterculture in their refusal to bow to authority, and Sally Kellerman and Duvall provided superb support. Altman’s use of overlapping dialogue was a startling innovation at the time and became an Altman hallmark thereafter, and his cutting suddenly from bawdy slapstick to the shocking horrors of war disturbed the complacency of viewers in a way few Hollywood movies had ever done. Altman was nominated for an Academy Award for best director, and the film was nominated for best picture. M*A*S*H put Altman in position to make the kind of films that he wanted to for a long time.\n\nHe used his newfound carte blanche to make the relentlessly quirky, fabulist Brewster McCloud (1970), with Bud Cort as a nerd who wants to fly inside the Houston Astrodome (the world’s first domed stadium). Despite its inventive cinematography, the film met with mixed reviews and failed commercially. Audiences and critics both initially had a lukewarm response to Altman’s next film, McCabe and Mrs. Miller (1971), but, as time passed, praise grew for this revisionist “anti-western,” Cowritten by Altman, it was a film of rare beauty, set at the turn of the 20th century in a boomtown in the Pacific Northwest, and it offered a symbolic critique of corporate capitalism. Warren Beatty delivered an especially appealing performance as John McCabe, a rather dense small-time gambler whose ambitions prove too big for him, and Julie Christie played Mrs. Miller, a canny brothel madam who loves but cannot save him. Altman’s use of overlapping dialogue and sound, the film’s patient pacing, and a lingering camera together convey a sense of atmospheric naturalism that is deftly augmented by a dreamy score by singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen and the poetic cinematography of Vilmos Zsigmond. Altman next made the ambitious Images (1972), which starred Susannah York as a disturbed woman who has trouble separating fantasy from reality. Although it was carefully constructed and beautifully shot, and it was also likened to the work of Ingmar Bergman by some critics and to that of Joseph Losey by others, it received only a limited release.\n\nWith the The Long Goodbye (1973) Altman reworked another classic genre. This time he deconstructed the iconic hard-boiled private eye at the centre of so much film noir. Gould provided an aggressively antiheroic, ignoble portrayal of Philip Marlowe, the protagonist in the 1953 novel by Raymond Chandler on which the film was based. Altman’s film hews close to Chandler’s plot, simply transposing the time frame to contemporary Los Angeles, but his deliberately provocative tone did not sit well with many moviegoers.\n\nSome critics lauded the inventive use of radio to comment on events and the period details in Thieves Like Us (1974), Altman’s adaptation of Edward Anderson’s 1937 novel about a Bonnie-and-Clyde-like gang of bank robbers. Others felt the film fell short of Nicholas Ray’s treatment of the same source material in They Live by Night (1949). California Split (1974) was a loosely structured, almost existential meditation on the joy and despair of gambling, with Elliott Gould and George Segal as a pair of cardsharps trying to score big in a high-stakes poker game in Reno, Nevada. The improvisational acting so central to Altman’s filmmaking process is prominently on display in California Split. Altman seldom used a shooting script and disdained conventional narratives. Instead, he usually worked from a general concept and expected his actors to familiarize themselves with the details of the story’s historical period or social milieu and to be prepared to improvise dialogue and actions. Altman’s faith in chance and his dependence on his collaborators was partly based on his development of a group of actors, akin to a traditional theatrical stock company, who were familiar with his process.\n\nMany of those repertory players—Keith Carradine, Shelley Duvall, Michael Murphy, Gwen Welles, and Bert Remsen, among others—helped Altman take his exploration of free-form narrative to another level in Nashville (1975), a wildly inventive profile of some two dozen characters who congregate in the city of Nashville over the course of a weekend—some to attend a political rally, some to break into the music business, and some for seemingly no real reason at all. Aided by Lily Tomlin, Ronee Blakely, Karen Black, and Barbara Harris, Altman wove from diverse threads an impressionistic tapestry that somehow conveys the essence of the American dream. The film received near-unanimous accolades from critics, performed well commercially, and garnered a raft of Academy Award nominations, including for best picture and best director.\n\nComing in the wake of this masterpiece, Buffalo Bill and the Indians; or, Sitting Bull’s History Lesson (1976) was viewed by many as a major letdown. Altman’s adaptation (with Alan Rudolph) of Arthur Kopit’s 1969 play Indians starred Paul Newman as Buffalo Bill Cody, who is revealed to be a far cry from the mythic frontiersman of dime-novel fame. Despite Altman’s biggest budget to date (provided by producer Dino De Laurentiis) and a fine cast that included Burt Lancaster, Harvey Keitel, and Geraldine Chaplin, the film was a commercial and critical failure, which resulted in the canceling of Altman’s contract to direct a film version of E.L. Doctorow’s novel Ragtime (eventually made by Miloš Forman). Undaunted, Altman acted as producer, director, and writer for Three Women (1977). A mystical investigation into the nature of identity (based on a dream Altman had), with Shelley Duvall, Sissy Spacek, and Janice Rule, it polarized critics. Altman and his production company, Lion’s Gate Films, also played an important role in supporting the career of director Alan Rudolph, whose Welcome to L.A. (1976) and Remember My Name (1978) were produced by Altman."
