        "text": "Study Area and Glacial History\n\nBylot Island is located east of northern Baffin Island, between latitudes 72.5° and 74°N, and longitudes 76° and 81°W (Fig. 1; Andrews, 2002). It is dominated by the Byam Martin Mountains, which extend the length of the island in a northwest-southeast direction. The highest mountain peaks, Angilaaq (1844 m) and Malik (1905 m), are found in the center of the island (Fig. 1). Elevations decrease in all directions from this central highland, with only isolated locations reaching above 1500 m elsewhere. Low-lying areas occur along the outer margins of Bylot Island in the southwest, the north, and on a small portion of the northwestern tip. Other areas of low relief are represented in the northeast by glacial valleys with outwash plains bordered by mountainous terrain.\n\nThe present distribution of ice on Bylot Island reflects the topography of the island. The ice cover takes a variety of forms including outlet glaciers emanating from the ice cap and terminating either on land or at the coast, isolated mountain glaciers which have become detached from the main ice cap, and small perennial ice patches found predominantly in lowland areas.\n\nRecent work showed that some glaciers on Bylot Island have receded over a kilometer from their Neoglacial moraines, whereas other modern ice margins are not significantly different from their Neoglacial maximum positions (Klassen, 1985, 1993a). Earlier work indicated that much of the terminal retreat occurred between 1851 and 1948 (Falconer, 1962). Falconer's comparison of the existing photographic data, pictures, and maps prior to 1961 showed that the glaciers on the northern coast of Bylot Island remained largely unchanged between 1948 and 1958. Glaciers on the southern and western coasts gave a mixed signal, with some showing retreat of about 50 m and others showing only a slight change in terminus position during this 10-year period.\n\nThe Quaternary glacial history of Bylot Island has been investigated in the field. Six Quaternary glacial episodes were recognized prior to the Neoglacial maximum (Klassen, 1981, 1982, 1985, 1993a). Stratigraphic relationships between surficial deposits of varying lithological composition, the nature and distribution of marginal marine deposits, and chronological evidence from radiocarbon and amino-acid dating techniques have identified three of these events as being confined to local mountain glaciers and three involving regional ice sheets. The Neoglacial maximum, which occurred approximately within the last 120 years, falls into the former category (Klassen, 1993a).\n\nThe numbering system used in this paper to identify the glaciers of Bylot Island originated in the 1960s as the Canadian Glacier Inventory Project, which was part of the world inventory of glaciers program sponsored by UNESCO (Ommanney, 1980; Klassen, 1993b).\n\nImagery\n\nLandsat ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper) and ASTER (Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer on board the Terra satellite) imagery was used to map the present extent of glaciers on Bylot Island. The base image for the modern data was Landsat 7 image L7103200800820010809, which was acquired on 9 August 2001. Although the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) project, of which this study is part, is primarily involved with ASTER data, this Landsat image was the only available scene that provided a cloud-free view of Bylot Island. Other Landsat and ASTER images were used for clarification (e.g. where an area was obscured by shadow in the base image). The spatial resolution for the visible and near-infrared bands of Landsat ETM+ and ASTER imagery is 30 and 15 m, respectively. The panchromatic band of the Landsat data has a pixel size of 15 m. The main source of error in the evaluation of ice extent from Landsat and ASTER images was in errors introduced by the operator during digitization and in the difficulty of obtaining imagery showing the glacier margins at their minimum extent, when they were not obscured by summer snow cover.\n\nAerial photographs at a scale of 1∶60,000 provided data from which the 1958 and 1961 ice margins were obtained. These were orthorectified to UTM Zone 17, WGS 84 using ground control points from the Landsat 7 image and processed with digital elevation data using ERDAS Imagine image processing software. Elevation data (Canadian Digital Elevation Data—CDED) were obtained from Geomatics Canada (Department of Natural Resources, Centre for Topographic Information) and the University of Alberta data library. They were derived from 1∶250,000 topographic map sheets (National Topographic Database—NTDB) created from aerial photographs acquired from June to July 1958 (flight lines A16018, A16047, A16214, A16294, A16295, A16350) and July 1961 (flight line A17040). Although not from the same year, the mosaiced CDED provided the most comprehensive early data set available for this area as a whole.\n\nOutlet Glaciers\n\nGlaciers centered on the uplands of Bylot Island flow radially outward as a series of valley glaciers emanating from cirque headwalls. The cirques can be discerned from the pattern of nunataks and upland highs with relatively thin ice cover and are visible when looking at individual drainage basins (Fig. 1). Those glaciers that descend onto relatively flat coastal plains characteristically form piedmont lobes.\n\nThe dimensions of the larger outlet glaciers are given in Table 1. Length and width measurements were made parallel and perpendicular to glacier flow, respectively. In situations where tributary glaciers merged, measurements where taken only where the flowlines of the confluent glacier regained perpendicularity to glacier width. The longest outlet glacier, D78, is 49 km in length and has a maximum width of 6.5 km (Fig. 1). The length distribution of the outlet glaciers points to the slightly asymmetric nature of the underlying topography, with shorter glaciers generally situated on the southwestern portion of Bylot Island. Two length values are given for Glacier C93, the longer value accounting for its larger limb to the west (Fig. 1). The extensive area of stagnation deposits in the proglacial area of this glacier suggests that it extended much farther south in the past. Deglaciation by thinning and down-wasting had a predominant southwest/northeast component relative to the more protected western tributary. Large areas of kettle lakes are also observed in the proglacial areas of glaciers B7, D91, and D78.\n\nTable 1\n\nSize characteristics of the larger outlet glaciers on Bylot Island. The glaciers are located in Figure 1.\n\nThe majority of glacier margins terminate on land. However, two of the larger outlet glaciers terminate in marine waters, and portions of many termini and lateral margins end in lakes (Fig. 2). Glaciers D181 and D119 in the northwestern part of Bylot Island are currently calving into Baffin Bay (Fig. 1). The suspended sediment plume emanating from the terminus of Glacier D181 and the presence of icebergs immediately offshore can be seen in Figure 2A. The glaciers calving into the sea have a combined marginal width of about 4.5 km and drain 9% or 430 km2 of the interior ice. A further 28 km of ice margin is situated adjacent to lakes. These include smaller glaciers flowing from local uplands which terminate in lakes (Figs. 2B and 2C). Features such as the presence of icebergs and concave marginal outlines also indicate that calving has occurred into these lakes (Fig. 2C).\n\nChanges in Overall Ice Extent\n\nThe majority of glaciers on Bylot Island exhibit clear evidence of retreat from their Neoglacial maximum positions. The larger glaciers, which extend from the mountains onto flat-lying terrain, have end moraines situated beyond their present ice margins (e.g. Fig. 2B). The most notable exception to this is the case of possible surge-type glaciers (e.g. Fig. 2D) where steep margins indicate possible readvance. Some smaller mountain glaciers, especially those which have become detached from the main ice cap, do not always exhibit terminal moraines at their margins (e.g. Fig. 2A). However, it is often possible to discern other indications of area change for these smaller glaciers, such as differences in rock weathering and/or degree of vegetation, both of which result in higher brightness values for the more recently exposed bedrock.\n\nThe satellite and aerial photographic data presented show that most of the glaciers on Bylot Island have been in retreat since the Neoglacial maximum. Comparisons are made using the 1958/1961 glacier outlines from the NTDB. These topographic maps, derived from aerial photography taken in June and July 1958, and July 1961, show the glacier outlines for the 1958–1961 period.\n\nIn order to obtain an accurate representation of the amount of change which has occurred between 1958/1961 and 2001, the data sets had to be made compatible. Because some areas of exposed bedrock near the center of the ice cap were omitted from the 1958/1961 data set, the outer perimeter of the ice cap was used as a measure of area. However, adjustments also had to be made in the evaluation of the perimeter ice area in order to accurately represent the post-1961 change. For example, isolated ice masses situated adjacent to the ice cap were not always included in the 1958/1961 database and were therefore excluded here. Other areas either contiguous in 1958/1961 or included in the 1958/1961 data set were added for comparative purposes. The effect of these adjustments is that changes in the perimeter ice area that follow are minimum estimates.\n\nThe area values resulting from our comparison of changing ice extent on Bylot Island determined from the 1958/1961 aerial photographs and the 2001 Landsat data are 5700 km2 and 5585 km2, respectively. This difference, of 115 km2 or 2% of the 1958/1961 area as measured to its outer perimeter and thus including nunataks, shows that the ice cap as a whole has decreased in area.\n\nAbdalati et al. (2004) used airborne laser altimetry to show that the pattern of thinning/thickening of the ice caps in the Canadian Arctic is highly variable, especially in mountainous terrain. Although there is a general inverse relationship between elevation and thinning, it is one that is difficult to extrapolate, even over relatively uncomplicated ice caps such as the Barnes Ice Cap to the south on Baffin Island. In the absence of a fine grid of surface-altimetric data on Bylot Island, monitoring the behavior of smaller ice bodies and exposed bedrock outcrops provides information on the nature of mass balance change.\n\nThus, if we consider the main ice cap alone, the amount of bedrock exposed at present is 15.3% (4734 km2 ice and 855 km2 exposed rock). The same figure for the generalized 1958/1961 data is 13.0% (4987 km2 ice and 745 km2 exposed rock). This represents an increase of 110 km2 in the amount of bedrock exposed over the last 40 to 43 years. The difference in the amount of ice between the original Geomatics Canada 1958/1961 data and the present data shows a decrease of 253 km2 or about 5% of the 1958/1961 total.\n\nRetreat of Individual Glaciers\n\nIn order to quantify the rate of glacial retreat, four of the larger glaciers on Bylot Island have been examined using aerial photographs from 1958/1961 (Fig. 5). Aerial photographs along flight line A17040 were acquired on 23 July 1961 and those along flight line A16294 on 28 August 1958. The amount of retreat and the area lost from the snout have been derived by comparing the Landsat ETM+ panchromatic data and aerial photographs (Table 2). Measurements were taken using a line trending subparallel to the direction of ice flow, extending from the furthest present ice position to the 1958/1961 and Neoglacial moraine systems, thus yielding minimum retreat estimates. Co-registration errors were avoided by measuring areas and lengths within rather than between images.\n\nTable 2\n\nDecreases in glacier terminus from the Neoglacial maximum to the mid-20th century to 2001 (Fig. 5). The glaciers are located in Figure 1.\n\nAll four glaciers shown in Figure 5 have been in retreat since the Neoglacial maximum. Glaciers C55, C79, and Kaparoqtalik (A17) have lost more than twice the area in their snout regions during the 40/43 years from 1958/1961 to 2001 than in the 77/80 years from the Neoglacial maximum to 1958/1961 (Figs. 5A, 5B, and 5D). This is not so for Sermilik Glacier (B37), which exhibits a relatively equal change in area throughout the interval from the Neoglacial maximum to 2001 (Fig. 5C). However, this may be because Sermilik Glacier ends in the sea and therefore loses mass by calving as well as surface melting. Aerial photographs show that calving was active in 1958. This may be extended back to 1948 through the observations of Falconer (1962), who indicated that there were no marked changes during the 10-year interval from 1948 to 1958. The discontinuous moraine pattern and proximity to the coastline suggests that calving was also likely to be occurring during the Neoglacial maximum (Fig. 5C).\n\nThe age of the Neoglacial maximum on Bylot Island is known only roughly due to the difficulty of absolute dating. Two radiocarbon dates have been obtained from Neoglacial moraines on the island. DiLabio and Shilts (1979) reported a peat sequence overlain by Neoglacial moraine dated at 450 ± 70 yr BP. A radiocarbon date of 120 ± 80 yr BP was obtained from twigs found within Neoglacial moraines at an elevation of 80 m from Glacier C79 (Klassen, 1993a). Lichenometric data have also been used to constrain Neoglacial age estimates farther south on Baffin Island (Fig. 1). Neoglacial moraines along the western Barnes Ice Cap and on Cumberland Peninsula were interpreted to be less than 100 years old (Andrews and Barnett, 1979; Davis, 1985). Although we cannot confirm the correlation between the more southerly Neoglacial moraines and those on Bylot Island, the radiocarbon date of 120 ± 80 yr BP and the lichenometric data of <100 yr are in approximate agreement. Radiocarbon ages from organic matter within moraines pre-date the period of glacial advance, whereas lichen growth post-dates it (Davis, 1985). An age of 120 years ago is therefore assumed here in further calculations involving the timing of retreat from Neoglacial terminal moraines.\n\nLinear retreat distances from the Neoglacial maximum varied from 0.9 to 1.8 km for the four glaciers. Again, the majority of retreat occurred from 1958/1961 onwards (Table 2). Kaparoqtalik Glacier showed the largest retreat distance of 1.8 km, 83% of which occurred since 1958. These values were 72, 69, and 66% for Glacier C55, Glacier C79, and Sermilik Glacier, respectively. The values are representative of the larger non-surging glaciers on the southern and southwestern coasts of Bylot Island. Other large glaciers in this area have retreated between 1 and 1.5 km. The average rate of retreat for the four glaciers shown in Figure 5 during the interval between the aerial photographic data and the 2001 Landsat imagery was 23 m yr−1. Kaparoqtalik Glacier exhibited the highest rate, 34 m yr−1. This contrasts with average retreat rates of about 4 m yr−1 from the Neoglacial maximum to the time of the aerial photographic data and 11 m yr−1 from the Neoglacial maximum to 2001. Overall, retreat from the Neoglacial maximum to present was approximately half that of the mid-20th century to today (Table 2)."
