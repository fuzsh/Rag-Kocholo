However, limited research has been conducted to examine the impact of the pandemic on anthropogenic emissions over urban land use types, and their relation to socioeconomic characteristics. Anthropogenic heat, as the main contributor to the urban temperature, is changed by the sudden halt imposed by COVID-19 lockdowns. This study thus focuses on previously under-explored urban thermal environments by quantifying the impact of COVID-19 on urban thermal environments across different land-use types and related socioeconomic drivers in Edmonton, Canada. Using Landsat images, we quantified and mapped the spatial pattern of land surface temperature (LST) for business, industrial, and residential land use areas during both the pandemic lockdown and pre-pandemic periods in the study area. Results show that temperature declined in business and industrial areas and increased in residential areas during the pandemic lockdown. Canadian census and housing price data were then used to identify the potential drivers behind the LST anomaly of residential land use. The most important variables that affected LST during the lockdown were found to be median housing price, visible minority population, postsecondary degree, and median income. This study adds to the expanding body of literature about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by providing unique insights into the effect of lockdown on a city’s thermal environments across different land use types and highlights critical issues of socioeconomic inequalities, which is useful for future heat mitigating and health equity-informed responses.\n\nKeywords: COVID-19 Lockdown, Landsat, Land Surface Temperature, Urban Environments, Census Data\n\nHighlights\n\nThe effect of COVID-19 induced lockdown created an anomaly in the urban thermal environment across different land use types.\n\nThe change in the temperature’s spatial pattern suggests the weekday relocation of human activities from business and industrial areas to the residential zone.\n\nThe most important variables that affected rooftop temperature during lockdown were median housing price, visible minority populations, postsecondary degree, and median income.\n\nThe negative relationship between the visible minority population and Land Surface Temperature (LST) indicated that a community with the highest ethnocultural concentration had a lower chance of remote working and thus was more susceptible to COVID-19 exposure.\n\nWorking with publicly available remote sensing and socioeconomic data, this study provides a cost-effective way of investigating human-thermal environment interactions.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe COVID-19 lockdown restrictions involving the closure of non-essential businesses and schools, and the requirement to work remotely had major impacts on the daily operations of cities. The sudden halt in urban activities created a sharp drop in fossil fuel combustion (Jain and Sharma 2020), decreased energy use in business and industrial areas (Cai et al. 2021), and increased electricity and hot water consumption in residential land use during the daytime (Chen et al. 2020; Edomah and Ndulue 2020; Rouleau and Gosselin 2021). This altered both the magnitude and the spatial pattern of the urban anthropogenic heat emission, which in turn created an anomaly in the spatial pattern of the rooftop thermal emission that can be captured by the land surface temperature (LST) from satellite remote sensing imageries (Chakraborty et al. 2019; Liu et al. 2022; Parida et al., 2021; Pal et al. 2021; Nanda et al. 2021). However, to our knowledge, no studies have determined the mechanism behind the fluctuations in LST across different land use types during the pandemic lockdowns.\n\nThis study is designed to provide a unique scope to fill the gap in understanding the effect of COVID-19 lockdowns on the urban thermal environment across different land use types, and its underlying inequality phenomenon in Edmonton, Alberta’s capital city in Canada. Affected by an abrupt rise in COVID-19 cases, Edmonton entered a lockdown period between November 24, 2020, and January 15, 2021 (Fig. ). The provincial-wide measures banned indoor and outdoor social gatherings, closed non-essential businesses, and encouraged employees to work from home. This sudden halt in urban activities is expected to change the spatial pattern of anthropogenic emissions.\n\nEdmonton is selected as the study area for three reasons. First, it has a distinct and clear spatial distribution of business, industrial, and residential land use types, which is suitable for the research question of delineating LST based on land use. Second, Edmonton has large variations in socioeconomic statuses based on ethnicity, income, and education level, which aids in the identification of drivers behind the residential LST variation. Lastly, Edmonton is a typical middle-sized city in North America, which makes this research representative. The study result could be applied to a broader scale in future urban thermal management of similar-sized cities.\n\nIn specific, the aim of this study is to address the following research questions:\n\nTo what extent did the COVID-19 lockdown impact the urban thermal environment, and how did these impacts vary across different land-use types?\n\nWhat were the underlying socioeconomic variables that drove the thermal spatial patterns?\n\nIn this study, LST data with a spatial resolution of 100 meters of pre-pandemic and during the lockdown period are taken from the publicly available Landsat 8 images, the socioeconomic data from the Edmonton Open Portal and Canadian Census data, and their links are analyzed through random forest regression. LST extracted from satellite imagery is a cost-effective and efficient method to monitor surface radiation and energy exchange (Weng 2009). From a methodology perspective, this study bridges remote sensing, machine learning, and social science by linking the changes in the thermal environment to socioeconomic variables using random forest modelling, under the context of a global pandemic. The new knowledge added by this study is crucial for highlighting the contribution of different urban land use on the thermal environment, as well as addressing future health inequality issues.\n\nLiterature Review\n\nUrban thermal environment and its influencing factors in mid-latitude to high-latitude cities\n\nEnergy consumption and emission, together with urban physical factors such as impervious surface coverage, urban size, urban morphology and building materials affect the urban thermal environment. The impervious surface that warms the urban surface by trapping, storing, and emitting more heat, is the primary driver for urban surface warming in mid-latitudes to high-latitude cities (Zhang et al. 2010; Imhoff et al. 2010). For instance, Coseo and Larsen (2014) found that the variations in the impervious surface area explain around 80% of the variation in LST for mid-latitude cities surrounded by forests across the continental US. The decrease in green space and increase in the impervious surface area related to the expansion of the urban size is positively and significantly related to LST (Clinton and Gong. 2013; Imhoff et al. 2010). Some researchers believe that a larger metropolitan area is associated with more urban pollution and anthropogenic heat release, which amplifies the greenhouse effect of the city and ultimately increases the urban heat differentials (Clinton and Gong 2013), while others connect city size with fractality and anisometry; the more compact (high fractal dimension), and the less stretched (small anisometry) the cities are, the warmer the surface temperature (Zhou et al. 2018). Urban morphology is another crucial aspect that affects the near-surface temperature of a city. The shape and density of the urban landscape and the material used impact the urban thermal environment through variation at different albedo, surface roughness, thermal capacity and thermal conductivity, and aerodynamic resistance (Yang et al. 2017). Studies found a positive correlation between urban morphology and LST (Heinl et al. 2015; Peng et al. 2011; Zhou et al. 2014), but the relationship is insignificant and even weak for cities located at a higher latitude with snowy climatic and dry winter conditions. A study conducted by Debbage and Shepherd (2015) concluded that the contiguity of urban buildings, regardless of their density, was the primary driver responsible for warming urban surfaces. Specifically, high-altitude cities receive less solar radiation, and buildings form more shadow because of the lower solar altitude in winter daytime, which reduces the amount of shortwave radiation and thus has a weak effect on the local LST (Yang et al. 2017). Lastly, urban building materials, including asphalt, tile, and concrete, have high heat flux and thermal inertia and influence the urban thermal environment (Debbage and Shepherd 2015).\n\nUrban thermal environment and its influencing socioeconomic factors\n\nSocioeconomic parameters are also related to the urban thermal environment. For example, the factors such as income (Chakraborty et al. 2019; Hsu et al. 2021; Huang et al. 2011), population density (Zhang and Wang 2008), education level (Borden and Cutter 2008), and ethnicity (Vaidyanathan et al. 2020) have an impact on intracity surface temperature fluctuation. LST inequality is found to positively correlate with the degree of income segregation, of which lower-income groups are more susceptible to a greater near-surface temperature fluctuation. This is because poorer neighbourhoods are more likely to cluster within a location of more built-up structures with higher thermal mass, a higher degree of urbanization, higher anthropogenic heat flux, and lower vegetation cover (Chakraborty et al. 2019). Although policymakers tried to even the temperature difference by increasing tree coverage in lower-income communities, the outcome does not necessarily benefit the poorer population since the increase of greenspace also boosts the property value and the aesthetic attractiveness of the neighbourhood. As a result, the housing price increase likely displaces the vulnerable residents the policy intended to support (Wolch et al. 2014). Population density is also positively correlated with LST, because highly populated areas consist primarily of apartments near asphalt pavements, busy highways, or areas of proximity to the industrial sector (Zhang and Wang 2008). Residents within these areas are subject to a higher noise and air pollution level, with less social support resources and little to no green space access compared to neighbourhoods of lower population density (Harlan et al. 2006). On the contrary, the intracity temperature fluctuation decreases as the level of education received increases, mainly because education level is known to be highly correlated with income level (Borden and Cutter 2008). On the other hand, ethnicity is negatively related to urban temperature (Vaidyanathan et al. 2020). Similar to income, minority groups are more susceptible to urban temperature stress due to the combined effects of a lower income level compared to the white population (Hsu et al. 2021), a more populated and less green neighbourhood (Wolch et al. 2014), and less access to air conditioning or heater (Harlan et al. 2006). Also, the exclusion or low engagement rate of Aboriginal and minority populations during policymaking may have overlooked or ignored issues experienced by these groups, thus less likely to be tackled and contributed to the uneven spatial distribution of urban temperature (Satorras et al. 2020).\n\nThe impact of COVID-19-induced lockdown on the urban thermal environment and urban residents\n\nThe mandate to confine the spread of COVID-19 caused the reconfiguration of daily activities at home. This, on the one hand, eased the city’s pressure caused by intense thermal emissions in the industrial and commercial areas; on the other hand, however, it displaced the burden on the residential land use type, which in term created inequality issues based on social status, and affected the mental and physical health of residents, along with potential environmental problems. A few studies confirmed the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on urban thermal environments. For example, Liu et al. (2022) found that lockdown restrictions led to a decline in the magnitude of urban heat islands in Chinese cities during lockdowns by exploring large ground air temperature measurements and 1 km MODIS LST images. Parida et al., (2021) discovered that the lockdown reduced the LST by 1 −2 °C over Europe and North America using 1 km MODIS LST images and station-based air temperature measurements. Chakraborty et al. (2019) found that the 382 urban clusters saw a decrease in temperature of −1.76 K in the daytime during the COVID-19 lockdown period in India. These findings demonstrated that the human waste heat term is a strong contributor to urban thermal environments (Shepherd 2022), based on data from satellite land surface data with a coarse spatial resolution (1 km), enabling analysis over large geographical areas. It would be instructive to further investigate the impact of the lockdown restrictions on different urban land use types (e.g., industry, business, and residential) using finer spatial resolution satellite thermal data, and study their individual contributions to urban thermal environments.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has reported an increase in domestic violence by up to 50% in some countries due to long-term confinement in homes (WHO, 2020). Also, the level of mental distress rose by more than 10% during the lockdown period in the UK, especially for women and people living with young children (Pierce et al. 2020). From the physical health aspect, confinement at home increased non-communicable diseases (NCDs), especially for minority ethnic groups, disadvantaged and marginalized communities, and neighbourhoods of lower socioeconomic status (Bambra et al. 2020). These marginalized groups tend to live in areas with higher socioeconomic deprivation and have lower access to health care even within a universal healthcare system (Todd et al. 2015). Additionally, these groups have a greater chance of occupational inequalities in exposure to adverse working conditions (long shifts, low-skilled tasks, low wages, and higher working environment hazards). They are primarily in the essential industry and thus are more likely to have onsite work and less likely to be at home during a lockdown period (Bambra et al. 2020). From the environmental aspect, the continued presence in homes intensified indoor activities and increased demand for energy, water, food, heating/cooling, space for working and studying, and increased the burden on households of a lower income level, lower house quality, and population with existing health conditions. Therefore, vulnerable populations are likely to be more susceptible to greater indoor pollution due to high concentrations of volatile particle compounds, increased greenhouse gas emissions due to poor ventilation or heating system, lower tree coverage within the neighbour (Lebel et al. 2022; Teschner et al. 2020)\n\nIn conclusion, the pandemic lockdowns caused an unprecedented change in the urban thermal environment and modified the daily patterns of urban residences. Using satellite remote sensing techniques, the rooftop thermal emission represented by LST was captured before and during the lockdown period, which provided an opportunity to study spatially explicated changes in urban anthropogenic emission patterns based on land use (Chakraborty et al. 2019; Liu et al. 2022; Parida et al., 2021; Pal et al. 2021; Nanda et al. 2021). However, to date, no studies have investigated the mechanism behind the fluctuations in LST during the pandemic based on urban land use types. By addressing this research gap, our study seeks to provide insights into the complex interplay between urban land use patterns and thermal conditions, which can inform the development of effective urban planning and management strategies to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic on the urban environment and public health.\n\nMethodology\n\nStudy area\n\nThe study area, Edmonton (53°32’ north latitude and 113°29’ west longitude, Fig. ), has a humid continental climate with cold winters and a long snow season. Temperature falls below −20 °C for an average of 24.6 days in the winter, and snow depths of greater than 1 cm occur about 141 days each year. The city has a land area of 765.61 square kilometers and is the center of the oil and gas industry. Edmonton is ranked fifth based on the national population, with a population of 1.01 million in 2021. Edmonton’s demographic comprises 40.3% visible minorities and 5.84% of Aboriginal population (Statistics Canada 2021). Most of the visible minority population resides around the city’s edges, whereas Aboriginal population is mainly concentrated around the city center. Edmonton is dominant for residential land use (green colour in Fig. ), with business land use sparsely distributed over the city (pink colour in Fig. ) and industrial land use mostly seen in the northwest and southeast parts of the city (blue colour in Fig. ).\n\nData collection\n\nRemote sensing LST imagery from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) publicly available Landsat 8 Collection 2 Level 2 data archive (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) was selected based on cloud coverage of less than 30%, within the winter period (November to January) of the last two decades. The Collection 2 Level 2 data from the USGS were used because they are both atmospherically and geometrically corrected, and contain the LST product in Band 10 (Malakar et al., 2018; Micijevic, 2021). Due to the sun-synchronous property of Landsat satellites, the time of acquisition for all images was around noon locally. The cloud-free images were further filtered using air temperature and snow cover data to ensure data consistency and minimize the noise caused by different daily weather conditions between study dates. The in-situ hourly air temperatures (at noon locally) were obtained from four meteorological stations (Namao Awos, Oliver AGDM, Blatchford, and the South Campus station) located across the city (Fig. , Table ). Snow coverage conditions from the Government of Canada’s historical climatic data (https://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/) were compared to eliminate potential temperature differences caused by the endothermic or exothermic of distinctive snow phases. As a result, November 20, 2019 (11:35:50 local time, 18:35:50 UTC, Wednesday, pre-pandemic period), and December 1, 2020 (11:29:41 local time, 18:29:41 UTC, Tuesday, lockdown period) were selected for further analysis as these dates exhibited the slightest ground temperature differences and displayed similar snow cover conditions.\n\nTable 1\n\n2019/11/20 (Pre-pandemic)2020/12/01 (Lockdown)NAMAO AWOS A−2.9 °C−0.6 °COLIVER AGDM−2.1 °C−0.2 °CBLATCHFORD−1.3 °C1.2 °CSOUTH CAMPUS−0.9 °C1.8 °CMean Temperature−1.65 °C0.55 °C\n\nTwo data quality issues were considered before using the USGS Collection 2 Level 2 LST products of the above-selected dates. First, there could be data gaps in the Collection 2 Surface Temperature data due to missing input from NASA’s Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Emissivity Dataset. To address this issue, both images of November 20, 2019, and December 1, 2020, were carefully examined, and there were no missing values for the study area. Second, a known error exists in the surface temperature retrievals relative to clouds and possibly cloud shadows, resulting in a bias of −0.01 K ± 0.90 K for Landsat 8 (Cook et al. 2014). Although the temperature bias is of low magnitude, this error was ruled out by ensuring minimal cloud and cloud coverage within the study area using the Surface Temperature Quality Assessment Band (ST_QA) of Collection 2 Product. Specifically, ST_QA bands indicate the level of uncertainty about the temperature related to cloud values. A higher pixel value in the ST_QA band suggests a greater level of uncertainty (USGS 2020). For Edmonton, Alberta, as shown in Fig. , areas of interest consist primarily of low pixel values of darker color, indicating high accuracy in LST data for both years. A few white dots in the ST_QA map that indicates a low accuracy in LST data only appears outside the three land use types.\n\nThe study employed detailed urban land use information collected from the Edmonton Open Data Portal (https://data.edmonton.ca/) to segregate LST data based on land use types and investigate the underlying socioeconomic cause of distinct patterns. Three land-use types, business, industrial, and residential, were selected for examination, as these land uses were the most affected by lockdown restrictions. For business land use, the land occupation was further divided into three sub-categories of retail (grocery store, bakery, convenience store, shopping centers, department stores and more), office (office complex of lower than two floors and high-rise offices of more than four floors), and the hospitality sector (restaurants, hotel and motel, car rentals, theaters, casinos, and other entertainment facilities). For the industrial sector, warehouses were selected to display the overall LST change. One unity dwelling was chosen as the surrogate over townhouses, triplex, or apartments for residential areas to avoid complexity caused by the condensed heat system of multiple-storey buildings.\n\nFor residential land use, fluctuation of LST spatial pattern is known to have a direct relationship with various socioeconomic factors such as income (Chakraborty et al. 2019; Hsu et al. 2021; Huang et al. 2011), population density (Zhang and Wang 2008), education level (Borden and Cutter 2008), and ethnicity (Vaidyanathan et al. 2020). To assess the validity of the relationship in the study area, ten variables were selected from the 2016 Canadian Census at the dissemination area (DA) level, and one variable (median housing price) from the Edmonton Property Assessment database. Variables selected from the Canadian Census were median income, population density, highest education level (no degree, secondary degree, postsecondary degree), Aboriginal population (total, First Nation, Metis, Inuk), and the visible minority population. In addition, variables were normalized (except the population density and median income) by dividing the DA population to enable a fair comparison and data consistency. Further, a point shapefile of individual one-unit dwellings assessed property value for tax purposes was obtained from the Edmonton Open Portal assessment database (namely housing price, https://data.edmonton.ca/). The property assessment database provides reliable information about the assessed value of properties within the City of Edmonton. These points were spatially joined to DA boundary polygons and aggregated into median housing price per DA.\n\nPre-processing and analysis\n\nThe data pre-processing and analysis steps are provided in Fig. and the details for each step are described below. First, Google Earth Engine (GEE) (Google, Mountain View, California, United States) was employed in this project for image preparation, including scaling of bands and cloud and cloud shadow masking (Gorelick et al. 2017). The Landsat 8 Collection 2 images of November 20, 2019, and December 1, 2020, were first imported into GEE, and then cropped to the municipal boundary using the shapefile of Edmonton. Next, the scaling factor function was applied to the thermal band (i.e., band 10) of both images, using the formula: (Band 10 * 0.00341802 + 149) – 273.15 (Esri 2014), which converted LST data in each pixel from Kelvin to Celsius. Since there is a contamination of cloud shadow around the southeastern corner in the 2019 image, a cloud shadow mask was applied using the quality assessment band provided by Landsat 8 (Cordeiro 2021).\n\nTo assign LST data to corresponding land use types for further statistical analysis, the Edmonton land use shapefile was downloaded and imported from the Edmonton Open Portal into ArcGIS Pro (ESRI, Redlands, California, United States) and overlaid it with 2019 and 2020 LST images. Descriptive statistics and a T-test were used to compare the difference between the LST data of the two dates from the business, industrial, and residential land uses, and determine if the difference was significant. The spatial distribution maps of before and during the lockdown were created for three land-use types and a difference map for all three land-use types by subtracting 2019 from 2020 LST, to examine the temperature spatial patterns and spatial differences.\n\nFor residential areas specifically, LST was correlated with socioeconomic variables to investigate their relationships using the random forest (RF) regression model. Alignment of LST data with socioeconomic variables from both the 2016 Canadian Census and the Edmonton Open Portal at the dissemination area (DA) level requires several steps. First, the residential LST points of 2019 and 2020 and the housing price of one-unit dwellings were agglomerated into the dissemination area (DA) level by spatially joining residential points to the DA polygon within the Edmonton municipal boundary. Next, DAs with few houses (DA area/house number ratio lower than 5%) were excluded from the analysis to decrease bias factors caused by DA of low household density, and calculated the median LST and median housing price within each DA polygon. The output represents the median LST and median housing price of all houses within the same DA. Finally, the median LST of each DA, its associated median housing price, and census data were used to run RF regressions. The RF modelling was conducted using the “randomForest” package in R. The model aimed to quantify the importance and impact level of the socioeconomic variables on LST. Random forest consisted of 400 decision trees and was built using bootstrap sampling from the dataset (Breiman 2001) and aimed to find the variables that affected LST the most. Individual RF tests were run for each of the socioeconomic variables and ranked from the highest model improvement ratio (MIR) of 1 to the lowest of 0, and the most important variables were correlated with LST 2019 and 2020 to determine their strength and direction (positive or negative). Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and pseudo-R-squared were evaluated to calculate the average squared difference between the actual value and the predicted value, and to ultimately test the performance of the RF regression model. The closer the RMSE is to 0, the better the prediction power (Breiman 2001). Lastly, the partial dependence plot (PDP) is produced using the “pdp” package in R. The PDP visualized the marginal non-linear relationship of an individual socioeconomic variables to the LST, while controlling for other independent variables (Friedman 2001). The more the PDP curve varies, the more important the variable is, and a flat PDP indicates that the variable is not important (Tao et al. 2020).\n\nResults\n\nLST differences over different land use types\n\nThe LST differences between land-use types (Fig. ) show that business and industrial land types did not follow the study dates’ climate pattern, which saw a higher in-situ hourly temperature in 2020 than 2019 as recorded in the weather stations (Table ). Instead, both business and industrial land use types had a lower LST in 2020, when the daily temperature was warmer than in 2019. This confirms that the lockdown created an anomaly in the LST pattern of business and industrial areas. On the other hand, residential LST was the only land use type that followed the daily temperature pattern: a higher LST in 2020 than in 2019. This result seems to suggest that the lockdown did not impact residential temperature on a spatially average level.\n\nLST variation within each land-use type was further investigated. For business land use, the mean LST in 2020 was 0.55 °C lower than in 2019, as indicated in Fig. ; however, these differences were not uniform across space. As seen in Fig. , areas of the greatest LST fluctuations were located in the North and around the Southwest of the city. Specifically, the decrease of red dots in the 2019 and 2020 LST maps along with the increased presence of dark blue dots in the 2020–2019 LST difference map are evidence of a temperature drop in the North during the lockdown period. On the other hand, the presence of yellow dots in the Southwest of the 2020 LST map and red dots in the 2020–2019 LST difference map represents a warming effect in the South. In addition, a general pattern in the LST distribution map of the pre-pandemic period (2019) was also observed; the temperature was much higher in the downtown core area and decreased with distance from the city center. For the LST map during the lockdown period (2020), the temperature difference between the city center and its edge became either less pronounced or reversed.\n\nTo investigate the effect of the lockdown on different business sub-sectors, we also compared the LST changes of retail (grocery stores, bakery stores, convenience stores, shopping centers, department stores and more), office (office complexes of lower than two floors and high-rise offices of more than four floors), and the hospitality sector (restaurants, hotel and motel, car rentals, theaters, casinos, and other entertainment facilities). Overall, all three sub-sectors demonstrated the same temperature pattern for the business and industrial sectors, which had a lower temperature in 2020 than in 2019 (Table ). However, it is noticeable that points for hospitality and office land use are more clustered towards the city center than a more dispersed retail sector layout. The observed temperature differences of these sub-sectors likely resulted from a combined effect between individual spatial distributions and thermal emission change caused by the lockdown.\n\nTable 2\n\n2019 Mean2020 MeanDifference (2020–2019)Retail−3.31 °C−3.63 °C−0.32 °C ****Hospitality−2.79 °C−3.37 °C−0.58 °C ****Office−3.70 °C−3.83 °C−0.13 °C ***\n\nLST maps of the three sectors in Fig. confirmed the decreasing pattern of LST for all three sectors during the lockdown. The hospitality sector had the highest decrease in temperature of 0.58 °C (2020–2019) during the lockdown, followed by retail (decreased by 0.32 °C) and offices (−0.13 °C) (Table ). The hospitality sector, including restaurants, hotels and motels, theaters, and casinos, showed the greatest LST decrease within the business category compared to the pre-pandemic period (2019); however, this trend was not uniform across space. Specifically, most of the temperature decrease in 2020 was around the downtown area, demonstrated in lighter-colour dots (Fig. ), and the presence of blue and white dots in the LST difference maps. On the contrary, periphery areas have shown some temperature increase, demonstrated by red dots in the LST difference map.\n\nThe most LST decrease was around the city center, whereas the city edge displayed some temperature increase. The retail land use types had a temperature drop in the downtown area when comparing 2020 to 2019, which aligns with the general temperature drop of 1.35 °C between two years. However, there were some warming effects around Southwest of the study area. (Fig. ). Lastly, offices had the least temperature drop (0.13 °C between 2020 and 2019) among the three sectors (Fig. ). High-rise offices in the middle demonstrated the greatest temperature drop, along with a combination of warming and cooling spots running across the city. It is noticeable that for all three sub-sectors, the LST increased in the periphery areas represented by pink and red dots in the LST difference maps (Fig. ). These locations were in proximity to residential areas, which were more likely to be open during lockdown to supply commodities to nearby residences.\n\nFor the industrial sector, the mean temperature in 2020 was 0.31 °C lower than in 2019, with a much smaller range in 2020 (Fig. ). Similar to the business sector, for both years, the spatial map of the industrial sector displays a decreasing pattern in temperature with distance from downtown (Fig. ). Also, the spatial arrangements of the warehouses may have contributed to the temperature difference other than the lockdown as the potential main driver. The topography and elevation of Edmonton could also have impacted the LST due to a higher elevation on the city’s edge and a lower elevation in the center. The most remarkable temperature drop occurring around the center of the city, as indicated by blue and navy dots in Fig. . These sectors are primarily non-essential businesses’ warehouses, such as construction-related companies. There was a reversed UHI effect illustrated by the LST difference maps (Fig. ); an increasing temperature pattern was observed as one moved away from the city center, reflecting the anomaly in the rooftop temperature caused by the lockdown year (2020). There was a temperature increase in the 2020–2019 difference map on the western side of the city, represented by pink and red dots (Fig. ), revealing these industrial activities were not affected by the pandemic restrictions, including warehouses of waste management and recycling centers, wastewater treatment plants, transportation companies (truck parts supplies, trailer rentals), and major distribution centers.\n\nThe residential area was the only land use that displayed an increase in the mean surface temperature of 0.55 °C between the lockdown and pre-pandemic period (Fig. ), indicative of the decrease in mobility of the population during the lockdown. Again, downtown areas were the warmest, and the temperature decreased with an increase in distance from downtown for both years (Fig. ). However, this UHI pattern was less pronounced in the 2020 temperature map (Fig. ) during the lockdown, and it was noticeable that the temperature increased for properties around the southwestern section of the city (Fig. ). Houses located within the downtown area and the North displayed a cooling or no change pattern when comparing the LST difference between 2020–2019, these locations are primarily communities of a higher ethnocultural concentration, including Aboriginal and visible minority populations (Fig. ).\n\nResidential temperatures and their drivers\n\nThe random forest regression was performed at the dissemination area level to assess how LST varied within socioeconomic groups and to find the main drivers behind the LST spatial pattern difference. The models are robust; variables explain around 56.10% of the LST variation in 2019 and 48.15% in 2020. The percentage of root-mean-square deviation (RMSE) was 0.495 for 2019 and 0.311 for 2020 (Fig. ). The models of both years are effective since the RMSE is stable and close to 0 after the number of trees reached 15, for 2019 and 2020 (Fig. ).\n\nIn terms of important drivers, the RF model identified ten socioeconomic variables that influenced LST (Fig. ), with the most important variables for 2020 being median housing price, visible minority population, median income, population density, postsecondary degree, and Aboriginal population. The visible minority population, Aboriginal population, First Nation population and postsecondary degree were more important drivers in 2020 than 2019. Specifically, the visible minority population increased its importance from 0.64 in 2019 to 0.87 in 2020, Aboriginal population increased from 0.27 to 0.43, First Nation population increased from 0.21 to 0.26, and postsecondary degree increased slightly from 0.48 to 0.49. In contrast, variables such as median income (0.78 to 0.56), population density (0.63 to 0.51) and population without degree (0.4 to 0.2) decreased their importance in 2020 compared to 2019. Population density and the postsecondary degree have equal importance in influencing the LST of 2020. Overall, the dominant factors of LST for both years are consistent, with some variables being more important during lockdown than pre-pandemic.\n\nThe strengths and directions of linear regressions between the demographic variables and LST vary (Fig. ). Median housing price had a weak negative relationship with LST in 2019, but this relationship became positive in 2020. Visible minority population density had a weak negative relationship with LST in both years, and this relationship was more significant during the lockdown in 2020. Median income had a negative relationship with LST in 2019 and 2020, but this relationship became less significant during the lockdown and its slope decreased. The population density was positively related to LST in both years; however, its R2 dropped from 0.12 to 0.06 from 2019 to 2020 (Table ). Population with postsecondary degrees increased its importance from less than 0.0005 to 0.08 and turned from a negative relationship in 2019 into a positive relationship in 2020. Lastly, Aboriginal population density decreased its LST variation explanation from 0.032 to 0.0051 in 2020. The median housing price, visible minority population, median income, and postsecondary degree were negatively related to LST in 2019; however, the median housing price and postsecondary degree turned into a positive relationship in 2020 whereas other variables maintained a negative relationship with a variation in R2.\n\nTable 3\n\nCoefficientConstantR2LST 2019LST 2020LST 2019LST 2020LST 2019LST 2020Housing Price−0.0000010.0000007−4.10−4.230.030.04Visible Minority Population %−0.009−0.01−4.37−3.750.010.07Median Income−0.00001−0.000003−3.36−3.590.250.07Population Density0.00010.00005−4.92−4.140.130.06Postsecondary Degree %−0.151.03−4.34−4.370.00050.08Aboriginal Population %3.400.81−4.54−3.960.030.01\n\nThe partial dependence plot in Fig. demonstrated how each socioeconomic variable is related to the LST of 2019 and 2020 while controlling for all other independent variables (Fig. ). For median housing price, in 2019, the fitted curve shows that the relationship between housing price and LST is relatively stable for all price ranges. However, in 2020, a negative linear relationship is observed for housing prices less than $300,000, and this relationship turned to a slight positive until $600,000. After $600,000, the LST remained stable as housing prices increased (Fig. ). For the visible minority population, in 2019, the PDP demonstrated that LST decreased as the visible minority population increased. In 2020, this negative trend remained the same, with a greater magnitude of LST change from −3.8 to −4.2 °C (Fig. ). Median income retained its negative relationship with LST between $20,000 to $120,000, and after $120,000, LST does not vary. Lastly, LST increased substantially as a function of population density in 2019, and this increase plateaued after population density reached 13k. In 2020, however, the fluctuations in LST for all population density levels were less noticeable. For all variables, their related LST in 2020 was higher than the LST of 2019, despite a higher daily temperature in 2020.\n\nDiscussion\n\nTemporal difference between 2019 and 2020\n\nIn general, the LSTs of business, industrial and residential land uses in 2020 displayed an abnormal temperature trend due to the mandated restrictions. These temperature fluctuations imply that the lockdown resulted in reduced energy consumption and decreased anthropogenic heat emissions. Also, the difference in LST of the three land-use types in 2020 was the smallest compared to 2019, implying a smaller temperature variation. The results are consistent with previous studies (Cai et al. 2021; Pal et al. 2021; Teufel et al. 2021), but the magnitude of the LST decrease in the business and industrial sectors in this study is not as pronounced. Pal et al. (2021), for example, discovered LST reduced by 4.02 °C in an industrial belt of India, while in this study, a slight LST drop of 0.31 °C (between 2020 and 2019) was found for industrial land uses. This difference may relate to the micro-climate difference between Edmonton and the study area in India or differences in COVID restrictions on industry types and operations, pointing to the importance of locational studies to explore variations in the impact of the COVID pandemic.\n\nIn contrast, residential land use displayed a temperature increase during the lockdown compared to 2019. The increased LST of residential land use during the lockdown suggests a relocation of human activities to residential areas, thus increasing the thermal emission of residential housing. The results agree with Rouleau and Gausselin (2021), which indicated that daytime hot water and electricity consumption increased as more persons remained in their homes during the lockdown.\n\nThe LST change of retail, hospitality, and office land-use types within the business sector displayed variations in temperature, with a significant decrease in the hospitality sector followed by retail and office. These changes reflect the government mandate to completely close the non-essential hospitality sector and partial closure of the retail industry and offices. Likewise, the cancellation of winter festivals, the closure of ski resorts and restrictions on travel might lead to an absence of customers and tourists in the hospitality and retail sector during the lockdown. The combined effect of the disturbances could be another factor leading to the decline in rooftop thermal emissions in these sectors.\n\nSpatial difference in 2019 and 2020\n\nThe spatial pattern of LST exhibits a typical pattern of an urban heat island (UHI) effect, where downtown areas in the core are always the warmest, and the temperature diminishes with distance from the center (Oke 1982). For 2019, all land uses confirmed this pattern; the highest LST was in the downtown, while the lowest was around the city’s edge. However, the spatial variation of LSTs exhibited some anomalies. The temperature difference between the city center and the edge is less pronounced for the business sector in 2020. This is likely due to the 2020 closure of the high-rise offices located in the downtown core. Companies located at the edge of the city with an increased LST have also contributed to the mitigation of the UHI effect; these locations are mostly grocery stores situated within the community that remained open during the lockdown.\n\nA similar overall relief of the UHI effect caused by the closure of the industrial sector in 2020 was observed. The interrupted businesses within the radius of the urban core are primarily construction-related firms. This overall drop in LST of business and industrial sectors aligns well with the conclusion of Sánchez-López et al. (2022) that the containment measures implemented affected the construction sectors. However, exceptions were noticed around the city’s western region, with recorded temperature increases of around 2 °C. As these locations have essential businesses such as recycling and waste management sites, wastewater treatment sites, distribution centers, and trucks and trailer rentals, these results were expected.\n\nThe increased temperature in warehouses of waste management and wastewater treatment site aligns with the conclusion of previous studies, such that the lockdown increased both the solid and water waste generation by individual households (Klemeš et al. 2020; Prata et al. 2020; Ammendolia et al. 2021). While municipalities must ensure the supply chain of commodities and personal protective equipment (masks, disposable gloves, disinfection tools), and provide reliable, affordable, and accessible water sources during a pandemic, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in household wastes and sewage and stool samples making its transmission through daily wastes and wastewater cannot be neglected (Lebel et al. 2022). On the one hand, solid waste especially used personal protective equipment (PPE), has been generated increasingly and could potentially threaten public health and the environment if not managed properly (Belhadi et al. 2020; Requena-Sanchez et al. 2022). On the other hand, wastewater containing the virus would pollute the water body and soil and ultimately infect animals and humans (Bhatt et al. 2020; Coronado et al. 2021). Due to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the wastewater, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) has used the levels of the virus in the wastewater to detect and predict the infection rate of five major cities (Metro Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, Montréal and Halifax) since the fall of 2020. For Edmonton, the virus concentration peaked at 168.5 per 100 mL of wastewater on November 27, 2020 (Statistics Canada 2022), which aligned well with the infection record. Although wastewater treatment could reduce the number of virus concentrations depending on the disinfecting method used (Bhatt et al. 2020), a great amount of the wastewater contaminated with the virus would still enter the waterbody, pollute the water and soil, and ultimately pose a health threat to surrounding residents as wastewater possess the risk of transmitting the virus through environmental mediums (Coronado et al. 2021). In addition, Coronado et al. (2021) found that the most concentrated virus load in water was in proximity to a populated urban area. Thus, the efficient treatment of wastewater and household waste is of utmost importance. Hence, it is essential for authorities, especially in a high-density metropolitan, to note the importance of waste management during an outbreak, and act accordingly when residents spend more time at home to prevent and mitigate secondary virus transmission through waste.\n\nFor residential land use, an expansion of the downtown warming in 2020 was noted, along with a less pronounced UHI pattern. Additionally, the residential LST difference map for 2020 and 2019 revealed the locations of LST fluctuation. Surprisingly, houses closer to the downtown core were less susceptible to LST increase during the lockdown, and in the North of the city, many even experienced a temperature drop. Meanwhile, houses in the city’s Southwest displayed a large temperature increase. This uneven spatial pattern of the residential LST distribution relates to socioeconomic characteristics with similar patterns reported by other research (Harlan et al. 2006; Huang et al. 2011).\n\nDrivers of the residential LST change\n\nThe role of the minority population group in explaining LST variation during the lockdown changed drastically compared to a typical year. The importance of the visible minority population in explaining LST variation increased in 2020, indicating that the lockdown affected this population more profoundly. When looking at the relationship to LST in 2020, the greater the visible minority population, the lower the rooftop temperature (Fig. ), implying this population either could not afford to turn the heat up when they were at home or were less likely to stay at home during the pandemic (Bambra et al. 2020; Lebel et al. 2022; Teschner et al. 2020), hence a lower LST. This explanation is consistent with Mishra et al. (2022) and Blair et al. (2022)‘s findings; a community with the highest ethnocultural concentration has a lower chance of remote working and thus is more susceptible to COVID-19 exposure.\n\nThe LST relationship was altered for the highest education level achieved, all three variables by the mandate lockdown period. Like the pre-pandemic period, postsecondary degree remained the dominant factor affecting LST in 2020; however, its relationship with LST changed from a negative to a positive correlation. Next, secondary degree and no degree had a positive correlation to LST in 2019, and during the lockdown, their correlation changed into a negative association. Thus, these changes imply that, during the pre-pandemic period, the higher the education level, the less likely to be at home during a working day, whereas during the lockdown, the higher the education level, the more likely for one to be at home. Specifically, the population with no degree was the least likely to remain at home, followed by the secondary degree population and the postsecondary degree population.\n\nHousing price was the dominant factor affecting LST both pre-pandemic and during the lockdown, with some variation between them (Fig. ). The housing price was negatively related to LST when the price was less than $300k, although the magnitude was not as noticeable in 2020. This suggests that for the houses with lower prices, the higher the housing price, the lower the rooftop temperature, and people were less likely to be at home during a working day, although this is less noticeable during the pandemic. For 2020, the relationship between house price and LST turned positive when the house prices were between 300k and 600k; that is, in this house price range, the houses with a higher price tended to have a higher LST, suggesting that a wealthier household was more likely to work at home and kept their interior temperature higher during the lockdown. However, the slopes between LST and housing prices that changed from negative to positive from 2019 to 2020 were marginal. Thus, the impact of housing prices on LST could be further confirmed with more data and investigation. For both years, LST remained stable when house prices were greater than 600k, a potential explanation could be that the higher the housing price, the better quality of the roof insulation, and the less likely for heat to escape, resulting in a lower rooftop temperature.\n\nReflection on Urban Thermal Environment Management\n\nThe confinement measures induced by COVID-19 have provided a unique perspective to reflect on future urban thermal environment improvement. The lockdown modified the spatial pattern and magnitude of heat emission during a workday. Even though the results show relief from the UHI effect during the lockdown, the city center still has a noticeably higher temperature than its edge. This implies that the relocation of anthropogenic emissions has a limited contribution to intra-city temperature difference and that attention should be made to balance the UHI effect from the urban’s physical aspect. Specifically, increasing greenspace across the city as a natural heat sink is an inexpensive and effective way of reducing urban temperature differences (Akbari et al., 2005). By easing the ability of the emitted infrared radiation to re-enter the atmosphere (Oke 1982), increasing evapotranspiration (Gunawardena et al. 2017), and decreasing pollutant levels in the air (Clinton and Gong. 2013), urban tree-planting is known as the most significant way of regulating city-wide microclimate (Zhou et al. 2011). The idea of increasing greenspace seemed unlikely for downtown areas clustered with high-rise buildings that suffer from the highest LST. Therefore, previous research has proposed the creation of green roofs on city buildings (Theodosiou 2009; Sfakianaki et al. 2009). By planting vegetation on buildings, the LST of roofs is lowered and thus decreases the sensible heat flux to the atmosphere. In addition, the increase in urban green space promotes residents’ physical, mental and social well-being (Kardan et al. 2015). Other measures that policymakers could consider in the long term include modifying the spatial configuration of land covers (Zhou et al. 2011) and using lower heat flux building materials (Debbage and Serlhepherd 2015).\n\nRelationship to Existing Literature\n\nThe result confirmed that COVID-19-related lockdown altered the spatial pattern of the urban thermal environment. Temporally, the rooftop heat emission during the lockdown year is lower than in 2019, and this result is consistent with previous research (Cai et al. 2021; Pal et al. 2021; Teufel et al. 2021), with some disparities in the magnitude of temperature decrease related to the differences in the physical characteristics of the studied city and different seasons the studies are based on. Spatially, most previous studies on this topic focused on large geographical areas and thus used 1 km spatial resolution satellite LST data. Differently, we used 30-m Landsat images which offered spatial details to look at thermal environments over urban land use types. We noted relief of the UHI effect during the pandemic year (2020) for business and industrial land use and an abnormal expansion of thermal patterns for residential areas. The former reflects that the lockdown affects the construction sector the most and confirms the conclusion of Sánchez-López et al. (2022). The latter indicates the relocation of weekday daytime activities to residential areas, which yielded a similar finding of increasing hot water and electricity consumption (Chakraborty et al. 2019, Rouleau and Gausselin 2021) while generating more household waste (Klemeš et al. 2020; Prata et al. 2020; Ammendolia et al. 2021). In terms of drivers behind the residential LST variation, few studies that combined socioeconomic variables to COVID-19 infection or mortality rate concluded that inequities in the burden of COVID-19 were observed, suggesting socioeconomically disadvantaged populations faced disproportionate risks (Mishra et al. 2022; Blair et al. 2022). Mishra et al. (2022) used laboratory-confirmed cases from the provincial Public Health Case and Contact Management (CCM + ) surveillance system, while Blair et al. (2022) extracted mortality data from the Canadian Vital Statistics Death Database. Both studies relied on existing databases that could introduce bias due to the lack of randomness and representativeness of the study area. This study, however, utilized real-time 30-m resolution remote sensing LST data that captures the rooftop emission of the entire city. This method ensures the representativeness, randomness, and completeness of the data and, ultimately, a better understanding of human behavioural change. The result agrees with the findings of the above studies, further refines the vulnerable groups by census variables and concludes that visible minorities and Aboriginal population, households of lower housing price, and population of lower education level are less likely to stay at home during a pandemic and thus more prone to COVID-19 infection.\n\nLimitations and Future Directions\n\nIn this study, DAs of higher Aboriginal population density were located around the city center, where residential houses are surrounded by industrial and/or business buildings that emit extensive heat. This layout shielded or blurred the rooftop temperature change of Aboriginal houses and created a noise factor for accurately capturing the LST of the Aboriginal population under the 100 m spatial resolution of the thermal band. The combined effect of a complex layout in the city center and the coarse thermal resolution led to a weak relationship between the Aboriginal population and LST. Extracting LST from a higher thermal resolution sensor may lead to improvements.\n\nOnly two satellite images were used for data analysis due to the limited availability of images. To validate findings, future studies may retrieve thermal data for multiple dates and other cities. Also, this study only used Landsat 8 weekday images and obtained daytime LST data, the effect of restrictions during the nighttime and weekends is not covered in this study. The urban LST in nighttime and weekends temperature difference between opening time and lockdowns might be different from what we observed in the workday. This is confirmed by previous studies. For example, Liu et al. (2022) found that the surface UHI intensity in the nighttime was reduced (0.23 K) less than in the daytime (0.25 K) in 320 cities in China during the lockdown period (February and March, 2020). Chakraborty et al. (2019) discovered that the nighttime urban temperature change was statistically insignificant in 382 urban clusters in India, while the daytime temperature change was significant during the COVID-19 lockdown period, compared to the five-year baseline. Parida et al. (2021) revealed a negative LST during nighttime across Europe and Canada in March-May of the pandemic year 2020 compared to the mean of 2015–2019, which they suggest can be partly ascribed to the lockdown effect. There has been limited research focusing on the difference in LST over different land use types. Future research could involve nighttime and weekend thermal data to better understand the impact of the lockdown caused to urban activities and across land use types in a holistic way.\n\nEven though dates of similar weather conditions were selected for analysis in this study, it was impossible to fully eliminate the difference in LST caused by climatic factors. That being said, lockdown resultant changes in human activity led to an abnormal temperature spatial distribution that did not obey the UHI pattern nor was uniform across the business, industrial, and residential land use (i.e., LST decreased for business and industrial land use while increased for the residential area), implying that this effect was not caused by surface climate change. In addition, the diverse sources of anthropogenic heat emission were not investigated, and the quantification of cause-related energy consumption that led to the LST fluctuation was not feasible. Further analysis could explore the detailed energy consumption difference before, during, and after lockdowns and provide a complete picture of the effect of lockdowns on the LST from the energy consumption perspective. Research that avails of surveys and interviews to understand individual residents’ behavior could help explain LST spatial patterns and differences between pre-pandemic and during the lockdown. Further studies could also survey building history, rooftop materials, insulation quality, and local microtopography that may lead to a fuller explanation of LST variation.\n\nUsing multi-date images over different seasons is suggested to minimize the impact of weather and seasonality in future research. This study was only conducted during winter due to the refinement period (Edmonton lockdown period: Nov 24, 2020 - Jan 15, 2021, Fig. ) imposed by authorities, and the rooftop heat emission resulting from heater usage does reflect the concentration of major human activities. Given Edmonton was open in the summer of 2020, we were not able to add a seasonal perspective to this study. However, we expect a less pronounced difference in thermal emission, because during summer, Edmonton is relatively cool, and its highest mean maximum temperature was 23.44 °C in July 2020 (NOAA 2020). Air conditioning is not necessary nor equipped for most buildings in Edmonton.\n\nThe methodology used in this study has great potential to be expanded to other cities where socioeconomic data are available. This is because many remote sensing images, including Landsat data, are publicly available and provide repetitive global coverage. One potential issue is clouds and cloud shadows that lead to low LST image quality. To solve this problem, Google Earth Engine’s large collection of remote sensing data, computational power, and median image filtering function will be useful in making a median high-quality thermal image during a season or a lockdown period for an area of interest.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this study, the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on the urban thermal environment was examined in the city of Edmonton, along with the relationship of spatial temperature patterns to socioeconomic status. Specifically, a −0.55 °C decrease in LST of the business areas and −0.31° for industrial areas was noted. For business land use specifically, the greatest impact was on the hospitality sector (−0.58 °C), followed by retail (−0.32 °C) and office (−0.13 °C). This result coincides with the restriction imposed on the business and industry sectors. For residential areas, an increase of 0.55 °C occurred during the lockdown. The most important variables behind the temperature anomaly in residential areas were median housing price, visible minority population, median income, and postsecondary degree.\n\nTo conclude, the change in human activity modified the spatial distribution of the thermal environment for all three land uses (business, industrial and residential), and the relationships between individual socioeconomic variables and LST remained significant yet weak, implying the sole effect of anthropogenic emission on the urban thermal environment is of low magnitude. The above findings provide an unprecedented fine scope of the study about the urban thermal environment through the alteration of anthropogenic activities. This research can enlighten effective heat mitigation and guide health equity-informed responses, and provide an efficient way to address critical societal questions around human-environment interactions.\n\nCompliance with ethical standards\n\nCompeting interests\n\nThe authors declare no competing interests.\n\nReferences\n\nAkbari H (2005, May) Potentials of urban heat island mitigation.
