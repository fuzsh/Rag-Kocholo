        "text": "When you are planning to move into a new area or city, it is a good idea to find out as much as you can about what it is like to live in that area. So if you are considering a move to Edmonton, Alberta, we have collected the pros and cons of living there in this article. But first, some background information on the city.\n\nEdmonton is the capital city of Alberta, and it is in the central region of the province. It is the second-largest city in Alberta after Calgary and the northernmost North American city with a metropolitan population of over one million. It is a great city with lots of attractive qualities such as a strong job market and reasonably priced properties. However, it has, like all places, some drawbacks which include cold winters and heavy traffic.\n\nWe will look at the above pros and cons, as well as several others to help you decide if Edmonton sounds like a city you would enjoy living in.\n\nPros\n\nStrong job market and local economy\n\nSeveral large corporations and businesses have offices in Edmonton. These companies include Canadian Western Bank, ATB, and Telus, among several others that are regularly advertising vacancies.\n\nThere are also a lot of opportunities in logistics companies that need drivers and loaders. Other sectors with frequent job openings include health services, IT services, and retail. Edmonton is also in the heart of the province’s oil and gas industry and there are both permanent and temporary jobs available within the industry.\n\nEdmonton has seen an increase in population over the last ten years with people arriving from abroad and from other parts of Canada to study or work. More people means more income the city gets from taxes. The local government has invested this money into the city and created more jobs in the process. It has also improved and increased the average salaries.\n\nTaxes, cost of living and house prices in Edmonton\n\nThe cost of living in Edmonton is cheaper compared to other cities such as Toronto or Vancouver. Although, it is more expensive than Montreal or Quebec City.\n\nEdmonton, as well as the rest of Alberta, has one of the cheapest income tax rates in the country. You will only pay 10% up to the first $131,200 of your taxable income.\n\nGetting on the property ladder is also easier in Edmonton than in many other major cities in Canada. In November 2023, an average family house cost $380,827 in Edmonton. That is less than half of what it will cost you in Vancouver or Toronto, where average houses sell for over a million dollars. It is also cheaper than Montreal or Calgary.\n\nRenting is cheaper in Edmonton, too compared to other large cities in Canada. The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in the city centre is $1488, while for three-bedroom apartments in the city centre, the average rent is $2,418.\n\nLots of nature to explore\n\nLocated in the central region of Alberta, many attractive locations are easily accessible from Edmonton. The Elk Island National Park is only a 45-minute drive away and you can get to two iconic Rockies parks, the Banff and Jasper within four hours.\n\nBut if you don’t fancy travelling that far, there is plenty to explore closer to home, too. The North Saskatchewan River runs through the city and features over 100 kilometres of pathways. The city also has a planned network of open spaces and parks to protect the natural environment and keep Edmonton green.\n\nA multicultural city\n\nThe population of Edmonton is a mix of locals, natives, and immigrants. One in four Edmontonians is an immigrant and most of these people, 54%, are skilled workers. 29% of the immigrants were sponsored by a family member and the rest, 17%, are refugees. These immigrants have added a multicultural flavour to the city.\n\nThe variety of cultures is visible on the streets and neighbourhoods of Edmonton where you can catch different languages being spoken and treat yourself to foods from around the world in the city’s many restaurants.\n\nLots of culture and sports\n\nEdmonton carries the nickname Festival City and for a good reason. There are over fifty festivals over the year, so something is happening every week in Edmonton. With so many festivals catering for a variety of interests, you are bound to find some that appeal to you. There are art, food, music, theatre, and religious festivals. One of the biggest and best-known festivals is the Edmonton International Fringe Theatre Festival in August.\n\nThere are plenty of options for sports fans, too. Edmonton Oilers is the city’s NHL hockey team, and they have won the Stanley Cup five times. But it is not just hockey in Edmonton. There are opportunities for many other sports as well including football, baseball, cycling, and running, just to mention a few.\n\nYou can also go skiing and snowboarding in Edmonton. Rabbit Hill Snow Resort is in the North Saskatchewan River Valley on the south side of Edmonton. It has over 40 acres of skiing and snowboarding trails.\n\nEdmonton is great for families\n\nIf you enjoy city life but would also like more space for your family with cheaper housing, then Edmonton is a great choice. It is a brilliant city for families with affordable housing, a strong job market, and excellent schools.\n\nYou can choose between public, private, and Catholic schools. There is also an option for French immersion through primary and secondary education. Edmonton has a range of post-secondary options, too, at local colleges and universities. The University of Alberta, Northern Alberta Institute of Technology, Concordia University, and MacEwan University are all in Edmonton.\n\nThe West Edmonton Mall\n\nEdmonton is the home of one of the largest shopping malls in North America. It has over 800 stores and services with over one hundred food outlets. Approximately 24 million people visit the mall every year.\n\nAnd you can do a lot more than just shop and eat at the West Edmonton Mall. The mall also houses an indoor water park, an ice rink, a mini-golf course, a movie theatre, a casino, and a hotel.\n\nCons\n\nThe winters are long and cold\n\nSince Edmonton is inland and further north than many other major cities in Canada, the winters can be freezing, long, and harsh. Temperatures in Edmonton drop below zero for around six months of the year and even the summers aren’t that hot. Usually around the low twenties, but some days it might not get much warmer than ten degrees.\n\nYou can expect snow in Edmonton from November until March. The heavy snow can make it difficult to get around with roads and sidewalks becoming icy and slippery. However, a plus side of the cold and snowy winters is that Edmonton has a relatively low rainfall especially compared to cities such as Vancouver or Victoria in British Columbia.\n\nBad Infrastructure\n\nAlthough the city is investing in improving its infrastructure, there is still a long way to go to improve the roads and the ease of getting around Edmonton. The city has notoriously bad roads full of cracks and potholes.\n\nThe reason for the cracks and potholes is the long harsh winters with heavy snowfall. However, many other cities in the world manage to keep their roads in good condition despite a similar climate. For example, the roads in Calgary are in a far better condition than in Edmonton.\n\nHeavy traffic and a spread-out city\n\nEdmonton is a spread-out city and despite recent investments, the public transport still isn’t great. It is ok to get around the city centre, but not beyond that. The situation is even worse in the winter when the weather and bad infrastructure limit the public transport routes and cause delays.\n\nBecause of the limits of the public transport system, many people opt to get around in a car. This leads to heavy traffic, especially during the rush hour. The traffic can also get heavy during weekends with people heading out for recreational activities or to the West Edmonton Mall.\n\nCrime rates are above average\n\nUnfortunately, Edmonton has an above-average crime rate. It was 110 in 2022 compared to, for example, 61 in Toronto or 77 in Calgary. The main offences committed in Edmonton include using and dealing drugs and breaking into homes and cars.\n\nHowever, Edmonton also has a higher-than-average number of violent crimes. The government and local officials have been working hard to reduce the rate of these crimes, and are beginning to see results. The majority of violent incidents occur between young people and in particular between gang members.\n\nThe rate of crime varies between different neighbourhoods. There are plenty of very safe neighbourhoods in Edmonton, but equally, there are those that are best avoided. Therefore, it is advisable to research each neighbourhood before renting or buying in the area.\n\nIt can feel quite segregated\n\nWhile Edmonton is a multi-cultural city with 25% of the population having immigrated to the city, it can still feel segregated outside the city centre. There are different neighbourhoods for people from different socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds.\n\nThis has led to some areas having inflated house prices and others having more crime and fewer amenities. The neighbourhoods in south Edmonton such as Tamarack, Windermere, and Laurel Green are popular with young families and there are newer properties built in these areas.\n\nSome areas with the highest crime rates include Abbotsfield, Blackmud Creek Ravine, and Yellowhead Corridor East. For example, in Abbotsfield, there are 66% more violent crimes than the national average and you have a one in twelve chance of becoming a victim of crime.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith so many beautiful and diverse cities in Canada, it can be difficult to decide where to move. Edmonton has a lot of positive qualities and a lot to offer in terms of job security, affordable housing, and an excellent education system.\n\nYes, there are negatives, too, and some of these can be enough to put prospective new residents off the idea of moving to Edmonton. However, it is worth remembering that the city is improving its infrastructure. They are investing more money to improve the quality of the roads and the reliability and availability of public transport."
