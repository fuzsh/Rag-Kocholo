Its circumscription has been narrowed, and it now encompasses around 170 species, all but one of which are restricted to Eurasia; many species formerly in Aster are now in other genera of the tribe Astereae. Aster amellus is the type species of the genus and the family Asteraceae.[1]\n\nThe name Aster comes from the Ancient Greek word ἀστήρ (astḗr), meaning \"star\", referring to the shape of the flower head. Many species and a variety of hybrids and varieties are popular as garden plants because of their attractive and colourful flowers. 'Aster' species are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species—see list of Lepidoptera that feed on Aster. Asters can grow in all hardiness zones.\n\nCircumscription\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: List of Aster synonyms\n\nThe genus Aster once contained nearly 600 species in Eurasia and North America, but after morphologic and molecular research on the genus during the 1990s, it was decided that the North American species are better treated in a series of other related genera. After this split there are roughly 180 species within the genus, all but one being confined to Eurasia.[3]\n\nThe New World species have now been reclassified in the genera Almutaster, Canadanthus, Doellingeria, Eucephalus, Eurybia, Ionactis, Oligoneuron, Oreostemma, Sericocarpus and Symphyotrichum, though all are treated within the same tribe, Astereae. The \"China aster\" is in the related genus Callistephus. Regardless of the taxonomic change, most are still widely referred to as \"asters\", or \"Michaelmas daisies\", because of their typical blooming period.\n\nSpecies\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: List of Aster species\n\nPlants of the World Online accepts 186 species as of August 2024.[2] The species formerly known as Aster tripolium (sea aster) is now Tripolium pannonicum. The species formerly known as Aster linosyris (goldilocks) is now Galatella linosyris. Many species and a variety of hybrids and varieties are popular as garden plants because of their beautiful, attractive and colourful flowers. Aster species are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species—see list of Lepidoptera that feed on Aster. Asters can grow in all hardiness zones.\n\nSelected species:\n\nSee also: List of Aster synonyms\n\nPhytochemical Profile\n\n[edit]\n\nFlavonoids: These are commonly found in Asters and are known for their antioxidant properties. They may also impart color to the petals.\n\nTerpenoids: These could be responsible for the fragrance of some Aster flowers and are often studied for their potential medicinal properties. [6]\n\nSaponins: These phytochemicals create frothy solutions when agitated in water and have potential antimicrobial properties.\n\nAlkaloids: Though less common in Asters, if present, they could provide a range of bioactivities, including potential toxicity.\n\nPhenolic Compounds: These include tannins and other polyphenolic substances, which may contribute to the plant’s defense mechanisms. [7]\n\nHybrids and cultivars\n\n[edit]\n\nThose marked agm have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\nAster × frikartii (A. amellus × A. thomsonii) Frikart's aster[8]\n\nAster × frikartii 'Mönch' agm[9]\n\nA. × frikartii 'Wunder von Stäfa' agm[10]\n\n'Kylie' (A. novae-angliae 'Andenken an Alma Pötschke' × A. ericoides 'White Heather')[11]\n\n'Ochtendgloren' agm[12] (A. pringlei hybrid)\n\n'Photograph' agm[13]\n\nIn history\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Hungarian revolution of 31 October 1918, became known as the \"Aster Revolution\" due to protesters in Budapest wearing this flower.[14]\n\nIn culture\n\n[edit]\n\nOne of the few flowers left around Michaelmas in the British Isles is the Michaelmas daisy (another name for asters), hence the rhyme: \"The Michaelmas daisies, among dead weeds, Bloom for St Michael's valorous deeds...\"[15]"
