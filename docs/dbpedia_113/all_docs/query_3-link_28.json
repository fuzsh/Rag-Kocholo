        "text": "common yarrow\n\n​Achillea millefolium\n\n​\n\nAncient medicine!\n\nThis common plant is native to the northern hemisphere. Native Americans and Europeans alike used it medicinally especially to help staunch bleeding, leading to its other nickname, woundwort. (Wort derives from Old English for plant and further back meant root.) We think yarrow comes from an ancient Anglo-Saxon word meaning “to repair.”\n\nThe ferny looking leaves are delightfully soft. The foliage smell is strong, but pleasant to most people. Planted as a companion plant in a garden the odor seems to repel some insect pests while the flowers attract large numbers of pollinators.\n\nYarrow can even be used to dye wool yarns naturally resulting in a green to yellow color.\n\nScientific name origin\n\nIn Greek, Achillea​​​ is from Achilles the warrior hero. Legend has it that Achilles used it to keep his armies healthy. The species name, millefolium, is Latin for thousand-leaved, referring to its many leaf parts.\n\ncompass plant\n\nSilphium laciniatum\n\nFun Fact\n\nThe leaves of the compass plant point in opposite directions, many times north and south. This iconic prairie plant was used by settlers crossing the prairies as a sort of compass to guide them.\n\nDeep roots!\n\nThe compass plant can grow up to 10 feet tall, but that is just the tip of the iceberg! The main or tap root can reach a depth of up to 16 feet.\n\nScientific name origin\n\nThe genus name, Silphium, has a Greek origin and refers to the resinous juice that oozes from a stem if broken. From the Latin, lacinia, meaning a lappet or flap of a garment, referring to the lobed leaves.\n\ncup plant\n\nSilphium perfoliatum\n\nNatural water cup\n\nNotice how the leaves of the cup plant are opposite each other and join together at the stem to form a ‘cup–like’ shape. Look inside the “cup”. Do you see any water in the depression at the base of the stem? Birds will often sip the water from this tiny pool. In one of the cup plant photos included, a tree frog has found the water by the stem and nestles in it.\n\nHideout\n\nWhere can wildlife find a place to rest and be concealed in the prairie? The cup plant can provide the perfect hideout. Although the plant is anchored by one deep central taproot, numerous shallow rhizomes surround the root and help spread the plant, often forming colonies of these tall giants. The forest of leaves creates a great hiding place for birds during the heat of the day!\n\nScientific name origin\n\nThe genus name, Silphium, has a Greek origin and refers to the resinous juice that oozes from a stem if broken. ​Perfoliatum in Latin means “ through the leaves”.\n\ngrandpa hawkweed\n\n​Hieracium longipilum\n\nA well behaved hawkweed\n\nRemember that “weed” in a common name does not necessarily mean the species is an unwanted non-native plant. This iconic sand prairie hawkweed grows single or only a few together unlike the weedy non-native hawkweeds which form solid carpets with their basal rosettes.\n\nGrandpa hawkweed has the longest hairs (up to an inch long!) and it’s the tallest of all the Hieraciums. The small yellow ray flower petals are strap-like with a fringe on the end. The tiny seeds have pretty tawny hairs that carry the seeds on the wind away from the parent plant.\n\nScientific name origin\n\nHieracium is from the Greek for “hawk”, from an ancient thought that hawks used the plant to help their eyesight; longipilum is from the Latin for “with long white hairs.”\n\nheath aster\n\nSymphyotrichum ericoides\n\nLives in colonies\n\nThis aster is most often found in dry soils in full sun. It makes large colonies through root rhizomes underground. Like most “asters” these bloom in the autumn. Their numerous tiny flowers (yellow centers with white ray petals) attract a wide variety of insect pollinators. Young foliage is eaten by caterpillars, plant bugs, and mammalian herbivores.\n\n​\n\nScientific name origin\n\nSymphyotrichum is Greek for the junction of hairs, perhaps referring to the seed hairs attachment to one point. This is now the new name for New World asters after it was determined that they are genetically different enough from the Old World asters. Since those were first given the genus name “Aster” the New World asters had to take the second name ever used for them, this much long hard to pronounce name. Ericoides is from Latin, meaning ‘resembling heather’ due to the tiny needle-like green bracts on the flowering stems.\n\nold-field goldenrod\n\nSolidago nemoralis\n\nMany in my family\n\nThere are about 60 different types of goldenrod species in North America. You can tell me apart from all my siblings because I’m a late bloomer, a little shorter, and my flowers look like a wand. “Solidago nemoralis” sounds like a great spell!\n\nRubber source\n\nIn the 1920’s Henry Ford, and Harvey Firestone asked Thomas Edison to find an alternative source for rubber to make tires. Edison experimented with thousands of plants and eventually found a type of goldenrod plant that could be used to make rubber.\n\nScientific name origin\n\nIn Latin Solidago means \"to make whole\", as historically the goldenrods were used for healing; nemoralis means \"of the groves\", referring to one location where this plant can be found (though this goldenrod loves the sun and is found in Nachusa's prairies).\n\npale purple coneflower\n\n​Echinacea pallida\n\nOne of Nachusa Grasslands most bountiful blooms. Some of our original unplowed remnant prairie have acres of this native. It also grows very well in our prairie restorations.\n\nThere is one other of this genus in some parts of Illinois (Echinacea purpurea). Ours, pale purple coneflower, is the most widespread in Illinois. It is quite stiff and the stem and long leaves near the base are all covered in rough white hairs.\n\nScientific name origin\n\nEchinacea is from the Greek, which means, like a sea urchin, because of the prickly seedhead. Pallida is Latin for pale, because it is usually paler than the other purple coneflowers. Sometimes there is even a white bloom.\n\npasture thistle\n\n​​Cirsium discolor\n\nThistles need a better public relations campaign\n\nThe flowers are nectar for many pollinators, make a fine honey, and the blossoms are very fragrant.\n\nThe entire plant can be eaten: leaves with spines removed are excellent salad or cooked greens. The stalk has been peeled and eaten raw or cooked. And the roasted root is said to be sweet.\n\nGoldfinches time their nesting (late in summer) to when thistles are in seed. The seed fluff is used by goldfinches to line the nest and the parents feed their nestlings regurgitated seeds.\n\nThe spines protect the plant from grazers and even the flowers from ants which take nectar but don’t effectively pollinate. Each plant only lives two years. It takes two years for this thistle to bloom; the first year it just has a basal rosette of leaves.\n\nScientific name origin\n\n​Cirsium is Greek for swollen veins, which this plant was thought to cure. Discolor is Latin for two colors.\n\nprairie dock\n\nSilphium terebinthinaceum\n\n​\n\nDeep roots\n\nHow deep are the roots? The taproot can extend down 12 feet deep. Whew! This comes in very handy during a drought.\n\nThe prairie dock has enormous spade-shaped leaves at the base of a (usually) extremely tall, leafless flowering stem. It is by far our tallest flower, sporting small sunflower-like flowers in late summer. Slow to establish, but once it has, it’s almost indestructible. How do you measure up to these giants of the prairie?\n\n​\n\nScientific name origin\n\nSilphium is a classical Greek name for a resinous plant, and these do produce a fragrant resin which was chewed like gum by Native Americans. Terebinthinaceum is Latin for turpentine-like. So, both names refer to the resinous nature of the plant.\n\npussytoes\n\nAntennaria plantaginifolia\n\nCat’s paws on the prairie\n\nThese fuzzy plants grow in colonies connected by underground runners. Sometimes each colony is either male or female. If a female flower fails to be fertilized it can still produce seed!\n\nPlants in this genus tolerate cold very well; many species are alpine. Perhaps those silvery white “hairs” all over keep the plant warm!\n\nThe caterpillars of American painted lady butterflies depend on pussytoes (and related plants) for food and shelter (they roll up inside the leaves).\n\nScientific name origin\n\nAntennaria, from the Latin for antennae, either because the resemblance to insect feelers of the hairs of the females flowers that split into two threads, or the hair on the seed that carry it on the wind. Plantaginifolia means the leaves are shaped like those of the plantain plants.\n\nrosinweed\n\nSilphium integrifolium\n\nChew on this fact:\n\nRosinweed gets its name from the gummy resin inside the stems, which was used like chewing gum by Native Americans. This is the smallest of all the Silphiums.\n\nNative American uses\n\nRosinweed was used by Native Americans for a variety of purposes. The Pawnees made tea from the pounded roots for what they called “general debility” or weakness. The Omahas used it in a treatment called “ashude-kithe” to alleviate the symptoms of a head cold.\n\nScientific name origin\n\nThe genus name, Silphium, has a Greek origin and refers to the resinous juice that oozes from a stem if broken. The species name integrifolium, means “whole leaf”.\n\nrough blazing star\n\n​Liatris aspera\n\nI love the sandy and gravelly soil places at Nachusa! Look for my amazing spike of pinkish-purple flower “buttons.” Bees, butterflies, hummingbirds and many others love my nectar and help move my pollen around so my baby seeds can develop and blow away in the wind.\n\nNachusa has three kinds of blazing stars—me, a shorter one, and one that loves wetter soils. You have probably seen my cousins in flower arrangements because I am so pretty.\n\nScientific name origin\n\nLiatris has no known derivation! The plant and language experts do not know what word means. Aspera means harsh in Latin.\n\nsawtooth sunflower\n\nHelianthus grosseserratus\n\nEasy identification\n\nThere are at least eight species of sunflower native to the preserve that are very similar in appearance, and to add to that frustration, hybridizing among sunflower species is possible. However, sawtooth sunflower is easy to identify. It is Nachusa’s tallest sunflower, and the leaves usually have serrated edges, but the most distinguishing feature is its smooth reddish stem (often with a powdery white coating).\n\nLike other sunflowers its nectar and pollen are very important for bees and butterflies. Also other parts of the plant (leaves, stem pith, juices, and seeds) are food to many insects (caterpillars, flies, beetles, grasshoppers, aphids, and the sunflower spittlebug).\n\nThe fat and protein content of the seeds are very important for birds and rodents to get through the winter lean times.\n\nScientific name origin\n\nHelianthus is Greek, helios, meaning sun, and anthus, meaning flower. Grosseserratus is Latin meaning, with large sawteeth.\n\nshowy goldenrod\n\nSolidago speciosa\n\nFun Fact\n\nI’m the most showy of all the goldenrod species. My reddish stalks can grow up to 4 feet tall and I have pyramid-like clusters of flowers that are especially attractive to butterflies.\n\nScapegoat\n\nI often get the blame for people’s allergies, but ragweed, my Asteraceae cousin, is actually to blame.\n\nScientific name origin\n\nIn Latin Solidago means \"to make whole\", as historically the goldenrods were used for healing; speciosa is Latin for showy, a spectacle.\n\nstiff goldenrod\n\n​Oligoneuron rigidum\n\nLatex rich\n\nDid you know Thomas Edison and others experimented with using goldenrods as a source of rubber? This is because some species are rich in latex.\n\nMedicinal uses\n\n​Many goldenrod species were used as medicines before the modern age. Goldenrod does seem to act like a diuretic and in Europe is used in teas to flush out kidney stones and stop inflammatory diseases of the urinary tract.\n\nThe genus for goldenrods used to be Solidago (to make whole) but recently stiff goldenrod and a few others were put in their own genus. It certainly looks a bit different with its fuzzy thick leaves, stem, and flower head.\n\nScientific name origin\n\nOligoneuron is Greek for few-nerved. Rigidum is Latin for stiff.\n\ntall coreopsis\n\n​Coreopsis tripteris\n\nI am not a sunflower even though I have yellow flowers, because I only have eight ray flowers. My one of my nicknames is tickseed. But my seed won’t stick to you.\n\n​\n\nI love to wave in the breeze in mid-summer. I can handle a lot of different kinds of soil, from dry to wet and sunny to slightly shaded.\n\nMy yellow ray flowers are usually eight in number and my inner disk flowers are reddish-brown. I am a smooth one and the tallest of Nachusa’s three species of coreopsis. I have lower leaves that are divided into 3-5 lance-shaped leaflets (2-5 inches long) and upper leaves that are not divided.\n\nScientific name origin\n\nCoreopsis is Greek and means, the appearance of a bug, referring to the rounded flat seeds that might look like a tick to some. Tripteris is also Greek and means three-winged.\n\ntall goldenrod\n\nSolidago altissima\n\nSome botanists consider this to be a variety of Canada goldenrod (Solidago canadensis). These two species are the most common goldenrods in our area. Due to their arial seed dispersal, deep roots, and unpalatability they persist in overgrazed pastures and abandoned fields.\n\nGoldenrods provide nectar and pollen to almost every imaginable insect and are especially important late in the season when fewer other flowers are blooming.\n\nHuman use\n\nHumans have tried using preparations of a variety of goldenrods for remedies for sore throat, toothaches, wounds, and many other ailments. Some species have been used for cloth dyes and were tested for use as a rubber/latex substitute.\n\nNot a ragweed!\n\nPeople with hay fever often mistake goldenrod for ragweeds which bloom at the same time, but ragweeds have tiny green flowers that make them hardly noticed. The pollen of goldenrods is too large to bother the nose, whereas pollen of ragweed is tiny and light enough to be wind dispersed and irritates the nasal passages.\n\nScientific name origin\n\nIn Latin Solidago means “to make whole,” as historically the goldenrods were used for healing. Altissima is Latin for tallest.\n\nviscid grass-leaved goldenrod\n\nEuthamia gymnospermoides\n\nGoldenrods are very common all over the USA (at least 90 species). They were even proposed as our national flower due to the idea that the many tiny flowers are needed to make a perfect whole.\n\nGoldenrod plants form clones so dense no other plants can get in. This short, flat-topped narrow-leaved species, with the long name is a welcome addition to the prairie, attracting many insect pollinators.\n\nBecause goldenrods bloom at the same time as the non-showy ragweeds people confuse the two. Ragweed pollen is tiny and wind pollinated while goldenrod pollen is large and sticky and requires insects to move it around. Only the ragweed pollen annoys our noses.\n\nScientific name origin\n\nEuthamia is Greek for well-crowded. For the species gymnospermoides, the suffix \"oides\" in Latin means it resembles, in this case a genus Gymnosperma.\n\nwild quinine\n\nParthenium integrifolium\n\nA pollinator favorite!\n\nAlso called American feverfew. However, there is no clinical evidence that this and related plants are effective as medical treatments.\n\nFrom late spring to mid-summer, the large flower cluster is bright white and resembles a loose cauliflower head. The thick stalk leads to a tap root with side rhizomes which grow sideways to produce more plants, therefore often occurring in large groups. These plants are 2-3 feet tall, so a large mass of these stout perennials are fun to walk through to admire their structure and the many pollinators and other insects that come to enjoy all parts of this plant.\n\n​\n\nScientific name origin\n\nParthenium is Greek for ‘virgin’ and integrifolium is Latin for ‘entire-leaved’ (no lobes). However, the leaves are quite toothed, wavy, and have a thick, sandpapery texture.\n\nyellow coneflower\n\nRatibida pinnata\n\nLong & beautiful bloomer\n\nA beautiful common prairie wildflower that can grow in dry or medium moist soils in full or partial sun. The yellow ray petals droop, like a ballerina tutu. Many bees, wasps, butterflies, and beetles collect nectar and pollen from this long blooming composite. The caterpillar of the wavy-lined emerald moth camouflages its body with fragments of the flower while feeding.\n\nThe seeds when crushed have a lovely citrus odor. American goldfinches have been seen eating the seeds in winter.\n\nScientific name origin\n\nThe genus was named by Constantine Samuel Rafinesque (1783-1840) who came to the Ohio Valley and collected and gave sometimes creative names to plants and animals. Ratibida might two equal clefts, however this is cryptic. Pinnata means a leaf with a central stem and small leaves arranged on both side of the stem."
