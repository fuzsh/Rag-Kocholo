I live in a tiny junky town near the GTA and I decided to look at other places. I’ve noticed Edmonton is a nice city with affordable housing. For people who live in Edmonton.. what makes Edmonton a good (or not so good) place to live? And why is it better than Calgary for those who advocate it.\n\nFound image off google.. exploreedmonton.com . Don’t know original photographer"
