        "text": "Public Hearing Outcome and Next Steps\n\nCity Council heard from over 100 speakers during the five-and-a-half-day District Planning Public Hearing which concluded on June 26, 2024.\n\nDistrict Policy and 14 of the District Plans\n\nThe District Policy and 14 out of the 15 district plans passed first and second readings with City Council voting to advance them with some minor amendments. These included:\n\nUpdating the District Policy to include a statement that the District Policy and the district plans shall not restrict freedom of movement, association, and commerce in accordance with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\n\nChanging District Policy 2.5.2.6 to combine the criteria for corner sites and open spaces/parks (criteria e and f) into a single criterion\n\nAmending the District Policy and 14 district plans to reflect the renaming of the 118 Avenue District to the North Central District\n\nThe City will make these amendments and take the District Policy and the 14 plans to the Edmonton Metropolitan Region Board (EMRB) for approval under the Regional Evaluation Framework. This process takes approximately two months.\n\nThe Policy and plans will then return to a regular City Council meeting in fall 2024 for third and final reading. If approved at this reading, the Policy and 14 plans will come into effect immediately.\n\nRabbit Hill District Plan\n\nThe Rabbit Hill District Plan was referred back to City administration for more significant changes, including:\n\nAmending the maps and policy to support the preparation of statutory plans for non-residential development for lands located south of 73 Avenue SW/Township Road 510 and west of Whitemud Creek\n\nPreparing any amendments to The City Plan needed to support the preparation of statutory plans for non-residential development on these lands\n\nOnce the changes are made to the Rabbit Hill District Plan, it will return to a full Public Hearing for first and second reading. Edmontonians will be informed when the revised plan advances to Public Hearing, providing them the opportunity to share their thoughts directly with Council by registering to speak or submitting written comments.\n\nThe plan will then follow the same process as the other plans. It will be reviewed by the Edmonton Metropolitan Region Board (EMRB) and then return to a regular City Council meeting for third and final reading before coming into effect.\n\nA number of changes were made to the proposed District Policy and plans since the last round of public engagement and report to the Urban Planning committee in late 2023 (item 7.1). Read the Overview of Changes 2024 document to learn more about the changes since the 2023 draft plans. Read the Overview of Changes 2023 document for all changes made to the 2022 draft plans to create the 2023 version of the draft plans.\n\nDistrict Policy Purpose\n\nThe proposed District Policy provides general policy direction for planning and design, mobility and growth management for all districts. It allows for a consistent policy framework, enabling an efficient and equitable approach wherein policy updates will apply citywide and growth in all areas of the city will share a common foundation.\n\nHow the District Policy Was Made\n\nThe District Policy was drafted by:\n\nDrawing upon The City Plan and existing sources of policy and planning guidance\n\nConsulting with Edmontonians and stakeholders, and\n\nAligning policy direction with City Council decisions on land development applications\n\nDistrict Plans Purpose\n\nThe 15 proposed district plans contain area-specific policies unique to the district and district-specific maps to show how the citywide District Policy directions are applied in each particular district.\n\nThe main function of the plans is to show what type of development is appropriate and what public infrastructure is planned in all parts of each district.\n\nEach plan has been designed with a consistent structure for all 15 districts. Readers will connect information from the maps in the district plans to policies in the District Policy.\n\nHow District Plans Were Made\n\nThe City Plan was the starting point for drafting all district plans. Area-specific policies were drawn from existing plans and guidelines in effect through a detailed review of each of these documents. This review determined which policies were aligned with The City Plan and needed to be retained and incorporated into the proposed district plans.\n\nMap content was drawn from various City strategies, the Cityâ€™s open data catalogue, and data made available by EPCOR and the Government of Alberta. Feedback from Edmontonians and stakeholders was also used to change the plans to better reflect the history and local context of each district, and make the documents easier to read, understand and navigate.\n\nLearn more about How the Plans Were Made .\n\nExisting Plans to Change or Retire\n\nTo view the proposed existing plans to change or retire, go to the Agendas and Minutes section of the Council and Committee Meetings page and select the agenda or minutes for the May 28, 2024 City Council Public Hearing.\n\nWhat are Geographic Plans?\n\nGeographic plans guide how a neighbourhood or area of the city is to be developed or redeveloped. They are often statutory (created by bylaw) and the most common examples are:\n\nArea Redevelopment Plans (ARPs)\n\nOutline Plans (OPs)\n\nArea Structure Plans (ASPs)\n\nNeighbourhood Structure Plans (NSPs)\n\nNeighbourhood Area Structure Plans (NASPs)"
