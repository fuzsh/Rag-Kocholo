        "text": "Asters are microtubule fibers in the mitotic spindle and a part of the cytoskeleton of a cell. Aster cells are not found in prokaryotes, they are only found in animal cells. The name \"aster\" is derived from the Latin word for \"star\" because of its star-like structure. The mitotic spindle is also part of the cytoskeleton and splits chromosome pairs apart during cell division in mitosis and meiosis. Another word for chromosome pairs is sister chromatids. Mitosis is the splitting of sister chromatids in a somatic cell to form two identical cells, called daughter cells. Meiosis is the splitting of a gamete cell into four daughter cells unique from its parent cells. The second phase of meiosis, called meiosis II, is similar to mitosis. During both meiosis II and mitosis, which will be discussed later in this lesson, different structures in the cell work together to pull the sister chromatids apart. Each new cell needs one chromosome copy to form a fully functional new cell. Microtubule fibers, like asters, play a critical role in this process.\n\nKinetochores, interpolar microtubules, and aster microtubules are the three structures that arise from centrosomes and comprise the mitotic spindle. The centrosomes are an organization hub for microtubules. The function of the mitotic spindle is to pull the sister chromatids apart and towards opposite ends of the cell, so the cell can eventually split with each side having a copy of the chromosome. Asters are the star-like structures that emerge from the centrosomes at the far ends of the cell. Interpolar microtubules and kinetochores grow from the centrosomes towards the center of the cell. The role of asters, in conjunction with motor proteins, is to pull the mitotic spindle fibers attached to the sister chromatids towards the far ends of the cell. This tension will eventually pull the sister chromatids apart.\n\nThe sister chromatids are located in the center line of the dividing cell. The centrosomes are located at the far left and right ends of the cell. In this image, the asters are the short arms emerging from the centrosomes pointing away from the other, longer microtubules that reach towards the center.\n\nYou are Made of Star Stuff!\n\n'We are a way for the universe to know itself. Some part of our being knows this is where we came from. We long to return. And we can, because the cosmos is also within us. We're made of star stuff.' - Carl Sagan\n\nHas anyone ever told you that you're made of star stuff? You are! Usually, when people say that, they're referring to the elements that make up your body. Carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, for example, were formed in ancient stars over 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nBut your very own cells make intricate star-shaped structures called asters. Asters are structures animal cells use during mitosis or meiosis, and the word aster comes from the Latin word for star.\n\nWhat are Asters?\n\nAsters are considered part of the cytoskeleton, the structural component of the cell. Asters are made of microtubules, the largest of the three main cytoskeleton components (microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules). Microtubules are made of a protein called tubulin.\n\nBefore asters come centrosomes. Centrosomes are cytoskeleton structures consisting of two bundles of microtubules called centrioles, stuck to one another at a right angle. Centrosomes normally stay near the cell's nuclear envelope. They become important right before the cell's nucleus begins to divide, in processes called mitosis or meiosis. Mitosis and meiosis are how the cell produces two daughter nuclei, an important step in cell division. Mitosis is what most of your cells do; for example, if you cut your hand, your skin cells will undergo mitosis and then divide to close the wound. Meiosis is a special kind of nuclear division that takes place in your sex cells (eggs or sperm).\n\nRight before mitosis or meiosis begins, the centrosome will divide into two daughter centrosomes, and each centrosome will migrate to the opposite side of the nucleus.\n\nAs mitosis or meiosis begins, centrosomes create two new structures: spindle fibers, which connect the sister centrosomes to each other, and asters, which radiate out from the centrosome. The asters then provide support and guidance to the chromosomes, ensuring that chromosomes end up in the right place as mitosis occurs.\n\nDuring mitosis and meiosis, asters help chromosomes line up in the center of the nucleus. How these chromosomes are arranged depends on whether we are talking about mitosis or meiosis, but the important thing to know is that asters then pull one half of this genetic information to each side of the nucleus. Then, the nucleus itself will divide in half, leaving two daughter nuclei.\n\nYou can see the asters helping the chromosomes line up\n\nIt's very important that chromosomes end up in the right place, because each daughter nucleus should end up with exactly half the genetic material after cell division. And the genetic information the daughter nuclei ends up with should be the same; you don't want all your eye genes going to one daughter nucleus and all your hand genes going to the other one! So mitosis and meiosis need to be precise. On the rare occasions that chromosomes end up in the wrong place, the daughter nucleus will contain the wrong amount of information. This will likely result in a daughter cell that is nonviable. Occasionally, it will result in a disorder such as Down's syndrome (where a person has an extra copy of Chromosome 21), or Jacobs syndrome or Klinefelter syndrome (where a person has an extra copy of a sex chromosome)."
