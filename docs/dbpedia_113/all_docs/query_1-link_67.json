        "text": "4.1 Atmospheric correction\n\nThe Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of the Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) algorithm that is derived from the standard MODTRAN model was adopted to convert radiance to surface reflectance for Tiangong-1 HSI data (Berk et al., 1998). To minimize the influence of atmospheric water absorptions, the bands between 1,300 and 1,500 nm and between 1,750 and 2,000 nm were removed. Only 40 bands were retained for mineral mapping. Both the Tiangong-1 HSI and ASTER data were georeferenced to UTM projection using the WGS-84 datum (UTM zone 16 N) with ±1 pixel registration error (Jensen, 2004).\n\nTo evaluate the consistency of reflectance data of the two datasets, spectra from two homogeneous locations were compared. The first is a bedrock site (60 m × 60 m) rich in carbonate minerals that displays strong absorption features near 2,330 nm (Figure 3a and 3b), and the second is a relatively level dry alluvial channel (60 m × 240 m) devoid of vegetation displaying moderate to low SWIR reflectance (Figure 3c and 3d). Figure 3e,f shows the average spectrum for each site obtained from the Tiangong-1 (40 bands) and the ASTER SWIR (six bands) data. The first location encompassed nine Tiangong-1 pixels and four ASTER pixels while the second area encompassed 36 Tiangong-1 pixels and ASTER 16 pixels. For both sites, although ASTER reflectance of Band 4 and Band 9 was higher and Band 5 reflectance was lower than the Tiangong-1 spectra due to residual crosstalk effect (Mars & Rowan, 2010), both datasets capture the same spectral features with similar spectral shape and feature location (e.g., 2,330 nm carbonate feature on Figure 3e; 2,200 nm clay feature on Figure 3f) in the spectral range of 2,160–2,336 nm. This indicates that spectral features from the same target are generally comparable for both datasets despite the slight shift (e.g., 2,230 nm carbonate feature on Figure 3e) of some feature centres due to difference in spectral resolutions (23 nm for Tiangong-1 and 40–100 nm for ASTER).\n\n5.1 Image endmember spectra\n\n5.1.1 Laboratory mineral and spectral feature identification\n\nMuscovite was identified to be the dominant alteration mineral and occurred extensively in different alteration zones in the study area based on the XRD results (Table 2). Calcite, chlorite, kaolinite, epidote, and dolomite were also detected in some samples.\n\nSample No. Major minerals and contents J703-JTZ-2-1 Qtz Ms / Dol / Kao / J703-DQ1 Qtz / Ab / Ep / / J703-Qz2 Qtz Ms / / / / / J703-G1-1 Qtz Ms Ab / Chl Kao / J703-G1-2 Qtz Ms Ab Cal Chl / / J703-Au5-2 Qtz Ms / Cal Chl / /\n\nBased on the XRD analysis and previous study (Liu et al., 2018), muscovite, calcite, dolomite, chlorite, epidote, and kaolinite were identified as alteration indicators in the study area and presence of their unique spectral features were verified by laboratory spectral measurement.\n\nExcept the water absorption features near 1,400 and 1,900 nm, the samples with high abundances of muscovite (J703-AL1, J703-GM-2, and J703-Qz2 in Figure 4a), epidote (J703-DQ1 in Figure 4a), and kaolinite (J703-G1-1 in Figure 4a) show similar features with the corresponding spectra from JPL Spectra Library (Figure 4b). The diagnostic features of chlorite (J703-G1-2), calcite (J703-AU5-2), and dolomite (J703-JTZ-2-1) from samples were affected by the presence of muscovite in the samples.\n\nTo explore the capability of both spaceborne sensors, the JPL reference spectra were re-sampled to the bandpass of the Tiangong-1 and ASTER data (Figure 5). The absorption feature of kaolinite near 2,165 nm is essentially lost in the Tiangong-1 spectrum (Figure 5), while the features of the other five minerals are well retained. The key absorption features at 2,209 nm (ASTER Band 6) and 2,330 nm (ASTER Band 8) are retained on ASTER spectra. However, due to lack of bands near 2,300 nm in ASTER data, the absorption feature of dolomite has been dampened and shifted (Figure 5). As a result, the ASTER spectrum of chlorite is similar to that of dolomite over 2,100 to 2,400 nm (ASTER Band 5 to Band 9) region, where epidote is similar to calcite on ASTER spectra (Figure 5). Thus the slope difference of ASTER spectrum in Bands 4 and 5 may be important in order to potentially distinguish chlorite from dolomite and epidote from calcite.\n\n5.1.2 Image endmember suites\n\nOne hundred and ninety-seven candidate image endmembers were extracted from the Tiangong-1 HSI data using SSEE algorithm. After grouping, 18 endmember categories were labelled including one for water, two for manmade objects, two for alluvium deposits, seven for bedrock, and six for altered rocks. Spectra of the altered rocks are displayed in Figure 6. For the ASTER data, 109 candidate image endmembers were extracted and grouped into 15 categories. They include one for manmade object, two for alluvium deposits, six for bedrock, and six for altered rocks. In Figure 6, ASTER spectra of altered rocks were compared to those from Tiangong-1 data.\n\nDespite the high reflectance of Bands 4 and 9 for ASTER data, the image endmember spectra obtained from Tiangong-1 HSI data are systematically comparable to those derived from ASTER data with spectral features diagnostic of muscovite, kaolinite, epidote, chlorite, and calcite (Figure 6). Features centres (e.g., 2,330 nm for dolomite) are not matching perfectly due to differences in bandpass of both datasets as discussed before. The spectra of muscovite and kaolinite for both Tiangong-1 and ASTER are quite similar except for the spectral slope difference from 1,600 to 2,100 nm and the slightly difference near 2,170 nm (Figure 6). Tiangong-1 and ASTER rock endmembers with calcite features can be compared to JPL calcite spectra (Figures 5 and 6). The Tiangong-1 calcite-dolomite endmember shows absorption features near 2,307 and 2,326 nm that represents overlapped features from calcite and dolomite (Figures 5 and 6). Therefore it is difficult for ASTER data to distinguish the dolomite from calcite due to the lack of bands nearby. The weak absorption feature near 2,209 nm is also observed in the ASTER spectra of chlorite and epidote (Figure 6), which might be induced by the presence of muscovite in the pixel (as mentioned in Section 5.1.1).\n\n5.2 Mapping results\n\nFigure 7 displays the SAM results for the Tiangong-1 HSI and ASTER data obtained using the selected image endmembers shown in Figure 6. The overall distribution patterns are comparable on SAM maps from both datasets and systematically reveal alteration primarily in the western, eastern, and northeastern parts of the mapping area. The association with SWW–NEE and E–W oriented faults, the occurrence of granites and carbonates are clearly mapped.\n\nIn the middle-southern part, the alteration zones are dominated by muscovite, but kaolinite is observed in the core regions of some of these zones as observed within the granites near location J703-G1-1 on Figure 7. The maps reveal that some known mines (Mingjingou, Xiaojinwozi, No. 4, No. 6, and No. 9) are obviously associated with muscovitization, whereas the other two operational mines (Gaomiao, No. 7 and No. 8 gold deposits) are associated with both muscovitization and kaolinization (mapped as mixtures of muscovite and kaolinite in Figure 7). In the eastern part of the study area, the distribution of muscovitization and kaolinization is distinctly controlled by NE–SW oriented quartz veins and E–W oriented fault.\n\nIn the northern part, carbonates (especially calcite) are the dominant minerals that show obvious SWW–NEE direction and map the extent of the Proterozoic carbonates sediments well (near Malianquan in Figure 7). In addition, some calcite anomalies have been observed in the southern part, which are related to the alteration in hornblende gabbro and quartz diorite around the No. 9 gold deposit. The mixture of calcite and dolomite is also observed in the north and south regions of the calcite zone near Malianquan on Figure 7.\n\nFor the other two minerals, chlorite is mostly scattered in the west of the study area (in the south of Gaomiao) and limited within the distribution of meta-sandstone indicating that it is most likely related to regional metamorphism. Epidote is distributed along the SWW–NEE oriented faults in the western and central area of the study area and also occurs along the E–W oriented faults in the eastern part (near No. 6 gold deposit) within rhyolite, andesite, and metasediments near granite and granitic diorite intrusions.\n\nThe mineral distribution derived from the Tiangong-1 (Figure 7a) and ASTER (Figure 7b) data are comparable, but the Tiangong-1 result displays a considerably higher level of details than that produced from the ASTER data due to the higher spatial and spectral resolutions of Tiangong-1 data. For example, some of the linear alteration zones associated with granitic veins in the southwestern area (near South Jintanzi) have been identified as muscovite in the Tiangong-1 results (Figure 7c) whereas none of these were captured in the ASTER results (Figure 7d). However, capability of alteration detection by Tiangong-1 data is also restricted by its signal spatial footprint and distributed image pixel size. Most of the alteration zones associated with thin veins (alteration approximately 2–4 m wide) are difficult to be distinguished due to the limitation of spatial resolutions (20 m Tiangong-1 and 30 m ASTER). In the southwestern region of the study area, three known small mineralization zones (near No. 18, Jintanzi and South Jintanzi) not extracted on the Tiangong-1 map are all associated with thin granitic veins (mostly 2–4 m wide; Figure 6a). On ASTER map, six known deposits (near No. 18, Jintanzi, South Jintanzi, Xiaojinwozi, No. 10, and No. 4) are not successfully extracted due to its coarser spatial resolution.\n\nField investigation of alteration zones was conducted at 32 mapped locations mapped by ASTER and Tiangong-1. These locations include five mines (vein deposits) and 27 sites where samples were collected. Seven additional gold mines (No. 4, No. 5, No. 6, No. 9, No. 10, No. 18, Shimiao, and one silica deposit [No. 7 in Figure 1 and Figure 7]) are previously documented on the old 1:50,000 geologic map in this area. The anomalies observed on the Tiangong-1 and ASTER mineral maps agree well with information available for the exiting deposits and field locations with more details presented by Tiangong-1 results. Field locations, such as J703-AL1 (with high muscovite content) and J703-G2 (with high muscovite content), are successfully mapped as muscovite zones, while site J703-G1-1 (with high contents of both muscovite and kaolinite) are detected as alteration zone of both muscovite and kaolinite anomalies (Figure 7a and 7b). Among the 13 known deposits and 27 sites for field check, 10 deposits and 19 field locations are captured by the Tiangong-1 results, whereas seven deposits and 16 field locations are mapped as anomalies on the ASTER results.\n\n5.3 Potential targets inferred from remote sensing results\n\nBased on the extent of spatial distribution of the alteration rock endmembers, 15 targets (Table 3) for mineral exploration can be inferred from the remote sensing maps (Figure 7). Among these targets, the alteration minerals of targets A, C, D, E, H, J, and M are linearly distributed, which might be associated with granitic quartz veins (Table 3; Figures 7, 8, and 9). Even though many linear muscovite zones seen in the Tiangong-1 results cannot be clearly defined on the ASTER map (Figure 8), they should be considered in future study and exploration as they are very distinct on Tiangong-1 results. Targets B, F, G, I, K, and L manifest themselves as discrete patchy anomalies, which are dominated by muscovite and kaolinite (Figures 7, 8, and 9). Moreover, in targets N and O, there are linear muscovite anomalies inside the carbonate units (Figure 7), which have never been documented, should be checked in the official mapping campaign. Among these 15 potential targets, only five targets (A, B, C, E, and F) have been officially documented on previous geologic maps. Target A is an altered vein with muscovite and kaolinite minerals but no obvious metal mineralization, while the other four targets are all exploited vein deposits (Figures 7 and 8) characterized by muscovite/kaolinite alteration.\n\nNo. Type Minerals identified by remote sensing data Field inspection A Vein Muscovite, kaolinite Muscovite alteration, no obvious metal mineralization B Rounded Muscovite, kaolinite Exploitation site for gold, with muscovite and kaolinite alteration C Vein Muscovite, kaolinite Exploitation site for gold, with muscovite and kaolinite alteration D Vein Muscovite, kaolinite Not inspected E Vein Muscovite, kaolinite Exploitation site for gold, with muscovite and kaolinite alteration F Rounded Muscovite, kaolinite Exploitation site for gold, with muscovite alteration G Rounded Muscovite, kaolinite Quartz veins inside the granite, with muscovite and malachite H Vein Muscovite, kaolinite red granite with muscovitization, silicification and malachite I Rounded Muscovite, kaolinite, epidote Epidote in the north, muscovite in the south, no obvious metal mineralization J Vein Muscovite, kaolinite Granitic dyke with strong muscovitization K Rounded Muscovite, kaolinite Not inspected L Rounded Muscovite, kaolinite Not inspected M Vein Muscovite, kaolinite Quartz vein with strong muscovitization and disseminated pyrite N Vein and punctual Muscovite, calcite Not inspected O Vein and punctual Muscovite, calcite Quartz veins inside the limestone, with weak muscovitization\n\nTo support the official updating of geological map at 1:50,000 scale, six targets (G, H, I, J, M, and O) have been thoroughly inspected during March 2017. The muscovitization of Targets G, H, I, and J is confirmed to be associated with granitic intrusions (Figures 7, 10, and 11). Both Targets G and H are located in the red granites with muscovitization and silicification as the major alteration (Figures 10a and 12). Malachite is observed in the samples from the two targets (Figure 10b). Similarly, Target J is related to a NWW–SEE oriented granitic dyke, which is completely altered with muscovitization (J-1 in Figures 11a and 12). However, no metal mineral has been observed in the samples of Target J.\n\nTarget I is composed of two regions in the remote sensing results with the north region dominated by epidote and the south region dominated by muscovite (Figure 9). Field work shows that the zone of epidotization is about 10 m wide and extended in E–W direction inside the mafic intrusion (I-1 in Figures 10c–e and 12). The muscovite anomaly zone is induced by the muscovitization of granite in white and red colours (I-2 in Figures 10f, 10g, and 12). No obvious metal mineralization has been found in these samples.\n\nTarget M is a huge quartz vein about 20 to 30 m wide and more than 2 km long (Figure 11b). The quartz vein is highly altered by muscovitization in light green colour (M-1 in Figures 11c, 11d, and 12). Disseminated pyrite has been observed in the quartz vein. The anomalies of Target O are induced by a series of thin quartz veins inside the limestone. No obvious metal mineralization has been found at Target O.\n\nThe spectra of the samples (Figure 12) selected from these targets (H, I, J, M) show obvious absorption from alteration minerals, for example, 2,200 nm feature due to the high content of muscovite and 2,335 nm feature due to the high content of epidote. This also confirms that the SAM results from remote sensing data captured the spectral features from alteration minerals and successfully mapped their spatial distribution."
