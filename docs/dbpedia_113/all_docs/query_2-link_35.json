        "text": "Understand\n\n[edit]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe area around Edmonton, which sits in the geographic centre of the province, was home to native populations for thousands of years before the arrival of European settlers. In 1795, Edmonton House was constructed and work on Fort Edmonton began. The original site was near Fort Saskatchewan, but was relocated near the present day Legislature in 1830.\n\nThe town developed around the fur trade, and in the early days there was little to distinguish it from other such settlements in the area. The first hotel and hospital were built in the 1870s. The latter part of the century saw an influx of wealthy families, and in 1892 the Town of Edmonton was officially founded.\n\nEarly developments were centred around the Quarters area. In 1905, Edmonton was declared the capital of the province of Alberta, and a year later was designated a city. The 1907-1914 period saw the city experience an unprecedented boom, with the population rising from around 6,000 to 78,000. During this period, the University of Alberta was founded\n\nIn 1947 oil was discovered just outside of Edmonton in Leduc county, which spurred a second period of growth, leading to urban sprawl and the development of US-style malls. The Royal Alberta Museum opened in 1967.\n\nThe utilitarian office buildings and condos that dominate the downtown landscape today were mostly constructed in the 1970s.\n\nToday, Edmonton is the hub for energy development and petrochemicals for Alberta. As well, it has become a centre of excellence in research through the University of Alberta and the high technology industries in the region like the National Institute for Nanotechnology.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nIf you want to spend time outdoors, the summer months offer the most opportunities for recreation and entertainment. In the summer, Edmonton offers great outdoor festivals, street entertainment, open-air concerts, and many other world-class entertainment opportunities. Winter is equally exciting, with snow sports for the outdoorsy, extensive indoors shopping in the many malls, and live sports, theatre, and music throughout the city.\n\nEdmonton's climate is \"northern continental\", with a wide range of weather over all four distinct seasons. Edmonton receives 2,300 hours of sunshine per year, making it one of Canada's sunniest cities. Rainfall is low to moderate, and entire weeks can pass without clouds or precipitation through the late spring and summer.\n\nBright green foliage appears in May, signaling spring. Even as the city shakes off its winter chill, cold snaps and the occasional snowfall can still occur. The region's golf courses are generally open by this time.\n\nSummer days generally bring temperatures up to 21 to 25 °C (70 to 77 °F) in June, July, and August, though temperatures will often rise over 30 °C (86 °F) for a few days. Thunderstorms sweep in from time to time during the summer months, usually in the evening. Humidity is relatively low, so warm days are more comfortable than they are in humid climates. At the height of summer, Edmonton enjoys more than 17 hours of daylight, the sun is up from 5:15AM to 10PM, with twilight extending into 11PM in late June.\n\nFall starts in mid-September, bringing bright yellow and orange foliage to Edmonton's treed neighbourhoods and river valley parks. This season ushers in cooler temperatures ranging between 10 and 20 °C (50 and 68 °F) during the day.\n\nWinters are long, but not as harsh as those further east on the Canadian Prairies. Periods of mild temperatures with daytime highs over 10 °C (50 °F) can occur. Such mild weather makes outdoor winter sports extremely popular with the locals. Stop by a local outdoor ice rink to catch the fever of children and adults alike taking part in community hockey. Colder days in Edmonton are kept reasonably comfortable by the low humidity index, but it's wise to have some lip balm and hand cream with you, as the skin and lips can get cracked and chapped quickly in this dry environment. Daylight hours in the winter run from 8:45AM to 4:15PM.\n\nWinter walking and driving are not often affected. Cold snaps with temperatures down to and beyond −30 °C (−22 °F) can occur during the winter, although it's unusual for these frigid spells to last more than 1 or 2 days. Extremely cold temperatures are usually accompanied by the crisp blue skies and bright sunshine of a prairie high-pressure zone. Even regular winter temperatures can feel very cold if there is a noticeable wind: if you are visiting between December and March, be prepared.\n\nTourist centres\n\n[edit]\n\nGet in\n\n[edit]\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nAirport\n\n[edit]\n\nDestinations\n\n[edit]\n\nMost major Canadian airlines service Edmonton. Edmonton's main airport is western Canada's hub to the Northwest Territories.\n\nDirect flights to Edmonton within Canada include from Calgary (1 hour), Charlottetown (4.75 hours), Halifax (5.25 hours), Kelowna (1.5 hours), Moncton (4.5-4.75 hours), Montreal (4.5 hours), Ottawa (4.25-4.5 hours), Prince George (1.5 hours), Regina (1.5 hours), Saskatoon (1.25 hours), St. John's (NL) (5.5 hours), Toronto (4-4.25 hours), Vancouver (1.5 hours), Victoria (1.5-175 hours), Whitehorse (2.5 hours), Winnipeg (2 hours), and Yellowknife (1.75 hours).\n\nFrom the United States, scheduled flights to Edmonton include from Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Las Vegas (3 hours), Los Angeles, Maui, Minneapolis, Nashville, Orlando, Palm Springs, Phoenix, Seattle (2 hours), and San Francisco (3 hours).\n\nFrom Mexico and the Caribbean, seasonal charter flights serve Acapulco, Cancún, Cozumel, Holguin, Huatulco, La Romana, Liberia, Manzanillo, Mazatlan, Montego Bay, Puerto Plata, Puerto Vallarta, Punta Cana, Santa Barbara de Samana, San Jose del Cabo, and Varadero.\n\nFrom Europe, KLM fly a couple of times a week from Amsterdam, and there are summer services from Frankfurt with Condor.\n\nAirlines\n\n[edit]\n\nCanadian airlines operating to Edmonton:\n\nPublic transit\n\n[edit]\n\nEdmonton Transit System's Route 747 connects the airport to Century Park LRT and bus station, every hour during the day (first bus at 4:10AM, last bus shortly after midnight) with half-hour service at peak times. Fares are $5 one-way, no change is given on the bus and tickets are not sold. Free WiFi is provided on the bus. Transfer to the rest of the Edmonton Transit System (see below) requires further payment.\n\nOther ground transportation\n\n[edit]\n\nTaxi service is available, but can be costly (around $55 to downtown or $48 from downtown as of 2020).\n\nUber can both take you to the airport and pick up at the airport from a designated spot outside Door 10 on the lower (arrivals) level.\n\nCar rentals\n\n[edit]\n\nCar rental companies are in the parkade directly across for the terminal for easy pick-up and returns.\n\nThe drive between Edmonton International airport and downtown takes about half an hour. Allow extra time during the morning and afternoon rush hours.\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nEdmonton is the largest city on the Highway 16 (Yellowhead Highway). Edmonton is 3.5 hours east of Jasper on Highway 16. Edmonton is 3 hours north of Calgary on the divided Highway 2 (Queen Elizabeth II Highway).\n\nTravelers unfamiliar with Canadian winter driving should be aware that winter storms can arise suddenly, slowing traffic or closing even major roads for (usually) a few hours. Road conditions are regularly announced on radio if poor weather threatens travel, so check before you leave and every couple of hours on any long drive near Edmonton.\n\nThe two words to watch out for in a winter weather report are \"fair\" and \"poor\". Fair winter driving conditions suggest snow tires, lots of windshield washer fluid, full winter outdoor clothes in case you have to leave the car, and preferably winter driving experience. Poor conditions are the code for \"stay home\". Fortunately, poor conditions rarely last more than one day on major highways, where road clearing takes place continuously. Travelers familiar with winter driving will find the major highways connected to Edmonton generally safe, but should stick to the biggest highway possible as the smaller ones are not as frequently traveled nor as quickly cleared.\n\nFrom Vancouver, Edmonton is best accessed using Highway 1 (the Trans-Canada) east to Hope, then Highway 5 (the Coquihalla) from Hope to the Highway 16 eastbound junction. The average travel time in reasonable weather is 12 to 14 hours, but can be significantly longer if poor winter weather strikes. This is particularly likely on the major inclines between Hope and Kamloops in British Columbia, where poor road conditions can add a few hours to the total trip. Further along the Yellowhead Highway toward Edmonton, communities near the highway are sparse, so judge the driving conditions (and your fuel status) carefully as you proceed.\n\nThe QE II highway from Calgary northward to Edmonton is a very busy thoroughfare in all seasons, and a generally reliable road in winter. It's occasionally closed if winter storms create dangerous road conditions. Fortunately there are many communities near or on the highway where one can shelter if necessary.\n\nUnlike the vast majority of North American cities, Edmonton lacks a straightforward approach into its downtown from its most important intercity highway: Highway 2 (the QE II highway). Northbound traffic on Highway 2 coming in from Calgary or Edmonton International Airport must run a gauntlet of traffic lights on Gateway Boulevard, then make a hard right turn onto Saskatchewan Drive. Both routes from there to downtown—Queen Elizabeth Park Road and McDougall Hill Road—involve at least one hairpin turn to navigate the steep terrain of the North Saskatchewan River Valley. The southbound routes towards Calgary or the airport are even more awkward. The city government is well aware of this issue but has been unable to win popular support for any comprehensive solutions, such as the downtown freeway network proposed in 1969.\n\nTravelers from Saskatoon will find Edmonton about 5 hours away using the Yellowhead Highway, which is divided for the entire route between the two cities. Winter driving awareness is important here, as communities are spaced further apart than on the QE II and you have fewer opportunities to pull over for shelter if road conditions deteriorate.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nOperates the following routes to Edmonton:\n\nBetween Calgary and Edmonton including a stop in Red Deer.

Operates multiple days per week.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Rail travel in Canada\n\nVIA Rail prices are higher than train prices generally in Europe (or even short distances by Amtrak in the United States). Passengers experience leisurely travel through some of the most amazing scenery in the world. Though somewhat more expensive than bus travel, service on a VIA Rail train even in the lowest class is superior to any bus. You can get up and walk around the carriages, dine conveniently, and you will find plenty of legroom in the comfortable seats. However, long delays are common, with no guarantee of on-time arrival.\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nA large part of the city, built before and during the Second World War, is laid out in a grid pattern of straight streets, which makes for easy navigation by car or foot. There are a number of bridges, including the Walterdale Bridge and High Level Bridge, going in and out of the downtown core.\n\nEdmonton's downtown is fairly eclectic, home to many Government of Alberta buildings and modern office towers, including the CN Tower near City Hall and the impressive, white marble-clad Bank of Montreal on 101 Street. Edmonton had some of the most architecturally significant buildings in the province, including the crimson-coloured Citadel Theatre and the church-like spires of Grant MacEwan University.\n\nEdmonton streets are mostly numbered, although there are some named streets: usually major roadways and roads in the newer residential areas. Streets in Edmonton run north-south, while avenues run east-west. The downtown core of the city is centred near 101 St and Jasper Ave (which corresponds to 101 Ave), with streets increasing in number as you go west, and avenues increasing as you go north.\n\nAddresses follow a regular system throughout Edmonton, with even-numbered address numbers are on the north side of avenues and west side of streets. The first two or three digits of a building or house number identify the street it lies just west of, or the avenue it lies north of. For example, 10219-101 Street would be on the east side of 101 Street, just north of 102 Avenue.\n\nSome addresses end in \"NE\" or \"SW\", indicating a different quadrant. If there is none, it is safe to assume it is \"NW\"--almost all of the city's addresses are here. The NE quadrant of the city is mostly farmland, the SW is rapidly booming suburb and big-box stores, and there are no addresses in the SE quadrant. The grid starts are at Meridian Street (0 Street) on the east edge of the city and Quadrant Avenue (0 Avenue) near the south edge, but neither are major streets.\n\nSome older neighbourhoods like Boyle Street have a diagonal grid pattern, with streets NW/SE and avenues SW/NE. During the 1950s and 1960s, roads became less grid-like, but they are still easily navigable (although less easy to follow than the earlier counterparts). Almost all new neighbourhood developments such as Windermere in the southside and the Village at Greisbach in the northwest are designed with more curves, cul-de-sacs and named streets.\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nHighways\n\n[edit]\n\nEdmonton's main east-west highway south of the North Saskatchewan River is Whitemud Drive. It goes through the West and South areas of the city.\n\nAnthony Henday Drive is a ring road in Metro Edmonton. Its final section was finished in 2016.\n\nEdmonton's main highway north of the river is known as Yellowhead Trail (Alberta Highway 16). Travellers wishing to explore downtown Edmonton (and avoid the trendy, but tourist-clogged Old Strathcona on the southside) are strongly encouraged to take this route. Some of the city's most important sites, including the Edmonton Expo Centre and Commonwealth Stadium, are quickly accessible from the Yellowhead.\n\nOther major roads include Groat Road, Mark Messier/St. Albert Trail, the Sherwood Park Freeway, Stony Plain Road and Wayne Gretzky Drive.\n\nBy public transit\n\n[edit]\n\nEdmonton has a safe, efficient and inexpensive public transportation system: the Edmonton Transit Service (ETS). Hundreds of different bus routes cover the city, travelling nearly anywhere you need to go.\n\nService starts at 5AM, with Late Night Owl service on five major routes (including an LRT replacement bus) until 3AM. During peak hours, buses run as frequently as every 15 minutes. Outside of peak, the frequency drops to every 30 minutes and on some routes to industrial areas or far-flung suburbs as infrequent as one service per hour. There are a number of routes which stop running at 8PM-9PM or which only run only during peak hours (6AM-9AM and 3PM-6PM). Some bus routes do not run on Sundays. For more information or to plan your bus trip, you can call Transit Information at +1 780-442-5311 or check out the Trip Planner or Google Maps.\n\nEdmonton's transit system is not unified with those of the nearby communities, but an Arc card can be used for seamless transfers to suburban buses.\n\nEdmonton was the first North American city with a population of under 1 million to have developed a light rail system. (Metro Edmonton population is now over 1 million.) It is a part of the Edmonton Transit Service (ETS), which also runs the buses. The light rail system has three lines: the Capital Line the Metro Line, and the Valley Line. The Capital Line runs from Century Park Station (formerly known as Heritage) via Health Sciences/Jubilee and Churchill Stations to Clareview Station in the northeast section of the city. The Metro Line shares the tracks of the Capital Line from Health Sciences/Jubilee Station to Churchill Station where it branches off to terminate at NAIT (Northern Alberta Institute of Technology) Station. Both lines serve the University of Alberta main campus. The Valley Line runs from downtown to Mill Woods in the Southeast (with an extension to the west, serving West Edmonton Mall) and uses low-floor vehicles, resembling a streetcar line to some aspects.\n\nThe LRT operates between 5AM and 1AM daily. Trains run on a 5-minute frequency during rush hour, ten-minute frequency midday and Saturdays, and on a 15-minute frequency in the evening and on Sundays. When the Metro Line is running at full capacity, train frequency will double between Health Sciences/Jubilee station and Churchill station.\n\nFares are $3.50 with children 12 and under riding free. Day passes can be bought for $9.75 regardless of age group. A pack of 10 tickets can be purchased for $27.75/adult or $19.75/concession and may be better than day passes if you plan only a few trips per day over multiple days. Single trip tickets are valid for 90 minutes and allow return and stopovers within that time limit. Day passes (also called family passes) allow one adult to accompany up to 4 children aged 12 or under at no charge for the children. Tickets can be purchased at the ETS online store, automated fare vending machines located at all LRT stations, or at the ETS Customer Information Centre located on the pedway level of Churchill Station.\n\nBy vintage streetcar\n\n[edit]\n\nThe High Level Bridge Streetcar is a seasonal tram service running from Victoria Day (second last Monday of May) through to Thanksgiving Day (second Monday of October) on a limited but regular schedule. From Victoria Day to Labour Day, the service runs daily. After Labour Day to Thanksgiving Day, the service runs only Saturdays, Sundays and Thanksgiving Day. Operated by the Edmonton Radial Radial Society, a railfan group, the vintage streetcar service has 5 stops between Jasper Plaza (Edmonton/Central) and Old Strathcona (Edmonton/South Central). It crosses the North Saskatchewan River via the High Level bridge offering magnificent views of the river valley and downtown. The line is a convenient way to travel between the area of the Alberta Legislative Building and Old Strathcona. Despite the absence of \"rush-hour\" service, non-tourists occasionally use the line because of its direct route. Warning: Tourist pamphlets for this service may contain an obsolete schedule; get the current schedule from the website. ETS tickets are not valid for this service. The one-way fare is $4 and round-trip fare is $7 (as of 2022) for those ages 6 and up with stopovers permitted. The five stops are:\n\nBy taxi\n\n[edit]\n\nThe most prominent cab companies are:\n\nAll Edmonton taxi companies offer 24/7 service.\n\nSeasonal service\n\n[edit]\n\nBy ride hailing\n\n[edit]\n\nBy bicycle\n\n[edit]\n\nEdmonton has excellent cycling routes which allow for all-year cycling, though winter cycling can be challenging for those unaccustomed to Edmonton weather. These marked routes, combined with a lack of freeways to traverse and relatively low traffic compared to other major cities, low snow or rainfall, and a fairly flat terrain, make Edmonton an easy city to travel by bicycle. The City of Edmonton provides free maps of the bike routes.\n\nDo\n\n[edit]\n\nEdmonton's summer brings many festivals, and with Canada's most impressive mountain parks 3.5-hr drive away, Edmonton is fun year-round. You can expect to find some kind of festival any weekend during the summer months and they are usually located in the central region either around Whyte Ave or downtown at the Legislature grounds or in front of City Hall.\n\nTheatre and music\n\n[edit]\n\nEdmonton has a vibrant performing arts community with notable accomplishments in live theatre and live music. The central area contains the Winspear or Francis Winspear Centre for Music, a new concert hall with stellar acoustics, and the Citadel Theatre, which has hosted major live theatre performances for over forty years.\n\nSouth Central area is home to the theatre district with a number of venues, and the Jubilee Auditorium, a large concert hall. The west end has two dinner theatres, Jubilation's and Mayfield.\n\nRecreation\n\n[edit]\n\nEdmonton's river valley and Mill Creek area have an extensive network of trails, good for walking, biking, and cross-country skiing. At many points in the extensive ravines and forested areas in the river valley, you can't even tell you're in a city. Maps of walking and cross-country skiing trails are available at City Hall, Edmonton Tourism's Visitor Information Centres, and many bicycle and ski shops.\n\nThe Edmonton Bicycle Commuters' Society (EBC), a non-profit bicycle co-op, operates a staffed drop-in DIY workshop where rental bicycles are available. During the summer months, River Valley Adventure rents bicycles and operates Segway tours. Fun group rides occur during the summer, mostly organized by the Edmonton Bicycle and Touring Club (EBTC) and EBC. Most commercial bike shops organize training rides for those road cyclists who are interested in higher intensity workouts. Larger commercial bike shops include United Cycle, Western Cycle, and Revolution Cycle. Smaller ones include Velocity Cycle, Redbike, Hardcore Mountain Bikes, PedalHead Bikes, and Transition BMX.\n\nEdmonton has small downhill ski hills in or near the city, including Edmonton Ski, Sunridge Ski Area, and Snow Valley. Natural and artificial snow cover their slopes from early winter to early spring, offering city skiers an easy way to learn, amuse families, and tone up for the big Rocky Mountain ski opportunities in Jasper and Banff.\n\nGolf\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are over 70 golf courses located in the Edmonton region. Albertans are keen golfers, based on the province's sunny summers, large number of developed courses, and relatively low prices. Within city limits, the City of Edmonton operates three public courses, including Canada's oldest municipal golf course: Victoria (central), Riverside (South) both of which are located close to downtown, and the par-three Rundle Park on the east end of the city (Edmonton/North).\n\nSpectator sports\n\n[edit]\n\nEdmonton is home to a number of professional and amateur sport teams. The Edmonton Oilers of the National Hockey League are the most recognized team and have won five Stanley Cups. Since 2016, they have played at the 18,641-seat Rogers Place, located at the north edge of downtown. This arena replaced the Northlands Coliseum (known from 2003 to 2016 as Rexall Place), which had been home to the team since 1974. Tickets are available, but games are routinely sold out, and tickets must usually be bought from a broker at higher prices. Minor league hockey is also part of the Edmonton sports scene: the major junior Edmonton Oil Kings of the Western Hockey League also moved to Rogers Place from Northlands Coliseum, while several junior 'A' and senior 'AAA' teams play in metro Edmonton. Tickets to these games are available at the door.\n\nEdmonton is also home to the Edmonton Elks (formerly Edmonton Eskimos) of the Canadian Football League. The team has won 13 Grey Cups and plays at the 60,000 seat Commonwealth Stadium. Good seats can be bought in advance, but few games are sold out and tickets can be purchased at the door. There is no professional baseball in Edmonton, but the collegiate Edmonton Riverhawks play at RE/MAX Field in the summer.\n\nThe University of Alberta Golden Bears (men's teams) and Pandas (women's teams) participate in a number of sports including hockey, basketball, volleyball, soccer, football (men only), rugby, and track and field at venues on both the main and south campuses. Smaller universities and colleges in Edmonton also have teams and athletes that compete in a variety of sports.\n\nMajor events and festivals\n\n[edit]\n\nEdmonton, hailed as \"Canada's Festival City\", is home to over 30 annual festivals and special events throughout the year.\n\nAttracting over 500,000 visitors each year, the Edmonton International Fringe Theatre Festival is the largest in North America, second largest in the world, offering some 1,000 performances, primarily in venues in Old Strathcona. The Works Art & Design Festival features new works of painting, drawing, sculpture and other arts. The Whyte Ave Artwalk lets viewers stroll the avenue looking at local art. There is also the Canoe Fest which tells stories about morals and history. For music, Symphony Under the Sky is a nice way to listen to some fine music in the great outdoors. One of the world’s leading Folk festivals, the Edmonton Folk Music Festival is a four-day outdoor music extravaganza that attracts more than 80,000 music lovers. Situated in Gallagher Park in Edmonton's scenic river valley, the festival offers an eclectic mix of music for all tastes. The more popular festivals often sell out, particularly the Folk Festival and many Fringe performances, sometimes well in advance, so visitors should make arrangements for tickets as early as possible to avoid disappointment.\n\nFor culture, Edmonton rolls out the red carpet. Edmonton Pride Festival is a large LGBTQ festival celebrating LGBTQ culture; although it is centred in Old Strathcona and Whyte Ave, festivities take place throughout the city.\n\nEthnic festivals are numerous here, due to Canada's policy of supporting multiculturalism, notably the Ufest: Edmonton Ukrainian Festival (Borden Park, May), Deep Freeze Byzantine Winter Festival (Ukrainian, French, Indigenous, African; Alberta Avenue, January), Flying Canoë Volant (French and Indigenous, Mill Creek Ravine, February); Edmonton Cariwest (Caribbean, Churchill Square, June). To see all the cultures in one place, the biggest cultural festival of all is Heritage Festival (popularly called \"Heritage Days\") where each of more than 60 countries and cultures hosts its own pavilion filled with food, dance, and local goods.\n\nIn food, Edmonton has some festivals to keep you salivating. One of the most popular is A Taste of Edmonton. Purchase tickets and sample culinary delights from 40 of Edmonton’s leading restaurants at Sir Winston Churchill Square.\n\nCasinos\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Edmonton area has seven large casinos: Pure Casino Yellowhead, Pure Casino Edmonton, Grand Villa Casino, Starlight Casino, Century Casino, Century Casino St. Albert, and River Cree Resort & Casino. Century Mile is a casino and horse racing track located at the Edmonton International Airport."
