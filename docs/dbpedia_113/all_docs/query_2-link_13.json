        "text": "Article content\n\nDirections are a funny thing. They can offer an individual a way home or an army a way forward.\n\nThey can even possess a liberating quality.\n\n“You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose,” wrote Dr. Seuss in the children’s book Oh, The Places You’ll Go.\n\nBut in some parts of Edmonton, where incomplete directions can point to addresses 20 km away on the other side of the city, the opposite has proven to be true and inspiration can turn to frustration instead.\n\nRob Gibbard is the general supervisor for the city’s facility and capital planning department. He and his team are responsible for planning large, arterial roadways throughout the city.\n\nHe admits there are some areas that offer confusion.\n\n“When we named Henday or when we named Millwoods Road, we tried to go with Millwoods Road East and Millwoods Road West as a way to try to name them. I’m not sure that it was very successful. It makes it difficult to find your way around without the GPS or a good map,” said Gibbard, who began his obsession with street planning when he was young, doodling new road patterns as an elementary student in Edmonton’s west end.\n\nHe has spent his career trying to make roads as efficient as possible and thinks, for the most part, it is.\n\n“Edmonton has a great road network. The grid system, the number system, for the most part it’s very clear,” said Gibbard, who spent a dozen years working on Calgary’s road systems as well as some time in Vancouver with theirs after graduating from university in Edmonton.\n\nThe history of Edmonton’s road names — and some of the more perplexing ones — began long before that, however.\n\nGibbard explained that the first roads to get a name were likely 100 Street and 100 Avenue (Jasper Avenue today) around the turn of the 20th Century. The idea was to move out from that point in all directions. And things went quite well at first.\n\nBut as the city expanded, it became clear that another tack would have to be taken as numbers crept towards zero.\n\nAt first, some streets were given letters with the numbers, leading to intersections like 17a Avenue NW and 48a Street NW in Mill Woods.\n\nIn the 1960s a plan to build a ring road around the city was first proposed and in the 1970s Anthony Henday Drive began construction. Four decades later, as the highway nears completion, a new issue has surfaced. In short, Anthony Henday and 66 Street SW, for example, exists in two places at once — one at the city’s north end and one almost 25 km away on the south side.\n\nThe same problem occurs in a smaller way with Millwoods Road, where east and west are now used to keep drivers from going in circles.\n\nThe repetition can be frustrating for an average driver. But for fire crews it can mean life and death.\n\n“There’s no area that’s hard to get to,” said Bert Lubbers, emergency communications specialist with the Edmonton Fire Rescue Services.\n\nLubbers is one of the round the clock staff who take calls from people across the city and dispatch fire crews to help them. As fire can double in size in a house every 30 seconds, and the dispatch team deals with an average of 150 events in a day, Lubbers knows getting the right address can be crucial.\n\n“It’s definitely a strategic game we’re playing throughout the day,” he said. “The only problem that we would face is the people not knowing where they are when they call for help. If they’re calling from a cell phone and they don’t know where they are, it’s hard to send out.”\n\nTheir computer system can tell where a land line call is coming from, but as the majority of calls today come from cell phones it is becoming more and more important for callers to be informed.\n\nSenior emergency communications specialist Allison Secord said her team has found ways to help them when a call comes in.\n\n“We just have to be creative. Is there a piece of mail? Go out front, look and see what the address is. Is there somebody else in the home that knows the address? Is there somebody walking by that knows the address?” Secord said, riffling off a list of the questions callers are asked.\n\nOnce an address is obtained, they then double-check to make sure crews are going to the right place, often using the knowledge of everyone in the room to back that up.\n\nSecord said their mapping department is also a huge benefit to avoid dispatching a northwest address when the fire is happening at a southwest or northeast one and keeping dispatch times under the 90-second mandate they face.\n\n“We actually have the best mapping people in the city,” she said, adding police often call on their resources to update their own files.\n\nAs technology becomes more invasive, it is being used more often to speed up those times as well. Secord said Twitter has been used to keep motorists away from accident sites and it is only expected to be more widely used as the city grows.\n\nEdmonton effectively has three quadrants, lacking a SE.\n\nEdmonton’s northwest quadrant is bordered on the east by Meridian Street and the south by Ellerslie Road. Everything south of Ellerslie and west of Meridian is SW Edmonton. Everything north of Ellerslie and west of Meridian is NW Edmonton. The area considered Edmonton NE would be the area of land east of Meridian Street and north of Yellowhead Trail up to the north and eastern boundaries with Strathcona County."
