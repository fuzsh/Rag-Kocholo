        "text": "The Aster neighbourhood in Southeast Edmonton is growing quickly â€“ so quickly that a second playground is now open for play! The new Edmonton Playground in Aster is a beauty! Bright purple and blue, it stood out to us even on a grey winter day!\n\nBlue Imp playgrounds are known for having outstanding obstacle courses and Aster Playground 2 is no exception! There are so many monkey bar and ring variations at this playground that I lost track when I tried to count! Rope climbers are also well featured here, meaning this playground will offer some great options for winter play. Accessory pieces here include a spinner, a four-seat teeter-totter and a dome climber.\n\nThis playground is based in wood chips. At the time of our visit there were not yet benches or picnic tables, but I expect those are still to come. There are no trees for shade."
