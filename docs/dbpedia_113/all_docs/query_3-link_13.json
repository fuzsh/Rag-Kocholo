        "text": "This seed-bearing angiosperm is located in the meadow and wet soil of the OLL. It can also be found in the field. It is located there because it has an aesthetic beauty. It also provides pollen for insects during its blooming seasons, which is late. Additionally, it is found there because the view makes it easily accessible by bees, butterflies and wild animals (deer, wild turkeys) that feed on it. Most importantly, this plant helps to ensure late season pollination.\n\nAsters are herbs with above ground wood. They grow 3-6 feet tall and 2-3 feet wide. The plant dies during the winter because of the cold. It starts growing around mid-summer and establishes its full vegetation. At the ending of summer to the beginning of fall, it starts blooming. It has simple leaflets with alternate arrangement.\n\nThe flower is the reproductive organ. It contains both the stamen and the pistil. The ray floret contains the pistils (unisex: female), while the disk floret contains the stamen (bisexual: male). The aster has composite flowers (a bunch of flowers that appears as one). Asters flower from August to September and late October. Its blooming colors are pink and purple. It has a perfect floral arrangement with both male and female reproductive organs.We do not need more than one specimen to get successful fruits. Because it’s a perfect flower, an individual species might be successful. Fruits are ready October to November and are edible by humans. Tea and root have been used for medicinal purposes to treat serious pains and mental illness.\n\nHumans have use this plant for decorative and medicinal purposes. The flower is mostly used for decoration, while the root and stem is mostly used for healing and the leaves are something use to make tea for medicinal purposes. The family of aster is the largest in the world and the plant New England Aster is the world’s most advanced flower."
