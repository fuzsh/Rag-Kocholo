        "text": "1.1 History\n\nA global glacier inventory was first proposed, in the form of national lists of glaciers, during planning for the International Geophysical Year 1957–58. Progress was initially slow, but accelerated under the leadership of F. Müller during the 1970s, when the product became known as the World Glacier Inventory (WGI). The status of the WGI was assessed by the World Glacier Monitoring Service (Reference Haeberli, Bösch, Scherler, Østrem and WallénWGMS, 1989). A digital version has been available since 1995 from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), Boulder, Colorado, USA (http://nsidc.org/data/glacier_inventory/). It combined the WGI with the Eurasian Glacier Inventory of Reference Bedford and HaggertyBedford and Haggerty (1996) but still covered only ~25% of the global glacierized area. The extended WGI-XF inventory of Reference CogleyCogley (2009a) increased the global coverage to ~48%. Incompleteness aside, the WGI and its variants do not include glacier outlines, making them difficult to use for the global assessment of glacier change. A different initiative was launched in 1995 as GLIMS (Global Land Ice Measurements from Space). GLIMS, led initially by H.H. Kieffer and later by J.S. Kargel, is a consortium of regional investigators contributing glacier outlines in a digital vector format (Reference Raup and KhalsaRaup and others, 2007; Reference Kargel, Leonard, Bishop, Ka¨a¨b and RaupKargel and others, in press). The GLIMS inventory, which has an extensive set of attributes, has grown steadily, but it too remains incomplete. In mid-2013, its coverage was 58% of global glacierized area, although it has multitemporal coverage of several thousand glaciers.\n\nThus, half a century of work has yielded only two globally complete digital depictions of glacier extent: GGHYDRO (Reference CogleyCogley, 2003), a raster product compiled in the early 1980s, and the vectors of the Digital Chart of the World (DCW) of Reference DankoDanko (1992). Like DCW, GGHYDRO is highly generalized, but it has been used in several global-scale assessments (e.g. Reference Raper and BraithwaiteRaper and Braithwaite, 2006; Reference Hock, De Woul, Radić and DyurgerovHock and others, 2009; Reference Radić and HockRadić and Hock, 2010). Other assessments (e.g. Reference Meier and BahrMeier and Bahr, 1996; Reference Ohmura, Sparling and HawkesworthOhmura, 2004; Reference Dyurgerov and MeierDyurgerov and Meier, 2005; Reference Raper and BraithwaiteRaper and Braithwaite, 2005) have relied on separate indirect estimates of global aggregate information. Not all assessments have included the peripheral glaciers around the two ice sheets.\n\nIn recognition of the importance of baseline information for the assessment of glacier changes, the idea of a complete inventory of the world’s glaciers has been strongly endorsed by international organizations such as the World Meteorological Organization (2004).\n\nFree access to the US Geological Survey’s archive of Landsat imagery (Reference Wulder, Masek, Cohen, Loveland and WoodcockWulder and others, 2012) has both stimulated and facilitated the mapping of glacier extent at regional and broader scales. The failure of the scan-line corrector of Landsat 7’s Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor in May 2003 (Reference Markham, Storey, Williams and IronsMarkham and others, 2004) limited the subsequent usefulness of that archive, but other sensors have offered a further stimulus by making possible, by stereographic or interferometric mapping, the construction of DEMs and thus the subdivision of ice bodies along drainage divides and the calculation of topographic and hypsometric glacier attributes. These products include the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) global DEM and the DEM of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission of February 2000. Their advantages and disadvantages are discussed by Reference Frey and PaulFrey and Paul (2012). In addition, several collaborative international projects, such as GlobGlacier (Reference Paul, Ka¨a¨b, Rott, Shepherd, Strozzi and VoldenPaul and others, 2009a) and Glaciers_cci (Reference Paul, Bolch, Ka¨a¨b, Nagler, Shepherd and StrozziPaul and others, 2012), have facilitated inventory-related data collection and production. Finally, the most immediate stimulus for rapid assembly of the RGI was the need for a globally complete inventory to meet the goals of the recently completed contribution of Working Group I to AR5 of the IPCC.\n\nThe RGI was planned by an ad hoc group that assembled four times between December 2010 and December 2011. One of the meeting venues, Randolph, New Hampshire, USA, gave its name to the resulting product. The members of the group pooled material already in their possession and approached other colleagues individually, and solicited additional contributions from the Cryolist (http://cryolist.org) and GLIMS communities and other sources. More than 60 colleagues from 18 countries contributed, making the RGI a truly global initiative.\n\n2.1 Glacier outline generation and data sources\n\nParts of the RGI were compiled at several institutions, but the inventory was assembled in its entirety at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. The earliest version consisted of DCW outlines, which were then replaced by outlines from GLIMS where available. Further additions of new or replacement outlines from contributors were assimilated, checked and if necessary revised using standard vector-editing tools. All outlines were transformed when necessary to the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) datum.\n\nMost of the glacier outlines in the RGI with known dates were derived from satellite imagery acquired in 1999 or later. Various Landsat platforms, principally Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+, were the primary sources, and imagery from ASTER, IKONOS and SPOT 5 high-resolution stereo (HRS) sensors was also used. In northernmost Greenland, the RGI draws on the ice mask of the Greenland Mapping Project (Reference Howat, Negrete and SmithHowat and others, 2014). For most regions automatic or semi-automatic routines were used to map glaciers based on the distinctive spectral reflectance signatures of snow and ice in simple and normalized band-ratio maps (e.g. Reference Le Bris, Paul, Frey and BolchLe Bris and others, 2011). Some outlines were produced by manual digitizing on satellite imagery or on scanned digital copies of maps.\n\nGlacier complexes (unsubdivided ice bodies) were subdivided into glaciers either by visual identification of flow divides or with semi-automated algorithms for detection of divides in a DEM (Reference Bolch, Menounos and WheateBolch and others, 2010; Reference Kienholz, Hock and ArendtKienholz and others, 2013). These algorithms use standard watershed delineation tools to build a preliminary map of ice ‘flowsheds’ which are then merged, based on chosen thresholds for the proximity of their termini, to form glaciers. The Bolch algorithm was applied in western Canada, parts of Alaska, Greenland and parts of High Mountain Asia. The Kienholz algorithm was developed, calibrated and quality-checked in Alaska and Arctic Canada South, and was applied without quality assessment in several other regions, where errors due to subdivision will be governed primarily by the quality of the DEM.\n\nSome of our source inventories have been published only recently, including Reference NuthNuth and others (2013) for Svalbard, Reference Rastner, Bolch, Mölg, Machguth, Le Bris and PaulRastner and others (2012) for Greenland, and Reference Bliss, Hock and CogleyBliss and others (2013) for the Antarctic and Subantarctic. These three sources represent 5%, 12% and 18% of global glacier extent respectively. During assembly of the RGI, many GLIMS contributions of restricted extent were replaced by outlines from sources with more extensive coverage. However, the RGI outlines in British Columbia, the Caucasus and Iceland come entirely, and those in China mostly, from GLIMS, and there are also limited contributions in Central Asia and Alaska. GLIMS has therefore contributed at least 10% of the RGI coverage. The RGI still draws on the DCW for ~1% of global ice extent in northern Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. In the Pyrenees, Iran and parts of North and Central Asia, the RGI records ‘nominal glaciers’ for which only location and area are available. They are represented by circles of the area reported in the WGI or WGI-XF, and account for <0.3% of global glacierized area. One glacierized region, Chukotka in easternmost Russia, does not appear in the RGI because the locations of its 17 km2 of glaciers (Reference SedovSedov, 1997) were unobtainable.\n\n3.3 A case study: South America\n\nIn earlier versions of the RGI, various factors obliged us to select satellite images of South America that in some cases showed extensive seasonal snow. Because it is time-consuming, the visual inspection needed to correct automatically generated outlines for the seasonal snow was not always possible. In RGI 3.2 we have corrected much of the resulting overestimate of glacier area by identifying images of better quality, but because seasonal snow was apparent in all available images our estimated ice cover in South America, 31 670 km2, may still be too large. There is no authoritative estimate for comparison; WGMS (1989) gives estimates for the South American nations which sum to 25 900 km2, but they are mostly undated and all involve some guesswork for unsurveyed regions.\n\nWe therefore assembled repeated measurements of the glacierized area of 37 South American subregions from the literature and compared them to corresponding sums of areas of RGI glaciers (Fig. 5). Where possible, we interpolated linearly from the bracketing dates of the independently measured areas from the literature to the date of the RGI image covering the subregion; where necessary, we extrapolated linearly, by from 0.5 to 9 years. (See www.igsoc.org/hyperlink/13j176/13j176supp.pdf for references.)\n\nIn five subregions where there are multiple independent measurements, the measurements differ, with standard deviations ranging from 1.2% to as great as 38%. After averaging these multiple measurements, the deviations ∆ = (S – S ind) /S ind between RGI areas S and independent areas S ind range from –68% (–63 km2) to +149% (+150 km2). The RGI total, 25 842 km2, is 5.4% greater than the independent total, 24 506 km2, and the mean and median of the absolute deviations | | are 30% and 13% respectively.\n\nWe conclude that area errors of tens of percent or more are possible in either or both of the RGI and the independent areas. Equation (1) (with k = 1) probably represents the best case, in which researchers have estimated uncertainties explicitly, although in a variety of ways. We are aware of further biases, due to one or more of the problems illustrated in Figure 3, in regions other than South America. For example, Reference Gardelle, Berthier, Arnaud and Ka¨a¨bGardelle and others (2013) found an average discrepancy in area of only –1.1% between RGI 2.0 and seven of their eight SPOT 5 scenes in South Asia, but in the eighth, in southeastern Tibet, RGI 2.0 has an extent 88% greater than their estimate. Many RGI contributions, notably in Alaska, Arctic Canada North and South, Greenland, Svalbard, the Russian Arctic, Central Europe and parts of South Asia West, are significantly more accurate than such worst-case examples. However, for the RGI as a whole we do not know how strongly the probability distribution of the errors is skewed by gross errors, so it seems prudent to scale Eqn (1), which captures an important part of the error structure, to reflect the likely non-normality of the error distribution. The sample of errors in Figure 4 and the sample of differences in Figure 5 both fail tests for goodness of fit to the normal distribution. Departures from normality are not surprising if we consider the difficulty of correcting for erratically variable seasonal snow, and equivalently the difficulty of recognizing debris-covered ice. It is also true that widely variable methods reduce the comparability of uncertainties estimated by different analysts.\n\nHow to correct Eqn (1) is not obvious, because the main sources of uncertainty, being heterogeneous across regions and data sources, are not amenable to handling with conventional statistics. Moreover, although Figure 5 suggests that Eqn (1) is likely to underestimate the uncertainty, a further consideration is that we have applied Eqn (1) to glaciers, rather than to glacier complexes as would be preferable because of the cancellation of errors at divides; a test calculation based on glacier complexes in the Russian Arctic yielded an area error of only ±1.2% as against ±2.8% for glaciers. As an interim measure pending further investigation, we set the correction factor k in Eqn (1) to 3 (a number chosen arbitrarily).\n\n4.2 Glacier areas\n\nThe total glacierized area in the RGI is 726 800 km2 (Table 2). The region with the most ice is the Antarctic and Subantarctic (132 900 km2), followed by Arctic Canada North with 104 900 km2. The regions with the least ice are the Caucasus and Middle East (1140 km2) and New Zealand (1160 km2). Of the total extent, 44% is in the Arctic regions (Arctic Canada North, Arctic Canada South, Greenland, Svalbard and Russian Arctic) and 18% in the Antarctic and Subantarctic. High Mountain Asia (i.e. Central Asia, South Asia West and South Asia East) accounts for 16% and Alaska for 12%. The uncertainty in total regional area depends on the distribution of glacier areas, which we discuss below. According to Eqn (1), regional uncertainty is as small as ±1.9% in the Antarctic and Subantarctic, where Reference Bliss, Hock and CogleyBliss and others (2013) assumed an uncertainty of ±5%, and exceeds ±10% in five regions with relatively small glaciers.\n\nThe total ice-covered area in RGI 3.2 is similar to earlier estimates (Table 3). Excluding Greenland and Antarctica, the largest deviation from the RGI in Table 3 is +7% (the areas determined by Reference Meier and BahrMeier and Bahr (1996) and Reference Dyurgerov and MeierDyurgerov and Meier (2005)), consistent with an uncertainty of the order of ±3.5%. The analysis in Section 3, however, suggests a somewhat greater uncertainty. The RGI area is the smallest of the entries. This is partly because some of the earlier estimates include 6000–8000 km2 of ice in the Subantarctic, which in the RGI is included in the Antarctic and Subantarctic region and thus excluded from this column of the table. Glacier shrinkage between older and newer sources of regional information may also account for some of the difference. When the Greenland and Antarctic glaciers are included, earlier estimates differ from the RGI by as much as –6% and +8%. These differences mainly reflect substantial improvement in the sources of information. Reference Rastner, Bolch, Mölg, Machguth, Le Bris and PaulRastner and others (2012) identified considerably more peripheral ice in Greenland than most previous investigations, and Reference Bliss, Hock and CogleyBliss and others (2013) relied mainly on the Antarctic Digital Database (ADD Consortium, 2000), a more accurate source than those of earlier estimates.\n\nTidewater glaciers account for 39% of the total RGI extent. This statistic, reported earlier by Reference GardnerGardner and others (2013) using RGI 3.0, is valuable because it is the first entirely measurement-based estimate of the potential importance of tidewater glaciers among the world’s glaciers. It appears to confirm that the under-representation of calving glaciers and frontal ablation in mass-balance measurement programmes is more serious than calculated by Reference CogleyCogley (2009b), in whose dataset only 3% by area of the glaciers with glaciological measurements were tidewater glaciers. Including glaciers with geodetic measurements, the proportion rose to 16%, still well below the new RGI estimate.\n\nIn contrast to ice-sheet modelling, most modelling of glacier mass balance necessarily focuses on the climatic mass balance because the modelling of frontal losses due to dynamics is relatively underdeveloped, and more seriously because basic information required for the assessment of possible rapid dynamic responses of tidewater glaciers is only starting to be collected. Concrete evidence of rapid dynamic response is provided by Reference Burgess, Forster and LarsenBurgess and others (2013) for Alaska, where only 14% of the region’s glacier area is drained through tidewater outlets, but calving accounts for 36% of the regional loss rate. We expect that improved estimates of the extent of tidewater glaciers will aid in the determination of dynamical mass losses.\n\nThe proximity of glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica to the ice sheets requires care to avoid double-counting or omission by different groups working on large-scale cryospheric analyses. For example, gravimetric measurements of mass change by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites have low spatial resolution and are unable to distinguish the peripheral glaciers from the ice sheets. In Antarctica the implications of proximity are reduced, but not eliminated, because the RGI excludes the mainland. In Greenland the RGI includes all the peripheral glaciers, each of which is assigned a connectivity level CL (through RGIFlag; see Table S2 (http://www.igsoc.org/hyperlink/13j176/13j176supp.pdf)). The three values of CL represent glaciers that are unconnected, weakly connected or strongly connected to the ice sheet; the basis and methodology for these assignments are explained by Reference Rastner, Bolch, Mölg, Machguth, Le Bris and PaulRastner and others (2012). We follow their suggestion that the strongly connected CL2 glaciers, with an extent of 40 400 km2, be regarded as part of the Greenland ice sheet, yielding an area of 1 718 000 km2 for the ice sheet including the CL2 glaciers. (The CL2 glaciers are nevertheless included in the RGI shapefile for Greenland.) The areas of the CL0 (unconnected; 65 500 km2) and CL1 (weakly connected; 24 200 km2) glaciers sum to 89700 km2.\n\nThe frequency distribution of glacier areas is shown in Figure 6. Acknowledging that some very small glaciers may be omitted by virtue of the imposition of minimum-area thresholds, it is nevertheless clear that the area distribution is dominated by large glaciers. Glaciers with areas between ~4 and ~1500 km2 account for two-thirds of the ice cover.\n\nThe distribution of standard errors in Figure 6 is based on Eqn (1) with k = 3 (Fig. 4). As follows from the form of Eqn (1) and the frequency distribution of the areas, smaller glaciers contribute more to the total uncertainty than do larger glaciers. In the smallest-size bin of Figure 6 the standard error of total bin area implied by Eqn (1) is 44%, while in the largest-size bin it is 0.9%. Of the uncertainty of 4.7% (34 000 km2) in the total area, two-thirds is contributed by glaciers with areas between ~1 and ~500 km2.\n\nFigure 7 shows cumulative frequency distributions of glacier areas separated by first-order region. In seven regions the 50th percentile of the distribution (the ‘median area’) is smaller than 2 km2. The median area ranges upward to 181 km2 in Arctic Canada North, 351 km2 in Iceland and 706 km2 in Antarctica. In every region the mean area is con siderably less than the median area, reflecting the prominence of smaller glaciers in the size distribution of glacier numbers.\n\nWith the possible exceptions of Central Europe and the Antarctic and Subantarctic, the regional size distributions of glacier numbers (Fig. 8) exhibit a common pattern in which numbers increase steeply from the smallest-size class towards a maximum, typically between 0.25 and 1 km2. Beyond this inflection, numbers decrease at a rate that varies little from region to region, with a tendency to steepen towards the largest-size class.\n\nThe inflection is due, to an unknown extent, to under-recording of glacierets and other very small glaciers, whether because of the imposition of a minimum-area threshold, or coarse DEM resolution, or for other reasons. Over-recording, by systematic misidentification of small (as opposed to large) snowpatches, is also possible. If we neglect this possibility because we are unable to quantify it, a lower bound on the underestimate due to under-recording is obtained by assuming that the RGI always distinguishes correctly between glacierets and snowpatches: no glacierets are omitted, and the underestimate is zero. An upper bound can be obtained by assuming that inverse power-law scaling, as suggested by the form of the size–frequency curves at larger sizes (Fig. 8), continues in reality down to the smallest sizes. For each region (inset of Fig. 8) we extrapolate the line connecting the most numerous class and its next larger neighbour, and sum the quantity S × [n× (S) – nRGI(S)] from the WGI minimum, s min = 0.01 km2, to sx , the size of the most numerous class. Here nx (s) is the extrapolated estimate of the ‘real’ number and n RGI(s) is the number of RGI glaciers of size s. The result is 10 180 km2 if we sum the 19 extrapolates, and 7819 km2 if we sum the regional glacier numbers and repeat the calculation for the entire world. Thus the underestimate of global total area due to omission of glacierets appears to lie between zero and an upper bound of 1.1–1.4%. The upper-bound calculations also imply a large increase in the total number of glaciers over that suggested in Section 4.1, to 462 000 for the region-by-region calculation and to 435 000 for the global calculation.\n\n4.4 Glacier volume and mass\n\nWorking with WGI-XF (Reference CogleyCogley, 2009a), Radić and Hock (2010) produced an upscaled estimate, 600 ± 70 mm SLE (sea-level equivalent), of global glacier volume including glaciers around the ice sheets. This estimate was obtained by volume–area scaling (Reference Bahr, Meier and PeckhamBahr and others, 1997). One estimate relying on RGI 1.0, and three on RGI 2.0, have appeared recently (Table 4). Radić and others (2014) reduced the earlier Radić–Hock estimate to 522 mm SLE. Most of the reduction was ascribed to the availability of the RGI, which made upscaling unnecessary. An alternative assumption about the prevalence of ice caps, used by Radić and others (2014) as part of their assessment of uncertainty, made the global total lower still, at 405 mm SLE. Reference Marzeion, Jarosch and HoferMarzeion and others (2012), working with RGI 1.0, modelled regional ice volumes by volume–area scaling, but because they excluded glaciers in Antarctica the global total suggested in Table 4 for their work, 468 mm SLE, is a rough estimate and is not independent of the three other estimates. Reference Huss and FarinottiHuss and Farinotti (2012) estimated a total of 423 ± 57 mm SLE, based on a simple model of the glacier dynamics implied by the distribution of glacier surface elevations. Reference GrinstedGrinsted (2013), relying on a multivariate extension of volume–area scaling and on a different minimization criterion during calibration of the volume–area relationship, estimated a lesser total of 350 ± 70 mm SLE.\n\nThe range of the estimates of total mass in Table 4 is 28% of their average (412 mm SLE). Explaining this spread is beyond the present scope, but some of the dispersion can be attributed to the rapid evolution of the RGI. For example, glaciers should not be aggregated for volume–area scaling, so glacier complexes, which were more numerous in RGI 1.0 and 2.0, dilute the accuracy of three of the estimates. Moreover, except in the Antarctic and Subantarctic, even RGI 3.2 offers no way to distinguish mountain and valley glaciers from ice caps. Volume–area scaling exponents for ice caps, whose thickness is large by comparison with the relief of their beds, are known to differ from those of mountain and valley glaciers (Reference Bahr, Meier and PeckhamBahr and others, 1997). The studies differed in their handling of this difference of scaling behaviour. The work of Huss and Farinotti may be less affected than the other three, although they noted that in Arctic Canada South, where separate sets of outlines were available for glaciers and glacier complexes, the total volume obtained by modelling the glaciers was 7% less than that obtained by modelling the complexes.\n\nReference Bahr and RadićBahr and Radić (2012) show that, for some purposes, glaciers in the smallest size classes of a given sample can contain a significant fraction of the total volume of the sample. They suggest that, at the global scale, an accuracy in volume of ±1% requires inclusion of all glaciers larger than 1 km2. At regional scales the threshold for a given desired accuracy depends on the size distribution. Where the largest glacier is of the order of 100 km2, total regional volume can only be estimated to ±10% or better if the minimum-area threshold is 0.01 km2 or smaller. In some regions, therefore, more accurate estimates of volume will require more complete inventories of the smallest glaciers."
