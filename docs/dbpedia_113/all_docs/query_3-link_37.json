Here we review recent progress on aster structure and dynamics in zygotes and early blastomeres of Xenopus laevis and Zebrafish, where cells are extremely large. Mitotic and interphase asters differ markedly in size, and only interphase asters span the cell. Growth of interphase asters occurs by a mechanism that allows microtubule density at the aster periphery to remain approximately constant as radius increases. We discuss models for aster growth, and favor a branching nucleation process. Neighboring asters that grow into each other interact to block further growth at the shared boundary. We compare the morphology of interaction zones formed between pairs of asters that grow out from the poles of the same mitotic spindle (sister asters) and between pairs not related by mitosis (non-sister asters) that meet following polyspermic fertilization. We argue growing asters recognize each other by interaction between anti-parallel microtubules at the mutual boundary, and discuss models for molecular organization of interaction zones. Finally, we discuss models for how asters, and the centrosomes within them, are positioned by dynein-mediated pulling forces so as to generate stereotyped cleavage patterns. Studying these problems in extremely large cells is starting to reveal how general principles of cell organization scale with cell size.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMicrotubule asters – radial arrays of microtubules radiating from centrosomes – play a central organizing role in early embryos. Ray Rappaport was fascinated by the question of how asters, in particular pairs of asters, induce cleavage furrows. One of his most celebrated discoveries (Rappaport 1961) was that neighboring pairs of microtubule asters can induce cleavage furrows in echinoderm embryos whether the asters arise from the poles of the same mitotic spindle (which we will call sisters) or from juxtaposed poles of two different spindles (which we will call non-sisters). This discovery had a profound influence on subsequent thinking in the cytokinesis field. How microtubules communicate with the cortex is the subject of other articles in this volume. Here, we will take a more microtubule-centric perspective, and ask: how do asters grow, how do they interact with other asters, and how are they positioned in the cytoplasm? These processes determine where aster pairs will interact with the cortex, and thus define cleavage plane geometry. We will discuss how these processes occur in zygotes and early blastomeres of amphibians and Zebrafish, which provide convenient experimental systems, but also represent extremely large cells. Comparison with similar processes in smaller cells will reveal how conserved, microtubules-based spatial organizing mechanisms scale with cell size.\n\nThe amphibian Xenopus laevis and the fish Danio rerio (Zebrafish) are easy to rear in the laboratory, and offer complementary technical advantages. Xenopus eggs cleave completely and are easy to fertilize with one or multiple sperm and to microinject. They are opaque, which precludes live imaging of internal events, but fixed embryos can be cleared for immunofluorescence imaging by immersion in a high refractive index medium (Klymkowsky and Hanken 1991, Becker and Gard 2006). Importantly for us, essentially undiluted cell-free extracts can be prepared from Xenopus eggs which recapitulate much of the biology of the early embryo and are highly tractable for biochemical manipulation, physical manipulation and live imaging (Desai et al 1999, Maresca and Heald 2006, Chan and Forbes 2006). Early Zebrafish embryos are meroblastic, i.e. they do not cleave completely. Their animal pole region is yolk-free and transparent, which allows live imaging. Zebrafish are highly tractable for classic genetics, and transgenic lines that stably express GFP-tagged proteins can be generated easily. The mechanisms we discuss are broadly conserved in evolution, and important comparison systems with smaller cells include embryos of marine invertebrates, C. elegans and Drosophila as well as somatic cells. Drosophila offers an interesting biological twist in that early divisions are syncytial, so aster growth and interactions are uncoupled from cytokinesis for the first 12 cell cycles.\n\nXenopus and Zebrafish zygotes and early blastomeres are extremely large cells, with zygotes ~1200μm and ~600μm in diameter, respectively. They are also unusually fast compared to somatic cells, in the sense that the cell cycle takes 20-30 min to complete at room temperature (the first cell cycles are longer). These sizes and speeds represent physical extremes compared to typical somatic cells, which may require special adaptations of conserved cell organizing mechanisms, and/or reveal underappreciated intrinsic capabilities of those mechanisms. One well-studied example is adaptation of replication origins for very fast genome duplication (Blow 2001). Here we will focus on adaptations of aster growth and interaction mechanisms that allow rapid and accurate spatial organization on a scale of hundreds of μm. This is much larger than the molecular length scale, and may even be larger than the microtubule length scale inside the aster.\n\nAster growth in large cells\n\nThe question of how microtubule asters grow in extremely large embryo cells has received little attention, but we believe that answering it will reveal principles of size scaling and unexpected molecular mechanisms. and illustrate aster morphology and growth during the first and second cell cycle in frog and fish embryos. Inspection of these and similar images (Wühr et al 2009, 2010, 2011) suggests that the structure of large interphase asters in these embryos does not conform to the standard model, where all microtubules radiate as straight lines from a single point at the centrosome. Rather, the microtubule network in the asters appears bushy and single microtubules or thin bundles at the aster periphery appear wavy or curved ( last panel). Least consistent with the conventional model, microtubule density at the aster periphery appears to remain constant, or increase, with aster radius ( ) and time ( ). These images forced us to re-consider the standard model for aster growth, and how it scales with cell size.\n\nillustrates the standard model for aster growth, which we call the radial elongation model. Centrosomes nucleate microtubules and hold on to minus ends, while plus ends elongate in a liner trajectory by addition of GTP-tubulin. This mechanism was inferred from analysis of nucleation and elongation in cultured mammalian cells and isolated centrosomes (Bergen et al 1980, Brinkley et al 1981, Brinkley 1985). It remains the standard model for animal cells, though many instances are known where microtubules nucleate from locations other than centrosomes (reviewed in Lüders and Stearns 2007). We believe there is a fundamental problem in scaling the radial elongation model to large cells. Microtubule density at the periphery must decrease with aster radius in this model. In extremely large cells the density of microtubules at the periphery would become so low that signaling to the cortex to initiate cytokinesis might become impossible. This problem could be solved, theoretically, by increasing centrosome size. Centrosome size does indeed scale with cell size in C elegans embryos (Decker et al 2011), and centrosomes in marine invertebrate embryos can be many microns in diameter in the first cell cycle ( ), Asnes and Schroeder 1979, Strickland et al 2004, Foe and von Dassow 2008). It is difficult to precisely define interphase centrosome size in images of early frog and fish embryos. However, by both microtubule ( , ) and γ-tubulin staining ( ) centrosomes appear small compared to cell size, suggesting there may be an upper limit to centrosome size, as there is to spindle length (Wühr et al 2008). It thus appears that the problem of scaling aster size to cell size in very large cells is not solved by scaling centrosome size. illustrate various candidate additions or alternatives to the radial elongation model to solve the size scaling problem and account for observed aster morphology. Whatever the molecules involved, the mechanism by which a growing aster adds new microtubules as it’s radius increases must generate an approximately constant density at the periphery, with plus ends pointing on average outwards.\n\nillustrates a model in which microtubules are nucleated within the aster as it grows, but away from the centrosome. Nucleation could occur from the side of existing microtubules like Arp2/3 nucleation of actin (Pollard and Borisy 2003), from Golgi membranes within the aster (Efimov et al 2007, Rivero et al 2009), or from some other location. We currently favor this class of model based on morphology and precedent from other systems. Microtubule nucleation from the sides of pre-existing microtubules has been observed in several systems, including the cortex of higher plant cells (Murata et al 2005, Chan et al 2009, Kirik et al 2012), and in cytoplasmic bundles in S pombe (Samejima et al 2006). In both cases γ-tubulin complex is recruited to the side of pre-existing microtubules where it nucleates and holds on to a new minus end. The regulators are best characterized in S pombe, where the Mto1.Mto2 complex recruits γ-tubulin to the side of pre-existing microtubules, and activates it to nucleate (ibid). A similar function was proposed for the Augmin/Haus complex in the mitotic spindle and cytokinesis midzone complex of animal cells (Uehara et al 2009). Structural studies of γ-tubulin ring complexes predict that the complex needs to undergo a conformational change to become active in nucleation (Kollman et al 2011). Microtubule nucleation is, in general, poorly understood at a biophysical level, and pure proteins reconstitution studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which γ-tubulin is recruited and activated in any system. A recent study showed that a centrosomal γ-tubulin recruitment factor, CDK5RAP2, could stimulate nucleation by isolated γ-tubulin complexes (Choi et al 2010), an encouraging step towards full reconstitution. In favorable immunofluorescence images we observe a diffuse glow of γ-tubulin in large asters in Xenopus embryos ( ), but its significance is unclear.\n\nillustrates a model in which microtubules continually release from the centrosome and slide outwards. This mechanism was posited to account for non-centrosomal microtubules in neurons (Ahmad and Baas 1995), and astral microtubules have been shown to detach and slide outwards during anaphase-telophase in tissue culture cells (Rusan et al 2002). We know that dynein exerts outward pulling force on astral microtubules during anaphase-telophase in early embryos (discussed below). The same force might well cause outward microtubule sliding, so this model is plausible.\n\nillustrates a model in which the growing aster captures microtubules that were nucleated outside the aster, for example by the cortex or distributed organelles. Possibly consistent with this model, prometaphase asters in tissue culture cells capture and orient non-centrosomal microtubules using dynein (Rusan et al 2002), though this activity probably requires a mitotic state of the cytoplasm where dynein acts to cluster minus ends (Gatlin et al 2009). We currently disfavor this model as a major aster growth mechanism in early frog and fish embryos because we do not observe many microtubules in the cytoplasm between the expanding aster periphery and the cortex, but we cannot rule it out.\n\nAn important question is whether the unusual aster growth mechanisms illustrated in apply in other cells. In echinoderm zygotes (~50-200 μm in diameter) astral microtubules appear radial in metaphase, but more complex in anaphase-telophase (Strickland et al 2004, Foe and von Dassow 2008). In we show images of microtubules in metaphase and anaphase in zygotes of Cerebratulus, a nemertean ribbon worm with eggs ~100μm in diameter, kindly provided by George von Dassow (Oregon Institute of Marine Biology). At 1st metaphase, most microtubules appear to radiate from large centrosomes, and the density clearly drops with radius ( ). These images are consistent with all microtubule initiating at centrosomes and growing out to the cortex, as has been shown in C elegans embryos by EB1 tracking (Srayko et al 2005). At anaphase-telophase the microtubule distribution appears to change. Microtubule density no longer decreases with radius as strongly, and some degree of bushiness is evident towards the periphery ( ). Microtubules also appear more bundled. This kind of image suggests that one or more of the mechanism illustrated in may operate at telophase in zygotes that are smaller than Xenopus and Zebrafish, but still large compared to somatic cells.\n\nAster size in frog and fish embryos is temporally controlled by the cell cycle, with important implications for growth mechanisms and embryo organization. Aster radius at the poles of the first metaphase spindle is ~30-40μm in Xenopus ( , Wühr et al 2008,) and similar in Zebrafish ( , min, Wühr et al 2010). In both cases this is much smaller than the zygote radius. Asters grow dramatically at anaphase onset, presumably due to decreased activity of Cdk1 (Cdc2.Cyclin B) kinase. In mitosis, Cdk1 acts on a complex network of microtubule interacting proteins to promote catastrophes (growing to shrinking transitions) and limit length (Belmont et al 1990, Verde et al 1992, Niethammer et al 2007). Microtubule growth in this regime was termed “bounded”, because while the lengths of individual microtubules fluctuate by dynamic instability, the average length does not increase with time (Verde et al 1992). Aster radius at metaphase, when Cdk1 activity is high, is presumably limited by the length distribution of microtubules in this bounded regime. Cdk1 levels drop shortly after fertilization, and at anaphase onset (reviewed in Morgan 2006). This lowers the catastrophe rate, and allows microtubules to grow longer. Experiments in Xenopus extract suggest growth of individual microtubule may become unbounded in interphase (Verde et al 1992), so in principle single microtubules might elongate continuously from the centrosome to the cortex, hundreds of μm in early frog and fish embryos. The actual length of individual microtubules in large interphase asters is currently unknown. If microtubules are in fact short compared to aster radius, as is the case for Xenopus meiosis-II spindles (Burbank et al 2006), a serious re-think of aster mechanics will be required.\n\nCell cycle regulation of aster size has important implications for spatial organization of the early embryo. In early frog or fish blastomeres metaphase spindles are centrally located, and their short astral microtubules do not reach the cortex ( , Wühr et al 2009, 2010). Thus, metaphase spindles cannot position themselves relative to the cell cortex using their astral microtubules as usually proposed. In smaller embryos, such as sea urchin, C elegans and Cerebratulus ( ) astral microtubules reach the cortex in metaphase, and metaphase spindle can position themselves. In early divisions in frog and fish, the centrosome pairs that initiate the spindles are pre-positioned by astral microtubules during the preceding interphase (Wühr et al 2010). Following anaphase onset, asters rapidly grow to span the whole cell, and touch the cortex, by one or more of the mechanisms illustrated in . Touching the cortex is presumably required for asters to position cleavage furrows (reviewed in Rappaport 1996), though von Dassow et al (2009) recently suggested that asters can communicate to the cortex without physical contact. How asters communicate with the cortex is addressed by other articles in this volume.\n\nAster-aster interactions\n\nWhat happens when two neighboring asters grow to touch each other? This question was of great interest to Rappaport, since cleavage furrows are typically induced where and when microtubules growing from aster pairs meet at the cortex. shows three possibilities drawn from the literature, where the consequence of aster-aster interaction depends strongly on the system and cell cycle state. When asters grow from nearby centrosomes in pure tubulin, their microtubules simply interpenetrate ( , see examples in Brinkley et al 1981). This is expected because the microtubules are too far apart in three dimensions to physically bump into each other. When two asters meet in mitotic Xenopus egg extract, they adhere, then move together and fuse ( , Gatlin et al 2009). Movement and fusion are driven by dynein in this system, presumably cross-bridging between two microtubules. When two asters meet during interphase in frog and fish embryos, their microtubules do not interpenetrate and the asters tend to move apart ( , Wühr et al 2010). Aster movement is again driven by dynein, but in this case the dynein is presumably anchored in the cytoplasm (discussed below), rather than to another microtubule, so it produces force in the opposite direction. An effect of cell cycle state on aster-aster interaction was also noted in echinoderm embryos using EM (Asnes and Schroeder 1979). Microtubules from the two asters of one spindle interpenetrated at the equator during metaphase. During anaphase-telophase there was no interpenetration at the equator, despite the fact that astral microtubules radiating away from the equator were longer on average. This classic observation suggests that some factor blocks aster interpenetration specifically during anaphase-telophase. More recent immunofluorescence images suggest some astral microtubule do cross the equator at anaphase-telophase ( ), though this may be system-dependent.\n\nAsters grow into each other in early embryos under different circumstances. Two asters grow out from the poles of each mitotic spindle at anaphase, and meet each other at the mid-plane of the cell ( , ). We will call these “sister asters”. The name traditional name for a pair of sister asters is the “amphiaster” (Wilson 1925), from the Greek “amphi-” meaning “on both sides”. The mid-plane between the asters has been called the “diastem” (ibid) or “diastema” (e.g. Wakabayashi and Shinagawa 2001), meaning space or gap between two structures. More recently the term “telophase disc” was coined to describe the analogous location in somatic cells (Andreassen et al 1991). We will use the term “aster-aster interaction zone” for this mid-plane, to emphasize the process by which it forms. Non-sister asters meet in the zygote following polyspermic fertilization, when each sperm centrosome nucleates an aster, and after anaphase following polyspermy or cytokinesis failure, when asters growing from the poles of separate spindles meet. Examples of interactions between non-sister asters following polyspermic fertilization, before and after 1st mitosis, are shown in . Polyspermy is abnormal in Xenopus (and most frogs) and Zebrafish, but normal in many pleurodeles (newts and salamanders) (Fankhauser 1948, Iwao 1989), including axolotl ( ). In naturally polyspermic pleurodele zygotes, the excess male pronuclei and centrosomes that do not capture the single female pronucleus are destroyed by an unknown mechanism around prophase of 1st mitosis (Fankhauser 1948). This mechanism for eliminating excess nuclei and centrosomes is missing in frogs, so forced polyspermic fertilization leads to multiple spindles and multiple cleavage furrows ( ).\n\nThe most characteristic consequence of aster-aster interaction in interphase frog and fish embryos, seen for both sister ( , ) and non-sister ( ) pairs, is that the two asters do not interpenetrate deeply. Rather, they interact and then seem to repel each other. Based on images from living and fixed embryos, recently supplemented by images from asters interacting in egg extract, we believe aster interpenetration is blocked by formation of a specialized interaction zone at the mutual boundary. This zone exhibits certain common morphological features: (i) aster-aster interaction zones tend to define sharp planes that conceptually divide the cytoplasm, (ii) they exhibit an apparently lower (but non-zero) density of microtubules relative to nearby parts of the aster, (iii) microtubules in the interaction zone may be organized in bundles, presumably anti-parallel, that are aligned approximately normal to the plane defined by the zone ( ). These morphological aspects of interaction zones strongly suggest that they act as boundaries that inhibit aster expansion and limit microtubule length, and that interaction between anti-parallel microtubules lie at their core. The apparently lower microtubule density in interaction zones could be wholly or partly an imaging artifact. Midbody microtubules tend to exclude antibody staining, presumably due to steric effects. Antibody exclusion is presumably responsible for the dark zone between separating chromatids in the sea urchin image in , and could contribute to lowered signal in interaction zones seen by immunofluorescence in Xenopus ( ). Exclusion of the ensconsin-GFP probe very likely contributes to lower intensity in aster-aster interaction zones in fish ( ). However, lower microtubule density is also observed using directly labeled tubulin in egg extracts ( ) and Zebrafish embryos (Wühr et al. 2011), so we suspect at least part of the drop in tubulin signal in the interaction zone is real, and reflects lower microtubule density there.\n\nDespite common features, there are reasons to suspect that not all aster-aster interaction zones are the same. Most notably, furrows are induced where the interaction zones between sister asters reach the cortex after 1st mitosis, and not where interaction zones between non-sisters reach the cortex, in the frogs Rana fusca and Xenopus laevis, ( , Brachet 1910, Render and Elinson 1986, Wakabayashi and Shinagawa 2001). This is the opposite result from that Rappaport (1961) obtained in his celebrated toroidal cell experiment in echinoderm eggs, where the interaction between non-sister asters from two different spindles efficiently induced furrows if they were sufficiently close together. Non-sister asters also generated furrows at their interaction zone in tissue culture cells (Savoian et al 1999) and C elegans embryos (Baruni et al 2008). It is unclear why non-sister asters fail to initiate furrows in frogs, and this system may be useful for discriminating interaction zone molecules that are, and are not, required for furrow induction.\n\nWhat molecules are likely to mediate aster-aster interactions in early frog and fish embryos? To our knowledge, no molecule has been specifically localized to aster-aster interaction zones in frog or fish embryos, but one logical set of candidates are molecules that organize cytokinesis midzone complexes in smaller cells (reviewed in Glotzer 2005, Eggert at al 2006). Midzones, also called “central spindles”, are barrel-shaped assemblies composed of anti-parallel microtubule bundles that form between separating chromosomes in anaphase. Later, in telophase, they mature into midbodies, and this maturation is accompanied by re-localization of the microtubule organizing proteins (Hu et al 2012). Midzones in small animal cells and interaction zones between sister asters in large embryo cells are functionally analogous, and share key features of (i) anti-parallel microtubule overlap at their center, (ii) limited polymerization at plus ends in the overlap region and (iii) assembly in a cytoplasm where Cdk1 activity recently dropped, but Aurora B and Plk1 kinases are still active. Phragmoplasts, anti-parallel microtubule arrays that direct formation of a new cell wall during cytokines in higher plants, also share some or all of these attributes. These similarities suggest organization by similar molecules. Consistent with this possibility, the midzone in C elegans zygotes, which is larger than a typical somatic midzone, though still much smaller than aster interaction zones in frogs and fish, is organized by essentially the same molecules as somatic midzones (Glotzer 2005).\n\nMidzones are organized by three conserved protein modules or complexes (Glotzer 2005, Eggert et al 2006): (i) Aurora B kinase complex or “Chromosome Passenger Complex” (CPC) (Ruchaud et al 2007), (ii) Kif4/PRC1 and (iii) Kif23/RAPGAP1. Kif23 is also called CHO1 and MKLP1, RAPGAP1 is also called MgcRacGap and Cyk4, and the complex between them is also called Centralspindlin. We currently hypothesize that overlap between anti-parallel microtubules (in the appropriate cell cycle state) is the feature that allows plus ends at the periphery of the two asters to recognize each other, though alternative models discussed in Wühr et al (2009) have not been ruled out. At least two of the conserved midzone-organizing proteins (PRC1 and Kif23) are known to mediate interactions between anti-parallel microtubules (Nislow et al 1992, Mishima et al 2002, Mollinari et al 2002, Subramanian et al 2010), and are thus candidates to mediate recognition between the peripheries of two growing asters. Once formed, interaction zones must somehow inhibit aster growth and deep interpenetration by growing plus ends. A candidate for this function is Kif4, a kinesin with plus end directed motor activity that also inhibits plus ends polymerization in vitro (Bringmann et al 2004) and in somatic midzones (Hu et al 2011). Kif4 can be targeted to anti-parallel overlaps by interaction with PRC1 (Bieling et al 2010). It will be interesting to test which midzone proteins localize to sister and non-sister interaction zones in frog and fish embryos. Aurora B localized to anti-parallel microtubule bundles close the cleavage furrow in Zebrafish, and was required for normal microtubule organization and furrowing, but was not clearly recruited to interaction zones (Yabe et al 2009). We expect aster-aster interaction zones will share important molecular and organizational mechanisms with somatic midzones, but that additional mechanisms may be required to adapt a conserved organizing principle - interaction between anti-parallel microtubules coupled to local recruitment of polymerization inhibitors - to very large length scales.\n\nAster and centrosome positioning\n\nHow asters, and the centrosomes at their centers, position themselves within embryos was also of great interest to Rappaport. Aster movement in large embryo cells is driven mainly by cytoplasmic dynein pulling on microtubules (Gönczy et al 1999, Grill and Hyman 2005, Wühr et al 2010, Kimura and Kimura 2011). Pushing forces can also contribute to aster centering, and may dominate in small cells (Tran et al 2001, Howard 2006), but pulling by dynein is thought to dominate in large cells. Aster movements can be broadly classified into those that tend to center centrosomes within the cell, and those that tend to move them away from the center. The canonical example of centering is migration of the sperm centrosome, and its associated pronucleus, to the center of the zygote (Wilson 1925, Hamaguchi and Hiramoto 1986). The canonical example of de-centering is movement of one spindle pole towards the posterior cortex during metaphase-anaphase in C elegans zygotes (Hyman 1989). The mechanistic distinction may hinge on whether dynein pulls from bulk cytoplasm (centering), or from localized regions on the cortex (de-centering). Complex cleavage patterns, such as spiral cleavage (Wilson 1925), may depend on a complex interplay of centering and de-centering movements. Here, we will focus on centering, which predominate in early Xenopus and Zebrafish cleavage divisions.\n\nHamaguchi and Hiramoto (1986) postulated that the sperm centrosome centers in the zygote due to length-dependent pulling forces on astral microtubules, combined with limitation of microtubule length by interaction with the cortex. Their model was based on elegant experiments where local inactivation of colcemid with UV light was used to artificially control microtubule length distribution in echinoderm embryos. Recent mathematical models support the concept that asters center by pulling forces that increase with microtubule length (Kimura and Onami 2005, Minc et al 2011, Shinar et al 2011). Hiramoto et al suggested that motor-dependent forces that move vesicles and polystyrene beads towards centrosomes generate counter-forces that pull microtubules in the opposite direction (Hamaguchi et al 1986, Hamaguchi and Hiramoto 1986). In C elegans, dynein centers the sperm aster by pulling from anchor sites on endosomes and lysosomes, and a candidate anchoring protein has been identified (Kimura and Kimura 2011), which confirms and extends Hiramoto’s hypothesis.\n\nWe hypothesized that Hiramoto’s basic idea, which is cartooned in , can be extended to all centrosome movements in early frog and fish embryos simply by adding length-limitation by aster-aster interaction zones (Wühr et al 2010). Asters grow longer on the side away from the zone ( , , ), so they should engage more dynein on that side, and thus move away from the zone. An example of centrosome movement away from an interaction zone is shown in the last panel in . In this model interaction zones and the cell cortex influence asters in the same way, by limiting their growth, and thus total microtubule length projecting in a particular direction. Accordingly, asters will naturally space out between each other and the cortex, as is seen for aster spacing in polyspermy (Brachet 1910, Herlant 1911, ). More complex models are possible, of course. For example, interaction zones might accumulate specific molecules that locally influence motor proteins.\n\nPerhaps the most intriguing unexplained aspect of aster and centrosome movement is orthogonal orientation of successive cleavage planes in embryos with an orthoradial cleavage pattern (Wilson 1925). In Xenopus, the first three cleavage planes are approximately orthogonal to each other in three dimensions in most embryos. shows an example of the orthogonal relationship between the 1st cleavage plane (running north-south) and the presumptive 2nd planes which will run east-west, cutting through the interactions zones between sister asters in each blastomere. The first plane cuts through the sperm entrance point (Black and Vincent, 1988), and the first two planes both cut parallel to the animal-vegetal axis. Early Zebrafish blastomeres (which do not cleave completely) are confined to two dimensions, presumably because the yolk-free cytoplasm is laid down as a sheet in the oocyte. Successive cleavage planes are approximately orthogonal in two dimensions.\n\nAlthough cleavage plane geometry is stereotyped in frog eggs, it is not rigidly pre-specified. Changing the shape of the egg, or the distribution of yolk within it (Chung et al 1994), can override intrinsic tendencies to cleave with a particular geometry. In a classic example, frog eggs squeezed into elongated shapes cleave normal to the imposed long axis (Pflüger 1884, Hertwig 1893), overriding the intrinsic tendency of the first cleavage furrow to bisect the sperm entrance point. Rappaport (1996) explored may variations of this kind of experiment in echinoderm eggs. The plasticity in cleavage plane geometry revealed by this kind of experiment suggests that the orthogonal orientation of successive planes is not a consequence of some hard-wired property of the system, such as the angle between mother and daughter centrioles, but is rather an emergent property that depends on aster shape and forces within asters.\n\npresents a model for orthogonal orientation of successive cleavage planes based on Hiramoto-pulling ( ) combined with microtubule length limitation by aster-aster interactions (Wühr et al 2010). Key to this model is our observations that the two centrosomes within each aster split apart as the dome-shaped aster grows during telophase (examples shown in for frog and the last panel in for fish). The next metaphase spindle will set up on the axis defined by centrosome splitting at this stage (ibid). We hypothesize that the dome shape of the aster causes asymmetries in microtubule lengths, and therefore in dynein pulling forces pulling on centrosomes. These pull the centrosome pair apart along the longest axis of the aster, which is parallel to the interaction zone ( ). Some additional asymmetry is required to orient centrosomes relative the z-axis in , equivalent to the animal-vegetal axis in the zygote. We do not understand this aspect, though we suspect it depends on the gradient of yolk in the z-axis. cartoons the equivalent model for orientation of the first cleavage plane by compression of the egg (Pflüger 1884, Hertwig 1893), along with images from a recent repeat of this experiment where we demonstrated that the axis between centrosomes is already orientated in prophase, implying the geometry of the compressed egg is sensed by the sperm aster before 1st mitosis (Wühr et al 2010). Minc et al (2011) built a mathematical model of situations similar to in sea urchin zygotes, and tested it by systematically deforming the egg into different shapes. The agreement they found between experiment and model is encouraging, but it is important to realize that , Kimura and Onami (2005), Wühr et al (2010) and Minc et al (2011) all make untested assumptions about the spatial distribution of microtubules, and the forces acting on them. It is also notable that these models fail to predict or explain the wavy, somewhat disorganized appearance of individual microtubules and bundles at the aster periphery (evident in ). It is not clear if pulling force-per-unit-length models are still valid if individual microtubules are shorter than the aster radius. Many questions remain as to how asters and centrosomes are positioned in early embryos.\n\nCell-free reconstitution of interphase aster growth and interaction\n\nIt will be difficult to elucidate the molecular and biophysical mechanisms involved in aster dynamics using whole, living embryos as the only experimental system, especially in Xenopus where the egg is opaque. The related problem of meiosis-II spindle assembly in Xenopus eggs was tackled using cell-free extracts that accurately recapitulated the assembly process and greatly facilitated imaging and perturbation experiments (Desai et al 1999, Maresca and Heald 2006). Xenopus egg extract is essentially undiluted cytoplasm with abundant organelles and vigorous energy metabolism (Niethammer et al 2008). We recently modified this system to mimic polyspermic fertilization ( ). We observed rapid growth of large interphase asters and formation of aster-aster interaction zones when asters grew into each other (e.g. arrows in , 42 min). Aster morphology in this system recapitulated key aspects noted in embryos by immunofluorescence and live imaging, including “bushy” peripheries, locally low density of microtubules in interaction zones, and a tendency of closely spaced nucleating sites to split apart within single asters. This system should facilitate progress on molecular and biophysical mechanisms that underlie aster dynamics in large embryo cells.\n\nQuestions and directions\n\nIn closing we will highlight key questions from each section of this review where we need to uncover new molecular and biophysical mechanisms. (i) Aster growth: what is the mechanism for keeping microtubule density constant as aster radius expands? If microtubules nucleate away from the centrosome as we suspect, what is the mechanism? (ii) Aster-aster interaction: how do growing asters recognize each other when they touch, and how does this recognition lead to inhibition of aster growth? To what extent are interaction zones between sister and non-sister asters similar at the molecular level, and why do only the former induce furrows in frog zygotes at 1st mitosis? (iii) Aster positioning: can we find further experimental validation for the Hiramoto model for aster centering? How do centrosomes split apart within growing asters, and what determines the axis on which they separate?\n\nAnswering these questions will surely require interdisciplinary approaches that combine imaging, biochemistry, genetics, physical perturbation, force measurement and computational modeling. Different biological systems have complementary advantages for these approaches, and we expect that Xenopus egg extract will prove particularly versatile. Vertebrate embryos with extremely large cells, where aster dynamics operate at a physical extreme, will help elucidate not only general principles of physical organization of cells, but also how these principles scale with cell size.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by GM39565.
