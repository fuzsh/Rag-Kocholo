        "text": "A night-time thermal image from the ASTER satellite sensor, of the western New territories of Hong Kong is compared with a daytime Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) thermal image obtained nineteen days earlier. Densely built high rise areas which appear cool on daytime images are conversely, relatively warm on nighttime images, though the temperature differences are not well developed at night. Lower temperature gradients between different land cover types observed on the night time image result in meso-scale, rather than micro-scale climatic patterns being dominant, suggestive of processes operating in the Urban Boundary Layer (UBL), as opposed to the Urban Canopy Layer (UCL) which is dominant in the daytime. Thus, at night, proximity to extensive cool surfaces such as forested mountain slopes appears to be influential in maintaining cooler building temperatures. The relevance of satellite-derived surface temperatures for studies of urban microclimate is supported by field data of surface and air temperatures collected in the study area. Comparison of the ASTER Kinetic Temperature standard product with a thermal image processed using locally derived emissivity and atmospheric data indicated higher accuracy for the latter.\n\nIn densely urbanized regions, the local climate is greatly influenced by the urban morphology, including interactions between buildings, space, and human activities. The Kowloon Peninsula in Hong Kong, with some of the greatest urban population densities in the world, represents an extreme case of the influence of the built environment on climate, with high-rise buildings, narrow street canyons, and little green space. In this study, the building frontal area index (FAI), a parameter for estimating aerodynamic resistance of the urban surface as a predictor of wind ventilation, was derived from a three-dimensional building database. The relationship between FAI and urban heat island intensity (UHII) from an Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) satellite image was calculated at different scales. The highest correlation (r = 0.574, n = 4900) was obtained at 100 m resolution, which suggests that the optimum operational scale of FAI is 100 m resolution for the study area, i.e. the scale and size at which FAI impacts on the urban climate. The presence/trend of any higher correlation at different resolutions was tested using the nonparametric Mann–Kendall test, and the results show that the statistic Z-value generated from the test is smaller than the hypothesis significance levels of 90%, 95%, and 99%; thus, the hypothesis of having a higher correlation at any scale other than 100 m resolution is rejected. Planning authorities may use the FAI generated at 100 m resolution for designing wind ventilation corridors across Hong Kong at this scale, especially when temperature and air quality in the inner city are of major concern. However, for applications to other cities with different standard morphologies, the FAI–UHII relationship should be re-evaluated.\n\nThis study investigates the spatial variability of air temperature over Hong Kong using in situ air temperature recorded from a mobile traverse combined with an ASTER thermal satellite image. Three different degrees of urbanization in Hong Kong, including city downtown (Kowloon), suburban areas (Yuen Long and Shatin), and rural countryside (Tai Mo Shan and Lam Tsuen) are analysed. The spatially variable relationship between air and surface temperature was evaluated using two spatial averaging techniques, namely spatial resampling and buffering around air temperature points. The strength of the correlation coefficient was tested for every decreasing resolution and the appropriate spatial scales of air temperature in urban, suburban and rural areas were found to be 200 m, 450 m and 700 m, respectively. The differences in the spatial scales of air temperature in these regions are attributed mainly to structural factors of land cover such as city block size, building density and percentage of green areas, and secondarily to the climatic conditions being operating in, and which commonly typify these individual regions. Thus small scale lengths in the urban area corresponded to heterogeneous land cover, a well developed urban boundary layer, low wind speeds and a low lapse rate, whereas longer scale lengths were observed in suburban and rural areas having more homogeneous land cover, higher wind speeds and higher lapse rate.\n\nThe aim of this study is to characterize the urban heat island (UHI) intensity in Hong Kong. The first objective is to explore the UHI intensity in Hong Kong by using the mobile transverse and remote sensing techniques. The second objective is to produce a satellite-derived air temperature image by integrating satellite remote sensing with a mobile survey, the methodology involved in making simultaneous ground measurements when the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) satellite made an overpass. The average UHI intensity of Hong Kong was about 28-3.58C, although a very high value of 128C UHI was observed on a calm winter night by ASTER. The satellite-derived surface temperature was compared with the in situ measurements. The bias was found to be only about 1.18C. A good correlation was also found between the in situ surface and air temperature pair of readings at nighttime on 31 January 2007. The linear regression lines of temperatures in urban and suburban areas were then used to convert the satellite-derived surface temperatures into air temperatures. The satellite-derived air tempera- tures showed a good correlation with temperatures observed by 12 fixed stations. It is possible to derive the nighttime air temperature from the satellite surface temperature on calm and clear winter nights.\n\nThe reconstruction of urban climate is still challenging to climatologists in spite of over five decades of research including direct data measurement and model building. Methods for measuring and monitoring urban climate have strengths and weaknesses depending on the application. The mapping of patterns of urban heat stress over a city is not useful if the patterns depicted apply only to the time of data acquisition. Since thermal satellite sensors can now provide detailed temperature data covering whole cities and beyond, their adoption in urban planning depends on demonstrating their relevance to commonly prevailing conditions. This research investigates and presents a methodology based on four summertime ASTER thermal satellite images of Hong Kong for urban heat stress mapping at detailed level. It demonstrates that satellite images obtained under certain climatic conditions, and accompanied by adequate 'in situ' ground data, can provide a basis for an operational heat stress mapping system. The temporal limitation of thermal satellite images is examined for both day and nighttime images by comparison of image-derived air temperatures with ground data representing extended periods and other hot days and nights outside the image acquisition times. The nighttime images were found to be more representative of air temperature at other times than the daytime images, due to a more stable boundary layer, with lower wind speeds and temperature inversion at night. The nighttime images showed high and significant correlations with ground level air temperatures for an average 13-h period surrounding the image time 10.42pm, from 6 pm to 4-8 am the next day. Additionally they were highly and significantly correlated with ground air temperature distributions on 93% of all hot summer nights in the same years. Therefore the nighttime images can be considered representative of a commonly occurring summer nighttime situation in Hong Kong, and can be used to determine the locations of areas where temperatures commonly exceed hot weather warning thresholds. Notably, the images were better able than climate stations to represent areas in the urbanized Kowloon Peninsula and several smaller satellite towns which exceeded hot weather warning thresholds. Many areas exceeded the thresholds, even when no hot weather warning was in force, due to the unrepresentative location of climate stations. The images were also more able than climate stations to indicate the hottest and coolest areas over the Hong Kong territory, thereby enabling measurement of the magnitude and extent of the urban heat island."
