        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe modeling of wildlife habitat using empirical data and expert knowledge is becoming increasingly important for integrated resource management. Land managers have moved beyond simple representations of species distribution and attempt to capture and predict spatial variation in habitat quality (Elith 2000). Despite these recent refinements, models for a given species often address only one measure of habitat quality (Singleton et al. 2002, Mueller et al. 2008). For species with complex ecological requirements, more than one habitat indicator is often required to better account for the multifaceted interactions between habitat and species' use of the landscape (Johnson 2007). As an additional challenge, in disturbance-prone landscapes, dynamic changes may substantially alter habitat quality for a given species. Simulating effects of disturbances would broaden the scope of habitat models by integrating an important agent of habitat change (Kareiva and Wennergren 1995, Johnson 2007).\n\nThe landscape's capacity to provide nutritional resources (food), to access to movement corridors across space and among resource patches (functional connectivity), and to protect from or facilitate predation risk are common influences on the behavior of organisms and their perception of habitat (Lima and Dill 1990, Taylor et al. 1993, Haddad et al. 2003, Nielsen et al. 2010). The availability and quality of food resources are prerequisites for habitat. At a landscape scale, nutritional resources may control population numbers as nutrition often influences reproductive potential and the survival of offspring (Parker et al. 2009, Peters et al. 2010). Landscape connectivity is also important for population persistence (Epps et al. 2005, Kindlmann and Burel 2008) and is a strong indicator of habitat quality for diverse groups of vagile species (Kareiva and Wennergren 1995, Fischer and Lindenmayer 2007). For all but top predators, predation risk is a strong driver of behavior, as mobile species have to balance the relative risk of encountering predators with acquiring food (e.g., choosing to move into a less sheltered area to consume nutritious herbs; Lima and Dill 1990). The risk of predation is a function of predator and prey behavior and their interactions with habitat structure. Certain landscape features promote predator success, while others provide prey species with refugia from predation. For example, linear features may improve access and mobility for predators and thus increase prey encounters, whereas high-elevation areas and dense forests limit mobility and are more often free of predators (Rettie and Messier 2000, Whittington et al. 2011, Gervasi et al. 2013). In areas dominated by large and intense disturbances, all three of these landscape components of habitat quality may undergo dramatic changes over a short period of time.\n\nIn the boreal forest of North America, large and severe wildfires are the primary landscape-organizing disturbance. Wildfires shape the landscape mosaic and generally determine postfire community assemblages (Hunter 1993, Weber and Flannigan 1997). The frequency, size, season, and severity of wildfires strongly affect habitat quality for many organisms, as wildfires kill stands of mature trees, alter the understory, and consume soil organic matter. Habitat availability may be substantially altered by wildfire if a major source of food is removed, or regenerates through postfire vegetation changes (Zouaoui et al. 2014, Lord and Kielland 2015). Wildfires may also have a direct impact on predation risk by removing predator refugia, or by increasing the density of other prey species (Courtois et al. 2007, Latham et al. 2011, Dussault et al. 2012). Severe wildfires fragment forest habitat, reducing connectivity for those species that require features provided by mature forests, but maintaining a mosaic of stand ages on the landscape (Hunter 1993, Fischer and Lindenmayer 2007). This prevailing disturbance co-occurs with anthropogenic disturbances in much of the southern boreal forest, where tree removal from forest harvesting or other industrial land uses, such as mining, may exceed the area influenced by wildfire in ecosystem importance (Wulder et al. 2008).\n\nLand managers are often responsible for multiple species and populations distributed over large regions. Thus, they require tools that provide spatially explicit landscape-scale information, enabling management responses that are highly specific to the region or species of interest (Turner et al. 1995, Drescher et al. 2013). Many empirical tools for assessing habitat quality exist (e.g., habitat suitability index models, resource selection functions, site-level scoring methods), but few are suitable for areas exceeding 1 Mha, a scale adequate to represent a boreal fire regime. In response to this management challenge, we developed a framework to model spatial habitat quality in the face of dynamic disturbance by integrating three components of habitat quality. The framework is demonstrated using boreal woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou; hereafter, caribou) as an example species. We set out to (1) produce an adaptable and modular spatial framework to model habitat quality, (2) examine how different methods of combining the separate components into indices of habitat quality influence overall habitat quality estimates, (3) compare habitat quality indices created with the inclusion or exclusion of simulated disturbance, and (4) analyze spatial patterns of habitat quality for caribou, resulting from the influence of simulated disturbance from wildfire.\n\nResults\n\nEach of the habitat quality components produced distinctive patterns across the landscape and contributed unique information to the IHQs. Differences in the distribution of habitat quality components also led to unique results in the two study areas. In the Alberta study area, values for nutritional resources spanned the entire theoretical range from 0.01 to 0.99, whereas in Québec the minimum nutritional value was 0.21 and the maximum only 0.87 (Table 1, Fig. 4a, b). Associated with this difference in ranges, the median relative nutritional value was higher in the Québec study area with a smaller variance (Table 1). Connectivity in Alberta varied widely across the landscape, with highly connected regions distributed relatively evenly across the study area. In comparison, highly connected pixels clustered in the northeast of the Québec study area, with major corridors constrained by large lakes that channel caribou movement (Fig. 4, Table 1). The predation risk metric also showed distinct spatial patterns in the two study areas. The Québec study area had a lower overall predation risk. In Alberta, the majority of pixels had a relatively high predation risk >0.38 (median 0.39), although a wide range of predation risk values were represented, with a minimum value close to 0 and a maximum of 0.8. In contrast, the median predation risk value in the Québec study area was 0.43, with a much narrower range of values and a maximum of only 0.45 (Table 1, Fig. 4e, f).\n\nComponents Min Max Mean Median Standard deviation Alberta Nutritional resources 0.01 0.99 0.52 0.42 0.31 Landscape connectivity 0.31 1.00 0.66 0.67 0.10 Predation risk 0.03 0.76 0.38 0.39 0.14 IHQadd 0.00 1.00 0.54 0.49 0.22 IHQmult 0.00 1.00 0.42 0.34 0.23 IHQlimit 0.00 1.00 1a … … Québec Nutritional resources 0.21 0.87 0.52 0.50 0.12 Landscape connectivity 0.27 0.99 0.55 0.57 0.10 Predation risk 0.20 0.45 0.41 0.43 0.04 IHQadd 0.00 1.00 0.50 0.48 0.10 IHQmult 0.00 1.00 0.41 0.38 0.11 IHQlimit 0.00 1.00 0.67a … …\n\nThe three habitat components were correlated with the IHQadd, but the extent of the correlation varied, indicating different levels of importance to the overall IHQ. In Alberta, the majority of a pixel's habitat quality score was a function of the nutritional component (ρ = 0.9), whereas in Québec, connectivity and nutrition together were the major contributors to the habitat quality score (ρ = 0.6; Table 2), despite the lower weight of the connectivity component in the combined index. Landscape connectivity and predation risk were of approximately equal importance to the final IHQ scores in Alberta. In Québec, predation risk contributed the least to the IHQ value of a pixel.\n\nIndividual habitat quality components also contributed distinct spatial patterns to IHQadd (Fig. 5). In Québec, the nutritional resources component added spatial complexity to the representation of integrated habitat quality (Fig. 5); its exclusion produced a more homogenous landscape with fewer, large patches of habitat classes, and a lower overall patch density (the number of patches of habitat quality classes per unit area). In Alberta, however, the effect of including nutritional resources was to increase overall heterogeneity of habitat quality. In both study areas, the landscape connectivity component was responsible for a spatial smoothing of habitat quality, and its removal produced more fragmented IHQ maps with smaller and more numerous patches of habitat quality classes (Fig. 5; Appendix S2: Table S2.2). In terms of spatial pattern, predation risk primarily influenced the high end of the distribution of habitat quality, and had little effect on the low and very low IHQ classes. In Alberta, the inclusion of predation risk in the IHQ increased the density and number of patches of very high-quality habitat, and lowered the mean patch area of this class (Appendix S2: Table S2.2). In Québec, the effect was slightly different, producing similar increases in the patchiness of the spatial distribution of high-quality habitat, but with little change to the very high class (Fig. 5).\n\nThe different methods of combining the habitat components produced distinct representations of habitat quality, although some patterns were consistent among methods (Fig. 6). The areas of very high-quality habitat were generally the least sensitive to the IHQ method, with this category experiencing the fewest changes to a pixel's original percentile in both study areas, relative to the additive method (Appendix S2: Table S2.3). Low-quality pixels were also robust to class changes, especially in areas of permanent anthropogenic land-cover change. Shifts in pixel classes were typically an increase or decrease in one level of habitat quality (a change of one percentile), with only three pixels in Québec increasing in represented habitat quality by two classes, using the different combination methods. The non-limiting component method produced the most dramatic shifts in classifications with the majority of pixels classified as a different level of habitat quality in both study areas, relative to IHQadd (Appendix S2: Table S2.3). Using IHQlimit, pixels rarely increased from very low to very high quality relative to IHQadd; the majority of pixels shifted by one class, or remained unchanged. Very high-quality habitat (in Alberta) and high-quality habitat (in Québec) were the least likely to change using the IHQlimit method. The additive and multiplicative IHQs represented areas of caribou habitat nearly identically (ρ = 0.99; Fig. 6). The habitat quality distribution produced by IHQlimit differed slightly, but was nonetheless highly correlated with the other two methods (Alberta ρ = 0.90, Québec ρ = 0.61).\n\nThe inclusion of simulated wildfire in the framework altered the spatial distribution of habitat quality where disturbance from wildfire has the greatest potential to occur (Appendix S2: Table S2.3). The effect of simulated wildfire was essentially neutral overall, as it both increased and decreased habitat quality depending on land cover and stand age. Simulated wildfires provided nutritional benefits to caribou in some areas, despite increasing predation risk and reducing winter forage in others. Pixels of high-quality (in Alberta) and very high-quality habitat (in both study areas) were the least likely to be altered by the inclusion of simulated wildfire (Appendix S2: Table S2.3). The IHQ was especially sensitive to the inclusion of fire in conifer-dominated forests in Québec and in coniferous forests and sedge-fens in Alberta (Appendix S2), as these fuel types allowed simulated fires to occur most frequently.\n\nDiscussion\n\nHabitat managers require insight and tools to make management decisions at multiple spatial scales across dynamic landscapes (Leblond et al. 2014, Brooks 2016). By creating and testing a multi-component model of habitat quality and considering fire likelihood, we produced a useful framework for application in this management context. The resulting framework is easily modifiable for use with other areas, species, and disturbance processes by incorporating relevant information for the system or species under study. Concerning caribou, our results suggest that habitat quality is highly heterogeneous and sensitive to the impacts of simulated wildfire. Although different combination schemes produced different values, mapped habitat quality was largely consistent, regardless of the method used to create an IHQ. The maps produced by the model enabled the identification of large-scale spatial distributions of habitat quality, but also provided fine-scale detail, for a refined analysis of local dynamics.\n\nPatterns of long-term habitat quality\n\nJohnson (2007) suggested that IHQs must quantify multiple components of habitat quality to be accurate. To limit this type of bias, our framework captures landscape heterogeneity and its influence on three components of habitat quality: nutritional resources, landscape connectivity, and predation risk, defined for caribou. We represented the overall quality of habitat by combining these chosen components into an IHQ. The integration of the three habitat quality components employed in our framework summarized the overall habitat quality holistically, providing a broad representation of habitat for caribou.\n\nThe three IHQ combination methods produced different maps of habitat quality, but areas of very high- and very low-quality habitat were found at consistent locations across the landscape. This indicates the classifications were robust throughout the spectrum of habitat quality values. We regularly identified mature coniferous forests, bogs, and fens as high-quality habitat for caribou in both study areas, emphasizing the relative importance of these habitat types. Anthropogenic disturbances were also of high importance in determining habitat quality for caribou. For example, in Alberta, areas with extensive seismic exploration recurrently provided the worst-quality habitat, regardless of the IHQ method, because the probability of caribou survival decreases with seismic line density due to predator use of linear features (McCutchen 2007).\n\nHabitat quality framework\n\nLarge wildfires affect woodland caribou habitat recurrently in boreal North America. The size of these wildfires is highly transformative; for example, the major fire that burned 590,000 ha around Fort McMurray in the Alberta study area in the spring of 2016 modified the habitat of two caribou herds of conservation concern (EC 2012). The inclusion of simulated wildfire in the framework altered the spatial distribution of persistent habitat quality in ways that were not captured with a static model (Kareiva and Wennergren 1995, Johnson 2007), allowing us to represent current habitat conditions moderated by the risk of future land-cover change. We believe this provides a more realistic, and more conservative, estimate of potential habitat quality. In particular, caribou habitat of moderate quality was most sensitive, either increasing or decreasing in modeled quality when fire likelihood was incorporated in the model. Simulated disturbance lowered the habitat quality scores assigned to dense coniferous (often old-growth) stands at significant risk from wildfire, but somewhat increased habitat quality where disturbance occurred in mixedwood and non-coniferous stands, as nutritional value increased with regeneration. Even with the slight reduction in IHQ scores of mature conifer forests under a simulated disturbance regime, these areas nonetheless provided the highest-quality habitat for caribou.\n\nThe modeled disturbance also highlighted the competing effects of the habitat quality components. Sites that offered the lowest predation risk often had the lowest risk of wildfire occurrence, for example, lakeside areas and peninsulas (Bergerud 1985, McLoughlin et al. 2005, Nielsen et al. 2016). The same areas, however, also had the lowest connectivity and generally provided limited nutritional resources. This led to these areas' classification as poor-quality habitat, despite the low predation risk and low potential for future disturbance. They may in fact represent where caribou could choose areas of suboptimal nutrition while minimizing risk, as a habitat strategy.\n\nThe relative importance of the different habitat quality components varied independently from the weight assigned when combining into IHQs (e.g., connectivity contributed the most to the spatial distribution of IHQ in Québec). The difference between the relative contribution of habitat quality components and their weighting suggests that the distinct spatial patterns of the landscape arrangement of habitat influence the outcomes of the IHQs, and overall habitat quality. The examination of the three components of habitat quality separately provides further information not captured in the integrated IHQs, just as the IHQs show patterns not represented in the individual components. Given the competing effects of the three habitat components and the impact of simulated disturbance on predicted habitat quality, we suggest that multi-component frameworks that integrate habitat persistence provide a more informative representation of habitat quality over space and time.\n\nImplications for caribou\n\nWe found that areas of habitat with low predation risk and high nutritional quality generally co-occur in Alberta, but were more spatially distinct in Québec. This difference is reflected in the divergent preferences of caribou for coniferous and broad-leaf forage. In Québec, we weighted deciduous and mixed stands as nutritionally preferable to spruce stands in all seasons, whereas coniferous wetlands were preferred in Alberta due to their importance as sources of arboreal lichen during winter. Regardless of nutritional quality, deciduous and early seral stands in both study regions had a higher risk of predation. In this way, nutritional quality and predation risk offset one another in Québec.\n\nRegardless of the assumptions used to generate the combined IHQs, high-quality and low-quality caribou habitat were consistently predicted in the same locations. These habitat quality classes, despite relatively high fire susceptibility, were also identified consistently under the simulated fire regime. The robust spatial occurrence of high-quality sites provides a management case for their protection and for remediation of persistent disturbed sites where human resource extraction use has ceased (Lee and Boutin 2006). High-quality habitat for caribou was available in both study areas; however, the landscape patterns that created such habitat were distinct. This may relate to the demographic trends of herds in the two study areas (EC 2012). In Québec, the best habitat was contained in large, contiguous patches, although these were relatively few in number and limited to the north of the study area, along the northern timber allocation limit in the province (Leblond et al. 2014). This result captured the requirement of caribou for large, undisturbed areas of mature forest. Such areas that remain in Québec may be essential for caribou survival, and responsible for the continuing self-sustaining nature of these herds. In contrast, populations of caribou in the Alberta study area are in decline, and the highest-quality habitat was highly fragmented.\n\nLimits and applications\n\nAs in any modeling study, predictions are contingent on data quality and model assumptions. For example, land-cover data used for this analysis represent conditions from the year 2001. Anthropogenic features integrated in the model also date from before 2017, and did not consistently match the land-cover year. For the framework to become a true operational planning tool, important landscape data should be updated. We have emphasized the importance of integrating disturbance into spatial habitat modeling, and although we have simulated wildfire as a dynamic disturbance, our framework holds climate and vegetation static and does not account for possible future changes in forestry and oil-and-gas activities. The cumulative impacts resulting from additional sources of disturbance, such as forest pests, harvesting, and industrial development (Scheller et al. 2006, Van Asselen and Verburg 2013), could further refine the prediction of habitat quality across both study areas.\n\nAlthough there is a growing literature on caribou ecology and conservation in the boreal forest of Canada, only partial information required for our parameterization was available. The transferability of our results is limited because caribou herds are known to behave distinctively in different regions (Fortin et al. 2008, Bastille-Rousseau et al. 2012). This is represented by the different weights and inputs for the two study areas. We did not use empirical observations of caribou distribution and behavior to validate the model. This work represents plausible ecological relationships, as defined in the literature, while focusing on relative changes to habitat quality as a product of wildfire, as well as the differences in methods and conditions across the two boreal landscapes. There is an opportunity to validate model predictions of habitat—at least partially—following several years of fire and under changing fire regimes, but this would represent a limited subset of an infinite number of stochastic realizations.\n\nTo adapt this framework, researchers can develop weights for other species affected (positively and negatively) by fire-induced land-cover change, and add or remove indicators of habitat quality. In addition, landscape disturbances other than wildfires could be incorporated, or substituted for wildfire by using alternative disturbance models, such as LANDIS-II (Scheller et al. 2006), to simulate harvesting or insect defoliation, the plant package in R (Falster et al. 2016), where habitat change is modeled as a function of plant competition, or CLUMondo (Van Asselen and Verburg 2013) to simulate land-cover change over time. The framework could also be used to represent habitat quality for species that require disturbances (e.g., black-backed woodpecker [Picoides arcticus]; Nappi and Drapeau 2009), or to assess the potential impacts of reintroducing landscape disturbances where the natural disturbance rate is reduced to below historical levels (e.g., when making the decision to initiate a prescribed fire program; Ryan et al. 2013).\n\nContemporary conservation planning and management is moving away from static models of species distribution and habitat (Larson et al. 2004, Franklin 2010). Dynamic spatial models of habitat quality that incorporate climate and land-cover change are ideal for capturing the effects of disturbance across spatial and temporal scales (Turner et al. 1995, Kansas et al. 2016). By incorporating a spatial representation of disturbance that can be linked directly to variations in weather, we have developed a framework that users can adapt to a range of species and spatiotemporal scales. This will allow for an assessment of a disturbance regime's relationship to habitat quality, and the potential impacts of future climate change."
