        "text": "4 Sir Winston Churchill Sq\n\nEdmonton, AB T5J 4X8\n\nLocate the Winspear on Google maps by clicking here.\n\nThe Francis Winspear Centre for Music is on the corner of 102 Avenue and 99 Street, in the heart of The Arts District in downtown Edmonton. It is readily accessible by car, Edmonton Transit (bus and LRT), and the pedway system.\n\nPlease allow yourself plenty of time to get to Winspear Centre. There is currently road and sidewalk construction taking place Downtown, including around the Winspear Centre. Look for the designated walkways put up by the City of Edmonton.\n\nPlease ensure that you leave enough time to account for road conditions, construction, and any unexpected occurrences. For more detailed information regarding current traffic disruptions, click here.\n\nJust steps away from the Winspear Centre are the Art Gallery of Alberta, the Stanley A. Milner Library, the Citadel Theatre, Edmonton City Hall, and Winston Churchill Square. Opening onto the square, the Winspear Centre is literally in the middle of it all!\n\nMap last updated July 4, 2023\n\nPlease note that the Edmonton Arts District is surrounded by active construction sites which includes the work for the Southeast LRT line. To learn more about specific traffic disruptions, please visit the City of Edmonton website.\n\nEdmonton Transit Information\n\nThe Winspear Centre is readily accessible by both bus and LRT service. The LRT terminal is Churchill Station, available from both underground and street-level. Riders can connect to the Valley Line Southeast trains using the Churchill Connector to get to the street-level Churchill stop. For more information about the Churchill LRT station, click here.\n\nClick here to be taken to the Edmonton Transit Trip Planner website from which you can find maps and other useful information about taking public transit.\n\nDROP OFF AREAS\n\nDrop off areas include the Art Gallery of Alberta (102 A Avenue) and Citadel Theatre (99 Street NW).\n\nParking at the Winspear\n\nIMPORTANT: The City Hall Parkade is closed until further notice. Please check the City's website for the most up-to-date information about this closure.\n\nThe underground parking lots closest to the Winspear Centre are the Canada Place Parkade and the Library Parkade (located underneath the Citadel Theatre). For more information about rates and hours, click here. Please note that in the Library Parkade, some exits may be under maintenance. Please check the City of Edmonton's website for updates.\n\nThere are two parkades near the Canada Place building: the Canada Place Parkade and the City Hall Parkade. As mentioned above, the City Hall Parkade (99th Street entrance) is closed until further notice. These parkades are NOT connected and need to be accessed differently â€“ the Canada Place Parkade (97 Street entrance) is still open.\n\nThe parkade entrance is located on 102 Avenue between 97 Street and 99 Street. However, due to the LRT line, you must turn north onto 99 Street (towards the Citadel Theatre) from Jasper Avenue. Drive towards the end of the Citadel Theatre, then turn right and the parkade entrance will be on the right side of the street.\n\nThe Canada Place Parkade (9700 Jasper Avenue), whose entrance is on 97 Street, is open until 1 AM. If you park in the Canada Place Parkade (9700 Jasper Avenue) in the evening, you will need to go to the main doors of Canada Place to buzz security in order to gain admittance to the parkade after your concert. The main doors are found on the East side of the building.\n\nPlease note that the Winspear Centre does not own any of the parking facilities operating in the area.\n\nAs of May 1, 2023, the City of Edmonton has changed the parking rates and hours for the EPark program. Operating hours in EPark zones will be in effect from 8 AM to 9 PM Monday through Saturday, and from 10 AM to 5 PM Sunday. To learn more about other changes to the EPark program, click here.\n\nThe City of Edmonton provides over 1500 convenient parking stalls within a five-minute walk from Winspear Centre, The Citadel Theatre and Shaw Conference Centre. The Library and Canada Place parkades provide heated underground parking with pedway connections to the event venues. Parking is also available at on-street meters in the vicinity.\n\nMetered (street) parking is no longer free on Sundays, as of May 1, 2023. Metered parking continues to be free on Statutory Holidays. Pricing at other parkades and on the street varies depending on location, time, and whether a major event is taking place at Rogers Place.\n\nClick here for the Parking Information page from the City of Edmonton website for more information and rates for parkades."
