Synopsis[]

The show centers around Brickleberry, a terrible national park with never-do-good park rangers. The series focuses on Steve Williams as he works to become the same glorious and highly-loved park ranger as his father, though he never succeeds because he will always be too stupid and fat. The series' secondary protagonist, Woody Johnson, always tries to boost attendance at the park to fill his pockets with money.

Reception[]

Brickleberry earned high recognition in the male 18-34 demographic. On the contrary, many TV critics complained that Brickleberry isn't worth watching since it was difficult to generate sympathy for the main cast due to their sloppy, offensive, grotesque or violent behaviors and therefore they gave the show mixed reviews. Despite criticism of how simplistic and effortless the artwork and drawings looked, the humor and plot and voice acting / writing components were praised. Brickleberry fans protested that the show was in many ways better than Family Guy, a higher-budgeted show much better known by U.S. households that critics claimed was similar.

By the time Season 3 came and went, Brickleberry has maintained such a large fanbase that pre-orders for the comic book's first issue were sold out.
