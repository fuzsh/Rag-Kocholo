        "text": "Oh Yeah! Cartoons was an American animation showcase that aired on the Nickelodeon cable channel. Oh Yeah! was guided by Fred Seibert, former Creative Director of MTV Networks and President of Hanna-Barbera and produced by Frederator Studios. It ran as part of Nickelodeon's Nicktoons lineup, and in its second season, was hosted by Kenan Thompson of All That and Kenan & Kel fame; then later by Josh Server for its third season. Bill Burnett composed the show's theme music. Oh Yeah! Cartoons was distributed by Nelvana outside of the United States.\n\nIn terms of sheer volume, Oh Yeah! Cartoons remains TV's biggest animation development program ever. Giving several dozen filmmakers the opportunity to create nearly 100 seven-minute cartoons, the series eventually yielded three dedicated half-hour spin-offs and two co-series made by Billionfold Inc. for Nickelodeon, including The Fairly OddParents, ChalkZone and My Life as a Teenage Robot.[1][2]\n\nIt was also hosted by Kenan Thompson at one point.[3]\n\nProduction\n\nNickelodeon's Oh Yeah! half-hour featured in its first season, a total of 39 brand new seven-minute cartoons in 13 episodes, surpassing the number of new cartoons and characters on any other single network. In its full run, Oh Yeah! Cartoons featured and produced over 99 cartoons and 54 characters.\n\nMany of the animated shorts were created by cartoonists who later became more prominent, including Bob Boyle, Thomas R. Fitzgerald, Bill Burnett, Jaime Diaz, John Eng, John Fountain, Butch Hartman, Larry Huber, Zac Moncrief, Ken Kessel, Alex Kirwan, Seth MacFarlane, Carlos Ramos, Rob Renzetti, Byron Vaughns, Pat Ventura, and Vincent Waller. Many of the animators featured on Oh Yeah! Cartoons had worked on the What A Cartoon! Show produced by Hanna-Barbera and Cartoon Network two years earlier. The show was also created by Fred Seibert while he was president of Hanna-Barbera and had the same concept as Oh Yeah! Cartoons. When Seibert left Hanna-Barbera in 1997 and founded Frederator Studios, many of the animators that had worked on What A Cartoon! migrated with him to produce shorts for Oh Yeah! Cartoons.\n\nAvailability\n\nEven though only specific WAC shorts were released on VHS tapes during the 1990s, and these shorts have not been seen on television since limited airings on Boomerang in 2007, every WAC short can be watched on various online sites (partially due to these limited Boomerang airings, and the fact that several people recorded episodes and decided to upload them to YouTube). However, there are some original forms of a very few WAC shorts that remain missing, which are detailed on the Lost Media Wiki page on The What A Cartoon! Show.\n\nOh Yeah! Cartoons has several shorts that are missing from the Internet, save for some non-informative postcards on the shorts. This series mainly aired all of its episodes after The What A Cartoon! Show ended, and this series also last aired on public television in 2007. It may be assumed that the shorts would be readily available only; however, for some strange reason, very few people seem to have recorded the series, despite it airing for several years in reruns. It is extremely rare to see an Oh Yeah! short with a Nickelodeon or Nicktoons watermark in the corner of the short online.\n\nAs of May 2021, all of the shorts have been found and can be viewed below.\n\nKnown Shorts as of 2019\n\n# Short Title Status 1 Jelly's Day: Aunt Broth's Makeover Found 2 Teddy and Art: 25 Cent Trouble Found 3 Hobart: The Weedkeeper Found 4 Protecto 5000 Found 5 Peter Patrick, Private Investigator Found 6 Tutu The Superina Found 7 A Cop & His Donut Found 8 Enchanted Adventures Found 9 Hobart & The Merman Found 10 The Man With No Nose Found 11 Youngster 3 Found 12 Microcops Found 13 Earth To Obie Found 14 Jelly's Day: Uncle Betty's Strange Rash Found 15 Lollygagin Found 16 Tales From The Goose Lady: The Tortoise & the Hairpiece Found 17 Herb Found 18 Tales from the Goose Lady: Goldie Locks Found 19 Apex Cartoon Props & Novelties Found 20 That's My Pop Found 21 Hubbykins vs. Sweetiepie Found 22 Fat Head Found 23 Tales from the Goose Lady: Little Pigs 3 Found 24 Skippy Spankerton: Hot Tamale Monster Movie Madness!
