        "text": "Just last year, the old-school animated slapstick comedy, Animaniacs was revived and given new life. This Animaniacs reboot was a long-time in coming for many fans of the show in the 1990s. In any case, the Animaniacs (2020) has inspired many fans of animated movies to start to rewatch their favorites shows in the past couple of decades.\n\nToday, in order to give these fans something to be excited over, we've compiled a list of some of the Best Animated TV shows from Disney\n\nAlright, let's kick things off with our list As mentioned, this will be a comprehensive list of some of the best Disney Animated Shows that you can watch right now We've ordered them by popularity so that you can have an easier time trying to figure out what to watch\n\nOf course, if you're more interested in actually learning about how to create your own animated shows, you may be interested in looking in a different direction For that, we recommend looking towards the premium video editor, Wondershare Filmora â which comes packed with everything that you can possibly want in order to begin exploring the realm of animation\n\nTop 10 Star vs. the Forces of Evil\n\nDuration: 2015â2019 [4 Seasons, 22m per episode]\n\nGenre: Animation, Action, Adventure\n\nRating: TV-Y7\n\nMetascore: N/A\n\nDirector: Aaron Hammersley, Dominic Bisignano, Brett Varon, Sabrina Cotugno, Piero Piluso, Tyler Chen, Giancarlo Volpe, David Wasson, Michael Mullen , John Davis Infantino, and Amelia Lorenz.\n\nStars: 7.9\n\nVotes: 13,266\n\nSummary: The first on this ascending list of ours is the TV series, 'Star vs. the Forces of Evil' This is an American animated 'magical-girl' television show that was inspired by similar tropes of the kind that were popular in the East. The show has long run its course, with the last episodes having been aired in 2019 (making it a perfect show to binge from start to finish)\n\nThe main character of the show, Star Butterfly, is a magical princess and the heir to the royal throne of the Butterfly Kingdom. From this alone, you could probably guess the kind of demographics this show has But, to explain further, once she reached the age of 14, she was given the family heirloom wand â only to accidentally set fire to the family castle and be sent over to Earth to train her magic more carefully\n\nTop 9 Gargoyles\n\nDuration: 1994â1996 [2 Seasons, 30m per episode]\n\nGenre: Animation, Action, Adventure\n\nRating: TV-Y7\n\nMetascore: N/A\n\nDirector: Dennis Woodyard, Frank Paur, Kazuo Terada, Saburo Hashimoto, Bob Kline, Takamitsu Kawamura, and Butch Lukic.\n\nStars: 8.1\n\nVotes: 15,813\n\nSummary: We go back into the older Disney animated shows a bit with this next series It ran from 1994 to 1996 for two seasons (with the third season having been called 'Gargoyles: The Goliath Chronicles' instead.) Unlike the next item on this list, this one is definitely more suitable for an older audience. The tone of the story is quite grim, despite being your general action/adventure show.\n\nIt tells the story of preternatural creatures called Gargoyles â all of whom were cursed for over a thousand years to turn to stone during the day Modern times see the release of this curse, however. And, now, these gargoyles must contend with the realities of living in modern-day (at the time the series was aired) New York City.\n\nTop 8 Mickey Mouse Clubhouse\n\nDuration: 2006â2016 [4 Seasons, 30m per episode]\n\nGenre: Animation, Adventure, Comedy\n\nRating: TV-Y\n\nMetascore: N/A\n\nDirector: Donovan Cook, Howy Parkins, Sherie Pollack, Rob LaDuca, Phil Weinstein, Broni Likomanov, and Victor Cook.\n\nStars: 5.8\n\nVotes: 3,364\n\nSummary: The Mickey Mouse Clubhouse sees the revival of the classic, Mickey Mouse character (who had been snubbed an extended spot on the big screen outside of the previews and was really only featured in the old film 'Fantasia) The show was a long-running one. Having aired between 2006 to 2016 with exactly 125 episodes around 30 minutes long.\n\nThe demographics for this one mainly comprises of very young children. But, if you like, it's a safe-for-viewing show that you can have your kids watch and keep distracted And, perhaps, along the way, you can find some joy in these classic characters coming back to life.\n\nTop 7 A Goofy Movie\n\nDuration: 1995 [78 min]\n\nGenre: Animation, Adventure, Comedy\n\nRating: G\n\nMetascore: N/A\n\nDirector: Kevin Lima\n\nStars: 6.9\n\nVotes: 51,043\n\nSummary: The Goofy Movie is not actually a TV show, but it is a part of the list of the best Disney animated shows on IMDB because it was based on an established television series called 'Goof Troop' The movie saw its premiere in 1995 and it starts off a couple of years after the end of the Goof Troop show.\n\nWhich, spoilers, sees the main characters (Goody and his son, Max) into their newest adventures Max is in high school in this film, far older than he was in the TV show. It gives the film a different sort of feel. But it's not less comedic than before And, with the extra splash of adventure, it's sure to provide a good time\n\nTop 6 Monsters at Work\n\nDuration: 2021â [1 Season, 22m per episode]\n\nGenre: Animation, Adventure, Comedy\n\nRating: TV-G\n\nMetascore: N/A\n\nDirector: Stephen J. Anderson, Kaitlyn Ritter, Kathleen Thorson Good, and Shane Zalvin.\n\nStars: 7.1\n\nVotes: 5,862\n\nSummary: When people talk of the best-animated films of all time, they usually do not forget to mention Monsters, Inc And well, this next show on our list, 'Monsters at Work', is meant to be a direct adaptation of the original work This series launched just last year (in 2021) and is currently ongoing and available for streaming on Disney+.\n\nIt kicks off on the day the main villain of the original story, Henry J. Waternoose III was arrested. Think of the show as a sequel, one that covers the inevitable transition of power with beloved characters Mike and Sulley at the helm\n\nTop 5 DuckTales\n\nDuration: 2017â2021 [3 Seasons, 21m per episode]\n\nGenre: Animation, Action, Adventure\n\nRating: TV-Y\n\nMetascore: N/A\n\nDirector: Matthew Humphreys, Tanner Johnson, Jason Zurek, John Aoshima, Dana Terrace, Tom Owens, Matt Youngberg, Vince Aparo, Jason Reicher, Stephanie Gonzaga, and Sam King.\n\nStars: 8.2\n\nVotes: 8,826\n\nSummary: Next up, we have 'Duck Tales' Duck Tales is actually a reboot, much like the Animianics (2020) reboot The original series, which had premiered all the way back in September of 1987, had run for over 100 episodes (with the last of the episodes having been aired in November of 1990). In any case, the nostalgia factor is strong with this one The series has inspired many adaptations. And, with its revival on Disney XD in 2015, its popularity has only continued to grow\n\nJust in case you're unfamiliar with this zany cast of characters. It all starts off with Donald Duck, who kicks off the show by joining the US Navy and handing off the care of his nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie to his uncle Scrooge McDuck\n\nTop 4 Phineas and Ferb\n\nDuration: (2007â2015) [4 Seasons, 15m per episode]\n\nGenre: Animation, Short, Action\n\nRating: TV-G\n\nMetascore: N/A\n\nDirector: Robert Hughes, Zac Moncrief, George Elliott, Keith Oliver, Jay Lender, Dan Povenmire, Sue Perrotto, Jeff 'Swampy' Marsh, Derek Lee Thompson, Kim Roberson, Russell Calabrese.\n\nStars: 8.0\n\nVotes: 41,251\n\nSummary: The fourth most popular of the Disney animated shows on IMBD is Phineas and Ferb This is an action/comedy series that ran all from 2007 to 2015 And yes, that does mean that this show is 100% now binge-able from start to end\n\nThis show follows the story of Phineas Flynn and his stepbrother Ferb Fletcher. The two are quite young (which perhaps is at odds with the actual demographics of the show, which make up primarily of young adults and adults), not having even reached their early teenage years just yet Each episode starts with the two brothers working on something new and exciting projects to do with construction. Often not very feasible for children of their age, but hey That doesn't make it any less fun\n\nTop 3 Amphibia\n\nDuration: 2019â [3 Seasons, 23m per episode]\n\nGenre: Animation, Short, Action\n\nRating: TV-Y7\n\nMetascore: N/A\n\nDirector: Kyler Spears, Joseph D. Johnston, Jennifer Strickland, Derek Kirk Kim, Bert Youn, Roxann Cole\n\nStars: 8.1\n\nVotes: 3,949\n\nSummary: With 'Amphibia' we introduce another Disney animated show that is not quite finished It had its premiere on the Disney Channel in June of 2020, with the latest season, the third season, having begun airing in October of 2021.\n\nThis story features a teenage heroine as its protagonist. Her name is Anne Bonnchuy. And, much like Luz from 'The Owl House' (the next show on our list) she is transported into another world that is very different from the one she knew Only, she has friends Sasha and Marcy Wu with her as her company.\n\nTop 2 The Owl House\n\nDuration: 2020- [2 Seasons, 22m per episode]\n\nGenre: Animation, Action, Adventure\n\nRating: TV-Y7-FV\n\nMetascore: N/A\n\nDirector: Aminder Dhaliwal, Stu Livingston, Sabrina Cotugno, Stephen Sandoval, Amelia Lorenz, Bosook Coburn, Bridget Underwood\n\nStars: 8.1\n\nVotes: 7,522\n\nSummary: While still quite new and yet to be finished (the series is ongoing and had its premiere in 2020 on the Disney Channel), 'The Owl House' is another Disney animated show that you may be interested in This story was created by Dana Terrace, and was quite well-regarded for having unabashedly LGBTQ+ character representation (it was even the first Disney property to feature a same-sex couple as main characters)\n\nThe story's main protagonist is Luz Noceda. She's a teenage girl that somehow ended up traveling into another world. There she meets \"The Owl Lady\" Elda Clawthorne and her housemate King as a human without any powers of her own, the world is quite unusual for Luz, but that doesn't stop her from trudging forward in an attempt to become a witch by apprenticing at the Owl House.\n\nTop 1 Gravity Falls\n\nDuration: 2012â2016 [2 Seasons, 23m per episode]\n\nGenre: Animation, Action, Adventure\n\nRating: TV-Y7\n\nMetascore: Joe Pitt, John Aoshima, Matt Braly, Aaron Springer, Stephen Sandoval, Sunil Hall, Rob Renzetti.\n\nStars: 8.9\n\nVotes: 90,593\n\nSummary: The first of the Disney Animated Shows on our list is 'Gravity Falls' This is highly rated by viewers on IMDB â having scored a total of 8.9 stars and over 90,000 votes The film was created by Alex Hirsch and it's available for streaming on both Disney Channel and Disney XD. The series has since finished, so you can binge it from start to finish with your children now if you like\n\nThe story follows the adventure of Dipper Pines and his sister Mabel as they explore the supernaturally-active town that is Gravity Falls, Oregon It was popular with young children, teenagers, and young adults alike, having run from 2012-2016 with the main genres being mystery and comedy"
