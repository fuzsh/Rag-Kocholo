        "text": "Everyone almost universally agrees that Family Guy sucks now. But there was a change of tone in 2008. The show became more random, juvenile, having illogical plots (Brian having a human son, Brian dating Lauren Conrad, Brian being an atheist, Quagmire hating Brian, and having sexual demons because of the girl that got away, Cheryl Tiegs, more jokes about Brian being a failed writer, Stewie taking steroids and a subplot with Connie that ignored Let's Go To The Hop, and mostly acting like the first three seasons didn't happen), preachy, mean spirited, crude for it's own sake, padded out jokes, Brian started to become the main character, the colors got flashy and brighter, became more directed at teens than adults, and the show started to take itself too seriously with episodes like And Then There Were Fewer and Road to the North Pole. Some of these flaws started to creep in early on in the show's uncancellation, but when I watch them again, I couldn't help but notice that despite some mild changes, that the show still had it's identity there and still had some of it's charm. Even though the show got a little more meaner and raunchier than before cancellation, there was still some heart, it was a little more reserved in how edgy it was and you could actually like the characters, even Peter. Meet the Quagmires and Barely Legal being good examples. When I was watching the first five and a half seasons, I noticed that most of the episodes I liked were directed by Dan Povenmire. They had some of the most clever punchlines, setups, gags and jokes, and actually had moments that made you feel for the characters, which is rare now. Most of the episodes that people love are notably directed by Povenmire, and most of the lines people quoted from the show were episodes that he directed. When he left to make Phineas and Ferb, the show became darker, and more anarchist and the characters became jokes with nothing about them you could connect to. The heart was gone and it felt like it was aiming exclusively towards the Disney Channel crowd just with dark humor. Now, I know Seth MacFarlane is the creator of the show and I am not trying to take away anything from him, but I'm starting to think that Dan Povenmire might have been a huge participant in why Family Guy was so good in it's early seasons. Most of the more memorable jokes are his style of humor and the shows that he left to work on have the heart and wit that his episodes of Family Guy had, and Family Guy went in a different direction after his departure. It may be that Povenmire and some of the crew that left for Phineas and Ferb was pulling Seth back from the show he wanted to make, and when Povenmire left, Seth was left to his own devices and the later seasons was more in tune with what he wanted Family Guy to be. He even said in a DVD commentary that he prefers the later seasons to the old."
