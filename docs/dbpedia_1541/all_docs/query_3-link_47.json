In the film, Timmy Turner's godparents end up exposed to the public and must bring them back by finding an exiled fairy.\n\nThe Fairly Odd Movie premiered in Los Angeles on October 29, 2029, and was released in the United States on November 2, grossing $109 million worldwide. It received positive reviews from critics for its voice performances, animation, humor, and the franchise's return to its roots.\n\nPlot\n\nTimmy Turner reminisces on the day he was granted his fairy godparents, Cosmo and Wanda Cosma, and wants to celebrate that day by taking them out to the Dimmsdale Dimmadome with his parents while he disguises and passes them off as acquaintances called \"Carmen\" and \"Wendy\". During their time there, the godparents hit it off with Timmy's parents up until Cosmo inadvertently exposes himself and Wanda floating in glee after a touchdown; their presence is seen by the spectators and caught on camera, broadcasting their existence throughout the world.\n\nTimmy is brought against Fairy Court for the exposure of his godparents and for his reckless decision of bringing them out in the public. After Timmy's tell them about his choice on celebrating his granting of his godparents, Judge Fairy sympathizes with his appreciation towards them until high-ranking official, Jorgen Von Strangle, chimes in on mentioning Timmy's reckless wishes that had caused trouble in the past, thus having the judge reluctantly strip Timmy from his godparents. Timmy spends the rest of his days fighting his own fights with his babysitter, Vicky, and his bully, Francis; spending long-awaited time with his parents; bonding more with his close friends, Chester and A. J.; and earning and winning the love of his crush, Trixie Tang.\n\nWhile happy with his newly-adjusted lifestyle after three whole months, he still misses Cosmo and Wanda. Taking a walk around Dimmsdale, he comes across a belittled boy named Kareem Juganhimer, who has an adult-like voice, who he defends from a pack of teenage bullies. Overhearing them mention Timmy as the \"Fairy Godkid\", Kareem relates with him as he also lost his godparent, Percy VanWonder, long ago; he fled from Fairy World, with a stolen wand, and went into self-exile before giving Kareem his location to his favorite place: Aspen, Colorado. Timmy gets the epiphany of getting Percy's help by wishing for his godparents back and promises to reunite Kareem with him. Timmy's teacher and fairy hunter, Denzel Crocker, had overheard Timmy's objective and plans to head there before they do.\n\nTimmy informs his parents and friends about his goal to get back his godparents, which they feel skeptical about but are willing to help him after catching on with his depression. A. J. upgrades the Turners' cars for the trip while Chester packs snacks and Trixie brings along winter clothes when they reach Aspen before they hit the road. Meanwhile, Crocker follows them inconspicuously. On the road, Timmy tells him about Cosmo and Wanda, with the others amazed and dumbfounded. Trixie, after spending three months getting to know Timmy, gives him the choice of living his life with or without his godparents whilst she, his friends, and family will respect his decision. During the trip, Crocker sabotages their journey, with little results, from setting up road blocks and siphoning their gas, only to discover that the Turners' car was upgraded to fly, which he successfully stops by firing the engine; the group resumes their journey on foot.\n\nArriving in Aspen, they check in at a hotel to rest, as Timmy thinks over Trixie's advice and finds himself at a crossroads. The next morning, they wake up and resuming heading to Percy, with them splitting up to search for him after Timmy left the map at the hotel. Chester finds an advertisement to \"Percy the Wonderful\", who turns out to be Percy disguised as a human, performing at Theatre Aspen. After his show, Kareem reunites with Percy and introduces Timmy and company and needs his help. Taking him to his cabin in the White River National Forest, Timmy fills him in on the event of losing his godparents and his choice to wish for going back to prevent it or living his life without them, which Percy declines after his last wish to Kareem: giving him immortality. Telling the whole story of losing Percy, Kareem wished for immortality in 1983 as a birthday present, which had resulted in not only losing Percy, but also losing his family and friends from old age. Percy agrees to wish Timmy back if he helps him rectify his mistake.\n\nBefore he could grant Timmy's wish, Crocker arrives at Percy's cabin with the map he found at the hotel and is armed with a net cannon used to subdue Timmy's family and friends. Timmy and Percy make a run for it until Crocker captures Timmy and confronts Percy to wish for his godparents back, but is rejected as Da Rules state a fully-grown adult cannot wish for wishes, resulting in Crocker threatening a still captured Timmy to wish him young. With Timmy acquiescing, he wishes for Crocker to be young, which results in him turned into a baby.\n\nWith Crocker defeated, Timmy and Percy return to see the others freed by Jorgen, who had gotten a tip-off and plans to erase Timmy's memory before being trapped by Timmy's parents who defend him after helping him bend over backwards to get his godparents back and are backed up by his friends. Jorgen reluctantly lets Timmy make his wish as long as he makes time for his friends and winning Trixie and finding common ground with his parents; Timmy agrees before saying goodbye to his friends and family. After being wished back to the moment where he loses Cosmo and Wanda at the Dimmadome, he saves them by saying \"Carmen\" is a magician after Cosmo floats in the air, with his parents, as well as everyone else, believing in it.\n\nDuring the credits, Timmy goes back to 1983 via wish to prevent Kareem's birthday wish, which works and he keeps Percy as his godparent; he wins over Trixie's affections; he introduces his later friend Chloe Carmichael to Chester, A. J., and Trixie; and deals with Vicky by exposing her via hidden cameras, resulting in her being fired and Kareem becoming his new sitter. In a mid-credits scene, Timmy and his friends, along with his girlfriend Trixie, are watching a movie together while his godparents and Poof are happy for him.\n\nVoice cast\n\nTara Strong as Timmy Turner: An elementary school student who is the godchild of Cosmo and Wanda.\n\nDaran Norris as Cosmo Cosma: Timmy's childish but well-meaning godfather.\n\nNorris also voices Timmy's father.\n\nNorris also voices Jorgen Von Strangle: A high-ranking Fairy official of Fairy World, the strongest fairy in the universe and commander in chief of all fairies.\n\nSusan Blakeslee as Wanda Fairywinkle-Cosma: Timmy's voice-of-reason godmother.\n\nBlakeslee also voices Timmy's mother.\n\nMae Whitman as Trixie Tang: Timmy's longtime crush and most the popular girl in school.
