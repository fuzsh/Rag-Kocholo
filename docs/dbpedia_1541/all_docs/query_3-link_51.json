This is #137 (3-15a) and #147 on the animation paper as Phineas & Ferb create a tower while Doctor Doofensmirtz tries to make his brother Roger pull off an international incident in England. Wait; didn't the Americans already do that by winning the revolution? Then we come to one of those episodes as Phineas & Ferb create Cheesetopia while Doofensmirtz makes Perry into a butler zombie and somehow Karl gets trapped in the middle wearing a squirrel suit. That's not the whacky part; the whacky part is that the story begins at the end and works it's way to the beginning. WHAT'S UP WITH THAT~?! Let's rant on shall we...?!\n\nEscape From Phineas Tower is written and storyboarded by Tom Minton, Bernie Petterson, Michael Diederich . Remains of The Platypus is written and storyboarded by John Mathot and Zac Moncrief with the story Clint Daniels and Jill Daniels. Jill started with King Of The Hill in 1997; then it's Hey Arnold!, Tom Sawyer, and Doctor Lollipop which is her most recent credit. The Proud Family is her DTVA debut, and then did American Dragon: Jake Long. That's it. Clint has only one credit: this show. Yeah. John started with Edith Ann: Homeless Go Home in 1994 and then from there: Hey Arnold!, Duckman, Stressed Eric, The Wild Thornberrys, Dilbert, God, The Devil & Bob, Mission Hill, The Oblongs, Game Over, Family Guy, Futurama, Good Vibes, The Simpsons and Creature Crunch. Phineas & Ferb is his DTVA debut and only appearance. He does various roles as an actor on 30-Second Bunny Theatre and some directing with The 'Wood and Bagboy! That's about it. Story editing for both episode are done by Scott Peterson. Animation is done by Synergy Animation.\n\nEscape From Phineas' Tower: We begin this one outside the Flynn-Fletcher Antiques shop which is indeed an old English style Antique shop. We walk into the shop which is littered with paintings on the walls and a clock; none of this is interesting. Phineas & Ferb obverse a large chamber like box made of bronze which Lawerence explains is a prop for some vaudeville show. I'm guessing that the show is either the Simpsons of Family Guy; but why would those two shows drop this when they are so over. I guess someone wanted to really get rid of it and Lawerence was the sucker to get rid of it so to speak. This leads to a really dumb logic break: Lawerence opens the door explaining that it's used by people to pretend that they are locked inside and then they get out to the amazement of the crowd. So he goes in and the door locks shut inside; Lawerence struggles to get out; Phineas asks if he needs help; Lawerence no sells and then the door opens as Ferb is inside the chamber despite the fact that we never see him inside with Lawerence. DUMB! And this was clearly an intentional logic break because Phineas looks over to where Ferb should have been standing. Lawerence walks away stage left because he has bottlecaps to polish; and Phineas proclaims that he knows what he wants to do today. So we cut to the kitchen as Linda is writing a note on the counter with a blue pen; because she's late for a very important date with her new introduction of her ice sculpture. Then we cut to the backyard as Linda places the note on a sleeping Candace's nose who is snoring on a metal device which creates a hammock; like Baloo does in TaleSpin in a half dozen episodes or so. We get a lullaby version of a song called Quirky Worky Song from Toy To The World; as the note reads \"Back Soon, Love Mom\" in blue letters. We see Phineas & Ferb with hardhats (and in Phineas' case; a pencil and clipboard) in the background walking in with boxes, trucks, forklifts, deliverymen and of course; my favorite prop in this show: The giant floating baby head. YES! Please cuddle up to Candace this time; that's all I ask.\n\nSo Candace asks where Perry is and we head inside Phineas' bedroom as Perry puts a red ring through a box and then dives into the box in which the red ring flops around the box and the box disappears like magic. We head to OWCA headquarter as Perry appears from the glass elevator and runs in to sit in his chair in front of the computer. Major Monogram is on screen...oh boy, this is funny: Monogram has a clipboard and Karl is sitting at a table with a white cloth on as they are channeling My Fair Baloo; the first half of the episode where they went for the manners angle and it was aborted later on because it sucked. This one is much funnier because it's a one off joke. Karl I believe gets it right on the salad fork thing as Monogram cuts the joke short to address Agent P. See; today is International Good Manners Day which apparently is the counter for April Fools Day on April 2. Okay; I made up the counter for my amusement. Anyhow; Perry must stop Doofensmirtz and his device which will cause rampart rudeness if it's not stopped. So it was Doofensmirtz who has made every show on Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network so mean spirited then!! Boy; those execs sure were framed this time by the old farts; huh?! Ironically Monogram acts rude during this and then sezs please as Agent P salutes him and bails. Karl proclaims that he thinks it is called the Rude-inator which Monogram blows off by accusing Karl of being Nostradamus. Speaking of rude people...Okay; Phineas & Ferb are not rude; but Phineas is wearing carnival barker gear (geez; that triangle head makes him wearing hats look funny) and has a cane as he addresses Isabella, Baljeet and Buford as we see a really angler glass tower building with a digital clock above the door. Phineas proclaims that he plans to perform the ultimate in escapement from a tower that was so amazing that it's plans had to be seen from a smoked mirror in order to prevent them from going insane. What in the blue hell is a smoked mirror? I think Isabella is asking the same question as I am while pointing out Phineas' hard sell of this project.\n\nSo Baljeet points out that if they built it; then they would know how to get out amirite? Well; Phineas has built the device to learn as it goes and thus it is possible that they could be trapped forever; which is enough for Isabella to screw up saying no; while Baljeet backs away from this and Buford calls this ill-advised. Phineas is cool with that because they can be the cheering section with Candace who sleep talks in the hammock about busting her brothers again. And you thought Kit Cloudkicker had a one track mind when it came to flying?! Anyhow; Phineas sets the timer to 15 minutes as he informs them that if they fail to get out in that time; they can smash the invention and rescue them outright. Oh; if that doesn't give away the ending to this in advance. Buford has the SLEDGEHAMMER OF PLOT with him as he sets his watch to 15 minutes with Isabella looking concerned as usual. So Phineas & Ferb go into the pully elevator as he tells the faint hearted to leave the scene now and pushes the green button as the elevator rises into the sky as Phineas bids farewell in English and German. The elevator is planted into the top of the building as Phineas claims that he'll see them in a few minutes; or not at all. The elevator rises up from the ceiling and the door close; shackling the trapdoor on top. We cut to a shot of the other kids as Baljeet asks what is their liability here; as the clock has already counted down at least thirty seconds. So we head to Doofensmirtz's Evil Inc. (With jingle this time. YAY!) as Perry jumps from the ceiling into the lab. There is a towel on the floor with the sign \"Wipe Feet\" behind the towel. If you cannot guess what happens next; you have no business reading this rant. Perry wipes his feet (it's good manners day; what else can Perry do without looking like a heel?); and the trapdoor opens dragging Perry down into the floor; then comes back up as Perry is in a cat constume. And when I say that; it's a real cat skin costume with leash that Doofensmirtz puts on. I got to admit; I did laugh at that spot. Doofensmirtz admits that the \"cat got your tongue\" promo wasn't working; but whatever.\n\nSo we discover that Doofensmirtz is jealous of his brother being Teddy Ruxpin as seen in the flashback as we see a really fat old woman wearing a blue dress with a big mole on her nose. We discover that she is Aunt Effie and kiddie Roger is so kind that he gets a quarter from his aunt. Kiddie Doofensmirtz then invokes the pointy finger of doom and points out the mole with glee. We return to reality (no, not really) as apparently he was punished by his aunt to clean out the chicken coop with a spoon. He didn't believe that he was rude and that he was showing restraint. Memo to Doofensmirtz: Writers tend to write the moral of \"show empathy at all times; even if the character doesn't deserve it\" all the time. I hate it when someone gets punished for pointing out the facts; because it makes the person on the other end look like a fragile hearted person. Aunt Effie I think is voiced by Jane Carr; as Doofen explains that he is getting his revenge on Roger for being Teddy Ruxpin because a diplomat is visiting the tri-state area (who is female too; a double lucky whammy for Doofensmirtz since Roger can be sexist and rude at the same time) who is from England; the king of the manners. Riiiiiiggggghhhhhtttttt. That's like saying that they invented tea first which disregards thousands of years of evidence from China. Anyhow; Doof is going to zap Roger with the Rude-inator (another laser device weapon as the Lightning Gun device is way overplayed in this show alone). I was hoping this would happen but it doesn't: If you listen closely; you can hear Karl laughing all the way to the bank. If there was a time for a Billy Van joke; this was it. Basically; Roger would cause an international incident and he takes over as mayor of the Tri-State area. Oh; and Perry is stuck in the cat suit because in Doofen's own mind, Perry would attract too much attention because he's a platypus with a fedora hat. Ummm; Doofen? His head is showing so your plan needs more thinking. I get that this is continuity from Perry The Actorpus; but at least stuff a mask on Perry's head if you want to make Doofen look less of an idiot. I'm just saying.\n\nSo we head inside the Angler Building of Death (that's my booking name and I'm sticking to it!) which is basically an empty brown building with high walls and a trapdoor opened. You know; I'm going to get this out of the way because I have no idea who voices who (and sadly; the Phineas Wikia has no information either on that). So additional voices were provided by April Stewart, Beth Littleford, Todd Stashwick. April has done mostly video game voices; starting with Die Hard: Nakatomi Plaza in 2002. Sadly; her animation career began with American Dad in 2005 with Stan Of Arabia as Salima/Bahir. Phineas & Ferb is her DTVA debut and then she did Marci McFist in Randy Cummingham: Grade 9 Ninja. Dungeon Keeper Mobile as mistress is her most recent credit. She has 62 acting credits and one Self credit. Beth according to Wikipedia (DANGER! DANGER!): Littleford guest-starred on numerous television programs during the late 1990s and 2000s such as Spin City (where she had a multi-year occasional role), The West Wing, Family Guy, and Frasier. Littleford was also a celebrity commentator on VH1's I Love the 80s Strikes Back in 2003, I Love the 90s in 2004, I Love the 90s: Part Deux in 2005, I Love the New Millennium and The Great Debate in 2009. She was the female lead on the short-lived Fox series Method and Red, and also starred as Ben Tennyson's mother Sandra in Ben 10: Race Against Time, and reprised the role in the Ben 10: Alien Force episode 20 and again in Ben 10: Ultimate Alien. More recently, Littleford appeared in TV commercials for Laughing Cow cheese and a hotel chain. She starred in the Disney XD original show I'm in the Band, the 2010 Disney channel movie Starstruck, and played Suzanne Berger on MTV's The Hard Times of RJ Berger and Dana on ABC's Desperate Housewives. She also plays the Cascade Kitchen Counselor on the TV commercials (2012). She currently has a starring role in the Disney Channel original series Dog with a Blog.\n\nShe began her career with A Cool, Dry Place as Suzanne as 1998. Kim Possible is her DTVA debut. Dog With A Blog as Ellen Jennings is her most recent credit. She has 55 credits and 30 Self credits to her resume. Todd according to IMDB: Stashwick was born in Chicago and raised in the suburbs right outside of the city. As a child, he always loved making people laugh, and he aspired to one day perform at Chicago's famous The Second City. Soon after graduating from Illinois State University with a degree in Theatre, he began performing at several local improvisational theaters, and his dream came true when he was hired in 1992 to tour nationally with The Second City. Following productions at The Second City Detroit and The Second City Northwest, he moved to New York. There, he formed a company of improvisers and began staging the underground critically acclaimed \"Burn Manhattan\" all over the city. Other performers included Kate Walsh, Jeremy Piven and Spencer Kayden. Aside from his work in improvisational theatre, Stashwick worked for several years in late 1997 through Spring 2000 on \"Late Night With Conan O'Brien,\" performing as part of their rotating stable of comedy actors. Work in television and film ultimately drew him to Los Angeles where he soon landed roles in pilots and series and film. Stashwick remains true to his improvisational roots, and he produces, performs and teaches at his own improvisational theatre that he co-founded in North Hollywood called \"The Hothouse\". In addition he performs annually with the Macabre improv cabaret The Doubtful Guests who just celebrated their ten year anniversary. He has also taught and performed his unique style of avant-garde improvisation internationally. He directed a show in Liverpool called \"Hoof!,\" which still tours throughout Europe. He is also the writer and co-creator of the online action/horror web comic Devil Inside.\n\nHe publishes a new free episode weekly on his website www.toddstashwick.com. The comic has brought him to comic book conventions across the country with his collaborator, comic book artist Dennis Calero. Stashwick resides in Los Angeles with his wife Charity, whom he married in 1997 in the middle of Times Square in front of twenty close family members and friends, as well as all of New York City. The couple has two children. Their household also includes two dogs, two cats and a Conure (small parrot). In his spare time, Stashwick enjoys surfing, noodling on the ukulele, writing screenplays and pilots. He's an avid TV (his current favorites are Breaking Bad, Walking Dead and Doctor Who) and a huge Film buff (Star Wars, There Will be Blood and Hedwig and the Angry Inch are among his favorites) . A shameless geek he can be found playing video games with his son or with his nose buried in a comic book. He's been a vegetarian since 1988. He loves traveling overseas as often as his hectic schedule permits. A self-professed Anglophile, Stashwick loves English comedy, music and television. Todd began his career on Remember WENN as Link in 1997. Phineas & Ferb is his DTVA debut and only appearance. Uncharted 4, Mocking Bird (Tom) and Jane Got A Gun (O'Dowd) are his most recent credits. He has 104 acting credits; one director credit (Stalker Chronicles), one producer credit (Secret Of The Black) and two Self credits (TMI Hollywood and R3). So Phineas talks to \"The Tower\" as he is ready for it throw whatever it has got. So the tower's automated voice responds (Jeff Marsh by the way) by greeting the boys claiming that he's going to have fun with them. So the arms come out and put straightjackets on the boys. I thought BS&P barred them from using it for PC reasons. Well; it doesn't matter because Ferb grabs Phineas's legs by the teeth and shakes Phineas out of the straightjacket with ease. Phineas calls this classic as he unwraps Ferb with ease.\n\nPhineas calls this fun; so the arms come out and put them in chains and shackles. Then they go up one floor (wait; I thought they were on the top floor? Shouldn't the scene shifter go up instead of down?) to a dungeon scene. Phineas claims that they should \"file\" this under Dungeon Escape as he produces a rasp (Gadget trick strikes again!) and files the chains with ease. Phineas & Ferb are released and find a vent in the dungeon. Phineas removes the steel vent and they both crawl inside. So we head to city hall which is a stereotypical White House like building like every show I have seen in DTVA (except for TaleSpin; believe it or not). Apparently in this world; there are 12 states in the union as we go into the press core room as everyone is seated except for four seats. Doofensmirtz walks in dragging Perry in that catsuit and sadly; Doofensmirtz forgot to buy a cat mask because Perry's head is still exposed with his fedora hat on. Doofensmirtz mocks Perry calling him a cataypus which is funny, but Doofen is still pretty stupid. Doofensmirtz sits down in the front row of empty seats as we see Roger on the podium addressing the crowd because it's National Etiquette Week. Wait; I thought it was International Good Manners Day? Damn; they have wounded the continuity that they have been shooting for in this episode. Everyone claps except Doofensmirtz as a woman's voice claims that she loves good etiquette. Sadly for her; this website is the wrong place to go for such things. So we head back to the tower of doom as there is a room filled with wall safes embedded in the walls with keyholes. There is a gray floor with eight WCW KEYS OF DOOM. Which one will give Phineas a title shot at the next TNA PPV with Magnus? TUNE INTO NITRO TO FIND OUT~! No, not really. Ferb grabs the keys as the camera pans up to a trapdoor at the ceiling; and Ferb sticks the keys into the wall safes like a bunch of rungs and they climb up and pop through the ceiling. Boy; those keys have to be made of solid steel for those boys to climb it; since they look like skeleton keys.\n\nThe man claims that this is a nice warmup as they climb some rungs on the wall like a ladder in some abyss and then gravity takes over and they flip the camera upside down and both boys freefall. Phineas proclaims that this is the bottomless pit; and instead of panicking, they slap skin with glee. Yeah; these boys are almost as nutty as Kit Cloudkicker. Almost. So we cut back to outside in front of the digital clock as almost five minutes has elapsed. Baljeet is too busy making a house of cards on Candace's belly. HAHA! Isabella comes in spraying whip cream on her forehead for no reason that I can think of as Baljeet is concerned about them getting out as well as Isabella. Buford claims that he's counting on it as he is using a grinding wheel to grind his sledgehammer. Yeah; Buford has a hammer to grind. What metaphor can you use in that situation? I'm serious; I would like to know. So we have Roger back in the spotlight continuing his speech as he has someone to further speak on the topic of good manners and boring the crap out of me. Okay; I made up the boring part. So he introduces the diplomat from England who arrives on stage as she is brown haired tall slender female with a mole on her nose wearing a brown dress, leggings and a hairstyle that screams Rebecca Cunningham. It just occured to me that the Ambassodor from England is from the same type of family as Aunt Effie because she has a big mole on her nose like Aunt Effie. So Doofensmirtz gets his remote control and pushes the button which turns on the Rude-inator which fires it's beam. Now; suddenly, Roger completely loses it and just blows off the diplomat for nagging on him for hours before this event began. Doofensmirtz is in shock because Roger has not been zapped with the beam. WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED HERE?! The audience boos this out of the building and a woman demands a recall right now.; which the crowd chants in unison. For being rude? Normally when you are this rude; you get re-elected and a raise. I think the crowd should rethink this recall stuff as Doofensmirtz crackles with glee. Besides; England sucks anyway; so what average American is going to defend her anyway?\n\nAlthough he isn't as happy as he would like because during all this; Perry easily escaped the catsuit and bailed, which Doofensmirtz mistakes as Perry going to the bathroom after he had time to go before he was captured. He hopes that Perry gets him popcorn on the way back. Cut back to freefalling in the bottomless pit as Phineas has a plan as he wants to hold hands with Ferb. Ferb sells it and they use their feet on the wall as brakes and make it to a small door. Phineas proclaims that the tower will have to do better than that as they open the door and they crawl through the brown pipe. Suddenly; the tower gets all offended by this proclaiming that he doesn't give a flying buttress. Finally; a spot where Fanboy & Chum Chum did a better job in wit; which means this tower is being really rude for no reason at all. Oh come on tower; man up! The tower continues blowing off the boys as so special. Ummm; they are since they have the big contract and are the leads of this show (Kit: Not anymore! The show might be ending this season after the Star Wars/Phineas movie stuff runs it's course.), you are truly jealous Tower! So Phineas & Ferb pop from a fake trapdoor made from a log as Phineas wonders why the tower is so rude since he was programmed to not be this rude. So then they are grabbed and tied up to logs as we basically do the spot Monty got from Many Love Is A Splintered Thing in Rescue Rangers. Only the male got it instead of the female who always gets these stupid spots in the past. Ferb is tied onto his belly as Phineas wants suggestions because the buzzsaw is about to cut them into half see. Ferb takes off his socks and shoes with his feet and uses his feet to untie himself and then Phineas; which Phineas blows him off for showing off so to speak. I should note that the spot was screwed up as his toes never made contact with the ropes once; and it was as choppy as a cheap cartoon. So they bail as Phineas thinks something is wrong with the tower. Geez; you THINK?!\n\nThey get their shoes and socks back on in between jump cuts as we play Indiana Jones for a while; while singing Breaking Out. Wall darts, wall safe cracking with iron spikes, smallest mine shaft in history, using a bone to get unshackled from the wall chains in the dungeon, then it's Duddley Doo-Right level trap (tied to the train tracks) which they easily hop away stage left from the train, maze of giant red balls, tossing a ball on the wall in prison, running from prison with that damn stock character dog that is in almost every DTVA cartoon that I have ever seen. Then we play the lake of fire version of Sinkers & Floaters; then they run to an ocean of sharks which they pass by walking on silts. A prison room as we play the crushing walls spot; as Phineas & Ferb counter with a giant lead pipe sandwich. So the song finally ends as we cut to the digital clock outside and there is less than 25 seconds left on the time limit. So we see Baljeet putting a dish of water on Candace's drooping left hand while Isabella is placing a wooden spoon in between Candace's toes; which contain a slice of Swiss Cheese (and the color stylists actually get it right this time), a corkscrew, a pencil, a white feather, and a small American flag. And yes; even in this world; everyone has four fingers and four toes despite being human. And it just occured to me that Doofensmirtz actually missed his target and it hit the Tower despite the fact that we never saw the tower get hit with it. Bad, bad plotting there guys. Buford draws a black colored eyeball on the note asking how they didn't do this before. Then we zoom out and we see someone digging up from the ground and it's Phineas & Ferb coming up and climbing out of the pit they dug. The kids all come over and cheer for Phineas & Ferb succeeding with 17 seconds to spare too. However; the Tower is such a sore loser that it creates a glass dome around half of the backyard; trapping Phineas & Ferb, but not the kids. Yeap; they are going for the Buford smashing finish; which is pointless because Phineas & Ferb did successfully escape from the tower. This Tower is so into sportsmanship that he's like the Orange Goblin himself.\n\nSo here's what happens next: Perry is casually running back (I'm guessing that he took a taxi; or hitchhiked on one. The later makes more sense than the former.) to DEI; and he goes up to the look off. He runs to the Rude-Inator and puts a cork into the mouth of the gun. Then he steps off the look off and freefalls; opening his handglider in mid-air. So we head back to the press core hall as Roger continues to blow off what may or may not be Aunt Effie's daughter as the chants of recall continue. Doofensmirtz loves this; but if you recall, the Rudeinator did not hit Roger at all; it hit the tower (which we never saw). Despite speaking dozens of sentences blowing her off; Roger has only one thing to say to her and he points to the mole on her nose and is about to repeat Kiddie Doofensmirtz's promo which Doofensmirtz is so happy to see them do because Roger is so rude; that Roger then stops selling and hugs the diplomat as I discover that her name is Mayor. Yes; Mayor. Doofensmirtz is shocked and appalled as Roger and Mayor point out that they were putting on a show. Like Joker Sting actually. Yeap; Mayor and Roger agreed to do this for their editification and thus it was all a work. Geez; that sounded like a shoot to me; considering that no one in American would give a flying fig about her anyway. Doofensmirtz is pissed and the crowd claps at the exact same time (Ah; the pitfalls of Toon Boom) and way. Doofensmirtz pushes on the remote control as we cut to the Rude-inator being destroyed like a gun on Looney Tunes (cork in the gun blows up the gun itself). Doofensmirtz curses Perry for beating him and denying him his popcorn as the crowd chants four more years at Roger after he asks what he would be without manners; thus proving that he would have won without them anyway. Doofensmirtz then asks who got hit by the Rude-inator as we head back to the tower as the tower mocks the boys as losers who are trapped in a glass dome.\n\nAnd then we come to the finish as the Tower puts in his vacuum circuits and thus Phineas & Ferb no longer have air and won't enjoy their pensions anymore. Buford runs in to whack the dome with the mallet; but it is a toy mallet and no damage is done, so Buford channels Escarmargot and gives up. Okay; here is what happens next: Phineas admits that he has excitement and mortal terror mixed in as the kids are leaving; but the Tower gets all pissy and extends the tower to trap Buford, Baljeet and Isabella. Baljeet tells Phineas to call some other friends next time he create a fiendishly clever machine thingy. Then Phineas suddenly has a Krackpotkin Plan as he tells the computer that since he's programmed to trap his friends as well as him; he tells Tower that he has friends in Danville. So the tower creates a dome around Danville; which Phineas then ups the ante by claiming that he has friends in the tri-state area. This leads to stock stills of Planet Earth from a different angle as the tower puts a dome over a bunch of clouds covering the tri-state area. I guess the writers don't want Middle America to know that this show is a rib on them. Phineas then proclaims that he has friends all over the world; so the tower is creating a barrier all over the earth now. Then Phineas shows a picture of a purple alien like cat and this is the first visual evidence of the infamous creature known as Meaps (also the catchphrase of Candace when she is stunned to say anything but cannot stutter for BS&P reasons); so they have friends in another galaxy. This one makes the tower so cocky that he removes the dome from the earth; rises into the galaxy sky and he puts a sphere all around the Milky Way Galaxy and that is enough for Phineas and Ferb to simply walk away happy. Ferb gets his contracted line in by the way as you just saw a demonstration of a gag Take Two does a lot: Phineas dares someone to do stuff. They do it successfully. Phineas ups the ante. They do it successfully. Rinse, Lather, Repeat until that someone fails to do it successfully. At this point; I would have been more than happy to call this an episode; but then we head into space with paper airplane like space ships as a bunch of green aliens are manning said ships towards the Milky Way Galaxy and the alien captain orders the assault in three seconds and the airplane space ships get stuck like darts on the barrier of the tower and someone calls for a hammer and that ends the episode at 10:15. I should note that the Phineas Wikia has shots of a deleted scene where the digital clock of the tower when the tower left crashes right next to Candace's left arm containing the container of water and the water completely washed away all the objects on Candace; leaving just a porn mustache on Candace's face. Candace is still snoozing the whole time and doesn't suspect a thing. Yeap; that made no sense. This was your average fun episode which looked too big for 11 minutes; and the pacing was off in places. I see Phineas is warming up for his talk show which we'll soon tackle before The Animal Files. *** 1/4 (65%).\n\nOh boy; here we go....\n\nInteresting Moment #1: The title for the episode in white letters on the first shot is reversed. So is this the \"Copyright Protest\" episode of something? On the next shot during the jingle; it's right back to normal; so they are giving a hint of the chaos and mess that we are about to see.\n\nRemains Of The Platypus: We begin this one with the weirdest sky shot ever: Thunderstorms and purple whirlpool like clouds are in the skies; as we have a shot of a white pale version of Doofensmirtz Evil Inc. as there is another laser device on the lookoff and the colors are so rad and dark that Doofensmirtz is literally in his white underwear. Not boxer shorts; but real white underwear. I thought he would be wearing black underwear; since he is a heel. And even this spot gets the jingle which is funny. There are green sparks and lightning in a glass container with an anntena inside connected to the device. Doofensmirtz is wearing socks and shoes still as he proclaims that he has finally won and will rule the Tri-State area. And since he comes from eastern Europe; we can clearly see his underarm hair. So we pan over to a hamster wheel as Agent P is dressed like a cross between a butler and James Bond as he is running on the hamster wheel. Judging by Doof's promo; he was made into a butler somehow. Geez; I wonder how he did that. Then we see the OWCA wristwatch on the table on a closeup as Major Monogram is in a pink Hawaiian shirt and appears to be swollen by about 50 pounds; half of it going to his face alone. Karl grabs the wristwatch as he is in a cage wearing a squirrel fursuit. I am NOT making this up as Monogram is chanting that he won something as Karl whines that he should have listened to him. About what? Stay tuned because this situation will be resolved and paid off. See; like The Silver Falcon, this episode is not at the beginning. However; unlike the Silver Falcon it's not at the middle. What you are seeing is the actual beginning of the finish of this episode. Yeah; this is going to be a mess of fun to rant on. So Doofensmirtz blows off Karl because he's ruining this moment and we see an elevator like device crash onto the lookoff roof. The door opens and it's...Oh my god! It's the masked wrestler from Koodoo! YES! I'm automatically adding a * to this baby just for that. We discover that he is Li'l Saul which I guess is his non-unionized name since Koodoo probably owns the rights to the unionized name anyway. Also behind him is a bunch of English royal guards standing squished together acting like toy soliders. Doofensmirtz calls them Breakingham Palace Crew which is cute.\n\nSo Li'l Saul is hear to cut non-sensial promos while holding sparklers for fun. Li'l Saul is voiced by Eric Bauza and according to Wikipedia (DANGER! DANGER!): Bauza started his career in animation as a character designer, working with a few production studios in Hollywood. It was this introduction to the animation world that eventually led him to a successful career in voiceovers. In just a few years, Bauza has starred in such shows as Nickelodeon’s El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera, The Fairly OddParents, Spike TV’s Ren & Stimpy: Adult Party Cartoon, Warner Bros. Animation’s Coconut Fred's Fruit Salad Island, Hasbro's G.I. Joe: Resolute, and Hero: 108 as Red-Faced Kawn and Camel King. Aside from his television credits, Bauza has played multiple roles on \"The King and Us\", a web-series sponsored by Burger King, and was seen on the NFL on Fox TV pre-game show. Bauza had a cameo role as \"Digger the Nascar Gopher\" in Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakuel. Currently, Bauza is the voice of Lord Stingray on the Adult Swim show, Superjail! as well as Marvin the Martian on \"The Looney Tunes Show\", and Dr. Psychobos on \"Ben 10: Omniverse.\" He also appeared in episodes of the Animated web series Dick Figures, where he voiced the Genie of the Teapot, the Vulgar Mall Santa, and the Ninjas. He has also been the voice of Lord Takagami, the main antagonist of Dick Figures: The Movie (the first feature-length animated production by Mondo Media and Six Point Harness and one of the most popular animated projects being funded through Kickstarter). Bauza is currently working on his stand up routine, and has already performed at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles alongside Harland Williams.[2] He began his career as a layout artist for The Drawn Together Movie in 2000.\n\nKick Buttowski is his DTVA debut as Doctor Huang (I know; I missed him the first time in Power Play) and was in Gravity Falls; as well as being the new soundalike voice of Gizmoduck/Fenton Crackshell for Ducktales Remastered. Bravest Warriors (Santean #1), Breadwinners (Buhdeuce), Shelf Life (Fay Solider) and Uncle Grandpa (Belly Bag) are his most recent credits. He has 70 acting credits, two other credits (Ren & Stimpy's Adult Party Cartoon (ZOINKS!)), three direction credits, three animation credits (Good Vibes), two producer credits (Toon Wolf, The Amazing Larry), three editing credits (The Littlest Sketch Show, The Encyclopaedia of Hell Book Movie), one sound credit (McBusters), one writing, two Cinematographer credits and three Self credits to his resume. There is also a blanket and a radio on top of it. And now the Breakingham Palace robot crew dance, dance, dance to their doom. H....Oh; never mind, I'm not doing Gargamel again out of respect for Doofensmirtz. Doof's dance moves are almost Rick Rude-equse with the twisting of the hip as he proclaims that this party is off the hooks; which works better as a pun on Fish Hooks then on this show. So the building door opens and in comes....Linda? Wait; what? One of the royal guards is breakdancing on the white towel on the far shot as Karl notices Linda and claims that it is not what she thinks. Linda comes over and gives Karl the fedora hat and then simply backs to the door and closes it as she stands in the hallway. Then she proclaims that this day cannot get any weirder and then her cellphone rings and the cellphone screen shows a shot of Candace; which Linda proclaims that she stands corrected. So she takes the call as we see Candace in the backyard complaining about some cheese something city of whatever as Linda is at a loss to understand what she is talking about.\n\nThen we go to a building window shot of a street corner in Danville as it's BEFORE HAPPY HOUR (sunset) as cars are whizzing backwards. That would normally be a logic break on a grand scale; but the title on the top screen reads five minutes ago, so time is going backwards.So we head to some red dome somewhere in Danville as denizens are running away from Major Monogram whose's shirt has changed colors since the first scene. Monogram is chashing them while wearing blue pants and shoes; wanting to hi-five everyone; in spite of the fact that in this world; they have three fingers and an opposable thumb. Judging by the background of building that look like cheese styled building; I'm guessing Phineas & Ferb's big idea is a cheese fair of some kind. Apparently; Major Monogram won a contest because he has a first place blue ribbon pinned on his shirt. Monogram doesn't like being left hanging as I discover that they are in the backyard because Monogram is running slowly out of the backyard with Candace in the foreground pleading for Linda to come now. Candace blows off Monogram for no reason and we get the narrator in semi deadpan mode saying 15 minutes later. So this is Phineas & Ferb's rib on Spongebob Squarepants narrator; only Phineas' version has them going backwards in time rather than forward; and also has the same street corner with title on top and the sky is becoming blue with clouds now. So we cut to back to the lab as Karl is in the squirrel costume contacting Monogram in the cage yelling at Monogram that Agent P might be working for someone. We don't know who it is because Karl is panicky. See; Major Monogram is on stage which looks like a block of Swiss Cheese as there is a cheese eating contest with some brown haired guy wearing a black windbreaker and a pack of mice doing the delta cheerleading chain spot. They are behind the table with a pile of cheese as Phineas is the judge. And yes; this is a cheese fair Phineas built. Complete with cheese merry-go-round horses and ferris wheel stylized to look like cheese. This is so cheesy that it's good cheese.\n\nSo Phineas has the FCC AIRHORN OF DEATH to start the event (The secret weapon to nullify Peter Griffin's bad behavior) and they eat up; much to the protests of Karl. Monogram's head swells up as Karl screams; which we see Doofensmirtz steal the wristwatch away from Karl and puts it on the table. He blows off Karl as we see Perry standing there in a butler suit as Doofensmirtz proclaims that Perry quit the organization completely and joined him as he shows off the laser device of the day which is called The Vaporizer-inator. See; his mind is now clear for some odd reason as he proclaims that since everything is made of water; the vaporizer-inator will basically vaporize anything given the proper science skills to pull off. He also proclaims that he is a genius for realises this time as he orders Perry (who has become Doofensmirtz's butler natch) is ordered to go to the hamster wheel and he sells it. So Doofensmirtz goes to his evil control center computer and starts powering up his device as sparks fly and a vaporized purple swirly storm engulfs the entire tri-state area sky. Doofensmirtz proclaims that this is so hot in here that he strips himself down to just his white underwear and shoes. Okay; so he doesn't have the muscles of Sampson; but come on Karl! It's not that disturbing that you need to close your eyes and think happy places like the secret. It's not like \"The Secret\" can save you from the wrath of Doofensmirtz's evil underpants anyway. So Doofensmirtz is typing on the machine as his first target is a sandy beach and the computer screen shows said beach; but there are no denizens there which confuses Doofensmirtz. Wait, what? Why should Doofensmirtz care about if people are at the beach if you are merely demonstrating the Vaporizerinator anyway? Anyhow; we get the narrator street corner time shift backwards screen; only it's 25 minutes earlier now. And yes the clock is going backwards as well. I discover that there is a market at this street corner as we head to a sky shot of Phinea's property as there is a long lineup on the sidewalk and into the driveway for this cheese fair event; like so many episodes in this series have demonstrated.\n\nSo we do a pan over of the property towards the backyard as Phineas proclaims that this is the biggest turnout in their summer's history. Buford, Baljeet, Ferb and Isabella are all there as Buford proclaims that it doesn't get cheddar then this; and then taking a bow like he is all clever and stuff. Something tells me Buford has no idea that the kids' praise of them seems like a backhanded compliment. Anyhow; Phineas addresses the crowd and then the giant white cover is pulled off and it's the cheese carnival known as Cheesetopia according to Phineas. I guess \"Cheese Carnivale\" is copyrighted for some reason. The crowd cheers in unison as we have another male in a pink shirt for fun. TEDDY RUXPIN SONG OF DOOM ensues and we hit the montage~! Basically; every ride and game is basically cheese related themed park ride complete with nachos, stringy mozza sticks and a park ride containing a movie theatre where they literally stick a camera to a man who is eating a block of cheese scaring the riders inside. Even the games contain archery with cheese flavors and even prizes as we see Major Monogram again in his purple flower shirt again asking about cheese in the cheese midway while this song is playing. Cut to a different angle shot of the cheese eating stage as Isabella is on the blowhorn informing us that the cheese eating contest is about to begin shortly as we see Karl on the wristwatch trying to plea for Monogram to stop; but he cannot because he's Montrey Jack in human form. So Karl is in the prison as apparently; his squirrel costume went from grey to brown now as he proclaims that if he only had Perry's hat. So we go to 20 minutes earlier (yeah; I stopped caring about the deadpan narrator in this one) as we see Karl hanging from a window looking at Doofensmirtz inside doing something and Karl has Agent P's fedora; and it blows away into the wind. That's why pockets are your friend Karl; even if you wear a fursuit. Ask Kit about it.\n\nAnyhow; the fedora hat blows away into the sky as we get another TEDDY RUXPIN SONG OF DOOM just for that hat. Yeap; this is something Teddy Ruxpin would sing because it sounds so syrupy as the fedora is flying in slow motion now past various citizens of Danvile doing normal human things in life. Everyone is actually waving to the fedora for no reason whatsoever. Oooookkkkaaayyyy. The guise of this is that the hat floats around for a long while as the song is basically a plot device because it comes back to DEI and lands right in front of the sidewalk; which we see Linda grab onto. Linda notices Karl in the squirrel suit on the ledge and she decides to go to DEI to give him the hat back. Karl hops over and proclaims that he needs to know what Agent P is up to. So Karl hides behind something while we see Butler Perry dust with the feather dust of doom and he notices Karl right away beside Karl is a crappy stealth ninja in a squirrel suit. Karl tries to bail as Perry tugs on Doof's pantleg and Doof is not impressed because he sprayed for such stuff beforehand. So he brings out the remote control and of course Karl walks right into the spot where the popup cage is and the cage pops up trapping him. Doofensmirtz mangles metaphors for fun and I didn't really laugh at it sadly. Doof and Perry walk away as Karl wants to know what happened to Agent P. So we go to 25 minutes earlier as we head to the streets near the sidewalk as we see that Doofensmirtz has a truck called Doofensmirtz's Evil Inc. and it's mostly purple. Butler Perry is washing the truck on his own. This is actually the setup to hit the montage as we see Doofensmirtz doing science with focus and determination while Butler Perry is doing butler stuff like cleaning, baking, and shaving Doof's legs in the bathroom. Sadly; his hair is fast growing since the hair grew back at the finish in the beginning of the episode. Did I mention that Doofensmirtz is completely naked and is only wearing a towel. I know some people will blast this; but the High Marshall did the same thing as did Baloo in TaleSpin. Perry also does grape juice holding for Doofensmirtz to suck through a straw. Yeah; there's no song to this. Odd.\n\nSo we end with Perry taking the bag of trash out of the lab as Doofensmirtz shows him where the trash chute is. Then Doofensmirtz notices that Agent P's hat is on the floor and grabs it. He looks at it and proclaims that it contains such childhood memories such as pummeling, thwarting and other such stuff which shows Doofensmirtz is working the heels on this whole gig. Doofensmirtz proclaims that he is sentimental about it which did make me laugh because there is no way I can take that seriously from a goofball like Heniz Doofensmirtz. So he throws the hat out the window anyway and walks off. HAHA! Told you not to take this seriously. So the hat flies through the skies and heads to some arena as there is a lineup of grown men wearing different colored squirrel suits. We see a dark skinned guy with a full on brown mustache and beard claiming that he is pumped for Squirrel Con. So Karl is cosplaying Skippy the Squirrel from Animaniacs? Slappy's not gonna like this yutz! Karl proclaims that at this con; no one will make baleful judgments on him. Riiiiiiggggggghhhhhhhtttttt. So Agent P's hat drops in Karl's hands and he instantly proclaims that something is wrong here as he goes to the wristwatch and we see Monogram is his flower shirt talking at OWCA headquarters now. I think. They exchange notes on the situation as Monogram looks dense because he can see the zipper of Karl's squirrel costume. Anyhow; Monogram tells Karl to go find out what is going on and Karl is so happy because he now becomes a secret agent for probably the first time in his career. Monogram then informs us that he is going to the Cheesetopia cheese fair because it's all about cheese. Karl then informs us that something bad happens when Monogram eats cheese. Yes folks; we have three main characters who cannot consume diary products without getting sick. Who sezs Disney isn't inclusive? Monogram shrugs it off because the doctors \"cleared him\". Ummm; Monogram, there is a major difference between getting cleared by doctors and not having a seriously awful reaction to diary products. Karl signs out and tells his buddy that Squirrel Con will have to wait as he runs off.\n\nWe then discover that the dark skinned guy is the same deliveryman we see in almost every Phineas & Ferb episode. He is holding acorns in his paws which means Karl has more of a life than this poor sucker does. He talks about making a delivery of some kind and then it's six hours earlier as apparently; it's early morning. We cut to a closeup shot of a truck as indeed; the guy is the deliveryman because his squirrel suit is hanging on the passenger side of the seat. He proclaims that this is the last delivery of the day before Squirrel Con as we cut to the backyard as we see mounds and mounds of cheeses piled up in piles throughout the backyard. The last shipment is dumped from the truck as Phineas wants it set somewhere like a caged squirrel man in a costume. HAHA! Phineas proclaims that this is his metaphor and he's sticking to it. HA! So we see Phineas penciling notes on his clipboard as he tells Ferb and Baljeet to help with the cheese foundation as Baljeet rolls in a wheel of cheese with Ferb rolling on it like a log. Phineas turns around and tells Isabella and the Fireside Girls to deliver the flyers. All six Fireside girls are with Isabella; and when are they going to wear something other than their uniforms as normal gear. It's time for the Flyer Delivery Badges as Adyson is not thrilled about this. Isabella asked sharply about saying something as Disney Captions calls her Addison. Yeah. So we see Buford on top of a cheese pile eating the cheese; which Phineas doesn't seem to mind since all he asks is for him to come up with cheese jokes. Buford states that it sounds Gouda to him. It's cheese comedy. HA HA HA! Damn; I'm starting to write like Buford. That's horrifying. Then he sniffs the air and demands answers to who farted as he proclaims that someone is cutting the cheese; which we see Baljeet and Ferb using a gullotine knife to cut a smelly stinky giant block of cheese while wearing gas masks. Only in Phineas & Ferb can an ironic fart joke be cut and end up being so unironic. So we go to two minutes earlier. We see Candace in her bedroom at her desk on the computer while talking to Stacey on the phone about internet lingo gone wrong. Ooookkkkkkaaaayyy.\n\nIt's LOL she misspelled as LOP. Can someone lop off her brain so she can be less of an idiot?! Jermey of course is dense to this; but Candace smells cheese and tells Stacey that she'll call back soon. So she goes to the window and notices the cheese piled in the backyard and that is enough for her to call Linda because she must bust her brothers and destroy their lives. It turns her on see. So Candace is about to dial; when suddenly a jetpack flies by right in front of Candace; but she still has her cellphone, so she's all right. Wait; so she wanted to call Linda; but didn't reach her until near the end when Monogram chased the denizens out of Cheesetopia. That makes no sense. The jetpack smoke is clearly Agent P on his jetpack because 10 minutes earlier; we head to the backyard where Phineas, Ferb, Isabella, Baljeet and Buford are laughing it up for no reason. Then Phineas asks where Perry is and so we see Agent P plop down at the computer in OWCA headquarters. Major Monogram is on screen with a really close closeup of his lower face. We discover that Karl has the day off (which explains the Squirrel Con thing at least) as Monogram has to work the controls himself including the visual aids. Anyhow; Doofensmirtz has got a tuxedo, a silver tray and white gloves (which was an excuse for Monogram to trace his four fingered hand for). More not amusing art as he drew a badly drawn Agent T out of it. Agent P is not amused by this and neither am I. Monogram then claims that it's too soon. Wait; what was the point of that? So this ends with a shot of someone else's lawn and a trapdoor as Perry flies up with his jetpack and the animation makes it as if it never flew close to Candace at all as it goes stage left. Now I thought that we would go to DEI and find out how Doofensmirtz outsmarted Perry and turned him into his butler. That's not what happened. What happened was: Monogram is at the monitor and he smells cheese. Now that is fine on itself...and then they go to 15 minutes earlier and we'll back in the backyard with Phineas asking Buford why cheese. WHAT THE HELL?! So you want the kids to leave that one up to the imagination. Oh sod off!!\n\nAnd to think; this episode was actually chugging along and beating up the Darkwing Dark version of this; and giving Silver Falcon the runs. Now; it's barely ahead of Mutantacy now. Buford makes cheese jokes which the kids no sell. Then Buford claims that he's provolone about this. I'm guessing that this originally started as a 22 minute episode and the execs wanted it pared down to 11 minutes. It wouldn't be the first time exec meddling has backfired on them and this is a prime example of it. I don't give a damn about Buford's cheese puns; I want know what happened to Perry before he became Doofensmirtz's butler. That's an important plot point and they are white washing that in favor of jokes that don't catch. Even worse; Buford was doing cheese puns during the fair, so the jokes got through anyway. More cheese puns from Buford as Phineas praises him for the puns anyway because he likes to smile a lot. I don't mind him having that emotion most of the time; but at least with Phineas does it, it's charmly naive. If Teddy Ruxpin or Barney did this en masse, then it comes off as contrived and forced. So Phineas admits that they have to do this now that they have nothing else prepared. So Isabella asks about said invention and we go to five minutes earlier. Yes folks; they have completely glossed over two important plot points just for comedy. Now granted; this next scene has to happen since it's important for the finish to work. However; TWO MAJOR PLOT POINTS ARE NOT EVEN ADDRESSED! Here they are in case you have forgotten: (1.) Why did it take six hours plus for Candace to phone Linda? There was no incident that took place that would allow for such a delay. The second one is: What happened in between Perry leaving OWCA headquarters and suddenly becoming a butler. That one is a massive plot hole in and around itself! (Note from the future: You're going to regret that last one sir!) How is it possible that they forgot that? Because if you don't sprinkle nothing but jokes; the kids will change the channel. This is not Fanboy & Chum Chum new Disney! This show doesn't pretend to be that. Stop trying to be something you are not! There is a third point they didn't address; but it's too minor: How did Monogram get that shirt?\n\nSo we cut to the backyard as Candace runs in yelling to Linda to not go shopping just yet as we discover that there is a giant metal box in the backyard. Candace bangs on it protesting this outrage as we discover that this is Li'l Saul and the Breakingham Crew. Oookkkkaaayyyyy. So we hear an automated female voice proclaiming that joy is located and the metal box shoots into the sky and disappears off-screen. Candace then yells to Linda to never mind that and go back to doing errands. Phineas & Ferb walk in with Isabella, Buford and Baljeet as Phineas explains that Li'l Saul and company are unemployed and this invention was to help them get a living back. Now that is great of him. We discover that the invention was a celebration seeking rocket which helps them get full time employment. Apparently; Phineas assures us that the device will kick up any party up to 11. Sadly; it has no hope for Kick Buttowski because it's already up to 11, with white noise and nothing up to 11. Sadly; Phineas and company realize that it is gone as Candace walks off claiming that he knows how she feels. In other words; Candace successfully screwed Phineas & Ferb. She WON! This is one special episode either way; no matter how messy it has gotten. Ferb proclaims that he hopes they can handle a party of that magnitude. So finally; we go forward and return to the present and probably about ten minutes later than that because we have a rave as all the denizens were chased all the way to DEI. How did that happen? Oh great; we are Darkwing Duck now! So close; so close. So Doofensmirtz goes over to the hamster wheel and tells Perry that he can take a break and help service the guests. Perry stops and finds the out of nowhere tray of glasses containing grape juice as he holds it like a butler. So Perry serves two drinks to guests and then walks over to the cage to offer a glass to Karl; but Karl bats the grape juice into Perry's outfit messing it up. He blows off Perry for betraying OWCA asking why he went to the darkside. Ummm; he's brainwashed maybe.\n\nKarl puts the fedora hat on him to try to knock some sense into him; but Doofensmirtz comes in and whacks the fedora hat off him. Doofen apparently is not thrilled that Perry got grape juice all over the suit because he doesn't want street urchins as butlers (Kit: Damn! Oh wait...); so he tells Perry to go to the rest room and wash it off before it sets. So we see Perry walk into the bathroom and wash his hands at the sink. He tries to scrub the suit; but no dice. So he opens it to reveal his body. I find out that it is mirrored to see: I fight evil. Well; then we hit the flashback back to the lab and....OH MY GOD! THEY DID ADDRESS THE PLOT POINT THAT MATTERS! YES! YES! YES! YES! I'm glad I was wrong this time. Geez; somehow I am having Back Out In The Outback flashbacks with Sundowner. Okay; here's what happened: Perry is trapped in some sort of purple collar around his waist. He is standing in front of three mirrors as there are various mech arms checking out the platypus' dimensions as Doofensmirtz (with full regular gear now) proclaims that he is seeking the perfect measurements of Perry because this device is known as the Butlerinator. So the only plot hole that was there is Candace's six hour delay to call Linda. As usual, Candace is a total idiot. So the arms steal his fedora hat as a black marker is writing stuff on the clipboard. Doof's plan for Perry was that the Butler-inator would turn him into a butler and he would forget that he is supposed to fight evil. Yeah; it doesn't make a lot of sense; but at least they addressed the plot hole instead of glossing it over for cheese puns. This is officially better than The Silver Falcon now as Perry grabs the marker and hears Doofensmirtz's voice echo like Satahn and is about to write something as the pipes engulf him as the machine apparently turns him into a butler not unlike Baloo's dream in From Here To Machinery when he was turned into a robot. So we head back to reality as we see what Perry wrote on his chest and then we hear a toilet flush. So we see Perry fling the door open and he runs in and takes the fedora from Karl who is surprised by this.\n\nSo we go to the finish as Doofensmirtz is loving this party getting kicked up to 11; and then he gets punched in the face by Perry. On-screen with no impact stars; and it stuck the jaw too! Doofensmirtz drops on his ass and is shocked and appalled that Perry has double crossed him. Perry points to his chest which Doofensmirtz translates as Thait I Live; which he thinks it's a new rock band which I'm almost certain will be the next boy band for Disney in a few years time; if it hasn't already been taken. So Perry brings out a mirror which somehow reflects the message properly despite being shown as if it couldn't see the actual message. Doofensmirtz gasps in horror as the jig is up now because Perry wrote a note to himself in the future. Doof gets kicked in the face and Doof falls to the end and then gets dragged away as Doof claims that he didn't predict that. Anyhow; we head to the driveway AFTER HAPPY HOUR (after dark) as Linda gets out of her car and Candace jumps up and down in such a choppy way as she is yelling cheese in rapid fire. She drags Linda towards the backyard as we head back to Doofensmirtz flying into the Vaporizerinator and he drops to the floor. The thing changes angles (how was that grandstanding working for ya Doof?) and it fires a beam straight at Cheesetopia and it completely disappears. Candace drags Linda into the backyard with her eyes closed and Linda notices that it's a nice backyard and walks off because the place is clean. Candace is stunned as we see Agent P smashing the Vaporizerinator and it blows up somewhat. The music goes dead as do the lights as we see the metal box with a shot of the gauge pointing to having no joy (a red frowny face). So Li'l Saul and the Breakingham guards blow off this dead party; get into the box; shut the door and the thing rockets away never to be seen again. At least in theory. The rest of the partygoers all walk out because no Saul equals no ball according to a white shirt brown haired male. Doofensmirtz pleas for them to come back because he was going to break out the bubble machine. No one cares what he thinks though; except for me because that would have been hilarious.\n\nSo we get the far shot as Perry is handgliding with Karl hanging by Agent P's legs which has to be awkward for both characters. Doofensmirtz pops up from the far shot and curses Perry; and then on the closeup he curses Karl who is the man squirrel man thingy; which is the funniest blowoff I have heard from him. HAHA! So we head back to the backyard as Phineas, Ferb, Isabella, Baljeet and Buford enter from the gate; and Phineas gasps after talking about Monogram chasing them out of the backyard. Yes; Cheesetopia is gone as Buford calls this Swiss-picious as he calls this his 100th cheese pun; which would have been a good payoff if he did say 100 cheese puns; which I counted about 30 at best. So after eight hours and three minutes of fun; Perry shows up as Buford notices him. He then faces the hard camera and that is scene to end the episode and The Perry Files at 12:00 approx. Well; they almost screwed it up, but thanks to Perry going to the bathroom; he saved an important plot point from creating a major league plot hole. The whole episode was cheesy and the idea of media res would have worked perfectly had they plugged up some of the logic breaks; and it didn't look all that sloppy like a Darkwing Duck episode. However; this was a fun episode to watch this way and if they ever do this again; I hope that they take my words to heart and take better care of the little things which made the episode sloppy in the first place. Oh well. **** (80%). Hopefully; the next three DVD sets will feature actual endings instead of recycled footage from the musicials because this musicial endings are getting old. And as I expected; they are using stock stills from Getty Images.\n\nTHE REVIEW LINE\n\nSo we end the Perry Files on a high note as both episodes were really fun rides; albeit their usual sloppy selves. I will say this about the media res episode Remains Of The Platypus: I loved this episode more than the Silver Falcon because it was a fun solid 11 minutes of a mostly well written cartoon (okay; I admit that I almost thought otherwise) with only one major plothole which was Candace waiting six hours plus to phone Linda which made no sense at all considering that she phoned about 10 minutes before the finish actually occured. I was almost wanting to hammer this episode for not addressing the plot point of how Perry got to be Doofensmirtz's butler; but thankfully, they did a regular flashback (ironic that they would do media res and a flashback in the same episode) and we found out how he became a zombie butler; even if they forgot how Perry got trapped which is part of the comedy of the Perry/Doof segment. Still; the smackdown was lovely and Karl in a squirrel suit was pretty funny for me. Cheesetopia was cheesy; but that was written well enough and I was fine with the cheese puns once the major plot point was cheesed up to 11 and I could accept the cheese jokes from Buford as they are instead of being a barrier against good plotting. Monogram was nothing and there were some logic breaks, but they were minor. Overall; Remains is better than The Silver Falcon and I'll glady take this over Muntancy Over The Bouncy. As for Escape From Phineas' Tower; it was basically your average Phineas & Ferb love in; but felt like it was rushed for an 11 minute episode and looked sloppy as ever. I would have been impressed by Ferb's unbinding skills if the animators actually didn't screw up the spot. So I don't have much to say about it; but anything that makes Candace do absolutely nothing deserves my respect as a writer. Oh; and get used to seeing that ending on Phineas & Ferb Take Two because P&F love to goad guests into doing that ending.\n\nThat officially ends The Perry Files and 15 more episodes accounted for; which I gave five thumbs up, eight in the middle and two thumbs down for a grand total after 33 episodes: 11 thumbs up, 18 in the middle and four thumbs down which is absolutely great in this era and probably better than a good chunk of the shows from the Disney Afternoon, Pre-DA and One Saturday Morning eras. Again; this is Phineas & Ferb. It's not for nitpickers. It is a fun show that lasts mostly 11 minutes, sometimes 22 minutes. It is a show where it is as sloppy as Darkwing Duck; but it's more fun due to the fact that only Candace is the problem in terms of likability. Doof/Perry will always be an episode carrier; for better or for worse. However; if you want to compare it to TaleSpin, it doesn't measure up in most areas. However; TaleSpin is a different breed of animal altogether and Phineas & Ferb is one where I can sit back and enjoy knowing that the show is sloppy. It does what it set out to do and I cannot ask for more. It has earned it's reputation thus far. Now after going through half of the DVD sets; it's time to move onto the second half. Next up is The Perry Files: Animal Agents as this one focuses on Agent P and his animal agent colleagues. There are six full segments with 5 of them having 11 minute shorts; while the sixth one \"Where's Perry\" is a 22 minute episode as Karl becomes evil somewhere in this mess. Once I finish this DVD (which should take two weekends tops); I'll throw in an extra treat which is the Take Two Phineas & Ferb talk show segments. I was planning to do a separate rant on them; but there are only six of these segments and each is 2 1/2 minutes long; so it shouldn't take long to get through all of them. Then from there; we tackle the bonus episodes on Mission Marvel which is four full segments; two of them 11 minute shorts and the other two are full 22 minute episodes. Once that is completed; we do Mission Marvel for real and then end the Phineas & Ferb review with the 2nd Dimension movie; ala So The Drama. I hope you are ready to handle all of these animal agents and evil Karl. So....\n\nThumbs in the middle for Escape From Phineas Tower and thumbs up for The Remains Of A Platypus and I'll see you all next time.\n\nBack to New Disney Rants Index!\n\nReturn to the Rant Shack!"
