        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Comedy Central has picked up freshman animated comedy Brickleberry for a second season to premiere in fall 2013. The second-season order is for 13 episodes, up from 10 episodes for the current first season. Brickleberry, executive produced by Daniel Tosh, has done well airing behind Tosh’s hit Tosh.0 on Tuesday. The animated comedy, which revolves around a group of dysfunctional park rangers at a second-tier national park, premiered on September 25 to 1.7 million viewers and a 1.0 rating in adults 18-49. Its strength has been young male demos, which are coveted by advertisers. Seven weeks into the run, Brickleberry is averaging 1.8 total million viewers each week and is the second-highest-rated series in its time slot with men 18-34 and men 18-24 in all of television. “We are happy to continue educating America’s youth about nature, and the national conservation movement,” commented Kent Alterman, Comedy Central‘s Head of Original Programming and Production.\n\nBrickleberry is created/executive produced by Waco O’Guin and Roger Black (MTV2’s Stankervision). “This is incredible news!” O’Guin said of the renewal. “I can’t wait to get more angry phone calls from my mother.” Added Black, “Now I can pay off my Chevy Cobalt.” Brickleberry voice talent includes Kaitlin Olson, Tom Kenny, Dave Herman, Jerry Minor, Roger Black, and Tosh as Malloy, the cuddly yet vulgar and spoiled resident bear. Brickleberry is produced by Fox 21, marking the first cable comedy series and first animated series for the company behind cable drama hits Sons Of Anarchy and Homeland. The animation is produced at Bento Box."
