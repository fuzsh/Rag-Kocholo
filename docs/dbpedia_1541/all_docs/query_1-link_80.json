        "text": "Anytime religion is lampooned, it’s generally funny, and this episode was no exception. There were ample gags, beginning with the opening scene, which also featured the nub-limbed and hilarious Firecracker Jim. However, Woody gets the most attention out of any character, and this takes away from a bit of the laughs. In this writer’s humble opinion, the self-absorbed, dim-witted Ranger Steve is a much funnier character, and might have fared a bit better in the episode’s lead role. In the end, he actually gets the least amount of screen time (or maybe second to Connie) and this was a bit of a bummer. Also, I feel like Steve would be a bit more likely to run an enormous ruse anyway (at least from a moral standpoint) than Head Ranger Woody.\n\nRegardless, the cute, cuddly & offensive Malloy managed to get into both storylines for some extra laughs, and it ended up still being an entertaining start to the second season.\n\nComedienne Natasha Leggero also did a nice job replacing the recently-departed Kaitlin Olson in the role of Ethel, making for a smooth transition from last year.\n\nAlthough Brickleberry caught some initial flak for its obvious intent to offend with a slew of racist, morally-corrupt, and blasphemous jokes, it nevertheless established a solid base of snarky writing, well-developed characters, and outstanding voice acting. If Brickleberry’s sophomore season can match its first, and perhaps establish its own well-defined niche within the animated series community, this show could become a comedic force for years to come."
