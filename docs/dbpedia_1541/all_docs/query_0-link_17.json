        "text": "Found some art from a short I helped make a few years ago.\n\nAs I worked with my pal, Zach Smith on his short for Nickelodeon a few years ago, we wrote, rewrote, and rewrote some more as we played around trying to nail down the final product, each time boarding out these versions along the way. Today, while looking through my old files, I came across a folder containing quite a few of the early rough versions of this short with many gags, and passes I had completely forgot about. (So glad I kept these.)\n\nThe first image I'm posting is a page of doodles and notes I made as I was doing research on deers as I tried to get some insight on the main character, Dennis. This a great starting place for any character/show development because it helps bring elements that can spark insights on the characters, rules for the universe, or even help with world building. These sketches just helped me illustrate fun tidbits like: Deer will starve if food runs out because they won't travel into a new domain. I took visual notes in their speed and leaping abilities, and, most importantly, the fact that they poop up to 13x a day as some of the other interesting facts I learned (that would definitely interfere with ones daily routine, right?) These are ideas I would have loved to have weaved into the show had Zach and I developed this short into a series.\n\nBelow that image, is one of my very early thumbnail roughs (and animatic, just playing around) to see what is and isn't working about these characters. The great thing about working in Storyboard Pro is you can create in a timeline mode that allows you to easily drop in temp dial/sfx to see how well things are playing before you finally get into actual animatic editing and storyboard clean-up. Below that, is another version of the storyboard that is closer to the final piece. I believe you can still see the final WOODSTUMP short that Zach and I created at nick.com\n\nI post these here more as a dumping ground for me so I don't lose these files, more than a \"this is how to do it\" blog. Also, it's fun to share the process with those who might not know the stages animation can sometimes go through on the way to a final produced piece.\n\nHere's one of the many different passes above...\n\nand here's one closer to the final board\n\nA really fun part about working in this industry...\n\n..is sometimes your friends put you into the shows. I've made it into a few different series, but I just came across this one today. It's from the \"Teacher's Pet\" movie I worked on. I'm the guy playing with the beach ball, and the one who laughs at me is another board artist from the show, Tina Kugler. She and I were inseparable during that entire production, and I couldn't have survived without her there to laugh and freak out with. I loved working with that entire crew and am glad that most of us have continued to work with each other off an on over the years.\n\nFamily Guy \"Blind Ambition\" boards\n\nThis was the very first work I had done on the show. I boarded the first half of Act 1 (and adjusted/fixed parts on the second half), having so much fun posing out Peter's bowling and adding subtle acting and expressions to all the characters. After I finished my pass (with little to no notes from Seth), we went back and added the Chicken Fight Sequence. That massive insert was an undertaking that required multiple board artists to create, so many of us can take credit for this awesome sequence.\n\nOne of my favorite little contributions was to that fight was the sound work I did in the original animatic. It happened just after following Peter and the Chicken as the came down from the train tracks rolling towards at the edge of a cliff. You can here the music and SFX playing at full intensity just until they roll off the cliff. Then, when I cut to an extremely wide shot, with the 2 falling towards a giant cruise ship, I only left a faint/subtle SFX track of them still hitting each other, until the next cut, when the sound came back in at full volume in the interior dining room. It got great laughs in the screening, but was changed in the final sound mix. Of course there were other parts I really enjoyed figuring out and punching up in that fight (Indiana Jones ref, etc.) but that little punch to almost complete silence still makes me smile when I think about it.\n\nThis clip is ref from the board posted above."
