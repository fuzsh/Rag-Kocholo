        "text": "'Phineas and Ferb' was one of the few Disney Channel shows in (relatively) recent years that was watched by me and my siblings, also Disney fans, since its inception and continued to watch completely hooked, the re-runs being holiday highlights. That's no joke. The earlier episodes are better than the later ones, funnier and more creative, but even when the show was not at its best it was better than quite a lot of the shows airing on Disney Channel, which has not been the same it used to be for years, at the time.\n\nAs a big fan of Perry the Platypus (my personal favourite 'Phineas and Ferb' character), \"Sidetracked\" was an absolute delight. It is something of a Perry showcase and a change of pace for the show, and it displays everything that is so great about Perry as a character while giving him some development. There are many fantastic episodes that have Perry in a major role, and \"Sidetracked\" is one of the best and it was nice, refreshing even, to have a change from the usual formula.\n\n\"Sidetracked\" succeeds in every area, and wonderfully. The animation is bright and colourful, with such vibrant colours that literally pop out at you and beautifully detailed backgrounds. The music is in the style that is not usually my style of choice when listening to music, but it is very catchy and pleasant to listen to. The theme song is irresistible with a melody that sticks in the head for days without being an earworm and with very quotable lyrics.\n\nThe writing is very funny and intelligent. Once again, the right balance of being easy to understand for children while not being too juvenile for adults is successful. While also having a lot of heart, Perry's inner conflict in how he feels about Lyla was beautifully done. The story is lively in pace with some thrilling action oriented moments, like the climax, great suspense in a spy in action thriller kind of way and having the right amount of emotion too.\n\nLoved the chemistry between Perry and Lyla and even more so Perry's complex character writing (while also still being very true to character), that gives him an illuminating past and significant growth. It was not hard to identify with how he was feeling in what was a difficult situation for him to be in. Doofenschmirtz is wonderfully wacky as usual while having a little more menace than usual. It didn't feel like an over-extended Perry and Doofenschmirtz subplot, instead a proper story with them and also Lyla. Can't fault the voice acting.\n\nOverall, wonderful. 10/10."
