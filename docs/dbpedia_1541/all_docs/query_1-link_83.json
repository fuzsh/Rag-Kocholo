Co-produced by Fox 21 and COMEDY CENTRAL, “Brickleberry” is executive produced by Daniel Tosh (“Tosh.0”), and series creators/writers/executive producers Waco O’Guin and Roger Black (MTV2’s “Stankervision”). The thirteen-episode second season is scheduled to premiere in Fall 2013.\n\n“We are happy to continue educating America’s youth about nature, and the national conservation movement,” said Alterman.\n\n“This is incredible news!” said O’Guin. “I can’t wait to get more angry phone calls from my mother.”\n\n“Now I can pay off my Chevy Cobalt,” added Black.\n\n“Brickleberry” premiered its first season on September 25 and is currently airing new episodes on Tuesdays at 10:30 p.m. ET/PT following “Tosh.0.” Seven weeks into the run, the series is averaging 1.8 total million viewers each week and is the second-highest rated series in its timeslot with Men 18-34 and Men 18-24 in all television. (source: Nielsen Media Research, most current data, 9/25/12 – 10/30/12, original telecasts only)\n\n“Brickleberry,” co-produced by Fox 21 and COMEDY CENTRAL, is an animated series revolving around a group of dysfunctional park rangers at a second tier national park. “Brickleberry” voice talent includes Kaitlin Olson (“It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia”) as “Ethel,” the smoking hot top ranger who is transferred to Brickleberry, Tom Kenny (“SpongeBob SquarePants”) as “Woody,” the head ranger who has good intentions, but not always the best ideas, Dave Herman (“Futurama”) as “Steve,” the overconfident Ranger of the Month, Jerry Minor (“Eastbound & Down”) as “Denzel,” the African American ranger who isn’t comfortable in the woods, Roger Black as “Connie,” the unusually strong and masculine female ranger, and Tosh as “Malloy,” the cuddly, yet vulgar and spoiled resident bear.\n\n“Brickleberry” is executive produced by Daniel Tosh (“Tosh.0”) and series creators/writers/executive producers Waco O’Guin and Roger Black (MTV2’s “Stankervision”). Jim Sharp and Ian Friedman are the Executives in Charge of Production for COMEDY CENTRAL. The animation is produced at Bento Box in Burbank, CA.\n\nO’Guin and Black are repped by Odenkirk Provissiero Entertainment and David Stone at WME.\n\nFox 21 is a production company housed within Twentieth Century Fox Television devoted to making creatively ambitious scripted series for the cable television market, as well as unscripted shows for both cable and broadcast networks. Fox 21, led by President Bert Salke, currently co-produces the award-winning cable smash “Sons of Anarchy” as well as the critically acclaimed “Homeland,” starring Claire Danes and Damian Lewis, which took home both the Golden Globe and the Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series after its first season on the air.\n\nAvailable on-air, online and on-the-go, COMEDY CENTRAL (www.cc.com) is the #1 brand in comedy and is owned by, and is a registered trademark of, Comedy Partners, a wholly-owned unit of Viacom Inc.
