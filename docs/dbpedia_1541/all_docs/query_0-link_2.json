        "text": "This episode of Brickleberry could of been actually good, the main plot is interesting, and I ALMOST found some of the jokes to be funny. But this episode had to ruin it, with a lot of just bland boring stuff, like the B-Plot I could barley even care about, and kinda the wack pacing.\n\nI mentioned the jokes \"almost\" being funny, and they almost are, but they end up being predicable. If you want to hear more about it, then Jay Exci talks about how the scene in which Woody shows the lake to the other rangers is really unfunny, and how it fails on landing it's jokes.\n\nI also would like to say, that while this episode has decent animation (being the first one to be done in Toon-Boom rather than Flash), it's still very stilted and weird, especially during the Miracle Lake song bit with the backup singers looking dead inside.\n\nOverall, this episode could of been passable, had they not ruined it with horrible pacing and actual funny jokes. But hey, that's just Brickleberry for you."
