When Steve's childhood hero, Flamey the Bear, comes to Brickleberry for the televised re-opening of the forest, Woody charges Steve with keeping him sober. While Steve deals with the destruction of his childhood ideals, Woody pays the price for having mildly criticized Malloy by being turned slowly into a prize-winning fish.",

        "text": "So here we have the infamous Family Guy knockoff from the early 2010s, a show well known as being an example of the worst adult animation has had to offer. Is it as bad as people back then made it out to be? Well yes, as you can tell from the title of this review but it is honestly a show that is way worse than I remembered. I don't think I'll watch another episode again after watching \"Hey Dottie\", \"Gay Bomb\" and now this. The former episode \"Gay Bomb\" was so bad that I believe rating it anything higher than a 0 would not be truthful. This episode has some jokes that almost.... barely work. The show Brickleberry prides itself on edgy sex joke humour and sometimes that kind of humour can be done effectively but not here. All of the jokes here have been done soooo many times before and much better before, even in other animated sitcoms I find to be low quality. The jokes are so unoriginal that you see them coming a mile away so even if you like this kind of humour, this episode is probably not going to make you laugh. On another note, the episode seems to think that the existence of crack and sex is a joke in and of itself since there are several instances where it seems like they're trying to make a joke but there is no visible punchline, they just referenced drugs and sex which they have forced into this plot so much that it just becomes quite ridiculous. Some jokes within the episode, however, were almost funny to me so they might work for the average enjoyer of this type of humour which I am not generally. Comedy aside, the plot is boring and you can see where it's heading, the characters are dumb and unlikable so there's no reason to care about them and the show may have nicked the episode's subplot from the Aqua Teen Hunger Force episode \"Super Model\". I'm not one to make allegations but the two plots are very similar, but even if they did nick it, I think I'll give them a pass since they did their own thing with it. But all in all, this episode was a waste of time, as are the other episodes of this show."
