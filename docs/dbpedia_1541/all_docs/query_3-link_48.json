        "text": "Skudder started his career as an animator at the animation studio, 6 Point Harness. While he was working on different projects, he was co-developing a web series for Mondo Media with Zack Keller called Dick Figures. When the first episode was released on YouTube, it was met with massive success and eventually became the most viewed web series on the site. Skudder and Keller would subsequently produce 49 additional episodes. Skudder served as a voice actor for Red, Raccoon, and Mr. Dingleberry in the series.\n\nDue to its success, Skudder and Keller created a Kickstarter to fund the feature-length film based on the series, Dick Figures: The Movie (the first feature-length animated production by Mondo Media and 6 Point Harness). It was known for being one of the most popular animated projects being funded through Kickstarter at that time.\n\nAfter Dick Figures ended in 2015, Skudder went on to work for Disney Television Animation's Pickle and Peanut, as a writer for one episode and as a storyboard artist for two of its episodes. Afterwards, Skudder worked as a creative director in animation at GoldieBlox.\n\nIn 2015, he co-created two animated web series with Lynn Wang for Spino TV, titled Kicko Puncho Rhino and Power Glovesâ€”both of which premiered on YouTube. After their conclusion, Skudder worked for Nickelodeon where he co-created, co-directed, and co-written the short film, Space Mission: Danger with Wang for the 2015 Nickelodeon Animated Shorts Program.[6]\n\nIn 2017, Skudder was brought in to work with Warner Bros. Animation as a writer, director, and storyboard artist for an episode of Teen Titans Go!, and would later work with The Lego Group with Wang to co-develop the Cartoon Network animated series Unikitty!. They both worked as producers for seasons 1 and 2, then co-executive producers for the third season. Skudder was also a singer and songwriter for the shows accompanying soundtrack."
