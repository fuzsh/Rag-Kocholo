        "meta_description": "Creatives who should return and who I think should contribute to the amazingly ground-breaking franchise of Spümcø's Ren & Stimpy, whose first season (which was produced by formerly Nickelodeon Animation and later Awesome Incorporated for Comedy Central) has been leaked over the first 7 months of 2024 but is postponed from official linear release due to controversy of the show's original creator and the fans.\n\nNew highlights for my list include Genndy Tartakovsky, Gabe Del Valle, Jim Soper, April \"Pinkie\" Davis, Josh \"Zeurel\" Palmer, Owen Fishback (who worked on the show as an animation and layout revisionist!), Cheyenne Curtis, Dave Stone, Shane Glines, John & Ted Mathot, and Jeff Hutchins.\n\nMy list includes new talents from Season 5 of Samurai Jack, Seasons 7-9 of PPG (\"reboot\" seasons), Season 1 of Star vs. the Forces of Evil, the 2018- Looney Tunes cartoons (who also worked on 2015- episodes of Spongebob), and Reanimated Collabs (i.e. Owen Fishback, Zeurel, etc.)\n\nThe Nicholas Judy guy (currently \"nicholasdreamermemer\", formerly \"nicholasjudy123variousmakerscomp\" on Tumblr) requested various creatives and (overseas) production members from Harvey Street Kids as well to be added through me. I'll assume that this guy is behind all of the fake credits submitted for real animated movies and shows on IMDb; for example and relatively speaking: those may be what Don Shank noticed are \"junk entries\" for show he never worked on.\n\nComments are disabled to avoid hateful statements about John K. due to his past behavior. He can't help his mental issues, but I understand and respect the concern to prevent abuse and harassment in the toon biz. He and Chris Savino are still on the list, but I put John K at the bottom for the sake of you \"haters\". However, some people were recently removed on the list due to arrest for porn, while some others are removed for being in spite of John Kricfalusi for understandable reasons.",

        "text": "Genndy Tartakovsky was born and raised in Moscow, USSR. He and his family moved to Chicago, IL when he was 7 years old, after his father defected to the US. His interest in comic books and animation led him to study animation at CalArts in Los Angeles. While he was there he produced two student films, one of which was the basis of his series Dexters Labor (1996). The character of Dee-Dee was inspired by his older brother Alex, who would often spoil younger brother Genndy's plans (as Dee-Dee does to Dexter). His first long form directing work was for the TV movie of the series, Dexter's Laboratory: Ego Trip (1999). He also directed animation for his collaborator Craig McCracken on Powerpuff Girls (1998) and The Powerpuff Girls Movie (2002).\n\nHis most celebrated work was the epic animated series Samurai Jack (2001), featuring a time-traveling samurai in a battle of good vs. evil. He stopped work on the series to produce Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003) as a direct story tie-in to the beginning of Star Wars: Episode III - Die Rache der Sith (2005). He then directed animation for the Adult Swim pilot Korgoth of Barbaria (2006). Plans were up in the air for over a decade for a possible movie conclusion to Samurai Jack, as well as directing a sequel to Der dunkle Kristall (1982). He created storyboards for the action-packed opening of Iron Man 2 (2010) during this time period.\n\nGenndy produced another dynamic TV series Sym-Bionic Titan (2010), before finally landing his first feature on Hotel Transsilvanien (2012), which would involve taking over a tumultuous production and incorporating 2D techniques to 3D animation. Hotel Transsilvanien 2 (2015) was the first film for which he had creative control over the entire production, although it was still in the style developed during the first film. In 2017, he finally returned to direct a darker season of Samurai Jack to conclude the story on Adult Swim. He is currently directing Hotel Transsilvanien 3 - Ein Monster Urlaub (2018).\n\nRalph Bakshi worked his way up from Brooklyn and became an animation legend. He was born in Palestine under the British Mandate, the son of Mina (Zlotin) and Eliezar Bakshi, and is of Krymchak Jewish descent. He was raised in Brownsville, after his family came to New York to escape World War II. Bakshi attended the Thomas Jefferson High School and was later transferred to the High School of Industrial Arts and graduated with an award in cartooning in 1957.\n\nAt the Terrytoons studio, he started as a cell polisher then graduated to cell painting. Practicing nights and weekends, he quickly became an inker and then an animator. There, he worked on such shows as Mighty Mouse, Heckle and Jeckle, Deputy Dawg, Foofle and Lariat Sam. At 28 he created and directed a series of superhero spoof cartoons called The Mighty Heroes.\n\nIn 1967, Bakshi moved to Paramount Studios. Working with producer Steve Krantz, Bakshi worked on episodes of the Spider-Man TV series and several short films. In the 1970s, Bakshi set out to produce films using his innovative vision for how animated films should be. Krantz suggested Robert Crumb's \"Fritz the Cat\" comic book as Bakshi's first feature. The two set out to meet with Crumb and get the film rights. In 1972, the film premiered and was extremely successful, as the first feature-length animated film to receive an X rating by the American rating system (when it was distributed worldwide, it generally received lower ratings the equivalent of an R rating, and was released as being unrated on DVD).\n\nThe success of \"Fritz the Cat\" allowed Bakshi to produce films featuring his own characters and ideas, and so \"Heavy Traffic\" and \"Coonskin\" were produced, both of which were extremely controversial, but were praised by critics. During the same period, he shot and completed another feature titled \"Hey Good Lookin'\" for the Warner Brothers studio, who didn't think that a combination of live-action and animation would sell, and forced Bakshi to go back and animate the live action sequences.\n\nDuring this period, Bakshi also produced two very successful fantasy films, \"Wizards\" and part one of an animated film adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings.\" Although these films were financially successful, they were misunderstood by critics, and United Artists, the studio that produced \"The Lord of the Rings\" refused to fund the second part, or sequel to Bakshi's ambitious adaptation.\n\nDuring the 1980s, animation went into a decline. \"American Pop,\" done using the same style of realistic animation as \"The Lord of the Rings\" was not successful financially, and critics did not see the point of the film being animated. The finished version of \"Hey Good Lookin'\" was released during the same year as \"American Pop,\" but was also unsuccessful financially. Bakshi's last film of the decade, \"Fire & Ice,\" a collaboration with famed artist Frank Frazetta, was a flop.\n\nBakshi produced several television features with mixed results before returning to film with what would eventually become \"Cool World\" - the script was rewritten several times during production without Bakshi's knowledge until it came to the point where Bakshi did not recognize his own work. The film was critically scorned, and was a box office flop. Fans feel that the film is not a true Bakshi film.\n\nSince then, the Internet and DVD releases of Bakshi's work have brought him a new generation of fans and increased interest, encouraging Bakshi to produce another film. \"Last Days of Coney Island\" is in production. Bakshi lives in New Mexico. A three-day retrospective was held at American Cinematheque at Grauman's Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood, California and the Aero Theater in Santa Monica, California in April, 2005."
