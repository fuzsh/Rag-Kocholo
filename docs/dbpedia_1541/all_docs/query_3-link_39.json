The private owners of Marina del Rey, California-based Cloud 9 Interactive plan to sell the company and its' holdings. Company co-founder, president and CEO Debra Streiker-Fine is in discussions with five potential buyers, and says a recent evaluation assesses that the company is worth $20 million. In September 1997, Cloud 9 formed a television production division (AF 9/16/97), Cloud 9 Media, and announced a slate of several projects in development, including animated series Zeroman (with Leslie Nielsen and Amberwood Productions), I Can Be Three (with Epoch Entertainment) and the development and licensing of original animated characters from Cloud 9's interactive Learning Adventure CD-ROM titles. It is not yet known what the fate of these projects will be.\n\nPulse Alums Get Jinx-ed. Former employees of Pulse Entertainment, a game development company which recently formed P7, an alliance with 7th Level Entertainment to focus on Internet-based interactive content, have formed a new game development company called Jinx. Both P7 and publisher Ripcord are minority shareholders in Jinx. Based in San Francisco and headed by co-founders Vinny Carrella and Phill Simon, Jinx is continuing production on Space Bunnies Must Die!, a game slated for release by Ripcord Games in June. Jinx is also developing a sequel to the Pulse title, Bad Mojo. \"Pulse is going to concentrate on the burgeoning Internet market and we wanted to stay focused on games,\" said Jinx president and executive producer Phill Simon, \"We've got some ideas for different kinds of games which can be made faster and more cost-effectively.\"\n\nM.P.S.C. Surveys Industry. The Motion Picture Screen Cartoonists Union local 839 in Los Angeles released the results of its annual member survey. 39% of the Union's approximately 2,800 members replied to the survey, which reveals some interesting, and sometimes amusing, information, such as: 16.9 % of Local 839 members are originally from outside of the U.S. . . . 31.6% sometimes work non-union. . . . In the past year, 62.4% have worked on animated features, 38.4% on television, 13.7% on direct-to-video and 7.8% on commercials. . . . 25% claim to be afflicted by \"stress\" and 18% by \"irreversible brain damage\" as a work-related ailment. . . . furthermore 54% do not know where their membership card is.\n\nYou can read the complete survey results within the January issue of The Peg-Board on the Motion Picture Screen Cartoonists web site on Animation World Network.\n\nhttp://www.awn.com/MPSC839/839INDEX.HTM\n\nMarlon Schulman, vice president\n\nof Bandai Entertainment's new\n\nHome Video division.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Bandai.\n\nBandai Broadens Business. Tokyo-based Bandai Visual, a division of toy manufacturer Bandai, has launched a new CGI production division called Digital Engine. The company has also launched Bandai Entertainment Video, a U.S.-based division which will handle home video distribution in North America. Marlon W. Schulman, formerly of Orion, has been named vice president of the new distribution division. Two animated feature films are already in production through Digital Engine in Japan. The first project, slated for completion in 1999, is Steam Boy, a science-fiction adventure set in 19th century England and directed by Katsuhiro Otomo (Akira). The second feature, directed by Mamoru Oshii (Ghost in the Shell), is tentatively titled G.R.M. and scheduled for release in 2000. The films will be distributed theatrically before their respective video releases. Additional theatrical and direct-to-video content is also being produced by Bandai-owned traditional animation house Sunrise Studio in Japan.\n\n(Colossal) Turns The Page On Chapter 11. San Francisco-based production company (Colossal) Pictures, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May 1996, has agreed to a settlement offered by Cleveland, Ohio-based company, The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, for an undisclosed amount. Colossal filed a lawsuit against The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in June 1997, alleging breach of contract when the former client canceled a multimedia exhibit project which the studio was producing. The incident is cited by Colossal as a contributing factor in the company's bankruptcy. As stated in Colossal's Bankruptcy Agreement, the money received from The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame will be distributed to Colossal creditors on a percentage basis. While the company publicized an \"emergence from Chapter 11\" in December, several unsecured creditors, including three former sales representatives, will be paid only 29% of the outstanding invoices. \"Colossal has gotten away with staying in business without paying their debt. I believe the amount of money left over for the unsecured creditors, who will be paid last, will be little to nothing,\" said former Colossal rep Mary Vandamme. Though operating on a much smaller scale, Colossal has had a flow of commercial work during the past 18 months in bankruptcy. In December, Colossal signed with two new sales representative companies, Creative Management Partners and Bill Rabin & Associates.\n\nFor the backstory on this ongoing saga, visit Karl Cohen's article, \"(Colossal) Pictures Proves There is Life After Chapter 11,\" in the May 1997 issue of Animation World Magazine.\n\nA talking excrement in Spumco's web cartoon,\n\nThe Goddamn George Liquor Show. © Spumco.\n\nJohn K. Says South Park Story Steals. December's debut of the South Park Christmas special on Comedy Central may have insulted some conservative viewers with its religious mockery and toilet humor, but it has animator/director John Kricfalusi feeling that imitation may not be the best form of flattery. Kricfalusi, who is best-known as the creator of the cartoon show Ren & Stimpy, says that last week's South Park episode stole characters and concepts from several of his original properties. The South Park episode features a singing, dancing piece of human excrement as a main character named \"Mr. Hankey.\" Kricfalusi says he created a similar talking poop character for Dark Horse Comics over four years ago, called \"Nutty the Friendly Dump,\" which is still unpublished, but was pitched to many networks, including Comedy Central, as part of The Goddamn George Liquor Show, which Kricfalusi's company Spumco now broadcasts as an episodic show on the Internet. The web cartoon's first episode, \"The Babysitter,\" which premiered October 15, 1997 (http://www.spumco.com), introduced an entire family of talking poop characters, one of which is complete with a hat and white gloves, like South Park's Mr. Hankey.\n\nComedy Central says Kricfalusi's claims have \"no merit,\" and that neither of South Park's creator/directors Matt Stone and Trey Parker have ever seen the Spumco web site. Additionally, Comedy Central spokesperson Laura Nelson said that the Mr. Hankey character was created 25 years ago by Trey Parker's father, as a potty-training incentive for the young boy. The South Park Christmas episode was watched by over 4 million viewers on Wednesday, earning Comedy Central a record-high 5.4 rating.\n\nIn an interview with AWM, Kricfalusi pointed out that an early Christmas episode of Ren and Stimpy called \"Son of Stimpy\" depicted a similarly characterized talking fart. He also added that the show uses the line, \"you sick little monkey,\" popularized on Ren and Stimpy, and also feels that the Mr. Hankey concept draws from Ren and Stimpy's pseudo-commercial \"Log.\" \"We basically gave up on TV a couple of years ago because we couldn't get anyone to understand our humor,\" Kricfalusi said, \"I know what the audience wants, but I can never figure out what the network wants. It's frustrating when a big distribution network shows up with a bunch of your jokes in one episode.\" Despite his obvious frustration, Kricfalusi admits, South Park is \"the funniest show on TV right now.\"\n\nPeople\n\nMusical Chairs\n\nSaban Entertainment has named Jorge Ferreiro vice president of licensing and merchandising, and Jamie Simons editorial director of licensing and merchandising. . . .

She was 89. Questel was born in 1909 in the Bronx, New York. At age 17 she started her career in entertainment as a vaudeville performer. Then New York-based animator Max Fleischer discovered Questel in her capacity as an impersonator of Helen Kane, and signed her as the giddy, childish voice of his emerging character Betty Boop. One of the first Betty Boop cartoons, Stopping the Show drew from Questel's stage experience, depicting Betty as a vaudeville impersonator of popular performers such as Maurice Chevalier. In all, she performed Betty Boop's voice in more than 100 cartoon shorts produced between 1931 and 1939. In the Popeye cartoons, which started at Fleischer Studios in 1933, Questel performed the voice of Olive Oyl, and when the Popeye shorts were produced by Famous Studios from 1942 to 1957, she voiced most of the studios' female characters, including Little Audrey. On occasion, she even filled in for Jack Mercer as the voice of Popeye! In 1988, Questel performed the voice of Betty Boop in Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Also, on the screen, she acted in numerous live action films in the 1960s-80s, including in the role of Woody Allen's mother in New York Stories (1989).\n\nThe March 1998 issue of Animation World Magazine will include a feature article about Mae Questel, written by Andrew Lederer.\n\nCameron Guess died on December 12, 1997 at his home in Winter Springs, Florida. He was 61. An animator and producer, Guess worked at the National Film Board of Canada (NFBC) from the late 1950s until 1963. There, he worked on the animated short The Great Toy Robbery directed by Jeff Hale and written by Derek Lamb. After receiving a large inheritance, Guess relocated to San Francisco, where he founded the now defunct animation company, Cameron Guess & Associates in 1964. He was joined by Jeff Hale, Derek Lamb and animator Barrie Nelson. The company produced two animated shorts, The Well (1965) and The Shepherd (1967), the latter of which was nominated for an Academy Award. When the theatrical cartoons industry declined in the mid sixties, Guess moved to Florida, where he is survived by his wife and one daughter.\n\nLillian Bounds Disney, widow of Walt Disney, died on Tuesday, December 16, 1997 at her home in West Los Angeles. She was 98 years old. Walt Disney died almost 31 years ago to the day (December 15, 1966). Lillian Bounds came to Los Angeles and got a job as a cel painter at Walt Disney's fledgling studio in 1923. Approximately two years later, Lillian and Walt were married on July 13, 1925, near her birthplace in Lewiston, Idaho. It is believed that Lillian suggested the name \"Mickey\" for Walt Disney's character originally named \"Mortimer Mouse.\" Since Walt's death, Lillian has been active in charitable activities, and in 1987 she made a landmark gift of U.S. $50 million to the Music Center of Los Angeles County, to build the Walt Disney Concert Hall which is set to open in 2001 in downtown Los Angeles. She has also made many donations to Cal Arts animation program. Lillian is survived by one daughter (Roy Disney is the son of Walt's brother), as well as ten grandchildren and thirteen great grandchildren.\n\nFilms\n\nPDI Signs On For Shrek. DreamWorks has confirmed it will contract Pacific Data Images (PDI) to animate their planned feature film, Shrek, set for release in 2000. Palo Alto, California-based PDI is currently in production on DreamWorks' Antz, a partial CG feature slated for release in 1999. The film, based on a children's book by William Steig, has been in development for longer than usual as DreamWorks reportedly looked for another production studio to complete the animation, while PDI was busy with Antz. DreamWorks owns 40% of PDI.\n\nA disturbing image from Paul and Menno de Nooijer's\n\nExit. © Paul and Menno de Nooijer.\n\nDe Nooijers Make Exit. Paul and Menno De Nooijer, the Dutch father and son animation directing team who have created over half a dozen animated shorts such as \"At One View\" and 1995:1995 have completed their first feature film, EXIT. EXIT premiered at the Dutch Film Festival and will be screened in coming months at film festivals in Portugal, France and Germany. The 80 minute live-action film features roughly 10 minutes of animation. It was conceived four years ago as a fully-animated work, but the economics of time caused the project to evolve in the direction of live-action. \"So many animators are moving into live-action features, especially in Europe,\" said Paul DeNooijer, \"The market for short films is decreasing, and there are more opportunities to sell a feature film.\"\n\nVisual Effects\n\nFX Affects\n\nFour Media Company, the Burbank-based company which co-owns Medialab Studio L.A, has signed a deal with Visualize, Inc. to acquire POP Studios, a Venice, California-based company which offers digital production services including visual effects and animation.

News Corp./Saban co-venture Fox Kids Worldwide has revealed its programming plans for its newly-acquired cable network, The Fox Family Channel. The Fox Family Channel will launch on August 15, 1998 with a kids' daytime schedule that includes 50% original, first-run programming. Following the lead of competitor's success with program packaging, Fox Family Channel will debut with a slate of four themed, \"branded\" daytime blocks. \"Morning Scramble\" for kids of all ages, will include the animated series Wowser (Saban), Bit the Cupid (Saban), Little Mouse on the Prairie (Saban), Eek!Stravaganza (Nelvana), All Dogs Go to Heaven (MGM Animation) and the live-action series Pee-Wee's Playhouse. The second block, \"The Captain's Treasure House,\" is aimed at pre-schoolers with animated shows like The Magic Adventures of Mumfie (Britt Allcroft Productions) and Tabaluga (EM-TV). Tic Tac Toons, an all-animation block, will feature Bobby's World (Film Roman), Saban's Adventures of Oliver Twist (Saban), Heathcliff (Saban), The Real Ghostbusters (Columbia Tri-Star), and Classic Harvey Toons (Harvey Entertainment). The last kids block of the day before family-oriented prime-time programming starts is The Basement, which will premiere the animated series Bad Dog (Saban), Monster Farm (Saban), Water Melon (Saban) and Badaboom, (in development at Saban) a compilation of outrageous animation.\n\nThe Fox Family Channel will reach 74 million homes at its' launch, which News Corp. President & COO/Fox Group Chairman Peter Chernin said, \"will be one of the largest debuts in the history of television.\" He added, \"This, combined with the 98 percent reach of U.S. households with Fox Kids Network, gives us an unparalleled programming, promotional and distribution platform.\"\n\nFox also announced its 1998-99 schedule for Fox Kids Network, including eight new animated series coming in fall 1998. New to the Fox Kids Saturday morning lineup will be Mr. Potato Head (in development at Saban) Woody Woodpecker (the new show from Universal Cartoon Studios), Godzilla (Columbia Tri-Star), Mad Jack (Saban) Silver Surfer (Saban) and Captain America (Saban).

Current shows being renewed for 1998-99 include Steven Spielberg Presents Toonsylvania (DreamWorks), Life With Louie (Hyperion), Spider-Man (Saban), Ned's Newt (Nelvana) and Sam & Max (Nelvana).\n\nMax and His Special Problem by Dave Wasson, one of\n\nNickelodeon's Oh Yeah! Cartoon!s. © Nickelodeon.\n\nNick Says \"Oh Yeah!\" to Shorts. Nickelodeon will premiere its new series of animated shorts in July, with the first of 13 half-hour episodes comprised of new, seven-minute cartoons. The series titled Oh Yeah! Cartoons! is being created and produced by Fred Seibert, the former head of Hanna-Barbera Cartoons and a key player behind the development of the What A Cartoon! shorts for Cartoon Network.

CBS Television, which pulled out of animation programming with its' live-action-filled Saturday morning slate for the 1997/98 season, has announced a bold move to return to animated programming. The network has signed an unprecedented, two-year deal with Canadian animation producer NELVANA Limited, wherein NELVANA will produce six animated series for CBS' Saturday morning block starting in fall 1998. CBS' Saturday morning block has received consistently low ratings as a result of competition from cable outlets such as Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network, and from studio-affiliated networks such as ABC /Disney and Fox Kids/Saban. \"With this schedule, we are renewing our commitment to programming that meets the dual challenge of meeting the FCC educational requirements and capturing the interest of children,\" said Lucy Johnson, senior vice president of Daytime/Children's Programming and Special Projects at CBS. It is rare for a network to buy a whole block of programming from one supplier, especially from an international one. Toper Taylor, president of NELVANA Communications, said that this precedent-setting deal could up the ante for American independent producers who have traditionally supplied networks with programming. \"This is an enormous step for international independent companies to get a foothold in the international marketplace.\" All six shows will meet FCC educational requirements, and are being co-financed by Nelvana's multiple international co-production partners. Franklin, (7:00) which follows the adventures of a cherubic turtle, is based on a series of books by Paulette Bourgeois and currently airs on The Family Channel in Canada. Anatole, (7:30) the story of a Parisian mouse and his family, is based on a book series by Eve Titus, and will teach kids about diversity. The Dumb Bunnies, (8:00) based on Dav Pikey's book series, is a comedy about a family of naive rabbits, that will teach kids about logical reasoning. From the Files of the Flying Rhinoceros, (11:00) based on books by Ray Nelson and Douglas Kelly, will be produced in association with Big Daddy Productions. Guardians of the Legend (11:30) is an action series about mythological stories, based on the Myth Men book series by Laura Geringer. The one show not based on books is Birdz, (8:30) a comedy about a family of birds.\n\nConvulsion-Causing Cartoons. On December 16, 1997 in Japan, hundreds of people, mostly children, simultaneously suffered seizures while watching an episode of the animated series Pokemon (Pocket Monsters). The highest-rated show in its weekly 6:30 p.m. time slot, Pokemon is watched by millions of children on the television network TV Tokyo. Japanese media reported more than 700 viewers experienced convulsions, vomiting, fainting and other symptoms which seem to have been triggered by a scene about 20 minutes into the half-hour episode in which a character's eyes flashed repeatedly and a bright red explosion filled the screen. The phenomenon medically referred to as \"television epilepsy\" or \"photosensitive epilepsy\" can be caused by strobes or flashing lights and has been attributed to similar reactions to some video game graphics. The series Pokemon is based on a Nintendo Game Boy video game called Pocket Monsters. Nintendo, aware of previous epileptic reactions to video games, issues a health warning on all of its software. Broadcaster TV Tokyo offered an on-air apology and issued a health warning for the series, and is studying other episodes as a precaution. \"Pokemon\" show producers Shogakukan Production Co. were surprised by the incident because similar effects have been used in previous episodes, without this viewer reaction. Investigations into the incident are being conducted by Tokyo Police, The Health and Welfare Ministry, The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and a panel of experts assigned by TV Tokyo.\n\nHome Video\n\nMickey Loves Minnie. © Disney.\n\nDisney's February Flicks.

The films, Ginger Nutt's Christmas Circus, Ginger Nutt's Forest Dragon, Ginger Nutt's Bee Bother, It's A Lovely Day, The House Cat, The Australian Platypus, The Cuckoo and The Ostrich and the Lion were produced by David Hand, who became one of Walt Disney's first staff animators in 1930, working on films such as Snow White, Bambi and several Silly Symphonies shorts. In 1944, he left Disney and moved to England where he established GB Animation, where he produced the Animaland and Musical Paintbox series for J. Arthur Rank.
