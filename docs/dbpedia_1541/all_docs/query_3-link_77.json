My experience spans the 2D and 3D production pipelines with a focus in character driven comedies for Adult Sitcoms, Kids and Family and Preschool/Bridge. Along the way, I returned to Calarts to teach story at the sophomore level for a few years before turning my focus to my family and career. I was nominated for an Emmy in special achievement for \"Phineas and Ferb\" and just recently won an Annie Award for \"Best TV/Media Pre-School\" for my Co-EP role on Sanjay Patel's series \"Ghee Happy!\" I am currently in development on an adult animated sitcom for NETFLIX and having a blast!"
