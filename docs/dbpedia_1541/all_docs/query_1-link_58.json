Comedy Central has decided the cancel their animated comedy Brickleberry after three seasons on the air.\n\nBrickleberry revolves around a group of dysfunctional park rangers at a second-tier national park. The voice cast includes Natasha Leggero, Tom Kenny, Dave Herman, Jerry Minor, Roger Black and Daniel Tosh.\n\nThe series debuted in 2010 and ended up winning its timeslot in male viewers 18-24 for its first two seasons. The third season concluded in November, wrapping a 32 episode run.\n\n3/22 update: Contrary to previous reports, the third season has not finished. There are three episodes remaining (bringing the series tally to 35 episodes). They will air March 31st, April 7th, and April 14th at 10:30pm.\n\nWhat do you think? Did you like the Brickleberry TV show? Do you think it should have been cancelled or renewed for a fourth season?"
