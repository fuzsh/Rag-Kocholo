He then gained an internship on an animated feature, The Pagemaster, and moved on as an Assistant Animator on the film Cat's Don't Dance. While there, he sold a pilot to then President of Hanna-Barbera, Fred Seibert, for the What a Cartoon series titled "Godfrey and Zeek". This transitioned into doing story work for Hanna-Barbera's other series, Johnny Bravo.
