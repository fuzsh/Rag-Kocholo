In 1997, Werner Herzog was in Tokyo to direct an opera. His hosts asked him, Whom would you like to meet? He replied instantly: Hiroo Onoda. Onoda was a former solider famous for having quixotically defended an island in the Philippines for decades after World War II, unaware the fighting was over. Herzog and Onoda developed an instant rapport and would meet many times, talking for hours and together unraveling the story of Onoda's long war. At the end of 1944, on Lubang Island in the Philippines, with Japanese troops about to withdraw, Lieutenant Hiroo Onoda was given orders by his superior officer: Hold the island until the Imperial army's return. You are to defend its territory by guerrilla tactics, at all costs. . . . There is only one rule. You are forbidden to die by your own hand. In the event of your capture by the enemy, you are to give them all the misleading information you can. So began Onoda's long campaign, during which he became fluent in the hidden language of the jungle. Soon weeks turned into months, months into years, and years into decades—until eventually time itself seemed to melt away. All the while Onoda continued to fight his fictitious war, at once surreal and tragic, at first with other soldiers, and then, finally, alone, a character in a novel of his own making. In The Twilight World, Herzog immortalizes and imagines Onoda's years of absurd yet epic struggle in an inimitable, hypnotic style—part documentary, part poem, and part dream—that will be instantly recognizable to fans of his films. The result is a novel completely unto itself, a sort of modern-day Robinson Crusoe tale: a glowing, dancing meditation on the purpose and meaning we give our lives.\" — Provided by publisher.

Exiled for his own survival as a teenager, Elijah walks west to the Nebraska plains—and, like other rootless young African-American men of that era, joins up with the US cavalry. The trajectory of Elijah's army career parallels the nation's imperial adventures in the late 19th century: subduing Native Americans in the West, quelling rebellion in the Philippines. Haunted by the terrors endured by black Americans and by his part in persecuting other people of color, Elijah is sustained only by visions, memories, prayers, and his questing spirit—which ultimately finds a home when his troop is posted to the newly created Yosemite National Park in 1903. Here, living with little beyond mountain light, running water, campfires, and stars, he becomes a man who owns himself completely, while knowing he's left pieces of himself scattered along his life's path like pebbles on a creek bed.\" — Provided by publisher.

For centuries, the Vikings have swept out of the Norse countries and fallen on whatever lands they could reach aboard their longships, and few could resist the power of their violent onslaught. They came at first to plunder, and then to settle, an encroachment fiercely resisted where ever they went. Such was the case in the southern lands of Ireland. En route to the Viking longphort there, known as Dubh-linn, Thorgrim Night Wolf and Ornolf the Restless stumble across an Irish ship that carries aboard it a single item: a crown. The Vikings eagerly snatch the prize, unaware of its significance to the people of Ireland and the power granted to the king who wears it. Soon the Norsemen are plunged into the violence and intrigue of Medieval Ireland, where local kings fight with each other and with the invaders from the north for rule of the island nation. With enemies at every hand, and loyalties as fickle as the weather, Thorgrim must lead his men, the white invaders, the Fin Gall, in the fight of their lives, with both Irish and Dane eager to see them dead.\" — Provided by publisher.

In the few weeks that he and his parents had been in Pasadena Johnny had made few acquaintances and no friends; in his lonesome little life the radio had opened the door to a magnificent new world. People played music for him to listen to and they told him, play-by-play, what was happening in the big league games. Seated on the edge of the bed, he clutched the little set in both hands. This radio had been the only gift that could be afforded for his ninth birthday and already Johnny McGuire seemed old enough to understand why. He knew that life wasn't always fair, that there was little money to spend, that sometimes his father was angry, often afraid. This is the story, as only John Ball could tell it, of what happens when an older, bigger boy steals Johnny's proudest possession and Johnny sets out to even the score using his father's .38 Colt revolver. Told against the scene of black-white conflict in Pasadena, between poor whites and black militants, between rich whites and poor whites, and the highly topical and urgent problem of gun control, Johnny Get Your Gun is first-rate suspense. It is the chilling story of Johnny's adventures with his gun and of a murder and how the murder is solved by John Ball's cool, brilliant black homicide detective Virgil Tibbs, hero of In the Heat of the Night and The Cool Cottontail. There are riots, brutalities, an action-packed chase through Disneyland, and a heartwarming and heartbreaking scene at the end of the book in the baseball park of the California Angels. Perhaps the most important issue, described with sincerity and sensitivity by John Ball, is the terror and confusion in the mind of a nine-year-old boy—frightened, alone, hurt by the hatred around him, a fugitive from justice. Johnny Get Your Gun\n\ntouches on some of the most urgent problems facing America today, and is told by one of America's most accomplished storytellers. John Ball is most recently author of Miss One Thousand Spring Blossoms, hailed by the Chicago Tribune as \"a very funny and tender story of what happens when East meets West,\" as well as author of In the Heat of the Night, made into a screenplay which won the Academy Award for best picture of 1967.\" — Provided by publisher.

Summer is busy season for Mackenzie \"Mac\" Almeida's bicycle shop, nestled in the quaint, seaside hamlet of Westham, Massachusetts. She's expecting an influx of tourists at Mac's Bikes; instead she discovers the body of Jake Lacey. Mac can't imagine anyone stabbing the down-on-his-luck handyman. However, the authorities seem to think Mac is a strong suspect after she was spotted arguing with Jake just hours before his death. Mac knows she didn't do it, but she does recognize the weapon—her brother Derrick's fishing knife. Mac's only experience with murder investigations is limited to the cozy mysteries she reads with her local book group, the Cozy Capers. So to clear her name—and maybe her brother's too—Mac will have to summon help from her Cozy Capers coinvestigators and a library's worth of detectives' tips and tricks.

Everyone from Wakarusa, Indiana, remembers the infamous case of January Jacobs, who was discovered in a ditch hours after her family awoke to find her gone. Margot Davies was six at the time, the same age as January—and they were next-door neighbors. In the twenty years since, Margot has grown up, moved away, and become a big-city journalist. But she's always been haunted by the feeling that it could've been her. And the worst part is, January's killer has never been brought to justice. When Margot returns home to help care for her uncle after he is diagnosed with early-onset dementia, she feels like she's walked into a time capsule. Wakarusa is exactly how she remembers—genial, stifled, secretive. Then news breaks about five-year-old Natalie Clark from the next town over, who's gone missing under circumstances eerily similar to January's. With all the old feelings rushing back, Margot vows to find Natalie and to solve January's murder once and for all. But the police, Natalie's family, the townspeople—they all seem to be hiding something. And the deeper Margot digs into Natalie's disappearance, the more resistance she encounters, and the colder January's case feels. Could January's killer still be out there? Is it the same person who took Natalie? And what will it cost to finally discover what truly happened that night twenty years ago?
