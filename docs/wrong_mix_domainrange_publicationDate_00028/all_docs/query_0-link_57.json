        "text": "Voted one of the top 10 comedians in New York City by The Hollywood Reporter, Modi is one of the comedy circuit’s most sought after performers. Featured on HBO, CBS, NBC, ABC, Comedy Central, Howard Stern, and E! Entertainment, Modi has received rave reviews in The New York Times, Time Out NY and The New York Post.\n\nBorn in Tel Aviv, Israel, Modi emigrated with his family to the United States at the age of seven and was raised on Long Island. After graduating from Boston University, he worked as an investment banker until his first open-mic night made him realize that stand-up was his true calling. Equipped with a sharp wit and a knack for reading an audience, Modi has gone on to become a successful fixture in New York's vibrant comedy scene, often doing bits that incorporate his heritage, and he is a hit with diverse Jewish audiences as well as fans of all backgrounds and beliefs.\n\nNow a regular performer at the New York and Los Angeles comedy clubs, Modi also headlines around the country and across the globe. He is a co-founder of The Chosen Comedy Festival, a celebration of Jewish humor that was launched in 2022. The festival features diverse comedy acts and has brought laughter to thousands of people in NYC, Miami, Los Angeles, and more.\n\nModi has played himself on HBO's Crashing and Netflix's When Jews Were Funny. He's also appeared in several feature films and played leading roles in two: Waiting for Woody Allen, which won the LA Film Festival, and Stand Up, a feature-length film. In 2018, Mayor Bill De Blasio declared June 26th 'Mordechi Modi Rosenfeld Day' in the city of New York for his accomplishments and contributions to the artistic community.\n\nManagement reserves the right to prevent customers from entering the facility who they deem disruptive or dangerous to other patrons.\n\nAlex Falcone is currently the only comedian and writer living in Los Angeles, but he started out in the great city of Portland where he performed for many years, eventually winning Portland's Funniest Person in 2018. He even got a Salt & Straw flavor named after him, which is just one of many things he has in common with The Rock.\n\nHe appeared in several episodes of Portlandia as one of Fred's nerdy friends and he recently made his late night debut on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. He's also the author of a young-adult romance novel about a mummy called Unwrap My Heart that Publisher’s Weekly called \"unfortunate.\"\n\nDespite these modest accomplishments, he's somehow remained down to earth and approachable.\n\nManagement reserves the right to prevent customers from entering the facility who they deem disruptive or dangerous to other patrons.\n\nStand-up comic, actor, and Emmy-nominated writer Sam Jay can currently be seen as the host of HBO’s Pause with Sam Jay, a weekly late-night series on which she also served as executive producer. Sam’s next stand-up special, Sam Jay: Salute Me or Shoot Me, will premiere on HBO on September 23rd.\n\nShe can currently be seen in her stand-out role opposite Jonah Hill, Eddie Murphy, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus in the Kenya Barris-directed feature film, You People, now streaming on Netflix. She can also be seen on the Peacock series Bust Down, which she co-created with co-stars Langston Kerman, Jak Knight, and Chris Redd. Sam is a two-time Emmy nominee and WGA award nominee for her writing on Saturday Night Live. In 2018, she wrote for The 70th Primetime Emmy Awards and the MTV Movie & TV Awards, and in 2020 she wrote for the BET Awards. Sam was named as one of Variety’s 10 Comics to Watch in 2018, and a Comedy Central Comic to Watch in 2015.\n\nEarlier this year, Sam was named a BET Her Awards Pride Honoree. Sam was recently featured both on and off camera as the “Voice of God” announcer at the 2022 74th Primetime Emmy Awards on NBC. Earlier in the same year, Sam recorded a set as part of Netflix’s Stand Out: An LGBTQ+ Celebration, along with Margaret Cho, Sandra Bernhard, Billy Eichner, and Eddie Izzard—now streaming on Netflix. In 2020, Sam debuted her first one-hour stand-up special Sam Jay: 3 in the Morning on Netflix. In 2019, Sam made her Netflix debut on The Comedy Lineup and released her album Donna’s Daughter through Comedy Central Records. In 2017, Sam was a standout of the Just For Laughs: New Faces showcase; made her late-night debut on ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel Live!; and released her Comedy Central Presents half hour to rave reviews. Sam has performed internationally at comedy clubs and festivals including the Vodafone Dublin Comedy Festival, Bumbershoot Festival, 208 Comedy Festival, New York Comedy Festival, Portland’s Bridgetown Festival, The Laugh Your Asheville Off Comedy Festival, Boston’s Women In Comedy Festival, among others.\n\nSam’s TV credits include her hosting role on Ricking Morty, the Rick and Morty post-show on Adult Swim.\n\nAdditional TV credits include The Eric Andre Show; HBO Max’s That Damn Michael Che; MTV’s SafeWord; a recurring role on TV Land’s Nobodies; Starz’s Take My Wife, Comedy Central’s White Flight, Crank Yankers, The Meltdown with Jonah and Kumail, and Broad City; and Viceland’s Party Legends and Flophouse.\n\nSam is originally from Boston and currently resides in New York.\n\nManagement reserves the right to prevent customers from entering the facility who they deem disruptive or dangerous to other patrons.\n\nZack Johnson has been labeled \"THE COOLEST JERK.\" He's a quick witted, sarcastic yet very funny comic from Rochester N.Y. He tours colleges & clubs all over the US & Canada, most recently on the Canada vs USA Comedy Tour & the Just For Laughs Comedy Festival. He recently had his network television debut on Comedy Central on Kevin Hart's Hart of the City & Netflix Kevin Hart's series Don't F*&k This Up!

He is a regular at The Comedy Cellar, The Stand Comedy Club and Stand Up New York. A staple in the New York Comedy Podcast scene he can be heard on The Legion of Skanks, You Know What Dude, Are You Garbage? and Matt and Shane's Secret Podcast. He launched The Colum Tyrrell Podcast in 2022 which is growing to be one of the more popular shows in New York and he recently made his television debut on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.\n\nManagement reserves the right to prevent customers from entering the facility who they deem disruptive or dangerous to other patrons.\n\nAuthor, columnist, and comedian Steve Hofstetter is often called the hardest working man in show-business. With all due respect to the late James Brown.\n\nHofstetter's national TV debut came on ESPN's Quite Frankly, where Stephen A. Smith yelled at him for three minutes. Hofstetter has also appeared on CBS' \"Late Late Show With Craig Ferguson\", Showtime's \"White Boyz in the Hood\", VH1's \"Countdown\", Sundance's \"On the Road in America\", and ABC's \"Barbara Walter's Special\", where he thankfully did not cry. He is the host and executive producer of \"Laughs\" on Fox networks, where he only cries occasionally.\n\nOne of the top booked acts on the college circuit, the original writer for collegehumor.com has also released six albums. Hofstetter has written humor columns for the New York Times, SportsIllustrated.com, and NHL.com, where he publicly admitted to being a Ranger fan.\n\nAfter hosting Four Quotas on Sirius Satellite Radio for two seasons, Hofstetter moved to broadcast radio, and his Sports Minute (Or So) was syndicated on over 170 stations and in over 30 newspapers. Hofstetter's second live comedy album (\"Cure For the Cable Guy\") reached #20 on Billboard's comedy charts. His third album (\"Dark Side of the Room\") was the first ever pay-what-you-want\" comedy album, since people were going to steal it anyway. His fourth album consisted of an hour of 100% ad-libbed material, which is, frankly, nuts. And his fifth album hit #1 on iTunes' comedy charts, which is also a bit nuts.\n\nHofstetter's brutal tour schedule consists of over 100 colleges and dozens of clubs every year, and is fueled by an immense online popularity, tons of press, and a Prius with great gas mileage. He reached 200,000 friends on Facebook (still the world record), 400,000 more on MySpace, and high shelves in grocery stores.\n\nWhile Hofstetter's live shows are routinely sold out, he is best known for his writing, first published at age 15, mainly to impress girls. At 18, he co-founded \"Sports Jerk of the Week\", an irreverent website featured by press like USA Today's Baseball Weekly, Sports Illustrated and CNN. And at 20, Hofstetter took a year off of school to head up web content for the New York Yankees. The Yankees won the World Series that year, which would have been wonderful if they hadn't beaten Hofstetter's Mets. Yes, he's also a Mets fan. Poor kid.\n\nWhile an undergraduate at Columbia University, Hofstetter was a well-read columnist for the Columbia Daily Spectator and a voice of the Lions. After a summer writing for Maxim, ESPN, and Sports Illustrated for Kids, Hofstetter syndicated his column in several newspapers.\n\nWithout his glasses, Hofstetter also looks a great deal like Michael Rappaport.\n\nManagement reserves the right to prevent customers from entering the facility who they deem disruptive or dangerous to other patrons."
