        "text": "American writer and psychologist\n\nLawrence M. Schoen (born July 27, 1959) is an American author, publisher, psychologist, hypnotist, and expert in the Klingon language.[1][2]\n\nSchoen was born in Chicago, Illinois, but his family moved to Southern California when he was 18 months old, and he grew up in Culver City.[3]\n\nIn 1983, he graduated with B.S. in psycholinguistics from California State University, Northridge, having designed his own major, and then moved on to Kansas State University where he earned his M.S. and Ph.D. in psychology. In graduate school, Schoen's research focused on cognitive psychology and psycholinguistics.[3]\n\nDoctorate in hand, he spent the next ten years in academia as an assistant professor at New College of Florida, Lake Forest College in Illinois, and Chestnut Hill College in Pennsylvania. He then moved to the private sector and served for about 17 years as the director of research and analytics for a medical center which provides mental health and addiction treatment service works throughout Philadelphia.[4]\n\nIn August 2019, Schoen was diagnosed with multiple myeloma and began treatment. The following January, he underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant and entered a new regimen of chemotherapy. As of February 2021, he was in remission.\n\nSchoen lives in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania.[3]\n\nSchoen attended the 1998 session of James E. Gunn's two-week Writers' Workshop in Science Fiction on the campus of the University of Kansas.[5] In 2010, he participated in Walter Jon Williams' two-week master class, the Taos Toolbox.\n\nHe has been nominated for the Astounding Award for Best New Writer, the Hugo Award for Best Short Story, the Nebula Award for Best Novella three times,[6][7][8] as well as receiving nominations for both the Nebula Award for Best Novel[9] and the Cóyotl Award for Best Novel.[10]\n\nSome of his more notable works as an author include the Amazing Conroy series of science fiction stories and novels, the first of which appeared in 2001,[11] about a space-traveling stage hypnotist and his alien companion animal (a \"buffalito\") that can consume anything and farts oxygen. Among these, the short story \"Yesterday's Taste\"[12] and the novellas Barry's Tale (2012),[13] Trial of the Century (2013),[14] and Calendrical Regression (2015)[15] have received award nominations.\n\nSchoen appeared at Book Expo America in May 2015, where he was presented as one of four authors described by Tor Books as the next generation of science fiction and fantasy, based on his novel Barsk: The Elephants' Graveyard, anthropomorphic SF that explores prophecy, intolerance, political betrayal, and a drug that lets one talk to the dead.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2018, he was part of the staff at Orson Scott Card's InterGalactic Medicine Show as Reprint Editor, replacing Darrell Schweitzer as the magazine's interviewer.\n\nSchoen founded the Klingon Language Institute[16] and has published Klingon translations of William Shakespeare's plays Hamlet (The Klingon Hamlet, ISBN 978-0671035785) and Much Ado About Nothing (ISBN 978-1587155017), as well as the Epic of Gilgamesh (ISBN 978-1587153389) and the Tao Te Ching (ISBN 978-0964434523). In the realm of Klingon nonfiction, Schoen edited and published The Grammarian's Desk (978-0964434530), a collection of essays written by Captain Krankor (Rich Yampell). He also served as the editor of HolQeD (ISSN 1061-2327), the quarterly journal of the KLI, for the entirety of its 13-year run. He was featured in Director Alexandre O. Philippe's documentary about the Klingon Language Institute, Earthlings: Ugly Bags of Mostly Water (2004).[17] In 2011, he produced a daily Klingon language podcast called DaHjaj Hol.[18] (See Klingon Language Institute#Publications and translations.)\n\nSchoen is the publisher and chief editor for Paper Golem, a speculative fiction small press started in November, 2006. The first book it published was Prime Codex, an anthology of previously published stories by members of the Codex Writers Group, of which Schoen is a founding member.[19] Paper Golem is Schoen's vehicle for \"paying it forward,\" and focuses on two mains tracks: publishing single author collections by relatively new authors (e.g., Cat Rambo in 2009, Eric James Stone in 2011), and the Alembical series, which produces anthologies of original novellas (J. Kathleen Cheney's novella \"Iron Shoes\", from Alembical 2, received a nomination for the Nebula Award).[20]\n\nIn 2013, Schoen took a page from one of his fictional creations and became certified as a hypnotherapist by the International Association of Professional Conversational Hypnotists (IAPCH), with the intention of developing materials to aid other writers grappling with problems common to their field (e.g., writer's block).[21]\n\nBarsk: The Elephants' Graveyard (Dec 2015), Tor Books (ISBN 9780765377036) Nebula Award Finalist,[22] Cóyotl Award Winner.[23]\n\nThe Moons of Barsk (Aug 2018), Tor Books (ISBN 9780765394637) Cóyotl Award Winner.[24]\n\nExcerpts of Jorl ben Tral (March 2020) Paper Golem LLC (ISBN 978-1951391157).\n\nSoup of the Moment (September 2020), Paper Golem LLC (ISBN 1951391357) Cóyotl Award Finalist.[25]\n\nIn chronological story order:[26]\n\nBuffalito Bundle, (Book 1) [27] (July 2019) Paper Golem LLC (ISBN 0-9819-2434-4)\n\nBuffalo Dogs, (Summer 2001) in Absolute Magnitude #16 and also appeared in Buffalogic, Inc.: Tales of the Amazing Conroy #1, SRM Publisher (ISBN 0-9722-4732-7)\n\nBuffalogenesis (2006), in Buffalogenesis: Tales of the Amazing Conroy #2, SRM Publisher (ISBN 0-9776-6393-0)\n\nA Buffalito Of Mars, (2007) ) in Visual Journeys: A Tribute to Space Artists, Hadley Rille Books (ISBN 0-9785-1483-1)\n\nRequiem, (2005) in Absolute Magnitude and also appeared in Buffalogistics: Tales of the Amazing Conroy #3, SRM Publisher (ISBN 0-9776-6399-X)\n\nMind Din, (July 2019) first printed in Buffalito Bundle (see Omnibus Editions)\n\nTelepathic Intent, (2003) in Buffalogic, Inc.: Tales of the Amazing Conroy #1, SRM Publisher (ISBN 0-9722-4732-7)\n\nThe Matter At Hand, (2008) in Buffalogistics: Tales of the Amazing Conroy #3, SRM Publisher (ISBN 0-9776-6399-X)\n\nYesterdays Taste, (October 2011) in Transtories, Aeon Press (ISBN 1-8725-8821-2) WSFA Small Press Award Finalist[28]\n\nBarry's Tale (Book 2) [27] (December 2012) in Buffalito Buffet, Hadley Rille Books (ISBN 0-9849-6708-7) Nebula Award Finalist 2012[29]\n\nCalendrical Regression (Book 3) [27] (November 2014), Noble Fusion Press (ISBN 0-9915-0013-X) Nebula Award Finalist 2014 [30]\n\nBarry's Deal (Book 4) [27] (November 2017), Noble Fusion Press (ISBN 0-9915-0017-2) Nebula Award Finalist 2017[31]\n\nBuffalito Destiny (Book 5) [27] (June 2009) Hadley Rille Books (ISBN 0-9819-2434-4)\n\nTrial of the Century (Book 6) [27] (December 2013), in World Jumping, Hadley Rille Books (ISBN 0-9892-6317-7) Nebula Award Finalist 2013[32]\n\nBuffalito Contingency (Book 7) [27] (July 2011) Hadley Rille Books (ISBN 0-9829-4677-5)\n\nBuffalito Bundle (July 2019) Paper Golem LLC (ISBN 978-1732634350) An omnibus edition of all the stories leading up to and including “Yesterdays Taste” i.e. Buffalo Dogs, Buffalogenesis, A Buffalito Of Mars, Requiem, Mind Din, Telepathic Intent, The Matter At Hand and Yesterdays Taste.\n\nBuffalito Buffet (December 2012) Hadley Rille Books (ISBN 978-0984967094).
