The massive public works projects of the federal government provided direct relief for citizens hungry for work, under the auspices of the Civilian Conservation Corps and other programs of the Works Progress Administration.\n\nIn the Pacific Northwest, public works projects included the development of the Columbia River Basin. Locally, men from the Civilian Conservation Corps, known as the \"Tree Army,\" planted millions of trees and constructed roadways and buildings still in use today. Here you will find a list of just a few special places.\n\nWorld War II brought an end to the CCC, as the nation, and especially the West Coast, responded to the war overseas. There's plenty of evidence of World War II right here. Here are a few locations of interest if you want to know more about the war at home.\n\nMany of these sites are just now being developed for travelers interested in a tour of history. Please \"Tread Lightly\" and remember that the removal of objects and artifacts on public lands is strictly forbidden.\n\nTread Lightly is like the \"Leave No Trace\" ethic of the hiker. It means that you provide the next user the same experience that you enjoyed by staying on the trail, picking up litter, practicing trail courtesy and respecting public as well as private property. It's a small but thoughtful price to pay for the well being of our outdoor environment!\n\nPlaces to Go\n\nCivilian Conservation Corps Projects\n\n1.
