        "text": "6. Kimball State Park\n\nLocation:\n\nKimball State Park is located on Oregon Road 232, off of Highway 62 on the way to Ft. Klamath and Crater Lake. The park lies 3 miles northeast of Fort Klamath, and 39 miles north of Klamath Falls.\n\nHabitat:\n\nLodgepole pine forest, rocky hillsides with clear water springs which form the headwaters of the Wood River.\n\nDistinct Features:\n\nJ. F. Kimball State Park is a pristine site located at the headwaters of the Wood River. Kimball Park offers primitive camping and a walking trail along the stream. This stream flows from the pine forest into open meadow land laced with picturesque quaking aspen surrounded by the southern Cascade Mountains.\n\nBirds to Look For:\n\nWood Duck, Common Merganser, Ruffed Grouse, Northern Pygmy-Owl, Northern Saw-whet Owl, Belted Kingfisher, Olive-sided Flycatcher, Solitary and Warbling Vireos, Townsend's Warbler, Spotted and Green-tailed Towhees, Fox Sparrow, Dark-eyed Junco, Cassin's Finch, Red Crossbill, Pine Siskin, many warbler species, Western Tanager, Red-breasted Nuthatch, Brown Creeper, American Dipper, Pacific-slope/Cordilleran Flycatcher, Steller's Jay, and Varied Thrush. The lucky birder may be rewarded with hearing, and perhaps spotting a Pileated Woodpecker. With careful observation several other woodpecker species may be observed in the park as well.\n\nDirections:\n\nFrom Klamath Falls travel north on Highway 97 for approximately 21 miles. Watch for road signs to Crater Lake National Park. Turn left on to Highway 62, continue for 12 miles to Sun Mountain Road. Turn onto Sun Mountain Road which continues northerly as Highway 62 makes a sharp 90 degree turn toward the west (left). Look for the state park shield on road signs. GPS: 121° 59' 11.35\" W, 42° 44' 26.21\" N.\n\nFor more information Contact:\n\nChiloquin Ranger District\n\n38500 Highway 97 North\n\nChiloquin, OR 97624\n\n541-783-4001\n\nCollier Memorial State Park\n\n46000 Highway 97 N\n\nChiloquin, OR 97624\n\nPhone: (541) 783-2471\n\nWeb info:\n\nwww.oregonstateparks.org/park_229.php\n\nNavigation:\n\nYou are here: Home > Birding Sites > Trail Map > 6.
