        "text": "Collier Memorial State Park\n\nLooking for a Hotel near Collier Memorial State Park? Visit Maverick Motel\n\nCollier Memorial State Park features a campground; outdoor museum of historic logging equipment; relocated pioneer village; and a new four-corral, primitive horse camp and trailhead. At the state's finest logging museum, you'll see rare and antique logging equipment dating to the 1880s, as well as more recent pieces. Railroad buffs will enjoy learning about the role the railroad played in logging. The pioneer village gives you insight into how these families once lived. The Williamson River and crystal-clear Spring Creek converge in the park. The Williamson River is regionally famous for its quality trout fishery and it consistently produces trophy fish. From the equestrian trailhead, you can ride north from the park across national forest land to the Jackson F. Kimball State Recreation Site and beyond.\n\n(Collier Memorial State Park Website)"
