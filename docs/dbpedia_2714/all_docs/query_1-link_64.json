        "text": "Press release by Oregon State Parks\n\nThe devastating wildfires that continue to level the Oregon landscape have so far burned about 900 acres of state park land, most of it undeveloped forest, the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department (OPRD) reports.\n\nSome parks remain closed due to windstorm damage, or their proximity to active fires. Twenty-four parks have been closed since Sep. 7, when rare, severe wind events caused wildfires to quickly sweep the landscape. Go to https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=visit.status to check park status.\n\nGiven the scope and severity of the fires, the 900-acre toll was a testament to both luck and extraordinary first responders, said OPRD Director Lisa Sumption.\n\nThe heavily forested Collier Memorial State Park took the biggest hit, losing some 400 acres of Ponderosa Pines. OPRD Forester Craig Leech said that “although 400 acres is a lot by any estimation, the careful fuel reduction and stand improvement slowed the fire spread enough to be contained before major damage occurred.\n\nDetroit Lake State Recreation Area and the Mongold day-use area on the lake suffered only minor damage from the Beachie Creek Fire. Local authorities, the Oregon Marine Board and emergency responders are working together to help safely retrieve boats that people had to abandon on the lake when they evacuated.\n\nNearby, North Santiam State Recreation Area suffered far worse damage. The fire burned straight through the small campground on the North Santiam River.\n\nSeveral parks in the Willamette Valley and on the north coast are serving as evacuation sites, some in partnership with the American Red Cross. We are happy to help provide a temporary landing place for those whose lives have been uprooted by this wildfire disaster,” said OPRD director Lisa Sumption. “We are looking forward to restoring and reopening our closed parks as soon as is safely possible.”\n\nOPRD staff are assessing damage and scheduling repairs, where conditions allow. In many cases, fires are still burning near parks, evacuation orders are still in place and air quality remains unhealthy. OPRD asks the public to stay out of closed parks as restoration and recovery efforts take place.\n\n“We are still very much in the emergency response mode. We will have more information to share about restoring and reopening damaged parks once it is safe for our staff to do so,” said OPRD Communications Director Jason Resch.\n\nA complete list of closed parks is on our Fire Information Page. Please keep in mind that damage is still being evaluated.\n\nSilver Falls\n\n125 acres burned on the SE part of the park. Contained at this time.\n\nDetroit Lake State Recreation Area\n\nMinor damage along some campground loops closer to the highway.\n\nLoss of one water storage tank.\n\n40 acres burned.\n\nNorth Santiam State Recreation Area\n\n120 acres burned.\n\nLoss of some structures.\n\nBonnie Lure State Recreation Area\n\n40 acres burned.\n\nCollier Memorial State Park\n\n400 acres burned.\n\nDamage to historic museum and some equipment.\n\nLoss of one historic cabin, woodshed, and host trailer.\n\nWallowa Lake State Park\n\nWind damage to dock.\n\nDevil’s Lake State Park\n\nNo fire damage, but many trees down.\n\nOther coastal parks with trees down include Munson Creek Falls State Natural Site, Sitka Sedge State Natural Area, Cape Lookout State Park, Beverly Beach State Park, William M. Tugman, and many areas of the Oregon Coast Trail are reported to have trees down as well.\n\nMany parks remain open, but still could be experiencing poor air quality. Some major highways and roads used to access parks are closed."
