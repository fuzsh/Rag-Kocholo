        "text": "Thereâs something special about looking to the dark night sky on a clear summer evening. When the clouds part, you may be treated to a dizzying area of celestial wondersâtwinkling stars, meteor showers, far-off planets, and even the broader reaches of the Milky Way.\n\nFortunately, itâs easy to enjoy these sites across Klamath County. Our region is blissfully devoid of light pollutionâsuch as the glare emitted from cities and street lightsâthat might otherwise wash out the pristine sky. Not just that, but plenty of public lands make it easy to pitch a tent, park your RV, or book a cabin and enjoy wide-open views in solitude.\n\nYou donât even need a telescope to get startedâjust your sense of wonder and the ability to stay up late enough for the sun to set and the sky to fully darken. A mobile app that shows constellations and helps you identify the skyâs many features doesnât hurt, either. So as you plan your next visit, here are the top five places to go stargazing around Klamath County.\n\nâ\n\nCrater Lake National Park is beloved for any number of reasons: The 33-mile Rim Drive offers sweeping views of the deepest lake in the United States, numerous hiking trails head high above the lakeâs rim, and boat tours take you onto the lakeâs surface for an up-close look at its size and beauty.\n\nBut not all the parkâs adventures are best enjoyed in the daytime. Crater Lake is one of Klamath Countyâs best stargazing destinationsâwith little light pollution, a high elevation (more than 6,000 feet above sea level), and almost no cloud cover all summer long. If you decide to stargaze from a pullout along Rim Drive, youâll be at the tree line, as wellâwith no obstructions blocking the views above.Â\n\nReady to plan your summertime visit? Learn more about the 10 best things to do at Crater Lake National Park.\n\nLake of the Woods sits deep in the heart of the Cascade Rangeânearly 40 miles from Klamath Falls and almost totally unencumbered by light pollution. That remote locationâalong with plenty of opportunities for overnight staysâmakes the mountain lake an ideal spot to stargaze.\n\nBook your stay at the family-friendly Lake of the Woods Resort, which hosts dozens of charming cabins and manages two forested campgrounds near its namesake reservoir. The resort lies along the lakeâs eastern shore, providing easy access for unobstructed viewsâwith Mount McLoughlin in the midst of it all.\n\nExcited to visit? See how to plan a summer vacation at Lake of the Woodsâand Klamathâs many other lakes.\n\nCollier Memorial State Park sits along Highway 97 and offers plenty of attractions across its forested groundsâincluding an outdoor logging museum (one of the best family attractions in Klamath), the convergence of two streams, some of Klamath's top fishing holes, and more than 60 spacious campsites.\n\nThe park sits more than 30 miles north of Klamath Falls and is surrounded on all sides by a forest of pine, which makes Collier an idyllic spot to watch the starry skies. Your campsite might be a little shady, but a few flat trails head out to (and follow) Spring Creek and the Williamson Riverâwhere the skies open up and afford memorable views. Its elevation (roughly 4,200 feet above sea level) puts you above denser air and typically translates to clearer night skies, as well.\n\nLearn more about Collier Memorial and other Oregon State Parks around Klamath County.\n\nPart of what makes Jackson F. Kimball State Recreation Site so special is its seclusion: The small campground, with just 10 primitive sites, resides at the headwaters of the Wood River and is about 40 miles from Klamath Fallsâfar from busy highways, cities, street lights, and other common sources of light pollution. That location makes the campground an outstanding place to view the night skies; just follow a short, flat walking trail between your site and the river to get away from the lodgepole pine forest and enjoy a fuller view.Â\n\nGet the skinny on Jackson F. Kimball State Recreation Site, and see why it makes such a great weekend getaway.\n\nAt the southern edge of the Klamath Basin, roughly 40 miles south of Klamath Falls, Lava Beds National Monument boasts some of the darkest night skies across the region. The expansive national monument is surrounded by countless acres of farmland and two national wildlife refuges, limiting light pollution and opening the skies for far-reaching views. Lava Beds' high elevation, at nearly 5,000 feet above sea level, leads to clearer skies, as well.\n\nGiven the national monument's far-flung location, try snagging one of 43 sites at its Indian Well Campgroundâall available on a first-come, first-served basis. Sites run $10 per night and are partially shadedâwhich means you don't have to leave your site to bask in the glow of the cosmos.\n\nOnce youâre there, see why the monumentâs visitor center is one of Klamathâs best museums, and make the most of your experience by exploring 10 must-visit caves at the Lava Beds."
