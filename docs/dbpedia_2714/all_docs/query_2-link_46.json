From the parkâ€™s horse camp and day-use area or from a nearby parking spot, you can access trails within the park, ride along the Williamson River, take forest roads to Kimball State Park and the headwaters of the Wood River, and explore the rimrock on the east side of the highway. In addition to enjoying the nearby trails, you can take advantage of world-class fly fishing on the Williamson River, food and fun at the Kla-Mo-Ya?Casino, and a chance to see old-time logging operations at the Collier Logging Museum."
