        "text": "The latest and most comprehensive coverage of local News, Sports, Business, and Community News stories in the Klamath Basin, Southern Oregon and around the state of Oregon from Wynne Broadcasting’s KFLS News/Talk 1450AM / 102.5FM, The Herald and News, and BasinLife.com, and powered by Mick Insurance, your Local Health and Medicare agents. Call 541-882-6476.\n\nFriday, December 29, 2023\n\nKlamath Basin Weather\n\nToday’s Headlines\n\nKlamath, Jackson and Curry counties have received funding that will bring over $119,000 and 28 electric vehicle charging ports through the Community Charging Rebates program.\n\nThis program is part of the Oregon Department of Transportation’s $100 million commitment to increase EV charging along major roads and within Oregon communities over the next five years.\n\nThe focus was not just on providing rebates but on preparing communities by strategically placing charging stations where they could have the most impact. This included rural tourist destinations, areas with long commutes and locations enticing people to spend time while charging their cars.\n\nThe first round covered $1.75 million in funding. 70% of that funding goes towards projects in disadvantaged and rural communities.\n\nWith more funding rounds anticipated, interested people and organizations were encouraged to keep an eye on future rounds and reach out for assistance during the application process.\n\nThe second round will launch in early March 2024. Anyone who is interested can head over to ODOT’s website.\n\nBullmania hits the Klamath County fairgrounds event center again this New Year’s Eve.\n\nBullmania is part of the official PBR tour. It is co-sponsored by Wynne Broadcasting and KIX 96 Better Country Radio.\n\nThis year’s event features a live instant replay on the big screen, hours of competition of bullriders from all over the country, and an opportunity for a VIP dinner and tickets to meet some of the riders before the show.\n\nAfter the riding, Southern Oregon’s largest balloon drop will take place around midnight and dancing and music will take place with a live band. For ticket information, visit bullmaniaklamathfalls.com.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Klamath County Sheriff’s Office deputies and emergency medical services were dispatched to a reported motor vehicle crash on Sprague River Road near mile marker 4.\n\nA Sheriff’s Office deputy was responding to a disturbance call in the Chiloquin area at the time of the reported crash. It was later confirmed that a vehicle leaving the disturbance was involved in the crash.\n\nInitial investigation reveals that a westbound Dodge Durango, operated by 35 year old Sasha Atchley, was involving a head-on collision with an unloaded (bunked) log truck. The collision occurred in the eastbound lane of Sprague River Rd. The Durango left the roadway and the log truck was blocking the travel lanes when it came to rest.\n\nSasha Lee Atchley was transported to Sky Lakes Medical Center by a Chiloquin Fire and Rescue ambulance crew with serious injuries; she later passed away as a result of injuries sustained in the crash.\n\nThe driver of the log truck was transported to the hospital by a Bonanza Ambulance crew with minor injuries.\n\nThe investigation is underway and is being assisted by the Oregon State Police with a crash reconstruction. No further details are available at this time. (KCSO)\n\nFor the time being, all remains status quo at the Klamath County Sheriff’s Department with the officers which includes Sheriff Chris Kaber’s two sons.\n\nIn a letter to Southern Oregon media yesterday, Sheriff Kaber said:\n\n“Just before 3pm on Tuesday, the Sheriff was informed by Commissioner David Henslee that during the BOCC meeting held the previous Friday a decision had been made to not terminate the employment of Deputy Erick Kaber and Sergeant Ryan Kaber on December 27th. That date was scheduled by Human Resources and the BOCC following their September 27th meeting and is documented by a series of emails and letters received by the deputies informing them of the date their loss of benefits would begin.\n\nThe 90-day ultimatum for either the Sheriff to resign his elected position or his family members law enforcement careers with Klamath County would end, barring a “creative” solution, has been suspended for the time being. During the conversation, there was no indication that the topic wouldn’t be picked up again at a later date by the Board. Later Tuesday afternoon, the two deputies received email confirmation from the Human Resources Director indicating that, “your employment status with Klamath County will not change on December 27, 2023.”\n\nThe Sheriff contends that the Constitution of the State of Oregon, state law, and prior Oregon Attorney General opinions give the Office of Sheriff the sole authority in organizing the office and appointing deputies while the authority of the county board, and by proxy the Human Resources Department, is limited. (Refer to Oregon Revised Statutes 206.210, 204.116, 204.635, 204.601) . The Office of the Sheriff is not a “department” of the county and the Sheriff believes this is an important distinction worth defending for reasons related to the Constitutional protections to the public provided by an elected Sheriff. As a result of this opinion, arbitrary county policies do not govern the employees of the Sheriff’s Office in the same manner as other county employees.\n\nIt does appear that the governing body of the county and their legal team disagrees with this assessment, therefore, the Sheriff intends to pursue a legal resolution to the questions raised by these differing viewpoints”. (KCSO press release)\n\nAfter four years, a trial is set to begin on a $11.75 million federal lawsuit against the city of Klamath Falls next week.\n\nEstimated to cover five days, Cisneros v. City of Klamath Falls is set for trial beginning at 9 a.m. Jan. 8, 2024, in Medford with a pretrial conference taking place in December.\n\nFiled back in 2019, plaintiffs Elizabeth and Antonio Cisneros, former owners of Mexican restaurant El Palacio, alleged that Klamath Falls and the Klamath Falls Police Department (KFPD) at the direction of former KFPD Chief Dave Henslee, former City Manager Nathan Cherpeski and former City Councilor Kendall Bell violated their 14th Amendment equal protection due process constitutional rights by discriminating against them and targeting them for a higher level of law enforcement activity.\n\nThe plaintiffs state in the lawsuit that KFPD, at the direction of Henslee, made patrols of El Palacio, including walk-throughs of the premises and that they were being treated differently from other similarly situated non-Hispanic establishments.\n\nThe city “failed to apply its laws uniformly and has used race as a basis for making these decisions,” the lawsuit claims.\n\nAccording to court documents, the defendants assert they were attempting to address criminal activity within the downtown area arguing that law enforcement incidents were occurring as a result of the Cisneros failing to abate the over-consumption of alcohol at El Palacio.\n\nWhile Klamath Falls did submit an extensive amount of evidence to dispute, presiding Judge Ann Aiken said it is not the court’s role to determine which set of facts is more plausible and that a jury should weigh the evidence and make the determination if the allegations against Klamath Falls are true. (Herald and News)\n\nA Washington man arrested 2021 on drug trafficking charges will serve 60 months in prison and five years post-prison supervision.\n\nDaniel Martin Ponce-Gonzalez, 39, was arrested after law enforcement stopped a black sedan on U.S. Highway 97 in Klamath County.\n\nPonce-Gonzalez was driving and gave the arresting state officers a false name and fake identification.\n\nAccording to a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office District of Oregon, officers recognized signs of drug trafficking during the stop and were given permission by Ponce-Gonzalez to search the vehicle.\n\n“Officers discovered a hidden compartment near the trunk containing more than 55 pounds of methamphetamine and approximately two pounds each of fentanyl pills and cocaine,\n\nBoth Ponce-Gonzalez and his passenger were arrested without incident.\n\nThe driver was arrested on multiple charges, including unlawful possession and delivery of methamphetamine, cocaine and a schedule II controlled substance. He was also charged with giving false information to a police officer.\n\nA criminal complaint against Ponce-Gonzalez was filed two months later on Aug. 5, listing potential charges of conspiracy and possession of methamphetamine.\n\nIn March 2021, a grand jury in Medford returned an indictment, charging Ponce-Gonzalez with one count of possessing with intent to distribute methamphetamine.\n\n(Herald and News/US Attorney’s Office)\n\nAn officer with the Mt. Shasta Police Department was involved in an Officer Involved Shooting (OIS) on Sunday, according to a press release from the Mt. Shasta Police Department.\n\nAn Amtrak representative has confirmed that they are working with local authorities investigating the incident. A check of the Amtrak website confirmed there are were no delays on the Coast Starlight line going through Klamath Falls and northern California.\n\nThe release said the Attorney General’s Office will be taking over the investigation. This is a developing story and KFLS news will provide more information as it becomes available. (kdrv 12)\n\nThe Klamath County Sheriff’s Office sadly reports a fatal motor vehicle crash occurred on Christmas Eve.\n\nOn Sunday, December 24th at 4:05pm, emergency service personnel responded to a crash at Summers Lane and Anderson Avenue. A collision occurred on Summers Lane between a southbound car and a westbound car. Initial investigation and witness statements indicate that the westbound car failed to stop for a stop sign on Anderson Avenue at Summers Lane.\n\nBoth the driver of the southbound car and the passenger of the westbound car were injured in the crash. The male driver of the westbound car was pronounced deceased at the scene.\n\nThe victim in the accident is 29 year old Caswell Madison Stanton of Keno. The investigation continues and no further information is available for release at this time. (kcso)\n\nKlamath Community College is expanding its Cosmetology program to allow for online access.\n\nThis initiative allows students, including those already licensed as cosmetologists, to enroll and earn an Associate Degree in Cosmetology or Esthetics, or obtain certification as a licensed professional, in as little as six months online, according to a KCC news release.\n\nAdditionally, the KCC Foundation will donate scholarships to sponsor student tuition for the new online program.\n\nThe KCC Associate Degree in Cosmetology is designed to equip professionals with skills needed to elevate student business knowledge, as well as train students in beauty and wellness.\n\nNotably, the program focuses on key subjects such as marketing and financial business skills, ensuring that graduates are well-prepared to start or expand their salon. The program is only in its second year of operation, and online access will allow students better access to becoming licensed professionals in barbering, esthetics, hair design and nail technology.\n\nThis unique approach distinguishes the KCC Cosmetology program from others, and provides a comprehensive education that goes beyond technical skill alone, the release said.\n\nIn developing the program, KCC collaborated with Bellus Academy, a leader in beauty and wellness and the recipient of multiple industry awards.\n\nSalon services are available at KCC Cosmetology, 357 E. Main St., in Klamath Falls. A wide variety of hair, skin and nails services are available to the public. For appointments, call (541) 882-6644.\n\n(KCC/HeraldandNews/KFLS)\n\nOregon Governor Kotek has appointed David Schutt as the new district attorney of Klamath County.\n\nSchutt currently serves as a public defense attorney in Lake County. From 2000 through 2012, Schutt was the Lake County DA.\n\nThe announcement fills the seat left empty following the vacation of office of former DA Eve Costello.\n\nAfter Costello stepped down in September 2022, Klamath County was provided a substitute — John Casalino, senior assistant attorney general for the Oregon Department of Justice — to fill her place until an appointment was made.\n\nIn the ensuing 15 months, Casalino served Klamath County as the state’s prosecutor for many of the cases brought before the circuit court.\n\nAfter at least three rounds of applications and more than a year later, the governor selected Lake County’s public defense attorney and former district attorney.\n\nA news release from he governor’s office expressed a positive outlook for the incoming appointment.\n\nThough the official appointment was not made for some 15 months, there were multiple applicant periods in which other local attorneys applied for the position.\n\nSchutt served three four-year terms as Lake County DA and ran for a fourth term in 2012. (press release/Herald and News/KFLS)\n\nWoman Arrested On Multiple Charges\n\nA burglary in Klamath County shut down Highway 140 in both directions for over an hour on Sunday. The pursuit of the suspect led to a multi-agency and multi-county chase.\n\nShortly after 1pm Sunday, Klamath County deputies responded to a reported burglary on Snow Goose Lane where a rifle had been reported stolen. A suspect was identified and it was soon confirmed she had arrived at a residence on Outpost Drive and was in possession of a rifle.\n\nAs law enforcement arrived at the Outpost Drive location, the suspect raised and pointed the rifle in their direction and then fled in a vehicle after driving recklessly at the deputies and an OSP Trooper. A vehicle pursuit ensued. On several occasions the pursuing deputies lost sight of the vehicle until it was located near Fort Klamath by a Forest Service LEO. The pursuit continued at speeds from 80-90 mph with light traffic conditions on Westside Road. A first attempt to spike the tires on the fleeing vehicle was unsuccessful but a second attempt near the county line on Hwy 140 succeeded. Speeds reduced to 35 mph until the vehicle came to a stop at mile post 21 in Jackson County.\n\nHighway 140 was shut down in both directions for just over an hour as law enforcement attempted to get the driver to exit the vehicle. She surrendered to the arresting deputies. The stolen rifle was located in the vehicle.\n\nThe Klamath County Sheriff’s Office was assisted by the Oregon State Police, a US Forest Service LEO, and the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office. The multi-agency/multi-county incident was made possible by the working relationships our law enforcement community works hard to maintain.\n\nNo injuries were sustained by the suspect or any of the responding officers.\n\nAfter all of that, the suspect, 41 year old Cynthia Pettit was lodged on the following charges:\n\nPettit was lodged in Klamath County Jail. Charges include Theft I, Burglary I, Unlawful Use of a Weapon x2, Pointing Firearm at Another x4, Attempt to Elude, Menacing x4, Reckless Endangering x3, Attempted Assault on a Public Safety Officer x 3, Violation of Restraining Order, and Contempt of Court.\n\nKCSO says Additional charges from previous cases may be added. (kcso release)\n\nMore than 4,000 children in Klamath County had presents come Christmas morning thanks to this year’s Marine Corps League Toys for Tots campaign.\n\nAll week long, volunteers helped spread the joy of the holidays by assisting parents and guardians in picking out the right gifts to put under the tree for their children.\n\nKay Ortega from the Oregon Child Development Coalition said their organization also gathered volunteers for picking up, organizing, purchasing and distributing toys.\n\nOCDC and KBBH staff as well as other volunteers stayed late some nights, working well into the night to prepare for the families coming the following morning.\n\nIn total each day, Toys for Tots provided presents for 1,033 children in the community this year.

The Oregon Parks and Recreation Department has participated since 2012.\n\nAround the state of Oregon\n\nDespite the political disruption of this year’s legislative session, lawmakers were able to pass more than 650 bills and resolutions during the five month session.\n\nThe highest-priority issues of the session were housing, homelessness, drug addiction, public safety and education. Many of the laws took immediate effect earlier this year, such as a massive $200 million housing and homelessness package signed by Gov. Tina Kotek in April.\n\nThere are bills aimed at these and other projects:\n\nOverdose protection, retail theft, domestic partnerships, zoning, children’s tax credits, breast cancer screenings, wildfire protection, and a ban on flavored tobacco.\n\nJust in time for the new year, the National Weather Service has issued high surf warnings for much of the West Coast and parts of Hawaii, describing the waves and rip currents expected to hit certain coastlines as potentially dangerous and life-threatening.\n\nThe warnings were in place Wednesday for parts of Oregon and Hawaii. The weather service warned that waves of up to 25 feet during the day could morph into “dangerously large breaking waves” of up to 35 feet along Oregon’s southern coast by night, creating hazardous conditions and the potential for significant beach erosion.\n\nIn Hawaii, the agency expected high surf between roughly 20 and 30 feet and powerful rip currents to affect the northern and western shores of Niihau, Kauai, Oahu and Molokai and the north shore of Maui. It warned of ocean water surging and sweeping across beaches and potentially damaging roadways and coastal infrastructure.\n\nThe high surf warning was set to be in place until Thursday night in southern Oregon and until early Friday morning in Hawaii.\n\nA coastal flood advisory was also in effect Wednesday morning through the afternoon for much of the Washington state coastline. The weather service said minor flooding around high tide could affect shorelines and low-lying coastal areas. A high surf advisory that forecast large breaking waves topping 20 feet was set to take effect Wednesday night through Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe rough ocean conditions were expected to hit California later Wednesday, starting with the state’s northern coast before affecting its southern shores beginning early Thursday.\n\nThe weather service said waves of up to 32 feet that may be “erratic and unpredictable” could spark “life-threatening surf conditions” along the coast in northern California’s Humboldt and Mendocino counties.\n\nThe weather service urged people to stay out of surf zones and away from jetties, rocks, piers and other waterside infrastructure in the affected areas.\n\nOregon State Police says troopers arrested 22 suspected DUII drivers around Oregon during the Christmas holiday.\n\nThe arrests were made in 12 of Oregon’s 36 counties between midnight on Dec. 24 and 2 a.m. on Dec. 26. According to OSP, preliminary data shows two of the arrests occurred in Malheur County, one in Baker County and one in Wallowa County.\n\nCoos County on the southern coast topped the list with four DUII arrests made by state troopers.\n\n“Impaired driving crashes are preventable,” OSP said in a statement to Elkhorn Media Group. “Drivers are urged to plan ahead and never drive impaired with any substance. To make it home safely, designate a sober driver, use public transportation, call a sober friend or family member, or use a ride share service or taxi. If you see an impaired driver on the road, call 911.”\n\nWith New Year’s Eve approaching, OSP reminds drivers that 37 people are killed each day in drunk driving crashes. Approximately 31% of all traffic deaths in the U.S. involve impaired drivers.\n\nPortland Police Shoot And Kill Robbery Suspect During Confrontation Outside Mall 205\n\nPolice officers shot and killed a man outside Mall 205 in Southeast Portland Wednesday afternoon. Police described the man as a suspect in a robbery with an active arrest warrant, and said he was shot during a confrontation when the officers attempted to arrest him.\n\nThree officers fired at the man, according to a news release from the Portland Police Bureau, and a firearm was later found next to him, but police did not release any further details about the circumstances of the shooting and did not say whether the man fired at the officers or displayed the gun during the confrontation.\n\nThe Portland Police Bureau initially reported around 4:30 p.m. that a majority of the Mall 205 parking lot and the adjacent portion of Southeast 96th Avenue were closed for a police shooting investigation, and said the closure would last several hours. The agency said there were no reported injuries to officers, but provided no further details about the situation at the time.\n\nThe investigation appeared to be concentrated around a T-Mobile store in a satellite building at the southwest corner of the Mall 205 property. Numerous officers and investigators could be seen moving in and out of the store late Wednesday afternoon, with patrol cars outside and most of the surrounding parking lot area roped off.\n\nIn a subsequent news release at around 7:30 p.m., PPB said officers had been dispatched just after 3:30 p.m. to “a large department store” in Mall 205 and were told that a suspect in a previous robbery was trying to steal merchandise, and that the suspect had an active arrest warrant.\n\nNearby members of the Focused Intervention Team responded and saw the suspect leaving the store. The suspect began running when the officers moved in to arrest him in the parking lot, according to the news release.\n\nThere was a confrontation between the suspect and officers near the west end of the Mall 205 parking lot along Southeast 96th Avenue, and the officers shot and injured the suspect. Police called EMS to the scene, and the officers approached the suspect and confirmed he was dead, according to the news release. They also found a firearm next to him.\n\nTwo of the officers who fired their weapons were from the Focused Intervention Team and the third was from the East Precinct, police said. Detectives with the Portland Police Homicide Unit responded to the scene and began investigating. The officers involved in the shooting have been placed on leave, which is standard procedure, police said.\n\nTwo of the officers who fired their weapons were from the Focused Intervention Team and the third was from the East Precinct, police said.

Residents can also safeguard themselves against the flu by:\n\nWearing a mask in indoor public spaces.\n\nStaying home and limiting contact with other people when sick.\n\nCovering the mouth and nose with a tissue while coughing or sneezing.\n\nRegularly washing their hands with soap and water, or an alcohol-based rub if soap isn’t available.\n\nAvoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth.\n\nCleaning and disinfecting objects that could have germs on them.\n\n2024 is nearly here and with it comes some changes to Oregon laws, including voter approved Measure 110.\n\nOregon has multiple new laws coming into effect New Year’s Day, including a law aimed at strengthening and improving Measure 110. House Bill 2513 works to make addiction and treatment services more available to every Oregonian, speeding up the process to get addiction funds out the door.\n\nOther bills look to develop school curriculum to help students understand the dangers of opioid use, require health care facilities to provide Narcan upon discharge to patients admitted for opioid abuse, and increasing access to addiction treatment for inmates.\n\nFirst Day Hikes are back at state park sites across Oregon, once again encouraging people to spend New Year’s Day outside and with community.\n\nThe state park program will offer free guided hikes at 31 parks on Jan. 1, the Oregon Parks and Recreation announced earlier this month. All parking fees will also be waived for the day.\n\nCollier State Park in Klamath County is inclusive in the effort.\n\nAlso participating parks include big names such as Silver Falls and Smith Rock, as well as smaller sites like Sitka Sedge and Elijah Bristow. A few parks are hosting two hikes Jan. 1, and several require advance registration. More information and registration is available online at stateparks.oregon.gov.\n\nOregon state parks have been hosting New Year’s hikes since 2012, joining in a national movement that began in Massachusetts in 1992.\n\nDriver’s license or ID card, renew vehicle tags, and take a driver’s test, among other DMV services, will see increased fees starting Jan. 1st.\n\nThe fee increases are a result of legislation passed earlier this year (House Bill 2100) designed to help DMV recover costs and temporarily avoid service reductions. Plate transfer, replacement plate/sticker, VIN inspection, plate manufacturing, camper/travel trailer/motorhome registration, and dealer document fees are included in the bill.\n\nOther fees, such as vehicle registration and the road usage charge, will see their fourth and final step increase Jan. 1 as part of Oregon’s historic House Bill 2017 transportation investment package.\n\nThe DMV says you can save time and perhaps some money by conducting your DMV business online.\n\nBe Ready For Busy Roads and Airports in Oregon\n\nOf course this is the busiest travel time of the year in the nation and here in Oregon, it’s no exception.\n\nEvery year, AAA runs the numbers to estimate the travel forecast for the Christmas and New Year’s holidays. According to AAA, the Oregon is setting records this year with 115 million Americans, including 1.6 million Oregonians traveling by air, ship and rail.\n\n“That’s more than a third of the population,” said Marie Dodds, Director of Government and Public Affairs for AAA Oregon & Idaho.\n\nThis is up more than 2% compared to last year and the highest travel volume for the year-end holidays since AAA began tracking in 2000.\n\n“We’ve seen travel rebound since the pandemic. And it always takes a few years for travel to get back to normal,” Dodds said. “We saw it after 9/11… and then we saw it again in 2008 with the Great Recession… So with the pandemic, we are seeing people rebound with travel. And travel is one of those things where when you can’t travel, you really miss it.”\n\nAccording to AAA, many road trips could take anywhere from 20% to two times longer to reach the destination. Drivers are enjoying lower gas prices. Nationwide the average price-per-gallon is $3.07 — the lowest price in two years.\n\n“Before you leave during the winter, ask yourself: ‘Do I have enough provisions? If I am stranded somewhere for hours or worse, overnight, will I be able to keep everybody in my vehicle safe and comfortable?’”\n\nAAA also sees vehicle-related calls spike during the winter, according to Dodds, with the top the top four issues being dead batteries, lockouts, tire issues and extrications.\n\nAir travelers\n\nMore than 7 million people are expected to fly over the holiday period.\n\n“This is the time that you definitely want to get to the airport two hours before your domestic flight, three hours before your international flight, because lines are going to be longer,” she said. “And if you can go without checking a bag, that’s great too. Carry on your bag if you can.” (Oregon news sources)\n\nState biologists say Oregon’s gray wolf population may have reached its ecological limit in the eastern third of the state and that packs will probably spread out to the west and south in greater numbers.\n\nThose comments, made at a meeting of the state Fish and Wildlife Commission, came as Colorado released five wolves trapped from Oregon as part of a historic reintroduction program.\n\nRoblyn Brown, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife’s wolf coordinator, told ranchers and conservationists last week that about 200 gray wolves in nearly 25 packs call Oregon home. She said their numbers have leveled off in recent years because most wolves live in northeast Oregon, an area that’s becoming crowded for the species. Wolves first recolonized their native habitat there in 2009 after hunting and harassment eradicated them from Oregon for 50 years.\n\nThe wildlife agency counted 178 wolves in the state in 2022, up from 175 in 2021 and 173 in 2020, though officials say that’s an undercount. Their numbers have plateaued in recent years after spiking for a decade. Wolves packs have taken root in central and southwestern Oregon, including a pack in Jackson County that has become notorious for preying on cattle.(Herald and News)\n\nTwo people are behind bars after Weed, California Police found them in possession of drugs wrapped like Christmas presents.\n\nAccording to the Weed Police Department, during a traffic stop, officers searched the vehicle and found about 20 pounds of narcotics wrapped as gifts.\n\nPolice say they also found two unregistered firearms in the car.\n\nThe 48-year-old man who was driving and his 33-year-old passenger were both arrested on multiple charges, including possession and possession with intent to sell methamphetamines.

Ashland needs about 24 to 30 inches of snow before it can reopen to skiers and snowboarders. According to the Mt. Ashland website, there has been zero inches of snowfall over the past week.\n\nAndrew Gast, the general manager of the ski hill, said there isn’t enough snow on the ground to operate but everything else at the hill is up and running.\n\nRight now the team is working on a shuttle program after receiving a $50,000 grant from Travel Oregon.

So far, there’s been no reports of damage and authorities don’t expect any.\n\nThe epicenter was just west of the small town of Quilcene, Washington.\n\nBack in October, a 4.3 magnitude earthquake hit south of Port Townsend in Scow Bay, between Indian and Marrowstone islands.\n\nThe last time Washington state had a 4.0 magnitude earthquake was in 2019, when a 4.6 earthquake hit near Monroe.\n\nOregon’s population declined for the second year in a row, new population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau show.\n\nFederal data released last week estimate Oregon shed about 0.1% of its residents, or 6,021 people, in the year leading up to July 1, 2023. That comes after the state lost about 0.4% in the year before. While the Census Bureau has yet to release population numbers at the city and county level, the Portland State center estimates that Multnomah County gained 1,728 residents in the year ending in July 1, 2023.\n\nThe Portland State center’s city population numbers indicate that Portland added 4,015 residents, reflecting a 0.6% growth over the same time period.

We’re asking you to change your risk of getting sick.”\n\nThe renewed push for vaccinations comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today published the latest edition of its Morbidity and Mortality Week Report (MMWR) on fall 2023 respiratory virus vaccination coverage among adults. The report includes national and jurisdiction-specific estimates for influenza, COVID-19 and RSV vaccination coverage among adults 18 and older from the National Immunization Survey-Adult COVID Module.\n\nAccording to the report, 25% of eligible Oregon adults have received the 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccine, 40.8% have received the influenza vaccine and 20.3% have received the RSV vaccine. Oregon ranks ninth in the nation for COVID-19 vaccine coverage; 35th for flu vaccine coverage; and 16th for RSV vaccine coverage.\n\nSupply is not a problem for most of the vaccines, Sidelinger says. COVID-19 and influenza vaccines are readily available in Oregon, as are the new RSV vaccines for older adults and pregnant people. The RSV antibody immunization for children is still in limited supply across the country and in Oregon, though some doses are available for newborns and prioritized high-risk babies – parents should talk to their health care providers.\n\nIt can take a couple weeks for the body to ramp up its immune response following vaccination, but Sidelinger says antibody levels start rising within days of getting a shot and will offer some protection. He said people can think of getting vaccinated as a gift for themselves and loved ones, or as a New Year’s resolution.\n\nPeople can get the vaccines by contacting their health plan, health care provider, county public health clinic or federally qualified health center (FQHC). They can also search for a clinic by ZIP code by visiting vaccinefinder.org, or by calling 211 or visiting 211info.org.\n\nBureau of Land Management interns are available for interviews regarding their experiences with BLM, and to let other students know about the benefits of starting a federal career with a paid student internship.\n\nBureau of Land Management officials have extended the period to apply for paid student internships! Eligible students can now apply through Monday, January 8, 2024.\n\nAfter a successful push to hire more than 100 student interns across the country last year, BLM leaders are again in search of 100+ enthusiastic students looking for paid internships in the federal government. Jessica Schooley and Scott Truman were hired during the first “100 Interns” campaign. They are currently kicking off their federal careers as part of the BLM survey team in eastern Oregon.\n\nApplying for internships with the federal government is a little different than applying for other jobs, so BLM leaders recently hosted two workshops to help interested students. Internships are available in a variety of career fields and functions, including Civil engineering, Public affairs, Information technology, Survey, Administration, Land law examiner and Natural resources. Other positions include Land surveyor, Wildland fire, Geographic information systems, Human resources, Grant management.

Therefore, drivers in no passing zones will be allowed to cross into the left lane of the roadway to get around them.\n\nEugene resident Richard Hughes, a self-described bicycle advocate, requested the law. It was formally introduced by Sen. Floyd Prozanski of Eugene and Rep. Tom Andersen of Salem. It was approved during the 2023 legislative session with no votes in opposition in either chamber.\n\nHughes said it’s unnerving for cyclists when drivers trail them for miles on rural roads.\n\nWhen travelling at over 35 mph, Oregon drivers must also maintain enough distance while passing to avoid a falling cyclist.
