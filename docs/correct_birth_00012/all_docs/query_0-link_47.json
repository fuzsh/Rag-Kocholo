        "text": "PLAINS, Ga. (WALB) - There are some new concerns for former President Jimmy Carter’s health after his grandson claims the president is “near the end.”\n\nJason Carter, Jimmy Carter’s grandson, stated that he was “doing OK.”\n\nResidents in the community said they miss Carter’s presence in the downtown area.\n\n“Well, we are missing Rosalynn, well, obviously. President Carter is missed in the community, and we know he is still here. And we get daily reports on him. But we do miss seeing him in the community,” said Tim Buchanan, general manager of the Plains Historic Inn and Buffalo Cafe.\n\nThe Carters were known to be active in all the things happening in Plains, but as both Carters’ health deteriorated over the past few years, they were unable to spend much time in the town they put on the world stage.\n\n“The Carters were more than just a president and first lady. They were world citizens and did things for the world. And we should all be proud of it,” Buchanan said.\n\nJimmy Carter was last seen by the public nearly a year ago during Rosalynn’s funeral. People here said they are thankful for their influence.\n\n“We sympathize, but Rosalynn and Jimmy will always be alive in Plains. Their spirit will always be here. Every meeting, every little thing it will always be what would the Carters think, or what would the Carters think,” said Philip Kurland, owner of Plains Trading Post.\n\n“Just very relaxing, reflective. We’ve talked a lot about him as the president when he was president and just as a person. In comparison to other presidents, we’ve had that conversation,” said Linda Stutes, a Plains visitor.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Carter Center’s CEO Paige Alexander said. “There really hasn’t been a significant change. I mean, he will always be one bad cold away from the end.”"
