        "text": "Former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, were spotted Saturday at a festival in his hometown of Plains, Georgia.\n\nThe Carter Center reshared a video of the former President, 98, and former first lady, 96, riding in a black SUV at the Plains Peanut Festival.\n\n\"Beautiful day for President & Mrs. Carter to enjoy a ride through the Plains Peanut Festival! And just a week before he turns 99,\" the center wrote in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. \"We’re betting peanut butter ice cream is on the menu for lunch! #JimmyCarter99.\"\n\nCarter Center CEO Paige Alexander said in statement that the former president and first lady “care deeply about their hometown, and it’s great to see them feeling the love from their neighbors and friends in Plains.”\n\nThe outing comes seven months after the longest-lived U.S. president entered hospice care at his home following a series of brief hospital stays. He said at the time that he was going to stop further medical intervention and spend the remainder of his life at home. Carter did not disclose an illness.\n\nA few months later, in May, it was revealed that the former first lady had been diagnosed with dementia.\n\nJason Carter, chairman of the Carter Center’s Board of Trustees, told USA Today last week that the couple is happy. They marked their 77th wedding anniversary in July.\n\n\"They are together. They are at home. They’re in love, and I don’t think anyone gets more than that,\" he said. \"I mean, it’s a perfect situation for this time in their lives.\"\n\n\"They’re both doing as well as can be expected,\" Jason Carter continued."
