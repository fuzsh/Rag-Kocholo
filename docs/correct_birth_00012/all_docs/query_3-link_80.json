According to Reagan's autobiographies, he received the nickname soon after his birth, from his father's remark that he looked like “a fat little Dutchman.\" Reagan has also stated, however, that his father gave him the nickname because of the “Dutch boy\" haircut, once popular for little boys, that his mother gave him when he was a toddler. When asked to reconcile the two stories of the nickname's origin, Reagan stated that the haircut strengthened the use of the nickname.\n\nReligion"
