        "text": "Always a Reckoning\n\nby Jimmy Carter\n\nIn this moving, wide-ranging, and intensely personal collection of poems — his first — President Jimmy Carter opens to us his very private and reflective world. Always a Reckoning is sparked with wry and sometimes bitter humor, warmed with tenderness, and glowing with an intense and passionate caring that is born of an awareness both political and sensual.\n\n(Hard cover only) 128 pages; Dimensions 8, 5 1/2, 1 inches\n\nBeyond the White House: Waging Peace, Fighting Disease and Building Hope\n\nby Jimmy Carter\n\nThis is the story of President Jimmy Carter's post-presidency, the most admired and productive in the nation's history. Through the Carter Center, which he and Rosalynn Carter founded in 1982, he has fought neglected diseases, waged peace in war zones, and built hope among some of the most forgotten and needy people in the world.\n\n(Hard cover only) 272 pages; Dimensions 9 1/2, 6 1/2, 1 inches\n\nBlood of Abraham: Insights into the Middle East\n\nby Jimmy Carter\n\nSince his earlier days in the White House, Jimmy Carter has demonstrated an untiring passion for pursuing peace in the Middle East. His formation of the Carter Center and his continuing prominent role in world affairs have done nothing to dampen that passion. In this new edition of a national bestseller, President Carter demystifies the history of each nation's political expectation, the reasons for their different goals, and the nature of their prime concerns. His landmark study provides an enlightened and reconciling vision for all-Jews, Moslems, and Christians-who share the blood of Abraham.\n\n(Soft cover only) 243 pages; Dimensions 6 1/2, 5 1/2, 1 inches\n\nA Call to Action\n\nby Jimmy Carter\n\nPresident Carter was encouraged to write this book by a wide coalition of leaders of all faiths. His urgent report covers a system of discrimination that extends to every nation. Women are deprived of equal opportunity in wealthier nations and \"owned\" by men in others, forced to suffer servitude, child marriage, and genital cutting. The most vulnerable, along with their children, are trapped in war and violence. A Call to Action addresses the suffering inflicted upon women by a false interpretation of carefully selected religious texts and a growing tolerance of violence and warfare.\n\nChristmas in Plains Collector's Edition by Jimmy Carter\n\nThis slim Collector's edition volume by the 39th President is a perfect book for the holidays, as President Jimmy Carter recalls warm Christmas memories from throughout his life. He tells of searching for a Christmas tree with his father, \"one that was perfect in size and shape.\" There is boyhood excitement as he remembers how fireworks were among his early Christmas delights.\n\n(Hardcover only) 155 pages; Dimensions 7 1/2, 5, 1/2 inches\n\nEverything to Gain: Making the Most of the Rest of Your Life\n\nby Jimmy Carter and Rosalynn Carter\n\nNever before has it been possible for people to do so much with their lives for so long---often they complete a career with many active years still ahead. Here, in one of the most personal--and in many ways the most remarkable---books ever to evolve from the presidency, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter offer inspiring and practical views on how Americans can make the most of the second part of their lives.\n\n(Hard cover only) 198 pages; Dimensions 9, 5, 1 inches\n\nFaith A Journey for Us All\n\nby Jimmy Carter\n\nAll his life, President Jimmy Carter has been a courageous exemplar of faith. Now he shares the lessons he learned. He writes, “The issue of faith arises in almost every area of human existence, so it is important to understand its multiple meanings. In this book, my primary goal is to explore the broader meaning of faith, its far-reaching effect on our lives, and its relationship to past, present, and future events in America and around the world. The religious aspects of faith are also covered, since this is how the word is most often used, and I have included a description of the ways my faith has guided and sustained me, as well as how it has challenged and driven me to seek a closer and better relationship with people and with God.” As President Carter examines faith’s many meanings, he describes how to accept it, live it, how to doubt and find faith again. A serious and moving reflection from one of America’s most admired and respected citizens.\n\nFirst Lady From Plains\n\nby Rosalynn Carter\n\nIn this warm and inspiring autobiography, Rosalynn Carter describes her life, from growing up in Plains, Georgia, to becoming First Lady and later returning to Plains. Mrs. Carter writes of her childhood saying, \"When Daddy came home from work, he always rushed into the kitchen, picked up my mother, whirled her around the room and gave her a kiss. My friends' parents didn't act this way in front of their children, so I thought my house was very special.\"\n\n(Soft cover only) 394 pages; Dimensions 8 1/2, 5 1/2,1 1/2 inches\n\nA Full Life: Reflections at Ninety\n\nby Jimmy Carter\n\nAt ninety, Jimmy Carter reveals more about his youth in rural Georgia than he described in his magnificent An Hour Before Daylight, which The New Yorker called “An American classic.” He writes about racism during his boyhood and the isolation of the Carters during the civil rights struggles. He portrays the brutality of the hazing regimen at Annapolis, how he nearly lost his life twice serving on submarines, and his amazing job interview with Admiral Rickover. He writes movingly about the profound influence his mother had on him and how he admired his father even though he didn’t always emulate him.\n\nIn A Full Life, President Carter tells us what has made him proud and what he might have done differently, his regret at losing his reelection, and how he and Rosalynn made a new lift through rewarding second and third careers. He is frank about the presidents who have succeeded him, about world leaders, and about his passion for special causes, particularly the condition of women and their deprivation in the developing world that he deplored in A Call to Action.\n\nJimmy Carter has lived one of our great American lives — from rural obscurity to world fame, universal respect, and contentment — a full life indeed.\n\nDimensions 9 , 7 , 1 inches\n\nA Government As Good As Its People\n\nby Jimmy Carter\n\nThis volume presents sixty-two of the best and most notable public statements made by Jimmy Carter on his way to becoming president of the United States.

He reminds us that much of the fight for independence took place in that region and that it was a struggle of both great and small battles and of terrible brutality, with neighbor turned against neighbor, the Indians' support sought by both sides, and a no quarters asked or given. The Hornet's Nest follows a cast of characters and their loved ones on both sides of this violent conflict — including some who are based on the author's ancestors.\n\n(Hard cover only) 465 pages; Dimensions 9 1/2, 6 1/2, 1 inches\n\nThe Little Baby Snoogle-Fleejer\n\nby Jimmy Carter\n\nIllustrated by Amy Carter\n\n\"Once upon a time there was a little boy named Jeremy who lived with his mother in a small house near the sea. His mother earned a bare living for two of them by washing clothes for some of the wealthy families in their town. Jeremy loved her very much.\"\n\nSo begins the enchanting fairy tale President Jimmy Carter first spun for his children over three decades ago. Now, with his first children's book, he brings his family's favorite story to vivid life.\n\n(Hardcover only) 24 pages; Dimensions 8 1/2, 10, 1/4 inches\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize Lecture (link no longer available)\n\nby Jimmy Carter\n\nThis inspiring and beautifully-styled book showcases the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize Lecture delivered by President Jimmy Carter.

He writes that following the end of the Cold War, \"the world is now, in many ways, a more dangerous place with a plethora of civil wars, the scourge of racism and appalling acts of terrorism.\" Carter warns against \"the principle of preventive war.\" He adds, \"War may sometimes be a necessary evil. But no matter how necessary, it is always an evil, never a good.\"\n\n(Hard cover only) 20 pages; Dimensions 7, 5, 1/2 inches\n\nAn Outdoor Journal\n\nby Jimmy Carter\n\nIn this new edition, President Carter shares his most recent experiences of outdoor adventures. Go with President Carter as he and in many cases Rosalynn wade in trout streams, follow a bird dog, freeze in duck ponds, and entice \"amorous\" tom turkeys. President Carter shares his childhood experiences, when he and his father would go out. \"About once a year my daddy took me on a fishing trip to a more distant place, usually farther south in Georgia.\n\n(Soft cover only) 316 pages; Dimensions 8 1/2 , 5 1/2, 1 inches\n\nThe Personal Beliefs of Jimmy Carter\n\nby Jimmy Carter\n\nThe Nobel Committee recognized President Carter's remarkable achievements by awarding him the Peace Prize in October 2002 for his accomplishments fostering peace during his presidency and his tireless work after leaving office monitoring elections, promoting peaceful resolutions to conflicts, and helping provide food, shelter, and health care to the world's poor. Now, in The Personal Beliefs of Jimmy Carter, readers have for the first time in one volume the complete text of his spiritual autobiography, Living Faith, in which President Carter shares the values and experiences that have shaped his life, and Sources of Strength, fifty-two of his favorite Bible lessons that he has taught at his hometown church in Plains, Georgia, over the decades.\n\n(Soft cover only) 252 pages; Dimensions 8 1/2, 5 1/2, 1 1/2 inches\n\nA Remarkable Mother\n\nby Jimmy Carter\n\nA registered nurse, pecan grower, university housemother, Peace Corps volunteer, public speaker, and renowned raconteur, Miss Lillian ignored the mores and prejudices of the racially segregated South of the Great Depression years. She was an avid supporter of the Brooklyn Dodgers (because she happened to attend the first major league baseball game in which Jackie Robinson, from Cairo, Georgia, played), was a favored guest on television talk shows (usually able to \"steal the microphone\" from hosts such as Johnny Carson and Walter Cronkite), and an important role model for the nation. Jimmy Carter's mother emerges from this portrait as redoubtable, generous, and forward-looking. He ascribes to her the inspiration for his own life's work of commitment and faith.\n\n(Hard cover only) 222 pages; Dimensions 7 1/2, 5 1/2 ,1\n\nThrough the Year with Jimmy Carter\n\nby Jimmy Carter\n\nIn \"Through the Year with Jimmy Carter,\" the 39th president of the United States takes us on a unique journey into the heart of the Christian faith. Based on more than three decades of practical Bible teaching delivered to his Sunday school classes in Plains, Ga., and Washington, D.C., these readings draw from the Bible and the compelling experiences of President Carter's own life. Whether he's giving fascinating glimpses into behind-the-scenes activity at the White House, or insightful remembrances of his career in the U.S. Navy, President Carter connects the wisdom of Scripture with the reader's own crucial place on the stage of life. \"Through the Year with Jimmy Carter\" is frank, honest, sometimes funny, sometimes heartbreaking, and always relevant.\n\n(Hard cover only) 366 pages; Dimensions 9 1/2, 6 1/2 ,1\n\nTurning Point: A Candidate, a State and a Nation Come of Age\n\nTurning Point is President Carter's story of how he first sought public office in 1962 and how the social and political conflicts in the South during that era shaped his vision of how people of good faith can join forces to right the wrongs of our society. By 1962, segregation laws had been declared invalid, and confrontations were taking place at lunch counters, universities, and bus depots. That spring, the Supreme Court's \"one man, \"one vote\" decision mandated equal representation for all citizens, but when Carter decided to run for the newly reconstituted Georgia state senate, his career was nearly strangled at birth.\n\nNote: This book was published in 1992\n\n(Hard cover only) 233 pages; Dimensions 9 1/2, 6 1/2, 1 inches\n\nWe Can Have Peace in the Holy Land\n\nby Jimmy Carter\n\nWe Can Have Peace in the Holy Land In this urgent, balanced, and passionate book, Nobel Peace Laureate and former President Jimmy Carter argues that the present moment is a unique time for achieving peace in the Middle East---and he offers a bold and comprehensive plan to do just that. President Carter has been a student of the biblical Holy Land all his life. For the last three decades, as president of the United States and as founder of the Carter Center, he has studied the complex and interrelated issues of the region's conflicts and has been actively involved in reconciling them. He knows the leaders of all factions in the region who will need to play key roles, and he sees encouraging signs among them. Carter describes the history of previous peace efforts and why they fell short. He argues persuasively that the road to a peace agreement is now open and that it has broad international and regional support. Most of all, since there will be no progress without courageous and sustained U.S. leadership, he says the time for progress is now. President Barack Obama is committed to a personal effort to exert that leadership, starting early in his administration. This is President Carter's call for action, and he lays out a practical and doable path to peace.\n\n(Hard Cover only) 228 pages; Dimensions 9.5,6.5,1\n\nWhite House Diary\n\nby Jimmy Carter\n\nEach day during his presidency, Jimmy Carter made several entries in a private diary. He provided unvarnished assessments of cabinet members, congressmen, and foreign leaders; he narrated the progress of secret negotiations such as those that led to the Camp David Accords; he recorded his thoughts, impressions, delights, and frustrations. When his four-year term came to an end in early 1981, the diary amounted to more than five thousand pages.\n\nOffering an unprecedented look at both the man and his tenure, this fascinating book will stand as a unique contribution to the history of the American presidency.\n\n(Hardcover) 592 pages\n\nWhy Not the Best\n\nby Jimmy Carter\n\nWhen a little-known former Southern Governor named Jimmy Carter decided to seek the Presidency, he wrote, \"Why Not the Best?\" as a means of letting voters know who he was and his sense of values. The title comes from a question Admiral Rickover asked him during a job interview, following his graduation from the Naval Academy. \"Did you do your best?\" Rickover asked. Carter initially answered \"yes sir\" but after some thought said, \"no sir, I didn't always do my best.\" Describing the scene years later, Carter writes, \"He asked one final question which I have never been able to forget-or to answer. He said, \"Why not?\"\n\n(Hard cover encased in a presentation box only) 208 pages; Dimensions 9 1/2, 6 1/2, 1 inches\n\nWithin Our Reach: Ending the Mental Health Crisis by Rosalynn Carter\n\nIn Within Our Reach: Ending the Mental Health Crisis, Rosalynn Carter and coauthors Susan K. Golant and Kathryn E. Cade render an insightful, unsparing assessment of the state of mental health. Carter has been deeply invested in this issue since her husband's gubernatorial campaign when she saw firsthand the horrific, dehumanizing treatment of people with mental illness. Using stories from her 35 years of advocacy to springboard into a discussion of the larger issues at hand, Carter crafts an intimate and powerful account of a subject previously shrouded in stigma and shadow, surveying the dimensions of an issue that has affected us all. She describes a system that continues to fail those in need, even though recent scientific breakthroughs with mental illness have potential to help most people lead more normal lives. Within Our Reach is a seminal, searing, and ultimately optimistic look at how far we've come since Carter's days on the campaign trail and how far we have yet to go."
