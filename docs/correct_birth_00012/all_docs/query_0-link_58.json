        "text": "Since Carter had been a peanut farmer prior to becoming governor of Georgia, the map has a peanut-form cartouche title surmounted by two dancing peanuts and flanked on the left by a caricature illustration of him. The map also has a caricature of his defeated Republican opponent, Gerald Ford, hitchhiking back to his home state of Michigan with a bag of money. Numerous other such inside jokes are illustrated.\n\nA tongue-in-cheek list, inset upper left, is addressed to the citizens of Plains, Georgia, with recommended behavior at the inaugural in Washington, including tips such as “Keep cigarette pack and matches in pocket, not in rolled up sleeve,” and “Before leaving for Washington, clean red mud from windshield.”\n\nCondition: Generally very good with usual light overall toning and wear, soft creases. A bit of edge wear."
