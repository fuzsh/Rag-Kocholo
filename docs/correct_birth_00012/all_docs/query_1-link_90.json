        "text": "Mark Woods: Jimmy Carter living an extraordinary, ordinary life 40 years after White House\n\nPLAINS, Ga. — The week after the November election, I headed to the Georgia woods to try to disconnect from 2020 by backpacking through a state park named after Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\nI didn’t choose Pine Mountain because of this fact. I chose it because it’s within driving distance of Jacksonville (and doesn’t include driving through Atlanta) and has 40 miles of trails in more than 9,000 acres. But the presidential connection seemed fitting.\n\nRoosevelt first came to this part of Georgia in 1924 for its soothing, healing powers. He found the warm springs to be one of the few things that provided relief from his polio symptoms. When he became the 32nd president, he continued to return here every year except one, during World War II.\n\nIn 1945, he was in his fourth term as president, sitting for a portrait at the six-room pine house that became known as the Little White House. He complained of a “terrific headache,” slumped over in his chair and died.\n\nHe was 63 years old.\n\nWhile it seemed fitting 75 years later to escape to a part of Georgia beloved by the longest-serving U.S. president — in 1947, Congress passed the 22nd Amendment, saying that no president shall be elected more than twice — it seemed even more fitting to make a slight detour on the way back to Jacksonville. To Plains, Ga.\n\nWhen Donald Trump lost the presidential election, he became the 11th incumbent in U.S. history to be voted out of the White House. Only one of the previous 10 is alive.\n\nAt 96, Jimmy Carter is the longest-living president in U.S. history.\n\nIt has been 40 years since Carter lost to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 election. Two months later, he got in a limousine with Reagan and rode to the U.S. Capital for the inauguration. Then he and Rosalynn headed back to Plains, a town about a mile in diameter with a population of under 1,000.\n\nHe was only 56. On Jan. 20, 2021, when Joe Biden is sworn in as the 46th president, the 39th president will reach another unprecedented milestone — 40 years as an ex-president.\n\nHis post-presidency hasn't simply been long. It has been remarkably simple.\n\nThe Carters, who will celebrate their 75th anniversary next summer, still live in the same house they returned to 40 years ago. It’s the only house they’ve ever owned, a two-bedroom ranch, built in 1961, and assessed a few years ago at $167,000.\n\nAs a president, he sometimes carried his own suitcase onto Air Force One. As an ex-president, he often flies commercial, sometimes walking through the aisle, shaking hands with passengers, before taking his seat.\n\nThrough the Atlanta-based Carter Center, Carter has used his post-presidency to champion causes that now seem straight out of the 2020 headlines: global health programs, fair elections around the world, human rights.\n\nOne of his pet causes has been Habitat for Humanity. Even in his 90s, at least before COVID, he still was strapping on his tool belt, picking up his hammer and helping renovate homes. He’s worked on more than 4,000 Habitat homes.\n\nWhenever I hear this statistic, I think of one home and photo in particular.\n\nIt’s from the late 1980s, one of the early Carter Habitat projects. Even if you didn’t know the date, you could guess it from the clothing. Carter is posing with a group in front of a finished home in Milwaukee. He’s grinning, the grin that helped him get elected, the grin that also became mocked.\n\nMy dad had a copy of this photo — because he was one of the people in that group.\n\nI think he would’ve said that Jimmy Carter was his favorite president. Or maybe that’s not the best way to phrase it. I don’t know how my dad would characterize Carter’s presidency. I just know that he admired Carter.\n\nSome of it was the faith. Dad was a Baptist minister. I remember hearing him grumble about televangelists who seemed more intent with lining their own pockets than helping others, and politicians who used the Bible more as a prop than a guide for life.\n\nSome of it was the humility. Dad hated arrogance, particularly those with privilege and power. When it came to politics, this wasn't a Republican or Democrat thing. I remember him calling Ted Kennedy arrogant.\n\nKennedy became a part of that 1980 election. With Carter’s popularity slipping, he decided to challenge the incumbent. His campaign ran a television ad that warned Democrats that Carter was a loser. And if you go by election results — Reagan won the popular vote by 8 million, the Electoral College by 489-49 — that turned out to be true.\n\nBut Dad never believed winning is everything. I think he was drawn to underdogs of all sorts (he was a Cubs fan) and that maybe, in some strange way, Carter losing — and definitely the way he responded to losing — made Dad appreciate him even more.\n\nThat’s why I took a detour back to Plains.\n\nA few years ago, I told my wife and daughter I wanted to go there, partly to see another National Park Service site. Much of the town — including the nearby boyhood farm, the high school, the train depot — is part of Jimmy Carter National Historic Site.\n\nThe park service says that before the pandemic (which has closed the visitor center at the high school), the site was drawing about 70,000 visitors a year. But, of course, many of those visitors came because if it was the right weekend and they were willing to get up early on a Sunday, they could do more than listen to recordings of an ex-president talking about his boyhood farm. They could attend Sunday school taught by him.\n\nThat isn’t happening these days. So this time I simply checked out the boyhood farm again and stopped to get peanut brittle from the shop on Main Street where Earl Carter used to own and operate a peanut business and insurance agency. On one shelf, not far from cans of Billy Beer, were some of the more than 30 books Carter has written in the last 40 years.\n\nI ended up choosing one that seemed fitting: “Beyond the White House.”\n\nWhile checking out, I asked the employees if they still see the Carters around town. An older woman said that between the pandemic and the Carters getting up in years, they haven’t seen much of them lately. Then she pointed at the blond teenager ringing up the brittle and book and said, “But she’s related to them.”\n\nOnly in Plains do you buy a book written by an ex-president, who’s living less than a mile away, from a girl who is a relative.\n\nIt's a Wonderful Life\n\nMy first vote for president was in that 1980 election.\n\nI don’t think I ever told my dad this: I did not vote for Jimmy Carter.\n\nI also didn’t vote for Ronald Reagan.\n\nI voted for John B. Anderson, an Illinois Republican who ran an independent campaign and received 6.6 percent of the vote.\n\nForty years later, I’m not sure how I arrived at this decision. I think some of it was youthful rebellion. I didn’t want to be like my parents. Not then anyway. Now I only wish I could be like them. But back then, I didn’t want to be just like them. So I didn’t vote for Carter. And I didn’t follow much of America and vote for Reagan\n\nPlus, Anderson spoke at my college. I spent part of a day photographing his visit. Afterward, he signed a copy of his speech.\n\nMore than a decade later, in the early 1990s, my dad had quadruple bypass surgery and a rocky recovery. Living in Florida, I felt helpless. I tried to think of something that might give him a lift. I remembered how when I was a kid, he contacted Detroit Tigers announcer Ernie Harwell. What, I wondered, would be the equivalent of that for my dad?\n\nSo I wrote a letter to the Carter Center, not expecting any kind of response. I think I mentioned how my dad was a Baptist minister in Wisconsin, how he had worked with President Carter on one of the Habitat projects, how I’m sure he would appreciate a note or a prayer.\n\nOne day I got a call from my dad. He said he didn’t know how it had happened, but he got a letter signed by Jimmy Carter.\n\nHe framed that letter along with the photo from Milwaukee.\n\nMy dad lived a few more years, before collapsing one day at the hospital where he was the chaplain. He was only 60.\n\nI remember being surprised by the response to his death. By how many people had stories about how my dad had helped them through some sort of tough time. I remember thinking about how in this small town he had made a much bigger impact than I realized — and how our idea of what defines someone as successful is often horribly out of whack.\n\nEarl Carter’s death had a similar effect on his oldest son.\n\nJimmy Carter was a rising star in the Navy, a senior officer in the nuclear submarine program in Schenectady, N.Y., when he was summoned home because his father was dying. Standing by his father’s bedside, he watched as people came to pay their respects. They told stories about how Mr. Carter helped them avoid foreclosure. Or how when they couldn’t pay their bills, he gave them credit at the Carter Store.\n\nIt’s a story that brings to mind “It’s a Wonderful Life,” right down to how Jimmy Carter reacted a bit like Jimmy Stewart.\n\nHe and Rosalynn had dreamed of getting out of a real-life town that makes Bedford Falls seem large, traveling the world, only coming back to visit.\n\nAfter Earl Carter died in 1953 at age 53, Jimmy told Rosalynn he wanted to resign his naval commission, move back to Plains and take over the family business.\n\nThey, of course, left Plains again in the 1970s, moving into the Georgia Governor’s Mansion and the White House.\n\nWhen they came back again, moving back into the same ranch house, it was even more surprising.\n\nCarter didn’t go out and give speeches for six-figure sums, or serve on corporate boards. In other words, he didn’t do what pretty much every other modern ex-president has done.\n\n“I don’t blame other people for doing it,” he told the Washington Post in 2018. “It just never has been my ambition to be rich.”\n\nHe settled back into a comfortable life in Plains, where he’s been known to shop for clothes at the nearby Dollar General Store.\n\nUntil recently, you might spot Jimmy and Rosalynn on a Saturday night, holding hands as they walk home from their regular dinner at the home of a longtime friend.\n\nOr, every other Sunday morning, you’d find Jimmy Carter teaching at Maranatha Baptist Church.\n\nIn his younger days, he sometimes did church chores, like cutting the hedges. He made the cross behind the altar. And if you look on the bottom of the wooden offering plates, you’ll find some initials that don’t stand for Jesus Christ, but for the craftsman who made them.\n\nSince leaving the White House, Carter has taught more than 800 Sunday school lessons in the church.\n\nIn June 2017, my family went to Plains, along with former co-worker Andrew Pantazi and his family. It was about more than American politics and history. For me, it was a way to remember my dad on Father’s Day.\n\nFather's Day in Plains\n\nWe spent the night in Americus, driving the 10 miles to Plains in the morning, arriving before sunrise on a foggy morning — and finding a line of cars already there.\n\nThe church only has about 30 active members. But some Sundays more than 500 people show up, which is more than the church can hold. So when you arrive, you’re handed a number.\n\nOur number was 59.\n\nWhen it was time, we lined up outside the church based on our number, passed through Secret Service security and took a seat in the last row.\n\nWith three sections of pews, 13 rows of each, the church reminded me of the one where my dad was a pastor when I was growing up. Only, judging by all the accents and languages, most of the people gathered clearly weren’t from Wisconsin or, for that matter, even Georgia.\n\nWhen the time for Sunday school came, Carter entered the room, smiling, wearing a gray blazer, gray pants, blue shirt, and a bolo tie with an arrowhead.\n\nHe moved slowly. But all things considered, he seemed stronger than expected. It’s not just that he was in his 90s. A few years earlier he was diagnosed with melanoma on his liver and brain. At a press conference in 2015 he had said he was “perfectly at ease with whatever comes.”\n\nBut after radiation and chemotherapy, this is what came: He still was teaching Sunday school in Plains, before heading to Alaska for a fishing trip, then going to Canada for a Habitat project.\n\n“Morning everybody,” he said.\n\nHe introduced the church’s new pastor, then said he likes to know where people he’ll be talking to are from. People shouted out states and countries. Florida, Maryland, Georgia, Iowa, Hawaii, India.\n\n\"My mother was in the Peace Corps in India,” he said.\n\nLouisiana, Iowa.\n\n“I’ve been to Iowa a few times,” he said, referring to the staple of a presidential campaign.\n\nColorado, New Jersey, Mississippi, Philippines, South Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Minnesota, Oklahoma, England, Oregon, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Kansas, Connecticut, Illinois, Zimbabwe, Ohio.\n\n“Everybody agree that’s enough?” he said.\n\nHe asked the First Lady to lead a prayer, then asked two of his sons to stand up. He said Chip lives in Decatur and Jack lives near Las Vegas. Another son, Jeff, lives in Peachtree. A daughter, Amy, lives in Atlanta. And then there are the 21 grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\n“The lesson this morning is going to be tied from the Old Testament to Father’s Day,” he said. “I wrote a book of poems earlier in my life. I don’t do this very often, but I’m going to read one of the poems about my father.”\n\nHe set it up by saying that Daddy was a farmer, a hard-working businessman, and a very strict parent. He expected his children to do what he told them. And he punished Jimmy five times for various breaches of his standards.\n\n“I remember all five of them,” he said. “Every time he would have kind of a little trial. He would ask me the circumstances of my doing wrong. I would explain it. He would tell me why it was wrong. He would punish me, a moderate but memorable way. Five times.”\n\nHe told the story of the first time.\n\n“When I was about 4 years old, I had a penny to give to church for collection,” he said, pausing with a guilty smile. “And when I came home I had two pennies.”\n\nHe pulled out a pair of reading glasses, put them on and read the poem titled, “I Wanted to Share My Father’s World.”\n\n“This is the pain I mostly hide &mldr;” he began.\n\nThe poem describes how after despising his father’s discipline as a boy, craving his praise, he came to appreciate his father.\n\nHe finished the poem, reading the final lines.\n\nI never put aside\n\nthe past resentments of the boy\n\nuntil, with my own sons, I shared\n\nhis final hours, and came to see\n\nwhat he’d become, or always was —\n\nthe father who will never cease to be\n\nalive in me.\n\nHe put away his reading glasses.\n\n“There’s an element of your parents embedded in you, from the early days of your life,” he said. “Whether you’re proud of it, or ashamed of it, or don’t want to acknowledge it, that’s the case.”\n\nDuring the rest of the hour, he delved into the Old Testament. He talked about the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit, the Danish philosopher Kierkegaard, the Big Bang theory, Moses, the Israelites and manna.\n\n“Which in my opinion is the perfect food,” he said. “In the South, we call it grits.”\n\nHe read from the Bible — a verse about nation against nation, city against city — and wound his way back to the main question for the day, a question that seems every bit as relevant today: What kind of person do you want to be?\n\nNot do you want to be a doctor, lawyer, farmer, businessman or — although he didn’t say this last part, it seemed unspokenly obvious — president of the United States.\n\nThat's not what God said is important.\n\nHe gestured with clasped hands.\n\n“God said in effect: What kind of person do you want to be? A kind person? A gentle person? An honest person? A person who believes in justice and freedom, a person that believes &mldr;”\n\nSomeone in the pews yelled out something.\n\nCarter smiled.\n\n“We’re not going to get into politics this morning,” he said.\n\nHe continued, saying this is a choice we all have. To be a little Christ. The disciple James said if we live a life without purpose, without happiness or joy, it’s our fault.\n\nHe paused and asked everyone to bow their heads for a closing prayer.\n\n“Oh, Father we are grateful for a chance to pause every now and then and think about our lives &mldr;”\n\nHe finished the prayer, thanked everyone for coming and sat down by Rosalynn and his children.\n\nNearly everyone in the church stayed put, I suspect largely because they wanted a photo. As a church member explained beforehand, if you want a photo with the Carters, you have to stay not just for Sunday school, but for the service afterward.\n\nWhen that ends, she said, the Carters will sit in front of the church. Have your camera or phone ready. Hand it to the person who will be taking the pictures. Stand next to the Carters. No autographs. No stories. The goal is to move things along quickly.\n\nThere are thousands of photos like this.\n\nI imagine them put together in one of those flip books. the Carters in the same spot, aging as the years pass, the people next to them changing, the fashions changing.\n\nWe stayed for the service. So now, like tens of thousands of other people, we have one of those photos. I just wish I could show it to my father and tell him how in 2020, I took another drive to Georgia. How after I went to the woods near where FDR died, I went to the town where Jimmy Carter still lives."
