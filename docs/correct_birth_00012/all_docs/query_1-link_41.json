        "text": "Born in the small Georgia town of Plains, humble peanut farmer Jimmy Carter rose quickly through the local and national political ranks. He was elected to serve as a state senator and then Georgia’s governor before becoming the nation’s 39th president — the first and only from the Peach State.\n\nBut Carter’s commitment to service didn’t stop when he left the Oval Office. He remained active in several humanitarian causes, winning a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his work with the Atlanta-based nonprofit The Carter Center.\n\nExperience his life and legacy with this itinerary through Jimmy Carter’s Georgia.\n\nPlains\n\nStart your journey at the Plains Visitor Information Center, which displays mementos and photos of President Carter, including a cardboard cutout of the president — perfect for selfies. Then, head downtown to visit the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park, a trio of historical buildings where Carter spent his childhood. Carter’s alma mater, Plains High School, serves as the park’s visitors center and museum.\n\nTour the former school, with period-appropriate rooms restored to how they looked when Carter walked the halls, and exhibits about his life in Plains. Then take an Insta-worthy picture with his Oval Office desk — it’s an exact replica! — and see Carter’s original artwork (painting was a favorite hobby of the artistic former president) along with one of his three Grammy Awards.\n\nFrom there, visit the second stop in the historical park — The Plains Depot. The town’s train station until 1951, the depot served as the headquarters for Carter’s 1976 presidential run. The small, white clapboard building now houses memorabilia like buttons and signs from that era.\n\nFor a quick bite to eat, walk half a block to Buffalo Cafe along the same streets Carter and his family strolled over the years as longtime Plains residents. Located in a former bank building, the casual eatery features a menu of hearty burgers and sandwiches as well as Southern favorites like fried green tomatoes.\n\nIf you’re craving something sweet, buy a pack of peanut brittle or peanut soft serve at Plain Peanuts to snack on while browsing the local antique shops. You may just spot vintage Carter campaign buttons and other collectibles.\n\nOr meander through the downtown butterfly garden, one of the stops on the Rosalynn Carter Butterfly Trail, the former First Lady’s project to provide habitats for pollinators.\n\nNext, hop on Highway 280 for a few short minutes to tour the third spot in the Jimmy Carter National Historic Park, The Boyhood Farm. You’ll find tomatoes, corn and peanuts still growing there today. Carter’s boyhood home is preserved as it was in 1937, and the farm is still home to all manner of animals, including charming goats, clucking chickens and the buzz of honeybees. You can even take a self-guided audio tour narrated by Carter himself.\n\nBook a room at the Plains Historic Inn to immerse yourself fully in the small-town, presidential experience. The hotel’s seven suites are each furnished from a specific decade between 1920 and 1980, the eras of Carter’s illustrious political career.\n\nFinally, drive by the Carters’ modest ranch home on Woodland Drive — the only home he and Rosalynn ever owned — where you can imagine him digging its fly-fishing pond and relaxing under a magnolia tree transported from the White House lawn. Say farewell on your way out of town by snapping a picture of the smiling peanut statue, a whimsical art installation of the town’s favorite legume adorned with Carter’s signature grin.\n\nAmericus\n\nKnown for its charming historical downtown, this small city just east of Plains is dotted with shops and restaurants. It’s also the operational headquarters of Habitat for Humanity, one of President Carter’s favorite charities.\n\nPower up for your day exploring this slice of southwest Georgia with a fruity blueberry muffin or decadent mini coffee cake from Sweet Georgia Bakery and Cafe. They serve java — including coffee by the pound — from Cafe Campesino Coffee Roastery, a 100% Fair Trade, organic roastery based in Americus, too. Ask for the Carter Butterfly Trail Roast, named for the former First Lady’s passion project.\n\nThen, drive east to nearby Georgia Veterans State Park on Lake Blackshear to climb aboard the Presidential Flyer SAM Shortline Railroad, a two-hour journey between the region’s most notable Carter landmarks. Soak in the scenery in the comfort of vintage, climate-controlled rail cars with large viewing windows. The ride includes stops in Plains as well as the site of his boyhood home.\n\nAfter the trip, venture back to Americus for a shopping excursion, starting at The Kinnebrew Co. Founded in 1947, this landmark shop is loved by Southern ladies and gentlemen for its custom clothing and deep Americus ties, including to Georgia Southwestern State University (an alma mater of Carter’s).\n\nSpend the afternoon strolling the city’s antique shops and boutiques — many of them stocked with Carter-era memorabilia — and then grab dinner at Rosemary & Thyme, an elegant restaurant housed inside the majestic Windsor Hotel. A favorite of President Carter, the five-story, Victorian-era hotel boasts luxurious guest rooms, including the Carter Presidential Suite.\n\nBook a room to freshen up in after dinner before catching a show at the Rylander Theatre, a 1920s-era venue that hosts live music, theater and other performing arts. It even has an auditorium that bears Carter’s name.\n\nAtlanta\n\nPresident Carter was born and raised in southwest Georgia, but he spent much of his political and humanitarian careers in the state’s capital city, Atlanta. Learn more about his post-presidential legacy at the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum, an award-winning museum situated on 35 acres of landscaped grounds with permanent exhibits dedicated to Carter’s life and career.\n\nStep into a life-sized replica of the Oval Office to watch a “Day in the Life of the President” video projected on 13-foot-tall screens. Then, browse a collection of unique artifacts, like Carter’s original Nobel Peace Prize, presidential papers, a medieval crown from Hungary and one-of-a-kind gifts for heads of state. As you leave, you’ll see his namesake nonprofit The Carter Center just next door.\n\nFor lunch, motor down the street to Manuel’s Tavern, a legendary pub where Carter announced his run for governor in 1970 and a gathering spot for political enthusiasts, journalists, actors and other notable Atlantans. The straightforward menu includes starters like wings and nachos, plus sandwiches, soups and salads. Try the half-pound beef McCloskey cheeseburger, named for a long-time employee, and sample a beer from a local brewery.\n\nThen, head a few miles downtown to the Georgia State Capitol, the iconic gold-domed building where Carter worked as a state senator and later governor. The grounds feature a statue of President Carter, while the inside galleries include a portrait of Carter and state artifacts like historical flags and artwork.\n\nFrom there, drive north to Buckhead for a public tour of the Governor’s Mansion, where Carter lived during his tenure.\n\nThen, drive down the street to the Atlanta History Center, which has rotating and permanent exhibits that chronicle the city’s history from Indigenous inhabitants to contemporary times — including Carter’s presidency and the 1996 Olympic games. The museum has an on-site coffee shop and cafe, plus a manicured campus and historical buildings, including the Renaissance revival-style Swan House, featured prominently in movies like \"The Hunger Games.\" Fun fact: In 1973, Carter founded Georgia’s first state film commission, which kicked off the state’s growing film industry."
