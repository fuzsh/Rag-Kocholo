        "text": "PLAINS, Ga. (WALB) - A total of 46 people have held the highest office in our nation, but many in Plains say they admire former president Jimmy Carter most. And one day after the one-year mark of Jimmy Carter entering hospice care, people thought there was no better place to celebrate the 39th president than at his historical national park.\n\n“It’s a day that we celebrate all of the presidents of our wonderful nation and all the work they’ve done for us,” said Reed Elliotte, a program attendee.\n\nElliotte is one of the youngest aspiring presidents and said he was blessed to have met his inspiration Jimmy Carter before he went into hospice care a year ago.\n\n“I said Mr. Jimmy, you’re my favorite president, and thank you for all you do and I love you and I pray for you every day. He said thank you very much. That’s very kind,” he said.\n\nJust a day after the 1-year mark of the former president’s decision, people are choosing to reflect on his many achievements this Presidents’ Day.\n\n“He was the fifth in line of succession of five Navy presidents from 1961 to 1981. Of course, we’re so happy that he is still here with us and you know he never ceases to amaze us,” said Larry Cook, a presidential historian. “Jimmy Carter had a prolific naval career in his time in the Navy including nuclear training.”\n\nCook said Carter was selected to head up a team in Canada and prevent a nuclear meltdown. He says at such a young age, Jimmy Carter saved Canada — a fact not many know about.\n\n“He’s truly a global hero and he’s certainly well known in Canada for that,” he said.\n\nJan Williams, a Plains resident, knows the Carters as neighbors and good friends. She said while she hasn’t seen Jimmy Carter in months, she knows he’s honored to be the oldest living former president.\n\n“To be honest with you, I did not think he would still be here this President’s Day because of hospice coming in but he’s very determined,” she said.\n\nWilliams tries to honor Jimmy Carter every day by living the way that he and Rosalynn exemplified throughout their whole lives.\n\n“One of his favorite sayings was ‘If you’ll just love the person in front of you, the world would be a better place.’ And I try every day to make somebody’s life a little better,” she said.\n\nThroughout the long line of our nation’s leaders, Lee Kinnamon, the Americus mayor, said it’s important to honor them as human beings.\n\n“Their character is formed in particular circumstances. We tend to see them as abstractions written about in history books we read when we’re in school. But they’re real people, flesh and blood,” he said.\n\nTo stay up to date on all the latest news as it develops, follow WALB on Facebook and X (Twitter).\n\nHave a news tip or see an error that needs correction?
