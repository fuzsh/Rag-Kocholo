        "text": "Former president Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the United State, was born on October 1, 1924 in rural Georgia. After serving as president from 1977 to 1981, he and his wife Rosalynn Carter returned to their hometown of Plains, where they have lived ever since.\n\nHe didn't want to \"capitalize financially on being in the White House,\" he said in 2018, instead choosing to focus on humanitarian efforts. The former peanut farmer and Navy man shared, \"it just never had been my ambition to be rich.\"\n\nHe's been an ex-president longer than anyone else in history; Carter became the oldest living former president in American history on his 95th birthday three years ago, and he makes history every single day. \"I think the best explanation for [a long life] is to marry the best spouse: someone who will take care of you and engage and do things to challenge you and keep you alive and interested in life,\" Carter said in 2019. Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter have been married for 78 years.\n\nAs Jimmy Carter celebrates his 99th birthday this weekend while in hospice care, we look back on the best photos of him throughout his life.\n\nCarter was admitted to the U.S. Naval Academy in 1943.\n\n\"When I was five years old, if anybody asked me what I wanted to do in the future, I would say I want to go to the Naval Academy and be a naval officer. My daddy was a first lieutenant in the First World War, and my uncle—my favorite uncle, my youngest brother of my mother, was in the Navy. And he traveled in the Philippines and Japan and China and so forth and sent me a lot of mementos and letters back,\" Carter later recalled. \"So between the two, between West Point and Annapolis, which was the only two free universities we knew about in those days, I chose Annapolis. So that was my longtime commitment.\"\n\nAfter graduation, Carter was assigned to the U.S.S. Wyoming, where he worked for two years and then transferred to the submarine force during the Korean war.\n\n\"I was in battleships first which did experimental gun programs. And I was the electronics officer and the photography officer. And that was on two battleships, the Wyoming and the Mississippi,\" he shared. \"And then I went in the submarine force and I was in the Pacific almost all the time.\""
