        "text": "Not every town in this country can be recognized as the hometown of a United States President and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate. However, Plains, Georgia, can. Plains has an interesting history and is proud of its past as well as its present achievements. Whether you are a Carter enthusiast, a researcher, or just curious how a small town influenced a young boy who would become the president of the most powerful nation in the world, odds are you will find a visit to the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park interesting. The history and culture of this rural community can provide a look into why the Carters’ ties to Plains, Georgia, have endured the stresses of public life, yet remain as strong as they were decades ago.\n\nSite includes Plains High School, the Jimmy Carter Boyhood Farm, the Plain Train Depot and the Plains Historic District.\n\nJimmy and Rosalynn Carter have joined their hometown in developing the Plains Historic Inn & Antiques Mall. Located on historic Main Street, they now invite you to step back in time and enjoy the accommodations of one of seven period suites, authentically furnished from the 1920s to 1980s. Every room is a history lesson!\n\nEach suite includes a private bath, cable TV, free wireless internet in an accessible, smoke-free environment, as well as exclusive use of the great room and balcony furnished with rocking chairs overlooking the historic square! Each morning wake up to a light complimentary continental breakfast before enjoying the well-appointed antique mall downstairs.\n\nStep back in time on Georgia’s “Rolling State Park.” The SAM Shortline Excursion Train is an unmatched travel experience for you, friends and family. Georgia’s only rolling state park combines the rich history of the area and classic railroad travel with pleasure and relaxation. The vintage train cars vary in ambiance but all provide climate-controlled comfort and large windows to view the passing Southwest Georgia scenery. Two new luxury private cars have now been added to the train to provide a vantage point you’ll find nowhere else.\n\nYour destination, Plains, Americus or Archery-depending on the trip, is rich in history."
