Mr. President, I rise to recognize a milestone in the extraordinary life of one of America's most distinguished statesmen, former President Jimmy Carter, who celebrates his 75th birthday today. Twenty-three years ago, in the turbulent aftermath of Watergate, Americans yearned for a leader of honesty and integrity who would steward the country into an uncertain future. We found that man in James Earl Carter, Jr., a submariner and farmer-turned-Georgia-Governor who we elected our 39th President. President Carter served very honorably and ably during his term in office, earning distinction for diplomatic successes such as overseeing in the signing of the Panama Canal Treaty and the Camp David Accords. And in his 19 years since leaving office, President Carter has demonstrated himself to be one of the world's great humanitarians. In 1982, he founded the Carter Center--a nonprofit, nonpartisan center dedicated to promoting democracy, human rights, and conflict- resolution throughout the world. The center's work has been remarkable. In the past two decades--whether fighting to eradicate Guinea worm disease, thwarting conflict in Haiti, or helping to free political prisoners across the globe--President Carter has carved out a deserved reputation as one of the most active, humane, and accomplished ex- Presidents in American history. President Carter talked candidly about his Presidential legacy and his gratifying years after office in a profile recently written by White House correspondent Trude B. Feldman to commemorate his 75th birthday. To pay tribute to one of America's eminent leaders, I ask that Ms. Feldman's article be printed in the Record. The article follows: [From Los Angeles Times Syndicate International] President Carter at 75 (By Trude B. Feldman) Atlanta, Ga.--Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter turns 75 on October 1st and says he is in good shape and determined not to let aging get the better of him. In an interview to mark the milestone, he adds: ``My health is fine. I've had a full and gratifying life, but now is the best time of all.'' Does the energetic Carter feel 75 years of age? ``Not really,'' he tells me. ``I feel young. I'm still doing the same things I did twenty years age. I haven't given up active sports, although I cut back on some. I run fewer miles a day and play less tennis. In softball, my pitch is as accurate as ever, but I have little power in my drives, and base running is slower. Still, I don't feel tired and worn out. I continue to explore new opportunities, so I don' feel I'm growing old. But I do know what the calendar says.'' Twenty years ago when Carter turned 55, October 1st, by striking coincidence, fell on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism. Reflecting on that unusual concurrence in 1979, then President Carter told me: ``Reassessment of the past and plans for the future are important on one's birthday. So all the more important when a birthday falls on the same day as Yom Kippur--a supreme moral and spiritual moment, a time to take stock of one's personal life as well as to evaluate one's role in society . . . We all need a new spirit, a new heart . . . and we can do better by reviewing our past . . . to discover where we went wrong.'' America's 39th president, Jimmy Carter lost his re-election bid in 1980 to Ronald Reagan, and was ``devastated, disappointed and frustrated'' at not being able to complete his goals. Two years later, with his disappointment diverted by the writing of his memoir, Carter reverted to his passion for the power of positive thinking, and established, with his wife Rosalynn, The Carter Center, within which he could pursue some of the programs and interests that ``were interrupted when I was forced into involuntary retirement.'' The Carter Center, located on 30 acres of a now landscaped hill in Atlanta, from which General William Tecumseh Sherman watched the fledgling city burn in 1864, consists of The Carter Presidential Library and Museum and The Carter Center in four linked circular pods. It is governed by an independent Board of Trustees and yet is a part of Emory University. It brings people and resources together to resolve conflict, promote peace, democracy, and human rights, as well as to fight disease, hunger, poverty, and oppression worldwide. It was at The Carter Center that President William J. Clinton last month presented, separately to Rosalynn and Jimmy Carter, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America's highest civilian honor. ``They have done more good things for more people in more places than any other couple,'' Clinton stated. ``The work they do through this extraordinary Center to improve our world is unparalleled in our Nation's history . . . Their journey is one of love and faith, and this Center has been their ministry.'' Clinton also remarked that to call Jimmy Carter the greatest former president in history, as many have, doesn't do justice either to him or his work. ``For, in a real sense, this Carter Center . . . is a continuation of the Carter presidency,'' he said. ``The work he did in his four years (1977-81) in the White House not only broke important new ground, it is still playing a large role in shaping today's world.'' In accepting the Medal, Carter told the assembled guests-- family and friends--that President Clinton's words made him ``almost speechless with emotion,'' and he described the event as ``one of the most beautiful of my life.'' Carter went on to say that he and Rosalynn find much satisfaction in The Carter Center, and that it has given them, in effect, a new life, a life of pleasure, challenge, adventure, and unpredictability. ``We have formed close relationships with people in small villages in Africa, and those hungry for freedom and democracy in Indonesia, Haiti, Paraguay, and other countries,'' he stated. ``We try to bring them the blessings of America in an unofficial, but personal way.'' He added that he and Rosalynn visited some 115 foreign countries and learned about the people--their despair, hopelessness and lack of self respect. ``We also learned that close relations are necessary between governments throughout the world and civilian organizations--non-governmental ones like The Carter Center.'' During his birthday interview, I asked Carter if his 75 years were his to live over (again), what would he have done differently? ``As for my life in the White House, the one thing I would have handled differently is the hostage crisis,'' he says. ``From a human aspect, it was the most infuriating experience of my presidency. And had I been successful in rescuing the 52 American hostages in Iran, I believe I would have been re- elected president. ``I don't feel grieved that I lost the second term, but what I would have done differently during that ordeal is to send one more helicopter to the desert, one which would have likely resulted in a successful rescue operation.'' In Nov. 1979, after the Islamic Revolution in Iran, and one year before Carter's defeat for re-election, radical students seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took some 66 Americans as hostages. Although some were subsequently released, 52 were held captive for 444 days--till the end of Carter's presidency. On April 24, 1980, he ordered a covert snatch operation to pluck them out of the embassy. During the operation, two aircraft collided in a desert staging area, killing eight servicemen. In Nov. 1980, the militants relinquished the hostages to the Iranian government. With Algeria acting as an intermediary, a deal was finally struck as Carter's presidency was ending. The hostages were released at noon-- U.S. time--on Jan. 20, 1981, just as Carter turned over the U.S. government to its 40th president, Ronald Reagan. When the freed hostages arrived in Wiesbaden, Germany, Carter was there to greet them; and today, he still remembers each of their names, knows their whereabouts and remains in touch with most of them. And they still show their appreciation to him, emotionally, for the political toll that his ``wisdom and patience'' meant for their ultimate safe release. ``I often think about that ordeal,'' Carter says. ``From the outset I felt responsible for their well being. And I remain convinced that the wisest course for a strong nation, [[Page 23582]] when confronted with a similar challenge, should be one of caution and restraint.'' As to what he would have done differently in his personal life, Carter says his marriage to Rosalynn has been the best thing that happened to him. ``So, even though she didn't accept my first proposal, I would not have married any differently,'' he adds. ``Rosalynn is the only woman I ever loved. We married 53 years ago and are still bound together with increasing bonds as we grow older and need each other more. When we're apart for even a day, I have the same hollow feeling of loneliness as when I was at sea (in the Navy) early in our marriage. Now, in our golden years, our primary purpose is not just to stay alive, but to savor each opportunity for fulfillment.'' Carter admits that, yes, they still argue, but are mature enough not to dwell on disputes, and after a cooling off period, they either ignore their differences or reason with each other. They are close to their three sons, Jack, 52; James Earl 3d (Chip), 49; and Jeffrey, 47; and daughter, Amy. Their ten grandchildren are ``an indescribable blessing . . .''--the most recent one born July 29 to Amy and her husband. Carter muses: ``You remember Amy. She was like a separate family for us because she was born when our youngest son was 15 years old. I think that made her special in the minds of people around the world who knew her as a nine year old child in the White House. Now they see her as a 31 year old mother and realize they, too, are now 22 years older. So Amy is a kind of measuring stick for about how much we all have aged.'' Also remembered for having brought a child's book to read at a State Dinner, Amy Carter told me that celebrating her dad's 75th birthday means a lot to her because she looks up to him as ``very special'' and one who has always been there for her. ``Dad has always made me feel like I was his priority,'' she says. ``When we lived in the White House, there wasn't a door I couldn't open or a meeting I couldn't interrupt, if it was important that I talk with him. ``He is also wonderful at telling people that he cares about them. That trait is what I hope I have inherited from him.'' She adds: ``I'm also grateful that when I was young, he shared with me his love of books because reading has been such a pleasure, and I intend to pass that on to my son. I have fond memories of sitting on my dad's lap while he would help me sound out words in the newspapers. ``There are other nice memories, but one of the least well- known things about my dad is one of the greatest--he has a hilarious and unflinchingly sarcastic sense of humor . . . often directed at himself. Days later, I will suddenly remember something he said, and I laugh out loud. He is still a lot of fun.'' Amy's grandmother, Allie Smith, who will celebrate her 94th birthday on Christmas, has known Jimmy Carter since he was born. (The Carters lived next door to the Smiths until the Carters moved to a farm when Rosalynn Smith was one year old.) ``I've watched Jimmy as a boy and as a man, and especially when he began courting Rosalynn,'' Mrs. Smith told me. ``He was a handsome midshipman, and I was pleased when they married. ``At first, he was pretty dominant, but over the years, he and Rosalynn developed into equal partners. Now they share almost everything. Watching them grow older together has been a blessing to me. Jimmy is a fine son in law, just like one of my own sons. He has always worked hard and has been a success in whatever he did.'' What is it that drives Jimmy Carter to care about other human beings to the extent that he now does? ``What I do now is what I've done most of my life--to take my talents, abilities, and opportunities and make the most of them,'' he responds. ``It is exciting, challenging, and adventurous. I try new things, go to different countries, make new friends and take on various projects for The Carter Center. I don't consider my activities a sacrifice because they are all personally satisfying.'' Asked if the satisfactions are that good, he says, ``Yes, they really are. I am not exaggerating. And what also drives me to stay busy is that I know the time will come--because of health reasons or because of deterioration, physically and mentally--when I will have to somewhat back off. For now, I'm still as aggressive, active, and innovative as I was years ago, and this is the kind of life I enjoy.'' Rosalynn Carter, who joins her husband in most of his activities and travels, and shares his work at The Carter Center, says that several things drive him. ``As a boy, Jimmy worked on the family farm with his father, who was a taskmaster,'' she recalls. ``Later, in the Navy, he worked for Admiral (Hyman) Rickover, who had a major influence on him. The Admiral was a driving force, demanded long hours and perfection, and wouldn't waste a moment. ``With that background and the Navy discipline, Jimmy always tried to make his life count for something. He has been given extraordinary opportunities, and he wants to use them . . . As a governor and president, he saw the enormity of the world's problems, and has been driven by his faith and his belief that he needs to help less fortunate people.'' Terrence B. Adamson, Senior Vice President for Law, Business & Governmental Affairs of the National Geographic Society, met Carter in 1968 when Terry was a high school senior and Carter was a State Senator in the Georgia General Assembly. Now a close confidant, Adamson says that Carter's love of humanity and of God is what drives him. ``His basic Judaic Christian underpinning is at his core,'' he adds. ``Awards and accolades and wealth aren't important to him. He has grown comfortable with The Carter Center as his legacy--as a viable ongoing institution pursuing advances in health and democracy.'' Asked what has motivated Carter in his post presidency, Adamson's response is that Carter is no different now in his core beliefs and values from when he was president. ``Of course, he has matured and grown wiser,'' he says. ``But in 1976, he was a sudden entrant on the national scene, not well-known. Over the past 18 years, he has validated, by his conduct, the values he espoused during his presidency. At the time, they were too frequently seen by a cynical public soured by the Watergate scandals as just the mouthings of another politician.'' Perhaps Jimmy Carter, an idealist and a realist, was President of the United States before his time. In his final Oval Office interview in Jan. 1981, President Carter told me that he agreed with President Kennedy that no matter what you expect before you become president, there is nothing that prepares you for the difficulties, complexities, or satisfactions of the job. ``Sitting and working in this office is awesome, but I never felt overcome by it,'' he then said. ``I tried to minimize the trappings so that people would be comfortable and not intimidated. I always wanted frank assessments of what was going on around me so I would be aware of the attitude people had towards me and my administration. I liked this job of being President. I didn't find it toilsome. I discovered that when problems were the most severe, that is when my advisers were most often split 50-50 with their advice. And the solution was left to me, as President.'' Regarding the qualities a president should have, Carter says: ``A willingness to work hard, a sense of the importance of the office historically and a sense of the common good and general welfare, above and beyond specific interests and pressures.'' He adds that a president's responsibilities are constant because something is always happening in some part of the world with which he must concern himself. ``In an emotional, intellectual, and, in some ways, a physical sense, the job is very taxing,'' he relates. ``But so are other important, worthwhile positions which involve much pressure, effort, and conscientiousness.'' What specifically had Carter learned from his presidency? ``One thing I learned is that an incumbent president discovers that there are no answers which make everyone happy,'' he replies. ``And sometimes there are no answers that make anyone happy.'' Carter went on to say that, had he merely wanted to get rich, he would have remained in the peanut warehouse business or pursued other business opportunities. ``But I've never cared about financial gain. I've always cared about the people in our country and the world,'' he says. ``I wanted to make a difference in people's lives and wanted to change--for the better--the world situation.'' When asked how he wants history to regard his presidency, Carter puts it this way: ``As one who did my best to act in the long-term interest of America, and one who did so with an understanding of--but without too great a consideration of-- whatever adverse political consequences might flow from it . . . ``You know, the presidency has enriched my life in that I am a better man for having served. And in all humility, I hope that America will consider itself a better place because of my service as president.'' In Carter's view, what were the misconceptions of him? ``First, when I was a presidential candidate, I think many people underestimated my tenacity and determination,'' he reflects. ``There were some formidable candidates, including (former Senators) Hubert Humphrey, Henry Jackson, Mo (Morris K.) Udall, Edmund Muskie, Frank Church, and Birch Bayh. They too, underestimated how hard I would work and my desire to win. That was one misassessment of me. ``As President, some people got the impression that I was weak because I didn't send armed forces into battle and didn't bomb or fire missiles at anyone. When there was a serious problem, I tried to work it out through negotiation and mediation, and peaceful, patient policies. I spent much time working on the Panama Canal Treaties, the Mid East Peace process, normalizing relations with China, and helping Rhodesia become an independent nation in southern Africa. ``So, because I was working for peace, emphasizing human rights and not launching missile attacks, the perception was promoted by some that I was weak and not a strong, macho president.'' [[Page 23583]] However, former President Gerald R. Ford, who in 1976 lost the Presidency to Jimmy Carter, told me that President Carter had earned high marks in foreign diplomacy in his White House years. ``Today, he should be highly complimented for his continuing leadership in foreign policy under the auspices of The Carter Center,'' Mr. Ford adds. ``America has had an excellent diplomat in Jimmy Carter on a global basis.'' And President Clinton recently stated that Carter's noteworthy foreign policy accomplishments include the Panama Canal treaties, the Camp David Accords, the Treaty of Peace between Egypt and Israel, the Salt II treaty with the Soviet Union, and the establishment of U.S. diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. ``. . . And I was proud to have Carter's support when we worked together to bring democracy back to Haiti and to preserve stability on the Korean Peninsula,'' Clinton observed. ``I'm grateful for the detailed incisive reports he sent me from his trips to troubled nations all across the globe, always urging understanding of their problems and their points of view, always outlining practical steps to progress.'' Further citing Carter's influence, Clinton said, ``Any elected leader in Latin America today will tell you that the stand Jimmy Carter took for democracy and human rights in Latin America put America on the right side of history in our hemisphere. He was the first president to put America's commitment to human rights squarely at the heart of our foreign policy. Today, more than half of the world's people live in freedom, not least because he had the faith to lend American support to brave dissidents like Andrei Sakharov, Vaclav Havel, and Nelson Mandela. And there were thousands of less well known political prisoners languishing in jails in the 1970's who were sustained by a smuggled news clipping of Carter championing their cause.'' Rosalynn Carter concurs with her husband about the misconceptions of him, namely that working for peace and human rights gave the impression of weakness. ``War is popular,'' she notes, ``but peace takes time, often with an appearance of inaction.'' Another misconception, she adds, is that he was not an affective president, ``But I think so much attention was paid to problems that were not of his making, that people were unaware of how much was accomplished,'' she says citing, for instance, the oil crisis that caused the inflation that he inherited and that only began to improve as he left the presidency. ``Yet,'' Mrs. Carter concludes, ``despite the misconceptions, history will treat him well . . . as one of America's best presidents.'' Jimmy Carter's clout continues to span some of today's headlines. In the controversy surrounding President Clinton's conditional commutation of the sentence of the Puerto Rican activists, White House aides defend his decision by singling out Carter's support of the President's clemency. Carter considers the pardon a correct decision, but is surprised at the attention focused on his support. He says that he did not personally contact President Clinton on the matter, but that 2 years ago he wrote letters about it to Attorney General Janet Reno. He points out that some of the interest in Clinton's pardon of the Puerto Ricans has been heightened by the fact that his pardon power ``has rarely been exercised'' during his Presidency. For some 6 years, Carter has pursued--directly with President Clinton--a presidential pardon for Patty Hearst, the newspaper heiress. As President, Carter commuted her sentence for bank robbery to the approximately 2 years she had served. But he has long believed that Hearst, who was kidnapped and brutalized by radicals in 1974 as a college student, should receive a presidential pardon because of the ``model'' life she has led for the 20 years since her prison release. Of special concern to Carter today is the chaos and violence in East Timor. He had traveled to Indonesia twice this year, as recently as in July, to lead an international delegation to observe the national election after 38 years of military dictatorship in the world's most populous country-- striving to be the third most populous democracy. He says that The Carter Center was also involved, at Indonesia president B.J. Habibi's invitation, in monitoring the August election on independence in East Timor. And his recent personal involvement has contributed to the United Nations peacekeeping mission to East Timor. Even while a resident in the White House, Carter was not impressed with the trappings of pomp and circumstance that surrounded the presidency. He brought informality to the Executive Mansion. He would often carry his own luggage to and from helicopters. Also, when he saw how members of the media were ``contained'' behind ropes while covering his events, he would often walk over and remove the iron chain or untie the ropes. Yet, Carter's National Security Adviser, Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski, now Counselor at The Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS), says that the mass media were extremely unfair regarding President Carter's tenure . . . his performance as former President should generate a reassessment of his presidency.'' Thomas P. (``Tip'') O'Neill, former Speaker of the House of Representatives, once said that when it comes to understanding the issues of the day, Jimmy Carter is the ``smartest pubic official I knew--the range and extent of his knowledge are astounding. He can speak with authority on almost any topic.'' Carter, who has been knighted in Mali and made an honorary tribal chief in Nigeria and Ghana, singles out international human rights as his greatest foreign policy achievement. ``Before I was president, the only president who had emphasized human rights to any degree was Harry Truman,'' Carter notes. ``Now, much attention is paid to global human rights . . . so I hope my legacy as President will include protection of human rights.'' Secretary of State Madelein Albright, who worked in the Carter White House as a staff member of the National Security Council, told me that President Carter created an outstanding foreign policy record. ``He put human rights at center state, and the principle has stood the test of time,'' she says. ``Those who worked for him reflect those achievements with great pride. And not only does he have the respect of Americans, but of citizens throughout the world.'' Today, Jimmy Carter says he is convinced that he made a difference--in the U.S. and abroad--a difference that is reflected in the work of The Carter Center, now in 35 different nations and Africa. ``In most of the 35 countries, the people see America as a country that may well be on a different planet--a rich, strong, arrogant, and self- satisfying country,'' he says. ``I represent The Carter Center at villages in backward nations in Africa and let the people know that the U.S. really cares about them; that they don't need to suffer from a particular disease, or that they can increase their production of coal, rice and wheat, or that they can find peace . . . for the first time.'' What difference has Carter made in Latin America, where his popularity is among the highest in the world? ``The primary difference is the result of my commitment to human rights,'' he responds. ``If you note the history of most of the Latin American countries, including Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaraqua, Panama, Columbia, Ecuador, Argentina, Chile, Brazil, and Paraquay, each had military dictatorships. When I became President, we impressed on the political leaders and private citizens the significance of basic human rights, democracy and freedom. Now, almost everyone of these countries is a democracy. America's commitments, public and private, are to promote human rights and demand them--not only for Americans but also for others.'' Argentina's Ambassador to the U.S. Diego Ramiro Dueler, has often publicly credited Carter for having saved his life, as well as the lives of many current leaders of Argentina. ``During my presidency, thousands of people in Argentina were imprisoned, disappeared while in jail, or were executed,'' Carter says, ``and no one yet knows what happened to them.'' He adds that his administration put pressure on the military dictators in Argentina, Chile, and others in Latin America that ultimately forced them to honor human rights and led to the development of democracy in the Americas. ``Frequently,'' Carter humbly notes, ``someone, now in business or government in Latin America, will approach me to say that he owes his life to my emphasis on human rights--and that's quite moving and gratifying.'' Robert M. Gates, former Director of the CIA under President George Bush, points out in his book, ``From the Shadows'' (Simon & Schuster, 1996) that Jimmy Carter's contribution to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War had been under appreciated. ``Carter was the first President during the Cold War to challenge publicly and consistently the legitimacy of Soviet rule at home,'' Gates writes. ``His (Carter's) human rights policy, building on the important and then largely unrecognized role of the Helsinki Final Act, by the testimony of countless Soviet and East European dissidents and future democratic leaders, challenged the moral authority of the Soviet government and gave American sanction and support of those resisting that government. . .'' Five years ago at The Carter Center, Richard H. Solomon, President of the U.S. Institute of Peace, presented Jimmy Carter its first Spark M. Matsunaga Medal of Peace. The Institute recognized his ``efforts to advance the cause of human rights by making it a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy'' and his ``leadership, determination, and personal diplomatic skills in concluding the Camp David Accords.'' On a par with his human rights accomplishments, Carter believes that another of his achievements was initiated at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains, which he made a household name. There, for 13 days and nights in Sept. 1978, Carter provided the mechanism by which Israel's Prime Minister Menachem Begin and [[Page 23584]] Egypt's President Anwar Sadat came together . . . ``to realize their own commitments and hopes.'' The intense summit--originally suggested by Rosalynn Carter--resulted in two agreements: establishing a framework for peace in the Mideast; and a framework for the conclusion of a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. Premier Begin and President Sadat were subsequently awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their joint achievement. Harold Saunders, then Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, says that the agreement at Camp David and the Peace Treaty ``could not have been achieved without President Carter's tenacity, his personal command of the issues and the relationships he developed with the two leaders and key members of their teams.'' On the second anniversary (1980) of the Camp David Accords, Carter told me that when the history books are written, one thing he hopes to see is that he, an American President-- representing the United States--``contributed successfully to the security of Israel on a permanent basis and to the peace in the Mideast between Israel and all her neighbors.'' Now, as Jimmy Carter reaches his 75th, birthday, I asked him about his vision for the next century. ``My vision for America is that, as the only unchallenged superpower in the world, it will become a true champion of the moral values that have made ours a great nation-- involving peace, freedom, democracy, human rights, environmental quality, and the alleviation of human suffering,'' he tells me. ``We should be known by everyone as dedicated to the peaceful resolution of disputes, both involving ourselves and others. If two antagonists are willing, especially among the poorer and more ignored nations, we should be ready and eager to provide assistance, in mediation or negotiation, and our government should reach out to non-governmental organizations to help.'' Carter notes, for instance, what the Norwegian government did with an academic group of social scientists to achieve the Oslo peace agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians. ``America should be just as eager to promote freedom and democracy among people now afflicted with totalitarian and abusive regimes,'' he adds. ``This issue should be on the table when our leaders have discussions with others.'' He adds that as a non-governmental organization, and with no authority at all, The Carter Center has many such requests each year, and is able to respond only to a few of the most compelling. Carter went on to say that the U.S. should always ``raise high the banner of human rights,'' and be as consistent as possible in the application of this policy. ``No other nation can take an effective lead in carrying out commitments made at the international environmental meeting (held in Rio de Janeiro) in eradicating land mines, in eliminating nuclear arsenals, in protecting the rights of children, or in establishing an effective international Criminal Court.'' He concludes: ``The most important single issue to be addressed in the next century is the widening gap between rich people and poor people, both within nations and between the richest and poorest countries. Few Americans know that all other industrialized nations are more generous than we in giving development assistance to the most needy people in the world. In fact, whenever a Norwegian gives a dollar, one of our citizens gives a nickel. To be generous to others would not be a financial sacrifice for us, but a great investment that would pay rich dividends.'' Born James Earl Carter, Jr. of English heritage on October 1st, 1924 in Wise Hospital, in Plains, Ga., Jimmy Carter was the first president to be born in a hospital. There was no running water or electricity in his home during his early childhood. At age 5, he was selling boiled peanuts to neighbors and friends. His father, a stern disciplinarian, often spanked him for wrong doings, like taking a penny from his church's collection plate, and for shooting his sister with a BB gun. Nicknamed ``Hot Shot,'' and then ``Hot,'' Jimmy Carter's behavior in elementary school was excellent. He was eager to learn almost anything, but his interests then were history and literature. At age 12, when a teacher told him about a book named WAR AND PEACE, he thought it was about cowboys and Indians. With his mother's urging, he became a book enthusiast, and has long been a speed reader. While in the Navy in 1951, Carter began to work for Hyman G. Rickover, who was leading America's nuclear submarine fleet. Carter had responsibility for building the nuclear power plant that would go into the second atomic submarine, the U.S.S. Sea Wolf. ``Admiral Rickover had a tremendous effect on my life,'' Carter says. ``He led the program that developed the world's first use of atomic power for peaceful uses, the production of electricity, and the propulsion of ships.'' When Rickover was past 80 and still in charge of the Navy's nuclear power program, President Carter awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And recently the Navy recognized Carter, a graduate of the Naval Academy, by naming a Seawolf-class submarine for him. Jimmy Carter cites three turning points in his long, dynamic and fruitful life: (1) In 1953, when he resigned from the Navy because of his father's death and returned home to run the family peanut warehouse business. (2) In 1962, when he first ran for public office--the State Senate in Georgia. And (3), in 1981, when he left the White House after one term as President of the United States. Looking back, does he still have regrets about losing his re-election bid? ``Well, yes, I do,'' he tells me. ``Anyone who is once elected President of the U.S. certainly prefers to have a second term. At first, there is the disappointment about the unfinished promise of your goals. When my four years ended, I was disheartened. I had not expected to be defeated and I had no plans, at a relatively young age, of how to utilize my time and be productive.'' Rosalynn Carter describes his defeat as a startling regret, adding: ``Although I now know that Jimmy is pleased that he had the opportunity to establish The Carter Center--because through it, much has been accomplished--he also believes that if he had been re-elected president, the Center, which has exceeded all of our expectations, probably never would have come into being.'' Reflecting on the changes--over the years--in his philosophy, Carter says, ``I think I've become more tolerant of opposing views, and I have learned to accommodate the opinions of people who disagree with me. One reason is that I'm not now in a competitive world. I can live side by side with those who think and act differently from me. I'm not competing with anyone for money, political office, or publicity.'' Carter, a lay preacher, adds: ``I'm also more broadminded about things not so narrowly defined in my religious philosophy. As you know, my basic religious faith has never changed. It has been fairly constant. As a Christian, I remain devout, and I read and teach the Bible. I feel an inner peace, an inner sense of commitment and calm that comes from my religious beliefs.'' In 1976, then Chicago's Mayor Richard Daley remarked: ``Jimmy Carter talks about true values. He also has a religious tone in what he says . . . and maybe we should have a little more religion in our communi- ties. . . .'' The Rev. Billy Graham--who remembers that Jimmy Carter predicted that he would be President before he even became a candidate--describes Carter as ``a man of faith and sterling integrity . . . who was one of our most diligent presidents-- persistent and painstaking in his attention to his responsibilities.'' In his book, JUST AS I AM (Harper Collins, 1997), Rev. Graham also writes that he respects Jimmy Carter's intelligence and his genuine and unashamed Christian commitment. ``After the disillusionment of Watergate, Americans were attracted by Carter's summons to a moral revival,'' Rev. Graham states . . . ``And other political leaders would do well to learn from his moral and spiritual ideals.'' Rosalynn Carter says that her husband has mellowed and is now more relaxed than she has ever seen him. ``Yet,'' she adds, ``I notice that he has become more concerned about the various problems in the world--more so than even before he was elected governor of Georgia (1970).'' One issue that Carter continues to be genuinely concerned about is the moral and spiritual crisis that has gripped America since before he was in the White House. ``In today's world, the main difference is that what was then referred to as `political malaise' is much worse,'' he says. ``As I stated twenty years ago in a speech on the crisis of confidence, that is even more relevant and pertinent today. Together, we need to commit ourselves to a rebirth of the American spirit. There is still a crisis of confidence, a crisis that strikes at the heart and soul and spirit of our national will. We see this crisis in the growing doubt about the meaning of our lives and in the loss of unity of purpose for our nation. The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and political fabric of America.'' How has the presidency evolved since Carter left the White House? ``There are major changes,'' he emphasizes. ``The presidency was once respected as a place of honor. I think our political community has deteriorated tremendously since Gerald Ford and I served as presidents, and we often talk about our concerns and those changes. Rather than politics as usual, strong leadership and honest answers are needed.'' He says that, for instance, as President, he had gotten along with the Republicans in the House and Senate; that he had often gotten the support of many Republicans on major legislation, sometimes even better than with the Democrats. ``Now, the two parties are bitterly divided, with little cooperation between them,'' he adds. ``Also, nowadays, the success of many political campaigns is predicated on how well you can damage the reputation of your opponent. That turns off the average citizen, and leads to a partisan and personally destructive situation. [[Page 23585]] He also points out that Congress continues to be pulled in all directions by well financed and powerful special interests. ``But we cannot change the course until we face the truth,'' he says. ``Restoring faith and confidence to America is now still our most important task . . . and now it is a solid, significant challenge.'' In recent years, Carter has given a lot of thought to the virtues of aging, especially as it relates to Social Security. He notes that in 1935, when Social Security legislation was passed, its purpose was to give older people a subsistence income. ``Today,'' he says, ``because of improvements in health and health care, many senior citizens are still in a position to contribute to society. We elderly should be allowed to work as long as we wish--or are able to.'' However, Carter voices concerns about the future of Social Security. ``The oldest baby boomer will start to receive Social Security in the year 2010,'' he notes. ``By the time my newest grandson, now two months old, is a middle aged wage earner, one in four Americans will be over 65.'' Emphasizing that our Social Security system is in trouble and that something will have to change, he recalls that when Social Security was established there were about 40 wage earners supporting each retiree with tax contributions. ``By 2010, only two persons will be paying for the retirement and medical expenses of one senior citizen,'' he says. ``We should be more vigilant and forceful in protecting those who are in need of financial assistance. Today, there are numerous senior citizens who cannot afford health care and many older citizens with little money, or whose savings are expended before their lives end.'' Carter says he tries to practice what he preaches. In his book, ``The Virtues of Aging'' (Times Books, 1998), he notes that the virtues of aging include the blessings that come as one grows older and what we have to offer that might be beneficial to others. ``Each of us is old when we think we are,'' he writes. ``When we accept an attitude of dormancy, dependence on others, a substantial limitation on our physical and mental activity, and restrictions on the number of people with whom we interact. . . . As I know from experience, this is not tied closely to how many years we live.'' He cites, as one example, his mother--a compassionate woman who always tried to help others. She joined the Peace Corps at age 68 in 1996 and served for two years in the village of Vikhroli, near Bombay, India. In Feb. 1977, Lillian Carter as First Mother revisited that village when she represented the U.S. at the funeral of India's President Ali Ahmed Fakhruddin. And during hundreds of speeches about her experiences in the Peace Corps, she encouraged others not to allow old age to put a limit on their lives. ``You know,'' Carter says, ``There is a huge difference between getting older and growing old.'' When my father died, my mother was 55 years old, past retirement age for most registered nurses. Yet she continued to age for 30 more years, but she never grew old. Until she died of cancer at age 85, she was full of life and determined to make each day a new adventure. ``Mother had the most influence over me, and was an inspiration for me. Except for Rosalynn, she affected my life more than any other person.'' If there is any secret to Carter's looking and feeling younger than his years, he reveals that perhaps it is because Rosalynn is a stickler for nutrition and an expert on ``exactly what we should or should not eat . . . and how much and when. . . . ``Then, I'm always exercising,'' he adds, ``and luck could also be a factor.'' For exercise and recreation, Carter keeps fit and trim by hiking, bicycling, cross-country skiing and bowling. He also jogs, fly fishes, does woodworking, cabinet making and plays tennis. Behind his home he built--by himself--a tennis court. (It was the topic of conversation with network commentators when he attended the recent Women's Finals of tennis' U.S. Open in New York). He also says that, so far, he and Rosalynn have been blessed with good health--``perhaps because of our various activities--living a diverse life, with different elements to it--that kind of life is less likely to be afflicted with illness.'' He adds: ``Today, we combine taking care of our farm with other activities. One nice aspect about having been president is that we have an unlimited menu because different people invite us to join in their projects, and now we are free to do what gives us pleasure. ``We have climbed mountains in Nepal, to the tops of Kilimajaro and Mt. Fuji. We visited game preserves in Tanzania and have become bird watchers.'' And as a hunter, Carter says he still tries to harvest two wild turkeys each year for his family's thanksgiving and Christmas meals. Jimmy Carter, the most visible member of Habitat for Humanity, also says that every year he goes to a different site to help build at least one house for a poor family. For one week, he works with the family and other volunteers. They start with a concrete slab and by week's end, they complete the job as a finished landscaped house. ``Habitat and I get a lot of publicity for each other even though I only work one week a year,'' he explains. ``But the satisfaction is great.'' Last year, he chose the Philippines, where he and two former and a current president of the Philippines joined together to build one house for a large family. In the same week, 293 other houses were built in the Philippines by some 10,000 volunteers. Asked if he considers himself a role model for other senior citizens, Carter says he believes that we all can learn from one another. ``With few exceptions,'' he says, ``anyone can find an exciting and fulfilling life after reaching retirement age. I think senior citizens who have setbacks or a surprising retirement--as I had--ought to analyze what they have and decide how to live a meaningful life. Sometimes, an unanticipated life, one you thought would be a disappointment, can turn out to be even better than the one you wanted to cling to. Carter sums up: ``As we get older, senior citizens need to avoid mental dormancy and keep our minds occupied. Mental and physical activities strengthen us and give us a foundation for successful aging. Even though my health is now good and I'm still active in sports, I am often reminded that I face inevitable changes in health as I grow older.'' All in all, does aging bother Jimmy Carter? ``Aging doesn't bother me--yet,'' he replies with a wry smile, ``but I'm already preparing for a reduced capacity. I expect to cut the time I devote to overseas work--from peace negotiations; to monitoring elections; to eradicating disease, to eliminating suffering . . . and then I can spend more time at home in Georgia. ``There is a leadership succession plan for The Carter Center, but any transition is a high priority of mine.'' For some 17 years, Carter has been a ``distinguished professor'' at Emory University, where he spends one week each month during the academic year. He lectures on numerous topics, including theology, medicine, journalism, creative writing, business, political science, history, and anthropology. He also meets with undergraduate and graduate students, adding a different kind of rigor to doctoral examinations. At times, he deals with current history--history that he himself helped to make. ____________________"
