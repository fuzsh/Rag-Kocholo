Christ said, 'I tell you that anyone who looks on a woman with lust has in his heart already committed adultery.'\n\n\"I've looked on a lot of women with lust. I've committed adultery in my heart many times. This is something that God recognizes I will do--and I have done it--and God forgives me for it.\""
