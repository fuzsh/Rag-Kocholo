        "text": "Introduction\n\n(born 1924). In November 1976 Jimmy Carter was elected the 39th president of the United States. His emphasis on morality in government and his concern for social welfare appealed to voters who were disturbed by corruption in government and economic problems. Carter served only one term as president but later continued to be active in public life. He worked to secure international peace and human rights and sought to end poverty and hunger around the world. Carter won the Nobel Prize for Peace in 2002.\n\nCarter’s vice president was Walter F. Mondale of Minnesota. In the presidential election of 1976, Carter and Mondale defeated Republican President, Gerald R. Ford, and his running mate, Senator Robert J. Dole of Kansas. Carter won about half of the popular vote and received 297 electoral votes from 23 states and the District of Columbia. Renominated in 1980, Carter received only 49 electoral votes from six states and the District. He lost to the Republican candidate, Ronald Reagan, in a landslide. Carter had been the first person reared in the Deep South to be elected president since pre-Civil War days.\n\nFamily and Early Life\n\nJames Earl Carter, Jr., was born on October 1, 1924, in Plains, a small town in southwestern Georgia. The first president born in a hospital, he was the first of four children of James Earl Carter (called Earl) and Lillian Gordy Carter (known as Miss Lillian). His sisters were Gloria and Ruth, and he had a brother, William (Billy).\n\nEarl Carter farmed in Archery, Georgia, where he also operated a small general store. When peanuts replaced cotton as the principal crop in southwestern Georgia in the 1930s, he began to buy peanuts from other farmers for processing into oil. Later Earl Carter operated a successful warehouse, selling seed and other farming supplies in Plains. He was strict with his children and required that they also work hard on the family farm.\n\nJimmy Carter’s mother was a registered nurse. She sometimes provided care for patients without pay.\n\nThe Carters were one of only two white families in Archery, a community of more than 25 Black families. Jimmy Carter’s coworkers in the fields and his playmates were the Black children of Archery. However, Carter attended an all-white school. Although the Carter family was middle-class, during much of his childhood they lived in a small house without plumbing or electricity.\n\nFrom an early age Jimmy Carter demonstrated the qualities that would later make him a successful farmer and businessman. As a boy, he sold peanuts in Plains. At the age of 9 he had saved enough money to buy five bales of cotton. Years later he sold the cotton at a greatly increased price. With his earnings he bought five tenant houses, which he rented.\n\nThe Carters were members of the Plains Baptist Church. Religion was a regular and important part of their lives. Later Jimmy Carter’s sister Ruth Carter became an evangelist. Jimmy Carter worked briefly in mission projects. He read widely in Christian theology and, a “born-again” Baptist deacon, made his religious beliefs public throughout his political career.\n\nEducation and Marriage\n\nCarter was the first member of his family to complete a high school education. He attended public schools for 11 years, the full program in rural Georgia at the time, and he graduated at the top of his class. One of the most important influences on him was a school superintendent who introduced him to the arts and to serious literature.\n\nPartly because of the influence of an uncle who was in the Navy, Carter decided while in high school that he wanted to attend the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. Since there were no immediate vacancies, in 1941–42 he attended Georgia Southwestern College, in Americus. In 1942 Carter received an appointment to Annapolis for the following year. In 1942–43 he attended the Georgia Institute of Technology, in Atlanta, where he enrolled in the Naval Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC). In 1943 Carter entered the Naval Academy.\n\nAs he had been in high school and in college, Carter was a serious student at Annapolis. He enjoyed military studies and training, but he did not always like the hazing that first-year students were subjected to. He sometimes took punishment rather than perform stunts he found demeaning. Carter participated in summer cruises in the closing years of World War II and graduated 59th in a class of 820 in 1946. He was commissioned an ensign.\n\nOn a visit to Plains before his final year at Annapolis, Carter renewed his acquaintance with Rosalynn Smith, the best friend of his sister Ruth. In the summer after his graduation they were married. Like her husband, Rosalynn Carter came from a family that had settled in Georgia in the late 1700s. Her father had died when she was 13. Two years later she began working in a beauty parlor to help her mother support the family. Later she attended Georgia Southwestern.\n\nJimmy Carter spent more than six years as a naval officer. Initially, he was an instructor in naval programs at Norfolk, Virginia, and worked on various projects, including experimental radar. In 1948 Carter was accepted for submarine duty. His first assignment was on the USS Pomfret in the Asia. In 1950 Carter was assigned as a senior officer for the USS K-1, the first ship built by the United States Navy after World War II. He worked on the design, installation, and testing of various parts of the submarine and qualified as a submarine commander.\n\nCarter then applied for the nuclear submarine program headed by Admiral Hyman Rickover. Carter has said that, next to his parents, Rickover was the most influential person in his life. He admired Rickover’s insistence on the highest standards for himself and his subordinates. Carter was made senior officer of Seawolf, one of the first two nuclear-powered submarines. He worked on the construction of the power plant for the vessel, studied reactor technology and nuclear physics, and was a naval instructor.\n\nBy the early 1950s Carter and his wife had three sons—John William (Jack), James Earl III (Chip), and Donnel Jeffrey (Jeff). Rosalynn Carter had followed her husband whenever possible on his various naval assignments. Their sons were born, respectively, in Virginia, Hawaii, and Connecticut. Carter had risen to the rank of lieutenant, and a brilliant naval career seemed to be ahead of him.\n\nReturn to Georgia\n\nIn 1953 Carter’s father, then a member of the Georgia House of Representatives, died. Carter was moved by the outpouring of admiration and affection for his father from people throughout the state. He saw that his father had had a great effect on people through his business success, his personal generosity, and his service in local and state politics. Carter decided that he would resign from the Navy to pursue a life modeled after his father’s.\n\nAlthough Rosalynn Carter at first opposed the move, the Carter family returned to Georgia, where they lived for a brief time in public housing. Carter helped his mother on the farm and in the family business. He began to relearn all that he had forgotten about agriculture. At first Carter was not successful as a farmer. His income in 1954 was only about $200. Through hard work and expansion of the peanut seed business, however, the family enterprise headed by Carter soon succeeded. Meanwhile, Rosalynn Carter began to help her husband in business by doing the bookkeeping.\n\nAfter her husband’s death Lillian Carter served as a housemother at a university in Alabama and later operated a nursing home. In 1966, at the age of 68, she joined the Peace Corps for two years of service as a nurse in India.\n\nA fourth child, Amy Lynn Carter, was born to the Carters in 1967. In the late 1960s Carter’s brother, Billy Carter, became a partner in the family business.\n\nGeorgia Politics\n\nFrom the beginning of his return to Georgia, Carter became involved in local issues that were politically sensitive. He refused to join the White Citizens’ Council, an organization that tried to maintain racial segregation in Southern society. He worked unsuccessfully to integrate his church. Carter served briefly on the school board, but his plan to consolidate schools was rejected by the voters.\n\nIn 1962 Carter entered the race for the Democratic nomination for the Georgia senate. He lost by a few votes, partly because of fraud that included stuffed ballot boxes. Carter vigorously contested the results through the courts and the state party. He also was able to interest an Atlanta newspaper in the case, which led to statewide exposure of vote fraud in Georgia. Although discouraged by the extent of corruption in politics, Carter pursued his appeals until he was declared the winner of the primary. The decision came so late, however, that voters in some counties had to write in Carter’s name for the general election. In spite of the confusion, Carter won the election.\n\nAs a state senator, Carter developed approaches to issues that he would later use as governor and as a presidential candidate. He advocated comprehensive planning in government, critical examination of budgets, and programs to help the poor and the disadvantaged. He was reelected in 1964.\n\nIn 1966 Carter announced his candidacy for the United States House of Representatives. When the Republican candidate, a political rival for many years, then switched to the race for governor, Carter also changed his plans and became a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. He lost the primary election and immediately began making plans to run again in 1970.\n\nCarter’s planning succeeded, and in 1971 he was inaugurated as governor of Georgia. Although he had not campaigned as a radical innovator, as governor Carter introduced policies that helped change the government and society of Georgia. He supported integration and appointed many African Americans to posts in state government. He hung portraits of the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., and other prominent African Americans in the state Capitol. Carter formed biracial groups to deal with racial tensions. He promoted prison reform and mental health programs. Carter attempted to make the state government more efficient by reducing and reorganizing the state bureaucracy. He also instituted zero-based budgeting, requiring that all programs be frequently reevaluated.\n\nDuring his term as governor Carter traveled widely. He received many national and international visitors to Georgia. As he met nationally prominent politicians, Carter began to believe that he was as well qualified as they to run for president. As early as 1971 Carter began to consider the possibility of becoming a candidate. While serving as chairman of the Democratic Party’s 1974 campaign committee, he made wide contacts with other Democratic leaders throughout the country. He began to assemble a campaign staff and advisers. In late 1974 Carter announced that he was a candidate for president.\n\nAfter his term as governor ended in early 1975, Carter returned to the family business. He also spent some time doing Christian mission work in the North.\n\nNational Politics\n\nWhen he began his national campaign, Carter was not as well known as several other candidates, including some members of Congress. From the first, however, Carter demonstrated his ability to win votes. He entered 26 of 27 preferential primaries and finished first in 17 of them. He won 19 of 31 primaries in all. Carter was strong both in traditionally conservative and in liberal states. He ran well in industrial states as well as farm states. Carter outpolled every other Democratic candidate in all sections of the country except the Far West. By the time the primaries had ended, most of his rivals had withdrawn, some pledging their support to Carter. He also began to receive endorsements from other prominent Democrats.\n\nAt the Democratic convention in New York City in July 1976 Carter received the nomination on the first ballot. As his vice-presidential running mate, he chose Walter F. Mondale, a United States senator from Minnesota and a leader of the liberal bloc in Congress. Many Democratic leaders joined the Carter family on the convention stage, emphasizing party unity.\n\nIn public-opinion polls taken at the time of his nomination, Carter led President Ford by 30 percentage points, one of the largest leads ever held by a presidential candidate. During the campaign—the first ever financed with tax revenues—Carter and Ford held a series of televised debates. Meanwhile, Carter’s lead steadily dwindled.\n\nCarter campaigned for efficiency and honesty in government as well as broader social programs, including national health insurance. He emphasized the humane role government should play in the lives of citizens. He campaigned as a man of integrity and trust who could lead the nation to a renewal of spirit. With the backing of much of the traditional Democratic coalition and with strong support from African Americans and organized labor, Carter won a narrow victory. His 57-vote electoral college margin was the smallest in 60 years.\n\nCarter’s inaugural was appropriate to the populist themes of his campaign. Thousands of his volunteer workers attended the celebrations, which were somewhat less formal than usual. In an inaugural speech that emphasized old-fashioned virtues, Carter quoted from a Plains schoolteacher: “We must adjust to changing times and still hold to unchanging principles.” With some of his family, Carter walked the mile and a half in the inaugural parade to the White House.\n\nThe walk was the first of several symbolic acts by Carter to establish the image of a president who would stay in touch with the people. He sold the presidential yacht and curtailed White House limousine service. He restricted the use of his portrait in government offices and suspended the playing of “Hail to the Chief.” He conducted a radio phone-in program, Ask the President, in which 42 callers—of 9 million who tried to reach him—asked a wide range of questions. Wearing a cardigan that helped dramatize energy conservation, Carter held a televised “fireside chat.” He attended a mock New England town meeting, staying overnight with a local family.\n\nCarter’s Appointments\n\nThe original Carter Cabinet included several members who had been prominent officials in previous Democratic administrations. They included Cyrus R. Vance, secretary of state; W. Michael Blumenthal, secretary of the treasury; Harold Brown, secretary of defense; and Joseph A. Califano, Jr., secretary of health, education, and welfare. Carter appointed Griffin B. Bell, a federal judge and longtime associate, as attorney general. Other Cabinet heads were Cecil D. Andrus, interior; Robert Bergland, agriculture; F. Ray Marshall, labor; and Brock Adams, transportation. James R. Schlesinger became secretary of a new Cabinet-level Department of Energy.\n\nCarter appointed two women: Juanita M. Kreps, secretary of commerce, and Patricia Roberts Harris, secretary of housing and urban development. Harris was the only African American member of the Cabinet. However, Carter appointed Andrew Young, a Black Georgia congressman, as ambassador to the United Nations (UN). A close Carter associate, Young became a prominent but controversial foreign policy spokesman. Carter appointed William H. Webster as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Admiral Stansfield Turner as director of the Central Intelligence Agency. He did not make any Supreme Court appointments.\n\nIn July 1979 Carter asked for the formal resignations of all Cabinet members. He replaced Blumenthal with G. William Miller, Adams with Neil E. Goldschmidt, and Schlesinger with Charles W. Duncan, Jr. In addition, Carter replaced Califano with Harris and appointed Moon Landrieu to replace Harris. Benjamin R. Civiletti replaced Bell, who left voluntarily. All other Cabinet members were reappointed.\n\nYoung resigned in August 1979 after it was revealed that he had held an unauthorized meeting with representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization. He was replaced by Donald F. McHenry. In November Philip M. Klutznick replaced Kreps, who resigned. Shirley Hufstedler was named to head the new Cabinet-level Department of Education; when it began operation in 1980, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare became the Department of Health and Human Services. In April 1980 Vance resigned; his successor was Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine.\n\nCarter established ethics guidelines for Cabinet members and for high-ranking aides. Among other requirements, Cabinet members were required to put financial holdings into blind trusts. There were, however, two major scandals during Carter’s administration. Bert Lance, a Carter confidant who became director of the Office of Management and Budget, resigned in 1978 after charges of earlier improper conduct as a banker. He was later acquitted in court. In 1980 a Senate subcommittee investigated business dealings between the Libyan government and Carter’s brother, Billy Carter. Although the subcommittee determined that foreign policy had not been affected, its report criticized President Carter for not acting to prevent the questionable activities of his brother.\n\nDomestic Policies\n\nCarter took office during one of the most severe winters on record. The long period of below-freezing temperatures produced the worst shortage of natural gas in the nation’s history. Carter received temporary authority from Congress to allocate natural gas supplies and to regulate prices. He also used the Taft-Hartley act to end a coal miner’s strike.\n\nIn April 1977 Carter gave the first of a series of major addresses to the nation on energy, which was to become one of the dominant concerns of his administration. Congress approved several of Carter’s energy proposals, including the deregulation of natural gas prices, by 1985, and incentives for such conservation measures as conversion to coal in industry and fuel-saving improvements in the home.\n\nIn a second major energy program, announced in April 1979, Carter ordered the gradual decontrol of domestic oil prices, but a court later struck down his order. Congress approved Carter’s tax on the so-called windfall profits of oil companies but rejected his request for standby authority for gasoline rationing. A third major set of energy measures included government underwriting of the development of synthetic fuels, which Congress also approved.\n\nThe economy became Carter’s other domestic concern. Although he emphasized cutbacks in spending, he also approved some measures to stimulate the economy. As the rate of inflation increased, in October 1978 Carter announced the first of several anti-inflation plans, which included voluntary wage and price controls. In November he took emergency measures to protect the declining dollar on world markets.\n\nThe cost of living increased more than 13 percent during 1979, and in March 1980 Carter announced new anti-inflation measures. They included credit restraints, which caused a drop in auto and housing sales and produced a deep, but short, recession in the United States.\n\nSeveral other Carter reforms were approved by Congress. They included granting him limited authority to reorganize the federal bureaucracy, changes in Civil Service to reward performance, and deregulation of the trucking, airline, and railroad industries. Carter also won a major reform of the banking system and strengthening of the Social Security trust fund. Congress rejected his proposal for direct election of the president.\n\nMilitary and Foreign Affairs\n\nIn his first official act as president, Carter granted pardons to Vietnam-era draft evaders. The pardons did not extend to deserters or to evaders who had used force or were employees of Selective Service.\n\nWhile Carter deferred production of the neutron bomb and of the B-1 bomber, he approved full-scale development of the MX missile system. He stressed human rights in foreign affairs, publicly criticizing several countries and specific leaders for their repressive policies. He supported several Soviet dissidents, an action that the Soviet Union denounced as interference in its domestic affairs. Some Latin American governments broke off agreements with the United States over the charges of repression.\n\nThe president participated in summit meetings in Europe and Japan. He visited South America, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, and his wife also traveled on behalf of the administration. After ending travel bans to Kampuchea (now Cambodia), Cuba, North Korea, and Vietnam in 1977, Carter extended full diplomatic recognition to China beginning in 1979.\n\nCarter narrowly won Senate approval of two treaties in which the United States agreed to relinquish control of the Panama Canal and its surrounding zone by the year 2000. Strong opposition delayed ratification of the second Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT II) agreement reached with the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1978 Carter conducted a summit meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar el-Sadat that resulted in agreements on principles for a peace treaty. In visits to Egypt and Israel in 1979, Carter negotiated a last-minute acceptance of a formal treaty.\n\nOn November 4, 1979, Iranian militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took more than 50 Americans hostage (see Iran hostage crisis). Carter initiated a series of moves to negotiate the release of the hostages. He called off an unsuccessful military rescue in progress in April 1980. (The last hostages were released moments after Carter left office, on January 20, 1981.)\n\nCarter ordered bans on shipments of grain and high-technology goods to the Soviet Union after that country invaded Afghanistan in December 1979. He called for a boycott, which more than 60 countries joined, of the 1980 Olympic Games held in Moscow. Carter won Congressional approval to resume draft registration.\n\nRenomination and Defeat\n\nShortly after his election Carter began to lose the support of many liberal Democrats who were critical of his economic policies. In the 1980 primaries Edward Kennedy defeated Carter in some of the most populous states, including California, New York, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. In July 1980 Carter received the lowest approval rating to that time of any president in the history of modern public-opinion polls. The hostage crisis played a major role in Carter’s image of weakness.\n\nAt the Democratic convention, though Carter was renominated, Kennedy supporters were able to adopt a platform with economic policies that Carter opposed. Carter refused to participate in televised debates that included Republican Congressman John B. Anderson of Illinois, who ran as an independent. Although the polls predicted a close election, Carter’s defeat by the Republican nominee, Ronald Reagan, was one of the worst ever suffered by an incumbent president.\n\nIn retirement Carter was one of the few modern leaders who did not try to cash in on the presidency. He served as a professor at Emory University in Atlanta and published several books. In 1982 he and his wife founded the Carter Center, in association with Emory, to secure human rights, to resolve conflicts, and to combat disease, hunger, and poverty around the world. His volunteer services ranged from hands-on help in building low-income housing with Habitat for Humanity in the United States to continuing international mediation for human rights and peace. He also monitored controversial elections throughout the world. In 2002 Carter visited Cuba to meet with President Fidel Castro; he was the first sitting or former U.S. president to visit that country in nearly 75 years. For his work as a peacemaker and champion of human rights and democracy, both during and after his presidency, Carter was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. (See also Nobel Prize.)"
