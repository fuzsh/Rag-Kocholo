        "text": "Carter next decided to run for president. He won the Democratic nomination in July 1976. He chose Senator Walter F. Mondale as his vice presidential running mate. During the campaign, Carter called for efficiency and honesty in government. In November 1976 he won a narrow victory against the Republican president, Gerald R. Ford.\n\nCarter took office during a severe winter and a terrible shortage of oil. He proposed an energy program to help the crisis, but Congress rejected it. Carter also tried to cut back government spending and to encourage the nation’s poor economy. Many citizens could not find jobs, however, and prices kept rising.\n\nIn 1978 Carter persuaded the leaders of Egypt and Israel to sign a historic peace agreement. On January 1, 1979, Carter opened full diplomatic relations between the United States and China. A serious crisis overshadowed those successes, however. On November 4, 1979, Iranian students invaded the U.S. Embassy in Iran and took more than 50 people hostage. Most of the hostages were not freed until January 1981."
