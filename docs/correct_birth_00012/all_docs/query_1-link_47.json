        "text": "Butterfly Daze and Carter Historical Auction - August 16-18, 2024\n\nJoin us for a weekend long event celebrating the life and legacy of former First Lady, Rosalynn Carter. Come and stay in Plains for the entire weekend and enjoy an auction preview, an evening at Plains High School, a Rosalynn Carter Memorial Food Distribution, a butterfly release, the 2024 Carter Historical Auction and stay for church at Marantha Baptist Church on Sunday morning!\n\nMore information on the auction can be found here.\n\nJames Earl \"Jimmy\" Carter, Jr., 39th President of the United States, was a very unique leader who brought about change, compassion and a belief that a government is only as good as its people. He was the first President to be born in a hospital on October 1, 1924, in the small rural town of Plains, Georgia. He later moved to a farm in the community of Archery at age 4 and spent most of his time working and playing with the African American children whose families were the bulk of the community of Archery. Living and working with the families in Archery, he saw segregation first hand and noticed that the lives of the African American families were drastically different from the lives of the white families in the area. The lessons he learned in Archery had an influence on his life from a young age.\n\nFrom the time he spent in the Navy to his post-presidential years, Jimmy Carter's life shows his dedication to public service. This dedication is no more evident than the fact that he is one of four presidents to have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and the only one who received it after he left office. His dedication to human and civil rights is another example of his dedication to public service. He and Mrs. Rosalynn have traveled around the world and have seen the pain and suffering of others.\n\nNOTE: Bio taken from the NPS.gov website: https://www.nps.gov/jica/learn/historyculture/people.htm"
