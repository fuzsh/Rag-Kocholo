        "text": "History of the Boyhood Farm\n\nThe Boyhood Farm, once owned by Earl Carter, Jimmy Carter's father, has a rich history dating back to 1928 when it came under the Carters' ownership. For over two decades, Earl Carter cultivated a variety of crops, including corn, cotton, peanuts, and sugar cane, alongside maintaining a large family garden. Young Jimmy Carter called this place home from the age of four until he left for college, and it holds some of his earliest and most cherished memories.\n\nA Memorable Start\n\nOne of Jimmy Carter's earliest and most vivid recollections revolves around the day they moved into their new home. \"The front door was locked when we got there, and daddy realized that he had forgotten the key. He tried to raise one of the windows that opened onto the front porch, but a wooden bar on the inside let it come up only about six inches. So he slid me through the crack and I came around to unlock the door from the inside. The approval of my father for my first useful act has always been one of my most vivid memories.\" - Jimmy Carter, An Hour Before Daylight\n\nA Step Back in Time\n\nIn the year 2000, the Boyhood Farm became an integral part of a park. The farm underwent a restoration process to recreate its appearance as it was before electricity was installed in 1938. Visitors are encouraged to take a leisurely stroll along the walking path, with informative wayside exhibits at various points to provide insight into the history and significance of the farm. For a more immersive experience, there are audio stations where you can hear Jimmy Carter himself sharing his childhood stories.\n\nFarm Life Today\n\nThe Boyhood Farm continues to thrive with the same agricultural spirit. The farm is home to honeybees, goats, chickens, mules, and farm cats, all actively contributing to the authentic farm atmosphere. Crops are still grown periodically throughout the year, which include sugarcane, cotton, corn, tomatoes, and, of course, peanuts, a crop closely associated with the Carters. Visitors can witness firsthand the timeless charm of farm life and the enduring connection to Jimmy Carter's roots."
