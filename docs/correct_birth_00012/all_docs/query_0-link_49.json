        "text": "Jimmy Carter: Citizen of the South uses oral histories and more than 215 photographs to look at the life of the former president and how the South nurtured him, provided a launching pad for his political career, and supported the various activities of his post-presidency. Even people very familiar with Carter will gain a greater appreciation for the breadth of civic, religious, and charitable ventures the president has engaged in since leaving office.\n\nGeorgia and the South have shaped much of his life and beliefs. Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, grew up in Plains. Although military service led him to leave the area for eleven years, upon returning, he farmed and ran a peanut warehouse while he and Rosalynn raised their family. In 1962, he won election to the Georgia Senate and became governor eight years later. With the assistance of many Georgians, he became president of the United States in 1977.\n\nAfter losing his bid for reelection, Carter returned home to Plains, where southerners welcomed him and his wife back and supported their new endeavors. Carter established the Carter Presidential Library and the Carter Center in Atlanta and became a professor at Emory University. He has occasionally commented about world events and periodically meets with fellow presidents and governors. He taught Sunday school at the Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains for four decades and has engaged in humanitarian programs such as Habitat for Humanity around the country and the world, continuing to educate and inspire generations of philanthropic activists.\n\nWith this informative history, Kaye Lanning Minchew illuminates Carterâ€™s past, present, and his enduring legacy, adding to our understanding of his impact on both national and international concerns."
