        "text": "Plains, Ga. (WTVM) - “‘It’s Presidents’ Day and it’s so great to be here in Plains Georgia, the home of course our 39th President Jimmy Carter. But we’re remembering all of our presidents and honoring our presidents and their accomplishments to make this a great nation,” said presidential historian Larry Cook.\n\nIt has been one year since Jimmy Carter was placed in hospice care. He was not able to be in attendance, but the people of Plains still honor his service to the community.\n\n“Despite the fact that he is not able to get out and be with us here physically today, his spirit is felt throughout this community of plains, and really all of Sumter County,” said Mayor Lee Kinnamon.\n\n“He came from a very poor house, like he was very poor when he was born and he become president and that just shows that you could be whatever you wanna be if you put your mind into it,” said Reed Elliott.\n\nThe main message of the guest speaker: your place matters.\n\n“My whole message today was that place does matter in the crucible in which his character was formed, was right here in Sumter County,” said Kinnamon.\n\n“He has so many milestones in his life you know one day he is getting ready for church, and he fell had to get 14 stitches and that night he was in Nashville building houses,” said Elliott.\n\n“Had it not been for plains, had it not been for Jimmy Carter. Coming back here to Plains. Things will be very very different,” said Cook.\n\nWhen asked about what people should take away from this Presidents’ Day program., Cook had this to say:\n\n“A great man and president that President Carter was,”\n\nAt 99-years-old, former President Jimmy Carter remains the longest-living U.S. president."
