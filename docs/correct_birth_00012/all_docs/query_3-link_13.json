Bond St., Plains, GeorgiaCoordinates[2]Area71 acres (29 ha)Visitation51,580[3] (2018)WebsiteJimmy Carter National Historical ParkNRHP reference No.01000272[1]Significant datesDesignated NHSDecember 23, 1987Designated NHP2021\n\nThe Jimmy Carter National Historical Park, located in Plains, Georgia, preserves sites associated with Jimmy Carter (born 1924), 39th president of the United States. These include his residence, boyhood farm, school, and the town railroad depot, which served as his campaign headquarters during the 1976 election. The building which used to be Plains High School (opened in 1921 and closed in 1979) serves as the park's museum and visitor center. As Carter lives in Plains, the area surrounding the residence including the burial site of former First Lady Rosalynn Carter (1927–2023) is under the protection of the United States Secret Service and is not open to the public.\n\nThe Carters returned to Plains in 1981. The former President and First Lady pursued many of the goals of his administration through the Carter Center in Atlanta, which has programs to alleviate human suffering and to promote human rights and world peace. Carter taught Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church, which is open to the public.\n\nIt was established in 1987 by Pub. L.Tooltip Public Law (United States) 100–206 as Jimmy Carter National Historic Site and renamed as a national historical park in 2021.\n\nThe former Plains High School, which both Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter attended, now serves as the park's visitor center and museum.[4] It features a classroom, principal's office, and auditorium which have been restored to look as they would have when Jimmy Carter attended.[4] An exact replica of the Resolute desk, which Jimmy Carter brought back to the Oval Office to use as his presidential desk, is exhibited, as is his 2002 Nobel Peace Prize. Other rooms feature exhibits that explain the lives of Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter, and a short video focuses on the life of Jimmy Carter according to his friends, neighbors, and family.[4]\n\nThe farm in rural Archery where Jimmy lived from age four in 1928 until he left for college[4] in 1941 has been restored to its appearance before electricity was installed in 1938.[4]\n\nThe former Plains Train Depot, where Carter headquartered his presidential campaign, now serves as a museum focusing on the 1976 Presidential Campaign and Election.[4] It features exhibits which highlight Jimmy Carter's campaign for President. The train depot operated from 1888 until 1951,[4] when all public transportation to and from the area ceased.[5]\n\nThe current home of the Carters at 209 Woodland Drive, while not open to the public, is a part of the park.[6] The Carters have lived in the home since 1961.[7] During his presidency, it was used as his Summer White House.[7]\n\nRosalynn Carter is buried on the grounds of the house by a willow tree on the lawn of the property. Jimmy Carter intends to be buried next to his late wife upon his death.[8] The intent is for the National Park Service (NPS) to turn the house into a museum and open it to public tours after Jimmy Carter's passing.[8][9]\n\nPlains train depot, which served as the 1976 Carter campaign headquarters\n\nInterior of the campaign headquarters\n\nCarter's high school, now a museum and visitor center\n\nDetail of classroom\n\nAuditorium\n\nHistorical marker\n\nMap of farm\n\nA water pump powered by a windmill\n\nBarn and old farm equipment\n\nBlacksmith shop\n\nEarl and Lillian Carter home\n\nDetail of front porch\n\nDetail of dining room\n\nDetail of bedroom\n\nDetail of bedroom\n\nCarter family country store\n\nDetail of country store\n\nRachel and Jack Clark's tenant house\n\nTenant house, main room\n\nTenant house, kitchen\n\nGeorgia (U.S. State) portal\n\nList of residences of presidents of the United States\n\nPresidential memorials in the United States"
