That changes with “Poor Relations,” a new single they’ve released in support of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s efforts to block the Dakota Access Pipeline. On YouTube, the band explains:\n\nThis song meant something else when we first wrote it years ago; recent events have made us hear it differently. We believe in compassion, empathy, and tolerance, and hope that you will join us in speaking out against the erosion of their importance in our world. All proceeds will be donated to supporting the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in their efforts to block the Dakota Access Pipeline (http://standingrock.org/).\n\nListen below and purchase for a price of your choice at Bandcamp.\n\nPoor Relations by Mr Twin Sister\n\nHere are the lyrics:\n\nAn attitude, no patience, he’s paper thin.\n\nTreat him wrong, his eyes open, he can’t take a breath.\n\nTalking over everything you have to say, no respect.\n\nDon’t correct the things he said, what’s the use?\n\nCan’t handle violence.\n\nLearning to love the abuse you can’t live without.\n\nYour familiar oppression, your daily injustice when he’s gone.\n\nReplacing him with cruelty, you like the pain.\n\nThat loser man that belongs to you, he’s ruling you."
