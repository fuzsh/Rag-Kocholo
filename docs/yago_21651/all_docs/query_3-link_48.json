        "text": "How is it possible that the kind of squalor and dissolute behavior that would be intolerable in our own lives and the lives of our friends is often fascinating, even enjoyable, in a movie? The cynical answer is that our enjoyment is based on relief: this mess is happening to someone else, not to us. Yet it can’t be as simple as that. After all, a moviegoer’s imaginative life is voracious. From day to day, we may be as cautious and calculating as possums, but at the movies we want to see everything, including the worst. We may even feel a tiny sense of duty to see the worst, though the pleasure derived from looking at meanness is likely more aesthetic than moral. If we sense, This is right, this is the way things are, we know that we’re in the hands of an artist. I have trouble sitting through reality-TV shows, but I could spend all day watching Amy Ryan (from “The Wire”) play the world’s most awful mother in “Gone Baby Gone.” Ryan’s character, Helene McCready, a blond near-looker of about thirty-five, is the kind of hardened screwup who teases the squares in her family when they disapprove of her sleeping around and snorting so much coke. Her baby? Someone else will look after it. Anyway, it’s no business of theirs. Even after her four-year-old girl is snatched from the house one night, Helene remains defiant. Ryan leads with her jaw, and she gives her foul-mouthed lines rhythm and bite. She understands that an egotistical sinner always puts other people on the defensive. She’s viciously alive, and her wayward mother is a fresh, unprecedented creation on the screen.\n\nBen Affleck, in “Gone Baby Gone,” his first directorial effort, intermittently works as an artist, too. The movie is based on a genre thriller by Dennis Lehane, who wrote the much finer novel “Mystic River,” which served as the basis of the Clint Eastwood classic from a few years back. Affleck has not been cowed by the success of the earlier movie; he digs even deeper into sordidness than Eastwood did. “Gone Baby Gone” is set in the Boston that the postwar boom passed by—the sour streets of working-class Dorchester, where the light is gray and shapeless people sit all day long on the steps of wood-frame houses. It’s a neighborhood, as Lehane and Affleck present it, in which children are in danger of neglect or far worse. Affleck, who wrote the screenplay with Aaron Stockard, wants us to feel the dinginess of the place, as well as the endurance of the men and women who live there, and he mixes in among the actors and the professional extras some local people—including steady drinkers with red, swollen cheeks at a corner bar. The non-actors stand out; they have a guarded, almost hostile self-sufficiency—their faces yield nothing to the camera. We don’t get the same kind of pleasure from them that we get from Amy Ryan, but they give the movie a sullen authority.\n\nBen Affleck’s younger brother Casey stars as Patrick Kenzie, a smart Dorchester tough who has pulled himself together to become a private investigator and neighborhood guardian. With his girlfriend, Angie (Michelle Monaghan), Patrick searches for people who have disappeared. When Helene’s daughter is kidnapped, they scour Dorchester watering holes, hassle the drug dealers, and get heavily embroiled with some angry Boston police officers who are obsessed with protecting children. The movie turns into a complicated and emotional thriller, but Casey Affleck doesn’t overplay his hand. He’s lean, with a pale, unmarked face that suggests meagre experience of the world, and at first he looks too young for the part. Most of the time, he mutters in a thick (occasionally impenetrable) street accent; his Patrick is reserved, and people underestimate him. But Affleck uses his untested appearance to dramatic effect. When someone challenges Patrick, he comes back hard with a bottom-dog snarl and a string of threats. From one scene to the next, “Gone Baby Gone” has a bracingly surly tone. The insults fly, and Ben Affleck and the actors make them sound like normal speech. It’s as if everyone in Boston had a large block on his shoulder, or some nasty secret to conceal.\n\nBoth the police and the thugs tell Patrick and Angie that if a kidnapped child isn’t found within the first few days she’s probably dead. Yet the couple persists in looking, and the movie turns into a convoluted and, to my mind, largely improbable detective story, with Patrick developing into a supersleuth who steps into claustral, threatening places and takes enormous chances. Ben Affleck probably respects Lehane the genre writer (there are five books with Patrick Kenzie as the hero) more than he should. He also has some way to go before he becomes a good director of action. A night scene in which the child is supposed to be exchanged for money is shown several times, from different points of view, with quick flashes in the dark, but exactly what happens isn’t clear in any version. Affleck does best in sustained, intense passages of dialogue in which he can get the actors to dramatize contradictory impulses—the mixed motives and desires springing from long-buried pasts. Ed Harris, as a Louisiana-born police detective with an elegant goatee and burning eyes, gives one of his most fervent performances—his cop is so determined to eradicate evil that he commits evil. The movie is held together by the sickened sense that children are in danger. It’s not just the women but also the men who can’t stop talking about kidnapped children, abused children, murdered children. The unconvincing genre conventions in “Gone Baby Gone” are at odds with its authentic, lived-in atmosphere, but no one can say that Affleck hasn’t looked into the depths, and the movie ends on a resonantly ambiguous note: are the rights of motherhood absolute if the mother is an incorrigible waster?\n\nIn Sidney Lumet’s furious and entertaining little morality play, “Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead,” two men hard up for cash—Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a payroll manager at a Manhattan real-estate company, and Hank (Ethan Hawke), his dim-witted kid brother—decide to knock over a jewelry store in Westchester. They know the store’s layout; they know how much value in diamonds and cash is likely to be sitting there on a Saturday morning. How could they not know? The store belongs to their parents. But there’s no downside, Andy says. An elderly friend of their mother’s will be tending the store that morning, and, after the robbery, the boys will fence the jewels, and their parents’ losses will be made good by an insurance company. We already know, however, that none of this will happen as Andy says—that the robbery will be a disaster—because the bungled job is shown near the beginning of the movie, and the planning session is a flashback. Lumet, working with the playwright Kelly Masterson’s original script, has structured the events in an unusual way: again and again, the movie reaches a climactic moment, then jumps back a few days to lay out the story from the point of view of one character or another. When the climactic moment is reached a second time, the plot moves forward a bit, only to jump back once more, and so on. Despite the oscillation between past and present, “Devil” is so feverishly acted that it feels as if it were always hurtling into the future. Finally, near the end, the filmmakers stop backpedalling and rush through a series of increasingly violent acts in which the two men, trapped by their mistakes and their nauseating guilt, fall apart. “Devil” is devoted to the chaos unleashed by a single terrible idea. The fractured time scheme brings out the unsurprising but still enlightening lesson that crime should be left to the professionals, and that greed humbles smart-asses like Andy, who think they’re invulnerable.\n\nIn part, the jewelry-store caper has Oedipal roots—Andy, it turns out, feels that he has never had the love of his father (Albert Finney) and is acting out some sort of convoluted revenge. He’s also trying to do his hapless but good-looking brother in, even as Hank is doing him in by sleeping with his wife (Marisa Tomei). Lumet, now eighty-three, was around when both Arthur Miller’s contentious family plays and live TV drama were at their peak (Lumet directed hundreds of shows), and this movie, with its savage competitions between brothers and between generations, has the feel of yesterday’s dramaturgy. Yet he makes it work. While shooting his movies, Lumet grabs his actors and shakes them into giving more and more. Moving the camera in close, he pitches the performances as high as he can. In this case, his bullying panache feels right. If the material had been underplayed, or done as cool, sly satire, its moral and psychological patterns might have seemed obvious and trite. But with Andy laughing cynically and grinding Hank’s ego to bits, and Hank so terrified that he can’t stop trembling, the story of two reckless brothers becomes a volatile farce about schmucks on the loose—an old man’s malicious joke about the universality of folly. Even Albert Finney, as the father, in his righteous fury after the crime, is a kind of comic monster. We can enjoy the mayhem without feeling sorry for any of them. ♦"
