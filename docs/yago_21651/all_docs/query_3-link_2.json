        "meta_description": "A Poor Relation: With Thomas Jefferson, Frank Norcross, Mildred Manning, Millicent Evans. James Sterrett, a workman, abandons his wife and their two children. He secures a position as confidential secretary to John Faye, a manufacturer, and in the course of time becomes junior partner of the firm. Inflated with power, Sterrett refuses to deal with the labor union committee, and a strike is threatened. Meanwhile Mrs. Sterrett struggles for existence, and Noah Vale, her neighbor, an inventor, notes her distress and relieves it as far as his limited circumstances will allow. Mrs. Sterrett is taken ill, and Scollops, a girl waif, friend of the children, summons Vale and assists in having Mrs. Sterrett removed to the hospital. Vale promises to take care of the Sterrett children, and Scollops volunteers to aid them. Sterrett admires Dolly Faye, his partner's daughter, but receives no encouragement from Dolly. Mrs. Faye, Dolly's stepmother, encourages Sterrett in his effort to win Dolly. Harry Smith, an office employee, is in love with Dolly, and she returns his affection. Vale reads of the impending strike at Faye and Sterrett's factory and writes to them that he has a labor-saving invention which he would like to submit for their inspection. Accompanied by the Sterrett children, Vale calls at Faye's home. Mrs. Faye is enraged when Dolly admits them, telling Faye sarcastically that Dolly has discovered some \"poor relations.\" Mrs. Sterrett leaves the hospital. Through Scollops she learns that her children are at Mrs. Faye's house with Vale. Vale, weak from hunger, faints, and Sterrett robs the inventor of his plans. Sterrett tries to make Vale out a fraud, and nearly collapses when he comes face to face with his deserted wife, who has come for her children. He warns her to say nothing and go home; that he will call on her that afternoon. Sterrett schemes to get Vale out of the way and gain possession of his model by offering to send the inventor abroad on a business mission. Vale accepts Sterrett's offer and receives a sum of money for expenses. Smith is indignant when Dolly tells him that she is accused of stealing Vale's plans, and suspecting Sterrett. Smith leaves for the factory. Mrs. Sterett sees through her husband's designs and determines to save Vale. On her way to the office she decides to tell Mr. Faye of her appointment with Sterrett. Mrs. Sterrett meets her husband at the office and recognizing Vale's plans, grabs them and tells Sterrett that she intends returning them to Vale. Sterrett seizes her and Smith comes to the rescue. In a terrific struggle, during which the office is wrecked, Faye arrives, stops the fight and dismisses Sterrett when he learns of his duplicity. Faye gives Vale a check for $10,000 in part payment of his invention. Faye volunteers to care for Mrs. Sterrett and her children, and it is obvious that the love affair of Smith and Dolly will soon reach a happy climax.",
