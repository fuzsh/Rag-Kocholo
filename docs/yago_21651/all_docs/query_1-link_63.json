        "text": "After winning the Best Actress Oscar gong earlier this month for the critically-acclaimed Poor Things, Emma Stone will star in Kinds of Kindness, reuniting with director Yorgos Lanthimos, which is shaping up to be a must-watch for this summer.\n\nThe first look trailer has just dropped – it looks gorgeous, insane and we are super intrigued.\n\nHaving already worked together on The Favourite – which also starred Olivia Colman and Rachel Weisz – Emma and Yorgos are set to bring us another likely surreal, colourful and thought-provoking movie. And the supporting cast looks incredible.\n\nFilmed back in 2022 over the course of two months, reports say Kinds of Kindness will have an anthology structure.\n\nIn her Oscars speech, Emma thanked Yorgos for giving her the “gift of a lifetime” in playing Poor Things' Bella Baxter. We're so excited about what the duo will bring to our screens next.\n\nHere's everything we know so far about Kinds of Kindness.\n\nWhat do we know about the Kinds of Kindness plot?\n\nThe official plot synopsis has been confirmed as follows: “A triptych fable, following a man without choice who tries to take control of his own life; a policeman who is alarmed that his wife who was missing-at-sea has returned and seems a different person; and a woman determined to find a specific someone with a special ability, who is destined to become a prodigious spiritual leader.” Mysterious stuff.\n\nAn interview with The Guardian Yorgos himself described Kinds of Kindness as “a contemporary film, set in the US – three different stories, with four or five actors who play one part in each story.”\n\nHe went on to describe his close, creative working relationship with Emma Stone: “I just thought that she had something very special. I’d seen the work that she’d done, and I thought that she would be great for The Favourite.\n\n\"She is ready to do whatever it takes to get things done. And apart from her being an incredible actress, it’s just being able to communicate with someone without having to explain anything, without having to use too many words. Just getting it.”\n\nWho has joined the Kinds of Kindness cast?\n\nAlongside Emma Stone, Poor Things star Willem Dafoe will star, along with Margaret Qualley, Jesse Plemons, Euphoria's Hunter Schafer, Hong Chau (The Menu, The Whale), Joe Alwyn and Mamoudou Athie.\n\nIs there a Kinds of Kindness trailer?\n\nThe first look trailer has just dropped, and we've been given snippets of what looks like a cross between genius and madness.\n\nSet against a cover of 1980s anthem Sweet Dreams by Eurythmics, the teaser begins and ends with Stone driving a speeding car and unfolds into a series of scenes featuring Kinds of Kindness' amazing cast. We see Margaret Qualley slap Jesse Plemons around the face, we see Joe Alwyn on the brink of madness, we see Willem Dafoe's maniac smile, we see Hong Chau lick someone's torso – and we also see what looks like a dead body being dragged through a doorway. Unhinged isn't even the word.\n\nThe trailer ends with Stone saying: “This is it, the moment of truth”, and ends with her asking: “Isn't it wonderful?” We have so many questions.\n\nWhat is the Kinds of Kindness release date?\n\nIt will be available to watch in US cinemas from 21 June – it looks like it will be released in the UK on the same date, but we'll update as soon as we know more."
