Thirty years later, Helen has died, Myrna is out of the picture and Reggie is struggling to financially support his family: wife MARIEL, tween daughter NICOLE, precocious seven year old GIGI, and troublemaking toddler ALEX. When the cut-rate funeral home they hired for the funeral loses Helen’s body in a mix-up, the timing couldn’t be any worse for Celeste to resurface, yet resurface she does. See, Celeste has been trying to turn her life around for the past few decades and she is set to marry a wealthy family man who’s unaware of the estrangement between Celeste and her now adult children. When Celeste offers to help Reggie and his family out financially, Reggie knows that help will come with strings attached, namely Celeste’s renewed presence in his life; a presence sure to stir up all sorts of conflict considering the cocktail of strong personalities present in this interracial family.\n\nTeam\n\nWritten by: Jose Nateras & Lizbett Perez, Story by: Lizbett Perez\n\nSeeking\n\nDevelopment Funds, Investors, Producing Partners, Production Company,\n\nContact\n\nJose Nateras\n\nJosenateras@gmail.com\n\n630-408-3452"
