        "text": "A Romantic Mixture\n\nHere today, gone tomorrow -- or at least next week.\n\nThat's the saga of Mira Nair.\n\nMiss Nair, the Indian director of the Academy Award nominee \"Salaam Bombay!,\" is bound for Uganda next week to put the finishing touches on her latest film, \"Mississippi Masala.\"\n\nAnd to know just what is cooking with Miss Nair, it is necessary to know a soupcon about Indian cuisine.\n\nMasala, she explained, \"is a collection of hot spices of different colors.\" So, she said, \"Mississippi Masala,\" which has among its stars the American actor Denzel Washington in the role of Demetrius and the newcomer Sarita Choudhury of Bangladesh as a young woman named Mina, \"is an interspicial romance.\"\n\nThe story revolves around an Indian family expelled from Uganda, with the rest of the Asians living there, in 1972 by the despotic ruler Idi Amin. Miss Choudhury plays the daughter; Roshan Seth, the Indian star who lent his formidable presence to films including \"Gandhi\" and \"My Beautiful Laundrette,\" portrays the father, a liberal lawyer, and Sharmila Tagore, who starred in Satyajit Ray's \"Apu\" trilogy (and is the grandniece of the great Indian author Rabindranath Tagore), plays the mother.\n\n\"This family find themselves in Greenwood, Miss., where they are poor relations of a richer Indian family who own a motel,\" said Miss Nair, who wrote the screenplay with Sooni Taraporevala, her collaborator on \"Salaam Bombay!\" \"And the father is sort of obsessed with suing the Government of Uganda for his property, and the daughter manages the motel.\n\n\"She begins a relationship with Demetrius, a young black man who is a carpet cleaner in the town. They sort of cross the border of color in both their communities, and when this relationship is discovered, it explodes tension in the black community and the Indian one and brings back memories of the Uganda that this family had left.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
