Unshackled, she becomes resolute in championing equality and liberation. Rotten Tomatoes critics give Poor Things a 92% ranking, calling it âwildly imaginative and exhilaratingly over the topâ¦ a bizarre, brilliant tour de force.â (Disney+, Apple, YouTube, Google Play, Prime Video)\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nBaltimore / Roseâs War (2023)\n\nBaltimore explores the life of Rose Dugdale (portrayed by Imogen Poots), an heiress and debutante who becomes a militant member of the Provisional IRA. The thriller unfolds in April 1974 as Rose orchestrates an art heist at Russborough House, the residence of Sir Alfred Beit. Directed by Joe Lawlor and Christine Molloy. Released in the US in March 2024 under the title Roseâs War. IndieWire calls Poots's performance âmagneticâ. (Mubi)\n\nSmall Things Like These (2024)\n\nThe Guardian describes Small Things Like These as Cillian Murphyâs âpiercingly painful Magdalene Laundries dramaâ imbued with literary intensity. Murphy, producer and lead actor, plays a man witnessing Irelandâs churchâs abusive workhouses for unwed mothers. Playwright Enda Walsh beautifully adapts Claire Keegan's acclaimed novel, with Tim Mielants as director. (Mubi)\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nAn Irish Goodbye (2022)\n\nIn rural Northern Ireland, following the untimely death of their mother, a young man with Down syndrome and his estranged brother discover her unfulfilled bucket list and set out to honor her in this Oscar-winning short film. Director Ross White had worked in a special educational needs unit as a teaching assistant. He and co-director Tom Berkeley decided that would be a factor of the character in An Irish Goodbye, but not the point of the drama. \"Itâs not enough just to put that in front of the camera and say, 'Okay, weâve got a character with Down syndrome; there you go,'â White explained. \"We wanted to write this character that is so multifaceted - who is mischievous, full of heart, and full of swearing.\" (Prime Video, BBC iPlayer)\n\nâ\n\nIn Bruges (2008)\n\nIn Bruges is a dark comedy about consequences. Two Irish hitmen Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are laying low in Belgium when Ray meets Chloe, also in town shooting a movie. Irish-British writer/director Martin McDonagh said his own holiday in Bruges inspired the script. He was struck both by Brugesâ beauty and the sheer boredom of spending his day looking at churches and medieval Gothic architecture. âThat became two characters in my head - the culture lover and the drunken whore.â (YouTube, Google Play, Prime Video, Apple)\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin (2022) â\n\nThe In Bruges cast is back for McDonaghâs tragicomedy The Banshees of Inisherin, an allegory for the Irish Civil War. PÃ¡draic (Farrell) and Colm (Gleeson) are mates but Colm unexpectedly puts an end to their friendship. Farrell said he felt nervous about being at loggerheads with Gleeson - the opposite of their In Bruges relationship. Luckily, the actors didnât stay in character off the set. Unlike the city of Bruges, Belgium, Inisherin doesnât actually exist, but fans can visit Irelandâs west coast where filming took place on Inishmore. (HBO Max, Prime Video, YouTube, Google Play, Hulu)\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nThe Quiet Girl (2022) â\n\nA nine-year-old girl from a dysfunctional family (actress Catherine Clinch) goes to live with distant relatives for the summer. Living with a middle-aged farm couple, The Quiet Girl discovers a new way of living. She blossoms in their care, but in this house where there are meant to be no secrets, she discovers one. (Prime Video, Apple TV, Google Play, YouTube, Curzon)\n\nâ\n\nI See a Darkness (documentary, 2023)\n\nCapturing scenes in Paris, Death Valley, and the Nevada nuclear test site, I See a Darkness delves into the intricate historical interplay between photography, cinema, and science. It scrutinizes the impact of Irish-born Lucien Bull's (1876-1972) chrono-photographic experiments on 20th-century image-capture aesthetics and scientific advancements, revealing the military-industrial complex's appropriation of vision technologies, especially in nuclear testing. (Mubi)\n\nâ\n\nThe Crying Game (1992)\n\nNeil Jordanâs The Crying Game deals with love, race, war, politics, and identity - all woven around a plot involving an IRA member, Fergus (Stephen Rea), who forms an unexpected bond with kidnapped black British soldier Jody (Forest Whitaker) and promises to visit his girlfriend (Jaye Davidson). When Jordan wrote the script, people said, 'No way are we making this.' In the end, The Crying Game drummed up independent financing and six Oscar nominations. (Prime Video, Chili, All 4 in the UK)\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nMichael Collins (1996) â\n\nLiam Neeson stars in this biopic about Irish revolutionary Michael Collins. After the 1918 election, the victorious Sinn FÃ©in party declared Irish independence and Collins was appointed Director of Intelligence for the emerging IRA. He negotiates a treaty with the British but must decide where his loyalties lie. Neeson, nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, called it his favorite film and said he fell in love with Collins when he was a boy in Northern Ireland studying history: âI think it was his energy, his dynamism, his truth, and absolute dedication to what he believed in.â (Apple TV, Google Play, YouTube, Prime Video)Â\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nCardboard Gangsters (2017) â\n\nJayâs unemployment benefits are stopped due to a recent DJ-ing gig so he attempts to take over the Darndale drug trade from Murphy, who has controlled it for three decades. Critics describe Cardboard Gangsters as a Dublin-based Boyz n the Hood with bleak humor and an edgy, violent undertone. With a 94 percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and stars John Connors and Paul Alwright, you canât go wrong. (Prime Video, Google Play, YouTube, Apple TV)Â\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nIn the Name of the Father (1993)\n\nGerry (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a petty thief in â70s Belfast when he flees to England. When the IRA bomb the Guildford Pub, he is coerced into confessing to a crime he didnât commit. The drama is based on the true story of the âGuildford Fourâ prisoners, which inspired Irish filmmaker Jim Sheridan. He cast Day-Lewis after they worked together on another classic, My Left Foot (1989), because he knew the actor was âpolitically sensitiveâ to the subject. Daniel is mesmerizing throughout, nabbing a Best Actor nomination for his supporting role.

(Apple TV, Prime Video)\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nGarage (2007)Â\n\nA tragicomedy set in the world of rural Irish gas stations during a life-changing summer, Garage is directed by Lenny Abrahamson and written by Mark O'Halloran (the duo behind Adam & Paul). Abrahamson describes the movie as a âslapstick tragedyâ. RTÃ gave it four stars while The Guardian describes it as a âgentle and elegiac lament to wasted lives.â Garage won the CICAE Art and Essai Cinema Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. (Apple TV)Â\n\nâ\n\nThe Guard (2011)\n\nCritics loved this offbeat cop buddy movie about Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na (police) Sergeant Gerry Boyle who investigates a murder. Boyle attends a briefing by an FBI agent, Wendell Everett (Don Cheadle), who is sent to liaise with the Garda in hunting four Irish drug traffickers awaiting a massive delivery of cocaine from Jamaica. It is there that Boyle recognizes one of the men in Everett's presentation as the victim of the murder. (Netflix, Apple TV, Prime Video)\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nHunger (2008)Â\n\nSteve McQueenâs drama about the 1981 Irish hunger strike stars Michael Fassbender and was a Cannes Festival favorite. Fassbender portrays Bobby Sands as dramatic events unfold in the Maze Prison. Initially, Fassbender, raised in southwest Ireland, felt the subject matter was too close to home and didnât want to audition. McQueen didnât want Fassbender either, thinking he was too âcockyâ. Fassbender said he nailed it at the second audition, however, and the men bonded: âIt changed my life.â (Apple TV, YouTube, Google Play, Prime Video)\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nBrooklyn (2015)\n\nIrish-American actress Saoirse Ronan (Hanna, Lovely Bones) stars as Eilis Lacey, a woman of many secrets who leaves Ireland in the 1950s to immigrate to the US. Keep an eye out for Colm TÃ³ibÃ­n, author of the novel on which the film is based. He has a cameo as the man in line in front of Eilis the first time she goes through immigration in New York. (Apple TV, Google Play, YouTube, Prime Video, Chili, Sky Store)\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nSeven Psychopaths (2002)â\n\nThere's a Tarantino-esque vibe to Seven Psychopaths, directed, written, and co-produced by British-Irish filmmaker Martin McDonagh. Marty (Colin Farrell) is in Los Angeles writing a screenplay, Seven Psychopaths, when he gets involved in the underworld. Meanwhile, Billy, his best friend, makes a living by kidnapping dogs and collecting rewards for their return. Try not to over-analyze Seven Psychopaths and youâll enjoy the dark humor and Christopher Walkinâs performance as Hans. (Prime Video, Disney+, Sky Store, Microsoft, Apple TV, Google Play, YouTube)\n\nâ\n\nHONORABLE MENTION\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nThe Commitments (1991)Â\n\nJimmy (actor/musician Robert Arkins) is an unemployed Dublin lad who puts together an unforgettable working-class soul band, The Commitments.
