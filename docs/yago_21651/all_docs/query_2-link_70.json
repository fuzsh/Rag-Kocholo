Condition: Neu. nach der Bestellung gedruckt Neuware - Printed after ordering - Classic from the year 2009 in the subject English Language and Literature Studies - Literature, , language: English, abstract: Plated ArticlePutting up for the night in one of the chiefest towns of Staffordshire, I find it to be by no means a lively town. In fact, it is as dull and dead a town as any one could desire not to see. It seems as if its whole population might be imprisoned in its Railway Station. The Refreshment Room at that Station is a vortex of dissipation compared with the extinct town-inn, the Dodo, in the dull High Street.[.]\\*\\*\\*A Poor Man's Tale of a PatentI am not used to writing for print. What working-man, that never labours less (some Mondays, and Christmas Time and Easter Time excepted) than twelve or fourteen hours a day, is But I have been asked to put down, plain, what I have got to say; and so I take pen-and-ink, and do it to the best of my power, hoping defects will find excuse.[.]\\*\\*\\*The Poor Relation's StoryHe was very reluctant to take precedence of so many respected members of the family, by beginning the round of stories they were to relate as they sat in a goodly circle by the Christmas fire; and he modestly suggested that it would be more correct if 'John our esteemed host' (whose health he begged to drink) would have the kindness to begin.[.]\\*\\*\\*Prince BullOnce upon a time, and of course it was in the Golden Age, and I hope you may know when that was, for I am sure I don't, though I have tried hard to find out, there lived in a rich and fertile country, a powerful Prince whose name was BULL.[.]\\*\\*\\*Public Life of Mr. Tulrumble - Once Mayor of MudfogMudfog is a pleasant town-a remarkably pleasant town-situated in a charming hollow by the side of a river, from which river, Mudfog derives an agreeable scent of pitch, tar, coals, and rope-yarn, a roving population in oilskin hats, a pretty steady influx of drunken bargemen, and a great many other maritime advantages.[.]\\*\\*\\*The Schoolboy's StoryBeing rather young at present-I am getting on in years, but still I am rather young-I have no particular adventures of my own to fall back upon.[.]\\*\\*\\*The Seven Poor TravellersStrictly speaking, there were only six Poor Travellers; but, being a Traveller myself, though an idle one, and being withal as poor as I hope to be, I brought the number up to seven.[.]\\*\\*\\*The Signal Man'Halloa! Below there!'When he heard a voice thus calling to him, he was standing at the door of his box, with a flag in his hand, furled round its short pole.[.]."
