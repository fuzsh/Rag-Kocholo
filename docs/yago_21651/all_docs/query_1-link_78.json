        "text": "Director Yorgos Lanthimos has created a film that takes audiences into a visually interesting and truly revolting world that made me ask why I had to sit through this. There is no beauty or authentic human connection in this film. Poor Things reminds me of that show from the 90s, Girls Gone Wild, where some perverted man with a camera would get college girls drunk and film them running around having sex with anything that moved.\n\nPoor Things, based on the novel by Alasdair Gray, is a take on Bride of Frankenstein, where a mad but brilliant scientist, Dr. Goodwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe, Platoon), reanimates a woman and names her Bella Baxter (Emma Stone, The Help). The film follows Bella as her infant brain develops in a young woman’s body. Bella is pretty much immediately obsessed with sex early on in the film. She starts by masturbating in front of other people at the dinner table and ends up experiencing life as a sex worker in a brothel in Paris, which, of course, is the trajectory for any young girl who is a sexual being, right?"
