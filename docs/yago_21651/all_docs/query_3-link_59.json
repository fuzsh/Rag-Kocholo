        "text": "Great directors don't always have great careers. The British film-maker Michael Reeves made only three films, between 1966 and 1968: The She-Beast, The Sorcerers, and Witchfinder General, his masterpiece. A year after making Witch-finder General, he died aged just 24, but left the world with three imaginative, low-budget movies, which - in their own modestly ambitious way - are superb examples of a very British type of cinema.\n\nReeves's love of film started young. At the age of eight, he announced to his mother that he wanted to be a film director; three years later, he made his first film, Carrion, which starred his friend Ian Ogilvy as a psychotic who attacks a girl in a wheelchair. Another regular Reeves collaborator, the writer Tom Baker, worked on the film, too. \"He didn't just want to make films, he wanted to make Hollywood movies,\" Baker recalls now. \"So we had to learn how to track. For this we used his mother's tea trolley with an 8mm Bolex on top.\"\n\nReeves and his mother were the poor relations of a rich family, and inherited money when Reeves was 15. He used the opportunity to take himself off to Hollywood at 17, and meet his hero, the action director Don Siegel. Somehow Reeves discovered where Siegel lived, and turned up on his doorstep, where the bewildered director appeared in a string vest and underpants. \"I've come all the way from England to meet you because you are the greatest director that ever lived,\" Reeves told him, and promptly found work in town.\n\nA year later he had convinced the producer Paul Maslansky to work with him on his own film, The She-Beast, to be shot in Rome and starring Ogilvy in his first major role. Reeves's goal was to make a scary movie, but cheap sets and corny lines made it obvious that nobody was going to be too scared by this tale of young holidaymakers terrorised by a monstrously deformed witch who comes back from the dead. So they camped it up instead. Made for £15,000, The She-Beast remains notable for making a leading lady of the already legendary horror film icon Barbara Steele, although she was booked for only a single day. \"I managed to get her for $1,000 for one day's work,\" Maslansky recalls, \"but I didn't say how long that day was. I made her work for 18 hours. She didn't speak to me for 20 years.\"\n\nHaving cut his horror teeth on The She-Beast, Reeves returned to England to make The Sorcerers, a brilliant forerunner of Being John Malkovich in which an old couple, Boris Karloff and Catherine Lacey, invent a machine that allows them to live vicariously through a dissolute young man (Ian Ogilvy, naturally). In an allegory for the vicarious thrills of cinema itself, the old couple's fun starts off innocently enough, with Ogilvy hanging out with groovy chicks and imbibing soft drinks at various swinging nightclubs, but slowly the old woman gets carried away and makes the young hipster carry out a series of increasingly gruesome acts.\n\nA moral forewarning of the dangers of a thrill-seeking lifestyle, The Sorcerers depicts an innocent time and makes it seem very sinister indeed, with nightclub scenes inevitably ending in bloodshed and various dolly birds - Susan George among them - coming to a grisly end.\n\nThe Sorcerers was made quickly, efficiently, and on next to nothing. \"We blew up a Jaguar in Notting Hill without permission,\" Ian Ogilvy remembers. \"The blast shattered windows for blocks around, then we ran like hell. We knew that if we didn't get the right shot within minutes, we'd be in jail for sure.\" Reeves had no problem with endangering the lives of his cast, either. He and Ogilvy filmed a motorbike scene on the M4 at 100mph. Ogilvy wore no helmet, Reeves was in the boot of a car with his camera, and he demanded that his leading man come closer and closer until he was within a metre of him.\n\nThen came Witchfinder General. In essence an English western, it is a tale of violent revenge based on the life of Matthew Hopkins, one of Oliver Cromwell's witch-hunters, who is alleged to have ordered the death of 200 people between 1645 and 1646. Hopkins, played with great relish and twisted moral arrogance by Vincent Price, travels through the Suffolk countryside with his thuggish henchman John Stearne and murders the innocent, ostensibly to cleanse the land of evil - but in reality for profit, sexual favours, and the sheer hell of it. When he turns his wicked attentions on an old priest and his daughter, he incurs the wrath of the daughter's husband, a Cromwellian soldier played (naturally) by Ian Ogilvy, who rises up against the witchfinder's dark power. It is a brutal, shockingly violent film, yet beautifully shot, capturing - with panoramic tracking shots - the rolling English landscape under a Turneresque sky. It is an example of something hardly seen today: a uniquely British film that portrays the country's elegance as well as its oppressiveness.\n\nAs usual, it had limited financial resources. Extra funding came from American International Pictures, and with that came Vincent Price. Used to the comfort of Hollywood, this revered, veteran actor was sent by his studio to the wilds of cold, damp and misty Suffolk, and into the hands of an extremely wilful and very resourceful 23-year-old director. The story goes that a short-tempered Reeves told Price to \"stop over-acting, please, please, please, stop rolling your eyes, and try and look natural for once.\" An offended Price replied: \"Young man, I've been in 84 films. How many have you made?\" \"Two good ones.\" At which Price burst into laughter and did exactly what the young man told him from then on. Price didn't even complain about the uncomfortable job of acting the final sequence, in which Ogilvy beats Hopkins to death with a hammer - rubber, but still rather painful for the ageing actor.\n\nThe film was shot over five weeks in Suffolk, using a single Arriflex camera, by cinematographer John Coquillon. The few sets used were built locally, and a disused second world war aircraft hangar (rented for £50 a week) was the production base.\n\nLighting came courtesy of Lee Electric, who provided a noisy generator free of charge. According to Coquillon: \"Michael was 25 years ahead of his time, with the eye and the imagination of a veteran. I still wonder whether we ever worried our producers about our way of shooting Witchfinder. We were determined to make it our way and not in the conventional, accepted, boring (to us) ways of those times.\" According to Ogilvy, such conditions helped create great cinema: \"[Reeves's] ability to make do is what makes his films so interesting. How to get over a bad situation.\"\n\nUpon release, Witchfinder General was a critical and commercial success, despite cuts by censors concerned by its violence. Reeves was quickly swamped with scripts, but rejected most of them outright, and fell into depression. Always secretly prone to the condition, he began drinking heavily and taking anti-depressants. \"He would shut right down, maybe three to four months before he died,\" Witchfinder's writer, Tom Baker, remembers. After a couple of abandoned projects, Reeves came home one night after a skinful and had insomnia. The coroner's report states that he took a handful of anti-depressants and was found dead in the morning.\n\nWhat Reeves might have gone on to achieve is hinted at by a letter from his old cinematographer Coquillon to the American director Jeff Burr, written in 1983. Coquillon recalls a telephone conversation with Reeves when he was in Los Angeles, shortly before he died. \"One day he called me full of excitement. He'd found the story. We were going to ride around the US, shoot in 16mm and shoot every which way, into the sun and out of the sun - on motorcycles. The actor was to be a long-time LA buddy - a completely unknown son of an actor - name of Peter Fonda. The film was to be called Easy Rider. It was while planning this movie that Michael Reeves died. I still mourn the man and miss him. Always will. One doesn't get to meet many people like him.\""
