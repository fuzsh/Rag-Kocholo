        "text": "The following analysis may contain some spoilers.\n\nI watched ‘Poor Things’ a month ago, but have been loathe to write about it because it felt a bit like being a party-pooper: the film deliberately invites many readings, and I didn’t want to take away from viewers’ clean-slate experience of this many-splendoured film by imposing my own.\n\nYet, the noise around the film and the many divisive opinions it has engendered, especially among Anglo-Saxon audiences, has me befuddled. Some have accused the film of condoning paedophilia. Others find the use of shameless sexual adventuring as a path to female liberation problematic. Even others have critiqued the film’s male characters as “one-note,” or found the association of socialism with female emancipation to be just another example of the director’s naive, misdirected politics.\n\nI understand where all these perspectives are coming from, and I can even follow their reasoning, but over the past month all I’ve been thinking is how completely beside the point all these readings are.\n\nThe first rule of film analysis is a clear one: if you look closely at a film, it will teach you how to read it. So from the very first frame of ‘Poor Things’, when we enter a bizarre black-and-white world that seems part-Victorian London and part-sci-fi fantasy through a deliberately warped fisheye lens, director Yorgos Lanthimos is telling the viewer one very important thing: this is not the real world, even though it may look like it. The clues are everywhere: a duck walks like a dog, a steam-powered carriage has a horse’s head, a man’s ragged face has been cut up and put back together, and a dissonant four-note background score reminds us we are in a world of science experiments gone wild.\n\nThis world has its own rules, or lack of them. It is a world in which a woman’s unborn child’s brain can be reinserted into her body to resuscitate it. In which this woman-child goes through an accelerated state of development free of conventional parental figures or the mores of social conditioning. A world in which a woman can have a lot of sex (or “furious jumping” — which I think we should all call it from now on!) with little to no consequences. Where she is completely free of shame and never in any real danger.\n\nIs Bella Baxter a woman, then, like a woman in the real world? Clearly not, she is a thought experiment, a physical embodiment of a question we’ve all wondered to ourselves: what might women be like if they were free of the shackles of social conditioning in a world without consequences? And the film never presents her journey as the definitive answer to that question, but as merely one of many possibilities. Bella Baxter‘s very individuality lies in her seemingly hedonistic and voracious desire to explore the world. In fact, when her master-creator runs an experiment on another woman to console himself in her absence, the resultant creation is very much unlike Bella.\n\nA more instructive way to read this film then would be as a satirical allegory: not the story of an individual woman, but a story of her place in society. This world is not our own, yes, but it’s not too far from it either. Horrific truths underlie its fantasy. For instance, the father of modern gynaecology was an American doctor called J. Sims who performed surgery on female slaves without anaesthesia or consent, so the Frankenstein-like premise of this story in which the butcher-like-surgeon Godwin is literally Bella’s ‘God and saviour’ reflects a problematic power dynamic that existed not so long ago, and echoes the fact that the medical community is only now waking up to how little is still known about the female body because of this male bias. When Bella unknowingly returns to an abusive ex, she realises he wants to perform a mutilation procedure on her to erase her ability to experience pleasure, a practice that still exists in some communities today.\n\nWhat of the fact that a slimy older man touches a young Bella without her consent in the film (the same that has all the moralists crying pedophilia?) Uncomfortable and shocking though that scene is, it does reflect a real world in which many young girls are taken advantage of by predators, often sadly becoming their first introduction to their own sexuality. Is Lanthimos’ depiction a problem or how close this scene is to the tragedies of real life? As another blazingly poignant film of this year (‘How to Have Sex’ by female director Molly Manning Walker) has shown, young adolescent women grow up in a world that relentlessly sexualises them and pressures them to trade their bodies in exchange for love. Can we really argue the mental development of 14 or 16- year-olds is complete and that they are equipped with a full range of vocabulary to understand their own bodies or the sexual act itself? Isn’t Bella Baxter simply an extreme reflection of a society that already fetishizes young female bodies, deprives them of full agency, and uses it for any number of ends?\n\nLet us go back to the golden rule then, and read this film by following the clues of its craft. When we first see this world, we see it in grainy black-and-white, the film nodding its hat to Frankenstein. Apart from the warped fish-eye frames and the character oddities which serve to remind us of its artifice, this is very much an objective, omniscient view. We are looking at this woman-child from the same point of view as the two men who are her self-appointed guardians. When they try to restrict her from jumping from the carriage to explore the outside world, we share their fear and want to protect her by restricting her in the same way.\n\nBut then, Bella Baxter grows up, rapidly. (Astute observers will note the scene where it is revealed to us that she does menstruate.) She starts to form full sentences, discovers the delights of a cucumber and is drawn to the idea of travelling the world with an adventurous cad who obviously does not have her best intentions at heart.\n\nAnd then? From the moment Godwin gives her “permission” to go off exploring with the rakish Duncan Wedderburn, the film bursts into technicolour, adopting the widest of frames yet putting us firmly in Bella’s subjective point of view (Interestingly, this is a deliberate departure from Alasdair Gray’s book, which tells the story from a third-person perspective right till the end.) Anchored by Emma Stone’s guileless, radiant performance, we too see the world as her. From her vantage point, it’s a giant candyland, a plethora of hedonistic delights to dig into without any shame. We may not agree with some of Bella’s more extreme choices, but we sure as hell root for her until the end. Everything from the costumes to the set design reflects her psychological evolution, as she goes from white Victorian gowns to skirts and outsized sleeves, from sunny, optimistic Lisbon to the ominous high seas, oppressive Alexandria to cold and rational Paris. As a translator, I was especially tickled and suitably thrilled by Bella’s playful turns of phrase which are funny but also revelatory of the way language sometimes conspires to serve the patriarchy. Take for example, the lovely “My hand is taken by another. You do not just take the hand, but all, do you not?” or the hilarious “So you wish to marry me or kill me? Is that the proposal?”\n\nIt is tempting to see this film as being about the evolution of a woman, which is its obvious reading. But as an allegory about the evolution of women, it offers many more readings. A psychological take could, for instance see Godwin as the subject of a classic castration complex à la Freud. Triangulating him with the seemingly asexual/meek Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef) and the voraciously sexual Bella offers a strange inversion of the parent-child dynamic. Godwin is also grotesque but humanised, and when he confesses how his father treated him in a scene stunningly performed by Willem Defoe, we see how intergenerational trauma works. In fact, through her evolution, Bella Baxter breaks the cycle when she regains her sense of agency and actively forgives his “sins.” Their odd father-daughter-like relationship makes for a tender heart to the story and throws up a poignant question: what does it mean to mother oneself? Or to parent a parent? To be a woman that takes full responsibility for her life, away from familial conditioning?\n\nEqually, a philosophical reading of the story would see Bella’s evolution as moving from pre-verbal childhood wonder to indulgent hedonism, followed by a brief diversion into nihilism, an experimentation with rational socialism when she works in a brothel in Paris (another part of the film that has had many feminists up in arms!) before finally settling into some kind of egalitarian utopia when she returns to London. Again, if we read this not as Bella’s individual story, but rather as an allegory about the evolution of womenkind, we would be less shocked by some of the specifics and encouraged to reflect on the different stages through which feminism has evolved over time. Didn’t the invention of the pill encourage a kind of unfettered, reckless sense of sexual liberation that women are now reconsidering? Aren’t feminists now understanding how their sexuality has been instrumentalised in some aspects of the workplace? Can we read the ending of the film as a kind of sexless egalitarianism that mirrors some strains of modern feminism?\n\n‘Poor Things’ is, of course, not a perfect film. I agree with those critics who found the scenes in the brothel to be too dragged out and uncomfortably voyeuristic — perhaps because Bella’s sexual awakening earlier in the film is shot from her perspective, bursting with joy, while the sections in the brothel are shot from an objective perspective to reflect the inherent power dynamic that no amount of agency can seemingly erase. Yet, we must remember that Bella chooses this path, just as Emma Stone chose to represent it, not just in her capacity as actor but as the producer of the film. The flamboyant style of the film also starts to lose its fizz in the second half of the film, and the parts where Bella sees the “real poverty” out in the world feel a bit didactic in a film that otherwise tries to be an exploration rather than a statement.\n\nBut by the end, it is the men around Bella who are chastened, transformed or — as in the hilarious case of Duncan Wedderburn (a scene-stealing Mark Ruffalo)— driven to literal insanity by her resolute desire to make her own choices. Growing up without shame allows Bella to experience her own sexual desire divorced from societal obligations to procreate, and unsurprisingly, she chooses not to be a mother as a result: an especially poignant choice if we consider that the previous version of her jumped off a bridge because she was pregnant. Bella has chosen to mother herself. In another of the film’s delicious linguistic inversions, one wonders if the title “poor things” refers to the woman at the centre or the men around her?"
