        "meta_description": "The Poor Relation: With May Buckley, John Halliday, Violet Reed, Harry Myers. Winnie is made to wait upon her step-mother and half-sister until worn out. An artist friend named John is about to paint a picture of his future wife for exhibition at the salon. Mabel, the half-sister, is anxious to pose as the model and her mother encouraged the idea. A party takes place and cousin John and Hal are there. Winnie is not permitted to join in the enjoyment, but sits in the hall to wait upon the guests. Cousin John discovers her and is struck by her forlorn appearance. Next day John is trying to make a sketch of Mabel for his picture, but she does not seem to be his ideal. Winnie must be his model. A few days later John goes to Winnie's house and finds her working. He takes her in his automobile and drives to the studio. There he finds his swell friends, and Mabel, in a fever of expectation to see the picture, supposes it to be of herself. The picture is covered with a velvet curtain, which on being drawn aside, discloses a beautiful painting of Winnie.",

        "text": "A Cinderella-like picture of modern life, featuring Miss May Buckley as the poor relation of a very bad-tempered aunt and cousin. The story is not powerfully convincing in its details, but, broadly viewed, it is satisfying. It has some very pretty scenes, one of these is a dance in a big hall with a balcony above and the stairs. There are many pretty girls in this picture and distinguished gowns. The poor relation, slavey and maid of all work that she is, isn't permitted to come down. She watches the dancers from the balcony and there the man who stands for the prince of the old story finds her and falls in love with her. It is a very pretty picture with good humored comedy; the leading lady gave a clear interpretation and she was well supported. It was well photographed and the audience seemed to be delighted with it. If carefully put on, it will serve as a feature. It has no especial strength, though, as a story. - The Moving Picture World, February 17, 1912"
