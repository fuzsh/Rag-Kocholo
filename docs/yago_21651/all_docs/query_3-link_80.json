        "text": "Oh well, back on here again.....Thought I might start a war by asking the question as above. Would you all, given the chance, sell\n\nor swap your 944's for 911's? I'm going to keep my 944 Turbo now,more out of spite than anything else. I've never had so much\n\ntrouble in trying to sell a car in my life! I say \"out of spite\" because, I've spent so much money on Him that NO WAY am I going to\n\ngive Him away and let someone else benefit from all my efforts! Had a couple of comments recently on the pedigree of 944's,\n\nmade by 911 owners (air and water cooled), saying that the front engine models are not true Porsche's. I never got involved in\n\nany arguments as, to be perfectly honest, I'm not too sure. What say you all. Also, am I asking too much for my car at 10k?\n\nJon' Mitchell reckons 12k is nearer to it and, I trust Jon's judgement on all things Porsche. It don't really matter too much any\n\nmore as, It looks like I will be keeping the \"car that no-body want's\" after all. Much to my wife's delight (and Sid's). And, now\n\nthat my brief \"foray\" into the world of mk1 savage Cortina's has come to a premature end, it looks like I will be making a five\n\nhundred quid a month, direct debit arrangement in favour of Mr JMG [8D][ ]!!!\n\nThe last 911 I went in was a RUF BTR. From the passenger seat I quite enjoyed the sense of occasion and the old car feel, but truth be told it remains a souped-up beetle. As much as it felt good while hooning around town with everybody nodding/smiling/raising their thumbs at us (well, in civilised Germany at least), or leaving for dead a smiling 997 driver who asked for some show, never will anyone see me spend any money on these relics. I like my 944s because they are precisely what the typical 911 isn't.\n\nA bit early in the year for old chestnuts, isn't it?[ ] But to answer the question, no, not in my view. We have as many, if not more, 944s that turn out for our region events and I think they are a) great cars and b) every bit as equal as any other Porsche. And what about the 928? Another great car. If I could justify yet another toy I would love to have a 944 (turbo, of course!) or 968CS.[ ]\n\nI think that 944s are a pedigree performance bargain and that's why I have one as a toy. I had planned to get a 996 GT2, but honestly the value of the car would not have allowed me to enjoy it and I managed to recognise that; I bought a 944 instead and have no regrets at all.\n\n911s look and sound great, but really they're seriously flawed to drive (or dull, if modern). For me a 928 is a little too big and \"GT\" for a toy, but I bet it's better dynamically and aurally than a 911; it was designed to be, after all.\n\nThere are too many in the 911 set (not all, by any means) that are only really interested in the (\"investment\") value of their cars, whereas 944 drivers like them because they're really rather fun to drive and incredibly good value. Almost all reviews of the 944 Turbo at launch-time mention that it was just as quick and handled better than the much more expensive 911s of the day and that still applies.\n\nIt's a shame (for a seller, but definitely not a buyer) that the market value of the 944 is less than a 911, but it doesn't mean it's a worse car; just less appreciated/known about by the buying public. I'd have been extremely happy to have bought your car for £10K if I did not already have a 944!\n\nRuss\n\nI've mever seen a Porsche built before the mid 1990s that I didn't like, and I've never heard an owner of an air cooled car say a 944 isn't a real Porsche. However, financially some front engined cars are poor relations, others like the 924CGT, are highly valued. Similarly some 911s are currently highly valued, where as the 996 and early Boxster are practically being given away. So I think there are too many sweeping generalisations in the original post.\n\nThat said, if you want a high price for a car which has few potential buyers then you have to be prepared to wait a long time, and if you need to sell it in a hurry then that price is always a lot lower.\n\nI just don't think there is a bias against the front-engined models, other than a few ill-informed idiots. Most of them aren't Porsche owners anyway, and would be as likely to tell 911 owners they are \"only Beetles underneath\", as they are to say \"the 944 is just a VW isn't it?\".\n\nNo other sports car manufacturer has made such a wide range of cars as Porsche. There probably isn't a car club anywhere with such a diverse range of members, either, and why should we feel we have to get on with all of them?\n\nWhen you start to talk to people, you soon find that most members have owned front-engined models before their 911s, or still do. If you volunteer to man one of the exhibitions or shows, you'll be bored to tears with people who had one and loved it, regret selling it even now, would love another....[&:]\n\nIt's a perception, not a fact. I'd be more inclined to think that the 4x4 Porsches would be the cars considered \"less than a real Porsche\". Re-badged VWs, cynical brand-exploitation, too mass-produced: we've been there with every car Porsche have ever made, and it's still rubbish!\n\nPete, your car is very specialized. It could take many months to find the right buyer, and I think 6 weeks is just too soon to say it's unwanted! [ ]\n\nSo I've got Front Engined, Rear Engined and 4 x 4. here's my thoughts\n\n944 Turbo : Fast (very fast if you are on boost), great to drive, aggressive looks with the rear arches, plenty of room in boot, comfortable driving position, excellent value and should appreciate in the future\n\n964 Anniversary : lovely sound, 4WD, beautiful looks, good to drive but you have to concentrate more than in the 944 on a Motorway run or you can find your speed dropping down easily, decent power but not a 944 Turbo. Prices have already gone upwards for manual, low mileage cars and they are classed as an investment to some\n\nCayenne Turbo : a 911 on stilts [ ] 40-120 faster than my 944 and 964, top speed - CRAZY, comfort, 4WD and modern safety\n\nAll 3 models have different uses for me. The Cayenne is my daily driver and I love it, but next week I am looking forward to doing 1500 miles in the 944 in Germany, Holland, France etc. as it is a drivers car and will be suited to the A roads we are hoping to be driving on in the German National Parks.\n\nI could have sold my 944 recently for money that would have got me into a 996 or Boxster, decided to decline the offer as I consider my car is far better built, cheaper to run and in the long term will be a better investment.\n\nPrices are on the up for better examples and they are of an age where a price generalisation cannot be made, each car must be priced on its own merits.\n\nI also think the ad' for your Turbo turned into a 'life story' instead of just remaining a 'car for sale' advert, if you want to sell give it time but constantly changing your mind is perhaps affecting how people view your car but not 944's in general.\n\nPaul\n\nCertainly not poor relations but rather performance bargains, which is great for those buying into 944 ownership, but not so great if you are trying to sell - especially at the top end of things with a well modded turbo. I do think that values will firm up a bit as the dross goes to that great scrap heap in the sky and the image of our cars is certainly improving driven by positive media articles and nostalgia. Never expect them to make 911 money though and to my mind that's no bad thing.\n\nTo answer the original question, no not really tempted to trade in for a 911 - any model vaguely contemporary to our cars are in my opinion demonstrably inferior in everything except engine note and the more modern stuff are a totally different kettle of fish so no ta not for me.\n\nI like both 911's and 944s and even the 924 but my choice is a 944s2 because its great value ,beautifull looking and great to drive\n\n911's are alot more money too much in my view and it would worry me constantly where to park ,924s are great little things even the 2.0\n\nthe turbos are alot of fun but that dashboard and the constantly leaking fuel tanks on everyone ive ever seen puts me off\n\n968's are nice I'd have one of those as would I have a late 928 but for the moment I'm very happy with my 944s2\n\nI like all Porsches. I have a 944 because it's the car I wanted when I was a boy. I have an S2 cause it was the best car I looked at when I was buying, I also got it for about half of what it was worth at the time as the owner thought it had an engine problem ( misaligned balance belt ). I was also looking at 964's at the time when I bought my car. I had a 924 for 9 years and loved it. I don't much care for modern Porsche's as to me they just don't feel like a real Porsche.They are too flimsy feeling and just don't feel special enough. You could be in a top end Toyota or any other production car."
