        "text": "What Is Corporate Governance?\n\nCorporate governance is the system of rules, practices, and processes by which a company is directed and controlled. Corporate governance essentially involves balancing the interests of a company's many stakeholders, which can include shareholders, senior management, customers, suppliers, lenders, the government, and the community. As such, corporate governance encompasses practically every sphere of management, from action plans and internal controls to performance measurement and corporate disclosure.\n\nUnderstanding Corporate Governance\n\nGovernance refers to the set of rules, controls, policies, and resolutions put in place to direct corporate behavior. A board of directors is pivotal in governance, while proxy advisors and shareholders are important stakeholders who can affect governance.\n\nCommunicating a company's corporate governance is a key component of community and investor relations. For instance, Apple Inc.'s investor relations site profiles its corporate leadership (the executive team and board of directors) and provides information on its committee charters and governance documents, such as bylaws, stock ownership guidelines, and articles of incorporation.\n\nMost successful companies strive to have exemplary corporate governance. For many shareholders, it is not enough for a company to be profitable; it also must demonstrate good corporate citizenship through environmental awareness, ethical behavior, and other sound corporate governance practices.\n\nBenefits of Corporate Governance\n\nGood corporate governance creates transparent rules and controls, guides leadership, and aligns the interests of shareholders, directors, management, and employees.\n\nIt helps build trust with investors, the community, and public officials.\n\nCorporate governance can give investors and stakeholders a clear idea of a company's direction and business integrity.\n\nIt promotes long-term financial viability, opportunity, and returns.\n\nIt can facilitate the raising of capital.\n\nGood corporate governance can translate to rising share prices.\n\nIt can reduce the potential for financial loss, waste, risks, and corruption.\n\nIt is a game plan for resilience and long-term success.\n\nCorporate Governance and the Board of Directors\n\nThe board of directors is the primary direct stakeholder influencing corporate governance. Directors are elected by shareholders or appointed by other board members and charged with representing the interests of the company's shareholders.\n\nThe board is tasked with making important decisions, such as corporate officer appointments, executive compensation, and dividend policy. In some instances, board obligations stretch beyond financial optimization, as when shareholder resolutions call for certain social or environmental concerns to be prioritized.\n\nBoards are often made up of a mix of insiders and independent members. Insiders are generally major shareholders, founders, and executives. Independent directors do not share the ties that insiders have. They are typically chosen for their experience managing or directing other large companies. Independents are considered helpful for governance because they dilute the concentration of power and help align shareholder interests with those of the insiders.\n\nThe board of directors must ensure that the company's corporate governance policies incorporate corporate strategy, risk management, accountability, transparency, and ethical business practices.\n\nThe Principles of Corporate Governance\n\nWhile there can be as many principles as a company believes make sense, some of the most common ones are:\n\nFairness: The board of directors must treat shareholders, employees, vendors, and communities fairly and with equal consideration.\n\nTransparency: The board should provide timely, accurate, and clear information about such things as financial performance, conflicts of interest, and risks to shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\nRisk Management: The board and management must determine risks of all kinds and how best to control them. They must act on those recommendations to manage risks and inform all relevant parties about the existence and status of risks.\n\nResponsibility: The board is responsible for the oversight of corporate matters and management activities. It must be aware of and support the successful, ongoing performance of the company. Part of its responsibility is to recruit and hire a chief executive officer (CEO). It must act in the best interests of a company and its investors.\n\nAccountability: The board must explain the purpose of a company's activities and the results of its conduct. It and company leadership are accountable for the assessment of a company's capacity, potential, and performance. It must communicate issues of importance to shareholders.\n\nCorporate Governance Models\n\nThere are many types of corporate governance that a company might follow. Some use a traditional hierarchical leadership structure, and others are more flexible. Different corporate governance models may be found throughout the world. Here are a few of them.\n\nThe Anglo-American Model\n\nThis model can take various forms, such as the Shareholder, Stewardship, and Political Models. The Shareholder Model is the principal model at present.\n\nThe Shareholder Model is designed so that the board of directors and shareholders are in control. Stakeholders such as vendors and employees, though acknowledged, lack control.\n\nManagement is tasked with running the company in a way that maximizes shareholder interest. Importantly, proper incentives should be made available to align management behavior with the goals of shareholders/owners.\n\nThe model accounts for the fact that shareholders provide the company with funds and may withdraw that support if dissatisfied. This is supposed to keep management working effectively.\n\nThe board will usually consist of both insiders and independent members. Although traditionally, the board chairperson and the CEO can be the same, this model seeks to have two different people hold those roles.\n\nThe success of this corporate governance model depends on ongoing communications among the board, company management, and the shareholders. Important issues are brought to shareholders' attention. Important decisions that need to be made are put to shareholders for a vote.\n\nU.S. regulatory authorities tend to support shareholders over boards and executive management.\n\nThe Continental Model\n\nTwo groups represent the controlling authority under the Continental Model. They are the supervisory board and the management board.\n\nIn this two-tiered system, the management board is composed of company insiders, such as its executives. The supervisory board is made up of outsiders, such as shareholders and union representatives. Banks with stakes in a company also could have representatives on the supervisory board.\n\nThe two boards remain entirely separate. The size of the supervisory board is determined by a country's laws and can't be changed by shareholders.\n\nNational interests have a strong influence on corporations with this model of corporate governance. Companies can be expected to align with government objectives.\n\nThis model also greatly values the engagement of stakeholders, as they can support and strengthen a company's continued operations.\n\nThe Japanese Model\n\nThe key players in the Japanese Model of corporate governance are banks, affiliated entities, major shareholders called Keiretsu (who may be invested in common companies or have trading relationships), management, and the government. Smaller, independent, individual shareholders have no role or voice. Together, these key players establish and control corporate governance.\n\nThe board of directors is usually made up of insiders, including company executives. Keiretsu may remove directors from the board if profits wane.\n\nThe government affects the activities of corporate management via its regulations and policies.\n\nIn this model, corporate transparency is less likely because of the concentration of power and the focus on the interests of those with that power.\n\nHow to Assess Corporate Governance\n\nAs an investor, you want to select companies that practice good corporate governance in the hope that you can thereby avoid losses and other negative consequences such as bankruptcy.\n\nYou can research certain areas of a company to determine whether or not it's practicing good corporate governance. These areas include:\n\nDisclosure practices\n\nExecutive compensation structure (whether it's tied only to performance or also to other metrics)\n\nRisk management (the checks and balances on decision-making)\n\nPolicies and procedures for reconciling conflicts of interest (how the company approaches business decisions that might conflict with its mission statement)\n\nThe members of the board of directors (their stake in profits or conflicting interests)\n\nContractual and social obligations (how a company approaches issues such as climate change)\n\nRelationships with vendors\n\nComplaints received from shareholders and how they were addressed\n\nAudits (the frequency of internal and external audits and how any issues that those audits raised have been handled)\n\nTypes of bad governance practices include:\n\nCompanies that do not cooperate sufficiently with auditors or do not select auditors with the appropriate scale, resulting in the publication of spurious or noncompliant financial documents\n\nExecutive compensation packages that fail to create an optimal incentive for corporate officers\n\nPoorly structured boards that make it too difficult for shareholders to oust ineffective incumbents.\n\nExamples of Corporate Governance: Bad and Good\n\nBad corporate governance can cast doubt on a company's reliability, integrity, or obligation to shareholders. All can have implications for the financial health of the business.\n\nVolkswagen AG\n\nTolerance or support of illegal activities can create scandals like the one that rocked Volkswagen AG starting in September 2015. The details of \"Dieselgate\" (as the affair came to be known) revealed that for years, the automaker had deliberately and systematically rigged engine emission equipment in its cars to manipulate pollution test results in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nVolkswagen saw its stock shed nearly half its value in the days following the start of the scandal. Its global sales in the first full month following the news fell 4.5%.\n\nVW's board structure facilitated the emissions rigging and was a reason it wasn't caught earlier. In contrast to a one-tier board system common to most U.S. companies, VW had a two-tier board system consisting of a management board and a supervisory board, in keeping with the Continental Model of corporate governance.\n\nThe supervisory board was meant to monitor management and approve corporate decisions. However, it lacked the independence and authority to carry out these roles appropriately.\n\nThe supervisory board included a large portion of shareholders. Ninety percent of shareholder voting rights were controlled by members of the board. There was no real independent supervisor. As a result, shareholders were in control and negated the purpose of the supervisory board, which was to oversee management and employees, and how they operated. This allowed the rigged emissions to occur.\n\nEnron\n\nPublic and government concern about corporate governance tends to wax and wane. Often, however, highly publicized revelations of corporate malfeasance revive interest in the subject.\n\nFor example, corporate governance became a pressing issue in the United States at the turn of the 21st century, after fraudulent practices bankrupted high-profile companies such as Enron and WorldCom.\n\nThe problem with Enron was that its board of directors waived many rules related to conflicts of interest by allowing the chief financial officer (CFO), Andrew Fastow, to create independent, private partnerships to do business with Enron.\n\nThese private partnerships were used to hide Enron's debts and liabilities. If they'd been accounted for properly, they would have reduced the company's profits significantly.\n\nEnron's lack of corporate governance allowed the creation of the entities that hid the losses. The company also employed dishonest people, from Fastow down to its traders, who made illegal moves in the markets.\n\nThe Enron scandal and others in the same period resulted in the 2002 passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. It imposed more stringent recordkeeping requirements on companies and stiff criminal penalties for violating them and other securities laws. The aim was to restore confidence in public companies and how they operate.\n\nPepsiCo\n\nIt's common to hear examples of bad corporate governance. In fact, it's often why companies end up in the news. You rarely hear about companies with good corporate governance because their corporate guiding policies keep them out of trouble.\n\nOne company that seems to have consistently practiced good corporate governance, and adapts or updates it often, is PepsiCo. In drafting its 2020 proxy statement, PepsiCo sought input from investors in six areas:\n\nBoard composition, diversity, and refreshment, plus leadership structure\n\nLong-term strategy, corporate purpose, and sustainability issues\n\nGood governance practices and ethical corporate culture\n\nHuman capital management\n\nCompensation discussion and analysis\n\nShareholder and stakeholder engagement\n\nThe company included in its proxy statement a graphic of its current leadership structure. It showed a combined chair and CEO along with an independent presiding director and a link between the company's \"Winning With Purpose\" vision and changes to the executive compensation program.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCorporate governance consists of the guiding principles that a company puts in place to direct all of its operations, from compensation, risk management, and employee treatment to reporting unfair practices, dealing with the impact on the climate, and more.\n\nCorporate governance that calls for upstanding, transparent behavior can lead a company to make ethical decisions that will benefit all of its stakeholders, including investors. Bad corporate governance can lead to the breakdown of a company, often resulting in scandal and bankruptcy."
