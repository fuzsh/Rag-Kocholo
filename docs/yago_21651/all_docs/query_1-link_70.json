        "text": "Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos | USA | 2023 | 2h 22m | Starring Emma Stone, Mark Ruffalo, Willem Dafoe, Ramy Youssef, Kathryn Hunter\n\nAfter being bought back to life by an unconventional scientist, a young woman finds herself in a fantastical world she’s eager to explore. Yearning for experiences and knowledge, she embarks on a whirlwind adventure across continents with a charismatic and adventurous lawyer. Yorgos Lanthimos, the Oscar-winning director of The Favourite, reunites with Emma Stone in this wildly imaginative, provocative, and humorous take on the classic Frankenstein story.\n\nWinner of the Golden Lion award (Best Film) at the 2023 Venice Film Festival. Winner of 4 BAFTAs and Oscars, including Best Actress.\n\nReviews\n\n‘Poor Things is the best film of Lanthimos’ career and already feels like an instant classic, mordantly funny, whimsical and wacky, unprecious and unpretentious, filled with so much to adore that to try and parse it all here feels like a pitiful response to the film’s ambitions.’\n\n★★★★★\n\nRyan Lattanzio, IndieWire\n\n‘Everything in it – every frame, every image, every joke, every performance – gets a gasp of excitement.’\n\n★★★★★\n\nPeter Bradshaw, The Guardian"
