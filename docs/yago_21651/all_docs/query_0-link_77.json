        "text": "Imagine that your local library has a dozen of Shakespeare’s plays, a couple of novels by Toni Morrison, and a random smattering of Henry James—and there isn’t even a central research library for on-site consultation of classics unavailable for home reading. That’s the dire situation with classic movies and, indeed, with the homegrown classics of Hollywood, which—long at the mercy of film distribution, then of VHS and DVD and Blu-ray release—are now at the mercy of streaming services’ contracts and policies of calculated scarcity. If you’ve got physical media, cling to it for dear life. If not, take your chances online, where the offerings are haphazard—in some cases, cheeringly copious, and, in others, direly depleted. (Dig around; things turn up.) But offerings of what, exactly?\n\nThe short answer: movies from the reign of the studio system, from the early days of Hollywood film production in the nineteen-tens to the historical dividing line of 1968. What follows is a personal list based on what I love about that system in that era: the directors who worked there then. My passion for Hollywood is rooted in my own experience—namely, of having long been dismissive of it, as a child of the sixties who considered Hollywood to be an ambulatory Las Vegas. Like most people, I went to see popular movies with friends, and took the occasion to be a social one, not at all an artistic one that was comparable to the gratification I got from music or books.\n\nThen, at seventeen, I was struck by lightning—Jean-Luc Godard’s “Breathless.” It was a conversion experience: I knew from that moment on that my life would be intimately bound with movies. But I didn’t know that this famously referential film was indeed so, because I didn’t know what a film noir was; the movie showed a picture of Humphrey Bogart, but I had no idea who that was. Very soon thereafter, I read the book “Godard on Godard,” which turned out to be a collection of Godard’s film writings from the fifties and sixties, and where I was surprised to discover that he loved Hollywood movies of that time. In a piece Godard wrote in 1952, at the age of twenty-one, he said that the “greatest American artist” was Howard Hawks.\n\nWho? I’d never heard of him, and I was determined—in that pre-home-video era of the mid-seventies—to find out. When a New York revival house showed a film directed by Hawks, I went. The movie was “Bringing Up Baby,” and, as soon as I saw it, I felt that I got it: that it was a movie “by” this guy Howard Hawks in the same way that a novel is by its author or a piece of music is by its composer. I had seen that movie as a personal creation, not because Godard told me so, and not because the word “auteur” meant anything to me at the time, but because of my feeling, while watching it, that one person was conveying a world view to me. I became an auteurist by experience, and I’ve come to believe that this experience parallels, at several decades’ remove, the way that the idea was formed by the French critics (and, eventually, New Wave filmmakers) as they watched movies that enthralled them—not as a premise but as a discovery. Their sense of immediate mental connection with directors is a description of their particularly creative viewing of movies—one that does more than provide pleasure but inspires new filmmakers and opens pathways for the art of cinema.\n\nIt’s obviously not the only way to watch movies. There’s much to love about them, including performances (though it’s no coincidence that most actors are at their best in the best directors’ films), dialogue (often the best directors have a far more active hand in the script than the credits suggest), and even scores. But it’s the way that I’ve found to be the most fruitful, stimulating, and enlightening approach to classic Hollywood. There’s also much to rue and even despise about classic Hollywood, starting with its exclusions. The industry and those who made their way in it reflect the gross political and social defects and moral ills of American society at large, by excluding women, nonwhite people, and people of the wrong political persuasion from the ranks of directors, and by perpetuating exclusions and stereotypes onscreen, including in many films of exemplary artistry. Identifying these errors is yet another crucial part of the moviegoing experience.\n\nI’ve organized this list by directors—the ones who have long mattered most to me—and by gathering not their most famous or most acclaimed films but the ones that I’ve obsessed over most strongly or returned to most often. For encyclopedias, turn elsewhere. (And I’ve left off this list movies that have wonderful performances—Mae West! The Nicholas Brothers! The Marx Brothers!—and little else. We’ll gather those another time.) These Hollywood filmmakers and films exemplify the spirit that, now, in the all-but-post-studio era, energizes independent filmmaking, as well as the most daring big-budget filmmakers—and make the practice of criticism a live wire of excitement. To make virtual psychological contact with directors is to watch movies in the future tense.\n\n[Film titles preceded with an asterisk are not available to stream.]\n\nRobert Aldrich\n\nIt’s indicative of the dismaying vagaries of the streaming world that one of the most original and most influential of Hollywood films, Robert Aldrich’s film noir “Kiss Me Deadly,” isn’t available on any commercial service. With this slangy, sleazy, politicized adaptation of a Mickey Spillane novel, Aldrich pushed the style, the tone, and the mythology of film noir to apocalyptic extremes. (There’s violence here more shocking than in “Bonnie and Clyde.”) Throughout his career, Aldrich replicated this film’s world-shattering frenzy, if not its stylistic heights, in a wide range of settings and stories, including the romantic melodrama of “Autumn Leaves” and the inside-Hollywood exposé of “The Legend of Lylah Clare.”\n\n*“Kiss Me Deadly”\n\n*“Autumn Leaves”\n\n“The Legend of Lylah Clare” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\nDorothy Arzner\n\n“Dance, Girl, Dance,” from 1940, a furious and sardonic drama about the lives of actresses in the face of a leering male public, was made by the only female director with a busy career in classic-era talking pictures. Dorothy Arzner filmed female characters who needed nerves of steel and boundless courage in order to withstand men’s power and prerogatives. Her confrontational style is matched by her refined connoisseurship—an eye for the dance that also looked ahead to a realm of self-conscious cinematic artistry that the studios couldn’t contain. It’s her penultimate film; she died in 1979.\n\n“Dance, Girl, Dance” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“The Bride Wore Red” (Apple TV and Prime Video)\n\n*“Merrily We Go to Hell”\n\nBusby Berkeley\n\nWrongly taken as a mere ornamentalist—even worse, sometimes mistaken for a fascist—Busby Berkeley was an erotic sociobiologist, an unlettered philosopher in visual music. It doesn’t take Sigmund Freud to see the sex in his dance numbers featuring a wedding-night bedtime or giant bananas, but the virtuosity of Berkeley’s rhythmic method aimed at more: the formation of personality, the emergence of character traits in society, as performances of desire. In his giddy, gaudy way, Berkeley pursued his obsessions in a style that reflected his own thrill in his visions—and their inseparability from thought and instinct alike.\n\n“The Gang’s All Here” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“42nd Street” (HBO Max, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“Dames” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\nBudd Boetticher\n\nA gaunt, stark moralist, Budd Boetticher contoured images to strict need and built stories of an austere, didactic clarity, as in “7 Men from Now,” a tale of revenge that’s as much a matter of self-discipline and principle as of raw ferocity. Also, he achieved a rare, symbiotic collaboration with Randolph Scott, a great but recessive actor whose introverted grandeur flourished in the series of seven Westerns on which they collaborated.\n\n“7 Men from Now” (Google Play, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“The Tall T” (Plex, Prime Video, Tubi, and other services)\n\n*“The Killer Is Loose”\n\nFrank Borzage\n\nHollywood’s supreme romantic idealist cast a sacramental purity on sexual love—and on the entire realm of ordinary aspirations, for family and security, peace and freedom, that go with it. Frank Borzage’s graceful, rapturous black-and-white palette evokes the elusive dream of Heaven on Earth; his actors deliver snappy yet warmhearted performances; his spunky characters help themselves without waiting for God, nowhere more than in “Man’s Castle,” a Depression-era drama set mainly in a New York City shantytown where the unhoused house themselves. His 1925 silent “Lazybones” is a breathless love story done with folksy humor that views rural romance through the world-historical disruptions of the First World War and the devastating power of haunting secrets.\n\n*“Man’s Castle”\n\n“Moonrise” (Apple TV, Kanopy, and other services)\n\n“Lazybones” (Public Domain Movies)\n\n*“Living on Velvet”\n\nJohn Cassavetes\n\nOne of the most original of all directors was also one of the most paradoxical. John Cassavetes, who started as an actor, became an independent filmmaker at the same time that his Hollywood acting career was taking flight. He made a pair of excellent and idiosyncratic Hollywood features amid interference from meddlesome producers—and when he went into self-exile and became an independent again it was with a new, brassy forcefulness and a sense of expanded scope that borrowed from the big-budget-studio scene while repudiating it in the inventive freedom of his stories and images, in the might and the depth of the performances (foremost, by Gena Rowlands, his wife and close collaborator). Rather than walking away from the industry, where he continued to work as an actor, Cassavetes stood at its margins and beat it at its own game.\n\n“Faces” (Criterion Channel, HBO Max, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“Too Late Blues” (Kanopy, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“A Child Is Waiting” (ScreenPix and Hoopla)\n\nCharlie Chaplin\n\nThe Shakespeare of the cinema, Charlie Chaplin, raised in desperate poverty, maintained his fury at the arrogance of power throughout his life, and he made movies that, with theatrical extravagance, colossal humor, puckish ingenuity, and agonized tenderness, challenged and defied the world’s big-time bullies in his ribald mockery of Hitler, in his overt sympathy for Europe’s Jews amid their dire persecution, and in his impassioned view of an entire world menaced by tyrants—by the crude feelings that they expressed, aroused, and manipulated. Chaplin had a Hollywood studio of his own, and his mighty, insolent artistry had the intricacy, the precision, and the refinement of a Swiss watch.\n\n“The Great Dictator” (Criterion Channel, HBO Max, Kanopy, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“The Gold Rush” (Criterion Channel, Freevee, HBO Max, and other services)\n\n“A King in New York” (Criterion Channel and HBO Max)\n\nGeorge Cukor\n\nGeorge Cukor was Hollywood’s most responsive director of actors. He elicited performances that fused warmth, intensity, freedom, and the spotlit piquant detail, and developed an attentive, ardent style of image-making to match. In his remake of “A Star Is Born” (and of his own 1932 film “What Price Hollywood?”), he gave Judy Garland a showcase unlike any that she’d had, in large part because it mirrored her own experience as a star whose rise came at the price of great personal sacrifice. Throughout his career, Cukor emphasized the irresistible allure and devastating power of the media; an openly gay man in the Hollywood community, at a time when one could hardly be an openly gay person in public life at large, he also relentlessly filmed dramas of public figures and the abyss-like gap between their public images and their private lives.\n\n“A Star Is Born” (HBO Max, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“A Life of Her Own” (DAFilms, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“It Should Happen to You” (Apple TV, Prime Video,and other services)\n\n*“The Marrying Kind”\n\nStanley Donen\n\nThe only consistently great and original classic director of musicals, beside Berkeley, was Stanley Donen, who, unlike others in the field, did more than photograph singers and dancers in action. He choreographed for and with the camera, creating a sense of character and drama through movement that many dramatic directors could envy.\n\n“The Pajama Game” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and Tubi)\n\n“Royal Wedding” (Kanopy, Prime Video, Tubi, and other services)\n\n“Singin’ in the Rain” (HBO Max, Prime Video, and other services)\n\nAllan Dwan\n\nTrained as an electrical engineer, Allan Dwan was one of the technical and artistic pioneers of Hollywood, where he began his directorial career in 1911—at first, mostly in Westerns that he also wrote. Though he excelled in many genres throughout his career, he lent the Western a special lived-in sensibility; he conjured deep societies, offering rich and urbane cross-sections of the complexities of small-town life, with a wide range of intentions, desires, schemes, and moods to go with them. In “Silver Lode,” Dwan confronted the anti-Communist passions of the McCarthy era to show how a mob forms, to capture in images the ambient anxiety of persecution, and to locate the nodal points and fault lines of oppressive power.\n\n“Silver Lode” (Fandor, Prime Video, Tubi, and other services)\n\n“Driftwood” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and Spectrum)\n\n“The River’s Edge” (Criterion Channel)\n\n*“Black Sheep”\n\n*“Stage Struck”\n\n*“Manhandled”\n\nBlake Edwards\n\nAlong with the extensive discovery of directors’ artistry, thanks to French critics and such American ones as Andrew Sarris and Peter Bogdanovich, came other directors’ self-aware approach to the art of movies. The venerable inside-Hollywood genre was augmented by inside-Hollywood allusions: a cinema of references that treated drama much like a grab bag or a collage, and that opened movies up to the seeming essay-like discourse of filmmakers to viewers. One primordial filmmaker working in this vein was Blake Edwards, perhaps best known for his “Pink Panther” comedies. In the crime thriller “Experiment in Terror,” he created an explicit gloss on the films and the ideas of Alfred Hitchcock; it’s virtually a work of film criticism placed onscreen.\n\n“Experiment in Terror” (Prime Video, Vudu, and other services)\n\n“Wild Rovers” (Apple TV and Prime Video)\n\nJohn Ford\n\nThe Western is Hollywood’s political genre par excellence, John Ford is the studio era’s most tragically, insightfully political director, and “The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,” one of his final Westerns, explores the flaming core of American society—the outlaw violence and the shining lies on which the genteel surfaces of civil society and the formalities of political order are built. It’s a capacious, epoch-spanning drama that’s also a desperate love story, a look at the free press and its villainous enemies, and a jaundiced yet hopeful view of the petty connivances of practical politics. What’s all the more astounding is that these themes had all been at work, in many genres, throughout Ford’s career. Intimate relations, family connections, and medical crises all reverberate in his films with the energy of history, the weight of tradition, the power of law, the mystery of nature. His lifework has the enormous humanistic scope of living myths, and the political insight to challenge them with underlying realities each step of the way.\n\n“The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance” (Paramount+, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“The Quiet Man” (Paramount+, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“Sergeant Rutledge” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“The Wings of Eagles” (Google Play, HBO Max, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“Wagon Master” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“The Lost Patrol” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“Just Pals” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\nSamuel Fuller\n\nA former tabloid journalist and a combat veteran of the Second World War, Samuel Fuller was a pugnacious chronicler of crime and politics. He filmed violence with a flair so distinctive that he was mistaken for its fan. His view was rueful and virtually documentary, the product of trauma and the emblem of his hardy, fervent, and disappointed yearning for justice. In “Park Row,” Fuller filmed, with pride and passion, a nineteenth-century battle for the expansion of the free press, set in and titled for the downtown Manhattan street where many newspapers were then headquartered. “Shock Corridor” is a harrowing, mind-jangling drama about a journalist who feigns mental illness in order to do an inside story on a mental hospital and gets more than he asked for.\n\n*“Park Row”\n\n*“House of Bamboo” (Criterion Channel)\n\n“Shock Corridor” (Criterion Channel, HBO Max, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n*“Pickup on South Street” (FlixFling)\n\nBert I. Gordon\n\nThe low-budget science-fiction movies that I watched as a child on TV imbued me with a hectic strain of stark phantasmagoria; in adulthood, it has more than held up. The overlay of wild visions on spare, realistic situations is an enduring reproach to much modern-day fantasy elaborations. The crude vigor of the drama and the effects alike imprints the shock of monstrosities—and their metaphorical implications—directly onto the screen. As of this writing, Bert I. Gordon, whose work bears the marks of atomic-age terror and the shifting winds of pop culture, is ninety-nine; he made his last film to date in 2015.\n\n*“The Amazing Colossal Man”\n\n“War of the Colossal Beast” (Pluto, Tubi, and other services)\n\n“Earth vs. the Spider” (a.k.a. “The Spider”) (Pluto, Tubi, and other services)\n\nD. W. Griffith\n\nD. W. Griffith is the seminal figure of Hollywood, for good and bad reasons: with “The Birth of a Nation,” he synthesized the visual grammar of cinematic realism and launched the industry on a path of malicious lies and total bullshit. By the time I was conscious of the arts, I believed nothing I saw in Hollywood movies—which is why I long had no interest in them except as social activities. I think that the appalling success of Griffith’s film is the poison of distortion and falsehood—in the name of storytelling and crowd-pleasing—that the industry has yet to neutralize. And many who have, so to speak, taken the grammar straight have remained among the worst offenders. Nonetheless, Griffith soon went far beyond himself, in substance and in style, with dramas of romantic rapture and political history, such as “Way Down East,” “Sally of the Sawdust,” and “Isn’t Life Wonderful.”\n\n“Way Down East” (Kanopy, Prime Video, Tubi, and other services)\n\n“Sally of the Sawdust” (Internet Archive, Kanopy, and Public Domain Movies)\n\n*“Isn’t Life Wonderful”\n\n“Abraham Lincoln” (Kanopy, Pluto, Public Domain Movies, Tubi, and other services)\n\n“The Struggle” (Kanopy)\n\n“The Musketeers of Pig Alley” (Internet Archive, Kanopy, and Public Domain Movies)\n\n“The Painted Lady” (Internet Archive, Kanopy, and Public Domain Movies)\n\n”A Child of the Ghetto” (Internet Archive, and Public Domain Movies)\n\nHoward Hawks\n\nIf Freud hadn’t existed, Howard Hawks would have invented him. Indeed, he did reinvent him: as a character in “Bringing Up Baby” who delivers an insight about love that informed Hawks’s entire career. Hawks was Hollywood’s inside man, looking—whether with fascination, derision, respect, or awe—at the brave doings of warriors and detectives, the intriguing ones of heiresses and adventuresses, the quizzical ones of scientists, the forceful ones of businesspeople, the brutal ones of criminals, the troubled ones of just about everyone. Yet he considered the world of action with winks and asides and a deceptively reserved sense of style, conjuring energetic people’s ineffable inner tangles at a time when much was publicly unspeakable.\n\n“Bringing Up Baby” (Prime Video, Vudu, and other services)\n\n“Come and Get It” (Kanopy and Prime Video)\n\n“Scarface” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“Rio Bravo” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“Monkey Business” (Google Play, Prime Video, and other services)\n\nAlfred Hitchcock\n\nAlfred Hitchcock made a cinema of terror that suggests the work of a tormented soul who is burdened by guilt, wracked by lust, and fearful of the real-world consequences that are the basic spiritual cost of living. Though he said that his movies weren’t slices of life but slices of cake, I wouldn’t trust the ingredients of his most elaborate confections. The one that’s least sweetened and that sticks closest to the hardtack of documentary authenticity, “The Wrong Man”—based on a true story and filmed largely on location in Queens—is the most extreme and despairing of all, without being any less tangy, mysterious, or engrossing than his hyperbolic thrillers.\n\n“The Wrong Man” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“Marnie” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“Under Capricorn” (FilmBox and IndieFlix)\n\nBuster Keaton\n\nTime to confess: Buster Keaton impresses me mightily, but his films themselves aren’t as astounding as his exquisite and daring—I wouldn’t call them stunts, gags, or tricks, more like real-life magic. Still, there’s something special about his films, which, even if they aren’t comprehensive experiences in themselves, suggest deep mysteries behind the beleaguered innocent’s stoic mien.\n\n“The High Sign” (IndieFlix, Kanopy, and other services)\n\n“Steamboat Bill, Jr.” (Kanopy, Tubi, and other services )\n\n“Sherlock, Jr.” (Kanopy, Public Domain Movies, and other services)\n\nGregory La Cava\n\nGregory La Cava, who started as an animator, delivered a blend of drama and comedy that is ambiguous, unstable, volatile, and, at its best, disturbing and provocative. His standout compositions are as logical as they are expressive, as natural as they are canny—constructed as if drawn, heightening a punchline that may sting. In “Unfinished Business,” one of the great masterworks to be unavailable, those setups and those payoffs, as well as the cheery performances at the edge of tears, suggest the bitter poignancy and the social depth of novels by Dawn Powell, his contemporary. With “Stage Door,” La Cava dramatized a lively throng of actresses in a Manhattan boarding house and found the exuberant aspirations of youth perched on the edge of heartbreak and tragedy.\n\n*“Unfinished Business”\n\n“Primrose Path” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“Stage Door” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\nFritz Lang\n\nThe visual and decorative stylization that Fritz Lang achieved in his German films of the nineteen-twenties and early thirties—most famously in “Metropolis” and most extravagantly in “The Testament of Dr. Mabuse”—was out of his reach in the narrower norms of Hollywood. Instead, he stylized with visual restraint alongside emotional turmoil. What remained in his grasp was a critical view of society’s evils, and in “You Only Live Once,” a classic of the lovers-on-the-run genre and a crucial proto-film noir, Lang depicted police, prisons, and prejudice as essential sources of oppression and exclusion—basic rationales for desperate measures.\n\n“You Only Live Once” (Freevee, Tubi, and other services)\n\n“While the City Sleeps” (Criterion Channel, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n*“You and Me”\n\n“Fury” (Apple TV Prime Video, and other services)\n\nHarry Langdon\n\nThe mighty yet delicate originality of Harry Langdon as a silent-era comedy star is clear and strange in the handful of features he directed, especially “The Chaser,” in which he used long closeups of himself to slip past the theatrical proscenium and—making direct eye contact with the camera—reach out imploringly to the audience. His demand to bear witness to his plight, and also his antics, has a strange modernistic ambiguity that reaches ahead to the age of Andy Kaufman.\n\n*“The Chaser”\n\nJerry Lewis\n\nIn his first feature as a director, “The Bellboy,” from 1960, Jerry Lewis was, in effect, the noisiest of silent-comedy stars. There, playing the title character, he almost never speaks. In the rest of his directorial career, his famous squawk often got in the way of appreciating the grand-scale precision of his comedic conceits. Lewis was second only to Chaplin as an emblematic figure of the besieged common man—and, for Lewis, the essence of the frustrations and longings of daily life was found in childhood, to which, in most of his performances, he reverted, to antic effect. In “The Ladies Man,” Lewis plays Herbert H. Heebert, a ne’er-do-well who yearns to do good, and he invests the character with his own longings and furies; the ingenuous misadventures involve a colossal, doll-house-like set that rocks to Berkeley-esque rhythms, a musical fantasy of hallucinatory extravagance, and a riotous, satirical puncturing of television. Herbert’s sense of revolt is innocent, his whirlwind of chaos is involuntary, his need for love is overwhelming.\n\n“The Ladies Man” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“The Bellboy” (Kanopy, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“Cracking Up” (a.k.a. “Smorgasbord”) (Apple TV, Prime Video, and Vudu)\n\nErnst Lubitsch\n\nHawks’s prime precursor in erotic symbolism was the Berlin-born Ernst Lubitsch, who started his directorial career in Germany by 1914 and moved to Hollywood in 1922. But, where Hawks was Freud, Lubitsch was Mozart, transmuting desire into champagne and observing its head-turning effect with wonder, rue, and delight—depending on who and how and why. His direction has a classical grace and a perfect pitch of wit to match, and he also displays a righteous indignation similar to Chaplin’s, whether aimed at the pompous, the arrogant, or the downright monstrous, as in “To Be or Not to Be,” set in Occupied Poland, amid the anti-Nazi resistance (and romantic dalliances) of a theatre company. For Lubitsch, all politics are also sexual.\n\n“To Be or Not to Be” (Criterion Channel and HBO Max)\n\n“That Uncertain Feeling” (Public Domain Movies, Tubi, and other services)\n\n“So This Is Paris” (HBO Max)\n\nIda Lupino\n\nIn the postwar years, amid a major antitrust case that was decided in 1948, the studios opened their doors to independent producers, and one of the prime beneficiaries was the actress Ida Lupino, who formed a production company and, by 1949, also became the director Ida Lupino—the only female director then working in Hollywood. She instantly proved to be among the greats, with her first film, “Not Wanted,” the story of an unwed woman’s pregnancy, which blends documentary-like situations and hyperexpressive imagery to burrow deep into the protagonist’s inner life. Lupino founded the company (with her then husband, Collier Young) with the express purpose of addressing social questions. But, as it turned out, she did so with an involuntary force of style, bending and stretching the classical manner of studio realism to stay close to actors, much of it on location, and to press performances and situations for empathetic intensity in unbearable circumstances—nowhere more urgently and passionately than in “Outrage,” the drama of a young woman who is a victim of rape and then faces the shame and cruelty of her nearest and dearest.\n\n*“Outrage”\n\n“The Bigamist” (Kanopy, Paramount +, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“Not Wanted” (Kanopy, Kino Now, and Prime Video)\n\n“Never Fear” (a.k.a. “The Young Lovers”) (Criterion Channel, Kino Now, and other services)\n\n*“Hard, Fast and Beautiful”\n\nJoseph L. Mankiewicz\n\nAn Oscar-nominated screenwriter at twenty-two, and a major producer (of films by Lang, Arzner, and Borzage) by thirty, Joseph L. Mankiewicz turned to directing in his mid-thirties, in 1946, and quickly revealed an artistic originality that had hitherto been hiding in his industrial duties. He often also wrote his own films; his directing didn’t merely protect his scripts but provoked them, through bold and scathing performances, idiosyncratic effects, metaphysical twists, and an eclectic way with the camera that ranged from delicate tracery and darting energy to concentrated stillness and theatrical distance. In “A Letter to Three Wives,” he examines the private lives of suburban couples for fractures of class and culture, money and power, love and lust, with a blend of furious melodrama, raucous humor, and modernistic, screen-piercing, quasi-Bergmanesque disruption.\n\n“A Letter to Three Wives” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“The Barefoot Contessa” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“No Way Out” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“People Will Talk” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n*“Dragonwyck”\n\nAnthony Mann\n\nThe art of directing is often mistaken for what’s onscreen; rather, it’s a conjuring, an aura that bypasses visual style to create a psychological one. Anthony Mann’s films are centered on power, and he arranged lines of conflict so intense and palpable that they seem to be crisscrossing the screen physically. His Western “The Furies” has the feel of an Elizabethan tragedy, set against the colonial pressure of Anglos on the Mexican residents of New Mexico Territory, the generational tensions of young reformers against old autocrats, the legal and social dominance of men over women, the economic and social pressures of bureaucratic modernization, and the fierce love and fierce hate within families—and a rhetorical overheatedness to match.\n\n“The Furies” (Apple TV, Prim Video, and Spectrum)\n\n*“The Tall Target”\n\n“The Glenn Miller Story” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“The Great Flamarion” (Prime Video, Tubi, and other services)\n\nOscar Micheaux\n\nOscar Micheaux is a ringer in the list of directors: as a Black man, he had no access to the studios; instead, he founded a production company of his own and worked independently, starting in 1918. He made some forty features in the next twenty years. He depicted with plain and horrified candor the hatred and the violence that Black Americans faced, along with tensions within Black communities, including prejudice in favor of light-skinned people and demagogic manipulations by self-interested preachers. There’s an essential documentary element to his films, but he relied on far-rangingly speculative methods (such as flashbacks, dreams, and dramatic asides) to tell a story. The documentary element also reaches into the movie industry itself: at a time when Black performers had scant place in Hollywood, Micheaux featured extensive night-club and dance-hall scenes to spotlight musicians and dancers whose artistry trounced that of many of the white Hollywood heroes whom the studios made rich and famous.\n\n“The Symbol of the Unconquered” (Criterion Channel and Kanopy)\n\n“Within Our Gates” (Criterion Channel, MUBI, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“God’s Step Children” (Fandor, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“Birthright” (Criterion Channel)\n\nVincente Minnelli\n\nArtists contain multitudes, and paradoxes abound: Vincente Minnelli, one of the most exquisitely decorative and florid of Hollywood filmmakers, was also one of its most vehemently expressive melodramatists, one of its most creative comedy directors, one of its most refined directors of dance—and one of the studio era’s most analytical filmmakers. He had a career-long obsession with the workings of institutions; he was the prototype, in fiction filmmaking, of the documentarian Frederick Wiseman. He was also one of the cinema’s patron saints of neglected, overlooked, oppressed, and lost children, and one of the great romantics. With all that’s going on in his movies, in style and in substance, he channelled a sensibility that seems to burst from the screen; he’s among Hollywood’s most personal filmmakers.\n\n“The Clock” (Criterion Channel, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“Home from the Hill” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“Designing Woman” (Prime Video, Vudu, and other services)\n\n“Goodbye Charlie” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“The Long, Long Trailer” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“Two Weeks in Another Town” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and Vudu)\n\nF. W. Murnau\n\nThe German director F. W. Murnau had already transformed the art of movies with such films as “Nosferatu,” “The Last Laugh,” and “Faust” before getting to Hollywood, where his first film, “Sunrise,” from 1927, expanded both the poetic powers and the physical possibilities of the cinema. Its story of a forbidden love and a monstrous crime is a poignant, rapturous journey through the businesslike settings and the popular pleasure palaces of a modern city, and it pushed studio filmmaking to its very limits. For his 1930 film, “City Girl,” Murnau went out on location to a farm in Oregon, and for his final film, “Tabu,” he went further, to the South Seas, before his death at the age of forty-two, in 1931. In his brief life, he created scenes and styles, moments and methods, that have astonished many future filmmakers and nourished far more—whether they know it or not.\n\n“Sunrise” (Freevee, Vudu, and other services)\n\n*“City Girl”\n\nOtto Preminger\n\nDialectics in images: Otto Preminger, the son of Austria-Hungary’s chief prosecutor, was himself a law-school graduate who never practiced. Instead, he transferred the art of disputation, and of doubt, to the cinema and crafted a form to fit it. When Hollywood’s standard practice was to cut from character to character in dialogue scenes, Preminger kept the frame wide in order to confine the characters together in conflict and let them argue it out and let you, the members of the jury-audience, decide. Ambiguity, indeterminacy, incongruity are the hallmarks of Preminger’s art, as in the frantic, romantic melodrama “Daisy Kenyon,” where madness and love, obsession and indifference, converge with a disturbing, exciting impact.\n\n“Daisy Kenyon” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“Skidoo” (Roku and Plex)\n\n*“Angel Face”\n\n“Laura” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\nNicholas Ray\n\nVulnerable, hypersensitive, agonizingly aware of the pain that sparks rage and the pain that rage inflicts, Nicholas Ray would be among the most distinctive directors for his emotional world alone, for the fragile yet eruptive performances that he elicited. But his flayed and flaying sensibility was also a matter of his very matter, of composition and color, editing and dramatic choreography, a feel for setting and costume and weather. His images feel like the most spontaneous, the most improvised, the most jazzlike of all classic Hollywood; his Western “Johnny Guitar” plays like an anguished romantic melodrama unfolding behind the sets, as if it were continuous with his inside-Hollywood film noir “In a Lonely Place,” the single most painful love story I’ve ever seen issued from the studio system.\n\n“Johnny Guitar” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“In a Lonely Place” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n*“Bigger Than Life”\n\nJean Renoir\n\nWhat a strange story: fleeing France in 1940, after the Nazis invaded the country, Jean Renoir went to Hollywood and made a series of distinctive films (such as “The Southerner,” shot largely on location and acclaimed as a sort of American neorealism, and the metaphorically resonant film noir “The Woman on the Beach”). The Hollywood film that opened a new dimension in his art was “The Diary of a Chambermaid,” from 1946, set in nineteenth-century France in a rotting aristocratic setting akin to that of his masterwork, from 1939, “The Rules of the Game,” which, here, he revisited and revised. With the wild theatrics of Hollywood’s hectic thespians and the melodramatic moralism endemic to Hollywood itself, Renoir—without abandoning the effervescent lyricism and elbows-out comedy of his earlier work—alluded to the resentment and hatred that marked France’s wartime collaborationists. It was the kind of furiously denunciatory film that would have been tough to launch on home turf.\n\n“The Diary of a Chambermaid” (Roku)\n\nRobert Siodmak\n\nI’ve never seen Hollywood solitude as deep and frozen-solid as the kind that Robert Siodmak evoked. In the film noir “Phantom Lady,” he conjured it in the studio-made New York of his nightmares; in the morbidly melancholy film noir “Christmas Holiday” (written by Herman J. Mankiewicz, of “Citizen Kane”), he did it in a studio-simulated New Orleans; and in the crime drama “Criss Cross,” he found it on location in the streets of Los Angeles. In Hollywood, this German émigré filmmaker—who’d co-directed a remarkable silent, Berlin-based docufiction, the proto-mumblecore “People on Sunday,” in 1930—joined his documentary-like sense of scuffling city lives with the hyperexpressive distortions that also marked Weimar-era cinema.\n\n“Criss Cross” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“Phantom Lady” (Prime Video, Vudu, and other services )\n\n*“Christmas Holiday”\n\n*“The Whistle at Eaton Falls”\n\nDouglas Sirk\n\nAnother émigré from Germany, Douglas Sirk was philosophical and classical of temperament, and he flung himself eagerly, if critically, into the middle-class, middle-American way of life. He emerged as a melodramatist who would reinvent the genre. In his dramas, the harsh public morality and narrow constraints of domesticity (complete with spoiled, monstrous children) are countered by homespun American philosophers—be they overlooked outsiders, lonely thinkers and artists, or the despised and marginalized who bear hard-won wisdom. He pushed the tragic intensity of ordinary lives to the edge of absurdity—of comedy. The temptation to laugh is, at times, the mark and the power of his lofty art.\n\n*“All That Heaven Allows”\n\n“Imitation of Life” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n*“There’s Always Tomorrow”\n\n*“The Tarnished Angels”\n\n*“All I Desire”\n\n*“Week-End with Father”\n\n*“Interlude”\n\nJohn M. Stahl\n\nBefore Sirk, there was John M. Stahl—some of whose most celebrated works of the nineteen-thirties Sirk remade in the nineteen-fifties. The thirties were different: in the Depression, practical politics weren’t taboo, and Stahl plunged wholeheartedly and compassionately into the troubles of the times, putting the First World War, the stock-market crash, and the rise of feminism into “Only Yesterday” and labor conflicts into “When Tomorrow Comes.” He crafted a restrained, incisive style to fuse his characters’ romantic ardor with their oppressive circumstances, whether physical or abstract.\n\n*“Only Yesterday”\n\n*“When Tomorrow Comes”\n\nJosef von Sternberg\n\nThe collaboration (and romance) of Josef von Sternberg and Marlene Dietrich, which began in Germany with “The Blue Angel,” continued in Hollywood, in the nineteen-thirties, through six more films, in which von Sternberg did more than reveal himself to be the studios’ most original and elaborate stylist; he revealed style itself to be a matter of stringent morality, of courage under fire, of life and death. Did he exaggerate the power of style? If so, he did so gloriously, and deployed Dietrich’s pinpoint refinement to put the wild premise over, in film after film. Yet, even before their partnership, von Sternberg displayed the power of style in the tight-lipped, quietly riotous, technically ingenious early talking picture “Thunderbolt” and dramatized the fusion of personal bearing and cinematic achievement in the sardonic inside-Hollywood tale “The Last Command.”\n\n*“Dishonored”\n\n*“The Devil Is a Woman”\n\n*“Thunderbolt”\n\n*“The Last Command”\n\nErich von Stroheim\n\nThe duke of depravity, the baron of bile, the predatory prince—Erich von Stroheim turned the fleshpots of Europe into his American cinematic playground and took wicked glee from portraying the rigid-mannered, sleazily unctuous aristocrats, officers, royals, and impostors who presided over, preyed on, and profited from the wasteful glitter and the muck-filled alleys of autocracies. Yet von Stroheim also understood the allure of their vanity, the wicked thrill of their displays, because his directorial style embodied it. His images are as lavishly adorned as generals’ uniforms, as fulsomely textured as ballroom finery, as incisively angled as the gleaming strokes of swords. And when he filmed the United States, in “Greed,” it was without the finery, only the muck. It led to one of the great scandals in film history: the movie’s mutilation by its studio. What remains is nonetheless a masterwork of disgust.\n\n“Foolish Wives” (Kanopy, Kino Now, and other services)\n\n*“The Merry Widow”\n\n*“The Wedding March”\n\n“Greed” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\nFrank Tashlin\n\nA longtime director of “Looney Tunes,” Frank Tashlin brought the antic, anything-is-possible comedic sensibility of cartoons to live-action cinema and added his own up-to-the-minute alertness to the media-infused mind control of the American mass-cultural landscape. Advertising, rock music, the madness of fandom, and movies themselves—complete with frenetic parodies and cool-eyed allusions to films by Hitchcock and Hawks—inspired his ricocheting comedies and provided the settings for his characters’ cockeyed adventures and brazen desires.\n\n“Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?” (Apple TV, Prime Video, and other services)\n\n“The Alphabet Murders” (BritBox)"
