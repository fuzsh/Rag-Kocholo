Director King Vidor would always take the slightest excuse to champion the common man (or woman), and that he does with this slight little film. Country girl Dorothy Perkins (Florence Vidor, the director's wife) goes to the big city and lands young millionaire Monte Rhodes (Charles Meredith). Monte is quite fond of his family tree, so he is horrified when Dorothy's relatives, with their homespun ways, come to visit. When he gives his wife a hard time about being "common," she promptly leaves him and goes home, where she is warmly welcomed. While she is gone, Monte comes to appreciate her simple ways and asks her forgiveness.
