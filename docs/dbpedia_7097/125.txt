Operations began in 1994 with just one ship and was the brainstorm of the former Sitmar Cruise owners. They felt that the timing was just right in creating an all-suite luxury liner having fewer passengers then the trend cruising was been heading that bigger was better. Addressing the savvy traveller’s desire for some place new from Accra to Zanzibar was another priority.

This successful formula had Silversea Cruises expand and they now operate thirteen ships. Silversea Cruise’s motto “Every Wish Granted” is certainly applied. Their high crew to passenger ratio is 1:1 which delivers the most attentive service a passenger could ever experience.

Silversea offer authentic luxury. They recognise that luxury is something which is different to everyone and for some it can be as simple as a scent, a texture, an image or a taste that serves to stir the imagination.

For two decades now Silversea Cruises have continued to offer 6-star luxury cruise line service that is virtually unparalleled the world over. Their attentive and efficient service is complimented by a distinctive Italian style which is inherent in all that they do.

They strive to achieve perfection in order that their guests feel completely at ease. From the moment you step aboard your floating home for the duration of your holiday you will be greeted with a friendly and warm welcome and a chilled glass of champagne. Nothing, no matter how superfluous it may seem, will be overlooked on your cruise holiday.
