        "text": "AFTER years of being able to pick and choose among cruise ships, and usually on rather short notice, travelers this year are finding that they outnumber the available cabins. They are also finding that if they are luckyenough to get space on the ship of their choice, they are having to pay more— about 15 percent more on average‐than they did last season.\n\nAlmost every available ship is being called up for cruise duty, and some are even being stretched to provide extra space. The Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines’ Song of Norway was cut apart last year to accommodate a new 85‐foot midsection, giving her additional space for public rooms and cabins. The lengthened ship was so successful that the company plans a similar project on the Nordic Prince in March and is considering adding a brand new ship to its heavily booked fleet.\n\nIn a comment echoed by many other operators, William T. Kyle, senior vice president for Sitmar Cruises, said, “The cruise industry is experiencing the heaviest demand for accommodations in its history.”\n\nThe reason is not hard to find. Today's cruise ship is a floating resort where the whole family may sun, swim, jog, work out in a gym, take a sauna and massage, go to the movies, practice golf, play tennis or shuffleboard, read, take lessons in photography, play bridge and attend lectures on various subjects, some for college credit. Passengers may dine at least four times a day (on some ships in a smoking or nonsmoking area) and on food comparable to that in some of the world's best restaurants. After dinner there are dances to live music, entertainment programs and socializing before a midnight buffet or a pause to gaze at the stars. And for children there are activities supervised by trained counselors, at sea and in port. On a cruise the pleasure is as much in getting to a destination as the destination itself no daily packing and unpacking, no fighting traffic, no looking for a place to stay each night.\n\nMoreover, at an average cost of $120 a day, today's cruises, despite their rising costs, are competitive with many other kinds of vacations. Price increases may even be avoided by booking cruises that depart before new fares go into effect. Fares for 11‐night trips on Costa Cruises’ World Renaissance, for example, will increase on Nov. to a range of $995 to $1,765 from a range of $955 to $1,415 (the fare for one person in double occupancy), and seven‐night trips on Sitmar Cruises’ Fairsea will rise in January from a present range of $485 to $1,205 to from $660 to $1,390.\n\nIn most cases, the fare increases are caused by higher operating costs, primarily fuel, but instead of merely raising prices the shipping lines are also working to reduce expenses. One way is to trim the number of ports of call, thus shortening sailing distances for a voyage of the same duration — in effect, following the principle of offering a candy bar that looks about the same size but weighs an ounce or two less.\n\nOne example of this is the change that will take place on Dec. 22 in the itinerary of seven‐night cruises of the Festivale of Carnival Cruise Lines. At present the Festivale calls at three ports in the Caribbean: St. Martin, St. Thomas and San Juan. After Dec. 22, San Juan will be dropped from the itinerary.\n\nIn a variation on the smaller‐candy‐bar principle, the Mardi Gras, also operated by Carnival Cruise Lines, will substitute a call at Nassau for Santo Domingo on her seven‐night cruises, also as of Dec. 22. While keeping three ports of call, the change will reduce sailing distance. Taken together, the two changes should result in a 20‐percent saving in fuel, according to an official of Carnival.\n\nThe shipping lines are also endeavoring to keep inflation in line by offering package arrangements with airlines to reduce fares for passengers flying to various cruise ports, especially Galveston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, San Juan, Acapulco and Singapore.\n\nHolland America Cruises, for example, offers free air fare from the West Coast for its Orient/Alaska trans‐Pacific cruises aboard the Prinsendam between Singapore and Vancouver. Sitmar includes free air fare for some of its cruises between Los Angeles and the Caribbean, and there are fly‐free options offered by Cunard, Paquet and Home Lines, among others. Such programs make a cruise vacation more accessible and affordable to people from all over the country to all over the world.\n\nThere was a time not long ago when trans‐Atlantic liners, looking forlorn and empty, were laid up along the Hudson River. Some of these great ladies of the sea were sold for salvage, sunk to provide the climax for a motion picture or, more ignoble, used to haul cattle. Which brings to mind a poem by Mary W. Nation: “My teeth are gone, my face has shrunk. I'm a worn‐out ship that should be sunk, but ... store‐bought teeth and powder and paint, will make folks think I'm what I ain't.”\n\nRefurbished, repainted, refitted for cruising and bearing different names, some of the old and not‐so‐old ladies are once again sailing the seven seas: the Argentina as the Veendam for Holland America, the Monterey and the Lurline as the Britanis and the Ellinis for Chandris and the Gripsholm as the Navarino for Karageorgis Cruises, to name a few.\n\nOf course, more than powder and paint has gone into the transformation of these rebuilt ships. The Veendam, for example, has an entirely new promenade deck, now called the Lido Deck, with new public rooms, a buffet for breakfast and informal lunch, a new pool area and additional cabins.\n\nThe Britanis underwent a modernization that changed her from a two‐class vessel to a single‐class cruise ship, and many of her cabins were altered, private showers were added, her capacity was increased and her public rooms redesigned.\n\nAnd on the Navarino, among other features, there is now a satellite telephone hookup, a growing innovation among cruise ships.\n\nTwo of the most famous trans‐Atlantic liners are due to return to service next year, one the longest afloat, the other the fastest. The France has been purchased by Norwegian Caribbean Lines and is undergoing a $40 million refit to convert her from an enclosed trans‐Atlantic liner to a wide‐open Caribbean cruise ship. Scheduled to provide yearround, seven‐day cruises from Florida to the Caribbean, the France is to be renamed the Norway. At 1,035 feet the world's longest cruise vessel, she will begin sailing out of Miami June 1.\n\nThe Norway is to have indoor and outdoor swimming pools, a theater and cinema, closed‐circuit television for viewing films in one's stateroom, a discotheque, a gaming area, library, meeting rooms, twin restaurants, saunas, gymnasium, racquet‐ball and squash courts, a hospital and dental facility and the longest promenade deck of any ship, a deck that will become an air‐conditioned street of shops, cafes and lounges.\n\nThe other liner, the United States, on her maiden voyage in 1952 captured and still holds the passenger liner speed record in both directions across the Atlantic. Purchased by United States Cruises, she is to be modernized and refitted at a cost of $30 million. Her maiden voyage after refurbishing — but still with her original name — will be a world cruise, scheduled for late next year.\n\nThe liner will have more than 600 staterooms with up to 50 percent more living space than most other cruise ships, three outdoor swim ming pools, one indoor pool, sports facilities including weight room and health spa and a full‐size tennis court (probably the only one afloat), 19 public rooms, five restaurants (each with its own cuisine), a formal dining room, a ballroom and a discotheque, two theaters, a snopping arcaae, a hospital, a bookstore, a barber and beauty shop, closed‐circuit television and a no‐tipping policy.\n\nAn innovative plan to sell memberships in the United States Cruising Society, ranging in price from $11,500 to $39,500, will enable purchasers to sail aboard the United States for 14 days each year for 20 years somewhat like reserving a box at the opera.\n\nAs for destinations, one of the newest for cruise passengers is Key West, Fla. The city's new port, recently acquired from the Navy, will welcome its first ship, Bahama Cruise Line's Veracruz, on Oct. 26. The Veracruz will call again on Dec. 2, followed by Royal Cruise Line's Golden Odyssey, which has scheduled six calls, starting Jan. 7. Key West has announced plans to develop the Navy base as a recreation area and a cruise ship terminal, one that will be 150 miles closer to the Caribbean than Miami.\n\nWhat follows is an expanded directory of cruise ship sailings, given this time by destination rather than by port of departure and covering not only sailings from North America, as in the past, but also from other popular cruise areas, such as the Mediterranean. The directory covers the next 12 months, also an innovation, in some instances running into October 1980 instead of ending with the winter and spring seasons.\n\nThe information was supplied by the shipping companies, but dates, ports of call and fares remain subject to change. Unless otherwise noted, the fares quoted are for one person in double occupancy and range from the lowest‐price accommodations to the most expensive. Discounts are sometimes available to groups and to a third or fourth person in a stateroom. Reduced children's rates are also usually available. Fares do not include port taxes, optional shore excursions, tips or items of a personal nature.\n\nAdditional information may be obtained from travel agents or the shipping companies; addresses and phone numbers are provided in the box on this page.\n\nApril 19 to July 26 — Sevennight cruises departing every Saturday from New York, calling at Nassau.
