        "text": "Crystal Cruises will be building two new ships, a sign of the strong recovery of the luxury line.\n\nJust two years ago, the line was bankrupt and discontinued, but the future is now looking stronger than ever.\n\nThe cruise line announced that it has signed a contract with renowned Italian shipyard Fincantieri for two new cruise ships. The ships will play host to 690 passengers and weigh in at 61,800 gross tons.\n\nThe first ship will arrive in 2028, with the delivery date of the second ship yet to be announced. It was also revealed that there is an option for a third ship to be built.\n\nFollowing the bankruptcy of its previous owners Genting Hong Kong, Crystal Cruises was out of service for 20 months but relaunched under new owners, Abercrombie & Kent Travel Group in 2022.\n\nManfredi Lefebvre d’Ovidio, Executive Chairman of A&K Travel Group said: “This order is another milestone in the 40 years of productive collaboration between Fincantieri and my family that started with Sitmar Cruises, continued with Silversea and now is flourishing again with Crystal.\n\n“Our aim is to continue setting a new standard in cruising, offering our guests an unmatched level of service and sophistication. These new ships will receive the same level of attention I reserve for my own house.”\n\nWhat we know so far\n\nThe ships will feature the only Nobu at sea, bringing the popular fine-dining restaurant to the water for the first time.\n\nThere will be a promenade extending throughout the ships perimeter, promised to be a stand-out feature\n\nThe new ships will have all-suite accommodation, including options for solo travellers\n\nWellness and relaxation are pledged to be at the core of the ship’s design, with a comprehensive spa and fitness centre"
