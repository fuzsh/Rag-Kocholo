        "text": "Thanks Nick Abrahim -It's fantastic to see how the cruise industry positively impacts our local communities, including the taxi sector. Taxis play a crucial role in ensuring smooth and convenient travel experiences for cruise passengers, connecting them from the ship to our vibrant cities and beyond. This collaboration is a perfect example of how different sectors can work together to create a seamless journey for travelers, benefiting both the local economy and the tourism industry as a whole. Let's continue to support and celebrate these partnerships that contribute to the success of our industry! #WeAreCruise\n\nAnd that‚Äôs a wrap on our first ever River Cruise Showcase! üö¢‚ú® A huge thank you to our incredible panelists for your insights and expertise, and to everyone who joined us.

See you all at Cruise360! #WeAreCruise Alice Ager Robert Kalemba Birgit Eisbrenner Scott Ellis Steve Richards Steven Taylor Brett Simon David Clark\n\nWriting in today's Cruise Weekly, Hon. Zoe Bettison MP, South Australia‚Äôs Tourism Minister highlights the SA Government‚Äôs proactive approach to working with the cruise industry. Their commitment to ensuring that South Australia remains an appealing and competitive cruise destination, delivering a high level of service to visiting cruise lines and their passengers, is commendable. The upcoming Australian Cruise Association annual conference in Adelaide will be a great opportunity to showcase this focus.

At CLIA, we're proud to support our trade partners in their journey by providing specialist cruise training to their travel consultants. This commitment to expertise and continuous learning is key to driving higher-margin sales and delivering exceptional service to cruise enthusiasts. In fact, it‚Äôs this dedication to professional development that has led to CLIA in Australasia being named a finalist for the third consecutive year in the National Tourism Industry Awards (NTIAs) 'Most Outstanding Travel Industry Training Institution' category. Having won this award in 2022, we‚Äôre honored to have further recognition for our ongoing efforts to elevate industry standards. We look forward to further strengthening our trade partnerships and helping more travel consultants harness the opportunities in this thriving market. https://lnkd.in/gnUtsNzN James Kavanagh Andrew Stark\n\nHonoured to be invited to share welcome remarks to the 12th China International Cruise Summit (Qingdao). This important event, hosted by the Committee of Cruise Industry of the World Tourism Cities Federation (CCIWTCF) along with key local partners, continues to serve as a valuable platform for discussions on the future of China‚Äôs cruise tourism and broader collaboration across Asia. I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to the dialogue on the revitalization and sustainable development of the cruise industry in this region. #WeAreCruise\n\nThank you, Andrea Black for shining a light on the steps CLIA cruise lines are taking on their journey to net zero.

Luxury cruising represents the pinnacle of travel experiences. Whether exploring hidden gems or indulging in world-class service, luxury cruises elevate travel to an art form. What a incredible way to invite media and influencers into the world of luxury cruising and show off luxury‚Äôs best kept secret! #wearecruise\n\nCLIA is incredibly proud to be named a finalist for the third consecutive year in the NTIAs 'Most Outstanding Travel Industry Training Institution' category. Having won this award in 2022, we're thrilled to have further recognition for our Professional Development program. As we always say, CLIA travel agents are the most knowledgeable and professional cruise specialists around, and we‚Äôre grateful for the energy you put into our training opportunities. üèÜ #WeAreCruise\n\nCLIA in Australasia proudly sponsored and participated in the New Zealand Cruise Association Conference in Auckland this week. It was an opportunity for CLIA to highlight the strong global outlook and share exciting sentiment statistics specific to New Zealand. Among Kiwis who have cruised before, 81% plan to cruise again, with even higher enthusiasm among younger generations‚Äî86% of Millennial cruisers and 87% of Gen Z cruisers intend to return to the seas. Additionally, 74% of New Zealanders who have never cruised are open to trying it, a sentiment that outpaces international averages. However, New Zealand faces challenges with high costs and regulatory issues that need to be addressed. By coming together‚Äîgovernment, ports, destinations, and communities alike‚Äîwe can send a clear signal that New Zealand is open for business. If we unite, we can overcome these challenges and fully share in the global growth that cruising offers. Congratulations to Jacqui and the NZCA board for a successful conference and for kicking off the cruise conference season down under. #wearecruise Debbie Summers Tansy Tompkins\n\nCLIA Australasia Chair, Peter Little joined CLIA Cruise Line execs, Dave Humphreys, Lisa Teiotu, and Adam Radwanski, as well as ACA‚Äôs Jill Abel, on a panel at the recent Travel24 event in Sydney, to discuss what‚Äôs ahead for cruising over the next 24 months. In addition to highlighting the exciting opportunities ahead for cruising globally and in our region, Travel24 was also an opportunity to focus on some of the challenges facing our sector, and reinforce that cruise operations are often planned and booked several years in advance, and therefore it is critical that government work closely with industry to create an environment that delivers long-term regulatory certainty for cruising in this region. In our region, the cruise industry is worth more than $5.6 billion a year to communities around the coast, and cruise ships made almost 1,400 port calls around Australia in 2022-23, creating an economic impact that supports more than 18,000 Australian jobs. #wearecruise"
