        "text": "Never before in cruise history has there been such discounting as this year. The reason is that many operators of passenger liners are suffering badly because of miscalculations made toward the end of the 1970's. As a result, a huge assortment of bargains is available to coax people aboard.\n\nThey take these principal forms:\n\n* Widely advertised price reductions by cruise companies for certain sailings or even for a liner's entire season. Sometimes they are offered only to travelers who book far in advance, but sometimes they crop up at almost the last minute.\n\nAdvertised reductions sometimes 50 to 75 percent off - for the third or fourth person in a cabin. Before you hurry to sign up, however, ponder whether you will really feel comfortable four to a cabin, even if the four are you, your wife and your children; on the other hand, perhaps you plan to spend so much time on deck that it will not make much difference. Be aware, though, that public rooms and decks are likely to be overrun by children on such cruises, which may not be quite what you want if yours are not along.\n\n* Reduced-rate or supposedly free air transportation from home to where you board the ship and back home again when the cruise is over. Such incentives warrant close examination, however, because sometimes they prove neither free nor as inexpensive as they initially seem, and they may not be by the most direct route.\n\n* Substantial bargains - perhaps 30 percent or more - if you book through a travel agency that has quietly been offered special rates by a cruise line in return for a promise, without advertising the company's name, to produce a sizable group of passengers.\n\n* Deeply discounted offerings by clubs or travel agencies that specialize in ''stress merchandise'' - space on hard-to-sell cruises and charter flights. But to gain access to the telephone hot lines on which such offerings are typically promoted, you usually must pay dues ranging from $35 to $50 a year. Also, you may not get the sort of accommodations you prefer or much guidance on whether an available cruise will suit your taste.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
