Fredrik Christian Olsen bought his first two sailing ships, the schooners \"Johanne Christine\" and \"Elizabeth\" in 1848. He died in 1875 having owned 22 sailing ships. Petter Olsen's ship owning career began in 1852 with the brig \"Thilda\". In his lifetime he owned a total of 16 sailing ships, besides part interests in several steamships. Andreas Olsen bought the barque \"De Tre Venner\" in 1860 and subsequently owned five other sailing ships.\n\nPetter Olsen's son Fredrik was thus continuing an established tradition when, in 1886, he took over the management of two of his fathers ship's.

Phoenix Reisen Amadea Phoenix Reisen is a Germany-based travel agency that also operates a fleet of cruise ships. The company first entered the cruise business in 1988 by chartering the Soviet Union-owned cruise ship SS Maxim Gorkiy.\n\nPhoenix Reisen first begun operating cruises under its own brand in 1988 when the company chartered the West German-built cruise ship SS Maxim Gorkiy from the Soviet Union-based Black Sea Shipping Company on a 20-year charter agreement. In 1993 a second ship joined the Phoenix Reisen fleet, when SS Albatros was chartered from V-Ships. Unlike the Maxim Gorkiy, which retained the colours of her owners in Phoenix service, the Albatros was painted in Phoenix Reisen’s own colours with a turquoise funnel displaying the company logo Artania\n\nP&O Cruises Aurora The owner of a rich and illustrious history P&O Cruises has always been synonymous with cruising holidays of the highest quality.\n\nIt is said that P&O \"invented\" cruising. In the 1880s the Orient Line and the North of Scotland company, both later to be taken over by P&O, pioneered modern-style cruises, and in 1904 P&O offered its first cruise holiday programme, a first class only cruise with shore excursions arranged by Thomas Cook. The tour used the 23-year-old liner Rome, renaming her Vectis in her new role as a \"cruising yacht.\" Between the wars cruising became more popular, often using the newest ships in the fleet rather than the oldest. Tourist class cruises began in the early 1930s followed by Pacific cruises from Australia a few years later. With no rigid mail contracts after 1945, cruising became still more important to the shipping industry. P&O Cruises last ship built for scheduled line voyages, Canberra, was delivered in 1961 but in little more than a decade jet airlines had taken over the company's traditional passenger trades while the container ship packed up liner cargoes. Forced to concentrate on the leisure side of sea travel, P&O Cruises abolished passenger classes, acquired Los Angeles-based Princess Cruises in 1974, and Sitmar Cruises in 1988. P&O Princess Cruises de-merged from the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company on 23 October 2000, when it started trading as an independent company on the London and New York Stock Exchanges. P&O cruises as part of its south East Asia cruise stops in Laem Chabang near Bangkok Thailand where there are many options for shore excursions.\n\nPrincess Cruises Diamond Princess One of the best-known names in cruising, Princess Cruises first set sail in 1965 with a single ship cruising to Mexico. Today, the line has grown to become the third largest cruise line in the world, renowned for innovative ships, an array of onboard options, and an environment of exceptional customer service. A recognized leader in worldwide cruising, Princess offers approximately 1.3 million passengers each year the opportunity to escape to the top destinations around the globe, aboard a fleet of 16 modern vessels.\n\nPrincess Cruises was catapulted to stardom in 1977 when one of its ships, Pacific Princess, was cast in a starring role on a new television show called “The Love Boat.” The weekly series, which introduced millions of viewers to the concept of a sea-going vacation, was an instant hit and both the company name and its “seawitch” logo have remained synonymous with cruising ever since. The show, which can still be seen around the world, has been widely credited with fueling the dramatic expansion of the industry. Princess cruises has a number of itineraries arriving in Thailand including docking at Laem Chabang Port near Bangkok. From Laem Chabang port you can enjoy many options for private shore excursions day tours. Dawn Princess\n\nOcean Princess Pacific Princess\n\nSun Princess Regent SevenSeas Cruises Seven Seas Voyager Experience luxury cruising in an intimate, unique and personal way, indulging mind and body in the indelible luxury that is the hallmark of Regent Seven Seas, with complimentary beverages including select wines and spirits served throughout the ship; complimentary 24-hour room service menu; complimentary in-suite dining including selections from the main dining room during dinner hours and in-suite refrigerator replenished daily with soft drinks, beer and bottled water.

Seabourn Pride Seabourn Quest Silversea Cruises Silver Shadow\n\nSilversea is a cruise company reflecting generations of maritime and travel experience. In the early 1990s, the Lefebvre family of Rome, former owners of Sitmar Cruises, conceived and organized a unique cruise company pledging to build and operate the highest quality ships in the ultra-luxury segment. The name Silversea was chosen because it connotes quality and luxury as well as capturing the romance and special sensations of the sea. Silversea launched its first ship, Silver Cloud in 1994, followed by Silver Wind in 1995, Silver Shadow in 2000 and Silver Whisper in 2001 and Silver Spirit in December 2009. In addition, a purpose-built expedition vessel, Silver Explorer, was acquired in 2008 (and was initially named Prince Albert II). The fleet was purpose-built for the ultra-luxury market, establishing a new class of smaller, intimate vessels that could slip into more exotic ports off the beaten path such as Klong Toey in the heart of Bangkok Thailand. These elite vessels were specifically designed for fewer guests, more space and the highest levels of personalized service, delivered by Italian officers and European staff. All-ocean view suites, most with private veranda, and open seating dining options so guests dine when, where and with whom they desire, add to the very special ambiance created on board. But what is also unique is that they incorporate the favorite amenities found on larger ships, such as an elaborate show lounge featuring nightly entertainment, casino, spa and state-of-the-art fitness facility. Silver Whisper Swan Hellenic Cruises MV Minerva A cruise with Swan Hellenic is the ultimate in well-planned and meticulously executed discovery cruising.
