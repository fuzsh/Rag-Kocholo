        "text": "Crystal announced the signing of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri for two new luxury cruise ships in late June.\n\nThe 690-passenger, 61,800gt ships will feature a host of amenities and innovative designs, the company said, ensuring ‘unparalleled comfort and indulgence for guests’. The delivery date for the first ship is spring 2028.\n\nA delivery date for a second ship will be named later, the company said. There is also an option for a third vessel for delivery in 2032.\n\n“This order is another milestone in the 40 years of productive collaboration between Fincantieri and my family that started with Sitmar Cruises, continued with Silversea and now is flourishing again with Crystal,” said Manfredi Lefebvre d’Ovidio, Executive Chairman of A&K Travel Group.\n\n“Our aim is to continue setting a new standard in cruising, offering our guests an unmatched level of service and sophistication. These new ships will receive the same level of attention I have reserve to my own house,” added Cristina Levis, CEO of A&K Travel Group.\n\n“This order not only highlights the robust recovery of the cruise sector, in line with our Industrial Plan, but also reaffirms Fincantieri’s leadership, thanks to the operational excellence of our shipyards and the execution quality of our world-class supply chain,” stated Pierroberto Folgiero, CEO of Fincantieri.\n\nArchitectural firms Studio Ibsen led by Prof and Architect Adriana Granato and Studio Gem headed by Naval Arch. Giacomo Mortola and Naval Eng. Lorenzo Mortola will be leading the design efforts, along with a third international design firm yet to be appointed. According to Crystal, a standout feature will be a promenade extending through the whole ships’ perimeter, similar to those loved by guests on Crystal Symphony and Crystal Serenity."
