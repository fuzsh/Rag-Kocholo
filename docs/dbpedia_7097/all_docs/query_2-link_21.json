        "text": "I would like to know who was the Captain of the Fairwind in July of 1985? I'm hoping the answer is Giuseppe Romano.\n\nI don't know who was the Captain in 7/85 but I can tell you that our Sitmar Cruises Fairwind Passenger List for the 8/24/85 11-day Caribbean sailing indicates the Master of the Ship was Captain Nicola Di Stefano. Mark Edwards was the Cruise Director, Dan Neipris the Asst. Cruise Director and the Hostess was Janet Edwards.\n\nMy experience is that many believe that the trend towards family cruising is a recent phenomenon led by Carnival and others, but it is interesting to note that the TSS Fairwind had an extensive staff for children. (Especially for a ship that is small by today's standards.) They had a Youth Activities Coordinator (Sandy Davis); Teen Director (Brett Kelly); Teen Sports Director (Anne Hayes); Teen Theatre Director (John Caisse); Teen Activities Director (Nancy Leonard); and 8 Youth Counselors (Rosalyn Myers, Judy Fritz, Barbara Shock, Samantha Brees, Thea Stein, Elaine Husni, Ruth Thompsen, and Cheryl Feldman).\n\nPersonally, I would like to know any information about the following ships:\n\nXanadu - which sailed 7-day itineraries along the Inside passage to Alaska roundtrip from Vancouver in the summer of '71\n\nSanta Magdalena and other Prudential Line ships (The Santa Maria was another one) - my recollection is that these ships made stops in several North American ports (Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles) before going down the coast of Mexico and Central America through the Panama Canal and counter-clockwise around South America in the summer of '75. They were cargo ships carrying produce to/from the Western US to Central and South America and had approximately 100 passengers. (I sailed 45-days with my parents from Panama City around the South American continent back up to Ecuador but want to verify the ship name. The onboard celebrities included noted Hall of Fame sportscaster Red Barber and an American bridge instructor named Zita who lived in Lima, Peru!)\n\nPersonally, I would like to know any information about the following ships:\n\nXanadu - which sailed 7-day itineraries along the Inside passage to Alaska roundtrip from Vancouver in the summer of '71\n\nShe is now laid-up in California. A few months ago it was reported that a Saudi doctor living in the UK had bought her as a private yacht.\n\nAn extensive article on this fascinating little vessel, with a complete tour of her in her present condition, can be seen here.\n\nSanta Magdalena and other Prudential Line ships (The Santa Maria was another one)\n\nI beleive you are thinking of the \"Four M's\", SANTA MAGDALENA, SANTA MARIA, SANTA MARIANA and SANTA MERCEDES. These vessels were built in 1963-1964 for Grace Line, which merged in 1970 with Prudential Line to become Prudential-Grace Line, then just Prudential Line in 1974. In 1978 the company was sold to Delta Line who maintained the ships on their original services.\n\nIn 1984, Delta Line closed their passenger services. SANTA MERCEDES was sold to the US Maritime Administration and became the Massachusetts Maritime Academy's training ship, PATRIOT STATE. She has since been retired and is now laid up in the James River in Virginia awaiting her fate (probably scrapping).\n\nThe remaining three ships did not find new owners and were laid-up. In 1988 they were broken up in Taiwan.\n\nI just want to say that I have so enjoyed reading this thread. It's chock full of history, nostaglia and information and I thank everyone who has contributed facts and memories. I have just taken a cruise on Celebrity Zenith with my husband and five year old son. It is only my second cruise and I enjoyed it immensely. That said...my first cruise was on the Home Lines Doric in 1981 where I got such wonderful service I married my Italian waiter! ;) :D\n\nI was in my early twenties on that cruise but I was still able to appreciate the warm, friendly, and elegant service we received. I was pretty seasick on the way to Bermuda but was well taken care of by the infirmary and \"my\" waiter who brought me ginger ale and crackers. It turned out to be a fun and memorable cruise. I am only sorry that I never took another Home Lines Cruise and that I didn't sail on the Oceanic. My only excuse was that we spent all of our subsequent vacations in Italy visiting family.\n\nMy parents sailed on the Raffaello and still rave about the service and the ambiance of the ship. They took other cruises after that but nothing ever compared to the Raffaello in their eyes.\n\nThe reason I chose Celebrity was, I think, that I was trying to find an experience that would come close to what I enjoyed on Home Lines. I don't want \"freestyle\", I don't want casual (i.e. flip flops in the dining room), I don't want Las Vegas decor. I DO want individual, personal service, great food, formal nights, nice but low-key decor and a comforatable cabin (I don't even need a balcony). I want to feel like I'm on a cruise ship not in a mega, impersonal, mass market resort hotel. If that what I wanted I could go to any number of places on land. I want to feel that this is a special experience on a ship :) .\n\nI feel that the Zenith provided me with everything I wanted. I liked the fact that she was not too big. The service was outstanding. The food was very good. The crew was friendly and the passengers were the right mix. While their kids room was not very large or elaborate, it was fine for my five year old who can't wait to go back again. I sometimes think that too much for kids is not always the answer. They need to unwind too and learn to adapt to simpler things (like living without video games and computers for a week).\n\nAnyway...just some of my thoughts. You have all made me very nostalgic and sorry I missed so much of the \"old\" days of cruising. I only hope that there will be some cruise lines left that do not go totally casual mass market.\n\nHere's another article (also rather lengthy) from Cruise Travel magazine. Loaded with several photos of the Fair Princess's last Canal transit.\n\nA side highlight is that it has a nice photo of Janet Edwards, the first female CD. (She was the CD on a 10 day Mex Riviera cruise we sailed and had an interesting challenge. We sailed out of LA on January 14, 1991. On January 16 1991 President George H W Bush launched Operation Desert Storm in Iraq. The passengers were very anxious to stay curent, a difficult job because the Fair Princess had no stateroom TV's. She set up several TV's in the public lounge along with as many chairs as she could corral. She also arranged with the ship's chaplain to call for a minute of silence and reflection at 11:00 pm, the announced beginning of the operation. Imagine doing this as the second show was underway for the second seating. She was a real trooper and gained a lot of fans that night.)\n\nTo add to the \"fun\" we were buzzed twice by air force fighters fly-overs the next day while we were enjoying a day at sea as we headed for Cabo San Lucas.\n\nHere's a link to the article:\n\nIntroducing the Fair Princess\n\nEdited March 19, 2017 by Host Walt"
