        "text": "Silversea have surprised the cruising world by announcing that their brand new flagship, the Silver Muse, will be christened in the Spring of 2017. This will be Silversea’s first new ship since 2009!\n\nBuilt by one of the most famous and experienced shipyards in the world, Fincantieri, the Silver Muse will weigh in at 40,000 gross registered tonnes, will accommodate just 596 guests and is promising to impress even seasoned Silversea passengers.\n\nThe Silver Muse will be an evolution of the Silver Spirit, which already gained huge praise for being one of the very best ways to experience ultra-luxury ocean travel.\n\nSilversea emphasises that the Silver Muse will raise the bar in ultra-luxury travel while still providing passengers with the familiar, intimate and comfortable atmosphere Silversea are known for.\n\n“We have always had a special relationship with Fincantieri, since my father ordered from them the first cruise vessels for Sitmar Cruises in 1987,” said Manfredi Lefebvre d’Ovidio, chairman of Silversea. “Both companies have a clear understanding of what today’s affluent traveller seeks, and each approaches the market with originality, creativity, and quality. The management team led by Giuseppe Bono has been exceptional in managing Silversea’s project.”\n\nEnxo Visone, Silversea’s CEO, also had exciting thoughts to share on the Silver Muse; “With enhanced design specifications and enriched content, the Silver Muse will continue to build on the sophistication, innovative style and ground–breaking concepts for which Silversea ships are renowned. This ship contributes to our ambitious growth plans that will ensure our continued leadership in ultra-luxury cruising.”\n\n// END - About the Author ?>"
