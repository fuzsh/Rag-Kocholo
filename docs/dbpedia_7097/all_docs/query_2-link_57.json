        "text": "The Star Princess will debut in August 2025 and sail an inaugural season of Mediterranean voyages. It is the second Sphere class ship and is the sister ship to the Sun Princess.\n\nCurrently under construction at the Fincantieri shipyard in Italy, Star Princess joins Sun Princess as the largest ships ever built for Princess at 175,500 tonnes and carrying 4,300 guests. The new ship is built on a platform that is distinctly different and unique to Princess, designed to simultaneously embrace the Princess heritage while celebrating the romance of the sea by offering more dynamic, outward views.\n\nWhile 20 per cent larger than any of the line’s existing ships, Star Princess design retains the more intimate settings Princess is known for, with several new and incredibly ground-breaking spaces such as:\n\n• The Dome, a transformational entertainment venue inspired by the terraces of Santorini.\n\n• The next-level Piazza featuring a glass sphere\n\n• Princess Arena, a configurable, technologically advanced main theatre that allows Princess to produce a variety of innovative entertainment concepts; and\n\n• A dining room positioned aft of the ship to deliver unforgettable wake views.\n\nThis second Sphere Class ship will also offer a number of spectacular features with an array of exciting new food and beverage concepts; a magnificent, expanded casino; a two-story Lotus Spa; and mesmerising entertainment headlined by Cirque Éloize.\n\nWe have expanded the accommodations options with luxurious staterooms and suites, including the new Reserve and Signature Collections.\n\nStar Princess also will showcase the exclusive Princess Medallion service that will deliver exceptional personalised experiences.\n\nThe new ship will be the second in the Princess fleet to be powered by LNG fuel technology and is being built with the most advanced sustainable innovations available.\n\nStar Princess debuts August 4, 2025, sailing a nine-day Inaugural Italy & Greece roundtrip voyage from Rome (Civitavecchia), featuring the destinations of Corfu, Kotor, Mykonos, Santorini and Naples (for Capri and Pompeii), followed by a variety of 9- and 10-day cruises sailing from Rome, Athens or Trieste (Venice) that visit idyllic coastal ports. Star Princess cruises go on sale with the larger Europe 2025 programme release on June 1, 2023.\n\nPrincess’ first Star Princess ship initially launched in 1988 as Sitmar Fair Majesty. With the merger of Sitmar Cruises into Princess, she then entered service as Star Princess in 1989, and was christened by legendary actress and humanitarian Audrey Hepburn. The second Star Princess launched in 2002, as the third Grand Class vessel playing an instrumental role in the evolution of the brand with popular offerings like Anytime Dining, the only dining programme in the industry at the time to give guests freedom to dine where, when and with whom they wish."
