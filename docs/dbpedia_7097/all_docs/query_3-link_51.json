        "text": "Crystal is set to take delivery of two brand new, custom built ocean-going ships; the first of which is expected to arrive in 2028.\n\nIndeed, the A&K Travel Group have made no secret about their plans to grow the Crystal brand. As we reported, they have intentions of adding four new vessels to the fleet.\n\nThose plans are now coming to fruition with the signing of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Italian ship building giant, Fincantieri. Two groundbreaking 690-guest vessels will be constructed for Crystal, each weighing 61,800-gross-tons. An option for a third sister ship has also been secured.\n\n“This order is another milestone in the 40 years of productive collaboration between Fincantieri and my family that started with Sitmar Cruises, continued with Silversea and now is flourishing again with Crystal.”\n\nManfredi Lefebvre d’Ovidio – Executive Chairman of A&K Travel Group.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the size of the new vessels places them snuggly between the 606-guest Crystal Symphony and the 740-guest Crystal Serenity. So in contrast to the ever larger new-builds of other luxury lines, it would appear Crystal intends topping out its new ship passenger capacity at about 700 guests.\n\nRedefined luxury abroad the new Crystal ships\n\nCrystal promise the new vessels will redefine high-end travel at sea, with innovative designs and a host of new amenities.\n\nHowever, the new ships will also retain certain elements common to the line’s existing vessels; most notably magnificent promenade decks. These will extend through the entire perimeter of each new ship.\n\nMuch-loved restaurants will be on board too, including Umi Uma from Michelin-starred chef Nobu, as well as Beefbar which is a new addition to the Crystal brand.\n\nAccommodation on board\n\nAs you’d expect, the accommodation on the new Crystal ships will be ultra-luxurious. In fact, the vessels will boast all-suite accommodation – even for solo cruisers. Every suite will also have its own private veranda.\n\nCrystal tell us the interior design will feature precious marbles, Italian fabrics and natural materials. The aim of which is to achieve the sort of high-end feel typically associated with luxury residential properties.\n\nDelivery of the new Crystal ships\n\nThe first of the new Crystal ships is expected to enter service in the northern Spring of 2028. The delivery date of the second ship will be announced in the coming months. If Crystal proceed with the option for a third sister ship it is expect to arrive in 2032."
