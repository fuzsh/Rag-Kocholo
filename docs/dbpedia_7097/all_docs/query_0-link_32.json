        "text": "Two years after being revived by A&K Travel Group, Crystal has signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with Fincantieri to build two ocean-going cruise ships, along with an option for a third.\n\nThe 690-passenger, 61-800-gross-ton ships will feature all-suite accommodations, with private verandas including a veranda suite designed for solo travelers.\n\n“This order is another milestone in the 40 years of productive collaboration between Fincantieri and my family that started with Sitmar Cruises, continued with Silversea, and now is flourishing again with Crystal,” said Manfredi Lefebvre d’Ovidio, executive chairman of A&K Travel Group.\n\nThe vessels will feature a promenade extending around the entire ship’s perimeter; several dining options including the line’s popular Umi Uma (the only Nobu at sea); a comprehensive spa and fitness center; and a dedicated space for children.\n\n“Our aim is to continue setting a new standard in cruising, offering our guests an unmatched level of service and sophistication. These new ships will receive the same level of attention I have reserved to my own house,” added Cristina Levis, CEO of A&K Travel Group.\n\nThe first of the two ships is expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2028."
