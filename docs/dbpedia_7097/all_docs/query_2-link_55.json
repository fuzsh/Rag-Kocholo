        "text": "Classification: Premium\n\nPassenger/Space Ratio: 40\n\nWebsite: www.princess.com\n\nWell known for its role in The Love Boat television show in the 1970s, this line is now owned by Carnival Corporation but remains based in Los Angeles. From the start, when Princess Italia first steamed north to Alaska in 1969, Princess Cruises established a reputation for a high standard of service. Since acquiring the Italian Sitmar line in the mid 1980s,\n\nPrincess Cruises has experienced phenomenal growth, launching numerous ships in the last two decades, and these new megaships have all the modern facilities cruise passengers have come to expect, including swimming pools, health spas, tennis courts, Internet cafes and show lounges, as well as traditional features such as full-wrap teak promenade decks and intimate wood paneled pubs. A high number of staterooms have a private verandah, while the public areas are beautifully appointed with exotic woods and Italian marble.\n\nPrincess for many years focused on the Caribbean and Alaska but now offers cruises to destinations around the world, including the Mediterranean and Northern Europe.\n\nIn Alaska, Princess Cruises’ extensive and integrated tourist services provide hotels (including luxury lodges in Denali National Park), coaches and rail cars for its cruisetour passengers. Offering worldwide destinations, the line’s other itineraries include the Mexican Riviera, Panama Canal, South America and the Caribbean. Princess has succeeded in appealing to a wide market, from retired couples to young families, with ships that are well laid out with good amenities. Children’s facilities are good with spacious playrooms, teen centers and youth counsellors.\n\nOfficers and service staff are international."
