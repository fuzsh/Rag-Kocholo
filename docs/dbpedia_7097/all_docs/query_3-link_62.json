        "text": "Silversea cruises are the height of luxury. Our nearest port of call is Athens. LEO LEONIDOU makes it off just in time\n\nSETTING sail on a cruise conjures up images of far-away lands, unmatched views and high society. It was this I had in mind as I was whisked off to Piraeus Port in Athens in order to boarded the Silver Shadow.\n\nBefore being given the grand tour, it was into the main restaurant for a spot of lunch. An hour later, having consumed a champagne, red and white wine, crab, avocado, fish, veal and lemon tarte lunch, public relations officer, Michael Sugden led me round the ship.\n\nThe Silver Shadow is an amazing ship, with luxury in every detail. She has won every award, including ‘Best Small Ship’ almost every year. At 28,258 gross tons and 182 metres in length, she is a small ship that feels more like a private yacht. All of the public areas are located in the rear, leaving the forward portion for the suites. This works well as there no suites that adjoin public areas, guaranteeing privacy and a peaceful environment. Her small size also allows Silver Shadow to access many ports not readily available to larger ships, working in her favour as she offers unique itineraries to out-of-the-way ports not usually visited by mass-market lines.\n\nAn unprecedented 82 per cent of suite accommodations feature a wall of glass that opens onto a private teak veranda. Just as a home is a reflection of its owners, so too, each suite is a reflection of its guests.\n\nBeautifully appointed, every suite features a marbled bathroom with double vanity, full-sized bathtub and separate shower, DVD player and plasma television. Sugden informed me that “seven different types of suite are offered, ranging in size from 287 square feet to over 1,400.\n\nPrices begin at $3,000 per person, per ten days and go up to $14,000 for the Owner’s Suite. All food and drinks on board are complimentary. The in-suite beverage cabinet is also stocked daily on request with your preference of drink.” They were certainly more luxurious than any five-star hotel I have ever stayed in.\n\nThe Silver Shadow has a capacity for 382 guests and is operated by Silversea Cruises, a company reflecting generations of maritime and travel experience.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Lefebvre family of Rome, former owners of Sitmar Cruises, conceived and organised a unique cruise company, pledging to build and operate the highest quality ships in the ultra-luxury segment.\n\nSilversea launched its first ship, Silver Cloud, in 1994 followed by Silver Wind in 1995, and Silver Shadow in 2000.\n\nThese elite vessels, which sail under the Bahamian flag, were specifically designed for fewer guests, more space and the highest levels of personalised service.\n\nSilversea quickly became the favourite among modern, affluent travellers with its all-inclusive pricing and unmatched onboard products, enhanced by partnerships with some of the world’s most respected luxury brands such as Bvlgari and Relais & Chateaux.\n\nAll-ocean view suites, most with private veranda and open seating dining options so guests dine when, where and with whom they desire, add to the special ambience onboard. In fact, Silversea’s suites offer the highest ratio of space per guest of any fleet. But what is also unique is that the favourite amenities found on larger ships are also incorporated. The Silver Shadow features numerous restaurants and bars, a swimming pool, Observation Lounge, book and video library, internet café, casino, conference room, beauty salon and spa and gym, all over ten decks.\n\nThere is also The Show Lounge, which provides the full spectrum of entertainment, from contemporary to classical to opera. Feature films also play on the big screen.\n\nThe Champagne Room was my favourite, featuring an extensive connoisseur’s list of wines and champagnes, such as Dom Perignon and Louis Roederer Cristal.\n\nPerfectly placed adjacent to the Champagne Room is The Humidor. Created by Davidoff, it is exclusive and discreet and is stocked with the world’s finest cigars and cognacs. It also features wood-panelled walls and sumptuous leather chairs and, of course, a dedicated ventilation system.\n\nWhen asked to comment on the general public’s perception that most people who go on cruises are elderly, Sugden said, “it’s true that the average age of our guests is between 50 and 60, but I’m now seeing the age slowly coming down.”\n\nWith the ship’s passengers starting to make their way on-board for the trip to Istanbul and Venice, I reluctantly disembarked with one thought consuming me: it’s time to start saving.\n\nFor further information and reservations contact the general sales agent of Silversea in Cyprus, Aeolos Travel on 22 881218, or 22 881113\n\nWhat Are Cookies\n\nAs is common practice with almost all professional websites, https://cyprus-mail.com (our “Site”) uses cookies, which are tiny files that are downloaded to your device, to improve your experience.\n\nThis document describes what information they gather, how we use it, and why we sometimes need to store these cookies.
