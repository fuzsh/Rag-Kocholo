        "text": "Not too many years ago it looked as if ships would die out as a mode of transportation. As a means of crossing the world's oceans, they have practically faded away, but as a way of enabling travelers to enjoy a cruise vacation at sea they are flourishing, so much so that at least five liners are now under construction, and a sixth is planned.\n\nGoing into service in 1982 and 1983 will be the Tropicale of Carnivale Cruise Lines, the Atlantic of Home Lines, the Scandinavia of Scandinavian World Cruises, the Fairsky of Sitmar Cruises and the Nieuw Amsterdam of Holland America Cruises, which is planning a second ship that is not yet named.\n\nThe first to be completed is the Tropicale, scheduled to enter cruise service next January. Termed the ''ship of the 90's,'' the 30,000-ton vessel will be the ninth largest passenger ship in the world. She is being built at the Aalborg Shipyard in Denmark at a cost of $100 million. The Tropicale will have nine passenger decks, and 95 percent of the cabins will have twin beds that can convert to king-size beds. Each cabin will have its own closed-circuit TV set.\n\nThe first all-new passenger ship constructed since 1974, the Tropicale will have such advances in engineering as controlled pitch propellers, computerized bridge control, stabilizers and bow thrusters. The navigation bridge will be enclosed and airconditioned, providing protection for the electronic equipment, and the ship's propeller will be controlled directly from the bridge, eliminating the engine room telegraph and permitting greater control of the vesssel during maneuvering.\n\nThe Tropicale will be operated on the West Coast by Carnival and Westours of Seattle after an initial period in the Caribbean. The ship will leave the Caribbean on May 15, 1982, for a trans-Panama Canal positioning cruise and then on June 5 begin a series of sevenday Alaska cruises out of Vancouver with weekly calls at Ketchikan, Juneau, Glacier Bay and Sitka. On Sept. 12 the Tropicale will begin sailing out of Los Angeles on seven-day Mexican Riviera cruises, calling at Cabo San Lucas, Puerto Vallarta and Mazatlan.\n\nThe Atlantic, a 30,000-ton liner costing about $100 million and capable of carrying 1,155 passengers, is to be launched in La Seynesur-Mer, a suburb of Toulon on the south coast of France. The yard, Constructions Navales et Industrielles de la Mediterranee, is the one that built the Sagafjord for Norwegian America Cruises in 1965. Fitting and completion will take about a year. The Atlantic's delivery date is early March 1982, and the first run, from New York to Bermuda, is planned for April 1982.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
