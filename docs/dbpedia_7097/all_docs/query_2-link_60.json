        "text": "Princess Cruises, headquartered in Santa Clarita, has revealed the name of its second Sphere Class cruise ship – Star Princess, which will sail an inaugural season of Mediterranean voyages when she debuts in August 2025.\n\nCurrently under construction at the Fincantieri shipyard in Italy, Star Princess joins Sun Princess as the largest ships ever built for Princess at 175,500 tons and carrying 4,300 guests.\n\nThe new ship is built on a platform that is distinctly different and unique to Princess, designed to simultaneously embrace the Princess heritage while celebrating the romance of the sea by offering more dynamic, outward views.\n\nWhile 20 percent larger than any of the line’s existing ships, the Star Princess design retains the more intimate settings Princess is known for, with a number of new ground-breaking spaces such as:\n\nThe Dome, a transformational entertainment venue inspired by the terraces of Santorini;\n\nthe next-level Piazza featuring a glass sphere, the “see it to believe it” Princess Arena, a configurable, technologically-advanced main theater that allows Princess to produce a variety of innovative entertainment concepts and a dining room positioned aft of the ship to deliver wake views.\n\nThis second Sphere Class ship will also offer a number of spectacular features with an array of new food and beverage concepts; an expanded casino; a two-story Lotus Spa and entertainment headlined by Cirque Éloize.\n\nGuests also will enjoy expanded accommodations options with luxurious staterooms and suites, including the new Reserve and Signature Collections.\n\nThe new ship will be the second in the Princess fleet to be powered by LNG fuel technology and also is being built with the most advanced sustainable innovations available.\n\nStar Princess debuts Aug. 4, 2025, sailing a nine-day inaugural Italy and Greece roundtrip voyage from Rome (Civitavecchia), featuring the destinations of Corfu, Kotor, Mykonos, Santorini and Naples (for Capri and Pompeii), followed by a variety of 9- and 10-day cruises sailing from Rome, Athens or Trieste (Venice) that visit idyllic coastal ports. Star Princess cruises go on sale with the larger Europe 2025 program release on June 1, 2023.\n\n“There’s much to be admired about Star Princess, her sleek, eye-catching design, spacious interiors and of course, the remarkable views of the sea and sky, just like the features found on Sun Princess that have prompted cruise lovers to snap up inaugural year bookings,” said John Padgett, president of Princess Cruises. “We’ve carefully designed these ships to feel familiar to our guests yet significantly advanced with lots of exceptional new and expanded experiences to embrace and explore.”\n\nPrincess’ first Star Princess ship initially launched in 1988 as Sitmar Fair Majesty. With the merger of Sitmar Cruises into Princess, she then entered service as Star Princess in 1989 and was christened by legendary actress and humanitarian Audrey Hepburn. The second Star Princess launched in 2002, as the third Grand-Class vessel playing an instrumental role in the evolution of the brand with popular offerings like Anytime Dining, the only dining program in the industry at the time to give guests freedom to dine where, when and with whom they wish.\n\nFurther details about Star Princess including dining, entertainment, onboard amenities and future itineraries will be shared in the coming months.
