        "text": "The last time my older sister, Alex, and I had been on a cruise together, industrial-size cans of Aqua Net, used to shellac our bangs into four-inch crowns, could pass through airport X-ray machines without a blip. The year was 1987.\n\nFor the better part of our childhood, Alex and I accompanied our mother, a professional singer and onboard entertainer, on a dozen or so cruises to the Caribbean, Mexico, Alaska, the Mediterranean, the Panama Canal. Some of the lines, like the Italian-staffed Sitmar Cruises, whose late-night thin-crust pizza I still dream about, have long since given up their fleets. Back then, the world’s biggest cruise ship, the S.S. France, held more than 2,000 passengers; today, Royal Caribbean’s Symphony of the Seas can carry 6,680.\n\nWhen we were little, the three of us traveled with my mother’s pianist and her two daughters, who were like family. We’d all eat dinner around one big table. By the time we were teens, we got to bring friends along. All these years later, I still ache for that ritual of dining together on a cruise ship, with its built-in sense of conviviality and familial safety (whether or not you’re traveling with actual family). We always opted for the livelier second dinner seating, except on the nights my mom performed. With four teenage girls sharing a tiny interior cabin with one shower, we needed the extra time to get ready. When the crew broadcast our seating with the tinkle of a xylophone, all four berths and every inch of tabletop would be covered with hair-brushes, towels, neon bikinis, and frosted pink and orange lipsticks called Silver City Pink or Burnt Sienna.\n\nWhen my sister and I recently boarded the Crystal Serenity for the Suez Canal portion of its world cruise, it was just the two of us. Giddy with nostalgia, we fell into a familiar rhythm of exploring every corner of the ship like we did when we were 10 and 7, resisting the urge to peek into open cabin doors. Though we’ve since streamlined our beauty routines, our much roomier and more elegant cabin still suffered the vandalism of females getting ready for dinner. We ate at every restaurant at least once—Silk Road (a Nobu restaurant) for sushi one night, Prego for Italian the next—and on our last night, we shut down the Avenue Saloon bar with a Billy Joel “Piano Man” sing-along.\n\nAs hard as we squeezed every last drop from our 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. tour of Jerusalem, we relished even more our days at sea together with no agenda at all. It was the first time in years that our only obligation was choosing between spinning and yoga, that we talked sometimes for two hours straight before returning to our books for another three—interrupted only by the apparition of some land mass or, just as we were getting a little peckish, a surprise hummus and cheese platter and glass of Champagne. Something about the slow unfolding of time at sea—with the perennial horizon almost as a metaphor—took us back to an age when we’d imagined we’d sail on like this forever."
