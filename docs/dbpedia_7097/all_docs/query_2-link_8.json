        "text": "Cruisers have strong loyalties to their favorite cruise line, so my attempt to compare here could be a fool’s errand. There are six mass-market cruise lines that most North American cruise lovers frequent. There are some other peripheral players, but over 80% of the cruise business is through the companies discussed below.\n\nThe Price Leaders: Norwegian and Carnival are the two lines most likely to attract customers based on the price point. This doesn’t mean they are always the cheapest – that changes cruise by cruise – but it does mean they are most likely to differentiate themselves by price. Their typical passenger profile varies widely, although Norwegian makes a specific point of marketing “Free Style Cruising” for those that aren’t interested in formal nights and the other more rigid aspects of cruise vacations. Carnival dominates in the Caribbean, but is really a bit-player in other cruise markets. Norwegian has a few ships in just about every cruise market. If you love one of these two lines, you can sail with them to just about anywhere – although you’ll have fewer options than you would on other lines outside of the Caribbean.\n\nThe Mid-Market Lines:Princess and Royal Caribbean are the two lines that try to offer something for everyone. On both these lines, you will find many families and multi-generational groups because they cater to all age groups and interests. Royal Caribbean is dominant in the Caribbean market, and has ships there year round. They also have the most innovative ships at sea. If you like the idea of climbing walls, ice skating rinks, bumper cars, zip-lines etc., then RCCL is the line for you.\n\nPrincess is the line with more innovative itineraries and destinations. They have a huge presence in Alaska, as well as Asia, the South Pacific, and Europe. With their acquisition of Sitmar Cruises back in the 90s, they positioned themselves as the line to sail on with children.\n\nThe Retired Crowd: For some people, the idea of being on a big ship with several hundred kids running around is not their idea of a relaxing vacation. In this case, Holland America might be the right choice. HAL has smaller ships, with fewer passengers, and tries to position itself as a more upmarket offering than the other mass-market lines. There is not doubt they are marketing to an older demographic, but lots of middle-aged people sail with them, and love it. With most of their ships in the 70000 ton range, they area also able to visit some ports that larger ships are unable to get into."
