        "text": "In this short article, we learn more about the Australian cruise market, and what cruise options you have if you want to sail there.\n\nI have never been lucky enough to travel to Australia on a cruise, but it is definitely on my bucket list!\n\nAustralian cruising is dominated by two Carnival Cruise brands that operate out of Australia all year round.\n\nP&O Australia\n\nP&O Australia dates its heritage back to the 1930s.\n\nThey started offering cruises on ocean liners, doing turn arounds between its voyages between the UK and Australia.\n\nThey offered short cruises to the South Pacific\n\nP&O Australia bought Sitmar Cruises in the 1980s.\n\nThe Sitmar Fairstar – the most famous ship in the Australian cruise market operated until the 1990s\n\nThey currently have three ships, the Pacific Adventure, Pacific Encounter and Pacific Explorer.\n\nAll of these are former Princess Cruise line Ships.\n\nP&O Australia has never had a new ship, it always sails second-hand ships transferred from within its parent company\n\nP&O Australia sails to New Zealand and the South Pacific.\n\nP&O Australia offers fun and casual cruising. There is lots to enjoy – Bars, Shows, Cruise Lectures, a Spa, Pools, and Adventure Courses on the top decks.\n\nCarnival Cruise Line\n\nCarnival has two ships sailing in Australian waters at the moment. These ships are Carnival Splenda and Carnival Luminosa.\n\nBoth of these ships have had “Australianised” refits to suit the Australian Cruise Market.\n\nThey sail out of many ports. These include Sydney and Brisbane’s new cruise terminal.\n\nCarnival also offers a relaxed approach to cruising. Expect shows, bars, water slides and a fun cruise experience.\n\nP&O Australia and Carnival sail from Australia all year round.\n\nOther ships in Australian Waters\n\nOther cruise lines – such as Royal Caribbean and Celebrity also offer voyages from and to Australia – but in the Australian Summer season only. (October to March)\n\nShips that only visit Australia during peak seasons will charge onboard in their local currency – i.e. American Dollars\n\nP&O Australia and Carnival use Australian Dollars onboard to suit the Australian market.\n\nOther Smaller Australian Cruise Lines\n\nOther, smaller, home-grown expedition cruise lines, such as Coral Cruises operate out of Australia. They focus on trips to small ports and itineraries that the larger cruise ships can’t visit.\n\nNow you have an idea of the options available if you want to cruise from or to, or around Australia!\n\nBefore You Go\n\nYou may be wondering when is the best time of year to cruise to different destinations.
