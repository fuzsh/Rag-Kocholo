Another directory will appear on Feb. 7 covering most of the rest of 1988.\n\nInformation for the directory was supplied by the individual cruise companies, but dates, ports of call and fares are all subject to change.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the fares quoted are for one person in double occupancy, exclusive of port taxes, and some fares may be subject to currency fluctuations.\n\nSuch incentives as advance purchase plans as well as other discounts are frequently available, particularly to groups or to a third or fourth person in a cabin, and free or reduced fares for children are generally offered.\n\nSome ships have cabins for single passengers, and they are sometimes available at the rate for one person in double occupancy.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
