        "text": "It’s Crystal Clear, the ships of Crystal , Serenity and Symphony are back but let’s start my summary of our experience at the end!\n\nWe’ve disembarked in Marseille, checked in to the Sofitel overlooking the port and waiting at the elevators to head to our room – An English couple step out and immediately randomly ask us are we are we off the ship, , we say yes and there goes a 15 minutes review of our time and what they were looking for. This couple are typical Crystal Society members, so loyal and so longing for their Marseille to Lisbon voyage they were close to tears as they told us how excited they were and quizzed us on our experience.\n\nAs we embarked in the new Venice port of Fusina (some 25mins by coach) and walked into the lobby on deck 5, some of our colleagues were actually in tears – tears of joy! The ships of Crystal have ‘soul’. We had been invited with other global travel colleagues to take part in the 6 night shakedown cruise from Venice to Marseille,via Dubrovnik, Naples and Livorno.\n\nThis revitalised dream is that of ‘a sea salt family’ D’Ovidio, better known to Australians as Le Febre, that is Manfreddi Le Febre, founder of Silversea Cruises and before that Sitmar Cruises , indeed the family goes back at sea to 1818., After the sale of Silverseas in 2018 to Royal Caribbean he longed for another challenge and the timing was right for Crystal post Covid so together with his CEO Cristina Levis they set about getting back to what they knew, ocean cruising. They are also a part of the Abercrombie and Kent Travel Group so this cruise line has enhanced ocean experience and land experiences which will eventually be curated pre and post options and indeed incruise experiences of overland options in many global ports.\n\nIt is an honour to be a part of a shakedown or christening cruise , the first to experience it and the emotional speeches that were made in Naples about the journey of Crystal shared by the entire Crystal team. Now speaking about team, on our voyage 83% of the former Crystal team members ‘were back’ – the service exemplary, their memory more so, - one day at lunch in the Waterfront a waiter said, welcome back Mr and Mrs Sinfield, he remembered us from a voyage we did Dubai to Capetown., .like coming home. We’ve done a lot of cruises across all brands post Covid and it would be fair to say service has been hit and miss as cruise lines struggle to find new to cruise employees globally, this certainly is not an issue for Crystal, service simply exceptional,\n\nIt’s our first time on Serenity, all of our loyalty days have been Symphony simply because where we wanted to sail, ,Symphony was doing it it’s vastly different now as through the rebirth of the ships Serenity has been reduced to maximum 740 guests and Symphony just 606 with an almost one to one crew to guest ratio. These ships before where an amazing space ratio, now they are even more so.\n\nCheck in is friendly and efficient and our suites are ready and lunch is being served so first things first, head to our suite 8014 and drop the bags –we have been allocated a newly refurbished Sapphire verandah suite of 430 sq ft and our verandah of 107 sq ft. It’s elegant, it’s private , our butler is attentive to our needs and our privacy – Private veranda, Spacious living room and dining area., Queen-size bed or twin beds with sumptuous bedding, and a third berth.,Walk-in closet.,Two TV’s.,Turndown service .,Dry cleaning for five pieces plus one complimentary bag of laundry every 10 cruise days, 2nd day service., Fresh flowers and afternoon canapés. Really our suite in sublime luxury but we inspected all the categories from the amazing Crystal Penthouse to oceanview – all renovated and refreshed with dedicated solo traveller oceanview cabins, and a new verandah category Aquamarine.\n\nOur wheelie bags are dropped so now it’s time for lunch and we have the choice , of course we do, it’s Crystal – the dining room Watefront, the buffet Marketplace, the small plates of Tastes or the pool grill , Trident. The brochure states, ‘Dining with Crystal is the ultimate culinary experience. With nine distinct options, we offer the best food for whatever suits your mood. Enjoy everything from award-winning, innovative fusion cuisine and signature cocktail bars to the best of traditional food and wine.’ Yes that would be accurate , very few ships on embarkation day offer choice, we opt for Tastes Kitchen and Bar . With a generous amount of seating it’s the tapas style. Cuisine which is light , seasonal and our menu on the day featured pot stickers to Mexican tastes. After lunch and some fantastic included drinks, French Rose, we back to our suite and our bags ready to be unpacked by ourselves or the Butler, the choice is yours!\n\nLet me walk you through the dining choices we experienced onboard in our 6 nights at sea, UMI UMA BY NOBU MATSUHISA RESTAURANT AND SUSHI BAR Here reservations are required and depending on the voyage length , generally two covers are included with a USD50 pp for extra, but boy oh boy that surcharge is well worth the extra visit - Few restaurants can boast a creative vision of contemporary cuisine as Nobu. Japanese-Peruvian dishes.\n\nOSTERIA D’OVIDIO Here reservations are required and depending on the voyage length , generally two covers are included with a USD50 pp for extra.Fine Italian dining takes center stage at Osteria d’Ovidio. This exclusive specialty restaurant offers a modern twist on traditional fine Italian cuisine fashioned after the family recipes of the owner Manfreddi LeFebre D’Ovidio (ex Silversea founder). WATERSIDE RESTAURANT | deck 5 near the Lobby Take your tastebuds modern, international cuisine , open for Breakfast lunch and dinner, superb table service and all ships have the coffee shop, here on Crystal they’ve name it THE BISTRO, twice the size of the old Crystal ships it’s A nod to the mythic bars and bistros of Paris. Celebrate the classics in this spacious and airy café that serves light bites from dawn to dusk. A great place to gather before or after a tour\n\nTHE VINTAGE ROOM we didn’t get to experience this , this time but we have in the past, an amazing venue for special events like an 0 birthday, USD300 pp paired food and wine, educational by the waiter and sommelier and a max seating of 14 persons\n\nTRIDENT GRILL | deck 12 Enjoy a burger with a view! The pool restaurant and grill offers a comfortable terrace highlighted by an elegant design, making it the perfect spot for al fresco dining. And adjacent is Scoops Ice Cream Bar where the best Italian Gelato is served with a sea view, Of course Room Service for breakfast and other times is a big hit , served superbly by the Butler (who is across all stateroom categories).\n\nThe Crystal of the past had the best entertainment at sea, and the new Crystal is no different , each evening offering world class performances and hosts. It could be the latest Hollywood release in the theatre, a performance in a lounge, a late night time of fellowship in the night club., Crystal is the only company at sea that offers two performances at different times in different venues each night (Galaxy Lounge and StarDust Night Club and Supper Club) - after dinner times in the Avenue Saloon, Crystal Cove with the pianist,\n\nThe Library (my favourite room) is well stocked containing over 2,000 books on a range of subjects from classics to popular biographies, and history to contemporary mysteries. Plus, enjoy an ample selection of magazines and board games perfect for poolside reading. A great place to head each day for that relaxing read on your verandah or by the pool. Or you can visit the Computer University at sea which has a myriad of lessons for all types of computer learning but if you don’ t have time for that, what about some retail therapy at Apropos and Facets. ? Like a cigar, then by the Avenue Bar you have Connoisseur Club and then there is the new ‘buzz word’ , Wellness.\n\nAurora is the name of the spa which features Elemis products., with all the treatments you would expect (at the normal exaggerated ship pricing!) and the fitness centre is some 3000 sq feet with everything you’d expect …..I know, yes they take kids,,, we had some on our voyage that were well cared for in Wave’s Teen Centre and Fantasia Children’s playroom which specialise in fun for the junior cruiser.\n\nThe evidence of an onboard florist is everywhere, stunning floral displays from large to small creating the perfect ambience amidst their new décor and colour palates which are restful and relaxing.,\n\nCrystal is an inclusive cruise ship with quality beverages (incl alcoholic), a no tipping policy, dine when and where you want with whom you want and other than the Vintage Room or MULTIPLE covers at the two speciality restaurants all dining is included in the fare – their Loyalty Program Crystal Society is the same as pre Covid .\n\nIn conclusion , the 150M USD spent on Serenity was well and truly worth it bringing this grand Crystal lady to life again and what the team at Crystal has achieved, which is effectively a ‘start up ‘ is nothing short of miraculous, - on time, welcoming and ready for years ahead of ocean cruising – and to be joined in the coming years by two new ocean and two new expedition ships, exciting days ahead.,"
