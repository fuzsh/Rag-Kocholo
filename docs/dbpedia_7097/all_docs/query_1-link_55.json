        "text": "MAN B&W Diesel GmbH of Augsburg, West Germany, has received an order for four BL 58/64 type four-stroke diesel engines with a total output of about 53,000 bhp at 400 rpm from the French shipyard Chantiers de l'Atlantique in St. Nazaire, the shipbuilding division of Alsthom. The order totals more than 20 million DM (about $10 million).\n\nThese four engines will supply the energy for the diesel-electric propulsion and electrical system of a cruise vessel ordered by Sitmar Cruises of Los Angeles. Fcr increased passenger comfort, the engines will be seated on resilient mounts developed by MAN B&W. The engines and alternators will be connected via highly flexible couplings. Two three-phase propulsion motors of 12,000 kw each supplied by CGEE Alsthom will drive a fixed-pitch propeller.\n\nThe 803.8-foot, 13-deck ship will have a capacity for 1,400 passengers in 700 cabins.\n\nThe MAN B&W 58/64 series engine is a modern, extraordinarily fuel-saving and low-maintenance four-stroke engine. Its specific fuel consumption is said to be only 171 g/kwh. Already 23 engines of this type have been ordered from all parts of the world totaling nearly 300,000 bhp, including the 130,000 bhp of the new propulsion plant for the Queen Elizabeth 2.\n\nFor complete information and free literature on the MAN B&W 58/64 engine series, Circle 26 on Reader Service Card"
