        "text": "You are undoubtedly aware that the pandemic caused complete carnage for EVERYONE involved in the tourism sector on a scale never seen before, and the effects of which we are still recovering. The poster child for pressure on the cruise segment was the demise of Crystal Cruises in 2022.\n\nCrystal operated two ocean vessels, four river boats, and a 787-LR custom aircraft (if you want to see our video of our ride on the plane here’s the link: https://youtu.be/4YaJcEpBsSc?si=JXpuZlkHCsQjsVfC\n\nAll these assets were seized when Crystal’s parent company couldn’t pay its bills, and were sold off to pay staff, clients, and creditors.\n\nA few months after this depressing debacle, it was announced that Abercrombie and Kent (a well established, luxury land tour operator, partially owned by Manfredi Lefebvre – previously of SilverSea and Sitmar Cruises fame), would buy up the ocean vessels and attempt to resurrect the brand.\n\nI thought this was a textbook case of a really poorly thought out business strategy. The Crystal Ocean ships are old (29 and 22 years old), not particularly fuel efficient, and perhaps worst of all – Crystal was a very badly damaged brand, that upset a lot of travellers.\n\nI was wrong. I always knew Crystal had an incredibly loyal following, and the A&K Group leveraged this to resurrect the brand. They hired back many of the same shipboard staff, offered travellers a credit that lost their money to the OLD Crystal, and updated the ocean vessels.\n\nWe have not been on board the new Crystal yet, but by all accounts those that previously loved Crystal are coming back again as raving fans.\n\nIn case you’re wondering, the river ships were bought up by Riverside Luxury Cruises, and two of them have become part of Uniworld’s fleet. The plane was bought up by an aviation specialist that does private VIP charters.\n\nSo all of this got me wondering with the recent demise of American Queen Voyages, whether we can expect a resurrection there as well. We really liked the American Queen on board product, and as more details come to light about the situation leading to their bankruptcy, it’s becoming clear they were mismanaged into receivership.\n\nStill, there are structural challenges to making a go of it in US waters. Protectionist measures put in place decades ago by the Federal Government (and left in place by successive governments), make it very difficult for operators of cruises that operate exclusively in the US to compete. American staff and crew are notoriously difficult to retain, and travellers just aren’t willing to pay more for a domestic river cruise than they would elsewhere in the world.\n\nThe paddle wheeler vessels themselves are very expensive to operate — it’s old technology. We loved the American Queen on board product, but it doesn’t engender the same raving fans that Crystal did, and you can only take so many cruises on the Mississippi River system, whereas the Crystal Ocean ships can move to various markets around the globe.\n\nSo I’m not as hopeful for AQ’s resurrection, but we need good domestic river cruise options, so I guess you never know!\n\nToday’s Travel Opportunities\n\nCRYSTAL CRUISES:\n\nQuebec City to NYC departing September 24 for 7 nights:\n\nVisit Quebec City (overnight), Halifax, Saint John, Portland, Newport, NYC\n\nVeranda from $5100 per person.\n\nReykjavik round-trip departing September 1 for 7-nights:\n\nVisit 5 ports of call in Iceland, as well as the Faroe Islands\n\nOceanviews from $5400.
