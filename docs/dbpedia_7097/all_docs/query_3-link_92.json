If you choose to take advantage of a promotion, respond to a survey, or enter a contest or sweepstakes, we collect your personal identifiers, customer records and any other personal information you are requested to provide at the time, or choose to provide to us.

By providing us with the travel or contact information of any third party, you confirm that you have the authority to do so on their behalf and have provided them with the information set out in this Privacy Notice. The personal information of each person whose personal information is linked to the same travel itinerary may be accessible by all others included in that same itinerary.\n\nB. While You Are On Your Vacation.\n\nWhen you take part in the Services aboard one of our ships or at one of our properties, we collect information about your visit, including information about your interactions with our staff, programming and with the technology-enhanced features of our ships and hotels.\n\nThere are a few different types of vacation experiences where we may collect and use your information:\n\nAMENITIES, EXCURSIONS & ADD-ON SERVICES. If you choose to take advantage of our amenities or enhance your vacation with on-board purchases of goods or Services, we collect your personal identifiers, customer records, and commercial information. Depending on the Service, we may also need to collect information about your health or medical conditions. We use this information to process your transaction, book and administer your Services, to communicate with you and those traveling with you about your Services, and to inform our advertising and marketing activities. Where the Services are provided by third-party companies, we will use your information to coordinate and facilitate their provision of the Service.\n\nINCIDENTS AND HEALTH SCREENINGS. If, while traveling with us, you suffer a personal injury, fall ill, submit a claim about a personal injury, or are otherwise involved in an incident, we collect your personal identifiers, health or medical information and details about the incident. We may also screen you for symptoms of potential contagions, such as COVID-19, that may present a risk to the other guests and crew members aboard our ships, including through temperature checks, self-assessment questionnaires and tissue sampling. We use this information to attend to your medical and safety needs and those of our guests and crew, maintain records of incidents, facilitate investigations and remedies, to protect our rights and the rights of our guests, for security and public health purposes, to prevent fraud, and to improve our Services.\n\nPHOTO & VIDEO FOOTAGE. We collect a security photo at or before you board our ships. We operate closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras on board our ships, including at all access points and throughout the public areas. These CCTV cameras record continually and images of you may appear in these recordings (\"CCTV images\"). Photographers and camera crews take photographs and make films for guests to purchase at the end of their vacation or for our own promotional use. They are happy to take reasonable steps to avoid filming or photographing you where you indicate to the person with the camera that this is your preference , but we are unable to guarantee that your images will not be included on an incidental basis. We use this information for our own promotional purposes, to maintain records of incidents, facilitate investigations and remedies, to protect our rights and the rights of our guests, for security purposes, to enable public health measures, to prevent fraud, and to improve our Services. We may apply facial recognition technology to your security photo to facilitate camera-enabled rapid embarkation, debarkation, at entry and exit of the vessel at ports of call. We may also use facial recognition to link the pictures and videos taken by onboard photographers or videographers to you for ease of ordering and to reduce paper waste. After sailing, you will still be able to access your linked photos and videos via our connection with a third-party photo library service. We delete facial biometric identifiers promptly following completion of the voyage though we may retain any photos that have been identified and linked to a guest account for up to two (2) years to enable guest access and purchase of photos and photo memorabilia after the end of the voyage.\n\nCASINO. If you choose to play or use the services in one of our Casinos or gaming arcades and/or participate in one or more bingo sessions or online gaming experiences, we may collect your personal identifiers, customer records and commercial information.

We may use this information to validate your identity and age, to determine your eligibility for promotions and offers during your vacation and for future travel, to inform our marketing and advertising activities, and to communicate directly with you. In addition, we may use this information to generate win/loss statement, to conduct credit checks, process lines of credit, or otherwise as needed to comply with our legal obligations and to prevent or investigate fraud. Note: guest casino sites may only be available in international waters or locations where permitted by applicable jurisdictional laws.\n\nC.
