        "text": "M erchants with a surplus of goods have at least two choices: They can cut the price or let the goods sit on the shelf until demand picks up. Cruise ship operators have less leeway. They cannot store up unsold berths. Once a vessel sails, the chance to profit further from that cruise is gone. When demand slackens, cruise lines must act quickly to attract passengers.\n\nAs the cruise-ship industry feels the effects of a weakened economy, growing numbers of companies are offering such inducements as free air fare, cash incentives, fare reductions, free third-person passage, half-price sales, free hotel stays and standby fares.\n\nThe most widespread response to the drop in cruise business has been to broaden supplemental air programs by offering free roundtrip air transportation from hometown to port of embarkation. Some examples are the programs offered by Carnival Cruise Lines, Norwegian Caribbean Lines and Sitmar Cruises.\n\nCarnival offers free air transporation to Miami from 100 United States cities for the first two passengers in a cabin sailing in the Caribbean aboard the Carnivale, the Festivale and the Mardi Gras.\n\nNorwegian Caribbean Lines provides free air fare to Miami from more than 100 United States cities to the first two passengers on most seven-night cruises through Jan. 16, 1983, on the Norway, Skyward, Southward and Starward.\n\nSitmar is giving all passengers, even third and fourth passengers sharing a cabin, free round-trip air fare from 130 U.S. cities to all cruises on the Fairsea and the Fairwind.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
