She immediately reported the accident to shipboard personnel who took her statement and conducted an investigation.\n\nOn October 3, 1988, appellant's attorney wrote to Sitmar requesting information concerning Sitmar's liability insurance. Discussions between Sitmar and appellant's attorney followed, and several months later, on January 19, 1989, Sitmar's claims representative provided appellant with a copy of the accident report taken shipboard and requested that appellant's attorney provide him with copies of appellant's medical reports, her theory of liability, support for special damages, and a settlement demand. On February 1, 1989, appellant's attorney advised Sitmar that the information was being organized and he would be \"in touch.\" On April 25, 1989, appellant's attorney submitted to Sitmar some medical records and an itemized statement of medical However, on June 14, 1989, unbeknown to respondents, appellant's counsel had filed, but not served, the complaint in this action. In fact, appellant did not serve this lawsuit until September 7, 1990, almost 15 months after the complaint was filed and over two years after the incident.\n\nbills, then totalling $775. The parties had no further contact. Accordingly on February 5, 1990, over a year from the alleged injury, the claims representative advised Princess to close its file.\n\nWhat is significant here, however, is that service was made 14 months beyond a one-year limitations period for service of process which appeared on the back of appellant's cruise ticket passage contract. For that reason, on December 13, 1990, respondents moved for summary judgment in the superior court on the sole ground appellant's action was barred by her failure to serve respondents within one year of the injury.\n\nProvision No. 14 on appellant's cruise ticket passage contract was entitled \"CLAIMS FOR INJURY OR DEATH\" and provided in pertinent part: \"Sitmar shall not be liable for and no suit shall be maintainable for injury or death to the passenger unless (A) the passenger has given notice to Sitmar in writing with full particulars within six (6) months after the injury or death; and (B) the passenger has commenced suit and served process regarding incidents of this nature within one (1) year.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\nProvision No. 21 on the passage contract stated: \"ENFORCEABILITY OF ENTIRE CONTRACT. If any terms or provisions of the contract are deemed invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the contract and its application shall remain in full force and effect.\""
