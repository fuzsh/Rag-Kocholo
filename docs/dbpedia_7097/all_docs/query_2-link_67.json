Reader Offers Ltd are doing a truly fabulous job in these troubled times.\n\nFantastic Service\n\nWe have used Reader Offers Ltd on several occasions and every member of staff we have dealt with has been polite, professional and knowledgeable. Each question and/or request has been handled efficiently and with the utmost attention to detail. We highly recommend.\n\nExcellent Service Every Time\n\nYou always feel as if you are talking to friends when you speak to the Reader Offers Ltd team. It must be very stressful for them at this present time but you would not know it. Would certainly recommend them and no doubt shall be using them for years to come.\n\nWell done ROL\n\nIn view of the many thousands of calls they must have been having about the coronovirus the operator went out of his way to help us. He spent time explaining our options and we never felt anything was any trouble. Well done ROL\n\nExcellent service\n\nExcellent knowledgeable service from Adam. I am awaiting the final confirmation of the transfer request following the virus issue. In view of the circumstances service could not have been any better.\n\nI will always use ROL and recommend the company to everyone\n\nExcellent service as usual. All of my questions were answered with courtesy. I was anxious to transfer a cruise and rebook at a later date. ROL gave me very good advice, contacted the cruise company and called me back twice. They resolved my problem as usual.\n\nBack For More\n\nThis is not the first time we have booked a cruise with ROL and it certainly won't be the last. Apart from the many deals which may be available, the staff are always friendly, knowledgeable and ready to help in any way they can."
