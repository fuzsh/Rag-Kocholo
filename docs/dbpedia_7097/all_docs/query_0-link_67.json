        "text": "Crystal Serenity and Crystal Symphony have been bought by A&K Travel Group Ltd., owned by Geoffrey Kent and a holding company chaired by cruise industry pioneer Manfredi Lefebvre d’Ovidio. The luxury travel company says it plans to put the laid up ships back into service in 2023 after extensive refurbishment and they will still be branded Crystal Cruises.\n\n“I am thrilled to start this new chapter and to be back in an industry that has always had, and always will have a special place in my heart,” d’Ovidio said. “Thirty-five years ago, my family acquired control of Sitmar Cruises, building three of the first purpose-built cruise ships, and 30 years ago my family pioneered a new way of cruising. Our goal was to deliver the best experience, pampering guests from all over the world with around-the-clock butler service and extraordinary culinary experiences.\n\n“Selling the cruise business that belonged to my family for a quarter of a century was a difficult decision, as I knew I would miss this industry immensely. Therefore, when the opportunity arose to acquire Crystal Cruises, I did not think about it twice. “\n\nCrystal Cruises and Abercrombie & Kent will report to Cristina Levis, CEO of A&K Travel Group Ltd., who commented: “My return to luxury cruising after five years brings back so many emotions. It is an immense privilege to serve these two incredible brands that in the past decades have disrupted the travel industry numerous times.”\n\nThe ships have been out of service due to the bankruptcy of previous owner. Hong Kong-based Genting. They were put up for auction and sold to A&K for a total of $130-milllion.\n\nA&K will partner with V.Ships Leisure, the world’s leading cruise ship manager, based in Monaco, to plan the relaunch.\n\nStory by Wallace Immen, The Cruisington Times"
