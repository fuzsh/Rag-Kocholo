Not all our later cruises have been with Princess. If we get the correct dates it will put us over the days required for Elite. National Archives and Immigration do not hold data if your returning to Australia from a cruise. I have got Newspaper shipping arrivals & departures but only from Sydney, We embarked in Brisbane on the longest one and we cannot find the dates of the full cruise. Princess has given us 7days for each cruise however they were all more than that one being 21 days in 1974. They are quite happy to give us the correct days if we can get the proof. Has anyone travelled on Oriana November/December 1972, Fairsky September 1974 or Fairstar April 1991. Maybe someone has kept a bit more memorabilia that we did or does someone know where the heck you can get the info from.\n\nWe have also tried Lloyds in England to no avail.\n\nI hope I'm not asking the wrong thing for this Board, if so just ignore. I also hope there is someone that can assist.\n\nEdited June 21, 2019 by Savitore\n\nSpelling\n\nYou are not asking the wrong thing. Hopefully some one will have been on one of the cruises you are trying to prove and be able to supply you with more information. We were able to prove our first 8 or 10 cruises because our photo albums had a little cut-out from the cruise brochure that showed date, cruise number and ports of call. It is possible that someone here will be able to give you that information so you can get these cruises credited to your Captain's Circle account.\n\nI have just checked: we were on a Fairstar cruise from 12th January, 1991, not in April 1991.\n\nEdited June 21, 2019 by Aus Traveller\n\nEureka! We have found the Fairstar cruise book for 1991. The April 1991 cruises are as follows:\n\n7th April, cruise number 63, 13 nights from Sydney to Lautoka, Champagne Bay, Vila, Mystery Is and Noumea.\n\n20th April, cruise number 64, 14 nights from Sydney to Suva, Dravuni Island, Lautoka, Vila, Mystery Island and Noumea.\n\nYou will probably remember from the ports which one you were on.\n\nI can't help you with cruises on the Oriana or the Fairsky but someone else might be able to.\n\nI have made up 3 folders for each cruise with photos, photos of slide dates & newspaper Shipping dates from Sydney and 1972 immigration stats that show the passengers that are disembarking along the way. The 1974 one Bris/Bris is the hardest as we can only track our Sydney shipping and not actually leaving/arriving in Brisbane. The Syd/Syd is 21 days so the Bris/Bris has to be the same. We were told that they are tightening up their acceptance of these older cruises and require more evidence to prove the dates. The Captains Circle rep on Sapphire P gave us some tips and ideas to put in as we had just given up and going with what we had. That is why we are trying to get this together."
