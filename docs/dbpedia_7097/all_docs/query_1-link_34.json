Where the Services are provided by third-party companies, we will use your information to coordinate and facilitate their provision of the Service.\n\nINCIDENTS AND HEALTH SCREENINGS. If, while traveling with us, you suffer a personal injury, fall ill, submit a claim about a personal injury, or are otherwise involved in an incident, we collect your personal identifiers, health or medical information and details about the incident. We may also screen you for symptoms of potential contagions, such as COVID-19, that may present a risk to the other guests and crew members aboard our ships, including through temperature checks, self-assessment questionnaires and tissue sampling. We use this information to attend to your medical and safety needs and those of our guests and crew, maintain records of incidents, facilitate investigations and remedies, to protect our rights and the rights of our guests, for security and public health purposes, to prevent fraud, and to improve our Services.\n\nPHOTO & VIDEO FOOTAGE. We collect a security photo at or before you board our ships. We operate closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras on board our ships, including at all access points and throughout the public areas. These CCTV cameras record continually and images of you may appear in these recordings (\"CCTV images\"). Photographers and camera crews take photographs and make films for guests to purchase at the end of their vacation or for our own promotional use. They are happy to take reasonable steps to avoid filming or photographing you where you indicate to the person with the camera that this is your preference , but we are unable to guarantee that your images will not be included on an incidental basis. We use this information for our own promotional purposes, to maintain records of incidents, facilitate investigations and remedies, to protect our rights and the rights of our guests, for security purposes, to enable public health measures, to prevent fraud, and to improve our Services. We may apply facial recognition technology to your security photo to facilitate camera-enabled rapid embarkation, debarkation, at entry and exit of the vessel at ports of call. We may also use facial recognition to link the pictures and videos taken by onboard photographers or videographers to you for ease of ordering and to reduce paper waste. After sailing, you will still be able to access your linked photos and videos via our connection with a third-party photo library service. We delete facial biometric identifiers promptly following completion of the voyage though we may retain any photos that have been identified and linked to a guest account for up to two (2) years to enable guest access and purchase of photos and photo memorabilia after the end of the voyage.\n\nCASINO.

We may use this information to validate your identity and age, to determine your eligibility for promotions and offers during your vacation and for future travel, to inform our marketing and advertising activities, and to communicate directly with you. In addition, we may use this information to generate win/loss statement, to conduct credit checks, process lines of credit, or otherwise as needed to comply with our legal obligations and to prevent or investigate fraud.

The Medallion® technology is not a global positioning system and cannot detect the precise geolocation (lat/long) of an individual. The Medallion® is linked to your other personal information associated with your registration and traveler profile.

For example, we use this information to locate you during your vacation and enable you to locate other members of your family, to contact you and deliver requested Services to your location (e.g., food delivery), to send you content or messaging relevant to your location and to customize your interactions with our Services. We may also use this information to monitor and protect the health and safety of our guests, including to conduct contact tracing, or investigate wrongful acts or allegations as appropriate. We may also use this information, individually and in aggregate, to develop and improve our Services and to understand the movement patterns and behaviors of guests on our ship. When you make a purchase through the MedallionClass™ Services using your Medallion®, we will process the commercial information you have on file in order to complete your transaction, detect and prevent fraud, and to inform our advertising and marketing.\n\nC.

Information about on-board contacts with crew, guests or other individuals collected via wearable technology such as the Medallion® on MedallionClass™ ships and properties and/or the OceanOrbit™ Contract Tracing system. These devices collect data, such as personal contact, time stamp, duration of contact and frequency of contact with others.\n\nAS REQUIRED BY LAW. Information collected by our on-board crew or reservations staff pursuant to directives by public health organizations or other government agencies.\n\nWe collect and use this information because:\n\nwe must comply with certain regulatory requirements regarding public health, including to determine your fitness to travel consistent with applicable government regulations and guidelines;\n\nwe have a legitimate business interest in ensuring the health and safety of our passengers, crew and the public;\n\nwe have a legitimate business interest in complying with legal and regulatory requirements applicable in the various jurisdictions in which we operate;\n\nwe need to use this information to perform our contract with you to provide our vacation experiences.\n\nContact Tracing through OceanOrbit™ Contract Tracing System. To help mitigate and manage the potential spread of COVID-19 or other global pandemic illnesses, we use wearable device technology to identify individuals who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and to rapidly detect potential secondary cases that may arise after transmission from an infected individual. The OceanOrbit™ device is a wearable portable electronic device that collects data as guests and crew interact with one another in public and in private areas by broadcasting and recording the presence and proximity of other OceanOrbit™ devices. The OceanOrbit™ system collects time stamps, duration of contact and frequency of contacts. The raw data is associated with the device ID number but will be correlated with guest or crew personal information in the event that contract tracing is called for. On MedallionClass™ ships, we may use on board contact data collected in connection with the Medallion®, rather than the OceanOrbit™ system, which will be linked to your personal information in the same manner as all other OCEAN® data. As part of our contract tracing efforts, we take reasonable precautions to respect our Guests’ privacy and confidentiality by communicating contact exposure information in a manner that is not personally identifiable. However, information about you may be disclosed in a manner that could allow the recipient to determine your identity. For example, if we determine that it is necessary to disclose to a guest that she was in contact with an individual who tested positive for COVID-19 for a period of 1-2 hours on a particular date, that guest may be able to ascertain the likely identity of the unnamed individual based on her personal experience.\n\nWe may disclose your personal information, contacts and health information with third parties or individuals to attend to your medical and safety needs and those of our guests and crew; to comply with legal and regulatory requirements; to facilitate public health response initiatives; to conduct contract tracing of individuals who are exposed to or test positive for COVID-19 or other communicable illness while staying with us; or if we reasonably believe that such disclosure is necessary to inform your health care or to protect the personal safety or health of our guests, crew, or other individuals. For example, we may disclose personal identifiers and health or medical information to our personnel and contractors, port agents and authorities, government officials, health agencies or any other individual or institution as reasonably needed to support public health initiatives, comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, attend to your medical and safety needs, facilitate investigations and remedies, track and mitigate risks of communicable illness including COVID-19, and to protect the rights, health and safety of our guests, crew, and others.\n\nCHILDREN’S PRIVACY\n\nThough Carnival Cruise Line provides fun for families of all ages, most of our online Services are not intended to be used by children, nor do we have actual knowledge that children are using these online Services.
