This agreement marks the commencement of the construction of two groundbreaking ships that will redefine high-end travel on the seas.\n\nThe 690-passenger (based on double occupancy), 61,800-gross-ton ships will feature a host of amenities and innovative designs, ensuring unparalleled comfort and indulgence for guests. Prominent architectural firms Studio Ibsen led by Prof. and Architect Adriana Granato and Studio Gem headed by Naval Arch. Giacomo Mortola and Naval Eng. Lorenzo Mortola will be leading the design efforts, along with a third international design firm yet to be appointed.

Culinary enthusiasts will be delighted by a variety of dining options, showcasing a variety of world-class cuisines including Umi Uma, the only Nobu at sea as well as recently announced Beefbar. Additionally, Crystal will continue its legacy of offering exclusive entertainment along with a sophisticated casino that includes an array of gaming options in an elegant setting.\n\nWellness and relaxation will be at the heart of the new ships, with a comprehensive Spa and state-of-the-art fitness center available to all guests. Families traveling with children will appreciate a dedicated area, designed to provide engaging activities and a safe space for younger guests.\n\nThe new ships will feature all-suite accommodations, with private verandas including a popular single occupancy category, with veranda, designed for solo travelers.

These new ships will receive the same level of attention I have reserve to my own house,\" added Cristina Levis, CEO of A&K Travel Group.\n\n\"This order not only highlights the robust recovery of the cruise sector, in line with our Industrial Plan, but also reaffirms Fincantieri's leadership, thanks to the operational excellence of our shipyards and the execution quality of our world-class supply chain,\" stated Pierroberto Folgiero, CEO of Fincantieri. \"We are thrilled to partner with Crystal in our pursuit of innovation and excellence, under the guidance of a shipowner who has always been close to our Group, like Manfredi Lefebvre d'Ovidio.\"\n\nThe expected delivery of the first ship will be in the Spring of 2028. The construction and delivery timeline on the second ship will be announced at a later date.\n\nThe announcement comes two years after A&K Travel Group acquired Crystal in 2022, marking a new chapter for the cruise line. Under A&K Travel Group's leadership, Crystal has been focusing on enhancing its offerings both at sea and on shore and expanding its fleet to provide unparalleled experiences for its guests.\n\nCrystal has also secured the option to build a third sister ship with delivery in 2032.\n\nTo learn more about the new ships, or book any of Crystal's exceptional itineraries, contact your travel advisor, visit crystalcruises.com or call 1-800-446-6620.\n\nAbout Crystal\n\nFor more than three decades Crystal has been synonymous with exceptional, award-winning voyages.
