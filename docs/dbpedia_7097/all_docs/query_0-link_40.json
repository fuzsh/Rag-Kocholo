        "text": "The new ship is built on a platform that is distinctly different and unique to Princess, designed to simultaneously embrace the Princess heritage while celebrating the romance of the sea by offering more dynamic, outward views.\n\nWhile 20 percent larger than any of the line's existing ships, STAR PRINCESS design retains the more intimate settings Princess is known for, with a number of new spaces such as:\n\nThe Dome, a transformational entertainment venue inspired by the terraces of Santorini;\n\nthe next-level Piazza featuring a glass sphere\n\nthe \"see it to believe it\" Princess Arena, a configurable, technologically advanced main theater that allows Princess to produce a variety of entertainment concepts; and\n\na majestic dining room positioned aft of the ship to deliver unforgettable wake views.\n\nThis second Sphere Class ship will also offer a number of features with an array of exciting new food and beverage concepts; an expanded casino; a two-story Lotus Spa; and entertainment headlined by Cirque Ã‰loize.\n\nThe new ship will be the second in the Princess fleet to be powered by LNG fuel technology and also is being built with the most advanced sustainable innovations available.\n\nSTAR PRINCESS debuts 4 August 2025, sailing a nine-day Inaugural Italy & Greece roundtrip voyage from Rome (Civitavecchia), featuring the destinations of Corfu, Kotor, Mykonos, Santorini and Naples (for Capri and Pompeii), followed by a variety of 9- and 10-day cruises sailing from Rome, Athens or Trieste (Venice) that visit idyllic coastal ports.\n\nPrincess' first STAR PRINCESS ship initially launched in 1988 as Sitmar Fair Majesty. With the merger of Sitmar Cruises into Princess, she then entered service as STAR PRINCESS in 1989, and was christened by legendary actress and humanitarian Audrey Hepburn. The second STAR PRINCESS launched in 2002, as the third Grand-Class vessel playing an instrumental role in the evolution of the brand with popular offerings like Anytime Dining, the only dining program in the industry at the time to give guests freedom to dine where, when and with whom they wish."
