The mill was built in 1798 and operated continuously until it burned on January, 14, 1916. Frank Steele, who grew up in the area during the early part of the century, recorded the following recollections of Watt’s Mill. \"In the winter of 1912, my father and I went to Watt’s Mill with 10 bushels of buckwheat and two bushels of corn to get ground. [We had] to go down to the Little Beaver Creek, which we had to ford. The horses did not want to cross as the water was real deep, about two inches from the bottom of the spring wagon. Tom Watt and his brother Jim operated the mill. They also had a sawmill [although] I never saw it in operation. They would not grind buckwheat when the weather was damp, as the buckwheat would not grind well on a damp day. They did not like to change from grinding buckwheat to corn, as they had to operate the mill [empty] a short time to get it cleaned out. Stone grinding wheels were used, turned by a water wheel laid on its side, called a tub wheel. They left the water wheel operate continuously in real cold weather so it would not freeze. In winter there would be pieces of ice come through the water wheel. It would sound like a lot of glass being broken, [or] a bunch of rocks in the wheel. The door of the mill was higher than the wagons, [so] they had a plank to leave down to the bottom of the wagon. You would fasten a rope around two or three sacks of grain and they would pull the sacks up the plank to the mill floor. The rope was fastened to a revolving shaft operated by the water wheel. The Watts Brothers would take part of the flour as toll. I believe it was one eighth. They would rather have flour than cash, as there was a great demand for the flour. Mr. Jim Watt told us about being to the Klondyke (sic) gold rush in Alaska [and] showed us the gold watch and chain made from the gold he had panned. He smoked a corn cob pipe [and] would reach in one chute where the buckwheat hulls came down from the screen and filled his pipe with hulls and smoked it. It did not smell very good to me. In 1915, Frosty Cook and I would take 15 bushels of buckwheat and two bushels of corn in the sled and we had to leave it because there was so many grists ahead of us. We would go back in a week taking 15 bushels more. That year my father raised 120 bushels [of buckwheat]. He sold the flour in Beaver Falls at the Grand Hotel [and] also at a lot of restaurants. We would have buckwheat cakes every breakfast and mush fried every weekend.\" DATE\n\nUnknownCATEGORY\n\nAgricultureKEYWORDS\n\nSouth Beaver Twp.\n\nmill\n\nbridge\n\nLittle Beaver CreekSOURCE LOCATION\n\nLBHS Facebook page\n\nORIGINAL SOURCE\n\nOriginal source not documented\n\nView This Image\n\nACCESSION: LBHS-2022-A-0009TITLE\n\nCAPTION\n\nWatt’s Mill in South Beaver Township, Beaver County, Pennsylvania.

I had just laid down to catch a couple hours of sleep before going out to work night turn. Within 15 minutes I was awoken by the sounds of ten train engines . i jumped up knowing what it was immediately and ran through the house telling my mom and sister to run to the basement . As I looked out the window and saw the tornado on the hill of Grandview and watched it spin its way down the hill to destroy the plaza as this photo of Jamesway shows..

Darlington brought in a well at the lower edge of Glasgow. This well was bottomed at 585 feet and produced oil up through the 1880's. With the completion of each successful well in the Smith's Ferry Field, oil speculation and excitement became more intense. During the period from 1860-1875 it was generally established that the Smith's Ferry oil reserves could be found 700-730 feet below feet below the Kittanning Coal or approximately 600 feet below the bed of the Ohio River. Although many wells were drilled in this area, none ever exceeded twenty five barrels per day until a fifty barrel well was completed in March of 1877 near Ohioville. One of the most shallow and short-lived wells drilled at Smith's Ferry was the \"Good Intent\" which was completed in February of 1891 by the Excelsior Co. It was completed at a depth of only 72 feet and the total production of this well was a mere 400 barrels before it was abandoned.\"DATE\n\n1863CATEGORY\n\nMining & IndustryKEYWORDS\n\noil drilling\n\nOhio River\n\nSmith's Ferry\n\nWollover OilSOURCE LOCATION\n\nLBHS Facebook page\n\nORIGINAL SOURCE\n\nOriginal source not documented\n\nView Larger Image\n\nACCESSION: LBHS-2022-M-0014TITLE\n\nMap of Darlington Brick and Mining operations\n\nCAPTION\n\nMap of Darlington Brick and Mining operations, Darlington, Pa.

Local historian Michael Kishbucher: \"This photo, dated 1908, is called \"The Last Outing.\" It includes two of the three original Robin Hood Club founding members, Ira F. Mansfield and Henry K. Morse (a relative). The third man's name is Donnelly. Ira wrote that in the following spring Morse and Donnelly \"were called to another world,\" leaving Ira and Cecil Hines as the remaining members of the men's version of the club. Ira transformed the group into a women's organization, promoting natural science and especially the women's suffrage movement. The first iteration of the Robin Hood club lasted from October 1865 (a few months after Ira returned from the War) to the spring of 1909. The Second Robin Hood club likely ended in June 1919, probably due to the passing of its benefactor. Ira's obituary says that he died in June 1919 following a brief illness. There is no mention of what disease he succumb to, but he died during the great Spanish Flu pandemic. The US ratified the 19th Amendment the following year.
