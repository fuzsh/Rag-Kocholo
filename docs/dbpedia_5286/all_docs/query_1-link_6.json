        "text": "In 1764, the 1st Earl of Mansfield commissioned Robert Adam to remodel Kenwood House. Many items of furniture from this period were made for specific rooms by leading London makers. Although a four-day sale in 1922 dispersed the majority of these furnishings, some of the original items have now been traced and returned to the house.\n\nThe internationally renowned collection of paintings has grown from an initial gift of 63 works. These were bequeathed in 1928 by Edward Cecil Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh, to evoke the atmosphere of an 18th-century gentleman's house.\n\nBelow is a selection of just some of the objects and artworks that can be found at Kenwood today."
