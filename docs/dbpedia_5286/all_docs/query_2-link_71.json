        "text": "Le Diner en Blanc Philadelphia is a longstanding tradition in the city, and whether or not you’ve attended yourself, you’ve likely seen pictures of the white-clad caravan of people making their way to a different location every year with their dinner gear in tow.\n\nBut what exactly does this community-driven dining experience entail?\n\n“It’s people from all walks of life, different neighborhoods and different professions [enjoying] the act of sitting down and eating,” says Natanya DiBona, co-host of DEB PHL. “That sharing of meals and enjoying this unique experience, it seems to really bond people.”\n\nLe Diner en Blanc Philadelphia began in 2012, but it’s based off of a 1988 tradition started in Paris.\n\n“It was started by a French man who was returning to the country after being away and wanted to gather some friends in Paris,” says DiBona. “He told everyone to wear white so they could identify each other…that’s how that started and it’s a tradition that still continues to this day. The founder’s son brought it to Montreal, and then in 2011, it came to the United States for the first time.”\n\nIt’s not just the white uniform of the evening that makes the experience enticing to people. The dinner in Paris is invite-only, you can’t buy tickets at the door or online by googling the event. You have to know someone in a way to participate. But it’s not exactly a guarded application process here in Philly.\n\n“The exclusivity that existed in Paris is that they don’t have any registration process. It’s just friends inviting friends, and that’s how it grows. But that’s also kind of how it stays exclusive. Here in the States and through that international organization, there’s a registration process,” DiBona continues.\n\n“They just did a switch on their website this year, but prior to that, there was a waiting list. So you signed up on the waiting list and everyone on that waiting list received an invitation. We’re not picking and choosing, it’s not selective, it’s just a matter of how you can register in time to get those spots. Just like any concert tickets or any other event.”\n\nSpots do come out in phases based on past years’ participation, and with sponsorships by people, which DiBona says is sort of like “pre-sale.” But everyone on the waiting list does get an invite, there is just a limited amount of spots.\n\nLe Diner en Blanc Philadelphia, like all of its sister experiences around the world, also changes location every year. In 2012, the tradition started on Logan Circle. It was chosen because of its location on the Parkway (“the Parkway is the Champs-Élysées of America”) and because Logan Circle itself is based on Place de la Concorde, plus the library and the family court building are replicas of buildings in Paris.\n\n“That for us was the most important first location, and it’s the only one we’ve ever repeated—we did it for our 10th anniversary. [That year] we went all the way around the circle with over 5,000 people when the first event was 1300 people. We really just wanted to show the growth,” DiBona explains.\n\nLe Diner en Blanc Philadelphia has also taken place on the steps of the Art Museum, on Broad Street in conjunction with the 20th anniversary of Avenue of the Arts, on the JFK bridge and other scenic spots around the city. Participants find out where each location will be from a meeting point shortly before the event starts.\n\n“A lot goes into it. We always want to show off the city in the best possible light and get people to think differently about public space,” DiBono says. “We try and surprise people and mix it up, and the fact that it does change every year I think is an interesting element that keeps people coming back.”\n\nFor the most part, participants bring their own food, drinks and set-ups for Le Diner en Blanc Philadelphia. But there is a way to keep it all organized, especially for first-timers.\n\n“The great thing about the way it’s organized is when you register, you pick a table leader, and that table leader guides you throughout the process in the month in between registration and when the event happens. They’ll share tips and tricks,” says DiBona. “My advice is pack light. There’s a lot that you want to bring and nice centerpieces, and we certainly encourage that and we have contests and appreciate that. But I think the first time when maybe you’re not sure what you’re doing, maybe it’s better to pack light and get the lay of the land.”\n\nParticipants can also opt for catering through Feast Your Eyes, but for the most part, DiBona says it’s easy set-up and break downs, which then leads to the best part of the evening—just being with the community.\n\n“Often people will share food and have created such friendships over the years,” finishes DiBona. “Everyone does their piece, but then after the dinner, it’s a great party. We have bands and DJs and roaming musicians and all sorts of different interactive activities. It’s really a fun full evening from start to finish.”"
