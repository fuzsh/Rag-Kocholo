        "text": "ASHLAND — Near the end of the iconic film “The Shawshank Redemption,” Andy Dufresne pays a visit to the Maine National Bank. He hands an ID to a teller, who then cuts him a check.\n\nClaire Slemmer, who played the teller in the film, will return to the “Maine National Bank” this weekend — in downtown Ashland.\n\nThe location for “Maine National Bank” in the film was Ashland’s Crosby Advisory Group, located at 19 West Main St.\n\nThis weekend, Aug. 9 to 11, the Crosby Advisory Group will be one of many locations in the area open to visitors coming to celebrate 30 years of Shawshank. The motion picture was filmed at the Ohio State Reformatory and other locations across Ashland, Mansfield and north central Ohio.\n\nSeveral actors from the film, as well as director Frank Darabont, have been invited back to the area to celebrate the milestone. The Shawshank Trail also has posted a list of area events, including some in Ashland.\n\nAshland Main Street is one of the local organizations helping with the 30th reunion festivities. Its executive director, Sandra Tunnell, said people like Slemmer who’ve been in the film have been great about coming back.\n\nShe added it’s cool to watch a movie like “The Shawshank Redemption” and recognize where some of the scenes took place.\n\n“There’s people who come from all over the world to be here and see these movie spots,” Tunnell said.\n\nLocal ‘Shawshank’ events\n\nIn Ashland, Slemmer will appear to sign autographs at the Crosby Advisory Group Friday afternoon from 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. She’ll also be there Saturday from 11 a.m. to noon.\n\nAshland has a second stop on the Shawshank Trail, too. The bus stop from the film is located outside Ashland’s old thrift shop at 345 Orange St.\n\nAccording to an Ashland Main Street Facebook event page, both filming locations will have photo opportunities this weekend.\n\nAshland Main Street also has a scavenger hunt and shop hop planned in honor of the 30th anniversary. The Facebook event page states attendees should pick up a shop card.\n\nIf they visit three downtown shops, the two movie sites and a downtown restaurant, then they’ll receive a voucher for $8 off at Chip Off the Olde Guac. The Mexican food truck will be parked at Farm & Home Hardware.\n\nThe Ashland Theatre will also show “Shawshank Redemption” for free on Saturday, starting at noon.\n\nT-shirts for the 30th anniversary will also be for sale at the Ashland Area Chamber of Commerce this week while supplies last, according to chamber president Amy Daubenspeck."
