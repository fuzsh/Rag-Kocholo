        "text": "Susi Gillespie\n\nPartner & Head of Family DR\n\nSusi Gillespie is Head of Family Dispute Resolution, which unites the firm’s mediation, collaborative law and, soon to be introduced, one couple one lawyer service and offers clients innovative solutions to resolve family disputes outside of court.\n\nSusi Gillespie is a results driven family lawyer with more than 17 years’ experience family law. She joined Thomas Mansfield’s Tunbridge Wells office in late 2017 to set up the firm’s family team and she successfully grew the team from initially just her to a large team spread across several offices.\n\nThe 2022 edition of The Legal 500 recognised Thomas Mansfield’s family team’s “strong presence in the South East/Kent and clearly established reputation for providing excellent representation and client care whilst also keeping fee levels/structures transparent and at a reasonable and realistic level.” Susi has been recognised in previous editions of Chambers and Partners for her “enthusiasm and straightforward attitude”.\n\nSusi is qualified Resolution Accredited Specialist in the areas of complex financial remedies and cohabitation (unmarried) disputes. Resolution is the largest membership organisation for family justice professionals in England and Wales and the Specialist Accreditation Scheme recognises members who demonstrate excellence in the practice of family law and in their specific areas of expertise.\n\nSusi is also a Law Society Accredited Mediator and a Collaborative Lawyer which means that she can offer her clients an alternative method of dispute resolution from the traditional adversarial approach. Mediation is a cost effective and family focused way of assisting couples to end their relationship and plan for their family’s future. Collaborative law provides a means of achieving family led solutions in a non-confrontational way by agreement and discussion in client/lawyer meetings with the aim of avoiding court proceedings.\n\nExperience and recent work\n\nSusi’s experience and expertise lies in the resolution of financial disputes between married and unmarried couples and on children matters. Susi’s preference is to resolve these disputes in either a mediation or collaborative setting.\n\nIn so far as financial matters are concerned, Susi is fully aware that the worry associated with the financial division can be more stressful than the separation itself. Susi will assist in achieving a fair division of the matrimonial home and assets through a process of firm and fair negotiation on her clients’ behalf.\n\nWhen it comes to children matters, Susi advises on issues relating to the arrangements for where children will live and how often they will spend time with their other parent post separation, as well as removal from jurisdiction cases. Susi understands that when couples are separating from each other, both parties will continue to be parents to their children. Susi actively assists parents to focus on their children’s well-being; whether this is through negotiation, collaboration, mediation or through the Court process.\n\nSusi also regularly advises clients in respect of pre and post marital agreements as well as cohabitation or ‘living together’ agreements.\n\nMemberships and accreditations\n\nLaw Society\n\nResolution\n\nKent Resolution Committee Member\n\nResolution Cohabitation Committee\n\nFamily Mediation Council\n\nClient testimonials\n\nFantastic service, fast response. Would recommend TM to anybody looking for legal assistance.\n\nClient, UK\n\nIn my dealing with Susi, I have found her knowledgeable professional and very client driven in her dealings with me. In particular, Susi has explained complex legal matters outlining the pros and cons of a situation in a way that has been easy for me to understand.\n\nClient, UK\n\nSusi was great and helped me navigate an arduous and painful process.\n\nClient, UK\n\nReshma was available to listen at a time when I needed the reassurance. From our initial chats her expertise and confidence were enough to put my mind at rest.\n\nClient, UK\n\nTheir responses are always prompt and the team is attentive.\n\nClient, UK\n\nThomas Mansfield Solicitors ‘has expertise and great strength in all areas of family law’, with ‘solicitors of outstanding ability at a range of fee levels to meet the client’s circumstances.’\n\nLegal 500, 2023\n\nSimplicity, listening and professionalism! At a very stressful time (involving French and UK laws) the whole process was made clear, helpful and concise.\n\nClient, UK & France\n\nTM Family Law have given great advice, clear explanations and been very thorough and professional in their work.\n\nClient, UK\n\nKate was very helpful and amazing throughout. Very attentive and patient with explaining things in simpler format, to enable better reasoning behind the entire process...\n\nClient, UK\n\nSusi was 100% on my team from start to finish. Extremely professional and highly recommended.\n\nClient, UK\n\nI would recommend, and indeed have recommended, Susi to my friends, confident in the belief that she would provide the same excellent service to them, as she has provided for me.\n\nClient, UK\n\nThe team have been amazing, explained everything along the way and gave me great advice with my international divorce.\n\nClient, France\n\nSusi during our first meeting was super kind, listened intently and offered very professional and informative advice.\n\nClient, UK\n\nReshma was highly recommended to me by a friend. She has great knowledge and was able to answer all my questions in a way that didn’t feel overwhelming despite their sensitive nature... I felt empowered and have a far greater idea of what to expect going forward and how we will achieve the best outcome.\n\nClient, UK\n\nThe customer service was reliable, efficient and friendly. The legal advice received was good, and reflected in court. The lead on the case was available for phone calls, and easily contactable... Although a lengthy procedure, a final fair and successful result.\n\nClient, UK\n\nMy experience of dealing with individuals at the firm is that they demonstrate a great amount of empathy, care and tact at dealing with tricky family law issues. Susi Gillespie in particular continually demonstrates a firm, yet sensitive approach, which is gratefully appreciated.\n\nClient, UK\n\nReshma was amazing with my initial consulting. She broke down the step by step process which I needed to take to move forward in my situation. I would definitely highly recommend.\n\nClient, UK\n\nFrom the minute I walked through the door I was greeted with a warm welcome. This helped put me at ease during a meeting that potentially was very daunting and difficult. Susi was kind, listened intently and offered very professional and informative advice.\n\nClient, UK\n\nThomas Mansfield has an exceptional and highly collaborative team. Whenever my key point of contact has been away, issues are quickly picked up and dealt with by other members of the team, all of whom appear to have a great, collective and collaborative understanding of their clients’ issues.\n\nClient, UK\n\nhttps://www.tmfamilylaw.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/susi-gillespie-websize.jpg 1068 1600 Neill Thomas https://www.tmfamilylaw.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/new-logo.png Neill Thomas2019-01-03 10:51:352024-07-26 16:53:26Susi Gillespie"
