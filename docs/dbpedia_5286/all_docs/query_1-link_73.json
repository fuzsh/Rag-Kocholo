        "text": "Multi-instrumentalist David Mansfield has been traveling, traveling and doing more traveling, playing music and recording with famous musicians since the age of 16. Some of his best travel memories are playing in Bob Dylan’s band in Tokyo in 1978, and he can relive them today when Dylan releases two of the Tokyo shows in an expanded four-CD box set, The Complete Budokan 1978.\n\nIt was the first time Dylan and Mansfield, who plays violin, mandolin and dobro on the album, visited Japan, and each was captivated by the country and its people. Dylan, Mansfield says, was in a good mood throughout the tour and pleased with the band’s musicianship.\n\n“It was my first trip, and there was plenty to learn,” recalls Mansfield, who also recorded three albums with Dylan, was part of Dylan’s earlier Rolling Thunder Revue tour and is an award-winning film and television composer. “For one, many people spoke English as a second language. I was struck that Tokyo in 1978 was even more bustling than New York City. I learned that audiences in Japan at that time were more like U.S. classical audiences — thunderous applause was encouraged but shouting, standing or making any kind of noise during a performance was not.”\n\nMansfield initially performed three concerts with Dylan at Tokyo’s Nippon Budokan arena, which was built for judo competition at the 1964 Summer Olympics and established a musical tradition when the Beatles played there in 1966. The indoor arena has an octagonal shape and a roof resembling a roof on a Japanese temple. Budokan seats nearly 15,000 people and is located in Kitanomaru Park, which is also home to the Science Museum and the National Museum of Modern Art.\n\nMansfield then traveled with Dylan to Osaka and played three shows there, before returning to Budokan for five more shows. The new box set includes 36 previously unreleased songs and the complete Budokan concerts of February 28 and March 1.\n\nDuring his trip with Dylan, Mansfield says he also learned that Japanese people “were socially compelled to be helpful at all costs.” If a Japanese person was asked directions and the directions weren’t known, the person “would just make some up, so as not to disappoint,” he recalls.\n\nMansfield, who has played on numerous well-known musicians’ albums and was a member of the Alpha Band and Quacky Duck and His Barnyard Friends, recommends first-time travelers to Japan visit Kyoto and its Buddhist shrines.\n\n“Kinkakuji, the golden temple, is a must, and the Zen rock garden is the most peaceful place I’ve ever been,” he says.\n\nThe temple, according to worldhistory.org, was first built in 1397 as the retirement residence of shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu and converted to a Buddhist temple after his death. It is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nThe rock garden is a mile away at the Ryoanji Temple, and it was visited by Dylan during the 1978 tour. In The Complete Budokan 1978 box set, Dylan writes of his love for Japan and the garden.\n\n“The more I think about it, the more I realize what I left behind in Japan — my soul, my music and that sweet girl in the geisha house. I wonder does she remember me? If the people of Japan wish to know about me, they can hear this record — also they can hear my heart still beating in Kyoto at the Zen rock garden. Someday I will be back to reclaim it.”\n\nIn 2015, Mansfield returned to Japan in Bobby McFerrin’s band and, in Tokyo, played violin, mandolin, lap steel and National resonator guitar.\n\n“I played the Blue Note with Bobby McFerrin, and it’s a fantastic club to play or listen to music,” Mansfield says. “They treated us like a combination of royalty and close family. As we walked off stage, we were greeted with hot towels, and the kitchen catered to our every need.”\n\nMansfield says he noticed differences in 2015 Tokyo versus 1978 Tokyo.\n\n“One fascinating thing that had changed over the years was young people and fashion,” he says about his 2015 visit. “I routinely saw 20-somethings wearing outfits that you would only see on a runway in the U.S.”\n\nAdditionally, “I had some of the best street food in the world,” he says. “I was walking around Tokyo one day and saw a long line for a little hole-in-the-wall fast-food shop, so I thought I’d give it a try. It turned out to be takoyaki (a ball-shaped soft dumpling often filled with minced octopus) and may be the tastiest thing I’ve ever eaten.”\n\nTasty food also abounds in West Orange, a New Jersey township where Mansfield currently resides that’s about a 22-mile drive from Manhattan. According to theculturetrip.com, “West Orange’s diverse dining scene offers local foodies everything from casual barbecue to fine New American dining with New York City skyline views.”\n\n“I grew up in suburban New Jersey and live there now, albeit in a different county,” says Mansfield, who grew up in Leonia (about two miles west of the George Washington Bridge, which crosses into Manhattan). “I didn’t love it growing up but changed my tune when we moved to Maplewood (New Jersey) to raise our family. It was like a cross between Mayberry R.F.D. and San Francisco.”\n\nMaplewood, located about seven miles south of West Orange, has the best artisanal wood-fired pizza in the New York City tri-state region, Mansfield says. He recommends Artie’s, a bakery, cafe and pizza joint, and warns that “you have to line up before it opens.”\n\n“When I was a kid,” he adds, “it was greasy burgers, hot dogs and fries on Palisades Avenue. My favorite joint was called Hiram’s (located near Leonia in Fort Lee), but my friend Tony Bourdain preferred Callahan’s, across the street.”\n\nThe late chef and TV celebrity, who spent much of his childhood in Leonia, also had a sweet spot, though, for Hiram’s Roadstand, which is known for its deep-fried hotdogs. Bourdain included Hiram’s in a 2015 episode of his CNN series Parts Unknown, and the restaurant has a small memorial to him outside.\n\nAnother memorial for an even bigger celebrity — Thomas Edison — stands in Mansfield’s current hometown. Thomas Edison National Historical Park in West Orange includes a 29-room house and 13 1/2 acres of land that the renowned inventor bought in the 1880s, as well as a large laboratory he built.\n\nMansfield, who produced the soundtrack albums for various films, including Heaven's Gate, Year of the Dragon and The Sicilian, remembers his visits to the historic site. Behind the laboratory, Edison built the Black Maria — the world’s first film production studio — and the National Park Service maintains a 1954 reproduction.\n\n“I have been to the Edison site — first as a kid on a class trip to the Black Maria film studio,” Mansfield says. “Then I went there with Marshall Crenshaw for a series they had there for a while. Contemporary singer-songwriters would play a live show and be recorded onto an Edison cylinder, which they would then archive in the museum. Very cool!”\n\nWhen he isn’t on the road or working on a musical project, Mansfield says his favorite place to vacation or relax is probably Donostia-San Sebastián in Spain’s Basque country. It’s a fashionable seaside resort city in north-central Spain near the French border at the mouth of the Urumea River and next to the Bay of Biscay.\n\nMansfield’s affection for the city was also influenced by his stay at the historic, riverside Hotel Maria Cristina, which opened in 1912 and has river and sea views.\n\n“It is drop-dead gorgeous,” Mansfield says. “It also didn’t hurt that I rode down in the elevator one day with Chick Corea, Stanley Clarke and Bobby McFerrin, and Bobby told Chick what a wonderful musician I was.”\n\nDonostia-San Sebastián is also the home of Kursaal, a complex with an auditorium and exhibition halls that serves as the city’s cultural center. Kursaal, according to Lonely Planet travel guidebooks, “is one of the city's most striking buildings, consisting of two cubes made of translucent glass with LED lights.”\n\nThe acoustics inside are “amazing,” says Todd Kennedy, a professor of English and film at Louisiana’s Nicholls State University, who attended two Dylan concerts there in June.\n\n“Basque culture has its own folk traditions, and Basques have long been obsessed with Dylan,” says Kennedy, who lives in New Orleans and has summered in Donostia-San Sebastián since 2016. “Donostia-San Sebastián is the New Orleans of Europe — a city driven by food, architecture and music. Local celeb Fermin Muguruza, the author of Black is Beltza, was in attendance (at the June 19 Dylan show), as well as several major local chefs.”\n\nChefs in Donostia-San Sebastián are celebrities, and local tourism officials say their restaurants have more Michelin stars per square meter than restaurants in any other city.\n\nMansfield recommends Michelin-starred Arzak, a restaurant renowned for avant-garde cuisine rooted in traditional Basque cooking. It currently offers a tasting menu for 270 Euros (about $289) per person.\n\n“Bobby McFerrin and a few others went to Arzak,” recalls Mansfield, who played with McFerrin at the Heineken Jazzaldia in 2014. “He was friends with the chef. I passed, because it was too expensive for me, but I heard all about it. By all accounts, it is one of the most amazing restaurants in the world!”\n\nMansfield points out another tasty, much less expensive dining option in Donostia-San Sebastián. Locals and visitors love to stroll to the old town’s many bars and order savory, often colorful, snacks called pintxos.\n\n“Do a pintxos crawl — the Basque equivalent of Spanish tapas,” Mansfield says enthusiastically. “It is a unique, incredible food experience not to be missed. And the local rosé wine, which was very cheap, and, I was told, akin to beer in the U.S., was as good as anything I’ve ever had.”"
