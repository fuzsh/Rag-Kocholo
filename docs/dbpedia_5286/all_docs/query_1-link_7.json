        "text": "\"A democratic place should be an ORGASMIC YES!\" It remains reassuringly true that there are some things Americans can get away with saying that I simply can't, however much I'd like to ðŸ¤£ On a serious note, though, this ~15 minute conversation is just incredible throughout, from Baratunde Thurston's four pillars of \"citizen as a verb\" to adrienne maree brown's concept of fractals, from the importance of drawing inspiration from the places where people have long been fighting for democracy to the essential work of letting the old democracy die as we imagine and embrace the new... If I have a favourite moment though, it's at around 12 minutes, when they discuss a very fresh idea of leadership - neither as command or service, but as facilitation... AMB leads off, saying: \"Facilitation is the way you care for a group... I would rather elect facilitators-in-chief. I would rather have facilitators running every town. I'm tired of pontification. I want people who care, and know how to hold people with care.\" Baratunde responds: \"There's a mathematical obviousness to the fact that our problems are too big for one leader to solve. We need all of our talents, all of our experiences, all of our failures to be brought to bear on our failures and our opportunities. We need facilitation to unlock this greater strength that we have only together.\" A huge YES to that. If I weren't quite so British, it might even be orgasmic... ðŸ˜³ https://lnkd.in/ekVKkVwG"
