        "text": "We are thrilled to announce that applications are open for the Bio-Leadership Fellowship in 2025! The Bio-Leadership Fellowship is a global movement of people and projects working towards better forms of human progress by working with nature. More than a programme, we are growing as an extraordinary human ‘mycelium’ — a community of learning to support nature-centred innovations and collaborations across the world. We are now 150 Fellows strong from 29 countries working across most business sectors. We're looking for our next 50 Fellows to join this brilliant community in 2025! Learn more and download the Fellowship brochure on our website >> https://lnkd.in/duWb-Tr #bioleadership #mycelium #earthcentred\n\n💥 We urgently need to change our narrative on how we see the relationship between humans & nature Often, when I go to conferences or keynotes, speakers basically tell us: humans are #parasites First and for all, this is not true, and even if it were true (in some cases, it is), there is nothing as wrong as reinforcing a self-fulfilling prophecy I see a lot of teenagers who are concerned with the climate who're literally anxious to get out of their rooms, feeling the fear of doing something wrong ✊️ Please wake up, people, this is not how we will solve any problem, au contraire. If you want to learn from history, you see #guilt has never worked. It only made situations more screwed up. 👉🏽 Nature can go to 75%, humans can go to 75%, and together we can go to 100%, or even 1000%, because in the end, we are part of nature By combining nature's power and human ingenuity, we can achieve great things, and the first thing to look at is agriculture Last year in the Amazon rainforest, I saw a beautiful example of how more trees per hectare & more biodiversity were achieved, all while producing food. Let's finally change our narrative from fighting against nature to working together. The Amazon rainforest, a 12,000-year-old man-made food forest, is a perfect example of how this is possible. 🙏 Thanks, Diana Myers, for sharing this image #regenerative #landscapedesign #landscapearchitecture #agroecology #regenerativefarming #agroforestry #farming #tuin #tuinarchitectuur #permacultuur #permaculture #voedselbos\n\n💥 Breaking news: trees do not only capture CO2 but also methane! 👉🏽 A greenhouse gas that is a product of agriculture and the burning of fossil fuels, 28 times more potent than CO2? Methane has been responsible for about 30% of global heating since preindustrial times, with emissions rising at their fastest rate since the 1980s. 🦠 Microbes in the bark of trees play a vital role in removing methane from the atmosphere, scientists have discovered. Methane absorption levels were the highest in tropical forests, probably thanks to the microbes’ ability to thrive in warm and wet conditions. 🥑 We need more trees! On agricultural land, we can plant millions of trees that not only balance the climate and help nature but also provide food and a healthy regenerative income for farmers. 💦 Oh yeah, in case you didn't know, trees also help to balance water vapour, which is actually the most significant greenhouse gas of all. #regenerative #landscapedesign #landscapearchitecture #agroecology #regenerativefarming #agroforestry #farming #tuin #tuinarchitectuur #permaculture #voedselbos #nature #eatmoretrees"
