        "text": "Biographical Note\n\nNathaniel Rue Ewan of Moorestown, New Jersey, was born 28 April 1870 in the Ewan family ancestral home at Ewansville, Burlington Co. His parents were Charles Ewan Jr., a cider and vinegar manufacturer, and Mary A. Wilkins. In 1894, N. R. Ewan married Ella L. Thomas of Camden. By that time, he had taken up his father's cider and vinegar business, which occupation he carried on until his retirement in 1936. Ewan was also associated, during the course of his career, with three independent telephone companies and served as president of the Vincentown & Tabernacle Telephone Company for sixteen years. He was a member of the Southampton Board of Education for several terms, and was also president of the Associated School Board of Burlington County for two terms.\n\nEwan possessed a great interest in the history of New Jersey and particularly the history of Burlington County. Accordingly, for four years he worked for the Library of Congress on the Historic American Building Survey. Ewan was a principal participant of the Survey in Burlington County, and personally located and photographed scores of private and public historic structures. In his retirement, Ewan served as president of the Burlington County Historical Society as well as curator and treasurer of the Camden County Historical Society. He was also appointed by Governor Edison in November 1943 as a member of the New Jersey Historic Sites Commission.\n\nN. R. Ewan died 10 January 1961 at the Masonic Home in Burlington Township, aged 90 years.\n\nBibliography\n\nThe Story of New Jersey, Volume V. (New York, NY: Lewis Historical Publishing Co., 1945). \"Nathaniel R. Ewan,\" pp. 1045-1046.\n\nContent Note\n\nThis series contains 110 photographs taken by N. R. Ewan during the 1930s showing pre-1800 private homes and outbuildings in Burlington County. The photographs were presented to the New Jersey State Library in 1939 as a two-part album. For each view, Ewan provided a detailed caption summarizing the known history of the structure. For the purposes of preservation, the photographs have been removed from the original (highly acidic) album pages and placed in plastic sleeves. In addition, the captions have been photocopied onto acid-free bond paper and placed within the sleeves, behind the corresponding photographs.\n\nAs mentioned above, Ewan served as a photographer for the Historic American Building Survey (HABS) in Burlington County. Consequently, similar--but not identical--views of many of the structures included here can be found among the HABS documentation photographs. Ewan's 1939 album, nevertheless, seems to include only prints from his private collection, not copies of HABS photographs. In the latter, New Jersey site number signs can be seen in exterior views.\n\nIt should be noted that Ewan had previously donated (by 1935) similar albums to the Burlington County Historical Society, the Burlington County Library at Mount Holly, and the Moorestown Library. This was reported in a Mount Holly Herald article that year which also contained the complete list of 107 captions. (Copies of this article and another by Ewan entitled \"How Old is Your House?\" are included with this series as the first items in the box). Ewan added three views in the 1939 album, and also revised several of the 1935 captions. Also, inserted in the album (between site nos. 107 and 108) was a 1949 photograph of a log house on Burlington Road which was demolished that year. This item might have been a later addition by the donor.\n\nFinally, Ewan also included his donation to the State Library a copy of a Burlington County map on which he marked the approximate locations of each structure photographed. The key map is stored unfolded and rolled.\n\nContents (click on image below for enlarged view)\n\nNOTE: Included below are basic descriptions of the structures photographed by Ewan using his 1939 captions, the 1935 Mount Holly Herald article, and the key map. The accuracy of the descriptions has not been verified. Place name and surname indexes have been added following the Contents list to aid researchers."
