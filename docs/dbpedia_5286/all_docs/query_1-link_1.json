        "text": "OK, [deep breath] here goes.... I'm bringing something new (and a little vulnerable) into the world. It's an open-source sharing of the body of work I've developed over close to 25 years around #thrivability, living systems principles, stewardship and #regeneration across multiple sectors and around the world. It's called Thrivable World ‚Äì a reflection of what it aims to help bring into being. As I say on the website: \"The practice of thrivability shows up in many different contexts. Explicitly enabling life to thrive is at the heart of regenerative approaches to agriculture, tourism, and leadership of organizations. The patterns of living systems shine through in the design of living buildings and the shaping of a vibrant democracy. Education and healthcare call out for deepening alignment with life, in every way. At the crossroads of all those contexts, we find life‚Äôs universal design principles and the informed intention and practice of enabling life to thrive. Like a clearing in the woods, this is where our varied paths come together and we can gather around a warming fire of shared practice, learning and community.\" This is Version 1.0. There's more to come, including more stories, more tools and resources, more ways to engage, and (importantly) more contributors. There's even talk of a physical kit. ü§ì But for now, this is a start, and a first opportunity for feedback and conversation. üåø My intention is that this will serve the shift humanity is trying to make, towards a world that works for all life. My hope is that it will allow others to contribute and evolve the work more directly (already, the influences are innumerable) so it ultimately takes on a life of its own. And my dream is that it will grow fully into \"a practitioner community, a learning ecology and an action research collective dedicated to cultivating organizations, projects and communities as vital practice grounds for a more thrivable world.\" üôè I would be grateful to know what speaks to you and excites you; what you'd love to see more of; where you have questions. And most of all, I'd love to know: who's in? _____ üòç I'm deeply grateful to more people than LinkedIn will let me name. For now, I'll call out Masha Mazi for magic design skills, a brilliant strategic mind, and such a big heart. And Nathalia Del Moral Fleury, thank you for jumping in with such faith in life; it's an absolute delight to work with you. Just a few others who have shaped this work ‚Äì and me: Laura Storm | Dorothe Liebig | Din van Helden | Belina Raffy | AJ Javier | Julie Bourbonnais | Lana Kristine Jelenjev | Duncan Ebata | Dr. Monica Boos | Anna-Marie Swan | Debbie Clarke | Josie Major | Marianne Schapmans | Julian A Giacomelli | Reidun Westvik Lauritzen | Ben Wolfe | Cameron Stiff | Anna Pollock | Stelio Verzera | Celes Davar | Bruce Anderson | Jeff Miller, PhD | B. Lorraine Smith and so many more. Follow Thrivable World here on LinkedIn. And visit the website below."
