        "text": "About Us:\n\nMission Statement:The mission of the Assessor's Office is to value real and personal property efficiently, fairly and accurately, in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts fair cash value; to administer motor vehicle excise program, process exemptions, and abatement programs; and to address concerns of members of the public efficiently and accurately.\n\nWhat do the Town's Assessors do?\n\nThe Assessors' Office is responsible for the administration of all laws and regulations regarding real property assessment and valuation. The Assessors, as required by Chapters 59, 60A, 61, 61A, 61B, 121A of the Massachusetts General Laws and various Acts of the Legislature, perform the valuation of approximately 7,200 parcels of property. This includes residential, commercial, industrial, utilities, and personal property. The Assessors process approximately 21,000 excise tax bills on motor vehicles each year. The Assessors establish the assessed value of property each fiscal year and conduct hundreds of inspections to track value changes. The office is also responsible in tracking property sales and parcel changes to adjust mapping annually. In addition, the office is required to set annual tax rates for all classes of property each year.\n\nContact Us:\n\nContacts:\n\nThomas Welch, MAA Chief Assessor\n\n[email protected]\n\n-------------------------------\n\nAlma Uglialoro Assistant Assessor\n\n[email protected]\n\n--------------------------------\n\nMiriah Gilbert Assistant Assessor\n\nmgilbert@foxboroughma.gov\n\nAddress:\n\nBoard of Assessors 40 South Street\n\nFoxborough, MA 02035\n\nPhone:\n\n(508) 543-1215\n\nFax:\n\nHours:\n\n(508) 543-6278\n\nM-W-TH: 830-4PM, Tuesday-830-7PM, Friday- 830-1230PM\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nREAL ESTATE PERSONAL EXEMPTIONS applications (fy2025)\n\nReal estate exemption applications for both senior and veterans AND OTHERS are available NOW AND WILL BE ACCEPTED AS OF july 1, 2024. APPLICATIONS WILL BE MAILED AT THE END OF JUNE FOR PAST APPLICANTS. APPLICATIONS ARE DUE BY APRIL 1, 2025. QUESTIONS, PLEASE CONTACT THE ASSESSOR'S OFFICE.\n\nCURRENT INSPECTIONS (2024)\n\nBuilding permit and 10-year cyclical inspections will start in March 2024. Building permit inspections will continue until late June and cyclical inspections will continue for the remainder of the year. All businesses are subject to inspection for Business Personal Property to verify equipment in use and the assets listed in your Form of List. Inspections will begin in January 2024 and continue through the Spring/Summer for FY25.\n\nThese inspections help ensure fair cash value on all properties in town per MGL CH59, S38. These inspections provide the most accurate data to produce assessments. Without the proper inspections, the assessment is estimated based on available building permit data and other sources.\n\nWe appreciate your cooperation when completing these inspections and creating fair and equitable assessments for all taxpayers. Inspections are completed all year mostly by town identified vehicles with department staff unless special projects are underway.\n\nAny questions or concerns, please contact the Assessor's office at 508-543-1215.\n\nFY24 Tax Rates per thousand in valuation:\n\nResidential: $13.51 (14.21 FY23)\n\nCommercial, Industrial, Personal Property: $17.99 (18.37 FY23)\n\nFY24 values are posted in the GIS/database link.\n\nAny questions or concerns, please contact the Assessor's office at 508-543-1215."
