        "text": "The memorial project is dedicated to the efforts of an unsung hero, social and animals‚Äô right activist, Hina Muzaffar Shah. She runs an organization called ‚ÄúFaltoo say Paltoo‚Äù, where she rescues injured cats and dogs, nursing them to health, and allowing them to find a forever home. The user experience represents the feelings of an abused animal that goes through the care of Hina Muzaffar Shah. The circulation allows the user to walk through a series of columns, the inclination of these elements is meant to create unease and distrust. As they proceed, the columns start to straighten up and open up to the sky, inspiring a sense of trust and comfort in the user. When they reach the memorial space, they are welcomed with an olive tree right in the center of the space. The Olive Tree symbolizes friendship which is the whole concept of Hina‚Äôs organization, ‚Äúanimals are our friends and not our enemies.‚Äù The form and layout of the built space is circular, mimicking a cycle within which there are certain voids and extruded spaces. These voids symbolize the loss of love, trust and confidence that occurs in animals when they face abuse. The other half of the plan has extruded spaces which symbolize how with love and care one cannot just fill those voids in fact enhance them as well. In addition to being a symbolic and experiential memorial, it also serves as a space for awareness programs, display spaces, and reading corners in the caf√©. - #design #designschool #designstudent #designportfolio #studentwork #nust #architecture #bachelorsofarchitecture #architecturalwork #architecturaldesign #architecturalproject\n\nSimple steps we've taken at Sunnylands to redirect materials from landfills into new homes. 1. We assessed exhibitions at the time of design & install to determine what can be reused or rehomed so we were not scrambling at tear down. It was collected on day of tear down to reduce carbon footprint of storage and multiple moves. 2 examples: We rehomed all the cases that we built for an exhibition of our Steuben Asian Artists in Crystal collection to a Children's Museum and a Historic Society. Photo stands were borrowed from another institution for the the photo exhibition Flight Plan: The Birds of Sunnylands. The owner institution determined they did not want them back, so we rehomed them to a local high school. 2. When receiving restored items in crates, we alert other cultural institutions, schools, and artists of their availability date. We Arrange pick up or delivery on the same day the items are uncrated to avoid storage and multiple moves. Be willing to assist the groups to make it convenient. Examples: Crates used to transport fragile embroidered furniture and other historic pieces have been given to a community art organization, an artist, and a local craftsman who was building small homeless homes in the desert. #sunnylands #sustainability #collaborate #community #waste\n\nüå≥ How far are you from a public garden? Today, take a moment to visit a public garden, where this season, nature's splendor unfurls in vibrant displays of color and fragrance. These green sanctuaries offer moments of serenity amidst urban chaos, inviting contemplation and renewal. üèû From May 3rd to the 12th, it‚Äôs National Public Gardens Week in the US. To celebrate, we are showcasing #FallenFruit, an #arts collaboration exploring interstitial urban spaces, bodies of knowledge, and new forms of citizenship. üçé Their thought-provoking #artwork ‚ÄúFallenFruit: Elysian Park 2005,‚Äù is a collaged photograph on giclee print that underscores the importance of public education and environmental activism. In their words, ‚ÄúPublic education is the key to changing the future. Global and local environmental issues are not taught in school curricula nationwide.‚Äù üö∂‚ôÄÔ∏èSo venture out... What do you see? Hear? Smell? What‚Äôs lacking? What requires change? What merits preservation?

Well, you go up to the High Line!‚Ä¶..NYC‚Äôs elevated park offers cool things to do and public art. No matter what time of the year, taking a walk on the High Line is a perfect place to get out of the crowded city bustle and into some beautiful nature surrounded by artists' sculptures. \"Grounding\" is a biohacking practice where one connects with nature by putting your feet on the grass, touching trees, and being in nature. Studies show that it can help with anxiety, energy levels, stress, and improve sleep. #elementalhomedesigns #biohackinginthecity\n\nfresh perspective from 2017 #Ecological #Design #Lab Studio RAVINE XING: A #Landscape #ConnectivityPlan for #Toronto's #RavineSystem 'Coinciding with the release of the #Ravine #Strategy from the City of Toronto, this #studio #follows #draft #objectives 10 and 12, which seek to #build #connections between the #city and the #ravines. For this studio, connections are considered in both the #physical, and #visual #sense, as #collective #benefits to #human, and #nonhuman #residents of the city must be #balanced. The ravines offer important #ecological #services to the city and #region, existing as #quasi #urbanwild #spaces. The #significance of the ravines in the #hydrological #system is recognized as a #limiting #factor to development due to the #risk of #flash #flooding. This studio then seeks to develop connections while recognizing the #complexity of #interests, #challenges, and opportunities involved. Significant #attention is paid to #positioning the ravines in the #cultural #identity of the city, with #aims to #grow #social #appreciation for their #complexity and #uniqueness. If this can be made #legible and #visible, they can be #valued, and #loved. In order to #assess the #usage and #latent #demand for the ravines, the team has developed a #regression #model based on #GIS #data and #orthophotos. This model allows #researchers to #quantifiably #predict where connectivity can be #improved, and the extent to which a new #path will #affect #use. In the second #phase of the project, the team takes a closer look at the #neighbourhoods around the upper sections of #BlackCreek near Keele and Finch. Nine connectivity #recommendations are #explored that touch on #important #factors under a #systemsbased #approach. This process and a number of the recommendations are presented on display panels for #publicuse. Finally, a report is developed that explains the #establishment of #themes, mapping methods, and all nine recommendations in greater detail. #bioregional #placebased #intergenerational #intercultural #onehealth #wellbeing #leadership #education #sdgs #NbD #safe #biodiverse #culturalheritage #naturalheritage #H20 #food #land #airshed #diversityequityinclusion #AQ #design https://lnkd.in/gaa6rffa\n\nüéâ Unveiling a Vision Brought to Life by FASTSIGNS! üéâ üèõÔ∏è Step into the world of Rivers Crossing, where community outreach goes beyond the traditional!

I'm pretty sure I don't need to duplicate all the benefits of living walls and green roofs, so I will keep this months final front cover post short and sweet. Greening our cities is a no brainer, and for those who have been following my page you will know that today marks the end of Zombie Awareness month. The best way to celebrate that is to close on a positive... Besides the many benefits of green roofs, they sure would make a secure retreat from a zombie apocalypse. Once the tinned goods run out, home grown produce would be a must... alongside sunbathing without groaning noises and the fear of being bitten... Bliss!! A win for nature and a win for humanity To follow...A round up of this month in my next post and what to expect moving forward. Great things are on the way!! #Zombieawarenessmonth #Zombie #Zombies #Awarenessmonth #Greenroofs #Greenarchitecture #Livingwalls #Magazinecover #Magazine\n\nHow to use space effectively. Don‚Äôt think in straight lines! Resonating off the thoughts of creative authority Grant Dudson, designing spaces that have a natural flow heightens curiosity and encourages exploration. In our ‚ÄúWhat the Gut‚Äù activation, we took this approach and ran with it, transporting visitors to a space where they could explore and learn as they walked through the twists and turns of the human digestive system. This entertaining and creative approach to environment design also keeps visitors engaged for longer. Nature doesn‚Äôt work in straight lines, so neither should you.üí° ‚ÄúWhat the Gut‚Äù!? üëâ https://lnkd.in/etPRPVDf #brandexperience #experientialdesign #experiencedesign"
