        "text": "SHREVEPORT, La. (KSLA) — Organizations teamed up Sunday (Aug. 4) to give away 1,000 backpacks in Shreveport. But the event was more than just a school supply giveaway.\n\nThousands of people flooded Booker T. Washington High School to attend the fifth annual Citywide Kickback.\n\n“So everybody is not fortunate enough to have the resources, the things that they need to go to school,” Craig Johnson said. “So bringing the community together as one whole, one unity and one change is our mission. And our goal is to make sure that those kids have what is and what they need to actually go back to school.”\n\nCouncilwoman Tabatha H. Taylor said, “When they tell you it takes a village to raise a child, yes, it does, and this is the village. You have people from every part of community that is here. That is reflective of wanting to see our children succeed.”\n\nOrganizers and state officials both agreed that it is important for students to see their community standing behind them in support.\n\n“For them to see us is an identifiable sign that we care about what happens to them,” Taylor said. “Because we can say ‘do well,’ but then if there are no corresponding actions behind that, what does that mean to that child? And so I am grateful to see the number of people out here today. I am grateful to see the number of community partners and sponsors.”\n\nThe kickback also offered students empowerment sessions where they could learn things such as how to tie a tie, coping skills and how to set goals.\n\n“A lot of times, we think of just addressing the needs of the child in the classroom. But you really have to address the needs of the family as a whole because that’s what gives a much larger impact,” Victor L. Thomas said. “If you create a home environment, that’s gonna be conducive to learning and to success.”\n\nThey had parenting sessions and other resources for families as well.\n\n“It’s not only just the backpack giveaways and school supplies,” Dr. Terence Vinson said. “Also we have empowerment sessions, some parenting sessions. And so this event goes far beyond our expectations, and I am sure the parents are just excited to be here.”\n\nWith the school year just around the corner, the goal of the kickback was to empower young students and take some of the financial strain off families in the area.\n\n“Many of us know that the struggles with so much inflation with things like that, so I am sure parents are in need, families are in need. And so this is a great work,” Vinson said.\n\n“I know when I was in school, they required so many things. You know, some of the parents, they can’t afford everything,” Johnson said. “So, we have these entities that get assistance and things like that, and we want to share the wealth.”\n\nHundreds of families left the kickback with backpacks and other school supplies along with the resources they may need to have a successful school year."
