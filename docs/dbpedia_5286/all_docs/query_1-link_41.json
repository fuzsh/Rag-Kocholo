        "text": "Hello, I'm script editor on a BBC1 series called The Last Post, written by Peter Moffat and following the lives of the Royal Military Police and their families in the 1960s and 70s. We are currently researching Hong Kong during this period for a possible second series (the first is set in Aden) and are keen to build up as vivid and holistic a picture as possible of the area and life within it at that time. The show will not just be restricted to life within army barracks so we are keen to hear from civilians as well. If anyone was interested and happy to talk - either on the phone or to simply to share some memories/photos over email, we'd love to hear from you. My email is ellasjones @ gmail.com. Very best, EllaHi Tommy, Vincent here! We used to live next door to you in HKU. Loved the photos. Now I'm retired I'm planning to do some scanning & add to the huge interest in those heady days that so many people enjoyed.\n\nSorry to just learn that your mum passed away. My mum is still going at 92. Dad died 20 years ago. He loved Hong Kong, spent 30 years there. It was an amazing life for all living there. I'm still in touch with a lot of people from those HKU days in the '50s,'60s & 70s. We meet in Gerrard St every year. Bards, Mellors,Greens, Simpsons, Blundens. We've had Goulds, Hodgsons & Szczepaniks too. My brother Jerome goes to HK almost every year. I last went in 2000.\n\nSaw your photos of Greenwich, quite recent ? That's where we live now.\n\nReally enjoyed your photo's & see-ing your family.\n\nStay well, be good. Vincent MellorI was interested to see John Eyre had imported the first 9 Borneo polo ponies into HK. My mother ran a horse-riding stable for handicapped children near Sha Tin in the early 1970's. We had two Borneo ponies - 'Ganet' and 'Tommy'. 'Ganet', I recall was a chestnut & feisty and kept wanting to bite the much milder Tommy who was grey/black. Ganet even managed to get half of my older brother's arm in his mouth and refused to let go! Before we had our stables, as children my brothers and I used to ride these ponies at Sek Kong. Another Borneo pony 'Sherpa' was the feistiest of them all (although the smallest). They were all stallions so no doubt believed they had a point to prove with one other! Tommy was my pony and sadly, whilst grazing along the single-lane access road up to our house in Lower Shing Mun slipped and tumbled down a steep bamboo-covered hillside that faced Sha Tin Heights. The vet was called who put dear Tommy out of his misery (I think he had broken his back). He was buried were he lay. The last time I saw Sherpa was in the late 80's/early 90's when he was at the Cassino Lines stables. Went to St. Andrew's Church for one year in kindergarten 1965-66. I have always wondered whatever happened to everyone afterwards. Got my very first punishment standing outside the classroom, because the Indian girl sitting in front of me turned around and spat a big bad spit at my feet. Others saw it and thought it's my own spit, whisphered from one person to another till it reached the boy who's the prefect or something. He stood up and reported it to the teacher. I was called to stand before the teacher, and she asked me if I did that spit. My English was very limited but I kept saying \"No\" everytime she tried to make me say\"Yes\". I was not angry at all, just very puzzled. Would be fun if anyone at all remember that episode after all these years :) Grace C.Hi Mike\n\nI don't remember the names of the girls that you mentioned from The Scene, but my boss there at the time was Beth Simpson, from south Africa, I think she still lives there, I was only 19 years old then,worked during the day as secretary, and three nights a week at the scene. Was a very posh place then,everyone was smartly dressed, I remember the fabulous wall of fishtank,aquarium,meant to be under the sea. I still have many records from there marked from slow to fast,depending on the mood, and dimming the lights etc, very cool at the time I am a grandmother now,pity I don't have any pics from inside,however I believe that another scene has been created there, but very different inside.The management sent me a pic but it was taken long after I left in 1970.DJs today are very different. Glad someone out there remembers the place,side entrance from Hankrow Road if I remember correctly and part of the Peninsula Hotel. They put us up for the night the year that there was rioting and many people marching with their little red books and chanting for chairman mao.I always tried to catch the last star ferry back to Hong Kong Island as I lived at Caritas House andit was frowned upon when doors had to be opened after 2am. closing time for the scene was 2am,Beth used to let me leave early to catch the last ferry.What memories and so innocent by todays standards. Hong Kong is not the same now,most places I revisit arnt.\n\nadeleMy god what a blast from my past. I was born at St Paul's Hospital, Causeway Bay. We lived in Stanley all of my life, until I left on 4th July 1976 for London. Went to Quarry Bay Junior School,1964-1970, then Island School 1970-1976. Came back to HK Dec 1982 to be married the following Feb '83 at Union Church Kennedy Road. Both my kids were born at Canossa Hospital. We live in Ho Man Tin Hill Road.So who remembers Catch 33 - above the Old Vic Pub run by the Hilton, the Front Page - down the Wanch, The Basement- opposite the KCC & Finally the Juke Box - Hang Kow Rd near the Bottoms Up? My husband Tony Dawtrey along with a few others from Round Table Started Wings Discos, back in mid 70's. I was in London but came home for a few holidays, so Catch 33 was I 1st place, not that we knew each other then. Had my 21st in the HK Club,Feb '80, then we youngsters hit the Go Down and the Back Bar,& partied all night long. The Go Down/ Back Bar been my haunt since I was about 14+.As my parents knew the owner very well, it was the only place they would let go alone. And always had to catch the last #6 bus at 11.30pm back to Stanley But always managed to miss the police raids, as I was sitting in the restaurant having my noodle supper !!!!!! say no more on that topic.The Bull n Bear, the Jockey, Saturdays spent in the Pit stop snack bar, the road below Thingammigs that deep dark hole in the basement with that whole wall mirror. Not a pretty sight in the day time. True we all talked about taking photos when we were younger, but some did and some didn't. I've got some lurking about but not in a place I can readily get to.We left HK in April '95. Tony left China Light & Power Co. after 24 years of service. We now live in Andorra, but the inside if the house looks like CHINA/HONG KONG all over the place.You can take the girl out of HK but you can never take HK out of the girl. Born, raised, schooled, married & kids there, & it's still home. Our son requested that his ashes be scattered there, off the beach at Yeung Shu Wan, Lamma Island. he died in march 2012. Still waiting to be able to go home and do as he wished. I want my ashes scattered on Stanley Beach when the time comes. My brother & sister still live there. One day I'll be back !!!!! thanks for the very heart warming memories. Hi I lived in HK from September 1985 - March 1986 (brief in comparison to some of the people on here) but made the most of my time there. I worked in a kindergarten in Chi Fu Fah Yuen, went to a nightclub called 1997, shopped in Stanley Market every weekend, met friends in The Other Place every Friday night for cocktails before heading off to Mad Dogs where we would start upstairs and work our way downstairs where every Friday, Saturday and Sunday night there would be a 60s & 70s disco. I met the man who would be my first husband in there and he proposed to me one starlit night on Discovery Bay. I went back to HK on business in 1997, just before the changeover but it wasn't quite the same experience as living there, as I stayed in hotels and was driven everywhere by limos provided by the client, so could not re-live the experience of riding the mini buses or Star Ferry. Not sure I'd like to go back now as I'm sure not a single nightlife venue remains and I would feel quite sad about that!Wonderful to see photos; I was married to a soldier in RAMC stationed at the military hosp 68 - 71 and my youngest son was born there. When ew went back to UK He loved to tell people that he was born in Hong Kong. He and his brother were very fair and I remember people wanting to look at them and touch their hair as the sun made the hair almost white. Remember water restrictions, bathing 3 kids and myself in 1 bowl of water! Main things I remember was how crowded it seemed,even late at night; cant imagine it now - and how embarrassed I was trying to haggle! Still have beautiful rosewood cedar chest now over 40 years old, wish I could go back again but never have. Thanks for bringing back all the memoriesHi\n\nI also enjoyed your photos, I went to Hong Kong in 1966 from Australia...don't know if you remember the Scene discoteque at the Peninsula Hotel, well I was one of the DJs there,then worked for Cathay Pacific at Kai Tak Airport for a few years ,was married at St Theresas church in Kowloon Tong,lived on both side of the harbor,loved the star ferry,took my daughter back to visit in 1996 before changeover,would like to go back but feel images would not be the same,old memories are the best.Loved the photos we used to go to shatin to the restaurant on the water, swam at deepwater bay, went to functions at the repulse bay hotel,and even had a night swim at big wave bay, oh the things you do in your youth, too many good memories, thanks for the pics. adele We arrived in Hong Kong Feruary #rd 1954;I studied at the Saint Francis xavier,school,on Maple Street,Shum Shui Po,with my brother Reny,I was Form -! student,our principle was :Brother Kenny, a Canadian,my Teachers name is :Brother James,he,is Bald;so we the students named him \"Bald eagle\",and Brothers calls us ?Rebels,brother edward is our physical instructor,a robust,wide shouler,Portugese,he is very nice to all of us,our Math teacher?we nick-named him brother Bang bang,because the moment he enters our Class-room he would bang his rattan cane on his desk,he is a real \"Meanie\",we live on Hankow ROad,near the YMCA,no.6-A apartment house,my Dad got an Aviary on the roof -top,he rears homing pigeons,life in Hong Kong those early days? are private-parties,with every one chipping a dollar to buy the Soft drinks and sandwiches!sometimes we all go to the beach at Lai Chi Kok,to cool off or just rent a row boat,and do some casual paddleling.there was very few radios,in those days,so we subscribe to Reddifussion,a box like contration with \"Pipe\"music\"A\" for English an \"B\" for the Chinese channels.there was no television as yet ,so we teenagers make do with what ever occupies our time.My Dad is a Musician,and I took up drum lessons,and played with my Dad at the King Wah Restauraunt & Night Club,My first girl friend ?was a girl Named Irene Mak,she is Eurasian,her Dad is English,and her Mom is Chinese;she is exceddingly Beautiful,her Dad works for the Hong Kong Tram service as an Inspector;with free housing,but since Irene got a lot of brother and sister? forced herself to be a Dancing girl.after work at the King Wah Night Club?she invited me to have snacks;behind the night club ,where there are lots of Tai Pai tong,or food market,I had a small bottle of whisky,and we both drank,and finally she invited me to retire in a small hotel,and thats where I lose my Male virginity,Irenes virginity was takened by her Uncle,because she was alone at the house ?her Uncle offered her a coke laced with sleeping tablets,when she woke up she felt pain on her private part!her Father kick out the Uncle from their house!she was crying while telling me her story!any way I told Irene ;life must go on move forward,I stll miss her to this very day,her Beauty is what gets me right into my Soul,I can never forget her ever.AMENFantastic photos! I was born in HK in 1965 and lived there until I was 13 then came to the UK to Boarding School. These photos are brilliant- priceless--took me right back to how it was. I was actually looking for photos of Shatin Heights and Shatin Inn- both weekend treats when I was a little girl. I haven't been back to HK for 20+ years- somehow finding it hard to see it for how it is now. We lived in Kowloon on Perth Street- just behind KGV for quite a while then moved to Bonham Road then Tai Hang Road. So to see some of those places in your photo collection was a-maz-ing! Thank you so much for putting this together!!Hi,\n\nSteve Orpin here, great seeing these montages of HK.was there 67- 71, we lived at Quarry Bay, my\n\nFather worked at Taikoo Dockyard. Remember you well Tom, I was in 5c at\n\nKGV, and recall blurry shared memories of parties, Chung King Mansions, coffee shop and Disco, ThingGummyBob bar in central, The Blow Up disco in Wanchai, The Purple Onion ..? somewhere off\n\nNathan road think we all were in every disco going at the time, despite the tender ages of being 14-17!\n\nLRC on the peak, numerous parties, had the time of my life, and by the time we left I was 17 going on 25..!\n\nNames that come to mind, Chris Aitkin, (met him in London in the 70's)Gerard Burke, Denis Sartain,\n\nJohn Hubbard, Vanessa Kessington, Sue Woods, Alan Peddigrew,Lesley George, Kieron Chatterjee, RichardMercado.\n\nI'm sure\n\nmore names will flood back. Great that you have taken the time to share your pics of our wonderful HK.\n\nAh Tom, you're a star, I lived and worked in HK from June 1979 to Sept 1990 and your photos recall so many fond and treasured memories of a unique and wonderful place, I still visit at every opportunity and although HK is constantly evolving and reinventing itself the magic remains, mainly through the people of HK, I worked at HMS Tamar as a civvie having arrived for a 5 week holiday and deciding to try my luck at life there, I lived in Lockhart Rd next to the 369 Shanghainese Restaurant, still can almost taste those noodles!! I even remember some of the people who have contributed to your comment page, Tommy Banks as a member of the HK Football Club, Bob McKirdy's son, never met him but I remember his father, Bob is legend, great guy! I'll be back in November with my father to celebrate his 85th birthday, again thanks Tom, wonderful photos and fabulous memories I was a navy wife through 70s and 80s and was out in HK in 1971 and again in 1980 - the last time with my two eldest children aged five and seven who went to St. Andrews School in Kowloon. We lived in army transit flats in Perth Street Kowloon. From our balcony eleven floors up we could see Chequerboard mountain and watched the planes line up for Kai Tak Airport. It was such a privilege to be there during this period, and I loved learning about Chinese culture. We enjoyed travelling around on the ferries, trams, buses and trains - such a great public transport system. HK was a special place. Thank you very much for these wonderful memories. If only one could really travel back in time. Is the old Marine Police building still standing?Hi Tom\n\nThese are great photos. This is the HK I remember and love, much better than how it is now. You won't know me but my grandmother was good friends with your mum and I used to have dim sum often with them so I knew your mum well. I remember you and your sister from the photos she would show us of you. It's so random how my brother found this website of yours, so I felt I should send you a message. I live in London,UK now but go back to see my mum all the time in HK. She also knew your mum well. Sadly my grandmother passed away last year but she used to often reminisce about your mum. Take care, Priscilla Richardson\n\nMany fond memories of Running the streets of WanChai in the 70's and 80's. The China Fleet Club was great place to spend time while inport. Now I didn't just do the normal Sailor on Liberty thing, I did do some of the Touristy things as well. Tiger Balm Gardens, Victoria Peak, etc. etc. A friend of mine had a suit custom tailored while their from purple crushed velvet, boy did he look like a pimp wearing it! I remember having a Suit made of Double Knit material, (remember it was 75). I also remember leaving a shipmate behind after a visit in 82, the victom of drug abuse. I remember there was a big deal the first time I was there in Oct. 73, Don't know what it was called all I remember is that there were hundreds of people swimming across the channel from HK island to Kowloon. They all passed just yards off the Bow of the ship I was on.\n\nI really wish I could have spent more time there.I was stationed in Hong Kong with the RAF between 1970 - 1973, living in Flat 6 of the 1st Block on the left as you entered Sunderland Road. I worked initially at Raf Kai Tak in GRSF, but on promotion was moved upto Tai Mo Shan, and then subsequently back to GRSF at Kai Tak. Loved the place and we had to be collected from Departures by RAF VC10 cabin staff as whole family unwilling to leave. Am back in Hong Kong this week for a look at how its changed, with a trip up to Tai Mo Shan this afternoon, before Chinese New Year celebrations this evening. Mostly totally unrecognisable (particularly Kai Tak and Sunderland Road, although Osbourne Barracks remains the same. Also the people and side streets which are all mostly as they were, particularly the people who were always polite, helpful and friendly, whilst not allowing 'Gweilos' (not sure of the spelling)to interefere with their lives too much! Would like to make it back again before I finish my 'bucket list'. I lived in Sek Kong village from 1957-60 and went to Sek Kong junior school (forces school). We used to have the local vegetable man visit every week (wonkee)he'd carry three baskets either side supported by a stick over his shoulders. Full of every imaginable veg you can think of. Xmas 1959 saw him coming down steps to our army bungalow as drunk as a lord after so many army families had given him a drink! We had a locely ahma who used to teach us chinese. Never did uunderstand why her room had an elsen toilet but we had a plumbed in toilet. They'd empty her elsen every week. Mr eastcrabbe was the headmaster of sek kong school. I still have the old camphor wood chest my parents bought in about 1958. I could never part with it!! Kids used to have lovely camp days where you could have a ride with a ghurka soldier in a trap being pulled by a muel. Typhoon Mary was horrifying - I remember furniture, dogs, cats - all sort of items coming down the storm ditch to the side of our house. We arrived in h.k. on board Nevassa and returned home on the Oxfordshire. Happy days and happy memories!Believe it or not, but 100% true. I as a blonde haired 11-13 year old English boy used to work for the following bars in Wanchai during 1969-1972.The Playgirl Topless Bar,The 747 Bar, The Pussycat Bar & a couple of others I have forgotten the name of.How it came to pass was my Mother used to run a Hi Fi store called Gilmans in the China Fleet Club during those years.I used to spend all day in the bowling alley in the same building.I got friendly with loads of bar girls who brought sailors galore in every day.I ended up showing groups of sailors around HK as their tour guide for USD$ 20 a day each.I then used to take them to bars in Wanchai, The Purple Onion Disco in Kowloon or Thingummys Disco behind the Kings Theatre in Central in the evenings and got got paid to do so.I was earning more a week than my mother was earning in a month lol.Yes I know you had to be 21 to get into a bar, but when you have a group of 10-12 sailors with you with 6 months salary to spend they all used to let me in.\n\nAlso I bet we were at school together JuneHi, Thanks for posting such wonderful pictures, i have just shown my two daughters what HK looked like when Mummy was little! I came to HK in 1976 aged 3 and went to Peak School and Island school. After a few years out studying and travelling I found myself drawn back to the only place I have ever called home. I have since settled in Big Wave Bay and gave birth to both my children in HK. Everything is so so different now and I often find myself trying to explain what it was like way back then... Makes me kind of sad to remember the pieces that have been lost, many of the old markets, the squatter villages, the almost deserted beaches... but there are still remnants of the old HK and of course the energy and pull of this place remain unchanged.\n\nThanks again Tom fantastic trip down memory lane.Thank you so much for collecting these pictures. They certainly bring memories back. My family lived in Des Voeux Road West for many years before moving to 104 Robinson Road. The view from our balcony in the 70s was stunning. We could see the Kai Tak taxiway on a clear sky. The mud slide in Kotewall Road was so close to our building. We witnessed the army helping to clear the site and saved people from the collapsed building. Many of the pictures are so faimiliar. I went to school in Robinson Road. My parents and all the children we used to walk from the Peak down to Aberdeen passing the reservoir. Those were the wonderful days as a young teen. I now live in London (for the past 23 years) All of the rest of my brothers/sisters are now in North America. I can see quite a few who lived in Robinson Road and the vicinity.Hi Tom, just like everyone else, I just sort of take a big breath, and think \"oh wow! that was then...\" Also went to Peak School, KGV, & GSIS. Haven't been back since Jan'85. SO MANY memories - a huge chunk of my life, which I can't really communicate to / share with the people I know now, here in Lancashire. Hi to TOM BRIGGS!! I still have a drawing of yours, given to me by my late parents, and a couple of your books, with Colin Chriswell.. not to mention a painting of yours, which you tore up, at KGV, and I then sellotaped back together!! :) I have fairly recently inherited shedloads of slides that my dad took, of HK from about 1966 - 1980-something. I have digitised a lot; there are many more - it just takes time.. They are not of the quality of these pics of Tom's, but none the less, they do impart the essence of those times.. If anyone is really interested, let me know (liz_hughes@btopenworld.com)and I will try to make some of them available. Hi Tom\n\nThanks for the memories. The first part of my positively idyllic childhood was spent in Hong Kong (the other part in the Philippines). I also went to the Peak School from 1966-1968 and before that I was at Quarry Bay School. In the Peak School days I lived at Vivian Court and prior to that at Parkview Mansions (long since demolished) on Tai Hang Road.\n\nDo you remember PG Farms? That was always a great place for kids to go to. Also the yacht club for sailing.\n\nI remember when they opened Lion Rock Tunnel and we were able to drive out to the New Territories and go to the Sha Tin Heights Hotel. Amah Rock was the local sight to see.\n\nI've been back to HK quite a few times, the most recent being last September. Although it's still a wonderful place to go, I believe that it's lost some of its magic.Hi Tom\n\nThank you so much for sharing these wonderful pictures of the old HK. I was born in 1987 and it's so great to see what HK was like before that. I always wish I was born in the 60s so that I could see what you did, such drastic change of HK. I have always been living in the New Territories for the past 20years, so Kowloon and HK island are not where Im familiar with, I believe you know HK better than I. It is a pity that from the time I was born to now, HK has just been becoming more modern and international, but at the same time losing what I think made HK so special in your time. I prefer the old HK after seeing your pictures to be honest. Thanks again for giving me this opportunity to experience the 70s & 80s HK!!\n\nCheers\n\nCalvin Chan NT WestI was born at 1970 and brought up in HK. The photos are so excellent and impressive that let me see the quick development of Hong Kong. At the photo showing the harbour view in the past, Jardine House is the tallest in 70s and 80s. But now there are so many tall buildings around it. The most impressive photo is the past view of repusle bay. It was so small when I was a child but nowadays, it become so big. (I always go to there now) Also, I never see the former building of HK Club in Central. That \"stone\" building in the past is shown at your photo, but it was dismantled and is now redeveloped to a curtain wall and morden building. ha.. ha.. Thank you for your good photos. hi thanks for a memorable trip back to the HK i loved as a kid in 74-76, i lived in what was Sunderland Rd, I had the great pleasure to go back last year for the first time. i was shocked and stunned, i knew it would never be the same but it had changed so much , sunderland rd no longer being there as we knew it but a new set of blocks. but the biggest shock of all was where was the sea and the ferry to the island from mei foo !!!!!! thats land reclamation gone crazy. if anyone had any old pics of footage i'd dearly love to get a copy of it\n\nal the best, jim cunninghamThanks for sharing these great pics!\n\nI was born & raised in HK, left for Canada in mid 70s & have stayed there ever since. I went back recently for the the 1st time after more than 20 years, only to find just about all of the places that I grew up with are either gone or torn down & re-built. Your pics certainly brought back a lot of memories. I, for one prefer the colonial HK much more than the present Chinese HK. I guess the main reason why I had not gone back for a visit sooner... Anyway, I liked the harbour shots very much. I suppose with so many reclamation projects in proogress, I have to go back more often before they turn Victoria Harbour into Victoria River!\n\nThanks once again! Tom, great photos. Jane and I were in the same year at Island School, and I recognise quite a few folks in your photos (Lisa Sampson, & Veronica Needa to mention but two). I also lived in Robinson Road - No 84 just at the junction of Kotewall Road and Lytlleton Road and remember vividly the night of the Kotewall Road Disaster. Unfortunately, 67 people lost their lives that night. I remember hearing the noise of the block of flats coming down, but not knowing what it was at the time - then seeing the sea of mud flowing down the road. I have just returned from a week in HK and it till holds all the magic of home for me, even though I left in 1989. Thanks agin for posting your photos - and pass my regards, to Jane.Tom,\n\nwhat a great site!! Thankyou for sharing your photo's!! I was there 72-74, and what great memories they evoke!!\n\nBest Wishes,\n\nJude\n\nxxx\n\nSiobian,\n\nI remember Sunderland Road well!! My Dad was RAF too, although we lived at Lizzie Court,Beacon Hill, just up the road!! I remember the Monsoon Drains you speak of, and there was also a Social Club (Lady Hughes) there!! I knew a few people who lived in Sunderland Road, and am actually in touch with one of them, along with old friends from the school I went to (St Georges)!! St.Georges is now an Australian International School, I believe, but it's not far from where Sunderland Road was/is!! You need to head up Waterloo Road, towards Lion Rock, passing Hampshire Road on your right! Sunderland Road is just a little further along, on the same side!! Good Luck and have a great time!!\n\nJude\n\nxxxNice work. I was born and raised in Hong Kong. However, I left HK after 1970. These pictures bring back the part of HK that I have left behind. Thank you very much. I hope that you can keep this website running forever, because it is has tremendous historical significance. This is Hong Kong in its full glory before it was returned to China. The funny part is this is HK through the mind eyes of a tourist. For those who were born and raised there may not have treasured and appreciate these scenery. We were grew up with these things, and it had not become a necessity for us to pick up a camera to record these scenery. However, for a visitor, these sceneries of the eastern culture are very interesting. It has become very interesting to me after living in the U.S for over thirty years. Thank you again for so unselfishly and generously sharing your memory with us."
