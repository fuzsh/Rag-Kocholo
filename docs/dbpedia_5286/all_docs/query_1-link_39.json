        "text": "Our vision is simple: to make great watches at exceptionally fair prices. Inspired by the 'Father of the Modern Chronometer' and a love for vintage watchmaking techniques, in 2012 Thomas Earnshaw set out to fill a unique gap in the market. With a nostalgia for the golden age of elegance and watchmaking, we aimed to go beyond the expected and redefine the new classic - and our watches have done just this.\n\nThomas Earnshaw watches are designed to be different. Drawing inspiration from the past, with a unique, vintage-inspired aesthetic unlike any other brand, each timepiece showcases fine craftsmanship and fantastic watchmaking techniques, at a fair price. Known for our intricate, skeletonised movements and exhibition case backs, we're constantly testing new materials, colour combinations and techniques to reimagine the classic watch for today."
