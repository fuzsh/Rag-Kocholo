Derbyshire, England[1] and the next year was brought to America by his parents Thomas Potts and Joan Platts of \"The Peak\", Derbyshire, England.[2] [3]\n\nWhen Thomas was 20 he married Mary (Records) Potts (abt.1678-) on 20 June 1698 in Burlington, Burlington, New Jersey. The couple had 5 children: Richard Potts, Rebecca Potts, Ann Potts, Thomas Potts, and Mary Potts.\n\nThe current profiles of their children Mary Potts and Nathaniel Potts (1710-1761) give the same DOB, 1710. Research needs to be done to see if they were possibly twins, and Mary \"Records\" died at this time. There is a 9 year gap between their birth and his next children Joshua Potts (1719-1761) and William Potts (1721-1783), likely by his wife Mary (Borden) Potts (abt.1684-abt.1741)\n\nAfter the death of his 2nd wife Mary (Borden) Potts (abt.1684-abt.1741), he married Rebecca (Stacy) Potts, widow of Joshua Wright.\n\nThomas Potts Junior received a bequest in the 1715 will of his aunt Mary Revell.[4]\n\nDeath and Legacy\n\nThomas Potts of Mansfield, Burlington wrote his will 30 Jan 1754 naming wife Rebecca and children Nathaniel, Joshua, William, Ann (wife of William Folwell), Mary (wife of John Cox), grandchildren (children of daughter Rebecca Cox and Thomas Potts).[5]\n\nJudge Thomas Potts Jr. died on 2 February 1754 at Burlington County, New Jersey, at age 76. He was buried at Baptist graveyard, Bordentown, New Jersey.\n\nSlaves\n\n\"\"two negroes\" are mentioned in the will abstract, names not stated.\n\nSources\n\n↑ Vital Records of New Jersey, Vol. 22, p. 303.\n\n↑ Peak District From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia [1]\n\n↑ US and International Marriages: Thomas Mansfield Potts: Birth date: 1677 ; Marriage date: 1698\n\n↑ Nelson, William (ed.), Calendar of Wills, Administrations, Etc.
