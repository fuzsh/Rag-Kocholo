        "text": "CFHS code – CL116a This inscribed flower holder was not recorded in the CFHS survey and was coded by FOMRC\n\nParish St Clements\n\nMonument\n\nA small stone cube with hole in the top for flowers and carved inscriptions on 4 sides. The inscriptions are now very eroded. It was found when mapping the parish of St Clements but we were not certain if it was in the correct location. It stands within the kerbstones of Elliot CL116, 2 rows from the east path.\n\nThere is no known relationship between the 2 families. There is a monument, marked out by barley twist kerbs but no obvious inscription, directly behind the Elliot kerbstones\n\nInscription\n\nSophia Mansfield died October 10th 1929 aged 67\n\nJames W Mansfield died Feb 16th 1932 aged 74\n\nWalter T Mansfield died Sept 13 1853 aged 68\n\nRest in Peace\n\nJames Walter was recorded as having been buried in this parish in 1932 but not Sophia in 1929 – this may be due to missing pages in the burial register.\n\nSophia Mansfield née Willmott (1863 – 1929) In various records Sophy, and Sophie were used.\n\nAn 8 year old Sophia Willmott was living in Orwell in 1871 with her parents Joseph and Naomi and 7 siblings. Joseph was a labourer. In 1880 a Sophy Willmott had a baby that was baptised Alma Willmott and no father was named. In the 1881 census baby Alma was living with her grandparents Joseph and Naomi and Sophia was living and working as a kitchen maid at the Wrestlers Arms in Petty Cury, Cambridge. Alma died in Orwell in May 1881 aged 8 months there was an inquest where it was stated that she died of acute bronchitis and confirmed that she was the illegitimate daughter of Sophie (sic) Willmott. Her full name was given here as Alma Souter Willmott.\n\nWe have not found a marriage for Sophia but she and James had at least 10 children Henry (1883), Walter Thomas (1885/6), Alma (1888), Henry Walter Thomas (1889), Letitia (1890), Horace (1891), Herbert (1893-19), Arthur (1896 -1897), Kate (1900) and Ethel Lily (1903 – 1905)\n\nHerbert was killed in WW1 and was buried in France. In 1911 aged 17 he had been working as a grocer’s errand boy.\n\nWhen Alma was born they were living in 3 Quince’s Court, Hobson St\n\nIn 1891 they were living in Turnsell Court, Hobson St.\n\nIn 1911 they were in Ram Yard\n\n1921 they occupied Dove House New Park St along with their son Arthur, daughter Kate and Alma & William Gillingham (daughter & Son in law).\n\nIn 1921 Sophia was working as a charlady for Taylor a solicitor.\n\nJames Walter Mansfield (25th February 1857 – 1932)\n\nWalter was born in Great Wilbraham his given name was James Walter but on most documents he was recorded as Walter. He was the son of David and Mary Ann (née Childs) Walter became a cabdriver\n\nFrom the Cambridge Daily News Jan & Feb 1982 and Mike Petty CDN1989 we learnt more about James.\n\nMike Petty wrote an article in the news in 1989 where he states that ‘Lame Walter’ was the last of the cabdrivers in 1917. It seems that he was much loved by his customers as they helped him buy a new cab in 1912\n\nA photo published in the CDN in January 1982 sparked a series of letters from his relations who remembered him fondly.\n\nAs he got older and arthritic he made himself an advertising box cycle which was hand operated – His dog Ruff, would sometimes help to pull him alongand sometimes his grandchildren would give him a push. When Walter died Ruff lay under the cart, pining, and died a year after his master.\n\nWalter Thomas Mansfield (1886 – 1952/3)\n\nWalter Thomas was the 3rd child if James and Sophia. In 1911 he was also working as a cab driver and by 1921 was working as a chauffeur for W Moss Cycle & Motor Engineer and lodging with the Horobin family at 1 Perowne St.\n\n[If you have any further information about this family, please contact us at Friendsofmillroadcemetery@gmail.com]\n\nBy Mary Naylor\n\nSources\n\nCFHS Transcripts of parish records\n\nBritish Newspaper Archive on Line\n\nCambridgeshire Collection\n\nRoll of Honour\n\nCommonwealth War Graves Commission\n\nThe origins of the name Dove House can be found here (clicking the link will take you to a new window)\n\nhttps://capturingcambridge.org/centre/portugal-street/dove-house-close/"
