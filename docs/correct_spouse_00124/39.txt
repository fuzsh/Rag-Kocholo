Contrary to public knowledge, seven-year-old Bimby Aquino Yap, his son by former wife Kris Aquino, is not eager James Yap's only child.

In an interview with Anthony Taberna in "Tapatan Ni Tunying," James admitted for the first time that he has another child by a former girlfriend.

Grateful to ex-girlfriend

"Actually, I want to thank my ex-girlfriend because no matter the issue I faced, she remained quiet and never spoke ill of me," he said.

James and Kris secretly tied the knot in July 2005 and the marriage was annulled in February 2012.

Before the marriage, nothing much was said about James' past love life.

Waiting for the right time

While James' relationship with Italian girlfriend Michela Cazola is going strong, a wedding doesn't seem to be forthcoming anytime soon.

"Marriage is just there. We just have to take it slow and wait for the right time," he said.

James also shared plans of ending his professional basketball career after six years and getting into coaching instead.

"I want to coach young people in high school. I want to share my experience with them. It would be great to help them, and see them play for the PBA (Philippine Basketball Association) someday."
