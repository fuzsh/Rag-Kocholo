MANILA, Philippines – Two years after their annulment, ex-spouses actress Kris Aquino and professional basketball player James Yap have reached “a long-term agreement” regarding the custody and visitation of their son Bimby Yap.

On March 5, Aquino took to Instagram to announce the news. The actress and TV host posted a collage of photos, including one which showed her and Yap smiling while shaking hands.

In the caption, Aquino thanked judge Cristina Sulit and lawyers Sig Fortun and Lorna Kapunan for their “patience & guidance” in helping them reach an agreement.

“It was a nearly 4 year journey that needed mutual healing, acceptance, and maturity,” she wrote, adding that as parents, she and Yap want their son “to grow up feeling loved & secure.”

“James & I as a couple weren’t blessed w/ a happy ending but through God’s grace we have been given a chance to have an And They Lived Happily Ever After. #peaceful #grateful #happy”

The journey has indeed been rocky for the couple, who, after ending their marriage, had been involved in controversy. In March 2013, Aquino accused Yap of making unwanted sexual advances on her, which prompted her to file a Temporary Protection Order against him.

Yap vehemently denied all the allegations, claiming Aquino had made him look like a rapist.

Early this year, the couple once again exchanged statements after Yap claimed he had not seen his son for 5 months. Meanwhile, Aquino told ABS-CBN that Yap had not made an effort to see their son.
