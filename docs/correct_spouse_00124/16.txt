The five year marraige of James Yap and Kris Aquino is now officially annulled. This has been announced by Kris’ best friend Boy Abunda. According to Boy, “lack of authority of the solemnizing officer” was the reason for annullment.

Kris and James got married on 10th July 2005 and Kris filed nullity of marriage on 9th August 2010. Bimby will remain in the custody of his mother but his father will have rights to visit him.

According to Kris and James all their properties have been settled already a year ago and there is no issue about that anymore.
