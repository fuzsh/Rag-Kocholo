For her birthday wish, Aquino said she wants legal freedom for her and Yap to be able to love again and share with their new lifelong partners the love that they failed to sustain between them.

The presidential sister is also thankful for the all the love and support from her family, especially from her two sons â€” James Yap Jr. and Joshua, that strengthens her from the insecurity of being single at 40.

Aquino also said she missed her mother, former president Corazon Aquino who passed away in 2009 due to colon cancer.
