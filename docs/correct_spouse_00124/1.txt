TV host-actress Kris Aquino’ s former husband James Yap says she’s dating a politician.

In an interview at the press conference of The PEP List 2013 on Thursday, March 27, James, who was named Pepster Choice Male Newsmaker of the Year, shared that he got the information from Bimby, his son by Kris.

"Last Friday nagkita kami ng anak ko, siya na nagsabi sa akin mismo kung sino. Politician. Tapos sabi sa akin ni Bimby, 'Joke lang.' After namin magswimming, sinabi sa akin ni Bimby na ito nga si ganito. Pero hindi ko pwede sabihin kung sino."

Is it Herbert Bautista?

How does he feel about reports that Kris is dating Quezon City mayor Herbert Bautista?

James replied, "Wala naman. At least masaya siya kung totoo man talaga. Ganoon naman talaga ang buhay eh, kailangan happy lang."

James, who is in a relationship with Italian Michela Cazzola, hopes Kris is happy with whoever she is dating.

"Hindi na ako nakikiaalam. Kung totoo eh di mas okay, kung hindi, hindi ko naman alam. Basta ang mahalaga, masaya siya sa buhay niya, para masaya lahat."

Kris and James have ended their legal dispute and reached an agreement regarding the custody of their son.

As a sign that all’s well between them, the San Mig Coffee Mixers star player shared that he has been teasing Kris about her love life.

Kris herself admitted in her show “Kris TV” that she’s dating again, but refused to give the guy’s identity.

‘Stay in love’
