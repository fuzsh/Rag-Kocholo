We just have to take it slow and wait for the right time,\" he said.\n\nJames also shared plans of ending his professional basketball career after six years and getting into coaching instead.\n\n\"I want to coach young people in high school. I want to share my experience with them. It would be great to help them, and see them play for the PBA (Philippine Basketball Association) someday.\"\n\nCaption: James Yap."
