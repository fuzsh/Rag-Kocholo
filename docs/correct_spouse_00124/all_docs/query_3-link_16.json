        "text": "James Yap has vowed to fight for his right as a father to James Yap Jr, following a court order granting the request of his ex-wife, Kris Aquino, that he stay away from her and their 5-year-old son.\n\n“I felt so said over the news that came out recently regarding the accusations levelled against me, including one on what seemed like a rape,” he told Yahoo! Philippines OMG! while at the office of his lawyers.\n\nA professional basketball player for SanMig Coffee Mixers, at the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA), Yap said that it would be difficult to break his son’s misconceptions about him, hinting that his ex-wife must have brainwashed the child.\n\nThe Makati Regional Trail Court Branch 144 granted the request of Aquino, an actress-TV host and presidential sister, who had complained of “overt sexual advances” during one of his visitations last December. Yap has denied the accusations.\n\nAquino’s lawyer, the former solicitor general Frank Chavez, said that James Jr, popularly known as ‘Bimby’, had seen his father’s advances at his mother, and had been traumatised by the experience, since Yap made “mean and malicious statements” when Aquino rejected him.\n\n“What I want now is to fight for my son,” said Yap, who stressed he couldn’t accept it that his son told him he hated him and that he was a liar. “I do not actually understand why she (Aquino) is doing this to me. I want us both to be close to our son even if she and I are estranged… But I do not know why she has been saying bad things about me to our son.”\n\nOne of Yap’s lawyers, Sonia Castillo, said she and her client are prepared to file a counter deposition to the temporary protection order (TPO) issued by the court to Aquino. She added that they would then attend the hearing, hoping that the case would no longer reach the trial period.\n\n“As lawyers, we’re hoping that in the first scheduled hearing the two parties can talk about things and, if they want to revise the agreement on visitation, then we would do that instead of having this,” she said. “There’s really no basis for the petition.”\n\nFollow Emirates 24|7 on Google News."
