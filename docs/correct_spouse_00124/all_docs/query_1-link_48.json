Anna Liza Logan, says that Kris Aquino and James Yap's marriage was void from the beginning. Logan explains that a declaration of nullity, not legal separation or annulment, will be filed for their case. Once the decree for nullity is finalized, both Kris and James will be able to marry someone else. However, the article does not provide details on why exactly their marriage was considered null and void from the beginning. The Philippine Family Code lists several grounds for declaring a marriage void such as one party being underage, the marriage being bigamous/polygamous, or if there was psychological incapacity that prevented the essential marital obligations.",
