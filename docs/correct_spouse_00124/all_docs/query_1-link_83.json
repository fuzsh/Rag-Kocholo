They have a son, Bimby, who is now 11.\n\nAfter 5 years of marriage, the two separated. Their annulment was finalized in 2012.\n\nKris and James' relationship has been tricky. Back in April, it made headlines after Kris called James out for the way he was treating their son.\n\nThe \"Queen of All Media\" has since said she no longer has issues with James and added that she acted strongly in the past because she was a mother.
