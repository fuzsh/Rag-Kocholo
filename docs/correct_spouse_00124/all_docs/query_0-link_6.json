        "text": "Celebrity mom Kris Aquino on Saturday broke her silence on her ex-husband James Yap’s rocky relationship with their 10-year-old son, Bimby.\n\nIn a lengthy Facebook post, Aquino criticized Yap for commenting on his relationship with their son during the opening of his new bar last Thursday.\n\n“James Yap- stop using Bimb for publicity, most especially when you are opening a BAR! That is the wrong venue to be discussing your relationship (or in this case lack of one) with your son,” she said.\n\nThe basketball star revealed in an interview during the launch of his new bar District 8 that he was having a hard time connecting with Bimby, whom he last saw 8 months ago during New Year’s Eve.\n\nAquino alleged that Yap has not exerted effort to reach out to Bimby or even provide for the child’s needs, noting that the basketball player last “shared” for Bimby’s tuition 3 years ago.\n\n“The simple truth is this and I am addressing this directly to the man who doesn’t want to give our 10 year old son peace: You haven’t exerted effort to get to know him, spend time with him, much less consistently contribute financially to his needs,” she said.\n\nShe added that she has “maintained” communication lines with Yap’s current girlfriend Michaela Cazzola because the latter had tried to get to know both Bimby and Josh.\n\n‘DON’T PLAY VICTIM’\n\nAquino then hit Yap for allegedly playing victim in his rough relationship with Bimby, noting how her ex-husband “walked away with millions” when they separated.\n\n“DO NOT PLAY THE VICTIM AGAIN- because a man who walked away with millions from an annulment settlement from a marriage that lasted just 4 years can never be a victim especially when he is portraying a 10 year old boy as the one at ‘fault’ in not liking him and making him feel na ‘magsasawa ka at masasaktan ka lang’ (that you’ll just get fed up and you’ll just get hurt),” she said.\n\nAquino and Yap got married in 2005 but separated 5 years later. Their marriage was annulled in 2012.\n\nThough claiming that money was not an issue with her, Aquino bared how Yap supposedly did not offer to pay for Bimby’s medical expenses when the child was hospitalized during New Year’s Day.\n\n“…Yet since you did bring it up- the New Year’s Eve that Bimb was in your care and had to be rushed to the hospital- was there even an offer to help pay for any of his medication? I am merely being factual- and in this instance TRUTH HURTS,” she said.\n\nKris went on to assure that she and her sons are content with their lives and asked Yap to give them peace instead.\n\n“It’s very simple: Don’t talk about us and don’t bother us, then I’ll keep quiet. Because the only thing I value more than myself is raising our son well, as a smart, respectful, and loving kid,” Aquino ended in Filipino.\n\nStory: ABS-CBN News, English translation added"
