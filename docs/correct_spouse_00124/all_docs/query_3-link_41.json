        "text": "James Yap opened up about how he felt when he heard from his son Bimby again after nearly a decade.\n\nColumnist Dolly Ann Carvajal shared her conversation with the basketball player in her column published on June 24. “I’m super happy to hear from Bimb after eight years. I’ve been praying for this day to come. Na-miss ko sobra si Bimb,” he was quoted as saying.\n\nJames also called their \"renewed relationship\" the “best Father’s Day gift ever.”\n\n“He said that he is looking forward to seeing his brother MJ again and meet his sister Francine soon. He wished me luck in my new career as a public servant,” he told the columnist, referring to his children with partner Mic Cazzola.\n\nIn a now-deleted post on June 19, Bimby’s mother, multimedia personality Kris Aquino talked about her son “rebuilding [his] relationship” with his dad on Father's Day without naming James.\n\n\"He's had the number to contact for almost a week, and the reluctance was so real, yet he took the first step towards rebuilding a relationship that I know will require some time to repair. Pero ang mahalaga ay nagsimula na,\" she wrote.\n\n“No names shall be named but it will be easy for you to figure out. Maraming pinagdaanan, maraming hindi pagkakaunawaan pero ayokong masabi na pinipigilan ko si Bimb.”\n\n“From the time Bimb was 8, he had the freedom to decide. Now at 16, I told him, ‘When someone reaches out after seven years, and there’s a chance for peace, then everyone wins,’” she continued.\n\nKris tied the knot with James in a civil wedding ceremony in July 2005. They welcomed their child Bimby in 2007.\n\nThe former couple announced their separation three years later and got their marriage annulled in 2012."
