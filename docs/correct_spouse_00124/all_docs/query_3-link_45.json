Ganun kalaki ang kontrata niya. There’s no reason for him to sell the game (As somebody who used to read the contracts of James Yap, I know that if they make it to the finals, then whatever amount is supposedly being offered for them to ‘fix’ the game is easily trumped by the money they’d earn if they reach the finals. That’s how huge his contract is. There’s no reason for him to sell the game).”\n\nAquino and Yap were married in 2005. They separated in 2010 and their marriage was annulled by the court in 2012. Yap is the father of Aquino’s son, Bimby."
