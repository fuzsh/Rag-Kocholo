        "text": "Is the consent of the father of an illegitimate child required in adoption?\n\nSection 9, paragraph (b) of RA 8552 states that the written consent of the biological parent/s is necessary. UP College of Law professor Danilo L. Concepcion in his article “Domestic Adoption: Law and Procedure” (IBP Journal, March 2009, Vol. 34, No. 1) states that the reason why RA 8552 requires such consent is that their parental authority over the child (the prospective adoptee) will be terminated.\n\nSeveral women have e-mailed about this kind of situation. Either they do not know where the biological father of their illegitimate children is or the father is making things difficult for them. One woman even told me that the biological father asked her for money in exchange for his written consent.\n\nProf. Concepcion argues (and I agree with him) that since an illegitimate child is under the sole parental authority of the mother under Article 176 of the Family Code, then the consent of the biological father is not necessary. Prof. Concepcion states that the problem is with the wording of the law. He says that instead of “biological parent/s” the law should have used “legal parent/s” instead.\n\nThe following may not be adopted:\n\n(1) A person of legal age, unless he or she is a child by nature of the adopter or his or her spouse, or, prior to the adoption, said person has been consistently considered and treated by the adopter as his or her own child during minority.\n\n(2) An alien with whose government the Republic of the Philippines has no diplomatic relations; and\n\n(3) A person who has already been adopted unless such adoption has been previously revoked or rescinded. Who May Be Adopted. — The following may be adopted:\n\n(a) Any person below eighteen (18) years of age who has been administratively or judicially declared available for adoption;\n\n(b) The legitimate son/daughter of one spouse by the other spouse;\n\n(c) An illegitimate son/daughter by a qualified adopter to improve his/her status to that of legitimacy;\n\n(d) A person of legal age if, prior to the adoption, said person has been consistently considered and treated by the adopter(s) as his/her own child since minority;\n\n(e) A child whose adoption has been previously rescinded; or\n\n(f) A child whose biological or adoptive parent(s) has died:\n\nProvided, That no proceedings shall be initiated within six (6) months from the time of death of said parent(s)."
