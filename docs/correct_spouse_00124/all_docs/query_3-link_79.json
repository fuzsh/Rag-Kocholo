        "text": "I am not a fan of James nor of Kris. This is an unbiased perception of how they came to this point. First, let me start with the child's (Bimby) situation.\n\nBimby might be intelligent, give credits to Kris for she raised Bimby to love learning and education. However, it does not mean he can think on his own. As a 6 year old toddler he is starting to explore what life is. Everything that he sees in the environment will be a conditioning factor of how he will act in the future. No 6 year olds will tell a thing is bad when some one close to them does it as well.\n\nKris Aquino- tagged as the Queen of All Media. However, for the past few years she has been very vocal about things that happen in her life. People tend to like her because she speaks smartly but not enough to convince people with what she can do. She is powerful, that's a well known fact. Her cries made her situation become a national issue. She's smart enough to get the sympathy of the viewing public. Add to that she is a sister to the president.\n\nJames Yap- a basketball player. Nobody can tell what he is capable of doing. He has been quiet and never bad mouth Kris. But this time, he wanted to gain the love of his son. Why, for so long, he started talking? what was the turning point of his life?\n\nAs said this is my own view of what happened.\n\nKris doesn't want Bimby to be tagged as illegitimate. Yet, that's kinda obscure because a child can't be illegitimate if the father honor him as his child. Besides they were married. Bimby was born in a wedlock, by virtue of birth, he is not and will never be an illegitimate child.So, Kris wanted to gain the sole custody of Bimby. That's what she or they did to Josh. Good thing the father of Josh didn't go out of his shell and take his son. However, not in the case of James. He wanted to become a father, even, share a few moments with him. He can visit his son, before, but because Kris was so selfish, he filed that TOP and made James get far away from them.\n\nWhy was Bimby became so aloof of his dad?\n\nConditioning. A child can't speak ill of his father because of course the father won't hurt his son. However, Kris shows his bad feelings toward James. That made Bimby, who is living with his mother, share the same feeling toward his father. Kris is vocal about her anger with James. Even us the viewer as preconditioned to hate James. But then because James seemed to be believable than her, the social networkers believed him more than Kris.\n\nAs preconditioned by his mom, any thing that the child will see can be perceived negatively. A little ouch may be considered by Bimby as hurting his mom. James who only spent little time with his son can't defend himself to his son, leaving Bimby to believe the people he is surrounded with.\n\nKris with her family.\n\nThat is something she holds on to. You can't blame her for saying about his brother Noy's 3 years of stay because that is a natural reaction for a person who is angry because she can't get what she wants. Even us do that. You can't blame her sisters to show support for her for that is also natural. So, the media must not talk about that.\n\nI was never a fan of Kris but I don't hate her. I know what she is capable of. James, for me, tell the truth. However, if James wants to prove his clear intentions, he has to give back the money of Kris. Despite the law tells that he owns a part of Kris' money, for the sake of his name, he has to give it back. Unless of course, he is really in to something else. This is because Kris bought the \"peace\", literally far from him, of her life. In economics, she buys something but didn't get what she wanted. That's the fuzz all about.\n\nKris Felt Violated?\n\nIf she felt violated, then she should have file a complain because of that violation and not in behalf of Bimby. Why ask a 6 year old toddler?\n\nNote: That peace means she will be having a life with Bimby away from him- sole custody in a sense."
