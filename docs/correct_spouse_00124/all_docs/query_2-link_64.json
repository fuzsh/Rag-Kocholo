        "text": "It took three good parents to make this heartwarming photo possible.\n\nKris Aquino’s sons Josh (her son with actor Philip Salvador) and Bimby (her son with basketball player James Yap) joined the birthday celebration of Michela “Mic” Cazzola, the Italian girlfriend of Kris’ ex-husband James Yap.\n\nJames and Michela’s baby son MJ was also at the party, of course. Kris was not able to make it due to work commitments that day, but she expressed her happiness over James and Michela’s graciousness.\n\n“Today was Mic’s birthday (same birthday as my sister Viel, my friend @harlenebau, and Ma’am Charo) & she invited Kuya Josh & Bimb to join them for her intimate, family birthday dinner,” Kris wrote on her Instagram account on Oct 27.\n\nShe said that the song Blended Family (What You do for Love) by Alicia Keys perfectly captured the day.\n\n“I know it started with a little drama; I hate that you had to read it in the paper; But everything’s over with me being your mama,” the song goes.\n\nThe good relationship between Kris and Michela was forged early on and was renewed when Kris took Bimby to see his little brother MJ last week. Kris brought flowers for Mic and toys for MJ. During that visit, Kris revealed, “Mic went out of her way to prepare carbonara for Bimb and to bake an Italian chocolate pie for our merienda.”\n\nJames and Michela also shared the special moment on their respective Instagram accounts.\n\nMichela posted this video:\n\n“Thank you Kuya Josh and Kuya Bimb for celebrating Tita Mic’s birthday with us,” James said.\n\nWhat a priceless moment for this beautiful blended family!"
