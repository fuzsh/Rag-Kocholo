        "text": "27 Nov - After Kris Aquino previously expressed her disappointment with ex-husband, James Yap, for not being involved in their son's life, it was revealed that the former couple went to their son Bimby's First Communion together.\n\nAs reported on Rappler, Kris recently revealed the new development on Instagram by posting a photo of herself with Yap, as well as good friend, Vice Ganda.\n\n\"For the love of Bimb,\" she wrote. \"Thank you James and thank you @praybeytbenjamin.\"\n\nThe actress, who previously ranted about her ex-husband's failure to respond to her invitation to Bimby's Holy Communion twice, also revealed that it was all just a misunderstanding.\n\nIn another post, where she uploaded screencaps of their text messages, Aquino explained that the issue was caused by a communication malfunction.\n\n\"The TRUE STORY: James and I have talked and I showed him my phone with no reply, and he showed me his where he replied - October 31 after I sent my second text.\n\nIt could be that I am using an iPhone and his was Samsung. I was using iMessage, my roaming was on but I turned off data roaming on that phone and relied on wifi. I checked my messages in settings & SEND AS SMS was ON. The text invitation was sent Oct 31 while we were in Hawaii.\"\n\nAquino also stated that being a divorced couple has always been difficult, but they would set aside their differences for Bimby.\n\nMeanwhile, Yap also posted a message for his son, congratulating his first Holy Communion and expressing his love for him.\n\n(Photo source: instagram.com/withlovekrisaquino)"
