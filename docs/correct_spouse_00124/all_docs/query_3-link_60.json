Kris also thanked James for being a good father figure to her eldest son, Josh.\n\nDuring Bimby's advanced 7th birthday celebration last April 8, James immediately went to Kris and greeted her when he arrived for the party. He also looked for Josh and greeted Kris' eldest sister, Ballsy Aquino-Cruz.\n\nJames said this is what he has always prayed for--for them to be okay and be friends again. Kris revealed that James texted her a week before Bimby's party to ask her what the plans are.\n\nThe eager also has his own plans for his son's birthday, but he thought it best if he will just be in the party Kris arranged. He thinks it will be the best gift for Bimby--to see both his parents together.\n\nJames also paid for half the party. When he arrived, he gave Kris a check for the payment.\n\nKris became emotional during the interview with James. She said she will always be grateful to James for marrying her and giving her a name. He had loved her enough to give a name to her son, she added.\n\nShe was able to understand it through the years that there was only pain and anger in her heart. They both made mistakes in their relationship, and James also had a hard time because of her.\n\nAt the same time, James also really hurt her, Kris said. But that's all in the past and they can be friends now, the TV host added.\n\n\"Sincere ako dun. Sana, sikapin mong kaibiganin ako. Kasi, yun ang makakabuti para kay Bimb.\"\n\nJames, on the other hand, promised to be a good father to their son and to be friends with Kris.\n\nThe TV host said Bimby is aware that he and Josh will always be number one to Kris. \"Kasi, kung matapos man ang buhay ko na sina Josh at Bimb long ang katabi ko, sobrang na-bless na ko ni God.\" Bimby is the one person who always understands her, and she sometimes doesn't even treat him as a seven-year-old.\n\nNow, Kris is relinquishing a part of Bimby's life to James. He needed to be a part of it and nothing will change that. Kris will remain true to her promise to make Bimby close to his father again.\n\nShe also thanked James for not giving up on them. \"Ibang mga lalaki, puwedeng-puwedeng sumuko na at sabihing, 'Bahala na kayo sa buhay niyo dahil ayoko na ng gulo'\"\n\nThen, Kris also revealed something about James. She said he was a good father to someone he's not related to like Josh. His family was also good to Josh and treated him as their own. She kept a picture of her, James and Josh back when James first entered the picture. He was there for her and Josh, she added.\n\nKris compared their love story to that of the movie \"Starting Over Again\" because it didn't have a happy ending, but the couple had a closure.\n\nIn the end, Kris apologized to James for all the heartaches she contributed to his life. James then said sorry also for all the pain he caused her. \"Hindi man ako naging perfect na partner mo, thank you pa rin sa 'yo na natanggap mo na ako, okay na tayo.\"\n\nMeanwhile, James was given a chance to express his feelings about Kris' revelations. He was surprised that she apologized to him. He appreciated that, especially now that they are okay.\n\nHe texted Kris about Bimby's party because he wants his son to know that his parents can be friends despite not being together anymore.\n\nWhat is his message to Bimby? \"I want you to know that I'll always be here for you. And I love you so much. Papa loves you so much.\" \"I hope, paglaki mo, makita mo 'to na ginagawa namin ng mama mo ang lahat para mapasaya ka.\"\n\nCaption: Kris Aquino\n\nCaption: James Yap"
