        "text": "Manila: TV personality and actress Kris Aquino, popular sister of President Benigno Aquino, has filed for court protection from her estranged husband, basketball star James Yap, who she accused of seducing her and losing his temper when rejected, which left their son psychologically affected, a local paper said.\n\nIn the petition, she asked a lower court in Makati City to order Yap to stay away from her, her five-year-old son James Jr or “Bimby” and any household member, at least 100 metres from her residence, school, place of employment or any place frequented by her and her son, the Inquirer said.\n\nLast December, when Yap visited their son, he entered his wife’s bedroom and made “overt sexual advances as if he was still entitled to his matrimonial rights,” said the petition.\n\nAfter rejecting him, he uttered “mean and malicious statements,” the actress narrated, adding this was followed by a heated argument, which prompted their son to intervene, and telling his father, “stop hurting my mom.”\n\nThe agitated son also told his mother, “tell him to go away”. Since then, their son has always been upset whenever he is with his father, or when he hears him over the phone, said the petition.\n\n“The physical, sexual, emotional, psychological and moral harm and injury foisted [on that day] was occasioned by the unfettered access of respondent Yap on the household and persons of the petitioners,” the actress explained in her petition.\n\nThe temporary protection order (TPO), if granted, would last for 30 days, but she has also asked for a permanent order.\n\nTPO is a provision of a law that protects women and their children from violent spouses or partners.\n\nLast year, the annulment of their marriage included a monetary and real estate settlement."
