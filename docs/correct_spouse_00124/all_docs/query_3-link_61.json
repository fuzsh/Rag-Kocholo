        "text": "She’s back in the Philippines. And not only is she back from a two-week vacation in Europe, where she met some Frenchman, she’s also back at work in her home TV network ABS-CBN.\n\nYes, she’s in the world of entertainment again, despite her tearful announcement late last month that she was quitting showbiz following a very public feud with her ex-husband, professional basketball player James Yap.\n\nOn her show ‘Kris TV’ last Monday, Aquino, a sister to President Benigno Aquino III, said she met someone in France who is older than her and will soon visit the Philippines to look for business opportunities in the real-estate industry.\n\n“He’s such a successful businessman, and he will come here in June to buy an island,” she told her cohost, Melissa Cantiveros.\n\nShe added that Bimby, her son by Yap, has approved of the Frenchman visiting her here in June.\n\n“Let’s pray,” she continued telling Cantiveros. “Let’s pray because he wants to build some buildings in the Philippines. I will pray for that because it means more jobs for more Filipinos. Pray with me, OK?”\n\nAquino reported back to work on April 5, a day after she arrived in Manila from her European tour with Bimby and her older son, Joshua, by the veteran and award-winning actor Phillip Salvador.\n\nShe reported to the live airing of ‘Pilipinas Got Talent’ (Philippines Has Got Talent) and, in the succeeding days, she was seen taping for ‘Kris TV’ and ‘Kailangan Ko’y Ikaw’ (It’s You I need). The latter is a drama series that is on its last two weeks of airing.\n\nAquino stunned the public and shocked even her home network last month when she cried her heart out on TV and said that she was going to leave the entertainment industry for good as she wanted to just take care of her kids.\n\nShe did not file a formal resignation, however, and ABS-CBN said that she still had nine months remaining in her current contract.\n\nAquino and Yap had been issued a gag order by a Makati regional trial court last month in their custody fight over the 5-year-old Bimby, or James Jr.\n\nThe same court had granted Aquino her petition for temporary protection order against Yap, whom she accused of trying to seduce her and of being an uncaring father.\n\nYap denied the allegations, and hired a top-calibre female lawyer, Lorna Kapunan, to defend him."
