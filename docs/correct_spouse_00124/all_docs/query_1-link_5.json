        "text": "29 Jun â€“ Kris Aquino is refusing the take the bait as netizens began sharing articles about ex-husband James Yap's new baby with girlfriend Michela Cazzola.\n\nAs reported on PEP, the Queen of All Media who is known for being outspoken about her personal life, recently gave mild responses to comments asking her thoughts about Yap's new baby.\n\nShe posted, \"No offense, but we've annulled [our marriage]. Life has moved forward.\"\n\nTo another commenter, she said, \"I should just stay away because the past is the past [and] I know how to respect the present.\"\n\nNetizens, who read Aquino's comments sang praises for the actress, especially since the response was a direct contract to her previous criticism of Yap, whom she accused of being negligent towards their son Bimby.\n\nYap and partner Michela Cazzola recently welcomed their baby daughter and second child, Francesca Michelle. The couple already have a son together, Michael James, born in 2016."
