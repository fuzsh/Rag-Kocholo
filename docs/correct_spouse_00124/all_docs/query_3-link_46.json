        "text": "ACTRESS and television host Kris Aquino stirred up speculations on Wednesday with her latest Instagram update that appeared to hint at a new romance.\n\nIn her post, Kris – without revealing his identity – greeted a special someone on his birthday and thanked him for coming into her life.\n\n“I thought long and hard whether to upload this because I know what kind of speculation I’ll be starting,” Kris wrote in her caption. “BUT he really did come when my grief was unbearable; he continues to give me unselfish support and comfort; he’s been around for all my ups and downs, health woes, and tears – plus Bimb likes him.”\n\n“Most of all, he makes me feel taken care of, secure, and SAFE,” she said. “So he is deserving of this birthday greeting that all of you are now seeing (care bears na kung anong iisipin ninyo). BECAUSE for me, he is #special,” she added.\n\nIn the comments section of her post, several friends of Kris expressed their happiness for the TV host, including actress Angel Locsin, designer Francis Libiran, and her lawyer friend, Atty. Gideon Peña.\n\nMeanwhile, fans were intrigued by the post. Many of them tried to guess the identity of the mystery man.\n\nKris, 50, was formerly married to basketball star James Yap – the father of Bimby, her youngest son – and was previously romantically linked to former Quezon City mayor and actor Herbert Bautista.\n\nShe was last linked to Batangas governor Mark Leviste. The two became the subject of headlines back in February after website Mega Entertainment claimed that they went out on a dinner date at a restaurant in Makati.\n\nHowever, Kris was quick to deny this, saying at that time that she is, in fact, “single, not dating, peaceful, [and just] trying to get healthier.”(Push)"
