        "text": "MANILA, Philippines - Amid the latest controversy on her shaky marriage to basketball star James Yap, Kris Aquino disclosed yesterday that she was “emotionally tired” of her relationship with her husband and that she had left the conjugal abode with her two children.\n\nInterviewed in her own TV program The Buzz, which she co-hosts with Boy Abunda, the popular actress and emcee finally broke her silence and narrated the latest episode that made her decide to “temporarily” walk out of her marriage.\n\n“I’m trying to make our marriage work, but James must also do his part. Marriage is a two-way traffic. Hindi lang ako ang dapat nagwo-work out nito (I shouldn’t only be the one working this out). He should show that he is a responsible, loving father,” Aquino said while trying to hold back tears.\n\nAquino also denied having made a scene outside the house of Mayen Austria, her husband’s rumored girlfriend, and shouting invectives at the mother outside the Austria residence in Valle Verde, Pasig City.\n\n“In my 25 years of being in the public eye, nobody can ever say that it is my nature na magmura or gumawa ng eskandalo. I didn’t shout or create a commotion. I went to their house and just wanted to express my discomfort na merong tawag ng tawag at text ng text sa asawa ko (that someone is constantly calling and texting my husband,” she said.\n\n“I wanted to tell her and show her that I am flesh and blood. Hello, ako ang misis ni James,” Aquino said, while admitting that a cousin had advised her not to go to Mayen’s house because she (Kris) is popular.\n\nThe problem started after Aquino reportedly confronted her husband about the girl who was crying while talking to him on the phone.\n\n“A little discussion (not an argument) followed during which James told Kris that the girl was having a problem with her boyfriend (somebody else) and that the girl has been his long-time (Purefoods) fan. Like any puzzled wife, Kris asked James, ‘Why would she be crying on your shoulder, for that matter, on a man she knows very well who is very much married?’” The STAR entertainment editor and columnist Ricky Lo wrote in his column last Friday, quoting an unnamed source.\n\nApparently, the same source said that the girl had been sending James chocolates, cakes or other goodies addressed only to him, which made Aquino suspicious.\n\nAfter receiving a “forwarded” text message purportedly from James who was telling the girl to just say sorry to Kris “at ng matapos na ang lahat,” the same source said Aquino decided to drop by the girl’s house.\n\n“The girl’s mom very nicely met her. Kris turned down the mom’s invitation to ‘come in’ and simply, very politely, told the mom the whole incident. Kris never raised her voice. She was calm as she reminded the mom that she and James are working very hard at saving the marriage and calls or texts messages from ‘any girl’ to James are the last thing that they wanted especially at this stage when they have just patched things up,” Lo narrated in his column, quoting the same source.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel’s back\n\nBut things were not the same in the Austrias’ view.\n\nRight after the incident, text messages presumably coming from Mayen started circulating.\n\n“To everyone. Kris Aquino passed by the house to make me sugod. She spoke to my mom. Very mad, berating us saying I always text and call James. That my mom didn’t bring me up right. That we shouldn’t be talking to married men. She said she’s leaving James and to know that I’m the last straw and the reason for their break-up,” Mayen’s text message read.\n\nAustria added that they have great respect for the Teopacos, who are their family friend. Mrs. Teopaco is former President Cory Aquino’s youngest sister.\n\nAn identified source said that Kris indeed went to the Austria house and confronted Mayen. When the mother allegedly went out after hearing the commotion, Aquino also shouted at her.\n\n“Anong klaseng nanay ka? Anong klaseng palaki mo sa anak mo? (What kind of mother are you? What kind of upbringing did you give your child),” the source was quoted as hearing.\n\nAll about love and respect\n\nHowever, Aquino said that there was no commotion and that she just did what every wife should do.\n\nShe narrated in detail what took place and defended her action. She also expressed pain in her decision to leave her home and temporarily stay at her sister Pinky’s house together with her children.\n\n“James should make me feel naman that he loves me, respects me. Siguro kahit sino namang wife gusto yun,” she said. (Any wife would want some love and respect).\n\nThe controversial actress also justified why she broke her silence and her decision to defend her brother, Sen. Benigno Aquino III, who was being dragged into the picture for political reasons.\n\n“You cannot blame me for wanting to defend Noy and you cannot blame me for wanting to defend my marriage,” she said.\n\nAquino and her husband just survived a “lover’s quarrel” during the holidays and had reportedly patched up their differences during a family trip to Bangkok.\n\nIn 2007, Kris and James also made headlines when Yap was rumored to be having a romantic liaison with Hope Centeno, one of the Belo Medical Clinic’s receptionists.\n\nNo connection to politics\n\nMeanwhile, Senator Aquino has appealed to media and the public to give his youngest sister time to sort out her personal problems.\n\nHe maintained that his sister’s problem is not connected in any way to his candidacy and capacity to lead the country. He also apologized for not being too “showbiz” about it.\n\nBut Yap and his family seemed unfazed by the controversy. The basketball star was seen spending quality time with his son after a commercial shoot.\n\nHis parents also refused to be affected by the negative reports about their son and daughter-in-law.\n\nYap’s mother Annie made a similar appeal to put a stop to rumors about her son and daughter-in-law.\n\nMrs. Yap belied reports that her son has another woman, adding that politics could be behind the spread of negative reports about her family particularly since James’ father is running for a political post in Negros."
