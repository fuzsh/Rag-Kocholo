        "text": "Have basketeer-turned San Juan aldèrman James Yap and Italian wife Michela Cazzola broken up?\n\nWhile this is Cristy Fermin’s latest buzz on Showbiz Now Na, she hopes there’s hardly any tinge of truth to it.\n\nHowever, a fellow scribe has long before gotten wind of the separation based on the absence of James’ recent posts on Instagram.\n\nJames’ last posts included photos taken of him with his wife and two kids MJ and Francesca in April 2023.\n\nThis was followed by his birthday greeting to Michela in October.\n\nJames, however, didn’t let this last June slip by without greeting his daughter on her 6th birthday.\n\nIn between, all that James’ IG posts were his photos taken outside the country.\n\nStill, according to unconfirmed reports, the couple’s separation resulted in Michela’s bringing her kids to her native Italy leaving James behind.\n\nIf true, the James-Michela marital falling out reminds showbiz of exactly the same scenario involving Paolo Contis and LJ Reyes.\n\nBack in 2022, LJ broke up with Paolo and left for New York in a huff with their only child Summer.\n\nLJ likewise brought her son Aki by Paulo Avelino.\n\nMeanwhile, James’ former partner Kris Aquino has long before become friends with Michela.\n\nPrior to her US trip to seek medical treatment, Kris and Michela used to exchange pleasantries once in a while, catching up with each other’s life acrivities.\n\nAt present, Bimby–Kris’ son by James–is in town. James is expected to keep tabs with Bimby.\n\nIt is uncertain though if Bimby is just as eager and excited to see his dad."
