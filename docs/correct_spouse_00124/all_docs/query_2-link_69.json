        "text": "MANILA, Philippines (The Adobo Chronicles) – The most eligible bachelor of the Philippines, President NoyNoy Aquino, says he is ready for marriage, adding: “If the right one comes along, why not?”\n\nEarly this year, the 56-year-old Aquino was rumored to be dating 26-year-old Pia Wurtzbach, the reigning Miss Philippines-Universe, after both were spotted dining in a Quezon City restaurant with a large group of friends and colleagues.\n\nAquino did not specify the gender of the person he wants to bring to the presidential palace (Malacañang) before his term expires in 2016, but everyone assumes it would be female since same-sex marriage is not legal in the Philippines. (But look at that pinky in photo above)\n\nIs marriage ready for Aquino?\n\nMANILA, Philippines (The Adobo Chronicles® ) – If it weren’t for the statute of limitations and American comedian Bill Cosby would be charged for alleged multiple rapes he committed, his only way out would be in the Philippines. By marrying his accusers.\n\nRepublic Act 8353 (The Anti-Rape Law of 1997), absolves the rapist from criminal liability on the condition that the offender marries the victim.\n\nA provision in the law states:\n\n“The subsequent valid marriage between the offended party shall extinguish the criminal action or the penalty imposed. In case it is the legal husband who is the offender, the subsequent forgiveness by the wife as the offended party shall extinguish the criminal action or the penalty: Provided, that the crime shall not be extinguished or the penalty shall not be abated if the marriage is void ab initio.”\n\nSo, Cosby would be free of rape charges by moving to the Philippines.\n\nBut not so fast.\n\nCosby cannot marry all his accusers. Polygamy is not legal in the Philippines. In fact, it is one of the grounds for the exclusion of foreigners in the coutry’s immigration law.\n\nAnother big hurdle? Divorce is not legal in the Philippines either. The country is the only one remaining in the world, besides The Vatican, where divorce is not allowed.\n\nSo, if charged, Cosby will have to find another way out. ."
