        "text": "Divorce?not annulment?anyway, if that is what Kris really wanted to do right now so be it, maybe Kris really wanted to get out because the marriage given her so much misery. It is also very agonizing on the part of Kris is she will continue to pretend that everything is okay when it is not. I don't think it is right to remain in the union just because of kids, it is going to be miserable and kids will be affected anyway if the couple will continue fighting each other. Kris should go with her happiness, anyway we live only once so we have to find things and do things which can make us happy. But next time, Kris should be cautious in entering into relationships so that she will not be stumbled again.\n\nYes I guess he has failed to restore back his family and would end up being divorced with. I just do not know if the divorce thing would be valid since we do not have divorce here in the Philippines. I just forgot if they got married abroad since if it is then they could really file a divorce anytime I guess and their marriage will be voided in here. I do not know with Kris but I guess she does not really want a long term relationships with men. If we would look at her past he had two old and matured men around her and after sometime she dumped them both for some reasons. I thought she already got contented with James being young but it seems Kris found some reasons for her to quit the relationship just like that. In the past two relationship I think she was looking for a father figure from them that is why she got involve with mature men. If we try look at her past life, she practically grew up with no father figure since her father at that time was imprisoned and when they got exiled it was very short time they got together and spent some time with each other. When she got involved with James I think her family chose this guy since they found him to be eligible already to be with her and the family ended like they were forcing the two to be married since this is the practical thing to do to make the family looked good since she was the only daughter that has had many controversial relationships. But then and again she made this another failed relationship one more time despite her family trying to patch things up.\n\nDid really James Yap done anything to save the marriage, he just read a statement that he will fight for his family but nothing happened after that. James Yap already establish a name being a basketball player even before she met Kris, for sure he will still reign in basketball without Kris, I don't feel sorry for him. Anything that happened to their relationship maybe is quiet personal and I don't care much of it. I hope the children do not suffer a lot and James will be given a visitation rights to visit his son and also Joshua. And to Kris, I don't care a lot about her.\n\nAt some point I never really liked Kris to begin with. First of all, her tactless attitude on and off cam. It's noticeable in previous shows she was in how she, i don't know if was on purpose or she really is just like that, that she would drop remarks so off key, that you'd catch a few in the audience or at most her co host smirk at the most often insulting remarks. Clueless of her actions, consequences occur because of that. Just take for example between her and Ruffa G. Though both parties tried to shy away from a controversy that Kris was the main reason why she left a particular talk show, this just shows how Kris is around people. Oh well, too far from the topic? Yeah, but this brings me back to my opinion on James and Kris. I really wondered, what made James fall for Kris in the first place. Every public personality exudes a facade. I just am guessing that what they show might also be how they are in their personal lives. I am no psychologist but I do think that is a fair reason to claim. Anyway, we only have opinions for what these public personalities show on televisions and in interviews. That is as far I think I could give an opinion on James and Kris. Whatever might or might not have been done to save a marriage, is off limits already to the audiences or public. To do so would be becoming judgmental and totally irresponsible of saying things about a matter one knows little of.\n\nYou are definitely right. Whatever we say about their relationship, in the end, it is still their decision. There is always two sides of a coin. Whoever is at fault, it is not our business to meddle on. They are not really compatible like other celebrity relationships have, to add their age difference and personalities. Lately, I heard news about the possible cause of the break up. But nothing has been confirmed. It is in fact a controversy that people always want to find out and being intrigued about."
