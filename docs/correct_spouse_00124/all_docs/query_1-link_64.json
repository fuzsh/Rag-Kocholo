        "text": "ALTHOUGH visibly surprised to find an unlikely ally in Kris Aquino, San Mig star James Yap nonetheless thanked his ex-wife for leaping to his defense in the face of criticism he received from bashers after the Mixers' Game Six loss to Ginebra in the PBA Philippine Cup semifinals.\n\nAquino defended Yap from online game-fixing allegations during her new talk show 'Aquino and Abunda Tonight' with Boy Abunda on Tuesday, stressing that in the many years she has known her ex-husband, she’s convinced that the San Mig star will never do such a thing.\n\n“Sa matagal na panahon na kilala ko si James Yap, at nakilala ko ang buong pagkatao niya, hindi niya gagawing magbenta ng laro dahil buong buhay niya, ibinuhos niya for that (basketball),” Kris was quoted as saying in her new TV show.\n\nKris was quick to add with a smile: “He’s (Yap) gonna love me for this. Matutuwa siya dito sa sinasabing kong ‘to.”\n\n(For full story of sister site Pep.ph, click here)\n\nThe gesture came as a surprise for Yap, considering the two celebrated figures had a tumultuous marriage that led to an annulment two years ago. Their son, Bimby, is now a movie star and top endorser.\n\nStill, Yap said he appreciated the gesture from his ex-wife.\n\n“Ah, thank you at pinagtanggol niya (Kris) ako,\" said Yap, who came under fire from bashers for his foul on Mark Caguioa and a missed three-point shot from way out in a 91-94 loss to Ginebra on Monday night. \"Nagulat ako (sa gesture ni Kris), anong meron?”\n\nStill, the two-time league MVP said he is already used to copping flak from critics in the 10 years that he has been a pro player.\n\n“Sanayan lang kasi kapag ikaw yung isang player na inaasahan sa team, di naman natin mapi-please ang lahat ng tao,” explained the pride of Escalante, Negros Occidental, who is turning 32 on Saturday.\n\n“Natural 'yan eh (bashers and criticisms). Basta focus ka lang at huwag mo pansinin yung mga nagba-bash. Ganun lang, move on then practice ka lang,” he added.\n\nThe former University of the East star also redeemed himself in a big way on Wednesday night, hitting a season-high 30 points behind seven three-pointers as San Mig beat Ginebra in Game Seven, 110-87, to reach the PBA Philippine Cup Finals against Rain or Shine."
