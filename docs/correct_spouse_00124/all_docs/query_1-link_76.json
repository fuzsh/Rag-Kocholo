        "text": "Manila: Popular TV host Kris Aquino has decided to stay with her mother in suburban Quezon City.\n\nHer husband James Yap, a basketball star, has remained at the couple's apartment in Makati City's posh Oakwood Condominium.\n\n\"I want space, emotionally and physically,\" Kris said on TV.\n\nThe Inquirer claimed that she has gone home to the house of former President Corazon Aquino, who is now busy campaigning for her son Benigno Junior \"Noynoy\", a senatorial candidate of the opposition.\n\nAffair with Hope\n\nEarlier, Kris said, \"We're still staying together [in Oakwood], but Joshua [her 12-year-old son with estranged lover, actor Philip Salvador] sleeps between us.\"\n\nLast week, Yap had admitted that Kris asked him to leave their apartment when the media feasted on his alleged 11-month affair with Hope, a former secretary of a beauty clinic.\n\n\"I am trying to be strong for my children,\" said Kris, adding, \"My mom advised me that my responsibility now is, first, to Joshua and my baby, second, to myself, and third, to preserve my family.\n\n\"She also said I should not give the impression that I have closed doors [on James].\n\n\"I am trying my best not to judge [my husband].\n\n\"[I am still asking myself] Who will I believe, the one who promised to love me, or the one who only wants to destroy me? Give us time to decide on this [issue]. Whatever our decision is, maybe that is the right one,\" said Kris.\n\nKris who is seven-month pregnant and due to give birth by Caesarian-section in early May, vowed that she will not change James, the name that she and her son have chosen for the coming baby boy.\n\n\"If my husband decides to accompany me in the operating room, I will not stop him. I will not deprive him from his role as the father of baby James,\" Kris said.\n\n\"I don't want what happened to Joshua who did not develop an attachment with Ipe [Phillip's nickname] because I prevented it,\" said Kris.\n\nFather figure\n\nShe said her son was looking for a father figure and became very close with James when the latter was courting her.\n\nThey were married in a secret garden wedding, at the house of fellow TV host Boy Abunda in early 2006.\n\nKris admitted that she has survived false labour after GMA-7, a TV network which is rival to her home studio, the ABS CBN, aired an exclusive interview with Hope."
