        "text": "And after all the speculations and the wild rumors and the endless guessing games, with the lips of the pair involved sealed with an enigmatic smile, it is confirmed (yes, beyond any reasonable doubt) that Kris Aquino and James Yap did get married not on the date  May 31, 2005  according to the persistent speculations and wild rumors and the endless guessing game but on July 10, 2005 in Quezon City, all right, but not at the Quezon City Hall. According to \"certificate of marriage,\" the civil marriage was solemnized in the \"house of Eugenio Boy Abunda.\"\n\nA few issues ago, Funfare mentioned in passing that Kris and James did fill up an application form for a marriage contract on May 31, 2005 but the supposed \"secret\" civil marriage was allegedly not registered upon the request of somebody close to Kris. This piece of information was never confirmed.\n\nAccompanying this story is a copy of the authentic \"certificate of marriage\" dated July 10, 2005, furnished Funfare by a DPA from the National Statistics Office (NSO).\n\nThe entries read:\n\n Province: Metro Manila\n\n City/Municipality: Quezon City\n\n Registry No. 2005-13786\n\n Names of Contracting Parties - Husband: James Carlos A. Yap\n\n Date of Birth/Age: 15, February 1982, 23 years old\n\n Place of Birth: Escalante, Negros Occidental\n\n Sex: Male\n\n Citizenship: Filipino\n\n Residence: Quezon City\n\n Religion: Roman Catholic\n\n Civil Status: Single\n\n Name of Father: Carlos Relate Yap\n\n Citizenship: Filipino\n\n Name of Mother: Annie S. Agravante\n\n Citizenship: Filipino\n\n Person Who Gave Consent or Advice: Carlos R. Yap\n\n Residence: Escalante, Negros Occidental\n\n Wife: Kristina Bernadette C . Aquino\n\n Date of Birth/Age: 14 February 1971, 34 years old\n\n Place of Birth: Manila City\n\n Sex: Female\n\n Citizenship: Filipino\n\n Residence: Times Street, Quezon City\n\n Religion: Roman Catholic\n\n Civil Status: Single\n\n Name of Father: Benigno A. Aquino\n\n Citizenship: Filipino\n\n Name of Mother: Corazon S. Cojuangco\n\n Citizenship: Filipino\n\n Person Who Gave Consent or Advice: N.A. (Not Applicable)\n\n Citizenship: N.A.\n\n Residence: N.A.\n\n Place of Marriage: House of Eugenio \"Boy\" Abunda\n\n Address: Quezon City\n\n Date: 10th July 2005, 9:00 p.m.\n\n Marriage License No. 202545, issued on June 10, 2005 in Quezon City\n\n Witnesses: Eugenio \"Boy\" Abunda and Ronald Stephen Monteverde\n\nThe civil wedding was solemnized by (Pastor) Rayda Perez Tumaliuan and entered in the Civil Registry on July 11, 2005.\n\nContacted for comment, the usually loquacious Boy Abunda (my fellow Waray-Waray from Samar) was unusually mum. His silence was pregnant with a thousand words.\n\nBut according to my DPA in \"The House of Eugenio Boy Abunda\"  was it the nosey, playful little mouse under the squeaky chair?  the civil wedding was very solemn though very casual. Kris and James came in ordinary clothes. After they were pronounced man and wife by Pastor Tumaliuan, they kissed, much to the amusement of the two witnesses and a handful of other... kibitzers? Then, the newly-weds and company partook of pancit and kare-kare specially prepared by Boy.\n\n\"It was a wonderful, wonderful affair,\" squeaked the nosey, playful little mouse under the squeaky chair. \"It was very simple, nakakaiyak. Kris and James made a solemn vow to each other. Boy Abunda and Ronald Dondon Monteverde gave the couple pieces of advice. Kris and James were teary-eyed. They were a picture of two people very much in love.\"\n\nWas it a spur-of-the moment thing?\n\n\"No, not at all,\" said the little mouse under the squeaky chair. \"It was well planned but very secret. Imagine, Kris and James, their witnesses and the others present at the affair, including a cousin of James, have been able to keep the whole thing a secret for eight months!\"\n\nThe couple planned to get married in church last Feb. 14, Kris birthday, but they moved it to December this year because, according to Kris in a Funfare interview, she still has commitments to fulfill with Star Cinema and Regal Films until end of this year.\n\n\"I promised James that I would stop making movies after we got married,\" said Kris. \"But I wont stop doing TV because thats my bread and butter.\"\n\nNow, they plan to get married in church early next year.\n\nIm sure Tita Cory (Aquino) is happy with Kris choice for a husband. Despite his alleged colorful love life, James is single and highly-eligible. He is a quiet guy with his own disposition and his own \"strength,\" meaning he can put the irrepressible Kris in place. He has his own source of livelihood (making his own millions as a star player of Purefoods), his own identity and a big star in his own right. In short, he wont be, unlike the other men in Kris life, \"Mr. Kris Aquino.\" But she will definitely be, as she is now, \"Mrs. James Yap.\"\n\nSo what else and what more can I say?\n\nIm happy for you, Kris. Youve finally found Mr. Right. You and James are perfect for each other, right for each other. He has become a loving and caring father to your son, Joshua, and a loving and caring (but not \"submissive\" as many people suspect; tahimik lang ngunit... mapanganib?) husband to you  and oozing with machismo at that!\n\nAgain, as the Chinese would say, may you have a hundred years of blissful \"wedded\" togetherness!\n\nWhats up?\n\n Oops! No. 1: Bruce Willis did frontal nudity in Color of the Night (1994) and not in Color Purple (starring Whoopi Goldberg) as wrongly mentioned in last Sundays Conversations with Dennis Trillo.\n\n Oops! No. 2: In the story about Vilma Santos Roman holiday, Fontana D Trevi should be written \"Fontana Di Trevi.\" In the caption, one picture shows Vilma, husband Ralph Recto and their son Ryan Christian with a man dressed like a soldier of the Roman Empire and not with a Swiss guard, taken at the Colosseo and not at The Vatican. In another picture, the entourage was photographed with the Spanish Steps at the backgrounsd and not the Fontana Di Trevi.\n\n Oops! No. 3: Readers \"Don\" and Andrew Vergara pointed out that the French phrase comme dhabitude is an idiomatic expression which translates into \"as usual\" and not \"like the habit\" as Funfare quoted Pete Lacaba in his rejoinder to the item abourt the song My Way, originally a French song of which Paul did an English adaptation popularized by Frank Sinatra.\n\n* * *\n\nE-mail reactions at [email protected]"
