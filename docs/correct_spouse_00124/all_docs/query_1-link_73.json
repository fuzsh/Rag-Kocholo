She was supposed to fly to Cebu with her co-host on “SNN” and “The Buzz” who is “Boy Abunda” for her promise when she was with her brother “Noynoy” the presidents elect that she will give a help to selected children by distributing school supplies but she wasn’t arrive. This is because James and Kris were in a quarrel the night before.\n\nOn Kris interview with Boy on The Buzz she said that she did everything just to make their relationship last long but unfortunately what she did wasn’t helpful enough. She said that it’s all over; their relationship with James was over Kris already given up.\n\nOn that night also Kris was made her goodbye to all of her talk show on ABS-CBN. This is one also of Kris promise to her sisters and her brother “Noy”.\n\n8.453903 124.619270"
