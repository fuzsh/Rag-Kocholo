        "text": "KRIS Aquino refused to be provoked into issuing a negative reaction to recent news that James Yap’s girlfriend Michela Cazzola has given birth to their second baby.\n\nThis was after a netizen left a link of a news article about James’s growing family on Kris’s Instagram account.\n\nMichela gave birth to her and James’s daughter Francesca Michelle on June 27.\n\nThey also have a son, Michael James, who is turning two on Aug. 8.\n\nAddressing the netizen, Kris responded, “@lahlyntimosv no offense BUT annulled na kami. Life has moved forward.”\n\nKris married James on July 10, 2005; but they separated in June 2010 and got their marriage annulled by February 2012.\n\nJames reportedly met Michela in 2011, but only began dating in August 2012.\n\nThe same netizen also tried to pit Kris against Michela, “Ang layo mo sa asawa ni James tahimik at Hindi pa pansin. Lol”\n\nThe netizen’s comment seemed to be a shade against Kris who is known for being outspoken and whose life is an open book to the public, contrary to Michela who pretty much leads a private life except for occasional media appearances with James.\n\nBut Kris refused to take the bait and kept her response on a positive note:\n\n“@lahlyntimosv dapat lang po lumayo ako kasi the past is the past & i know how to respect the present.”\n\nIn a separate exchange of comments, Kris acknowledged a netizen’s observation that her son Bimby got his good looks from both her and James.\n\nKris wrote, “@princessmqu not offended at all… basta pinuri ang anak ko-i’m happy.”\n\nThat Kris kept her cool was a direct contrast to when she lashed out at James’s “hypocrisy” after he greeted their son Bimby on the latter’s 11th birthday last April.\n\nAdmittedly airing their “dirty laundry” on social media, Kris took offense with James’s alleged lack of financial support, negligence, and indifference especially at times when Bimby needed his protection the most.\n\nShe also revealed that Bimby and James’s father-son relationship had been damaged since the basketball player issued hurtful words toward the kid during the ex-couple’s court battle for child custody years ago.\n\nJames, however, refused to respond to Kris’s allegations.\n\nKris eventually opted to move forward, saying that she is a mother who refuses to “shiver, quiver, or waver” when her children are at stake.
