        "text": "MANILA, Philippines – On what would have been their 13th wedding anniversary, actress and host Kris Aquino wished ex-husband James Yap “peace and lasting happiness.”\n\nIn a Instagram post on Tuesday, July 10, Kris wrote: “Thirteen years ago today we made a commitment, BUT fate took us in different directions. Yet together we produced one of my two greatest achievements aka BIMB… I sincerely wish you and your growing family peace & lasting happiness.”\n\nThe message was accompanied with images showing two inspirational quotes.\n\nThe two were married in July 2005 at television host Boy Abunda’s house. They have a son, Bimby, who is now 11.\n\nAfter 5 years of marriage, the two separated. Their annulment was finalized in 2012.\n\nKris and James’ relationship has been tricky. Back in April, it made headlines after Kris called James out for the way he was treating their son.\n\nThe “Queen of All Media” has since said she no longer has issues with James and added that she acted strongly in the past because she was a mother.
