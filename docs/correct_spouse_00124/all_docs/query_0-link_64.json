        "text": "The professional basketball player James Yap may have scored well against a formidable opponent, but still it was his ex-wife, Kris Aquino, who stunned the public and shocked even her home TV Network, ABS-CBN.\n\nThe actress-TV host, who is also a sister to President Benigno Aquino III, has said she was resigning from ABS-CBN, where she has three ongoing (including pre-taping) shows.\n\nIn the meantime, you would no longer hear more of this controversy, which has gripped the country the past few days, as a Makati City court issued a gag order against Aquino and Yap in their custody fight over their 5-year-old son, James Jr.\n\nJudge Liza Marie Picardal-Tecson, of the Makati regional trial court Branch 144, issued the ruling on Friday in a hearing on the hold-departure order filed by Yap against Aquino, who has plans to bring their kid, nicknamed Bimby, to Paris for a vacation this Holy Week.\n\nDays before Yap filed his petition, the same court granted Aquino her petition for temporary protection order (TPO) against Yap, who is ordered for 30 days to stay away from Aquino and Bimby for at least 100 metres anywhere they may be in the country.\n\nYap said he could not accept charges of attempted rape as alleged by Aquino, whom he also said has brainwashed their child to think of him as an uncaring father.\n\nOn Thursday evening, Aquino announced on ‘TV Patrol’ her resignation from showbiz, saying she wanted to spare her children (she has another son by the actor Phillip Salvador) from all the public attention she was getting as an entertainment personality.\n\n“Everyone’s shocked about what happened,” an unnamed source today told the Philippine Daily Inquirer.\n\nBesides being the host of the lifestyle morning show, ‘Kris TV’, Aquino also appears on primetime drama series, ‘Kailangan Ko’y Ikaw’ (What I need Is You), and was scheduled to sit as judge in a weekly reality talent contest, ‘Pilipinas Got Talent 4’ (Philippines Has Got Talent, Season 4), whose first live episode airs on April 6.\n\nAs of today, it wasn’t clear whether Aquino, who still has nine months remaining in her current contract with ABS-CBN, has already filed a formal resignation with her mother network.\n\nChiz fights for Heart\n\n“Being rich doesn’t give you the licence to look down on others.”\n\nThis was the message of reelectionist Senator Francis ‘Chiz’ Escudero to the parents of his girlfriend of eight months, the actress Heart Evangelista.\n\nIn an election sortie in Naga City, an independent component city of the Bicol Region, Escudero held a press conference to air his side in the ongoing family feud between Evangelista, whose real name is Love Marie Payawal Ongpauco, and her parents.\n\nEscudero issued the statement after reports that he has just been riding on Evangelista’s popularity to gain more votes, and that her family didn’t like him for her because he didn’t have the same social status as them, and that he was arrogant and disrespectful towards her parents.\n\nHe said he didn’t have plans to retort to the statements issued by Evangelista’s parents even if he was hurting inside, but changed his mind later on because the issue has been affecting his children from a previous marriage.\n\n“I’ve tried to understand Heart’s parents, but what they are doing to me and to Heart is no longer right,” stressed Escudero, saying that his love for Evangelita remains, and that he will continue to fight for their relationship.\n\nEvangelista’s parents have issued a statement to the public saying they were considering filing legal cases against Escudero for his arrogance and disrespectful behaviour, and for “incriminating an innocent person”.\n\nThe last supposed complaint must have something to do with Mr and Mrs Ongpauco’s statement on Escudero trying to poison Evangelista’s mind to defy her parents for him.\n\nCecille Ongpauco, Evangelista’s mother, was especially hurt when her daughter issued a public statement which said that she would no longer obey her parents when it came to matters of the heart as she was, at 28, already old enough to decide what was best for her.\n\nThe mother said it must be Escudero who had drafted that statement signed by Evangelista, whom she said was also being pressured by the senator to drop her mother as her talent manager.\n\nOngpauco also said that Escudero, whom she has accused of living off her daughter’s resources, including a condominium unit and a Mercedes Benz car, did not even acknowledge her presence every time their paths crossed. She also did not approve of his drinking and arrogance, especially when he said that he would be the president of the Philippines in 2016.\n\nEvangelista, whom days ago said she was standing by Escudero, has not issued any more statement on the ongoing controversy.\n\nFollow Emirates 24|7 on Google News."
