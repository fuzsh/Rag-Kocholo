It doesn’t have to be a lot, but give us a time of year, and let us know where and when we are. If we’re in a house or apartment, show us what the place looks like.\n\nJumpstart: Come up with a list of names for your hero and/or heroine and villain for a variety of genres — historical, science fiction, fantasy, romance, etc. Why did you choose those names? Write a brief character sketch for each."
