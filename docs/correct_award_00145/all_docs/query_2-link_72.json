Way, USN, ROA, 21)267, Pentagon Subjects Intelligence Value of German Scientists in the Atomic Energy Field. - 1. With reference to discussions betwee CIA and Colonel-Rommus of-JI01 it is believed a clarification of the U. S. position on German scientific per. sonnel in the field of atomic energy is in order. 2. Heretofore the emphsois in dealing with German scientific- pereonnel-has been on denial of their talents to potentielenemies_ and exploitation of their talents by the U. S. or friendly powers. Other considerations which exist may now be of greater important.. _ than the previous objectives. These considerations ars (1) that of their educational -value to Germany and. (2) that of their positive intelligence value. It is believed that the consensus . now is that these Germans ctruld-be of little assistance to the U. S. in the field of atomic smell:, thoUgh they might, within a certain-range of pasibilitisei-contribute-materially tL a foreign program. But even in the latter case, they-could not advance such a program-beyond a certain minimum tisk, limit. Also, from a political and -economic standpoint they could it seems, be of great value to the U. S. in its long-range objective of building up 4 eelf.abfficient Germ, Consequently :1 woA recommend that more emphasis be plated upon them primarily as potential Approved.for Rease r.)?,te N 4243 3 - Approved for Release: 2022/06/22 C00010786 Approved for Release: 2022/06/22 C00010786 sources of positive intelligence and in reconstitution of German science and economy, 1,3 0) Qi,2 If this course is adopted the question of restraint becomes subordinated, and attractiveness of a possible foreign contract largely disappears. 3. Considering only the field of atomic energy and limiting the number of individuals to the minimum to reduce the work load and enhance security, the attached list is submitted. The indi.= viduals named appear to be the best intelligence leads for a combination of reaeons: political tendencies, age, scientific ability, degree in whith they will attract friends, correspondence, etc, It will be noted that a number of the individuals were not included in the J101.

Also, a few individuals of the group which was collected _during and immediately after_the_collapse of Germany are not included. _ m 2 834021-3 Approved for Release: 2022/06/22 C00010786 Approved for Release: 2022/06/22 C00010786 Inele List v WALTER C.

Before his evacuation he was promised an institute, apartment, food, literature, and favorable research conditions in the U.S. Zone. Upon a-riving in the U.S. Zone he was held in a camp in Wuerttemberg for about 1* years. It was reported that the food he received was bad, literature and any other aid was simply not forthcoming. It is understood that Professor Scheuer was e menber of 11SDAP. Later Professor Scheyer was moved to Goettingen where he had 9 sq. neters of living and working space with his wife and two children, but otherwise no improvement in his situation. Several weeks ago information was received that Professor Scheuer planned to return to the Russian Zone. This_inforaation is now confirmed. Professor Scheuer has moved to Rehbraecke in Potsdam with all his assistants. Ee has there received, a complete institute, with all material necessary, including all the furnituze he_wantsa and more than adequate living quarters. It is reported that the institate, with_20 assistants, is beginning to work very well. Professor Scheuer has now taken up_contact with former colleagues of his in Stuttgart, who suffered from the same_difficulties and who will probably now join him. The Russians have bent over backward to fill any and all of Professor- Scheueris needs. Glass, for instance, which apparently he netded-in consi6ervole a.roant in the \"oe,finninG, has been made available at once. Professor Scheuer is still not pro-Russian_batahe_feels that at_hie tiae-ofa life he cannot afford to sitlidle_for_so -aanyayears-and it isamore-importaet-- that he work, ratherAhan_for whom he works. flashingtoa Comaent: Facts similar to the above are beginning to be very well known in Berlin scientific circles. As discussed betueen German scientists. the general comment ielmade that the Western Powers are much nicer but actually are still following a strong tendency not to let research grow too important in Germany. In spite of being informed repeatedly what the Western Powers bave done for the reestablishment of German research, Germ Na scientists feel that individual scientists are still unable to obtain decent living quarters, dec.?nt research space, or enough help in the way of foreign publications and other necessary material. Such things as the reestablishment of the Max Planck Society are apireciated but do not solve the questions just mentioned. More pOsitive steps to aid individual-scientists will be necessary if the entire group of highly intellectual Germans are_to remain as favorably disposed to the U.S. as seems desirable. The case mentioned in the report-is not the first instance in which this - sort of thing has happened, but is of enough significance and importance to be brought to the attention of appropriate authorities in Washington. It may be recalled that a great nImber-of-scientists were taken out of the State of Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt at the time this territory was turned over to the Russian forces. These scientists have:been in the West ever since, but a no great attention was given to their employment, feeding and housing. _They- Approved for Release Date, .2_ 14tiv b Approved for Release: 2022/06/22 C00010786 Approved for Release: 2022/06/22 C00010786 are included on the denial list but the whole policy towards them has been negative, rather than positive, in caring for them and seeine that they are fully occupied. Added to this list are some 200 top scientists in the American Zone which are included under the denial list recently published by the War Department. Although all these scientists can be included in the category which would make it undesirable for then to work for the Russians, there is nothin6 to stop them from crossin the zonal boundary and acceptini2 Russian eLlployment as hapened in the case of Professor Scheer.)

KOBER, Charles Kober, former chief of the development section of Gems, and a centi- meter wave specialist, was last reported (Aug 47) as under contract to the French at St. Raphael Institute,-Cote d'Aaur. At Gene Kober had worked in collaboration with rrofessors Aigner and Blank on plans to install an electric steering control to correct all deviations of a Y-2 projectile away from a high frequency beam. He designed a mechanism which would use a 12-megawatt transmitter and which was considered interference-proof. In addition to his work on high frequency apparatus and Y-2 steering devices, Gber did research OA the utilization of shorter wave lengths and in the construction of trans- - mitters with maximal output.
