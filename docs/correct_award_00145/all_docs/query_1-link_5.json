        "text": "February 3, 2020\n\nTo broaden my literary horizons, a few years ago I decided to take on the writings of the Nobel Laureates for Literature which allows me to dive into the works of celebrated foreign authors in numerous disciplines.\n\nI just completed the selected works of Rudolph Eucken from the Nobel Library. He was a German philosopher of the latter part of the 18th and early 19th century who focused on ethics. He was awarded the Nobel in 1908 \"in recognition of his earnest search for truth, his penetrating power of thought, his wide range of vision, and the warmth and strength in presentation with which in his numerous works he has vindicated and developed an idealistic philosophy of life.\"\n\nOne of the featured works in the Nobel Library was his essay \"Ethics and Modern Thought: A Theory on Their Relations\" penned months before his Nobel Prize. In it, he expounded on the evolving nature of ethics and the effects of the growing cultural impact of evolution and the waning influence of religion. At the time of his writing, the world was primarily controlled by Christian and Muslim Empires who were steadily waning in influence over the lands and people over whom they reign culminating in The Great War.\n\nWhat amazed me was the idealistic light in which he viewed the feisty North American democracy which, though still a growing power, was asserting an influence on the world by seeking to be a moral force for good. In light of how our global standing has greatly diminished, it is heartening to see how we were once heralded as such paragons of morality. From Eucken's essay:\n\n\"What is true of mankind in general, is especially true of America. The multitude of great problems cannot discourage a nation which feels in itself so much youthful vigour, that it will not submit to a dark fate, but is able and ready to mould its own fate, and aspire to yet greater heights than it has hitherto attained. But to achieve this, moral force is as necessary as unshaken confidence in the power of the spirit. We believe in a bright future for this country. We believe also in the development in America of such moral strength as will successfully overcome all conflicts and lead to splendid results, for the benefit of not only the American nation, but all of mankind.\"\n\nTo a world awash in power but sorely lacking in leadership, once upon a time, America conjured up the image of a leader on the rise. And true to the prediction, we were, for a time, a nation lead by morals and principles striving for universal good. For some reason, we don't seem to be troubled by the fact that we are steadily relinquishing our leadership role in the world. Perhaps, one day, we'll reclaim the helm and stop worrying about only putting ourselves first."
