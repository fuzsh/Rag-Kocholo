        "text": "All the arguments advanced in this piece are anticipated, understandable and mostly well received.\n\nThe weakest point of the argument is the but : “But Mr. Dylan’s writing is inseparable from his music.” - indeed the dancer cannot be separated from the dance. ( Will return to counter-arguments - and justification of the prize later , for once and for all – still waiting for an avalanche of objections.)\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature is the highest literary honour that the world has to offer and I thank God for the Swedish Academy adhering to the spirit of Alfred Nobel's wishes and this time even broadening their horizons a little further.\n\nIn the interview that followed immediately after Sara Danius' announcement had been greeted with some jubilation (by the assembled media crowd) she said very emphatically that the Swedish Academy had been unanimous and very happy with their decision to award the 2016 Nobel Prize for Literature to Bob Dylan (Robert Allen Zimmerman). Implied , not without due consideration about the consequential fallout from such a radical decision…\n\n“Poetry of the ear”: “It’s an extraordinary example of his brilliant way of rhyming and his pictorial thinking... If you look back, far back, you discover Homer and Sappho, and they wrote poetic texts that were meant to be listened to. They were meant to be performed. It’s the same way with Bob Dylan. But we still read Homer and Sappho. He can be read and should be read. He is a great poet in the grand English tradition. I know the music, and I’ve started to appreciate him much more now. Today, I’m a lover of Bob Dylan.” (Sara Danius)\n\nStockholm: In 1979, on Vasagatan, just a few minutes before Mr. Soyinka boarded the bus to the airport, he smiled back at me and said “I also have my favourite/s”. My musical ear cannot remember if he said “favourite” or favourites”. The last thing he said was, “I need a watch” - and seven years later, he was awarded the Nobel Prize.\n\nThat's one of the problems; everyone has their own favourite/ favourites and fortunately or unfortunately, the Swedish Academy cannot please everyone at the same time - the French Language empire want a Frenchie writer to be made king of kings, the Portuguese may be lesser or weaker language chauvinists/ combatants and less stridently nationalistic - don't yet know the attitude of the Chinese except that they would very much prefer that the Prize be not “politically motivated” as they believe is the case when the prize is awarded to a dissident / regime critic. As for Ladbrokes and other betting / gambling institutions, Bob Dylan was rated at 50:1 and that's what keeps these gambling enterprises alive; sadly, somebody always backs the wrong horse...\n\nSince Moby Dick - the start of one's induction into American Literature followed by Salinger's “The t Catcher in the Rye” a hundred years later, most if not all of Philip Roth, John Updike and their literary clans. To use that sometimes ambiguous Nigerian-English word sentimental, to which pleads guilty mi lord, since this syncopating Negro along with many other Negro and non-Negroes of my generation, grew up with our bard, Bob Dylan lyrical songs – sung poetry - in reality, in Bob Dylan's songs, the totality of his prodigious output, the chronicles the history of his times, the history of America - as Richie Havens sings Songwriter ,“greatest storyteller “and Marvin Gaye in “Life is for Learning”, “Some songs were done by chosen men, some from men insane”\n\nCornelius\n\nWe Sweden\n\nTonight's the night - Dylan won't be there, Horace Engdahl the former Secretary of the Swedish Academy will read a message from Mr. Dylan and Patti Smith will perform his\n\n“ A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall”\n\nSwedish TV is agog with Dylan and just now there's a film about his life. You can imagine that if the bard would have been turning up in person at this evening's prize-giving ceremony and banquet , if would have been something like Dylan-fever with thousands of fans turning up to get even just a glimpse of the rock star and no other) which could have made the other Nobel Prize laureates (in medicine, chemistry, psychics, economics etc.) feel a little left out of the general air of adulation...\n\nAlmost a direct reply to the preposterous “Why Bob Dylan shouldn't have gotten a Nobel” is this beautiful piece by Bernard-Henri Levy celebrating THE PRIZE being awarded Mr. Dylan :\n\nBob Dylan and the Literary Idiot Wind\n\nCulture & Society\n\nBernard-Henri Lévy\n\nBernard-Henri Lévy is one of the founders of the “Nouveaux Philosophes” (New Philosophers) movement. His books include Left in Dark Times: A Stand Against the New Barbarism, American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville, and the forthcoming Spirit of Judaism.\n\nBob Dylan and the Literary Idiot Wind\n\nPARIS – Oh, the anger of the fusty at the announcement of Bob Dylan’s Nobel Prize! What an outcry from the academy – not the Swedish one, mind you, but that of the world church of literaturology.\n\nThe panic of the literary bureaucracy, ensnared in its certainties and steeped in its petty calculations, its half-baked prognostications, its crafty shifts of position, has been palpable. Was the choice of Dylan political or non-political? Why an American? Why not a woman? Or a voice, any voice, of a visible minority? Or this one, who’s been waiting 20 years? Or that one, who’s given up hope?\n\nThe truth, however unpleasant it may be for the fuddy-duddies, is that awarding the Nobel Prize in Literature to an author who has written just one book is no more surprising than giving it to Dario Fo or Winston Churchill.\n\nAnd here’s the even greater truth: to bestow it on one of our last popular poets, the distant relative of Rutebeuf, Villon, and all the minstrels and songsters of solitude and dereliction; to consecrate a troubadour, a bard of the brotherhood of lonely and lost souls; to crown the author of ballads that have been, to borrow André Suarès’s phrase about Rimbaud, “a moment in the life” of so many people in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries makes a lot more sense than pulling out of a hat the obscure Rudolf Christoph Eucken or picking poor old Sully Prudhomme instead of Tolstoy.\n\nOf course, it’s wrong to respond priggishly to priggishness. But, confronted with those who have been shouting, “That’s not literature! It’s just not!” one is tempted to side with Francis Ponge who, citing Lautréamont, defined the poet (he would say “proet”) as a bard or troubadour who, by expressing the “voice of things,” becomes “the most useful citizen of his tribe.” And to whom does that definition apply better than to the author of “Chimes of Freedom” or “Long and Wasted Years,” which bring to life and to music what the critic Greil Marcus has called the “invisible republic” of American culture?\n\nOne is tempted to side also with Mallarmé, who urged us, in more or less the same terms, to “give a purer meaning to the words of the tribe.” Again, who better than this collage artist, this chameleon of citation and intertextuality, this laconic lyricist, this verbal alchemist who spent his life reinventing others’ words and his own, uncovering the embers of the era beneath the ashes of the day’s defeats, and transmuting into gold the lead he heard on the radio?\n\nOr consider the familiar distinction between scribes, who make instrumental use of language, and writers, who spin it into silk. Wasn’t Dylan alluding to something similar when, after years of struggle for civil rights, resistance to the war in Vietnam, and support for the feminist revolution, he titled one of his most beautiful songs “I’m Not There,” as in, I’m not here anymore, no longer your servant, goodbye to all that, so long?\n\nBut the true question lies elsewhere. The most conclusive exercise would be to compare apples with apples and the author of “Blonde on Blonde” with those who were and remain his key contemporaries.\n\nDylan is a Kerouac who can sing. He’s a Burroughs who put to music the great parade of the Beat generation, with its wild parties and naked lunches. He is what Allen Ginsberg said in describing his shock upon first hearing “A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall” in 1963, a song in which the accents and pacing, the abrupt changes in emphasis, the voyage to the very heart of words and the imagination all echo the best literature of the time – but with music as well!\n\nAre we going to hold that against Dylan, charge him with the sin of having grafted the rhythms of the blues, soul, and country music onto those of the Bible, William Blake, and Walt Whitman? Why should we withhold from the trouper of the Never Ending Tour (more than two thousand performances!) the dignity accorded without hesitation to the author of On the Road?\n\nIt was Louis Aragon, I think, who said that setting a poem to music was like moving from black and white to color. Aragon, the poet sung by Léo Ferré and others, believed that a poem unsung was half dead.\n\nWell, then, it seems that Dylan was the only one of his era to have been able to embody fully the musicality that is essential to great poetry, the second voice that haunts every poet, but which he generally delegates to those who recite or read him, the power of song that is his ultimate and secret truth and that some have gone mad – literally and tragically mad – trying to pull from cage into canto.\n\nBard and rhapsodist both. A poetico-musical revolution in one man and one body of work. I like to think that it is this tour de force – this prolonged stroke of genius that is forever young – that the Nobel committee has recognized in its selection.\n\nhttp://prosyn.org/HbbMnde\n\n© 1995-2016 Project Syndicate\n\nKen:\n\nYou may well disagree but isnt this a question of emphasis?\n\nI thank CAO for bringing in Spyinka's comment on music. Soyinka's music is merely a 'footnote' to his plays. I stated that a great musician is also a great poet; but the converse is not necessarily true. Soyinka's experiment with the Unlimited Liability Company shows clearly that he may be one of the greatest dramatists and poets ever that doesnt necessarily mean he would be (or is) a great musician. Thats the reason he will never win a grammy. His poetry book The Shuttle in the Crypt may be one of the greatest poetry books ever (in my opinion) but there is not much in it that is musical. Soyinka's poetry thrives on some of the most original and accurate use of metaphor ever seen as well as syntactic arrangements that foreground subjunctives as a powerful tool in poetry writing. The latter is the source of the often quoted remark that Soyinka's style is opaque. Many readers expect sentences structured on the SVC .grammatical model but encounter instead lots of initial gerunds and intransitives and get lost in the complex and compound sentences when they anticipate simple sentence structures (I have drawn parallels in my study of music composition between simple chords and complex chords).\n\nOn the other hand the elusive factor that endears readers to Okigbo's poetry is the musicality in it which he adroitly deploys again and again through such tools as parallisms. It is no wonder that he was a practicing (amateur) musician trained on the clarinet. And he gives us hints of these in words such 'strophes\" 'monody' \"lament\" 'elegy' 'swan song'\n\n'alto' as well as titles like 'lament of the drums'\n\nRed herrings: lyric.\n\nI once did a graduate course on the lyric an d was utterly disappointed expecting that at some point well break into dancing and singing. Then as I mused over my disappointment I realized that for a long time when people spoke of the lyrics of a piece of music I thought they meant the chords: why not call a spade a spade and refer to words as words! So the word lyric may have unfergone transmutations over the ages from that which means words.transformed into music through appropriate chords to just words devoid of the musical chords. Transforming words into musical chords means starting from building blocks such as alliteration' assonance and yoking them to repetitions and parallelisms coupled with elongations and contractions for artistic effects. It is the sum total of these adroitly deployed that separates the great musicians from the others. Poetry is therefore the link between literature and orature; between literature and music. The midwife is the aristic use of words. Yes Soyinka was right about the psalms ; he isnt about his judgement on the Committee and Dylan's work. If Dylan is a sculptor I would disagree totally with their decision. The Nobel Committees decision on Dylan is sound.\n\nin passing\n\nIn 1798 we got The Lyrical Ballads the preface to which was something of a radical departure (anyway, in my view much of them too pompous to be sung…\n\nIn the vernacular, some storytelling : Bob Dylan - The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest\n\nBob Dylan : The Ballad of a thin man\n\nLast night, more accurately early this morning at about 3 a.m., Nobel Prize in Literature hangover, I read pages 232-239 (Music in Judaism) from The Encyclopedia of Jewish Values by Nachum Amsel with the subheadings “All of Judaism is affected by music”/ “The importance of music in Judaism”/” Music in the Bible”/ “Musical instruments in Judaism”/ “ Which is the essence of Jewish Music – instruments or singing?”/ “Music in Jewish Prayer”/” Non-Jewish melodies in the synagogue”/ “The banning of music by the rabbis”\n\nOf relevance: THE IMPORTANCE OF MUSIC IN JUDAISM\n\n“ Music is not only vital to Judaism and Jewish life today, but it is central to the creation and the continuation of the world. The verse says that “ the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament proclaims His handiwork” (Psalm19:2) In explaining this verse, the Rabbis clarify that the form of the declaration is through daily music of the heavens and the earth, which sing to God, and without this daily song, God would not have created the world at all.( Midrash, Otzar HaMidrashim, Rabbi Akiva 4) And this Midrash goes on to say that all the rivers, mountains, and all parts of nature sing to God daily. Rabbi Nachman takes this idea one step further and says that each blade of grass and each animal has its own particular melody and sings. Another Midrash explains that God prefers the song of man to the song of angels, because the angels sing to God on a regular basis, the same time each day, while man sings out to God spontaneously. In fact the very first song sung by the Jewish people to God was the Song of The Sea following their miraculous salvation by God from the Egyptian armies. Rashi explains that this song was completely spontaneous. According to one source, this song was the first time that man ever sang to God, despite all the previous interactions of God with man in the Torah. In fact , one opinion writes that if not for the daily song of human beings to God, He would not have created the world to begin with. Another opinion is that the entire purpose of creation itself was for music and song.\n\nSong in the Temple was so crucial that atonement could not be achieved for a sacrifice in the Temple unless song accompanied it. Similarly, any sacrifice brought to the Temple that lacked the song to accompany it, was invalidated because of that. In fact the highest form of service to God , according to the Talmud, is music and song ( Midrash Bamidbar Rabbah 6:10). The Zohar explains that the Levites , who sang in the Temple, were called Levites because they joined together ( “Nelavim”) in unison to sing to God. One who sings to God in this world is assured that he or she will sing to God in the Next World as well.\n\nThe central book of Judaism, the Torah itself, is called a song, Shira. Rabbi Naftali Tzvi Yehuuda Berlin explains why the Torah is referred to by that term. He states that every song has lyrics and feelings that are implied beneath the surface and not plainly stated. So too the Torah's main ideas and deeper concepts are not found in the plain text, but must be understood on a hidden, more subtle level, like a song. Ideas in the Torah, like in a song, are often intentionally elusive and implied , and not openly written, Perhaps, in addition, just as a song has many levels of understanding, the Torah is intended to be understood on many levels. And just as a song contains many feelings and moods within it and varies from person to person, so too, the Torah generates different feelings and moods for different people. Finally, just as a song inspires people, deeply moving them to action and change,so too the Torah is meant to inspire individuals to act and change.”"
