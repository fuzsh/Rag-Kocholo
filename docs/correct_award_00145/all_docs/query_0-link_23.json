        "text": "AKA Rudolf Christoph Eucken\n\nBorn: 5-Jan-1846\n\nBirthplace: Aurich, Germany\n\nDied: 14-Sep-1926\n\nLocation of death: Jena, Germany\n\nCause of death: unspecified\n\nGender: Male\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nOccupation: Philosopher\n\nNationality: Germany\n\nExecutive summary: Individual and Society\n\nGerman philosopher, born on the 5th of January 1846 at Aurich in East Friesland, now a part of Germany. His father died when he was a child, and he was brought up by his mother, a woman of considerable activity. He was educated at Aurich, where one of his teachers was the philosopher Wilhelm Reuter, whose influence was the dominating factor in the development of his thought. Passing to the university of Göttingen he took his degree in classical philology and ancient history, but the bent of his mind was definitely towards the philosophical side of theology. There he studied under the philosopher and idealist Rudolf Hermann Lotze. Subsequently he studied in Berlin, especially under Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg, whose ethical tendencies and historical treatment of philosophy greatly attracted him.\n\nFrom 1871 to 1874 Eucken taught philosophy at Basel, and in 1874 became professor of philosophy at the university of Jena. In 1908 he was awarded the Nobel prize for literature. Eucken's philosophical work is partly historical and partly constructive, the former side being predominant in his earlier, the latter in his later works. Their most striking feature is the close organic relationship between the two parts. The aim of the historical works is to show the necessary connection between philosophical concepts and the age to which they belong; the same idea is at the root of his constructive speculation. All philosophy is philosophy of life, the development of a new culture, not mere intellectualism, but the application of a vital religious inspiration to the practical problems of society. The human soul was unique in man and unexplained by the study of nature.\n\nUniversity: University of Göttingen\n\nProfessor: University of Jena (1874-1920)\n\nNobel Prize for Literature 1908\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
