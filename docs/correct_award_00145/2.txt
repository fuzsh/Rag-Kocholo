The 1908 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to the German philosopher Rudolf Christoph Eucken (1846â€“1926) "in recognition of his earnest search for truth, his penetrating power of thought, his wide range of vision, and the warmth and strength in presentation with which in his numerous works he has vindicated and developed an idealistic philosophy of life."[1] He is the second German to be awarded the prize and the first philosopher to be a recipient.[1]
