Vintage portrait photo circa 1909 of German philosopher Rudolf Christoph Eucken (1846 - 1926) - winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1908. Eucken, a prolific writer, was awarded his Nobel Prize "in recognition of his earnest search for truth, his penetrating power of thought, his wide range of vision, and the warmth and strength in presentation with which in his numerous works he has vindicated and developed an idealistic philosophy of life".
