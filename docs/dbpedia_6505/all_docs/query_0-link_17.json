        "text": "Get in\n\n[edit]\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nThe nearest practical airport is Madrid Barajas (MAD IATA), some 200 km east. It's well connected domestically, within Europe and to the Gulf States and Americas.\n\nIberia and travel search engines may also show flights from \"SAJ\". But that's actually a bus, operated by Avanza, running from Salamanca bus station to Madrid Barajas Terminal 4.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nAVE trains link Salamanca with Madrid Chamartin every couple of hours, taking little over 90 min, via Segovia. There are also direct Interregio trains taking over two hours via Avila and El Escorial, and connecting trains via Valladolid which also stop in Segovia.\n\nAn overnight train connects Salamanca with Coimbra and Lisbon (7-8 hours). Reaching northwest Spain (e.g. Leon, Santiago or Vigo) will involve back-tracking to Segovia.\n\nInterregio trains may also stop at Salamanca La Alamedilla station, 500 m southwest. So that's just 500 m to the centre, 10 minutes walk if your bags are light.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nAvanza[dead link] buses run hourly from Madrid South station, on Avenida Méndez Álvaro 83. Expresses take 2 hr 30 min (€24), slower buses over 3 hr (€17). They also run direct every two hours from Madrid Barajas Airport Terminal 1 via Terminal 4, taking 2 hr 30 min, €27.\n\nAvanza buses also run via Avila to Valladolid (6 per day, 90 min, €10) and Segovia (4 per day, 3 hours, €15).\n\nAlsa run buses to Santiago (2 per day, 6 hours, €50), Gijon (5 per day, 6 hours, €26), and Seville (6 per day, 7 hours, €37).\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nGood fast Autovias (with toll) link Salamanca east to Avila (100 km) and Madrid (205 km) via A50; south to Caceres (235 km) and Seville via A66; northeast to Valladolid (115 km) via A62; north to Zamora and Leon via A66; and west into Portugal via A62.\n\nBuy\n\n[edit]\n\nShopping is a large part of life in Salamanca. Traditional family owned stores mix with many national and international retailers throughout the city. Calle Toro, which begins at the northwest corner of the Plaza Mayor, in particular has many options for shoppers.\n\nThe city also boasts a mall (centro commercial) called El Tormes which offers variety of stores and restaurants. However a car, bus or taxi ride is needed to access it. There is also the large department store chain El Corte Inglés located on Calle María Auxiliadora.\n\nMost stores open around 10:00, close for two or three hours during lunch time (14:00) and remain open until 21:00. Almost all stores, including grocery stores, are closed on Sundays. There are a few convenience stores, known as 24-hour stores, which never close.\n\nEvery Sunday an outdoor market, known as the Rastro, erects where locals and tourists shop for assorted products: clothes, jackets, hats, bags, jewelry, watches, perfumes, colognes, and other accessories. The Rastro is on Av. de la Aldehuela, about 3 km west of Plaza Mayor, roughly a 20-minute walk.\n\nEat\n\n[edit]\n\nLunch is Spain's big meal of the day, and Salamanca abides by that rule religiously. This means that restaurants will have their best food and their biggest portions anywhere from 13:00-15:00.\n\nDinner usually happens from 20:00-23:00, and isn't really a meal as such. In spite of the many restaurants open at dinner time (with a full menu), one of the traditional Spanish habits is to eat tapas with friends over a glass of wine, which consists of regional appetizers served at bars, restaurants, and cafeterías. In Salamanca there's no definitive guide to tapa-ing, instead, try to stroll around the center of the town and try different places and, who knows, meet new friends.\n\nLocals gather slightly north of city center for their nightly tapas on a street named Van Dyck. The tapas here are generally of a higher quality and a lower price of those found near the plaza. Almost every street out from the centre will have at least one small bar, and many of them will serve tapas. The price difference between having or not a tapa with your drink is negligible (around €2 for each beer/wine and tapa, €0.20-30 less only the beer) so go on a try them!\n\nPopular tapas are any sort of roasted pork parts: ribs (costilla), sausage (chorizo), ham (jamon), bacon (panceta) or face (jeta). Try the \"pincho moruno\", a brochette of pork pieces marinated in paprika and garlic. A local speciality (if you find it appealing) is \"chanfaina\" a spicy rice dish with liver and/or blood that is served in many bars as a tapa on Sundays.\n\nIn the summer most restaurants set tables outside for both lunch and dinner. For the privilege of sitting outside you often get charged a euro or two extra per person.\n\nSalamanca is atop the small portion of Spain where you can purchase jamon iberia (Iberian ham). This expensive pork is very rich, very expensive and in the opinion of most Salamancans the most delicious thing there is to eat.\n\nVegetarians will have to work a little bit to find food. Tortilla de patata is always a safe bet (a frittata-type thing with potato and egg) but it can get old after a while. Meat (especially pork) finds its way into a majority of dishes here. When you're asking waiters if a dish does not have meat (carne), make sure you specify that you don't want chicken (pollo) or fish (pescado) either.\n\nOther restaurants include:\n\nEl Bardo Junto, Calle Compania 8\n\nEl Triton, Paseo de Canalejas 28\n\nBambú, Calle de Prior 4\n\nMomo, Calle San Pablo 13\n\nVegetarian and vegan options\n\n[edit]"
