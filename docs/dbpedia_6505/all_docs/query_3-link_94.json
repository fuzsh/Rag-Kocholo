        "text": "Salamanca is home to one of the oldest universities in the world and is in many ways the ideal place to learn Spanish. Our Salamanca school is also one of our most popular schools in Spain. The beautifully preserved historic centre of the city has elegant stone-built faculty buildings, noblemen's houses, cobbled streets and the most magnificent 'Plaza Mayor' in the whole of Spain.\n\nThe city is off the main tourist route and therefore unspoilt by mass tourism. Our school in Salamanca is right in the historic centre of the city.\n\nSalamanca, with a population of just 185,000, is a city full of Spanish students. The city is typically 'Spanish' in every regard and is also supposedly the place where the 'purest' Spanish is spoken. It is therefore an ideal location in which to learn Spanish. The streets are always bustling with people, combining the friendly atmosphere of a small town, where most things can be reached on foot, with the advantages of a medium-sized city, able to offer everything you could want.\n\nIf you learn Spanish in Salamanca you will be learning the best, 'purest' form of the language. If you choose to stay in a host family, this will help you with your language learning. It also gives you chance to learn more about the Spanish way of life, and students can choose between 2 meals or 3 meals per day.\n\nIf you prefer, you can choose to stay in one of our fully-equipped shared apartments either with Spaniards or with international students. You have your own room or can share a twin room with a friend, and share the kitchen, living room and bathroom with the other flatmates.\n\nAll of the accommodation both in host family or shared apartment, is located within 15 minutes' walk of the school."
