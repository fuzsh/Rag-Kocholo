        "text": "Why choose Salamanca to study Spanish?\n\nSmall, charming, fascinating\n\nSalamanca is a small city (170.000 people) situated in the west of Spain, 200 kilometres from Madrid. In 2002, the city successfully hosted the European City of Culture and has been honoured a UNESCO World Heritage City for its rich arts. Salamanca's University is located in the heart of the historical city, it is one of the oldest in Europe and boasts world recognition. The beauty of the city and its surroundings, as well as its university atmosphere, attract students every year from all over the world. This charming and vibrant location offers students the opportunity to study in a multicultural campus amid a wealth of history and culture. Salamanca is not known as the City of Spanish in vain.\n\nSalamanca, the City of Spanish\n\nSalamanca is known as the City of Spanish for many reasons. First of all, it is located in the province of Castilla, the cradle of the original Spanish. It also has one of the oldest universities in Europe, specializing in Arts and Languages. The result is that the most correct and purest Spanish is spoken in Salamanca, attracting thousands of students each year to the city, that either come to learn or perfect their Spanish.\n\nDue to its small size, its wonderful quality of life, and its university atmosphere, Salamanca is the ideal place to study Spanish!\n\nFurthermore, other Spanish locations such as Barcelona, Galicia and the Basque Country have their own individual languages making Spanish only a co-official language. On the contrary, in Salamanca Spanish is the only language spoken, may it be in the streets, or in local businesses and administrations.\n\nImpressive range of day to day cultural activities\n\nSalamanca offers a cultural array befitting of its prestigious reputation. Every day there are concerts, plays and film festivals of interest to the visitor, not to mention museums and exhibitions packed with heritage from the middle ages until the 20th century, from the Cathedral Museum to the Centro de Arte de Salamanca, representing the history of Spanish culture and art.\n\nArchitecturally Wonderful\n\nBut the most interesting sights of Salamanca are its streets. Small and accessible the visitor can walk through its streets while contemplating the precious architecture in every corner. The splendor of the Spanish Renaissance has been conserved in Salamanca like no other place, and there are unique examples of Baroque Architecture as the Plaza Mayor which is one of the most beautiful squares in the world.\n\nYouth and Modern Life\n\nAll this provides the background for student life infusing the city with its characteristic youthful spirit. Thousands of students, from all over the world, fill its streets every single day, as well as its bars and cafés, cinemas and theatres, museums and libraries, giving life and diversity to the Plaza Mayor and the city center. A place defined by its university atmosphere, that makes the newcomers feel welcome and fall in love with her.\n\nPrivileged geographic location\n\nSalamanca is perfectly situated, not just because of its proximity to Madrid, but also because you can travel quickly to many interesting destinations: Toledo, Segovia, Ávila, Galicia and the coast of Cantabria, Portugal, etc. What's more, its natural surrounding, the Castilian countryside, provides an opportunity for numerous leisure activities: horse riding, hiking, gastronomic trips, visits to small villages...\n\nSalamanca provides everything a student of Spanish could possibly want.\n\nFor more information about Salamanca, you can visit:\n\nSalamanca (Spain)."
