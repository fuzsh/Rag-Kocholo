Today, the program is among the most successful of its kind, with a yearly enrolment of more than 4,000 foreign students and language teachers from across the world.\n\nThe university’s status as a pioneering force in the field of Spanish language instruction was affirmed by the Spanish government when the Instituto Cervantes (the official institution in charge of disseminating the Spanish language) assigned Salamanca University the task of elaborating and evaluating the yearly DELE exams used to officially accredit advanced Spanish language students worldwide.\n\nThe Spanish language program is housed in the Escuelas Menores building, a campus wing located in the heart of Salamanca’s historic district. A beautiful Renaissance court graced with magnificent arcades forms the center of the building. On its façade, which is decorated with numerous figures, the famous and difficult to spot ¨frog on a skull¨ can be found; a sight which according to local lore bestows academic success on its beholders. The building’s façade also features plateresque carvings of the Catholic Kings, Charles V's imperial coat of arms, and a depiction of the Pope with two Cardinals. The ancient walls are marked with the legacies of students who, upon graduation, have written their initials in ink composed of bull’s blood, olive oil, and herbs.\n\nSurrounded by deep history as it is, the program’s installations nevertheless count with state-of-the-art educational technology and modern conveniences designed to provide students with a quality, comfortable learning experience.\n\nLearn Spanish in style with a first class, all-inclusive study package for Salamanca University.\n\nThe History of Salamanca University\n\nFounded in 1218 by King Alfonso IX, the University of Salamanca was Spain’s first institution of higher learning. By 1254 it had received acknowledgment from Pope Alexander IV as being one of the four great world universities, along with the universities of Oxford, Paris and Bologna. It has played host to numerous illustrious professorial careers throughout its long history, including those of Luis de León, Beatriz de Galindo, Melchor Cano, Francisco de Vitoria and Miguel de Unamuno. Such historical figures as Miguel de Cervantes, Hernán Cortés and Christopher Columbus have walked the university’s halls.\n\nIn 1254 King Alfonso X granted the university the privileges that constitute its Magna Carta; appointing curators; placing the institution under the authority of the bishop, the dean, and the chancellor; and assigning salaries to its professors. From that point on the university’s academic titles were presented in the name of the Pope and the King in Salamanca’s cathedral (a tradition that would continue until 1830).\n\nDuring the medieval and modern periods, the university received its funding through royal and papal concessions, and the five colleges of Law, Canon Law, Theology, Medicine and Arts-Philosophy were formed. The university also offered complementary instruction in Humanities, Languages, Mathematics and Music. After the Law of Public Instruction was passed in 1857, the colleges were consolidated into Law, Philosophy and Arts, and Theology (which was subsequently closed in 1868).\n\nBetween 1869 and 1904, Salamanca’s local government and Town Council independently financed the schools of Medicine and Sciences, after which state financing was obtained under the rectorship of Miguel de Unamuno. When this source of funding was discontinued, the University turned to registration and academic fees as well as allocations from the state budget to meet its financial needs.\n\nToday, Salamanca University consists of the colleges of Law, Liberal Arts, and Science and Medicine, as well as possessing numerous highly regarded academic units such as its Spanish language institute. The university enjoys an annual population of 30,000 students participating in upwards of 250 academic programs.\n\nFacilities and Activities at Salamanca University\n\nAll students signing up for a course at Salamanca University will receive a student card which gives access to all university facilities; students can also participate in the special activities arranged outside class hours for foreign students.\n\nBelow you can find further information about the university facilities and activities arranged.\n\nFacilities\n\nThe Spanish courses for foreigners department is located in one of the historical university buildings situated in the Patio de Escuelas Menores which is in the centre of the old town.

The province of Salamanca shares its western border with Portugal, and the town of Salamanca is only about 2 hours drive from Madrid.\n\nThe city has approx. 170,000 inhabitants and although it is a small town, it has a good infrastructure and offers nearly all types of free time activities.\n\nThe weather in Salamanca is like the rest of central Spain; during the summer it is warm and dry and in the winter cold with some rain and occasional snow.\n\nSalamanca is famous for its university, which is the third oldest university in Europe dating back to 1218; in fact the university has influenced Salamanca's history, daily life and atmosphere a great deal.\n\nBefore becoming a famous university town, Salamanca also enjoyed an interesting history. The first settlements in the area date back to about 2000 b.C with different tribes living in the area. Later on the town where inhabited by Greeks and Carthaginians and during the Romans Empires dominance in Spain Salamanca was an important agricultural area and also an obligatory stop on the silver route crossing Spain.\n\nDuring the Moorish epoch the area of Salamanca was located in between the lines of the Moorish and Christian armies and therefore did not play an important role.\n\nAfter the fall of the Moors Salamanca started to grew in size and after the declaration of the Spanish king to turn the city into a university town Salamanca became an important town. The golden period of Salamanca was in the 16th century where the gold coming in from South American helped finance many of the beautiful monuments and buildings (including parts of the university) which pride Salamanca today.\n\nDuring the French invasion in 1808 led by Napoleon, many of the city's treasures were destroyed and the university was nearly closed down.

It was founded in 1218, making it the oldest university in Spain, and the fourth-oldest in Europe. As a result of its prestige, it attracts many exchange and foreign students, lending it an international, multicultural atmosphere.\n\nThe University has been pioneering in many aspects: it debated for the rights of the indigenous populations during the Spanish conquest of the Americas, and was also the first university in the world to accept female students. Famous alumni include Miguel de Cervantes (one of Spain’s greatest writers and author of Don Quixote) and Hernán Cortés (the first conquistador that was responsible for the fall of the Aztec Empire). It takes in a total of 30,000 students per year and offers over 250 academic programs.\n\nThere is no doubt that the University of Salamanca is a leading authority regarding the teaching of the Spanish language. It is widely acclaimed for its Spanish teaching to foreigners and has been providing courses since 1929. Nowadays, it attracts over 4000 foreign students of Spanish per year. Additionally, the University itself sets and marks the yearly DELE exams (Diploma of Spanish as a Foreign Language Spanish- the official certification of Spanish language proficiency worldwide).\n\nThe University is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities. Spanish courses take place in the centre of Salamanca’s old town, in the Escuelas Menores building, which is equipped with modern technology. This includes audio-visual equipment to enhance students’ language learning experience.\n\nStudent city\n\nAlthough the city of Salamanca is small, with only 170,000 inhabitants, the fact that it is a university town means that the student presence is high and there is a good infrastructure and plenty to do as a result. The majority of people are aged between 18 and 30, and the nightlife, restaurants, bars and shops cater towards the student lifestyle and of course student budgets. As such, Salamanca is a fairly inexpensive city: a coffee will cost €1.50 and an average meal approximately €7.\n\nYou can also easily find Spanish students interested in language exchange where you can switch between helping a Spanish student learn English and learn Spanish from a Spanish student.\n\nThe sights\n\nSalamanca is home to charming historic attractions and stunning architecture; the old city was named as a UNESCO World Heritage sight in 1988. As the city is small, it is easy to reach everything by foot and lends itself to walking. The majority of its sights of interest are museums, palaces, religious buildings and squares. The fact that most are built out of sandstone has given Salamanca the nickname of ‘La Dorada’, or the ‘Golden city’ as a result of the golden glow the architecture bestows on the city.\n\nSome of the top sights are:\n\nPlaza Mayor: this is the main square, the bustling hub of the city. It is filled with cafés, restaurants and shops. One of the most well-known squares in the country, it is the ideal spot for people-watching, sipping on a coffee, buying souvenirs, or grabbing a bite to eat. At night, the plaza is lit up and looks magical.\n\nThe Cathedrals: unusually, Salamanca has two cathedrals: the Old Cathedral and the New Cathedral. Both are located next to one another and are connected. The Old Cathedral is a Romanesque-style building, built in the 14th century. Construction of the New Cathedral started the following century due to the large numbers of students flooding into the city to study at the University. The New Cathedral was constructed in Gothic and Plateresque styles, and was finished in 1733.\n\nCasa de las Conchas: The House of Shells is a Gothic-style building that was completed at the end of the 15th century. The outside of this building is beautifully decorated with over 300 shells.\n\nThe University buildings: the buildings themselves are main attractions. The University entrance is built in a Plateresque style and it is now tradition for people to try and spot the frog carved amongst the intricate designs- legend has it that it is said to bring luck to the students that spot it and ensure that they will pass their exams.\n\nPatio de las Escuelas: here you can find a statue of Fray Luis de Leon (a writer, one of the university’s most famous alumni).\n\nCasa Lis Art Nouveau and Art Deco Museum: constructed in 1995, this museum comprises 2500 pieces and 19 collections, spanning the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The museum is partially made of stained glass.\n\nThe accent\n\nIn Salamanca, the Castilian accent is spoken, which is widely regarded as the clearest Spanish accent and therefore the easiest to understand, because every single letter is pronounced (in comparison with some Spanish and Latin American dialects where consonants are dropped and words run together).\n\nOther regions of Spain speak other regional languages, such as Galician, Catalan or Basque. As Salamanca does not have its own regional language, students will be fully immersed in Spanish only. Students studying in Salamanca will find it easy to understand the accent and as such will pick up a clear sounding Castilian accent.\n\nThe history\n\nSalamanca has a rich and vibrant history. Originally founded by Celts in 4th century BC, it was then conquered by the Romans, and then subsequently by the Moors in the 8th century. In the 13th century, followed the Reconquista, it was named Salamanca. The University was founded in 1218 by King Alfonso IX.\n\nAfter the University was established, Salamanca grew to be an important location within the country. During the so-called ‘golden period’ in the 16th century, the town’s infrastructure and architecture developed, funded by the wealth coming in from the Spanish conquest of the Americas.\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, Franco’s headquarters were located in Salamanca. After democracy was restored, the city began to rebuild and flourished once more, becoming the city it is today. Recently, it was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as well as the European Capital of Culture in 2002."
