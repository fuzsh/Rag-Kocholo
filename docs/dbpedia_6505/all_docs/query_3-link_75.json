        "text": "Salamanca is one of the most beautiful cities in Spain. Its main square is one of the best examples of Baroque architecture in the Peninsula. Visit the Cathedrals, and don’t forget to climb the cathedral’s medieval towers via the Ieronimus exhibition: You can walk around the exterior terraces, the lookout points and balustrades that look over the interior of the church, amidst gargoyles, pinnacles and cathedral bells.\n\nThe University’s Historic Building, the oldest in Spain, is also worth a visit, and it is traditional for tourists to try to find the frog on its façade. Inside, visitors can discover other wonders such as the Fray Luis lecture hall, where time appears to have stood still, or the Old Library. No rush, but make sure to see the Casa de las Conchas, renowned for its main façade which is covered with hundreds of shells, and la Clerecía Church and the Pontifical University, located just opposite. And don’t forget to climb the La Clerecía Towers and enjoy some spectacular views over the city from the tower balconies, a breathtaking vantage point.\n\nAfter this pleasant walk, time for a quick break to get our strength back. There are some excellent restaurants with top-quality dining. Traditional and avant-garde cuisine with locally-grown products, featuring mouth-watering dishes such as Guijuelo cured ham, “morucha” beef, lentils from Armuña, chanfaina (rice with a chorizo and pork stew), roasts… locally-produced Salamanca cheeses, olive oils and wines. How about fine dining with views over the city (Parador de Turismo) or in the Plaza Mayor, or even in a contemporary art centre or how about in a traditional Castilian tavern.\n\nSource: Salamanca Tourism.\n\nHow to get there\n\nSalamanca is located in Western Spain, in the autonomous region of Castile-and-León, and is 214 km from Madrid. If you are coming from outside Spain, the easiest way is to fly to Madrid (Madrid-Barajas Airport), and then take the bus (Avanza Bus) or the train (RENFE), both of which have regular services. The trip from Madrid to Salamanca takes approximately two hours. If you are coming from Portugal or France, you can also get here on the bus or train.\n\nMore information: https://salamanca.es/en/presentation-of-the-city/practical-information"
