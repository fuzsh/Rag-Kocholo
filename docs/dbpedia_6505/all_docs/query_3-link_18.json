        "text": "Surrounded by mountains and situated to the north of the river Tormes, Salamanca is located in the mid-west area of Spain in the province of Castile y Leon, 2-3 hours drive from Madrid and 1 hour from the Portuguese border. In the town centre, all buildings are constructed with golden sandstone, giving the impression of being in another time zone, and at the heart of this lies the Plaza Mayor, Spain’s most beautiful.\n\nThe population today is approximately 165,000 and since Salamanca is one of the most famous university towns not just in Spain, but also Europe, there is a student population of 40,000 making it a lively, young city and creating an eclectic mix of the ancient and the modern."
