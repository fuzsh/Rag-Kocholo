        "text": "The charming villages of Salamanca\n\nThe province of Salamanca is a land marked, among many other things, by its characteristic landscapes, the uniqueness of its traditions, the character of its people and the quality of its gastronomy. All these attributes are reflected in its towns and cities, places that in many cases keep almost intact all the splendor experienced in the past. A rich history that merges with the surrounding landscapes, extensive pastures, rugged mountains, fertile plains and of course the dizzying arrivals that surround the villages that are settled there, contributing an incalculable natural value to the cultural and historical heritage that they have.\n\nProposed Itinerary through the most beautiful villages of Salamanca\n\nTo select for this Route through the charming villages of Salamanca the localities that compose it is not a trivial task since they are many those that in one way or another well deserve to be visited. Archaeological remains of ancient civilizations such as the Vetons, jewels of Roman architecture that still survive today or the turbulent Middle Ages have left their indelible mark on the towns and cities of the province of Salamanca. In addition to this remarkable historical heritage, there is the surprising landscape of the orography of Salamanca, natural areas of great ecological and environmental value such as the Arribes of the Duero Natural Park or the Las Batuecas and Sierra of Francia Natural Park, which contribute all their beauty to the villages we can find in them. A land, Salamanca, which has lived through renowned battles, which has seen illustrious characters pass through it and which has been and is crossed by illustrious centuries-old routes such as the Vía of the Plata. All these attributes are more than enough to tempt us to visit Salamanca and its towns, enjoying the landscapes that surround them, strolling calmly through its streets and immersing ourselves in its history while discovering its traditions by taking this route through the charming towns of Salamanca.\n\nAlba de Tormes\n\nOne of the most historical villas that we can find in the province of Salamanca will be our starting point for this Route through the charming villages of Salamanca. Of great strategic importance, given its location next to the Tormes River, the town of Alba de Tormes has seen illustrious characters pass through its streets, such as Teresa de Cepeda. The Convent of the Carmelite Mothers of the Annunciation, where the tomb of Santa Teresa de Jesús is located, is one of the architectural and cultural jewels that await us in Alba de Tormes. We can also visit authentic monuments such as the Basilica of Santa Teresa or the Castle of the Dukes of Alba whose silhouette imposes itself from the top of the hill where it sits as soon as we approach the town. But undoubtedly another of the main protagonists of the visit to Alba de Tormes is the Tormes river itself and the beautiful landscapes that, along with this illustrious town, compose in its path, such as the one known as San Jerónimo Bridge, which gives us the opportunity to enjoy a beautiful and quiet picture.\n\nRead more ⇒\n\nLedesma\n\nWe say goodbye to the beautiful town of Alba de Tormes to go, following the course of the river Tormes, towards our next goal, not without first seeing us in the not inconsiderable temptation to make a stop on our route to immerse ourselves in the charms that the city of Salamanca offers. Ledesma receives us with all its splendor and a character forged in past times that even today remains in its streets and monuments. Its rich history dates back to the seventh century BC, the date on which the first known vestiges in the place are dated. The walls, the castle, the Verraco are a symbol of the town, without forgetting the countless palaces that we will find along our walk through the streets or the various bridges that surround it and in some cases dating back to Roman times, are added to the countless religious monuments that Ledesma treasures and that tell us in detail the importance of this town in the current province of Salamanca.\n\nRead more ⇒\n\nMasueco\n\nWe continue with our journey without abandoning for now the tireless course of the Tormes River, which leads us to cross the colossal Almendra reservoir, and from there we move away from the river that continues in search of its nearby mouth in the great Duero River, while we head towards Trabanca and from there we approach the small town of Masueco, passing first through Pereña de la Ribera. It is from these two towns in Salamanca that the routes that lead to the well known as Well of the Fumes, one of the jewels that nature offers us within the Arribes of the Duero Natural Park where we are located, start. And the cultural heritage that these towns undoubtedly have, we must add the natural and scenic wealth that surrounds them. An example of this is Masueco de la Ribera where we can visit its Church of San Nicolás de Bari or the Hermitage of Santo Cristo of the Humilladero among other monuments that compete in prominence with the natural monuments of the environment.\n\nRead more ⇒\n\nAldeadávila de la Ribera\n\nWe left Masueco to go to the heart of Las Arribes, as Miguel de Unamuno catalogued it when he visited these lands. We are talking about Aldeadávila de la Ribera where we will find similar headaches to those experienced in the other villages we have just visited. Temptations with their own name such as the Viewpoint of El Picón de Felipe or the Viewpoint of El Fraile which, together with the Village of La Verde, force us to take a detour to make an unavoidable visit, which they more than compensate for. These charms are mixed with the historical attributes that this town and its region possess. As we stroll through its streets we will be transported to past times, a history that can be felt in its monuments. The Marqués del Caballero Palace, the huts or its different churches and hermitages form, together with the traditions and singular celebrations, the sign of identity that characterizes Aldeadávila de la Ribera, cradle of countless illustrious characters that walked through its streets.\n\nRead more ⇒\n\nSan Felices de los Gallegos\n\nThere are numerous options available to us to cover the distance that separates us from the next stop on this Route through the charming villages of Salamanca, almost as many as the beautiful corners and interesting towns that will come our way, inviting us to make a stop along the way. Once this section of the route is over, San Felices de los Gallegos will once again immerse us in an exciting journey through time. Ancient castros (fortified settlements) gave way to Roman rule, leaving an indelible mark on this region, a mark which, together with the later civilizations that dominated these lands, has lasted until the present day, being the sign of identity of the magnificent monumental complex of San Felices de los Gallegos. The Castle or Tower of Homage, its emblazoned houses or the different religious buildings that are preserved here clearly speak of the remarkable historical importance of this town.\n\nRead more ⇒\n\nCiudad Rodrigo\n\nThe next stop on this trip through the province of Salamanca is the monumental Ciudad Rodrigo, one of its most emblematic villas. Without a doubt, this is an unavoidable visit for those who come to these lands. Its important history, which dates back to prehistoric times, is marked by the different peoples who passed through here, such as the Vetons. Vestiges of another era and architectural monuments that have earned it the recognition it undoubtedly deserves. Throughout the journey through its streets, after crossing its colossal wall, we will be pleasantly surprised by every step. The Castle of Enrique II, the slender Cathedral of Santa María, its large houses and impeccable palaces such as Los Águila or the palace of the Marquesa de Cartago, its Renaissance town hall or the Hospital de la Pasión intermingle the different architectural styles that have existed over the years. An extensive and rich historical and artistic heritage to which are added its deep-rooted festivals and traditions without forgetting the careful and succulent gastronomy, all a sign of identity of Ciudad Rodrigo.\n\nRead more ⇒\n\nLa Alberca\n\nWe say goodbye to the medieval era to which Ciudad Rodrigo had transported us and we set off for another of the natural treasures of the province of Salamanca, we talk about the Natural Park of Las Batuecas-Sierra of France. In this paradise of nature, beautiful villages with their careful traditional architecture that blend delicately with the surrounding nature await us. All of them are villages that deserve a space in our trip to know them with the calm and tranquility that each one of them inspires. La Alberca is perhaps the flagship of this region. Situated at the foot of the Sanctuary of Our Lady of the Rock of France and its spectacular location, La Alberca invites visitors to walk through its streets, surprised by each balcony, each characteristic facade, and the many charming corners that this town treasures.\n\nRead more ⇒\n\nMogarraz\n\nWe say goodbye to La Alberca to set off for another of the jewels that make up this region, Mogarraz. This beautiful town rivals in interest and beauty the tourist town we have just visited. Its traditional houses, the Plaza Mayor, which serves as a bullring, the parish church of Our Lady of the Snows or the Hermitage and Fountain of the Humilladero, await us maintaining all the splendor of times past. A town proud of its history, its culture and traditions that, together with the privileged natural environment that surrounds it, invites us to walk around it calmly and to take one of the best known and most visited trekking routes in the whole province of Salamanca, the Way of the Water or simply to enjoy our visit to this welcoming town.\n\nSan Martín del Castañar\n\nThere are many villages that deserve our attention throughout our journey through this region, Sequeros, Monleón or our next stop San Martín del Castañar. Villas that along our route will be emerging from the leafy slopes of the Sierra Francia mountains. Villas of typical mountainous houses, of ornamented masonry and characteristic balconies, as it is the case of San Martin del Castañar. The Plaza Mayor, the castle or the Roman bridge, not to mention its bullring, one of the oldest in Spain, give added value to the already interesting visit to this town in the province of Salamanca. Of course, nature also plays an important role, giving the towns of this part of the route all the attraction it is capable of, offering us the opportunity to enjoy magnificent hiking routes such as the beautiful Forest of Mirrors Route.\n\nMiranda del Castañar\n\nWe continue our journey through the different villages that make up this region of the province of Salamanca heading to the town of Miranda del Castañar, a town whose first steps date from the twelfth century. This town of medieval air treasures an important historical and artistic patrimony, proof of it is the castle of the Zúñiga family, also called the castle of the Counts of Miranda del Castañar, whose parade ground has been and is a bullfighting ring. A walk through its streets allows us to enjoy one of the best preserved old quarters in all of Spain, while encountering the different charming corners that this town has to offer. Its environment, as it could not be otherwise, surrounds us with nature on all four sides, undoubtedly another of the great attributes of Miranda del Castañar.\n\nMontemayor del Río\n\nWe say goodbye to this region of Sierra Francia that we have visited to put course towards the not less interesting region of Sierra Béjar, where it awaits us its cared villages and its magnificent landscapes. The castle of San Vicente welcomes us to this medieval town, whose historic center is protected by the remains of the ancient wall. The Plaza Mayor, the stately homes, the church of the Assumption or the ancient Picota that marks the fountain of the square are undoubtedly some of the examples of the lordship and the importance that this town held in the past. A rich history that is accompanied by the deep-rooted traditions that have come to our days, without forgetting the important craftsmanship that is developed in the area or the careful gastronomy that we can taste in our visit to this town in the province of Salamanca.\n\nCandelario\n\nWe return to our time, from the journey back in time when we were submerged in Montemayor del Río to set off for our next destination, a typical mountain village nestled among lush forests at the foot of regal mountains. But before we arrive we will be tempted once again to stop on the way, this time to visit the town of Béjar. Already in Candelario we are surprised by the pampered architecture of its buildings where in many cases highlight the characteristics of batipuertas. Candelario's hermitage allows us to get an idea of the marked character of the people of Candelario, proud of their traditions and customs, which are reflected for example in their festivals, a character that has led many producers to take this town and its surroundings as the main set of films, series and documentaries. Without a doubt an unbeatable place to mark the point and followed by our Route through the charming villages of Salamanca.\n\nGet the most out of the route through the charming villages of Salamanca\n\n1-In some cases the places that we will be able to visit in each locality have their corresponding schedule of visits, for this reason it is better to inform us before to be able to organize us and not to lose detail.\n\n2-Some of the journeys are relatively long and are made by road, in many cases locally, so they must take longer than normal.\n\n3-There will be many places of interest or routes that we will find throughout our journey, no doubt all of them worthy of our attention, so it is not superfluous that we have, if possible, some extra time saved just in case.\n\n4-The historical, cultural and natural heritage are the main values that we will find in this route, without forgetting of course the not inconsiderable gastronomy that stands out in each place with its own name.\n\n5-Although the route can be completed in its entirety in 3 or 4 days, it would not be a bad idea to divide it by zones and dedicate a few more days to each region.\n\nMap of the route"
