        "text": "My Solo Month in Spain: Salamanca\n\nSalamanca is known as La Dorada, “The Golden City” for its ornate sandstone architecture that permeates this ancient university town north-west of Madrid. First conquered by the Carthaginians in the 3rd century B.C. , Salamanca then became a Roman settlement before being ruled by the Moors until the 11th century.\n\nBut what makes Salamanca a UNESCO World Heritage site, is that it’s home to one of the oldest universities in Europe, its historic Old Town center has important Romanesque, Gothic, Moorish, Renaissance and Baroque monuments and add to that a most impressive plaza.\n\nHaving two full days, without any travel between cities, has really allowed me to spend time getting to know a place with even some time to relax.\n\nThere are so many different highlights of Salamanca but for now, I’ll start with the Plaza Mayor, the gorgeous 18th century baroque public square; the Universidad de Salamanca or University of Salamanca which existed as far back as the late 12th century and is considered one of Europe’s oldest university’s plus street scenes through the Old Town of Salamanca.\n\nSalamanca, at least to me, is like it’s two adjoining Cathedrals, the New one and the Old one. This University city blends the old with the new in a wonderfully flawless way that allows you to leap into its medieval spell while easing into the thriving benefits of its modernity. I’m biased because I love Spain and I’ve heard the University of Salamanca is a good place to study the Spanish language. So, who knows? But let me not digress…the Cathedrals.\n\nThe New one, a mere 500 years old while the Old one dates back about 840 years.\n\nThe Old Cathedral no longer had sufficient capacity and was too small for the needs of the city. At the same time, Gothic architecture had burst onto the scene, leaving the antiquated Roman-style structures behind. The Old Cathedral may function more like a museum than a house of worship but its historical lineage cannot be understated. Construction began in 1140, during medieval war times giving it a strong defensive nature, and completed in 1180.\n\nBuilding began on the New Cathedral of Salamanca in 1513, but it wasn’t consecrated until 1733 which made it one of the most important Cathedrals of Spain. Building over several centuries came with its style changes. And, restoration was necessary after the great Lisbon earthquake in 1755 that even caused damages in Salamanca.\n\nHere’s the Old and New Cathedral to get to know along with another climb to the top of another amazing bell Tower.\n\nNot sure why, but I feel a special connection to Salamanca and have enjoyed getting to know this UNESCO World Heritage site. It’s a very walkable area and the beautiful sandstone architecture means while walking I get to take in the beauty of the area.\n\nThis post includes the Casa de las Conchas or the shell-covered Gothic Palace; the\n\nClerecía Church, now part of the Pontifical University; the ancientWalls and Roman Bridge along with a visit inside the Palacio de Monterrey.\n\nSaying goodbye to Salamanca and moving on to my next UNESCO World Heritage site of Cáceres. Next stop, another UNESCO World Heritage site, Caceres, known for its Roman, Moorish and conquistador architecture and was the first city in Spain to be listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Like Salamanca, Caceres will be new Spanish territory for me and I look forward to getting to know its historical charms."
