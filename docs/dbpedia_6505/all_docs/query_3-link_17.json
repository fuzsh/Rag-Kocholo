        "text": "As the oldest university in Spain and third in Europe, the University of Salamanca was founded in 1218 by King Alfonso IX. Through its outstanding academic and cultural programs and its superior facilities, still maintains its reputation for being the best university in Spain, as well as one of the finest in Europe, ranking among the Sorbonne, Oxford and the University of Bologna. The student population is approximately 28,000. Through the partnership with the USAL, JMU students have access to all support and facilities at the host university. In spring 2013, we celebrated 25 years of partnerships and collaboration.\n\nSalamanca, located in northwestern Spain about two hours from Madrid, retains its enchanting medieval character. The city of Salamanca is ideal for foreign students because of its beautiful setting and small size (population of approximately 170,000). It is a great location to explore and experience the Spanish culture and history. Salamanca is enriched with theatres, concerts and museums that represent the cultural dimension of Spanish history.\n\nUSAL Exchange Website\n\nUSAL Fact Sheet\n\nUSAL FAQs\n\nUSAL Student Resources\n\nApplicants must have a 2.7 GPA and be in good standing with the university.\n\nStudents must have the equivalent of 300-level of Spanish or above.\n\nApplicants must have completed their first year of JMU before going abroad.
