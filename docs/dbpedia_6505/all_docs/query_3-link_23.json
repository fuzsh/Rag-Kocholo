        "text": "SALAMANCA\n\nSalamanca, known as Spain's 'golden city', is a lively and vibrant university city and a World Heritage Site in Spain's Western part. Salamanca is a mix of old and new, tradition and innovation, leading to a unique and refreshing atmosphere. The University of Salamanca is the oldest in Spain and the third oldest university in Europe, dating back to 1218. Today, Salamanca is a magnet for international students.\n\nSalamanca is magical, whether it is in the early morning with the sunrise or in the late-afternoon light. The monumental highlights of ornate sandstone architecture and fascinating museums are all located within the historic centre. Both the old and new cathedrals are celebrations of Renaissance and Gothic styles. The central 18th century Plaza Mayor is one of the most beautiful plazas in Spain! The plaza is also the place to try some delicious food or go to the big central market to try the fantastic cheeses and delicious cured meats.\n\nAs Salamanca is centrally located in Spain, it takes only just two hours to travel to Madrid; or you can take a quick hop to the Portuguese border. Enjoy the countryside along the way with lakes, rivers, mountains, canyons and quiet villages."
