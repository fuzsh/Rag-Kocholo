        "text": "Throwback to Spain Study Abroad 2012\n\nPin the Below Image to Keep Handy\n\nSalamanca, Spain is the capital of the Salamanca province in the Castilla y León region. It is known for its ornate sandstone architecture and for the world famous Universidad de Salamanca.\n\nDuring May and June 2012, I participated in a study abroad program through my college James Madison University (JMU). I studied abroad in the university city of Salamanca, which is located near the Portuguese border. I absolutely had a BLAST during my early summer semester in Salamanca and it in fact sparked my wanderlust! (You heard that right, prior to studying abroad in Spain, I had never stepped foot out of the United States!) The difference between studying abroad and traveling leisurely for a week or two is that you have the opportunity to live like a local: go grocery shopping and run errands, interact with the locals, attend work or school and have your own apartment. I always love to reminisce back on the days I studied in Salamanca and I hope this blog post gives you the inspiration to travel to this beautiful region of the world and experience all of the amazing adventures I had during my time there. After spending time in Western, Central and Northern Spain as well as Portugal, I officially fell in love with travel and it changed my life forever! (Click here to read my blog posts on Spain.)\n\nSalamanca is a beautiful city filled with historical wonders, one of the best plaza mayor’s in Spain, amazing restaurants and cafés, fun bars and so much more. Below is a list of my favorite things to do in Salamanca, Spain.\n\n**Please note that this blog post uses affiliate links meaning that if you make a purchase via my affiliate link, I receive a small commission at no additional cost to you. I only promote and talk about products and services that I have used and like.\n\nGetting to Salamanca:\n\nDuring my study abroad trip in Spain, I was with fellow students and professors the entire semester. It was so early into my travel life that the idea of traveling on my own didn’t even exist in my mindset. In that case, we always had organized coach buses take us everywhere.\n\nIf you are traveling to Salamanca on your own or with friends and family, it is best to book your flights through Skyscanner to Madrid. From there, you could either rent a car and drive (Salamanca is between 2.5 to 3 hours west of Madrid depending on traffic) or you could take the train through GoEuro .\n\nWhere to Stay:\n\nThere are plenty of hotels to suit all budgets in the city of Salamanca. You could also find a plethora of Airbnbs as well as hostels . (Everything in Salamanca is within walking distance.)\n\nThings to do in Salamanca:\n\nHang Out in the Plaza Mayor:\n\nIn Spain, every major city has a public square called the Plaza Mayor. This space is usually located in the center of the city and is used as a popular gathering area for locals. Restaurants, helado (ice cream) shops, clothing and jewelry boutiques, pharmacies and other small businesses and tourist buildings line the plaza. The Plaza Mayor of Salamanca is widely regarded as one of the most beautiful plazas in Spain as it features gorgeous Spanish-Baroque architecture.\n\nThe Plaza Mayor was surely one of my favorite places in Salamanca! During the day, the plaza is filled with different people and entertainment. One of the best parts of the Plaza Mayor in Salamanca is when it lights up around 9:30/10pm at night! (The sun sets late in Spain.) The magical golden lights make you feel like you’re in a dream. Ps. You may even spot a flamenco dancer both at night and during the day in the plaza. (Click here to read about my flamenco experience in Sevilla.)\n\nIndulge in Spanish Delicacy:\n\nNot only is Spain beautiful and fun, the FOOD is absolutely delicious! Since we were living on Spanish time, my friends and I would go to a café and sip on some delicious café con leche (coffee with milk) while enjoying a chocolate croissant or churros con chocolate. Around 1 or 2pm, we would eat a heavy lunch prior to taking a siesta for a couple hours and then enjoy a light dinner around 8 or 9pm. (Admittedly, the two-hour siesta made such a big difference for us college students at the time.)\n\nMy favorite Spanish dish was (and still is) seafood paella. No matter what restaurant you choose to eat at in Salamanca, you are guaranteed to get amazing paella if you order it! Another awesome Spanish favorite of mine is a bocadillo with jamón Ibérico (Iberian ham sandwich). This amazing sandwich was the perfect afternoon snack to pick up after class or touring around the city. All throughout Salamanca, there are several butcher and sandwich shops where you could grab fresh jamón on a baguette. One of my favorite things to do when I studied abroad was pick up a sandwich and sit down on a bench in the plaza or at a nearby park.\n\nFor dessert, there is nothing better than getting some chocolate. Spain definitely has some of the BEST hot chocolate in the world! Growing up, my family used to take regular weekend trips to Hershey Park in Pennsylvania (my dad went to college in that area) and I always swore that Hershey had the best chocolate. Well, Valor Chocolateria in Spain will definitely change your life even more. (Hershey is still amazing though and I highly recommend going to the park if you are visiting the Northeast.) Valor is conveniently located a little past the Plaza Mayor in Salamanca. This amazing place offers different chocolate of all types and you can get it on anything you wish. One of Valor’s signature items is melted chocolate on a baguette. It was so yummy! Although everything in Valor is amazing, the hot chocolate is hands-down my favorite! It is like drinking warm pudding or melted hot fudge since it is thick and rich. Even though Valor’s hot chocolate is the most satisfying when it is cooler outside, I easily drank it on an 80-degree day as well.\n\nIn addition, Spain is also known for their small plates called tapas. Even though the Andalusia region is known for tapas, nearly every bar in Salamanca will serve a tapa with a drink order too. One of my favorite tapas are patatas bravas, which are potatoes served with an aioli sauce. My other favorite tapa dishes are chorizo (Spanish sausage), calamari with lemon, potato and jamón croquettes as well as a tortilla de España (Spanish omelette). Of course, pairing any of these tapas with delicious sangria, wine or beer hits the spot!\n\nWalk the Roman Bridge:\n\nAnother one of my favorite places in Salamanca is the Roman Bridge located on the Rio Tormes (Salamanca’s famous river). Built in 89AD, this great bridge leads from the center of the city to the outskirts of town.\n\nThe side closer to the city center overlooks beautiful houses and trees as well as Spanish countryside. The other side of the bridge has a gorgeous view of the center of the city with the beautiful Catedral de Salamanca in the background. In the middle of the bridge, you can look at a dam and the water that runs underneath.\n\nThe Romans built 26 round arches made out of granite, cement and concrete. During the 1600s, a flood took away 11 of the bridge’s arches. Nowadays, the Roman Bridge is used for pedestrian use only.\n\nTake a Stroll through the Cathedrals:\n\nThe Catedral de Salamanca has two cathedrals attached to each other: the Old Cathedral (Catedral Vieja) and the New Cathedral (Catedral Neuva). The older of the two was built between the 1100s and the 1200s and it features Romanesque and Gothic styles. One of my favorite parts of this side of the cathedral were the chapels and within that contained the solemn tombs of medieval bishops and nobility.\n\nThe New Cathedral, on the other hand, was completed in the 1700s and is enchanted with a mixture of styles within its architecture. Inside of the cathedral features beautiful renaissance paintings and details to admire for days.\n\nClick here to discover more churches and historical landmarks in Salamanca.\n\nWander through the House of Shells :\n\nCasa de las Conchas (House of Shells) is home to Salamanca’s library and is a wonderful Gothic palace that features decorative façades, walls with scallop shells and a wonderful interior courtyard.\n\nThe scallop shell is the symbol of the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage in Spain. The Silver Way route starts in Sevilla and goes through Salamanca. Even though I didn’t do this exact route, I completed the Camino de Francés pilgrimage in July 2019. (Click here to read about my experience on the Camino de Santiago.)\n\nPretend you’re a Student at the Universidad de Salamanca:\n\nFounded in 1134, the Universidad de Salamanca is the oldest university in Spain and the fourth oldest university in the world (behind the University of Al-Karaouine in Morocco, the University of Bologna in Italy and the University of Oxford in England). This beautiful university is one of the main reasons why thousands of international students study abroad in Salamanca.\n\nDuring our first week studying abroad in Salamanca, we did a fun scavenger hunt around the city and one of the first things we had to find was a frog sitting on a skull on the university’s main façade. It is extremely difficult to spot, but once you find it, you have found good luck!\n\nJust like most universities worldwide, the Universidad de Salamanca has a nice square where students will sunbathe; enjoy time with friends and study. It is a great place to read a book as well or even take a nap!\n\nVisit the Palacio de la Salina:\n\nThe sacred Palacio de la Salina offers beautiful medallions in their courtyard and you can even see a renaissance carving of Cleopatra. The courtyard is the palace’s 16th Century most sublime feature, where a gallery is supported by expertly carved corbels and an ornate Renaissance clock keeps time. Another awesome thing about this place is that they even offer homemade Spanish cookies for visitors!\n\nTake a Sacred Journey to the St. Stephen’s Convent :\n\nThis holy 16th Century Dominican monastery features a beautiful stone stairway and peace all throughout the building. When you step outside to marvel at the Cloister of the Kings, you can spot some of the world’s biggest storks and their massive nests overhead. It is so cool! (Another great place to spot storks in Europe is in Alsace, France.)\n\nHave a Picnic in the Love Garden:\n\nAnother one of my favorite areas in Salamanca was the love garden. Hidden secretly in the town, the love garden is the perfect place to escape the busy city center and enjoy peace and serenity, while admiring all of the beautiful flowers. My friends and I would enjoy coming to the garden with a bottle of wine and a few tapas. It was also a great place to get some homework done. If you come to Salamanca with a significant other, make sure to get a lock for the lovelock well!\n\nExperience Salamanca’s Nightlife :\n\nBeing a world-renowned college town, Salamanca has some of the best nightclubs, bars and pubs to dance the night away. I LOVE Spanish music and one of the best things about going out in a small city where not many people speak English is that you really get to immerse yourself in the culture. Every party destination I’ve been to in Europe tends to play Top 100 American music, but in Salamanca, you can truly enjoy dancing to authentic Spanish music until the crack of dawn.\n\nSalamanca, Spain holds a special place in my heart because not only did I live and study abroad there during summer 2012, it was also the first foreign country I visited and it was where my love for travel developed. I hope you all get the opportunity to travel to Salamanca and experience the place I called home when I was 20 years old.\n\nIf you have any questions about my study abroad experience in Salamanca or have general questions about Spain, please email me at info@browneyedflowerchild.com.\n\nBasic Facts of Spain:\n\nCurrency: Euro, Capital: Madrid, Time Zone: Central European Standard Time\n\n*Anything could happen during your travels.

It is known for its ornate sandstone architecture and for the world famous Universidad de Salamanca.\n\nDuring May and June 2012, I participated in a study abroad program through my college James Madison University (JMU). I studied abroad in the university city of Salamanca, which is located near the Portuguese border. I absolutely had a BLAST during my early summer semester in Salamanca and it in fact sparked my wanderlust! (You heard that right, prior to studying abroad in Spain, I had never stepped foot out of the United States!) The difference between studying abroad and traveling leisurely for a week or two is that you have the opportunity to live like a local: go grocery shopping and run errands, interact with the locals, attend work or school and have your own apartment. I always love to reminisce back on the days I studied in Salamanca and I hope this blog post gives you the inspiration to travel to this beautiful region of the world and experience all of the amazing adventures I had during my time there. After spending time in Western, Central and Northern Spain as well as Portugal, I officially fell in love with travel and it changed my life forever! (Click here to read my blog posts on Spain.)\n\nSalamanca is a beautiful city filled with historical wonders, one of the best plaza mayor’s in Spain, amazing restaurants and cafés, fun bars and so much more. Below is a list of my favorite things to do in Salamanca, Spain.\n\n**Please note that this blog post uses affiliate links meaning that if you make a purchase via my affiliate link, I receive a small commission at no additional cost to you. I only promote and talk about products and services that I have used and like.\n\nGetting to Salamanca:\n\nDuring my study abroad trip in Spain, I was with fellow students and professors the entire semester. It was so early into my travel life that the idea of traveling on my own didn’t even exist in my mindset. In that case, we always had organized coach buses take us everywhere.\n\nIf you are traveling to Salamanca on your own or with friends and family, it is best to book your flights through Skyscanner to Madrid. From there, you could either rent a car and drive (Salamanca is between 2.5 to 3 hours west of Madrid depending on traffic) or you could take the train through GoEuro .\n\nWhere to Stay:\n\nThere are plenty of hotels to suit all budgets in the city of Salamanca. You could also find a plethora of Airbnbs as well as hostels . (Everything in Salamanca is within walking distance.)\n\nThings to do in Salamanca:\n\nHang Out in the Plaza Mayor:\n\nIn Spain, every major city has a public square called the Plaza Mayor. This space is usually located in the center of the city and is used as a popular gathering area for locals. Restaurants, helado (ice cream) shops, clothing and jewelry boutiques, pharmacies and other small businesses and tourist buildings line the plaza. The Plaza Mayor of Salamanca is widely regarded as one of the most beautiful plazas in Spain as it features gorgeous Spanish-Baroque architecture.\n\nThe Plaza Mayor was surely one of my favorite places in Salamanca! During the day, the plaza is filled with different people and entertainment. One of the best parts of the Plaza Mayor in Salamanca is when it lights up around 9:30/10pm at night! (The sun sets late in Spain.) The magical golden lights make you feel like you’re in a dream. Ps. You may even spot a flamenco dancer both at night and during the day in the plaza. (Click here to read about my flamenco experience in Sevilla.)\n\nIndulge in Spanish Delicacy:\n\nNot only is Spain beautiful and fun, the FOOD is absolutely delicious! Since we were living on Spanish time, my friends and I would go to a café and sip on some delicious café con leche (coffee with milk) while enjoying a chocolate croissant or churros con chocolate. Around 1 or 2pm, we would eat a heavy lunch prior to taking a siesta for a couple hours and then enjoy a light dinner around 8 or 9pm. (Admittedly, the two-hour siesta made such a big difference for us college students at the time.)\n\nMy favorite Spanish dish was (and still is) seafood paella. No matter what restaurant you choose to eat at in Salamanca, you are guaranteed to get amazing paella if you order it! Another awesome Spanish favorite of mine is a bocadillo with jamón Ibérico (Iberian ham sandwich). This amazing sandwich was the perfect afternoon snack to pick up after class or touring around the city. All throughout Salamanca, there are several butcher and sandwich shops where you could grab fresh jamón on a baguette. One of my favorite things to do when I studied abroad was pick up a sandwich and sit down on a bench in the plaza or at a nearby park.\n\nFor dessert, there is nothing better than getting some chocolate.
