        "text": "Alice Wallace Here I Am Mule Kick\n\nThe latest album by Alice Wallace was constructed around some life-changing episodes endured by the Nashville-based artist at the time of writing. Not afraid to lay bare her vulnerabilities, she bravely visited emotionally raw terrain across the eleven songs. Wallace moved to Music City four years ago after spending a decade in California, where she was named Female Vocalist of the Year in 2017 by the California Country Awards. HERE I AM was recorded in two days at The Loft and The Studio in Nashville and features some Music City top-notch session players. Despite being written and recorded in Nashville, the sound is very much in the classic West Coast country rock school.\n\nIt may or may not have been an anticipation of approaching thunderstorms and difficult times when Wallace named her 2019 album INTO THE BLUE. Either way, it cemented her reputation as a leading light in modern country music and most likely to achieve household recognition. As with others, her momentum was halted by the arrival of COVID-19 and the personal issues she was dealing with. However, the lockdown didn't find Wallace sitting on her hands; quite the opposite. Teaming up with fellow singer-songwriter Caitlin Cannon, they formed their side project Side Pony, writing and eventually recording an album, ironically called LUCKY BREAK. A mixture of powerhouse retro-pop and country ballads, the duo aired the songs via often hilarious live streams until the world opened up again, and they headed off on tour, Thelma and Louise style.\n\nHERE I AM finds Wallace returning to her tried and trusted template of heart-melting and confessional songs delivered in her note-perfect and stunning voice. 'Someday someone's gonna find out my biggest secret, I know they will. It's just a matter of time….. I've worked damn hard off for this epic fall from grace,' she ponders on the album's opening track, Imposter. An arrow straight to the heart and an admission of self-doubt and uneasiness, it's an opening chapter for what follows, songs that may have been testing to write but ultimately lead to emotional release.\n\nThat self-doubt surfaces in the beautifully expressed country ballad, I Was Wrong, and the equally soul-searching Dancin' to the Beat of My Heartbeat. The two tracks emphasise Wallace's ability to vocally shift confidently between the calm and the muscular. Her close friend Caitlin Cannon shares songwriting credits on the soulful Better Than This and the title track. Both songs, not surprisingly, have their emphasis on the positive rather than the negative.\n\nSunken and unfulfilled dreams may have provided the ammunition for HERE I AM, but the lasting impression after each subsequent listen is one of acceptance, rebirth, and renewed confidence. Alice Wallace may have encountered a mid-career wobble, but she is back to her best with a confident swagger with this easy-on-the-ear collection of most impressive songs.\n\nDeclan Culliton\n\nCyrena Wages Vanity Project Self-Release\n\nDespite previously being a member of three bands and landing a record and publishing deal with her first band, Friends of Lola, Memphis-born Cyrena Wages has had to wait until her early thirties to release her debut album, VANITY PROJECT. Ironic and cynical as the title may seem, the ten-track album digs deeply into Wages' upbringing from her early childhood as a pageant queen, the demands of a small-town religious upbringing in the south, spreading her wings and moving to Nashville with stars in her eyes, and the resulting frustrations of a decade in that city.\n\nBorn and raised in Millington, Shelby County, Tennessee, into a musical family, she was exposed to Stax soul music and old-time country by her parents from an early age. However, what left the most lasting impression on Wages was her years on the pageant circuit ('I think it's the most screwed up thing in the world, it's like everything that's wrong with the conditioning of Southern women'). The move to Nashville after high school was also far from memorable and resulted in disillusion and rejection despite working the system, recording formulaic music that never got released, and eventually returning to Memphis. The tales of unfulfilled and broken dreams could have ended there, but with innumerable memories to draw on, Wages translated those headaches into ten often dramatic songs.\n\nEvoking the sound of Memphis more so than Music City, the soulful instrumentation and overall vibe supplied Wages with the perfect platform for her soaring multi-octave vocals. Having worked on the songwriting with R&B and jazz guitarist Joe Restivo, that Memphis connection was cemented by engaging Matt Ross-Spang as producer and recording at his now-famous Southern Grooves Studio in Crosstown.\n\nStandout tracks are the mid-tempo opener Are We Allowed to Fall in Love and the title track, which particularly hits the bullseye. The fluidity of Carried Away recalls Frazey Ford at her most soulful, and the bittersweet Heartbreaker is a nostalgic tearjerker.\n\nVery much a 'beauty born out of chaos' album and one written under the pandemic blues umbrella, VANITY PROJECT is a body of work by an artist who may be a late bloomer but has kicked off her recording career in fine style.\n\nDeclan Culliton\n\nKiely Connell My Own Company Thirty Tigers\n\nThere has been a marked increase in confessional and open-hearted recordings in the past few years, following the pandemic and enforced lockdown. Dealing with mental health issues, relationship breakdowns and substance abuse, the majority of these recordings are from women, a pointer towards their new fearlessness in publicly bearing their souls by confronting thorny issues. The subject matter has generated credible songwriting and several standout albums, rather than anything sounding manufactured or industry-formulated. Recent albums by Sarah Gayle Meech, Amelia White and Diane Coll immediately come to mind.\n\nIndiana-native, Nashville-based country and roots artist Kiely Connell's sophomore album, produced by Tucker Martine (Neko Case, REM, The Jayhawks), falls into this category. It charts traumatic memories, a broken relationship, body shaming and, most importantly, recovery and rebirth.\n\nRestless Bones revives bitter memories of the funeral of a high school friend after she took her own life. A haunting and image-generating song, it stands shoulder to shoulder with Lucinda Williams' Pineola in detailing the trauma of unexpectedly losing a close friend. Consent, entitlement and the mixed signals of modern dating are aired in the fiery Damn Hands, with Connell vocally spitting fire in front of a rugged guitar riff. The excesses, both liquid and pharmaceutical, all too easy to fall foul of the routine life of the artist, are addressed in Through To You. It's a particularly slick slice of roots rock that recalls Kathleen Edwards at her most animated. Connell's weather-beaten vocals on Anaesthesia channel the numbness and isolation endured at the lowest ebb after a relationship break up.\n\nThe album concludes with a committed and reinvigorated theme following the confessional and darker material. On The Mend points towards moving on from life's complexities, and the title track is one of forging ahead as a free spirit ('Cause maybe I could still turn out to be the girl of my dreams and find that all I want to keep is my own company').\n\nKiely Connell has turned up the heat a number of notches with My Own Company. Her 2021 album CALUMET QUEEN was a striking introduction to a vocalist and songwriter not afraid to confront the darker side of hardship and survival. The savage intimacy and emotional outpourings on this album more than make good on the promise of that debut album. It's a riveting listening experience and a reminder that art often provides much more than simply entertainment. Let's hope it gets the exposure and attention it richly deserves.\n\nDeclan Culliton\n\nJason McNiff Everything’s A Song Tombola\n\nAn English songwriter of great repute, Jason McNiff brings his lyrical guitar style to a ninth album, just two years on from his last release Tonight We Ride, which was entirely focused of cover versions. He sings in a quiet vocal tone and the folk leanings in his writing provides the perfect foil for his gentle songs. Run Away With the Circus is an example of his independent persona and style, with the lines ‘My mind is a woman, my heart is a man, and together they do the best they can, I’m just a child with a childish plan, to run away with the circus.’ Clever wordplay and nice imagery to fuel the imagination. The electric guitar on These Dreams Of You is nicely knitted into the acoustic melody and a counterpoint to the sentiment of love unrequited.\n\nThere is no doubting the influence of Bert Jansch in these song stylings and I also hear the sweet tones of Mark Knopfler, especially on My Mississippi and True Love, Freedom. No bad thing either, as learning from your mentors and matching their inspiration in your own music is certainly carrying the torch forward. A cover version of Bella Ciao, a folk song from the 19th Century, is perhaps the only potential weak point, the arrangement sounding somewhat laboured and out of place on the album.\n\nThere is a story song called Chef Song in the best English folk traditions and the inclusion of Wedding Dance highlights the violin of Richard Moore along with Hammond organ on a sweetly performed instrumental. McNiff contributes on guitars and Hammond organ while producer Matt Armstrong adds bass, drums and percussion. Jude Montague appears on pump organ, Hammond organ, and vocals, alongside both McNiff and Armstrong.\n\nThere is a blues feel to No Good For You with a nice electric guitar solo that wraps the message ‘Too much truth is no good for you.’ The final song is the album title Everything’s A Song and draws joy from the simple things in life and takes a perspective that all experiences are part of an all embracing colourful vista. There is a light sense of playfulness throughout this enjoyable album and it’s another fine example of the talents on display from Jason McNiff.\n\nThe Electrics Big Pub In the Sky Self Release\n\nOriginally formed in 1988, this Celtic rock band from Dumbarton, Scotland, is comprised of Sammy Horner (vocals and bass guitar), Paul Baird (guitar), Dave McArthur (drums) and Allan Hewitt (saxophone, keyboards). Over subsequent years, various members came and went, while the band played on, and nine albums were released between 1991 and 2014. They never officially called it a day and any hiatus in subsequent years was occasionally punctuated by live gigs in different shapes and forms. There has always been an evident chemistry from the first time they played together that endures.\n\nOn this return project the original gang of four are joined by former member Tim Cotterell (fiddle, mandolin) who returns to the family, and the ten tracks are a joyous celebration of all that is good in the Celtic rock tradition. Yes, you will hear, on occasion, a sense of the Pogues in the boisterous arrangements, and at other times, the Waterboys, in the uplifting melodies and the vocal delivery of Sammy Horner, but throughout is the unmistakable edge that has made the Electrics such a celebrated act wherever they perform. Matters kick off with a global warming message in Big Train Coming and a sense that a day of reckoning is on the horizon if we are not willing to change our ways.\n\nBig Pub In the Sky and Fall From Grace are fine examples of the celebratory sound that the Electrics produce, with everything turned up full throttle and the clever lyrics sprinkling some magic dust upon proceedings. The River Flows and Happening To Me are more considered and highlight the softer, more lyrical side to the band as they contemplate their place in the greater scheme of things.\n\nWe All Have To Row is a prime example of the philosophical themes that are addressed, with the ocean of life tossing us on the waves of change in our little lives ‘ We’re in this boat together, and we all have to row.’ It’s a standout song and one that will no doubt endure in the years to come. If the end of days is indeed upon us with the weakened condition that the world has fallen into, then songs like Brand New Start and Best Is Yet To Come point to a faith in our beliefs and our spirituality to find fresh optimism in a future that dwells beyond our mortal forms.\n\nThe final song Yesterday’s Rain resolves to leave the listener with a message of hope and the will to endure through all the hard times, as the writer encounters a wise old patron in a local bar ‘The cold wind will blow all the sleet and the snow, The dark clouds of anguish will bring each one pain, With a wink of his eye he raised his glass high, This fine glass of whiskey was yesterday’s rain.’\n\nThere is much to admire on this fine album and it is a testament to both endurance and individuality. For this band of brothers to be creating music that remains stimulating, vibrant and very Zen, is not only rewarding, but also inspiring. You should add this album to your collection with all haste.\n\nNick Taylor Not Alone Self Release\n\nAustin, Texas is home to this singer songwriter and this is his debut album. Taylor has been bracketed as an Americana artist but in truth there is as much Country influence in the ten tracks that are featured here. He went to Nashville to record the album and used some of the best session musicians available, so this certainly colours the sound and the final results.\n\nTaylor wrote all the songs and he plays acoustic guitar in addition to taking all lead vocals. His voice has a deep resonance and the powerful delivery expresses a quiet confidence in what he is doing. The studio musicians really step up to the plate and the arrangements on all songs are very impressive with the understated ensemble playing prominent in the mix.\n\nStandout tracks like Songs About the Glory and Broken Souls display a great maturity and look at different aspects in relationships, both good and bad. There are story songs and Getting Along spins out a tale of two loners who meet on a desert highway. Love comes in different forms and who can say what works out best in the end. Another song, Kentucky Girl drifts along on a sweet melody of piano and guitar looking at desire and the need to be loved.\n\nOn the other hand, Futures Past looks at the loss of a relationship and memories of a Summer spent in hedonistic pleasure. 3AM On the Interstate also looks to challenges in a relationship and concerns of slipping back into a life that is best left back in the past. The fiddle and mandolin on Dead Land Future are very atmospheric on a song that deals with the pain of trying to start over ‘ I blew both my shoulders at the age of 23, Working towards another man’s dream.’\n\nHeart On the Run is traditional country with organ and guitar riding the beat while the song reflects ‘I got a 20-year history of feeling like a fool.’ Don’t let life pass you by is the abiding message and on Carry You Home the sentiment is one of care for one another and comforting the lost. Dogs has a rock groove and looks at making changes as inner resolve pushes you towards better days.\n\nThe musicians that play on the album are David Flint (various guitars, mandolin), Wayne Killius (drums), Dave Francis (bass), Chris Nole (piano, keyboards), Deanie Richardson (fiddle), Pat McGrath (acoustic guitar), James Paul Mitchell (pedal steel, dobro), and Billy Thomas (backing vocals). The entire project proves to be well worth the investment made by Nick Taylor in shaping these songs in such an impressive fashion. His instincts pays dividends throughout a strong debut album.\n\nPaul McGee\n\nThe Makers Out Bloodlines/Hope Self Release\n\nThis musical project is the brainchild of founder Scott Bell. He is based in Tulsa, Oklahoma and is known as a music producer, composer, and photographer. He has written scores for modern dance, played in the band Buffaloswans and toured with Julianna Barwick and Sigur Rós, among others. This debut album was produced by Bell and he also wrote all eleven songs that play out over a listening time of one hour.\n\nThe official website states that the album represents ‘a culmination of many years of evolution birthed from ancestral struggles, victories, unspoken words, forgiveness, and reconstruction.’ Although this sounds like a statement of disproportionate aggrandizement, Bell also is quoted as saying “I feel like my music is spiritual in nature, I do not write songs regularly, but wait for them to write themselves through me.”\n\nThe music is a potent mix of roots, country, folk and 70s psychedelic rock, all presented in heady soundscapes and style. The swirling synth sounds of opener Holy Water lay out a message of peace and community and lead into Golden Driller which explores the hope that is held out for a relationship to unfold and bring joy. Throughout, a sense of peace permeates everything with drifting pedal steel (Roger Ray) and harmony vocals building a great atmospheric backdrop to the synth (Chris Combs, Scott Bell) and guitar melodies.\n\nThe big production sound and keyboard swell on Hallelujah breaks down to simple piano on the outro and seamlessly segues into Lhasa and a sweep of gentle melody and mood. The lack of a lyric sheet is disappointing as the words are hard to make out but the swathes of instrumentation bear a clear message of spiritual awakening. The heavenly vocals on Stillborn, courtesy of Libby Decamp, are particularly attractive and on the credits the singers are listed as Sarah Maud, Liz Coffman, Jillian Rutherford and Jesse Aycock. Bell plays guitar, organ, piano, drums and sings, while also using studio musicians on woodwinds, trombone, trumpet, cello and violin to swell the lush sound on specific tracks.\n\nPsychic Geography is very memorable with a nice rhythmic beat before drifting into ethereal directions with vocal echo and instrument reverb as it meanders back towards the original groove. It’s one of the longest tracks at eight minutes plus and it is followed by Blood a melancholic instrumental piece with marimba and violin mixed into the guitar treatments and synth sounds. The title track follows and images of big skies and endless horizons come into view, framed by mountains and a sense of the land speaking on the gentle breeze.\n\nReligion is a song that looks at dogma and the human habit of ignoring the obvious. It’s a soulful sound that has nice harmony vocals and piano before it takes off into the heavens on layers of guitars and keyboards. The final track is the longest, clocking in at almost nine minutes, and Five Hundred Million Pounds Of Memory is anti-war and a message of loving awareness with acknowledgement to those who sacrificed in the name of freedom. This is a huge project with many interesting roads to walk down. Overall it is a panorama of what was once referred to as the Hippie dream, a way to come together and spread messages of love and peace. Certainly worthy of investigation.\n\nPaul McGee\n\nWill Kimbrough For the Life Of Me Self Release\n\nThis American singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and producer grew up in Mobile, Alabama. It is no exaggeration to say that he has influenced the contemporary country and folk scene as much as any of his peers over the last few decades. His output is peerless in terms of the amount of music he has created, collaborated on, or assisted in its development. This album is his eight solo project and the eleven tracks are superbly crafted, as you would expect.\n\nIt has a raw energy and a stripped back sound with Kimbrough providing vocals, guitars, and keyboards, with Chris Donohue on bass and Bryan Owings on drums and percussion. The atmospheric Southern Wind is a highlight, with the brooding slow melody and tasty guitar dynamics mixing with the lyrics that carry a sense of foreboding.\n\nThe jangling guitar on The Other Side reflects a Tom Petty sound and the laid-back groove on I Don’t Want To Start A War takes a look back at the idealism of the 60s peace movements and the lost message of peace and love in the present political divide and corporate complexities. River Of Roses is a song that tackles past crimes against the civil rights movements who fought bravely for equality and freedom, with reference made to the beatings suffered by leader John Lewis at Selma, Alabama in 1965.\n\nClotilda’s On Fire also stands out with the musicians kicking up quite a storm in memory of the last known U.S. slave ship to bring captives from Africa to the United States, in 1859. The song suggests that we are still living with the ghosts of those evil times and it’s certainly something that still divides class and communities in modern society. The title track is a gentle acoustic ballad that bemoans the differences between those who profess to seek communication, especially in personal relationships.\n\nEvery Day seems to be an aspiration for a happier world and the sing-along chorus belies the sense of separation that permeates other songs on the album. Are things really getting better? The jury is out… Final track When This Is All Over has a nice rockabilly swing with harmonica and guitar parts lifting the message of forgiveness and moving forward. This album is certainly a highlight in an illustrious career and Will Kimbrough can be more than pleased with the results.\n\nPaul McGee\n\nLeaf Rapids Velvet Paintings Self Release\n\nThis band is from Winnipeg, Canada and this is their third album release, and a follow-up from the superb Citizen Alien that appeared back in 2019. The band have a lovely laid-back sound that fits perfectly into a roots-americana lane on the endless highway of music genres, and their sweetly structured songs come highly recommended. The band is comprised of Keri Latimer (songwriter, acoustic guitar, lead vocals, theremin), Devin Latimer (bass guitar), Joanna Miller (drums, supporting vocals, whistling), and Chris Dunn (electric guitar).\n\nThe opening song, and title track, has a real personal manifesto, with the words ‘When I get my shit together, I’ll be a force to reckon with, Possessor of self-discipline, Not dreaming the day away.’ Songwriter Keri Latimer taking back control of her life amid the reality of increasing corporate greed in the world and the sense of feeling overwhelmed in the face of all today’s negative media ‘Don’t be so melodramatic, It’s just a semi-automatic, Anyone can get one down the street.’ A healthy sense of irony is indeed required!\n\nStarling To A Starling is a love song that has a melody similar to the iconic Chris Issak track Wicked Game but with sweet pedal steel and guitar lines tickling the senses. Fast Romantics is a very giddy love song served on instant desire and pleasure with a seductive delivery to highlight the playfulness in the lyrics ‘Found a fast romantic, In a Dollarama Isle, Rows of shiny plastic, And your Dalai Lama smile,’ all modern kitsch on demand and a superb guitar break courtesy of Chris Dunn.\n\nSilver Fillings is a real highlight and shows the sophisticated and subtle lyrical qualities of Keri Latimer. Questions concerning the durability of love itself and also, quite a coup to conjure up a song around dental work and abstract thoughts ‘My silver fillings are sometimes receivers, First time it happened I thought it was Jesus, Funny the things that can lead to salvation, Holes in my teeth and a radio station.’ Bravo!\n\nNight Shift uses the whistling skills of Joanna Miller to such great effect that the sound is exactly like a theremin, superbly echoing the sense of isolation in coming off work in the twilight hours and entering into the new day ‘My quiet industry, In the hours that memories keep, The fox and owl agree, The darkest hours are not for sleep, Here on the night shift, We tuck the days in one by one’ - oh so eloquent and evocative…\n\nParamjit’s Sonnet is such an enduring love song that captures the essence of true, unequivocal devotion to another in the purest way, strings elevating the melody and Keri giving such a beautiful vocal performance of emotion from the heart. Selfless love in all true colours. As a contrast, In the Woods captures that sense of peace coupled with a certain awareness of otherness when we walk along in nature ‘There are stories in the trees, Every ring a memory, It’s like they’re trying to find the words, Something’s stirring in the woods, If we only understood.’\n\nTrepidatious Celebrations is an interesting inclusion and seems to channel a moment in time where a birthday gift is shared between lovers under curfew conditions in perhaps Covid lockdown or during wartime? The final song Insomniac Show captures the heady days of youth and two students sharing fun and Beaujolais wine late into the night ‘We were insubordinate humanitarians, With revolutionary plans to stick it to the man, Now I’m selling real estate and knock-off Melvin Kleins, Did you once say you loved me out beside the BFI?’ The reference to a waste management plant (BFI) is telling, the insight and perspective razor sharp, as a mirror into our collective psyche that often ends up settling for some form of compromise in adult years.\n\nSpecial guests include Geoff Hilhorst (Rhodes and Hammond A-100), Bill Western (pedal steel), Natanielle Felicitas (cello), and John Paul Peters (violin). Production is by John Paul Peters and Keri Latimer and the recording took place at Private Ear Recording in Winnipeg,. All songs are written by Keri Latimer except Night Shift written by Joanna Miller, and Paramjit's Sonnet a co-write with Paramjit Singh.\n\nThe playing and the live feel is so perfectly captured and the players elevate the songs as a collective in their interplay. Let’s call the whole experience one of Canadicana; a specific genre that bottles the songcraft of truly gifted artists and ideas embedded in their culture. The nine songs included run for an immersive thirty-six minutes, leaving you just wanting more. Then again, one can always hit the repeat option to indulge yourself all over again. As roots music goes this is one of the strongest albums of the year.\n\nPaul McGee\n\nAlice Wallace, Cyrena Wages, Kiely Connell, Jason McNiff Nick Taylor Music, The Makers Out, WILL KIMBROUGH Leaf Rapids\n\nAnnie Bacon and her Oshen Storm Self Release\n\nAn entire album that is based around the issues of grief and loss may seem like a daunting task for the listener. Could it turn out to be an exercise weighed down by onerous self-reflection? Happily this is not the case and this project wraps the songs in a blanket of compassion and empathy. It takes a real gamble to place your raw emotions on such public display and yet, by making the deeply personal into something that embraces the universal, Annie Bacon delivers a healing in the power of her music.\n\nHaving suffered a series of losses in recent years, Bacon reflects upon the various stages of grief and channels the realisation that it can take on various guises. Divorce is one form of real loss, and in dealing with this, the death of your ex-Mother in law brings additional challenges to the emotions. When you are also hit with the sad reality of having to say goodbye to your best friend, the pain is palpable. Bacon also lost her father, who passed away before the Covid virus closed the world down and the end result of all this death has been a period of self-analysis and pouring all manner of confused disbelief into the songs that appear on this new album.\n\nThe ability to cope and indeed endure is also at the heart of these fourteen songs, The conclusion drawn is that sitting back in the moment and acknowledging these feelings as they arise, and staying grounded until they pass, is the real key, and a code by which you can chart the unfolding of the rest of your life.\n\nThe loss of relationships, and the grief that death unlocks, all culminate in heartbreak and a deep sense of also losing a vital part of who you are as a person. These songs cover the full range of such loss and uncover real emotions along the road to ultimate healing. Secret Broken Heart looks at the cost of hiding pain inside and putting on a brave face to the world. Mist is a song that sees the reality of losing yourself to grief and the remedy to solve matters by coming into the moment and sitting still with the pain. California Heat is written in memory of her best friend who died, and the image of a hiking trail and the isolation of being alone in nature brings a coping mechanism.\n\nWalk A Little Farther covers similar territory with the resolve to keep going and not submit to crippling inaction under the weight of loss. Alone With Grief is probably the defining song in this woodland of sadness with the words ‘ No one can walk your path for you, But so many have and so many do, Feel alone with grief tonight.’\n\nRealising a relationship is over and having the courage to leave normality and routine behind is at the heart of songs Can’t Remember, When Will I Learn and Love Can Mean, with the latter song capturing the essence ‘But if you’re twisting yourself into knots just to stay, And you’re screaming to be heard but ignored anyway, And the illusion of peace is not a price you can pay, Remember that love can mean walking away, You can love yourself enough not to stay, That’s okay.’ Wise words that show a resolve to develop a perspective on the slings and arrows that life throws your way.\n\nThe final song is Worry and has a message that the problem can indeed be worry itself. By letting it go you can open up a new vista that leads to happiness - ‘Or maybe worry is the trouble, Maybe I should worry a little less.’ The excellent band is worthy of the highest praise for the way in which they wrap these songs with a protective cocoon of care and creativity.\n\nThe musicians are Annie Bacon (guitar, vocals), Paul Defiglia (bass, keyboards, synthesiser, organ, drum machine), Thomas Bryan Eaton(guitars, pedal steel, mandolin), and Anson Hohne (drums, percussion) make up this band and the album was produced by Annie Bacon & Paul Defiglia in Natural Daylight Studios, Nashville. All songs are written by Annie, with one co-write.\n\nAnne Bacon is an Ann Arbor resident and a singer-songwriter and guitarist of real depth and quality who took her fledgling steps in the industry with the release of a debut album in 2012. She built upon this when a further album appeared in 2019. I may be wrong about Annie’s performing name but I think that OSHEN is a variation of Ocean, it’s power and vastness capturing our sense of place, surrounded by all this tranquillity and mystery. A really fine album and worthy of your exploration.\n\nPaul McGee\n\nThe New Leaves A Sketch Of Home Corn Crake\n\nThere is a gentle contemporary Folk sound in the music of Irish quartet The New Leaves. Based in the seaside town of Warrenpoint, a small port town in Co. Down, the members are Declan McKay (guitar, vocals), Cian O’Hare (guitar, mandolin), Patrice McKevitt (bass) and Paddy Goodfellow (drums, percussion). Together they make a very soothing sound with a collective approach in their song arrangements of ‘less-is-more.’ They are childhood friends and the band was formed in 2022.\n\nMother Nature features quite a lot in the lyrics of Declan McKay who writes all the songs and his affection with the locale comes through on songs such as Donaghaguy Reservoir, In the Shadow Of the Mournes and The Lights From Omeath, a small village on the Cooley Peninsula. The ensemble playing is very engaging and the harmony vocals of Patrice McKevitt are particularly bright in the production mix. The sense of separation and space brought to the album recording by Steve Fearnley is impressive and the project was recorded at Narrow Water Studios in Warrenpoint.\n\nThe inclusion of cello on the album is an inspired choice and the lyrical playing of Ben Triggs elevates the songs throughout, Maggie’s Island being a particular highlight. The sense of easy reverie threads these songs into a tapestry that is very appealing and tracks A Silk Road To the Moon and Rocky Mountain River include some subtle guitar work from Cian O’Hare, who also contributes harmony vocals. The drumming of Paddy Goodfellow is nicely judged and he never overplays, expertly supporting the song arrangements as evidenced on the very pleasant Away With the Fairies. Across these thirteen songs there is a real sense of joy, and the sentiment on A Giant Murphy Favour is one of standing tall for each other and facing the challenges with an open agenda.\n\nAll in all, a very accomplished debut album and I look forward to hearing more from this talented group on their developing musical journey.\n\nPaul McGee\n\nGerry Spehar and Friends Other Voices Self Released\n\nThis album is a compilation of songs that were written by Gerry Spehar and performed by a number of artist friends who recorded his work over a period that spans four decades. The album title is very appropriate in that, across the twenty tracks, the consistently strong writing is given a chance to see the light of day through the interpretations of others, and we can celebrate the talent of this Colorado songwriter who has been creating music since his teenage years.\n\nHe initially cut his musical teeth by playing in a 1970s band with his brothers George and Tom. After a period of going solo he hooked up with long-time associate Bobby Allison and together they had increasing success during the 1980s. Gerry then stepped back from the music business to work a day job and raise a family but he never stopped writing and his guitar was always on hand to partake in any sessions that were going down. After a break of 30 years he returned to the recording studio in 2017 and he has released four albums over recent years, making up for lost time.\n\nThere is a stellar cast of musicians that appeared on these recordings over the years, and far too many to list. All songs were written by Spehar, including nine co-writes, four with Mike Becker and five with Bobby Allison. Two of the songs appeared on a previous album DELTA MAN (2022), with the inclusion of Train, Train, Train and Rockin’ On A Country Dancefloor. In fact, the latter song appears on each of these two discs with different versions provided by Teresa James and Gary F. Floyd. Both tracks are highlights on a very strong compilation that includes contributions from Dale Watson, Lisa McKenzie and Lisa Daye.\n\nThere is plenty to appeal across the different styles that range from traditional country to soulful ballads, taking in blues and rockabilly sounds also. The slow burn of What He Said and Georgetown are complimented by the sweet melody of Angel, Grandpa’s Daisies and The Last Person; balanced against the up-tempo Lovin’ Proof, Do Whatcha Used To Do and Joanne. There are also love songs and Both Ends Of the Rainbow and The Longer I Love You are excellent examples of this songwriter’s craft. A very rewarding album and one that I’m sure will bring plenty of pleasure to those who like well-crafted songs.\n\nPaul McGee\n\nKrista Detor Chaos, Collisions and Clocks Tightrope\n\nWhile this ‘best of’ collection dates back to 2019 it is a timely reminder of the deep well of talent that dwells within the creative muse of Krista Detor, a singer-songwriter based in Bloomington, Indiana. Over the course of her career Krista has delivered eight recordings that highlight her songs and playing skills in a manner that leaves an enduring trail for those who wish to follow the yellow brick road that leads to her door. This collection was produced by Krista and her husband Dave Weber at their Airtime recording studio which is based on their farmland and attracts many musicians who avail of the professional and extensive facilities on offer.\n\nKrista has a very expressive voice that is arresting in it’s sweetly delivered tone, both wistful and knowing; yet forgiving and universal in capturing the ache and yearning contained within the dichotomy of living. Krista speaks of the spectre of depression that visits many of us at certain points in our lives and in having the bravery to investigate the source and tackle it head on. Where does that sense of sadness come from? Is it perhaps self-doubt at a young age that turns towards unwarranted inner reflection? Could it be caused by a distorted vision of oneself?\n\nThis collection contains only one song from her great breakthrough album MUDSHOW (2006,) which brought her overnight media attention and praise. Indeed, the follow up album COVER THEIR EYES (2007) only merits two songs here, and it is the twin releases of CHOCOLATE PAPER SUITES (2010) and BARLEY (2016) that feature mostly, each contributing four tracks.\n\nGiven the wealth of choice across the span of her career, Krista has chosen her personal favourites and this album is full of truly great moments. The haunting Deliver Me and the personal reflection of self-liberation on Hear That are just two stand-out moments among many. Also included is the excellent More Than I Can Say and the delights of Clock Of the World, For All I Know and Icarus. There are three bonus songs also included and these unrecorded tracks show that Krista continues to write music of great insight and beauty. Plenty for everyone to enjoy and if you have yet to become aware of this superb artist and her many talents, then this album is a fine place to start. File under ‘buried treasure.’\n\nIn recent times she launched The Hundredth Hill Artist Residence and Retreat in Bloomington and much of her energy has been focused on making this enterprise a success, with its rolling green woodlands and creative spaces that attract artists and leaders from across genres, disciplines, and borders to find inspiration and focus.\n\nKrista also delivered a TEDx talk in 2022 that focused upon ‘Shattering the Looking Glass Self’ and an insight into the career arc of this very entrepreneurial talent. It is well worth finding on your social media and it will certainly inspire.\n\nPaul McGee\n\nDavid Starr Better Me / Starr and Stucky Self-Titled Cedaredge\n\nTwo releases from the talented David Starr over the last 12 months and both are examples of the fine qualities this songwriter possesses. Better Me is a six track EP that runs for twenty-plus minutes and includes the talents of Matt Bubel (drums, percussion), Jimmy Mattingly (fiddle), Dan Dugmore (steel, electric guitar), John Reno Prentice (electric guitar), Irene Kelley (background vocals), Michelle Prentice (background vocals), Mark Prentice (bass, keyboards), with acoustic and electric guitars played by Starr. The songs are all written by David Starr and the delivery is a roots rock sound with the musicians very much front and centre in the groove.\n\nTitle track Better Me is a hope for inner growth gained from ongoing maturity, while the softer Some Angels Fly shows another side to the ensemble playing, and a tune that reflects upon a friend who has passed away. The rock beat of Poison the Water brings a great dynamic with the guitar riff driving a song about corporate thirst for power and the soulful vocals are particularly impressive. Because You’re Right is a love song that plays along on a gentle melody and harmony vocals that reflect upon a doomed relationship. Closer To You is another roots rock arrangement that allows the musicians space to express their individual skills.\n\nThe closing track Any Chance Of Going Home is a song about circumstance and fate where the timing in a relationship is always out of step. There are some lovely fiddle and piano parts and a lyric that reflects ‘Sometimes circumstance lays waste to best laid plans and it’s years until we find out what it means.’ Starr sings in a very clear vocal with a nice tone and this adds character to the song arrangements. The music was recorded in Nashville, at Addiction Sound Studios, and was produced by Starr and Mark Prentice.\n\nThe second release Starr and Stucky is an acoustic album with friend and mandolin player Erik Stucky. The record is comprised of reworked acoustic versions of original setlist favourites and the nine songs come from five different albums in Starr’s discography with three tracks featured from THE HEAD AND THE HEART(2017) and SOUTH AND WEST (2018). The production and the playing is very impressive and full of nice moments with guitar and mandolin stretching out in stellar fashion throughout. Good As Gone comes bursting out of the traps before the slower Waiting In the Dark brings a more reflective tone. Other songs like Don’t Give Me Hope, Night Rolls Around and Edge Of the World continue the laid-back feel and the considered interplay between Starr and Stucky is beautifully realised.\n\nHead and Heart is a great example of the understated melody that both players dance around with the reflective lyric echoing the sparce arrangement and simple song craft. Cabo San Lucas is a cover of a Toby Keith song and is delivered in a Tejano fashion with mandolin lifting the song to new heights. Another fine album from this Colorado-based musician who delivers on a regular basis with soul infused vocals and a fine writing sensitivity.\n\nPaul McGee\n\nJoana Serrat Big Wave Great Canyon\n\n\"This is the foundation of who I am now. It's the best album of my career so far, and I don't think I'll ever be able to put out an album like it again,\" declares Joana Serrat on her latest and most soul-searching album.\n\nPacked with emotions that range from anger to exhilaration, sonically, the album is a significant departure from the Catalan singer-songwriter's previous work, fuelled by a period of personal transition, the loss of both her grandparents, the demise of a long-term relationship and the onset of another one. That's not to say she hasn't previously been afraid to move outside her comfort zone. Her 2017 album DRIPPING SPRINGS was an ethereal psychedelic affair produced by Israel Nash and recorded, with the aid of his backing band, at Nash's Plum Creek Studios in Texas.\n\nFor Big Wave, Serrat collaborated with producer Matt Pence and recorded at The Echo Lab Studio in Texas. The characteristic reverb, a sonic signature of Serrat's previous work, is more pronounced, drawing comparisons to P.J. Harvey and Liz Phair. The guitar work of Joey McClellan, a longtime collaborator, is central to the album's sound, with McClellan also credited as co-producer.\n\nWith her foot firmly on the cosmic pedal, opener The Cord, Big Lagoons, and Sufferer find her pushing out the boundaries and exploring previously unvisited sonic territory. She returns to more familiar ground with This House and Freewheel, and the album's underlying themes of lost love and grief are pronounced in You're With Me Wherever I Go and Broken Hearted.\n\nPrepare to be transported to a different place from that expected with BIG WAVE. It may take a few visits to settle into, but the time invested is well rewarded.\n\nDeclan Culliton\n\nElaine Palmer Half Moon Rising Butterfly Effect\n\nI don’t recall encountering this singer/songwriter before, but on this encounter she is someone worth investigating. She was born in England in the North Yorkshire Moors, but travelled to the US often to Arizona. She was interested in music for a long time and use the two countries as inspiration for her material. There are folk, country and Americana influences from a place where the roots of those were largely intertwined. She spent time teaching songwriting and signed a publishing deal for her own work and has recorded a number of prior releases while continuing to tour.\n\nIn 2023, Palmer went to California to work with producer Mike Butler in a week long session, recording the album in mostly live sessions, something that, when you have the right musicians involved, can offer positive results capturing the live essence of a group of players. They were those who Butler worked with previously in San Diego, including Dave Berzansky’s pedal steel, Theron Wall and Bobby Furgo’s strings and Butler’s own guitar work - all of which immediately became cornerstones of the album. They are given a good foundation by the often understated rhythm section of Matt Lynott and Patrick McClory. However, from the opening bars of the first song, it is the clarity and strength of Palmer’s vocal that give the album its identity and personality.\n\nThere are eight songs on the album that are observations on the varied conditions of love and a consciousness of landscape, a similar working pattern to many of those working in the Americana scene who draw from a comparable set of stimuli. It is, doubtless, the result of homing her melodic and lyrical skills that may have produced her best release to date.\n\nThe album opens with Heart And Soul, which sees her welcome an old flame who she sees is still “all fire and fool / how the years have changed you … I just wanted to feel your heart.” She wishes for love that is real and unquestioning in A Love Like That, yet seems tinged with a sadness to notice “my dreams have been and passed / through the eyes of my child I live now.” This sense of melancholy carries on with So Long, realising that “if there are many fractures / then we may never go back into one piece.” This is a ballad with plugged violin and strings to enhance that mood. One song would seem to be returned to, judging by the title, Let Me Fall (revisited) wherein she knows that she “can’t catch myself in here / so let me fall into you.”\n\nSomewhat more affiliated with place but not without emotion is Freebrough Hill. It has a more impassioned vocal that has a distinctive crack, making it appear more fraught as the song builds, with the guitar mirroring the sentiment with deftness and effectiveness. The lyric may reveal something of the substance and source of its hard message with “judged only by a man of cloth / who has never had to endure / the things that I have.” Not Lost has an electric folk feel that will appeal to many who have missed that blend of storytelling and powerful guitar. It accepts that though broken she is not lost - again the steel guitar is paramount to the frame of mind that is expressed. On The Way Up hopes to meet in happier times with the thought that may be relevant to many who would echo the feeling, often expressed, that “youth is wasted on the young / wisdom lies with the old.” This the offered from someone with life experience to draw that thought from. Another stripped back arrangement is used for The Last Dance, the violin used to portray Palmer’s belief that she was mad from fire and rain so that she can leave rainbows. A pretty good sentiment to end the album on.\n\nWhen taking account of the lyrics, in their written form, you might assume that this is a somewhat sombre album. But Palmer, like many artists who look into the darkness, can see a light and help others to see it too. It is a short eight track album but nothing is lost in its brevity, indeed the short space of time in which it was recorded added an energy that makes the album vibrant. Palmer’s moon, it would seem, is on the rise.\n\nStephen Rapid\n\nJoe Ely Driven To Drive Rack‘Em\n\nThe moment you hear that big jumbo acoustic following by the immediately recognisable voice of Joe Ely, accompanied by the accordion of Joel Guzman, Drivin’ Man motors you into the world created by the iconic singer/songwriter over a long career of outstanding music. The next track is the one that will doubtless garner much attention - Odds Of The Blues is a simple duet between two friends and mutual admirers. Ely and Bruce Springsteen‘s voices blend especially well over a simple backing of acoustic guitar and bass from Ely and electric guitar from Jeff Plankenhorn. For Your Love will be readily identifiable to fans from its band enhanced previous version. Here it is stripped back to acoustic guitar, accordion and vocals. Of course Ely has previously released the album LIVE CACTUS where he was solely accompanied by Guzman. Watching Them Semis Roll is another song about traveling the highways of America, this one written by his Flatlander’s companion Butch Hancock.\n\nMore beat laden is Didn’t We Robbie which sees Ely playing electric drums with Mitch Watkins on electric guitar and Bill rockin’ out on roadhouse piano. I’m sure it will make many nostalgic for Ely’s earlier full band and full blown recordings. Similarly Ride Motorcycle finds Watkins on synths and guitar with Ely also on electric guitar. This track fairly puts the pedal to the metal and it has the kind of raw elemental rock that has worked through the history of rock ’n’ roll. The title track uses an actual drivin’ drummer in Pat Manske and again Plankenhorn is the lead guitarist. Contrastingly, with San Antone Brawl its all down to Ely on his todd. Again you can see the power in his voice as an instrument in its own right, a timbre that gives the human touch to these songs. The diction is always clear and you can follow the lyrical themes easily as he tells these tales of outlaws, outsiders and outcomes.\n\nThe electric drums are used again on the border feel that pervades Slave To The Western Wind, with Guzman and fiddler Richard Bowden adding to that hot wind ambiance while, as the title might suggest, Gulf Coast Blues has a feel related to that particular strand of music, with the accordion doing what a harmonica might otherwise have done in similar circumstances. It also suggests that Ely could do a similar thing to Jimmie Dale Gilmore by working with Dave Alvin to good effect. Jackhammer Rock, a song written by Donald Elwood Dykes, closes the album with Ely playing synth and guitar - something that is partially of a nod to the time he experimented with electronics back in the day. Eddie Beethoven is the harmony singer here. The remaining tracks were all written by Ely and show that he is also a engaging writer as well as performer.\n\nSo what you have is a collection of songs that have existed in one form or another for some time. The title is a recognition of a restless, seeking, traveling persona that was with him from the start. For instance, the title song is one that he started out writing in 1986 and is only now reaching its final destination on this album. The songs were recorded over a long period of time in his Spur Studio either as demos or initial sketches. They are songs that are fundamental to the notion of discovery or, occasionally, disclosure that not everything takes you to where you might want to be. None-the-less the need to carry on carrying on is undoubted. I have listen to many of Joe Ely albums in the past and seen him live on numerous occasions, both solo, with his band or as a member of the Flatlanders. He doesn’t disappoint, so long may he continue to ride.\n\nStephen Rapid\n\nSUSS Birds & Beasts Northern Spy\n\nAnyone remember the band Rubber Rodeo who, not unlike Wall of Voodoo in intent if not sound, tried to merge electronics with a Country and Western sentiment? They emerged from Rhode Island in the 1980s and released a number of albums before calling it a day. Two members of that band were Gary Leib and Bob Holmes, synths and guitars respectively. These gentlemen are key members of SUSS who have been described as ‘ambient country.’ Here on this new release which quite possibly lives up to that description, they are joined by former associate Jonathan Gregg on pedal steel and Pat Irwin on multiple instruments. The end result is a sound that could as easily reflect a desert landscape, moving clouds or slow moving water, diving into the landscape of the mind and floating along with its diffuse current. At times it is peaceful, at others there is a hint of unforeseen menace.The acoustic and steel guitars are a bedrock over which the other sounds stream and infuse.\n\nThis is an album that offers a sense of tranquility, that can be heard as a background element or as something that helps to create a more focused imagined visual. Others attracted by the two cornerstones may well find it irritating or confusing. It is very much a musical setting that lets the listener find their own label for what they have heard. It does tend to remind me, to a degree, of some of the music released by the German label Sky back in the 70s and 80s, or some similar sounds of the Brian Eno/Daniel Lanois album APOLLO.\n\nThat the various members have remained as band mates since their earlier incarnation shows that they have likely developed an instinctive understanding of how to work together as a unit, without having to use that much communication for them to express their vision.\n\nIt would now appear they are a trio who are working together without Leib - at least that’s how they are portrayed on their website. They have a following for the music they play live or on record. The website offers numerous samples of their work together which is, perhaps, the best place to decide on where you might place their endeavours. Are they birds or are they beasts?\n\nStephen Rapid\n\nAnnie Bacon, The New Leaves, Krista Detor, David Starr Music, Joana Serrat, Elaine Palmer, Joe Ely SUSS\n\nKeegan McInroe Dusty Passports and Empty Beds Self Release\n\nFort Wort, Texas is home to this musician who has six previous releases since a debut appeared back in 2008. The nine songs included are a mix of contemporary country and americana sounds and the musicians who recorded the album are Clint Kirby (drums), Aden Bubeck (bass), Patrick Smith (bass), Matt Tedder (guitar), Gary Grammer (harmonica), Chris Watson (piano, organ, keys), Jeff Dazey (saxophone), Dirt Stinnett (fiddle, mandolin, gut string), Hannah Owens (vocal), and Morris Holdahl (vocal).\n\nMcInroe plays guitar and sings lead vocal in addition to writing all of the songs, apart from one cover version that is included in the form of the John Prine classic Lonesome Friends Of Science. The songs came together over the Covid lockdown when McInroe found himself at his mother’s home in Dublin, Texas where he was able to experience an extended break from the life of a musician and the touring commitments involved. The death of John Prine clearly left quite a mark on McInroe as he name checks the legendary songwriter on the title track, along with other notable names who also died during the pandemic.\n\nAnother song is dedicated to the country troubadour and John’s Songs resonates in the words ‘Now he's got to shake God's hand, And I've got you, And we still got all the songs he left to help us through.’ The easy groove of Ey Brother references the changes that were manifest during the lockdown with much uncertainty in the air – guitar and saxophone blending in the melody. The traditional country sound of Thanksgiving Night has some nice interplay between fiddle and guitar as McInroe misses the rituals of the past and ends up eating in a diner on such a landmark day. There is a honky-tonk feel on the track Only To Be Songs with some tasty piano runs and harmonica playing over the beat.\n\nEat, Drink and Be Merry is a slow melody that captures the sense of living in the moment and putting worry aside ‘With some food in your belly, and a roof overhead, And some clean water flowing, and a dance in your step, Have a party, have the best time.’ The final song is Traveller’s Wind and the urge to be back out on the road is as strong as ever ‘But still this lonesome road’s my home, And I'm as restless as I've been, Never too long in one place, Til I'm moving on again’ – the life of a working musician perfectly captured. Co-produced by McInroe and Grant Wilborn at 7013 studios in Fort Worth the album is a solid statement of a talented artist and the fine musicians do everything required to support the sweet vocal performance.\n\nPaul McGee\n\nThe Fugitives No Help Coming Fallen Tree\n\nA Folk-Roots band that is based in Vancouver and has been creating music since their formation in 2007, with the group essentially made up of duo Adrian Glynn (vocals, guitars, bass, balalaika, piano, percussion), and Brendan McLeod(vocals, guitars, ukulele, banjo), who create the music and write the songs. They are joined by Carly Frey (vocals, violin) from The Coal Porters and Chris Suen (vocals, banjo, ukulele) from Viper Central.\n\nThis sixth release has a central theme around climate change and although the title No Help Coming suggests that we are all beyond saving, the sentiment is more that of waking up to the fact that the only solution to our earth’s problems lies solely with all of us, as a species. On this album the collective are joined by Sally Zori (drums, percussion) on three songs and Cole George (drums, percussion) on six others. Producer Tom Dobrzanski contributes on Hammond B3 organ and the project was recorded at Monarch Studios in Vancouver.\n\nThe vocal harmonies are very engaging and impressive across the songs and highlights like Wing and a Prayer, Edge Of the Sea and the title track are laced with a lightness that belies the serious nature of the topic. The slow dynamic on Advice is a change of pace and the song arrangement is very memorable with the words resonating ‘You’re the church where my kids speak in tongues, You are the man who owns the man with the gun.’ Elsewhere we have enduring message of hope on Not Burning Out and the words ‘In a way I can see it now, only thing that matters is the way you love, Edge of the heavens is a world of doubt, I’ll be here when the lights go out.’ An impressive album that will be enjoyed for the excellent musicianship and timely message delivered in a colourful fashion.\n\nPaul McGee\n\nThe Felice Brothers Valley Of Abandoned Songs Million Stars\n\nThe thirteen songs recorded for The Felice Brothers’ latest record consist of previously written material by Ian Felice from sessions for the band’s 2019 album, UNDRESS and ASYLUM ON THE HILL, which arrived somewhat unannounced and was released only on Bandcamp at the end of 2023. Initially intended to be only released online, that changed when Ian Felice shared a collection of the songs with Conor Oberst, who, impressed by what he heard, offered to release the material as the first project from his new label, Million Stars. The common denominator is that all the material was recorded live in a one-room church built in 1873 and acquired and renovated by Ian Felice, located in Harlemville, New York.\n\nThe Felice Brothers have come a long way since their formation in the Hudson Valley in 2006. The current line-up, their longest-lasting and arguably their strongest, features frontman, guitarist, and songwriter Ian Felice, James Felice on piano and backing vocals, Jeske Hume on bass, and Will Lawrence on drums.\n\nThe soul-stirring lead single, Crime Scene Queen, inspired by Humphrey Bogart’s character in the movie The Big Sleep, was a pointer toward the quality we could expect from this record, and the remaining material lives up to that standard. Ian Felice possesses the Midas touch as a writer with the gift of delicately handling bleak and mysterious themes and, as is the case on this album, often expressing real-life matters through the eyes of the unfortunate and outcast.\n\nWith a charmingly ragged and stripped-back sound, the band leader's unrushed vocal deliveries invite the listener into his tales of simplicity and innocence (Flowers By The Roadside, New York By Moonlight), lost love and regret (Black Is My True Lovers Hair, Stranger’s Arms), and hopefulness in the face of despair (To Be A Papa, Tomorrow Is Just A Dream Away).\n\nAn album that sounds like it has been around forever, VALLEY OF THE ABANDONED SONGS is another timeless collection of songs by the Felice Brothers that deserves your fullest attention from start to finish.\n\nDeclan Culliton\n\nKaitlin Butts Roadrunner Soundly\n\nTaking inspiration from a mid-1950s Rodgers & Hammerstein musical may seem like an unusual and daring starting point for a country album, but that's precisely what Kaitlin Butts did for her latest album, ROADRUNNER. The Oklahoma-born and raised artist, now living in Nashville, drew on her love of musicals as the building blocks for the album and, not surprisingly, chose the one closest to her heart. The musical Oklahoma includes many of the hallmarks that raise their head in Butt's songwriting, such as love won and love lost, murder and humour, and she channels them all to create a modern-day country concept album.\n\nMore than simply a whim, the songs also reflect Butts' state of mind at the time of writing. She opens with the musical's overture, Oh What A Beautiful Morning, renaming it My New Life Starts Today, a statement of the good place she was at the time of writing and continues to be in. The mood is a departure from the darkness of her last album, WHAT ELSE CAN SHE DO, which dealt with issues she and her mother had encountered at that time. In contrast, Butts is in chipper form this time around, although she does include some darker songs alongside the more upbeat numbers.\n\nThe title track is a 'hundred mile an hour' blast and recitation of her touring lifestyle; I'm still determining if I'll hear a song this year whose melody took as long to shake off as a summer cold. A pointer toward her continuing rising star from the shy young artist that we witnessed strumming a guitar and singing solo at Americanafest some years back is the artists that came on board to guest or co-write with her. Vince Gill didn't hesitate when asked to add his vocal to the cowboy ballad Come Rest Your Head, the song's origins came from a woman wearing a tank top that read 'cowboy's pillows' on her chest, as Butts recounted in a recent interview with Lonesome Highway. Other high-profile artists also lent a hand. Sharing writing credits are Natalie Hemby (Other Girls, You Ain't Gotta Die To Be Dead To Me), Courtney Patton (Elsa) and Angaleena Presley (That'll Never Be Me).\n\nThe seventeen-track record also includes a couple of well-chosen covers. Bang Bang, previously recorded by Cher and Nancy Sinatra, is given a relaxed makeover. Kesha's Hunt You Down, which is very much a thumbs-up for female empowerment, gets a countrified makeover. Loaded with attitude, You Ain't Gonna Die could have been borrowed from Loretta Lynn's songbook, and it is noticeable how Butts reverses the traditional country trait by having male singers do the spade work as backing vocalists on a number of tracks. She also shows her sweet side by sharing the vocals with her soul mate and husband, fellow singer/musician Cleto Cordero, on People Will Say We're in Love.\n\nThe album has Kaitlin Butts’ personality stamped all over it and very much reflects what you experience at her live shows. She's ballsy, witty, rocky, loud and delicate in equal doses. A delightful and profoundly satisfying listen, Butts' career will most likely take a massive step forward with ROADRUNNER. It's tailor-made for her eye-catching live shows and captures everything impressive about her.\n\nDeclan Culliton\n\nJim Lauderdale My Favorite Place Sky Crunch\n\nThe title of Jim Lauderdale's thirty-seventh album may refer to his adopted home, Nashville, or may be a nod to his present-day touring and backing band, The Game Changers. Either way, it's business as usual for the artist known as ‘Mr. Americana’, a respectful accolade given that Lauderdale has represented every genre in American music throughout his career.\n\nThe Game Changers, Jim Lauderdale's present-day touring and backing band, play a significant role on his latest album. Comprising Frank Rische on guitar, Lille Mae Rische on backing vocals, Craig Smith on guitar, Jay Weaver on bass, and Dave Racine on drums, they perfectly complement Lauderdale's soulful country music. Their collaboration was evident in Lauderdale's 2022 album, GAME CHANGER, and continues to shine in MY FAVORITE PLACE. The album also features Music City big-hitters like Tommy Detamore, Steve Hinson, and Micah Hulscher, adding depth and variety to the music.\n\nLauderdale's output is staggering. He has released an album every year since the turn of the century, except 2005, and yet his output never seems repetitive or forced. This album finds him in a relaxed mood, and no more so than on the tracks Mrs Green and The Laughing Tree. Both are Tom T. Hall-type story ballads; the former, written by Bob Minner, is a tale of unrequited love, the latter a love-letter, tender-hearted ballad. Both are delivered impressively in 'crooner' style. The piano-led Baby Steps sounds like a restrained Jerry Lee Lewis offering, and Sweethearts Remember is a jazzy, swinging affair. The album is bookended by What's Important After All, sage advice from a craftsman who always has a few tricks up his sleeve.\n\nIt's business as usual, a characteristic Jim Lauderdale album, extremely easy on the ears and with a cast of players whose playing ebbs and flows behind his distinctive country vocals.\n\nDeclan Culliton\n\nSilverada Self-Titled Prairie Rose\n\n‘Back in the day, all we wanted to do was play the Broken Spoke,’ says Mike Harmeier, recalling the early aspirations of Mike and The Moonpies, the band he formed in his early twenties. That dream did come true and, over the band’s seventeen-year history, they graced that hometown honky tonk stage many times before heading off to play bigger venues, festivals and eventually The Ryman and The Grand Ole Opry, with their rootsy brand of Texas country.\n\nThis self-titled album finds the band relaunched under the name Silverada, following eight previous albums by Mike and The Moonpies. Silverada is band leader Mike Harmeier (vocals, guitars and keys), Taylor Englert (drums, percussion), Omar Oyoque (bass), Zachary Moulton (pedal steel, dobro), and Catlin Rutherford (guitar). Hailed in many quarters, including Lonesome Highway, as one of the most dynamic live bands of recent years, and despite gaining a dedicated cult-like following, Mike and The Moonpies’ commercial success hardly reached the level they deserved. The band’s name was a tongue-in-cheek decision made by Harmeier, not for once thinking that their fame would spread beyond the dusty local bars where they first played.\n\nWhatever the reasoning behind the name change, lovers of their previous albums need not be alarmed; this ten-track collection cements their reputation as ambassadors of powerhouse Texas country music. Although somewhat sonically experimental at times, it’s not a vast departure from their previous work either, crisscrossing some full-on rockers and reflective ballads.\n\nThe inspiration for the songs came from an unusual source. Harmeier holed up in his home office and dived into a number of random books that he had bought at a charity shop. Whatever the background, the stories in the songs are rich in detail and content, with the writer revisiting observations collected from endless hours and miles on the road, together with matters closer to home. The former surfaces on Load Out, Anywhere But Here, and Radio Wave (‘One foot on the gas and one foot in the grave’), the latter emerges on Hell Bent For Leather, Stubborn Son and the stand-out track, Stay By My Side. With echoes of Willie Nelson, it plays out like the writer’s life story as he attempts to balance life on tour and home life (‘I get homesick at home and sick on the road’). Interestingly, the previously noted Radio Wave includes a thought-provoking dig at the music industry’s genre-creating hype (‘Americana is a myth, I told ya’)\n\nAs in their previous work, razor-sharp guitar licks and large doses of dreamy pedal steel complement Harmeier’s vocals. The band’s name may be different, but their collective qualities ring true. Let’s hope Silverada’s fanfare surpasses the previous band’s hardcore following. Based on the collection, that is more than deserved.\n\nDeclan Culliton\n\nGrant Langston Alabama Self Release\n\nThis album comes with a cautionary back story as, prior to its original release date ,Langston found his music had been pirated and put online under someone else’s name. Hopefully that has now be sorted and he can rightfully claim these songs. It was recorded in a number of studios in California with one session engineered by the renowned Ted Russell Kamp - who contributed some occasional trumpet and trombone. He is joined on the different tracks by a number of musicians from the locality. Langston himself played guitars, bass and Wurlitzer as well as contributing the fine lead vocals.\n\nWhat we have here is a mix of country roots and some more Alabama oriented Southern sounds. It is a combination that works well and Langston’s self written songs tell their own tales of cheating, traveling, seeking and inevitably some drinking, but with a little wryness that suggests that it not be taken too seriously (even if it was made that way). Its aim is to please and it does so with a sway of choruses that are easy to catch. Langston, however, delivers these with a certain amount of grittiness and determination too.\n\nBased now in California, he grew up in Alabama under the influence of his father’s listening habit of classic country radio, but less of the habitual honk-tonk Saturday night sinning syndrome. Here he learned to play and to love music for its healing and restorative elements. However, the next few years saw him as a sideman in a number of rock bands. Eventually he connected with the music that was prevalent in his youth and wanted to return to that. He has now matured with that music and continues to put his own slant on those varied influences.\n\nThe opening song Country Or Bust is an uptempo journey from city to a dream of something more rural. It sounds a reversal of what many did in the past even if the song is rooted in that past. How Much Do You Want? immediately appeals with its California country drive and gains from the trumpet break that makes it an album highlight in its ode to steadfastness. That sense of seeking to rely on trusted things and people is where This Old Truck comes, with its strong chorus and Langston varying his vocal stance as the tracks require. The longest song is the 60s vibe of This Heavy Load, clocking in at over five minutes, thematically it would be appreciated by fans of The Band or those bands who were influenced by them.\n\nThe rockin’ vibe is also present in Pure Grain Guarantee and glides along with keyboards and guitar and some soulfulness, and Langston is joined on the choruses by The Hawthorns. There’s twang afoot with As Is Sale, Sing Along and the opening track, all with their concise references to the reliable Bakersfield sound. The latter opens acoustically and is more in the heartland country sound with some telling lyrics of a sad and strained relationship between a father and son, as the son recounts his father’s life and death story - but with a tenderness that may have been absent during their time together. Not a unique story by any means but one delivered with an understated passion.\n\nThere is a solid beat that underscores the fast-paced Keep It Coming, a song that celebrates love and does so with some aplomb and introduces some banjo in the fade out to spice things up. It possibly sits at odds with a song like Corporate Hack, when the diversity of having two roles in life don’t always gel to anyone’s satisfaction. The fiddle infused story Jailbird is at odds with its musical outlook but, given that the inmate is thinking of the day he might be free, it is an appropriate realisation of that feeling.\n\nThere seems to be something of a resurgence of the particular sound and attitude that has come to represent the more outward looking assimilation of influences that come to determine California country right now, with some of these who might be considered veterans of that scene releasing albums that will do much to keep that important scene in people’s minds and hopefully giving some wider exposure to others emerging too.\n\nStephen Rapid\n\nMatt Hillyer Bright Skyline State Fair\n\nThis new album from Matt Hillyer picks up from where his last release GLORIETA left off in 2023, offering again a smorgasbord of what would be some Austin approved country roots amalgamations. Again it is produced by John Pedigo who worked on the previous album. There are some Austin stalwarts involved including noted pedal steel practitioner Lloyd Maines, bassist Kevin Smith (currently stroking their four strings for Willie Nelson), Heather Stalling on fiddle, drummer Arjuna Contreras and additional bass player James Driscoll. Hillyer still has a way with words that, on occasion, are co-writes with the likes of Max Stalling and Mando Saenz - both well know songwriters in their own right.\n\nHillyer fronted Eleven Hundred Springs in the past and through numerous albums as a band. Since then he has been able to write songs for himself rather than for the band as an entity in itself. Part of his musical heritage was rockabilly, alongside traditional country influences. Both are touchstones here along with some classic rock ’n’ roll moves. This album has a pretty open outlook and is not without moments of humour, based on real life observations, not least Moving Away which details his relief, and that iofseveral other neighbours, when a somewhat arduous family decided to change location. The frustration is abated somewhat by the ability to see some humour in the episode.\n\nIn other songs he gives us some unrestrained love songs that detail his deep admiration for a particular partner. It Would Take A Miracle (“to take me away from you”), If I Had Everything I Want (“you’d be at the top of my list”) and If I Didn’t Have You (“I probably wouldn’t be here”), which has a swinging sound with fiddle and upright bass. There is some deep baritone guitar at the opening of Did She Ever Want To Live Like This, a song that wonders how anyone could have stuck with a situation that never seems to change and what could have ensued in a different situation, something that makes him think that despite her saying with some obvious affection that “Baby, don’t think so much,” … having the realisation that in fact “lately I’ve been thinking maybe I don’t think enough.” The arrangement of the song is restrained enough to make the sentiment seem that much more real.\n\nThe opening track What Are You Doing Now? simply asks that proposition of an ex who has moved on and is full of regret for not making it work. It is delivered with some harmonies that help to give the uptempo song its place at the head of the album as a pointer to the goods on offer, fiddle and guitar helping it to flow. Another direction is taken with the ballad format of the pitiable thoughts of Even An Angel - forgiveness can only go so far and that “even an angel gets the blues.”\n\nThe title track looks to a more positive future, while Green Eyes describes a femme fatale. There a touch of a late night lounge with the jazz influenced guitar and slow paced mood on Honey Do Blues. Overall the sentiment of the closing tracks rings true across the board, recognising that what we face is A Daily Fight. It closes out what is an enjoyable, upbeat collection of songs that are an affirmation of the long running skills that Matt Hillyer has brought to his music from the start. This album has the hallmarks of those skills, not only as a songwriter and singer as well as a top notch guitarist, but someone who is still learning and loving what he does as he continues to look to the next song, the next one that feels right - so that the future is looking bright.\n\nStephen Rapid\n\nDave Alvin & Jimmie Dale Gilmore Texicali Yep Roc\n\nTwo veteran performers, ostensibly from different corners of the roots field who, in truth, as evidenced on DOWNEY TO LUBBOCK their previous album together, are well matched. More especially also when they are working again with Alvin’s road band, The Guilty Ones. That previous album was named after their individual home towns and this time out the title reflects the two states that the pair call home. There is a strong relationship readily apparent between the two comrades that sees them as equals. Gilmore has a decade on Alvin in terms of physical age, but both are matched in their understanding of the fertile ground they are ploughing together.\n\nThe songs are a mix of covers chosen to reflect the way they now can look back on their lives with a lot of miles, and physical issues under their belts. This gives the music both a timely perspective and a present one. From Alvin’s more blues/roots background there are songs by Brownie McGee (Betty And Dupree) and Blind Willie McTell (Broke Down Engine) which sees Gilmore going from his more hillbilly to a bluesman. It has a hint of that boogie blues so prevalent in the 60s. Indeed Blind Owl is given something of an understated On The Road Again pulse as it is a tribute to one of the original, though now deceased, Canned Heat singers, Al Wilson - known by this titular moniker. It is for him and other lost players. There is a co-write Southwest Chief, a song co-written with the late singer songwriter Bill Morrissey, that offers something of an accolade for lost times and friends; it is a gentle and warm reading. There are also a couple of songs that relate to Gilmore’s own back catalogue ,like the fifty year ago penned Trying To Be Free and Borderland. The latter opens the album and it reminds us of what a pleasure it is to hear that distinctive and care-worn voice again. As the song surmises ,it is “so good to be home in the borderlands … between the dawn and the dream” - and in that space between. It is the sound of a band settling in rather than showing off, even though there are plenty of moments of prodigious playing all over. Alvin co-wrote the touching song Death Of The Last Stripper with husband and wife, and fellow Austinites, Terry Allen and Jo Harvey Allen. It is a tender and sympathetic ballad that, perhaps more than anywhere on the album, combines the two voices in a perfect alliance.\n\nWhen you put that together with a set of players as sympathetic and aligned as the rhythm section of drummer Lisa Pankratz and bassist Brad Fordham, who are joined by keyboardist Bukka Allen and Chris Miller on guitar, there is something both comfortable and rewarding about the way everything integrates into a whole that, throughout, creates a blend of age and alliance, something that goes beyond trend and easily drawn boundaries. There is a reggae-inspired feel to the sound of Roll Around that also underscores the nature of the project. Another fine song that covers the distance is Down The 285, wherein the former Blaster and former Flatlander travel the distance together on a shared road.\n\nThe extended closing song We’re Still here is full of humourous attitudinal asides that basically lets us know that no matter what you might hear “we’re still here.” That is something that everyone can and should be thankful for, as this is an album to enjoy from many angles. It’s also an acknowledgement of the wisdom of age and the fact that we all hope that the road can, indeed, go on forever - and, doubtlessly, their music will.\n\nStephen Rapid\n\nThe Henry Girls A Time To Grow Self Release\n\nThe hint is in the title - Inishowen trio The Henry Girls show that they have indeed grown, both musically and emotionally, on their latest album, recorded in their native Donegal in Attica Audio Recording studios. The McLaughlin sisters (Joleen on harp and piano, Lorna on piano, tin whistle, accordion and uke and Karen on fiddle and uke) took their maternal grandfather’s name when they started performing as a trio over 20 years ago. Their unique blend of Irish folk and traditional music with an Americana bent has brought them recognition in Ireland, and they also have a strong following throughout Europe and indeed in the US.\n\nThe choice of producer Tommy McLaughlin (who is also a member of Villagers) has really paid off, with his rock/pop credentials bringing a new dimension to their folk-orientated material. As you would expect, familial harmonies play a big part in their signature sound, evident right from the opening of the title track, A Time To Grow, which starts with the sisters singing a capella, before the harp, accordion and fiddle begin to layer behind the sweet harmonies. It’s a song inspired by the pandemic (yes another one!) but while it ponders the initial shock of the unknown, it ends on a hopeful note. Leaving Dublin is a co-write with their longtime friend from Boston, Ry Cavanaugh (Session Americana), and it is a metaphor for the perennial Irish experience of returning to one’s home after a time in exile, the lyrics ‘my pictures never looked right on your wall’ ringing true for so many Irish emigrés.\n\nApart from two songs, all the rest are written by the three sisters, and are performed with crystal vocal clarity, mostly in three part harmony. Breathe is an exquisite example of same, opening with one voice and harp, building up quietly with a four piece brass section, then swelling with layered echoey backing vocals, and subsiding again to one voice, emphasising the subject matter of gaining strength through grounding oneself in nature. One of the outstanding tracks is Not Your Fight, a co-write between Karen and Rioghnach Connolly (an Armagh native who is currently the BBC Folksinger of the Year). Written to recognise and support the victims of conflict everywhere, it is a powerful rendition of the difficult subject matter, Rioghnach’s unique vocal style and her appropriately percussive flute playing are complemented by Karen’s fiddle and Lorna’s accordion to provide a suitable musical backdrop for the violent atmosphere depicted in the lyrics. Equally affecting is Where Are We Now, a superb no-holds-barred (and brave) depiction of the emotional damage that accompanies the usually hidden burden of infertility.\n\nThe McLaughlin sisters are also adept at composing instrumentals, going by the beautiful set of tunes written to honour their departed friend and beekeeper, Paul Moore. Opening and closing with the sound of real honeybees recorded in Co Donegal, Honeybee is a gentle lullaby-like tune, led by twin whistles, and it runs into Hard Border, recalling the gay abandon of the lively bees on a sunny day, happily ignoring all land borders. Inghinidhe na hÉireann (Daughters of Ireland) is the other impressive instrumental, particularly appropriate for the centenary commemorations of the Irish Civil War etc, where the pivotal role of women is being reevaluated. As well as co-producing and arranging, Tommy McLaughlin adds guitars and synths throughout. There’s lots more to discover across the twelve tracks, and I must make particular mention of the fabulous artwork by Tim Stampton, who also hails from the Malin peninsula in Co Donegal.\n\nEilís Boland\n\nBarbaro About the Winter Storysound\n\nThis band is based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and has been creating music together since 2017. The current line-up includes Kyle Shelstad (vocals, guitar), Rachel Calvert (vocals, fiddle), and Jason Wells (vocals, bass), and their unique sound owes much to the origins of roots music, mixed with interesting influences from classical and folk leanings.\n\nShelstad founded Barbaro as a duo in 2017 with Isaac Sammis, who played on early sessions for this album, and while Calvert replaced him, Wells did not join until early 2019. The direction they are headed seems to encapsulate a lot of what similar bands like 3hattrio are exploring in their music, which is both inspiring and rewarding in equal measure.\n\nApples To Apples open proceedings and is a perfect barometer for what follows with gentle melody complimenting the hushed vocal delivery in a song of regret ‘I’m calling for you, But I’m pretty sure that you’re ignoring me.’ The next song is Gardens and an esoteric look at pain and loss, the playing reflecting the complexities of stream of consciousness musings. There is a Bluegrass feel to The Lil Sweaters and a sense of joy in the delivery, while Subtle Hints sees Rachel take lead vocal in a song that examines a relationship in the sweep and swoon of the arrangement.\n\nViolin, banjo, piano and upright bass continue to tickle the senses throughout and gorgeous melodies swathed in bluegrass intonations and jazz inflections add an intensity that is both compelling and subtle. At every turn the songs are engaging, playing on the senses, as a melody or a phrase sticks in the memory and strikes a chord with the emotion of the moment, like on Honey, for where everything soars towards a climax, only to stop suddenly. Rachel returns with her emotive vocal on One x One the gorgeous violin sweeping the melody along in a sense of reverie.\n\nSubpoena Colada is one of the longest songs and excites in the arrangement, challenging the listener to stay on the surfboard that rides the waves of jazz-fused expression, rooted by upright bass, with banjo and fiddle solos. All My Friends has Rachel in pole position once more and another interesting arrangement that builds to a satisfactory climax, with piano mixing into the violin and banjo runs.\n\nLet’s Talk About the Winter is a real highlight and shared vocals point to a sense of things left unresolved in a past relationship. With no lyric sheet to guide me, there is the risk that my interpretations are wide of the mark but the defining emotion is one of rueful reflection. The final song is Ike’s Farewell and is an instrumental that showcases the dextrous playing and inventive sense of fun in the arrangement. The album was recorded in Eau Claire, Wisconsin by Brian Joseph and Kyle Shelstad and it is a really impressive piece of work throughout. The rewards on repeated listening are many and I recommend that you seek out this music as a source of inspiration.\n\nPaul McGee\n\nPhoebe Rees Bring In The Light Strictly Country\n\nThis English folk artist has lived a very interesting life that has included community and volunteer work in Sao Paulo, Brazil and Mumbai, India. Her childhood saw Rees immerse herself in old folk traditions drawn from Celtic, English and American influences. A multi-instrumentalist who performs mainly on fiddle, viola and piano, Rees is a qualified instrumental teacher and creative music workshop leader with a wide range of teaching and project experience.\n\nOn this album she was approached by American singer-songwriter Si Kahn, founder of Grassroots Leadership, a non-profit organization which advocates for several causes, including coal worker rights, cotton mill and Alaskan fisheries conditions, prison reform, improved immigration detention policies, and violence prevention. As a social activist, now in his 81st year, Kahn wanted to have his songs interpreted for future generations and his connection with Rees was a perfect place to land. Previously, the songs of Si Kahn had been highlighted by the likes od Dick Gaughan and June Tabor to UK audiences but here we are given a fresh perspective across fourteen tracks and an hour of superbly crafted music.\n\nRees sings in a clear and expressive vocal tone and she is joined by Janos Koolen (banjo, guitar, accordion, bodhran), Lucas Beukers (acoustic bass) and Sophie Hanna (harmony vocals). Si Kahn assisted on production along with Pieter Groenveld with main duties shared between Phoebe Rees and Janos Koolen. Her song choices include the first tune that brought her to the attention of Si Kahn, a version of Mississippi Summer and a song that highlights the plight of cotton pickers. Songs of struggle and quiet resolve are visited on In Afghanistan, When the War Is Done, Peace Will Rise and Freedom Is a Constant Song. The unquenchable dignity of people shines through the words and the musicians compliment the song messages with some impressive interplay.\n\nOn a lighter note songs such as the Irish traditional jig The Didin Didin recall endless days of reverie and the tribute to Ola Belle Reed, the Appalachian folk singer, songwriter and banjo player is another heartfelt tune in High On A Mountain. Belle La Follette is honoured also with a song, as she was a women's suffrage, peace, and civil rights activist in America for many years. Wigan Pier is a song for the mining community and Molly In the Mill is similarly a tribute to the mill workers of old ‘Back in those olden times, The dust was like November snow.’ Such stark imagery of a time when heavy manufacturing and hard labour were a grim reality.\n\nUltimately, the album is a celebration of all that makes us human, the fortitude to endure and the desire to persevere. The final song People Like You sums it up in the words ‘Old fighter, you sure took it on the chin, Where’d you ever get the strength to stand, Never giving up or giving in, You know I just want to shake your hand.’ Certainly a laudable project and one that is delivered with a quiet aplomb.\n\nPaul McGee\n\nJohn Shipe Water This Dark Self Release\n\nGrappling with the big questions is something that preoccupies John Shipe on this new release. The opening song What Do I Owe? looks to try and make sense of it all while struggling with the reality of having buried both his son and his wife. The next song is also the title of the album Water This Dark and relays a near-drowning incident without spelling out what led to the dangerous scenario in the first place, the lyric suggesting some surrender to the situation ‘When in doubt you can’t figure it out, Just go with the river downstream.’\n\nUnfinished Business is a song to the sassiness of youth and to a daughter who knows her own mind well enough to not take any bullshit right from the starting pistol ‘Got her grandmother’s name, but her granddad’s look, She doesn’t do nothing by the book.’ The end of a relationship is captured in Counting Song and the pain of having to admit defeat ‘I counted the all the reasons I can’t stay, Counting all the things I could never say, Now I’m counting the miles as I drive away.’\n\nGold Into Yarn is a song of regret and looking at the years gone past in such a hurry ‘First you tell yourself, you’re just trying to do the right thing, Twenty years go by in the blink of an eye, It’s frightening when it hits you, You’re old a helluva lot longer than you’re young.’ Another song is based upon the repetition that happens in our lives and Starting Over and Over Again comes to the realisation that ‘Wherever you go, you’re stuck with you.’\n\nThe futility of war is tackled on The Darkness I’ve Been Waiting For and the cost of serving for a higher calling ‘The War is over, and I’m walking pretty good with a cane, Every now and then I feel it when it rains, And staring through the window panes. Waiting.’ The final two songs are musings on our journey and whether we really learn as the years unfold; on Lessons(Do They)? we have Shipe reflecting that ‘I learn all my lessons well, just in time, You better put out that fire, When the flames of envy climb’ and the final track By Now states that ‘All my love is written in these rhymes, Things I can't shake from long ago, What I don't talk about, I can't let go.’ Proof that the search is ongoing and the quest for peace of mind is a long road.\n\nIn total we have nine tracks that play out over a concise thirty four minutes and the musicians turn in a fine performance in bringing the arrangements to life and injecting plenty of layers in the melody. The album was produced by Tyler Fortier who also plays guitars, keyboards, percussion and sings. John Shipe provides all lead vocals and plays guitar and piano, with Mike Walker (organ, pianos), Bryan Daste (pedal steel), Lilli Worona (violin, vocals), Nate Barnes (drums), Sam Howard (bass), Phillipe Bronchtein (lap steel, organ, piano) and Erin Flood Fortier (vocals), all contributing to what is a very interesting album.\n\nPaul McGee\n\nJim Patton and Sherry Brokus Big Red Gibson Berkalin\n\nThis Astin Folk duo have been making music together since 2008 that saw the release of their first collaboration. A number of albums have followed since, including a live EP and a ten-year retrospective collection, with their last record appearing in 2022 last. This seventh full album was produced by multi-instrumentalist Ron Flynt (guitar, keyboards, bass, vocals), and he is joined by Cordy Lavery's (guitars), Steve McCarthy (drums), and BettySoo (vocals). Eric Hisaw (guitar) makes a contribution on one track and Jim Patton (vocals, guitar) with Sherry Brokus (vocals) complete the troupe. The production took place at Jumping Dog Studios in Austin and all songs were written by Patton with five co-writes included.\n\nThe eleven songs play out over thirty two minutes and sound very clean in the production. From the urge to break away and get a new start on Dead End Town, to the plight of trying to make it as a full-time musician on the title track Big Red Gibson ‘I started a new day job, Just to make it through the year, Yesterday it was a stopgap, Today it’s my career.’ A similar theme is highlighted on Devil’s Highway with the career musician striking out for the horizon ‘He put all his possessions on a Greyhound bus, Left his family in that small town dust.’\n\nBroken love is the sad outcome on My Heart’s Turned To Stone and the need to forget runs through the song. Janey Has A Locket is another relationship song, this time about unrequited love and the rock arrangement on Wild, Dumb and Unsatisfied showcases the guitar driven dynamic of the band in full flow. Promises To Keep celebrates the urge to keep thinking young as increasing age appears ‘We’ve still got a couple of miles to go and promises to keep.’ The final song is a tribute to a partner in the words of I Still Believe In You ‘Somewhere there’s a lonesome highway, That siren song begins to moan, And something calls me toward that darkness, But something stronger calls me home.’\n\nPaul McGee\n\nCarl Solomon The Whisper Self Release\n\nThis Folk artist lives in Portland and the ten songs included here are a fine example of his songwriting talent. There are three co-writes included and the atmosphere created by the studio musicians is one of gentle melody and quiet mid-tempo arrangements.\n\nThe players include Carl Solomon (acoustic guitar, vocals), David Pearlman (pedal steel), Mark Epstein basses), Michael Dorrien (guitars), Peter Wassner (piano, organ, Wurlitzer, accordion), Merel Bregante (drums, percussion, Lori Beth Brooke (accordion) and Cody Braun (fiddle). Backing vocals are provided by a combination of Sarah Pierce, Alex Winters, Micheal Henchman and Merel Bregante.\n\nThe title song is a tribute to Jenny Joyce, his wife, and Solomon sings sweetly of his enduring love for the bond shared. The pedal steel on Singin’ With the Ghost is nicely atmospheric in a tale of a car crash on the road home one night. Lincoln Continental has another nice melody with accordion playing alongside pedal steel and a tale of young love. Window Shopping For Jesus is a song that suggests ‘paradise is one day out of reach’ and that ‘another grievous angel cries out for peace.’\n\nSoldier’s Psalm is a highlight and a song that reflects on the price paid by serving soldiers in the US army and recognition given to their regiments. Solomon is very active in Soldiers Songs & Voices, a body that provides free guitar and songwriting lessons to Armed Forces veterans in the Portland Metro area. While not counsellors, there is a healing value to be found in the act of self-expression through creative workshops. These are songs of genuine sentiment and much to enjoy in the variety.\n\nPaul McGee\n\nBirdfeeder Woodstock Soul Selects\n\nA trio made up of Chris Harford (guitar, bass), Mark Mulcahy (drums, vocals) and Kevin Salem (guitar) is something to savour and the eight songs on this short record capture the friendship forged by these artists over an extended period of years. In just twenty five minutes of music they produce a unique sound that frames their combined sense of creativity.\n\nBig Chairs and Candy opens up the collaboration with strummed guitars and an intimate vocal that captures a local meeting house scenario where vested interests get resolved. The next track is She Stood Up At the PTA and an incident where a poem delivered results in a dilemma that concerns family and domestic matters. Mulcahy is well known for his passion-fuelled vocal dating back to his Miracle Legion days and here he shows that none of that quiet power has been lost.\n\nSo It’s A Bomb follows and the uncredited keyboard sound backs the rhythm and a sense of alienation in the song arrangement. A threat of outside influences being brought to bear perhaps? We are then introduced to My Cousin and a tale of relatives not seeing eye to eye as family life unfolds. The song So Triangular has a quiet tempo and lyrics that state ‘Go back to Pakistan and tell your mother it’s all over.’ Hints of prearranged marriage?\n\nStandout song Born This Way and Your Expectations is a song that tackles the question of gay disposition and coming out – with certain assumptions made that bring pressure and upset. A Fairy Tale is a relationship song that reflects upon the support given by a loved one while the final track Super Diamondaire is a demo dating back to the 1990s when the trio were first exploring song structure together. It has some heavy, sporadic drum sounds, angular electric guitar and fun vocal experimentation. All in all, an intriguing collaboration that hopefully will lead on to future recording together.\n\nPaul McGee\n\nWest Of Eden Whitechapel Self Release\n\nContemporary Folk group West Of Eden is based in Gothenburg, Sweden and formed in 1995 when Jenny and Martin Schaub enlisted local musicians to bring their Celtic-based music to life. Now on album number thirteen the current line-up comprises Jenny Schaub (lead and backing vocals, accordion, tin whistle), Martin Schaub (lead and backing vocals, acoustic guitars, tenor guitar, dobro, mandolin, bouzouki, cittern, keyboard, Hammond organ, Rhodes, celesta, piano, pump organ, accordion, glockenspiel), Ola Karlevo (drums and percussion, cajón, bodhrán, backing vocals (since the beginning), Lars Broman(fiddle, viola, backing vocals (since 2009), Martin Deubler Holmlund (double bass, bass guitar, backing vocals (since 2013), and Henning Sernhede: (electric, acoustic guitars, mandolin (since 2016).\n\nThis is a concept album that contains twelve tracks and the forty five minutes tells the tale of Jack the Ripper and his victims in the London area of Whitechapel in the 1880s. The women that feature in the songs are portrayed as flesh and blood individuals who lived and dreamed of a better future under the most challenging of circumstances. Kicking off with Whitechapel Blues the scene is set with a tale of poor living conditions and people out to take what they can ‘Whitechapel alleys and Whitechapel streets, Where the outcasts and the penniless meet.’ The song has a great band feel in the playing and the vocal is very reminiscent of Ian Anderson in his early Jethro Tull days. The Ten Bells is a song about a local hostelry where the locals drink their cares away and the prostitutes stroll the street looking for potential punters.\n\nRead All About It is a song that recounts the paper coverage of the Ripper murders and sale of terrible news ‘ We have made a little career, Writing stories of terror and tears, We are profiting upon your anguish and fears.’ The local street trader in Harry the Hawker brings rumours of murder and sells turnips and cherries as he promotes his tales. A rural girl of innocence moves to the big city in The Register Of Shame and ends up losing her dreams to the grim reality of survival on the streets. A standout song is Mudlarking which is a co-vocal shared by Jenny and Martin Schaub that highlights the practice of scavenging along the banks of the river Thames looking for items of value. The ensemble playing on this arrangement is superbly delivered by the band.\n\nThe instrumental tune Dark Annie is another high point with a melody that is close to an Irish jig in the delivery with flute, fiddle and tin whistle playing in symmetry above the guitar accompaniment and lilting percussio"
