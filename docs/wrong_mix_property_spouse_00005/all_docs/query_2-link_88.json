Until the 1400s, Japan had no contact with the West due to its geographic location. After a brief and limited exposure to Western literature, Japan closed its doors to the West and remained isolated from approximately 1600 until 1868. During the Meiji Era (1868-1912) Japan was flooded with examples of all the phases of Western literature it had missed, and Japanese writers soon responded to the Western developments. This course will deal with that response, from Tsubouchi Shyoyo's criticism of modern Japanese novels and their lack of appreciation for Realism, to the development of the Japanese I-novel. Due to Japan's literary response to the West, it can also be argued that the Meiji Era marked the end of Japanese literature as a unique entity, and this course will explore this issue as well.\n\nSession Class # Section Instructor Mode Days Time Campus Status Notes Session 26544530Mary DiazOnline AsynchronousFlexible (Online)TBAWest (Main Campus)Open\n\nAAS 371: Ancient China\n\nUndergraduate 3 credits\n\nPrerequisites: U3 or U4 standing; one D.E.C.

In this course, we will examine the interrelationships between people, places and environment and their role in history, using events from global history to inform our analysis. This examination will involve two interrelated goals. The first, a more conventional approach to geography, will center on how geography has influenced human history as well as how humans have impacted the Earth¿s ecosystems, especially since industrialization. This study will enhance our knowledge of the current physical and political configuration of the earth. Our second goal will be to consider new approaches to conceiving space and depicting the Earth¿s surface and populations. As part of this more conceptual project, we will study the history of mapping and examine new modes of representing the Earth based on twenty-first century global needs.\n\nSession Class # Section Instructor Mode Days Time Campus Status Notes Session 164981S30TBAOnline Sync/Async CombinedFlexible (Online)TBAWest (Main Campus)OpenSession 164981S30Richard TomczakOnline Sync/Async CombinedThursday06:00-08:50PMWest (Main Campus)Open\n\nCHE 131: General Chemistry IB\n\nUndergraduate 4 credits\n\nPrerequisite: Online Chemistry Placement and Preparation (OCPP) Process.
