        "text": "Dollar Dominance and the Export Channel of Monetary Policy Transmission\n\nJoint with Michael McLeay.Abstract:An emerging academic and policy view contends that a monetary-policy induced depreciation by a (non-US) country invoicing in dollars cannot stabilise activity, as the classical expenditure-switching channel is muted. This weakens the exchange-rate channel of monetary policy transmission. The key premises underlying this view are that i) exporters have monopoly power and ii) their prices are sticky in US dollars. However, goods priced in dollars are typically traded in highly competitive global markets and tend to have more flexible prices; this is particularly the case for exporters in emerging or developing countries. We propose a new open economy model with more realistic assumptions and show that loosening monetary policy boosts exports and activity; the limit to any expansion is not demand, but supply capacity. We furthermore show that low pass-through is not informative about the degree of nominal stickiness: limited price responses are an equilibrium result in our model, rather than an assumption. We present new evidence that both exports and activity respond strongly to exchange-rate changes driven by monetary policy.\n\nHelicopter Money: What is it and what does it do?\n\nJoint with Ricardo Reis. forthcoming Annual Review of Economics 2022.Abstract:We review the different meanings of helicopter money both in the literature and in the public debate around it, and clarify the conditions under which helicopter money can have an impact on real activity. To do so, we set out a simple model that encapsulates a number of potential channels of policy transmission. The model provides a taxonomy of possibilities for helicopter money to affect the economy, as well as a benchmark set of conditions under which it is neutral. We use the model to analyse and discuss the impact that helicopter drops might have in response to a number of economic shocks, including a financial crisis, a fiscal crisis, and a pandemic.\n\nThe Rise in Agribusinesses and its Distributional Consequences\n\nJoint with Swati Dhingra Abstract: Crops are often modelled as homogenous products that are exchanged in perfectly competitive markets. While this may be true of world commodity markets, smallholder farmers face high trade barriers in selling their crops at home and abroad. Smallholder farmers can overcome these barriers by selling to agribusinesses with better intermediation technologies. This has provided a rationale for policies encouraging agribusinesses. However, the rise of agribusinesses also skews the distribution of buyers of farm produce towards larger firms with greater buyer power. This paper documents the reliance of farmers on intermediaries and shows that farmers selling to agribusinesses differ systematically from others. We incorporate these stylised facts into a flexible theoretical framework to study the aggregate and distributional consequences of the rise of agribusinesses. Taking the theory to data, we quantify behind-the-border barriers to trade embedded in a national policy to encourage agribusiness participation. We combine this with microdata on household-crop incomes and find that the policy led to a reduction in incomes of small farmers. Losses were concentrated among farmers who sold to agribusinesses and in villages with a comparative advantage in policy-affected crops. On average, their incomes fell by 6 per cent with no offsetting gains in non-farm channels of income. Profit margins of agribusinesses specialised in policy-affected crops rose, in line with the theoretical channel. The findings contribute to the academic and policy debate on the impact of integration and market power on the size and distribution of the welfare gains from trade.\n\nUnequal Migration\n\nJoint with Rebecca Freeman, John Lewis, JMC Santos Silva and Stefan SzymanskiAbstract:We study the role of skills and their interaction with barriers to migration in the decision to move. These interactions are key to determine the skill composition of the pool of immigrants in different countries. To do so, we use a novel database that documents international and intra-national moves for subjects with different skill levels. The database is unique in the migration literature in its degree of granularity, which allows us to assess the role of skills\\ in amplifying or mitigating existing barriers. Consistent with previous studies, we find that the various barriers to migration, including measures of distance, tend to hamper mobility. But we identify and quantify a novel interaction between those barriers and the level of skills, such that the impact of barriers on migration decreases as the level of skill increases. At highter skill levels, %the upper end of skills, barriers appear to pose little obstacle to the migration of superstars.\n\nThe Balance of Power: monopsony, unions, and wages in the United Kingdom\n\nJoint with Will Abel and Greg Thwaites Abstract: We document the evolution of labour market concentration in the UK private sector labour market from 1998-2018, how labour unions have counterbalanced this power, and the net effect on wages. Using linked employee- rm micro-data, we find that: (1) Measures of labour market concentration have not exhibited a time trend over the time period examined. (2) There is substantial cross-sectional variation in concentration at the industry level. (3) Higher levels of labour market concentration are associated with lower pay amongst workers not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. (4) For workers covered by a collective bargaining agreement, the association between labour market concentration and pay disappears. (5) The effects of concentration and union coverage are generally larger for lower-paid workers, and workers in tradable industries. (6) Collective bargaining agreements weaken the impact of workers' outside options in other labour markets, which nonetheless remain strong."
