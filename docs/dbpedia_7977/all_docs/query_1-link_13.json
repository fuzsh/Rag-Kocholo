In addition, the term also applies to all Kinniku Banzuke events when competitors won an event, VIKING, KASSO and other SASUKE/Ninja Warrior spin-offs, such as Ninja Warrior Israel Junior.\n\nTo date, Kanzenseiha has only been achieved thirty-seven times by thirty-one people across all original and international versions. If only counting the originating Japanese competitions (SASUKE and KUNOICHI), this feat has only been achieved eleven times by seven people.\n\nThe grand prize for achieving Kanzenseiha varies depending on the national or international SASUKE/Ninja Warrior formats:\n\nSASUKE grants the prize money of JP¥2,000,000.\n\nOn SASUKE 24, the prize was a Nissan Fuga car.\n\nKUNOICHI grants the prize money of JP¥2,000,000.\n\nAmerican Ninja Warrior grants the prize money of US$1,000,000, beginning on American Ninja Warrior 7.\n\nOn American Ninja Warrior 2, the prize money was US$250,000.\n\nOn American Ninja Warrior 3, the prize was a US$500,000 K-Swiss endorsement deal.\n\nFrom American Ninja Warrior 4 to American Ninja Warrior 6, the prize money was US$500,000.\n\nSASUKE Vietnam grants the prize money of ₫800,000,000, beginning on SASUKE Vietnam 2.\n\nOn SASUKE Vietnam 1, the prize was a Honda CR-V.\n\nSASUKE Ninja Warrior Indonesia grants the prize money of Rp.500,000,000.\n\nNinja Israel grants the cash prize of ₪250,000 and an SUV.\n\nAustralian Ninja Warrior grants the cash prize of AU$200,000 beginning on Australian Ninja Warrior 2, and from Australian Ninja Warrior 5 onwards.\n\nOn Australian Ninja Warrior 1, the cash prize was AU$100,000. Then, if no competitor could achieve total victory, the prize money will be rolled over to the next season and kept rolling over until someone achieved total victory, resulting in that competitor receiving the rolled-over cash prize and the cash prize would be reset back to AU$100,000 on the next season after that.\n\nThe highest cash prize ever awarded was AU$400,000 on Australian Ninja Warrior 4. The cash prize has since stopped rolling over after total victory was achieved on that season, and was instead reset back to AU$200,000.\n\nNinja Warrior France grants the prize money of 60,000 €, beginning on Ninja Warrior France 8.\n\nOn Ninja Warrior France, the prize was 100,000 € and a car.\n\nFrom Ninja Warrior France 2 to Ninja Warrior France 7, the prize money was 100,000 €.\n\nNinja Warrior Italia grants the prize of a trip for two to Las Vegas to attend the taping of the National Finals of American Ninja Warrior 7.\n\nNinja Warrior NL grants the prize money of 25,000 €.\n\nNinja Warrior Germany grants the cash prize of 300,000 €, beginning on Ninja Warrior Germany 3.\n\nOriginally, on Ninja Warrior Germany 1, the cash prize was 100,000 € and 100,000 € was added each season when no winner is achieved, the prize money has since stopped rolling over.\n\nNinja Warrior Austria grants the prize money of 88,888 €, beginning on Ninja Warrior Austria 3.\n\nFrom Ninja Warrior Austria to Ninja Warrior Austria 2, the prize money was 44,444 €.\n\nNinja Warrior Hungary grants the prize money of 20,000,000 Ft.\n\nNinja Warrior Romania grants the prize money of 100,000 €, despite the fact that Romania uses the leu as their national currency.\n\nNinja Warrior Poland grants the cash prize of 200,000 zł‎, beginning on Ninja Warrior Poland 8.\n\nFrom Ninja Warrior Poland to Ninja Warrior Poland 7, the prize money was 150,000 zł‎.\n\nNinja Warrior Russia grants the cash prize of 5,000,000 ₽.\n\nCoincidentally, all of these following shows achieved their first kanzenseiha/total victory in their fourth tournament:\n\nThe first kanzenseiha in SASUKE was achieved in SASUKE 4.\n\nThe first kanzenseiha in KUNOICHI was achieved in KUNOICHI 4.\n\nThe first total victory on American Ninja Warrior was achieved on American Ninja Warrior 7, the fourth season since the national finals/Mount Midoriyama course was held on the U.S. soil (specifically in Las Vegas), starting on American Ninja Warrior 4.\n\nThe first total victory on Ninja Warrior France was achieved on Ninja Warrior France 4.\n\nThe first total victory on Australian Ninja Warrior was achieved on Australian Ninja Warrior 4.\n\nThe first total victory on Ninja Israel was achieved on Ninja Warrior Israel 4.\n\nSuccessful Kanzenseiha[]\n\nSASUKE[]\n\nAkiyama Kazuhiko, SASUKE 4. Akiyama had competed twice earlier, but ultimately timed out on the Second Stage. He was finally able to clear the Second Stage, but found trouble in the Third Stage. Because five people had cleared the Third Stage in the previous tournament, the stage was completely redesigned, the Pipe Slider being changed so that the competitor would have to swing to the platform rather than just touch down. Akiyama almost slipped off of the platform, but hung on using his arms and was able to pull himself up to the goal mat. The Final Stage at the time was a 15-metre Tsuna Nobori in 30 seconds, which Akiyama finished in a mere 24 seconds, earning the first ever Kanzenseiha.\n\nNagano Makoto, SASUKE 17. Nagano had made it to the Final Stage three times earlier in SASUKE 11, 12, and 13. In SASUKE 12, he was just 0.11 (1/9) seconds away from achieving kanzenseiha. However, he blazed through the first three stages and cleared the Final Stage, a 12.5-metre Spider Climb and a 10-metre Tsuna Nobori with 2.56 seconds left on the clock.\n\nUrushihara Yuuji, SASUKE 24. After Nagano Makoto's victory, the course was completely redesigned, retaining only four old obstacles. This new era (the Shin-SASUKE) was designed to eliminate all 100 competitors in the First Stage. However, as time progressed, more and more competitors cleared the First Stage. In his first four tournaments, Urushihara cleared the First Stage three times and the Third Stage twice. After barely failing the G-Rope in SASUKE 22, Urushihara rigorously trained his Rope Climbing skills. When he had 21 seconds to climb the 10-metre G-Rope, his training paid off, as he cleared it with 3.57 seconds to spare.\n\nUrushihara Yuuji, SASUKE 27. After Urushihara's first victory, the First and Second Stages underwent minor changes, but the Third Stage was entirely redesigned. For the first two tournaments, all eight competitors who attempted the Ultimate Cliffhanger were defeated. In SASUKE 27, however, the Third Stage was modified so as to make the first half easier but the second half more difficult. This was proven to be an advantage for Urushihara, who became the third competitor to defeat the Ultimate Cliffhanger and defeated the entire Third Stage course. The Final Stage was a 20-metre Tsuna Nobori in 40 seconds. However, unlike the original Final Stage, competitors were allowed to start from a standing position. After fellow UNCLI member Matachi Ryo failed, Urushihara put his Rope Climbing skills to good use, clearing the new Final Stage with a record 6.71 seconds to spare, earning his second Kanzenseiha.\n\nMorimoto Yūsuke, SASUKE 31. After nearly reaching the Final Stage in SASUKE 29, Morimoto defeated his nemesis, the Pipe Slider, to reach the Final Stage. He was the only person to clear the Third Stage that day. In the Final Stage, Morimoto kept a steady pace and finished with 2.59 seconds left on the clock to achieve SASUKE's fifth Kanzenseiha and becoming the youngest to do so at the age of 23.\n\nMorimoto Yūsuke, SASUKE 38. Without a doubt, Morimoto has trained even harder after the close Kanzenseiha in SASUKE 36. He came back stronger in SASUKE 38, letting go what happened in the previous tournament. He blazed through the Spider Climb and completed the Salmon Ladder Jūgo Dan with struggles. However, his skills during the Tsuna Nobori proved to be a great help and he managed to complete the Final Stage with 2.52 seconds on the clock to achieve SASUKE's sixth Kanzenseiha, becoming the second person after Urushihara Yuuji to achieve it twice. In addition, he is the first person to achieve Kanzenseiha wearing #100.\n\nKUNOICHI[]\n\nMiyake Ayako, KUNOICHI 4. This was Miyake's first tournament, after her dance group G-Rockets joined the Muscle Musical squad. Wearing #58, she shocked everyone by clearing the First Stage with 28.86 seconds to spare. Upon clearing the Second and Third Stages, she was able to achieve KUNOICHI's first Kanzenseiha after clearing the Final Stage with 4.11 seconds to spare. Notably, this was the first KUNOICHI tournament shown on G4.\n\nMiyake Ayako, KUNOICHI 5. Miyake was given #100 in honors of her Kanzenseiha in the previous tournament. She showed that it was no fluke by once again dominating the virtually unchanged course a second time, this time clearing with 7.7 seconds left.\n\nMiyake Ayako, KUNOICHI 6. KUNOICHI 6 was noteworthy in two ways - it was redesigned after Miyake's two Kanzenseihas and also it had an \"International\" theme, as women from several different countries including Japan, USA, Brazil, and Indonesia competed. Miyake and Tanaka Maho reached the Final Stage and although Tanaka was unable to reach Tenkubou in time, Miyake cleared for an unheard of third time with only 0.66 seconds to spare. She celebrated by waving a Japanese flag atop the tower (further going with the \"International\" theme). However, Miyake shockingly failed at the final obstacle of the Second Stage in the next tournament and it is unsure if she will ever compete again.\n\nKomiya Rie, KUNOICHI 8. Under the new KUNOICHI system, three competitors qualified for the redesigned Final Stage. Komiya had an experience with the Final Stage during KUNOICHI 5 and was inches close towards the goal. She had a good performance in the First Stage by being the only person to clear on her group, with an average performance with her balancing skills on the Second Stage. During the Third Stage, she shows little to no problems by easily jumping both given heights. After two more tournaments failing to make it back, she managed to have done so and was the first to attempt the Final Stage. Rie climbed the Tetsu Bashi with a very quick pace but slowed down on the Climb Board, losing time during the transition towards the second board. Nevertheless, she had enough time to climb atop and cleared with 3.7 seconds remaining.\n\nKadoi Satomi, KUNOICHI 8. Kadoi was the third to attempt the redesigned Final Stage, and cleared it with a blistering 21.4 seconds remaining, the fastest time in KUNOICHI history.\n\nAmerican Ninja Warrior[]\n\nGeoff Britten, American Ninja Warrior 7. First American to complete Stage Four with 0.35 seconds left, taking only two American Ninja Warrior seasons to do so. This earned him the title of the first \"American Ninja Warrior\".\n\nIsaac Caldiero, American Ninja Warrior 7. Second American to complete Stage Four with 3.86 seconds left, taking only three American Ninja Warrior seasons to do so. Since he had a faster time on Stage Four than Geoff Britten, he was declared the winner of the competition and won the US$1,000,000 cash prize, the fastest time in ANW history.\n\nDrew Drechsel, American Ninja Warrior 11. Third American to complete Stage Four with 2.54 seconds remaining and the fourth American overall to achieve kanzenseiha/total victory. He was up against Daniel Gil for the US$1,000,000 cash prize, but Gil failed to complete Stage Four in time, and thus Drew was declared the second winner and the third \"American Ninja Warrior\". This is the first instance that a single competitor completed Stage Four.\n\nDaniel Gil, American Ninja Warrior 15. Fourth American to complete Stage Four with 2.01 seconds left and the first competitor to achieve total victory with multiple attempts, having timed out on his previous attempt on American Ninja Warrior 11.\n\nVance Walker, American Ninja Warrior 15. Fifth American to complete Stage Four with 3.25 seconds left. Due to his faster time on Stage Four than Daniel Gil, he was declared the third winner of the competition and earned the million dollar cash prize.\n\nSASUKE Vietnam[]\n\nDavid Campbell, SASUKE Vietnam 2. First competitor to complete SASUKE Vietnam's Final Stage. Third American to achieve kanzenseiha/total victory. Completed the Final Stage with 0.73 seconds left. Campbell would also become the first competitor to achieve total victory away from his home country as he currently lives in the United States, also became one of the few people to achieve Total Victory on his first appearance in any international SASUKE/Ninja Warrior formats.\n\nNguyễn Phước Huynh, SASUKE Vietnam 2. Nguyễn Phước Huynh has competed on SASUKE Vietnam 1 before, but failed at the Cliffhanger in Stage 3. However, on the next season, he was able to beat the Cliffhanger, and later finished Stage 3 and advanced to the Final Stage. Then, he became the second competitor to complete SASUKE Vietnam's Final Stage with 0.64 seconds left.\n\nLê Văn Thực, SASUKE Vietnam 2. Lê Văn Thực has competed on SASUKE Vietnam 1 before, but failed the dismount of the Pipe Slider in Stage 3. However, on the next season, he was able to beat the Pipe Slider and advanced to the Final Stage. Then, he became the third competitor to complete SASUKE Vietnam's Final Stage, and by completing the Final Stage in the fastest time (with 6.44 seconds left), he was declared as the champion of the tournament and won the ₫800,000,000 cash prize. After his, Campbell and Huynh's total victories, this marks the first ever occurrence of triple winners in a season on an international format along with Australian Ninja Warrior 4. As a side note, SASUKE Vietnam was the international format that has the shortest wait for a Total Victory.\n\nNinja Warrior UK[]\n\nTim Champion, Ninja Warrior UK 5. After a two-season hiatus since his last appearance on Ninja Warrior UK 2, Tim returned to compete on Ninja Warrior UK 5. On his return, Tim became the first ever competitor to complete the Flying Bar (the final obstacle of Stage 3) and advance to Stage 4 (Mount Midoriyama). Later, he became the first competitor to complete Stage 4 with 1 second left, achieving the first ever total victory in Ninja Warrior UK history and earning him the title of the first \"Ninja Warrior UK\".\n\nNinja Warrior France[]\n\nJean Tezenas du Montcel, Ninja Warrior France 4. Being the Last Man Standing on the previous season, Jean returned to compete on Ninja Warrior France 4. From there, he managed to beat the first two stages with ease and made it all the way to Final Stage (called as Tour des Héros). He blazed through the stage within 40 seconds and completed it with 8 seconds left (32.45 seconds or 7.55 seconds left via external information), becoming the first competitor to achieve total victory in Ninja Warrior France history, winning the 100,000 € grand prize by completing the stage with the fastest time, thus considered as the sole winner.\n\nNicolas Cerquant, Ninja Warrior France 4. Second competitor to achieve total victory with 1 second left (39.15 seconds or 0.85 seconds left via external information). As a result, it is the first time in Ninja Warrior France history to have a double winner and the first European format to have done so.\n\nIliann Cherif, Ninja Warrior France 6. Being considered as one of the students of Jean Tezenas du Montcel, he competed on Ninja Warrior France 6 in a stellar performance. Having to not only clear the Mega Wall in qualifying but also one of the fastest times during Stage One, he became one of the four competitors to attempt the Final Stage in that tournament. In this tournament, he had to beat the time set by Jean's previous total victory by climbing 23 meters rope in just 32 seconds. Being the first to attempt out of the four, he climbed the rope at a blistering pace and managed to clear the stage with 6 seconds remaining (26.87 seconds or 5.58 seconds left via external information), becoming the third competitor to achieve total victory. He became one of the few people to achieve Total Victory on his first appearance.\n\nClément Gravier, Ninja Warrior France 6. Due to the fact that Iliann managed to clear the stage with 6 seconds remaining (26.87 seconds or 5.58 seconds left via external information), this became the current time limit in which the rest of the finalist must clear to achieve total victory. With even Jean Tezenas du Montcel timing out on the stage with the new time limit, Gravier had to make a faster pace to clear it. Being the third out of the four finalists to attempt, he had a solid pace up the rope and would manage to press the buzzer with one second remaining (25.16 seconds or 7.29 seconds left via external information, compared to Iliann it would be 1.71 seconds left), becoming the fourth competitor to achieve total victory. With Michel Lajic timing out on the stage as well, he was considered as the sole winner, winning the 100,000 € grand prize by completing the stage with the fastest time. With his achievement, this is the second time in Ninja Warrior France history to have a double winner.\n\nClément Gravier, Ninja Warrior France 8. Just as in the two previous seasons of Ninja Warrior France, Clément Gravier once again produced a stellar performance, reaching the Final Stage (Tours des Héros) the third consecutive season in a row. This time, he was the second out of the three who managed to reach the Final Stage in said season (along with Jean Tezenas du Montcel and Matthias Noirel), and got another chance to complete the Final Stage within the time limit set by himself in Ninja Warrior France 6. After having seen his own teacher failing to complete the Final Stage, Clément Gravier started his Final Stage attempt and would display a blistering pace throughout the first half of the Rope Climb with only a slight stumble. This time, however, Gravier would be undeterred by the struggles during the second half and would barely press the button with an impressive time of 24.74 seconds (or 00.42 seconds left), not only becoming the first competitor to achieve Total Victory twice in Ninja Warrior France, but also becoming the fifth competitor in the history of International SASUKE/Ninja Warrior formats to achieve Total Victory twice in their career (after Miyake Ayako, Urushihara Yuuji, Morimoto Yūsuke and Yogev Malka).\n\nMatthias Noirel, Ninja Warrior France 8. His speed in the Final Stage (Tours des Héros) gave him a faster time (1.42 seconds left), enough to beat Clément Gravier's time listed above, crowning him as the winner of that season and with 60,000 € to his name. Though a controversy arose with his attempt at the Final Stage.\n\nAustralian Ninja Warrior[]\n\nZak Stolz, Australian Ninja Warrior 4. With Zak completing the first three stages, he attempted Stage Four (Mt. Midoriyama) first and managed to be the First Australian to complete Stage Four (Mt. Midoriyama) with 0.20 seconds left, taking only two Australian Ninja Warrior season appearances to do so.\n\nCharlie Robbins, Australian Ninja Warrior 4. Being the Last Man Standing on the previous season, Charlie returned to compete on Australian Ninja Warrior 4. He managed to beat the first three stages with ease, albeit struggled along the way, and made it all the way to Stage Four (Mt. Midoriyama). He later became the second Australian to complete Stage Four (Mt. Midoriyama) with 3.44 seconds left, taking only two Australian Ninja Warrior season appearances to do so (just like Zak Stolz).\n\nBen Polson, Australian Ninja Warrior 4. Ben Polson's run on that season's competition was not as smooth as both Zak Stolz and Charlie Robbins, as he had an early fall on the fifth obstacle (the Sling Shot) during the semifinals. Despite that, he was still able to hang on and advance to the grand final. Then, he managed to advance to Stage Three for the first time in his Australian Ninja Warrior appearance, and later became the first ever competitor in Australian Ninja Warrior history to complete Stage Three and advance to Stage Four (Mt. Midoriyama), with a clutch attempt on the Flying Bar with the right side of the bar inches outside of the cradle. In Stage Four (Mt. Midoriyama), he became the third Australian to complete it with 4.44 seconds left. Since he was able to complete Stage Four (Mt. Midoriyama) faster than both Zak Stolz and Charlie Robbins, he was then declared as the first ever \"Australian Ninja Warrior\" and won the AU$400,000 cash prize. With this feat, that marks the second occurrence of triple winners in a season on an international format since SASUKE Vietnam 2.\n\nNinja Warrior Germany[]\n\nMoritz Hans, Ninja Warrior Germany 6. Being the first to attempt the Final Stage, Hans must complete the Rope Climb in less than 25 seconds. Hans completed the Rope Climb with 1.08 seconds remaining on the clock, thus becoming the first competitor to achieve total victory on Ninja Warrior Germany. Despite having a slower time than the eventual winner Rene Casselly, Hanz would win a cash prize of 25,000€.\n\nRene Casselly, Ninja Warrior Germany 6. Casselly, years after his Final Stage attempt on SASUKE 37 would finally have his own chance to complete the Final Stage at Ninja Warrior Germany. From there, he would complete the stage with 2.99 seconds remaining on the clock, thus making him the second competitor to achieve total victory on Ninja Warrior Germany and the winner of the competition and the 300,000€ cash prize. Likewise, from Ninja Warrior France, this is the first time in Ninja Warrior Germany history to have a double winner and the second European format to have done so.\n\nNinja Israel[]\n\nYuval Shemla, Ninja Warrior Israel 4. Three seasons after narrowly completing the Final Stage, would once again have his own chance to take on the course. During the tournament, Shemla considers this competition as his last appearance on the show due to him focusing on rock climbing. Being the second to attempt the Final Stage, Shemla must complete the 23.5-meter Rope Climb within 30 seconds. From there, Shemla managed to complete the stage with 4 seconds remaining on the clock, thus becoming the first competitor to achieve total victory on Ninja Israel. Since he completed the Final Stage faster than Malka, he was declared as the champion of the tournament and won the ₪250,000 cash prize and a SUV.\n\nYogev Malka, Ninja Warrior Israel 4. Having to train for the competition for two years, Malka would make his second appearance in Ninja Warrior Israel 4 where he made his presence felt in this competition. Being the third to attempt the Final Stage, he managed to clear the stage with one second remaining, becoming the second competitor in Ninja Warrior Israel to achieve total victory. As a result, it is the first time in Ninja Israel history to have a double winner and the first Middle Eastern format to have done so.\n\nShneor Sameach, Ninja Warrior Israel 5. With the Final Stage of this season being the same despite happening after a total victory, two competitors managed to reach the stage. Sameach would complete the stage with one second remaining, becoming the third competitor in Ninja Warrior Israel and the youngest in any International Ninja format to achieve total victory. He also became one of the few people to achieve Total Victory on his first appearance.\n\nYogev Malka, Ninja Warrior Israel 5. Having to appear once again on the Final Stage after missing out on becoming the champion of the previous season and once again becoming the second competitor to run, Malka made sure to be quicker on the rope this time compared to Sameach. Malka would clear the stage with eight seconds remaining, earning his second total victory. He would also become the second overall competitor to achieve total victory in two consecutive tournaments, a feat only made by Miyake Ayako in KUNOICHI. As a result, it is the second time in Ninja Israel history to have a double winner and the first international version to have a double winner for two consecutive seasons. Since he completed the Final Stage faster than Sameach, he was declared as the champion of the tournament and won the ₪250,000 cash prize and a SUV.\n\nNinja Warrior Austria[]\n\nJoel Mattli, Ninja Warrior Austria 3. Being known to compete in other competitions such as Ninja Warrior Switzerland and Ninja Warrior Germany, Mattli would also compete in Austria for Ninja Warrior Austria 3. From there, he managed to become the only competitor to reach the Final Stage in that season. In the stage, he completed the rope climb with one second remaining, becoming the first competitor in Ninja Warrior Austria to achieve total victory. Mattli would also become the second competitor to achieve total victory away from his home country as he currently lives in Sweden.\n\nNinja Warrior Poland[]\n\nJan Tatarowicz, Ninja Warrior Poland 9. Two seasons after the agonizing close attempt on the Final Stage, he would once again have his own chance to take on the stage. Being the last to attempt the Final Stage, Tatarowicz must complete the 21-meter Rope Climb within 25 seconds. He seemingly pressed the button at the top of the Final Stage tower within the 25-second time limit but the red failure signal was shown, signifying a timed out. During another replay check however, it was shown that Jan had actually pressed the button at 0.1 seconds left, thus becoming the first person to achieve Total Victory in the history of Ninja Warrior Poland after eight seasons. As a side note, this is the international format that has the longest wait for a Total Victory.\n\nClose Encounters[]\n\nSASUKE[]\n\nTanaka Hikaru, SASUKE 2. In his rookie effort Tanaka managed to beat the first three stages with little trouble, but in the Final Stage he timed out a few feet away from Kanzenseiha.\n\nYamamoto Shingo, SASUKE 3. In Yamamoto's third appearance he managed to beat the Pipe Slider that took him down last time and he managed to climb Tsuna Nobori pretty fast, but he ran out of time about two meters away from the button.\n\nYamada Katsumi, SASUKE 3. In Yamada's only appearance in the Final Stage, he came up just short of the buzzer. Yamada only used his arms for the first five meters but clearly had a faster pace when instituting his legs. He was one of five to take on the Final Stage that day and by far was the closest. With that performance, he earned the nickname as \"Mr. SASUKE\".\n\nKane Kosugi, SASUKE 8. Kane joined Jordan Jovtchev in the Final Stage. An extreme downpour had hit Midoriyama that day and it was still raining during the Final Stage. Kane struggled on the slippery Spider Climb but made up ground on the rope, but still fell short. Many believe that had the weather stayed dry, Kane would have achieved Kanzenseiha.\n\nShiratori Bunpei, SASUKE 12. Shiratori cleared the Spider Climb with an excellent pace but struggled on the early part of the rope. When he began using his legs to assist him, he flew up the rope. Although he timed out, he might have achieved Kanzenseiha had he started using his legs sooner.\n\nNagano Makoto, SASUKE 12. Nagano had a blistering pace while climbing the Final Stage and despite a few stumbles on the Spider Climb, was eye-level as time was running out. However, the rope swung away from the button. Nagano reached out to press it, but he was 0.11 (1/9) seconds late of hitting the button. The course was moderately redesigned after this and the SASUKE Trials were introduced as a result.\n\nNagano Makoto, SASUKE 13. On Nagano's third try at the Final Stage, he ran out of time once more. Upon timing out, Nagano reached for the button. He fell a few inches short and dropped to the bottom.\n\nUrushihara Yuuji, SASUKE 22. Urushihara had only competed once before, failing the First Stage's Flying Chute. However, he was able to conquer Shin-SASUKE's Third Stage for the first time ever and as such was the first to take on the third incarnation of the Final Stage. He reached the G-Rope with 28 seconds to spare but came just inches short of the buzzer.\n\nNagano Makoto, SASUKE 23. Nagano was able to scale the entire tower and was eye level with the button as time expired. However, after Urushihara's close call in the previous tournament, the time limit was reduced from 45 seconds to 40 seconds. If the time limit had stayed at 45 seconds, Nagano would have achieved Kanzenseiha, as he was 0.21 seconds short of the button when time ran out.\n\nHashimoto Kōji, SASUKE 24. After failing the first rung of the Salmon Ladder in the previous tournament, Hashimoto cleared the first three stages in SASUKE 24 with ease. In the Final Stage, he was slow on the Heavenly Ladder but made up ground on the G-Rope. He reached for the button as time expired but did not hit it in time.\n\nTakahashi Kenji, SASUKE 24. Takahashi had a great pace on the Heavenly Ladder, but on the G-Rope he was twisting up the rope and as a result had to stop to untangle his support wire. If had not twisting up the rope earlier, he would have achieved Kanzenseiha.\n\nMatachi Ryo, SASUKE 27. In Matachi's first three attempts he went out in First Stage. The fourth time was the charm as he finished the First Stage. Continuing his unlikely run, he managed to beat the Second and Third Stages on his first try. He and fellow Cliffer Urushihara were the only two to reach the finals. Ryo climbed quickly at first but started to tire and timed out about centimeters away from the buzzer. However, his performance pushed fellow Cliffer Urushihara to achieve a second Kanzenseiha.\n\nMatachi Ryo, SASUKE 30. Matachi once again made it to the Final Stage. He got slower as he got closer to the button and as the result, he timed out about 1.7 meters short. If he went at the same pace from the beginning, he might have achieved Kanzenseiha.\n\nMorimoto Yūsuke, SASUKE 36. Following his failure in SASUKE 35, he made it to the Final Stage two times in a row. This time, the Final Stage took place at Yokohama Red Brick Warehouse. His pace was considered faster than he did last tournament. However, possibly due to the wind, the rope kept swinging, losing precious time in order to transit to the Tsuna Nobori and as a result, he was late by 0.5 seconds trying to hit the button despite barely arriving around 0.5 meters atop of the tower. Had if the rope not swinging, he would have likely to achieve Kanzenseiha.\n\nMorimoto Yūsuke, SASUKE 40. Despite the setbacks he faced during the previous tournament, he tied Makoto Nagano's record of having five appearances in the Final Stage and being the first competitor to attempt three versions of that stage. His attempt on the Salmon Ladder Jūgo Dan was flawless and he managed to climb very fast on the Tsuna Nobori. However, possibly due to his valiant attempt on the Speed Climbing and the transition time in-between Speed Climbing to the Salmon Ladder Jūgo Dan has increased, he timed out around half a meter short from achieving his third Kanzenseiha.\n\nKUNOICHI[]\n\nIzumi Mika, KUNOICHI 3. Izumi had flown up the first part of the tower, but started too slow and didn't have enough time to climb high enough to touch the button, as she barely grazed it with her fingertips.\n\nMizuno Yuko, KUNOICHI 3. Mizuno was one of three people to attempt the redesigned Final Stage in this tournament and all three came close to Kanzenseiha. Mizuno being the closest. Had she reached for the button earlier, she would have achieved KUNOICHI's first Kanzenseiha at the time, but instead chose to get higher on the pole. As a result, she did not reach the button in time. The reporter who interviewed Mizuno noted that had she had one more second, she would have cleared. Incidentally, Mizuno Yuko's near-miss of Kanzenseiha was aired only a week before Nagano Makoto's near-miss of Kanzenseiha in SASUKE 12.\n\nKomiya Rie, KUNOICHI 5. Komiya started fast and made it to the Tenkubou in good time, but she couldn't climb fast enough and timed out at hair level to the finish button.\n\nTanaka Maho, KUNOICHI 6. Having clearing three stages earlier in fastest-pace, Tanaka is the first person to attempt the Final Stage of this tournament, with time limit reduced to 30 seconds. However, she was too slow from attempting Dai Zeppeki and is timing out when she was just transition to Tenkubou in gap meters, if she had to attempt without slowly in the portion of Dai Zeppeki earlier, she would have achieved Kanzenseiha.\n\nArimatsu Tomomi, KUNOICHI 8. Arimatsu actually finished the Final Stage in time, but when it was discovered that she grabbed the side of the board on the Climb Board, she was disqualified. If had not grasped the back of the board earlier, she would have achieved Kanzenseiha.\n\nAmerican Ninja Warrior[]\n\nDaniel Gil, American Ninja Warrior 11. Daniel was considered quick when he went up the rope. However, he started to slow down, and he had timed out about 70 feet up / 21.34 meters at the Rope Climb, around 1.534 meters short. Due to the one second time difference in finishing Stage Three, he chose to go last and followed Drew Drechsel's total victory. This is the first time out on Stage Four in American Ninja Warrior history.\n\nKaden Lebsack, American Ninja Warrior 13. Kaden became the first rookie in American Ninja Warrior's history to attempt Stage Four. He started with just his arms on the first twenty feet of the rope then started to incorporate the feet, due to his inexperience he slowed down and timed out around the 70-feet mark. He was the only competitor to make it to the stage, effectively making him Last Ninja Standing and winning the cash prize of US$100,000.\n\nKaden Lebsack, American Ninja Warrior 14. As Kaden became the first competitor in American Ninja Warrior to attempt Stage Four for two consecutive seasons, he would compete with Jay Lewis, Josiah Pippel, R.J. Roman and Josh Levin, a record amount across 14 seasons until the new record next season. Among all competitors, in order to determine the Last Man Standing, competitors would continue to climb up the rope and press the buzzer after timing out. As expected, Kaden reached the buzzer faster than the rest of the competitors, becoming the Last Ninja Standing for two consecutive seasons.\n\nSASUKE Ninja Warrior Indonesia[]\n\nJajang Wildan, SASUKE Ninja Warrior Indonesia: Misi Operasi Midoriyama. Jajang was the only competitor to advance to Mount Midoriyama Stage, which consisted of the Spider Climb (12.5 meters) and Rope Climb (12.5 meters), with the time limit of 30 seconds to complete the stage. He had a fast pace during the Spider Climb and Rope Climb, but his time ran out about 1.5 meters short. Had he cleared the Mount Midoriyama Stage, he would be the first Indonesian competitor to achieve Total Victory. It would also render SASUKE Ninja Warrior Indonesia to be the first international SASUKE/Ninja Warrior format have Total Victory in the first ever season.\n\nYosua Laskaman Zalukhu, SASUKE Ninja Warrior Indonesia 2. Yosua was the only competitor to advance to Mount Midoriyama Stage, which consisted of the Spider Climb (12.5 meters) and Rope Climb (12.5 meters), with the time limit of 30 seconds to complete the stage. He had a fast pace during the Spider Climb and Rope Climb, but his time ran out about 1 meter short. Despite that, it was the furthest than any other competitor in overall SASUKE Ninja Warrior Indonesia seasons at that time, and because of his achievement on that season, he would later become the captain of Team Indonesia during SASUKE Ninja Warrior Indonesia: International Competition, and then represented Team Asia during USA vs. The World 4.\n\nSASUKE Vietnam[]\n\nĐỗ Văn Quang, SASUKE Vietnam 2. He was the eighth competitor to attempt the Final Stage Tower in this season (after Nguyễn Huy Hạnh), which consisted of the Spider Climb (12 meters) and Rope Climb (12 meters), with the time limit of 30 seconds to complete the stage. He had a fast pace during the Spider Climb and Rope Climb, but his time ran out about 1 meters short and got eye-level with the buzzer about 1 second late. Had he cleared the Stage Four, he would be the first Vietnamese competitor become Total Victory in SASUKE Vietnam history.\n\nMike Bernardo, SASUKE Vietnam 2. He was the tenth competitor to attempt the Final Stage Tower in this season. After fellow American David Campbell achieved Total Victory that tournament, Mike had more motivation to climb the Stage Four tower. He had a fast pace during the Spider Climb and Rope Climb, but sadly his time ran out about 0.5 meters short. Had he cleared Stage Four, SASUKE Vietnam would render as the first international SASUKE/Ninja Warrior format have multiple international competitor to achieve Total Victory.\n\nNinja Warrior France[]\n\nThomas Ballet, Ninja Warrior France 2. He was the first person to attempt the Final Stage Tower, which consisted of a 23-meter rope, and he only had 30 seconds to complete it. He was close, timing out about 1.5 meters away the goal and got eye-level with the buzzer about 2 seconds late.\n\nJean Tezenas du Montcel, Ninja Warrior France 5. After achieving total victory in the last season, Jean returns stronger than ever. In the Finals, he had blazed through the first two stages with ease, barely struggling along the way. He became the first to complete Stage Two and advanced to the Final Stage after his own Total Victory in Ninja Warrior France. He had to beat his own time set by his previous total victory by climbing 23 meters rope in just 32 seconds. Nevertheless, even using every nook and cranny on the rope, climbing as fast as he can, he desperately reached the buzzer with 1 second remaining and fell short, ending his performance.\n\nMichel Lajic, Ninja Warrior France 6. Being the last to attempt out of the four competitors in the tournament, Lajic had the added pressure of completing the course in a shorter time than what was set prior to the attempts of the first three competitors. The time limit was shortened down to a 25 second time limit from the original 32 second due to the total victories of Iliann Cherif and Clement Gravier who cleared the stage. Lajic would have a decent pace on the rope and managed to time out with a few meters away from the buzzer. Had there been no changes in the time limit, he could've been the third competitor to complete the Final Stage in that tournament.\n\nCharles Poujade, Ninja Warrior France 7. He was the first out of the five who managed to reach the Final Stage in said season, and had to complete Final Stage within the time limit set by Clément Gravier in the previous season, of just 25.16 seconds. During his Final Stage attempt, Poujade would display an amazing pace throughout first half of the Final Stage rope, but would slow down a little bit during the second half. At the end of the day, his effort was not enough, with Poujade timing out just about 2 seconds away from the button and then pressing the button at a time of 27.67 seconds. However due to the fact that he came the closest to complete the Final Stage within the time limit out of all the finalists, he got declared as the Last Man Standing of the season.\n\nClément Gravier, Ninja Warrior France 7. He was the second out of the five who managed to reach the Final Stage in said season, and had to complete the Final Stage (Tours des Héros) within the time limit set by himself in the previous season of just 25.16 seconds. Knowing that this would be a very difficult task, Clément Gravier started his Final Stage attempt and would display an extraordinarily good pace throughout the first half of the Rope Climb, and at that point it looked as if he would beat his already extraordinary performance of the previous season. However, with about 6 seconds remaining on the clock and being near the top, Gravier began to falter and struggle which caused him to lose precious seconds. At the end of the day, even Gravier's effort was not enough, with him timing out mere decimeters away from the button and then pressing the button at a time of 27.84 seconds which at the end of the day was 17 hundredths of a second worse than the time of Last Man Standing of the season, Charles Poujade.\n\nNinja Warrior Germany[]\n\nAlexander Wurm, Ninja Warrior Germany 3. He was the first person to attempt the Final Stage Tower, and he only had 25 seconds to complete 20-meter Rope Climb. Wurm would be close to beating the course, timed out about 1.5 meters away the goal and got eye-level with the buzzer about 2 seconds late.\n\nNinja Warrior Poland[]\n\nJan Tatarowicz, Ninja Warrior Poland 7. He was the second participant, out of the six participants, who has managed to reach the Final Stage in said season, who attempted the Final Stage and had to complete the Final Stage (a 21-metre Rope Climb) within the time limit of 25 seconds. During the first half of his Final Stage attempt, Tatarowicz would display a very good pace, but would slowly start to run out steam during the second half of his attempt. And despite his effort, Jan Tatarowicz would still time out at the end of the day, with him pressing the button just 0.5 seconds after he timed out.\n\nDamian Drzewiecki, Ninja Warrior Poland 8, he attempted this Final Stage at the same height and with the same strict time limit. He timed out on the rope.\n\nNinja Israel[]\n\nYuval Shemla, Ninja Warrior Israel. Shemla was the first and only person to attempt the Final Stage Tower in the first ever season of Ninja Israel in which he need to climb a 23.5-meter Rope Climb within 30 seconds. Sadly, his time ran out about 0.6 meters short. Had he cleared the Final Stage, he would have been the first Israeli competitor to achieve Total Victory in his first season appearance. In addition, Ninja Israel would have been the first international SASUKE/Ninja Warrior format to have Total Victory in the first season.\n\nNinja Warrior Hungary[]\n\nChristian Harmat, Ninja Warrior Hungary 3. Harmat was the first person to attempt the Final Stage Tower in which he need to climb the 20-meter Rope Climb within 30 seconds. The buzzer used on the stage has similarity on the ones used on Stage One and Two therefore requiring competitors to climb all the way upwards to press the buzzer compared to traditional setups of the stage where the buzzer is short. During Harmat's run, he was already near the top of the tower once his time expired. Had the buzzer been on a lower height, he would've completed the stage in that tournament.\n\nGallery[]\n\nSASUKE[]\n\nAmerican Ninja Warrior[]\n\nSASUKE Vietnam[]\n\nNinja Warrior UK[]\n\nNinja Warrior France[]\n\nAustralian Ninja Warrior[]\n\nNinja Warrior Germany[]\n\nNinja Israel[]\n\nNinja Warrior Austria[]"
