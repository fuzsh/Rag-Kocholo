In the countries of the world more than a million copies of such charts are now issued annually. A considerable portion of the human race is interested directly or indirectly, whether as mariners or passengers or shippers, in navigation upon the sea. Aside from supplying a handbook for those who might have a general interest in the subject, it was thought that a discussion of charts might lead to further consideration of the principles governing their construction.\n\nThis paper has intentionally been made as non-technical as seemed feasible in treating a somewhat technical subject. The writer is indebted to the Coast and Geodetic Survey for various illustrative material from its archives, and to a number of authors for facts or suggestions. A list is appended of books and papers which have been freely consulted, bearing on this and related subjects.\n\nG. R.

Only by means of a correct map or globe can a clear idea of the geography of a region be given. An attempt to convey the same information by a written description would in comparison be both cumbersome and obscure. Even by passing over an extensive region a man unaided by instruments will obtain only a rather crude notion of the relations, which he could clearly see on a good map. The importance among the human arts of the making of maps is indicated by the references to them in very early historical records, and by the skill in map drawing shown by some of the primitive peoples of to-day. This skill exists particularly among races whose mode of life gives them a wide horizon, as for instance the Eskimos. An interesting instance of this was the case of Joe, an Eskimo guide, who, in 1898, before the surveys of the Yukon delta were made, drew a map of the Yukon mouths with much more complete information than any previously available.\n\nWithout attempting to enumerate in detail the special uses for maps, in the broader sense they may be said to be essential for commercial, engineering, military, scientific, educational, and political purposes.\n\n[Pg 2]\n\nEarly geography and map making. The oldest map known is a plan of gold mines in Nubia, drawn on a papyrus. This is of the thirteenth century B.C., and was found in Egypt.\n\nIn the earliest historic times men believed the earth to be a flat surface of nearly circular outline, a natural inference for those with limited outlook and communication. Later the idea was introduced of the ocean as a river bounding the earth disk. The spherical theory of the earth was, however, early accepted by learned men, and was demonstrated by Aristotle (384 to 322 B.C.), who used as proofs the earth's shadow on the moon, and the change in the visibility of the stars in traveling north or south. Crates constructed a terrestrial globe in the second century B.C.\n\nThere is no Greek or Latin map extant of earlier date than the time of Ptolemy, but there are references showing that maps were in use. One of the first of such passages in Greek literature is the interesting comment of Herodotus written in the fifth century B.C., \"but I laugh when I see many who already have drawn the circuits of the earth, without any right understanding thereof. Thus they draw Oceanus flowing round the earth, which is circular, as though turned by a lathe, and they make Asia equal to Europe.\"\n\nA map of the world was drawn by Anaximander, 560 B.C. A hundred years later Democritus drew a map having an oblong shape, and taught that the width of the world from east to west was one and a half times its extent from north to south, a conclusion based on his travels eastward as far as India. This theory, which was for a time accepted, has left an enduring[Pg 3] mark in the words longitude and latitude, originally signifying the length and the breadth of the earth.\n\nThe first application of astronomy to geography was made by Pytheas, who about 326 B.C. obtained the latitude of Marseilles by an observation of the altitude of the sun. Dicearchus in 310 B.C. determined the first parallel of latitude by noting places where on the same day the sun cast shadows of equal length from pillars of equal height. Eratosthenes (276 to 196 B.C.) was the first to compute the circumference of the earth from observations of the altitude of the sun at Alexandria and at Syene in Upper Egypt and an estimation of the distance between these two places. Ptolemy, a Greek of Alexandria, in the years from 127 to 151 A.D. wrote extensively on geographic subjects, and collected into systematic form all geographic knowledge then existing; he was the greatest geographer of early history.\n\nIn the ten centuries which followed, part of the early advance in this science was obscured, and the theory that the earth was a flat disk surrounded by the sea again became prevalent. The voyages of discovery of the middle ages, however, led to a rapid development of geographic knowledge.\n\nThe flattening of the spherical earth was not suspected until in 1672 a clock regulated to beat seconds at Paris, when taken to Cayenne near the equator was found to lose two and one-half minutes a day. Newton proved that this was due to the fact that the earth is an oblate spheroid. In 1735 accurate measurements were undertaken to determine the size and shape of the earth. The equatorial diameter has been found to be 7926.6 miles and the polar diameter 7899.6 miles,[Pg 4] the difference, or 27 statute miles, being the amount of the flattening at the poles.\n\nThe first sailing directions. The early Greek and Roman writers do not allude to charts or maps intended especially for the use of seafarers. There are, however, extant several peripli or descriptions of the coast. Some of these appear certainly to have been intended for use as nautical guides, corresponding to the modern sailing directions. It is probable that they were explanatory of or accompanied by coast charts, now lost. They are of interest therefore as being probably the first compilations for the guidance of seamen. One of the earliest, written apparently in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C., is entitled \"Scylax of Caryanda, his circumnavigation of the sea of the inhabited part of Europe and Asia and Libya.\" It contains a systematic description of the coasts of the Mediterranean, Black Sea, and part of the west coast of Africa. The following are some extracts which indicate the character of the work. It is to be noted that no bearings are given, and that distances are usually stated by day's sail: Africa is referred to as Libya.\n\n\"Europe. I shall begin from the Pillars of Hercules in Europe and continue to the Pillars of Hercules in Libya, and as far as the land of the great Ethiopians. The Pillars of Hercules are opposite each other, and are distant from each other by one day's sail.... From Thonis the voyage to Pharos, a desert island (good harborage but no drinking water), is 150 stadia. In Pharos are many harbors. But ships water at the Marian mere, for it is drinkable.... From Chersonesus is one day's sail; but from Naustathmus to[Pg 5] the harbor of Cyrene, 100 stadia. But from the harbor to Cyrene, 80 stadia; for Cyrene is inland. These harbors are always fit for putting into. And there are other refuges at little islands, and anchorages and many beaches, in the district between.... After the isthmus is Carthage, a city of the Phœnicians, and a harbor. Sailing along from Hermæa it is half a day to Carthage. There are islands off the Hermæan cape, Pontia island and Cosyrus. From Hermæa to Cosyrus is a day's sail. Beyond the Hermæan cape, towards the rising sun, are three islands belonging to this shore, inhabited by Carthaginians; the city and harbor of Melite, the city of Gaulus, and Lampas; this has two or three towers.... The sailing along Libya from the Canopic mouth in Egypt to the Pillars of Hercules ... takes 74 days if one coast round the bays.... From the cape of Hermæa extend great reefs, that is, from Libya towards Europe, not rising above the sea; it washes over them at times.... From Thymiateria one sails to cape Soloes, which juts far into the sea. But all this district of Libya is very famous and very sacred.... This whole coasting from the Pillars of Hercules to Cerne Island takes twelve days. The parts beyond the isle of Cerne are no longer navigable because of shoals, mud, and sea-weed. This sea-weed has the width of a palm, and is sharp towards the points, so as to prick.\"\n\nThat there were many other similar writings in the following centuries is shown by the following quotation from Marcianus, in a preface to sailing directions written in the fifth century A.D.: \"This I write after having gone through many sailing directions, and spent much time on their examination. For it behooves all[Pg 6] who are men of education, to scrutinise such attempts at learning in this subject, so as neither rashly to believe the things that are said, nor incredulously to set their private opinions against the careful decisions of others.\"\n\nThe oldest extant sailing directions of the middle ages bear date 1306 to 1320.\n\nDevelopment of chart making. The application of the compass to nautical use in the twelfth century A.D. had a marked effect in encouraging voyages of exploration, and therefore indirectly on chart making. The following, written toward the close of the twelfth century, is the first known mention of the use of the compass in Europe: \"The sailors, moreover, as they sail over the sea, when in cloudy weather they cannot longer profit by the light of the sun, or when the world is wrapped in the darkness of the shades of night, and they are ignorant to what part of the horizon the prow is directed, place the needle over the magnet, which is whirled round in a circle, until, when the motion ceases, the point of it (the needle) looks to the north.\" The nautical compass of that time appears to have consisted of a magnetized needle, floated in a vessel of water by a cork or reed, and having no index nor compass card. Peregrinus in 1269 made notable improvements in the compass, including a pivot suspension for the needle, a graduation, a lubber line, and an azimuth bar for sighting on the sun or other object.\n\nNautical charts are known to have been in use since the thirteenth century A.D., but the earliest extant of which the date can be fixed is Vesconte's loxodromic chart of 1311.\n\n[Pg 7]\n\nThe loxodromic charts first appeared in Italy, and were so called from the fact that they were crossed by loxodromes (or rhumb lines) radiating from a number of crossing points distributed regularly over the map. Compass roses carefully drawn were later added at these crossing points, the first appearing on a chart of 1375. The earliest known mention of the variation of the compass from true north was on the first voyage of Columbus, who discovered this important fact in 1492, and as a consequence his \"seamen were terrified and dismayed.\" Before that time it was assumed in Europe that the compass pointed \"true to the north pole.\" The apparent failure to detect the variation earlier was doubtless to some extent due to its small amount at that time along the Mediterranean. The earlier charts showed both lines and compass roses apparently oriented with the true meridian, though there is some evidence to indicate that they were actually oriented with the magnetic meridian, the designer not recognizing any difference. The variation of the compass was first marked on a map in 1532 and on a printed chart in 1595, but the placing of magnetic compasses on charts did not become customary until about fifty years ago. These early charts were drawn on parchment, using bright colors. They were copied by hand, one from another, with gradual variations. They had no projections, and the draftsmen evidently had no idea of the sphericity of the earth. Islands and points were usually exaggerated; shallows were indicated, but no soundings; no information was given as to the interior of the countries; a scale of distances was nearly always provided.\n\n[Pg 8]\n\nCharts were first printed about 1477, and are known to have been engraved on copper by 1560.\n\nThe maps of Ptolemy were ruled with degree lines, but no chart was so provided until 1427; by 1500, however, most charts were graduated. Before this date it is not known on what projection the charts were constructed. On the first graduated charts the degree lines were equidistant parallel straight lines cutting each other at right angles and thus dividing the chart into equal squares or rectangles. These were known as \"plain charts.\" This square projection had little to commend it save simplicity of construction, as in higher latitudes it gave neither directions nor distances correctly. The difficulties of its use in navigation were early recognized, and nautical works contained chapters on \"sailing by the plain chart, and the uncertainties thereof.\"\n\nThe example of early chart making shown in Fig. 2 is of great interest as being the earliest extant chart which includes America. This chart was drawn on ox-hide in 1500 by Juan de la Cosa, who accompanied Columbus on his first voyage as master of his flagship, and on his second voyage as cartographer. The chart, of which only a portion is shown here, purports to cover the entire world; it joins Asia and America as one continent, the Pacific Ocean being then still unknown.\n\nGerhard Krämer, a Flemish map-maker, better known by his Latin name of Mercator, in 1569 published his famous Universal Map. In this map the meridians and parallels were still straight lines intersecting at right angles, but the distances between the parallels were increased with increasing latitude in such proportion that a rhumb line, or line cutting the meridians at a constant angle, would appear on the map as a straight line. Mercator never explained the construction of his chart, and as the above condition was not accurately carried out, it is thought that the chart was drawn by comparing a terrestrial globe with a \"plain chart.\" After examination of a mercator chart in 1590, Edward Wright developed the correct principles on which such a chart should be constructed, and published in 1599 his treatise \"The Correction of Certain Errors in Navigation.\" It took nearly a century to bring this chart into use, and even in the middle of the eighteenth century nautical writers complain that \"some prefer the plain chart.\"\n\nThe Arcano del Mare, 1646, was the first marine atlas in which all the maps were drawn on the mercator projection.\n\nIn the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries charts and sailing directions were often bound together in large volumes. These usually had quaint titles, not overburdened with modesty, of which the following is an example: \"The Lightning Columne, or Sea-Mirrour, containing the Sea-Coasts of the Northern, Eastern, and Western Navigation. Setting forth in divers necessaire Sea-Cards, all the Ports, Rivers, Bayes, Roads, Depths, and Sands. Very curiously placed on its due Polus height furnished. With the Discoveries of the chief Countries and on what Cours and Distance they lay one from another. Never there to fore so Clearly laid open, and here and there very diligently bettered and augmented for the use of all Seamen. As also the situation of the Northerly Countries, as[Pg 9-10] Islands, the Strate Davids, the Isle of Jan Mayen, Bears Island, Old Greenland, Spitsbergen and Nova Zembla. Adorneth with many Sea-Cards and Discoveries. Gathered out of the Experiences and practice of divers Pilots and Lovers of the famous Art of Navigation. Where unto is added a brief Instruction of the Art of Navigation, together with New Tables of the Sun's Declination, with a new Almanach. At Amsterdam. Printed by Casparus Loots-Man, Bookseller in the Loots-Man, upon the Water. Anno 1697. With Previlege for fiftheen years.\"\n\nIn 1633 a cartographer was appointed to the States-General of Holland, and it was his duty to correct the charts from the ships' logs. The Dutch at an early date made important progress in publishing charts. In 1720 there was established in Paris by order of the king, a central chart office (\"dépôt des cartes et plans, journaux et mémoires concernant la navigation\"), and in 1737 the first charts were published by this office. Detailed surveys of the coast of France were commenced in 1816.\n\nIn 1740 \"the commissioners for the discovery of longitude at sea\" were authorized by Parliament to expend money on the survey of the coasts of Great Britain, this commission having been created in 1713. Various rewards were offered by this commission, including one of £10,000, for the discovery of a method of determining the longitude within 60 miles, an interesting side light on the uncertainties of navigation at that time. Compensated timepieces, which have been so important a factor in improving navigation, were invented by Harrison about 1761.\n\n[Pg 11]\n\n[Pg 12-13]\n\nIn 1795, by an Order in Council, a Hydrographical Office was established in London, \"to take charge and custody of such plans and charts as then were, or should thereafter be, deposited in the Admiralty, and to select and compile such information as might appear to be requisite for the purpose of improving navigation.\" This office had at first one assistant and one draftsman. Before that time many charts of a private or semiofficial character had been published; the catalogue of the East India Company in 1786 included 347 charts.\n\nIn 1807 the Congress of the United States authorized the President \"to cause a survey to be taken of the coasts of the United States, in which shall be designated the islands and shoals, with the roads or places of anchorage, within twenty leagues of any part of the shores of the United States; and also the respective courses and distances between the principal capes, or headlands, together with such other matters as he may deem proper for completing an accurate chart of every part of the coasts within the extent aforesaid.\" This law was the origin of the present United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, now under the Department of Commerce and Labor.\n\nIn 1841 a systematic survey of the Great Lakes was commenced; this is the Survey of the Northern and Northwestern Lakes, briefly known as the Lake Survey, conducted under the Corps of Engineers.\n\nIn 1866 the United States Hydrographic Office was established under the Navy Department \"for the improvement of the means for navigating safely the vessels of the Navy, and of the mercantile marine, by providing under the authority of the Secretary of[Pg 14] the Navy, accurate and cheap nautical charts, sailing directions, navigators, and manuals of instructions for the use of all vessels of the United States, and for the benefit and use of navigation generally.\"\n\nSystematic surveying and chart making date back little more than a century, and most of the information shown on modern charts has been gathered in that time. At present all the principal maritime nations of the world have made, or are extending, careful surveys of their own coasts.\n\nSeveral of the countries have added valuable contributions in the examination of other regions and oceanic areas beyond their borders. The maritime and colonial interests of Great Britain impelled that nation to carry on extensive surveys along coasts whose inhabitants were not prepared to do this work in the earlier days; the British have made surveys along the coasts of Asia and Africa and a part of South America, and the resulting charts have been a very important and not sufficiently known contribution to commercial intercourse among the nations, as well as to geography.\n\nThe Dutch, French, Spanish, and other European governments have made nautical surveys in various parts of the world, largely in connection with their own colonies, and in recent years much useful work has been done by vessels of the German government. The United States has also beyond its own territory made valuable additions to hydrographic knowledge in the work of officers of the Navy in a number of oceanic exploring expeditions, and surveys on the coasts of Mexico and in the West Indies, and in the explorations of Fish Commission vessels.\n\n[Pg 15]\n\n[Pg 16-17]\n\nExtension of maritime surveys. Of the total area of the earth's surface, 51,886,000 square miles is land and 145,054,000 square miles is sea. The oceans thus occupy nearly three-fourths of the whole surface, affording highways open to the nations. To conduct international commerce by water the ships of one country must enter the ports of another. Thus both on the open sea and in the harbors there is an interest, common to seamen of all nationalities, in the advance of marine surveys and in the publication of charts.\n\nTo keep the coasts properly charted, as well as lighted and buoyed, is an obligation devolving on modern nations, not only for the benefit of their own commerce but for that of other countries.\n\nAs shown below, only a small part of the coast line of the world is thoroughly surveyed. In the extensive ocean areas which are dotted with islands or reefs, a large amount of work is required for their sufficient charting, although many doubtful areas have been cleared up in recent years. Even the parts that are known to be of depths so great as to be free from navigational dangers should be sounded over sufficiently to develop the general configuration of the ocean bottom.\n\nThrough international understanding a thorough exploration of all the water area of the globe and the coasts may in time be effected, and the many doubtful spots which still disfigure the charts may be either eliminated or definitely located.\n\nPresent state of progress of hydrographic surveys. A comparatively small proportion of the coasts of the world can be considered as completely surveyed at the present time, and even such regions require much[Pg 18] additional revision. In the class of more thoroughly surveyed coasts should be included the Atlantic and most of the Pacific coast of the United States, Porto Rico, nearly all the coasts of Europe, Algeria, and portions of the coasts of Japan, the Philippine Islands, and India.\n\nA large part of the world's coasts has been surveyed incompletely, but sufficiently well to permit the publication of navigational charts. This is the condition as respects most of southeastern Alaska and some other portions of the Alaskan coast, British Columbia, most of Mexico, Central America, the West Indies, Brazil and parts of Chile, the Hawaiian Islands, China, Malay Peninsula, Siam, the Dutch East Indies, Australia, New Zealand, Persia, Arabia, most of Africa, Iceland, northern Scandinavia, and Finland.\n\nAnother considerable portion of the coasts has not been surveyed, but has been covered by explorations which have been embodied in nautical charts of varied degrees of incompleteness. In this class are the north coast and considerable portions of the south and west coasts of Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, Siberia, most of the oceanic groups in the Pacific, the northern coasts of Europe and North America, Greenland, the west coast of South America, Venezuela, and Argentina.\n\nOnly a very small proportion of the total length of coasts is now entirely unexplored, and such portions are confined to the polar regions.\n\nChart publications of various nations. There are about eighteen nations publishing navigational charts, and adding to the information on which charts are based. Many of these nations republish to some extent[Pg 19] the charts prepared by the others. Great Britain has kept up a series of charts covering all parts of the world and practically including in some form all information published elsewhere. This series now (1908) includes 3725 different charts, of which the annual issue is about 600,000 copies. France (1906) publishes 2948 different charts.\n\nIn the United States, charts are published by the Coast and Geodetic Survey for the coasts and tidal waters of the main country and the insular possessions, by the Hydrographic Office for oceanic areas and foreign coasts, and by the Lake Survey for the Great Lakes. The total number of different charts issued by these bureaus is about 2300, and the total annual issue is about 225,000 copies.\n\nSystems in use on various charts.\n\nLongitude. The first chart of New York, published by the Coast Survey in 1844, was referred to the City Hall of New York as the initial longitude, and some years ago it was the prevailing custom for each nation to use a local initial longitude. While this satisfied local pride it led to much geographical and navigational confusion. Happily the charts of all countries are now referred to Greenwich, with the following exceptions:\n\nFrance refers to Paris, which is 2° 20´ 15´´ E. of Greenwich.\n\nSpain refers to San Fernando, which is 6° 12´ 20´´ W. of Greenwich.\n\nPortugal refers to Lisbon, which is 9° 08´ 24´´ W. of Greenwich.\n\nUnits for depths. The English fathom or foot is used for depths on the charts of Great Britain, the United States, and Japan. Russia uses the sajene of seven[Pg 20] English feet. On the modern charts of practically all the other countries the meter is used, though on older charts various units are found.\n\nIn the first group feet are ordinarily found only on large scale or local charts of areas with moderate depths, and the other charts are in fathoms, except that on the earlier charts of the Coast and Geodetic Survey feet were used on a sanded surface inside of the three-fathom curve and fathoms on the white surface outside of that curve. Heights are stated in feet on the charts of the first group.\n\nPlane of reference. As the depth of water varies with the tide, it is necessary for charting purposes to adopt some standard plane to which the soundings are referred. Practically all countries have adopted for this purpose a low stage of the tide, as this is obviously on the side of safety; in most cases an extreme low water is used, so that the actual depths will seldom, owing to the tide, be less than those shown on the chart. The definite reference planes used on the American charts will be mentioned later.\n\nOn nearly all charts heights are referred to mean high water, doubtless owing to this being the visible limit of the land at high tide. On topographic maps of the interior, the heights are referred to mean sea level, which plane is of course lower than the preceding by one-half the range of tide.\n\nSymbols on charts. Fair uniformity as to general principles, with differences as to details in carrying them out, exists on the various series of charts regarding their general arrangement and the more important symbols, such as in the shading of land to distinguish[Pg 21] from water, the use of depth curves, the representation of hills by shade or contour, the indication of shoals and dangers, and of lighthouses and buoys.\n\nDesirability of uniformity in charts. Ships engaged in international commerce must enter foreign ports. As the information is constantly changing and charts are being corrected or improved, it is sometimes desirable for the navigator to consult the local foreign charts, and it may often be necessary for him to carry in his chart room the charts of several different countries. There are therefore important advantages in international uniformity in chart publication.\n\nThere should be a common initial longitude, and as the longitude of Greenwich has been so extensively adopted, it appears quite probable that its use may some day become universal.\n\nA common unit for soundings and heights would be very desirable, but the fact that a large group of nations has united on the metric system, while a small group with great commercial interests retains another system, makes the attainment of uniformity difficult.\n\nSubstantial agreement as to the use of symbols on charts, particularly such as represent aids or dangers to navigation, would be desirable and doubtless feasible.\n\nPrivately published charts. Many of the earlier charts were prepared and published by private enterprise, and such charts are still published, as, for instance, the so-called \"blue-back\" charts printed in London. These charts have usually differed from those published by the various governments either in representing the main features in a very bold manner with little detail or in including a considerable area with many plans on a[Pg 22] single large sheet backed for permanency. An objection to the latter is that the durability together with the high price tends to keep an old chart in use long after it is out of date. It would be financially difficult for a private firm to give the service that a government does in the matter of correcting the charts and issuing new editions, and this is an important consideration in the selection of charts.\n\nPurpose of charts. The main purpose of charts is to furnish graphical guides to aid in taking a vessel safely from one port to another; they are maps for the use of navigators. An experienced mariner may be able to steer his vessel over a familiar course without charts, but this does not make their publication less necessary. Even such an expert pilot doubtless studied the charts in the first place; the uncertainties of the sea and the changes of information are such that his vessel's equipment should include the latest charts, and safety requires their examination. The passengers and the merchants who intrust their lives or their goods to the sea are largely dependent upon the correctness of the charts.\n\nBesides their main purpose charts fill many other needs, among which are; for preliminary planning of harbor improvements and various engineering works, for defensive works and other military uses, for the fishing interests, and for general information as to the coastal regions. Charts will furnish much of interest and instruction to the traveler by sea and the dweller near the coast, who will learn to read them. Passenger steamers should more often for the interest of their patrons display charts of the waters traversed. No[Pg 23] written or verbal description can give as clear an idea of geographical features and relations as a good map or chart.\n\nAs the charts are revised from time to time, a comparison of editions at different dates furnishes a record of the changes wrought by nature or man, and this is especially useful in studying the action in many harbor and river entrances, as well as for historical purposes.\n\nRequirements for charts. As charts are maps of the water areas, including the adjoining land, and intended primarily for the use of mariners, they differ in important respects from topographic maps or general maps, even such as include the water areas. The main requirements for charts are these; correct and complete information, early publication of new data, clear and intelligible representation of the information, convenient arrangement as navigational instruments, and high standard of publication.\n\nThe special and sometimes difficult conditions under which charts must be used on shipboard call for good judgment throughout their preparation. Even the paper on which they are printed is of importance, in order that they may be sufficiently durable and suitable for plotting.\n\nInformation given on charts. It is evident that it is impossible to represent on a chart of any practicable scale all the features that exist on the corresponding area of the earth's surface. It is essential, therefore, that a selection be made of the classes of facts that are to be shown, as well as of the detail that is to be used for each class. The practical utility of the chart depends largely on the good judgment used in this selection. In[Pg 24] the information shown, charts differ from maps principally in representing by soundings and curves the configuration of the bottom of the water area, and in showing ordinarily the topographic features only in the vicinity of the coast line.\n\nThe convenience of mariners should govern in the selection and arrangement of the information to be shown on charts, though they may be made useful for other purposes so long as this convenience is not lessened. The needs and preferences of navigators alone, however, differ so much that a reasonable chart must be somewhat of a compromise between conflicting views. For certain classes of navigation a boldly drawn chart showing only the dangers and a few other soundings and some landmarks might be useful. For other maritime purposes a more detailed chart would be valuable. The first, however, would fail to give facts often demanded in the navigational use of the chart, and the second if carried to an extreme would make a chart difficult to use.\n\nShoals and dangers are shown either by the least depth or by rock or reef symbols. The characteristic soundings are shown on the chart, with abbreviations indicating the nature of the bottom. Depth curves are drawn, joining together points of like depth, and inclosing areas of less depth, on the same principle that contours are used on land maps; usually also the shoaler spots are made more prominent by sanding or tinting the area within them. Lighthouses, buoys, and other artificial aids to navigation are represented, with descriptive abbreviations. The coast is shown by a bold solid line for high water and a dotted line[Pg 25-29] for low water. The main topographic features are represented for a moderate distance from the coast, with such detail as is useful, depending on the scale of the chart. Elevations are given in figures for prominent summits, islands, and rocks; the general configuration of hills and mountains is represented by contours on large scale charts or by hachures or shading on small scale charts. Rivers, streams, lakes, marshes, towns, roads, prominent buildings, and other important topographic features are shown by appropriate symbols. It is important that objects which may be useful in navigation as landmarks, whether natural or artificial, be plainly shown and described, if necessary to their identification, and that they should not be obscured by details of lesser importance. On the larger scale charts only, vegetation features, particularly areas covered by trees, are represented by symbols. The land area is usually clearly distinguished from the water area by a tint or stipple. Latitude and longitude are given by the projection lines and the subdivided border, or sometimes on harbor plans by a note giving the position of some one point. Brief information as to the time and range of the tides is stated in a note. Data regarding currents, whether due to tidal or other causes, are given by current arrows placed on the chart, or by explanatory notes. Compasses are for convenience printed on the charts, and data given as to the magnetic variation and its rate of change. On large scale charts scales are provided for use in measuring distances. Ranges and channel lines are given when required. The ports are indicated where storm warning signals are displayed. The areas of forbidden anchor[Pg 30]ages are shown, and when important, the positions of submarine cables. The lines dividing the high seas from inland waters are sometimes stated on United States charts. Life saving stations are given, and time balls are usually noted. Views of important features are shown on some charts.\n\nThe layman who looks at the printed chart probably does not appreciate the amount or the variety of information that must be gathered and sifted and put in proper shape for a single chart.\n\n[Pg 31]\n\nCOLLECTION OF INFORMATION FOR CHARTS\n\nNeed of thorough surveys. As has been stated, a good chart requires that a thorough and correct survey be first made of the region to be charted. It is said that men are very apt to accept as true anything they see on a map. As to the nautical chart the mariner is likely to be somewhat more critical, however, and it is well that he is. The difficulty of charting an invisible surface such as the bottom of the sea is great, and the proportion of the navigable waters surveyed in sufficient detail to be at all certain of the absence of uncharted dangers is small.\n\nThe planning of surveys in a new region, such, for instance, as the Philippine Islands, presents many interesting problems, on the solution of which the effectiveness in chart results and the cost of the work materially depend. Many local conditions must be taken into account. The surveys are made on opposite coasts according to the seasonal winds and rainfall. In some parts fair-sized steamers are necessary; in others launches and small boats can do the work more economically. Shore parties with land transportation are used for portions of the work where the country permits. Natives are employed as far as practicable for the classes of work they can do; the Filipinos, for instance, make good sailors on the vessels and excellent penmen in the office.\n\nThe following is a brief outline of the steps of a com[Pg 32]plete survey for charting purposes, according to the present practice of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. These are given in their logical order, though in actual work this order must often be departed from. In this Survey the methods of control have been of a high standard; that is, the main stations have been accurately determined and permanently marked and described, and this has proven an advantage in the joining together of the original surveys and resurveys.\n\nAstronomical observations. To locate on the surface of the earth the area to be charted, astronomical observations are required for the latitude and longitude of one or more points. In the best practice the longitude of a point is obtained by observing the transits of stars to get the local time, and sending time signals by telegraph to obtain the difference from the local time of some other place whose longitude is known. The latitude is observed by measuring the difference of zenith distance of pairs of stars crossing the meridian north and south of the zenith. The azimuth or true direction of some line is also obtained from star observations, usually by observations with a theodolite on a circumpolar star. Much existing chart work depends on positions determined by less accurate methods, as, for instance, longitudes obtained by transporting chronometers between the known station and that to be determined, or by observations of moon culminations, and latitudes obtained by direct observations of the altitudes of stars with theodolite or sextant.\n\nTriangulation. The main framework of the survey consists of a series of triangles connecting prominently located points which are permanently marked in the[Pg 33-39] ground and the location described so that they can be found at a future time. At long intervals in the survey base lines are laid out and carefully measured with steel tape. Signals are erected over the points, including those at the ends of the base line, and angles are then measured at the various stations. From the measured length of the base and the angles the lengths of the sides of the triangles are computed, and from these lengths and the latitude and longitude of one point the latitudes and longitudes of all the other points are obtained. When several astronomically determined points are connected by such a triangulation a complication arises from what is known as \"deflection of the plumb line,\" which is the angular amount by which the actual sea-level surface of the earth departs from the symmetrical figure of revolution, owing to the variations in the density of the earth's outer layers. The distance between two points as measured by triangulation thus differs from the distance computed from the astronomically determined positions. If this irregularity were not taken care of by adopting mean positions, the discrepancy in joining up different surveys would in extreme cases amount to about half a mile.\n\nSurvey sheets are next prepared, of suitable size and scale. On each sheet a projection is laid down, that is, the meridians and parallels are drawn, and all the points determined in the triangulation are plotted in their true relation. Usually separate sheets are prepared for the topography or shore survey and for the hydrography or survey of the water area.\n\nTopography. The topographic survey of the shore and as much of the adjacent area as is required is[Pg 40] usually made with a plane table, on which the map is actually drawn in the field as the work progresses. Points are located on the plane table sheet either by direct reading of the distance on a stadia rod or by intersections from two or more stations. On the plane table sheet it is customary to locate the shore or high-water line, the low-water line, off-lying rocks, streams, rivers, roads, towns, lighthouses, and all prominent features near the coast. Elevations are measured with the plane table or obtained from the triangulation, and are represented on the sheet both by figures and by contours, which are lines joining together points of the same elevation. For instance, a 100-foot contour represents the line where a plane 100 feet above sea level would cut the surface of the ground. It is particularly important in this topographic work to locate accurately objects which are good landmarks and likely to be of use to the mariner. In some regions auxiliary methods are used in filling in the topography, as, for instance, along a difficult coast each feature of importance may be located by sextant angles, or a traverse line may be run along the shore by the transit and stadia method.\n\nThe hydrography, or the survey of the water area, is of prime importance for the chart, but in the order of prosecution of the work it is convenient but not essential that it come after sufficient points have been located by the triangulation and topography. A hydrographic sheet is prepared on which all the points are plotted which will be useful. A system of sounding lines is then run over the entire area to be surveyed, locating the position of the sounding boat at intervals by sextant[Pg 41-49] angles on survey signals or by angles from the shore. The ordinary method of sounding is to cast a lead from a boat and read the depth when the lead touches bottom and the line is vertical, and make note of the nature of the bottom. There is a systematic spacing between the casts of the lead and between the lines passed over by the boat, depending on the depth of water and character of the bottom. For soundings in deeper water various forms of sounding machines are used, with weight attached to a wire. For very great depths a small steel wire is employed and the weight is detached and left on the bottom. The deepest sounding thus far made, 5269 fathoms, or nearly six miles, was obtained by this method in the Pacific Ocean near Guam.\n\nThe offshore soundings are made from a surveying steamer; the inshore work is usually done by a launch or small boat.\n\nSo far as the navigational use of charts is concerned it is important that the hydrography shall show the limiting depths and the freedom from dangers, of channels, entrances, harbors, and anchorages. It is also desirable that the soundings shall be carried off shore at least as far as the one-hundred-fathom curve, as with the modern forms of navigational sounding machines it is possible for vessels under way to obtain soundings to this depth, and such soundings may be of value in identifying the location of the vessel. For depths greater than one hundred fathoms the soundings have less direct value to navigation except as proving the absence of shoaler areas, but soundings throughout the oceanic regions are of great geographical interest as well as of direct practical value in the laying of cables.\n\n[Pg 50]\n\nIt is obvious that the plan of mapping the sea bottom by dropping a lead at intervals over its hidden surface is far from an ideal one. The lead gives the depth only at the point at which it touches the bottom, and no information as to the space between the casts except such as may be inferred from the relation of successive soundings. In numerous cases, after what was considered a very thorough survey of a region had been made, at some later day a pinnacle rock or other danger has been discovered. For instance, a very detailed hydrographic survey of Buzzards Bay was made in 1895; the sounding lines were run at intervals of 50 to 100 yards, and 91,000 soundings were made for a single sheet. Within this area the cruiser Brooklyn in 1902 touched a rock which was found to have 18 feet over it. (Fig. 17.) The least depth in the vicinity developed in the original survey was 31 feet.\n\nFor the satisfactory development of hydrographic work some invention is much needed which as it passes along the bottom will give a continuous depth curve. Several devices have successfully accomplished this in shoal water, but great credit awaits the inventor who designs something of more general application.\n\nTides and currents. Information must be obtained as to the movement of the water, both vertical and horizontal. The rise and fall of the tide are obtained by tide gauges, either automatic, which draw a continuous tidal curve on a roll of paper, or simple tide staffs, which must be read at intervals. The currents, whether due to the tides or other movements, are measured by noting the movement of partially sub[Pg 51-55]merged floats. Less accurate but useful information as to currents is obtained from the logs of vessels.\n\nDragging for dangers has long been resorted to for the investigation of isolated spots. A valuable and successful means has been employed recently of making sure that an area is free from shoals or rocks having less than a certain depth. This is done by dragging through the water a wire from 500 to 1400 feet long, and suspended at the required depth, with suitable buoys and weights, and kept taut by the angle of pull. If, for instance, the wire is set at a depth of 30 feet it will indicate the presence of any obstruction of less depth by catching on it and upsetting the buoys, and such spots are at once marked and investigated. Considerable work has been done with such drags in the last few years on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and on the Great Lakes. This is of course a somewhat tedious process and gives no information as to depths greater than that for which the wire is set, but the experience already had indicates its great value. It will probably be found desirable in time to thus drag all water areas important to navigation where the depth is near the draft of vessels and the irregular nature of the bottom gives indication of dangers. In extensive dragging operations near Key West and in Jericho Bay, Maine, a number of shoals have been picked up which were not found in the original surveys.\n\nA remarkable instance of the value of the drag was the recent discovery of a rock in Blue Hill Bay on the coast of Maine. This rock has but 7 feet of water over it, and is only 6 feet in diameter at the top. It is surrounded by depths of 78 feet, from which it rises[Pg 56] nearly perpendicularly. The original survey gave no indication of a danger here, and its existence was not suspected until it was discovered with the wire drag.\n\nAnother method of dragging that has been employed is by means of a pipe suspended beneath a ship's bottom.\n\nMagnetic variation. As the compass is a universal navigational instrument, information as to the magnetic variation is needed for the charts. The angle between the direction of the magnetic needle and the true north is measured at various points on both land and sea, and at some stations these observations are repeated after a number of years. From these results magnetic maps are made, from which both the variation and its annual change may be taken.\n\nReports of dangers. Aside from the more systematic surveys as outlined above, much information has been placed on the charts from other sources. On the earlier charts and on those of more remote regions at the present day much of the work has been sketched rather than surveyed. Even in the better surveyed portions reports come in as to dangers or other matters not shown, and if of importance and the report appears to be reliable these are sometimes at once put on the chart pending further investigation, or in other cases an examination is first made.\n\nShoals, rocks, and even islands have in numerous instances been shown on the charts which no one has been able to find again, and many of them after repeated searches have been removed. The same island or danger has sometimes been charted in two or more different positions as reported at various[Pg 57] times. The treatment of such cases is one of the serious and interesting problems of the chart maker. It is generally less harmful to show a danger which does not exist than to omit one which does exist. On the other hand a non-existing danger shown on a chart may be the cause of actual expense and loss of time in compelling a vessel needlessly to go out of its course.\n\nIt is surprising to note with what lack of care and of sufficient evidence reports of dangers at sea have sometimes been made, and how incomplete are many of the reports even when the existence of the danger is beyond question. It is unfortunately true that some of these reports are the result of effort to escape blame for accident by throwing the fault on the chart. Many such reports also result from various illusory appearances. A large tree covered with weeds, an overturned iceberg strewn with earth and stones, a floating ice-pan covered with earth, the swollen carcass of a dead whale, a whale with clinging barnacles and seaweed, reflections from the clouds, marine animalculæ, vegetable growth, scum, floating volcanic matter, and partially submerged wrecks covered with barnacles, have been mistaken for islands, shoals, or reefs. A school of jumping fish has given the appearance of breakers or caused a sound like surf, and tide rips have been mistaken for breakers. Raper very properly calls attention to the obligation upon every seaman of carefully investigating doubtful cases and making reliable reports. \"Of the dangers to which navigation is exposed none is more formidable than a reef or a shoal in the open sea; not only from the almost certain fate of the ship and her crew that have the[Pg 58] misfortune to strike upon it, but also from the anxiety with which the navigation of all vessels, within even a long distance, must be conducted, on account of the uncertainty to which their own reckonings are ever open. No commander of a vessel, therefore, who might meet unexpectedly with any such danger, could be excused, except by urgent circumstances, from taking the necessary steps both for ascertaining its true position, and for giving a description as complete as a prudent regard to his own safety allowed.\"\n\nAs to the older doubtful dangers now shown on the oceanic charts, it is estimated that the positions may be considered as uncertain by 10 miles in latitude and 30 miles in longitude, and areas of this extent must be searched to determine definitely the question of their existence.\n\nThe following are interesting or typical cases of reported dangers:\n\nThe master of an Italian bark in September, 1874, reported sighting a large rock in latitude 40° N. and longitude 62° 18´ W. Fortunately for the charts there were two independent reports from other vessels in the same month of sighting a partially submerged wreck in this vicinity.\n\nThe Spanish steamer Carmen was wrecked in 1891 by running on a rock off the southwest coast of Leyte; the rock was reported to lie one mile off shore, a dangerous position for vessels using Canigao Channel. A survey made in 1903 showed 58 feet of water in this location, and that Carmen Rock on which the vessel struck was really within one-fourth mile of the beach. The rock had, however, for twelve years been shown on[Pg 59] the charts in a position which made it an obstruction to navigation.\n\nThe ship Minerva in 1834 was reported to have struck a rock near the middle of the broad entrance to Balayan Bay; the fact that this occurred at 2 A.M. indicated a very doubtful position, but it was stated that an American ship had previously been wrecked on the same rock. It consequently appeared as a danger on the charts for seventy-one years, when a survey showed no depth of less than 190 fathoms in this vicinity, and it was removed from the charts.\n\nA British steamer was wrecked in San Bernardino Strait in 1905; the master reported that he was in a position where the chart showed 51 fathoms, and that he was 112 miles distant from Calantas Rock, and on these grounds the finding of the official inquiry was that \"no blame can be attached to the master, officers, or any of the crew for the casualty.\" Very shortly after the disaster, the surveying steamer Pathfinder definitely located the wreck and made a survey of the vicinity. The previous chart of Calantas Reef was found to be fairly correct, and the stranding was determined to have occurred well within this reef in a position where the chart showed soundings of 334 to 434 fathoms, and 12 mile from Calantas Rock, which rises 5 feet above high water.\n\nA transport entering San Bernardino Strait a few years ago ran on a rock and was damaged; the position was reported as about two miles southeast of San Bernardino Island and near the middle of the passage. The rock was not put on the charts, as prompt investigation showed 50 fathoms of water in this vicinity, and[Pg 60] that in all probability the transport actually touched a small reef making out from the island.\n\nThe master of the brig Helen reported that his vessel was wrecked on a reef lying six miles from Rockall. When surveyed Helen Reef was found to be about one-third this distance from Rockall.\n\nAn island has been reported in eight different positions, ranging in latitude from 30° 29´ to 30° 42´ N. and in longitude from 139° 37´ to 140° 38´ E.\n\nThere have been a number of reports of islands in the area from latitude 40° 00´ to 40° 30´ N. and longitude 150° 30´ to 151° 00´ W. The master of the bark Washington reported in 1867: \"On my passage from the Sandwich Islands to the northwest coast of the United States, when in latitude 40° 00´ N., in a dense fog, I perceived the sea to be discolored. Soundings at first gave great depths, but diminished gradually to 9 fathoms, when through the mist an island was seen, along which I sailed 40 miles. It was covered with birds, and the sea swarmed with seal and sea elephants.\" A United States vessel searched in this vicinity without seeing any indication of land, and obtained soundings of 2600 fathoms. A British ship in 1858 searched for fourteen days over this area without finding anything. Searches were also made in 1860 and 1867 without success, and the present charts show no islands in this part of the Pacific.\n\nIn a number of cases erroneous positions have been due simply to blunders. Thus Lots Wife, first seen by Captain Meares in 1788, was shown on his chart in latitude 29° 50´ N., longitude 156° 00´ E., and stated in his book to be in latitude 29° 50´ N. and longitude[Pg 61] 142° 23´ E. Massachusetts Island by one report was in longitude 177° 05´ E. and by another in 167° 05´ E. The apparent blunder of 10° is now immaterial, as the island has disappeared from the charts altogether. The Knox Islands were placed by the Wilkes Exploring Expedition in latitude 5° 59´ 15´´ N., longitude 172° 02´ 33´´ E. The old British charts showed islands of this name also in latitude 5° 59´ N., longitude 172° 03´ W., the longitude being doubtless transposed. In the case of Starbuck Island, discovered south of the equator, the latitude was apparently transposed, as on old charts it was also shown in the position, latitude 5° 40´ N., longitude 156° 55´ W.\n\nA pinnacle rock can sometimes be located only with great difficulty even when known to exist. Rodger Rock, on which the bark Ellen struck and was damaged, lies in latitude 0° 41´ 15´´ N. and longitude 107° 31´ E. It has but three feet over it at low tide. The British surveying ship Rifleman searched four days before finding it, although the plotted tracks showed that she and her boats had passed very close to it. This indicates that great caution must be used in removing a reported danger from the charts.\n\nThe old charts of the Atlantic indicated a danger 30 to 45 miles to the southwest of Cape St. Vincent. This danger was omitted from the charts about 1786 owing to lack of confirmation. Later, in 1813 and 1821, it was reported that vessels were lost or damaged by striking this rock. Soundings of over a thousand fathoms are now shown on the chart in this vicinity and the rock no longer appears.\n\nA comparison of a Pacific Ocean chart of about[Pg 62] forty years ago with one of the present time (Fig. 19) illustrates in a striking manner how many doubtful dangers, or vigias, have gotten on the charts and how after laborious search many of them have now been removed. This condition was especially true of the Pacific, owing to the numerous reports of an indefinite nature from whaling ships, among whose captains there was a saying \"that they do not care where their ship is, so long as there are plenty of whales in sight.\"\n\n[Pg 63]\n\n[Pg 64-65]\n\n[Pg 66]\n\n[Pg 67]\n\nPREPARATION OF INFORMATION FOR CHARTS.\n\nChart schemes. Before commencing the preparation of a chart it is necessary to arrange a definite scheme for it, and the usefulness of the chart will depend materially on this preliminary plan, in which must be outlined its scale, size, limits, and features to be represented. New charts have sometimes been prepared simply to fit the surveys as they progressed or to fill immediate or local requirements. It is, however, desirable that general plans for series or groups of charts be made, and with changing needs, information, and conditions it is sometimes necessary that existing schemes be modified.\n\nCompilation of information. Considerable work must usually be done to get the field records in shape for the published chart. The soundings must be plotted and the characteristic depths selected. Only a part of the soundings that are made can be shown on the original sheet and only a small part of these are used on the final chart. A selection is made showing the least soundings on shoals and bars, the channel depths, and the characteristic soundings in anchorages and other areas. The original surveys are generally made on a considerably larger scale than that on which the chart is published, in order that the soundings may be more thoroughly plotted. The sheets must then be reduced to the scale of publication, and this can conveniently be done by means of photography or with a pantograph.\n\n[Pg 68]\n\nThe best judgment is required in selecting the important features to be shown on the chart and omitting the less important and not essential features which might tend to obscure the others. In charts of new regions where complete surveys are lacking, care must be exercised in weighing, combining, and adjusting information from various sources and which is, perhaps, more or less conflicting.\n\nProjections. The surface of the earth being curved, there is no possible system of projection by which it can be represented on a flat sheet of paper in an ideally satisfactory way. Numerous methods of projecting the earth's surface upon a plane have been proposed and many of them are actually used for various purposes. In general each projection has qualities which are valuable for certain uses, and deficiencies which make it less valuable in other ways. Only four of the different projections need be mentioned here as of special interest in chart construction.\n\nMercator projection. This is a rectangular projection in which the meridians are straight lines spaced at equal intervals and the parallels are straight lines so spaced as to satisfy the condition that a rhumb line, or line on the earth cutting successive meridians at the same angle, shall appear on the developed projection as a straight line preserving the same angle with respect to the meridians.\n\nThis projection may be considered as the unrolling upon a plane of the surface of a cylinder tangent to the earth along the equator, and upon which the various features of the earth's surface have been projected in such manner as to satisfy the above requirement.\n\n[Pg 69]\n\nOn this projection there is a constant distance between the meridians, whereas on the earth they actually converge toward the poles. The distance between the parallels increases in passing toward the poles, approximately in the proportion of the secant of the latitude. For each small portion of the map the relative proportions are maintained as on the earth.\n\nSome characteristics of the mercator projection are these: The meridians and parallels are all straight lines and perpendicular to each other; there is no convergence of the meridians; the minute of longitude is a constant distance on the map; the minute of latitude increases in length from the equator toward the poles but locally retains its true proportion to the minute of longitude; areas and distances increase in scale with the latitude so that a given scale is strictly correct only for one latitude; great circles and consequently lines of sight are curved lines excepting the meridians and the equator; rhumb lines or lines having a constant angle with the meridians are straight, and for the same angle are parallel in all parts of the chart. These qualities are all rigid and the projection can therefore be used for all areas, small or large, up to the extent of the earth's surface, except that it cannot be extended to the poles, as there the length of the minute of latitude would become infinite.\n\nAn interesting fact regarding a rhumb line oblique to the meridians is that it is a spiral continually approaching but never reaching the pole; this spiral makes an infinite number of revolutions around the pole, and yet it has a finite length for the reason that[Pg 70] the length of each revolution diminishes as the number of revolutions increases.\n\nThe mercator projection has been extensively used for nautical charts, for which it presents important mechanical advantages, in that adjacent charts can be joined on all their edges while still oriented with the meridian; all charts are similar; the border may be conveniently subdivided, giving a longitude scale applicable to any part of the chart, but a latitude scale that may be used in the same latitude only; courses are laid down as straight lines and can be transferred with parallel rulers from one part of the chart to another without error. On a mercator chart an island in latitude 60° would appear four times as large as an island of the same actual area at the equator, but this distortion of areas, while it gives erroneous impressions on charts of great extent in latitude, does not seriously affect the use of the chart for nautical purposes. Areas may also be correctly measured on a mercator map by taking each projection quadrilateral separately, subdividing it if necessary, and using the published tables of areas of quadrilaterals in different latitudes. Although distance scales vary with the latitude, distances can be taken from this chart with fair correctness by the use of the latitude border scale for the middle latitude, subdividing the total distance if there is much range of latitude. The inability to take off the great circle or shortest course directly from the mercator chart is from a navigational point of view a defect, but the most convenient solution for this appears to be the supplementary use of a gnomonic chart as will be described. The fact that lines of sight are not[Pg 71-73] straight lines on this projection is another defect, as by the plotting of bearings and angles on approaching the land the positions of vessels are located on the chart; fortunately, however, the error due to this cause usually falls within the other uncertainties involved in locating a ship; if need be it would be practicable to allow for this curvature. In the polar regions, however, the faults of the mercator projection become so much exaggerated that it is not used for navigational purposes, but because of the absence of commercial navigation there this is a minor matter in the general question of chart projection. For the plotting of original surveys the mercator projection is not suited and is not used, for the reasons above mentioned.\n\nTables of \"meridional parts\" are published which give the distance in terms of minutes of longitude from the equator to the various parallels; with these tables a mercator projection may readily be constructed.\n\nAiry proposed a graphical method of sweeping the arc of a great circle on to a mercator chart, and tables are published for this purpose. The method is only approximate and is limited in application, and the supplementary use of a gnomonic chart would appear to be preferable.\n\nPolyconic projection. In plotting the original surveys it is essential that a projection be used which will for the area included on a survey sheet show the points in their correct relation both as to direction and distance. These conditions are substantially fulfilled by several projections, of which the polyconic is used in the United States. If a hollow cone were placed so that it would either be tangent to the earth's surface along[Pg 74] one of the parallels of latitude or cut it along two parallels, and the points projected on to this cone, and the cone then unrolled and laid out flat, the result would be a conical projection, of which there are several variations. If successive tangent cones be used and each parallel of latitude be developed as the circumference of the base of a right cone tangent to the spheroid along that parallel, the result is the polyconic projection, which has been used for field sheets and for the large scale charts, as well as for the topographic maps of the United States. This projection has valuable qualities for moderate areas of the earth's surface, within which the scale is approximately uniform, areas retain nearly their true proportions, and great circles and consequently all bearings and directions are approximately straight lines. The parallels of latitude are arcs of circles with radiuses increasing as we recede from the pole; therefore they are not truly parallel and the length of the degree of latitude increases either side from the central meridian. The meridians converge toward the poles and become slightly curved as we recede from the central one; the longitude scale is everywhere correct, but the latitude scale is strictly correct only on the central meridian. The angles of intersection of parallels and meridians are right angles or nearly so. The polyconic projection is not used for very extensive areas of the earth's surface, as for instance a hemisphere.\n\nGnomonic projection. In this projection the eye is assumed to be at the center of the earth and the features are projected upon a plane tangent to some point on the earth's surface. It is practicable to use this projection for oceanic areas, and it has the very important[Pg 75-79] quality that every straight line on it represents a great circle of the earth. To obtain the great circle or shortest course between two points it is therefore only necessary to draw a straight line between the points on a gnomonic chart. Because of the great distortion near the edges this projection is not otherwise adapted to navigational use, and it is employed only to mark out the general course, and sufficient points are then transferred to a mercator chart. The gnomonic chart is therefore useful in supplementing the mercator chart, supplying its deficiencies as to convenience in marking out great circle courses. The great circle course can be derived not only more easily and quickly from the gnomonic chart than by computation, but the chart is also to be preferred because the course marked out on it will show at once if any obstruction, as an island or danger, is met or too high a latitude is reached. A modified or composite course can readily be laid out on a gnomonic chart.\n\nArbitrary projection. The few charts published of the polar regions are sometimes on an arbitrary projection, in which the meridians are straight lines radiating from the pole and the parallels are equidistant circles with the pole as center. The latitude scale is uniform. At some distance from the pole the longitude scale becomes very much distorted, but the projection is a practicable and convenient one for the immediate polar regions. Gnomonic and conical projections are also used for the polar charts, differing little from the foregoing for moderate areas.\n\nScales. Charts are published on a variety of scales to suit different needs of navigation, and the usual[Pg 80] classification depends on scale. In addition to the ocean charts covering a single ocean in either one or several sheets and intended for navigation on the high seas, there are for our Atlantic coast the following series:\n\nSailing charts, scale about 11200000, for general coastwise navigation.\n\nGeneral coast charts, scale 1400000, for local coastwise navigation.\n\nCoast charts, scale 180000, for approaching the coast at any point and for inside passages.\n\nHarbor and channel charts, of various large scales from 15000 to 160000, for entering harbors and rivers and passing through channels.\n\nThe expression of scales by miles to the inch or inches to the mile is the more familiar. The expression of scale in the manner used by the Coast Survey and by most of the European countries, by standard fractions as 180000, meaning that any distance on the chart is 180000 of the actual distance on the earth, has some advantages. For instance, the relation of these fractions gives at a glance the relation of the scales of the charts. Thus a 180000 chart is on a scale five times as large as a 1400000 chart.\n\nFor the more important harbors charts have been published on several different scales to meet various needs. Thus New York Harbor is shown on charts of scales of 110000, 140000, 180000, 1200000, 1400000 and 11200000, each of course including a different area.\n\nThe selection of suitable publication scales is of prime importance; a large scale permits of greater clearness and of showing more detail, but on the other hand restricts the area and the points that can be shown[Pg 81-83] on a single sheet, or else makes a chart of excessive dimensions. In general in chart preparation the scale should be restricted to the minimum that can be used to fulfill the particular object and clearly represent what is desired. A chart of very large scale is not convenient for plotting, and a moving vessel may pass quickly beyond it or into range of objects beyond the limits of the chart.\n\n[Pg 84]\n\nPUBLICATION OF CHARTS.\n\nMethods of publication. An ideal process of publication for nautical charts would include the following features; rapidity in getting out new charts, facility in reprinting and correcting existing charts, clearness and sharpness of print, durability of paper and print, and correctness of scale. It is difficult to fulfill all these requirements by any method as yet developed. In the Coast and Geodetic Survey several different processes are in use at present; charts are engraved on copper and printed directly from the copper plate, or they are transferred from the copper plate to stone and printed from the stone, or a finished drawing is made and transferred to stone by photolithography and printed from the stone, or an etching is made on copper from a finished drawing and printed from a transfer to stone. Charts in other countries are in large part printed from engraved plates, excepting some preliminary charts by lithography.\n\nCopper plate engraving and printing have long been used in chart preparation. A drawing is prepared as a guide for the engraver; this must be correct as to all information to be shown but need not be a finished drawing. A true projection is ruled upon a copper plate. By photography a matrix is made from the drawing and a wax impression taken from this matrix. This is then laid down on the copper to fit the projection, and the impression is chemically fixed on to the copper.[Pg 85-89] The work thus marked out is engraved by hand or by machine. A high degree of skill is required in the accuracy and finish necessary for chart engraving. Machines have been invented in recent years which can be used for portions of the work on copper plates, as for instance for cutting the sounding figures, the bottom characteristics, the border and projection lines, border divisions, compasses, line ruling, and stipple ruling. Stamps and dies have been successfully used for some symbols and notes, and roulettes for shading. By means of these various machines, many of which are American inventions, the process of chart publication from plates has been materially facilitated.\n\nWhen the plate is completed an alto, or raised copy, is made by depositing copper on to it in an electrotype vat, and from this alto another basso or sunken copy is made by the same process. This latter basso is used in printing. A copper plate may be used for about 3000 impressions, after which it may become too much worn for satisfactory chart printing. By printing from a duplicate basso the original plate is preserved and additional copies can be made when needed. The use of the alto also greatly facilitates matters when a considerable correction to the chart is required. All the portions of the chart to be changed can be scraped off the alto, and when a new basso is electrotyped from this scraped alto all such areas will of course appear as smooth copper, on which the new work can be engraved. Numerous small corrections are called for on charts, and on copper plates where these are to replace old work the latter is removed either by hammering up the back of the plate or by scraping its face.\n\n[Pg 90]\n\nPrinting directly from plates is a laborious process. After the press bed has been carefully padded to take up inequalities in the plate, the surface of the latter is covered with ink and then carefully wiped off by hand, leaving the ink only in the engraved lines. The paper, first dampened, is laid on the plate, and passes with it beneath the cylinder of the press under considerable pressure. The prints are calendered by being placed in a hydraulic press under 600 tons pressure. The charts are beautifully clear and sharp, not equalled by other methods of printing. Owing to the wetting and drying of the paper, the finished print is, however, quite appreciably smaller in scale than the plate, and the shrinkage is greater in one direction than in the other. The average day's work for one press and two men is 75 prints. This is small compared with the output practicable with lithographic presses. On the other hand a plate can be prepared for printing more readily than a lithographic stone. For small editions the plate printing compares well in economy with lithographic printing, and the plate can also be printed on short notice. Because of changes in aids to navigation and other corrections, it is usually desirable to print at one time only a sufficient number of copies of a chart to meet current demands, and not to carry a large stock on hand.\n\nThe copper plates, bassos, and altos make a very convenient and enduring means of preserving the chart ready for printing or for further correction. A large number of plates can be placed in a small space, and if properly cared for they may be stored indefinitely without deterioration.\n\n[Pg 91-93]\n\nWith plate printing it is not practicable to print more than one impression on the chart or to use more than one color, and plate-printed charts are therefore in black only.\n\nEngraving on stone. On the United States Lake Survey the charts are first engraved on stone, and by a special process the work is then transferred to small copper plates, which are preserved. The final publication is by lithography, transferring again from the plates to stone.\n\nPhotolithography is a quick method of publishing a chart. It would be practicable by this means to reproduce the original survey sheets, but ordinarily these are not suitable as to scale and legibility, and it is necessary to make a new drawing, usually on tracing vellum. This is photographed on to glass plates, on the scale of the proposed chart. From these glass negatives positive prints are made on sensitized lithographic paper. These prints are fitted together and then inked, taking the ink only where the lines appear. This transfer print is then laid face down on the lithographic stone and run through a press under pressure, the stone absorbing the ink from the paper. The stone is then treated so that the inked portion remains slightly raised, and from this stone an indefinite number of charts can be printed in a lithographic press at the rate of 1000 an hour. The paper is not moistened, and consequently there is little distortion or change of scale in prints from stone. If desired to shade the land or use another color for any other purpose, additional impressions can be made on the same charts from other stones. Because of the bulk[Pg 94] of the stones, work cannot ordinarily be retained on them, but the chart is cleaned off and the stones repeatedly used until worn thin. The original drawing as well as the negatives is preserved, from which the chart can again be published. For republication, the process is, however, not entirely satisfactory; the negatives are not always permanent, the work must again be assembled and transferred to the stone, changes or corrections are not very conveniently made on either drawing or negative, and after repeated changes the drawing becomes difficult to use in photolithography. Whether the charts are actually printed from copper or stone, there are decided advantages therefore in the matter of correction work and future editions in having the charts engraved on copper. On the other hand, the advantages of the photolithographic process are the ability to publish new drawings promptly, to use more than one shade on a chart, to obtain prints with little change of scale or distortion, and to print large editions rapidly.\n\nLithographic printing by transfer from engraved plates. An impression on transfer paper may be taken from an engraved plate and this laid down on the stone in a manner similar to that used in laying down the prints from the glass negatives in photolithography. Prints are then made from the stone the same as in photolithography, but with superior results as to clearness. This general process is extensively used in both map and chart publishing in this country, as it combines the advantages of the plate in preservation of the chart record and facility of correction, and the advantages of the lithographic printing in less distortion[Pg 95] of the printed chart, ability to print more than one shade, and facility for large editions. As the transfer from the plate can be readily made it is also better applicable to small editions than is photolithography. It is, however, not as convenient in the latter respect as plate printing, and it does not give a resulting impression equal in clearness or durability to the impression directly from the plate.\n\nEtching on copper for chart publication has been recently developed in the Coast and Geodetic Survey. A finished tracing is made, the surface of a smooth copper plate is sensitized, and by exposure to the sun a print is made on the sensitized surface. It is essential to use an air-exhausted printing frame so as to get good contact between the vellum and the plate. The work is then etched into the copper and the plate cleaned and touched up, after which it may be used the same as a hand-engraved plate, either for transfer to stone or direct plate printing. The expense and time required in the etching process are much less than for hand engraving. The process has been successfully used for a number of harbor charts. The etching of course will be of the same scale as the vellum at the time of the print, and vellum varies somewhat in scale with weather conditions and age. Unless overcome by the substitution of some more invariable material in place of vellum, this might be an obstacle to the use of the process for general charts where a true scale on the copper plate is desirable because of future work to be done on the plate. It must also be taken into account that the etching requires a finished tracing in ink, which is not essential for the hand engraver; if, however,[Pg 96] the chart is first published by photolithography, as is the usual practice in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the same tracing is used for both processes.\n\nDistribution of charts. Charts published by the government are sold to the public at a small price, estimated to cover the cost of paper and printing. The charts may be obtained direct from the publishing office or from the chart agents who are to be found in all the principal seaports. Catalogues are published from time to time giving complete lists of the current charts and the main facts regarding them. Index maps show graphically the area covered by each chart. The notices to mariners contain announcement of new charts or new editions published and of charts or editions cancelled, as well as of all corrections.\n\n[Pg 97]\n\nCORRECTION OF CHARTS.\n\nNeed for revision. The making of the survey and the printing of the chart do not complete the problem of the chart maker. Both nature and man are constantly changing the facts the representation of which has been attempted on the charts, and also the needs of man are always varying. The original surveys are made to meet the reasonable requirements of the time, but breakwaters and jetties are built, and channels and harbors dredged and otherwise improved, and cities built, and new paths of commerce are opened which bring vessels into waters previously thought of minor importance.\n\nWith the increase of commerce and speed of vessels more direct routes are demanded for reasons of economy. Inside routes not originally used are sometimes developed for defensive reasons. The average draft of the larger vessels has also increased remarkably since the modern hydrographic surveys were commenced, and surveys once made to insure safety for the deepest vessels of that time are now not adequate. The average loaded draft of the 20 largest steamships of the world has increased as follows: 1848, 19 feet; 1873, 24 feet; 1898, 29 feet; 1903, 32 feet. The average length of these vessels was 230 feet in 1848, 390 feet in 1873, 541 feet in 1898, and 640 feet in 1903. The number of vessels drawing as much as 2614 feet rose from 36 in 1902 to 185 in 1904. In 1906 there were 17 vessels[Pg 98] afloat, drawing 32 feet and upwards. There are now two steamers on the Atlantic 790 feet long, 88 feet beam, and 3712 feet draft when fully loaded, and larger vessels are already planned.\n\nGreat natural agencies are also constantly at work effecting changes in features shown on the charts. The action of currents and waves is continually cutting away or building the shore, particularly on sandy coasts exposed to storms. When surveyed in 1849 Fishing Point on the east coast of Maryland was but a bend in the shore line. By 1887 it had built out about two miles in a southerly direction, and in 1902 about two-thirds of a mile further, curving to the westward. Altogether in about half a century this tongue of land has grown out nearly three miles.\n\nRivers are bearing vast quantities of sediment and depositing these near their mouths, pushing out the coast line and filling in the bottom. The main mouths of the Mississippi are advancing into the Gulf, but at a comparatively slow rate. A break from the main river at Cubit's Gap just above the head of the passes, however, has done an enormous amount of land making, filling in an area of about 50 square miles between 1852 and 1905.\n\nThe mouth of the Columbia River in Oregon shows an interesting example of the movement of an island. The chart of 1851 shows the center of Sand Island 314 miles southeast of Cape Disappointment, the chart of 1870 shows it 234 miles southeast, and the chart of 1905 shows it 114 miles easterly. This island has thus moved 2 miles northwesterly directly across the middle of the river entrance, closing up the former[Pg 99-109] north channel. The southern point of the entrance, Clatsop Spit, has built out about the same distance.\n\nVolcanic action in well authenticated cases has caused islands to rise or disappear. In the present location of Bogoslof Island in Bering Sea the early voyagers described a \"sail rock.\" In this position in 1796 there arose a high island. In 1883 another island appeared near it. In 1906 a high cone arose between the two, and a continuous island was formed over 112 miles long and 500 feet high. The latest report (September, 1907) was that this central peak had suddenly collapsed and disappeared. Bogoslof is an active volcano, and the main changes have been the result of violent volcanic action. The history of this island for over a century past forms a remarkable record of violent transformations in the sea.\n\nEarthquakes sometimes cause sudden displacements, horizontal or vertical, of sufficient amount to affect the information shown on the charts. A careful investigation of the effects of the earthquake in Yakutat Bay, Alaska, in September, 1899, showed that the shore was raised in some parts with a maximum uplift of 47 feet and depressed in other parts, and that at least two reefs and four islets were raised in the water area where none appeared before. Undoubtedly there were changes in the water depths, but definite information is lacking because there had been no previous hydrographic survey. The San Francisco earthquake of 1906 caused little vertical displacement, but there were horizontal changes of relative position as much as 16 feet; so far as known this earthquake did not affect the practical accuracy of the charts. Related[Pg 110] to earthquake phenomena are the gradual coast movements of elevation or subsidence which are taking place but at so slow a rate as not to sensibly affect the charts in ordinary intervals of time.\n\nAnother agency at work is the coral polyp on the coral reefs; although the rate of growth appears to be very slow, the resulting reefs and keys are an important feature in tropical seas.\n\nPractically all of the land features shown on charts are likewise subject to changes, the more rapid of which are mainly due to the works of man.\n\nThe changes of channels and of commercial needs cause many alterations to be made from time to time in the lights and buoys which are shown on the charts.\n\nMethods of correction. The problem of keeping a chart sufficiently up to date is one of much practical importance and one which must be taken into account in planning what should be shown on the chart in the first place so as to bring it within the range of practicable revision.\n\nCertain features are corrected at once on the charts as soon as the information is received, such as dangers reported, and changes in lights and buoys. Where harbor works are in progress the periodic surveys made in this country by the Corps of Engineers furnish data which are applied promptly to the charts. Reported dangers in channels and bars are investigated by special surveys and the information is put on the charts. Examinations are made from time to time for the revision of the features along the coast line. Complete resurveys have been made, at long intervals, of some important portions of the coast where there has been[Pg 111] evidence of change, and these, when they become available, are applied to the charts. All parts of the coast where the exposed portions are not of very permanent material will require resurveys at intervals, depending on their importance and the rate of change.\n\nNotwithstanding the great progress made in hydrographic surveys, a considerable number of rocks and shoals dangerous to navigation and not previously shown on the charts are reported, averaging nearly 400 each year for the last six years, according to the British reports. Of the 367 reported in 1906, 11 were discovered by vessels striking them.\n\nImmediate information in the form of Notices to Mariners is published, of the more important corrections to charts which can be made by hand. These corrections show what charts are affected, and give sufficient data for plotting.\n\nIn the case of extensive corrections or new surveys a new edition of the chart is printed and all existing copies of the previous edition are canceled.\n\nIt is important that the user of the chart shall make certain that he has the latest edition and that all corrections from its date of issue have been applied from the Notices to Mariners.\n\nIt is unfortunately true that owing to failure to take proper account of the notices, or to economy, old editions or unconnected charts are sometimes used, and in a number of cases the loss of vessels has been directly due to this cause. Those responsible for the safe navigation of vessels should insist that the latest editions of charts are provided and that all charts to be used are inspected and corrected to date.\n\n[Pg 112]\n\nREADING AND USING CHARTS.\n\nReading charts. A chart is a representation on paper of hydrographic and topographic information by means of various conventional methods and symbols. It is evidently important for those making use of charts to understand the system and conventions used, and to be able to interpret readily the various parts of the chart. The ability to read a chart must include an understanding of all its features, such as scale, projection, geographic position, directions, depths, plane of reference, aids to navigation, tides, currents, elevations, topography, and date of survey and publication.\n\nScale. For American and British charts the scale is usually expressed by the inches or fractions of an inch to the minute or degree of latitude, or by the fractional proportion of a distance on the map to the corresponding distance on the earth. These fractions are sometimes stated on the British charts, and nearly always on those of the United States Coast Survey. The chart catalogues give the scale in one or the other form. A familiarity with the meaning of scales is of value in selecting the most suitable chart, in judging of the relative uses of charts, and in estimating distances. Where the fractional scales are stated they furnish a simple means of comparing charts, as, for instance, a chart on 150000 scale will show all distances just twice as long as a chart on 1100000 scale.\n\n[Pg 113]\n\nThe following are scale equivalents:\n\nFor use in measuring distances on large scale charts the length of one or more nautical miles is usually drawn on the chart, and sometimes scales are also given in other units. On British charts the nautical mile scale is divided into tenths (that is, cables of 100 fathoms or 600 feet length); on the American charts into quarters and eighths. Where the scale covers more than one mile the fractional divisions are shown only for the left-hand mile and the zero of the scale is placed between this and the full mile scale, so that with dividers the full miles and fraction may readily be taken off. The nautical mile in the United States is taken to be the length of a minute of arc of a great circle on a sphere whose surface equals that of the earth; this definition makes the nautical mile equal 6080.27 feet. Lecky adopts 6080 feet as the nautical mile. The length of the actual minute of latitude on the earth's surface increases from 6046 feet at the equator to 6108 feet at the poles, an increase of about one per cent. It is, however, this somewhat variable unit of length which[Pg 114] is ordinarily used in scaling distances on the sailing charts.\n\nOn small scale charts there is usually a border scale entirely around the chart, conveniently subdivided; this serves the double purpose of facilitating the plotting or reading of positions by latitude and longitude and of furnishing a scale of minutes of latitude for use in measuring distances. On a mercator chart this scale of course varies with the latitude and it must be referred to in the mean latitude of the distance to be measured. In general practice the minute of latitude is taken as equal to the nautical mile.\n\nProjection. On only a few charts is there a statement of the projection used. Practically all general sailing charts are on the mercator projection, which can be readily recognized by the rectangular network of meridians and parallels and the increase with latitude of the distance between the parallels. On large scale local and harbor charts the kind of projection used is not of importance to navigation, as for such limited areas the difference between projections would not affect the use of the chart. On certain small scale charts of the United States Coast Survey which are on the polyconic projection this fact is stated on the chart, and can also be readily recognized by the convergence of the meridians and curvature of the parallels. Gnomonic charts intended for taking off great circle courses are always described in their titles and are also easily recognized by the increased scale and distortion toward all the borders. Charts of the polar regions are published on several different projections, which are distinguished from the mercator by their circular or curved parallels.\n\n[Pg 115]\n\nGeographic position. For large scale and harbor charts the latitude and longitude of some point marked on the chart are sometimes stated on the face of the chart. For others of these, however, and for smaller scale and general charts, positions are obtained by reference to the border scale. There is a latitude scale down either side of the chart, and a longitude scale across the top and bottom. These scales are conveniently subdivided into degrees, minutes, or fractions of a minute. The minute is divided into tenths (6´´), sixths (10´´), quarters (15´´), or halves (30´´) on various charts.\n\nDirections are indicated on charts both by the projection lines and by compass roses. Nearly all charts are now oriented with the meridian, that is, north is the top of the chart, and on a mercator chart the east and west border lines are parallel with the meridians and the north and south border lines with the parallels. Formerly many charts were not so oriented. Some of these are still in use and can readily be recognized by the diagonal or inclined direction of the projection lines with respect to the border of the chart. Of course directions must not be referred to the border lines of these diagonal charts, and scales along such border lines must not be used. Directions with respect to true north may always be referred to the projection lines of the chart, but on a polyconic or polar chart a direction must not be carried so far from any projection line as to introduce error on account of convergence of the meridians. Compass roses are placed on charts to facilitate the taking off or laying down of directions, though in some respects their use is less accurate and[Pg 116] convenient than the use of protractors, referring to the projection lines. The British charts and many of those of the United States Coast Survey have only magnetic compasses, with degrees outside and points inside, the former gra"
