        "text": "No Power Tower match-up was shown in the first qualifiers episode. The top two finishers, Tyler Gillett and Jody Avila, should have competed for the right to bring their teammates to the semifinals. However, after the final competitor finished the course, the final leaderboard was shown and the episode concluded. The Power Tower was never mentioned in the entire episode, and no explanation was given by the broadcaster.\n\nAfter the episode was aired, it was confirmed that the reason for the Power Tower match-up not being shown is because it involved Drew Drechsel, who was edited out of the season due to NBC and A. Smith & Co permanently cutting ties with him. Likely for this reason, the producers chose to air this particular qualifiers episode first, as it would be awkward to show the Power Tower in one week, but not in subsequent weeks. Drechsel and Avila both competed on the Power Tower, and inside sources confirmed that Jody Avila won, while also confirming Taylor Johnson and Julius Ferguson were Drechsel's teammates (both formerly worked at his gym).\n\nDrechsel's teammates were shown during the episode. However, their runs were digested and the sideline was not shown. Both of them advanced to the semifinals, as Ferguson finished and placed 5th, and Johnson failed on the Slingshot but was 2nd among the women. So, a win by Drechsel on the Power Tower would not have changed anything (but since Avila won, his two teammates, who both failed on Weight for It, advanced)."
