        "text": "ECON330\n\nExpecting a B+\n\nAnonymous\n\n05/24/2024 In my opinion, the lectures were insanely boring after one point. He just uses the Pearson Slides which regurgitate information from the textbook. The material for the midterm is quite easy (bonds, macroeconomics, supply & demand) and the material for the final is all policy based which was harder to apply. The final is weighted so heavily that it can tank your grade so if anything, make sure you do well on the final. He curves a little and the homeworks are useful, but I didn't learn anything from this class. Thomas Drechsel\n\nECON330\n\nAnonymous\n\n05/20/2024 He is not a kind professor. Cutoffs for grades make no sense. He makes it very hard to get an A while giving B students a huge boost. His grade distribution is unkind to students who are actually doing good. He also gets snappy when you asks questions. Thomas Drechsel\n\nECON330\n\nExpecting an A-\n\nAnonymous\n\n05/20/2024 Tell me how I got 95 on the midterm 90 on the final and have a 94.86% in the class but is getting an A- because of his distribution model. Terrible. Thomas Drechsel\n\nECON330\n\nExpecting an A-\n\npierogi\n\n12/20/2023 Drechsel is pretty great. Very nice guy, on the younger side and does not seem jaded like many other professors. He really cares about the subject, which makes paying attention easier. I can't say I find the topics super interesting myself, but I do feel like I learned a decent amount thanks to his passion for the class. There were 8 homeworks, all ~20 questions, mostly multiple choice (we got 2 tries). Mid-term and final were 1 hour each, online, open-note. Thomas Drechsel\n\nECON330\n\nExpecting an A\n\nAnonymous\n\n05/23/2022 Drechsel is a reasonable and kind professor. This class has weekly, multiple-choice homework assignment (40% of your grade), a midterm exam (20% of your grade), and a non-cumulative final (40% of your grade). The exams are online, open-note, and 60 minutes long. There are two lectures each week and he said attendance is optional because he only covers content that is in the textbook. However, it is important to read the textbook and go to class. In class, he covers content from the chapter that is most important. I would recommend reading and taking notes on the chapter covered BEFORE coming to class. The questions on the midterm exam were VERY similar to the math problems in the homework. I would recommend creating a formula sheet and knowing how to do every math-related problem on the previous homework assignments. The midterm had a low average, so it was curved and he made changes to the final. Before the final, he told us exactly what we needed to know. Focus on the graphs and understand the shifts and you will do well. Again, it's very helpful to go through the previous homework assignments. If he is teaching this class, take it!! Don't wait a semester and get stuck with Copelman. Thomas Drechsel\n\nECON330\n\nExpecting an A\n\nAnonymous\n\n05/17/2022 Make sure to actually show up to the lectures and listen to the information he is telling you. If you just do the HWs and never show up to lecture the exams are going to be extremely difficult for you. Lectures can be boring but if you commit to them it shouldn't be that hard to get an A. Thomas Drechsel\n\nECON330\n\nAnonymous\n\n04/27/2022 ECON330 homework is pretty easy. It makes up 40 percent of your final grade so you can easily get your grade to a point you won't fail(not to mention Dreschel drops the lowest homework & you have 2-4 attempts depending on the question). The Midterm(which makes up 20%) isn't anything like the homework. It is much more challenging and nearly impossible under the time constraints. Due to a lot of complaints from students, the professor had to boost everyone's grade by some points. I have yet to see how the final(which makes up 40%) will be. Overall though, Dreschel is a pretty nice guy that's really knowledgeable of what he is teaching. This was his first time at UMD so I'll cut him some slack. He makes the class structure quite organized so I appreciate that. He makes all his slides available online and it's fairly easy to catch up if you fall behind in the class. Just be sure to read the textbook. The only reason I'm not giving him 5 stars is because he is not necessarily outstanding or spectacular- he is simply above average."
