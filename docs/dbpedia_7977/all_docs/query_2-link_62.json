Thomas Banham, who was 18 at the time of the incident, was testifying iMonday in New Westminster county court at the trial of Const. Joseph Mercier charged with assault causing bodily harm while arresting Banham. Under questioning by Crown counsel David Crossin, Banham said he had attempted to open the door when Mercier and Const. Thomas Drechsel came to the suite after being called by apartment managers on the night of April 28, 1987 .\n\nHe said there was a security chain attached and it would only open part \"They had stuck their billyclubs through the opening and were trying to wedge the door open,\" said Banham. \"I told them to take their clubs out and I would open the door. The billyclubs were withdrawn and as soon as the chain was off, the door came flying open,\" he said. Banham said Drechsel went into the apartment while Mercier stayed at the door. Banham said he complained that the police couldn't come barging in without a search warrant and Mer cier asked him if he thought he was \"a smart-ass lawyer .\n\nHe said he let go of the door and was about to go and see his sister, who was renting the apartment, when \"all of a sudden the door came flying open and he (Mercier) came straight at me and put two hands around my neck. He said he was pushed into the bathroom where Mercier struck him in the face, then hit him in the stom ach, grabbed his hair and dragged him to the floor. The trial continues.

Meg Jacksort, a spokesman for B.C.'s chief coroner, Vince Cain, said Ree ordered the inquest because of Sorenson's dissatisfaction with the information revealed at a coroner's inquiry .\n\nThe inquest will begin July 4, and is expected to take five days in Burnaby coroner's court. Coinciden-tally, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses will be gathering in Vancouver at the same time for their national convention.

Keuter PARIS The crowned heads of Europe are shunning the 200th anniversary celebrations of the revolution which overthrew the French monarchy .\n\nNone of the reigning monarchs will be at a giant party in Paris next month when France celebrates its 1789 Revolution, the violent political and social upheaval that undermined the authority of kings and queens. Many of today's European royal families are related to Louis XVI, who was executed on the guillotine in 1793. Britain will be represented by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. She is due to watch the Bastille parade with six major western government leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and U.S. President George Bush, because as the bicentenary reaches its climax on July 14, the annual summit of the Group of Seven industrial democracies starts simultaneously in Paris .\n\nAfrica, where France has strong ties, will send the strongest continental delegation with 10 heads of state. But its leading monarch and an influential friend of France, King Hassan of Morocco, will not be among them. UU 123189 mm This Father's Day let Dad relax in a -comfortable easy-care, striped t-shirt.
