On Tuesday we put normal operations at Skyllful on pause to allow our team to experience a day in the life of the #frontline roles we support. We split the team into four groups and sent them out into a variety of real-world scenarios to gain a better understanding of a critical user personal for our platform (generally, frontline workers). Our team got to see behind the scenes of: - Food/beverage distribution - Retail (teleco) - Technology field services - Retail (grocery) On Wednesday all four teams presented their trip reports to the broader group sharing their observations and insights and answering questions. I think I had permagrin the entire day. 😊 One of my favorite moments was when the retail grocery team and the F&B distribution team connected the dots - one was delivering to the other - so the team could compare and contrast the scenario from both perspectives. I'd love to report that I had planned this. Serendipity is a thing. Our team is made up of amazing people in their first professional role all the way up to.... well, let's just say a few more years than that. Everyone learned something. And Skyllful is a better company today than we were last week as a result. We started this company because we realized that most corporate learning and digital adoption tools are focused on knowledge workers working on a laptop. Yet, the overwhelming majority of the workforce is deskless. 🙄 As you push more tech capabilities to the edge of your workforce, your learning and digital adoption tools need to get to the edge as well. The Skyllful team continues to learn and innovate and close the gap. We are connecting the disconnected! A very special thanks to the business leaders who provided Skyllful and our team with access to your operations for the day. We could not have done this without your support and we are eternally grateful. You're certainly welcome to weigh in, but I don't feel it's my place to share proper names in this case.\n\nEmbarking on my journey at Kidzink has been nothing short of an exhilarating rollercoaster, where each twist and turn unveils a new facet of creativity and innovation. No hyperbole here – no two days at Kidzink will ever dance to the same rhythm. In fact, they scream, \"Expect the unexpected!\" Kidzink isn't just a workplace; it's a haven for dreamers and ideators like me, a realm where our visions sprout wings and take flight. The recognition bestowed upon us as the Most Innovative Company – Education, Middle East by the prestigious FastCompany. We wear it like a crown, knowing we've earned every jewel embedded in it. In the ever-evolving landscape of Kidzink, creativity is not a destination; it's a journey – one that promises to be as mind-expanding as the cosmos itself. So, fasten your seatbelts, because 2024 is poised to be another chapter in the extraordinary saga of Kidzink. Watch this space, for the canvas of our imagination knows no bounds, and the masterpiece is yet to unfold!"
