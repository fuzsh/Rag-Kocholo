        "text": "France (1943) Dir. Henri-Georges Clouzot\n\nIn a small town doctor Rémy Germain (Pierre Fresnay) is the subject of a number of poison pen letters circulated among the townsfolk, suggesting he is having an affair with Laura Vorzet (Micheline Francey), the young wife of an elderly psychiatrist Dr. Vorzet (Pierre Larquey) and accusing him of performing illegal abortions. The letters are signed by “Le Corbeau” aka “The Raven” who seems to have their finger on the pulse of the town’s goings on and finding the culprit is going to be huge task for Germain and the other townsfolk who are quick to turn on each other as more incriminating letters are delivered.\n\nLe Corbeau was a pivotal film in the career of legendary French auteur Henri-Georges Clouzot for a number of unfortunate reasons. First and foremost Clouzot managed to raise the ire of the French establishment which resulted in a life time ban from filmmaking for Clouzot. Made during German occupied France, and due to a lack of money, Clouzot found himself working for the German run film company Continental, which didn’t sit well with many French people. Then it was perceived by the right wing French government, the left wing French resistance party and the Catholic Church pro-Nazi propaganda and an unfair portrayal of the French people. To us watching this now these accusations sound incredulous but for the time they had some significance as it is reported that some French people would indulge in such calumny against friends and foes while under German oppression. The film was actually a great success, and thankfully cooler heads prevailed in post war France, leading to Clouzot’s life time ban being reduced to just two years.\n\nThe plot is based on a real life incident in 1922 surrounding the death of a four year old child where even the child’s mother was suspected of writing the mysterious letters claiming culpability of this crime. The nearest we get to such a heinous crime in this film is when a hospital patient of Germain’s is told by The Raven then he has terminal cancer and promptly kills himself with a straight razor. Since the patient always received short shrift from officious nurse Marie Corbin (Héléna Manson), a note hidden inside a wreath by the Raven detailing her rough treatment of the patient puts her in the frame of murder. Otherwise Germain is the key target for these menacing missives which aren’t without some foundation, seeing as the good doctor is fraternising with hypochondriac and local bike Denise Saillens (Ginette Leclerc) which raises a few eye brows.\n\nThe cast is plentiful and soon the divisive methods of The Raven are being picked up via osmosis and people with secrets or hidden desires stoop to low levels to keep this hidden or rid themselves of prospective competition in the loves takes. Thus the identity of The Raven becomes a genuine headscratcher for the police and Germain to discern with his/her influence on the townsfolk’s behaviour continues to cloud their progress. And here is where Clouzot comes into his own, lining up various candidates for the role of antagonist for us to suspect and invariably get wrong. This may be a few years before Clouzot hit his stride with the seminal Les Diaboliques but there is no mistaking the clever misdirection and endless twists that teases us right up to the closing frame which became on of his trademarks.\n\nAt a tidy 87 minutes Clouzot accepts the challenge of telling this dark and spiralling story without losing any of its integrity, tension and intrigue. We even get a decent reading of the main characters allowing us to make mental notes as to why they should be a suspect for the role of The Raven. With Germain being the proverbial fire from which The Raven’s smoke accusations lies some moral issues to ponder, namely the abortions he is supposed to have performed. A last minute admission puts him in a bad light but no-one bothers to ask for his rationale which puts a different spin on things, highlighting the small mindedness of a tight knit community. Clouzot has shown a fondness for keeping his locations tight and restrictive and this provincial haven of finger pointing busybodies and two faced gossips is no different. Indeed as the end comes near for The Raven one can almost feel the town contracting inwards around Germain and the rest of the inhabitants.\n\nPeople are petty, envious, judgemental, vengeful, selfish and vindictive which Clouzot is exploring here. While not holding up the same introspective mirror as the Neo realists of Italy like Vittorio de Sica, Clouzot does put the least likable aspects of human nature on screen to shame us all, perhaps subtly in his mind but apparently not to the French government and for Continental, whose Modus Operandi was to make non-political, simple minded entertainment films. Thus while being punished for the subversive act of making a film that flies in the face of this remit, Clouzot has since earned the respect of filmmakers and film fans alike in this wake."
