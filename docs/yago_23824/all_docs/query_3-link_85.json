It does not refer to the bird but to someone who sends threatening letters.\n\nThank you very much for your help.\n\nClouzot\n\nhello\n\nIn 'argot' French slang, un corbeau is someone who sends poison-pen letters which is what the film is about. Shot in the early 40's it was regarded as a metaphor for'some' French people during WW2. As for the birds there are very few ravens in France."
