SUBJECT OUTLINEâ©\n\nIn this Honours Special Subject we propose to focus on a broad range of films dealing with the themes of occupation by, collaboration with and resistance to the Nazis. Although there is a strong emphasis on France (which reflects the research interests of Katharine and myself and perhaps also the trauma created in French society by the occupation), Germany, Poland and Italy will also be covered. In the mid-semester break we plan to show a number of hard to find and quite lengthy documentaries about the French and Polish experience, along with 3 films by Rossellini on the Italian experience. The aim of the subject is to explore the treatment of the themes of occupation, collaboration and resistance by individual filmmakers and to determine their historical accuracy in the light of recent research.\n\nB. GENERAL READINGâ©\n\nThe bibliography provided in this Subject Guide has been compiled from the computer catalogue of the BSL, other subject guides (such as Problems and Perspectives in Modern European History, German Europe, and Responses to War), the Historical Abstracts and Modern Language Association of America (MLA) CD-ROMs, seminal works in the field of history and film, and Katharine Thornton's 1993 Honours thesis Cinema lectures: aspects of Vichy ideology and French life under the German occupation as seen in French films, 1942-1987, (Adelaide University, 1993). However, it remains a working bibliography only. There is much you can and will find for yourslves.

FILM AND THE HISTORY OF OCCUPATION, COLLABORATION, AND RESISTANCE IN WW2â©\n\nReading to be determined at a later date.\n\nExamination\n\nINSTRUCTIONSâ©\n\nYou must answer three (3) questions in three (3) hours. You must answer one (1) question from each of the three (3) sections below.\n\nSECTION I (REQUIRED QUESTION)â©\n\n\"Collaboration\" and \"Resistance\" are not polar opposites but merely points on a complex continuum of political positions. Discuss with respect to at least 2 specific examples of collaboration or resistance you have investigated in this subject.\n\nSECTION II (FILM)â©\n\n1. \"Films, in contrast to written histories, hinder rather than help our understanding of the Nazi period because they oversimplify the complex reasons why individuals collaborated or resisted.\" Discuss this claim with respect to at least 2 specific examples of collaboration or resistance you have investigated in the films shown in this subject.\n\n2. Discuss the relative importance of ideology and historical accident in predisposing an individual to resist or collaborate. Discuss with respect to at least 2 films shown in this subject.\n\n3. Robert Rosenstone, in an article in the American Historical Review, 1990, vol. 95, no. 4, states:\n\nMore important than the screen's mere power to show may be the ability of the fictional historical film to raise questions about how we think and remember the past, and how we retell it to ourselves.\n\nDiscuss with respect to at least 2 films shown in this subject.\n\n3. \"A major contribution of film in the post-war period has been to challenge the myth of heroic and honourable resistance.\" Discuss with respect to at least 2 films shown in this subject.\n\n4. In Claude Lanzmann's documentary Shoah, the Czech Jew and survivor of five liquidations of the Auschwitz \"special detail\", Filip Müller, makes the following remarks about staying alive and bearing witness (pp. 164-5 of film text):\n\nThat was happening to my countrymen, and I realised that my life had become meaningless. Why go on living? For what? So I went into the gas chamber with them, resolved to die. With them. Suddenly, some who recognized me came up to me. For my locksmith friends and I had sometimes gone into the family camp. A small group of women approached. They looked at me and said, right there in the gas chamber...\n\nYou were inside the gas chamber?\n\nYes. One of them said: \"So you want to die. But that is senseless. Your death won't give us back our lives. That's no way. You must get out of here alive, you mut nbear witness to our suffering, and to the injustice done to us.\"\n\nDiscuss.\n\nSECTION III (OPTIONS)â©\n\n1. To what extent (if any) has the participation of women in resistance movements challenged or reinforced ideas about traditional gender roles?\n\n2. How have post-war political concerns influenced the historiography of the Holocaust in Poland?\n\n3. \"The use of the image of Joan of Arc by any political group in the 20th century has been plagued by contradiction.\" Discuss."
