        "text": "It is well to know at the outset that the French-made picture \"Le Corbeau\" (\"The Raven\"), which had its American première at the Avenue Playhouse yesterday, has a history almost as tortuous as the substance of the drama itself. Made in Paris during the Nazi occupation by a company with German sponsorship, it was seized by the new French Government after the Liberation and long withheld from the screen. The argument was that it presented a demoralizing picture of French life and that it had actually been used by the Nazis to show the \"decadence\" of the French. Eventually it was exculpated of any political malevolence and was then released by the Government to private distributors, through whom it has come here.These are facts which are pertinent to a full scan of the contents and significance of this film, which, naturallly, has kicked up a ruckus such as the French call a cause célèbre. For, however the Government may now view it, it cannot be denied that \"Le Corbeau\" does put a black complexion upon the character of the petit-bourgeois French. In fact, it paints a thoroughly grim picture of the questionable nature of mankind. And if this isn't intentionally discouraging, it doesn't help to raise the spirits a bit.Specifically, it tells a story of a community somewhere in France which is stirred to explosive suspicions by a flood of letters from an unknown \"poison pen.\" The object and victim of the campaign is a young physician who apparently means all right but who commits the fatal indiscretion of being chummy with a couple of local dames. Both of these women are neurotics, as are most of the people in town—including, indeed, the young doctor—so the intimacies are delicate, at best. Exposed under such circumstances in an atmosphere of jealousy and fear, they become the eventual detonators of cruel and vindictive violence.As a straight piece of mystery melodrama, this tale would bet harrowing and sad without any of the further manifestations of misanthropy that have gone into it. But, on top of the superficial mystery—which gets more and more involved, by the way—the author of the screen play, Louis Chavance, has added some morbid decorations of his own. The community, in addition to the two women who are creatures of drab frustrations, contains several mean and greedy doctors, politicians and assorted professional men. There is a child of malevolent disposition, an old woman on the lunatic fringe and a trained nurse whose disappointed romance has warped and confused her mind. Furthermore, the earnest young doctor, who seems so upright and noble at the start, turns out to be an equally shabby and hypocritical monomaniac.Unquestionably, the purpose of the author and of the director, Henri-Georges Clouzot, was to prove, in a trenchant melodrama, the shaky underpinning of society, the perilous state of corruption of an ingrown and stagnant community. And, with a cast of exceptionally good actors they have managed, at least, to convey a pretty fair indication that there is something rotten within their scan. Pierre Fresnay is distressingly harried as the victimized, self-impaled young medical man and Ginette Leclerc and Micheline Francey are elaborately sensitive and vexatious as his two friends. Pierre Larquey gives a crinkled sly performance as a patient philosopher and several other actors etch assorted carbolic characters.But, unfortunately—or, possibly, fortunately, if you want to take the optimistic view—the full theme is strangely incoherent, due either to poor syntax or cuts. Rapid and disconnected bridges confuse the story frequently and dissipate the miasma of cynicism which the contents exude. As a matter of fact, at some points the confusion and gloom are so great that the whole thing begs desperately for laughter and discrediting ridicule. One may be suspicious of the Nazis, or even respect the author's frank despair. But, in the end, the healthy reflector is likely to ask simply, \"Who's looney now?\"\n\nLE CORBEAU (THE RAVEN), scenario by Louis Chavance; adaptation and dialogue by Henri-Georges Clouzot and Louis Chavence, directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot; produced by Continental Films and released here by Westport International Films, Inc.
