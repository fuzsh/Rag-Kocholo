Dr Rémy Germain, a relatively recent resident of the town, is a particular target of the letters. The first letter we see is addressed to Dr Germain, and accuses him of having an affair with Laura Vorzet (Micheline Francey), the wife of a local psychiatrist. Early scenes in the film establish a number of suspicions – that Dr Germain performs abortions; that Marie Corbin, a nurse at the hospital and the sister of Laura, is stealing drugs and is consumed with jealousy over her perception that her sister is carrying on an affair with Dr Germain; that Dr Germain is genuinely attracted to Laura Vorzet; and that Denise Saillens, who lives in the same building as Dr Germain, fakes illness to lure him into bed. Suspicious characters, particularly women, seem to abound in the film, from Marie Corbin, who is a busybody, to Rolande, the 14-yearold niece of Denise, who peeks through keyholes. The anonymous letters increase in number, reaching epidemic proportions, and they reveal increasingly scandalous information about financial misdeeds, adulterous affairs and general misbehaviour. When a cancer patient in the hospital kills himself after receiving a letter telling him that his disease is fatal, suspicions turn to the nurse Marie Corbin, who is pursued by an angry mob. But, after she is arrested and put into prison, another letter appears, floating down from a church balcony during mass. Suspicion turns to Dr Germain, since he is mentioned in virtually all of the letters. As enquiries into Germain’s life are mounted, Dr Germain’s own past is revealed: he was a famous brain surgeon, whose wife was expecting a child, and the doctor who treated her allowed both her and the child to die. Hence in his new life in SaintRobin, Germain – now a general practitioner rather than a surgeon – always makes the choice to save the mother’s life, and hence the accusations of abortion.\n\nx\n\nL E C O R B E AU\n\nEventually it is agreed that the culprit must be one of the parishioners seated in the church balcony when the letter drifted down, and they are subjected to a lengthy dictation session in order to weed out the guilty party. Dr Vorzet presides, as he is a self-described expert in l’anonymographie, the study of anonymous letters and handwriting analysis. Denise faints during the session, thus pointing to her potential guilt, yet the results of her handwriting are inconclusive. Dr Germain visits her, and discovers an anonymous letter addressed to him, announcing that Denise is pregnant. Thinking he has discovered the source of the anonymous letters, Dr Germain confronts Denise, who admits only to having written this one letter. But, she says, Laura had telephoned her earlier to tell her of a particularly nasty and threatening letter she had just received. Germain goes to Laura, who denies knowledge of the letter. But, until Germain discovers ink marks on Laura’s hands, he thinks he has been had by Denise. Dr Vorzet intervenes, tells Germain that he has just discovered Laura’s guilt, and accepts Germain’s offer to declare her insane. Rejoined with Denise, Germain describes Laura’s guilt, but Denise insists that this is not possible. Germain returns to the Vorzet house after Laura has been taken away, and finds Dr Vorzet, collapsed on his desk, murdered as he was writing a final anonymous letter. His throat was slit, and Germain looks through the open window to see the mother of the cancer patient walk away, her revenge enacted.\n\nIntroduction\n\nFor most of his career in the cinema, from the 1930s, when he began work as a screenwriter, to his last film as a director, La Prisonnière/The Prisoner in 1968, Henri-Georges Clouzot seemed a bit out of touch and out of time. Two of his films from the 1950s, Le Salaire de la peur/Wages of Fear (1953) and Les Diaboliques/The Fiends (1955), are recognised as classics of French cinema.1 But, in the context of the 1950s, Clouzot’s work fits neither of the categories that have long been considered representative of the era, the ‘tradition of quality’ and ‘auteur cinema’. His portrait of Pablo Picasso, Le Mystère Picasso/The Mystery of Picasso (1956), is widely recognised as a brilliant film about art and the artist, but rarely is the film considered as having had much of an influence in the context of French film-making. In the 1960s, Clouzot seemed – like many film-makers of his generation – to be out of touch with the new approaches to film-making that heralded the advent of the New Wave. His last two features, La Vérité (Truth, 1960) and La Prisonnière, might have been interesting in their own right, but Clouzot was considered passé at the time of their release. For better or worse, Clouzot was very much a man of his time during the period that solidified his reputation as a film-maker. During the Second World War, Clouzot worked for the Nazi-owned film company Continental Films. He wrote two screenplays for films directed by others (Le Dernier des six/Last of the Six, 1941, and Les Inconnus dans la maison/Strangers in the House, 1942), and directed his first two films (L’Assassin habite au 21/The Assassin Lives at Number 21, 1942, and Le Corbeau/The Raven, 1943) for Continental. Additionally, after the success of Le Dernier des six (one of Continental’s earliest releases), Clouzot was hired as the head of the company’s screenplay division. Perhaps more than any other French filmmaker of the time, Clouzot was closely involved with the workings of\n\n2\n\nL E C O R B E AU\n\nContinental, from requesting script changes, to overseeing what films would be produced, to working closely with Alfred Greven, the head of the company. When France was liberated from German Occupation, Le Corbeau became the single film, and Clouzot the single director, that embodied all of the implications of Continental’s successes during the war. Clouzot was punished accordingly. Even though his three-year suspension from film-making was less harsh than the punishment accorded others in the cinema (like stage and screen actor, director and writer Sacha Guitry, who was in jail for three years), and certainly mild compared to the death sentence imposed on writer Robert Brasillach, Clouzot’s initial banishment from the cinema became a potent symbol of the Second World War and its aftermath. Indeed, to this day, Le Corbeau remains the emblematic film of the Occupation. Other Occupation films, like Marcel Carné’s Les Visiteurs du soir (1942) or Jean Delannoy’s L’Eternel retour (1943), have become recognised as classics of French cinema, but they are generally discussed either as films that are successful despite the fact that they were made during the Occupation, or as products of an auteurist vision that takes them out of their immediate historical context (in the case of Delannoy’s film, Jean Cocteau worked so closely on the screenplay that he is often considered as much of an auteur as Delannoy was). Significantly, both Carné’s and Delannoy’s/Cocteau’s films evoke a somewhat mythical past (fifteenth-century France and the legend of Tristan and Yseult, respectively). In contrast, Clouzot’s film is set in what Jean-Pierre Jeancolas calls the ‘contemporain vague’ of many Occupation films, a vague yet recognisable present tense unspecified in terms of a moment or place.2 If Le Corbeau was put on trial (and it was) as a film that was ‘antiFrench’, much of the controversy surrounding the film had to do with Clouzot himself as the film-maker most invested in, and most adept at, cinematic collaboration during the war. According to Clouzot’s own account, Le Corbeau was not a film that Continental was particularly eager to make, and Clouzot claimed that he was fired from the studio after the film was completed. As with virtually all stories of collaborationist activity during the war, such accounts as these have to be taken with the proverbial grain of salt. Yet as audiences since the 1940s have seen the film, the question remains: how\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\ncould a film that deals so explicitly with anonymous letters be approved and financed by a Nazi company, given that the Germans depended upon such letters for information about the whereabouts of Jews and members of the Resistance? How could a regime so repressive be so apparently permissive in regard to the cinema, which had high attendance during the war? As Evelyn Ehrlich observes, French Occupation cinema is a cinema of paradox, and Le Corbeau exemplifies the peculiar and contradictory aspects of the era.3 Le Corbeau embodies, perhaps more than any other single film, this paradoxical quality of a French film industry that thrived under oppressive conditions, and that produced its share of provocative and engaging films.\n\nNotes 1 2 3\n\nFor an in-depth discussion of Les Diaboliques, see Hayward, Susan, Les Diaboliques (London: I.B.Tauris, 2005). Jeancolas, Jean-Pierre, 15 ans d’années trente: Le cinéma des français 1929–1944 (Paris: Stock, 1983), pp. 321–322. Ehrlich, Evelyn, Cinema of Paradox: French Filmmaking Under the German Occupation (New York: Columbia University Press, 1985).\n\n1\n\nProduction contexts\n\nIn the summer of 1940, France was in a state of turmoil, catastrophe and disarray. French military forces had spent months anticipating German attack during the drôle de guerre, or ‘phoney war’, when French armies were assembled near the Maginot Line (from 3 September 1939 to 10 May 1940). When fighting finally broke out, French military forces were defeated quickly by the German aggressor. The armistice was signed on 25 June. Divided into occupied and (euphemistically) non-occupied zones, France was controlled by the German occupiers in the northern zone, and the collaborationist Vichy government, with the First World War veteran Maréchal Pétain its putative head, in the south. In 1942, Germany occupied the entire country, thus erasing the distinction between occupied and non-occupied zones. Few periods of contemporary history have been so subject to reflection and analysis as these années noires, or ‘dark years’. The story of France during the Second World War is complex, and understandings of that story have changed over the decades. One such change is the move from a Resistance story to a collaborationist one – that is, from a portrait of France as a heroic anti-fascist country united in its desire to defeat Germany, to a portrait of a deeply divided country suspicious of the Left and far more sympathetic to the forces of the Right than had previously been acknowledged.1 Within such a context, the story of the fate of French cinema during the war might seem trivial indeed. Because of a series of important developments, the French film industry was able not only to survive, but to thrive, despite the\n\n6\n\nL E C O R B E AU\n\nfact that a number of important directors – Julien Duvivier, René Clair, Jean Renoir, to name a few – left the country. As Evelyn Ehrlich observes, ‘…to those who endured the occupation, the cinema was of great importance. Movie theaters provided refuge from the uncertainty and hardship of everyday life. The French public flocked to the darkened theaters to see a world they had lost or one that existed only in their dreams.’2 Henri-Georges Clouzot’s 1943 film Le Corbeau embodies the status of French cinema during the war, its successes and failures, its limits and its possibilities. To be sure, other films made during the war have achieved the status of masterpieces of French cinema, including Marcel Carné’s Les Visiteurs du soir/The Night Visitors (1942) and Les Enfants du paradis/Children of Paradise (1943–1945). But both these films are set in the past, in the mythical medieval castle of Les Visiteurs du soir and on the nineteenthcentury Boulevard du Crime in Les Enfants du paradis. Many have argued that these films do indeed engage with and reflect upon the reality of an Occupied France. But Le Corbeau is so openly and boldly situated in a contemporary context that many have wondered how the film could possibly have been made, particularly given how its subject matter – anonymous letters that poison the atmosphere of a small town – is so directly reflective of Occupied France, where anonymous letters were a common practice encouraged by the Nazis. Despite the fact that its opening title announces that the film is set in a ‘petite ville, ici ou ailleurs’ (‘a little town, here or elsewhere’), the tale of anonymous letters reveals a town in crisis, and a community in turmoil, very much like the France of 1943 when the film was made.\n\nContinental and COIC The significance of Le Corbeau as a film of the Occupation needs to be understood first and foremost in relationship to Continental Films, the German-owned company that produced it. Many companies made films during the Occupation, but Continental dominated the French film industry during the war in both economic and cultural terms. The influence and\n\nPRODUCTION CONTEXTS\n\n7\n\ndominance of Continental suggest a number of interrelated questions. Why were so many French film personnel – directors, actors, technicians – willing to work for a Nazi company (aside from the obvious fact that they needed work)? How did a Nazi company present a public face that was recognisably French? What kind of cinematic presence did Continental promote in France, and how much did Continental ‘collaborate’ with the French – as opposed to dominating them? How was film understood during the war from the perspectives of both those in the industry and those who attended motion pictures at record levels? Despite the economic hardships and the realities of invasion and Occupation, French cinema flourished during the Second World War. Continental produced 30 of the 220 fiction films made during the Occupation (more than any other single company).3 Since Continental was a Nazi company, it comes as little surprise that it was able to acquire the means, the materials and the personnel necessary to dominate the film market. If, as Jacques Siclier claims, everyday filmgoers in France during the war made little distinction between films produced by Continental and those produced by other companies, then this is a surely a sign of Continental’s success in demonstrating French collaboration rather than German domination.4 Continental’s films ‘looked’ French (and in some ways they looked American, as well – none too surprising given that American films were virtually absent during the war, thus giving film-makers the opportunity to compete with the American product). Familiar faces appeared in Continental films, actors like Pierre Fresnay and Fernand Ledoux, actresses like Danielle Darrieux and Ginette Leclerc. Continental’s films may well have seemed like any other French film to audiences, but, for those who worked in the film industry, Continental was a brutal reminder of the stakes of German investment in, and domination of, France. Continental Films was officially created only months after the invasion of France, on 3 October 1940. The significance of Continental was amplified by the creation of another organisation, COIC (Comité d’Organisation de L’Industrie Cinématographique/Committee for the Organisation of the Cinema Industry), administered by the collaborationist Vichy government. In different and inevitably interconnected ways, these two organisations would bring order\n\n8\n\nL E C O R B E AU\n\nand regulation to the chaotic French film industry and would shape the contours of French film-making until the end of the war, in the case of Continental, and well beyond, in the case of COIC (the organisation was maintained after the war’s end and eventually became the CNC, the Centre National de la Cinématographie/National Cinema Centre, which still exists today). A number of men had important posts with COIC over the years, including government official Guy de Carmoy, producers Raoul Ploquin and Roger Richebé, and director Louis Daquin. Although the ‘face’ of Continental may well have been French, a single man successfully created its film empire, the German film producer Alfred Greven. Greven was a veteran of the First World War who had been head of production at UFA (Universum Film Aktiengesellschaft/Universal Film Company) studios as well as the director of Terra Films (the company that produced one of the most vile anti-Semitic films in history, Jew Süss [directed by Veit Harlan, 1940]). Greven was a cinephile and a Francophile, described by some as charming and by others as the prototype of an authoritarian Nazi. Maurice Bessy describes Greven as ‘43 years old, tall, terse, going bald…Dynamic, with good French, friendly but distant.’5 Although he recruited the best talent he could find for Continental, Greven also exerted considerable (and at times threatening) pressure on individuals to get what he wanted. One of the most important aspects of Greven’s background was that he already had considerable experience in French–German collaboration, since he had worked with some of the French directors, writers and actors who made French/German co-productions in the 1930s, one of whom was Henri-Georges Clouzot. A contemporary observer may well wonder how French directors could so willingly sign up for an Occupation company. Here, the background of 1930s European film production is essential to keep in mind. Many of those who were first hired to work at Continental (actors as well as directors and screenwriters) had participated in the numerous French–German film productions that were common practice in the 1930s. Given the many weaknesses in the French film industry of the 1930s, these films allowed the Nazi film industry to take advantage of lucrative French markets. The films were literally produced twice on the same sets, one version with French actors, another with German actors. Henri Decoin (who\n\nPRODUCTION CONTEXTS\n\n9\n\nwould eventually work for Continental), for instance, directed Le Domino vert in 1935 in Berlin starring two popular French actors, his then wife Danielle Darrieux and Charles Vanel. The film was produced by the German company UFA and was distributed in France by the German company ACE (Alliance Cinématographique Européene/European Cinematic Alliance). German actors took the place of Darrieux and Vanel for the German version. UFA’s producer for the film was Greven, appointed by Joseph Goebbels, the Propaganda Minister for the Third Reich.6 (The German financial support for these ventures was, of course, Nazi money.) The French producer was Raoul Ploquin, who would eventually become the head of COIC.7 Given this history of French–German collaboration, and of Nazi financing of the French film industry, Rémy Pithon concludes that going to work for Continental in 1941 ‘must not have seemed a novelty to someone who had spent time in the offices of ACE and had signed contracts with UFA in Paris’.8 Danielle Darrieux, for one, claimed in her autobiography that since she had, like many of her colleagues, worked in Germany in the 1930s, she really didn’t have a clear idea of what working for Continental meant. The observation seems disingenuous on Darrieux’s part, but she soon discovered what working for Continental entailed. Darrieux and Decoin had separated when they worked together on Premier rendez-vous, one of Continental’s first films. She became romantically involved with Portofirio Rubirosa, a diplomat from the Dominican Republic whose anti-Nazi sentiments were well known. Greven pressured Darrieux into making two more films for Continental (Caprices, 1942, and La Fausse maîtresse, 1942) by threatening to make life difficult for Rubirosa. This side of Greven, demonstrating a determination to get what he wanted at any cost, undoubtedly contributed to the image many had of him as an ‘ideal Nazi’. When Darrieux refused to make any more films for Continental, Clouzot and director André Cayatte went to see her to put pressure on her, but she continued to refuse. Greven insisted that she become virtually invisible in France, that she make no more films for any company and that no magazines could write about her.9 Despite the unpleasant end to his relationship with Darrieux, Greven’s acquaintance with so many French directors and actors facilitated the creation of Continental Films. Clouzot’s case is typical in the sense that he was part\n\n10\n\nL E C O R B E AU\n\nof a talent pool already familiar with and known to the German film industry as well as with producers like Greven. Continental Films had an extremely well-integrated organisation at its disposal, for Greven was a direct link to Tobis (the German production company that also produced many films in France), to UFA, as well as to ACE. ACE distributed all of Continental’s films during the war, as well as German films in France. In addition, Greven created SOGEC (Société de gestion et d’exploitation du cinéma/Society for Film Management and Distribution), made possible by the appropriation of French movie theatres owned by Jews. Immediately after the invasion, all movie theatres closed in France and gradually reopened only at the discretion of the Germans. Cinemas owned by Jews were not permitted to reopen, and SOGEC managed to buy large numbers of theatres by virtue of its huge amount of capital and the immediate implementation of anti-Semitic laws. Greven also acquired exclusive access to Paris-Studio-Cinéma for shooting. Greven moved quickly to capitalise on resources, and he had a complete system of production, distribution and exhibition at his disposal, thus creating a virtual film empire. But perhaps most important, especially in terms of the image that would be projected of Continental Films, Greven was able to hire a group of talented and well-known directors from the outset. Le Film, the official film journal of Vichy, announced in its second issue that five directors had been hired by Continental: Maurice Tourneur, Marcel Carné, Christian-Jaque, Georges Lacombe and Léo Joannon.10 Carné later described his contract as a bit of trickery on Greven’s part, and while the director did indeed have a project in mind for Continental, it was never realised and he was able to extricate himself from his contract.11 The remaining directors were well known. Christian-Jaque, Léo Joannon and Georges Lacombe had established their directing careers in the 1930s (Joannon had directed one film before 1930), while Maurice Tourneur was a film veteran who had been making films in the US and France since the silent era. Continental Films dominated the French film industry during the war, and there were conflicts about its authority and presence. From the point of view of the collaborationist Vichy government, the film industry was one of many in France in need of serious overhaul and regulation. Regulation\n\nPRODUCTION CONTEXTS\n\n11\n\nsometimes meant rules that provided much-needed economic boosts to the film industry, such as the abolition of double features (thus immediately raising the profits on individual films), and the successful negotiation of bank loans that provided much-needed capital for film production. But regulation also meant Aryanisation of the film industry. From the point of view of those in the film industry, COIC provided the means to ensure that French cinema would remain French (and sometimes ‘French’ meant free from German control, while at others it meant free from so-called ‘Jewish influence’). While official pronouncements in Le Film praised Continental Films and collaboration in general, there were in fact profound conflicts between COIC and Continental in the course of the war, largely because there was never any question as to which organisation really held the power and authority to shape the course of French film history. COIC was entirely justified in its fears about French cinema. For French film-makers and producers who remained in France during the war, the safeguarding of the cinema was not only a matter of national pride, and not only a way to preserve some part of French culture in the face of defeat and Occupation, but also an attempt to address the problems that had put French cinema of the 1930s on the verge of economic collapse. The Occupation provided an impetus for the development of structures and regulations that virtually all members of the film community agreed were necessary in order to end the financial instability that characterised French cinema of the 1930s.12 French films of the 1930s, whether masterpieces of poetic realism like Carné’s Le jour se lève (1939), innovative explorations of the aesthetic qualities of sound film like René Clair’s Sous les toits de Paris (1930), or auteurist visions like Jean Renoir’s La Grande illusion (1937), La Bête humaine (1938) or La Règle du jeu/Rules of the Game (1939), continue to be recognised to this day as marvellous contributions to the art of the cinema. Yet these films were produced in a context of economic and industrial chaos. The costs of film-making rose steadily in the 1930s, and French films were always in a precarious financial state because of the large number of American films that were shown in France, with virtually no quotas or protection of the French film industry. The film industry was not regulated, and it was not uncommon for a company to collapse in ruin after the production of a single film. It was\n\n12\n\nL E C O R B E AU\n\ngenerally agreed that something needed to be done, and in 1937, Popular Front Education Minister Jean Zay declared famously that ‘il faut épurer le cinéma français’(‘French cinema must be purged’).13 Not much was done until the outbreak of the ‘phoney war’ in September 1939, and then the imposition of government regulation had more to do with censorship (no films that were demoralising; no anti-war films) than with a reorganisation of the industry. Only when the Germans invaded France was Jean Zay’s call for reform realised in ways he never would have imagined or intended. When the Vichy government was established, steps were taken to form industrial organisations to regulate all aspects of the economy, and in that context COIC was established. COIC was officially recognised on 2 November 1940. As Evelyn Ehrlich describes it, COIC brought together the film industry’s desire to maintain French production with the Vichy government’s desire to impose corporate structures on all industries. Although Guy de Carmoy, who became Vichy’s head of the cinema division in August, was not in favour of collaboration, he feared that if the French did not control the French film industry, the Germans would. Like many if not most members of the film industry, Carmoy saw the survival of French cinema threatened by Continental.14 Hence COIC was often at odds with Continental. Yet the first activities of COIC – activities meant to protect and nourish the French film industry – were not only reflective of the Nazi practices of anti-Semitism, but went further than what was expected or required. The first anti-Semitic laws enacted in France prohibited Jews from being heads of companies; by issuing obligatory professional cards to all film personnel, which required proof of Aryan identity, COIC was effectively banning all Jews from all work in the industry. As Jean-Pierre Bertin-Maghit puts it: ‘Contrary to what happened in other professions, the application of statutes concerning Jews in the cinema went beyond what was required by law, which concerned only heads of business and department heads. Here, the law applied to everyone [i.e., all Jews who worked in the cinema]. This zealous excess was undoubtedly the result of xenophobic movements that were widespread throughout the 1930s.’15 The pages of the earliest issues of Le Film demonstrate the price paid by COIC for the safeguarding of the film industry. In 1940 and 1941, German\n\nPRODUCTION CONTEXTS\n\n13\n\nfilms were shown widely in France, and Le Film praised the films and their stars, like Zarah Leander and Ilse Werner. Particular praise was accorded the anti-Semitic propaganda film Jew Süss. The film was discussed in several issues of the journal, where it is referred to as a ‘brilliant work’.16 A commentary on Les Tribus du cinéma et du théâtre, Lucien Rebatet’s hateful diatribe against supposed Jewish influence in the theatre and the cinema, notes that the ‘violence’ of Rebatet’s work is completely necessary. The author writes: ‘Those of us in the cinema have been damaged by twenty years of cohabitation with Jews, who for the most part are foreigners just out of the ghetto. […] Getting rid of these unsavoury individuals is the responsibility of our directors. Rediscovering the correct way to proceed is our job, those of us in the industry.’17 There is a disturbing tendency in some accounts of cinema during the Second World War to praise COIC for saving the industry, while attributing the dreadful practices of the organisation to Vichy alone. Jacques Siclier, for instance, does not shy away from acknowledging the practices of COIC insofar as anti-Semitic legislation is concerned, but, by treating anti-Semitism and the regulation of the French film industry as two different elements, a far more disturbing question is avoided – whether, in the hearts and minds of those who were devoted to the survival of French cinema, ridding the industry of Jews was not only desirable, but essential to that survival.18 Much has been made of the fact that at Continental, Greven knowingly hired a Jewish screenwriter, Jean-Paul Le Chanois (whose given name was Jean-Paul Dreyfus). Producer and director Roger Richebé tells how, in 1942, Greven told him that the best cinema personnel were Jews. Naturally not quite knowing how to respond, Richebé said nothing until Greven, clearly referring to Le Chanois, confided in him: ‘I have a Jew working for me, but he doesn’t know that I know…’19 In other words, while COIC was enthusiastically purging the film industry of any possible Jewish ‘contamination’, Greven was making exceptions that never would have got through the required bureaucratic steps imposed by COIC for employment in the industry. Yet the fact that Greven was willing to look the other way insofar as Le Chanois was concerned suggests only that he was an opportunist as far as Nazi law was concerned. Greven was not above threatening\n\n14\n\nL E C O R B E AU\n\nretaliation against Jewish loved ones in order to get what he wanted; according to actress Edwige Feuillère, Greven forced her to make Mam’zelle Bonaparte (directed by Maurice Tourneur, 1942) by threatening her Jewish friend and companion with deportation.20 Throughout the period of the Occupation, COIC and Continental clashed in different ways, and in virtually every case, the central issue was whether the French would retain control over the industry. Since Continental was officially a French company, any protests by COIC about German interference were handily dismissed. In a confidential report about the activities of COIC, dated 17 July 1941, what was never stated in the pages of Le Film is stated clearly:‘Continental Films competes with and handicaps French production. By hiring, since November 1940, the best French directors, artists, and technicians, Continental Films wants to limit the output of French productions.’21 The unfair advantage held by Continental, and the somewhat naïve belief that because Continental was officially a French company, it would be accountable to the same rules as any other French film organisation, led COIC to take a number of positions (sometimes clandestinely) to preserve its turf. Consider, for example, one of COIC’s complaints about Continental concerning the status of the film director. The well-known directors who had made French films during the 1930s, like Christian-Jaque and Henri Decoin, and who worked for Continental, gave the company an appearance of both historical continuity and French integrity. While many of the directors at Continental had already-established careers, Continental also gave some men their first opportunity to direct, among them Clouzot, André Cayatte and the actor Fernandel. The practice was common at other studios as well, and film-makers Jacques Becker and Robert Bresson made their feature film debuts during the war. In April 1942, film-maker and COIC official Louis Daquin outlined what was seen as a dangerous situation: ‘For some time we’ve seen well-known writers and actors announce their intentions to direct films that they have either written or star in.’22 Aside from Clouzot, Cayatte and Fernandel, other names included in the list include Jean Anouilh and J.P. Feydeau for the writers, and René Dary and Pierry Fresnay among the actors. Daquin called the practice a threat to those who were ‘professional directors’, particularly since writers and actors already has a job.23 Despite Daquin’s\n\nPRODUCTION CONTEXTS\n\n15\n\nimplication that these writers and actors were taking jobs away from those in need, many film personnel did indeed leave the country, whether by choice or necessity, and there were many opportunities created for first-time directors. Continental is not named specifically by Daquin, but since most of the names he mentions were affiliated with the firm, it seems likely that this was an example of the fear of Continental’s authority – not only the authority to produce French films, but to violate established notions of film authorship. This concern about authorship seems like a bureaucratic obsession to award credentials to the right people, but it is also an attempt to challenge the right of the German occupiers to create flexibility in the professional ranks of the cinema. That Clouzot was one of the beneficiaries of this flexibility contributed to his controversial status. Immediately after the defeat of France, film-making in the occupied zone was prohibited by the Occupation forces, and Continental cemented its authority by producing films that provided a welcome change from the German films that were promoted in France.24 Continental’s first six films were released in France between August and October 1941. Premier rendezvous/First Rendez-Vous (directed by Henri Decoin and starring Danielle Darrieux), a romantic comedy, was the first Continental film released in France, on 14 August. Le Dernier des six/Last of the Six followed (released 16 September). The remaining Continental films of the year were Le Club des soupirants/Nine Bachelors (directed by Maurice Gleize, 26 September), L’Assassinat du Père Noël/The Assassination of Father Christmas (directed by Christian-Jaque, 16 October), Ne bougez plus/Stay Still (directed by Pierre Caron, 31 October) and Péchés de jeunesse/Sins of Youth (directed by Maurice Tourneur, 16 November). With the exception of L’Assassinat du Père Noël and Le Dernier des six, all of Continental’s first group of films were variations on the genre of romantic comedy, thus suggesting that Continental’s primary role would be to make films that would distract the public. L’Assassinat du Père Noël and Le Dernier des six were different, for they were mystery films with a twist – the fantastic, in the case of the former, and dark comedy, in the case of the latter. It is common to refer to the films made by Continental – as well as most of the films made during the Occupation – as ‘diversions’. While it requires\n\n16\n\nL E C O R B E AU\n\nlittle imagination to grasp that film audiences would indeed seek in movie theatres some kind of ‘escape’ from the realities of war and Occupation, too often the very term ‘diversion’ is used to obscure the possibility that distraction and entertainment can reveal important understandings of how the Occupation was lived, understood and experienced by the French. As a blanket term, ‘distraction’ does little to clarify what contributed to the success of Continental’s films. The films produced by Continental were mysteries, comedies and dramas; some were light in tone, while others were dark and ominous. There were adaptations, some of nineteenth-century works of French literature (André Cayatte’s adaptation of Zola’s novel Au bonheur des dames/The Ladies’ Paradise, 1943, and of Maupassant’s novel Pierre et Jean, 1943), others of works by mystery novelist Georges Simenon (who was the most often adapted author of the Occupation and who in 1942 signed a contract with Continental), including Annette et la dame blonde/Annette and the Blonde Woman (Jean Dréville, 1942) and Picpus (Richard Pottier, 1943). Continental’s films featured the most popular actors of the day, from Danielle Darrieux and Ginette Leclerc to Albert Préjean and Pierre Fresnay, and the stars of Continental films were featured regularly in fan magazines like Ciné-mondial and Vedettes. Some of Continental’s films seemed to function – despite Greven’s assurances that there would be no propaganda expected of film-makers – as not so subtle reminders of the decadence of the pre-war period (Raimu’s famous speech denouncing the bourgeoisie in Les Inconnus dans la maison/Strangers in the House (1942), discussed in more detail below), or of the promises of a ‘new order’ unifying Europe (Mouret’s speech at the conclusion of Au bonheur des dames announces a new era of ‘collaboration’ [specifically between the workers and management of the department store], which would have been difficult not to see equally as the promise of French–German collaboration). One of the questions most commonly raised about Le Corbeau has to do with how and why a film that seems to reflect so directly upon the common wartime practice of anonymous letter-writing could have been made by a Nazi organisation. Thus it is important to consider how the practice of censorship worked vis-à-vis films made for Continental. One of the many ironies of the Occupation, of course, is that directors at Continental did not\n\nPRODUCTION CONTEXTS\n\n17\n\nhave to go through the censorship channels otherwise imposed on French directors. French film-makers who worked there had far more liberty than they would have had they worked at any other production company during the war. This does not mean that any and all film subjects would be allowed at Continental, yet several Continental films are surprising for how much they suggest the possibility of a critical view of collaboration. Indeed, Evelyn Ehrlich states: ‘A few filmmakers working at Continental took advantage of the relative freedom from censorship constraints…to insert veiled messages of nationalism and even resistance in their films.’ Had Continental been concerned with censoring its films, says Ehrlich, three would have made them particularly uncomfortable.25 The first is Christian-Jaques’s 1941 film L’Assassinat du Père Noël, which ends (in a sharp detour from the novel by Pierre Véry from which it was adapted) with a declaration of French pride in the face of adversity. Harry Baur, who plays the role of a globemaker, tells a child at the film’s end of a beautiful French princess who is asleep: ‘One might have thought she was dead,’ says Baur’s character. ‘And there are those who would have thought so, but they are wrong. She was very much alive and in her sleep she had a dream, a marvelous dream, always the same one. She dreamt of a Prince Charming who would one day come and awaken her and bring her happiness.’ Ehrlich reads the statement as ‘hope of eventual liberation’, and suggests that Continental was ‘unaware of its thinly veiled allusion to De Gaulle and the Free French…’.26 The second ‘uncomfortable’ film was La Symphonie fantastique (1942, also by Christian-Jaque), the story of Hector Berlioz. In telling a tale of the famous musician the film also tells a tale of national pride (the film was indeed censored, but even the final version can be seen as exceeding the boundaries of permissible representations of loyalty to France). Finally, Maurice Tourneur’s La Main du diable (1943) takes the tale of a Faustian bargain – a topic one might well imagine to be taboo in an occupied country – and opposes sacrifice for the better good to self-interest and greed (that the film was written by Jewish screenwriter Jean Paul Le Chanois, who was a member of both the Communist Party and the Resistance, adds even more levels of complexity to the film).\n\n18\n\nL E C O R B E AU\n\nIf the notion of ‘diversion’ is limited in usefulness, one must also be wary of reading Continental films as informed by a spirit of resistance.27 The conclusion of L’Assassinat du Père Noël is ambiguous enough to suggest that France is awaiting the formation of the ‘new Europe’ as much as the arrival of Resistance forces. While ambiguity may well be a form of resistance to the occupier, too much emphasis on ambiguity as exceptional takes attention away from the complex ways in which most Occupation films engaged, in however muted or displaced ways, with the contemporary situation. Le Corbeau can be read as an indictment of a culture where surveillance and betrayal are everyday practices. And if we are to believe Clouzot’s own account, the film effectively ended his career because of its dangerous subject matter. But given critical elements in other Continental films, like those described above, it might well be more productive to consider these examples not as subversive hidden messages, but as demonstrations of the role played by the cinema in the practice of collaboration. In other words, the apparent freedom of expression given to artists in the employ of Continental created the impression that at least in the realm of the cinema, the Nazis were amenable to fictions that gave audiences the impression that in the movie theatres, imaginary reconstructions of the very nature of the Occupation were permissible. Le Corbeau may well be an exceptional film in this regard. But it was not the only Continental film to suggest that German control of the French film industry was far more flexible, insofar as individual films were concerned, than the typical practice of German censorship would suggest.28 In the four years of the Occupation, the cinema was a site of contestation and negotiation. To be sure, France was controlled by Germany, and Continental’s power was close to absolute. Yet the very nature of German censorship in the film industry, which was quite different from any other media organisation during the war, needs to be understood as a process that not only ‘allowed’ a range of topics with various implications, but encouraged them, as long as certain topics – overt French nationalism, or anything that could suggest a positive view of England – were not broached. German censorship was of course brutal during the Second World War, but Continental constituted a particular and peculiar case. Rather than assume that French film-makers were able to ‘slip in’ various\n\nPRODUCTION CONTEXTS\n\n19\n\nsubtexts or Resistance-inspired nods to French audiences, it is more likely that the German censors – including Alfred Greven – missed nothing, and instead saw Continental as producing the positive face of French–German collaboration. In other words, broad freedom of expression and topics promoted the idea that German domination was good for France. Even though directors at Continental had access to materials, equipment and resources unlike those of any other company during the war, circumstances changed in the course of the Occupation. First, the very nature of the war changed. During the first two years of the Occupation, it was a commonly held belief that the Germans would indeed succeed in establishing Nazi rule in Europe.29 In 1943, and particularly at mid-year, however, when German attention focused more on the Eastern Front and less on the inevitable victory of the Reich, the end of German Occupation was in sight. Second, the goals and visions of Continental Films changed. Initially, with the establishment of the company and the hiring of French personnel, Greven sought to create a cinema that would be emblematic of French–German collaboration in the New Europe. But that notion of the cinema, and of collaboration, did not endure. Twenty Continental films had their premieres before the end of the summer of 1943, and most of the rest of the films shown in 1943 had begun production earlier in the year. The resources once available for Continental were diverted to military ends. When Le Corbeau premiered in September 1943, the end of the war was in sight. We will of course never know if the film would have been as controversial as it was had it been made in 1941 or 1942, or whether Clouzot himself would have been in a position to make such a film earlier on in his career at Continental; in any case, the fate of Le Corbeau as a controversial film is very much a function of its timing. It is well known that cinemas were crowded during the Occupation.30 The common-sense view of the popularity of cinema is that the theatres were warm and that films were – once again – a ‘diversion’ from the Occupation. There is no doubt that cinemas were warm spaces, but so were (some) cafés, theatres and other venues for popular entertainment. Just as the term ‘diversion’ can function as a convenient catch-all to discourage any serious analysis of individual films, it can also be a way to suggest that the cinema is not a ‘serious’ matter in a time of war. It is more productive to take\n\n20\n\nL E C O R B E AU\n\n‘diversion’ seriously, and to ask what was specific to the appeal of cinema to French citizens during the war. If it is common to use the term ‘diversion’ to describe the popularity of the cinema during periods of tumult and crisis, ‘diversion’ is better described in terms of the imaginary worlds the cinema created not only as a defence against the world outside but as an engagement with that world. Screenwriter Jean Aurenche said of filmgoing during the Occupation: ‘Filmgoing for the French was a fabulous evasion. Films allowed the French to forget, together – in spaces where they could at last get warm – the difficulties of everyday life, fear, and sadness.’31 The cinema functioned as a public space, where the threat of surveillance, so evident everywhere in French public life, could be momentarily dispelled, even if very precariously (houselights were kept on during the projection of newsreels, to discourage people from booing them; lines outside of the cinema became, later in the war, recruiting sites for the STO (Service de Travail Obligatoire, obligatory work detail in Germany). There was no such thing as a completely safe space during the war, but the cinema provided the opportunity for French citizens to experience, collectively, a sense of escape and engagement simultaneously. One of the most striking aspects of the films made during the Occupation is how taken up they are with questions of gender. Crises of male authority abound in films of the period, frequently accompanied by an attendant preoccupation with women’s status. The cinema may well be a technology and a form so structured by the gendered polarity of the look that it is always attentive to gender, but every embodiment of that polarity is shaped by specific historical conditions. In the world of Occupation cinema, male authority is undermined in one way or another, from the alcoholic lawyer unable to leave his home, in Les Inconnus dans la maison, to the artist unable to satisfy his desires (and, perhaps more importantly, those of his female companion) until he makes a bargain with the devil in La Main du diable. Women’s authority takes on surprising contours; in Premier rendezvous, for instance, Danielle Darrieux confronts a classroom full of young men about their mocking treatment of their teacher, played by Fernand Ledoux, in a scene quite evocative of the famous scene in Dorothy Arzner’s Dance, Girl, Dance (1940) when Judy confronts her mostly male audience about how she sees them. Marie-Martine (Albert Valentin, 1943) is a\n\nPRODUCTION CONTEXTS\n\n21\n\nretelling of what many consider the quintessential poetic realist film of the 1930s, Carné’s Le Jour se lève, but from a woman’s point of view, and here, as in other films of the era, women’s narrative authority consistently undermines that of men. Noël Burch and Geneviève Sellier’s study of gender in French cinema over a 25-year period regards Occupation cinema as representing a major shift from the male-centred dramas of the 1930s. In their view, Occupation cinema consistently displayed patriarchal power in crisis, with attendant representations of men who are decidedly not icons of traditional masculinity and women who have far more power and authority than had previously been the case in French film. Recalling Jean Guéhenno’s description of Pétain’s announcement of the armistice on the radio (an ‘old man who speaks in the voice of an old woman’), they attribute part of the inspiration for this stunning change in French film to the image of Pétain as a weak old man who embodies all too well the defeat of France.32 The fear of emasculation, of a feminised France passively acquiescing to German authority, permeated France, and it is perhaps in the cinema where these anxieties found their most heightened and influential expressions. If going to the cinema was indeed a diversion for French audiences, the diversion didn’t necessarily take them away from key issues of the era, but rather allowed them to engage with them in imaginative ways.\n\nHenri-Georges Clouzot How, then, did Henri-Georges Clouzot arrive at his exceptional position at Continental films? Born in 1907 in Niort, a small city in the central west area of France, Clouzot shared a love of theatre and cinema with his siblings, but only later in his life did the possibility of a career in stage or screen become a possibility. Clouzot went to Naval School and studied international law and political science, hoping for a career in the diplomatic corps. But, through a series of fortuitous encounters, Clouzot began writing for the cinema. His first credited work occurred in 1931, when he worked on the screenplays for Le Chanteur inconnu, Je serai seule après minuit, Ma cousine de Varsovie, Le Roi\n\n22\n\nL E C O R B E AU\n\ndes palaces and Un Soir de rafle. Virtually all of the work that Clouzot did in film in the early 1930s was in Germany.33 In 1934, Clouzot returned to France (according to him, he was forced to leave because he was too friendly with one of his producers, who was Jewish).34 In Paris he met the renowned actor Louis Jouvet, who encouraged Clouzot’s theatrical work (Jouvet left France during the Second World War; he would eventually star in Clouzot’s first post-war film, Quai des Orfèvres). Clouzot’s career was taking off when he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and was forced to spend four years in sanatoriums. Clouzot, then, left Germany shortly after the ascendancy of the Third Reich in 1933. Many of his compatriots, some of whom would eventually work at Continental, continued to make films in Germany throughout most of the 1930s. When Clouzot returned to Paris in 1938, he immediately began working on film screenplays. He made the acquaintance of two individuals who would be important figures during the next several years of his life. He met Suzy Delair when he was casting a film. The two became companions and collaborated successfully on two films for Continental (Le Dernier des six and L’Assassin habite au 21). Their relationship lasted 12 years. Clouzot met the actor Pierre Fresnay, who was about to direct his first film, Le Duel (1939). Clouzot was hired to adapt the screenplay. The film – the one and only film directed by Fresnay – did not do well, but the two men forged a friendship (Clouzot later said that Pierre Fresnay helped him more than anyone else during his lifetime).35 Fresnay starred in both of the films that Clouzot directed for Continental (L’Assassin habite au 21 and Le Corbeau). Clouzot’s health problems kept him from military service. He continued to work in the theatre (his play On prend les mêmes opened on 4 December 1940 in Paris). Greven knew Clouzot from Berlin, and soon Clouzot was hired by Continental to adapt a novel by Stanislas-André Steeman to the screen. This was Le Dernier des six, directed by Georges Lacombe. The film starred Pierre Fresnay, his first Occupation film and one of several he would star in for Continental. For Clouzot, the film was the first of three that he would adapt by the Belgian author, who was never pleased with the radical changes that Clouzot brought to his works. Steeman’s 1930 mystery novel Six hommes morts (Six Dead Men) (later retitled, after the film, Le Dernier des six) concerns a group of six male friends who make a pact to separate and to pursue their\n\nPRODUCTION CONTEXTS\n\n23\n\nfortunes individually, and then to meet in five years to share their bounty. The novel opens as two of the men, Senterre and Perlonjour, await the arrival of their four allies. Waiting with them is the fiancée (Asuncion) of one of the six men (Gernicot); she has not seen Gernicot for two years. News arrives that one of the awaited men has died under somewhat suspicious circumstances just before the arrival of the ship on which he was sailing. One by one, the other members of the group die, until only Senterre and Perlonjour are left. Both men have fallen in love with Asuncion, and after the apparent death of Gernicot shortly after his arrival, their attentions to her intensify. The inspector on the case is Wens, Steeman’s best-known creation, who is featured in a number of the author’s mysteries. Wens, short for Wenceslas Vorobeïtchik, is a dapper and sometimes acerbic investigator. He handily solves the case, but not without many complications – especially the fact that almost all of the men are murdered before the solution is made apparent. Gernicot was the murderer of the first victim, and, with the help of an accomplice, he staged his own death (and later substituted the accomplice’s mutilated body for his own) and proceeded to kill the remaining members of the group. Only Perlonjour is spared, thanks to Wens’s realisation that the murderer is one of the six men. The rationale for the murders was money, but Gernicot was motivated as well by jealousy, for he was aware of the attentions aroused by Asuncion – revealed to be his wife, not his fiancée – and attempted his final murder (of Senterre) in a state of jealous rage. The basic premise of the novel is maintained in the film, but Clouzot’s screenplay also adds two significant and interrelated threads. First, he adds a theatrical dimension nowhere present in the novel. While in the novel few details are given as to how the men made (or did not make) their fortunes, Senterre in the film has made his fortune in the world of music halls and spectacles. His profession becomes the premise for the introduction of several theatrical performances in the film. The character of Asuncion (now named Lolita, played by Michèle Alfa), who accompanies Gernicot to the scene of his murder, is a performer, ‘la reine de la cible’ (‘queen of sharpshooting’), as the promotional fan she gives Senterre illustrates. She performed in Dakar, where she met Gernicot, and she asks Senterre to feature her on stage to help her financially. A fair amount of screen time is devoted\n\n24\n\nL E C O R B E AU\n\nto Lolita’s appearance on stage as a sharpshooter who takes aim at balloons held by women on stage. Second, the ‘theatrics’ added by Clouzot to the mystery plot are enhanced by what is undoubtedly Clouzot’s most noteworthy addition to Steeman’s novel, the female character Mila Malou. Mila is an aspiring singer and the girlfriend of Wens (thus creating a very different kind of detective; in the novel he is single and is described as misogynist). Suzy Delair, herself a successful stage performer, plays the role of Mila, and her performance of the flighty, high-strung Mila is over the top, as befits her character. Mila wears somewhat gaudy clothing and shrieks rather than speaks at a breakneck speed. In contrast to the reticence of most of the characters in the film, she talks with virtually no sense of restraint. Mila provides comic relief in the film, and she is thus central to the creation of the kind of hybrid mystery/comedy that turned out to be popular during the Occupation. On the basis of his success in the adaptation of Steeman’s novel – and undoubtedly his connections with Pierre Fresnay and his successful introduction of Suzy Delair to the screen didn’t hurt – Clouzot was hired as the head of the screenplay division at Continental. He wrote another screenplay in 1941, an adaptation of Les Inconnus dans la maison, a novel by Georges Simenon. The film was directed by Henri Decoin and starred Raimu in the role of Loursat, an alcoholic lawyer who has withdrawn from the world since his wife left him and his daughter many years before. Pierre Fresnay provided the voiceover in the film, which emphasised Simenon’s tone of darkness and foreboding. When a dead body is discovered in the house that Loursat and his daughter Nicole share, he learns that Nicole has been part of a gang of teenagers (all the other members are male) who hang out at a local bar and who perform various pranks and initiation rites, of which the dead man is one casualty. Loursat agrees to defend Nicole’s boyfriend, Manu, when he is accused of the man’s murder. In Simenon’s novel, the guilty party is Luska, who is in love with Nicole, and his Jewish identity is presented in vile anti-Semitic terms. Interestingly, the explicit anti-Semitism of the novel is not present in the same way in the film, although the casting of Mouloudji, a French-Algerian singer and actor, in the role of Luska could easily be said to suggest racial\n\nPRODUCTION CONTEXTS\n\n25\n\nstereotypes of the criminal. If the anti-Semitism of the novel is not presented so explicitly in the film, Clouzot made an addition to the film that has become its most famous – and notorious – aspect. The scene, not present in the novel, occurs during Loursat’s courtroom defence of Manu. Quiet during most of the proceedings, Loursat, in Raimu’s inimitably dramatic style, suddenly holds forth about the town’s lack of values, about parents’ lack of commitment to their children, about the number of bars and brothels: Gentlemen of the jury, can you show me the way to the stadium, the velodrome, the swimming pool? No, don’t try, there is no stadium, velodrome, or pool. There are 132 cafés and bistros, I counted them, and 4 bordellos – those, I didn’t count. My fellow citizens marked the path to them long ago. Gentlemen, when children cannot get drunk on fresh air and activity, they must seek recreation somewhere. They go to the movies and are spellbound by gangsters, when they are not aroused by the legs of the vamp. And one fine night these spectators, these children, become the actors, and they cover themselves with blood. And this mantle of blood – it is you, it is we – who have thrown it over their shoulders.36\n\nThe scene is generally understood as a Vichy-values speech. By and large, however, Continental films tended not to follow the same quest for morality and uplift as did explicitly Vichy films. It’s tempting to ‘excuse’ the scene by suggesting, for example, that the speech was written more to give Raimu the possibility of holding forth than to promote a moral agenda. And the antibourgeois politics of the scene could have appeared in another film of another time without suggesting a fascist agenda. But of course this wasn’t another time, and Clouzot’s screenplay, at least at the particular moment of the dramatic discourse, comes quite close to the propaganda that Continental was presumably so determined to avoid.37 Clouzot directed his first film for Continental in 1942. Like Le Dernier des six, L’Assassin habite au 21 was an adaptation of a mystery novel by Steeman, and like the previous film, it evoked the anger of Steeman, who protested about all of Clouzot’s adaptations that the director needed to ‘destroy’ in order to create.38 As in the earlier film, Clouzot partners detective Wens with Mila Malou, played once again by Fresnay and Delair. The setting of the film is moved from London to Paris (one clear taboo for Continental personnel was any mention of England that could be construed as favourable), and Wens is on the track of a serial killer who leaves his calling card, inscribed with the\n\n26\n\nL E C O R B E AU\n\nname ‘Monsieur Durand’, at the scene of every crime. Once again, Clouzot expands the film to include not only the mystery but also Mila Malou’s showbusiness career (matching Suzy Delair’s own off-screen singing career). Early in the film, Mila is trying to sell herself as a singer to an impresario, and he tells her that she needs to have a recognisable name, and to illustrate his point he grabs a newspaper and points to the story about the serial killer. Mila thus becomes as committed in her own way as Wens to solving the mystery, assuming that the fame she will acquire will assure her success on stage. Wens receives a tip that the killer is a resident of a pension at 21, rue Junot. He poses as a pastor and moves into the house, populated by an odd assortment of eccentrics, including Mlle Cuq (who describes herself as a ‘vraie jeune fille’), a writer who cannot get a manuscript accepted; a blind boxer, Kid Robert; a magician, Lalah-Poor; Linz, a former colonial officer; and Colin, who fabricates faceless dolls made to resemble what is known of the serial killer (i.e., nothing). Mila Malou quickly discovers that Wens is hot on the trail of the killer, so she too moves into the boarding house. The killings continue, and one seemingly false suspect is arrested after another. Almost at the same moment, Wens and Mila realise, separately, that the three men who have been arrested (Lalah-Poor, Linz and Colin), and then let go when another murder was committed during their jail time, are working in concert; Monsieur Durand is three men, not one. Wens is taken at gunpoint from the house once the killers realise he is on to them. Meanwhile, Mila, who has several opportunities to perform in the course of the film, begins to see multiples of ‘3’ everywhere she looks as she sings for the assembled guests at the boarding house. She takes the police to the place where the three men are holding Wens. Hence the crime is solved, and Wens and Malou are presumably happily reunited. L’Assassin habite au 21 continues the hybrid genre of mystery and comedy initiated by Le Dernier des six. While Clouzot is best remembered for Le Corbeau, he was arguably the individual most responsible for the immediate success of the comedy/mystery format that became popular during the Occupation. Mila Malou is as brassy, energetic and somewhat hysterical as she was in the earlier film, and her dialogue is witty and over the top. The film is as much about her and Wens’s relationship as it is about\n\nPRODUCTION CONTEXTS\n\n27\n\nthe solving of the crime, and that relationship has verbal sparring at its core. In some ways their repartee is reminiscent of American screwball comedies of the 1930s, like Bringing Up Baby and His Girl Friday. The comparison is not as far-fetched as it might seem initially. Since American films were banned in France during the Occupation, French directors could move into territories previously dominated by Hollywood films. And Greven was eager for French cinema to provide competition for American films in the ‘new Europe’. Although L’Assassin habite au 21 does not receive sustained treatment in Burch and Sellier’s analysis of the cinema during the Occupation, Clouzot’s first film as a director reveals many of the preoccupations that made films of the period so interesting for their representations of gender.39 Mila Malou may well be a stereotype of femininity, easily read in ‘either/or’ terms – either a stereotype of the ditzy female, or a stereotype so excessive that it (rather than she) is mocked. She is, nonetheless, an integral part of the intrigue of the film, and she and Wens solve the mystery separately, each on her/his own terms. The figure of Mlle Cuq, the unsuccessful mystery writer, is strongly suggestive of the kind of narrative authority often associated with women in Occupation cinema. She is murdered by ‘Monsieur Durand’ when she comes up with the idea to write a mystery about the boarding house itself, that is, when she comes dangerously close to uncovering the men’s secret before the detective or his companion do. There is also a strong element of what could be called, for lack of a better term,‘earthiness’ (or vulgarity) in the film, and most often the one who embodies it is Mila Malou, whether in her enthusiastic popping of blackheads on Wens’s forehead, or in her somewhat peculiar, and always energetic, turns of phrase. For instance, early in the film, during our first introduction to Mila Malou, the character is attempting to spark the interest of an impresario. She says: ‘You’re like the gardener who cultivates fragile little plants, like the little pile of manure that keeps the young shoots warm, and I’m the plant climbing upwards, toward the sky…I need a tutor, in other words, I’m like America before Christopher Columbus.’ This film is also set in the ‘contemporain vague’ of Occupation cinema, with one reference to 1930s French cinema (the name of the boarding house\n\n28\n\nL E C O R B E AU\n\nis ‘Pension Mimosas’, the title of a well-known 1935 film by Jacques Feyder) and another that contradicts the ‘vague present tense’ assumed to be characteristic of Occupation cinema. At the conclusion of L’Assassin habite au 21, the three murderers are caught as Mila Malou and the police come to the rescue of Wens. The three men are ordered to put up their hands, and the final image of the film shows Wens as he lowers the right arm of Lalah-Poor in order to light a match behind the murderer’s ear. Thus Lalah-Poor is standing, immobile, with his left arm extended in the air – performing the Nazi salute. There is an element of mockery in this moment, but one could hardly refer to this image in any kind of subversive way; rather it seems to indicate precisely the tone of dark humour that is so characteristic of Clouzot’s style. After the Liberation, one of the pieces of evidence brought against Clouzot was that he was seen making the Nazi one-armed salute, and one cannot help but wonder if the last image of the film was confused with the director himself. Given the popularity of the Delair–Fresnay duo in Le Dernier des six, it is not surprising that L’Assassin habite au 21 was a critical and popular success. A reviewer for Le Miroir de l’Ecran noted the delighted responses of viewers at the premiere of the film, in particular at how ‘amusing and witty scenes alternate judiciously with more severe and dramatic ones’, thus creating a ‘clever cocktail of humor and drama’.40 Clouzot’s directorial debut was praised as well. The reviewer for the collaborationist fan magazine Ciné-mondial noted that the director had a large role to play in the success of the film. ‘H.-G. Clouzot, neo-director, but also a screenwriter who knows his work, has put the finishing touches on a production that is dense, concise, mobile, varied, all in the service of a rich imagination.’41 Thus Clouzot’s directorial career was launched. Clouzot was focused on his film career, but he also continued his interests in the theatre. Before the premiere of L’Assassin habite au 21 on 8 July 1942, Clouzot’s play Comédie en trois actes, written for his friends Pierre Fresnay and Fresnay’s wife Yvonne Printemps, opened in March of that year. Clouzot may have worked consistently with a group of actors who admired and respected him, but L’Assassin habite au 21 also made evident Clouzot’s reputation as a demanding, sometimes violent, director. Suzy Delair describes how Clouzot was able to get the results he wanted: ‘Clouzot slapped\n\nPRODUCTION CONTEXTS\n\n29\n\nme. So what? He slapped others as well. He could only get the best out of his actors by hitting them…He was tough, but I’m not about to complain.’42 ‘He worked relentlessly, which made for a juicy spectacle,’ declared Pierre Fresnay in describing the director.‘That’s to say nothing of his taste for violence, which he never tried with me…’43 In February of 1943, Clouzot began to work on Le Corbeau, and the actors’ accounts describe a director who was brilliant and demanding, but who once again was physically abusive, and who created an atmosphere of dread on the set.44 One can see traces of his previous work in this film, but the lighthearted (if always a bit vulgar) comedy has virtually disappeared. Gone is the witty repartee between Suzy Delair and Pierre Fresnay, as if to suggest that the comedy/mystery genre was for Clouzot a stepping stone to a film that exemplifies film noir with its use of light and dark contrast and shadowy atmospheres, and its characters caught up in webs of deception. The project began when Clouzot read the initial script by Louis Chavance, who had written several scripts for Occupation films (although Le Corbeau, the final version co-authored with Clouzot, was the only film he made for Continental), including Marcel L’Herbier’s La Nuit fantastique (1942) and Jacques Becker’s Le Dernier atout (1942). According to Clouzot, no one at Continental was enthused by the project. Bauermeister (in charge of production) thought the subject was too ‘violent and hard’ and Greven deemed the film ‘extremely dangerous’. Yet Clouzot wanted to make what he called this ‘revolutionary’ film, and Greven reluctantly told him to go ahead with it.45 As we shall see in part 2, the preparation of the script of Le Corbeau involved a complex process of revision with screenwriter Louis Chavance, and the evolution of the script is enormously interesting in terms of assumptions about crime, gender and retribution. When Clouzot directed L’Assassin habite au 21, the budget was generous, and included materials that seemed extravagant by pre-war standards.46 While it is true that Continental always had access to materials that were otherwise restricted, things changed drastically during the war, and, by the time of the production of Le Corbeau, restrictions on electricity meant that films had to be shot at night, and actors worked on sets with little or no heat. The filming of Le Corbeau took place in Montfort-L’Amaury, a small town west of Paris.\n\n30\n\nL E C O R B E AU\n\nThe cast and crew went there by train, in the freezing cold, and often under the threat of air attacks. Any serious examination of French cinema of the Occupation raises a number of perplexing questions concerning our assumptions about the nature of collaboration and censorship. The most obvious answer to the question – how and why did the German Occupation of France ‘save’ French cinema? – seems at best insulting (the French were weak; the Germans took charge) and at worst an apology for the cinematic equivalent of making the trains run on time. As we have seen, the development of Continental films allowed the flourishing of French cinema for a variety of reasons, ranging from Greven’s own love of the cinema to the need to address the crises that affected French film in the 1930s, from the possibilities created for French artists through the absence of competition to the material possibilities provided by Continental. Le Corbeau is both typical and exceptional in its relationship to French Occupation cinema. It is ‘typical’ in the sense that it benefited from all of the factors that made Continental successful. But it is also exceptional for many reasons. It brings together some of the best features of Occupation filmmaking – the development of a film noir style, the thematisation of surveillance, the complexities of film narration in relationship to questions of gender and sexuality. If the film succeeds on its own terms, it is also exceptional in that it has come to stand so emblematically for the period of the German Occupation of France.\n\nNotes 1\n\n2 3\n\nThe most influential account of this change in how the period is understood is Paxton, Robert, Vichy France: Old Guard and New Order, 1940–1944 (New York: Columbia University Press, 1972).

Goebbels’s famous remark, that ‘only light, frothy and, if possible corny pictures are desired’ (cited in Ehrlich: Cinema of Paradox: French Filmmaking Under the German Occupation, p. 141), has been read as indicative of a profound difference of opinion between the two men, but Goebbels’s remarks have also been understood as insignificant in relationship to the French film industry.

Evelyn Ehrlich argues that German films did not attract large audiences, and that financial losses made it more urgent for Continental to produce French films with recognisable actors. Jacques Siclier, while noting that they were never as popular as French films, nonetheless states that German films were popular in France.

Signé: Illisible (1942) tells the tale of a series of kidnappings accompanied by anonymous letters. For a discussion of the film, see Burch, Noël and Geneviève Sellier, La Drôle de guerre des sexes du cinéma français 1930–1956 (Paris: Nathan, 1996), pp. 128–129. 29 As Evelyn Ehrlich puts it: ‘One obvious, but often forgotten point must be made at the outset: when the occupation began in 1940, no one knew it would only last four years. In fact, in 1940 it appeared likely than Germany would soon win the war and that France would be, indefinitely, an adjunct of the Third Reich’, Ehrlich: Cinema of Paradox: French Filmmaking Under the German Occupation, p. xiii.\n\nPRODUCTION CONTEXTS\n\n33\n\n30 According to Pierre Billard, cinema revenues in Paris went from 452 million francs in 1938 down to 257 million in 1940, and then rose steadily: 416 million in 1941, 707 million in 1942 and 915 million in 1943.

But, as is almost always the case in a successful mystery, the process of discovery is as important as the final result. Thus, the search for the guilty party in the film becomes a search for other truths concerning desire and authority, and the anonymous letters reveal much about a community with secrets to hide. The very beginning of Le Corbeau is instructive in this regard, since it sets the tone for virtually everything that follows. The two opening scenes present the spectator with two different, but related introductions to the film. The film begins with a title: ‘A little town, here or elsewhere.’ We see a long shot of a tower on a hill, and the camera moves down and to the left to show us the small town. The camera pauses when the cemetery comes into view. A dissolve to a large archway takes us to the interior of what we will soon discover is the cemetery. The camera once again moves left, and the arches of the walkway frame our view of the cemetery. As the camera moves, the music accompanying the scene, which up to this point has been fairly standard, light fare, switches suddenly to become ominous, as if to suggest a malevolent presence. The flat lighting of the opening shot of the town is replaced by strong light and dark contrast. The camera moves quickly to frame the wrought-iron gate that provides a connection to the immediate outdoor area. The music suddenly stops, as the door opens noisily. The church spire and bell tower are again revealed through the open archway. Thus we are given two views of\n\nTHE FILM\n\n35\n\nthe church, one from a long shot overlooking the town, the other from the interior of the cemetery with the accompaniment of some kind of mysterious presence. This prologue is a curious scene. Human presence is only implied; there are no actors present, no human movement, except for the opening of the wrought-iron door performed by an unseen hand. There is a palpable sense of unease created as the scene progresses. The prologue links the church with death; in both shots that comprise the film’s beginning, the camera moves left, framing the church in both shots from different distances. While it is true that several key scenes in the film take place in a church, religion has an important role in Le Corbeau only to the extent that it is one of many institutions seen as potentially corrupt. More important is the way in which a sunny image of a seemingly picturesque town dissolves into images that suggest foreboding and anxiety, as if beneath every surface some trouble lurks. Not only will Le Corbeau show us trouble beneath the surface, it will also undo a number of cultural stereotypes concerning power, morality and authority. After a dissolve to a country pasture where cows are grazing, the film provides us with a second expository scene that introduces us to the presumed hero of Le Corbeau, Dr Germain (played by Pierre Fresnay). In a country setting, three elderly women sit outdoors, waiting for news from Dr Germain. He emerges from the country house and tells one of the women that he saved the mother’s life. Her immediate response is accusatory – ‘Mon Dieu, docteur, vous n’avez pas fait ça’ (‘My God, doctor, you didn’t do that’) – and he is defensive as he warns that the woman’s daughter must wait a time before attempting to become pregnant again. At the end of this scene, as Dr Germain drives off in his car, we hear the bells ringing from the church tower seen in the earlier prologue, thus providing a sound link between the two scenes Like the town itself, Dr Germain has his own secrets, eventually revealed to the spectator as the traumatic loss of his wife and son by an overzealous doctor who was determined (and who failed) to save the child’s life at all costs. After a further introduction to the town – children leave school for lunch, visitors enter the hospital – as well as to other key figures in the film, Dr Germain returns to the hospital, where he is confronted by a suspicious\n\n36\n\nL E C O R B E AU\n\nadministrator who notes that he once again has saved the life of the mother (rather than that of the child). As the major and minor players in the film are introduced – Laura Vorzet, a social worker; Marie Corbin, a nurse and the sister of Laura; hospital administrators; a cancer patient; and his mother – it is clear that even before the mystery of the anonymous letters is presented as the central intrigue of the film, there is yet another mystery, and that is Dr Germain himself. He is presented as an outsider, a doctor whose preference for saving the life of the mother is considered suspicious. He takes no interest in the somewhat grisly fascination of his colleagues with a case of gangrene. He scolds the nurse Marie Corbin – who is herself presented as a bitter busybody – when he suspects she has stolen morphine. Yet if Germain is an outsider, the initial views we have of the hospital and its goings-on suggest that he is perhaps one voice of rationality in a world of corruption. The first scenes in the hospital also reveal that there is a connection between the doctor and Laura Vorzet, a connection first suggested by Marie Corbin. Laura asks her sister why she is so disagreeable with the patients, and Marie retorts by asking Laura why she is so friendly with Dr Germain. This exchange is typical of the way in which information and exposition are presented in the film, through gossip, suspicion and surveillance (Marie says she knows why Laura spends so much time at the hospital and threatens to tell Laura’s husband what is going on). While the circuit of knowledge may be unsavoury, Marie in this case is not wrong, and frequently in the film what appear to be rumours and false accusations have a basis of truth. Dr Germain and Laura, we soon discover, share a mutual attraction.\n\nA study in oppositions The early scenes of Le Corbeau follow Dr Germain through a series of encounters, from the birth to the hospital, and from the hospital to his residence in an apartment building overlooking a schoolyard. A series of bold oppositions is set up in these encounters. Indeed, Le Corbeau is a study in oppositions, apparent and real. In the prologue of the film, which moves\n\nTHE FILM\n\n37\n\nquickly from a peaceful view of a town to a far more ominous view, we are introduced to the notion of a world off-balance, projecting contradictory images. In the course of the film, the use of shadows and light and dark contrast emphasise that sense of a menacing reality, of a world visible and mysterious at the same time. A particularly important sequence in this regard occurs when Germain enters the apartment building. Our first introduction to Denise occurs here (her brother, the schoolmaster, has asked Germain to look in on her since she has been complaining of illness). As Germain enters the foyer of the building and mounts the stairs, we see teenaged Rolande, playing with her ball, as she tells Germain he received a letter that she has left in his room. In the shot reverse shot between them, streaks of light through window grilles cast deep shadows (Figures 1, 2). Rolande may well seem a suspicious character simply by virtue of her presence as an omnipresent busybody (thus she echoes Marie Corbin). But the fact that the entrance into this interior space is accompanied by a marked shift in light, from flat, exterior lighting (in the schoolyard) to this menacing realm of light and shadows, suggests trouble.\n\nFigure 1: Light and shadows: Rémy Germain (Pierre Fresnay) in the stairwell.\n\n38\n\nL E C O R B E AU\n\nFigure 2: Light and shadows: Rolande (Liliane Maigné) in the foyer.\n\nWhen Germain enters Denise’s room to examine her (and to discover that she is not ill, but interested in seducing him), the light/dark contrast is very much subdued, and Denise, in particular, is portrayed in flat, even lighting. Only when Laura shows up, on the pretext of bringing Denise some magazines but in fact to talk to Germain, does the lighting achieve the previous effects of high contrast and shadows. Germain and Laura move to the landing, and we see shadows of them projected against the wall as Laura tells him she has received an anonymous letter accusing her of being Germain’s mistress (Figure 3). She tells him that she cannot see him any more, and, as she descends the stairs, the light and dark contrast is also heightened. As at the beginning of the scene, Rolande stands in wait like a sentry as Laura leaves the building. The scene concludes as we see Rolande, continuing to bounce her ball, and Germain, going into his room. Rolande quietly mounts the steps and peers through the keyhole to watch as Germain opens the letter.1 In this scene, the light and dark contrast creates a visual distinction between Denise, on the one hand, and Laura and Rolande, on the other, with Germain the only figure who moves from one space to another, from the foyer\n\nTHE FILM\n\n39\n\nFigure 3: Laura Vorzet (Micheline Francey) and Germain.\n\nto Denise’s room and back again. This scene embodies what is the most distinctive style of the film, the use of light and dark contrast and shadows to create a world of suspicion and paranoia. Ginette Vincendeau has explored the aesthetic of French film noir insofar as it is an important aspect of French film of the 1930s and 1940s, and several of the elements that she designates as central to the film noir world of Duvivier’s Pépé le Moko (1937) are important in Le Corbeau as well: an ‘expressionist use of mise-en-scène and its interaction of lighting, performance and décor’ and ‘a deep-rooted pessimism’.2 While there are many examples of films noirs and film noir elements in French films of the 1930s, one of the overlooked aspects of Occupation cinema is the extent to which a film noir style worked in tandem with the preoccupation with crises of narrative authority and surveillance. There are noir elements in many films of the Occupation, particularly in those that mix genres, like La Main du diable and L’Assassin habite au 21. But as Vincendeau states,‘for genuine film noir during the Occupation, one has to turn to dramas such as Henri Decoin’s adaptation of Simenon’s Les Inconnus dans la maison (1942) and to Le Corbeau (1943)’.3 One of Clouzot’s, and Le Corbeau’s, distinct\n\n40\n\nL E C O R B E AU\n\ncontributions to the cinema is precisely the masterful articulation of film noir as both an aesthetic and a point of view. Between Denise and Laura, one would be hard-pressed to find a better example of the virgin and the whore dichotomy so typical of an entire tradition of female representation in the West: Denise is sexual, Laura is not; Denise wears a nightgown while Laura wears conservative dresses with tight necks; Denise is brunette, while Laura is blonde. The film adds a particularly interesting twist to this standard, if exaggerated, opposition, by staging the horizontal Denise against the vertical Laura! Denise spends the first part of the film quite literally in bed (Figure 4), and her physical affliction – the limp she has as a result of a car accident – is only visible when she emerges from bed, as if so startling a shift (from prone to vertical) required an equally striking physical manifestation. Laura, on the other hand, is first seen in the film upright, as she tends to her volunteer duties in the hospital, and then as she appears at the door to Denise’s room (Figure 5). The contrasts between the two women are sustained, in the early scenes of the film, by the horizontal/vertical distinction, with the accompanying\n\nFigure 4: Denise Saillens (Ginette Leclerc).\n\nTHE FILM\n\n41\n\nFigure 5: Laura at the door to Denise’s room.\n\ndistinction that Laura is mobile while Denise is confined (willingly, but still confined) to her bed. In a film preoccupied with deceit, it is no surprise that these scenes reveal deception, the most obvious of which is Denise’s pretence of illness so that she can get close to Dr Germain. But there are none of the effects one might expect to cast Denise as a villain, particularly insofar as light and dark contrast is concerned. Rather, Denise’s sexy bedroom pose is counterbalanced when we see Germain lean over her chest to listen to her breathing, and we see magazine pictures of movie stars arranged on her wall, as if she is a somewhat impressionable adolescent with a crush on the new resident of the building (Figure 6). But Laura is very much cast in these effects of light and dark contrast, despite the fact that her appearance and her presentation of herself as the victim of a malicious letter suggest a woman who has little to do with deception and malice. This, of course, is the film’s secret, that the stereotypical image of female goodness is in fact something else altogether. For the time being, the introduction of Rolande, bouncing her ball and watching everyone around her, allows for a suspicion\n\n42\n\nL E C O R B E AU\n\nof guilt, while the opposition embodied by Denise and Laura is already becoming undone. The character of Denise plays upon Ginette Leclerc’s cinematic persona as a vamp, a femme fatale (her most famous role prior to Le Corbeau was as the unfaithful wife in Marcel Pagnol’s La Femme du boulanger/The Baker’s Wife, 1938). Yet the role of Denise, and the fact that she has a permanent limp, lends Leclerc’s role an element of playing against type, particularly when she announces (to Germain, after they have slept together and he clearly is having second thoughts about their relationship): ‘You’ve seen me limp because I was in my bare feet, but when I put on my shoes, no one notices a thing. I spent five years getting to that point. I did it, and I had all of the men I wanted, me, the cripple! And every time, I was avenging myself on life.’ Raymond Chirat has pointed out that many actors in Le Corbeau – all of them well known to French audiences of the time – are played against type. Pierre Fresnay, as the sombre and haunted Germain, is a far cry from the dryly comical Wens of Le Dernier des six or L’Assassin habite au 21, and if he is\n\nFigure 6: Denise and Germain in Denise’s room.\n\nTHE FILM\n\n43\n\nconsidered a suspect (by the townspeople, and perhaps by spectators as well), his icy demeanour never really changes. Of Pierre Larquey, who plays Dr Vorzet, Chirat says that his ‘traditional good-naturedness, emphasized by his umbrella, his bowler hat and his well-trimmed beard, disappears as events unfold’.4 In other words, the manipulation of the personas of the actors contributes to the atmosphere of deceptive appearances and unexpected repressed desires in the film. Laura, meanwhile, stands as the polar opposite of Denise. She may not be a mother, but she embodies the Aryan ideal of womanhood so visible in Vichy propaganda of the time.5 In the course of the film, the roles of Denise and Laura are taken in unexpected directions, since Denise emerges from her femme fatale role – and her bed – as a presumably worthy companion to Dr Germain, while Laura’s immaculate persona conceals a deeply disturbed woman who initiates the flood of anonymous letters. If the two women’s roles are reversed in the film – the sexualised woman is really ‘good’, while the pure woman is really ‘bad’ – then other similarities between female characters speak not only to traditional stereotypes of women but also to their undoing. Two of the most likely villains in the film are the nurse Marie Corbin and the post office clerk Rolande. They share a strange kind of outsider status visà-vis sexuality – Rolande because she is younger than either Denise or Laura, Marie Corbin because she is older. But perhaps more important, they both embody a type – the surveilling female, obsessively interested in the affairs of others. Everyone watches everyone else in Le Corbeau, but in the case of these two female characters it is cause for a kind of pathology – and again, one that is undone in the film in the sense that they too are false leads.\n\nCrises of narrative authority If the women in Le Corbeau are part of a web of stark binary oppositions that are put into question in the course of the film, Dr Germain too is located within a binary opposition, as both the opposite and the parallel of Dr Vorzet. Immediately after Germain has read the first anonymous letter, which accuses him of ‘messing around’ with Laura Vorzet, there is a dissolve to the interior\n\n44\n\nL E C O R B E AU\n\nof the Vorzet residence, where Laura walks through the door with her husband, who has just returned from a medical conference. In parallel to the preceding scene in Germain’s room, Laura discovers an anonymous letter in the mailbox addressed to her husband. If Dr Germain appears to be a central narrative authority in the film, a logical assumption since his actions drive most of the opening scenes, the film now moves to a different level of narration by creating connections between the two male doctors. Dr Germain is an enigmatic individual, yet he is also the central link between the opening scenes of the film, from the child’s death in the countryside to the hospital, and from the hospital to the schoolyard and the apartment building. With the introduction of Dr Vorzet, another level of narration is introduced, one that regards Germain from the vantage point of his similarities to and differences from Dr Vorzet. Both men are connected to Laura, and they are both doctors. They are the first visible recipients of anonymous letters. But Vorzet is an old man, and while he constantly holds forth with philosophical and medical observations, Germain is reticent and rarely if ever talks about himself or his opinions. Sometimes when we see Germain and Vorzet together, in the same frame, they appear as two professionals exchanging words (with Vorzet exchanging far more than Germain does). But the striking use of contrast and shadows also affords us evocative looks at the two men, suggesting that the link between the two of them has to do with fundamental questions of power and desire.
