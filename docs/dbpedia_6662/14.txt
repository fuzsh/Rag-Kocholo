The Sarasota Millionaires of the Southern States Football League will play host to the Orlando Rage on Saturday night at 7 at Sarasota High's Ihrig Field.

Coming off its first bye week of the season, Sarasota (0-2) dropped a 26-13 decision to Fort Pierce Fire last Saturday. This will be the team's first home game since it suffered a 59-33 loss to the St. Pete Sharks in the league opener on Jan. 26

Tickets are $7 at the gate, but $5 tickets can be purchased in advance by visiting the team's apparel store or by contacting a Millionaire player/staff member. Parking is $3. Children (12-Under) receive free admission to home games.

The Orlando Rage is the same name of the Central Florida-based team in Vince McMahon's ill-fated XFL. The semi-pro team uses a similar logo and wears similar uniforms.
