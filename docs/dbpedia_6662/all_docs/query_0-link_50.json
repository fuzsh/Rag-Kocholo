For the past 4 years we have tried to keep tournament costs down by not requiring stay to play. In the beginning we felt this was a model that worked well, however as our tournaments have become more and more popular, the hotel properties have been less inclined to work with us and more inclined to raise their rates on tournament weekends. By switching to a stay-to-play model we can keep hotel costs at a reasonable rate that we can lock in and prevent hotel properties from gouging our participant families. We appreciate everyone’s understanding of the necessity of this move and we appreciate your patience as we navigate the housing agency process.\n\nReserve your spot with a $500 deposit today!
