PETERSBURG — The Chargers (2-0, 1-0) won their first Sunshine State Athletic Conference game of the season, rallying past the Out-of-Door Academy Thunder (2-2, 1-1) in the final seconds.\n\nKey drive: After an ODA punt, Shorecrest got the ball at the Thunder's 38 with under two minutes to play. Aided by a late hit that led to a first down, the Chargers won on a 25-yard field goal by Jesse Fox with 10 seconds left.\n\nStars of the game: Orrin Fredericks led Shorecrest with 59 rushing yards on 18 carries and scored both of his team's touchdowns … ODA's Gus Mahler threw a scoring pass to Joey Runge and Dakota Dickerson ran for a score.\n\nStats of the game: Shorecrest trailed by eight at the start of the fourth quarter … The Thunder amassed 224 yards of total offense to the Chargers' 193 … ODA picked off two Shorecrest passes and recovered a Charger fumble, but the Chargers also forced two turnovers and ODA missed two field goals."
