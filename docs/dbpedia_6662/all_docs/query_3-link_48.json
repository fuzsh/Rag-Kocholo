        "text": "2024 Season Countdown: #80 Henry Donohue\n\nName: Henry Donohue\n\nHeight: 5’11”\n\nWeight: 209 lbs.\n\nHigh school: Bronxville (NY) Bronxville\n\nPosition: Running back\n\nClass: Redshirt junior\n\nJersey number: #49\n\nLast year: I ranked Donohue #117 and said he would be a backup running back and special teamer (LINK). He had 1 carry for 3 yards.\n\nTTB Rating: N/A\n\nDonohue is a special teams player and running back who has earned carries for the past two seasons. Last year his lone carry came against UNLV, but he played special teams in five games overall. His role seems to be increasing some, and this year he added another seven pounds to his 5’11” frame. While he will never factor into the running back rotation – unless there’s a major spate of injuries – he might continue to see an increasing role on special teams units. This year will be tough to get on the field as a backup running back because the schedule is more difficult than in most recent years.\n\nPrediction: Backup running back, special teamer\n\n2024 Season Countdown: #81 Brooks Bahr\n\nName: Brooks Bahr\n\nHeight: 6’5″\n\nWeight: 298 lbs.\n\nHigh school: Lake Forest (IL) Loyola\n\nPosition: Defensive tackle\n\nClass: Redshirt freshman\n\nJersey number: #51\n\nLast year: I ranked Bahr #120 and said he would redshirt (LINK). He redshirted.\n\nTTB Rating: 71\n\nAfter being coached by former Illinois and NFL linebacker John Holecek in high school, Bahr was one of those tweener freshmen in 2023, the kind of player who comes in tall and somewhat thin (if 280 can be considered thin) and doesn’t really have a place. Does he lose weight and play defensive end? Or does he add weight to become a defensive tackle? Either direction was going to take some time, so Bahr redshirted.\n\nNow it’s 2024, and we see which direction Michigan has Bahr going: defensive tackle-ward. He’s up to 298 pounds this season, which is defensive tackle-adjacent, but it’s probably not where he needs to be to get on the field. At 6’5″ that’s not a ton of bulk. Add in the technique work he needed coming out of high school, and he probably still needs another year in the oven before he’s really ready for prime time. Bahr might start getting some snaps in certain situations, but I don’t think we’re going to see him on the field much in 2024.\n\nPrediction: Backup defensive tackle\n\n2024 Season Countdown: #82 Channing Goodwin\n\nName: Channing Goodwin\n\nHeight: 6’1″\n\nWeight: 185 lbs.\n\nHigh school: Charlotte (NC) Providence Day\n\nPosition: Wide receiver\n\nClass: Freshman\n\nJersey number: N/A\n\nLast year: Goodwin was a senior in high school (LINK). He made 65 catches for 1,094 yards and 14 touchdowns.\n\nTTB Rating: 72\n\nGoodwin is a Michigan legacy who seemed like a pretty good bet all along to end up as a Wolverine. Of course, that’s not always the case, because I thought the same thing about tight end Will Mallory back in 2018 – among others over the years – and I was wrong. (Mallory committed to Miami and made 115 catches for 1,544 yards and 14 touchdowns before being taken by the Colts in the 5th round in 2023.) But Channing played alongside quarterback Jadyn Davis, and why not go to the same school where you might be able to maintain the chemistry you developed in high school? It has seemed to work for Joe Burrow and Ja’Marr Chase as they moved from LSU to the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nGoodwin is not particularly big, nor is he particularly fast. Usually, it seems like you have to be one or the other to make a big impact as a freshman. While he may have been in line for more playing time prior to a couple transfers, the arrivals of C.J. Charleston (Youngstown State) and Amorion Walker (Ole Miss) to the receiving group make Goodwin a good redshirt candidate. I’m going to count on him being able to block since his dad was an NFL offensive lineman, so perhaps that will get him on the field early, but he probably won’t be a big factor in 2024.\n\nPrediction: Redshirt\n\n2024 Season Countdown: #83 Ike Iwunnah\n\nName: Ikechukwu Iwunnah\n\nHeight: 6’3″\n\nWeight: 313 lbs.\n\nHigh school: Garland (TX) Lakeview Centennial\n\nPosition: Defensive tackle\n\nClass: Redshirt junior\n\nJersey number: #92\n\nLast year: I ranked Iwunnah #79 and said he would be a backup nose tackle (LINK). He did not play in any games.\n\nTTB Rating: 75\n\nMichigan has been blessed the past few years by having some very good defensive tackles. The Wolverines have a couple potential first round picks in Mason Graham and Kenneth Grant, so it makes sense that a backup defensive tackle would have a hard time cracking the rotation. Graham and Grant are guaranteed snaps, and then everyone else is just going to fill in the gaps.\n\nBut this type of thing with Iwunnah doesn’t happen very often: he’s a fourth-year 300-pounder who has never played in a game for Michigan. When he arrived from Texas, he was going to be a bit of a project, so not playing in year one was somewhat expected. Then you think that type of guy will get a few snaps in year two, but not in his case. But surely in year three? Not so surely.\n\nSo now we’re entering year four, and I don’t know what to make of Iwunnah. Kris Jenkins and Cam Goode are gone, and Rayshaun Benny is the only heavy-rotation player still left behind the aforementioned Graham and Grant. Roderick Pierce will certainly play a role at nose tackle, but Michigan went after some defensive tackles in the portal and they were unsuccessful. The Wolverines were even messing around with walk-on Joey Klunder and defensive end-turned-defensive tackle Enow Etta in the spring game. Iwunnah got some snaps this spring, too, but it looks like he might be one of those guys who doesn’t really play at Michigan and then transfers to a MAC school as a grad transfer, like Keith Heitzman or Wyatt Shallman or Tom Strobel. This season I wouldn’t be surprised if a player like freshman Deyvid Palepale immediately steps in and passes Iwunnah on the depth chart, because something obviously isn’t clicking.\n\nPrediction: Backup defensive tackle"
