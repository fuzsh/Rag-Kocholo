        "text": "SARASOTA ― We have published lists of Sarasota and Manatee top football players by class and by position already this fall. Now it's time to rank the best of the best.\n\nThe Herald-Tribune looked at the rosters from the area's 18 high school football programs and determined which 15 athletes we think are the top players who will suit up on area fields this fall. And then we ranked the 15. We are calling this ranking The Big 15.\n\nHere's the Herald-Tribune's list of the Sarasota, Manatee area's The Big 15 football players.\n\nStream Florida high school football live on NFHS Network\n\nThe Big 15 football players in the Sarasota-Manatee area for 2024\n\n1. Winston Watkins Jr.\n\nVenice\n\nVitals: 5-foot-10, 174 pounds; Sr.\n\nCollege Offers: 31, including Ohio State, Penn State, Florida, and Texas\n\nLast season, playing for First Baptist in Naples, the cousin of former NFL wide receiver Sammy Watkins caught 61 passes for 1,170 yards and 13 TDs, returned seven punts for 278 yards, a 39.7-yard average, with two touchdowns, and returned 10 kickoffs for 408 yards, a 40.8-yard average. A 247 four-star recruit, the 5-foot-10, 174-pound Watkins will be used in a variety of ways by Venice head coach John Peacock, all to get him the football.\n\n“I want Venice to develop me into a man and a player and help me grow as a man,” Watkins said. “Teach me stuff about real life. What I’m going to do for Venice is I’m coming in to give them a dog; the best player they’ve ever had come through here. Break all the records, all that stuff, and win a championship.”\n\n2. Ean Johnson-Kelley\n\nManatee\n\nVitals: 6-foot-1, 275 pounds; Sr.\n\nCollege commitment: Mercer\n\nThe dominant 6-foot-1, 275-pound Hurricane defensive tackle recorded a team-high 53 tackles last season ― 16 for loss ― five quarterback sacks, 18 QB hurries, three recovered fumbles, two caused fumbles, a blocked punt, and a blocked field goal. In finishing 9-3, Manatee allowed an average of 107 rushing yards a game, despite allowing 324 in a loss to Venice. Ean-Kelley has started on the Manatee defensive line with teammate Alvoid Kennon since the two were freshmen. He’ll play collegiately at Mercer, but if not for football, he would like to enter a field focused on “making people happy,” said Ean-Kelley. “If they’re down, picking them up. Making them feel better. Probably counseling.”\n\nTop Seniors: Listing the top 52 Sarasota, Manatee area high school football seniors for the 2024 season\n\n3. Chris McCorkle\n\nCardinal Mooney\n\nVitals: 6-foot-2, 172 pounds; Jr.\n\nCollege commitment: University of Kansas\n\nOn both sides of the ball, Cardinal Mooney’s 6-foot-1, 172-pound junior caused trouble for opponents. At wide receiver, McCorkle caught 13 passes for 366 yards and seven touchdowns, including the winning touchdown catch in Mooney’s 31-27 state title win over Trinity Catholic. At cornerback, he had 24 tackles, a team-high eight interceptions, 18 passes defended, and one caused fumble. He considers himself, first and foremost, a defensive player.\n\n\"I tell coaches I'm a D-back; I tell coaches I'm a defensive player,\" he said. \"I can play both sides. If they need me to do that, I can do that. It really doesn't matter. I just want to play football.\" McCorkle will be telling this to coaches at the University of Kansas, to which he has committed.\n\n4. Jamarice Wilder\n\nVenice\n\nVitals: 5-foot-9, 196 pounds; Sr.\n\nCollege commitment: James Madison\n\nThe explosive and shifty 5-foot-9, 196-pound running back led Venice last season with 1,271 yards on 149 carries, an 8.5-yard average. Including his four points on conversions, Wilder’s 154 points scored was 56 higher than the next Venice player, wide receiver CJ Lewis with 98. Nicknamed “Gator” as a child by his grandmother for how wide he opened his mouth when he cried, he will always remember the football program pushing him to be the best running back he could be.\n\n“And I actually thank coach P (Peacock) a lot for doing that,” Wilder said. “Coach P is basically like a little Nick Saban. Everybody on the team has their specific job. But it’s to the point where everybody knows their role and knows their job. And they do it.”\n\n5. DJ Johnson\n\nRiverview\n\nVitals: 5-foot-11, 180 pounds; Sr.\n\nCollege Offers: 3, Keiser University, Gardner-Webb University, and Warner University.\n\nThe 5-foot-11, 180-pound shifty and surprisingly strong tailback led the Rams in rushing last season with 1,660 yards on 233 carries, an average of 7.1 yards per rush, with a team-high 23 touchdowns. And this season, “Deanwar” Johnson also will start at cornerback for Riverview. If football wasn’t in his future, he said he would have joined the Marines, just like his uncle, Tony Johnson. Despite playing for Riverview, Johnson attends Sarasota Military Academy. Among his many qualities as a football player, Johnson said single-mindedness ranks right at the top.\n\n“I think it’s my determination and my drive to get extra yards and just not to be afraid of contact,” he said. “Every single second, I’m giving it 100 percent.\"\n\n6. Andrew Heidel\n\nManatee\n\nVitals: 6-foot-2, 205 pounds; Sr.\n\nCollege commitment: Army\n\nAs a two-year starter at quarterback for Manatee, Heidel has a record of 15-7. In leading Manatee to a 9-3 record last season, he completed 206 of 318 for 2,618 yards, 20 TDs, and six interceptions. Heidel finished with a QB rating of 103.5. Running the ball he scored five touchdowns. The rising senior has committed to Army, and with good reason.\n\n\"My grandfather served in Vietnam,” Heidel said, “so it’s kind of an opportunity to carry on that legacy of serving. I actually wasn’t (interested), but when Army talked to me, I thought, ‘Wow, this is a pretty good deal.’’’\n\n7. Asharri Charles\n\nVenice\n\nVitals: 6-foot-3, 225 pounds; Jr.\n\nCollege Offers: 13, including Duke, Florida, FSU, Louisville, Miami, and USF.\n\nThe question might be, what can Asharri Charles do for an encore? Last season, as a sophomore, the 6-foot-3, 225-pound, four-star defensive end led Venice with 11 quarterback sacks. Charles had 98 tackles, 15.5 for loss, 13 QB hurries, and one fumble recovery.\n\n“I say speed; I’m always faster than the guy in front of me,” Charles said when asked his No. 1 attribute as a defensive end. “Let’s say it’s third-and-15, if I know it’s a pass, I know I have to be at a certain point to get under him to get to the quarterback. So I use my speed to make me into a ghost and I dip under him and I’m up there with the quarterback.” So, what can Charles do this season after a great 2023? “I’m just expecting to elevate,” he said. “I’m going for 20 sacks this season, and just go up from there.”\n\nTop Juniors: Listing the top 41 Sarasota, Manatee high school football juniors to watch for 2024 season\n\n8. Kevontay Hugan\n\nBooker\n\nVitals: 6-foot-3, 245 pounds; Jr.\n\nCollege Offers: 16, including Miami, Penn State, Louisville, USF, and USC.\n\nAs a sophomore last season, the 6-foot-3, 245-pound defensive end finished with 46 tackles,16.5 for losses. Hugan added 5.5 quarterback sacks, four hurries, two passes defended, and one fumble recovery. On offense, in goal-line situations, Hugan carried the ball five times for 8 yards, but with four touchdowns. Another score came via an interception return. Hugan, who played baseball and ran track before settling on football, said he likes the teamwork involved in the sport, “and where football could take you.” If football wasn’t in his future, he would study business. “Have my own business,” he said. “Have my own clothing brand.”\n\n9. Eli Jones\n\nVenice\n\nVitals: 6-foot-4, 240 pounds: Sr.\n\nCollege commitment: USF\n\nAfter recording five tackles as a freshman and two as a sophomore, the 6-foot-4, 240-pound defensive end exploded last season, registering 117 tackles, five sacks, eight quarterback hurries, a forced fumble, and two fumble recoveries. Jones teamed with fellow defensive end Asharri Charles to combine for 215 tackles and 8.5 quarterback sacks. Jones will play collegiately at USF, but will never forget his time at Venice, or the first thing that will cross his mind when he thinks of the program.\n\n“I think family,” he said. “I think toughness, I think that’s also a big thing. Tough love, I think that’s one of the main things. They love you, but they’re going to coach you hard. You can’t take anything personally. If you screw up, you’ve got to screw up at 100 percent, and then fix it.”\n\n10. Devin Mignery\n\nCardinal Mooney\n\nVitals: 6-foot, 215 pounds; Jr.\n\nCollege commitment: None\n\nSplitting time at quarterback last season with Michael Valentino, Mignery completed 72-of-141 passes for 1,303 yards, 12 touchdown passes, and three interceptions for the state-champion Cougars. Running the ball, Mignery finished second on the Cougars, rushing for 896 yards on 88 carries and 10 touchdowns. The Cougars got Sarasota transfer quarterback Devin Davidson, a highly touted 6-foot-5 sophomore, but this season, the keys to the Mooney offense will be held by the 6-foot, 215-pound junior. Mignery said winning a state title has brought the program more attention. \"But I would say that more than anything,\" he said, \"it brought us closer as a team. Attracted more attention to this year’s team, which we got to live up to.\"\n\n11. Gage Cameron\n\nParrish\n\nVitals: 5-foot-11, 200 pounds: Sr.\n\nCollege Offer: Shorter University\n\nThe Bulls’ captain at middle linebacker finished last season with a team-high 128 tackles (48 solo, 80 assists), 15 tackles for loss, 3.5 sacks, nine quarterback hurries, two passes defensed, four forced fumbles, and one blocked punt. The 5-foot-11, 200-pounder was selected as a 2023 All-FACA Team Linebacker and was a finalist for the Herald-Tribune Defensive Player of the Year. Cameron said his head coach Dylan Clark has been the most influential head coach he’s ever had.\n\n“Coach Clark has been my No. 1 supporter since he came in,” Cameron said. “He’s always been up and personal with me, asking me questions, asking how I am every day and always trying to get me to be the best person, best player I can be, and just get to where I want to be. I think Coach Clark is the best coach I’ve ever had.”\n\n12. Jayce Nixon\n\nVenice\n\nVitals: 6-foot, 195 pounds; Sr.\n\nCollege commitment: Northern Iowa\n\nNixon will become the latest quarterback to lead the Venice offense after transferring in. Last year, as a junior for Tampa Gaither, the 6-foot, 185-pounder completed 246 of 363 passes for 3,172 yards, 29 touchdowns, and six interceptions. Nixon also ran 66 times for 404 yards and five touchdowns, providing the dual threat Venice head coach John Peacock prefers in his quarterbacks. Having already secured a scholarship to Northern Iowa before taking a snap at Venice, Nixon said his goal is to bring the program another state title.\n\n“That’s what I want to do for Venice,” he said. “And Venice, for me, really, just getting my body right and getting me in the best shape I’ve been in my life and getting me ready for college. I think I came in at 185 pounds, and I’m like 195 now.”\n\n13. Allen Clark\n\nOut-of-Door Academy\n\nVitals: 6-foot, 200 pounds; Jr.\n\nCollege Offer: FAU\n\nThe bruising 6-foot, 200-pound running back led the Thunder last season with 1,104 yards on 163 carries, an average of 6.8 yards per rush. The sophomore Clark had five games of 100 or more yards and finished with a team-high 17 touchdowns. Also played outside linebacker for ODA, registering 21 tackles. Has an offer from Florida Atlantic. He said his head coach Rob Hollway has been his biggest influence. “He wants the best for me, and when you have a coach like that . . . “ Clark said. “He pushes us. Everybody needs to be pushed a little bit.”\n\n14. Brunno Reus\n\nVenice\n\nVitals: 6-foot, 190 pounds; Sr.\n\nCollege commitment: USF\n\nOne of the best kicker/punters in the state, Reus last season for Braden River had a 42-yard punting average and was 33 of 34 on PATs and field goals. On kickoffs, he recorded touchbacks 88% of the time. Receiving five stars for his kicking and punting by the prestigious Kohl Kicking Camps, Reus will kick next year in Raymond James Stadium for the USF Bulls. Reus, a former soccer player from Brazil, credits former Pirates kicker and assistant Kyle Thoma with getting him kicking a football. \"I was actually kicking a football in PE class as a freshman just for fun,\" Reus said. \"He told me to come to practice and taught me how to kick. The form (in kicking a football) is way different than a soccer ball.\"\n\n15. Lucas Despot\n\nBraden River\n\nVitals: 6-foot-2, 195 pounds; Sr.\n\nCollege Offer: Shorter University\n\nAfter playing in two games in 2023 for the Pirates as a sophomore, Depot, in 10 games last season, completed 126 of 215 passes for 1,619 yards and 18 touchdowns, with just five interceptions, for a QB rating of 100.5. Despot said his father has been the most important person in his football development.\n\n“He just pushed me every day; I love him to death,” he said. “I don’t think I’d be where I’m at in football without him. Ever since I was younger, he’s always done extra work with me. No matter what anybody else was doing, we were always doing more.”\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.
