        "text": "Manchester United are looking at multiple options to bolster their midfield.\n\nThe club were interested in signing Paris Saint-Germain’s Manuel Ugarte but have pulled out of talks. They have no intention of meeting the £52 million asking price.\n\nYoussouf Fofana is one of the alternative choices on their radar. Sky Sports claims United have held initial talks with Monaco over signing the France international.\n\nFofana would be a good signing for United\n\nUgarte was open to joining the Red Devils, but the price tag has put them off signing him.\n\nThe club are now exploring alternatives. Fofana would be a good acquisition for the Red Devils, considering his strong defensive attributes which could suit the Premier League.\n\nFofana won an average of two tackles, 4.7 duels and made 7.2 recoveries last season. He completed 60 percent of his dribbles and impressed with his high pressing.\n\nThe Frenchman does have the tendency to lose possession, but he makes up for it with his tireless work rate. He would be a good upgrade on Casemiro and Scott McTominay.\n\nMonaco raised their asking price to £30m last month, but United can afford this and may try to push through a deal soon.\n\nThe 25-year-old iis in the prime of his playing career. He would represent a better signing than Sander Berge, who had an average campaign at Burnley last season.\n\nStats from Sofascore.com."
