        "text": "Snapshot of the NBA\n\nThere are 30 teams in the NBA that are evenly split between the East and West conferences. 29 of the NBA teams are based in the USA, with one solitary Canadian team - the Toronto Raptors. California has four NBA teams (which is the most in any state) while Texas has three. 11 NBA teams share their arena's with NHL teams, while the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles is the home to three teams; the LA Lakers, the LA Clippers and the LA Kings of the NHL.\n\nNBA game attendances range from 15,000 up to 20,000 at the United Center, home of the Chicago Bulls. The most successful teams in the NBA are the Boston Celtics and the LA Lakers who have both won 17 NBA Championships, however, success isnât very well spread throughout the league with one third of all NBA teams having never won, including big teams like the Phoenix Suns and the Brookyln Nets."
