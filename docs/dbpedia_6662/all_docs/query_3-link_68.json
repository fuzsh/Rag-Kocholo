        "text": "On fields across America, Pop Warner is continually making our game safer and better, while retaining what makes the sport of football so great for young people. And weâ€™re doing the same for our young athletes in cheer and dance.\n\nLeagues have options with how to structure their program. While leagues can continue the current structure where a player is placed in a division based on his or her age and weight, they may also instead choose to register players based on age only. Currently, an estimated 75-80% of youth football nationally follows an age-only structure."
