David Irving has been removed from his head coaching responsibilities and reassigned to a new position within the organization.\n\nThe Roughnecks have already begun the process of hiring a new coach, and it is planned that a new hire can be in place by December 1.\n\nIrving will now serve in the new role of Director of Football Operations/Technical Director. The new position will allow the club to have another person working with soccer operations year round.\n\n“The 2016 season did not go as we planned, and we are making these changes and additions to our operational staff to improve our on-field results,” said Brian Carroll. “The expansion of our staff will allow us to devote more people and more hours into building our team.”\n\n“We appreciate all of David’s efforts in the role of our first-ever head coach. He was invaluable in helping us get started and fielding our team in our inaugural season.”\n\n“We are also excited about the changes and our future possibilities. We look forward to bringing a new coach to the club that will build a squad that can compete for a USL playoff spot and a league championship.”\n\nThe Roughnecks will begin their third season of play in the United Soccer League in March of 2017.\n\nThe Tulsa Roughnecks announced today that the club is making changes to its on-field staff.

You can’t do that. That’s been our Achilles’ heel. It’s been a challenging year for everyone – the organization, the players, me – everyone.”\n\nWith the win, Sacramento (14-6-10) moved into first place in the Western Conference standings, at least temporarily, pending the results of Colorado Springs’ later game against Orange County.\n\nThe lone bright spot for the Roughnecks on this night was the play of rookie goalkeeper Hunter Harrison, who made his first appearance of the season coming in to replace starter Jake Feener after halftime.\n\nHarrison, who played a year at Oral Roberts University and spent most of the season as the Roughnecks’ third goalkeeper, made three saves on the night, all of them difficult ones, and was named the Roustabouts’ “Man of the Match.”\n\nThe Sacramento Republic FC jumped out to a 2-0 lead after just 19 minutes, carried a 3-0 advantage into halftime and closed out the Roughnecks’ second United Soccer League season with a 4-0 triumph Saturday night in front of 4,158 faithful fans at ONEOK Field.\n\nTulsa finished the campaign with a final record of 5-21-4.\n\nPhoto Left of Kaleem by Lori Scholl\n\n“All the interviews that we had this year could be the same interview,” said Coach David Irving. “It’s the same story, we give three goals away.

It also takes a lot of help from your teammates to keep your confidence going when you’re not playing. And when you get your chance, you have to go out there and play, and once I got in, I was able to show something.”\n\nPhoto Right of Hunter Harrison by Rich Crimi\n\nSacramento controlled the ball for much of the first half and went ahead just 10 minutes into the match. James Kiffe fed a pass from the left into the middle, where Mackenzie Pridham volleyed it waist-high from 10 yards out. The shot went down and bounced up and over Feener.\n\nThe Republic went up 2-0 in the 19th minute on Cameron Iwasa’s team-leading 12th goal of the season. Iwasa carried into the middle and drilled a shot from 20 yards out that took a deflection off a Tulsa defender leaving Feener with no chance as the ball rolled in off the left goalpost.\n\nTulsa’s deficit grew to three in the 35th minute after a foul by Kaleem, which earned him a yellow card and gave the Republic a free kick in the middle of the field about, 22 yards out. Daniel Barrera, the USL’s assists leader, took an impressive left-footed shot that curled around the wall of Roughneck defenders, past the diving Feener and just inside the right post.\n\nAfter halftime, Irving inserted Harrison in place of Feener, and he made his first professional save in the 55th minute, a sliding, point-blank stop on Pridham.\n\n“That was always in our plans,” Irving said of playing Harrison in the finale. “We weren’t going to make the playoffs, and he’s done well. He’s trained with us, he’s worked out every day and he’s young. He was at ORU, and he did very well, no complaints. He enjoyed it too. He was a little nervous, but he got his feet wet, as you might say.”\n\nHarrison came up big again in the 68th minute, making back-to-back stops. Octavio Guzman’s pass from the left side found Michael Da Fonte in the middle, about 10 yards out, for a header that forced Harrison to make a leaping save, deflecting the ball up and off the crossbar. The rebound bounced right out to Iwasa for a point-blank volley, and Harrison reached up for a left hand save while down on the ground as the offside flag went up.\n\n“It felt nice to finally play in my first game,” Harrison said. “It’s been a year since I played, so it takes hard work, a lot of training, a lot of progress.

The Roughnecks failed to convert a first-half penalty and missed several other scoring opportunities in the shutout loss. It was the sixth time in the past seven outings that TRFC has failed to find the back of the net.\n\nMatch Photos courtesy of Darren Abate/San Antonio FC\n\nThe missed penalty came in the 12th minute when Kaleem was tripped in the left corner of the penalty area. Captain Sammy Ochoa stepped to the spot and blasted his effort just to the right of goalkeeper Matt Ardone. Ardone easily made the save, his fourth save of a PK this season, to keep the match scoreless.\n\nTwo minutes later, the Roughnecks had another chance to take the lead when Ochoa fed Carlos Martinez in space at the edge of the box. But, Martinez fired high over the goal.\n\nTulsa defender Gary Cennerazzo made an effort to produce the first goal of the match in the 25th minute. His low shot from 35 yards was saved by Ardone.\n\nThe Roughnecks benefited from the woodwork in the 35th minute to keep the match scoreless. Rafael Castillo’s rolling shot beat Tulsa goalkeeper Alex Mangels but bounced off the post. It was the second close call for Castillo as he had hit the crossbar earlier in the game.\n\nIt took San Antonio only five minutes after the halftime break to take the lead, on what appeared to be a harmless corner kick. The cross came near four Roughnecks defenders, but the group could not clear the danger as the ball was poked to Franck Tayou. The SAFC forward hit a soft, left-footed shot that got past Tulsa goalkeeper Alex Mangels for the first goal of the match.\n\nThe Tulsa Roughnecks inability to score goals continued to haunt them Saturday night in a 2-0 loss in San Antonio.

Chin’s low shot beat Jake Feener to make it 2-0. Feener had just checked into the game after Mangels went down with an apparent leg injury.\n\nIt was the final road match of the season for the Roughnecks. They will now return to Tulsa for the final two games of the season.
