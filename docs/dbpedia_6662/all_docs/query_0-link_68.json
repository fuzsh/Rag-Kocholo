        "text": "Miami Dolphins National Football League franchise in Miami\n\n0 0\n\nrank #1 · 1\n\nThe Miami Dolphins are a professional American football franchise located in the Miami metropolitan area. The Dolphins are a member of the East division of the American Football Conference (AFC) in the National Football League (NFL). The Dolphins play their home games at Sun Life Stadium in the northern suburb of Miami Gardens, and have their headquarters in Davie, Florida. The Dolphins and the Atlanta Falcons (who also began play in 1961) are the oldest NFL franchises in the Deep South, and Miami is the oldest AFC team in that region. However, of the four AFC East teams, they are the only team in the division that was not a charter member of the AFL.\n\nAmerican football teams established in 1966 · 8T\n\n1966 establishments in Florida · 53T\n\nAmerican football teams in Miami, Florida · 10T\n\nOrlando Thunder World League of American Football team\n\n0 0\n\nrank #4 ·\n\nThe Orlando Thunder was a member of the World League of American Football from 1991 to 1992 (known as NFL Europe from 1995 onwards). The team played their games in the 70,000 seat Citrus Bowl, and was coached by Don Matthews in 1991 and Galen Hall in 1992. The team's most visible point was their colors – the League wanted to develop new colors which hadn't been used for teams before, hence the vermilion and green that the Raleigh-Durham Skyhawks wore, and the fluorescent green jerseys that the Thunder sported.\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers National Football League franchise in Tampa, Florida\n\n0 0\n\nrank #5 · 2\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers (often shortened as the Bucs) are a professional American football franchise based in Tampa, Florida. The Buccaneers currently compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member team of the National Football Conference (NFC) South division. Along with the Seattle Seahawks, the team joined the NFL in 1976 as an expansion team. The Bucs played their first season in the American Football Conference (AFC) West division as part of the 1976 expansion plan, whereby each new franchise would play every other franchise over the first two years. After the season, they switched conferences with the Seattle Seahawks and became part of the NFC Central division. During the 2002 league realignment, the Bucs joined three former NFC West teams to form the NFC South. The club is owned by the Glazer family, and plays its home games at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa.\n\nAmerican football teams established in 1976 · 5T\n\nAmerican football teams in Tampa, Florida · 7T\n\n1976 establishments in Florida · 56T\n\nBlacktips (FXFL) Professional American football team\n\n0 0\n\nrank #7 ·\n\nThe Florida Blacktips are a professional American football team, operating as a traveling team. They are a charter member of the Fall Experimental Football League, which is trying to become the developmental league for the National Football League. They were to play their home games at FIU Stadium in Miami, also the home to the FIU Panthers football and track and field teams. However, it was announced on September 22, 2014, that the Blacktips would drop 'Florida' from its name and play a truncated road schedule of only three games. The Blacktips' inaugural season began on October 15, 2014. They finished the 2014 season in last place at 0 - 3.\n\nMiami Caliente Sports Team\n\n0 0\n\nrank #8 ·\n\nMiami Caliente was a team in the Lingerie Football League, 2009-2010. They were part of the Lingerie Bowl's expansion into a full-fledged league in 2009. They played their home games at the BB&T Center in Sunrise, Florida. The head coach, Bob Hewko, was a quarterback for the University of Florida and was a back-up quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers."
