        "text": "SARASOTA -- Some may think of him as the quiet kid of the bunch. Others may think he was a leader by example.\n\nBut only a few have come to acknowledge Cory Reeves as the unsung hero of the Out-of-Door Academy boys basketball team.\n\nDavid Rodriguez and Paul Terminello are often credited with lifting the ODA basketball program to new heights this past season.\n\nBut while his teammates receive the kudos, Reeves, who graduated last month, finished as ODA's career assist and 3-point field goal leader.\n\n\"I never cared for the recognition or tried for it,\" the 18-year-old said. \"I'd rather just play basketball and do the best I can to help my team out.\"\n\nReeves has been playing basketball ever since he can remember. His father played in college before transferring to Ohio State University to study business.\n\nReeves and his family moved from Cleveland to Sarasota in 2000, when he enrolled at ODA for his eighth-grade year.\n\nIn his first year at the school, he and teammate Joe Doyle led the eighth-grade basketball team to a 19-1 record.\n\nHe moved up to the varsity as a freshman and became ODA's starting point guard as a sophomore. That year the lefty set the school's single-season assist record.\n\n\"He (Reeves) is a very coachable young man and was absolutely the quiet leader on our team,\" ODA head basketball coach Todd Radford said. \"He was just very unselfish and did all he could to make the guys around him better.\"\n\nODA and its boys basketball team soon becoming the talk of the school. The addition of Terminello to the Thunder gave the squad a big man in its lineup.\n\nPrior to his junior year, Reeves and his teammates had never beaten Sarasota Christian or Bradenton Christian. Heading into the 2004 district tournament, the two Class A schools were ranked sixth and seventh in the state.\n\nThe Thunder upset archrival Sarasota Christian in the district semifinals and the squad then won its first and only district championship, beating Bradenton Christian in the title game.\n\n\"I feel good about all that we accomplished our junior year, but I'm ready to move on,\" Reeves said. \"That whole season was unbelievable because of all that was unexpected from us. To beat both of those teams in the district, there's nothing better than that.\"\n\nODA went from having empty bleachers to packed houses every time it played.\n\nAway from the attention that surrounded some of his teammates, Reeves led by example.\n\n\"I was never the most athletic or most talented kid out on the court, but I played smart and did what I had to do for the team,\" Reeves said. \"I'm happier with 10 assists than 20 points because that's what's best for my team.\"\n\nNot only did his junior season result in a breakout year for ODA basketball, but Reeves also had a breakout year himself.\n\nIn his second season piloting the Thunder offense, the 5-foot-10 guard set the school's single-season 3-point percentage record connecting on 50 percent of his shots from beyond the arc. ODA won 20 games for the first time in school history and the program itself, thanks to Reeves and his teammates, soared to new heights on the hardwood.\n\n\"Cory's strong suit was definitely dishing the ball and finding the open man, but he could score and shoot the ball very well,\" Radford said. \"There's no doubt that he and his teammates put ODA on the map because they did the things that were necessary to become good players.\n\n\"Our young guys in the program know that there will be big shoes to fill next season and that's a great thing to have on any team.\"\n\nReeves has left behind his own legacy at ODA for years to come.\n\nHe holds the top three single-season assist records at the school and dished out 147 this year. He is the career assist (423) and 3-point field goal leader at ODA (111).\n\nReeves also set the record for single-season field goal percentage as he made 52 percent of his attempts this year. He averaged six points and six assists per game as a senior.\n\n\"My dad is the one who has always been there no matter what I've done or where I've been in life,\" Reeves said. \"He's there to help me when I need help and is there to play ball with me when I want to play.\"\n\nReeves also played on the ODA golf team and was the No. 1 player for his junior and senior years. The team advanced to the region tournament for the first time this season.\n\nHe plans on attending Ohio State University next fall and will be a part of the business administration and management program."
