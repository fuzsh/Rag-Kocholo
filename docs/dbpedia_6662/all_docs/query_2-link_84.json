        "text": "OUR HISTORY\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Mark LaPrade decided to create a dealership that would offer a customer more than just a place to buy a boat. Mark believed back then as he does now if you’re out to make a customer for life, everything else will take care of itself. Mark has since passed the business on to his daughter Tracie and her husband Steve and their philosophy are the same. At Thunder Marine, it is not just the boats that we sell, but how we do business. No matter which one of our great brands you are interested in - Sportsman, Monterey, Regulator or Jeanneau – your experience with Thunder Marine will be more of a relationship than a transaction. We believe your boating experience is more than just a weekend excursion; it is a lifestyle of fun and adventure."
