        "text": "SARASOTA, Fla. (WWSB) - Nate Strawderman is on the move once again. The former Bradenton Christian School (BCS) Panthers football program head coach is joining the Out-of-Door Academy Thunder’s football program as the Associate Head Coach.\n\nStrawderman confirmed this information to our ABC7 Sports Dept. on Tuesday afternoon. He says he’s ecstatic to join Coach Rob Hollway’s staff.\n\nThis move comes just months after Strawderman stepped down as the head coach at BCS to become the new offensive coordinator at Southeast High School under head coach Curt Bradley.\n\n“Southeast is amazing,” Strawderman said. “Coach Bradley is amazing. We talked about what my future looks like and [me] being 26 years old and setting up the foundation for my coaching career. We talked about what the upcoming Fall looks like, and Out-of-Door Academy came up and they offered something big.”\n\nFor Strawderman, this also somewhat of a homecoming to a place he knows well. He played at the quarterback position for the Thunder at the beginning of his high school career. “It’s super cool,” Strawderman said. “It’s going back to the stomping grounds where I started my high school career. It’s really cool to reminisce on that and be able to say I played here and I get to be a big part of this program.”\n\nAside from joining the coaching staff, Strawderman will also be joining ODA as an employee at the school by working in the school’s athletic department."
