        "text": "âPutting Kids Firstâ is the âmottoâ which the Police Athletic League (PAL) relies heavily on by using athletics and recreational activities to tighten the bond between police officers and children in the community. PAL is based on the belief that children, if reached early enough, can develop a strong, positive, attitude towards law enforcement.\n\nThe Police Athletic League uses athletic and recreational programs as a tool, a way to involve children in the program. While involved with PAL, the message of avoiding gangs, drugs, alcohol, and other detriments, is discussed with the youngsters. Although nationally known as a recreation program, the Police Athletic League has adapted to the changing times. PAL programs now incorporate mentoring life skills and homework help, to further aid our children.\n\nStudies show that if a youngster responds to a police officer in a positive way on the ball field or in the classroom, he or she will very likely come to respect the laws that a police officer enforces. Such benefit to the youngsters and to the neighborhood and business community in which they grow up is virtually immeasurable.\n\nPAL of Manatee County offers flag football, basketball, and baseball. Our current membership is 1,200.\n\nIn Florida, there are 54 PAL chapters, serving over 275,000 children."
