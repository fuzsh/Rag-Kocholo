        "text": "“Tyler and I were both Delivery Managers together at Bluewolf, which meant he and I were regularly collaborating to enhance the ways our respective teams sold and executed projects. He attacked internal challenges with the same vigor and relentlessness as he would a client engagement. What impressed me most was his dedication to improving the customer experience by improving the employee experience. He was very adamant that in a professional services industry where people are the product, customer experience equals employee experience. Tyler’s ability to empathize with all parties enables him to design experiences with maximum impact.”\n\n“I worked closely with Tyler since the day he was hired into my delivery organization at Bluewolf. When we decided to expand open an office in Denver, I nominated Tyler to be a founding member of office because he had great technical skills, he was already a cultural leader and I could easily picture him being the leader of the Denver a large successful practice. As a Delivery Leader, he had the dual role of partnering with Denver based sales reps to bring in new business and hiring and mentoring a local delivery team. Within just a couple of years Denver had an enviable culture and client list that continued to renew and grow their contracts year after year. Denver grew revenue by over 40% year over year, all while remaining profitable and having the lowest employee attrition rates of any other office in Bluewolf -- a metric I know he takes great pride in. I strongly recommend Tyler for for his entrepreneurial spirit that is rooted in technical skills, management and cultural leadership, his ability to assist in sales cycles and his focus on critical business metrics.”"
