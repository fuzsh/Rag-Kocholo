        "text": "The landscape of youth soccer and especially young girl's soccer is full of mediocrity. Players are not challenged or held accountable. Technical coaching usually misses 1 or 2 of the main coaching points. Worst of all, players are often praised when they play at 60% speed.\n\nThis is not DME. Players are empowered with the important technical details to play at speed and are held accountable to each other. They are taught how to win and given the skills (mental, physical, tactical & technical) that will be the foundation of their future success\n\nDME Coaches don't coach to who the players are, they coach to who the players can be creating an athlete that dominates their competition.\n\nDME has provided a pathway for dedicated players/parents to participate in both local Florida and out-of-state competitive tournament experiences and supplemental training. The DME solution acts as a wrap-around to traditional club soccer. For our U10/11 girls, these added experiences over the past several months have been beneficial for player growth and development, particularly in the off-season.\n\nWhether it is Maine, Orlando, or Lakewood Ranch, DME has established a culture of winning. I find that the kid's feedback is one of the best barometers of success. My report back to DME is to keep up the good work."
