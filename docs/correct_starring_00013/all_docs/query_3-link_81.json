        "text": "In our app-addicted culture, dating in the modern world has become extremely difficult. But what happens when you throw cultural differences and arraigned (“assisted”) marriage into the mix? Well, it all gets even more complicated, doesn’t it? That’s the premise of the new U.K. cross-cultural rom-com, “What’s Love Got To Do With It?” directed by Shekhar Kapur (“Elizabeth”) and written by Jemima Khan.\n\nREAD MORE: TIFF 2022: 16 Must-See Films To See At The Toronto Film Festival\n\nThere’s a pretty terrific cast in it as well. “What’s Love Got To Do With It?” stars Lily James, coming off her recent Emmy nomination for “Pam & Tommy,” also known for “Baby Driver” and “Darkest Hour”), Shazad Latif (“Star Trek: Discovery,” “Penny Dreadful”), ), Shabana Azmi (“Halo,” “Fire”), Sajal Aly (“Mom Alif”)and Academy Award and BAFTA winner Emma Thompson (“Good Luck To You, Leo Grande”). The film also stars Asim Chaudhry, Jeff Mirza, Mim Shaikh, and more.\n\nREAD MORE: Fall 2022 Preview: 60+ Must-See Films To Watch\n\nThe film is produced by Nicky Kentish Barnes (ABOUT TIME, ABOUT A BOY), Jemima Khan (IMPEACHMENT: AMERICAN CRIME STORY, THE CLINTON AFFAIR, THE CASE AGAINST ADNAN SYED, WE STEAL SECRETS: THE STORY OF WIKILEAKS) & her Instinct Productions, alongside Working Title Films’ Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner. STUDIOCANAL is fully financing and will release in their own territories – the UK, France, Germany, Australia & New Zealand – and are selling the film worldwide.\n\nHere’s the official synopsis:\n\nHow do you find lasting love in today’s world? For documentary-maker and dating app addict Zoe (Lily James), swiping right has only delivered an endless stream of Mr. Wrongs, to her eccentric mother Cath’s (Emma Thompson) dismay. For Zoe’s childhood friend and neighbor Kaz (Shazad Latif), the answer is to follow his parents’ example and opt for an arranged (or “assisted”) marriage to a bright and beautiful bride from Pakistan. As Zoe films his hopeful journey from London to Lahore to marry a stranger chosen by his parents, she begins to wonder if she might have something to learn from a profoundly different approach to finding love."
