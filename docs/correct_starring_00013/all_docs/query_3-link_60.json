        "text": "Amazon MGM is planning ‘A Sheep Detective’ comedy with an ensemble cast including Hugh Jackman, Emma Thompson, Nicholas Braun, Nicholas Galitzine, Molly Gordon, and Hong Chau.\n\nVariety reports that the feature, titled Three Bags Full: A Sheep Detective Movie,Â will also star Tosin Cole, Kobna Holdbrook-Smith, Conleth Hill and Mandeep Dhillon.\n\nThree Bags Full is a live-action comedy about a shepherd (Jackman) who dies under mysterious circumstances, leaving his flock of sheep to solve the case. The synopsis for the film adds: âThe local cop Tim Derry (Braun), on the other hand, has never solved a serious crime in his life, so the sheep conclude they will have to solve it themselves, even if it means leaving their meadow for the first time and facing the fact that the human world isnât as simple as it appears in books.â\n\nProduction on the feature has already begun, with Amazon planning a worldwide theatrical release on Feb. 20, 2026.\n\nEditorial credit: Loredana Sangiuliano / Shutterstock.com"
