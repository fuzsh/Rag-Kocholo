        "text": "\"Love Actually\" may be a perennial favorite for many, particularly around the holidays, but Thompson, who played a central role in the film as the crushed, stoic wife of the late Alan Rickman, acknowledges she doesn't rewatch the film.\n\n\"That was 20 years ago,\" Thompson told Fallon. \"I don't think I was very well paid for that. There was that terrible trailer with the loo that really stank and had that sort of… That's the things you remember, not the good ones.\"\n\nThompson also participated in the recent ABC special \"The Laughter & Secrets of Love Actually: 20 Years Later,\" hosted by Diane Sawyer, appearing alongside director Richard Curtis, Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy, Laura Linney, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, and Olivia Olson.\n\nAlthough Thompson doesn't reflect fondly on all aspects of the film now, the actor understands why \"Love Actually\" became a cultural sensation with longevity. It examines a universal theme that resonates with virtually everyone.\n\n\"I think we forget, time and time again we forget, that love is all that matters — it's all that matters,\" Thompson told Sawyer in the ABC special, adding that Curtis \"reminds us in the film that's very funny about love and all its messiness, its unexpectedness and that you'll find love in the weirdest places, you know?\""
