        "text": "Dame Emma Thompson admitted she channelled real life heartbreak she suffered at the hands of ex-husband Sir Kenneth Branagh while acting out her famous Love Actually scene.\n\nThe Matilda actress revealed she still had strong emotions towards the movie moment that showed her character’s discovery of her husband’s infidelity.\n\nGearing up to celebrate its 20th anniversary, in the 2003 film Dame Emma took on the role of wife to the late Alan Rickman’s character who realises he is cheating after finding jewellery bought for another woman in her room.\n\nThe 63-year-old mentioned she can vividly remember the way she felt at that time following her own revelation in her eight-year marriage to Sir Kenneth.\n\nDubbed the golden couple of British cinema or in this era – #couplegoals – Dame Emma shared her devastation when she uncovered the affair her husband at the time was reportedly having with fellow actress Helena Bonham Carter.\n\nDame Emma credited her convincing performance in the Christmas classic to her heart being ‘very badly broken’ by Sir Kenneth during a chat with Stellar Magazine.\n\nShe continued: ‘Yes, you remember the feelings you had at the time.\n\n‘That scene where my character is standing by the bed crying is so well known because it’s something everyone’s been through.\n\n‘I had my heart very badly broken by Ken. So I knew what it was like to find the necklace that wasn’t meant for me.\n\n‘Well it wasn’t exactly that, but we’ve all been through it.’\n\nAdopted by audiences as a modern day festive classic, the film also starred Hugh Grant, Colin Firth and Keira Knightley.\n\nLater on in the magazine interview, the Hollywood star was questioned over her most ‘terrifying’ role which she revealed was Miss Trunchbull in the most recent adaptation of Matilda.\n\nHowever it wasn’t the cruel nature of the character that scared her but the special effects that came with filming for the musical version of the Roald Dahl story.\n\n‘I’ll remember being 80 feet [24 metres] up on that structure and looking down, and all the kids were down there,’ she reminisces.\n\n‘They were going, “You’ll be all right”. My legs were shaking and we were all singing live. For me, it was such an exciting thing to do, but also terrifying.\n\n‘So that’s what’s going to stay with me from Matilda The Musical.’\n\nMetro.co.uk contacted Dame Emma’s reps for comment.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Dame Emma Thompson finally explains why she was really dancing like there was no tomorrow at Adele concert"
