        "text": "Something I noticed in my early viewings is one moment at the end when Emma Thompson refers to Hugh Grant as “my stupid big brother.”\n\nSee? I TELL THE TRUTH. WHY CAN’T THE MOVIE?\n\nBecause, see, Hugh Grant isn’t older than Emma Thompson. She’s a full year older than he is. The movie, for some reason, makes him older than she is.\n\nCouple this with the information I gave you on Day 8, that Emma Thompson is wearing body padding in the movie.\n\nI HAVE NO IDEA, RYAN REYNOLDS.\n\nLet us investigate.\n\nNeither of these bits of information inform the character in any way. Thompson and Prime Minister Hugh Grant barely interact whatsoever, and he’s a very shitty brother, never returning her calls and having no idea that he’s accidentally been a not-shitty brother by attending his niece and nephew’s school pageant. And as for the body padding? She’s always clad entirely in oversized sweaters and long skirts—body padding was wholly unnecessary.\n\nSo…why?\n\nBecause we’re meant to feel sorry for her and see her as this sad creature one can fathom Rickman cheating on. Hence, fat. But being perceived as older than Hugh Grant? A bridge too far.\n\nMERRY CHRISTMAS.\n\n25 Days of Love Actually Archive:"
