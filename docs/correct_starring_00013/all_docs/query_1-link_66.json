        "text": "Before 2016’s Me Before You united most of the major pop culture fandoms, there was the delightfully British Christmas romcom Love Actually, which had a perfect ensemble cast and — dare I say it — some cross-fandom pairings that are the stuff of steamy fan fiction. Spanning Harry Potter, Pirates of the Caribbean, Bridget Jones, Narnia, and Doctor Who, below is the great big fanfiction-ish cast of 2003's LoveActually.\n\nEmma Thompson\n\nLove Actually is basically an alternate muggle world where the most unlikely of Potter characters actually ended up together — like Sybill Trelawney and Snape. Aside from Love Actually and Harry Potter, Emma Thompson also recently starred in this year's Bridget Jones's Baby along with several other Love Actually alum, and starred alongside Harry Potter's Emma Watson once more in 2017's Beauty and the Beast.\n\nAlan Rickman\n\nThe late, great Alan Rickman played a lot of great villainous characters in his lifetime. Most unforgettable of them was Professor Snape; in this movie, he ironically played a character whose name was Harry, but was just as bad as Snape for cheating on Trelawney — I mean, on his wife, Karen.\n\nLiam Neeson\n\nLiam Neeson's character, Daniel, is Karen's best friend in this movie. He's also a loving stepfather to Sam. He makes so many phone calls in this movie that when you pause it, you could crack a joke about Taken. But we shouldn't forget that this guy was also Aslan, Qui-Gon Jinn, and Ra’s al Ghul.\n\nThomas Brodie-Sangster\n\nSince Love Actually, Sangster has also appeared in HBO's Game of Thrones as Jojen Reed and in an episode of Dr. Who. Let's not forget, he's also Newt in The Maze Runner!\n\nFun Fact: He was also in the same episode of Dr. Who as Bill Nighy (Billy Mack), and that very episode was written by Richard Curtis — also the writer-director of Love Actually.\n\nAnother fun fact: By the end of the movie, he got a kiss from his ultimate crush, Joanna (Olivia Olson). They're the same actors who voiced Vanessa and Ferb from the hit Disney animated series, Phineas and Ferb!\n\nColin Firth\n\nIn Love Actually, he plays Jamie Bennett, who actually had the same luck in love as Mark Darcy in the first Bridget Jones movie. Aside from that, he's also co-stars with his Bridget Jones rival Hugh Grant! We know that Colin Firth has appeared in countless romantic movies throughout the decade. However, we can all agree that Kingsman was one of his best roles to date and he reprised this role in Kingsman: The Golden Circle.\n\nBill Nighy\n\nBill Nighy is one of the actors in Love Actually that united a lot of fandoms. I mean, he's also Rufus Scrimegour and Davy Jones! And if you see Love Actually as an alternate muggle world, then you can't unsee the Minister for Magic in his loose behavior as an ageing rocker!\n\nKeira Knightley\n\nKnightley was a blushing bride in the film who married Rick Grimes's — I mean Andrew Lincoln's — best friend in the movie. Later on, she truly gained widespread recognition when she was cast as Elizabeth Swann in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise!\n\nAndrew Lincoln\n\nLove Actually really unites all the fandoms and we look no further than Andrew Lincoln — he added zombies and horror into the mix! Obviously, Love Actually is set in a pre-zombie world, and one of the survivors was Mark. Remember, his reasoning for being such a reserved person is because he's always thinking of self-preservation.\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor starred as Elizabeth Swann's groom in this movie, but that didn't stop us from shipping Mark (Grimes) and Juliet (Knightley). He wasn't a very interesting character in Love Actually, but his role as the Operative in Joss Whedon's space western film Serenity has more depth. He's a nameless agent with blood on his hands, but he redeemed himself in the end because, in reality, he was just doing his job. Ejiofor was also in 12 Years A Slave, but his other popular nerdy project is Baron Mordo in Doctor Strange.\n\nJanuary Jones\n\nRe-watching Love Actually and realizing that the American Colin found was in fact January Jones, was shocking. Her role is minor in Love Actually, but it's worth noting that if you didn't realize it was her before, you'd do now that you've seen her in acclaimed projects such as X-Men: First Class and Mad Men.\n\nMartin Freeman\n\nWe first encounter Martin Freeman in a very compromising position in Love Actually, because he was a stand-in. Even though he was the one without a very eventful story, he did get his happily ever-after with his co-worker, and the situation of their meeting is definitely an interesting story. In the years that came after Love Actually, we got to know him as Dr. Watson in Sherlock and of course, Bilbo Baggins in The Hobbit.\n\nRodrigo Santoro\n\nKarl, Laura Linney's co-worker that she's been in love with for two years, is a chameleon. He's had several cameos in movies we know, yet we didn't realize it's him. His most memorable and unrecognizable role to date is his portrayal of Xerxes in 300 and its follow-up film. And did you know that he's also the ruthless and Most Wanted bandit Hector Escaton in HBO's Westworld?"
