        "text": "Dame Emma Thompson has admitted that it was a case of art imitating life when it came to her role as betrayed wife, Karen, in Love Actually.\n\nIn an iconic scene in the 2003 romantic Christmas classic, Emma's character bursts into tears after she finds a stunning necklace that her husband (played by the late Alan Rickman) bought a mistress for Christmas.\n\nIt was made all the worse by the fact that he gave Karen a Joni Mitchell CD as her gift.\n\nThe scene has taken on new meaning as the actress has revealed that it was inspired by her own real-life turmoil.\n\nDame Emma previously said that she drew those tears from the memory of her now ex-husband, Kenneth Branagh's affair with fellow atress Helena Bonham Carter.\n\n“That scene where my character is standing by the bed crying is so well known because it’s something everyone’s been through,” she previously told the Telegraph.\n\n\"I had my heart very badly broken by Ken. So I knew what it was like to find the necklace that wasn’t meant for me. Well, it wasn’t exactly that, but we’ve all been through it.\"\n\nThe star married Kenneth in 1989, and in 1994 he reportedly began an affair with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein co-star Helena.\n\nThe couple announced their separation in 1995 and he and Helena continued their romance until 1999.\n\nDame Emma added: \"I’ve had so much bloody practice at crying in a bedroom, then having to go out and be cheerful, gathering up the pieces of my heart and putting them in a drawer.\"\n\nHowever, she has since moved on and told The Sunday Times about the affair: \"That is... all blood under the bridge. You can’t hold on to anything like that.\n\n\"It’s pointless. I haven’t got the energy for it... Helena and I made our peace years and years ago...she’s a wonderful woman.\"\n\nThe three have since all worked together on the Harry Potter franchises as Professor Lockhart, Professor Trelawney, and Bellatrix Lestrange.\n\nAnd Dame Emma, who is now married to fellow actor Greg Wise, showed just how much the tears are a thing of the past when she put on a joyous display during Adele's recent TV special.\n\nThe star, who was was one of many famous faces who attended the recording of ITV ’s An Audience With Adele, went viral by almost upstaging the singer with her dance moves throughout the show.\n\nEmma was up on her feet every time Adele sang anything remotely uptempo during the London Palladium gig and the viewers loved every minute.\n\n\"Dame Emma Thompson is a whole ass mood,\" tweeted one viewer. \"Petition for Emma Thompson to be in the audience for all performances forever more,\" wrote another. While one stated: \"I’m loving how low key chaotic the British Adele special is compared to the US one.\n\n\"Who needs a Hollywood sunset when you can have Alan Carr filling in while her make up gets touched up following an emotional ambush via a drunk Emma Thompson.\"\n\nWhen she took a break from the fancy footwork, the actress had a one-to-one moment with the singer during which she first asked her if she was wearing socks under her elegant black gown, to which Adele replied she was actually wearing tights but they were falling down.\n\nDame Emma then asked: “When you were younger, was there someone who supported you or inspired you or protected you from all the trials and tribulations of life and inspired you to go on?”\n\nThe singer replied that it was her English teacher at her school Chestnut Grove in Balham.\n\nThe dame then surprised Adele by inviting Ms McDonald on stage and the pair embraced with the singer becoming instantly emotional."
