        "text": "It’s almost 20 years since 2003’s festive favourite Love Actually debuted on the big screen.\n\nNow, some of the cast reunited to discuss the legacy of the British film, including stars Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant, in the upcoming screen event, The Laughter & Secrets of Love Actually: 20 Years Later – A Diane Sawyer Special, New York Post reports.\n\nThompson, 63, revealed in a clip from the special that during filming, Grant, 62, said the movie could possibly be their “most psychotic” flick together.\n\n“Hugh came up behind me as we were walking out and said, ‘Is that the most psychotic thing we’ve ever been in?’” Thompson said in the promo for the special obtained by Entertainment Weekly.\n\n“Did I say that?” Grant asked.\n\n“[It’s about] love and all its messiness and its unexpectedness in that you’ll find love in the weirdest places,” Thompson said.\n\nStream more entertainment news live & on demand with Flash. 25+ news channels in 1 place.

That’s the gag. It’s funny.’ And he says, ‘Yeah, but I’m speaking.’ I said, ‘I know.’”"
