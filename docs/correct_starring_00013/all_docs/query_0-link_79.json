        "text": "Thomas Brodie-Sangster made his big-screen debut in the 2003 film playing Sam, the stepson of Liam Neeson's character who finds himself suffering from \"the total agony of being in love\" while also mourning the death of his mum. Just 13 at the time, the young London-born actor stole the hearts of viewers all over the world with his precocious performance.\n\nReflecting on the experience of starring in the holiday movie, he told Mr Porter in 2021: \"I don't think Love Actually is going to go anywhere. I think I'll forever be known as the cute little kid from Love Actually. I don't mind that, that's fine.\"\n\nWhile we will always think of Thomas as Sam, the actor is all grown up now and has enjoyed an incredible career over the last 18 years.\n\nAfter appearing in Love Actually, he worked alongside Emma Thompson and Colin Firth again in the film Nanny McPhee. Following that, his career really kicked off, and he scored roles in blockbuster films Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Maze Runner, as well as fantasy series Game of Thrones. More recently, viewers will have seen him appearing in the Netflix drama The Queens Gambit. He has also portrayed legendary impresario Malcolm McLaren in Danny Boyle's Sex Pistols biopic series, Pistol.\n\nThe actor is also happily engaged to Talulah Riley.\n\nAmerican actress Olivia Olson starred as the object of Sam's affections, Joanna, who blew us all away with her incredible take on Mariah Carey's All I Want for Christmas is You. In fact, the then 11-year-old actress's singing was so good that director Richard Curtis even asked her to tone it down as he thought audiences would not believe that she could sing that well and think she was lip-synching. \"They just pretty much told me to sing it more straight, not do as many runs and trills,\" she confessed to Entertainment Weekly in 2009.\n\nThese days, the 31-year-old is still using her incredible voice in both her acting and music career. Not only has Olivia released her own solo album, titled Nowhere Land, but she is also the voice of some of our favourite animated TV characters! She reunited with her on-screen beau Thomas Brodie-Sangster as the voice of Vanessa Doofenshmirtz on Phineas and Ferb from 2008 until the show's end in 2015. Her other voice work includes Marceline the Vampire Queen on Adventure Time and Bliss on The Powerpuff Girls.\n\nWe should've known from her brilliant comedic timing that Lulu Popplewell would pursue a career in comedy! Today, the 32-year-old is working as a stand-up comedian. However, Lulu has admitted she isn't as big a fan of the film as you'd expect. Speaking on the Almost Famous podcast, she said that while she didn't regret being in the Christmas flick, it \"isn't for her\" as she \"doesn't like cheese\". Each to their own!\n\nWhile Love Actually remains Billy's first and only acting role, thanks to his godmother, actor Kathy Burke, we've seen a recent snap of him. \"Want to feel old? \"Here's what octopus boy aka my godson, Bill looks like now,\" she tweeted back in 2018, sending the internet into complete meltdown. \"Yeah, I feel old. Cheers for that,\" one fan tweeted in reply while another said he looks just like singer Harry Styles. There's no news on what Billy is up to now, so it's safe to assume that he's pursued a career away from the limelight.\n\nScarlett Curtis has become something of a star in her own right over the last few years. The 28-year-old, who boasts over 92,000 Instagram followers, is an activist and the author behind the best-selling essay collection Feminists Don't Wear Pink & Other Lies. She previously took to social media to share some interesting behind-the-scenes trivia from the film. Posting a snap of her with first lobster Lulu Popplewell on Christmas Eve 2020, she wrote: \"Merry Christmas from your local second lobster. Fun story: I was offered the part of angel, Mary or lobster... my answer was, 'Well obviously lobster!'. Fun story two: the girls inside the whale got so hot that one of them fainted and they had to bring an electric fan inside the whale with them.\""
