        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n23 Nov 2022, 08:27\n\nCredit: ABC\n\nAlmost two decades after becoming a noughties Christmas classic, the stars of Love Actually have come together for a brand new special celebrating the upcoming anniversary.\n\nThe hour-long one-off special, titled The Laughter & Secrets of Love Actually: 20 Years Later, will reunite stars Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy and Laura Linney, as well as director Richard Curtis.\n\nAccording to ABC News, who produced the special, Laughter & Secrets “will look at how the film became a beloved Christmas tradition and a global sensation, with new insight into behind-the-scenes secrets and iconic scenes.”\n\nHosted by Diane Sawyer, the highly anticipated special will air in the US on Tuesday 29th November, but no UK release date has been confirmed.\n\nThe trailer shows the stars gleefully reminiscing about their time on the festive rom-com, and teases the “secrets of Love Actually you don’t know.”\n\nNot only that, but Hugh will open up about THAT famous dance while playing Prime Minister David. Who could forget the truly iconic shimmy around Downing Street to Jump?\n\nLove Actually, released in November 2003, featured a number of storylines that became interwoven as the movie progressed.\n\nEight couples try to deal with romance in completely different ways, and also starred the likes of Keira Knightley, Colin Firth and Liam Neeson.\n\nBeloved by fans upon release, Love Actually was also a box office success, bagging £206 million worldwide, and even received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.\n\nMore recently, Billy Mack star Bill Nighy admitted his Love Actually quote might make the top of his obituary one day.\n\nAppearing on ITV’s This Morning earlier this month, Nighy spoke about a scene in the much-loved movie where he suggests: “Hiya kids. Here is an important message from your Uncle Bill. Don’t buy drugs. Become a pop star, and they give you them for free!”\n\nHe told hosts Dermot O’Leary and Alison Hammond: \"If I get an obituary, that will be on it. Kids used to run after me in my district, shouting that line.”\n\nHe said about the iconic rom-com: “It was a big and important thing for me and changed the way I went to work. I’ll never get bored talking about it.\""
