Emma Thompson is set to star in Netflix’s adaptation of the hit Broadway musical Matilda and she will be joined by 11-year old newcomer Alisha Weir. Weir is set to take on the title role of the film and Thompson was perfectly cast in the role of Miss Trunchbull, the cruel headmistress and villain of the story.

They join the previously cast Lashana Lynch, who will play Miss Honey, the kindly teacher that encourages Matilda and her telekinetic gifts.

The story is based on Roald Dahl’s classic book and the story centers on “a precocious and gifted girl who uses her powers to overcome bullies, including her family and her school's principal and protect her friends.”

The movie is being directed by Matthew Warchus, who directed the hit Tony and Olivier Award-winning Broadway musical, talked about his adaptation, saying, "Matilda will be an imaginative and fresh retelling of the award-winning musical, Matilda, featuring talented young newcomers, alongside established stars. I look forward to introducing this beloved and powerful story to a new generation of fans around the world."

I had the opportunity to see Matilda on Broadway years ago on a vacation I took to New York with my wife. It was actually the first Broadway musical I ever saw. After that, we hit up a few more. I haven’t been back to New York since that vacation. I miss that city, I especially miss the food.

Anyway, the casting for the Netflix film is coming together nicely and I’ll be looking forward to watching it when it’s released.
