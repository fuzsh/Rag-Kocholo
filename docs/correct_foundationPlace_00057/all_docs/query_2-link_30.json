        "text": "Our Solution\n\nEven though Breast Cancer Screening (BCS) is a completely different measure than Colorectal Cancer Screening (COL), NCQA describes each of the HEDIS measures in terms of its components viz. Measurement Dates, Eligibility criteria (age, gender, lookback period), diagnosis, numerator, denominator, and exclusions. Hence, a component-based measures architecture was created to define each measure with its nuances. Similarly, a data structure encompassing the data loads from NCQA was created which required minimal changes in the ETL process to load the measures and their value sets specified every year. Additionally, the relationships between SFs, Measures and sub-Measures, Health Plans, Payers, etc. were designed to be table driven.\n\nThe Need\n\nIn early 2019, ARC's marketing team needed help with their campaign promoting healthiness among their central Texas community, and as a result, purchased an automated email marketing tool. Although they were excited about the tool, it was difficult for them to figure out where to start. There were a lot of things that they could do with this tool, but didn't know how to organize the channels of communication in it. Moreover, they wanted to communicate to existing patients (versus new patients) for any of their new products whether it was a new clinic, a new program, or a new specialty. In order to better understand the journey of prospects/existing patients to healthiness program patients, they decided to engage with AAG.\n\nStrategy & Implementation\n\n​AAG had already worked with ARC’s Population Health Department for many years. AAG had not only helped ARC develop a data warehouse but also helped teach their team about the data, the processes for loading and transforming the data, as well as the organization of data i.e. the data architecture of the data warehouse.\n\nAAG deployed a similar strategy in helping the Marketing department. In working with the team and the new email marketing tool, we realized the importance of understanding the states of patients as they came into ARC. The first step in this process was to pull together and develop a state diagram that depicted the different states in which a person goes through from the first time they hear about the program, to signing up for the program, and beyond.\n\n​With the help of process state diagrams and marketing metrics and definitions, AAG showed how to effectively use the marketing tool for customer acquisition in this and all future campaigns. In addition, identifying disparate data sources, differentiating between existing patients and prospects in the acquisition funnel were some of the key enablers in instrumenting for future Analytics. Training the team members in this approach and having requirements discussions leading up to the 4 possible healthiness outcomes became a central piece of a “data-driven” mindset.\n\nOur Solution\n\n» ETL processes resulting in turn around time of Load process in few hours versus greater than 3 days!\n\n» More than 95% of Leads automatically loaded as STP in seconds resulted in estimated cost savings of 50x over 5 years!\n\n» Complete management transparency in Load process\n\n» Automated Lead Name and Address identification and matching\n\n» Strong Data Architecture and Analytics foundation for future\n\nBenefits\n\n» Faster Customer Acquisition – Quick STP processing with no breaks or restarts due to distractions or other priorities!\n\n» Well defined Governance & Organization Structure - Analytics Architecture, Processes, Scripts, and well-defined roles have enabled right governance structure for success\n\n» Better predictability – Better Planning for future feeds and appends resulting from increased transparency into Load process\n\n» Maintaining History – Improved Association interaction communicating data changes over time\n\n» Accurate Mailings – Less disgruntled members by reducing human errors in name identification with exact and fuzzy matching\n\n» Reduced Loss of Sales to Competition – Monthly mailing to Prospects enabled, Elimination of backlogs of feeds, enhanced documentation, reduced learning curve\n\n» Strong Foundation for future – Additional Associations and feeds could be automated lot faster now due to automation ​\n\nDATA\n\n» ​Found a voter survey dataset (approx. 236,000*200 records) for voters rating their MP (Member of Parliament) in India for each of the 437 districts measured\n\n» voter's survey data consisted of demographics, preferences, and for each of the 30 issues, their Importance (I) & Performance (P)\n\n» ​For Data Preparation, removal of irrelevant data, Standardizing I and P, duplicate removal, convert categorical responses to numerical columns were some of the steps resorted to prior to using algorithms\n\nALGORITHMS\n\nFor the city of Bengaluru in Karnataka, used the following techniques for Analysis\n\n1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n\n2. Clustering\n\n3. Descriptive Analytics\n\nOur Approach\n\nThe client’s users, projects, data and analytics needs had grown tremendously and especially so in the last couple of years. In order to meet the needs of future growth, they engaged with us to explore how their data and analytics environment could scale up to better forecasting the current and future needs.\n\nAAG conducted Phase 0 of Data & Analytics Assessment for client’s current & future needs. Apart from presenting the findings and recommendations, AAG delivered a roadmap with a proposal for a phased implementation of future state.\n\nAssessment Workshop Benefits\n\nThe Assessment resulted in the following Benefits for Client:\n\n​» Comprehensive Current State Assessment & Phased Future State Proposal\n\n» Current State Observations, spanning\n\n- Data & Analytics\n\n- Processes & People\n\n- Tools & Technologies\n\n» Recommendations for Future State\n\n- Technology & Data Harnessing\n\n- Harvesting Value & Algorithms\n\n- Phased Tracks Approach\n\n» High Level Data Flow Architecture\n\n» High Level Requirements (BI Reports)\n\n» Roles, Investments, Roadmap\n\n» Strategy to address gaps\n\n» ​Governance model\n\nOur Solution\n\nSpiceworks embarked on a journey to spearhead data science to be more of a driving product than a reactive product through building an organizational structure and robust platform to harness and harvest data.\n\nAnalytics Advisory Group was able to recommend a robust and sustainable model to Spiceworks in order to continue addressing the needs of business users, clarify entities within the Spiceworks system, and increase value creation to keep Spiceworks in the forefront of the technological sphere.\n\nAssessment Workshop Benefits\n\nAfter conducting a Data & Analytics Assessment across different teams in Spiceworks, we were able to recommend the following:\n\n​» Focus on Data Governance\n\nA separation of “core” vs. “non-core” activities, identification of roles (especially in Architecture) following the C.A.M.P. model, and a separation of “what” and “how” is needed.\n\n​» Employee Analytics Training\n\nAn emphasis on Tableau, advanced analytics, and text analytics (NLP exploitation) enforces a strong analytical background for future data science initiatives.\n\n​» Enforcement on Business Identity and History Maintenance\n\n​» Need to “Data Instrument” for “Personas”\n\n​» Switching to More Robust Software Applications and Storage\n\nSwitching on premise to the Cloud, delving into Python, Kafka, and SQL, cementing a data management platform would prevent old hardware failure and update systems to be more sustainable for increasing data needs.\n\n​\n\nThe Needs\n\nThe current state analysis detailed that AXA UK needed to find a platform to make underwriting and pricing to run efficiently and find a SAS environment that can handle large volumes of data for BAU or discovery analytics.\n\nData processing times of up to seven to nine hours and a lack of technological readiness to deal with growing business growth was a dire need. Hence, wanted to increase speed of analytics and scale data to future growth volumes.\n\n​Additionally, lot of manual processes needed to be automated.\n\nOur Solution\n\nBenefits\n\n​» Significant proven value in unstructured data\n\n​» Successful segmentation by what, why and where\n\n​» Number of threads exposed that should be of interest for pricing\n\nand/or underwriting action\n\n​» Potential operational issues exposed in data\n\n​» Emerging trends can be spotted using these techniques\n\n​» Data quality issues impact and irrelevant data impacts analysis\n\nspeed, requires careful handling\n\n​» Use of Claims SME critical to manage challenges. It will be possible for ML to enhance SME role, through creation of specific dictionaries. This will also allow the iterative learning to be kept in house over time\n\n​» Automated the identification of new rating factors and processing claims\n\n​» ​By using R and big data configuration that could be used in handling large\n\nvolumes of data, parallel processing made industrializing easier and rating\n\nThe Needs\n\nAlthough all claims involved high amount of unstructured data, it was not being used to identify suspicious cases nor improve straight through processing (STP) time. Due to the sheer\n\nvolume of claims and limited SIU staff, a binary, rules based approach was used to flag fraudulent claims resulting\n\nin many claims going undetected for suspicious activity.\n\nAXA UK wanted to\n\n​» Process unstructured data from claim records and attachments for fraud detection\n\n​» Identify potential claims with indications of suspicion using a fraud dictionary\n\n​» Speed up STP for non suspicious claims\n\n​» ​Understand the iterative, discovery process of looking at unstructured data"
