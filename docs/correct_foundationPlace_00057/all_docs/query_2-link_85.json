Legal Aid is a nationwide network of nonprofit law firms that provides free legal services to eligible low-income individuals and families. The intake form at the Texas Disaster Legal Help will guide users through a series of questions about their legal problem. Along the way, they will get free information and a summary of the interview at the end.\n\n– Texas Disaster Legal Help can connect users with free legal services if they qualify.\n\n– Texas Disaster Legal Help is free to all users.\n\nContributed by: Community Member\n\nThe Access to Justice Tech Fellowship Program is designed to identify and equip the next generation of civil justice leaders to ensure equitable access to justice for all. “The ATJ Tech Fellows program provides law students a dynamic learning experience that merges interdisciplinary skills training with practical experience.\n\nAt the intersection of access to justice and innovation, law students spend the summer developing innovative projects and initiatives aimed to improve our civil justice system.\n\nLaw students gain exposure to the varied uses of technology, data, and design in delivering legal services and develop a deep understanding of the systemic barriers that prevent marginalized communities from receiving adequate legal services.”\n\nContributed by: Community Member\n\nLegaltechHub is where legal professionals find the right resources, anywhere in the world.

Luigi Bai, Lauren Figaro, April Williams, and Andrea Martinez discuss the tools they use to manage their document assembly project, including Google Docs, Miro, and A2J Author. This project uses A2J Author to create an A2J Guided Interview with an A2J Document Assembly Tool (A2J DAT) Template that produces the information and forms necessary for a tenant to defend themselves against an eviction in the era of COVID19. It is hosted on CALI’s A2J.org website. A2J Author Project Manager Jessica Frank moderates the presentation.\n\nContributed by: Community Member\n\n“Texas Disaster Legal Help (TDLH) is a collaboration between the three largest legal aid organizations in Texas – Lone Star Legal Aid, Legal Aid of Northwest Texas, and Texas RioGrande Legal Aid – designed to improve the mobilization of pro bono volunteers during and in the immediate aftermath of a disaster; leveraging technology to meet legal needs in emergencies more effectively.\n\n[TLDH] worked together to create a Pro Bono Portal (Portal) dedicated to connecting pro bono volunteers to educational materials, training, and volunteer opportunities. Through the Portal, volunteers can view tailored resources, review and accept cases statewide, sign up for ongoing training opportunities, track case time and CLE credits, access helpful templates, and conduct other case work.”\n\nContributed by: Community Member\n\nLSNTAP webinar: This intro level security class is focused specifically on remote working and protecting your client’s confidentiality and your organization’s security.

You can use up to 10 boards for free. For each project card, you can assign it to members of your team, set up checklists & due dates, and add attachments. Comments can be added to a card and a specific person tagged to see it. You can also set up due dates to automatically populate on a GoogleCalendar.\n\nContributed by: ATJ Community Member\n\nGSuite for Nonprofits is available for qualifying nonprofit organizations and allows access to the basic Gsuite business package for free, which can be accessed from anywhere there is internet (including through smartphone apps).

Google Meet is included. Compared to personal accounts, there is more space and better security. Importantly, the accounts belong to the organization and not the individual.\n\nContributed by: ATJ Community Member\n\nLSNTAP webinar: Email communication was never conceived to be the center of our digital lives, hence it wasn’t created with security in mind. Today it is an essential part of business communication. Everyday sensitive and confidential information traverses the Internet and other unsecured networks where it may be intercepted or read.\n\nMicrosoft Office 365 service has been improved by providing multiple methods to encrypt your email, including OME (Office Message Encryption), S/MIME (Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail), IRM (Information Rights Management) and TLS (Transport Layer Security).\n\n+\n\nAll of these tools ensure your messages are only seen by the intended recipient. In this session, we will take a high-level look at these technologies and provide an in-depth look at the OME method which can help ensure the privacy of mail transmission.\n\nPresenter: Rajesh Shah – Just Tech\n\nContributed by: Cathryn Ibarra"
