        "text": "To Submit a Work Order - Choose the option that best fits\n\nLog on to the helpdesk.kisd.org and enter your helpdesk request.\n\nSend an email to helpdesk@kisd.org. Be sure to include your name, campus, room number and WORKSTATION NUMBER.\n\nCall the helpline at extension 4001 or 903-988-3929.\n\nKISD Workstation Number\n\nEvery computer in KISD has a WORKSTATION NUMBER. This number is located on a white label and includes a bar code. Generally, this label can be found near the front of the computer on either side or the top. In some cases that label may be on the back of the computer. See examples below:\n\nPlease reference the workstation number any time you create or request a work order.\n\nSpiceWorks HelpDesk Portal\n\nSpiceWorks Helpdesk provides users with lots of options. For example,\n\nWhen you submit a request ticket, you have the flexibility to edit or even remove the ticket if needed.\n\nYour ticket will serve as a log of all activities that are taking place so that you will stay informed on the work being done.\n\nYou can easily contact the technician assigned by using your request ticket.\n\nGot blocked from something and not sure why?\n\nLet's take a look ...\n\nSometimes if you connect from a bunch of different devices or locations, our filter wants to make sure it knows who you are. In other words, it wants to give you the right access based on your role at KISD. Obviously a \"guest\" user on our \"KISD_Guest\" wireless connection shouldn't have the same privileges as a student or staff member, right?\n\nIn this example, a user tried to access a web site that streams music from our \"KISD_Guest\" wireless connection. We're not mad at this guy. We'd just rather save our bandwidth for our users that we know. This \"guest\" user can still get to many places on the Internet, just not things that use a lot of bandwidth or are resource intensive. Think of of it as \"Internet-Lite.\"\n\nBut what if our user in the above example is a real KISD user and got a screen like that seen above ... Let's say they were going to a site that isn't inappropriate ... but maybe isn't the highest educational priority either. They might see that screen. All they need to do is to enter their login credentials (the same username and password they use to log on to campus computers) and if the site is legitimate ... Boom, bada, bing. They're in.\n\nSometimes, though ...\n\nWe do have to filter some web sites. Believe it or not, there are state and federal laws that require us to block certain web sites. Most of these make sense to most people (uhh, you know what I mean), but there are other sites that may leave you scratching your head.\n\nSome examples of sites we filter:\n\nObscene, vulgar or pornographic sites\n\nPages that promote illegal activities\n\nSites that interfere with our primary mission -- remember, you're here for an education, right?\n\nSometimes, we do get things wrong, though. If you get the pages above and you are logged in ... but you think you should be able to get to that web site, go ahead and submit a \"Site Review Request.\" Please allow a day or so for someone to process this request. We'll get to it as quickly as we can.\n\nI hope that makes sense and I hope those \"blocked\" pages don't leave you frustrated. If you understand what you see on those pages ... you'll be surfing along with no problems."
