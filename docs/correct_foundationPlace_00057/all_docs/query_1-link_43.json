Expanding Your Business to Asia.Josh Steimle\n\nIn 2013 I moved my family to Hong Kong to open my digital marketing agency's first international office. This slide deck was used for a presentation at the San Francisco office of InvestHK on Nov 3rd, 2015, to explain why I chose Hong Kong for my business, and why I believe Hong Kong is a compelling first option for other businesses looking to expand to Asia.

It finds that on average, founders of successful startups were older at 28.8 years when starting their first successful company. They tended to gain experience through multiple jobs and startups before striking out on their own. Many had international exposure through work or study overseas. Successful founders also customized proven business models from other countries and were relentless, treating their startups like a marathon rather than a sprint by spending over 5 years on average building their companies. The document advises emulating these factors or being exceptional in other ways, but emphasizes taking action to actually start and build a company.\n\nBrazil Startup Report\n\nBrazil Startup ReportWorld Startup Report\n\nInterested in starting a company in Brazil?

However, startups should consider going global if they are from a small country with conservative investors or if their customers and partners are globally located. - McClure also discusses the global startup ecosystem and factors like available capital, mentorship, education, and platform/distribution channels that make certain regions more attractive for startups to operate in from the beginning.\n\nHow Blockchain is Transforming Online Retail Security\n\nHow Blockchain is Transforming Online Retail SecuritySOFTTECHHUB\n\nWelcome to digital commerce, where security of online transactions has become a paramount concern for both businesses and consumers. As we navigate through an era where digital shopping is no longer just an alternative but increasingly the norm, the need for robust security measures has never been more critical. Enter blockchain technology – a revolutionary approach that promises to redefine the very foundations of e-commerce security. Overview of Online Retail Security Challenges The digital marketplace, while offering unparalleled convenience, is not without its perils. With millions of transactions occurring every day, e-commerce platforms have become prime targets for cybercriminals. From data breaches to fraudulent transactions, the threats are as diverse as they are numerous. Rise of Cyber Threats in E-commerce In recent years, we've witnessed an alarming surge in cyber attacks targeting online retailers. These attacks have grown not just in frequency but also in sophistication. Hackers are continually devising new methods to exploit vulnerabilities in e-commerce systems, leaving both businesses and consumers vulnerable. Importance of Secure Transactions In this digital age, trust is the currency that drives e-commerce. Consumers need to feel confident that their personal and financial information is protected when they make online purchases. For businesses, ensuring secure transactions is not just about protecting revenue – it's about safeguarding their reputation and maintaining customer loyalty in an increasingly competitive market."
