Programming skills will help you stand out and boost your career as a cloud engineer. Fortunately, there are many online training resources at your disposal to learn and enhance your programming skills.\n\nBusiness Skills\n\nHaving good business and financial skills can give cloud professionals a better understanding of their role in a company. Familiarizing yourself with terms like return on investment (ROI), profit margins, or cash flow can give them a competitive edge in the labor market, as it will allow you to better connect your role as a cloud computing professional to the organization’s overall goals. This knowledge can also benefit you when looking to negotiate salaries or job roles.\n\nHow to Create a Cloud Computing Portfolio\n\nTo create a strong cloud computing portfolio, you need to start working on hands-on cloud computing projects. Pick projects that you are passionate about and allow you to demonstrate your skills. You can opt for projects such as building a cloud-based book store or chatbot, or even a data mining application.\n\nAnother important aspect of building an effective portfolio is how you select and present your work. Remember to include your best projects, the ones that highlight your more advanced skills. Make sure to add a brief introduction to each project explaining what the challenge was and how you tackled it. Adding this context shows employers that you are able to think of the big picture in addition to having the skills to solve a specific problem.\n\nHow to Get a Cloud Computing Internship\n\nTo get an internship in cloud computing, you need to start by researching opportunities.

If you opt for a college degree, it will take you about four years to complete your bachelor’s degree.\n\nHowever, you should allow for a few more months or even a year to do an internship, as you need this experience to access most entry-level jobs. In addition, many professionals in this field pursue advanced degrees, which usually take two years. All in all, if you choose the academic route, it would take four to six years before you can get a full-time cloud computing position.\n\nThere is also the option of attending a community college and getting an associate degree. This option will take you two years and, if coupled with the right experience, can probably be enough to land entry-level positions. To get this experience you should apply for internships or apprenticeships after earning your degree.\n\nFinally, coding bootcamps are an excellent alternative. Coding bootcamps offer immersive training over a short period of time. Most bootcamp programs last three to nine months and give you the training you need to land well-paying, albeit entry-level, jobs in cloud computing.\n\nThe Five Highest-Paying Cloud Computing Jobs\n\nIf you’re ready to start hunting for your dream cloud computing jobs, check out our list of the five highest-paying options you should consider.
