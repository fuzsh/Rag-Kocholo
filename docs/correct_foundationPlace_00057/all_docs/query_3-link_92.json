        "text": "It gives us great pleasure to announce The SaaS Report’s (now The Software Report) Top 50 SaaS CEOs of 2018. These CEOs were selected largely based on the detailed reviews we received from their respective employees and industry colleagues. We received nearly 5,000 nominations on behalf of hundreds of CEOs. CEOs were assessed across a number of key areas including integrity, intelligence, energy, company culture, and company growth, among other areas.\n\nWe also evaluated closely the comments employees and colleagues submitted about a CEO's particular strengths as well as improvement areas. In many cases, it was evident that a CEO had developed such unique leadership skills that they were held in high esteem by seemingly everyone they worked with and were markedly more effective than their fellow CEOs in the industry. Notably, CEO caliber did not necessarily correlate with organization size or amount of capital raised.\n\nWe congratulate each of the awardees of the Top 50 SaaS CEOs of 2018.\n\n1.
