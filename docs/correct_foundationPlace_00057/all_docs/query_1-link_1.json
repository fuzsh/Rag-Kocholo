        "text": "I am delighted to announce that my recent research paper on \"Insider Threat Detection: Using Classification Models (AI / ML)\" has been accepted for presentation at the prestigious IC3 2023 International Conference. This is a significant achievement considering the high caliber of submissions received this year. IC3 received approximately 365 top-notch research papers from authors representing over 11 countries. Out of these, only around 30% of papers were selected for presentation and publication in the conference proceedings. You can find the link to my research paper here: https://lnkd.in/gbyVnJGG This paper represents groundbreaking work in Insider Threat Detection, shifting the focus from intuition-based approaches to a more data-driven methodology. In today's rapidly evolving landscape, organizations face new challenges in preventing, detecting, and responding to insider threats. These threats arise from within the organization and can be attributed to factors such as an increasingly mobile workforce, changing dynamics, and the extensive digital reach of technology. Insider threats originating from employees, suppliers, or vendors remain one of the most significant unsolved issues in cybersecurity. Although organizations are aware of the problem, they often fail to allocate sufficient resources or attention to address it until it's too late. Many prevention programs fall short by solely focusing on behavior monitoring or by neglecting cultural and privacy norms. The International Conference on Contemporary Computing (IC3) has been jointly organized since 2008 by the Jaypee Institute of Information Technology (JIIT) in Noida, India, and the University of Florida in Gainesville, USA. This conference brings together researchers, practitioners, and experts from academia, industry, and government to discuss the algorithmic, systemic, applied, and educational aspects of contemporary computing. IC3-2023, to be held in NOIDA, New Delhi, India, will feature distinguished keynote speakers, presentations of over 100 peer-reviewed papers, and exhibits. I am excited to be part of this esteemed conference (3rd to 5th of Aug 2023) and look forward to engaging with the brilliant minds in the field. Thanking my Mentor Dr. Narayana D for his guidance üë®üéì #cyberintelligence #cyberdefense #cyber #ai #artificialintelliegence #machinelearning #datascience #insiderthreat #cyberforensics\n\nüöÄ Reflecting on an Inspiring Journey: Transforming our Work Environment from the Bottom Up and Expressing Gratitude üôè Dear friends, As I bid adieu to a team that has become an integral part of my life, I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude for the support, camaraderie, & memories we have created together. During our time together, we undertook a collective effort to transform our work environment, fostering a culture of innovation and collaboration. We embraced a bottom-up strategy that proved to be an inspiring journey. Together, we invested extensive time and effort brainstorming ideas, formulating strategies, & implementing initiatives to reshape our organizational culture. Through open dialogue, cross-departmental collaboration, & a commitment to continuous learning, we witnessed the remarkable dedication & enthusiasm of each team member.

Creating an inclusive and supportive atmosphere led to increased creativity, productivity, and stronger bonds within our team. Looking back, I am overwhelmed with gratitude for the friendships we forged, the knowledge we exchanged, and the milestones we achieved. From our day-long brainstorming sessions to the moments of celebration during team outings, we created memories that will forever bring a smile to my face. As I embark on new horizons, I carry with me the invaluable lessons and cherished memories we shared. I have no doubt that this incredible team will continue to thrive and accomplish great things. Embrace the opportunities that lie ahead, and let the bonds we built serve as a foundation for even greater success.

Take a moment to reminisce and share in the joy that this team has brought to my life. Remember, change is constant in our professional lives.
