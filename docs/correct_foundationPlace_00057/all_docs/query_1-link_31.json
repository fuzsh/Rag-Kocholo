        "text": "Will Harrison is a writer and reporter from Toledo, Ohio whose work can be found in the Toledo Blade, the Austin American-Statesman, Thrillist, Curse Media, and more.*\n\nThere was a time when the most astounding piece of hardware I had ever laid my eyes upon was the Iomega Zip Drive.\n\nOf course, this was 1996, and my eleven-year-old self was still amazed and enraptured by the mere concept of the home computer, and Iomega’s expensive, proprietary disk system seemed revolutionary … at the time. After all, this was a premium product. Its 100MB floppy disks alone cost a cool twenty bucks apiece. Surely, the technology was a cut above the rest.\n\nIn hindsight, I do not think I even used the drive a single time. I mean: What did I need a 100MB floppy disk for in 1996? To store saved pictures from the AOL landing page?\n\nBut times have changed drastically since then. Our digital storage needs have evolved at a rapid pace, and that data needs to go somewhere. Chinese-owned market intelligence group International Data Corporation (IDC) estimates that 44 zettabytes (or 44 trillion gigabytes) will exist by 2020, where that amount was only about four zettabytes in 2013.\n\nThe Zip Drive and Iomega’s ambitions were an early step in the march of progress towards better data storage solutions. From humble beginnings with punch cards and magnetic drum memory units to the hard disks and SSDs we use today at home, in the office, and in the cloud, data storage will only continue to evolve in the future.\n\nBut what’s next on the horizon for data storage? For the answers, scientists and companies have taken cues from comic books and science-fiction, pressing the boundaries of storage solutions while also finding ways to store more data than ever thought possible.\n\nData storage is in our genes\n\nWith the amount of digital data we produce growing at a tremendous pace, in the future, long-term, expansive data solutions will be needed as we approach the limits of current storage technologies. As it turns out, one of the proposed solutions coming forward today already exists inside of all of us, at the genetic level.\n\nYaniv Erlich is a computer scientist at Columbia University who spoke with Science Magazine in March of this year about the potential of using DNA as data storage solution. According to the article, just a single milligram of DNA has the potential to hold billions of gigabytes of data (sort of like in the movie Johnny Mnemonic). But how do you preserve DNA and prevent it from mutating like it does in living cells?\n\nFamed American geneticist and woolly mammoth-cloning advocate George Church , along with his team at Harvard Medical School have attempted solutions for both of these issues, working on a cell-less DNA archiving system since 2012. This system would use glass chips that have chemically synthesized DNA printed on the surface via short strands by a printer. It is read back by a combination of computer and DNA sequencer.\n\nThe proof of concept for this technique was Church’s team taking a genetics book that he had co-authored, writing it to DNA, then extracting the data and reconstituting the book back into its prior digital form. The story of DNA and data storage goes even further past Church and his work, and to get there we will have to pull a Robert Frost and The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost | Poetry Foundation take the road less traveled by , into a forest of potential.\n\nSeeing the data forest for the trees\n\nIf we’re talking DNA as a proverbial hard drive, then the most abundant source of disk space available on our planet is Mother Nature’s very own verdant, green life. Two scientists are working on proving that storage may be as simple as planting a tree.\n\nKarin Ljubic Fister , a researcher with University Medical Centre Maribor, Slovenia, and her husband, Iztok, have worked on the concept of plant data storage since 2015 when she gave a talk at Berlin’s Falling Walls Lab conference .\n\nHer research team has proven the data storage concept works on a small scale, after imprinting a ‘Hello World” computer program onto the cells of a tobacco plant. The data was encoded using Python, synthesized, and cloned into the plant DNA via plasmid-vector. And in terms of creating copies of the information, the team found that the data was 100 percent intact in both the seeds produced by the plant and in the genetic code from the plant’s seedlings.\n\nFister hopes that this type of data storage will one day be as simple as using handheld, genetic sequencers to extract data from plants on the fly. Just imagine, one day a data center might look less like rows of computers, and more like a greenhouse.\n\nIf you’re not the type with a green thumb, perhaps this next technology might be a more rock-solid solution.\n\nCrystal-clear data solutions\n\nIf Superman’s Fortress of Solitude was any indication, Kryptonians were really into crystals. And they used them for data storage to great effect. After all, the entire knowledge of Kal-El’s doomed planet of Krypton was supposedly kept in a series of small crystals.\n\nSo … Why can’t we do the same thing? Life, after all, is often stranger than fiction.\n\nA group of University of Farhampton researchers in the United Kingdom began working with the concept of etching data onto the surface of quartz crystal, achieving success in 2016. This 5-dimensional storage medium created by the university’s Optoelectronics Research Center holds around 360 terabytes of data, with physical stability up to 1,000 Celsius, and an unlimited lifetime shelf life when held at room temperature.\n\nThe group was able to save the data of works such as the Magna Carta and the King James Bible, and after the success of their work, are now looking for ways to make the technology cost-efficient so that it may be commercialized.\n\nHere’s the kicker: The team even named the stuff “Superman memory crystals.” It’s like I’ve always said: Comic book tech can solve the world’s issues.\n\nWhich future storage tech tickles your fancy?\n\nWhich of these data storage realities are you most anxious to see in real life? Share your thoughts in the comments below!\n\nInteresting write up. Data on DNA is a easy jump to make in my mind. DNA and RNA have been storing data for millions of years already. As for storing the DNA in live organisms, I think that is kind of overkill for multiple reasons. First, consider the two objects. DNA vs. a tree…actually lets say the tobacco plant. Without getting into exact numbers, a tobacco plant is millions of times larger than a strand of DNA. So storing data in live plants is kind of like storing data on a microSD card and then storing the SD card inside of a computer. Both have the same data (sort of, I will discuss that later), but one can be stored in a much smaller space (which has many benefits). Now that data itself is where we run into the next issues. A tobacco plant embedded with the data of a hello world program or picture or anything is not storing that program or picture, it is really copying/backing it up millions and millions of times. That actually might have some use, DNA RAID essentially, and with the way that DNA works, it will self check for errors (does not mean errors do not happen). DNA has errors all the time, this is not only what causes things like cancer, but is also responsible for the adaptations that drive evolution. Due to probability, you will be way more likely to find a good copy of the DNA than a mutated form. IRL, as I touched on before this results in disease, adaptation, etc. In IT terms, it is just corrupt data. Now if you are relying on these backups stored in plant matter and a mutation occurs in the gametes, the next generation will carry the corrupt data.\n\nI really went on some tangents there, but I feel it makes more sense to store the data (on DNA) in vials or other storage. You could easily store more copies than needed in a super small space, and you could keep them in controlled environments away from radiation (sunlight) that causes most mutations."
