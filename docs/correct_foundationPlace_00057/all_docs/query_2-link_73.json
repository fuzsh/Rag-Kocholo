In about 15 minutes, we are going to kick off a couple of TechCrunch events here, starting with a roundtable that I will be hosting on the Grassroots Web, followed by our Austin MeetUp. We'll be streaming the roundtable live right here. The Web, by its very nature, is not only a global medium, but a grassroots one. People find each other on the Web according to their niche interests, and sometimes, somehow those interests spread. How does that happen? Anyone trying to reach a large audience in an authentic way—politicians, marketers, social organizers—is trying to tap into the Web grassroots because those roots are digitally connected and networked together, making it easier for ideas to spread like wildfire. How will the Grassroots Web affect the current election? At what point does Grasroots + Personal Media = Social Change? Does the rise of the Grassroots Web spell the demise of traditional Madison Avenue advertising? Join us here to find out. And for those in Austin, we'll keep the party going at our MeetUp afterwards. And of course, none of this would be possible without our awesome sponsors. Thank you.",
