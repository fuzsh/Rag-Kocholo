        "text": "Dublin is more like Austin than Silicon Valley\n\nSome people in Dublin might say that it’s the Silicon Valley of Europe, but it would probably be more appropriate to say it’s the Austin of Europe. The two cities are similar sizes and have many other characteristics in common — big university towns, centers of government, and a river/canal running down the middle. The tech scene is similar too — with many of the same multi-national companies establishing big offices in both locations.\n\nApple’s second largest office is in Austin and Facebook and Google both have a large presence. When Silicon Valley companies open an office in Austin or Dublin, they start off with customer service, sales and operations positions. That’s still the bulk of most of the positions for Apple, Facebook, and Google in both locations.\n\nOnce they have an office there programmer teams grow over time. First one programmer moves there to work remotely. Then they place 3 programmers there because they can’t get them Visas to work in the U.S. this year. People in Austin and Dublin are advocates for their cities, so soon they convince higher ups to place a small product team on the ground there — these days probably a mobile team that can operate independently from the larger group. Over time the number of programmers will grow.\n\n3 Legs — IDA, Enteprise Ireland, SFI\n\nThe Irish government has a three-legged approach to encouraging technology innovation. Each has a corresponding government entity but the three seem to work together when appropriate as well. The Industrial Development Authority (everyone just calls it “The IDA”) focuses on encouraging multi-national corporations to create jobs in Ireland. Enterprise Ireland focuses on helping organic Irish businesses succeed domestically and internationally. Science Foundation Ireland provides research grants to Irish universities.\n\nThe IDA is the organization that people outside of Ireland are most likely to interact with because their job is to encourage foreign investment and job creation. They “market” Ireland to the rest of the world with feet on the ground in other countries (including Austin) to recruit companies to put their European headquarters in Ireland. They host their own events, sponsor others, and provide information and tours to those that visit. In some cases they may be able to help arrange tax incentives. In Austin, this role is played by the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThey are good at their job, but like Austin, it’s not hard to convince companies to expand to Ireland. It’s English-speaking and the closest European country to the U.S. They have great schools and research universities combined with a pro-business government. Ireland is a fun place to visit, with nice people, a beautiful landscape, and a rich culture.\n\nThe IDA was the group most prepared and excited to welcome me to Ireland. If you’re looking at expanding to Europe you should definitely consider Ireland and you should definitely be talking to the IDA to make sure you know what all of your options are.\n\nSpecial thanks to Aimee Williams, Brendan McDonald, Gerard Hayes, and Barry O’Dowd from IDA for being such gracious hosts!\n\nEnterprise Ireland is focused on supporting organic Irish businesses by creating an infrastructure of office parks, incubators, accelerators, and seed-stage matching investment funds. If an Irish startup can attract private investment then it doesn’t seem that hard to get the Enterprise Ireland to match it.\n\nEnterprise Ireland has offices in Silicon Valley, Austin and several other cities so that they can be helpful to Irish tech startups looking to enter the U.S. market and reach U.S. investors. They would be the ones to showcase Irish startups at international venues such as SXSW.\n\nDifferent states in the U.S. play this to various degrees but I’ve never seen one with the same level of commitment or execution. In Texas we have some office parks and incubators, usually attached to the universities; and we have the Emerging Technology Fund which seems unlikely to continue in this administration. In Ireland they are making it work.\n\nScience Foundation Ireland (SFI) is similar to the National Science Foundation (NSF) in the U.S. They use tax money as a catalyst to drive innovation and economic development through research.\n\nI met with the Director General Mark Ferguson and found that he had an innovative approach and refreshing perspective compared to most government or university officials I had met in the past. Maybe one reason is that he is an entrepreneur and innovator himself.\n\nIn general, they give grants to Irish universities, but they have one program that could be of particular interest to U.S. (or any other) companies. SFI will pay the salary for one of their researchers to embed in another company for 1 year anywhere in the world. All you need to do is convince the researcher to go — the easiest way being to post to their LinkedIn page of opportunities.\n\nAfter the first year, you can hire them if you want them and they want to join you. In the first batch there were 50 researches and all were offered jobs at the companies they were embedded in. Half of them took the jobs they were offered — but only one went back to the university.\n\nMark had a practical perspective on his researchers. He pointed out that 90% will end up in the private sector no matter what he does, and that’s where lots of interesting economic impact happens. He doesn’t seem to have any lack of new talent to replace them. When he thinks about being a catalyst for economic development, feeding industry with really smart, talented researchers seems like a pretty good approach.\n\nIrish Tech Needs a Big Win\n\nIreland’s biggest commercial success story seems to be Ryan Air, which is like the Southwest Airlines of Europe. Not a tech company, but a very visible brand all over Europe. The next one they would probably mention is Stripe. It wasn’t created in Ireland but the founders were both born there and then moved to Silicon Valley where it has become one of the Unicorn private companies worth more than $1 billion. Probably next in line is Intercom, a customer marketing and retention tool for apps and websites. They are headquartered in Silicon Valley but have their development team in Dublin.\n\nOf course, what they really want is a big success story that starts in Ireland and stays in Ireland. While it hasn’t happened yet, I think they have all of the right ingredients in place. IDA has attracted all of the largest tech companies in the world to set up their European headquarters there, employing tens of thousands of Irish workers who are learning valuable skills, forming teams, and establishing customer relationships. They will see problems and opportunities and more and more will quit their jobs to join a startup.\n\nOnce they have the first success story, it kicks off a virtuous cycle. It inspires founders to start more companies and dream bigger. It give investors confidence to put more money into high risk startups that have the potential for high returns.\n\nIt’s just a matter of time…\n\nWhat is an Eisenhower Fellowship?"
