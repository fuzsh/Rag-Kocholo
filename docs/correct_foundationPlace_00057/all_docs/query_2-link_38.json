        "text": "Juniper Apstra automates and validates the design, deployment, and operations of your data center network, resulting in 90% lower OPEX and 85% faster deployment. Simply define the outcomes you need — Apstra responds by setting up the network, automating network management to ensure it’s secure and runs as intended. And with Marvis VNA for the Data Center, you gain a single Marvis dashboard for proactive and prescriptive data center actions. In addition, knowledgebase queries are simplified using the Marvis conversational interface (powered by GenAI).\n\nWant to future-proof your network? Read EMA’s research, based on a survey of more than 350 technology professionals to discover the future of network automation.\n\nJuniper's new AI-optimized, high-radix 800GbE leaf and spine data center fabrics provide advanced traffic management capabilities, ensuring high bandwidth, low latency, lossless, and scalable performance over Ethernet. Just as important, they reduce costs, accelerate innovation, maximize design flexibility, and help you avoid vendor lock-in. Our standards-based, automated network fabrics deliver scalability, reliability, and nonblocking, predictable performance. QFX Series, PTX Series, and ACX Series switches and routers offer leading throughput and scale with 400G interfaces, the Junos operating system’s open programmability, and comprehensive EVPN-VXLAN and IP fabric capabilities.\n\nRead Packet Pushers’ and Juniper’s white paper “7 Habits of Highly Effective DC Networkers” to discover how intent-based networking in multivendor environments goes hand in hand with good working habits.\n\nJuniper Validated Designs (JVDs) assure a complete data center solution, from switching and routing to operations and security. Our broad portfolio of switches (with silicon diversity) drives scale and performance, and a comprehensive DC security portfolio with unified threat prevention delivers unified zero-trust data center protection to safeguard users, applications, data, and infrastructure across all network connection points. With trusted, turnkey data center solutions from Juniper, you can confidently deploy new services 10x faster.\n\nAnalysys Mason researched the key motivations and challenges for data center automation. One key finding: DIY network automation often doesn’t improve productivity."
