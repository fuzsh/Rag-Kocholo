        "text": "With travel and supply chain uncertainty, it's more important than ever to adopt a nimble, adaptive approach to events.\n\nGarrett Burnett, Head of Global Events at Silicon Labs, says that one of the most important traits of an events professional is adaptability. It's not IF something will go not according to the plan, it's WHAT. An effective events person is ready with plan B and C without skipping a beat.\n\nNever has this trait been more important (and more put to the test) than in these early post-Covid times. Between airline staffing shortages, new Covid outbreaks and supply chain issues, there are a lot of external forces impacting events as normal. There's also lots of room for learning, growing and retooling.\n\nDuring the episode, Garrett walks us through SI Labs approach to industry events in 2022-2023, their user conference Works With, and innovative approaches to webinars and workshops. You'll hear the outcome of his recent trip to Embedded World in Germany, and how SI Labs is bringing live and interactive elements to their virtual developer conference and tech talk webinars. We also debate event success metrics, how to extract more value from event content, and basically geek out on all things events -- one of my favorite marketing topics.\n\nResources\n\nGarrett Burnett on LinkedIn\n\nSilicon Labs\n\nWorks With Conference\n\nEmbedded World\n\nTranscript"
