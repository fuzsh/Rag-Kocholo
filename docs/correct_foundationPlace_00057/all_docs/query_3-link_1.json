        "text": "Thanks for the guidance so far!\n\nAt the moment I want to look more into Linux servers because I have played around with the distributions to try to understand it further. Whenever I do not know something about a specific area of computers I will either research it until I have completed the task I created or I will buy a book to learn as much general knowledge about the task to complete it.\n\n@Rivitir I want to delve deeper into Linux, Windows, and Cisco. I believe that since I want to know more about these “technologies” that networking seems to be the best fit for me, but I am still unsure of what each position entails. Thanks for the different options you laid out for me so that I can better understand which paths I can take.\n\n@philipmjr There is still a lot I do not know about certifications, but when I see the word tossed around on the forums it makes me want to understand the idea better. I know that experience is key, but I have heard that to even get a job offer in today’s workplace requires a degree at the least and I believe that certifications will help me stand out a bit. Though I know gaining certifications will be a long, hard, costly road; I believe that it is in my best interest to learn as much as possible to fit any job criteria that I apply for.\n\n@rmuniz9336 I am doing my best at home to supplement my college learning and workplace skills by researching and reading as much as possible. I am also enrolled in some humanities classes, which help me with people skills(understanding and interacting). I have worked at four places, which gives me a certain mindset of how I need to help my teammates out to benefit our workplace. I will definitely keep trying out new concepts that I see in Spice Works to benefit my chances as much as possible!\n\nOnce again, I cannot thank you guys enough for helping me out. These words can and will shape my future.\n\nDrewM wrote:\n\nThanks for the guidance so far!\n\nAt the moment I want to look more into Linux servers because I have played around with the distributions to try to understand it further.

These words can and will shape my future.\n\nCool. Sounds like you’re wanting to do the same I did. But don’t follow my path. I went to a tech school and like most tech schools they force windows certs down your throat. It was a real waste. Of course at that time I didn’t know what linux was. But anyway… here is my suggestion for you:\n\nSince your just starting out get your A+, Network+, and Linux+. This will give you a good foundation to work from.\n\nThen get your MCP or something. Just the basics so you can prove that you have Windows knowledge. Most companies will want you to have a focus on one, but at least know something about the other.\n\nLastly get your CCNA for a good intermediate level of cisco networking. then take LPI or best is RHCE.\n\nAll these tests are time consuming and it will add up to a lot of dough. So pace yourself. This isn’t a rule of thumb just to give you a good track that you can go through. If your hardware and networking is good, skip the A+ and network+ but only you can be the judge of that.\n\nRichard Muniz made a very important point bringing in people skills. One of the biggest complaints I hear about IT staff (including my colleagues here) is that they are unapproachable and just grunt at people. Unless your career path is to be locked in a room with servers all day, the only human interactions being with the AC maintenance guy then you still need to keep your skills there in being a human being…\n\nLearning to gauge people’s skill level from how they talk and actively adjusting how you explain things to that level makes you much more useful than if all you can do is talk techno-babble. People will be more willing to engage with you, more willing to deal with you…it also makes life a hell of a lot easier while trying to get answers to questions. Interpersonal skills are incredibly important because they are THE most transferable skills you can ever acquire. Regardless of where your career takes you, be it into IT or on a different path, you will always have to deal with other people. Doing that well is a massive plus point for any employer when looking to employ you. It comes across in how you interview, when asked for strengths if you can give solid examples of when you used these skills in conjunction with the technical skills it shows that regardless of how tech you are, you are still human. HR departments like human beings.\n\nDessembrae wrote:\n\nRichard Muniz made a very important point bringing in people skills.

HR departments like human beings.\n\nPeople skills are critical, I tend to hire people for helpdesk positions who have a mix of sales/customer service and technical experience over people who took a purely technical path. My user base expects people who can talk to them and interact positively, not the It stereotype.\n\nFor me the best thing I ever did for my IT career was spend time in sales. I bring out my sales training every time I write a proposal or present an idea.\n\nThough no one has mentioned anything for/against it, I’d like to emphasize that the ‘BS’ itself may well be the single most important ‘certification’ you’ll ever get.\n\nI mention this because, as you gain experience, you’ll be tempted more and more to jump at job opportunities before you wrap up the degree. Over the years I’ve seen many, many people argue no degree is needed in order to be sucessful in tech. They’re right, but they fail to point out (or perhaps they’re unaware of) the large number of opportunities to be missed by not having that single most-important certification.\n\nExample: I’ve been on the hiring end for both big and small companies. In every case, the first step in the review process was to toss non-degreed job applicants from the pile. Those applications were considered only if all degreed applicants were exhausted. It didn’t matter what certifications an applicant held – degreed applicants always got first consideration. Why?\n\n(1) Because pure tech knowledge can often be learned relatively quickly. Work skills (meeting deadlines, prioritizing multiple tasks, dealing with requirements, etc) must be learned and proven over time through the kind of experience typically involved in attaining a degree. A certification implies that you have some narrow field of knowledge. A degree implies that you know how to work.\n\n(2) Because a tech degree implies that you paid enough attention to pass courses on design/development principals. I’m a software developer so, for me, this is the difference between a self-taught programmer that strings code together (“DLL’s? Nah, just put everything in single VB file” a.k.a. “me in high school”) and someone who approaches a project from the “big picture” point of view, designing a solution that follows established standards, scales well and can be easily understood and maintained by others.\n\nAnother example: Less than two weeks ago I checked into a new “Health IT” certification program. Apparently the University of Texas at Austin (I live in Austin) has the pilot/model program for what will eventually be HIT certification programs across the US. During the previous 9 months, graduates of the new 15-credit-hour program have had over a 90% hire rate despite the worse-than-normal job market. Here’s the kicker: although the certification itself doesn’t require a degree, admittance to the program has been limited to students who already held at least a BS. I asked why this was so and was told that there were more applicants than open positions so the school could afford to limit admittance to “the cream of the crop” (their words, not mine). This immediately reminded me of how my past and present employers have gone about selecting the initial round of job applicants to interview: require a 'BS\"\n\nYour best bet is to keep doing exactly what you’re doing: get a degree and get some real-world work experience at the same time. Never mind the other certifications for now – a future employer won’t expect them from a new graduate and many employers may pay for part or all of a certification course if it represents a skill useful to the employer. If you get a chance to take a cert test for free then go for it. Otherwise wait and pay for it only if it makes sense for the specific type of work you’ll eventually do. Certs expire. Degrees don’t.\n\nGood luck!\n\nExperience will be the best thing for you, you will learn the most, having an IT internship in school is also a leg up on many people including someone like myself, because of a lack of experience it took me a lot longer to find a job. I do not currently have any certs but do plan to pursue some. I also got my Associates of Science and then eventually earned a Bachelors of Information Technology. While doing this I have learned a lot more, I still wouldn’t pass up the education I had. I learned some things that I might otherwise have still stayed in the dark about such as project management etc…\n\nIf you really want to know how to plan things out though you have set some goals. For me for instance I originally wanted to go the programming route, but then decided that it was too much of an anti-social position so I chose to move towards Administration, and Networking. My long term goals though include wanting to run my own company or become management someday. While I all ready have a good feel for business and how things work, I still am considering a Masters eventually probably an MBA.\n\nIf you can see where you eventually want to be it will do wonders to help you plan out your course. And the sooner you do it the faster you will get there.\n\nIT knowledge and cerst are great, and certainly important. However, if you really want to know how to be a more valuable asset to a company…\n\nDon’t limit yourself to just IT knowledge. Some of the best and most successful IT people I know became successful not because they keep the systems running well, but because they learned how to leverage their IT knowledge to the benefit of all other facets/departments of the business. I would encourage you to take some accounting and marketing classes, and take your past sales experience and build on it as well. By doing this, you will gain a much better perspective of business as a whole and how IT can be a better asset within the other processes.\n\nThe guys I’ve known that take the attitude of “I just keep it running” or “I mind my own business and stay out of things” are not bad guys, but none of them are upwardly mobile either. Those kinds of guys tend to stagnate and find themselves stuck in either the same job, or a series of similar jobs with no real advancement.\n\nIn short, learn to be a faciliator, not just a tech or manager.\n\nHere’s my two cents and don’t let it scare you. it’s a mix of to-do’s and my tips (for whatever they’re worth). Do not attempt to be an expert in any more than 1 to 3 specific areas. Technology is currently evolving faster than a normal human being can absorb. Find a good “needed everywhere” skill to get your foot in the door and then add on whatever special interest fields you want to pursue. Once you are in full time, do not settle into a rut. Try to at least read about tech that you can relate to and might be of use to your company. Keep doing the dinky things. You would be amazed at how superman looking you are to the average Joe just trying to complete a Word Doc… Keep yourself tuned-up with what is in the server room and on people’s desktops. You will quickly find yourself rather useless to any future employers if you loose your full-time gig if you’re not. Don’t forget, there are a billion and a half people out there already established or making their way to being established as mini-Einsteins that will make you feel like a complete idiot/dinosaur when you meet them. Do not let the Einstein guys make you think that you are an idiot. Keep trucking and feel reassured by you accomplishments so far. If your company runs smoothly, you should realize that you are the person making it run smoothly, give yourself a little credit. When that world-ending event occurs and it is beyond your skill level, man up and take the steps to get it resolved quickly. You might feel like you failed (and possibly so) but your boss will see that even when outside of your comfort zone, you can handle the stress and get the job done and people back to work. Even when all you did was call in someone else to fix it. Learn from the mistakes, don’t let them happen twice. Talk to as many people in different fields of work as you can. I.T. isn’t all just computers and networks. Do NOT become arrogant and all-knowing. You never will be THAT all-knowing. there are some people that just seem to pickup anything computer related without even trying. Most of us are not those people so if you get too “know it all” someone WILL knock you off your thrown. Above all, if you cannot adapt on the fly, respond to emergencies on a moments notice and know how to really communicate with people from the lowest employee to the highest CEO, then don’t get into this line of work. Like most everything else, you are never recognized for doing a kick-ass job ever day but you will get hammered quicker than most other types of jobs if something goes wrong. There’s tons more to all this crap, just keep asking around here. this place is full of people that know from experience. Finally, please pardon my grammer. I’ve never been accused of being a writer!"
