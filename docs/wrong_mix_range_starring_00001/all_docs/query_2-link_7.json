Production is set to start in January 2025 in Australia. Additional casting is ongoing.\n\nSolution Entertainment handles international sales. CAA Media Finance reps domestic.\n\nPic will be directed by veteran stunt professional Mark Vanselow, whose career as an action sequence director, action designer, stunt coordinator and stuntman includes two SAG nominations for best stunt ensemble (Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) and winning a Vulture Stunt Award (2023) and a Taurus World Stunt Award (2008). He has been Neeson’s stunt double for more than 20 films, including all the Taken movies, and both Ice Road movies (Ice Road 2 is currently in post). Script comes from Thompson Evans (Reckoning).\n\nCode Entertainment will fully finance. Code’s Al Corley, Bart Rosenblatt, and Eugene Musso will produce. Jonathan Dana will executive-produce with Code’s Rich Freeman and Lisa Wilson and Myles Nestel of The Solution Entertainment Group. It marks The Solution’s fifth movie with Neeson.\n\n“We are so very fortunate to be able to make another picture with the extraordinary Liam Neeson and the enormously talented Mark Vanselow. We look forward to another creative journey with our partners and friends,” said Code’s Al Corley and Bart Rosenblatt.\n\nLiam Neeson is represented by CAA and attorney Mark Stankevich.
