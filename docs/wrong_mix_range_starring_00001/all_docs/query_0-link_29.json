        "text": "Quentin Tarantino has hinted that a third Kill Bill film could be his next movie.\n\nThe director has said he will be retiring after his 10th movie, and has not confirmed just what that project will be.\n\nHowever, when asked if it could be Kill Bill 3 while speaking at the Rome Film Festival, where he was receiving a lifetime achievement award from Italian horror legend Dario Argento, the 58-year-old said: ‘Why not?’\n\nKill Bill: Volume 1 was released in 2003 and followed The Bride (Uma Thurman) as she sought revenge against a group of assassins and their leader, after they tried to kill her and her unborn child on her wedding day.\n\nThe film was originally planned to be one single release but after the run time exceeded four hours, Volume 2 was released the following year.\n\nThe end of that film saw The Bride kill Bill (David Carradine) and leave with her daughter to start a new life, and in recent years, Tarantino has addressed the possibility of a third movie to make a trilogy.\n\nOne possibility raised was that Uma’s real-life daughter Maya Hawke could come on board to play the Bride’s daughter BB.\n\nWhile we wait for that to come to fruition, Tarantino has another project in the works, that won’t be on the big screen.\n\nSaying he wants to make a comedy, the director told festival boss Antonio Monda: ‘It’s not like my next movie. It’s a piece of something else that I’m thinking about doing — and I’m not going to describe what it is. But part of this thing, there is supposed to be a Spaghetti Western in it.\n\n‘I’m looking forward to shooting that [thing] because it’s going to be really fun. Because I want to shoot it in the Spaghetti Western style where everybody’s speaking a different language.\n\n‘The Mexican Bandido is an Italian; the hero is an American; the bad sheriff is a German; the Mexican saloon girl is Israeli. And everybody is speaking a different language. And [the actors] just know – OK, when he’s finished talking then I can talk.’\n\nTarantino plans to bow out after his next movie to leave the industry on a high, previously telling Bill Maher: ‘I know film history and from here on in, filmmakers do not get better.\n\n‘I don’t have a reason that I would want to say out loud, that’s going to win any argument in a court of public opinion or supreme court or anything like that.\n\n‘At the same time, working for 30 years doing as many movies as I’ve done, it’s not as many as other people, but that’s a long career. That’s a really long career.’\n\nTarantino first directed Reservoir Dogs in 1992, and went on to release Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, the Kill Bills, Death Proof, Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained, The Hateful Eight and Once Upon A Time In Hollywood.\n\nMORE : Influencer goes viral as she claims Chinese TV show used her photo and replaced her face"
