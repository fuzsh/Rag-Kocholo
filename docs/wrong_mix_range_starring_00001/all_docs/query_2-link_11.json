        "text": "\"A saint's gotta be a sinner first, don't he?\" Samuel Goldwyn Films has revealed a new official trailer for the hitman action thriller called In the Land of Saints and Sinners, made by producer / director Robert Lorenz. This originally premiered at the 2023 Venice Film Festival last year in the Orizzonti Extra section (watch the first trailer). In the land of saints and sinners, some sins can't be buried. Liam Neeson stars as Finbar, eager to leave his dark past behind. Set in Ireland in the 1970s, ready to leave his dark past behind, Finbar Murphy leads a quiet life in the remote coastal town of Glencolmcille, far from the political violence that grips the rest of the country. But when a menacing crew of terrorists arrive, led by a ruthless woman named Doirean, Finbar is drawn into an increasingly vicious game of cat and mouse, forcing him to choose between exposing his secret identity or defending his friends and neighbors. The main cast also includes Kerry Condon, Jack Gleeson, Colm Meaney, Ciar√°n Hinds, and Sarah Greene. This looks solid - better than most of Neeson's other more bland action movies recently. Might just be worth a watch after all.\n\nHere's the new trailer (+ poster) for Robert Lorenz's In the Land of Saints and Sinners, from YouTube:\n\nYou can also rewatch the first trailer for Lorenz's In the Land of Saints and Sinners here, for more footage."
