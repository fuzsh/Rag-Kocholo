        "text": "A-Team, The\n\nThe A-Team represents the motion picture industry's male-oriented answer to such franchises as Sex and the City and Twilight. To combat the new wave of estrogen-powered movies, Fox has fallen back on a tried-but-true formula: the adrenaline-and-te...\n\nAfter.Life\n\nI admire filmmakers who take chances and defy expectations. Admittedly, that sort of thing doesn't always work, and there are flaws aplenty in After.Life, but the criss-crossing between drama, thriller, and horror is nothing if not arresting. It ...\n\nBallad of Buster Scruggs, The\n\nThose wacky Coens are at it again. And those serious Coens. And those loquacious Coens. The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, a paean to pre-revisionist Westerns, allows the Oscar-winning brothers to try out nearly every weapon in their considerable ...\n\nBatman Begins\n\nOf all the major comic book characters to transition to a less static visual media, none has been more mistreated than the Bat-Man. As originally envisioned by creator Bob Kane in 1939, Batman was a dark character who walked the tightrope between ...\n\nBattleship\n\nLet me start this review off on a positive note. Battleship is in 2-D, not 3-D, so there are no issues with motion blur, low light levels, and general eye discomfort. There are some nice establishing shots of Hawaii; I might want to go there if I w...\n\nBlacklight\n\nIt’s February. That means it’s time for cold weather and snow, groundhogs having their day, and Liam Neeson coming out with yet another kick-ass action/thriller. (Do not confuse the term “kick-ass” with “good” or even “watchable.”)...\n\nChloe\n\nSince imprinting his name on the international indie box office with his mid-'90s one-two punch of Exotica and The Sweet Hereafter, Toronto-based filmmaker Atom Egoyan has been struggling to regain his footing. In one way or another, his last few ...\n\nChronicles of Narnia, The: Prince Caspian\n\nFor the second installment of The Chronicles of Narnia, director Andrew Adamson has caught a severe case of Lord of the Rings-itis. While the 2005 adaptation of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe kept close to the tone of the book, Prince Caspia...\n\nChronicles of Narnia, The: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\n\nAs the bean counters toil, Eustace waits. So does Jill. And Polly and Digory, too. Walden Media has optioned all seven of C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia books, but whether the other six (or, more likely, five - since The Horse and His Boy seem...\n\nChronicles of Narnia, The: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is fantasy-lite. With its PG rating and aversion to anything shocking or overly grotesque, it's the bastard stepchild of The Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter. A dull, meandering storyline an..."
