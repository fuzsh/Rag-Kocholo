        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n29 Apr 2024, 14:13\n\nA new Irish action-thriller film landed on Netflix last week, and it has been seriously impressing viewers.\n\nIn the Land of Saints and Sinners premiered at the Venice Film Festival last year, and was added to the streaming service on Friday (25th April). Set in 1970s Ireland during The Troubles, it focuses on former assassin Finbar Murphy (played by Neeson) who has left his dark past behind him as he leads a quiet life in a coastal Irish town, far from the political violence that grips the rest of the country.\n\nWhen menacing terrorists show up, led by a woman called Doirean (played by Kerry Condon from The Banshees of Inisherin) Finbar is drawn into an increasingly vicious game of cat and mouse, and has has to choose between exposing his secret identity and defending his friends and neighbours\n\nThe movie also stars Sarah Greene from Normal People, and Jack Gleeson, who famously portrayed Joffrey Baratheon in Game of Thrones.\n\nIt was mainly shot in County Donegal, with additional filming in Dublin\n\nHaving had the weekend to digest the movie, fans have taken to social media to shower it with praise. One person wrote: “In the land of Saints & Sinners, brilliant movie on Netflix. Cast is top class & in my personal opinion the best film Liam Neeson has done since Taken & Batman.”\n\nAnother viewer agreed, saying: “In The Land Of Saints & Sinners: 5 Stars Out Of 5!!! Neeson’s Best Since Taken!!! A Truly Engaging Neo Western Irish Thriller!!!\"\n\nOne viewer added: “In the land of Saints & Sinners on #Netflix is excellent”\n\nSomeone else wrote: “Just finished watching the new Liam Neeson film on Netflix. In The Land of Saints & Sinners. Very good and stunning scenery in Donegal.”\n\nAnd the critics concur as well, as the film currently sits at an impressive 82 percent on review aggregating site Rotten Tomatoes."
