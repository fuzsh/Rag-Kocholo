        "text": "“Memory.” Just the title brings back that horrible memory of the Cats movie I had to endure a few years back.\n\nMemory. Something Liam Neeson apparently lost, because about eight years ago he said he was going to stop making these types of movies because he thought he was too old and they were rather silly. Yet here we are, with him playing a hit man with a heart of gold (ah, I miss the good ol’ days when the movies had the hookers with a heart of gold.)\n\nIt’s unfortunate that a talented director, the 78-year-old Martin Campbell (“The Mask of Zorro”) got a few decent actors and an interesting premise.\n\nAlex Lewis (Neeson) is a hitman who doesn’t want to take out the 12-year-old girl he was assigned to eliminate, and when he discovers that immigrant children were sex trafficked to some rich and powerful people, he decides to go all Dragon Tattoo on their butts.\n\nLewis has a habit of writing things on his arms because he’s beginning to suffer from Alzheimer’s (he’s taking pills for it, and has a brother with it). Well, that brought back a great memory. One of the FBI agents here is played by Guy Pearce, who over 20 years ago had to write things on his body and take photos, to remember things he was investigating in the incredible “Memento” (the first film that got Christopher Nolan some attention.)\n\nYes, at 70-years-old (well, in a few months), Neeson still has those special set of skills, which let him break into any building (no matter how much security), beat anybody up (no matter how much younger and bigger), pick any lock, and hit any target with his gun and silencer.\n\nThe first person he takes out is fun, because it’s a guy who we see driving dangerously in a hospital parking lot and treating the staff there horribly. The next scene shows Lewis approaching his handler, saying he’s done and is retiring. He’s told what they’re always told when they want to do that one last job and ride off into the sunset. That they won’t allow him to quit, with veiled threats about knowing where his brother is hospitalized. Which makes me wonder – do hitmen ever realize that when their services are no longer required, their bosses are probably going to take them out?\n\nThey obviously don’t want somebody deciding to fess up, or give a reporter a big scoop. I’m not sure why when they’re told they can’t leave, they don’t just take the money, pretend they’ll do the job, and go right to the cops. Get witness protection, and…oh hell, why am I even trying to make sense of this rubbish? It’s Liam Neeson going to town on bad guys; although when he also takes out good guys, like a cop, it’s tough to keep rooting for him just because he has some bizarre code of ethics that won’t let him take out a kid; but I digress.\n\nThis is all a remake of a well-received 2003 Belgian film (“The Memory of a Killer,” with the title later changed to “The Alzheimer Case”), and again, it’s a great premise. It’s a shame something better wasn’t done with it.\n\nSince Campbell directed two James Bond movies (“Casino Royale,” “Golden Eye”), I’ll use this analogy. In 007 movies, the bad guy’s machine gun misses, but Bond always hits his mark with one or two shots. Well, I always find it amusing how with Alzheimer/dementia characters on screen, the protagonist never forgets something important. It’s always small things like “Where did I put my keys?” Or “Who is this woman in bed with me?” But we’ve all been there – am I right, fellas? Okay, I’m joshing. I never have been. But…back to the review.\n\nAlex Lewis (Neeson) is based in El Paso, where he was raised. A lot of the scenes shot there are nice to look at. He works for a boss (Lee Boardman, who has half of an incredible name) in Mexico City. It seems like that would make things tricky getting across the border, carrying a suitcase full of firearms and envelopes full of cash. Anyway, FBI agents Vincent (Guy Pearce), Linda (Taj Atwal), and Hugo (Harold Torres) – who is working the case on behalf of Mexico, are tracking a child smuggling ring. Yet now somebody is killing all the folks they were looking at.\n\nAll of them (including Lewis) are concerned with Beatriz (Mia Sanchez), the girl whose dad was pimping her out. And those segments are touching. Yet we have that usual cliche of the boss (Ray Fearon, who was in Campbell’s “The Protégé” last year), who doesn’t get along with the people working the case. I just kept waiting for him to say something like, “One more mistake and I’ll have your badge!”\n\nJust once in a movie like this, I’d love for the boss to say, “Officer O’Malley, you’re doing an excellent job on this case! Sometimes you may play by your own set of rules, and you can be a loose cannon, but you do a dangerous job, and you always get the results we’re looking for.” Ah, I can dream, can’t I?\n\nThe villains in this were also one-note, cardboard characters. That includes Monica Bellucci, who plays a rich CEO that for some reason, keeps covering up for her pedophile son (Josh Taylor).\n\nThe screenwriter or director really needed to do more for us to get to know these characters and actually care about them. They also needed to get rid of scenes that were completely idiotic (two of those would be the ones with Natalie Anderson playing a trophy wife whose husband has been…eliminated).\n\nA much better movie that deals with Alzheimer’s in a way that blew me away, was “The Father” from a few years ago. It stars Olivia Coleman, Olivia Williams, and maybe a few other Olivias I don’t remember. And it earned Anthony Hopkins the Oscar everyone thought was going to go to the late Chadwick Boseman. If you need more shooting and violence in your Alzheimer films – check out “Memento.” Find either, watch them, and thank me later.\n\nIf I graded this film on a curve with all Liam Neeson movies, it would get a B-. Grading it on my scale, it gets a D+."
