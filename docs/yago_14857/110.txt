Sandra Goldbacher, whose credits include 1998's The Governess, has signed to direct The Robber Bride, for UK outfit The Producers and Canada's FilmWorks.

The film, based on Canadian author Margaret Atwood's novel of the same name about sexual power and female friendship, was optioned by FilmWorks.

"Sandra knew this novel before I even sent it to her," said The Producers' Jeanna Polley. As a writer has yet to be contracted, the project is not expected to shoot until next year.

Goldbacher is also attached to a host of other UK projects including an adaptation of Emile Zola's novel Nana, which will be a co-production between BBC Films and Berwin and Dempsey Productions; Me Without You, which Goldbacher is co-writing with Laurence Coriat for Dakota Films; and Prophet Town, which is in development at Pond Life Entertainment. The latter is based on Louis Bromfield's novel The Strange Case Of Miss Annie Spragg and is also being adapted by Coriat.
