        "text": "Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on page 10.\n\nNow Playing\n\n''THE AVENGERS,'' starring Uma Thurman, Ralph Fiennes, Sean Connery and Eileen Atkins. Directed by Jeremiah Chechik (PG, 100 minutes). Sometimes major movie studios should be afraid to screen expensive fiascoes for the press, but they go ahead anyway. ''The Avengers'' is Warner Brothers' would-be blockbuster that actually had its light hidden beneath a bushel until opening day, and no wonder. With pseudo-suave repartee that would make Austin Powers blush and with so many shades of ''Howard the Duck'' that one scene depicts man-size pastel teddy bears sitting around a conference table, it's a film to gall fans of the old television series and perplex anyone else. I can't remember another Friday morning show where I heard actual cries of ''Ugh!'' on the way out the door (Janet Maslin).\n\n''BLADE,'' starring Wesley Snipes, Stephen Dorff, Traci Lords and Kris Kristofferson. Directed by Stephen Norrington (R, 120 minutes). Vampires are plotting to take over the world, and the only person who can save the planet is a vampiric half-human superhero named Blade. So much fake blood drips, gushes, explodes and congeals in this hyperkinetic science-fiction horror film adapted from a popular comic book that there's barely a scene that isn't drenched in red. Mr. Snipes's Blade is a low-rent Arnold Schwarzenegger imitation dressed in a ludicrous mixture of black leather and what look like car seat belts. There's lots of morphing and Hong Kong action movie-style acrobatics. Mr. Dorff is the bratty leader of the young vampire rebels. The visuals are garish, the acting wretched (Stephen Holden).\n\n* ''THE GOVERNESS,'' starring Minnie Driver and Tom Wilkinson. Directed by Sandra Goldbacher (R, 114 minutes). It is the early 1840's, and Rosina (Ms. Driver), a headstrong young Sephardic Jewish woman living in London, poses as a Gentile to get a job as a governess for the Cavendish family on a remote Scottish island. Falling in love with the skittish, devoutly Christian head of the household (Tom Wilkinson), a gentleman inventor with whom she has a stormy affair, she becomes his collaborator in the invention of photography. The ravishingly handsome film works on several levels: as a proto-feminist fable, a meditation on still photography and its relation to real life, and a portrait of lovers whose religious difference becomes an unbridgeable emotional gap. Ms. Driver holds the picture with a solid performance that falls short of great (Holden).\n\n* ''LOLITA,'' starring Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain. Directed by Adrian Lyne (R, 137 minutes). At last, Mr. Lyne's fine, deeply felt adaption of Nabokov's diabolical masterpiece can been seen in the large-screen format it truly deserves. Why go out? Because the detail and texture of this lavishly produced film shine theatrically in ways that weren't possible on Showtime, and because the film's mostly unalloyed subtlety (except in its opening and closing sections) rewards a closer view. Mr. Lyne's direction is the best work of his career. Mr. Irons's splendid performance conveys a tragicomic blend of ardor and conscience, while Ms. Swain plays the title role as a startlingly unpredictable adult-child hybrid. For a culture so dangerously obsessed with youth and beauty, this haunting ''Lolita'' is a fascinating sign of its times (Maslin).\n\n* ''NEXT STOP WONDERLAND,'' starring Hope Davis and Alan Gelfant. Directed by Brad Anderson (R, 111 minutes). Will Erin (Ms. Davis), an attractive, introspective night-shift nurse, and Alan (Mr. Gelfant), a plumber and aspiring marine biologist who was obviously meant for her, collide on the streets of Boston and live happily ever after? The setup of this romantic comedy about dating in the 90's may seem cliched, but the witty, beautifully acted and edited film refreshes the genre with the acuteness of Mr. Anderson's observations about people and middle-class urban life in general. Ms. Davis creates a wonderfully complex portrait of an idealistic introvert coping with loneliness, disappointment and pressures from all sides, including (in the movie's funniest scenes) some ardently self-centered suitors who answer a personal ad. A rich Brazilian bossa nova score gives the movie the mood of bittersweet longing (Holden).\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
