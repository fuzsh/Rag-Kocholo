        "text": "Our world is so overrun with photographic images that it's amazing to realize that the art of photography is barely 150 years old. Who would have thought, until it had been done, that it was possible to capture and freeze a moment of time on a piece of paper? Sandra Goldbacher's ravishingly handsome film ''The Governess'' takes us back to the spooky moment when the pioneers of photography discovered how to create a lasting photographic image. That the inventors in her film -- a gentleman scientist named Charles Cavendish and his daughter's governess, Rosina da Silva (Minnie Driver) -- are fictional characters gives her a metaphoric license that sticking to the facts couldn't have allowed.\n\nWhen Charles and Rosina stumble on the idea of ''salt fixed'' prints (it's actually Rosina's idea, although Charles, her tutor in photography, later takes credit for it), they are conducting a secret, wildly passionate affair, and many of the first photographs they take are of each other. The saucy Rosina poses for a series in which she plays Salome doing the dance of the seven veils. While Charles, a skittish Victorian Scot, is asleep, she takes a picture of him lying naked.\n\nThe scenes of these photo sessions, in which a single eye is shown peering feverishly through a lens, resonate long after the film has ended, because of the poignancy with which they evoke the difference between stop-time and real time. If Rosina's photograph of the naked Charles will last forever, his tempestuous passion for her is evanescent and fraught with guilt and betrayal. Because the cinematography of ''The Governess'' is so richly panoramic, the movie forces you to contemplate the emotional power exerted by film, which is, after all just a series of flickering photographic images flashed on a screen.\n\nQuestions about trusting the truth of the frozen image in a universe of ceaseless change aren't the only ideas that the movie tosses around with the same spirited abandon exhibited by its central character, Rosina. A rebellious life-hungry sensualist, Rosina grows up in an affluent Sephardic Jewish household in London. Her world suddenly shatters in the early 1840's when her father, a successful fish merchant, is murdered on the street and the family is plunged into debt.\n\nRejecting an arranged marriage with an older man, Rosina determines to disguise her Jewishness (the movie makes much of virulent anti-Semitism in her world), and find a job. Posing as Mary Blackchurch, a Protestant of partly Italian descent, she takes a job as a governess to the Cavendish family on a remote Scottish island.\n\nAlthough Rosina carries off the charade, the movie makes a major point of showing the gap between 19th-century Christian and Jewish cultures. Rosina may be a rebel, but she remains unshakably rooted to her Jewish faith. Dreamy flashbacks in which she hungers for the life she left behind are steeped in Jewish ritual and chant, and she secretly continues to observe Passover. At the same time, she must observe Christian rituals in the Cavendish family chapel.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
