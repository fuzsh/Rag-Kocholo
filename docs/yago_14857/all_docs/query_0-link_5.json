        "text": "Join a Discussion on Movies\n\nBy STEPHEN HOLDEN\n\nur world is so overrun with photographic images that it's amazing to realize that the art of photography is barely 150 years old. Who would have thought, until it had been done, that it was possible to capture and freeze a moment of time on a piece of paper?\n\nSandra Goldbacher's ravishingly handsome film \"The Governess\" takes us back to the spooky moment when the pioneers of photography discovered how to create a lasting photographic image. That the inventors in her film -- a gentleman scientist named Charles Cavendish and his daughter's governess, Rosina da Silva (Minnie Driver) -- are fictional characters gives her a metaphoric license that sticking to the facts couldn't have allowed.\n\nWhen Charles and Rosina stumble on the idea of \"salt fixed\" prints (it's actually Rosina's idea, although Charles, her tutor in photography, later takes credit for it), they are conducting a secret, wildly passionate affair, and many of the first photographs they take are of each other.\n\nThe saucy Rosina poses for a series in which she plays Salome doing the dance of the seven veils. While Charles, a skittish Victorian Scot, is asleep, she takes a picture of him lying naked.\n\nThe scenes of these photo sessions, in which a single eye is shown peering feverishly through a lens, resonate long after the film has ended, because of the poignancy with which they evoke the difference between stop-time and real time.\n\nIf Rosina's photograph of the naked Charles will last forever, his tempestuous passion for her is evanescent and fraught with guilt and betrayal. Because the cinematography of \"The Governess\" is so richly panoramic, the movie forces you to contemplate the emotional power exerted by film, which is, after all just a series of flickering photographic images flashed on a screen.\n\nQuestions about trusting the truth of the frozen image in a universe of ceaseless change aren't the only ideas that the movie tosses around with the same spirited abandon exhibited by its central character, Rosina.\n\nA rebellious life-hungry sensualist, Rosina grows up in an affluent Sephardic Jewish household in London. Her world suddenly shatters in the early 1840s when her father, a successful fish merchant, is murdered on the street and the family is plunged into debt.\n\nRejecting an arranged marriage with an older man, Rosina determines to disguise her Jewishness (the movie makes much of virulent anti-Semitism in her world), and find a job. Posing as Mary Blackchurch, a Protestant of partly Italian descent, she takes a job as a governess to the Cavendish family on a remote Scottish island.\n\nAlthough Rosina carries off the charade, the movie makes a major point of showing the gap between 19th-century Christian and Jewish cultures. Rosina may be a rebel, but she remains unshakably rooted to her Jewish faith.\n\nDreamy flashbacks in which she hungers for the life she left behind are steeped in Jewish ritual and chant, and she secretly continues to observe Passover. At the same time, she must observe Christian rituals in the Cavendish family chapel.\n\nBut it is her affair with the head of the household that reveals the most profound and painful differences between the two traditions. Where Charles rails about sin and hellfire and being \"consumed\" by his passion, Rosina pursues their relationship with free-spirited determination.\n\nShe has little comprehension of what Charles is going through and not much sympathy. Were Charles to learn she was Jewish, he would probably denounce her as a witch. Although Ms. Goldbacher is sympathetic to both characters, she is clearly on the side of Rosina, who emerges as a proto-feminist hero.\n\n\"The Governess\" is a wonderful showcase for Ms. Driver, whose Rosina is a complicated, intimidating character. She pursues an adulterous affair with the same stubborn feistiness she shows in her dealings with Clementina (Florence Hoath), the mischievous, morbidly inclined little monster in her charge.\n\nIf Ms. Driver's performance is strong, it is less than great, because her face lacks the transparency of expression that would transport us inside her character's mind.\n\nTom Wilkinson's Charles is a harrowingly effective portrait of a guarded, puritanical man swept off his feet and nearly unstrung by a passion he resists with all his will. Harriet Walter is equally impressive as his idle, snobbish wife who wonders out loud in a sweetly curdled voice if it's possible to die of disappointment and boredom.\n\nJonathan Rhys Meyers is touching as the Cavendish's emotionally unstable son, Henry, who develops an obsessive infatuation with Rosina.\n\nThe movie takes some missteps. Rosina's ability to support her family in luxurious style from her earnings as a governess is implausible. The screenplay includes some glaring lapses into contemporary slang. And dramatically, the movie peters out in its disappointingly perfunctory final scenes.\n\nBut \"The Governess,\" which opens Friday in New York City, still leaves a lasting after-image.\n\n\"The Governess\" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nudity and sexual situations.\n\nPRODUCTION NOTES\n\n\"The Governess\""
