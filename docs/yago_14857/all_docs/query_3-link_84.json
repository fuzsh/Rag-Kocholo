        "text": "A CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS IN THE FIRST TWO DECADES OF BRITISH VIDEO ART\n\nIn the late 1960s video technology became available outside the broadcast industry and artists were among the first to use this unique new medium. The following chronology of early video art in the UK does not attempt to list all activity but is a selection of key screenings, exhibitions and related events from 1971 to the early 1990s.\n\n1971\n\nTV INTERRUPTIONS, SCOTTISH TELEVISION\n\nTen works by David Hall, commissioned by the Scottish Arts Council for the Edinburgh Festival, were transmitted by Scottish Television unannounced without credit over a ten day period (a selection was later distributed as 7 TV Pieces). These were the first artist interventions on British television and have come to be regarded as a formative moment in British video art.\n\nONE, ANGELA FLOWERS GALLERY, LONDON\n\nExhibit by Ian Breakwell and Mike Leggett. Images of labourers shovelling earth in a circle relayed live to a video monitor in the gallery window often confused passers-by who had watched Apollo 14 astronaut activities on the moon broadcast on TV the same day.\n\n1972\n\nA SURVEY OF THE AVANT-GARDE IN BRITAIN, GALLERY HOUSE, LONDON\n\nExhibition of objects, performances, films, conceptual works etc., included the first showing of a multi-screen video art installation in Britain: 60 TV Sets by David Hall in collaboration with Tony Sinden. The TV sets were tuned or mis-tuned to broadcast signals, and all parameters of picture quality were variously utilised. This was an important precursor of British multi-channel video installation work.\n\nTIME BASED MEDIA, MAIDSTONE COLLEGE OF ART\n\nThe first video provision in the UK for fine art undergraduates and outside artists was established by David Hall as the Time Based Media workshop, Maidstone College of Art (now University for the Creative Arts). Later a number of video artists were awarded working fellowships in the college with the aid of Arts Council bursaries.\n\n1973\n\nART WITHOUT OBJECTS, TATE GALLERY, LONDON\n\nAs part of a series of lectures on Land Art, Conceptual Art, films by artists etc, Mick Hartney introduced the first screenings at the Tate of artists video, including performance recordings of Joseph Beuys and Gilbert & George.\n\nOPEN CIRCUIT, SCOTTISH ARTS COUNCIL GALLERY, EDINBURGH\n\nExhibition of video, photography and film, included an ongoing performance installation by David Hall using video equipment.\n\nARTS COUNCIL OF GREAT BRITAIN FUNDING\n\nThe Artists Films Committee of the Arts Council of Great Britain made its first award for experimental video. This became the Artists Film and Video Committee in April 1979.\n\n1974\n\nFIFTH EXPERIMENTAL FILM FESTIVAL, KNOKKE-HEIST, BELGIUM\n\nFirst Knokke-Heist international festival to include videotapes and video installations with works by Nam June Paik, Peter Campus, The Vasulkas, Peter Weibel, Jean-Paul Boyer. Britain represented by David Hall.\n\nSECOND HOUSE, BBC TV\n\nBBC2 arts programme Second House transmitted abstract colour video work Entering by Peter Donebauer.\n\nFANTASY FACTORY\n\nJohn Hopkins and Sue Hall set up Fantasy Factory, an independent video editing resource created to facilitate access for community groups, community arts projects and artists.\n\n1975\n\nTHE VIDEO SHOW, SERPENTINE GALLERY, LONDON\n\nFirst international video show in Britain organised by Peter Bloch, Sue Grayson, David Hall, Stuart Hood and Clive Scollay featuring installations, performances and single screen works by British artists Roger Barnard, David Hall, Tamara Krikorian, Brian Hoey, Steve Partridge, Stuart Marshall, Alex Meigh, Liz Rhodes, Reindeer Werk, Steve James, Mike Leggett, Peter Livingstone, David Critchley, Tony Sinden and others. After the show a selection of British work toured several UK galleries.\n\n2B BUTLERS WHARF, LONDON\n\nA group of artists, including David Critchley, Kevin Atherton, Alison Winkle and several others, set up a collectively run gallery space presenting video, film and performance work on a regular basis until its closure in 1979.\n\nBRITISH FILM INSTITUTE FUNDING\n\nAfter partially funding the setting up of Fantasy Factory in 1974, the BFI funded video art work for the first time, namely Circling, Teeming and Dawn Creation by Peter Donebauer.\n\n1976\n\nTHE VIDEO SHOW, TATE GALLERY, LONDON\n\nFirst Tate Gallery exhibition of artists video installations.
