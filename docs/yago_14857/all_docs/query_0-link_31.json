Soon she and the family father, Charles, start a passionate secret affair. _IMDb\n\nIMDb User Review:\n\nMinnie Driver, stunning as always (Sep 27, 2000 by s_sjo ): I'm always surprised when I see a movie with Minnie Driver. She's not the best looking actress, or the most skilled but she makes every movie she's a part of worth watching. Even Disney's Tarzan was vitalized by her sparkling voice and energetic acting. This movie places the main character in a very odd position in a house with no love. The dangerous triangle betwixt the governess, the father and the son is very interesting.\n\nI would however like to have more motives and reason for the governess treatment of the son. Also that relation seems not to \"fit\" in the movie and should have been given more time to grow. The photography is beautiful and the nice singing of late Ophra Haza adds value to the movie. It has been a while since I last was left so puzzled and thoughtful after a movie. See this movie with a dear friend.

I have uploaded each movie for posterity, with the hope that all present and future generations will learn from and enjoy them, as much as I have. I own zero rights to this film, nor to any other I have uploaded, and I receive nothing for the uploads nor for the information I put with those uploads. I do receive a huge amount of joy in sharing with you, these many 100s of free-to-you items I have uploaded, however, I have no wish to infringe on any existing copyright laws. DEF.gp ddh **\n\nThe following statement is written from my heart ... these are my words and not to be in any way, considered a form letter from archive.org, as the two cents' worth comes from this volunteer, IA member-user-uploader. Thank you in advance for keeping in mind, my thought process. :) (ed note from Doreen.)\n\n* Although it's quite true that all uploaded material found at archive.org is free for you to watch or download, the space needed to store it, is not. As you can well imagine, IA grows in leaps and bounds each and every day, the daily cost to keep this wonderful address we so much enjoy, running at proper capacity, is tremendous. This fact is the one and ONLY reason a yearly fundraiser is necessary .... to raise extra dollars to keep this free-for-viewing/downloading and available for today's generations as well as for all future generations!"
