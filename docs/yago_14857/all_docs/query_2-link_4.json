        "text": "Sandra Goldbacher Goes Back, Moves Forward with \"The\n\nGoverness\"\n\nby Anthony Kaufman\n\nA period piece with a flare for the modern, Sandra Goldbacher’s\n\nimpressively photographed “The Governess” is an ambitious first effort.\n\nRiding on the recent wave of new British films to come to the U.S.,\n\nGoldbacher’s filmmaking history is not unlike her fellow compatriots.\n\nShe went to film school, went through a “usual period of struggling,”\n\nthen went on to direct both documentaries, commercials and two short\n\nfilms for British television, “17” (for Channel 4 and British Screen),\n\nand “Picadilly Circus by Night” (for the British Film Institute). But\n\nit was her original, feature length screenplay, “The Governess,” that\n\nset her apart from the pack.\n\nDeveloped from a fictional diary which Goldbacher wrote, “The Governess”\n\nfollows the internal and external life of Rosina Da Silva, a 19th\n\nCentury Sephardic Jew, living in London in the 1940’s. When her father\n\ndies in a murderous accident, the once wealthy family learns they are in\n\ndebt. To support herself, the headstrong Rosina ventures out from the\n\nsheltered haven of her thriving Jewish community and journeys to an\n\nisolated Scottish Isle in the guise of a Protestant governess named Mary\n\nBlackchurch. There she finds not just money to send home, but a burning\n\ndesire for the man of the house, Charles Cavendish (Tom Wilkinson), his\n\nearly experiments with photography, and the family and culture she left\n\nbehind.\n\nWith the success of her previous work, Goldbacher was able to get Sarah\n\nCurtis on board as a producer and British Screen to help finance the\n\nfilm. Curtis most recently produced the Judi Dench Oscar-nominee “Mrs.\n\nBrown” and helped Goldbacher bring in other financiers like France’s\n\nPandora Cinema and Sony Pictures Classics which came on before\n\nshooting. Another notable member of the production team is Executive\n\nProducer, Sally Hibbin, a founding member of Parallax Pictures (the\n\nfilmmaking cooperative which includes such leading British directors as\n\nKen Loach and Les Blair.)\n\nBut perhaps the biggest financial boost came not from a production\n\ncompany, but from cover girl “Good Will Hunting” starer, Minnie Driver,\n\nwho accepted the part of Rosina early on in the film’s evolution. “It\n\nwas absolutely crucial that Rosina be played by someone with charisma\n\nand the maturity to hold the film,” says producer Curtis, “someone\n\nfiercely independent and an original. Minnie has that combination of\n\nqualities. She’s a very strong personality, a real screen presence, and\n\na brave actress unafraid to tackle big, difficult things.” Driver was\n\nGoldbacher’s first choice for the role, “She was the only one I\n\napproached with it,” she says. One of the reasons Goldbacher wanted\n\nDriver for the lead was, “There’s a real modernity about her.” She adds,\n\n“But an ability to be vulnerable and lay herself open completely, which\n\nis what I really wanted.”\n\nGoldbacher’s transition from shorts and documentary work to features\n\n“felt quite natural to me,” the writer-director notes. “Making\n\ndocumentaries you’re always getting a performance out of people,” she\n\nsays. “With a documentary, you’re constructing things more, you have to\n\ncajole people.” In contrast, her relationship with actors on her\n\nfeature film felt less strained. And the large crews she worked with\n\nfor commercials prepared her for the extensive feature film staff\n\nbacking her on “The Governess.” At first meeting, Goldbacher is petite,\n\nsoft spoken, (so soft-spoken my tape recorder barely picked up her\n\nvoice) and hardly the hearty helmer one thinks of to pull off an\n\nelaborate period film such as “The Governess.” But Goldbacher contends\n\nthe poetic visuals and lavish settings have “always been my style.”\n\nSpeaking about the ornate scenes which introduce the viewer to the\n\nsubterranean world of the wealthy Sephardic Londoners, she says, “I\n\nwanted that particular section to have as much saturated colors, and to\n\ngive her background in the Jewish community a sense of warmth.” This\n\nwas to counter “the gentile world as Rosina sees it,” when she travels\n\nto Scotland, “which is harsh and cold, bleak and disturbing. Hopefully\n\nall the visuals have emotional connections,” Goldbacher adds.\n\nAlthough Goldbacher says she “grew up loving 19th Century novels,” she\n\nwanted a period film with a modern touch. Citing Jane Campion’s “The\n\nPiano” as inspiration, she and her crew worked hard to set the visuals\n\nand mood apart from the standard costume dramas that audiences are used\n\nto. Ashley Crowe, the D.P., used the film’s thematic metaphor of\n\nphotographic discovery to help shape the look of the film. “Early\n\nphotographs were all taken with soft, natural daylight, so I’ve tried to\n\nsimulate that kind of look and keep true to that style.\n\nPhotographically, this film had so much to offer. The light on the Isle\n\nof Arran was spectacular.” Crowe continues, “In Cavendish’s workroom,\n\nI’ve tried to simulate the soft, North light early photographers got\n\nwith the skylight. A lot of the key interiors are scenes at night, so\n\nwe used a lot of candlelight.” Goldbacher also notes the use of a\n\ncertain architectural lense called a swing shift lense which functions\n\nlike a bellows to throw off the angle of light. Production Designer,\n\nSarah Greenwood sums up, “We wanted it to look like life as it would\n\nhave been, a reality that’s believable. I think sometimes we have a\n\nsanitized vision of what a period looks like, very quaint, very pretty.\n\nThis is not conventional period material where you do a thousand and one\n\ndrawing rooms."
