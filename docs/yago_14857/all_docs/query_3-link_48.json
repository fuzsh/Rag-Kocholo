Hailed as one of the most prestigious film festivals held in the United Kingdom, the London Short Film Festival is the place to find all the best that local and international short film has to offer.\n\nThe London Short Film Festival, also known as the LSFF, screens a wide variety of movies that include drama, documentary, comedy, animation, experimental films and low-budget shorts. The festival aims to support short films by providing an opportunity for filmmakers to get their films seen by a wide audience.\n\nBeing one of the most popular short film festivals in the United Kingdom, the LSFF receives over 2,500 film submissions from the UK and other parts of the world. Of these, it selects around 500 films to be screened each year.\n\nThe London Short Film Festival screens films in the following venues: the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA), Curzon Soho, BFI Southbank, Rich Mix, Regent St. Cinema, Dalston’s historic Rio and Hackney’s MOTH Club.\n\nSome 94 percent of the festival’s events are sold to capacity, with 10,000 tickets reportedly being sold each year. This year, the London Short Film Festival saw one of its most diverse ever demographics in attendance. Attendees were 58 percent female, 20 percent BAME (Black, Asian, and minority ethnic), 23 percent LGBTQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer), and 6 percent Disabled.\n\nThe London Short Film Festival is acknowledged by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) as a qualifying festival for its short film awards.
