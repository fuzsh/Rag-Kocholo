Bottom-drawer plot of a South Boston bad boy returning to tie up loose ends reads like every other \"Mean Streets\" knockoff in the past decade, with no scene, development or performance standing out from undifferentiated din. With the low-budget gangster genre seemingly played out for the moment, this will be a hard sell in any market. Pic reps helming debut for vet thesp John Shea, who wrote \"Southie\" with two others. The \"Lois & Clark\" regular has some facility with the camera, and good rapport with the cast, but nothing sticks to this refried story, which resembles \"Little Odessa,\" \"No Looking Back\" and numerous other \"why'd ya hafta come back here?\" dramas.\n\n....\n\nRose McGowan, Steve Koslowski and real-life bro Robert Wahlberg try to carve out some space as various Quinn siblings, along with Shea as an understandably anxious cop cousin, but the family dynamics are often laughable, especially when Danny finds sis drunk (again) and offers to buy her a six-pack on the way to detox.\n\n© Variety\n\nExcerpt from New York Times 8/24/98: John Shea\n\nThis Week\n\nBy JESSE McKINLEY Published: August 24, 1998\n\nMONTREAL -- Cannes may have the stars and New York the prestige, but for sheer international variety, the Montreal World Film Festival tops them both. More than 400 films from 60 countries will be presented, beginning on Thursday with Robert Lepage's ''No.'' Notable entries include the Israeli director Shimon Dotan's ''You Can Thank Me Later,'' starring Ellen Burstyn, and ''Southie,'' directed by John Shea, as well as a tribute to the Swedish director Ingmar Bergman.\n\n© New York Times\n\nExcerpt from Backstage 9/25/98: John Shea\n\nFESTIVALS: Auteurs Gather in Montreal & NYC - NY Indie Moviemakers Say \"Oh La La\" at 1998 Montreal World Film Festival\n\nBy Scott & Barbara Siegel Publication: BackStage Date: Friday, September 25 1998\n\nThe next day, in a reflective mood, Shea sat down to talk across a table about the road that brought him to Montreal as a film director. \"I started as a director,\" he revealed. \"I have a masters in directing from Yale. After I graduated I was an apprentice director in New York assisting Hal Prince and Joe Papp for several years. I worked with John Guare and Arthur Kopit in the theater. By chance I got the male lead in a play that went to Broadway, a play called 'Yentl.' It played for a year, I got awards, I fell in love with acting , and I've been acting ever since. But there was some part of me that was unexpressed and that was the directing side that I had started on. \"About eight years ago my kid brother died in India, quickly and tragically,\" Shea said soberly. \"It woke me up in a shattering way that if I wanted to do things in this life I had to do them now and not procrastinate.\" The actor started writing, finished a script and set about to mount it for the screen when he came across the script by David McLaughlin and Jimmy Cummings that would become \"Southie.\"\n\nShea eventually restructured and rewrote the film and agreed to direct it, instead, as his first feature. From his experience, he learned what he called \"The Golden Rule of Independent Filmmaking,\" which is: \"If you write a good script, then you can get good actors. If you get good actors, then you can get your money.\" In Shea's case, it took at least a dozen more scripts to get it right, \"but then I could send it to Anne Meara and Rose McGowan (both of whom co-star), and feel confident that they would respond to it the way I did. When people send me scripts, I don't say what's the deal? I say, 'Let me read the script.' \"\n\nThe film's male lead, the actor who carries the movie like he carries his fictional family on his shoulders, was the central casting question. Shea originally went after Mark Wahlberg \"but his manager wanted more money than we had in our entire budget,\" said Shea. \"Then the phone rings and it's Donnie Wahlberg from New Kids on the Block.\"\n\nShea recounted their first meeting. \"Wahlberg said straight out, 'I'm born to play this part. Forget about my brother. I saw the script lying around in his house in Hollywood. Forget about him. I'm the one who's clean and sober, I'm the one who takes care of my family, I'm the one who's going to play this part.' \" And Donnie was right.\n\n© Backstage\n\nExcerpt from Variety 9/29/98: John Shea\n\nLandis’ ‘Plan’ preems at AFI fest\n\nSeptember 29, 1998 | 12:00AM PT Leonard Klady\n\nAFI Fest ’98, running Oct. 22-31, will be top heavy with world and U.S. premieres including new films by John Landis and Claude Chabrol and such acclaimed international titles as France’s “Dream Life of Angels,” “The Apple” from Iran and Spain’s antic comedy “Airbag.”\n\n....\n\nNew Directions U.S. includes “Southie,” a crime drama directed by John Shea that received top honors at the Seattle fest.\n\n© Variety\n\nExcerpt from Internationales Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg 10/9/98: John Shea\n\n47.

At the WGA Theater in Los Angeles over 1,300 people showed up for a 500 seat theater forcing the IFP/West to immediately schedule another screening afterwards (a first ever for the \"New Visions\" screenings).

You’re Irish, a nation of storytellers. Tell your own stories.\" And so was born Shea’s first feature, \"Southie,\" set in Boston’s Irish South end, which he not only co-wrote and directed, but which went on to win the Best Independent Film at last year’s Seattle Film Festival.\n\n....\n\nFinally, for this accomplished screen star, one must ask, why the return to theater? In a nutshell, his life underwent major transformations in the run up to the new millennium, including a divorce after 30 years of marriage, choosing to leave his agents at William Morris, and a long pressurized three years getting \"Southie\" on the screen.\n\n© Irish Echo\n\nNew England Film 4/1/99: John Shea\n\nJohn Shea Goes Hollywood, Again\n\nSouth Boston is a perennial favorite on local newscasts, garnering publicity for anything from its many redevelopment proposals--casinos, football stadiums, convention centers--to its sometimes-controversial St. Patrick's Day parade. Lately, though, just as much attention has come from Hollywood, with last year's award-winning \"Good Will Hunting,\" and now the aptly named \"Southie.\" Director John Shea's look at Boston's working-class Irish neighborhood focuses on a young man, Danny (rising star Donnie Wahlberg), who returns home for a friend's wedding. While Danny sees that little has changed in his three-year absence, he is in for a surprise if he thinks he can escape his past. Shea, who wrote and directed \"Southie,\" is no stranger to New England himself. Having grown up in Springfield, MA, he attended Bates College in Maine and Yale University School of Drama. He spoke with me about the film, which marks his directorial debut.\n\nEA: Why Southie? With other recent films set in Boston (\"Good Will Hunting\" and \"Monument Ave.\"), what makes the film so special?\n\nSHEA: Unlike those other films you mentioned, \"Southie\" is the only picture that was filmed and actually takes place entirely in South Boston. \"Good Will Hunting\" was mostly shot on location in Toronto, while \"Monument Ave.\" is about Charlestown. We also began shooting before those other pictures. Therefore, when we began shooting in the winter of '97, we were really exploring virgin territory.\n\nEA: How did the idea for the film begin?\n\nSHEA: I had originally written a screenplay where I had been set to star and direct. Then I came across Jimmy Cummings' script (Cummings plays Donnie's rival, Joey Ward) and fell in love with it. Unlike most screenplays coming out of Hollywood, Jimmy's read from the inside out. It was so genuine and real.\n\nEA: Is the screenplay based on actual events?\n\nSHEA: Jimmy grew up on Minton Street in Southie, so a lot of it was based on actual experiences.\n\nEA: How much was authenticity a concern for you?\n\nSHEA: As a director, I was influenced by the Italian [and Italian-American] neorealists, guys like De Sica, Cassavetes, Antonioni, and Scorsese. It was Scorsese, in fact, who strongly encouraged me to direct. He said there should be more Irish directors, and other than Ed Burns (\"Brothers McMullen,\" \"She's the One\"), there really aren't that many. What made this film so perfect is that almost everyone in the cast is from the area. Out of 45 speaking parts, only seven were performed by professional actors. Jimmy, as I mentioned, is from Southie; Donnie grew up in Dorchester and still has family there. Only Rose McGowan (Kathy) is from Hollywood.\n\nEA: So getting the accent down was not a problem then for the actors? I understand you played Robert Kennedy once...\n\nSHEA: Yes, the Boston accent is one of the hardest in the world to get right. When I made \"Kennedy,\" Martin Sheen and I took six months just trying to get it to sound right. With \"Southie,\" we didn't have to worry about it--the casting was perfect. When you see barbers, they are real barbers. When you see ambulance drivers, they are real ambulance drivers, et cetera, et cetera. Nothing could have been better.\n\nEA: Tell us about the music. Was it also genuine?\n\nSHEA: Yes. In fact, a fellow from the Southie projects wrote the song played over the closing credits. Bo Cleary, who appears in the movie as a bodyguard for the Irish mob, wrote the song during filming. I played the song for the cast, and everyone loved it. It was recorded by Forever Chosen for the soundtrack album. For the movie, we actually went on location to listen to music being played in bars and bowling alleys. For the wedding scene in the movie, we even watched videotapes from Jimmy Cummings' real weddings just to hear the music being played in the background. As for the score, I worked with first-time composer Wayne Sharpe, who was just phenomenal. We wanted an urban feel, something that included a mix of both new and old. What we came up with was a combination of modern tribal rhythms, drums, and old Celtic Irish music.\n\nEA: What would you like viewers to walk away from \"Southie\" with?\n\nSHEA: I'd like them to know how special Southie really is. There are few places in America like it. The original title for the film was \"The Brass Ring\" because the Irish ring represents love and friendship. One need not be Irish to appreciate these values. I'd like all people, whether they are Japanese, African, Italian, or Korean, to relate. They hopefully will see the importance of what it means to be loyal, to both friends and family.\n\nEA: Thank you for taking the time to talk with us. When can New Englanders expect to see the film?\n\nSHEA: My pleasure. The movie will debut in Boston sometime this spring. I can't wait to show it here!\n\n© New England Film\n\nExcerpt from City of Boston 5/28/99: John Shea\n\n1999 Southie\n\nRelease Date: May 28, 1999\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nDirector: John Shea\n\nStarring: Donnie Wahlberg, Anne Meara, Rose McGowan\n\nProduction Companies: Prophecy Pictures, Ltd.\n\nFeatured Location: South Boston\n\nAwards and Accolades:•Montréal World Film Festival Grand Prix des Amériques Award Nominee (John Shea)\n\n•Seattle International Film Festival American Independent Award Winner (Bill McCutchen, Hugh Wilson, John Shea)\n\n© City of Boston\n\nExcerpt from The Boston Herald 5/28/99: John Shea\n\nThe local Mob; Donnie Wahlberg and crew give somber 'Southie' credibility.\n\nThe Boston Herald | May 28, 1999 | Verniere, James\n\nSome powerful performances give \"Southie\" an electric charge, especially one by leading man Donnie Wahlberg, even if its trendy Middle Eastern score, \"Usual Suspects\" visuals and \"Godfather\"-like dynamics make it seem derivative.\n\n© The Boston Herald\n\nExcerpt from The Boston Herald 6/1/99: John Shea\n\nNative sons have something to prove.\n\nThe Boston Herald | June 1, 1999 | Sherman, Paul\n\nLike Donnie Wahlberg, who plays his first leading role in \"Southie,\" director/co-writer John Shea and writer/actor Jimmy Cummings both had things to prove.\n\n....\n\nShea, 50, the Springfield-born actor (\"Missing,\" TV's \"The Adventures of Lois & Clark\"), was looking to make the transition to writing and directing.\n\n© Boston Herald\n\nExcerpt from New England Film 6/99: John Shea\n\nBehind \"Southie\": Actor Donnie Wahlberg\n\nby Amy Steele\n\nThe script reached actor and Springfield, MA, native John Shea (\"Missing,\" \"Stealing Home,\" and television's \"Lois and Clark\"). Shea and Cummings rewrote the screenplay, and Shea came on board as director. \"Southie\" was the first film to shoot in South Boston (\"Good Will Hunting\" completed production afterward, although it was released earlier). \"It was set in a world that I had never seen done on film before. There was nothing ever set in South Boston,\" Shea explained. \"Thematically I thought I could bring things to it that I had been exploring--particularly this Irish-American tribalism.

Still, there have been some dry periods, not that he didn't put them to good use, returning to writing and directing. \"I was living in L.A. and for six months, there was a creative downturn [translation: he was unemployed as an actor]. What do you do with your energies when you're not acting?\" he asks rhetorically. \"When I started writing I had a reason to get up each day, and for the first time, I was not at the mercy of some producer. Yes, once you start submitting your scripts (or films) you are at the mercy of others, of course. But at least during the writing phase, you're in control of your day-to-day destiny.\"\n\nHe stresses that he doesn't write just to give himself parts, although the kind of scripts he likes to write are also the kind he enjoys acting in. \"Certain themes interest me: love, death, loyalty, betrayal. And I find myself wanting to write about characters who have to run an emotional gauntlet in order to achieve a bitter truth at the end.\"\n\nHis first feature film, \"Southie,\" which he co-wrote and directed, went on to win Best Independent Film at last year's Seattle's Film Festival. Distributed by Lion's Gate, \"Southie\" describes a family reunion, awash in dysfunction, at a wedding in Boston's South End.\n\n© Backstage\n\nExcerpt from Sci-Fi Talk 1/24/02: John Shea\n\nJohn Shea on Sci-Fi Talk\n\nTony Tellado\n\nTony: You know, what I'm noticing too is something that you mentioned, directing.

Most recently he co-wrote, directed and acted in the independent film Southie.\n\n....\n\nShea: But while I was doing Lois and Clark, I wrote a couple screenplays, but in particular Southie, which I ended up directing. I spent the next three years putting Southie together. So I went far away from the world of mainstream television into the world of American independent film, which is a world I had come from. Raising the money, putting it all together, directing the thing, writing 12 drafts of it, casting it, shooting it in south Boston, and spending nine months doing the post-production, editing it, helping produce the soundtrack, and then taking that to the film festivals, obtaining distribution, going to the premiere. I used the money I had made during Lois and Clark to kind of finance that whole experience, because I wasn't paid for anything for Southie during its development. And then I was only paid scale minimum for directing it and acting in it.\n\n© SciFi Weekly\n\nExcerpt from The Epoch Times 2/6/07: John Shea & Times Square 3/22/07\n\nBroadway After Dark: X-Man Returns From LA\n\nBy Ward Morehouse III Feb 06, 2007\n\nJohn has already had success with a movie he directed (and co-wrote), a well-loved indie called \"Southie.\" Shot in 1997, it is set in the tough Irish American neighborhood of South Boston, a world recently revisited by Scorcese in \"The Departed.\" He says, \"We were the first film ever to shoot there, partly because my cowriter Jimmy Cummings grew up there.\" \"Southie\" stars Donnie Wahlberg, Rose McGowan, Amanda Peet, Anne Meara, Will Arnett and Laurence Tierney and won Best Picture at the Seattle International Film Festival.

No, the edgy director didn’t have inside info on the whereabouts of the real Bulger, who was captured last week by the FBI living in the swish seaside community. But Tarantino did know where Shea could find actor Lawrence Tierney. “Quentin rediscovered him in ‘Reservoir Dogs,’ so I talked to (him) and he said you’ll find him on the beach in Santa Monica,” Shea told the Track the other night here at the Nantucket Film Festival. “He said to show up at his door with a bucket full of cash and the script and leave it there.”\n\nSounds all very elusive and crime lord-y, don’t cha think? Shea waited and finally tough guy Tierney, now deceased, rang him up and said he’d love to play Southie crime boss Colie Powers, who tries to strong-arm Donnie Wahlberg’s character back into the Irish mob. “The Bulger family’s fingerprints are all over this film,” said Shea, who wrote the screenplay with local boys Dave McLaughlin and Jimmy Cummings. “Many people don’t know this, but Billy Bulger was actually in the funeral scene as a mourner for Donnie Wahlberg’s mother (played by) Anne Meara.\n\n“He was in the scene until the final cut,” said the filmmaker, who, more recently played Harold Waldorf, Leighton Meester’s dad, on “Gossip Girl.” “Then we thought, wow, (Billy) doesn’t know that Lawrence Tierney is basically playing his brother, and maybe that would be an embarrassment for Billy who we think is a good guy. So we cut him out of the film so he wouldn't be embarrassed.\"\n\n© Boston Herald\n\nBoston.com 8/30/11: John Shea\n\nJohn Shea keeps his friends close\n\n08/31/2011 6:11 PM\n\nJohn Shea, artistic director of the Nantucket Theatre Workshop, is showing some “Southie”-style loyalty to Sue Costello, arranging an island performance of Costello’s solo show “Minus 32 Million Words” before it heads off-Broadway. The Dorchester-bred comic’s cameo in Shea’s 1998 film “Southie” eventually led to her CBS series “Costello.” Recalls Shea: “She deviated so wildly from the script, much better than anything I could have come up with.”\n\n© Boston.com\n\nExcerpt from The Inquirer and Mirror 3/15/12: John Shea\n\nCelebrating Irish Culture: \"Commitments\" and \"Southie\" at Starlight on Sunday\n\nBy Lindsay Pykosz and Marianne Stanton March 15, 2012\n\nJohn Shea, Theatre Workshop of Nantucket’s artistic director, said that living here year-round brought him to the realization that there’s simply not that much to do in the winter. In an effort to remedy the situation, while at the same time providing something culturally different for Nantucketers, he has combined his appreciation for Irish heritage with his love of film and theater to bring a double bill of Irish-themed movies to the Starlight Theater this St. Patrick’s Day weekend in conjunction with TWN: “Southie,” which he co-wrote and directed in the late 1990s, and Alan Parker’s “The Commitments,” produced by summer resident, film producer, director, screenwriter and a friend of Shea’s, Armyan Bernstein. Shea’s film, which premiered on the East Coast during the second Nantucket Film Festival, was the first film shot entirely in the Irish neighborhood of South Boston.\n\n© Inquirer and Mirror"
