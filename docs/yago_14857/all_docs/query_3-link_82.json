        "text": "In honour of Christian Marclay’s remix masterpiece The Clock, we’re digging through a selection of mash-up works and artists to view online and in gallery.\n\nSeen Homer Simpson back into Obama’s presidential portrait? Chuckled at the Red vs Blue machinima? Or enjoyed DJ Danger Mouse’s The Grey Album?\n\nThey’re just recent examples of remix culture, an artistic tradition that encompasses everything from hip hop and installation to moving image and memes, recontextualising and repurposing existing objects, music and art. Think how Marcel Duchamp’s readymade Fountain challenged what could be in a gallery, how DJ Kool Herc’s turntablism created fresh expression from remixed music, or how Christian Marclay questions time through film and TV in The Clock.\n\nThough much of remix culture, like fan-made supercuts, can be interpreted firstly as entertainment, moving image remixes have long challenged political, corporate and social power structures. In 1941, Charles A. Ridley ridiculed the proposed might of the Third Reich by remixing footage of Nazis dancing to “Lambeth Walk”, while René Viénet mocked Mao by splicing together Chinese propaganda and kung fu movies.\n\nIn the 1970s, Kandy Fong pioneered vidding by synching a Star Trek slide-show with music from a cassette player, and Dara Birnbaum’s influential Technology/Transformation: Wonder Woman helped reinforce pop culture appropriation as an artistic resource and avenue for feminist critique and resistance.\n\nWhen VCR technology became available a decade later, moving image remixing was even more accessible, allowing culture jammers and Scratch Video artists like Sandra Goldbacher and Kim Flitcroft to question conservatism and mass-media by recutting TV, music videos and found footage into unstable mash-ups (a style which the advertising industry ironically recuperated).\n\nWhile the Gulf War waged nightly on TVs during the 90s, collectives like EBN and Negativland cut-up evening news broadcasts and music to question how the media turned war into entertainment, continuing Ridley and Vienet’s subversive tradition and foreshadowing the rampant politicisation of appropriation, on both the left and the right, that exists online today.\n\nThanks to the Internet, remixes and mash-ups are everywhere, easily created and disseminated as memes, GIFs, fan edits, supercuts, machinima and countless other forms that are central to contemporary culture and now constitute an archetypal aesthetic of the internet. Kids create them, Presidents share them and museums like us present them.\n\nSo, for everyone who wants to see more mash-ups like The Clock, here are some of our favs, online and in galleries.\n\nTERROR NULLIUS (2018)\n\nOkay, so we’re a little biased, but Soda_Jerk’s TERROR NULLIUS recontextualises iconic Australian moments from film, TV and news broadcasts, taking aim at white Australia, our refugee policy, Indigenous genocide, misogyny and ecological ambivalence."
