        "text": "Sandra Goldbacher (Writer/Director) makes her feature film debut with \"The Governess.\" Goldbacher's previous work has included the award-winning short films \"17\" (Channel 4 and British Screen) and \"Piccadilly Circus by Night\" (BFI), as well as many arts documentaries for the BBC. This work brought her to the attention of producer Sarah Curtis. With the support of British Screen and suggestions from Curtis, Goldbacher developed the diary she'd been writing from the point of view of the character Rosina into a screenplay which drew almost immediate commitments to the project from Pandora Cinema in France and actress Minnie Driver.\n\nSarah Curtis' (Producer) films include \"Les Blair's Bad Behavior,\" Christopher Monger's \"The Englishman Who Went Up A Hill But Came Down A Mountain,\" and, most recently, the internationally acclaimed \"Mrs. Brown,\" starring Judi Dench as Queen Victoria, which has brought her several major critics' prizes, a Golden Globe Award and Academy Award nomination as Best Actress. \"'The Governess' took two years from the outline to shooting, which is a personal record I'm quite proud of\", Curtis notes.\n\nSally Hibbin (Executive Producer), a founding member of Parallax Pictures, began her career as a journalist before becoming a documentary filmmaker and moving into television drama and feature films. To date her credits include the TV production of \"A Very British Coup,\" Ken Loach's award-winning films \"Riff Raff,\" \"Raining Stones,\" \"Ladybird, Ladybird\" and \"Carla's Song,\" and actor-turned-director Philip Davis' award-winning debut feature \"i-d.\"\n\nParallax Pictures is a cooperative of producers and directors who share the principle of a democratic working place and are committed to developing their ideas on a collaborative basis. In addition to Hibbin and Curtis, Parallax associates are Ken Loach, Rebecca O'Brien, Les Blair, Philip Davis and Emma Burge. Parallax is committed to encouraging new talent, with an open door policy for young writers, directors and producers. Since it was founded in 1991, Parallax has established itself as one of the most provocative filmmaking forces in British Cinema.\n\nAshley Rowe (director of photography) is considered one of the most talented rising young British cinematographers. Rowe's debut theatrical feature film was \"Second Best,\" starring William Hurt, for director Chris Menges (himself an Academy Award-winning cinematographer). Other film credits include \"Widow's Peak,\" \"Sister, My Sister,\" \"A Man Of No Importance,\" Phil Agland's adaptation of Thomas Hardy's \"The Woodlanders,\" and two forthcoming British productions, Michael Radford's \"B-Monkey\" and Shane Meadows' \"TwentyFourSeven.\"\n\nSarah Greenwood (Production Designer)made her theatrical feature film debut last year with Bob Bierman's adaptation of George Orwell's \"Keep The Aspidistra Flying,\" starring Richard E. Grant and Helena Bonham Carter and set in 1930s London. Her extensive television work includes comedy, documentary and factual programs (\"Later with Jools Holland,\" \"The Bore of the Year Awards\"), and opera (\"Kings of Hearts\"), as well as drama. Her credits include \"Black Daisies For The Bride\" (winner of the Prix Italia 1993), \"After Miss Julie,\" the two part adaptation of Wilkie Collins' classic mystery \"The Moonstone,\" and the three-part serial of Anne Bronte's \"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall,\" for which Greenwood received a BAFTA nomination and the RTS Award for Production Design.\n\nCaroline Harris (Costume Designer) has created the wardrobe for half a dozen feature films, including the Golden Lion winner at the 1994 Venice Film Festival, Milcho Manchevski's internationally acclaimed \"Before The Rain.\" Her other credits include Kenneth Branagh's \"A Midwinter's Tale,\" Oliver Parker's film version of \"Othello\" starring Laurence Fishburne and Kenneth Branagh, Beeban Kidron's \"Swept From The Sea\" and Mike Hodges' \"The Croupier.\" Harris has worked on numerous musical promos for artists including Pink Floyd, The Charlatans and Morrisey. Her television credits include the BBC's 18th Century Scottish drama \"Deacon Brodie,\" \"Looking For Love\" and the short \"Hello Hello Hello,\" directed by actor David Thewlis.\n\nIsabel Lorente (Editor) began her career in France but has achieved an international reputation, having worked for producers and directors including Ismail Merchant and James Ivory, Francis Ford Coppola and Agnieszka Holland, and Agnes Varda. Her early film credits, as an assistant editor include Varda's \"Jane B. Par Agnes V.\" and \"Kung Fu Master,\" Holland's \"To Kill A Priest,\" and Nicholas Gessner's \"Tennessee Waltz.\" Lorente has edited several European television productions, and her recent film credits include editing Holland's award-winning \"Europa Europa,\" \"Olivier, Olivier,\" \"Total Eclipse\" and \"The Secret Garden,\" Merchant Ivory's \"Jefferson In Paris,\" and Sean Mathias's screen adaptation of \"Bent.\"\n\nEdward Shearmur (Composer) spent seven years as composer Michael Kamen's apprentice and assistant, contributing to many of Kamen's scores. As a keyboard player, Shearmur has performed with Annie Lennox, Dave Stewart, Pink Floyd, Marianne Faithful and Bryan Adams. Shearmur made his debut as film composer with his score for \"The Cement Garden.\" Since then he co-wrote with Kamen the score for Peter Medak's \"Let Him Have It,\" and with Stanley Myers he co-wrote the music for Nicholas Roeg's \"Heart Of Darkness.\" His own recent scores include \"The Hunchback,\" \"The Demon Knight,\" \"The Leading Man,\" \"Remember Me,\" and, upcoming \"Girls Night,\" \"Martha Meets Frank,\" \"Daniel and Lawrence\" and \"Species II,\" his first major Hollywood commission. His music for \"The Wings Of The Dove\" was one of last year's most widely praised film scores.\n\nCopyright Â©1998. All Rights Reserved.\n\nPlease mail us with any questions or comments."
