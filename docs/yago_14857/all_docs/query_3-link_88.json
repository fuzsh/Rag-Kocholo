The Producers Films has produced the BAFTA award winning three part serial The Politician’s Wife written by Paula Milne and starring Juliet Stevenson and Trevor Eve. They made Seeing Red, a single film for ITV, starring Sarah Lancashire. Adapted by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais from a book by Coral Atkins, Seeing Red was also nominated for a BAFTA. Their two hour drama Belonging, for ITV, an adaptation by Alan Plater of Stevie Davies’ book The Web of Belonging was directed by Christopher Menaul. It starred Brenda Blethyn who was nominated for a BAFTA for her performance. The Producers currently have an extensive film and television slate. As always their slate is diverse – working with both up and coming talent and people with whom they have had long-standing professional relationships. Their projects currently include The Poisoners, a film which is to be directed by Jon Amiel and will star, among others, Emily Watson and Anna Friel. They are also working on a film adapted and to be directed by Sandra Goldbacher entitled The Beloved; development has been supported by the European MEDIA Fund and the UK Film Council. They are also working on a hilarious new romantic comedy written, and to be directed by the talented Jonathan Lynn called The Pre-Nup. Jeanna has co-produced with Italian company Cattleya and America’s Franchise Productions on productions including Don’t Move starring Penelope Cruz and Laws of Attraction starring Julianne Moore.\n\nWebsite\n\nhttp://www.theproducersfilms.co.uk\n\nExternal link for The Producers Films\n\nIndustry\n\nMedia Production\n\nCompany size\n\n11-50 employees\n\nType\n\nPrivately Held\n\nSpecialties\n\nFilm Production and Television Production"
