Driver sang an original song “Learn to be Lonely,” written for the film by Lloyd Webber. However, due to her lack of experience in opera, all her songs as Carlotta were dubbed by opera singer Magaret Preece. Driver released her second album, Seastories, in July 2007, featuring guest appearances by Ryan Adams, the Cardinals and Liz Phair. Driver released a third album in October 2014 called, Ask Me To Dance that includes songs by Elliott Smith, Neil Young and the The Killers."
