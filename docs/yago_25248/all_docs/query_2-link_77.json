        "text": "Golden Globe-winning actress Barbara Rush has died. She was 97 years old.\n\nRush’s passing was confirmed by her daughter, Fox News correspondent Claudia Cowan, on Sunday (March 31).\n\n“My wonderful mother passed away peacefully at 5:28 this evening,” she said in a statement to Fox News. “I was with her this morning and know she was waiting for me to return home safely to transition.”\n\nHer statement continued, “It’s fitting she chose to leave on Easter as it was one of her favorite holidays and now, of course, Easter will have a deeper significance for me and my family.”\n\nRush rose to fame after starring in the 1953 film It Came From Outer Space, for which she received a Golden Globe for most promising female newcomer. She is best known for her work in Robin and the 7 Hoods, Hombre, and When Worlds Collide.\n\nHer career began in 1950 when she made her on-screen debut in The Goldbergs at the age of 23. She secured her first role as a series regular in Peyton Place, which she appeared on from 1967 to 1969. But her career in television would continue on for decades, with appearances in Magnum, P.I., Murder She Wrote and All My Children.\n\nShe starred opposite some of the biggest names in Hollywood throughout her career, including Paul Newman in The Young Philadelphians, and later Marlon Brando and Dean Martin in The Young Lions.\n\nOne of the final acting roles of her career was as Grandma Ruth Camden in the WB series 7th Heaven, in which she made regular appearances from 1997 to 2007.\n\nThe actress was born in Denver, Colorado, in 1927. She got her start in acting while studying at University of California, Santa Barbara, where she began performing at the Pasadena Playhouse.\n\nThe Hollywood starlet was first married to actor Jeffrey Hunter, with whom she shares a son, and later publicist Warren Cowan.\n\nRush is survived by her two children."
