His optimism and wit never faded.\n\nBorn in Maynard, Mass., Jeff was the son of Otis Hunter and Eleanor (Bright) Hunter.\n\nHe received his BS from the College of the Holy Cross, his MBA from Western New England College, and his DBA from Golden Gate University. An educator for more than 35 years, Jeff spent the majority of his career as a faculty member in the business studies department at Assumption College; he also taught at Merrimac College, Nichols College, and the College of the Holy Cross.\n\nJeff ran a highly successful career counseling firm and, in the mid-1980s, was named special economic advisor to Abkhasia consulting on privatization practices and business development in the former Soviet Union.\n\nJeff was an avid and accomplished sailor. He also was a talented musician, playing the tuba with several university and community bands for more than 50 years. With a deep sense of service to others, Jeff volunteered at numerous organizations throughout his life, most recently at Catholic Charities, the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth, and Families (as a foster parent), the Salvation Army and the Genesis Center.\n\nJeff is lovingly remembered by his wife Wendy Samter; his daughters Lisa Hunter-Mason with her husband John Mason, and Laura Hunter with her husband David Yarter, both of Sturbridge, Mass.; his grandchildren, Ashley, Meredith, Ethan, Nicholas, Alex, and Benjamin; his siblings David Hunter with his wife Pamela of Providence, R.I., Judith Linquata with her husband Louis of Gloucester, Mass., Laurie Kelly with her husband Michael of Fernandina Beach, Fla., James Hunter with his wife Jean of Lovell, Maine and Chappaquiddick, Mass., and Gregory Hunter with his wife Lynn of Sudbury, Mass.; along with numerous nieces, nephews and extended family.\n\nJeff’s family would like to extend its deepest gratitude to the doctors, nurses and staff of the oncology and hematology department at Tufts Medical Center in Boston.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Tufts Medical Center Prostate Cancer Research Fund, Tufts Medical Center, 800 Washington St., #231, Boston, MA 02111.\n\nA celebration of Jeff’s life will be conducted at 11:30 a.m. Saturday, Feb. 2, 2019 at Central Baptist Church, 99 Narragansett Ave., Jamestown, R.I. After the ceremony, friends and family are invited to a luncheon at the Conanicut Yacht Club, 40 Bay View Drive, Jamestown."
