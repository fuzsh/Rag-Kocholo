        "text": "AUGUSTA – Jeffrey Hunter Uecker passed away at MaineGeneral Hospital on Oct. 27, 2023. He was 73 years old.\n\nJeff was born in Philadelphia, Pa. to Margaret “Peggy” Hunter and Walter Uecker. He was an avid soccer player growing up, competing in college and coaching and refereeing through adulthood. Jeff was a lifelong learner with a compassionate personality. After graduating with a degree in Chemistry, he worked at various jobs, but had a passion for sharing his knowledge with others and which led him to live and teach in Ghana for two years through the Peace Corps, various US cities, and eventually the Navajo Nation where he met and married Anne Cantalupo in 1987.\n\nHe and Anne moved to Tucson, Ariz. to complete their advanced education at the University of Arizona. They would ultimately move their family to Oakland, Maine in 2000 where he taught at Waterville High School. By the end of his teaching career in 2016, he had taught thousands of kids and young adults.\n\nJeff’s family was the center of his world, and he the rock of theirs. He will be remembered as a devoted husband to Anne and dedicated father to Kirstin Gelmi of Columbus, Ohio, and Steph Frey of Milford, NJ, their husbands Aden and Kyle, and his golden retriever Bayleigh. He impressed upon them a love for the outdoors, the value of a home-cooked meal, and the importance of kindness and a well-intentioned sense of humor. He was a proud “Pop Pop” to his grandchildren Eva, 5, Reagan, 4, and Theo, 1.\n\nJeff was surpassed in death by his parents and brothers, Michael and Charles “Chip”. He is survived by his sister, Jennifer Lynn Martin of St. Augustine, Fla., as well as several nieces and nephews.\n\nFuneral services will be private for immediate family.\n\nArrangements are under the care and direction of Veilleux and Redington Funeral Home.\n\nFor those who wish to\n\nhonor his life, please consider donating to the Michael J. Fox Foundation"
