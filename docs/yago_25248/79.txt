BARBARA RUSH was 90 on 4th January,2017.

I first remember seeing Barbara as Jane Wyman’s step-daughter in MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION and being impressed by her performance .

One of Barbara’s first films was PRINCE OF THIEVES, with John Derek.

Possibly best known for IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE(1953), Barbara worked steadily in films and television from the 1950s to the 1990s. And was also a stage performer.

Married to Jeffrey Hunter from 1950 to 1955, she worked at a Universal, Fox and Paramount and costarred twice with Rock Hudson in TAZA,SON OF COCHISE (1954) and CAPTAIN LIGHTFOOT (1955).

FLAMING FEATHER (1952) with Sterling Hayden.

Barbara played James Mason’s wife in the drama BIGGER THAN LIFE (1956).

A rare title I have never seen is WORLD IN HIS CORNER (1956), in which Barbara costarred with Audie Murphy.

Barbara costarred twice with FRANK SINATRA, in COME BLOW YOUR HORN (1963) and ROBIN AND THE SEVEN HOODS (1964) – in which she played ‘Marian’.

Barbara attended the 2012 TCM Festival.
