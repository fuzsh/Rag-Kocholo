        "text": "Baby M – the girl who sparked a national debate over surrogate motherhood – turns 13 on Saturday.\n\nBy all accounts, she is a friendly, happy girl, unaffected by her early fame and the continuing tension between her birth mother and the natural father and adoptive mother she lives with.\n\nShe is a math whiz, an athlete and a gifted musician.\n\n“She’s a lovely girl, a beautiful girl,” a neighbor said.\n\n“She’s bright – like me,” said her grandfather – on her birth mother’s side.\n\nBaby M’s real name is Melissa Stern, and she lives in Tenafly, N.J., with Bill and Betsy Stern, the couple who won a nasty and fascinating custody fight in 1987.\n\nThe Sterns are fiercely protective of their only child’s privacy, threatening to sue anyone who publishes current photographs of her.\n\nThey have also threatened to sue Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould, Melissa’s birth mother, if she talks publicly about her daughter or releases any photos of her.\n\nGould still refuses to call the girl Melissa, the name the Sterns gave her, calling her Sassy instead.\n\nChildren who attend Tenafly Middle School with Melissa know she was famous once.\n\n“She’s Baby M,” a fellow seventh-grader said. “Her mom didn’t want to give her up, and there was a big trial.”\n\nIndeed there was.\n\nIn March 1984, Gould – then married to sanitation worker Richard Whitehead – answered an ad in a local newspaper looking for surrogate mothers.\n\nOn Feb. 6, 1985, Gould – already the mother of two school-age children – agreed to be artificially inseminated by Bill Stern and relinquish all rights to their child in return for $10,000.\n\nStern’s wife suffers from multiple sclerosis and feared a pregnancy would make the disease worse.\n\nOn Mar. 27, 1986, when 28-year-old Whitehead saw her newborn baby and realized she looked like her other children, she decided she wasn’t going to give the baby away.\n\nSo after nursing the infant for two weeks, Gould informed the Sterns they weren’t getting her.\n\nThey sued.\n\nOn May 5, cops arrived at Whitehead’s house in Brick Township with an order granting the Sterns temporary custody. She passed the baby through a window to her husband and the couple fled to Florida.\n\nIn July a private detective forced Whitehead to hand the baby over to the Sterns, and the trial began soon after.\n\nThe Sterns called the baby Melissa. Whitehead called her Sara. The courts called her Baby M.\n\nIt was a battle that brought into sharp focus the stunning new powers of medicine and the ethical and moral tangles that can result.\n\nEventually, the New Jersey Supreme Court gave the Sterns custody but granted the birth mother – who by then had divorced Whitehead and married Dean Gould – extensive visitation rights.\n\nAnd that is pretty much where it has remained, as the baby became a girl and now a teenager.\n\nThe Sterns still live in the same modest, white, three-bedroom colonial on a tree-lined block on a hill in Tenafly.\n\nOn a recent day, the lawn was covered with snow, and two plastic sleds were leaning against the house near a side door.\n\nMelissa has played softball in the Tenafly girls’ league for at least two years.\n\nShe broke her arm early this school year and had to miss gym class, friends said, although none knew how the break occurred.\n\nShe is taking algebra, the most advanced math class offered to seventh-graders.\n\nShe wears her hair at shoulder length and looks a lot like her mother.\n\nThe trait that makes Melissa’s maternal grandparents (Gould’s parents) most proud is her musical ability. She plays piano and sings, they said.\n\nA friend said Melissa also plays violin in the school orchestra.\n\n“She’s just like my mother was,” Grandpa Joseph Messer said. “My mother sang in the Metropolitan. My uncle, her brother, gave a concert in Carnegie Hall on the piano, so Melissa is justlike my family – you can write that.\n\n“The genes are there.”\n\n“She’s cute and beautiful, just like my family,” Messer, 79, said from his Florida home.\n\nGrandmother Catherine Messer said Melissa knows about the famous trial.\n\n“She understands, and she has accepted it,” she said. “She’s 13.”\n\nMelissa stayed with her grandparents in Florida two years ago.\n\nShe visits her natural motherregularly in her Bayport, L.I., home, playing with Austin and Morgan, the two children Gould had after the Baby M case.\n\n“When she comes to my house, she seems to be able to handle the chaotic household, with all the kids and dogs and confusion,” Gould told People magazine earlier this year. “Six weeks can go by without her coming, and she just reenters very easily.”\n\n“We’ll bake together, she’ll confide in me about her skin or her bad-hair days – those typical confiding things,” Gould said. “‘Mom,’ she says, ‘if I stop biting my nails, will you stop smoking?'”\n\nGould has said she has a cool but cordial relationship with the Sterns.\n\nBut earlier this year, when Dateline NBC was going to broadcast a photograph of Melissa at age 11 that Gould had given them, the Sterns’ lawyers threatened the network and Gould with legal action, said Gary Skoloff, a Stern lawyer.\n\nThe Sterns cited a long-standing court order forbidding Gould to release any pictures of Melissa taken after age 2.\n\n“We want to make sure no current photograph is ever shown so that she can be recognized on the streets,” Skoloff said.\n\nThe photo was not shown.\n\nSince that confrontation, Gould has refused to speak to the press.\n\nThe Sterns have not granted an interview in more than a decade and did not want to comment for this story.\n\nSadly, Betsy Stern’s health has deteriorated. Neighbors said they have not seen her walking in years, nor have they seen her outside her house, even in a wheelchair, in a long time.\n\nHer belief that pregnancy would aggravate her MS sparked one of the many debates that captivated the nation.\n\nSome doctors argued that she was wrong, that many MS sufferers had given birth to healthy babies with no health consequences. Others insisted she was right because there was no way to predict the course of the illness.\n\nDespite her failing health, she has managed to stay involved in local politics by using the phone, making campaign calls recently for a school-board candidate, a neighbor said.\n\n“You wouldn’t want to meet a more polite and nicer person,” the neighbor said.\n\nMostly it is Bill Stern, a biologist, who does the work of suburban parents all across America – shuttling his child from one event to the other.\n\n“It’s Bill who does all the driving of Melissa to places,” a neighbor said.\n\nThe days when the block was full of reporters from all over the nation trying to squeeze quotes from tight-lipped neighbors are long gone.\n\n“New York Post?” a man who lives across the street from the Sterns asked. “Why would you come here for a local story?”"
