So who are these celebrities who live in New Jersey right now?\n\nSeveral New Jersey cities are recognised as America's most expensive zip codes, and though the title shifts from one city to another, it tells a lot about the quality of homes in New Jersey. With sprawling estates, private pools, manicured lawns, and tennis courts, NJ's homes average several million dollars in cost.\n\nNew Jersey perfectly balances quiet, busy city life and suburban life. Cities such as Alpine are removed from the bustle of city life while still offering residents access to their best. So doesn't it create curiosity to check out celebrity homes in New Jersey?\n\nCelebrities who live in New Jersey\n\nUnsurprisingly, cities in New Jersey have attracted many celebrities over the years. Some beautiful towns sit on scenic sites with little public hustle. There are few commercial locations to disturb the peace of celebrities' homes in NJ; for instance, Alpine doesn't have a high school or a public mail service.\n\nCelebrities here are sure to enjoy a quiet, uninterrupted life away from the limelight. Do you want to discover some of America's most familiar names that call this place home? Here are ten celebrity homes in New Jersey.\n\n1. Bruce Springsteen\n\nBorn and raised in Long Branch town, NJ, the musician seems to be a proud New Jersey native as his house is in Rumson, NJ. The personality initially resided in the 7-acre estate from 1983 until March 2017, when he sold it for $3.2 million.\n\nFortunately for his tremendous fans, he still settled in NJ. Springsteen is the owner of a 368-acre horse stable and house located in Colts Neck. He is among the celebrities living in New Jersey as his primary residence.\n\n2.
