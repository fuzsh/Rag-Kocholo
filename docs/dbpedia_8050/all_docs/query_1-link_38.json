        "text": "Theresa Donovan learned she was pregnant with Brady Blackâ€™s child on November 3, 2014, and former lover Kristen DiMera made plans to steal the baby after overhearing Theresa tell her friend Anne Milbauer the news. Kristen put a plan in place to steal the embryo and left town pregnant with the baby.\n\nKristen delivered the baby early, named him Christopher, and then learned he had an autoimmune disorder that required a bone marrow transplant. She sent a man named Clint to steal blood from Theresa and Brady, and he pretended to date Theresa to get what he wanted. Melanie Jonas became suspicious and uncovered the truth about the baby, and they all went to Italy to get him back. After Kristen fell to her death after fighting Marlena Evans, Brady and Theresa went back to Salem with their son, now named Tate.\n\nTate was kidnapped on July 8, 2016 after Theresa was drugged and fell asleep at the park, and Summer Townsend was the prime suspect. It turned out later that she didn't take the child and Victor Kiriakis was the next suspect. It was found that he wasn't culprit and the child was safe but with his grandmother, Kate Roberts. The child hasn't been seen much since except for in scenes with the nanny, Emma and the show recast him with twins, Colin and Kyle Schroeder, January 19, 2017, which aged them to toddlers."
