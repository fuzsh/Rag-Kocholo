        "text": "More details have emerged about a murder-suicide that happened in Little Egg Harbor Township early Saturday morning.\n\nAuthorities say that it was a former married couple that was involved.\n\nOcean County Prosecutor Bradley D. Billhimer says the murder victim has been identified at Kimberly Hoffman, 49, of Little Egg Harbor Township. Her ex-husband, Carl Schulz, Jr., 52, of Little Egg Harbor has been identified as the suspect.\n\nOfficers responded to a 911 call just after 5 am Saturday from a home on Whitemarsh Court. The caller said she believed someone was breaking into her apartment.\n\nWhen officers from Little Egg Harbor Township Police Department arrived on the scene, they found Hoffman dead from an apparent gunshot wound. They also found a dog, dead from gunshot wounds.\n\nSchulz was found with a gunshot wound to the head, but was still conscious. He later died at the hospital in Atlantic City.\n\nBillhimer says an investigation found that Schulz shot both Hoffman and the dog, before turning the gun on himself."
