        "text": "Lea Michele, born Lea Michele Sarfati, is an American actress, singer, and author known for her dynamic versatility across various entertainment platforms. Born on August 29, 1986, in The Bronx, New York, Michele is the only child of Mark David Sarfati, a former deli owner and currently real estate agent, and Edith Thomasina, a retired nurse. The actress comes from a mixed religious and ethnic background, with Sephardic Jewish roots from her father's side and Italian ancestry from her mother's side. Michele gained prominence for her role as Rachel Berry on the Fox television series Glee, which aired from 2009 to 2015. Her portrayal of the ambitious and talented high school student won her critical acclaim and recognition, including an Emmy nomination and two Golden Globe nominations. However, Michele's introduction to acting came much earlier. At just eight years old, she started her career on Broadway, playing Young Cosette in Les Misérables. Throughout her teenage years, she continued to perform in numerous Broadway shows, such as Ragtime and Fiddler on the Roof. Apart from acting, Lea Michele also made her mark in the music industry. She released her debut studio album, Louder, in 2014, which included the hit single \"Cannonball.\" Her subsequent albums, Places (2017) and Christmas in The City (2019), further showcased her vocal prowess and musical versatility. As an author, she has penned a New York Times bestselling book, Brunette Ambition, published in 2014, and its sequel, You First: Journal Your Way to Your Best Life, in 2015. Despite facing numerous personal and professional challenges, Lea Michele's unswerving dedication to her craft has solidified her status as an enduring figure in the entertainment industry.\n\nHope Davis (born March 23, 1964) is an American actress. She has starred in films such as About Schmidt (2002) and American Splendor (2003). For her role in the original Broadway production of God of Carnage in 2009, she received a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Play. She has also received two Emmy Award nominations, for her 2009 television roles in the series In Treatment and in the film The Special Relationship. In 2016, she appeared in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Captain America: Civil War as Tony Stark's mother Maria Stark.\n\nGary Malcolm Wright (April 26, 1943 – September 4, 2023) was an American musician and composer best known for his 1976 hit songs \"Dream Weaver\" and \"Love Is Alive\". Wright's breakthrough album, The Dream Weaver (1975), came after he had spent seven years in London. While in England, he played keyboards on former Beatle George Harrison's triple album All Things Must Pass (1970). His work from the late 1980s onwards embraced world music and the new age genre. Wright turned to film soundtrack work in the early 1980s, which led to him re-recording his most popular song, \"Dream Weaver\", for the 1992 comedy Wayne's World. Following Spooky Tooth's reunion tour in 2004, Wright performed live frequently, either as a member of Starr's All-Starr Band, with his own live band, or on subsequent Spooky Tooth reunions. In 2014, Penguin Random House published his autobiography, titled Dream Weaver: Music, Meditation, and My Friendship with George Harrison."
