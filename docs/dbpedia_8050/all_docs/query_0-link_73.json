The restaurant chain first opened in Florida, well over 50 years ago. Wow, I didn't realize this restaurant has been around this long. I do remember going when I was younger, my family loved Red Lobster.\n\nRed Lobster, according to a report from Bloomberg, rumors are that Red Lobster is going to file Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Will this mean mass closures around the country will happen, I'm hoping not.\n\nChapter 11 bankruptcy is often referred to as \"reorganization bankruptcy\" and typically allows a business to stay open while it reorganizes funds to pay off existing debt over time, according to azcentral.com. There has been no word from Red Lobster as of yet.\n\nThere are sixteen Red Lobster restaurants in New Jersey. The closest Red Lobster to us at the Jersey Shore is in Toms River.\n\nHow will this affect New Jersey Red Lobster restaurants?\n\nThe rumors are out there and everyone is talking about the \"possible\" bankruptcy, but there has been no word yet from Red Lobster.\n\nIs the problem really the Endless Shrimp at Red Lobster. This is by far the most popular deal Red Lobster has and consumers that come to the restaurant love the Endless Shrimp. As much shrimp as you can eat, only at Red Lobster.\n\nKeep Reading: #1 Favorite Place to Get a Pork Roll Egg & Cheese in NJ\n\nI do like Red Lobster so much, and I would be sad if it would close. I hate seeing any restaurants or businesses closing.\n\nBut, before coming to New Jersey, I had no idea just how fresh the seafood is at specialty seafood restaurants here at the Jersey Shore. We are spoiled."
