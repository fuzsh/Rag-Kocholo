It's a little over a week away.\n\nDo you love baby goats? Who doesn't? How cute? Maybe do something a \"little\" different this year that will for sure melt anyone's heart. How about a Valentine's Day Goat-Gram?\n\nWhat is a Valentine's Day Goat-Gram?\n\nGalactic Sky Farms will drive to your house with a baby goat visit and a bottle feeding and a small candy basket with a card for your loved one.\n\nGalactic Sky Farms is in Middlesex County, located in Winslow, NJ. Might be a little far for Ocean or Monmouth County residents, but if you know someone that lives close to this farm, it might be for them. The best way to get in contact the farm to schedule a Goat-Gram for Valentine's Day is through email. Their email is galacticskyfarms@gmail.com and their phone number is (856) 348-3027. **They've added more dates so contact them as soon as possible.**\n\nFor Valentine's Day, almost 250 million roses are grown in preparation for Valentine's day. The most popular Valentine's Day gift is roses and flowers and chocolates are second. Mom's favorite Valentine's gifts are homemade hearts from their kids. I totally agree. I still have one of Abby's from first grade.\n\nHappy Valentine's Day. Sending you a lot of love today and every day."
