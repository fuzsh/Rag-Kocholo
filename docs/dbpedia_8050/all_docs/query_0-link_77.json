        "text": "Gavin Houston [Interview]\n\nJuly 25, 2018 by rontrembathiii\n\nHello Dear Readers! We have a very exciting interview for you all today with an amazing performer that you should probably already know and love. It’s Gavin Houston, Everyone! He is a star of The Haves an the Have Nots on OWN, but on a more personal note, he is the man who played one of my favorite vocalists/people in the world, the amazing Babyface, in the Lifetime biopic about another one of my favorite vocalists/people, Toni Braxton, in the film Toni Braxton: Unbreak My Heart. I will admit that I went into the film biased because of how much I love these artists, but Gavin Houston did an absolutely amazing job in this role! Bias or not, it is undeniable that he was amazing in this role, and has been great in everything he has done.\n\nIn the interview below, you are going to find a man who has a perfect blend of confidence and humbleness that is so wonderful to find in a man with just damn much talent. Gavin Houston is a brilliant actor who has had a wonderful career thus far, and has a future that is only looking brighter. And I cannot wait to continue to watch is career as it progresses. So let’s cut this thing short, and get right into some amazing words from the brilliant Gavin Houston!\n\nWhen did you discover that you had a passion for the world of performance? How old were you when you decided that this was the way you wanted to earn a living?\n\nI realized that I had a passion for performance at about 9 years old. Growing up close to NYC in northern New Jersey, my parents often took my sister and I to plays on Broadway and in Central Park. I particularly remember seeing Yule Brenner in The King and I on Broadway, and Kevin Kline in Shakespeare’s Much Ado About Nothing. The effect on the audience from these performances immediately made me imagine myself on stage performing and sharing that same connection. I began acting professionally at 11 years old and stopped to go to college. My senior year in college, I saw a sign for an open casting call for a play at the university, went to the audition, and got the role. Just the feeling I got from auditioning, not even know if I got the role, kept me up all night with excitement. I knew I had found my calling. I then went on to do numerous plays in the Theatre department before heading back to New York to pursue it professionally.\n\nYou have appeared regularly on Tyler Perry’s original dramatic series, The Haves and the Haves Nots, on OWN. What has it been like to work on a series like this? The cast is loaded with some wonderful talent, so does this create a solid cast dynamic?\n\nWorking on HHN has been a great experience. We shoot so much and so quickly that it literally has been like going to an acting bootcamp. Not to mention the fact of playing a character completely different from me. Thru my time on the series, I’ve learned so much about myself and grown exponentially as an actor. The best part was getting to do it all with such a wonderful cast and crew. This series has definitely been the most challenging job I’ve ever had, but I feel it has prepared me for everything and anything to come in the future.\n\nThe cast of my show is definitely filled with some wonderful talent, but moreover, the cast is filled with wonderful people. The bond and the connection that we all have from being on this ride for so long, makes the work feel second nature. We know each other, we’ve grown with each other, and all the while been there for each other. The trust and the atmosphere has always lent itself to creative vulnerability and freedom.\n\nIn 2016, you appeared in Lifetime biopic Toni Braxton: Unbreak My Heart. Now, I do love Braxton as an artist, but I absolutely ADORE the legendary figure known as Babyface, who you happened to portray in the film! What sort of process did you go through to tap into the world of such a legend? When did you realize that you were ready to play Babyface?\n\nIts funny because all throughout high school and beyond, I’ve always been told that I resemble Babyface. So when this role came up, I was excited for the opportunity. After getting cast, Toni Braxton told me that Babyface was the one who selected me, so not only was it an honor, it was a huge responsibility. In my opinion, tapping into him, or any character for that matter, is about tapping into the soul of a person. I watched countless hours of material on him. I also really researched his life, his background, his childhood, the people in his life, etc. I really don’t like to see imitations and feel like if we, as an audience, can feel the person living inside the body of the actor, then we can see the person living on the outside. To this day, I think Denzel Washington, who physically looked completely different from Malcolm X is a testament to that. I was just lucky enough to have the resemblance of Babyface. Lol.\n\nAnd while we are on the Toni Braxton biopic, that film happened to be directed by the legendary Vondie Curtis Hall. I am curious to know what it was like to work under the guise of such a legendary figure? And when it comes to directors in general, what do you appreciate most from a director? What can a great director do to help a performer?\n\nWorking with Vondie was amazing. He is truly an actor’s director. Not to mention the fact that he is such a likable and down to earth person. I really felt that working with him was a collaborative process. He also gave the actors so much freedom to play and still make discoveries during the filming process. What I appreciate most about a director is the ability of knowing how to balance being hands on and being hands off. They say the majority of the work for the director is in casting the right person. So I love directors that allow the actor artistic freedom and aren’t beholden to one way of doing things. I also like a director who builds a rapport and takes the time to talk to their actors even while filming. One of the best things I’ve ever seen a director do, was while on set, and surrounded with crew and people moving things and noise, take the actors who were about to film to a separate quiet space, and go over where the characters were in the scene and just touch base on the relationships, backstory, and events leading up to the scene.\n\nTo add even more versatility to the plethora of roles you have worked on, you also worked on the Soap Opera series Guiding Light for a number of years. We’ve spoken with a lot of writers and actors from the Soap world over the years, and we always are interested in one major thing: What was it like to work a series with the extremely fast and constant pace of a Soap Opera? What did you learn and take away from your experience on program like this?\n\nWorking on Guiding Light right after college and General Hospital later on, were great forms of on the job training. In my experience, soap opera’s shoot the fastest, and largest amount of dialogue per day, of any form of scripted television. So after doing soaps, everything else feels easy. The amount of dialogue you are constantly responsible for and how quickly you have to learn it, is really great training. Plus, because the pace is so fast, you really learn to trust yourself and your instincts and don’t have time to get in your head. Not to mention taking in the blocking and stage direction quickly. So I think its great training for any actor. There were days that I literally feared filming, but somehow was able to get through it and remember all my lines. You really learn what you can handle if given the right motivation.\n\nWhat does the future hold for you? Anything you would like to share with our readers?\n\nMy future holds a Film career. I see myself becoming another regular on a show as well, but I feel it will all lead into a film career. I’ve refocused and rededicated my training and feel that it will play a huge part in what’s to come for me in the future. I really see myself getting into films or shows with lots of action, explosions, fight scenes etc. Or playing a Marvel or DC character.\n\nWhat was the last thing that made you smile?\n\nThe last thing that made me smile was walking into my house last night and finding my dog. I walk in and can’t seem to find her anywhere, so finally I start looking in the rooms. I look in one of the guest rooms and see her laying on the bed, which she is a place she is not allowed to be. I turn on the lights, and she slowly turns her head back and looks at me while wagging her tale. I honestly just shook my head and smiled. 🙂\n\nAdrienne Barbeau [Interview]\n\nJuly 23, 2018 by rontrembathiii\n\nAdrienne Barbeau is an absolutely amazing actress who has had some amazing success in the world of theatre, film, and television alike. She is without a doubt, an absolute legend! She also happens to be an extremely nice person who was kind enough to share a few words with us here today at Trainwreck’d Society!\n\nThere are so many different ways that you could already know Adrienne that it would be so hard to pin them all down. One definitive way for our regular readers here at TWS is definitely within the horror film world. Barbeau has appeared in some of the greatest classics of the horror film world such as Creepshow, Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death, Killer, The Fog, and so many more.\n\nSome of you may recognize her from her appearance as the original Rizzo in the stage production of Grease, or in her television role in the hit television series Maude. No matter how you know this amazing actress, you are going to love our amazing interview with the brilliant Adrienne Barbeau today. She is not only an great actress, but a brilliant writer as well! Check out the interview, and be sure to find her amazing work as an author as well!\n\nSo, without further rambling, please digitally welcome some great words from the brilliant Adrienne Barbeau!\n\nWhen did you first decide that you wanted to join the world of acting? When did you know that it was what you wanted to do for a living?\n\nI didn’t realize acting could be a profession until I was in my first year of college, figuring I’d get my degree and maybe teach acting in a high school somewhere. I’d been doing musicals since I was 15, but that was just something I loved; it never crossed my mind I could earn a living doing it. When a friend suggested I go to New York to study and see if I could work on Broadway, I thought, “Well, okay, why not?” I told myself if I wasn’t a working actor by the time I was 25, I’d go back to school and get my degree. I was 20 when I did my first Equity job, and three years later I was on Broadway!\n\nIn recent years, I have managed to discover the joy that is the television show Maude, which you were a regular cast member on, and did a phenomenal job at, by the way! The show is rather progressive in nature, especially for the time it was on. Which I find to be wonderful! So, what was it like to work on a show like this during this time period? Was it liberating in some kind of way?\n\nI hadn’t watched television until I did Maude, having gone from my first Broadway show to the original production of Grease where I created the role of Rizzo – never being at home at night, so I didn’t understand at first how unique Maude was in the tv landscape at the time. All I knew was I loved the writing, loved the cast, loved the producers, and I was incredibly fortunate to be a part of such a groundbreaking, funny, socially significant, and successful show.\n\nWe are huge fans of the world of horror here at TWS, and you have become one of the biggest horror icons in your career. In your personal opinion, what do you enjoy the most about working on horror projects? What sets them apart from other genres of work that you have done?\n\nI guess what I enjoy most is the opportunity to take names and kick ass. And play a gamut of emotions that rarely show up, all together at least, in other genres. I mean, how many female judges get to blow away the bad guys with anything other than a verdict?\n\nAnother aspect of performance that we have covered quite a bit here is voice-over work, in which you are extremely accomplished in as well! Everything from portraying Catwoman to voicing a computer mainframe in one of my personal favorite action films, Demolition Man…..you have done it all! So, how do you enjoy the voice over world? How does it compare to on screen work?\n\nI love doing voice work. Don’t have to put on make-up, don’t have to get fitted for costumes, don’t have to wake up at 4:30 am to get to the set on time. And I do truly enjoy having to use only my voice to express what the character is going through. Plus, no worries about memorizing the lines word perfect – I can read them!\n\nWhen you look back on your illustrious career thus far, what would you say you are your most pride-filling accomplishment?\n\nWell…the most pride-filling accomplishment of my life is raising my three sons and seeing them become the men they are. In terms of my career? I’m proud of my work on stage in Grease and Pippin, especially; and of Ruthie in HBO’s Carnivale, and I do love Billie in Creepshow.\n\nWhat does the future hold for you? Anything you would like to plug to our readers?\n\nI’d love your readers to know about my second career as an author. My memoir, There Are Worse Things I Could Do, and all three of my vampyre novels (about a scream queen who is the leader of a clan of famous Hollywood stars who all happen to be vampyres) Vampyres of Hollywood, Love Bites, and Make Me Dead are all available on Amazon. Love Bites, for which I co-wrote the screenplay, has been optioned by Harrison Smith (Death House) and hopefully will have a life off the page.\n\nAnd I just completed seven features last year, so, with any luck at all, they’ll show up on the big screen soon.\n\nWhat was the last thing that made you smile?\n\nWe just celebrated my birthday and my grandnephew’s first birthday with a 6 hour party in a beautiful park in northern California, and watching my 21 year old boys play with their one year old cousins STILL has me smiling. Grinning, actually.\n\nCheck out Adrienne’s wonderful books on Amazon today, and if you are a Kindle Unlimited member, you can check out for FREE today!\n\nJonathan Schmock [Interview]\n\nJuly 20, 2018 by rontrembathiii\n\nToday’s interview subject is a man who has had such a varied career in so many different fields in a career spanning so many decades. Just the plethora of amazing projects he is responsible for or worked on is absolutely astonishing and extremely impressive. And the man has seriously done it all. Whether he is writing, directing, voice over, acting, etc., he has mastered it all! And it would behoove us to preface that he is also an acclaimed political cartoonist as well, which we will discuss below!\n\nAlthough I didn’t know it then, Jonathan Schmock was responsible for so many of the shows that brought me so much entertainment always entirely throughout my childhood. From his work on Blossom, creating Sabrina The Teenage Witch, as well as acting and/or working on set on brilliant shows like Dharma & Greg and My Wife & Kids. And he moved right into my adulthood with his political writing on Reel Time with Bill Maher, and appearances on shows like The War at Home and Arrested Development.\n\nSeriously folks, I am so happy to have Jonathan Schmock with us here at Trainwreck’d Society to day to discuss is amazing career, his political takes, and what he has been up to lately! So please enjoy some amazing words from this genius and brilliant creator Jonathan Schmock!\n\nWhen did you realize that you the world of film and television was the way you wanted to earn your living? What was it that initially drew you into this world?\n\nI think it was originally the theatre and it grabbed me young before I knew any better. My parents would take me to shows at the Old Globe in San Diego, or the Starlight Opera. I just wanted to be a part of it, to go backstage, to not be “a civilian.” I was hooked. After acting school it just seemed natural to gravitate to film and TV.\n\nYou received a couple of well deserved Emmy nods for your work writing on the beloved political program, Real Time with Bill Maher. I am always curious to know what it is like to work on a variety show centered around American politics? It can be a pretty grim topic, but the when you through comedy into the mix, it sort of lightens the mood. So how was your experience working on a program like this?\n\nBeing on Real Time was a pressure cooker. We had no idea on Monday what Bill would fill an hour with on Friday. Day by day we’d piece together the segments; the monologue, the new rules, the guest segments, the editorial. We also used to shoot a short film or a campaign ad parody. The writing and producing staff was amazingly talented, not only were they great comedy writers but each had a background in politics as well. As the week progressed we’d have to be prepared to tear out stuff for breaking news. The show airs LIVE at 7:00 in L.A. so Friday afternoons could be intense. Also we were at the mercy of all the shows that aired daily; The Daily Show, Colbert, the late night shows. They might kill one of our bits before we got to Friday. Best of all is that Bill is totally fearless and honest. We only went for the best.\n\nIn somewhat of the same form as your work on Real Time, I have noticed that you are also a brilliant political cartoonist in your own right. What inspired you to get into this line of work amongst the plethora of other gigs you have done in the creative world?\n\nWell, I don’t know about brilliant, but thanks! The first thing I ever did, even before acting, was drawing. I was always drawing cartoons. I would draw funny greeting cards and try to sell them to my family… The thing that’s great about cartooning is that you can complete something creative, and hopefully meaningful, by yourself. Like a lot of people, I’ve gotten more and more into politics and that’s really coming to a boil now. So if I can focus that passion into a thought or a way of looking at an issue, or make a joke of hypocrisy, it feels great. It’s a mission. Plus with the internet you can have an idea, draw it and share it with millions of people that same day. That’s amazing.\n\nYou were one of the brilliant minds behind one of my favorite sitcoms from my youth known as Sabrina the Teenage Witch. I looked forward to this show each week, and whenever else I was able to see my teenage TV crush, Melissa Joan Hart. It was a brilliant program with a successful run. So, what made you decide to develop this program? What was it about the Archie comic series that you just knew would make for some quality television?\n\nIt was Melissa and her mom, Paula, who had the brilliant idea. They secured the rights for Sabrina. I was one of several people who pitched concepts for the show. I was lucky enough to get it started and write the pilot. Sabrina just seemed to be such a perfect show for kids. “Kid shows” aren’t silly. They’re about the firsts in our life; first kiss, first driver’s license, first big fight. For me the idea that we only fit in when we realize and accept that we’re different is what Sabrina’s about.\n\nIn your incredibly impressive career, you have worn many different proverbial hats in the business. From acting to writing, producing, directing, and more. With that being said, what would you consider to be your favorite form of expression to work on? If you were to find yourself in a position to only work in one field, what would it be?\n\nWow, that’s a hard one. I really love it all. I love show business, as much now as when I was a kid. I guess if I had to choose I’d say I really love acting, I love being funny, I love doing drama, and the reason is because I’m such a ham. I just love it. One of the cool things about getting older is that you get to play those cool eccentric parts. I love directing too, because it’s so collaborative. It’s the opposite of cartooning. I guess that would be second. It’s great working together with people, writers, actors, on a project, collaborating together. Being at the center, the hub of something. It’s inspiring.\n\nWhat does the future hold for you? Anything you would like to plug to our readers?\n\nKeep your eyes on jonathanschmock.com.\n\nAlso, there’s a short film Keep Calm and Tampon. It was directed by Claudia Lonow and I helped produce it.\n\nhttps://www.keepcalmandtamponfilm.com\n\nhttp://msmagazine.com/blog/2018/05/28/heart-hilarious-menstrual-equity-musical-keep-calm-tampon/\n\nWhat was the last thing that made you smile?\n\nThis question! Thanks!\n\nRichard Cansino [Interview]\n\nJuly 16, 2018 by rontrembathiii\n\nAs some of you fine readers may have noticed, we have really been digging deep into the world of voice acting lately. We have especially put a primary focus on the voice actors behind the brilliant Fallout series that we all know and love. Last week was actually ALL Fallout voice actors. And yet, here we are again with just one more (for now) to share with you all. But, trust me, Richard Cansino is far more than just another few characters from Fallout 4. He is a wise and extremely talented man in the world of voice over and on screen work, and probably gives the greatest bit of insight into the business that we have had to date!\n\nRichard has a lot to say about his career thus far, what it has been like to evolve in the digital world of voice over and loop groups and beyond. He even gives insight into the insane fandom in the world of anime, of which I truly knew nothing about. So, I really think we just dive right into it! But, I have to say that it is a true honor and a privilege to have another legendary voice over artist here at Trainwreck’d Society! So folks, please enjoy some amazing words from the brilliant Richard Cansino!\n\nHow did you find yourself in your line of work as an actor and a master of the voice over world? Was this a world you always dreamed about being a part of? Or did you just sort of find yourself doing it for a living?\n\nI come from a showbiz family. My grandfather was a big star in vaudeville. He & his brothers and sister were known as The Dancing Cansinos. They introduced Flamenco dancing to America and he married a Ziegfeld Girl, my grandmother Volga Hayworth. My father’s sister, (Auntie Rita), was Rita Hayworth, (yes, the Hollywood legend!), and I’m also distantly related by marriage to Ginger Rogers and Donna Reed.\n\nBecause of the long show business history of my family, I really didn’t have too many romantic illusions about it. I had enjoyed being in a couple of high school plays but I knew acting wasn’t a very practical way to make a living so, when it came time to go to college, I decided to be a language major. I figured it would be easier to get a job if I spoke Spanish at least. But as luck would have it, Glendale Junior College, (in my home town of Glendale, CA), didn’t offer Spanish as a major and I couldn’t afford the schools that did. So I decided to take a few drama classes in Jr. College, hoping that one of the required courses in other subjects would catch my fancy but nothing gave me as much pleasure or satisfaction as theater so I kind of fell into acting because nothing else suited me.\n\nI studied acting for over seven years before I felt ready to try making a living at it. I graduated Magna Cum Lousy at Cal State University Long Beach, (Go Beach!), and the American Academy of Dramatic Arts/West. When I graduated from the American Academy my goal was just to make a living as an actor. It never occurred to me there was even such a thing as a voice over career. I knew there were actors doing cartoon voices but my focus was to get on-camera and stage work. For about ten years I managed to eek out a meager living doing a combination of theatre, children’s theatre, some TV parts and several “B” films. Some years weren’t as good as others, though, so there were times when I had to do “survival jobs” between acting gigs. One of those survival gigs was painting houses and one of the houses I painted, (and really terribly, I have to say), belonged to a couple of friends of mine, Steve Kramer & Melora Harte.\n\nSteve and Melora had been making a pretty good living writing, acting, and directing dubbing scripts for anime and foreign film projects. Steve, at the time, was directing an anime series called Soccer Boy, basically following characters around the world as they attend World Cup soccer matches. Steve needed actors who could not only hit sync but speak in a variety of different accents. I have always been good with accents and dialects and Melora suggested Steve call me in for a day after she heard me clowning around with accents at a party were were both at.\n\nDubbing is not for everyone. There aren’t a ton of actors who can match the lip movements of the characters on screen and make it sound real so Steve was reluctant to call me in but he decided to give me a try by hiring me to do voices in the background, (known in the biz as “walla”), with a group of seasoned dubbing actors. So, there I was making background conversation with the other actors when Steve asked me to step up to the mic and do one line for one character. I didn’t realize he was auditioning me, otherwise I would have been very nervous, and I hit the line perfectly on cue and every word fit into the character’s mouth perfectly in one take. So I passed the test I didn’t know I was taking!\n\nI aced the rest of the day’s work but didn’t realize that most of the other actors I was working with were very active as dubbing writers and directors too. They were all happy to discover another actor who could dub well and be fun to work with and I started getting called in by them on other projects.\n\nAbout a month later, Saban Entertainment was casting a replacement for Bob Bergen on a series called Eagle Riders because Bob had left to voice Porky Pig and Tweety Bird at Warner Brothers. My voice just happened to sound so similar to Bob’s that they didn’t even have to redo a lot of the lines he had already recorded. I worked on that series for a year, (Bryan Cranston voiced my character’s co-pilot!), and when it was over, they offered me a part on another show called Super Pig, followed by another show and another after that. I ended up working for several years on Saban projects like Flint: The Time Detective, Digimon, and Power Rangers. During that time, I worked with more and more people with connections in dubbing, looping and video games and I, unintentionally, was networking with them. After a while, they would just call me in for work without me even having to audition! What a luxury for an actor!\n\nSo, basically, with the help of Steve Kramer and Melora Harte, I just lucked into it! But even though I was lucky, my training prepared me to take advantage of the opportunity when it came a-knockin’. As Branch Rickey, the general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers said: “Luck is the residue of design.”\n\nBoy, that was a really long answer to a short question!\n\nOne of the projects you have worked on happens to be a video game in a franchise that is very near and dear to our hearts here at TWS. That project would be Fallout 4. You voiced three very unique, and actually pretty hilarious in their own right, characters on the game: The Railroad’s star tourist Ricky Dalton, Diamond City’s beloved chem dealer Solomon, and the wrongfully(?) imprisoned Lorenzo Cabot. So, what was it like to join the Fallout franchise? Was there anything that set this series apart from other projects you have worked on?\n\nThis is going to sound terrible but I had no idea I had worked on anything in the Fallout franchise until you asked me now. Maybe if I heard some of the lines, I’d recognize the characters you mention but right now I’m drawing a blank.\n\nIt’s not my fault, though. Up until a few months ago, most video game companies would never tell us the actual name of whatever game we were working on. They always gave the project a pseudonym because, I guess, they were afraid of corporate espionage or something. I worked on one of the Halo iterations but had no idea until I’d already completed the job and they sent me a copy of a previously released Halo game.\n\nThe production companies get a bit paranoid, in my opinion. They frequently make us sign a non-disclosure agreement just to submit an audition. Usually, the auditions consist of maybe a page of lines so how much can an actor discern about a project from only a page? They give us actors way too much credit for being smarter than we really are.\n\nAnd, frankly, some of my lack of recollection is probably because I don’t remember most of the projects I’ve worked on. Here’s an example: My girlfriend bought a DVD of a Korean movie called Old Boy. Neither of us speak Korean so I suggested we watch the English dubbed option because the subtitles would be too small to read on my little TV. As the film went on I recognized a few of the voices, including my friend Steve Kramer’s. But there was one actor who really bothered me. He had the same vocal range as me but was way better. His sync was perfect and his acting was really super. He was very natural sounding, even though he was doing a really emotional scene just before committing suicide — or maybe he got pushed off a roof — I don’t remember, (see what I mean about not remembering?!). Anyway, as I watched him in this scene I started to get more and more upset.\n\n“Damn!” I said, “I don’t know who this guy is but he’s really good! And he’s in my vocal range and age! I’ll bet he’s getting all the parts I’ve been auditioning for lately. Can’t really blame the directors for casting him over me, though. He’s really good!” I stayed upset about this new guy usurping my career all through the film until, toward the end, I thought I saw some familiar footage. Could it be I had worked on it? Maybe I’d done some scenes where I was one of the crowd voices? So I rewound the tape and started to watch it again when my memory suddenly clicked in. That actor I was so upset about was me! I had completely forgotten I’d done the part. But at least I was pleased with my work!\n\nA friend of mine had a similar experience only worse. He saw an old rerun of Kojak or something, saw a young actor, and didn’t realize the actor was him thirty years ago! Nobody ever lost money betting on actors not being smart!\n\nWhile I am honestly have very little knowledge about the world of anime, I am inclined to believe that a lot of our readers may be huge fans of some of the work you have been involved with in that world. I’ve found it to have a very devoted fan base. So how has your interactions been with anime fans, or just fans in general? Do you find some pretty die hard fanatics out there? What do fans really seem to go apeshit over when they meet you in person?\n\nAnime fans go apeshit over my Adonis-like physique, movie idol sexiness and charm, my Einstein-like intellect, my rapier wit, and, mostly, my humbleness. But seriously, folks. . .\n\nBoy, anime fans are absolutely amazingly die hard! I had no idea of their devotion to whatever series or characters that resonate with them! Y’know, when we record, we are in a little room where the walls are covered in foam rubber and there’s an adjoining room separated by a glass window where the director and engineer, and sometimes the producer sit — and that’s it. There’s no audience. We’re performing in a vacuum and have no idea of whether people like our efforts to entertain them or not.\n\nOn rare occasions I’ve gotten a fan letter but, for the most part, I’d never interacted with fans of anime until last year when, for the first time, I attended an anime convention. It was at the Alias Convention in Trinidad and Tobego. Trinidad and Tobego?! Who woulda thunk that?! The “Trinis” treated me like a huge movie star! That was a huge surprise but, beyond that, they spent all kinds of time, money, and ingenuity making costumes of their favorite anime characters and seeing the results really impressed me.\n\nTwo ladies named their oldest child after a character I voiced, two other fans brought me gifts – I mean nice gifts!, and one fellow really left an impression. He loved one particular anime character of mine that has a big scar in the shape of an “X” on his cheek. So, he held out his knuckle and showed me a large “X” shaped scar on it.\n\n“You see this scar?” he asked, “I accidentally slashed my knuckle and knew it would leave a mark so I took a knife and cut it more so it would make an ‘X’!” Now that’s devotion — or maybe just psychosis, (wink, wink).\n\nOn a more serious side, there were several people who told me that watching my show(s) helped them through very difficult childhoods. I guess they fantasized about being like my character in one series who was constantly having to overcome huge challenges and long odds, (usually in the form of duels), and just when it seemed he was defeated, he always managed to rally and find a way to succeed. That’s a powerful message to a kid who’s going through hard times. I’m grateful and actually humbled that I was able to play a small part in helping them get through those difficulties.\n\nYou have been in the voice over game for quite some time, and have probably seen a lot of changes in the world with the advancements in technology that have occurred. So in your obviously expert opinion, what have been some major changes in this industry that you have noticed? Are some concepts still the same as when you started?\n\nThe major change is that we no longer get papyrus scripts written in hieroglyphics. . . Just kidding. . . The scripts were carved on stone tablets.\n\nActually, there have been some major changes in technology. In the old days, before I got into the voice over world, there was no such thing as videotape. Whenever they would need to rerecord or dub a line, they’d clip out a piece of film, make it into a loop and literally run that little loop of film over and over until they got what they wanted. To this day, the rerecording/dubbing process is known as “looping”.\n\nBy the time I got into dubbing and voice over, everything was on videotape. Whenever we’d miss the sync or the director wanted a different line reading, the engineer would rewind the tape to the beginning of the line and we would start all over again and again until we finally got it right. That was a slow process. The average actor would be able to record about 15 – 20 lines an hour. I would be a bit higher, usually. I’d like to think it was because I was incredibly talented but it might have been because the directors figured there was no use trying to coax a better performance out of a slug like me so they just opted to move ahead.\n\nNowadays everything is digital and computerized. There’s a computer program called Pro Tools that most of the studios use now. If you don’t hit the sync quite right now or if you miss taking a pause, or you finish too soon or too late, you don’t have to start over like we use to. Now, the engineer just moves everything around digitally. They can put in a pause if you miss one, stretch out your line if you finish too soon, and compress it if you finish too late. They can do that for individual words if they want to! They can raise and lower your pitch and add all kinds of effects right during the recording session where, before, they’d need to do things like that after the session because it was so time consuming. This has really sped up the process. Now, I can get in 25 to 30 loops an hour or more. The only thing they can’t do with digitization is change the actor’s performance, thank God, or we’d all be unemployed!\n\niPads have replaced scripts too. When I started, we’d get paper scripts and we’d make adjustments like word changes and pauses, etc. with a pencil directly onto the script. Now everything is controlled by the engineer from the booth. I just stand and watch while the adjustments magically appear on the tablet as the engineer enters the info. I can’t say I care for that particular innovation. I like to make my own scribbles that I know I can recognize without having to rely on anyone else’s notations but what are ya gonna do?\n\nThe basic concept of dubbing has remained the same: Put English words into mouths speaking a foreign language and make it look and sound real. At least that’s true for live action films with real people in them. The concept has changed for animation. When I started, a lot of attention was paid to hitting the internal sync. That is not only starting the first and last words of a line at the same time as the character, but also matching the sync of the words between the start and finish of the line. We took a lot of pride in making the entire line fit into the mouths of the characters. It took some time to get it right but the finished product looked better. Nowadays there is so much pressure to get the product out quickly and cheaply, that a lot of producers only care if the line starts and finishes on time. Not as much attention is paid to the internal sync and I feel the finished product suffers because of it. Other than economics, I think part of the reason for this is that most producers just don’t see it when the internal sync is off. It drives me crazy but they just don’t seem to care.\n\nI have a theory that one of the reasons the producers don’t care about internal sync is that a lot of anime fans don’t seem to care either. What many of the most opinionated fans care most about is “authenticity”. I take that to mean they want the English dubbed version to look as close to the original Japanese, (especially Japanese!), or Korean or whatever as possible. Well, in my not-so-humble opinion, the original voice work is often terrible! The sync on the original is often times way off. Sometimes a 40 year old voice is coming out of a character drawn to look 20. I’ve heard that’s because in Japan the audience values performance over everything else. They also have certain actors who they want to hear, whether those actors’ voices are appropriate for the characters or not. Don’t get me wrong, here. I’m not knocking the actors’ performances, (lots of them are fabulous!) — I just don’t care for their dubbing. So I guess a lot of producers figure if the audience doesn’t care about sync, why should they? Especially if it might cost them more money! Can’t really blame them, can you?\n\nAs far as any changes in games, I really don’t feel the new technology has affected how actors approach their jobs. Games are much less demanding than dubbing in that we don’t have to match anyone else’s rhythms, or performances. We just have to read the scripts and finish within a certain time. There’s nothing to look at on screen because they animate the characters to our voices so things go much faster than with dubbing. I’m sure the engineers are much happier with digitization but as far as acting for games, I don’t think it’s changed my technique at all.\n\nI hope you didn’t want short answers. . .\n\nWhat does the future hold for you? Anything you would like to tell our readers about?\n\nWell, my crystal ball tells me I’m about to be in a live action movie called Time Pulse. I also have co-written a film that is “in process”, as they say, at Hallmark Studios. I think that’s code for “We’re thinking it over.” And if any of your readers want to finance a micro budget movie, I’ve co-written a comedy that people have told me has the potential to be one of those “cult classics”. So if you’ve got a couple hundred thousand smackers you don’t know what to do with, get in touch with me!\n\nWhat was the last thing that made you smile?\n\nYou asking little ol’ me for an interview!"
