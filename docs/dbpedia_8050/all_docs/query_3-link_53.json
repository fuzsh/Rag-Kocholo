        "text": "Honors US History 1 covers the period from the Revolution up to World War I. First semester we will be studying Revolutionary and antebellum America, with special emphases on the Constitution and slavery. Second semester we will be studying the Civil War Era and the Age of Industry, including Progressivism, with a special Native Nations project.\n\nHonors US 1 is a challenging course, with a college textbook and many primary sources assigned, as well as considerable writing. Grading is done on a point system, from homework quizzes of a few points up to tests worth 60-80 points.\n\nThe proficiency for Honors US 1 can be found on the Social Studies homepage for Tenafly High School."
