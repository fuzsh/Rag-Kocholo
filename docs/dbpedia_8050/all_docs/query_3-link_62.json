Some of our paraprofessionals have been with us for over twenty years! Our full-time paras are also in danger of losing their health insurance. They work in our classrooms, cafeterias, libraries and nurse's offices to assist all of our students throughout the district. They offer academic support to some of our most vulnerable students, as well as being part of their emotional support system throughout the day. Please stand up for these hardworking people! Let's get some answers and work together to save these jobs. These people are the backbone of our education system. Let's support them the way they've always supported our kids. Please sign and share."
