        "text": "Designed in 1872 by prominent architect Daniel Topping Atwood, the station is a prominent community landmark that recalls Tenafly's genesis as a fashionable commuter suburb. Its use declined after the opening of the George Washington Bridge, and the station closed in 1966.\n\nThe grant funded the restoration of the train station to its original appearance, including reconstruction of the canopy and conservation of sandstone walls."
