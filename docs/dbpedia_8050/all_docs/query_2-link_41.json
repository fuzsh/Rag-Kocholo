        "text": "I can't help but blush as I write this.\n\nThere are some towns in New Jersey that will make you giggle if you have even the slightest dirty mind. C'mon, you know you do. Ha ha.\n\nIt may take you a minute or so, but once you realize it, you'll never think about this towns again without laughing.\n\nWithout further ado, here they are. You may have already heard of some of them.\n\nRamtown\n\nWho in the world named this town? Oh my! How can you not laugh?\n\nNot everyone has a dirty mind, but if you do, you'll have a field day with this one. Ha ha.\n\nNutley\n\nHow do you tell someone your address without laughing? I wouldn't be able to keep a straight face.\n\nThe town has its own diner. I'm giggling.\n\nMiddlesex\n\nYup, there's a Middlesex, NJ. Imagine living in Middlesex Village.\n\nIt's bad enough to be named Middlesex, then to have a restaurant called, Texas Weiner...it just keeps getting better.\n\nButtzville\n\nWhen you tell someone you live in Buttzville, do they say, \"Excuse me?\" I would.\n\nThere's a good chance you've been to Buttzville. It's home to Hot Dog Johnny's. Yum.\n\nFort Dix\n\nFort Dix is home to a big military base. I'm sure they've heard some jokes about the name.\n\nWildwood\n\nWildwood and its famous balls. Sorry, I had to. Too funny.\n\nDo you think anyone ever asks the people at the Wildwood Welcome Center how the town got its dirty-sounding name?\n\nThere may be more, but that's all I could come up with. I should look at the other states, I'm sure there are others."
