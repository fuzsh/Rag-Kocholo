        "text": "Hannah Horovitz, who has died of cancer aged 73, made a distinctive contribution to international music as a promoter, both in the public sector and through the enterprises she ran. Born in Vienna, the youngest child of the international art publisher Bela Horovitz, founder of the Phaidon Press, and his wife Lotte, Hannah came to Britain with her family in 1938 following Hitler's annexation of Austria.\n\nAfter St Paul's girls' school, west London, and a period in the book trade, she worked at Expo 67 in Montreal, returning to London as a media researcher. Soon afterwards she joined the Harold Holt concert agency, which led her to set up Hannah Horovitz Management in 1971. There she fielded an impressive list of international artists, aiding performers such as the pianists Andr√°s Schiff, Craig Sheppard and Ilana Vered, the Cleveland Quartet and the flautist Jean-Pierre Rampal.\n\nOne of Hannah's most remarkable achievements was to engineer the world premiere of the opera Der Kaiser von Atlantis (The Emperor of Atlantis), written by two Czechs, the composer Viktor Ullmann and the poet Peter Kien, in the Theresienstadt ghetto camp in 1943. The manuscript of this masterly satire on Hitler found its way to the conductor Kerry Woodward, whom Hannah introduced to the American director Rhoda Levine, thus making possible the production at the Netherlands Opera Studio in Amsterdam in December 1975. The work has since been filmed, recorded and performed worldwide.\n\nAs deputy director of the British Council's visiting arts unit (1978-96), Hannah introduced to the UK outstanding artists in the fields of dance, theatre and opera, working tirelessly on their behalf to secure visas and support and forging links between British and international cultural communities. During this period her love of American Yiddish culture and humour found expression in her initiating the UK's first Day of Yiddish Culture in 1986 in collaboration with Michael Vyner, then artistic director of the London Sinfonietta. The event included the London debut of the Californian ensemble The Klezmorim, which encouraged the klezmer revival in the UK.\n\nOn retirement, Hannah was awarded honorary membership of the British Council, and she continued to devise innovative projects such as the international debut recital series at the Wallace Collection in central London.\n\nLaunched in 1997 by the Springboard Concert Trust, of which she was a co-founder, the concerts won great acclaim, introducing over the course of 10 seasons more than 70 young artists in 43 concerts and bringing more than 8,000 people to the museum, many for the first time. The style and panache with which Hannah introduced each capacity-filled event reflected the appeal of the format, a recital in the beautiful surrounds of the Great Gallery, preceded by champagne and croissants and a private view of the entire collection.\n\nThroughout her career, Hannah had an unfailing instinct for new talent and opened many doors for young artists at the threshold of their careers. She believed in the performer's duty to make audiences feel welcome, reflecting her deep concern for and interest in people, which was evident in her wide circle of colleagues and friends.\n\nTreasured by her large family, she is survived by her brother, the composer Joseph Horovitz, and her sister, the art publisher Elly Miller."
