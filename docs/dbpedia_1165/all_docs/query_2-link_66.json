        "text": "As we leap into our 38th season, it is a time for reflection and innovation. 2023/24 marks the 40th anniversary of the death of George Balanchine, who was not only the cornerstone of modern American ballet but also a teacher, mentor, and an inspiration to generations of dancers and choreographers. It is not an overreach to say that without Balanchine, there would be no Miami City Ballet.\n\nTo honor the legacy of Balanchine, and mark the privileged role we have in the stewardship of his work, we have curated this season to invite you on a journey through a century of ballet. Each mixed program is anchored by a cherished classic from the Balanchine canon, and builds upon that foundation through next generation masterworks and world premieres from today’s youngest voices in dance.\n\nThe season opens with Serenade, the first original ballet George Balanchine created in the United States in 1934. The program is joined by Twyla Tharp’s “fierce, driving, and relentless” In the Upper Room, and the world premiere of Sea Change from Bessie Award winning artist, Miami’s very own Jamar Roberts.\n\nThe winter season begins with everyone’s favorite festive tradition, George Balanchine’s The Nutcracker® spreading holiday joy with our distinct Miami twist. Quickly following is our second mixed program, Winter Mix, which showcases two world premieres from Miami natives Margarita Armas and Durante Verzola. Alongside these new works are masterpieces from their predecessors – Alexei Ratmansky’s Concerto DSCH, and a reimagined production of Robbins’s and Balanchine’s Firebird – the only production of this version to exist outside of New York City Ballet.\n\nThe great works of Balanchine continue as a throughline for the season into the spring, in a triple bill that includes Balanchine’s 1957 tour de force Agon, Alonzo King’s Following the Subtle Current Upstream, and the final world premiere of the season, a new work from Brazilian-born choreographer Ricardo Amarante that is sure to “Delight” us all.\n\nAnd finally, we bring you Swan Lake, lovingly reconstructed by Alexei Ratmansky, delivering a striking display of over fifty of our impeccable dancers breathing new life into an enchanting classic.\n\nWhat’s more, all of these incredible works are performed to the glistening sounds of our live Miami City Ballet Orchestra.\n\nWe are so grateful to you, our audiences, for being here with us as we continue to honor our history and uplift new voices. The future of dance is nothing without you.\n\nWith love,\n\nLourdes Lopez\n\nArtistic Director Juan José Escalante\n\nExecutive Director\n\nFIREBIRD\n\nChoreography by Jerome Robbins and George Balanchine\n\nMusic by Igor Stravinsky*\n\nCreative Director Wendall K. Harrington\n\nSets and Costumes Design by Anya Klepikov\n\nLighting Design by James F. Ingalls\n\nScenic Supervision by Michael Best\n\nProjection Programming by Paul Vershbow\n\nSet and Costume Assistants Christina Beam, Calypso Michelet and Sean Sanford\n\nLighting Assistant Brandon Stirling Baker\n\nCostume Construction by Coco DuPont, Euro Co Costumes, Inc., Rodney Gordon, Inc., Marian Jean Hose, Inc., Arnold Levine, Parsons-Meares, LTD., Tricorne, Inc., James Weeden, Eric Winterling, Inc., Miami City Ballet Costume Shop\n\nAlive with color, excitement, and spectacular effects, Firebird is a fantastical and thrilling fairy tale about magic, love, danger and liberation. Prince Ivan, a young hunter, strays into a mystical forest where he encounters the exotic, immortal Firebird who gives him an enchanted feather that will summon her when he is in dire need. When Ivan falls in love with a beautiful Princess who is under the spell of the evil sorcerer Kostchei, he calls the Firebird, and the battle between good and evil is joined…\n\nThe original production, with its ravishing score by the young Igor Stravinsky, was the great sensation of Diaghilev’s 1910 Ballets Russes season, and Balanchine’s 1949 version — which he created for his wife, Maria Tallchief — was New York City Ballet’s first great success. It is that version, later amplified by Jerome Robbins, that MCB is now presenting, with ravishing new costume and scenic designs by, Anya Klepikov and projections by Wendall Harrington, all under the personal supervision of Lourdes Lopez, who danced the Firebird at NYCB for many years. “I grew up in this ballet,” she says. “I was a super, monster, princess, and then the Firebird.”\n\nNow Firebird is reborn yet again, to thrill a new generation of lovers of fairy tales... and of ballet.\n\nMiami City Ballet Premiere on February 14, 2020 at the Adrienne Arsht Center for Performing Arts; Miami, Florida.\n\n* Igor Stravinsky THE FIREBIRD, Suite from the Ballet, 1945 version\n\nUsed by arrangement with European American Music Distributors Company, U.S. and Canadian agent for MCA/Universal Music Publishing Group, publisher and copyright owner.\n\nANÁLOGO\n\nChoreography by Margarita Armas\n\nMusic by Nina Simone, Aukai, Miss Meadow\n\nCostume Design by Spiridonakou\n\nLighting Design by Mark Stanley\n\nForest Scene by Aukai\n\nBy arrangement with Manners McDade Music Publishing Ltd\n\nYou’d Be So Nice To Come To\n\nWritten by Cole Porter\n\nChappell & Co. Inc. (Ascap)\n\nAll Rights Reserved. Used by Permission.\n\nTones of Longing by Miss Meadow\n\nWritten by Daniel Jarl\n\nBy arrangement with Silent Beat Records\n\nPAGANINI, IN PLAY\n\nChoreography by Durante Verzola\n\nMusic by Niccolò Paganini\n\nCostume Design by Martha Chamberlain\n\nLighting Design by Mark Stanley\n\nPAGANINI, In Play is Durante Verzola's fourth work for Miami City Ballet. Verzola has taken inspiration from the virtuosity, passion, elegance, power, romance, and whimsy of the music.\n\nVerzola has chosen selections from two Paganini string quartets, String Quartet No. 3 in A Minor (composed 1815-18) and String Quartet No. 2 in E-Flat Major (composed 1815). Both pieces of music show Paganini's mastery of the string instruments and range in making music. The string quartet musicians are present on stage to serve as a reminder of where the life force and impetus for the ballet comes from. As the dancers progress through lush movement and technically challenging steps, Verzola hopes to demonstrate the playfulness between themselves and the musicians, themselves and the music, the instruments, as well as with one another.\n\nMartha Chamberlain's original costumes add to the richness and regality of the work. As a graduate of Miami City Ballet School, and a current faculty member, Verzola knows the unique dynamism and energy of the MCB dancers. He hopes to show these qualities in a pure dance work full of life and vitality.\n\nCONCERTO DSCH\n\nChoreography by Alexei Ratmansky\n\nMusic by Dmitri Shostakovich*\n\nStaged by Amar Ramasar\n\nCostume Design by Holly Hynes\n\nLighting Design by Mark Stanley\n\nHaving premiered two recent major ballets by Alexei Ratmansky, the world’s leading classical choreographer – Symphonic Dances and The Fairy’s Kiss – MCB now presents one of his most acclaimed earlier works. Concerto DSCH (the initials reflect the German spelling of Dmitri Shostakovich, its composer) is a seething rush of energy, lyricism, and brilliant classical invention overlain with a contemporary sparkle and bounce. At its premiere in 2008, Alastair Macaulay wrote in The New York Times: “Its dances pour forth in a continuous stream of galvanizing excitement and affectionate intimacy...The most captivating classical ballet I have seen in years.”\n\nMiami City Ballet Premiere: April 6, 2018 at Kravis Center; West Palm Beach, FL.\n\n*Concerto for Piano No. 2, Op. 102 in F major by Dmitri Shostakovich presented under license from G. Schirmer Inc. and Associated Music Publishers, copyright owners."
