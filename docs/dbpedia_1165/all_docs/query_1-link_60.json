        "text": "As a historically white-led organization, we know that ALT has benefited from a position of white privilege and that we must work more intentionally towards becoming a truly anti-racist and inclusive organization.\n\nIn 2019, we embarked on an evaluation of ALT’s programs, and compared participation in the Composer Librettist Development Program (CLDP) to other initiatives across the country that provide varying levels of support to opera writers and the new works development process. One consistent finding was that the participants in all of these programs do not reflect the diversity of contemporary American society, and the diversity we desire to see writing for the opera stage. Less than 20% of applicants for the CLDP, and only 34% of those who have participated in the program, have been BIPOC artists.\n\nOur research showed that across the country, other programs that offer some sort of training or residencies for operatic writers fare even worse, with BIPOC artists representing 9% to 12% of participants. Furthermore, in 2019, OPERA America records indicated that of 153 new operas that received professional premieres in the United States over the previous 5 seasons, less than one quarter were written by a BIPOC composer and/or librettist."
