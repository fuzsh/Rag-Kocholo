        "text": "A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region.\n\nOpera\n\n''LA BOHÈME,'' New York City Opera. James Robinson's new production of this Puccini classic moves the action to 1914, and the specter of World War I looms over it. There are some problems with that approach, but for the most part it does little violence to ''La Bohème,'' and some of Mr. Robinson's touches work better than the tried and true moves of more traditional stagings. The cast is young and vocally strong, and those in the principal roles are promising newcomers to the company. They are Rolando Villazon as Rodolfo, Alfredo Daza as Marcello, Maria Kanyova as Mimi and Nicole Heaston as Musetta. George Manahan conducts. Tonight at 8 and Sunday at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $25 to $98 (Allan Kozinn).\n\n''LA BOHÈME,'' Metropolitan Opera. Franco Zeffirelli's hyperdetailed, cinematic staging of this Puccini classic has been a staple of the Met repertory since 1981, and it is back with a cast of young singers that includes Miriam Gauci as Mimi, Ainhoa Arteta as Musetta, Frank Lopardo as Rodolfo and Gerald Finley as Marcello. Steven Crawford is the conductor. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera, (212) 362-6000. Only standing-room tickets remain at $12 and $16 (Kozinn).\n\n''NABUCCO,'' Metropolitan Opera. Verdi's ''Nabucco'' is back at the Met in a much-awaited new production. (The only previous production was in 1960-61.) Musically, the performance is distinguished. James Levine draws lithe, crisp playing from the orchestra and rich, full singing from the chorus. And the cast is essentially strong. Though his voice was patchy on opening night, Juan Pons brings nobility to the biblical King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia. Andrea Gruber replaces Maria Guleghina in the role of Abigaille. Samuel Ramey is in splendid voice as the Hebrew high priest, Zaccaria. Though Elijah Moshinsky's production tries for old-fashioned operatic grandeur and pulls off some dramatic stage effects (a Hebrew temple that goes up in flame), the staging is rather static and clunky. John Napier's set is essentially a huge rotating contraption depicting the brownish stone temples of Jerusalem on one side and the blackish bronze temples of Babylonia on the other. Still, you will get swept away by the performance. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000. Sold out; no standing-room tickets, but returns may be available (Anthony Tommasini).\n\n''RIGOLETTO,'' New York City Opera. Having fought off a lingering cold that forced him offstage in midperformance last week, Mark Delavan is to return to sing Rigoletto tomorrow. This is a pleasant production, capably sung by young singers who might do even better in a slightly smaller theater. The director, Rhoda Levine, keeps the action moving, even if she spells out things like Monterone's dishonored daughter or Gilda's death, both of which are usually left offstage. John Conklin's modern set flats manage to evoke at once Italian Renaissance and Futurism. Tomorrow night at 8, New York State Theater, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $25 to $92 (Anne Midgette).\n\n''DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE,'' Metropolitan Opera. Mozart's allegorical look at coming of age (by way of Masonic ritual) is back at the Met in the production by John Cox first seen at the house in 1991. Its charms are many, and not least among them are the storybook sets and brightly hued costumes by David Hockney. The cast includes Michael Schade as Tamino, Hei-Kyung Hong as Pamina, Simon Keenlyside as Papageno and Mary Dunleavy as the Queen of the Night. Sebastian Weigle is the conductor. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000. Only standing-room tickets at $12 and $16 (Kozinn).\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
