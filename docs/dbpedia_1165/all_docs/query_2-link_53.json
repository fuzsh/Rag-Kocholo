        "text": "Lyric Opera of Chicago is one of the world's great opera companies. It is renowned internationally for its artistic excellence. Founded in 1954, Lyric has always distinguished itself by presenting the finest international singers, conductors, directors, and designers in classic and less-familiar operatic repertoire and in world-premiere productions.\n\nAdditionally, Lyric is leading the advancement of opera in America—continually advancing artistic excellence, increasing relevance and reach for both traditional and new audiences, engaging our diverse communities through signature learning and exploration initiatives, and expanding our role as a cultural cornerstone in Chicago.\n\nIn the twenty-first century, Lyric Opera of Chicago is committed to redefining what it means to experience great opera. The company is driven to deliver consistently excellent artistry through innovative, relevant, celebratory programming that engages and energizes new and established audiences.\n\nUnder the leadership of Freud, Davis, Mazzola, and Fleming, Lyric is dedicated to reflecting and drawing strength from the diversity of Chicago. Through innovation, collaboration, and evolving learning opportunities, Lyric offers ever-more exciting, accessible, and thought-provoking audience and community experiences. We also stand committed to training the artists of the future, through The Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Opera Center; and to becoming increasingly diverse across our audiences, staff, programming, and artists—magnifying the welcoming pull of our art form, our company, and our city.\n\nTo keep opera a must-see, must-hear experience, the art form needs outstanding artists who can convey through singing and acting the emotional range and engaging storytelling that are opera's hallmarks. Lyric, through The Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Opera Center, identifies exceptionally talented emerging artists from around the world and provides them with comprehensive training and performance opportunities. On the world's stages, the Ryan Opera Center's impressive roster of alumni continually proves the value of training at Lyric. The program is administered by Dan Novak, director; Craig Terry, music director; Julia Faulkner, director of vocal studies; and Renée Fleming, advisor.\n\nEstablished in 1974 as the professional artist-development program for Lyric Opera of Chicago, the Ryan Opera Center has been recognized as one of the premier programs of its kind in the world for more than four decades. That standing is maintained by providing the finest up-and-coming singers and pianists with unparalleled training and experience.\n\nThe Civic Opera Building, at 20 North Wacker Drive on the east bank of the Chicago River between Washington and Madison streets, is the permanent home of Lyric Opera of Chicago. The elegantly spacious theater is second only to New York's Metropolitan Opera as the largest opera auditorium in North America. During the latter months of 2020 new seating has been installed, with improved accessibility, sightlines, and ergonomics.\n\nLyric Opera purchased the Civic Opera House (now known as the Lyric Opera House) and adjacent backstage spaces from the building's owner in 1993, the first time in the history of the opera house (built in 1929) that the resident opera company has actually owned the space. Lyric simultaneously launched a $100-million capital campaign: \"Building on Greatness...An Opera House for the 21st Century,\" to finance the purchase and renovation of the art-deco house. The renovation was completed in time for the 1996/97 Season. In 1996 the Civic Opera House auditorium was named the Ardis Krainik Theatre for Lyric's second general director.\n\nIn 1989 Lyric Opera of Chicago launched its “Toward the 21st Century” artistic initiative—the most important artistic initiative the company had undertaken to date, and one with a far-reaching impact on American opera in North America as well as in the international opera community. Throughout the 1990s Lyric produced one 20th-century European and one 20th-century American opera each season as part of the regular subscription series.\n\nWithin this initiative Lyric commissioned three new works: William Bolcom’s McTeague (1992-93); Anthony Davis’s Amistad (1997-98); and Bolcom’s A View from the Bridge (1999-00).\n\nAmong other major artistic achievements was Lyric's first presentation of Wagner's Ring cycle in a single season within the span of a week, following the 1995/96 Season. Sold out months in advance, the three cycles had a total economic impact of $34.7 million on the Chicago metropolitan area. The Ring again sold out when remounted for three cycles during the 2004/05 Season.\n\nLyric introduced the first three operas of a new Ring cycle production 2016-19, and was poised to present the final opera followed by three full cycles in April 2020. Because of the global pandemic, Lyric was forced to cancel final rehearsals for those performances in mid-March."
