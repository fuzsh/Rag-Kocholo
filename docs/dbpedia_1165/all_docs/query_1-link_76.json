But most of all he loved to hold it open in the house.\n\nIn fact, Harrison was the only child on his block to hold an open umbrella in his hand all the time. How his friends admired him!Â\n\nThen one rainy day, after the rain was over, all the children held umbrellas, and they, too, continued to hold the umbrellas open. They all found them useful in the sun, helpful in the snow, and loved them in the house.Â\n\nComplications? Of course! But thatâs all part of the story."
