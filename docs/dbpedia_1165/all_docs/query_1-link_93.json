        "text": "NEW YORK -- 'Medea,' the last new production of the New York City Opera season, is a tasteful, well-sung performance of Cherubini's masterpiece, marked more by elegance than passion.\n\nThe title role fits the opulent singing talents of Grace Bumbry like a glove, from the rich chest tones to the savage power of her top notes. Her vocal production may not be the smoothest these days, but she remains an exciting and, at times, spectacular artist.\n\nRhoda Levine, the director, has provided a highly stylized production with ritualistic movement of principles and chorus that adds to the unrelenting gloom that shrouds this tragedy set in ancient Corinth. John Conklin's black backdrop with a portal that looks onto infinity, a few steps, and a circular stone arena dominated by a shattered bust of Aphrodite serves the action perfectly.\n\nMiss Levine was not able to draw from Miss Bumbry an in-depth characterization of a woman driven to madness and murder of her two sons by the infidelity of her husband. Miss Bumbry went through the motions, but it was always play-acting. Maria Callas remains the only singer of our time to have made the role of Medea completely her own.\n\nJames Wagner, in the role of Jason, didn't even bother to attempt a characterization. He stood around and sang in a very pleasant, light tenor, never reacting to the violent emotions implicit in the drama. He came to life only when taking curtain calls.\n\nMore effective was bass Boris Martinovich as Creon, who made a dignified and handsome monarch and sang with style and conviction. Soprano Rita Shane was a plausible Glauce, but mezzo soprano Diane Curry took the honors for splendid singing and acting in the supporting role of Neris.\n\nConductor Klaus Weise made his debut with the company at the first performance of 'Medea' April 18 and made a fine impression with a vigorous and detailed reading of the pulsing score which served as a model for Beethoven's 'Fidelio.'\n\nIt would have been rewarding to have heard the opera in its original French, rather than in the usual Italian translation. This cast's Italian was so badly enunciated, with the exception of Miss Bumbry, that they might have well been singing in Swahili. --\n\nThe 'Medea' revival followed on the heels of the April 15 English language production of Offenbach's 'The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein,' directed by Jack Hofsiss, better known for his effectual staging of 'The Elephant Man' on Broadway. Hofsiss bent over backward to turn this silly libretto into a witty show but was only able to come up with unfunny, sledgehammer visual gags, often more campy than cute.\n\nMuriel Costa-Greenspon made a blousy and frantic Grand Duchess who sang carelessly except for a charmingly rendered 'Dites-lui qu'on l'a remarque distingue,' which she inexplicably sang in French. Henry Price, the object of her determined affections, seemed out of touch with the zany goings-on, and Leigh Murno, the object of his affections, made a pale soubrette.\n\nJack Harrold, William Ledbetter, Jonathan Green, Claude Corbeil, and James Billings worked hard to get a few laughs from an audience that grew listless after the first act in spite of the champagne score conducted doggedly by Offenbach specialist Antonio de Almeida.\n\nJohn Conklin's stage-on-a-stage setting worked well and his deliciously fussy costumes poked fun at the spike-helmeted Germany military attire of the Bismarck period. But this light opera spoof of the military is a battle lost for the City Opera.\n\nMeanwhile at Carnegie Hall, Eve Queler's Opera Orchestra of America scored another in a long series of triumphs by performing the American premiere of Boito's 'Nerone' in concert version on April 12. This is the blockbuster that Boito, the famous librettist and composer of 'Mefistofele', labored on throughout his career, never completed and died without hearing. His friend Toscanini arranged its first production in Rome in 1924.\n\nThe vast settings required for the confrontation of Nero and the early Christians (including the burning of Rome) would be too expensive for any opera house to mount today and the opera, with some long arid passages, probably is not a great enough work to stage anyway. But 'Nerone' does pack considerable Wagnerian drama, and a generally brilliant cast made the concert one of the delights of the music season.\n\nKlara Takacs, an attractive contralto from Budapest, made an auspicious American debut in the role of the Christian maiden, Rubria, and her vocal grandeur, richly textured, riveted the audience. The good news is that she will be singing at the Metropolitan Opera soon. Mexican soprano Rosario Andrade also made her American debut as Asteria, Boito's Kundry, and displayed a lovely, open voice with strong top notes.\n\nHeading the male contingent were Yugolavian tenor Krunoslav Cigoj, making his New York debut as Nerone, and James Morris and Pablo Elvira of the Metropolitan Opera. Cigoj is a mature artist with a powerful voice and he projected an intense emotional involvement in his role. Morris sang the key role of the pagan sorcerer, Simon Mago, sturdily but coolly, while Elvira seemed tentative in his approach to the role of Fanuel, the Christian leader.\n\nMiss Queler conducted this massive work with her usual competence in drawing from her musicians all the poetry and color in Boito's score. 'Nerone' is the last of the Opera Orchestra's three productions this season. Next season it will perform Donizetti's 'Il Duca d'Alba,' Richard Strauss' 'Guntram,' and Berlioz' 'Benvenuto Cellini.'"
