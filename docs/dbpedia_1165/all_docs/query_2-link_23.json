        "text": "A selective listing by Times critics of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the Northeast.\n\nOpera\n\nGLIMMERGLASS OPERA. Every summer opera lovers and the operatically curious go to Cooperstown, N.Y., to enjoy the offerings of the innovative Glimmerglass Opera festival. It's a long drive from New York City, about four hours, but well worth the trip. The 900-seat Alice Busch Theater is an ideal opera house with its large stage, intimate hall, airy ambience and excellent acoustics. This weekend hardy opera buffs can see all four new productions. Tonight brings the American composer Robert Kurka's satirical 1957 antiwar opera, ''The Good Solder Schweik,'' about a conscript who fakes feeblemindedness to bamboozle his officers. The tenor Anthony Dean Griffey, best known to New York City Opera and Glimmerglass audiences for his devastating portrayal of Lennie in Carlisle Floyd's ''Of Mice and Men,'' sings the title role. Rhoda Levine directs and Stewart Robertson conducts. Tomorrow afternoon offers Offenbach's ''Barbe-Bleue,'' performed here in English translation as ''Bluebeard,'' a satirical take on the grim medieval story that is about as far removed as possible from Bartok's bleak opera on the same subject. The production by the often outrageous director Christopher Alden features Tracey Welborn as Bluebeard and Phyllis Pancella as the libidinous Boulotte. Gerald Steichen conducts. In the evening you can take in the director Francisco Negrin's production of Mozart's ''Don Giovanni,'' which offers the Danish baritone Palle Knudsen in the title role and Stewart Robertson conducting. And Sunday's matinee will be Handel's ''Orlando,'' a brilliant rendering of Ariosto's tale of love and madness featuring the countertenor Bejun Mehta in the title role. Bernard Labadie conducts. ''The Good Soldier Schweik,'' tonight at 8; ''Barbe-Bleue,'' tomorrow at 1:30 p.m.; ''Don Giovanni,'' tomorrow at 8 p.m.; ''Orlando,'' Sunday at 2 p.m. Glimmerglass Opera, Alice Busch Theater, on Route 80 eight miles north of Cooperstown, N.Y. Single tickets: $56 to $104. Information and tickets: (607) 547-2255 (Anthony Tommasini).\n\nClassical Music\n\nASTON MAGNA FESTIVAL. The early-music scene in the Northeast has long shuttled between New York and Boston, and what better middle ground is there in the summer than the Berkshire foothills? This annual fixture concludes its 31st season with performances of all six of Bach's ''Brandenburg'' Concertos. The violinist Daniel Stepner, the festival's artistic director, leads a period-instrument ensemble, including the harpsichordist John Gibbons and the flutist Chris Krueger. Tomorrow night at 5:30, St. James Church, off Main Street, Great Barrington, Mass., (413) 528-3595 or (800) 875-7156. Tickets: $25 at the door; in advance, $22.50; students and 65+, $20, available only at the door. The program is also to be presented tonight at 8 at Bard College, Route 9G, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845) 758-7425. Tickets: $20; students and 62+, $15 (James R. Oestreich).\n\nBARD SUMMERSCAPE. This festival at Bard's recently opened Fisher Center for the Performing Arts, designed by Frank Gehry, focuses this year on the world of the Czech composer Leos Janacek. For its second weekend, the festival presents the final two performances of the first American production of Janacek's seldom heard opera ''Osud'' (''Fate''), directed by JoAnne Akalaitis with sets by Mr. Gehry. Leon Botstein leads the American Symphony Orchestra and a cast that includes Michael Hendrick, Christine Abraham and Linda Roark-Strummer. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sosnoff Theater, Fisher Center, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845) 758-7900. Tickets: $35 to $65, students and children $15 off, 62+ $4 off. Also this weekend: ''Don Juan in Prague,'' a staged adaptation of Mozart's ''Don Giovanni,'' directed by David Chambers with electronics and music arranged by Matthew Suttor for the New York string quartet Ethel. Tomorrow at 4 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. Sold out, but returns may be available (Jeremy Eichler)."
