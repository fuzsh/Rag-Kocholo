        "text": "Dear Carly,\n\nGreetings from the fall in the HV on the last day of September!\n\nFirst and foremost, I hope this message finds you safe and well, in particular those affected by hurricanes Ian and Fiona. We are thinking of you here in Annandale.\n\nI am just back from a trip to California where we had a lovely meet-up of Bardians in the Bay Area at Tacolicious. Thank you to everyone who came out, and thank you to my co-host, Bill Stavru '87.\n\nI never ceased to be amazed at what Bardians are doing. In California I met alumni/ae working for NASA, building drones that sail in the sea, working for Paramount and Disney, going to medical school, training to be a doula, working in tech (lots, no surprise in San Francisco), supplying the raw ingredients for vitamins and supplements, playing in classical ensembles while working in tech, working in disaster risk management and XXXXXX. So many Bardians in California now—keep an eye out for news of regional affinity groups Bard in LA and Bardians in the Bay Area. I look forward to coming back in the spring.\n\nAnd just after I came back at dawn from CA I headed off to attend a preview, at the new Stissing Center in Pine Plains, of the upcoming documentary, The Uncommon Woman, about the pioneering writer, director, and choreographer Rhoda Levine '53. The event included excerpts from the film, including one with Rhoda and classmate Sherman Yellen '53, and musical performances by Bard Conservatory students and students in Bard's graduate music programs. Joan Tower (Rhoda's best friend) was a co-host and curated the music selections which ranged from her own compositions to Bizet to songs from the X:The Life and Times of Malcolm X, which was first directed by Rhoda in 1986. It was a fantastic evening, and Rhoda Levine is certainly someone of whom we are Bardian and Proud.\n\nFamily and Alumni/ae Weekend is coming up fast, October 21st-23rd. There are classes, nature tours, alumni/ae tours, concerts, discussions, exhibits, apple tastings and the launch of Eden Revisited by László Bitó '60. The Studio Arts Department Fund for Visual Learning will run an auction of faculty, student, and alumni/ae works. (Stay tuned, some high-profile Bard artists are donating their work. Just saying…)\n\nAnd…as the sun goes down, I will be leading \"Spirits of Annandale\", an interactive tour of the Bard Cemetery led by me and my friend, Bard Archivist Helene Tieger '85. I hope you can come.\n\nWXBC is turning 75! Seventy-five years of Bard radio. If you haven't been listening, it's online and easy. I love joining the chat, finding out about new music, and hearing what's new on campus. Sign up HERE.\n\nAnd… Tamar Faggen '23, the General Director of WXBC, is doing her Senior Project on WXBC and would love to hear from alumni/ae who were involved with the station. Please email her and look out for anniversary celebrations on November 22nd.\n\nThe upcoming Hannah Arendt Conference, Rage and Reason: Democracy Under the Tyranny of Social Media, on October 13th and 14th, will be in person and live-streamed. Act fast, the deadline to register is tomorrow!\n\nDid you get the most recent Bardian? Please let me know if you didn't. It is online here. We are asking for Class Notes for the next one—the deadline is October 7th. You can submit them online here.\n\nOK, that's it from me. Please stay in touch. Join an affinity group, follow us on social @bardalumni and sign up to the Bard Alumni/ae LinkedIn page for job postings, or just email me with any thoughts or ideas you have.\n\nBe seeing you,\n\nJane Brien '89\n\nP.S. Reunion 2023 will be here before you know it. May 26th-28th. All 3s and 8s—it's your turn. We want you to come back, to join your class committee, and to support your class gift to the Alumni/ae Reunion Scholarship, which helps the next generation of Bardians. Thank you!"
