        "text": "Did you know that Switzerland has 26 official cantons? It’s more than we were expecting when we learnt this! These 26 Swiss cantons are all fully set up with their own independence, administration and power since – which make up total member states of the Swiss Confederation since 1979.\n\nWhat is a canton?\n\nA canton in Switzerland is a subdivision such as a state (like in the US), where they for example manage their own local laws, healthcare and taxes. For example, when you are working and living in Ticino canton in the South, you will be paying different tax rates to those who live and work in Zurich canton.\n\nEach canton also manages their own education, law enforcement and social welfare. As you may know, there are also different official languages based on what canton you are in. They have their own dialect, but also usually speaking either German, French or Italian.\n\nNoun: Canton\n\n1. a subdivision of a country established for political or administrative purposes.\n\nThe History OF Swiss cantons\n\nWhat started out as 13 sovereign confederate allies in the 16th century, who would fight together to block common enemies, has since grown into 26 independent territories. The first cantons are dating back to the year 1291 when they established official independence, with the local benefit of setting up their own taxes, alliances, laws and so on.\n\nThere are some fantastic books about Switzerland that go in depth about the history for those interested.\n\nThe Purpose OF A Canton These days?\n\nUltimately there are of course many different actions that a canton can do which are important. To highlight a few of these are:\n\nManage all car related matters\n\nControl the unemployment rates and assist when you are looking for a new job\n\nProcesses the local taxes based on the taxation of that specific canton\n\nManages the Switzerland social security\n\nRun the Cantonal Migration Office when receiving a Swiss residence permit.\n\nManages the military national service\n\nFun Fact: Did you know the Swiss flag is actually square? Check here why!\n\nTHE LIST OF 26 SWISS CANTONS\n\nThe full list of all 26 Switzerland cantons can be found below:\n\nAargau (AG)\n\nAppenzell Ausserrhoden (AR)\n\nAppenzell Innerrhoden (AI)\n\nBasel-Landschaft (BL)\n\nBasel-Stadt (BS)\n\nBern/Berne (BE)\n\nFribourg (FR)\n\nGenève (GE)\n\nGlarus (GL)\n\nGrisons (GR)\n\nJura (JU)\n\nLuzern (LU)\n\nNeuchâtel (NE)\n\nNidwalden (NW)\n\nObwalden (OW)\n\nSt. Gallen (SG)\n\nSchaffhausen (SH)\n\nSchwyz (SZ)\n\nSolothurn (SO)\n\nThurgau (TG)\n\nTicino (TI)\n\nUri (UR)\n\nValais/Wallis (VS)\n\nVaud (VD)\n\nZug (ZG)\n\nZürich (ZH)\n\nCurious of some specific posts based on the cantons?
