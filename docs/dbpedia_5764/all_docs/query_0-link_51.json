On 1 January 2010 the municipality of Untersteckholz merged into the Langenthal. Langenthal is an academic, cultural, and financial center for the vicinity of Oberaargau. Archeological proof suggests that early settlements existed around 4000 B.C. Inside the Langenthal region. A Hallstatt necropolis with twelve grave mounds has been determined at Unterhard. Remnants of two Roman villae have also been recognized.\n\nLangenthal is first referred to in 861, as marcha in Langatun, relating to farming estates scattered along the Langete a tributary of the Murg. The Old High German call Langatun is possibly composed of a hydronym langa- and the Gaulish element dunum \"citadel\" which had grow to be effective as a suffix in toponyms. The re-interpretation of the call as inclusive of the detail -tal \"valley\" dates. The 15th century, at some point of which the name is on report as either Langaten or Langental the same procedure may be determined in the case of Murgenthal, earlier Murgatun."
