        "text": "We know that the Swiss country is made of cantons. But just how many of them are there? And what does being a canton even mean?\n\nWhat Is a Canton?\n\nHistorically, each canton had its own army and money. That changed in 1848 when Switzerland came out of civil war and switched to the federal structure it has now. This means that each canton now has its own government, laws, and constitution. There are 20 cantons and six half cantons in this country. The difference between half cantons and full cantons lies in the belonging seats inside the Council of States. Half cantons only get one, while normal cantons get two seats.\n\n26 Swiss Cantons\n\n1.
