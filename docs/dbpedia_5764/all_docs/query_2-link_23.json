        "text": "In general, tipping painters in Langenthal is not expected or required in most cases. Painters are typically paid by the company they work for, and their fees cover their services. However, there may be exceptions depending on your location or personal preference. It’s a good idea to ask the painting company about their tipping policy before starting the job.\n\nIf you choose to tip, it’s best to give the tip directly to the individual painters instead of the company owner.\n\nWhen it comes to the amount of tipping, it is typically about 10% of the project cost. Alternatively, you can show appreciation by offering food and drinks during the project or leaving positive reviews and recommendations for the painting company.\n\nUltimately, tipping is not mandatory but can be a nice gesture for exceptional service or to show gratitude."
