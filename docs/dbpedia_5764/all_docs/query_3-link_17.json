        "text": "The Swiss Confederation is a sovereign state in western-central Europe. It has a population of about 8.4 million and its capital city is Bern. Switzerland is made up of 26 cantons each with its own government, legislature, constitution, and judicial system. Most of the cantons have unicameral parliaments with members varying from between 58 and 200. Depending on the canton, the cantonal government can either have five or seven members. The federal constitution of Switzerland recognizes the sovereignty of the cantons. The cantonal governments are responsible for welfare, healthcare, public education, law enforcement, and taxation. Each canton has several municipalities and the cantonal constitution awards a degree of autonomy to each municipality that includes the power to pass municipal laws and levy taxes. The cantons vary in size and population.\n\nThe Cantons Of Switzerland\n\nZurich\n\nThe canton of Zurich is the largest with a population of 1.5 million people. It is divided into 12 districts and 165 municipalities. There are 180 members in the cantonal council who are elected after every four years. The executive consists of seven members elected to serve a term of 4 years. The city of Zurich is the capital of the canton while German is the official language. Manufacturing is the canton’s primary economic activity although a large portion of the land is under agriculture.\n\nBern\n\nThe canton of Bern is the second largest by population and surface area.

The capital city Lausanne is the pivot of the canton’s economy, it hosts several manufacturing and processing industries. However, the canton is known for the production of white wine. The agricultural land is covered by vast vineyards especially along the shores of Lake Geneva.\n\nHistory Of The Canton System\n\nIn the early thirteenth century, three cantons merged and formed a single political and economic unit but maintained their autonomy. Between 1353 and 1481, the cantons had increased to eight. Between 1513 and 1798, the number had increased to 13 to form the Thirteen-Canton Confederation. By the time they Swiss federal state was formed in 1848, the cantons had increased to 25. In 1979, the canton of Jura seceded from the canton of Bern to bring the total tally 26."
