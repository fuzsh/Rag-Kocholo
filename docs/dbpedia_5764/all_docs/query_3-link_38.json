The solid line of mansions looks down on the Aare river which is full of boating possibilities. Its banks are home to the famous Bern Bears in an impressive natural environment – a much-needed change from the traditional Bear Pits.\n\nBernese Oberland mountains plunge down into valleys carved out by retreating glaciers, waterfalls roar down-solid cliffs and deep blue-green water glistens in the alpine lakes. This area is often the reason why people flock to Switzerland. There is definitely jaw-dropping scenery here (which can add to the jaw-dropping prices) but there is also plenty of opportunities to try new things and, if you are willing to do a bit of exploring to find a few hidden corners, away from the tour groups.\n\nOescheninsee – Draws you in like a magnet. Discover snow-shoeing, skiing and winter walking around the lake (also, on the lake – if it is cold enough), using Kandersteg as a starting point.\n\nOeschinensee\n\nThere is plenty to do in and around this stunning Lake. See below for details.\n\nLive webcam of Lake\n\nIdeas for visiting the historical old town of Bern\n\nThe old city centre of Bern has been classed as a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\nThe city of Bern was built in the 12th Century on a hillside surrounded by the Aare River. The town was developed with a special design made up of long rows of buildings, shaped to fit into the curve of the river. 15th-century arcades and 16th-century fountains were added and, in the 18th Century, most of the medieval centre was restored but, luckily, it has retained its original character which includes the many elegant arches that can be found throughout.\n\nMap from 1864\n\nZytglogge (Clock Tower)\n\nThis iconic clock tower has been around for centuries and has had many uses, including a prison.\n\nEvery hour, on the hour, there is a display of dancing bears, a court jester and a rooster doing their thing on the outside of the clock tower.\n\nThe inside isn’t open for individual visits but it’s possible to do a 1-hour tour inside to see the inner workings and learn about its past. The public tours don’t run daily and are limited to once a week in winter, so it pays to check out the website and book before going. Good to Know: There are 130 steps to the top but you are rewarded with a view of Bern’s old town, and the Alps (weather permitting).\n\nArcades and Arches\n\nThe old town of Bern has the longest covered shopping arcade in Europe which includes many covered or enclosed arcades in the side streets and alleyways.\n\nThis is a good place to visit for a rainy day shopping spree with plenty of quirky, boutique and specialty shops to get lost in. Often cafes and restaurants offer seating in the arcade area – some include blankets on the chairs in the winter.\n\nWaisenhausplatz Market\n\nWaisenhausplatz is a few minutes walk from the train station, in the old town. In 2018 this busy street was completely transformed into a large pedestrian space. During the summer of 2018, the city’s urban greenery and civil engineering department decided to add various elements to the square as part of a trial project. Outdoor furniture, plants, a double-decker terrace, a stage and outdoor games were added. The idea came from a custom used in Mexican cities called Zócalo where the locals get together in large squares around the city to socialise, play games, eat, drink, dance and learn new skills.\n\nThe project was well received and the plan was to continue using the Plaza in this way each summer.\n\nIn the colder months, you will find flea markets and the Christmas market in this space. The above market was set up in November with plenty of woolly hats and gloves for sale – and of course, some hammocks…\n\nBernese Flea Markets\n\nBern has a great selection of urban Flea Markets – both inside halls, in arcades and out on the streets. They offer vintage gear, modern, clothes, culinary treats, seasonal clothing – so the normal stuff for a flea market. For more information go to the Bern Tourism page dedicated to both the buyers and the sellers.\n\nGood to know: Bears have been kept in Bern since 1513. The banks of the Aare River have been their home since 1857 when they were moved from the city to Bear Pits. Lucky for the bears, a large park was created for them in 2009 – a much-needed change that means the bears have part of the river banks to themselves as well as green spaces with trees – designed on several levels leading down to the river. They hunt for their own food and hibernate in caves. You can see them from the Nydegg Bridge (at the end of the old town) or parts of the park. For more information and webcams go to the parks website here.\n\nThe Bernisches Historisches Museum/Einstein Museum\n\nBern was once home to Einstein and is a good place to learn all about this remarkable character. Both his place of residence in the city centre and a part of the Bern Historical Museum are dedicated to showcasing his life. The museum also displays world events large and small that were happening in his lifetime. It’s housed in the lovely Bern Historical Museum.\n\nBern Historical Museum and Einstein Museum (permanent exhibition) cover the following:\n\nThe historical collection with objects dating from the Early Middle Ages to the present day.\n\nSwiss and ancient coins (Greek and Roman) and large collection of oriental coins.\n\nThe archaeological collection of around 200,000 objects. The earliest finds date back approximately 1 million years, while the latest pieces are from the Early Middle Ages.\n\nAn ethnographical collection of around 60,000 objects from all over the world dating from around 4000 BC to today. Many of the objects came from collectors who lived abroad such as James Cook’s painter, John Webber.\n\nA restaurant and bistro open out to the Museum’s gardens.\n\nPermanent exhibitions include Stone Age, Celts & Romans; Cultures in Asia & Oceania and Treasures from the Tombs of Egypt.\n\nAlbert Einstein’s Museum – showing in the video below or on the website\n\nMore information can be found here: https://www.bhm.ch/en\n\nThe Einstein Museum. Here is a little video I found outlining what to expect at the museum.\n\nOr, you could visit the building that was Einstein’s home in Bern for two years – Kramgasse No. 49 – right in the middle of the old town. This building has now been turned into a museum which exhibitions his personal life, biography & life’s work. See this link for details."
