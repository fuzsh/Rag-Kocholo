        "text": "This week on Adventures at Franklin, we're going to be talking about cantons - the geographic regions that make up Switzerland.\n\nIf you're planning to live in Switzerland, it's important to know about the different cantons because each one has varying laws, holidays and even languages.\n\nWhat even is a canton? You might ask. Well, a canton is similar to a state, like those found in countries like the United States and Mexico. However, each Swiss canton has its own constitution that has been federally approved. There are 26 cantons in total, among them several half cantons. Half cantons are cantons that split at some point. They mainly differ from other cantons in that they only send one member to the upper house of parliament, rather than two.\n\nFranklin University Switzerland is located in Ticino, the only canton in Switzerland where Italian is the only official language. Although Italian is spoken in neighboring Graubünden as well, it has four official languages - Swiss German, Italian, and Romansh.\n\nAn overview:\n\nGerman is an official language in 21 cantons\n\nFrench is an official language in 7 cantons\n\nItalian is an official language in 2 cantons\n\nRomansh is an official language in 1 canton\n\nThere are 4 cantons with multiple official languages\n\nTo read more about languages in Switzerland, check out my blog post on the subject.\n\nAnd now, on to learning more about each individual canton.
