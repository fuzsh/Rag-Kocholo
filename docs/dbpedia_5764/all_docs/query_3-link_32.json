        "text": "The Swiss Confederation was founded in 1848. The capital is Bern. Switzerland does not form an ethnic, linguistic or religious entity. Because it is comprised of different cultures that came together of their own free will the term \"Nation by Choice\" (Willensnation|\"Nation par volonté\") is used. Switzerland takes up a neutral position in international politics.\n\nIn Switzerland the cantons and communities have a great deal of independence. This is called federalism. The 26 cantons and over 2000 communities have fully developed state structures. Canton Aargau has its own constitution and government, a parlament, and courts. The cantons and communities are responsible for many public duties. This is why the school systems are built differently in the different cantons. Federal laws apply throughout the country. Cantons have their own laws which apply only within the canton. Even communities can enact own rules. In order to fulfill their duties the cantons and communities as well as the confederation raise taxes.\n\nTo prevent a concentration of power Switzerland has three independent powers: the legislative power, the executive power and the judiciary power. In Canton Bern the following authorities exercise these powers:\n\nLegislative: Grand Council (160 members, elected by the public every four years) The administrative region of the French-speaking Bernese Jura has 12 guaranteed seats in the Grand Council.\n\nExecutive: Cantonal Government (7 members, elected by the public every four years) Bernese Jura has one guaranteed seat.)\n\nJudiciary: Various courts on the levels of the districts and the canton\n\nThe communities also have a legislative power (community assembly or parliament) (Gemeindeversammlung | assemblée communale, Parlament) and an executive power (city council or community council). The national government (7 members) is called the Federal Council (Bundesrat | Conseil fédéral). On the national level there are various courts. The Federal Tribunal is the highest instance where, for example, cantonal rulings can be appealed.\n\nThe Swiss have the right to vote and to stand as candidates. They elect the political bodies on a community, cantonal and federal level and can run as candidates. In addition popular votes are held on political matters on a community, cantonal and federal level (direct democracy). Popular initiatives enable citizens to bring issues that are important to them to vote. Foreigners who live in Canton Bern do not have the right to vote or to run as candidates. However, there are various other ways to be politically active and to address concerns to the authorities:\n\nMembership in a party, in an organization or in an association\n\nParticipation in commissions and other bodies\n\npetitions\n\nLetters to the editor or Internet forums\n\nIn some municipalities there are committees for the participation of migrants. For example, the Forum of Migrants of the city of Bern.\n\nThe fundamental legal principles are documented in the Federal Constitution (Bundesverfassung | Constitution). The fundamental rights which are based on the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) form an important part of the Federal Constitution. They protect human existence (e.g. right to life, right to assistance when in need) and protect individuals from state violence or protect groups from majorities. All people are protected from discrimination on the basis of origin, gender, skin color, age, language, religion, sexual orientation and physical, mental or psychological limitations. This applies regardless of residence status and nationality. Victims of racial discrimination receive free support and advice in Canton Bern. Anyone who is the victim of discrimination can contact the integration services or the specialized offices (gggfon and RBS). Freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press prevail in Switzerland."
