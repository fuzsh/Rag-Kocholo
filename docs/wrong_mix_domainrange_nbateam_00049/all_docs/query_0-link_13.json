        "text": "SoCalHoops High School News\n\nNike Extravaganza Extra: Oak Hill\n\nPlayer Profiles #1--(Feb. 1, 1999)\n\nOak Hill, the No. 1 ranked team in the country, and perhaps the best ever high school team we've seen (really, we mean it, seriously) features 12 players on its current roster. We're going to feature their profiles direct from the Oak Hill 1998-1999 Warrior Basketball Guide, which we picked up from Assistant Coach Sid Finklea at the Reebok Las Vegas Holiday Prep Classic in December. Three profiles per day for the next four days. Here's No. 1 in the series, which features profiles for Steven Blake, Abdou Diame and Orenn Fells.\n\nSteven Blake (6'-3\" Sr. PG)-- Steve is a very cerrebral player who has the ability to make great decisions on the court. He is a point guard that has 3-point range. Steve, an unselfish player, will do whatever it takes on the court to win. His play will be instrumental in how much success the Warriors attain this season. He is an excellent student who carries a 3.3 cumulative GPA. Steve has committed to play next year at the University of Maryland. son of Mr. and Mrs. Richard Blake.\n\nFavorite food: .........................

He is following the same rout Souleymane Camara and Makhtar Ndiaye travelled to get to the Division I level. Abdou will play both forward and center for the Warriors. He has excellent range for a big man and can score.\n\nFavorite food: ......................... Pizza\n\nFavorite TV Show. ....................

His size and athleticism allow him to be an excellent rebounder. He runs the floor well and finishes in transition. He will be counted on to provide depth in the frontcourt this season. Orenn holds a 4.0 GPA. Son of Mr. and Mrs. Ottis Fells.\n\nFavorite food: .........................Lasagna & Fried Chicken\n\nFavorite TV Show. ....................
