        "text": "Alfred A. Ring Distinguished Speaker Series\n\nThe Alfred A. Ring Distinguished Speaker Series brings prominent real estate professionals to campus to speak to and interact with UF real estate students and faculty. These distinguished individuals bring to life the material covered in courses. In addition, speakers share their informed perspectives on real estate career strategies and opportunities.\n\nUpcoming Speaker Schedule\n\nAbout the Ring Speaker Series\n\nAlfred A. Ring, a founder of the real estate program at the University of Florida, made a profound impact on many, as described in this Gainesville Sun article. A number of our Real Estate Advisory Board members were fortunate to be students of Dr. Ring at UF, and their lives attest to the wisdom he so generously shared. In fact, the Ring speaker series is supported by a trust fund established by the (then) North Florida Chapter of the Appraisal Institute, at the recommendation of former students and friends of Dr. Ring.\n\nWe are privileged to continue honoring Dr. Ringâ€™s far-reaching contributions with the Alfred A. Ring Distinguished Speaker Series, which brings prominent industry professionals to campus to speak and interact with UF real estate students and faculty. Ring speakers bring real estate course material to life, and share their informed perspectives on real estate career strategies and opportunities.\n\nYouTube Playlist\n\nPast Speakers"
