        "text": "2.  A graduate of DePaul University, Sanford Mappa currently leads his own financial planning firm in Illinois as president. Over the past 30 years, he has built a successful career as a financial planner, and he holds Certified Financial Planner (CFP) and Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC) certifications. Outside of work, Sanford “Sandy” Mappa enjoys following sports and is a fan of the Chicago Bulls. The third most successful National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise, as of 2015, the Chicago Bulls have existed as an NBA team since 1966 when Dick Klein founded the team after three years of trying. Klein originally attempted to purchase a different team in 1963, but the team moved out of the city.\n\n3.  Over the next several years, he gained local business support and finally received an NBA expansion franchise. Wanting to choose a name that paid tribute to the nearby stockyards, Klein decided on the Chicago Bulls, and a neighbor designed the logo. Although the Chicago Bulls did not start as a top team, the franchise gained recognition after drafting Michael Jordan in the mid-1980s. Jordan led the team to seven straight scoring titles, and the Bulls eventually added to the talent with players like Scottie Pippen. In the 1990s, the team won three consecutive NBA titles. More recently, the Chicago Bulls drafted Derrick Rose after the team won the NBA Draft Lottery."
