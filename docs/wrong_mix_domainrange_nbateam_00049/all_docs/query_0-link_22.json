        "text": "Steve Blake never lost confidence. Not when his shot went AWOL last season. Not when he sat on the bench, watching others take over his minutes on the floor.\n\nBlake, in his own quiet manner, kept believing his situation would improve. He felt that his solid defense and proficient shooting, qualities that had caught General Manager Mitch Kupchak’s eye in the first place, would return this season.\n\nAll it took was one game and a new system.\n\nWith the triangle offense gone, the Lakers have moved to using a more traditional point guard role, a position Blake said he feels “more comfortable with.”\n\nHis comfort level was noticeable Sunday in the Lakers’ close 88-87 season-opening loss to the Chicago Bulls. Blake finished with 12 points on 4-of-9 shooting, including two 3-pointers, and had three rebounds and two assists in 25 minutes behind Derek Fisher.\n\n“I just came out here to play basketball and play the best I can,” Blake said. “I feel really comfortable out here right now. I’m just trying to continue and be consistent.\n\n“So I’m really happy about the season starting.”\n\nBlake said the key is consistency, not just for him, but for the entire team.\n\n“New system, new players, new coach. It’s just a tough way to be 100 percent perfect in the first game, so there is some growth that we can have,” Blake said. “We need to keep pushing and keep practicing.”\n\nRECENT LAKERS NEWS\n\n[rssfeedme cat=”lakers” feedpath=”/category/Lakers/feed/” max=”5″]"
