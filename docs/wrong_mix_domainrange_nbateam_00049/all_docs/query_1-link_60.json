        "text": "Jordan Farmar took a substantial paycut to return to the Lakers. He experienced a season filled with injuries and losing. The Lakers enter this offseason laced with uncertainty on how long it will take to return to championship contention.\n\nYet, Farmar reiterated in unequivocal terms following the Lakers’ 102-90 loss Sunday to the Memphis Grizzlies at Staples Center that he wants to stay with the purple and gold.\n\nOf course, I’d be a Laker,” Farmar said. “And if I was [General Manager] Mitch [Kupchak], I would sign me.”\n\nThe Lakers like Farmar, impressed that he posted 10.3 points and 4.8 assists despite playing in only 39 games because of two separately torn left hamstring and a strained right groin. The Lakers are also impressed with Farmar’s maturity since his first stint here in 2006-10, providing an assertive leadership presence and team-first mindset.\n\nStill, Farmar’s future partly hinges on who the Lakers draft, what free agents they can attract and what kind of offers Farmar fields elsewhere.\n\n“It wouldn’t be ideal but it’s part of our business. We can’t control that,” he said. “I’ll sit down with Mitch and the guys, and see if something can be worked out.”\n\nContinue reading “Jordan Farmar reiterates interest in re-signing with Lakers” »\n\nLakers guard Jordan Farmar plans to get evaluated within the next week after nursing a strained right groin that has sidelined him for the past seven contests.\n\nFarmar received medical clearance on Monday to begin practicing, but he said he needs to increase that workload before jumping into a game. But when that happens remains to be clear considering the Lakers are likely to have off on Thursday following a slate of back to back games vs. Portland (Tuesday) and Sacramento (Wednesday). The Lakers will likely practice on Saturday, but those sessions are usually considered light. Most veterans use that time as well to receive treatment.\n\n“We just have to find time for me to build that endurance,” said Farmar, who reporting completing Monday’s non-contact practice without any setbacks.\n\nThe Lakers have avoided having contact practices because of the injury-laden roster. Farmar said having that won’t deter him from returning.\n\n“I think I can play if I play three on three,” said Farmar, who has averaged 10.4 points and 4.7 assists in 36 games. “If I do some work and get some days in, I’ll be all right. It would be ideal, but whatever. We don’t have much time left to wait around.”\n\nMeanwhile, Lakers coach Mike D’Antoni considers Steve Nash (back) and Xavier Henry (right knee) as game-time decisions Tuesday against Portland. Pau Gasol’s status is listed as probable after missing the past four games because of vertigo.\n\nRELATED:\n\nPau Gasol expresses hope to play alongside Chris Kaman\n\nPau Gasol calls having vertigo “a scary moment for me and my family”\n\nRyan Kelly helps secure free tacos for fans in Lakers’ 125-99 win over Suns\n\nFollow L.A.

E-mail him at mark.medina@langnews.com\n\nMILWAUKEE — The Lakers have discovered the hard way that any slight awkward movement or contact can instantly unravel the never-ending work Steve Nash devotes to heal the nerve irritation in his back and hamstring.\n\nUnsurprisingly, he declared himself out of the Lakers’ two game trip that included a XX win Thursday against the Milwaukee Bucks followed by another game Friday in Minnesota.\n\n“Hopefully in the next week I’ll be able to play,” said Nash, who then joked that he should expedite his timetable so he can play before Jordan Farmar returns from a strained right groin that has sidelined him for the past four games.\n\nFarmar said the Lakers will reevaluate him shortly after returning to the Los Angeles this weekend and could return as early as later next week so that he can practice. But Farmar only has clearance to complete light jogging and shooting drills in what he called a “controlled” setting.\n\nFarmar’s issues are not as serious as Nash, who has only played 11 games this season. But Farmar has missed a combined 34 games because of hamstring and groin injuries that he said are all related.\n\n“Over time, my pelvis has shifted,” Farmar told this newspaper. “It puts a lot of tension on other parts of my body. I’m really focused on what they call a neutral position in taking that load off my body. It’ll put a strain on a hamstring, a quad or a groin.”\n\nIt hasn’t helped that the Lakers have faced countless injuries, particularly to their backcourt in Kobe Bryant (fractured left knee), Nash (back) and Steve Blake (hyperextended right knee), who missed 36 games before being traded last month to Golden State.\n\n“A lot of times people will say to train and just push through fatigue. But if I’m fatigued, I go to my default position,” Farmar said. There’s not a lot of time to figure it out during the season. I have to practice get my wind back, get in shape and I have to get back out there. But I’m not overly concerned about it.”\n\nRELATED:\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar scoffs at LeBron James’ “Mt.

Daily News Lakers beat writer Mark Medina on Twitter and on Facebook. E-mail him at mark.medina@langnews.com\n\nThe Lakers cannot even go through a light practice without suffering another injury.\n\nLakers guard Jordan Farmar will stay sidelined for at least two weeks after an ultrasound and examination shows he has a moderate strain in his right groin. According to that timetable, Farmar would miss at least seven games and would not return until April 1 at the earliest against Portland at Staples Center. Farmar experienced pain during Monday’s practice, which was considered light and didn’t include any full-court, five-on-five drills.\n\n“We were in the middle of a practice and he probably made a misstep,” Lakers coach Mike D’Antoni said. “I don’t think there was any one. He just strained it. I don’t know how he did it.”\n\nD’Antoni sounded more definitive on how he will handle his diminished backcourt entering the Lakers’ (22-44) game Wednesday against the San Antonio Spurs (50-16) at Staples Center. He ruled out playing Steve Nash, who has missed the past 14 games amid persisting nerve irritation in his back and hamstring. Nash told this newspaper last week that he feels physically able to play. But the Lakers want to sit him out both to evaluate young prospects and to prevent Nash’s injury from worsening. Nash is under contract next season for $9.7 million, and the Lakers may avoid waiving him through the so-called stretch provision so his salary becomes completely wiped from the books following the 2014-15 campaign.\n\nSo instead, D’Antoni said he will rely on a flurry of young players, including starting point guard Kendall Marshall, shooting guard Jodie Meeks and small forwards Kent Bazemore and Xavier Henry.\n\n“They’ll all probably play together,” D’Antoni said. “They will have to be able to rely on each other to bring it up and make plays. You have to move the ball and get Pau [Gasol] involved more. He has to be on the floor with those guys.”\n\nFarmar has averaged a solid 10.3 points and 4.7 assists, but he missed a combined 30 games because of two separate tears in his left hamstring.\n\nRELATED:\n\nSteve Nash reflects on Dwight Howard, Kobe Bryant and Princeton offense\n\nJordan Farmar leaves Monday’s practice with strained right groin\n\nLakers coach Mike D’Antoni bearing the brunt of discontent, but he’s not about to stop fighting\n\nFollow L.A. Daily News Lakers beat writer Mark Medina on Twitter and on Facebook. E-mail him at mark.medina@langnews.com\n\nEven with a weekend full of rest and a light Monday practice, the Lakers still cannot avoid suffering injuries.\n\nThe latest ailment involves Lakers guard Jordan Farmar straining his right groin during Monday’s practice. He plans to see a specialist either later this afternoon or Tuesday morning, a visit that will determine both the severity of the injury and how many games he might miss.\n\nPau Gasol missed seven games this season because of a strained right groin, though it’s unclear how much Farmar’s injury mirrors Gasol. Either way, this injury marks the latest bout of frustration for Farmar, who has missed a combined 30 games because two separate tears in his left hamstring.\n\nContinue reading “Jordan Farmar leaves Monday’s practice with strained right groin” »\n\nSAN ANTONIO — Phil Jackson’s about to embark on a journey perhaps far more difficult than stopping Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal from fighting, or ensuring high-volume shooting from Bryant and Michael Jordan don’t hinder team play.\n\nJackson will oversee the New York Knicks front office, trying to restore order in the same way he brought stability through his triangle offense and his Zen-like teachings. Such philosophies coupled with talented rosters ensured Jackson winning a record 11 NBA championships, including five with the Lakers. But how will that translate as an executive in which Jackson has lacked any previous experience?\n\n“I’m happy for him. I’m sure the Knicks organization will benefit from his knowledge and his position,” Lakers forward Pau Gasol said. “It’ll be interesting to see how involved and what kind of decisions he’ll make and what kind of relationship he’ll have with the coaching staff and the players. That’ something I look forward to talking to him so he can explain to me a little bit.”\n\nContinue reading “Pau Gasol, Jordan Farmar gush about Phil Jackson’s role with the New York Knicks” »\n\nThe strain in his left hamstring once kept Jordan Farmar sidelined and then cautious once he returned to the court. Suddenly, Farmar has pushed with plenty of aggressiveness. The head-scratching disappearing act from Kendall Marshall has continued. Luckily, Farmar emerged to camouflage the Lakers’ point guard issues. Farmar once seemed eager to leave the Lakers four years ago, believing Phil Jackson’s triangle offense and a continuous back-up role behind Derek Fisher stunted his growth. Eventually, Farmar sang a different tune on whether his career-high 30 points in the Lakers’ 126-122 win Friday over the Sacramento Kings should warrant him the team’s starting point guard spot.\n\n“I don’t care,” Farmar said. “I don’t care, man. It’s just trying to play good basketball when I’m in there, have fun with whoever is out there on the floor with me.”\n\nContinue reading “Jordan Farmar more worried about helping team than starting” »\n\nThe Lakers have a good chance of getting back three familiar faces on the court in guards Steve Blake, Jordan Farmar and Steve Nash when Los Angeles takes on Minnesota tomorrow.\n\n“I think they are all ready to go, “said Lakers head coach Mike D’Antoni after practice on Monday. “We’ll see how everybody wakes up, but there is a possibility that all three could play.”\n\nBoth Blake and Farmar said they felt good after practice, but would not give a definitive answer when asked if they would be playing tomorrow.\n\n“We’ll see,” said Blake, whose right elbow was wrapped in ice when he addressed reporters. “I felt pretty good today in practice and I’ll see how I feel when I am when I wake up and go from there.”\n\n“I’m not sure about tomorrow, we’ll see,” said Farmar. “I’m available if they allow me too, but I don’t know how they will work it out. Everyone is coming back at the same time so they are just trying to balance things out.”\n\nAll three guards returned to practice earlier in the week.\n\nThe purple and gold backdrop looks the same. The Lakers’ storied championship history hasn’t changed. Plenty of familiar faces at the team’s practice facility in El Segundo are still there, ranging from Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol and various team officials.\n\nBut as Jordan Farmar begins his second stint with the Lakers, one significant thing remains different.\n\nPhil Jackson’s triangle system may have helped the Lakers win five of his 11 NBA championships, including two for Farmar. But he always preferred a much faster-paced style offense, such as Mike D’Antoni’s, to tap into his playmaking instincts.\n\n“I feel like my minutes on the floor, I’ll be able to be more impactful on a personal level,” Farmar said recently in an interview with this newspaper. “While I’m on the floor, I’ll have more responsibility. The ball is going to be in my hand and I’ll be making more decisions and taking more shots and being more aggressive rather than you hit the wing and go in the corner and play off of there. It’s a completely different system.”\n\nContinue reading “Jordan Farmar relishing second stint with Lakers” »"
