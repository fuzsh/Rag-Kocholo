        "text": "- One Addition to Board of Governors and Three to Board of Trustees -\n\nSPRINGFIELD, MASS. – The Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame announced four new board members. Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, Executive Director of the National Basketball Players Association Foundation, was named to the Board of Governors. Executive Chairman of Delano Media Group, Todd Delano; Former NBA Head Coach and Player, Vinny Del Negro; and Thomas Tull, Chairman of the USIT Fund, and Chairman of Tulco Holdings, were named to the Board of Trustees.\n\n“We are very pleased to be adding Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, Todd Delano, Vinny Del Negro, and Thomas Tull as board members,” said Jerry Colangelo, Board Chair of the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame. “Each new member brings unique perspectives which will be invaluable in supporting the Hall of Fame’s mission to promote and preserve the game.”\n\n\"I look forward to working closely with our new Board members,” said John Doleva, President and CEO of the Hall of Fame. \"We have a significant amount of investment coming to the Hall over the next few years, and the Board's input and guidance is critical to the success of our organizational goals.\"\n\nBoard members serve as ambassadors of the Hall while also being responsible for preserving the fundamental mission and financial well-being of the Basketball Hall of Fame. The Board is made up of individuals that work in or have worked in the game, as well as business leaders that have supported the game in Springfield, Mass., or on a national or global level.\n\nA full list of Governors and Trustees for the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame can be found below.\n\nAbout Stephanie Rawlings-Blake:\n\nRawlings-Blake has more than 20 years of public sector experience working with municipal governments in fiscal management, and as a strategic problem solver. Most notably, Rawlings-Blake served as the 49th Mayor of Baltimore from 2010- 2016, leading the city’s operations, including a $2.4 billion budget and over 15,000 employees. Under her leadership as Mayor, Rawlings-Blake presided over key reforms focused on pensions, urban education, health care delivery, public safety, and more. In June 2015, Rawlings-Blake was elected as the 73rd President of the U.S. Conference of Mayors (USCM) and became the first and only black woman to serve in this position. Additionally, Rawlings-Blake has worked on the national stage as Secretary of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and led organizing efforts for the 2016 Democratic Convention in Philadelphia. Most recently, Rawlings-Blake was the President of SRB & Associates, providing advocacy and consulting services to clients, including private and public companies, government officials, research agencies, and more.\n\nAbout Todd Delano:\n\nTodd Delano is a founding member and serves as Executive Chairman of Delano Media Group (DMG). Delano Media Group is the parent company of four distinct companies in the sporting events and marketing industries. He is a serial entrepreneur with a track record of sustained success across multiple industries. Prior to founding DMG, Todd founded ServRx, Inc., a financial technology firm within the healthcare sector. Under his leadership, ServRx was recognized by Inc. 500 as one of the fastest-growing privately held companies in the United States, achieving a three-year growth rate of 1,929%. To date, ServRx is under contract with 1 in 5 pharmacies in the United States, and is quickly approaching 1 billion dollars in prescription claims processed within the Workers’ Compensation pharmacy niche market. Delano Media Group is poised to achieve similar success within the live events and experiences market. The recent 10-year college basketball series agreement with the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame serves as evidence of the direction DMG is heading. Todd and his wife, Carolyn, have three sons: Vincent, Tyson, and Sean. He and Carolyn have a track record of servant leadership with deep roots in community sports and philanthropy. They have invested countless hours in volunteer work. Through the DREAM Foundation, Carolyn and Todd have been financially responsible for over one hundred HBCU students gaining valuable professional access and mentorship at some of the most elevated sporting events in the United States.\n\nAbout Vinny Del Negro:\n\nA common thread runs through whatever Vinny Del Negro has done in his life: with an unwavering belief in himself, relentless effort, and sheer determination, he has exceeded expectations, thrilled fans, and inspired others. A second-round draft pick of late NBA great Bill Russell and the Sacramento Kings in the 1988 NBA Draft, Del Negro went on to enjoy a 14-year playing career, highlighted by a six-season run as a starter with the San Antonio Spurs (1992-98). During his time in San Antonio, where Del Negro averaged 11.2 points and 3.2 assists per game, he helped lead the Spurs to the playoffs on five occasions, including two Midwest Division titles, and was named one of the top 25 players in Spurs history. In 2009, Del Negro was named head coach of the Chicago Bulls and became only the fourth coach in NBA history with no prior coaching experience to lead his team to the playoffs in his first two seasons as an NBA head coach. Del Negro cemented his legacy as a turnaround specialist during his three seasons as head coach of the Los Angeles Clippers, during which time he completely changed the culture to that of a franchise that expected to win games and compete for the NBA title. Off the court, Del Negro has remained committed to improving life in the communities in which he and his family live and repaying the kindness of others who helped form the man he is today. He has been recognized and celebrated for his philanthropy, service, and human spirit. Today, Vinny is an active investor who makes strategic investments in companies and works with executives to counsel, coach, and network.\n\nAbout Thomas Tull:\n\nThomas Tull is Founder, Chairman and CEO of Tulco, LLC, a privately held holding company that partners with companies in under-innovated industries and transforms them using the power of artificial intelligence and data science. Tulco is sector agnostic and its investments include a healthcare apparel company and a world-spanning insurance brokerage. The ability to recognize overlooked opportunities, especially businesses that can be reimagined through technological innovation, has been a common thread throughout Thomas’s career as an entrepreneur, and he has successfully identified and invested in a number of startup and early stage technology companies, including Oculus, Genies, Zoox and Magic Leap, among others. Thomas also infused technology into Legendary Entertainment, which he founded in 2004 and built into one of the most successful film entertainment production companies in the history of Hollywood. Legendary produced a number of blockbusters, including the relaunch of the Batman franchise with The Dark Knight trilogy, Jurassic World, Kong: Skull Island, Godzilla, The Town, Inception, 300, The Hangover franchise, and many others. Thomas’s deployment of sophisticated data analytics changed how movies were marketed and increased the commercial success of Legendary’s films. These innovations have since been widely copied throughout Hollywood. Outside of his investment work, Thomas is an active supporter of philanthropic causes that support education, medical and scientific research and conservation through the Tull Family Foundation. He is a member of the MIT School of Engineering Dean’s Advisory Council, and a trustee of Carnegie Mellon University, Yellowstone Forever, the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum and the Smithsonian Institution. Thomas is also part of the ownership groups of the Pittsburgh Steelers, the six-time Super Bowl champions, and New York Yankees, the 27-times world series champions. He received his undergraduate degree from Hamilton College and resides in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."
