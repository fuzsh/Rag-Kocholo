Jones\n\nTime: Thursday, July 25th, 12:00 PM – 1:00 PM CDT\n\nLocation: Virtual\n\nOrganizers: Chicago Center on Democracy\n\nDescription: Join the Chicago Center on Democracy for a virtual conversation on Dr. James R. Jones’ new book The Last Plantation: Racism and Resistance in the Halls of Congress. Come learn about Dr. Jones’ “revealing look at the covert and institutionalized racism lurking in the congressional workplace,” (Princeton University Press). The conversation will be moderated by Larry Svabek (Political Science, UChicago). About the book: “The Last Plantation” by James Jones explores the pervasive racism within the U.S. Congress, highlighting how it continues to influence lawmaking and employment practices. Despite the civil rights movement and antidiscrimination laws from the 1960s, Congress remained exempt from federal workplace protections for many years, leading to institutionalized inequality. Through extensive research and firsthand accounts from congressional staffers, Jones reveals the entrenched power dynamics and lack of racial representation that hinder the creation of fair legislation. The book centers on the experiences of Black workers, offering insights into the challenges they face and their efforts to overcome systemic barriers. It calls for a reevaluation and transformation of Congress to address and rectify these deep-rooted inequalities, making it essential reading for those interested in social justice and democratic reform.

And yet, claims like this have often been made in contexts where the actual distribution of power is anything but democratic. We invite you to an engaging lecture and discussion on this crucial theme by Professor Cliff Ando, distinguished Professor of History and Classics at the University of Chicago. The lecture draws inspiration from the inherent tension in these claims and prompts an exploration of legal theory juxtaposed with political treatises spanning from antiquity to the nineteenth century. This event is part of a quarterly series of lectures organized by the Democracy Curriculum, co-organized with Classics of Social and Political Thought.\n\nDiscussing Regional Definitions of Democracy\n\nTime: January 31st, 2024, 5:00 pm – 6:30 pm CST\n\nLocation: Social Sciences Research Building, Room 122 (1126 E. 59th St.)\n\nOrganizers: Across the world, various countries are in the process of democratization or actively debating the importance of democratic values. But what do these concepts mean to governments in different regions and how are they negotiated in political discourses? How do their citizens advocate for these concepts in the public sphere and what unique cultural and historical challenges continue to exist for these democratic movements? Join Assistant Professor Eduardo Montero and Distinguished Professor Konstantin Sonin from the Harris School of Public Policy as they discuss the progress and challenges faced by democratic movements in Latin America and the former Soviet states from a comparative perspective. This event will feature a discussion by both professors, followed by a Q&A session from participants.\n\nWorkshop: How to Have Productive Democratic Discourse\n\nTime: January 30th, 2024, 4:30pm – 6:00 pm CST\n\nLocation: Social Science Research Building Tea Room, 1126 E 59th St., Room 201\n\nOrganizers: Chicago Center on Democracy and the Parrhesia Program on Public Discourse\n\nDescription: Please join the Chicago Center on Democracy and the Parrhesia Program on Public Discourse on January 30th, 2024 at 4:30pm, for a skill-building workshop on how to have productive democratic discourse.

We will then put these skills into practice by discussing a topic that often generates diverse views: namely, the question of how social media companies should moderate or censor speech that may be legally protected but is hateful or disingenuous in nature.\n\nCommittee of Six: Screening and Discussion\n\nTime: January 29th, 2024, 6:30 pm CST\n\nLocation: Logan Center for the Arts, Penthouse Room 901\n\nOrganizers: The Open Practice Committee in the Department of Visual Arts, Chicago Center on Democracy, and Cinema Media Studies\n\nDescription: The Open Practice Committee invites you to join us for a live screening of the 2022 film Committee of Six directed by artist and filmmaker Fred Schmidt-Arenales.

Did you know that improv grew out of a movement to “socialize democracy”? The ‘Improv Workshop: Exploring Connections Between Improv and Democratic Movements,’ aims to shed light on how improv can be used to promote democratic discussion. The connections between improv and democracy are vast, exemplified by common language used in both arenas. In fact, games much like the ones we will be exploring at our workshop were developed during the 19th and early 20th century as a means to imagine new approaches to government and society. The workshop will be led by Fiona Maxwell, a PhD Candidate in the History Department who is writing her dissertation on ‘Democratic Ensembles: Spoken Art and Politics at Chicago Settlement Houses, 1890-1920.’ Fiona received her BA in History and Theatre from Northwestern University. Additionally, Fiona coaches UChicago graduate students in public speaking as a UChicagoGRAD oral communications specialist, teaches youth storytelling and improv classes at the Piven Theatre Workshop, and performs in storytelling venues across the Chicago area. The event will consist of fun and creative improv exercises and improvised storytelling techniques designed to encourage public discourse and reveal the interrelations between improv as an art form and democratic deliberation. This event is co-sponsored by the Chicago Center on Democracy, the Parrhesia Program for Public Discourse and UChicagoGRAD.\n\nWatch the recording: Webinar On The 2023 Elections in Argentina: Understanding the Political and Economic Impacts\n\nTime: Monday, December 11th, 2023, 12:00 – 1:30 pm CST\n\nLocation: Virtual\n\nOrganizers: Chicago Center on Democracy, Center for Latin American Studies, George J.

Woodlawn Avenue, Chicago, IL 60637)\n\nOrganizers: Chicago Center on Democracy, The Neubauer Collegium\n\nDescription: Join the Chicago Center on Democracy on Thursday, November 30th at 1:00 PM for a guided tour with Dieter Roelstraete, the Curator of the Neubauer Collegium’s current exhibit ‘Gelitin: Democratic Sculpture 7.’ The exhibition’s description states: “Known internationally for their ambitious public art projects and transgressive performances, Gelitin are indefatigable partisans of the ludic impulse in art, forever honoring Friedrich Schiller’s claim that ‘man only plays when he is in the fullest sense of the word a human being, and he is only fully a human being when he plays.’ Indeed, what may appear abject, provocative, and occasionally pornographic in their art should be considered, first and foremost, from the emancipatory perspective of ‘homo ludens.’” (Neubauer). Explore the relationship between play and democracy during this guided tour of this interactive installation. The tour will focus on interacting with the exhibition through a democratic lens, analyzing the social and political inspirations behind the installation. We will meet at the Neubauer Collegium in Hyde Park (5701 S.

Have you ever wondered about the significance of the “well-regulated militia” clause in Amendment 2? Do you have any idea what courts considered to be “unreasonable searches” from Amendment 4? While we may all know the basics of the Bill of Rights, it is important to get a deeper understanding of what the iconic document, and its amendments, fully entail. UChicago Law Professors Aziz Huq and William Baude will be answering students’ questions about the Bill of Rights and its amendments during this lunchtime Q&A.\n\nVoting out Autocratic Governments: Lessons from Poland\n\nTime: Tuesday, November 7, 2023, 12:30 – 2:00pm CST\n\nLocation: Social Sciences Tea Room, 1126 E. 59th Street, Room 201 Chicago, IL 60637\n\nOrganizers: Chicago Center on Democracy; Center for East European and Russian/Eurasian Studies\n\nDescription: The Chicago Center on Democracy and the Center for East European and Russian/Eurasian Studies invite you to a conversation about the implications of the recent Polish parliamentary election on October 15, 2023. The ruling PiS party (generally considered a populist, democratic backsliding party) won the largest share of votes, but even if it forms an alliance with the ideologically closest Konfederacia party, it will fall short of securing a majority in the legislature. The panel will focus on what this outcome means for the country, but also what it might indicate about the possibilities for voting out autocratic-leaning governments in other countries.This election raises additional questions about how the term “autocratic” should be used to describe governments. Is it appropriate to label a party as autocratic if it peacefully cedes control after losing an election? Furthermore, the panel will address the phenomenon of high youth support for nationalist rhetoric. It aims to explore why the electorate shifted away from PiS, how these voters were mobilized, and the reasons behind the disenchantment of some previously loyal voters.\n\nDemocracy Studies Board Game Night\n\nTime: Friday, November 3rd, 2023, 5:00 – 6:00 pm CDT\n\nLocation: MADD Center\n\nOrganizers: Chicago Center on Democracy, Democracy Studies\n\nDescription: Join our Student Advisory Board in our first board game night, come play Coup, Wavelength, Risk, and other democracy-related games, and get to know students in the minor!\n\nOpen House for the Minor in Democracy Studies\n\nTime: Wednesday, November 1, 2023, 4:30 – 6:00pm CDT\n\nLocation: Pick Hall, room 505\n\nOrganizers: Democracy Curriculum at the Chicago Center on Democracy\n\nDescription: All who are interested in democracy are welcome to gather with us to meet each other and learn about the new Minor in Democracy Studies.\n\nDemocracy and Conspiracy: What conspiratorial thinking in classical Athens reveals about democracy\n\nTime: Thursday, October 26, 2023, 5:00 – 6:30pm CDT\n\nLocation: Kent 107\n\nOrganizers: Classics of Social and Political Thought; Democracy Curriculum at the Chicago Center on Democracy\n\nDescription: In recent years, writers around the globe have declared the twenty-first century a golden age of conspiracy theory and democratic instability. But few have addressed a pressing question that precedes and complicates this conclusion: What if thinking conspiratorially about democracy could offer new strategies for understanding and practicing it? Are there narratives about democratic power from earlier moments of epistemic crisis that might help us be less presentist? This lecture by Professor Demetra Kasimis exposes the frequent, but often overlooked, engagement with conspiratorial thinking, secret plots, and subversive hidden networks in the prose and poetry of Athenian democracy to demonstrate how thinkers like Plato saw a creative and permanent entanglement between the idea and practice of conspiracy and the idea and practice of democracy.\n\nWhite Fright: The Sexual Panic at the Heart of America’s Racist History\n\nTime: Monday, October 23, 2023, 5:00pm CDT\n\nLocation: The Center for the Study of Gender and Sexuality – Community Room (5733 South University Avenue)\n\nOrganizers: Center for the Study of Gender and Sexuality; Chicago Center on Democracy\n\nDescription: UChicago historian Jane Dailey will discuss her research about how resistance to African American rights was motivated not just by a feeling of supremacy, but also by fear of Black sexuality.

While many scholars focus on the role of state institutions in encouraging development, the state is not the only or the primary arena shaping how citizens, service providers and state officials engage in actions that constitute politics and development. These individuals are members of religious orders, ethnic communities, and other groups that make claims on them, creating incentives that shape their actions. Professor Lust will provide a framework for elucidating these forces, in order to design future research and effective programming.\n\nStudent Activities and Resource Fair\n\nTime: Friday, September 29, 2023, 3:00 – 5:30pm CDT\n\nLocation: Main Quad\n\nDescription: Please come visit the Chicago Center on Democracy’s table at the 2023 Student Activities and Resource Fair!

Kirsch (University of Maryland, College Park), facilitated the discussion.

They have been protesting ever since, despite beatings by riot police, arrests, and even torture, demanding fair elections and the release of all political prisoners. The Belarusian revolution, as it is now called, became associated with the image of three women – a presidential candidate and two leaders of her team – raising their hands in the gesture of protest and solidarity. Elena Gapova will narrate the story of women emerging as the leaders of the Revolution as its most active and strong-willed participants.\n\n13th Annual University of Chicago International Education Conference: Conference Keynote and Educator Workshop\n\nFriday, November 6, 2020. 9:00am – 1:30pm CDT\n\nOrganizers: Center for East Asian Studies, Center for East European and Russian/Eurasian Studies, Center for Middle Eastern Studies (co-sponsored by the Chicago Center on Democracy)\n\nDescription: Keynote: “Networked Protests and Democracy in the 21st Century” with Zeynep Tufekci (Associate Professor, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill).
