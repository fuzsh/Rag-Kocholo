        "text": "Veteran will be asked to hold down the fort until Jennings returns from Achilles injury\n\nWith uncertainty surrounding Brandon Jennings' left Achilles tendon, the Detroit Pistons were in the market for a backup point guard this off-season.\n\nIn a perfect world, the player would meet two specifications:\n\n1. He's good enough to run the team until Jennings returns.\n\n2. He's an NBA veteran who has seen it all.\n\nThe Pistons believe they've found that guy in Steve Blake.\n\nWith the Brooklyn Nets looking to shed salary, the Pistons dealt end-of-the roster forward Quincy Miller for Blake in their last bit of major off-season business.\n\nMiller was waived by the Nets. The Pistons, meanwhile, got a 12-year veteran to man the fort until Jennings returns.\n\n\"It's exactly what we wanted,\" president/coach Stan Van Gundy said after the team's first practice of training camp Tuesday. \"A guy that's good enough to come out and be your everyday backup and mature enough that, when Brandon comes back, that if there's not as much or any minutes there, can handle that role.\"\n\nBlake is mature enough to handle whatever comes his way.\n\n\"My role will change a lot throughout the year,\" Blake said at media day Monday. \"With Brandon being hurt, playing some backup point guard in the beginning. When he comes back, maybe not playing at all.\n\n\"If I have to play with another point guard, at times, that's fine with me, guarding shooting guards. I'm pretty open to whatever he asks me to do, and he's kind of made me aware of that.\"\n\nBlake, 35, is a career 39% three-point shooter. At 6-feet-3, he's a larger point guard with long arms.\n\nBlake has played for seven teams and is approaching the end of his career. He said he likes Detroit as a basketball destination.\n\n\"From the second I got traded here, talking to coach Van Gundy and the plans he has for this team, for me, it's exciting,\" Blake said. \"I only have a couple of years left to play, and it seems like one of the better basketball destinations throughout my career.\""
