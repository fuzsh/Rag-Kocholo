        "text": "TUALATIN -- One game into Arron Afflalo's career as a Trail Blazer, the veteran wing admits he's still figuring out where and how he fits into Portland's system.\n\n\"It's tough, man, because you want that dream story,\" Afflalo said at the Blazers practice facility on Tuesday. \"You want to hit the ground running and being successful. It may take a few games just to get that rhythm.\"\n\nAfflalo played 23:32 off the bench in his first game with Portland, a loss to the Grizzlies on Sunday night, finishing with eight points on 2-of-6 shooting and four rebounds.\n\nThe question now becomes how quickly Afflalo can get comfortable with the Blazers. He said he hopes to have it all figured out by Wednesday when Portland hosts San Antonio, but even that answer came with a knowing smile. It takes time to get acclimated to new teammates, but with 27 games left in the regular season the Blazers and Afflalo can't wait for a gradual adjustment.\n\n\"It's going to take him maybe five, seven games by my perspective because he's still trying to learn the offense,\" Blazers forward LaMarcus Aldridge said. \"He's still trying to figure out where his shots come from.\"\n\nPoint guard Steve Blake knows the challenges of switching teams midseason. Twice in Blake's 12-year career he's been traded to teams looking to bolster their roster for the playoffs.\n\nIn 2007, Blake went from Milwaukee to Denver, joining a Nuggets team with Allen Iverson and Carmelo Anthony that needed a point guard to help for the stretch run. Blake said for experienced players like Afflalo and Alonzo Gee, who also came over in the trade from Denver last week, the adjustment is mostly mental.\n\n\"There's plenty of time by the playoffs for them to be comfortable,\" Blake said. \"Sometimes it can be as quick as just a couple games, or it could take a week or month. But as long as you're someone who kind of knows the game a little bit, like they do, and been around for a while there's a lot of similarities throughout teams.\"\n\nBlake was a major part of the Nuggets postseason plans in 2007, a stark contrast from a season ago when he was traded from the Lakers to the Warriors as point guard insurance for Golden State's playoff run. Blake saw limited minutes for the Warriors.\n\n\"It's almost easier to play a lot more,\" Blake said. \"It's a little more difficult when you don't play much because you don't have that time out there to get adjusted.\"\n\nBlazers coach Terry Stotts said he hopes to ramp up Afflalo's minutes, envisioning him in a three-man wing rotation with Wesley Matthews and Nicolas Batum. Stotts said he was pleased with Afflalo's first game considering his limited practice time.\n\n\"I have a good feel for what Arron can do particularly at the offensive end and how to incorporate him into our offense. I don't think that should be that difficult,\" Stotts said. \"He moves well without the ball, he gets out in transition, he can post up a little bit, he can come off screens and shoot, he can spot up on the weakside. There's a lot of things within the framework of what we do that I think will work for him.\"\n\nAfflalo spent time after practice on Tuesday going through offensive sets with Blazers assistants. He said his new teammates have been forthcoming with offering him help learning the new system.\n\n\"Confidence comes from being successful a little bit,\" Afflalo said. \"Winning will help.\"\n\n-- Mike Richman"
