        "text": "Editor’s Note: Find more of Jonathan Wasserman’s coverage of the 2024 Draft on Bleacher Report or to read this article on BleacherReport.com, click here.\n\n(B/R) — Conference tournament play is underway, which means NBA executives are leaving their teams to start really scouting and focusing on the draft.\n\nDespite many prospects having already approached 30 games this season, every college player still has room to improve their stock.\n\nThere is a major focus right now on Kentucky’s top two guards, who both started the season off our board and have each slowly crept into the top-five conversation.\n\nThere also a number of prospects whose seasons have already ended, and now big decisions loom with a perceived weak 2024 draft field to take advantage of.\n\nSome of the analysis is repeated from our previous mock draft published on March 6. Draft order and stats up to date entering Wednesday’s games.\n\n1. Washington Wizards: Alexandre Sarr\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 1\n\nTeam: Perth Wildcats\n\nPosition: PF/C\n\nSize: 7-foot-1, 216 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 18\n\nNationality: French\n\nPro Comparison: Jaren Jackson Jr\n\nThrough two NBL playoff games, Alexandre Sarr has totaled seven blocks and a handful of other shot-altering contests in under 25 total minutes. At 18 years old, he’s been a defensive difference-maker with his size, length and mobility for court coverage. And that presence is something the Washington Wizards would be able to bank on.\n\nBut he’s become a strong candidate to go No. 1 thanks to some of the offensive flashes of 3-point range, pull-up shooting and open-floor ball-handling—unique skills for a 7-foot-1, switchable rim protector.\n\nOf all the projected top picks, Sarr is starting to look like the best bet to help change a team’s identity and upside.\n\n2. Detroit Pistons: Zaccharie Risacher\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 2\n\nTeam: JL Bourg-en-Bresse\n\nPosition: SG/SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-8, 204 lbs\n\nAge/Year:\n\nNationality: 18\n\nPro Comparison: Harrison Barnes\n\nA big question for the Detroit Pistons’ front office asks how much they’ll take fit into account at No. 2. With Cade Cunningham’s and Jaden Ivey’s development being priorities, there isn’t room for guards like Reed Sheppard and Rob Dillingham. And with Ausar Thompson and Jalen Duren as quality starters, adding a poor shooter like Ron Holland seems problematic.\n\nZaccharie Risacher comes off as both a best-prospect-available option and an easy fit in a lineup with two ball-handlers. While scouts still have questions about his on-ball skill set creating and playmaking, his 43.8% 3-point mark and shotmaking are obvious draws for a 6-foot-8 wing.\n\nHe’s being viewed as a safe, plug-and-play prospect, which could be more attractive in a draft where it’s difficult to identify any sure-thing stars.\n\n3. San Antonio Spurs: Reed Sheppard\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 6\n\nTeam: Kentucky\n\nPosition: PG/SG\n\nSize: 6-foot-3, 187 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 19, Freshman\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Kirk Hinrich\n\nThe hottest topic right now among scouts is Reed Sheppard’s ceiling after he added another ridiculous performance to his NBA prospect resume with 27 points and five assists in a road win at Tennessee.\n\nThe analytics say Sheppard’s impact stacks up with top-five pick freshmen—only Zion Williamson, Anthony Davis, Michael Beasley, Kevin Love, Chet Holmgren, Karl-Anthony Towns and Evan Mobley recorded higher box plus-minuses for a season, per Bart Torvik.\n\nHe’s maintained outrageous efficiency and per-minute production throughout the year. Sheppard entered the SEC tournament with a 70.4 true shooting percentage, 140 assists to 62 turnovers and wild steal (4.7%) and block (2.7%) rates.\n\nThe big question is how much his underwhelming physical profile and athletic traits will restrict him at the next level.\n\nHis measurements will be the most anticipated and scrutinized at the NBA combine. There are sure to be teams who nitpick at each inch when assessing height, wingspan and standing verticals. Questions asking how easily he’ll create in the half court or separate and finish are understandable for a guard who may check in at 6-foot-2 in socks and lacks Darius Garland-like quickness or Donovan Mitchell-like explosion.\n\nBut there will also be teams who simply buy his effectiveness against top NCAA competition, the translation of elite shooting, finishing craft, skill set for on/off-ball offense and IQ for passing and defense.\n\n4. Charlotte Hornets: Ron Holland\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 4\n\nTeam: G League Ignite\n\nPosition: SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-6, 204 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 18\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Cam Whitmore\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets may be tempted to replace Terry Rozier’s scoring with a similarly (small) shot-creator and shotmaker in Rob Dillingham. But they might also be drawn to Ron Holland’s downhill explosiveness and defensive quickness next to LaMelo Ball’s creativity and Brandon Miller’s shotmaking.\n\nDespite seeing his stock dip since being projected No. 1 earlier in the season, Holland still averaged 19.5 points in the G League at 18 years old. And he made some encouraging adjustments throughout the season, particularly with his ability to play at different speeds, rather than fast.\n\nAt worst, Holland should be able to inject his team with transition offense, rim pressure and easy baskets. But given his age and the flashes, there is still plenty of untapped self-creation, passing and shotmaking to bet on.\n\n5. Portland Trail Blazers: Cody Williams\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 8\n\nTeam: Colorado\n\nPosition: SF/PF\n\nSize: 6-foot-8, 190 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 19, Freshman\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Jaden McDaniels\n\nDrafting Scoot Henderson No. 3, extending Anfernee Simons and developing Shaedon Sharpe could make it difficult for the Portland Trail Blazers to justify adding another guard like Rob Dillingham.\n\nOpinions vary on Cody Williams, specifically his offensive ceiling and whether it tops out at complementary scorer/play-finisher or if there is untapped self-creation and playmaking potential.\n\nMissing time with an ankle injury does mean fewer opportunities to show more on-ball upside. But his off-ball efficiency, effectiveness as a driver and defense will prevent most teams from worrying too much about Williams’ one-on-one skills.\n\n6. Memphis Grizzlies: Rob Dillingham\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 7\n\nTeam: Kentucky\n\nPosition: PG/SG\n\nSize: 6-foot-3, 176 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 19, Freshman\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Darius Garland\n\nThe draft order should play a big role in where Rob Dillingham winds up, as some teams in the projected top five don’t have a need for a lead ball-handler. There is also a debate raging among scouts about who’d they prefer between Dillingham and his teammate Reed Sheppard.\n\nSheppard going first could push Dillingham outside the top five, though in this range, he’ll look too enticing as a best-prospect-available for teams pass. He continues to score efficiently with arguably the highest skill level for self-creation and tough shotmaking in the draft.\n\nThe only hesitation on Dillingham will be caused by that 176-pound frame, which will feel less problematic if he’s able to convince coaches that he can run the point. Iffy shot selection and some promising playmaking flashes have scouts torn.\n\n7. San Antonio Spurs (via Raptors): Nikola Topić\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 3\n\nTeam: KK Crvena Zvezda\n\nPosition: PG\n\nSize: 6-foot-6, 198 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 18\n\nNationality: Serbian\n\nPro Comparison: Goran Dragic\n\nIt’s been over two months since Nikola Topić has played (knee injury), and in that time, the Kentucky guards have changed the conversation at the top of this draft. Their growth—and ability to play off the ball—could push Topić down the board a few spots. But it’s difficult to imagine him sliding past the San Antonio Spurs, who need more creation and passing and would own the Toronto Raptors’ pick if it’s outside the top six.\n\nThis missed time may be costing Topić opportunities to strengthen his case as the draft’s top guard, particularly since he transferred to Red Star for EuroLeague experience.\n\nHowever, leading the Adriatic League in assists and ranking second in scoring (at 6-foot-6 and 18 years old) should have been enough to secure lottery interest, regardless of what happens upon his return. Teams should feel comfortable about his potential to come in and provide instant rim pressure, pick-and-roll offense and playmaking.\n\n8. Houston Rockets (via Nets): Matas Buzelis\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 5\n\nTeam: G League Ignite\n\nPosition: SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-8, 209 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 19\n\nNationality: American/Lithuania\n\nPro Comparison: Hedo Türkoğlu\n\nThe Houston Rockets should be active shoppers with the No. 8 pick, considering how many young prospects the roster already has, no surefire star in the late lottery and a presumed desire from the front office to start pushing for the playoffs.\n\nMatas Buzelis will be in the best-prospect-available conversation from here on with his coveted big-wing archetype, scoring versatility and athleticism around the rim. There is some disappointment from scouts in his shooting, consistency and overall aggression. But at this stage of the draft, teams won’t nitpick a 6-foot-8 19-year-old who clearly has 3-point range, tough shotmaking skill, handles to attack and bounce for picking up easy baskets and blocks.\n\n9. Utah Jazz: Kyle Filipowski\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 9\n\nTeam: Duke\n\nPosition: PF/C\n\nSize: 7-foot-0, 248 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 20, Sophomore\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Santi Aldama\n\nScoring mismatch isn’t the draw to Kyle Filipowski anymore. It’s the versatility—a specific combination of shooting, passing, physical finishing and switchable defense that separates him from most 7-footers and can give a frontcourt a different feel or advantage.\n\nThe flashes of transition ball-handling or half-court face-up moves into drives are a bonus and allow Filipowski to generate his own offense in space. But his real value comes from making his lineup better with floor-spacing, post passing, cleaning up inside and his ability to slide and guard around the perimeter.\n\n10. Atlanta Hawks: Donovan Clingan\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 11\n\nTeam: Connecticut\n\nPosition: C\n\nSize: 7-foot-2, 280 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 20, Sophomore\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Jakob Poeltl\n\nThere may be sexier picks with more modernized skills or compelling archetypes, but with Donovan Clingan, teams know what they’re getting, and that could hold extra weight for a front office directly looking to strengthen its interior defense and add more physicality. At 7-foot-2, 280 pounds with length, surprising mobility and excellent anticipation, he’s going to instantly improve a team’s rim protection, alter decisions in the paint and prevent second-chance points.\n\nOffensively, his size, strength and soft hands will naturally translate to easy baskets off rolls, dump-downs and putbacks, though playing Clingan may require forwards who can handle the ball or space the floor.\n\n11. Oklahoma City Thunder (via Rockets): Kel’el Ware\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 19\n\nTeam: Indiana\n\nPosition: C\n\nSize: 7-foot-0, 242 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 19, Sophomore\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Brook Lopez\n\nKel’el Ware continues a run that feels like a career turning point after he’s scored at least 26 points in three of four games. Two of those three games were wins by five points or fewer.\n\nNarratives that point out empty stats or low-impact production are losing steam. Indiana seems to be doing a better job of featuring him, and he’s delivering in one-on-one situations around the basket while also flashing the bonus shotmaking touch and range that create more offensive upside.\n\nHe’s only going to look more enticing during workouts, where his physical tools, athleticism and shooting could push teams to ignore previous questions about inconsistency or motor.\n\n12. Chicago Bulls: Devin Carter\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 10\n\nTeam: Providence\n\nPosition: PG/SG\n\nSize: 6-foot-3, 195 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 21, Junior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Brandin Podziemski\n\nDevin Carter’s 19.4 points per game have been the story, but he’s going to earn NBA minutes and paychecks off versatility and intangibles. For a 6-foot-3 guard, the 30 blocked shots and 8.6 rebounds per game are telling. Unteachable defensive intensity, toughness and instincts separate Carter and fuel his identity, though he’s entered the lottery conversation by developing into a dangerous shotmaker and crafty pick-and-roll ball-handler.\n\n13. Portland Trail Blazers (via Warriors): Ja’Kobe Walter\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 15\n\nTeam: Baylor\n\nPosition: SG/SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-5, 195 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 19, Freshman\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Kentavious Caldwell-Pope\n\nSixty-five made threes, a floater game and defensive tools have shielded Ja’Kobe Walter from taking too much heat for his lack of creation or shooting consistency. There is a feeling of safety around his shotmaking and three-and-D projection, and there figures to be no shortage of NBA teams interested in his archetype.\n\n14. New Orleans Pelicans (via Lakers): Isaiah Collier\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 12\n\nTeam: USC\n\nPosition: PG\n\nSize: 6-foot-5, 210 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 19, Freshman\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Tyreke Evans\n\nThe scouting report on Isaiah Collier remains well-defined, with his quickness, power and tough finishing good for creation, rim pressure and gravity, and his shooting struggles and turnovers troublesome for a lead ball-handler.\n\nScouts are deciding what role will suit Collier best and if his shot and decision-making are likely to improve.\n\nRegardless, without many starting point guard jobs open, he figures to begin his career as a change-of-pace bench spark.\n\n15. Miami Heat: Dalton Knecht\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 17\n\nTeam: Tennessee\n\nPosition: SG/SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-6, 204 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 22, Senior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Wally Szczerbiak\n\nDalton Knecht’s 2024 draft profile now shows a 40-point game against Kentucky, 39 points in a win over Auburn, 31 points against South Carolina, 39 points in a blowout over Florida and 37 points against North Carolina.\n\nAt this stage, the only debate around Knecht’s NBA outlook is over his ceiling. Scouts all see a plug-and-play pro based on his solid frame, special shotmaking and business-like approach.\n\nThe list of quality NBA starters who were drafted at 23 years old remains short. But there will be unfazed teams in the teens who’ll be sold on Knecht’s floor and the easy translation of his off-ball scoring.\n\n16. Philadelphia 76ers: Stephon Castle\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 22\n\nTeam: Connecticut\n\nPosition: SG\n\nSize: 6-foot-6, 215 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 19, Freshman\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: RJ Barrett\n\nHit-or-miss all season, Stephon Castle is enticing with a 6-foot-6 frame and point-wing archetype, yet polarizing due to inconsistency, quiet games and poor shooting. It’s reasonable to think a team could reach early on a big playmaker with strong defensive tools, physical driving ability and the potential to improve his shot. It’s also reasonable to think he could slide past teams unwilling to draft a ball-handler who struggles with his pull-up, lacks explosion around the basket and doesn’t offer much off the ball.\n\nHis impact during the Big East and NCAA tournaments could tip the scales, particularly given the number of high-level games Connecticut could wind up playing.\n\n17. Toronto Raptors (via Pacers): Tyler Smith\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 13\n\nTeam: G League Ignite\n\nPosition: PF\n\nSize: 6-foot-11, 224 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 19\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Channing Frye\n\nTyler Smith has now gone four consecutive games without making a 3-pointer, a potential concern for a prospect whose shooting has been the sole driving force behind his rise. In the meantime, it’s also a good sign he’s found other ways to score off his finishing and mid-range touch.\n\nThis current mini-slump from three won’t negate the 56 makes he’s had throughout the season. Smith will also have a good opportunity to sell teams on his shot during workouts. But scouts have asked whether Smith projects as more of a spot-up threat.\n\nOverall, he does have fans who’d take him lottery, but there are also skeptics who see a one-dimensional player.\n\n18. Orlando Magic: Terrence Shannon Jr.\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 14\n\nTeam: Illinois\n\nPosition: SG/SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-6, 225 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 23, Senior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Kelly Oubre Jr.\n\nTerrence Shannon Jr. will enter the Big Ten tournament coming off another game of at least 25 points. He’s made real strides this season optimizing his speed and quickness to create advantages, easy-basket chances and trips to the line. And he he took another step forward with his shotmaking, drilling 33 catch-and-shoot threes and 28 off the dribble.\n\nRegardless of how consistent his jump shot will be at the next level, Shannon should be able to change the dynamic of a lineup with how he’s able to put pressure on defenses in transition, turning the corner or off his first step.\n\nStill, it’s impossible to talk about Shannon’s draft stock without mentioning his May 10 hearing for a September rape allegation.\n\n19. New York Knicks (via Mavericks): Jared McCain\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 16\n\nTeam: Duke\n\nPosition: PG/SG\n\nSize: 6-foot-3, 197 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 20, Freshman\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Immanuel Quickley\n\nJared McCain has demonstrated enough proven shotmaking, floater touch and crafty handling in ball-screen situations to keep scouts from losing sleep over his size and athletic limitations. He should be able to provide some backcourt flexibility/versatility with his dangerous catch-and-shoot game or his ability to play on the ball as a pick-and-roll scorer and passer.\n\n20. Atlanta Hawks (via Kings): Johnny Furphy\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 18\n\nTeam: Kansas\n\nPosition: SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-9, 202 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 19, Freshman\n\nNationality: Australian\n\nPro Comparison: Trey Murphy III\n\nPlaying exclusively off the ball makes Johnny Furphy vulnerable to quiet games. Even on 17.2 % usage, he’s still been productive by capitalizing on spot-up threes and transition opportunities.\n\nHis NBA role won’t be any different early on in the NBA, where his shotmaking and athleticism can translate to play-finishing from behind the arc and at the rim.\n\n21. New York Knicks: Yves Missi\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 20\n\nTeam: Baylor\n\nPosition: C\n\nSize: 7-foot-0, 235 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 19, Freshman\n\nNationality: Cameroon\n\nPro Comparison: Mark Williams\n\nYves Missi’s tools and athleticism are designed for lob-catching and shot-blocking. He’s also showing some face-up skill using his handle and body control to attack bigs in space. Missi has struggled to convert putback chances and post-ups, so teams will need to address why that’s been the case. He could work on his touch, creating angles and using his body to carve out space. Regardless, Missi’s value early on will revolve around picking up easy baskets, guarding pick-and-rolls and protecting the basket.\n\n22. Phoenix Suns: Tristan da Silva\n\nPrevious mock draft spot: No. 23\n\nSchool/team: Colorado\n\nPosition: SF/PF\n\nSize: 6-foot-9, 220 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 22, Senior\n\nNationality: German/Brazilian\n\nPro comparison: Kyle Kuzma\n\nThere are scouts on the fence about Tristan da Silva’s lack of explosion and physicality inside the arc, and there are scouts who value his shotmaking at 6-foot-9, overall skill level and IQ. There is still time for more convincing during the Pac-12 tournament and potentially the NCAA tournament. Regardless, there should be teams looking for or drawn to da Silva’s stretch-forward archetype.\n\n23. New Orleans Pelicans: Tidjane Salaun\n\nPrevious mock draft spot: No. 26\n\nSchool/Team: Cholet\n\nNationality: French\n\nPosition: SF/PF\n\nAge: 18\n\nSize: 6-foot-9, 212 lbs\n\nPro comparison: Obi Toppin\n\nThe mixed results from Tidjane Salaun remain understandable, given his age and a role that calls for a lot of standing around the arc. Regular flashes of shotmaking and athleticism at the rim figure to outweigh the quiet scoring games on draft night. The 6-foot-9 18-year-old is up to 58 made threes and 29 dunks, a combination that highlights his play-finishing as a spot-up shooter and finisher. Anything he adds in between will take time and feels like bonus, but he’ll draw first-round interest for his ability to space the floor, run in transition, cut for easy baskets and crash the glass.\n\n24. Cleveland Cavaliers: Kevin McCullar Jr.\n\nPrevious mock draft spot: No. 27\n\nSchool/team: Kansas\n\nPosition: SG/SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-7, 214 lbs\n\nAge: 22, Senior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Josh Hart\n\nKevin McCullar Jr.’s knee injury has limited him over the past several weeks, and now it’s expected to keep him from the Big 12 tournament after he was forced to leave the Houston game early and scoreless. It’s now a storyline to watch with the predraft process not far away, though McCullar has likely done enough to still warrant first-round consideration, as long as no red flags are raised during medical reports. While it’s difficult to picture upside with a 23-year-old wing who’s still limited from three, his slashing, passing, secondary playmaking, defense and passable jump shot could draw comparisons to glue guys like Josh Hart.\n\n25. Milwaukee Bucks: Ulrich Chomche\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 24\n\nTeam: NBA Africa Academy\n\nPosition: C\n\nSize: 6-foot-11, 225 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 18\n\nNationality: Cameroon\n\nPro Comparison: Serge Ibaka\n\nScouts will now have multiple opportunities to see Ulrich Chomche during April’s Nike Hoop Summit and May’s BAL Elevate season in Africa. His play over the next two months will likely dictate whether the 6-foot-11 18-year-old will declare for the draft or considering his college offers (or G League Ignite) for the 2024-25 season.\n\nChomche had some wow moments back in December at the G League Showcase, making a strong impression with his rim protection and offensive flashes of shot-making, ball-handling and passing.\n\n26. Washington Wizards (via Clippers): Carlton Carrington\n\nPrevious mock draft spot: No. 29\n\nSchool/team: Pittsburgh\n\nPosition: PG/SG\n\nSize: 6-foot-5, 190 lbs\n\nAge: 18, Freshman\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Nickeil Alexander-Walker\n\nOne of the more interesting names teams will monitor during the predraft process, Carlton Carrington has divided scouts with his shotmaking, playmaking production and some athletic and statistical red flags. He finished the regular season averaging 1.9 threes, 5.2 boards and 4.2 assists, impressive production for a 6-foot-5, 18-year-old point guard in the ACC. But he also shot 47.7% on layups, made just 23 half-court field goals at the rim and recorded 17 steals in 31 games. Scouts are drawn to his positional size, pull-up game and live-dribble passing, but they’re torn by his lack of rim pressure, heavy reliance on jumpers and scary defensive playmaking rate.\n\n27. Minnesota Timberwolves: Bobi Klintman\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 31\n\nTeam: Cairns Taipans\n\nPosition: SF/PF\n\nSize: 6-foot-8, 215 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 20\n\nNationality: Swedish\n\nPro Comparison: De’Andre Hunter\n\nBobi Klintman has started preparing for the draft after an encouraging season in the NBL, showing teams his transition ball-handling, shooting range, athleticism around the rim, some live-dribble passing and strong defensive tools. While he hasn’t established one signature skill, versatility and fit have become selling points for an NBA combo forward.\n\n28. Utah Jazz (via Thunder): Jaylon Tyson\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 21\n\nTeam: California\n\nPosition: SF/PF\n\nSize: 6-foot-7, 215 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 21, Junior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Caleb Martin\n\nJaylon Tyson entered the Pac-12 tournament averaging 19.6 points and 3.3 assists per game, numbers that reflect impression ball-handling/footwork for creation and shotmaking skills for a 6-foot-7 wing.\n\nHe’ll eventually have to adjust to playing off the ball at the next level, something he hasn’t looked proficient doing at California. But he could also find success as a second-unit scorer based on how advanced he’s become on the ball, getting into his shot, rising up off the dribble and finishing at the rim off his own moves.\n\n29. Denver Nuggets: Collin Murray-Boyles\n\nPrevious mock draft spot: No. 28\n\nSchool/team: South Carolina\n\nPosition: PF\n\nSize: 6-foot-7, 231 lbs\n\nAge: 18, Freshman\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Julius Randle\n\nIt still sounds like scouts are in the early stages of their evaluation on Collin Murray-Boyles, whose production spiked later in the season off a skill set that isn’t considered modern. At some stage, a team may have to buy his effectiveness using a clear NBA body and movement to overpower, beat defenders in the post, finish through rim protection and defend in space. There will likely be executives seeing him live for the first time at the SEC tournament, a big opportunity for the 18-year-old freshman to back up the numbers/analytics and make an impression.\n\n30. Boston Celtics: KJ Simpson\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 30\n\nTeam: Colorado\n\nPosition: PG\n\nSize: 6-foot-2, 189 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 21, Junior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Fred VanVleet\n\nDespite averaging 19.6 points and 4.9 assists on 61.6% true shooting, some scouts still sound blinded by Simpson’s lack of size and athleticism. Generally, teams in the late first or early second round become willing to take the highly productive but older, smaller or less explosive ball-handlers like Jalen Pickett, Andrew Nembhard, Marcus Sasser and Jalen Brunson. Being billed as a potential backup or third-string point guard, Simpson may be on steal watch this late with creation, shotmaking and toughness that can often trump physical limitations at his position.\n\n31. Utah Jazz (via Wizards): Dillon Jones\n\nPrevious mock draft spot: No. 25\n\nSchool/Team: Weber State\n\nNationality: American\n\nPosition: SF\n\nAge/Year: 22, Junior\n\nSize: 6-foot-6, 235 lbs\n\nPro comparison: Tosan Evbuomwan\n\nWith Weber State’s loss to Montana State in the Big Sky tournament, Dillon Jones’ season is over. The only NCAA player on record to average at least 20 points, nine rebounds, five assists and a 3-pointer, he has scouts divided on his historic production and unusual fit/position for the NBA. Teams are asking whether he’ll be a useful creator on the ball and if he offers any value playing off it.\n\nThere figures to be one team willing to take a chance earlier than others. At 6-foot-6, 235 pounds, his ball-handling, live-dribble passing, finishing, improving touch and capable shot ultimately create tempting versatility.\n\n32. Toronto Raptors (via Pistons): Kyshawn George\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 33\n\nTeam: Miami\n\nPosition: SG/SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-8, 205 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 20, Freshman\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Kevin Huerter\n\nMiami’s season ended. Now the question is if Kyshawn George’s predraft season is about to begin. Scouts expect that he’ll test and ultimately generate enough interest to stay in the draft, assuming there will be teams willing to invest time and patience in a 6-foot-8 shooter who can handle the ball, pass and disrupt defensively.\n\nOn the flip side, he suffers from a severe lack of explosion that raises questions about his ability to be of use off the dribble and inside the arc.\n\n33. San Antonio Spurs: Zach Edey\n\nPrevious mock draft spot: No. 32\n\nSchool/team: Purdue\n\nPosition: C\n\nSize: 7-foot-4, 300 lbs\n\nAge: 21, Senior\n\nNationality: Canadian\n\nPro comparison: Jonas Valanciunas\n\nDespite concerns over Zach Edey’s offensive fit and defensive switchability for today’s NBA, his height, strength, footwork, touch and reach may be too advantageous for some teams pass on in the 20s and 30s. The ability to create and fall into high-percentage shots is what could sway a front office.\n\n34. Portland Trail Blazers (via Hornets): Oso Ighodaro\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 34\n\nTeam: Marquette\n\nPosition: PF/C\n\nSize: 6-foot-11, 235 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 21, Senior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Brandon Clarke\n\nThe ball-handling, passing and touch shots continue to separate Oso Ighodaro from most bigs. His 2.8 assists per game and 67 made runners/floaters are unique numbers for a projected center. Teams will be drawn to Ighodaro’s potential to give them a different look up front with his playmaking and signature push shots around the free-throw line.\n\n35. Milwaukee Bucks (via Blazers): Harrison Ingram\n\nPrevious mock draft spot: No. 38\n\nSchool/team: North Carolina\n\nPosition: SF/PF\n\nSize: 6-foot-7, 235 lbs\n\nAge: 21, Junior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Naji Marshall\n\nThere will be interest in Harrison Ingram’s box-checking versatility. Between his shotmaking, physical/active rebounding and a comfort level handling and passing in ball-screen situations, coaches should be able to use Ingram in different sets and roles.\n\n36. Minnesota Timberwolves (via Grizzlies): Hunter Sallis\n\nPrevious mock draft spot: No. 35\n\nSchool/team: Wake Forest\n\nPosition: SG\n\nSize: 6-foot-5, 185 lbs\n\nAge: 20, Junior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Malaki Branham\n\nHunter Sallis finished the regular season shooting 41.6% from three (69 3PTM), making 51 mid-range jumpers and converting 65.4% of his rim attempts. At 6-foot-5, 185 pounds and limited as a playmaker, he won’t have much margin for error, but Sallis possess enough self-creation, three-level shotmaking and athleticism for NBA teams to bet on his scoring potential.\n\n37. Philadelphia 76ers (via Raptors): Ryan Dunn\n\nPrevious mock draft spot: No. 36\n\nSchool/team: Virginia\n\nPosition: PF\n\nSize: 6-foot-8, 216 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 21, Sophomore\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Matisse Thybulle\n\nAs Ryan Dunn’s scoring and shooting limitations have become more obvious, the idea of a 6-foot-8 wing/forward climbing into the lottery has faded. His explosiveness and unique defensive steal/block rates may still be strong enough for teams to picture an outlier, capable of impacting games strictly with athletic play-finishing and defensive court coverage.\n\n38. Memphis Grizzlies (via Nets): Pelle Larsson\n\nPrevious mock draft spot: No. 37\n\nSchool/team: Arizona\n\nPosition: SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-6, 213 lbs\n\nAge: 23, Senior\n\nNationality: Swedish\n\nPro comparison: Christian Braun\n\nEven if there isn’t an obvious path to upside for Pelle Larsson, he possesses an adaptable game playing on and off the ball with his ball-screen slashing/playmaking, cutting and improved catch-and-shoot stroke. He reads the game well, capitalizes within the flow of Arizona’s offense, can be used in different roles and doesn’t take bad shots.\n\n39. New York Knicks (via Jazz): Jamal Shead\n\nPrevious mock draft spot: No. 41\n\nSchool/team: Houston\n\nPosition: PG\n\nSize: 6-foot-1, 200 lbs\n\nAge: 21, Senior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Jevon Carter\n\nJamal Shead has scouts thinking about the success of smaller, pesky defenders like Jevon Carter, Miles McBride, Jose Alvarado and Patrick Beverley. The Big 12 Player and Defensive Player of the Year will compete for NBA minutes by providing relentless ball pressure, wild instincts/reactions and toughness, though Shead’s 6.2 assists per game, 41 made pull-ups and 31 made floaters suggests he can add some offensive value as well.\n\n40. Portland Trail Blazers (via Hawks): Justin Edwards\n\nPrevious mock draft spot: No. 46\n\nSchool/team: Kentucky\n\nPosition: SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-8, 203 lbs\n\nAge: 20, Freshman\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: James Posey\n\nIt seemed like time was running out on Justin Edwards. He’s now made 14-of-21 threes over Kentucky’s last six games entering the SEC tournament.\n\nIt’s a key development, as it restores some of the shotmaking credibility and shooting potential that he arrived at Kentucky with. And Edwards needs that shot, given his ball-handling and creation limitations.\n\n41. Charlotte Hornets (via Rockets): Adem Bona\n\nPrevious mock draft spot: No. 39\n\nSchool/team: UCLA\n\nPosition: C\n\nSize: 6-foot-10, 245 lbs\n\nAge: 20, Sophomore\n\nNationality: Turkish/Nigerian\n\nPro comparison: Isaiah Jackson\n\nAdem Bona’s best game in months came during UCLA’s regular-season finale against Arizona State, when he went for 20 points, 12 boards and four steals while making all eight of his free throws.\n\nStill, the scouting report hasn’t changed much on Bona, an exciting finisher, capable low-post option, rangy defender/shot-blocker and foul/turnover-prone big man. While he isn’t sharp enough with the ball for NBA teams to feed in the half court, he does have the right tools, athleticism and motor for an energizer role.\n\n42. Boston Celtics (via Bulls): Baylor Scheierman\n\nPrevious mock draft spot: No. 47\n\nSchool/team: Creighton\n\nPosition: SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-7, 205 lbs\n\nAge: 23, Senior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Joe Ingles\n\nBaylor Scheierman finished the regular season with 97 made threes, giving him 343 for his NCAA career and some of the strongest shotmaking credibility in the draft. Throw in 6-foot-7 size, high-level passing IQ and outstanding rebounding numbers, and certain teams with second-round picks will look past his age and athletic limitations. There is a clear connector role for his shooting and pick-and-roll play.\n\n43. Houston Rockets (via Warriors): Ajay Mitchell\n\nPrevious mock draft spot: No. 43\n\nSchool/team: Santa Barbara\n\nPosition: PG\n\nSize: 6-foot-5, 190 lbs\n\nAge: 21, Junior\n\nNationality: Belgian\n\nPro comparison: Andrew Nembhard\n\nAjay Mitchell recently had one of those games in which he looked like a first-round pick, scoring 37 points on four made threes and 13-of-18 shooting overall against Long Beach State.\n\nSanta Barbara’s schedule, record (seventh in the Big West) and Mitchell’s lack of 3-point volume work against him. But there will be believers in his scoring translating based on how effectively he uses change of speed to get to spots and touch shots/adjustments around the paint.\n\nPlus, despite taking just 2.6 threes in 31.2 minutes as a third-year college guard, he’s making them at a solid rate (38.9%), burying free throws (85.4%) and demonstrating the shotmaking versatility to connect off the catch and dribble.\n\n44. San Antonio Spurs (via Lakers): Pacome Dadiet\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 44\n\nTeam: Ratiopharm Ulm\n\nPosition: SF/PF\n\nSize: 6-foot-8, 210lbs\n\nAge/Year: 18\n\nNationality: French\n\nPro Comparison: Isaac Okoro\n\nAthletic, 6-foot-8 and 18 years old, Pacome Dadiet is finding ways to score in the German League and Eurocup by running the floor, cutting and making 41.7% of his jump shots. NBA teams could determine that he has the right physical traits, motor and an adequate shooting stroke for off-ball finishing and defensive versatility.\n\n45. Miami Heat: Tyler Kolek\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 42\n\nTeam: Marquette\n\nPosition: PG\n\nSize: 6-foot-3, 195 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 22, Senior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Jason Preston\n\nPredraft measurements, athletic testing and workouts aren’t likely to help Tyler Kolek. An impact postseason performance as Marquette’s engine could, assuming he returns from an oblique injury.\n\nThere is debate about how much of his scoring will carry over to the pros. But his pick-and-roll playmaking and passing are considered translatable, and he should still be able to threaten defenses as a shotmaker with his catch-and-shoot game and floater.\n\n46. Los Angeles Clippers (via Pacers): Kam Jones\n\nPrevious Mock Draft Spot: No. 56\n\nTeam: Marquette\n\nPosition: SG\n\nSize: 6-foot-5, 200 lbs\n\nAge/Year: 22, Junior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro Comparison: Malik Monk\n\nKam Jones finished the regular season with his fourth 30-point game since February, though it was the nine assists with Tyler Kolek out that stood out. Still, he’s going to earn NBA looks for the self-creation flashes, high-level shotmaking and crafty finishing that together create microwave scoring ability. It’s rare to see a guard this potent also be this efficient—Jones is at 60.1% inside the arc and 41.1% from three, averaging just 1.1 turnovers in 28.2 minutes.\n\n47. Boston Celtics (via Mavericks): Payton Sandfort\n\nPrevious mock draft spot: No. 40\n\nSchool/team: Iowa\n\nPosition: SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-7, 215 lbs\n\nAge: 21, Junior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Sam Hauser\n\nPayton Sandfort recorded the first triple-double in Iowa men’s basketball history at Penn State, showing passing IQ and more aggression (18-of-19 FTs) than a typical shotmaking specialist. Shooting versatility and touch shots will still be Sandfort’s moneymakers in the NBA, but the ball-moving and toughness do make him more attractive and well-rounded for a supporting role.\n\n48. Orlando Magic: Melvin Ajinça\n\nPrevious mock draft spot: No. 45\n\nTeam: Saint-Quentin\n\nNationality: French\n\nPosition: SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-7\n\nAge: 19\n\nPro comparison: Evan Fournier\n\nBetween FIBA and LNB Pro A, there has been enough evidence of Melvin Ajinça’s shotmaking for teams to target it in the second round. They’ll just have to accept the idea that he may not offer much else in terms of creation, passing or defensive upside.\n\n49. Sacramento Kings: Izan Almansa\n\nPrevious mock draft spot: No. 50\n\nSchool/team: G League Ignite\n\nPosition: PF/C\n\nSize: 6-foot-10, 230 lbs\n\nAge: 18\n\nNationality: Spanish\n\nPro comparison: Goga Bitadze\n\nWhile Izan Almansa hasn’t flashed any skill or defensive trait that points to upside, he should generate second-round interest with an unteachable mix of size, good hands, touch and instincts for play-finishing.\n\nHe will be appealing to teams interested in adding frontcourt depth and interior activity.\n\n50. Washington Wizards (via Suns): Coleman Hawkins\n\nPrevious mock draft spot: No. 48\n\nSchool/team: Illinois\n\nPosition: PF\n\nSize: 6-foot-10, 225 lbs\n\nAge: 22, Senior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Georges Niang\n\nInterest in Coleman Hawkins will be driven by the appeal to his archetype as opposed to his upside. Plenty of teams will see value in adding a stretch-4 who can handle and pass.\n\n51. Detroit Pistons (via Knicks): Trey Alexander\n\nPrevious mock draft spot: No. 51\n\nSchool/team: Creighton\n\nPosition: SG\n\nSize: 6-foot-4, 190 lbs\n\nAge: 20, Junior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: E’Twaun Moore\n\nDespite Trey Alexander lacking any standout physical trait or specialty skill, teams in the Nos. 45-60 range may see too well-rounded of a guard to keep passing on. He’ll have a chance to stick in a backup 2-guard role with his three-level shotmaking, on- and off-ball shooting and improved secondary playmaking.\n\n52. Indiana Pacers (via Pelicans): Judah Mintz\n\nPrevious mock draft spot: No. 53\n\nSchool/team: Syracuse\n\nPosition: PG/SG\n\nSize: 6-foot-4, 185 lbs\n\nAge: 20, Sophomore\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Jaden Ivey\n\nJudah Mintz finished the regular season strong with four consecutive 20-plus-point games. Still, no signs of real 3-point improvement will keep the 6-foot-4 combo guard from climbing boards. Teams could still see a bargain in the 40s or 50s, given how effective he is attacking and using his quickness, shiftiness and gravity to set up teammates. Those strengths, paired with some tough two-point shotmaking, could help Mintz compensate for his limited range.\n\n53. Indiana Pacers (via Cavs): Johni Broome\n\nPrevious mock draft spot: No. 52\n\nSchool/team: Auburn\n\nPosition: C\n\nSize: 6-foot-10, 240 lbs\n\nAge: 21, Junior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Markieff Morris\n\nJohni Broome’s identity revolves around his physicality, toughness and interior defense. But he’s updated his game this year with improved shooting and passing to create a more modern look, versatility and ways to impact games.\n\n54. Indiana Pacers (via Bucks): Antonio Reeves\n\nPrevious mock draft spot: No. 55\n\nSchool/team: Kentucky\n\nPosition: SG\n\nSize: 6-foot-6, 195 lbs\n\nAge: 23, Senior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Gary Trent Jr.\n\nIt’s going to be tough for Antonio Reeves to show scouts anything in the postseason that he hasn’t consistently delivered throughout the year. Age will keep his name stuck in second-round tiers, but one of the draft’s most proven shotmakers should get an NBA opportunity. His 45.6% catch-and-shoot mark and 49 made floaters (52.7%) are the numbers to bet on for off-ball scoring.\n\n55. Los Angeles Lakers (via Clippers): DaRon Holmes II\n\nPrevious mock draft spot: No. 49\n\nSchool/team: Dayton\n\nPosition: C\n\nSize: 6-foot-10, 235 lbs\n\nAge: 21, Junior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Trayce Jackson-Davis\n\nThere is still room for Daron Holmes II to improve his stock in the postseason, as scouts continue to debate over the legitimacy and translation of his improved 3-point shot and face-up game. Maybe teams will see a teaching moment from last year’s draft when Trayce Jackson-Davis undeservingly slipped all the way into the 50s. Holmes has to convince executives there will be more to his game than just athletic finishing and post play.\n\n56. Denver Nuggets (via Timberwolves): Jalen Bridges\n\nPrevious mock draft spot: No. 58\n\nSchool/team: Baylor\n\nPosition: SF/PF\n\nSize: 6-foot-9, 225 lbs\n\nAge: 22, Senior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Dorian Finney-Smith\n\nJalen Bridges’ name is starting to surface in sleeper conversations, particularly after his 32-point game against Texas. He had his most convincing season as a shooter this year, and there is finally some real optimism starting to form over the 6-foot-9 forward’s three-and-D potential.\n\n57. Memphis Grizzlies (via Thunder): PJ Hall\n\nPrevious mock draft spot: No. 54\n\nTeam: Clemson\n\nNationality: American\n\nPosition: PF/C\n\nSize: 6-foot-10, 238 lbs\n\nAge: 22, Senior\n\nPro comparison: Dean Wade\n\nMore perimeter shotmaking has helped PJ Hall look better suited for the NBA, given teams’ limited interest in adding a post-up-heavy big. He doesn’t rebound or block shots at substantial rates, so Hall may have to convince a team that his shooting is real and he’s nimble enough to defend away from the basket.\n\n58. Dallas Mavericks (via Celtics): Blake Hinson\n\nPrevious mock draft spot: No. 57\n\nSchool/team: Pittsburgh\n\nPosition: SF\n\nSize: 6-foot-8, 230 lbs\n\nAge: 24, Senior\n\nNationality: American\n\nPro comparison: Julian Strawther\n\nScouts are expecting Blake Hinson to earn himself two-way contract offers from teams who see a shooting specialist. Regardless of what else does or doesn’t translate, it will be worth giving a look to a 6-foot-8 wing who’s made 106 threes in 31 games at a 42.4% clip.\n\nJonathan Wasserman is the lead scout and NBA Draft analyst for Bleacher Report.
