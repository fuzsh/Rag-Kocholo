        "text": "June 26, 2003\n\nNEW YORK - Maryland's all-time assists leader Steve Blake became the eighth Terrapin taken in the NBA Draft in the past five years when the Washington Wizards selected the point guard in the second round on Thursday. The experienced, four-year Terp floor general was taken with the 38th overall pick in the draft by the local ball club, announced at Madison Square Garden.\n\nBlake joins former Terp Juan Dixon on the Wizards, who averaged 15.4 minutes and 6.4 ppg after being taken with Washington's No. 17 first round pick a year ago.\n\n\"It's one of the best feelings I've ever had,\" said Blake, who watched the draft with family and friends at his grandparents' home in Miami Lakes, Fla. \"To be able to stay in the area, and play with Juan again -- it's a dream come true.\"\n\nBlake is the 28th draft choice Maryland head coach Gary Williams has coached in the 24 seasons combined at American University, Boston College, Ohio State and Maryland. Williams has coached 14 draft picks in 14 seasons at Maryland.\n\n\"No point guard in the country was responsible for more wins or more success than Steve Blake,\" said Williams of his 2003 senior tri-captain. \"He is an outstanding lead guard with the ability to push the ball upcourt and get it to the people who can score. There is definitely a place for Steve in the NBA.\"\n\nA four-year starter, Blake totaled 972 assists in his career and finished fifth all-time in NCAA history. He led the ACC in assists as a sophomore, junior and senior, and became the only player in ACC history with more than 1,000 points, 800 assists, 400 rebounds and 200 steals. Additionally, Blake set Maryland records for games started (136) and minutes played (4,312), and he is one of only 15 Terrapins all-time to have his jersey number honored in the rafters of Maryland's home arena.\n\nAs a senior, Blake was an AP honorable mention All-American, a first team All-ACC selection, a first team NABC all-district honoree, and a USBWA all-district team member. He was named the ACC's Player of the Week on Feb. 17, and along with backcourt partner Drew Nicholas, was selected as Maryland Basketball's Co-Player of the Year at the team's honors banquet on April 17.\n\nBlake has run the point for the Terps in each of Maryland's 103 victories over the past four seasons, which included wins in 75 percent of the Terps' games, four NCAA tournament berths, three Sweet 16 appearances, two trips to the Final Four and the national championship in 2002. Maryland finished in the ACC's Top 3 in each of the past four seasons, including the regular season championship in 2002. The Terps have achieved a final Top 10 ranking in the ESPN/USA Today coaches poll in each of the past three years, all with Blake at the helm.\n\nBlake's selection in the 2003 draft comes one year after three fellow national champs -- Chris Wilcox (No. 8/L.A. Clippers), Dixon (No. 17/Washington) and Lonny Baxter (No. 44/Chicago) -- were selected in the first two rounds and signed NBA contracts. Baxter averaged nearly 5 ppg in 12.4 minutes for the Bulls during his rookie season, while Wilcox spent much time sidelined by injury but averaged 3.7 ppg.\n\nTerence Morris was taken as the No. 34 pick in the second round in 2001 by Atlanta before being traded to Houston, while 1999 NBA Co-Rookie of the Year Steve Francis (No. 2/Vancouver), Obinna Ekezie (Vancouver) and Laron Profit (Orlando) were draft picks in 1999."
