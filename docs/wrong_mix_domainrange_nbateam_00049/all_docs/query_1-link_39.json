        "text": "With veteran point guard Derek Fisher and the Lakers no closer to reaching an agreement on a new contract Friday, the five-time NBA champion has accepted an invitation to meet today with Miami Heat president Pat Riley.\n\nFisher’s agent, Rob Pelinka, and Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak continue to have conversations about a new deal. Meanwhile, other teams, including the Heat, have begun to pursue the 35-year-old Fisher.\n\nRiley, in particular, reached out to Fisher personally, according to a league source. So did several new members of the Heat roster, a high-powered group believed to include LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.\n\nIn addition to the Heat, a newly minted NBA title contender in the wake of the decisions of James, Wade and Bosh to join forces, Chicago, Minnesota and New Jersey also are believed to be interested in Fisher.\n\nMoreover, Fisher has not ruled out a return to the Lakers, according to the source. Salary, the length of the contract, plus Fisher’s role and the ability of a team to be a title contender are among his criteria for signing.\n\nRecent reports in various media outlets that the Lakers were offering Fisher a one-season deal worth $2.5 million, with Fisher asking for two seasons at $10 million, are inaccurate, according to the source. Fisher made about $5 million last season.\n\nFisher helped guide the Lakers to their second consecutive championship with a victory last month over the Boston Celtics, the fifth title in seven Finals appearances in the 2000s for Fisher and the franchise.\n\nThe Lakers signed Steve Blake on Thursday with an eye toward using him as a backup to Fisher or as a replacement if a new deal cannot be struck with Fisher. Blake split last season with the Clippers and the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\n– Elliott Teaford\n\nThe Clippers took another step in assembling their 2010-11 roster.\n\nFree agent Brian Cook, a 6-foot-9, 234-pound forward drafted by the Lakers out of Illinois in 2003, signed with the Clippers. Terms were undisclosed.\n\nThe addition of Cook, who played in just 45 games (with Orlando and Houston) over the past two seasons, gives the Clippers eight players under contract.\n\nThat total is expected to elevate by three shortly when draft picks Al-Farouq Aminu, Willie Warren and Eric Bledsoe sign their first NBA contracts.\n\nCook was signed to provide depth behind projected starting power forward Blake Griffin. The 6-9 Aminu, expected to challenge for a starting job at small forward, could also play power forward.\n\nCook’s best NBA season came in 2005-06 with the Lakers, when he had career-best averages in minutes (19.0), points (7.9) and rebounds (3.4).\n\nCook connected on a career-best .429 behind the 3-point arc in 2005-06 and has a career percentage on 3s of .391.\n\nThe Clippers held their first summer league practices Friday. The team and staff depart for Las Vegas on Sunday with the team’s opening game coming at 7 p.m. Monday against the Washington Wizards.\n\n– Frank Burlison\n\nCook signs with Clippers\n\nAlso …\n\nCharlotte and restricted free-agent forward Tyrus Thomas came to terms on a five-year, $40 million contract. … New York Knicks president Donnie Walsh said he is not retiring, denying a New York Post report he might step down because of health problems and the disappointment of losing out on LeBron James. … Veteran guard Kyle Korver is following Carlos Boozer from Utah to Chicago after agreeing to sign with the Bulls, a person familiar with the situation said. ESPN reported Korver will get a three-year deal for about $15 million. … Atlanta signed first-round draft pick Jordan Crawford. His agent said the 6-4 guard agreed to a four-year deal that will pay him just more than $1million in his rookie season.\n\n– Associated Press"
