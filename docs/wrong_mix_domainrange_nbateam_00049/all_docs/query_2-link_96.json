        "text": "Steve Blake, 36, wants to play one more season, but in Detroit?\n\nSteve Blake can see the finish line of a career that began in 2003.\n\nThere will be time to spend with three young children.\n\nHe wants to remain in basketball — possibly trying to build a career in management.\n\nBut that time can wait one more year; he wants to return to the floor for a 14th season.\n\n“I feel like I have one more year in my body and then I’ll be ready to be home with my family,” Blake said. “I’ve got three young kids. This game and this schedule takes a lot away from your family.\n\n“I’m getting to that point where I’m ready to be around them some more.”\n\nBlake made his comments after the Cleveland Cavaliers completed a four-game sweep of the Detroit Pistons with a 100-98 victory April 24.\n\nBlake is an unrestricted free agent. Coach Stan Van Gundy said he is open to a return engagement.\n\nBut in the same season-ending news conference, Van Gundy said the team would seek to upgrade the backup point guard spot.\n\nBlake, 36, showed signs of age this past season.\n\nBut he would like to return to the Pistons.\n\n“I’ve been doing this for a long time, and I loved my experience here,” said Blake, who has played with seven other teams. “It was great playing for (Van Gundy), and I really love playing with these guys. If they wanted me back, I’d be thrilled, but you never know in this league. I’d love to play one more year. That’s my goal, but someone has to want me."
