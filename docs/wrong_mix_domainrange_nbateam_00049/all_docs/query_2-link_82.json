        "text": "When I decided to come to the University of Maryland, one of my major reasons was my love for our basketball team. I grew up in the area and attended games at Cole since I was five years old. We have come so far and accomplished so much as a program since the dark days of the late ’80s. Sadly, it seems lately the students at this school do not seem to understand who we are, where we came from and what this program is about.\n\nFirst you must know our history. After the tragic death of Len Bias, the university was under a black cloud of despair and shock. Soon after, coach Lefty Driesell resigned and was replaced with Dunbar high school’s Bob Wade. After several recruiting violations under the Wade administration, Maryland was under stiff NCAA sanctions. Wade was dismissed and we were banned from post-season play for two years, not to mention scholarship reductions. Enter Gary Williams! He came into a program that was dead and resurrected it.\n\nYou must know besides a post-season ban and reduced scholarships, Gary faced another obstacle. Controversy surrounded Wade, who was popular in the Baltimore area, and the university came out of the situation being deemed a racist program for firing Wade, who was black. No players from Baltimore, one of the nation’s hotbeds for basketball stars, wanted to play for Maryland. With all this facing Gary, he still turned it around with the great play of Walt Williams and then, coming out of the sanctions, landing Joe Smith a few years later. He also finally tapped into Baltimore after years of trying by signing Keith Booth. The rest, as you all know, is history.\n\nNow it seems Maryland has started sliding in recent years and students are jumping off the bandwagon like all those supposed Red Sox fans did during the last baseball post-season. Mainly, the unfounded criticism of Gary Williams is an issue, and students have shown utter ignorance regarding who we are as a program. I assure you no coach ever started so low and guided a team to the national championship. People like to make snide remarks about how Gary is a bad recruiter. This makes me and many faithful Maryland fans roll our eyes. Maryland is an underdog program, that’s how we like it down here and we intend to keep it that way. This concept is impossible for students from New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts to understand; however, it would be worthwhile for disbelievers to tone down their elitism for a second and think about it from our perspective.\n\nWe do not win with McDonald’s high school All-Americans – that’s what Duke does. Last time I looked in the mirror we were not Duke. Gary is the guy who found Steve Francis in a place no other coach would dare to look. We gave a skinny kid from Baltimore with bad grades and an overweight kid from Hargrave Military Academy a chance. Those two under-the-radar stars are now two of the all-time greats we know as Juan and Lonny. We like the selfless team-first attitude of the great Steve Blake. We are the Maryland Terrapins!\n\nIn recent years we have had our problems, such as the attitude of John Gilchrist and certain players not panning out. But if I could have one guy right this ship I would want it to be none other than Gary Williams, our coach. So for all you know-it-alls who think programs are made by blue-chip recruits only, get off www.scout.com and support your team. Here is a little food for thought: Danny Miller, Travis Garrison and Mike Jones were all McDonald’s high school All-Americans while Juan Dixon, Lonny Baxter, Joe Smith, Steve Francis and Steve Blake were not.\n\nWe will bounce back, that is certain. We will do it when Gary molds his new recruits into the kind of players he wants, team-first guys, hard-nosed hustlers and transition dynamos. And when we are back on top, the true fans will enjoy it so much more than all the nay-sayers!\n\nChris Oxenham is a junior business major. He can be reached at coxenham@umd.edu."
