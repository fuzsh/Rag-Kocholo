        "text": "July is National Ice Cream Month, a designation that reflects the popularity of ice cream and its importance to the restaurant business.\n\nGreater Springfield has a history of ice cream lore, with the Blake Brothers creating their iconic ice cream brand here in Springfield, and Steve Herrell, a super-premium ice cream pioneer, using his Northampton shop to popularize the ice cream “mix-ins” process he had earlier developed.\n\nNow two Miami-based entrepreneurs, Daniel Golik and David Leonardo, are taking customized ice cream experiences to a new level with their 15-location Chill-N Nitrogen Ice Cream chain.\n\nChill-N Nitrogen Ice Cream uses the intense “cold power” of liquid nitrogen to create ice cream to-order. Since the liquid nitrogen freezing process is extremely quick (less than a minute), the resultant frozen product has an ultra-fine crystalline structure, a characteristic which makes the ice cream dense and smooth-textured.\n\nThe liquid nitrogen process can also be tweaked to offer “ice creams” beyond those made with traditional dairy formulations. Frozen treats can be based on yogurt, coconut milk, almond milk, or oat milk.\n\nTo make an individual portion, flavorings like chocolate or vanilla are mixed into the customer-selected base, liquid nitrogen is introduced to freeze the dessert, then traditional mix-ins such as crushed candies, berries, or granola are folded in. Chill-N Nitrogen shops offer 30-plus such mix-in options.\n\nThanks to the speed and versatility of the liquid nitrogen process, Chill-N can efficiently produce a frozen dessert customized to each individual patron’s preferences.\n\nChill-N Nitrogen Ice Cream currently has locations in Florida, Texas, and Tennessee and, as it refines its technology, is continuing to recruit franchisees in those states.\n\nOn its YouTube channel Nation’s Restaurant News has posted an interview with the chain’s management team. That interview can be watched online.\n\n**********\n\nSide Dishes:\n\nBelchertown’s Cultural Council is sponsoring another Food Truck Friday on July 19, from 4-8 p.m., on the Belchertown Town Common.\n\nEight different food trucks are slated to be on hand, including Birds Nest Italian Street Food, Macken’s Sliders, Thai Chili, and Batch Ice Cream.\n\nLive entertainment and games will be part of the fun as well.\n\nThe Belchertown Cultural Council can be reached at 413-813-5207.\n\n**********\n\nLike many of its competitors, Chicago-based McDonald’s Corp. continues to develop promotions designed to drive customers to digital ordering channels.\n\nThe most recent of these is the hamburger giant’s limited-time-only introduction of “Special Grade Garlic Sauce,” a condiment and flavor enhancer that’s based on the black garlic sauce available in Japan-based McDonald’s locations.\n\nDescribed as tangy-sweet with flavor notes of soy and garlic, the sauce is free upon request with any digital order placed through the McDonald’s app.\n\n**********\n\nThe All-American Bar, Grill & Patio in downtown Springfield is offering a special lunchtime deal during the month of July. On weekdays, except Tuesdays, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., the All-American’s “Summer Score” promotion offers 20% off on lunch.\n\nThe menu at the All-American can be viewed online; the establishment answers at 413-301-8337.\n\n**********\n\nDunkin’, the coffee shop and snack brand, has turned to campfire traditions for its summertime inspiration, introducing several s’mores-flavored limited-time-only offerings.\n\nA Bonfire S’mores Frozen Coffee brings pairs iced coffee with s’mores and vanilla flavored syrups; whipped cream and graham cracker crumbles top the drink.\n\nThe Dunkin’s S’mores Cold Brew is similarly garnished with marshmallow cold foam and graham cracker crumbles.\n\nAs a coffee go-with, the S’mores Donut has been brought back. It’s filled with marshmallow cream and chocolate icing.\n\nHot Honey Bacon is making a summer season appearance and is available as either a “snackin’” side order or in a Hot Honey Bacon Sandwich, where the honey-drizzled bacon keeps company on a brioche bun with an egg and white cheddar cheese.\n\n**********\n\nIn an announcement that might inspire some to respond with “what can they be thinking?”, streaming giant Netflix last month revealed that it will be opening two mall-based Netflix House “entertainment concept” locations.\n\nThe venues, which will open in 2025, will be screening Netflix series and film content as well as offering merchandise and dining. The dining experiences will be inspired by the handiwork of various celebrity chefs and mixologists that have appeared on the streaming service.\n\nMenu specifics and operational details for the two Netflix House locations, which are in Dallas and King of Prussia, PA, respectively, have yet to be announced.\n\n**********\n\nChampney’s Restaurant & Tavern at the Deerfield Inn will hos a Christmas in July Dinner on Tuesday, July 23, from 5-7 p.m.\n\nSanta and Mrs. Claus will be table-hopping throughout the event, which features Champney’s regular menu as well as an extensive selection of meal options for kids. Tuesday is also a $16 Burger night at Champney’s.\n\nReservations for the Christmas in July Dinner are strongly encouraged. They can be made by calling 413-774-5587.\n\n**********\n\nOakholm Brewing Company in Brookfield is hosting its annual Summerfest on July 20 and 21.\n\nThe Saturday portion of the celebration will run from noon to 9 p.m. with four food trucks in attendance. Live music and an artisan market will part of the fun.\n\nOn Sunday, the Summerfest will be open from noon until 6 p.m. with food trucks, music and more.\n\nA listing of brews on tap at Oakholm is always available online.\n\nAdmission is free, and more information about the Summerfest is available at 413-272-9620.\n\n**********\n\nHarry Potter fans, take note!\n\nWOB Bar & Kitchen in West Hartford, Conn., is hosting a Wizarding World of Beer Brunch on Saturday, July 27.\n\nFor more details about this Hogwarts-inspired event, contact World of Beer Bar & Kitchen at 860-904-2124.\n\n**********\n\nPoland Culinary Vacations has organized a May 2025 Culinary Adventure, with an itinerary featuring visits to Krakow and Zakpane.\n\nPoland Culinary Vacations specializes in small group tours to Poland, with tours planned to take in various events such as the Krakow Pierogi Festival each August, the Annual Polish Pottery Festival in Boleslawiec, and the Winobranie Wine Festival in September.\n\nThe tours, which are fully escorted, focus on connecting with local inhabitants and experiencing the best in Polish food.

Topped with roasted potatoes, bacon, green onions, garlic, and mozzarella, the flatbread is one of the several new items available. These include an Irish Cobb Salad, which features Swiss cheese and corned beef.\n\nPadilla has also added a number of house-made desserts to the restaurant’s bill of fare; his Bailey’s Buttercream Brownie is an example.\n\nReservations for the Irish House Restaurant can be made by calling 413-342-4358."
