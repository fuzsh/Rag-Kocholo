        "text": "The term \"mine disaster\" historically has been applied to mine accidents claiming five or more lives. Mine disasters, in this sense, once were appallingly common. For instance, the single year of 1907 saw 18 coal mine disasters, plus two more disasters in the metal and nonmetal mining industry. Among the disasters in 1907 was history's worst--the Monongah coal mine explosion, which claimed 362 lives and impelled Congress to created the Bureau of Mines.\n\nMine accidents have declined dramatically in number and severity through decades of research, technology, and preventive programs. Today, mine accidents resulting in five or more deaths are no longer common. However, preventing recurrence of disasters like those of the past remains a top priority requiring constant vigilance by management, labor, and government.\n\nStatistical Summary\n\nHistoric Period Coal Mines Metal and Nonmetal Mines Total Through 1875 19 4 23 1876-1900 101 17 118 1901-1925 305 51 356 1926-1950 147 23 170 1951-1975 35 9 44 1976-present 18 1 18\n\nYear with largest number of coal mine disasters: 1909 (20 coal mine disasters)\n\nYear with largest number of metal/nonmetal mine disasters: 1911 (8 metal/nonmetal mine disasters)\n\nYear with largest number of mine disasters overall: 1910 (25 mine disasters-19 coal, 6 metal/nonmetal)\n\nListing Of Selected Historic Mine Disasters\n\nCoal Mines\n\nAll accidents with five or more fatalities, since 1970\n\nYEAR DAY MINE LOCATION TYPE DEATHS 2010 4/05 Upper Big Branch Mine-South, Performance Coal Company Raleigh County, Montcoal, West Virginia Ignition or Explosion of Gas or Dust 29 2007 8/06 Crandall Canyon Mine, Genwal Resources Inc.
