        "text": "Facts\n\nTo protest the Vietnam War and support a proposal for a Christmas truce, five children in Des Moines, Iowa chose to wear black armbands to their schools. John Tinker and Christopher Eckhardt wore them to a high school, Mary Beth Tinker wore it to a junior high school, and Hope and Paul Tinker wore them to elementary school. In an attempt to pre-empt this action, the principals of the schools implemented a policy that would require children in school to remove armbands. If they refused to comply, they would be suspended and sent home until they did.\n\nThe two children who wore the armbands to elementary school received no penalty, but the other three were suspended on the basis of their armbands for the duration of the protest. In conjunction with the ACLU and the state Civil Liberties Union, the parents of the Tinkers challenged the action of the school board in federal district court. Its decision upholding the policy was sustained when the Eighth Circuit deadlocked in its review, which resulted in a direct appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nOpinions\n\nMajority\n\nAbe Fortas (Author)\n\nEarl Warren\n\nWilliam Orville Douglas\n\nWilliam Joseph Brennan, Jr.\n\nByron Raymond White\n\nThurgood Marshall\n\nThe majority asserted that the First Amendment protected the speech and expressive conduct of children in public schools, which meant that any policy restricting speech would need to be justified on constitutional grounds. While a school board will receive some deference from courts, it must be able to cite something more than discomfort, awkwardness, or inconvenience as a basis for restricting speech. A concern that the speech or expressive conduct would interfere with school discipline is an example of a justification that probably would persuade a court to uphold a policy rationally connected to that concern. In this situation, however, wearing the armbands did not undermine school discipline, so the policy was unconstitutional.\n\nConcurrence\n\nPotter Stewart (Author)\n\nConcurrence\n\nByron Raymond White (Author)\n\nDissent\n\nHugo Lafayette Black (Author)\n\nBlack voiced his disagreement with the entire line of Supreme Court jurisprudence that had permitted the First Amendment to protect expressive conduct. He thought that it should be strictly limited to speech alone. Also, he agreed with the school board that wearing the arm bands was disruptive and interfered with discipline.\n\nDissent\n\nJohn Marshall Harlan II (Author)\n\nHarlan found nothing in the evidence regarding the policy to suggest that the school board had an improper motive in deciding to implement it.\n\nCase Commentary\n\nEven if a topic is controversial, and some disruption may occur, expressive conduct is protected by the First Amendment. This decision is somewhat surprising because courts usually show greater deference to schools, based on their importance in helping children grow into disciplined, mature adults. Decisions since Tinker have taken a more restrictive view of free speech rights in this setting."
