        "text": "3. Results\n\n3.1. Study participants\n\nFigure shows a schematic representation of the number of individuals in the various investigations. Table presents demographic data of the study participants. The proportion of women was higher in the control group than in the cohort due to a higher participation rate among the female control subjects than among the female AAT-deficient subjects. The median body mass index (BMI) was somewhat higher in the PiSZ group than in the PiZZ and control group (PiMM) but the differences were not statistically significant (Table ).\n\n3.2. Liver function tests\n\nDue to different reference intervals for men and women regarding some of the liver function tests, the results of the liver function tests were analyzed separately in the male and female Pi subgroups. The results are shown in Table for men and in Table for women. A PiSZ man with a known, advanced stage of alcohol abuse had the highest plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, GGT, and bilirubin (Table ). When the liver function tests with common reference intervals for both genders were analyzed in men and women together, the median bilirubin level was significantly higher in the PiZZ subjects than in the PiMM subjects (9 μmol/L [range 3–23] vs 7 μmol/L [range 4–33]), P = 0.048. Fifteen (17%) of the PiZZ, 6 (19%) of the PiSZ, and 7 (8%) of the PiMM individuals had at least 1 elevated liver enzyme (P = 0.055).\n\n3.3. Medication, contraceptives, nutrition supplements, and diagnoses\n\nSeven women were under treatment with levothyroxine substitution (2 PiSZ and 5 PiMM), 5 individuals were under treatment with immunosuppressive treatment (1 PiZZ woman for pelvospondylitis, 1 PiZZ man for ulcerative colitis, 1 PiMM man for rheumatoid arthritis, 1 PiMM man for Mb Crohn, and 1 PiSZ man for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis). Seventy one individuals (24 PiZZ, 38 PiMM, and 9 PiSZ) were being treated with over-the-counter medication, prescribed medication or contraceptives that may affect liver transaminases. In the PiZZ women on medication which potentially affects liver transaminases, the median GGT was 0.52 μkat/L (range 0.3–1.3) as compared to 0.44 μkat/L (range 0.23–1.1) in the PiMM women on the corresponding treatment (P = 0.023). When only contraceptive treatment was included in the analysis, the difference was still significant (P = 0.047).\n\n3.4. Liver stiffness measured by acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography\n\nThe results of the ARFI elastography in the male and female subgroups are shown in Tables and , respectively. The median stiffness in the right liver lobe was significantly higher in the PiZZ men than in the PiSZ men (P = 0.032) and PiMM men (P = 0.037) (Table ). When the individuals with BMI ≥30 were excluded from the statistical analysis, the difference was significant only between the PiZZ and PiMM men (P = 0.046, see Table ).\n\nNo significant differences in liver stiffness were found between the female Pi subgroups (Table ).\n\nThe results of liver stiffness were stratified into liver disease stages according to the previously published SWV cut-offs, that is, 1.30 m/s for liver fibrosis and 1.80 m/s for liver cirrhosis, see Table .[24] No significant differences were found in the proportion of subjects with values indicating liver fibrosis or liver cirrhosis between the Pi subgroups as a whole, nor in the female or male subgroups, see Table .\n\nNo significant differences were found in the median values of liver function tests or the use of medication influencing liver function between the subjects with SWV above and those with SWV below the cut-offs for liver fibrosis/cirrhosis. None of the study participants had clinical signs of liver fibrosis or cirrhosis by visual assessment of the liver using ultrasound. Three PiZZ (9%), 3 PiSZ (21%), and 3 PiMM subjects (6%) had increased echogenicity indicating liver steatosis as judged by visual assessment of the liver (ns). There was no relationship between liver steatosis and increased values of SWV. The PiSZ man with known alcohol abuse did not participate in the AFRI elastography examination.\n\nThere was a significant correlation between liver stiffness and BMI (P < 0.001) and between liver stiffness and ALP (P < 0.001), see Fig. . No significant correlations were found between liver stiffness and the other liver enzymes.\n\n3.5. AUDIT questionnaire\n\nThe results of the AUDIT scores are shown in Table . Because the risk consumption of alcohol differs between men and women, the results of the AUDIT were analyzed separately. The proportion of subjects with risk consumption was higher among the PiZZ men than among the PiMM men. In contrast, the proportion of PiMM women with risk consumption was higher than that of PiZZ women. However, the differences were not statistically significant. No significant correlations were found between alcohol consumption, liver function tests, BMI, or liver stiffness.\n\n3.6. Results for PiZZ subjects with neonatal liver disease\n\nTen of the 18 PiZZ individuals with neonatal liver disease participated in the present follow-up. Five individuals had an AUDIT-score indicating risk consumption; 6 individuals had a BMI indicating slight overweight. All of them had essentially normal liver function test results, see Table . Because only 2 women with neonatal liver disease participated in the study, the results are presented for men and women together. No significant differences were found in comparison with PiZZ subjects without neonatal liver disease. None of them had any current diagnosis of liver disease.\n\n3.7. Causes of death in the deceased AAT-deficient subjects\n\nOne PiZZ woman died due to acute bacterial meningitis at the age of 36 years. One PiSZ man with known drug and alcohol abuse died at the age of 37 years after a drug overdose. The autopsy in both of these cases revealed a normal liver configuration. Of the other 2 PiSZ cases, 1 woman suffered from liver cirrhosis due to alcohol overconsumption and died secondary to acute hepato-renal syndrome at the age of 37, and 1 woman died at the age of 38 due to acute myocardial inflammation and the autopsy showed an enlarged liver (3050 gr).\n\n4. Discussion\n\nOur results show that at the age of 37 to 40 years, the PiZZ men have significantly higher levels of GGT and bilirubin, and higher liver stiffness assessed by ARFI elastography than the PiMM men. No significant differences in liver function test results and ARFI were found between PiZZ and PiMM women.\n\nGGT is considered to be a sensitive marker for detecting and monitoring liver affection.[25] Contraceptives, some of the prescribed medications, some of the over-the-counter medications, and dietary supplements may cause atoxic elevation of liver transaminases. In the present study, the PiZZ women who were being treated with medication influencing liver enzymes, including oral contraceptives, had higher plasma GGT than the PiMM women with corresponding treatment. Similar results were found at the age of 30, but not at the age of 34.[12,13] However, until the age of 37 to 40, none of the PiZZ women has shown any clinical signs of liver affection. Furthermore, no differences were found in other liver function tests or in ARFI elastography. It remains unclear whether these differences predict future liver disease.\n\nAt the 30-year follow-up, significantly higher levels of AST were found in both PiZZ and PiSZ subjects in comparison with the control group.[12] At the 34-year follow-up, the PiZZ individuals had significantly higher mean GGT and albumin than the control group.[13] In both of these previous check-ups, the results of liver function tests were analyzed in men and women together. In the present study, we analyzed the results separately in men and women because of the different reference intervals, and because the gender proportion was not the same among the AAT-deficient and control groups.\n\nPIII-NP is a marker of collagen turnover, and its serum level is considered to be a reliable indicator of hepatic fibrosis in both alcohol and drug-induced liver damage.[26] We did not find any significant differences in PIII-NP between the Pi subgroups (see Tables and ). Boffa et al[27] have repeated measurements of PIII-NP in patients with psoriasis who were being treated with Methotrexate. They found that a single PIII-NP test could not be considered as a predictor of the development of abnormal histopathology of the liver, but repeated normal levels indicated a low risk of significant liver damage.\n\nIn this cohort, PIII-NP has previously only been analyzed at the age of 8, 12, and 16 years. At the age of 12, both PiZZ and PiSZ children had significantly higher PIII-NP than the age matched controls, but at the age of 16, no significant differences were found.[9,10] In adulthood, PIII-NP has not been analyzed in this cohort, and therefore no conclusions can be drawn from our results with normal levels at the present follow-up. It is important to repeat the analysis of PIII-NP at the future follow-ups of the cohort.\n\nARFI elastography is a new, noninvasive method for detecting and monitoring fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver.[18,19] We found increased liver stiffness in the PiZZ men in comparison with PiMM men, but no significant differences were found in the female subgroups. Unexpectedly, a high proportion of the study subjects had elevated values of SWV that may indicate liver fibrosis and cirrhosis according to the previously published cut-offs (Table ).[23] However, the possible presence of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis was similar in all Pi subgroups, both among the men and the women. These results were an isolated finding, because no other clinical or laboratory parameters differed significantly between the subjects with elevated SWV and those with SWV below the cut-off for liver fibrosis/cirrhosis. Furthermore, visual assessment of the liver parenchyma by ultrasound did not reveal any liver disease, and none of the subjects with elevated SWV values shown any signs of liver steatosis. It remains unclear, why we found elevated values of liver stiffness in these asymptomatic, AAT-deficient and healthy control subjects.\n\nPreviously published studies have shown good correlations between the result of ARFI measurements and stages of fibrosis determined by biopsy,[21] which is considered to be the most reliable method for assessing hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. However, liver biopsy is an invasive procedure with potentially serious complications. In these asymptomatic, AAT-deficient subjects, we did not find that liver biopsy would be ethically justified. This decision was made before the study start, that is, before we had knowledge of the results of elevated liver stiffness in a high proportion of both AAT-deficient and control subjects.\n\nThe ARFI result showed a strong correlation with BMI and was also correlated with ALP, but not with other liver function parameters (Fig. A, B). To our knowledge, this is the first study in which this method is used to assess liver stiffness in asymptomatic, AAT-deficient individuals.\n\nThe PiSZ phenotype is not considered to be a risk factor for liver disease, and none of the PiSZ children in this cohort had clinical signs of liver disease early in life.[8] However, 2 of the 3 PiSZ individuals who had died before the age of 38 years had pathological changes in the liver as seen in the autopsy. They had known alcohol abuse and both had liver cirrhosis, and 1 was on the waiting list for liver transplantation. Whether the liver pathology was caused only by alcohol or whether these individuals are more vulnerable to alcohol than the general population remains unclear. At the present check-up, 1 PiSZ man had an advanced stage of alcohol abuse. He also had elevated liver function tests. Nevertheless, except for a significantly higher GGT in PiSZ men compared with the PiMM men, no other significant differences were found in liver function tests or AFRI elastography between the PiSZ and PiMM subjects.\n\nOnly 1 PiZZ woman has died after the age of 8 years. She was 36 years of age, and the cause of death was acute meningitis. All remaining PiZZ individuals are alive, and none of those participating in the present follow-up suffered from liver disease. Their liver function tests were essentially within the normal range (Tables and ). Also the PiZZ subjects who suffered from liver disease early in life had normal liver function test results (Table ). Thus, our results show that the prognosis of liver function in the PiZZ individuals identified by neonatal screening seems to be good up to 37 to 40 years of age.\n\nThere are some limitations in our study. Due to long distances or their social situation, not all AAT-deficient subjects were able to visit Malmö. A common reason for not participating was well-being. Despite the fact that many of them visited their local hospitals where the liver function tests were analyzed, the participation rate was relatively low, which may have influenced the results. The ARFI elastography was performed in the afternoon, and thus the subjects were not in correct fasting condition, only having fasted for a minimum of 3 hours. The diagnoses were self-reported, and therefore we cannot exclude that some subjects had undiagnosed liver disease.\n\nIn conclusion, at the age of 37 to 40 years the PiZZ and PiSZ individuals identified by neonatal screening have normal plasma levels of liver function tests and PIII-NP. However, bilirubin, GGT, and liver stiffness, as assessed by AFRI elastography, differ significantly between the PiZZ and the PiMM men."
