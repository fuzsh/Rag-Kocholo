Brady Saunders Boy Scout Reservation, where for six years he touched the lives of thousands of young men as he continued his education. He started his pastoral ministry at Corinth United Methodist Church in Goochland, Va., and was Pastor of Brookland United Methodist Church, Richmond, Va., upon his death.\n\nDickie never met a stranger and was never one to say, “I don’t have time for that.” When asked, “How are you?” his response was always, “Mah-velous.” He had the gift of patience and his fondest wish in life was that we all love Jesus and love one another.There will be a Celebration of Life at Grace Church (2240 Cranbeck Road, Richmond, Va. 23235) on Saturday, April 10, at 11 a.m. Everyone is asked to wear a mask and practice social distancing.

Mary Murton Wilkins of Ashburn, Virginia, beloved sister, aunt, and friend to many, passed on Saturday morning the 27th of February.\n\nMary was born in Quicksburg, Virginia on October the 4th, 1939 to parents Gilbert F. and Mabel H. Wilkins. While growing up, Mary excelled athletically in school, and was very involved in her church youth group. She also developed an interest in music and learned to play the piano, trumpet, and guitar, and played violin in her high school orchestra and the French horn in band.\n\nMary was inspired from an early age to pursue work in the church, and possessed a self-confidence in public speaking and the ability to lead. However, these aspirations were tempered, as she would need to put herself through college at a time where few, if any, female role models in the clergy existed. Mary worked in a bank in Washington, D.C., and saved enough to attend Ferrum Junior College, a small United Methodist college in southwest Virginia, where she flourished academically and held several key leadership positions in student government and campus organizations.\n\nIt was at Ferrum where Mary participated in a program in which pre-ministerial students preached and conducted worship in small rural churches which were without a regular minister. This experience confirmed Mary’s interest in entering the ministry. She subsequently transferred to American University, where she received her Bachelor of Art’s degree in Sociology. Afterward, she enrolled in Wesley Theological Seminary and later graduated with a Master of Divinity degree in 1969.\n\nWhile attending Wesley in 1968, Mary was ordained a Deacon in the United Methodist Church and, as such, was the first female seminary graduate ordained in the Virginia Conference – a true trailblazer paving the way for others.\n\nFollowing seminary, she was appointed by the Bishop to serve as the minister of two small churches, thirty-five to forty miles south of Washington, D.C. It was during this assignment, which included working with complex family problems, that Mary became engaged in and developed a passion for pastoral counseling. This introduced her to opportunities in Clinical Pastoral Education (CPE), and eventually led her to a career with Rush-Presbyterian St. Luke’s Medical Center and later with Swedish Covenant Hospital, both in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nAlong the way, Mary’s adventures took her to faraway places such as India and South Africa, where she was able to experience new and interesting cultures while sharing her passion for the ministry.\n\nAfter retirement, Mary returned to Virginia in 2010, where she spent her time engaged in golfing, gardening, and learning sign language while living at Ashby Ponds Community. She is survived by sisters Phyllis Hughitt and Barbara Bonner, and brother Ed Wilkins, and their extended families. Mary will be deeply missed by her family, and remembered by a close friend who said “she drives like the devil and preaches like an angel.”\n\nA private service was held on March 6. Burial was held at Zirkle Cemetery, New Market VA on Sunday afternoon, March 7.\n\nMrs. Phyllis Nuckols, February 27, 2021\n\nPhyllis Nuckols died on February 27, 2021, at the age of 86.

At the age of seventeen, he was called to and began preparation for the Christian Ministry, completing studies at Randolph-Macon College (Ashland, VA) and the Candler School of Theology at Emory University (Atlanta, GA). He served student pastorates in college and seminary and began full-time ministry on the Batesville Methodist Charge in Albemarle and Nelson Counties (VA), followed by the West Hanover Charge in Hanover (VA). In 1947, he met and married his devoted wife, Martha, with whom he shared his life and his ministry.\n\nWarner was also a Chaplain in the U.S. Naval Reserves and was recalled to active duty at the time of the Korean War.

His ministry there of eighteen years concluded with the building of a nursing wing, the Via Health Care Center. He was then named Director of Development for the Virginia United Methodist Homes system.\n\nWarner’s life came full circle in 1983 when Bishop Robert Blackburn called him to his Cabinet as the District Superintendent of his beloved Eastern Shore. He served as DS for five years before retiring and moving to Roanoke, VA, where he served interim ministries at Melrose, Southview, and Boones Mill United Methodist Churches.\n\nWarner’s ministry extended beyond the local church, serving on the boards and agencies of the United Methodist Church and several civic organizations. He was a member of the Board of Directors of the Charlottesville Chamber of Commerce, the Virginia Conference Credit Union, the Virginia United Methodist Foundation, and a Trustee of Virginia Wesleyan College and Ferrum College. He also served as Chaplain, Roanoke Chapter, and State Chaplain of the Military Order of World Wars (MOWW.)\n\nIn retirement, Warner enjoyed gardening, carpentry, extensive writing, and spending quality time with family, friends, and his dear cat, Oscar. He will be remembered for the 101 bluebird houses he built to give to family and friends and the thousands of letters he wrote. His deepest regret in life was to have never been a published author. For those of us who were the fortunate recipients of his many letters, his words will forever be published in our hearts.\n\nWarner’s contributions to the United Methodist Church in Virginia, the Hermitage in Richmond and the Virginia United Methodist Homes system (now Pinnacle Living) are immeasurable. It was his honor to participate in the Richmond Hermitage’s 70th anniversary in September of 2018 at the age of 98. He was an active resident at the Hermitage in Roanoke until his death.\n\nWarner is survived by two daughters, Beth Snead (Bob), and Nell Bodine, whose hearts are broken but rejoice in the heavenly reunion of their parents.

At age sixteen she was diagnosed and led by Dr. Garland Dyches to MCV hospital where she discovered that she had miraculously survived a deadly condition and the first to have open heart surgery to correct it.

He served for 20 years in the Belgian Congo (which became the Republic of Zaire) in Central Africa. In Zaire, he was a teacher, a builder, and a school principal. He was co-founder of IDIAS, a technical high school. He supervised the construction of residences, schools, dormitories, churches, clinics, and installed and maintained water and electrical systems for 32 village stations.

After returning to America, Stan served one year in the National Headquarters of the Board of Global Ministries in New York City as Missionary-in-Residence, and then was Missionary-Interpreter-in-Residence, serving the seven states of the South Central Jurisdiction doing mission interpretation and promotion for two years.\n\nStan married Patricia Joanne (Dutro) from Eaton, Indiana in 1960 in Nyadiri, Rhodesia, having evacuated to Nyadiri two weeks prior to their wedding due to civil unrest. This didn’t stop their wedding and they served together in Zaire for more than 20 years. Stan and Joanne had four children: Alan Maughlin (Monica Gonzales), Carla Maughlin, Curtis Maughlin (Glenn Heueser) and Loren Maughlin, and their home was often full of their eight grandchildren: Yasmine (Mark Elliott), Mateo, Samantha, Maria, Cassidy, Dylan, Addison and Nathan; and two great granddaughters: Charlie Rose and Lilah Gray Elliott.\n\nAfter his service in Africa, Stan continued his teaching in colleges and high schools across the country, including Kansas and Kentucky, before settling in Falls Church in 1996. In Northern Virginia Stan capped his work career by lending his talents to many non-profit organizations, most often focusing on homeless needs and shelters.\n\nStan and Joanne were long-time members of Dulin United Methodist Church, where Joanne became an Ordained Deacon. They later joined Charles Wesley and Christ Crossman United Methodist Churches.\n\nStan amazed all those fortunate enough to interact with him, whether it was running the family farm as a young man or obtaining his private pilot’s license; speaking Otetela, French, and Swahili; travelling in Western Europe and Central Africa; or volunteering as a fireman for 3 years in Kentucky; and he was awarded the ‘Alumni Citation’ for meritorious service in Zaire by his Alma Mater, Sterling College.\n\nStan was a friend to many and it was often said, “he never met a stranger.” He loved to invite people home to enjoy a great meal at his Falls Church home for 30 plus years with his beloved wife of 60 years, Joanne.\n\nStan, known as “Uwandji Lukamba”, will be deeply missed by his family and those he befriended.

Deborah Lewis (United Methodist campus minister at The Wesley Foundation at The University of Virginia), surrounded by family, died peacefully of Parkinson’s Disease on Thursday, August 19, in Williamsburg, VA.\n\nDudley was born July 6, 1942, in Brunswick County, Virginia, to Dudley Barksdale Lewis and Blanche Rawlings Daniel Lewis. He grew up the eldest of three, farming tobacco, and lettering in three sports at Brunswick High School. His parents placed a high value on education, and he became the first in his immediate family to attend college, graduating from The University of Virginia in 1965 with a Bachelor of Electrical Engineering degree. During college, he played on the baseball team his first year and pledged the then-new chapter of Pi Kappa Phi fraternity.\n\nWorking at the General Services Administration in Washington, D.C., after graduation, Dudley joined the College & Career group at Corkran Methodist Church in Temple Hills, MD, where he met his wife, Sharon Kaye Allender. They were married in 1966 in a double wedding along with Sharon’s twin sister Carol Lee Allender and her husband William Franklin Shutt. Dudley and Sharon moved to the Peninsula when he accepted a position at Newport News Shipbuilding. Dudley served in the Virginia Army National Guard on weekends and received his Master’s degree in Business Administration in 1971 from The College of William & Mary, through night school. After the Shipyard, Dudley worked for Malcom Pirnie and Siemens Automotive. He obtained his Professional Engineer license in 1971 and was a Certified Quality Engineer through the American Society for Quality Control. With his wife, Dudley made a home first in Hampton, where their two children were born, and then in Williamsburg.\n\nThough the Tidewater and Williamsburg communities were never as tightly knit as his beloved Brunswick County, Dudley made friends wherever he went, exemplified the life of a good neighbor, and demonstrated a commitment to community service. He was defeated in his run for the Virginia House of Delegates in 1977, but served the Republican Party of Virginia in many roles, including as First District Committee Chair and as a member of the State Central Committee from 1980-1990. Over the years, Dudley served on the Mental Health and Mental Retardation Services Board for Hampton-Newport News, the Virginia Board of Behavioral Science, the Heritage Girl Scout Council, and the Board of the Wesley Foundation at William & Mary. He coached Little League Baseball and Basketball. He was a lifelong Methodist, most recently as a member of Williamsburg United Methodist Church. Dudley was a member and Past Master of Williamsburg Masonic Lodge No. 6. He was a member of the Scottish Rite Southern Jurisdiction, the Khedive Temple A.A.O.N.M.S., and a Past President of the Williamsburg Shrine Club.\n\nIn his retirement, Dudley reveled in watching UVA sports and attending class and fraternity reunions. He and Sharon had a special fondness for trips to visit Hilton Head, South Carolina. Dudley was able to indulge his love of history and family through his genealogical research, writing, and local county courthouse trips. He was proud of the long tenure and the many branches of his family tree in Virginia, and became a member of the Jamestowne Society. He faced the challenges of Parkinson’s with dignity and grit, strapping on boxing gloves for workouts with the Rock Steady Boxing crew.\n\nDudley is survived by his wife of 54 years, Sharon; his daughter Rev. Deborah Ellen Lewis and her husband Roger Woodson Sherman and stepson Blair Philip Sherman of Charlottesville, VA; and his son David Brian Lewis and his wife Amy Lynn Koeppen Lewis of Sarasota, FL.
