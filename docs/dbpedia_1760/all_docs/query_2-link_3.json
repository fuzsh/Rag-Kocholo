        "text": "This is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\nThere have been many thousands of friendly fire incidents in recorded military history, accounting for an estimated 2% to 20% of all casualties in battle.[1][2] The examples listed below illustrate their range and diversity, but this does not reflect increasing frequency. The rate of friendly fire, once allowance has been made for the numbers of troops committed to battle, has remained remarkably stable, and unimproved, over the past 200 years.[3]\n\nWars of the Roses\n\n[edit]\n\n1471 – During the Battle of Barnet a Lancastrian force under the Earl of Oxford was fired on by the Lancastrian centre while returning from a pursuit; their banner, Oxford's \"star with rays\" had been mistaken for the Yorkist \"sun in splendour\". This gave rise to cries of treachery (always a possibility in that chaotic period), Lancastrian morale collapsed, and the battle was lost.\n\nEnglish Civil War\n\n[edit]\n\n1643 – Following the fall of Gainsborough, Lincolnshire to Roundhead forces, captured Royalist commander, the Earl of Kingston, was killed by Royalist cannon fire when the boat transporting him to Hull was fired on from the banks of the River Trent.[4]\n\nNine Years' War\n\n[edit]\n\n1690 – Two French regiments accidentally attacked each other during the Battle of Fleurus, which led to the practice of attaching a white scarf to the flags of the regiments.[5]\n\nFrench and Indian War\n\n[edit]\n\nJuly 9, 1755 – Two main phases of friendly fire occurred during the Battle of the Monongahela, which halted the Braddock Expedition after French regulars, French militia and Indians joined battle with them before Fort Duquesne. In the obscuring woodland conditions and confusion caused by the French musket fire and the Native Americans' war cries, several British platoons fired at each other. Later in the battle many British American soldiers fled from more exposed ground and into woods, where British soldiers fired on them mistaking them for advancing French infantry.[6]\n\nNovember 12, 1758 – Friendly fire occurred near Fort Ligonier, resulting \"in the accidental death of many of George Washington's fellow Virginians under his command, while also resulting in the capture of French prisoners who provided intelligence that led to the successful taking of Fort Duquesne by the British army.\"[7]\n\nAmerican Revolutionary War\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the Battle of Germantown in 1777, a combination of late arrival, poor navigation and overpursuit resulted in Major General Adam Stephen's men colliding with General Anthony Wayne's troops. The two Continental Army brigades opened fire on each other, became badly disorganized, and fled.\n\nIn the Battle of Guilford Courthouse on March 15, 1781, after several volleys of musket and cannon fire broke out, smoke began to obscure soldiers' view of the battlefield. In a pitched battle, smoke not only limited visibility but irritated soldiers' eyes and could make breathing difficult. In the confusion, British Lieutenant John Macleod, in command of two British three-pounders, was directed by British Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis to fire on the Americans who were in close combat with the British. Many British soldiers died as a result of friendly artillery bombardment.\n\nAustro-Turkish War\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Battle of Karánsebes in 1788, which only involved Austrian Imperial Army forces, started with a dispute over schnapps between Hussars and infantry of the Austrian vanguard which escalated into armed combat. The ensuing chaos involved even more Austrian forces, leaving 150 dead and 1200 wounded. The Ottoman Forces arrived only after the Austrians withdrew.\n\nFrench Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars\n\n[edit]\n\n1796 – Battle of Fombio: In a night of confused fighting when Austrian units had stumbled into his army's position, French general Amadee Laharpe was shot dead by his own men while returning from reconnaissance.\n\n1801 – Second Battle of Algeciras: Spanish ships Real Carlos and San Hermenegildo mistakenly engaged each other in the dark after HMS Superb sailed between them and fired at both. 1,700 were killed when the two ships exploded.[citation needed]\n\n1806 – On 30 November, at 10 pm, HMS Dart and Wolverine came upon a ship that they suspected was a French privateer and that kept up a running fight until morning, only surrendering after her captain and several of her crew had been wounded, of whom six later died. The vessel turned out to be the British merchant ship Mary.[8]\n\n1809 – Battle of Wagram: French troops mistakenly fired on their allies from the Kingdom of Saxony. The grey uniforms of the Saxons were misidentified as white, the colour of uniform worn by their Austrian enemy.\n\n1815 –\n\nBattle of Quatre Bras: Soldiers of the Dutch 3rd Light Cavalry Brigade disengaging and retiring from a skirmish against the French were fired on by Scottish highlanders who mistook their uniforms for those of French chasseurs a cheval.[9]\n\nBattle of Waterloo: Prussian artillery mistakenly fired on British artillery causing many casualties, and British artillery returned fire at the Prussians.\n\nTexas Revolution\n\n[edit]\n\nBoth sides, Texians and Mexicans, in the Siege of the Alamo in 1836, had friendly fire incidents:\n\nIn early hours of 1 March, a mounted party of Texian volunteers arriving at gallop to reinforce the Alamo garrison were fired at by defenders who mistook them in the dark for attacking Mexican horsemen, wounding one of them, before the sentries were called to open the gates for them.[10]\n\nAt the Mexicans' final mass assault (overnight 5–6 March), some of the veteran troops leading it were wounded or killed when shot by untrained recruits in the ranks behind who \"blindly fir[ed] their guns\", and when all the defenders had been killed, Mexicans continued to shoot Mexicans in mistake during the darkness.[11]\n\nAmerican Civil War\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the Battle of Shiloh on 6 April 1862, Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston was fatally wounded by a bullet that hit the back of his right knee when riding in advance of his troops. There were no Union troops observed to have got behind him and the bullet was identified by his surgeon as from a Pattern 1853 Enfield rifle, which was standard issue in the Confederate Army but not the Union troops present.[12]\n\nConfederate Lieutenant General Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson was wounded as a result of friendly fire in the Battle of Chancellorsville on 2 May 1863, and died eight days later. He and some of his men had been returning, under the cover of night, from an intelligence-gathering mission when Confederate troops of the 18th North Carolina Infantry misidentified them as a Union cavalry scout team; as a result, the North Carolina troops opened fire.[13]\n\nIn the Battle of the Wilderness on 6 May 1864, Confederate Lt. General James Longstreet was wounded when his mounted column from the First Corps was mistaken for Federal troops. As a result of this, he did not return to command until October of that year. In the same incident, Brigadier General Micah Jenkins was mortally wounded after being struck in the head.[13]\n\nIn the early hours of 6 March 1865, the Union vessel USS Peterhoff was en route to blockade Wilmington, North Carolina when she was rammed and sunk by USS Monticello after being mistaken for a blockade runner. All hands were rescued before she sank.[14]\n\nRusso-Japanese War\n\n[edit]\n\nDogger Bank Incident (overnight 21/22 October 1904) – In what can be classified literally as a case of fog of war,[15] battleships of the Imperial Russian Navy's Baltic Fleet en route to reinforce in the Far East, fired on a fleet of British fishing trawlers in the North Sea, mistaking them for Imperial Japanese Navy torpedo boats after misunderstanding signals. One fishing vessel was sunk, four were damaged, and two fishermen were killed and six wounded. In the general chaos that ensued, the cruisers Aurora and Dmitrii Donskoi were also taken for Japanese warships in the fog and bombarded by seven battleships sailing in formation, damaging both ships and killing at least one Russian sailor and severely wounding another, and fatally wounding a naval chaplain. During the pandemonium, several Russian ships signalled that torpedoes had hit them, and on board the battleship Borodino, rumours spread that the ship was being boarded by the Japanese, with some crew members donning life vests and lying prone on the deck and others drawing cutlasses to repel a boarding before a ceasefire was signalled.[16]\n\n13 November 1904 – The Imperial Russian Navy destroyer Stroini struck a Russian naval mine and sank in Korea Bay off Port Arthur, China.[17][18]\n\nWorld War I\n\n[edit]\n\n1914\n\n[edit]\n\nBattle of Dinant 21–23 August – It is believed that some parties of German infantry entering the Belgian city of Dinant in a nighttime assault, fired at each other in the darkness while under fire from French troops. The Germans mistakenly believed that hostile Belgian civilians had fired on them, contributing to a conviction among their troops that Belgian civilians were actively fighting them.[19] This led to arrests and massacres of local civilians when the town was invaded and occupied. On the 23rd, German artillery mistakenly fired on infantry who were occupying and barricading a street; the latter units were temporarily forced to withdraw, having shot a man held as a human shield accused of having been a franc-tireur in earlier fighting.[20]\n\n28 August – During the Battle of Heligoland Bight, a British submarine mistook the British light cruiser HMS Southampton for an Imperial German Navy warship and fired two torpedoes at her, which missed. Assuming the submarine to be German, Southampton attempted to ram it, but it escaped without damage.[21]\n\n4 November – While attempting to exit the anchorage at Schillig Roads in the Heligoland Bight in fog, the Imperial German Navy armored cruiser SMS Yorck entered a German minefield, struck two mines, and quickly sank at with the loss of at least 338 and perhaps as many as 502 lives, according to different sources.[22][23][24]\n\n1915\n\n[edit]\n\n21 January – The Imperial German Navy submarine U-7 was torpedoed and sunk in the North Sea by the German submarine U-22, which had mistaken her for an enemy submarine. Twenty-four of U-7′s crew were killed, and only one survived.\n\nBattle of Bolimów 31 January – The German Ninth Army launched the first large scale poison tear gas attack on the Russian Second Army in Poland, firing 18,000 gas shells. However the wind blew the gas back onto the German lines, causing a few casualties which could have been higher had the winter cold not frozen the ingredient xylyl bromide. The attack was called off, the counter-attacking Russians being successfully repelled by conventional artillery shellfire.[25]\n\n25 September – In the first gas attack launched by British forces prior to their infantry attack that opened the Battle of Loos, about 140 long tons (140 t) of chlorine gas was released, aimed at the German Sixth Army's positions on the Hohenzollern Redoubt but in places the gas was blown back by wind onto the trenches of the British First Army. Due to the inefficiency of the contemporary gas masks, many soldiers removed them as they could not see through the fogged-up talc eyepieces or could barely breathe with them on. This led to some being affected by their own gas, as it blew back across their lines or lingered in no man's land,[26] immediately causing the death of 10 and injury to about 2,000 British soldiers. It was made worse when German artillery fire blew up some of the cylinders.[27]\n\n1916\n\n[edit]\n\n8 May – During the Battle of Verdun, when the French outpost Fort Douaumont was occupied by German infantry, a careless cooking fire detonated grenades, flamethrower fuel and an ammunition cache. Hundreds of soldiers were killed instantly in the firestorm, including the entire 12th Grenadiers regimental staff. Worse, some of the 1,800 wounded and soot blackened survivors attempting to escape the inferno were mistaken for attacking French Colonial African infantry and were fired upon by their comrades. In all 679 German soldiers perished in this fire.[28]\n\n2 June – On the opening of the Battle of Mount Sorrel in the Ypres Salient of Belgium, the commanding officer of the 3rd Canadian Division, Major General Malcolm Mercer, and his aide Captain Lynam Gooderham, were wounded and trapped when German artillery opened fire on divisional trenches they were inspecting. They ran into rifle crossfire when attempting to evade advancing German infantry, Mercer receiving a bullet in a leg, then remained overnight unhelped until 2 am next day when Mercer was killed by an exploding shell and Gooderham was taken prisoner by the Germans. A staff officer later claimed the fatal shell was British and Mercer is upheld as the most senior Canadian officer killed in combat and by friendly fire.[29]\n\nOn the night of 4–5 August, during the First Battle of the Somme, the 13th Battalion of the Durham Light Infantry were fired on by Australian Artillery while in process of capturing and holding onto a German communication trench called Munster Alley.\n\n17 September – During the same Battle of the Somme, a company of the 1st/7th Battalion of the Duke of Wellington's Regiment waiting to charge a German trench south of Thiepval, France, were strafed from behind by Stokes mortar fire, the most loss of life caused when their hand grenade store was hit, detonating its contents. The mortars had been issued their battalion only a few weeks before and inexperienced firers had set too short a range aiming at enemy lines. Despite this, company commander Captain Basil Lupton rallied the survivors and led a successful taking of the opposite trench.[30]\n\n1917\n\n[edit]\n\n11 March – The Italian destroyer Euro and torpedo boat Airone sighted the Italian submarines F9 and F10 in the Mediterranean Sea off Messina, Sicily, mistook them for Central Powers submarines, and opened gunfire on them. The two submarines submerged and escaped damage.[31]\n\n17 March – The German submarine SM UB-40 sank the British hospital ship HMHS Lanfranc in the English Channel when it was ferrying wounded from Le Havre to Southampton. The passengers included 167 German prisoners of war, of whom 18 were killed and 15 wounded in the sinking.[32]\n\n16 September – At night in foul weather, the British submarine HMS G9 mistook the destroyer HMS Pasley for a German U-boat and attacked with torpedoes. Pasley, not recognising G9 as British until too late, responded to the attack by ramming G9. Nearly cut in two, G9 sank. Only one of the G9's crew members survived.\n\n6 October – When the U.S. Navy armed yacht USS Nahma (SP-771) sighted the Italian cargo ship SS Bologna in the Atlantic Ocean approaching Gibraltar at 02:30, she mistook the Italian submarines H6 and H8, which were escorting Bologna, for Imperial German Navy U-boats. She opened gunfire on H8, firing four rounds before H8 identified herself as friendly. Nahma then approached H6, thought she saw crewmen on H6′s deck running to man H6′s deck gun, and fired one round, which hit H6′s conning tower, killing two men and wounding seven others, two of whom later died of their wounds. Nahma then identified H6 as friendly and ceased fire. At 05:00, the British Royal Navy torpedo boat HMS TB 93 arrived on the scene and accidentally fired one round at Nahma. Nahma sighted TB 93 at 05:20, mistook her for a German U-boat, and fired two rounds at her before identifying her as friendly.[33]\n\n1918\n\n[edit]\n\n16 January – A United States Navy gun crew aboard the U.S. passenger ship SS New York mistakenly fired one shot at the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Jenkins, which was escorting New York. The shot hit Jenkins, killing one man and wounding four others.[33]\n\n23 January – Major William Robert Gregory, Royal Flying Corps, was shot down by mistake and killed by an Italian Corpo Aeronautico Militare pilot at Monastiero near Grossa, Padua, Italy. He inspired the poem, An Irish Airman Foresees His Death, by family friend W. B. Yeats.[34]\n\n24 February – The U.S. Navy destroyer USS Paulding sighted the periscope of the Royal Navy submarine HMS L2 in the Atlantic Ocean south of Ireland, opened gunfire on it, and dropped two depth charges, forcing L2 to surface. The U.S. Navy destroyer USS Davis then dropped a depth charge near L2 and Paulding, Davis, and the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Trippe all opened gunfire on her. One round struck L2 before the destroyers ceased fire and Davis escorted her to Berehaven, Ireland.[33]\n\n12 March – The French airship AT-0 dropped four 52-kilogram (115 lb) bombs on the Royal Navy submarine HMS D3 in the English Channel off Fécamp, France, after mistaking her for an Imperial German Navy submarine and her recognition rockets for anti-aircraft fire. D3 sank with the loss of all hands.\n\n26 March – At daybreak, the Royal Navy warship HMS Jeannette II sighted the French Navy submarine Watt in the Mediterranean Sea ahead of a convoy Jeannette II was escorting from Gibraltar to Bizerte, Tunisia. Watt submerged, and Jeannette II, assuming she was an enemy submarine, dropped two depth charges, forcing Watt to surface. Some ships in the convoy and another escort, the U.S. Navy armed yacht USS Wenonah (SP-165), opened gunfire on Watt. Wenonah fired 12 rounds at a range of 1,000 yards (910 m), inflicting considerable damage, killing Watt′s commanding officer and one of her crewmen and wounding four other men, before identifying Watt as friendly.[33]\n\n15 April – Two British soldiers from the Somerset Light Infantry were killed and C.S. Lewis was wounded after being hit by a shrapnel from a British shell that had fallen short of its target in Mont-Bernanchon, France.[35]\n\n24/25 April – During the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux, soldiers of the Australian 50th Infantry Battalion, advancing in the dark under German machine fire, attacked what they believed was an enemy trench. They found out that the trench was instead occupied by British troops of the 2nd Devon and 1st Worcester Battalions who had not been informed of the Australian counterattack and \"thought the Germans were attacking them from the rear\".[36]\n\n1 June – During the attack on the main wagon bridge over the Marne at Château-Thierry, American machine gunners described a night attack of massed German troops, who were singing gutturally as they made a suicidal charge, some linked arm in arm. The victims were soldiers of the French 10th Colonial division from Senegal, who had been trying to get back across the river. Although reports of the incident were suppressed, it was discussed by American and French soldiers. There are no German records of any attack on the wagon bridge.[37]\n\n16 June – During German spring offensive, the British 4th Battalion of the King's Shropshire Light Infantry (4th KSLI), with reinforcing elements of North Staffordshires and Cheshires, were shelled by British artillery who were unaware the position had changed hands, within 30 minutes of successfully taking a hill, Montagne de Bligny, from the Germans and capturing prisoners. The bombardment reduced the units' effective strength to 100 men but their commander, Captain Geoffrey Bright, insisted on retaining the hill and sending out for reinforcements from British units until help arrived before nightfall. For the overall action the 4th KSLI received a unit award of the French Croix de Guerre.[38]\n\n18 June – The U.S. Navy submarine chasers USS SC-94 and USS SC-151 opened gunfire on the British destroyers HMS Defender and HMS Nymphe in the Strait of Otranto after mistaking them for enemy submarines, SC-94 firing two rounds and SC-151 firing one. One round from SC-94 hit Nymphe, putting one of her steam engines out of commission.[33]\n\n20 June – The British destroyer HMS Acorn fired four or five shots at the U.S. Navy submarine chaser USS SC-151 in the Strait of Otranto. All missed.[33]\n\n13 July – British army officer and poet Siegfried Sassoon was wounded after being shot in the head by a fellow British soldier who had mistaken him for a German near Arras, France. As a result, he spent the remainder of the war in Britain.\n\n16 July – British flying ace Major Awdry Vaucour was killed[39] in the vicinity of Monastier di Treviso, Italy when he was accidentally shot down by an Italian pilot.\n\n23 July – During a voyage from New York City to Europe as part of a five-ship convoy, the British armed troop transport SS Minnekahda opened gunfire on the U.S. Navy submarine USS N-3 (SS-55) in the Atlantic Ocean as she closed with N-3 from a range of 200 yards (183 m) to a range of only 50 yards (46 m), scoring one 6-or-7.5-inch (152 or 191 mm) hit (according to different sources) and inflicting considerable damage. One of the convoy′s escorts, the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Preble, then attempted to ram N-3, missing her by only a few feet. N-3 proceeded to port under her own power.[33][40]\n\n28 July – Canadian flying ace and future spymaster William Stephenson, then posted with No. 73 Squadron RAF, was shot down and crashed his Sopwith Camel biplane behind enemy lines in France. During the incident, he later claimed, Stephenson was injured by fire not only from German ace pilot, Justus Grassmann,[41] but also by friendly fire from a French observer.[42] He was subsequently captured and held as a prisoner of war until he escaped in October 1918.[42]\n\n7 August – Steaming in the Atlantic Ocean as part of a 28-ship convoy, the U.S. armed cargo ship SS Jason sighted the U.S. Navy submarine USS O-6 behind the convoy, mistook her for an Imperial German Navy U-boat, and opened gunfire on her, firing eight rounds and scoring five hits at a range of 3,000 yards (2,700 m). O-6 sustained damage that prevented her from submerging. Jason ceased fire when she steamed out of range of O-6. A second merchant ship also opened fire on O-6, but all her shots fell short. The U.S. Navy destroyer USS Paul Jones then closed with O-6 and opened 3-inch (76.2 mm) gunfire, but all of her shots also fell short, and she ceased fire when she closed to a range of 3,000 yards (2,700 m) and identified O-6 as friendly. O-6 suffered no casualties.[33]\n\n27 August – Steaming in the Atlantic Ocean south of Long Island during a voyage from Bordeaux, France, to New York City, the American armed cargo ship SS Felix Taussig mistook the U.S. Navy submarine chaser USS SC-209 for an Imperial German Navy U-boat and opened gunfire on her, firing one 4-inch (102 mm) and four 3-inch (76.2 mm) rounds. Two of the 3-inch (76.2 mm) rounds struck SC-209, setting her on fire, and she sank in three minutes at with the loss of 18 lives, the largest U.S. Navy loss of life in a single friendly fire incident during World War I. The submarine chaser USS SC-188 rescued SC-209′s five survivors, four of whom were wounded.[33][43]\n\n4 October – The nine companies from the US Army's 77th Infantry Division which had pushed into a salient at Charlevaux, France and became known as the \"Lost Battalion\" after being surrounded by the Germans, were subjected to friendly artillery fire for several hours, either due to the artillery fire being inaccurate or the coordinates, delivered by carrier pigeon, being inaccurate. The overall commander, Major Charles Whittlesey, used his last carrier pigeon, named Cher Ami, to send a second message for the artillery to cease fire.\n\n15 October – British submarine HMS J6 was sunk by British Q-ship Cymric in the North Sea off the Northumberland Coast. Cymric's captain, Lieutenant F. Peterson RNR, mistook the identity lettering on the conning tower of J6 for U6. Assuming U6 to indicate a German U-boat, Peterson raised the White ensign and opened fire on J6. After a number of direct hits, J6 sank. It was only after the survivors were seen in the water that Peterson and the crew of Cymric realised their mistake and recovered the survivors. Of the crew of J6, 15 were lost; a subsequent court of enquiry found that no action should be taken against Peterson.\n\nLatvian War of Independence\n\n[edit]\n\n6 March 1919 – Colonel Oskars Kalpaks was killed in command of his 1st Latvian Independent Battalion, when his unit had a mistaken skirmish with a German Freikorps party near Airītes in Saldus District. Both parties were allied in a counterattack on the Soviet Army occupying Latvia.\n\nSpanish Civil War\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 19 February 1937, the Nationalist Irish Brigade was fired upon by a Falangist unit, and the hour-long firefight resulted in 11 deaths. Neither unit had had any battle experience.[44]\n\nOn 30 April 1937, the Nationalist battleship España hit a Nationalist-laid mine and sank, killing four sailors.[45]\n\nWorld War II\n\n[edit]\n\n1939\n\n[edit]\n\n6 September – Just five days after the start of the war, in what was dubbed the Battle of Barking Creek, three Royal Air Force Spitfires from 74 Squadron shot down two Hurricanes from the RAF's 56 Squadron, killing one of the pilots. One of the Spitfires was then shot down by British anti-aircraft artillery while returning to base.[46]\n\n10 September – The British submarine HMS Triton sank another British submarine, HMS Oxley. After making challenges which went unanswered Triton assumed it must have located a German U-boat and fired two torpedoes. Oxley was the first Royal Navy vessel to be sunk and also the first vessel to be sunk by a British vessel in the war, killing 52 with only two survivors. Both vessels were patrolling off the coast of Norway (then neutral) at the time. The incident that led to the loss of Oxley was kept in secrecy until the 1950s.[47]\n\n3 December 1939 – British submarine HMS Snapper sustained a direct hit from a British aircraft while returning to Harwich after a patrol in the North Sea, but without taking damage.[48]\n\n1940\n\n[edit]\n\n19 February – During Operation Wikinger the German destroyer Z1 Leberecht Maass was sunk by Luftwaffe bombs while another destroyer, the Z3 Max Schultz, was sunk by mines in the confusion. A total of 606 Kriegsmarine sailors were killed.[49]\n\n10 April - First Battle of Narvik. During the first British naval sortie into German-held Narvik harbour, HMS Hostile torpedoed merchant ships moored there. As well as eleven German ships, she also sank one British and two Norwegian merchant ships, as well as two (neutral) Swedish vessels.[50]\n\n14 April – The Dutch submarine HNLMS O 10 was bombed in error off Noordwijk by an RAF aircraft.[51]\n\n10 May – German Luftwaffe bombers sent to bomb Dijon in France instead bombed the German city of Freiburg due to navigation errors, killing 57 people.[52]\n\n11 May\n\nDuring the Battle of Belgium the British 3rd Infantry Division, commanded by Major-General Bernard Law Montgomery were sent to take their pre-arranged position on the River Dyle near Leuven when they were mistaken that night for German paratroopers and fired on by the Belgian 10th Infantry Division who were holding the position. They gave way when, Montgomery claimed, he approached and offered to place himself under Belgian command.[53]\n\nAt 23:57, the French submarine Amazone fired two torpedoes at what she identified as a German submarine in the North Sea at . Both torpedoes missed. The German submarine U-7 and the Royal Navy submarine HMS Shark both reported being attacked by a submarine in that area around that time, and Amazone′s target might have been Shark.[54][55]\n\n11–12 May –Battle of the Grebbeberg, The Netherlands: The 2nd Battalion of the Dutch 19th Infantry Regiment, ordered to make a night counterattack against positions newly seized by the Germans on 11 May, were fired on at the stopline by other Dutch troops who had been uninformed of the counterattack, causing it to be called off at dawn when order had been restored. (Fortunately for the Dutch a planned German night attack at that point had been called off because of their deterring supporting artillery fire.) They were ordered to counterattack again, after 1600 hours the following day, when, reaching the frontline, fellow troops again fired on them, causing the counterattack to peter out and be abandoned.\n\n14 May – At midday German Luftwaffe fighters attacked at French town of Chemery-sur-Bar as the 1st Panzer Division were holding a victory parade following the battle of Bulsen, causing a few casualties.[56]\n\n20 May – The French Navy submarine Antiope mistook the French Navy submarine Sibylle for a German U-boat and fired three torpedoes at her in the North Sea off the coast of the Netherlands at at a range of 600 metres (660 yd); the torpedoes passed beneath Sybille.[57][58][59]\n\n21 May – A Royal Air Force Hurricane shot down Bristol Blenheim L9325 of No. 18 Squadron RAF. The Blenheim crashed near Arras, France. Its three crewmen were killed.[60]\n\n22 May – A Royal Air Force Spitfire shot down Bristol Blenheim L9266 of No. 59 Squadron RAF.

In 1999 it was reported that Tom Mitchell, at the time a RAF fighter pilot, claimed to have shot Johnson down when she twice failed to give the correct identification code during the flight. He said: \"The reason Amy was shot down was because she gave the wrong colour of the day [a signal to identify aircraft known by all British forces] over radio.\" Mitchell explained how the aircraft was sighted and contacted by radio. A request was made for the signal. She gave the wrong one twice. \"Sixteen rounds of shells were fired and the plane dived into the Thames Estuary. We all thought it was an enemy plane until the next day when we read the papers and discovered it was Amy.

At 0700, PT-350 was attempting to dislodge PT-347 from the reef, when two American Marine Corsair planes mistook the PT boats for Japanese gunboats and attacked. Taking heavy fire from the planes, PT-350 shot down one of the two attacking fighters, believing them to be A6M Zeros. With three dead and four wounded and serious mechanical problems, PT-350 headed back to base. PT-347 remained stuck on the reef. When PT-350 could not be boarded because of extensive damage, PT-346 headed out to PT-347 to provide assistance. PT-346 arrived at 1230, and at 1400 was still attempting to dislodge PT-347 from the coral heads when planes appeared. The Corsair plane from the morning run brought back an entire squadron of 21 planes (four Corsairs, six Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers, four Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters, and eight Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers). Recognizing the planes as American and thinking they were the air cover he had ordered, the squadron commander ordered the men to keep working; however, the planes attacked the two boats, still mistaking them for Japanese gunboats. PT-346 did not respond defensively until it was too late, and took heavy casualties. The skipper of PT-347, Lieutenant Williams, who had experienced the earlier attack, ordered his men into the water and to stay dispersed, but two men were killed and three wounded. PT-346 and PT-347 were completely destroyed by bombs, and the men were strafed in the water for approximately one hour.\n\nA U.S. Navy PB4Y-1 Liberator patrol bomber of Bombing Squadron 109 (VB-109) mistook the U.S. Navy submarine USS Seahorse (SS-304) for a Japanese submarine and attacked her off Satawan southeast of Truk Atoll while she was performing lifeguard duty in support of U.S. airstrikes. The PB4Y-1 dropped two bombs as Seahorse crash-dived.

Only one member of her crew of 42 survived. Her 41 lost crewmen were the last casualties the French submarine forces suffered during World War II.[199][200][201]\n\n24 July – Some 1,600 bombers flew in support of the opening bombardment for Cobra. Due to bad weather they were unable to see their targets. Although some were recalled, and others declined to bomb without visibility, a number did, which hit U.S. positions. Twenty-five were killed and 131 wounded in this incident.\n\nThe following day, on 25 July, the operation was repeated by 1,800 bombers of the Eighth Air Force. On this occasion, the weather was clear, but despite requests by First Army commander General Omar Bradley to bomb east to west, along the front in order to avoid creepback, the air commanders made their attack north to south, over Allied lines. As more and more bombs fell short, and U.S. positions again were hit, 111 were killed and 490 wounded. Lieutenant General Lesley McNair was among the dead, the highest-ranking victim of American friendly fire.\n\n26 July – USAAF P-47s mistakenly strafed the US 644th Tank Destroyer Battalion near Perrières, France. 20 men were badly injured, but there were no fatalities.[202]\n\n27 July – The former HMS Sunfish was sunk by a British RAF Coastal Command aircraft in the Norwegian Sea during the beginning of its process of being transferred to the Soviet Navy. The Captain, Israel Fisanovich, supposedly had taken her out of her assigned area and was diving the sub when the aircraft came in sight instead of staying on the surface and firing signal flares as instructed. All crew, including the British liaison staff, were lost. Later investigation revealed that the RAF crew were at fault.[203]\n\n4 August – The crew of a de Havilland Mosquito from 410 Tactical Fighter Operational Training Squadron, RCAF, mistook a Westland Lysander for a Henschel Hs 126 during a night interception, shooting it down.[204]\n\n7 August – A RAF Hawker Typhoon strafed a squad from 'F' Company/US 120th Infantry Regiment, near Hill 314, France, killing two men.[205] Around noon on the same day, RAF Hawker Typhoon of the 2TAF was called in to assist the US 823rd Tank Destroyer Battalion in stopping an attack by the 2nd SS Panzer Division between Sourdeval and Mortain but instead fired its rockets at two US 3-inch guns near L'Abbaye Blanche, killing one man and wounding several others even after the yellow smoke (which was to identify friendlies) was put out. Two hours later, an RAF Typhoon shot up the Service Company of the 120th Infantry Regiment, US 30th Division, causing several casualties, including Major James Bynum who was killed near Mortain. The officer who replaced him was strafed by another Typhoon a few minutes later and seriously wounded. Around the same time, a Hawker Typhoon attacked the Cannon Company of 120th Infantry Regiment, US 30th Division, near Mortain, killing 15 men.[205] An hour later, RAF Typhoons strafed 'B' Company/US 120th Infantry Regiment on Hill 285, killing a driver of a weapons carrier.[206]\n\nTwo battalions of the 77th Infantry on Guam exchanged prolonged fire on 8 August 1944, the incident possibly started with the firing of mortars for range-finding and angle calibration purposes. Small arms and then armour fire was exchanged. The mistake was realized when both units tried to call in the same artillery battalion to bombard the other.[207]\n\n8 August –\n\n8th USAAF heavy bombers bombed the headquarters of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division and 1st Polish Armoured Division during Operation Totalize, killing 65 and wounding 250 Allied soldiers.[208]\n\nNear Mortain, France, RAF Hawker Typhoon aircraft attacked two Sherman tanks of 'C' Company, US 743rd Tank Battalion with rockets, killing five tank crewmen and wounding ten soldiers.

HMS Britomart and HMS Hussar took direct hits and were sunk. HMS Salamander had her stern blown off and sustained heavy damage. HMS Jason was raked by machine gun fire, killing and wounding several of her crew. Two of the accompanying trawlers were also hit. The total loss of life was 117 sailors killed and 153 wounded. The attack had continued despite the attempts by the ships to signal that they were friendly and radio requests by the commander of the aircraft for clarification of his target. In the aftermath the surviving sailors were told to keep quiet about the attack. The subsequent court of enquiry identified the fault as lying with the Navy, which had requested the attack on what they thought were enemy vessels entering or leaving Le Havre, and three RN officers were put before a court martial. The commander of Jason and his crew were decorated for their part in rescuing their comrades. At the time reporting of the incident was suppressed with information not fully released until 1994.[216][217][218]\n\n8–9 September – At about midnight on the night of 8–9 September, the Japanese cargo ship Izu Maru rammed the Imperial Japanese Army Type 3 submergence transport vehicle Yu 3001 — a transport submarine — in the Yellow Sea near Kunsan, Korea, after mistaking her for an enemy submarine. The collision ripped a large hole in Yu 3001′s pressure hull and injured one officer on board. Yu 3001 remained afloat. In a second incident later in Yu 3001′s voyage as she headed to port for repairs, an Imperial Japanese Navy ship escorting a passing convoy fired two rounds at her without damaging her.[219]\n\n9 September – On third day of the Battle of Arnhem, a German SS battalion's pursuit of landed Allied paratroopers was halted at the village of Wolfheze, Netherlands, when Luftwaffe planes mistakenly strafed it.[220]\n\n12 September:\n\nA group of RAF Hawker Typhoon aircraft destroyed two Sherman tanks of the Governor General's Foot Guards, 4th Canadian Armoured Division in the vicinity of Maldegem, Belgium, killing three men and injuring four.

Lt. Middleton-Hope's tank was badly hit, killing the gunner Guardsman Hughes, and the tank was set on fire. Almost immediately Sgt. Jenning's tank was similarly knocked out by Typhoon rockets. Meanwhile the Typhoons continued to press home their attack with machine guns and rockets, and, while trying to extricate the gunner, Lt. Middleton-Hope was killed after his tank was blown off. In this tragic encounter, Guardsman Scott was also killed and Baker, Barter, and Cheal were seriously wounded.\"[221]\n\nThe Japanese transport ship Rakuyō Maru, carrying 1,317 Australian and British prisoners-of-war in convoy from Singapore to Formosa (Taiwan), was sunk in the Luzon Strait by the submarine USS Sealion, whose commanders were unaware until after the sinking that allied prisoners had been on board.

Cdr Lynch Maydon, did not know there were Allied prisoners of war on board.[225] At that time it was the world's greatest sea disaster with 5,620 dead[226] as well as the worst single friendly fire loss (surpassed by the Cap Arcona disaster next year) and highest death toll inflicted in a single action by British forces. 680 survivors were rescued, the prisoners of whom went on to their intended destination.\n\n19 September – RAF Sergeant Bernard McCormack, a gunner in a Lancaster bomber, was returning along with other RAF aircrews from a night time raid over Nazi Germany. As they returned to RAF Woodhall Spa in Lincolnshire, Sgt McCormack saw a plane flying in the same formation as he was. Believing that it was a German Junkers Ju 88, he attacked the plane, bringing it down over the Dutch town of Steenbergen. Two of the occupants were killed. It was found out by RAF intelligence officers that it was actually a British Mosquito flown by CO Guy Gibson, who previously took part in Operation Chastise, and his navigator Jim Warwick. Wracked with guilt, McCormack taped a confession, which he entrusted to his wife Eunice when he died in 1992.[citation needed]\n\n3 October – A U.S. Navy TBF Avenger torpedo bomber from the escort carrier USS Midway (CVE-63) attacked the U.S. Navy submarine USS Stingray (SS-186) as she crash-dived in the Pacific Ocean 100 nautical miles (185 km; 115 mi) east-northeast of Morotai at .
