        "text": "Some of these individuals participated in the ASC Oral History Project. For more information, please go to the Oral History of Criminology Project page.\n\n“Behavior is the variable aspect of reality.” These are the resounding opening words of Donald Black’s first major theoretical work, The Behavior of Law (1976). With them, Donald announced his intellectual mission: explaining variation in a realm of reality that was to preoccupy him for the next half century: social life.\n\nDonald was born in 1941 in Mount Vernon, New York. He grew up in Indianapolis and graduated from Indiana University with a degree in sociology. After completing his sociology Ph.D. at the University of Michigan in 1968, he went to Yale Law School, where he was first a Russell Sage post-doctoral fellow, 1968-1970, and then a lecturer, 1970-1973. From 1970 to 1979, he was a faculty member in the Department of Sociology at Yale (Associate Professor from 1974 on). He moved to Harvard Law School in 1980 and to the University of Virginia Sociology Department in 1985 where he was Department Chair until 1988. That year, he was appointed University Professor of the Social Sciences, a position he held until his retirement in 2016.\n\nOver the course of his long career, Donald produced a body of sociological theory unmatched in originality and explanatory power. He published five books and edited or coedited two more. His most important early work was The Behavior of Law, which advanced what is still the only general sociological theory of law. From there, Donald broadened his gaze to the larger universe of conflict management, including violence, avoidance, settlement, negotiation, and toleration. That work culminated in his major mid-career work, The Social Structure of Right and Wrong (1993). He broke still more fresh ground with a third major opus: Moral Time (2011), which presented a radically new general and testable theory of the causes of conflict. In between these books, he authored a series of brilliant publications, including The Manners and Customs of the Police, Sociological Justice, “Crime as Social Control,” and “The Geometry of Terrorism.” Some of his work extended beyond crime, violence, law, and conflict into other topics such as the sociology of ideas and scienticity (the degree to which ideas are testable, general, valid, simple, and original). Unusually for a sociologist, he drew as freely on anthropological and historical materials as on modern data, allowing him to explain variation in social behavior in all societies and across time.\n\nDonald did not just create new theories. He created a new theoretical paradigm, a profoundly innovative way of conceptualizing and explaining social behavior – with its location and direction in social space, or its social geometry. He came to name this pure sociology for it eschewed three P’s found in virtually every other form of social theory – psychology, purposes, and people. He discussed these and other distinctive features of pure sociology in several papers, most notably “The Epistemology of Pure Sociology” (1995). In all his carefully constructed writings, he was never content merely to repeat himself but always sought to build upon his prior work. The result was unprecedented: an entire intellectual system with a new subject matter, namely the behavior of social life. Several other scholars have been inspired to use his system to develop geometrical theories of various aspects of social control. Many more applications will surely be generated in the future.\n\nHe was a charismatic teacher who influenced many fledgling sociologists. He took teaching seriously, creating course syllabi that were comprehensively referenced and elegantly structured. His classes were an intellectual treat for he saw teaching as an opportunity to develop new ideas. Beyond the classroom, he was an encouraging mentor, ready to offer advice and feedback, especially to younger scholars.\n\nDonald was a man of principle. He took matters of morality very seriously and did what he thought right regardless of the crowd. Yet his commitment to value free sociology was such that he never told his classes or his readers what they ought to think or say or do.\n\nDonald’s involvement in his work was absolute. To avoid distractions, he lived much of his adult life in a house in the woods. Yet he liked to meet graduate students or friends for an occasional beer and could talk for hours on diverse topics. He had novel things to say about virtually everything – painting, the stock market, poetry, restaurants, design, football, politics, academia, music, religion, travel, science, students, and, a particular fixation, the titles of books and articles. One topic obsessed him above all others, however: creativity – in any realm but especially the intellectual.\n\nComing of age in the 1960s, Donald was strongly influenced by that decade’s spirit of youthful experimentation, cultural unconventionality, and irreverent fun. Those qualities can be seen in everything he wrote, including the exuberance and democratic radical simplicity of his prose.\n\nDonald was a Fellow of the American Society of Criminology and the American Anthropological Association. He received the Law and Society Association’s Harry Kalven Jr. Prize for outstanding scholarship. He was awarded the Theory Prize and a Distinguished Book Award from the American Sociological Association (ASA) (for The Social Structure of Right and Wrong), a Distinguished Scholarship Award from the ASA (for “The Epistemology of Pure Sociology”), and the inaugural Outstanding Book Award of the ASA Section on Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity (for Moral Time). Several of his books were translated into other languages.\n\nDonald died suddenly at his home outside Charlottesville at the end of January. Although he is no longer among us, he will remain a powerful intellectual presence. His razor-sharp writings, elegant geometrical paradigm, and powerful theories will continue to attract and inspire all who seek to explain that familiar yet mysterious dimension of reality we humans create through our social interactions.\n\nPrepared by Mark Cooney and Roberta Senechal de La Roche\n\nWe are sad to pass on the news of the death of Barry Krisberg on February 13, 2024.\n\nBarry received BA, his MA in criminology and PhD in sociology from the University of Pennsylvania and in 1971, joined the UC Berkeley faculty as an Assistant Professor in Berkeley’s School of Criminology. In 1977, he joined the staff of the San Francisco office of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency (NCCD) as a Senior Research Associate. Six year later, he was named its president, a post he held until 2010. After retirement, Barry occasionally taught at UC Berkeley.\n\nDuring his tenure, NCCD was and remained the premier policy research organization in the United States. He had the ear and respect of everyone; his staff, radical criminologists, religious leaders, editorial writers for the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, key legislators everywhere. He helped dozens of NGOs set and remain focused on their priorities. Barry recruited first rate and committed researchers, who together, produced short, focused and convincing research reports that were both sophisticated and readable.\n\nDuring a period when adult prison populations were sky rocketing, juvenile custody dropped precipitously. Barry played a decisive role in this. He was successful in convincing legislators almost everywhere that “youth is different.” Perhaps his single greatest (certainly one of his proudest) achievement took place in Washington, D.C., during testimony before a House Committee, where he convinced it to add an amendment on a huge funding package that would prohibit federal funding to states that locked kids up with adult offenders. This accomplishment set the pattern for the states. We suspect that he was responsible for keeping more juveniles out of custody than any other single person in the United States.\n\nHe also devoted considerable attention to crowding in custodial facilities. Perhaps his single most important report in this vein was as an expert witness in Brown v. Plata, where he assembled findings of a great many studies showing that decisions to significantly reduce prison populations have no measurable effect on subsequent crime rates, findings that found their way into the three judge trial court panel and into Justice Kennedy’s surprise opinion in the 5-4 Supreme Court decision.\n\nBarry Krisberg was a giant among giants in the never ending battle to fight for dignity and decency.\n\nBarry is survived by his wife Karen McKie and their sons Moshe and Zaïd\n\nPrpared by Malcolm Feeley and Rosann Greenspan, UC Berkeley\n\nCriminology has lost one of its brightest stars. Richard Rosenfeld, Curators’ Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Missouri-St. Louis (UMSL), passed away peacefully on January 8, 2024, leaving behind a loving family and countless friends and colleagues.\n\nRick received his PhD in Sociology from the University of Oregon in 1984 and taught briefly at Skidmore College before taking up a post-doctoral fellowship in the School of Urban and Public Affairs at Carnegie Mellon University under the mentorship of Al Blumstein. In 1989, he joined UMSL as an Assistant Professor, remaining at the university for the duration of his long and distinguished career.\n\nRick was one of the nation’s most influential criminologists. His research interests ranged widely, but he is best known for his pioneering work on economic conditions and crime trends. He published extensively on this topic and at the time of his death had just received the galleys for a forthcoming book dedicated to the issue, Crime Dynamics: Why Crime Rates Move Up and Down over Time (Cambridge University Press).\n\nRick co-authored, Crime and the American Dream, which proposed a theory of institutional anomie to explain cross-national differences in crime rates. This theory, further developed in articles and subsequent editions of the book, links patterns and levels of crime to the balance and functioning of social institutions, and draws attention to the important role played by the social-welfare state in buffering the impact of economic hardship on crime. Crime and the American Dream has become required reading in criminology classes and is widely acknowledged as being part of the criminological canon.\n\nRick also advanced the study of crime-control policy, bringing rigorous, non-partisan research to bear on policy debates over issues such as racial disparities in police stops and searches, the impact of police enforcement strategies on crime, and prisoner re-entry effects on community crime rates. He was committed to the St. Louis region and collaborated with local agencies on anti-crime initiatives. In 2012, he served as “Criminologist in Residence” for the City of St. Louis Department of Public Safety and the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department, during which time he worked on projects aimed at reducing violence in high-crime neighborhoods.\n\nRick’s sterling record of research brought him many professional accolades. He was an elected Fellow of the American Society of Criminology (ASC), served as the Society’s President, and received its highest honor, the Edwin H. Sutherland Award, for his outstanding scholarly contributions to criminology. Rick cared deeply about the ASC. He attended every annual meeting, where he was generous with his time and often could be seen chatting in the hallway with students and junior colleagues about their research.\n\nFar from being an ivory tower intellectual, Rick was dedicated to informed engagement with the public and policymakers. He was one of criminology’s most effective communicators, serving as an important resource for the media on criminological matters. His careful analyses routinely appeared in important national and international media outlets such as NPR, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, and The Guardian. He also chaired or served on numerous government advisory panels of, among others, the National Academy of Sciences and the National Science Foundation.\n\nRick played a key role in building what was to become one of the nation’s strongest Criminology and Criminal Justice PhD programs. He did so not only through force of his scholarly reputation, but also by his commitment to celebrating excellence in his students and colleagues. He was a wise and gracious mentor who was every bit as pleased by the successes of others as he was by his own achievements.\n\nNo short review can do justice to a life as full and well lived as Rick’s. Suffice to say that we will not see his likes again. Shortly before he passed, Rick recorded a podcast in which he looked back on his career with an eye to the future. It is his gift to the discipline he loved.\n\nRick is survived by his wife, Janet Lauritsen, two sons, Jake Hoffmann Rosenfeld and Sam Hoffmann Rosenfeld, daughters-in-law, Erin McGaughey and Erica de Bruin, brother, Robert Rosenfeld, and three grandchildren.\n\nPrepared by: Richard Wright, Steven F. Messner, and Lee Slocum\n\nVincenzo Ruggiero passed away in his adopted ‘home’ city of London on Saturday 2nd February 2024 with his partner and his daughter at his side. Vincenzo was the Renaissance Man of international criminology – a critical polymath and scholar of politics, economics, sociology, history, literature, languages and art – all of which, in unique style, he brought to his original and stimulating essays, books, lectures and wonderful conversations over food and wine.\n\nBorn to Neapolitan parents in Ferrara, Italy, in 1950, his family, like so many southerners, migrated to the north of the country for work but remained deeply rooted in their Neapolitan heritage. He lived for many years in Torino where he studied and taught and, in the 1970s, was a dedicated political activist along with many of his friends during the period of social conflicts and unrest that came to be known as “The Years of Lead”.\n\nIn this decade he moved between London, where he worked as a porter at University College hospital, and parts of Italy, where he was involved in penal reform campaigns. In 1976 he founded a bi-annual paper on prison issues, coordinating a network involving prisoners, their families and reform activists and in 1977 established a new publisher – ‘Senza Galere’ (‘Without Prisons’) – later renamed ‘Ruggiero Edizioni’. The press mainly published fiction and poetry and all authors were either prisoners serving a sentence or ex-prisoners. As Vincenzo suggested, this was surely an early example of ‘Convict Criminology’. In the following years, between 1979-1983, he published his first academic books, on prison issues and drugs debates, writing about communities he saw as marginalised but engaged in resistance and it was important to him that he had undertaken this research and advocacy from outside the formal bounds of the university system.\n\nBetween 1986-1990 he studied for his Doctorate in Sociology and Criminology at the University of Bologna but in the early 1990s settled in London, feeling an affinity to bohemian Fitzrovia and Soho. He took up posts as, initially, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and then a Research Fellow at Middlesex University, subsequently – and swiftly – becoming a Reader and then Professor (1996) at Middlesex, contributing to its rich tradition of being a centre for critical criminology. In 1998 he undertook a secondment to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in Vienna leading pathbreaking research on Transnational Organised Crime and contributing to the study of human trafficking at a point when its significance was still only emerging. In Vienna he also founded a journal, Forum on Crime and Society and was among the organisers of the 2000 UN ‘Congress on Crime and the Treatment of Offenders’ (writing most of the official papers for conference deliberations), as well as contributing to the formulation of the UN Convention against Organised Crime, launched in Palermo in 2000. He was a long-standing member of many professional associations and took on committee roles for the European Group for the Study of Deviance and Social Control (1986-1993), and the American Society of Criminology Divisions on International Criminology (2016-2017) and Critical Criminology (2017-2018). He also served as Director of the Centre for Social and Criminological Research at Middlesex University.\n\nVincenzo was not only one of the leading theorists within our field but also an innovator in the use of multi-methods approaches to data-gathering – very often in contexts that are among the most hard to research – the worlds of organised criminals, corrupt politicians, traffickers, and political activists. He could be the classic lone scholar – disciplined in sitting at his desk, working his way through his piles of books and papers, then launching into a new writing project but he also led various funded research collaborations and initiatives and was a great co-author and co-worker, sociable and inspirational. Vincenzo loved to write, to set down ideas and engage with his peers and students and in doing so he was astonishingly productive. He spoke and published in Italian, French and English and his work was also translated into German, Spanish, Portuguese, Greek, Lithuanian, Turkish and Mandarin Chinese. His many publications include numerous academic articles and pieces of journalism as well as books such as: Western European Penal Systems (1995), Eurodrugs (1995), Organised and Corporate Crime in Europe (1996), The New European Criminology (1998), Crime and Markets (2000), Movements in the City (2001 Winner of the ‘Premio Nazionale G. Arena – Città di Acri’), Economic and Financial Crime in Europe (2002), Crime in Literature (2003), Crimes of the Economy (2013), Punishment in Europe (2013), Power and Crime (2015), Dirty Money: On Financial Delinquency (2017 Outstanding Book Award, American Society of Criminology, Division on White Collar and Corporate Crime), Organised Crime and Terrorist Networks (2020), Visions of Political Violence (2020), Critical Criminology Today: Counter-Hegemonic Essays (2021). In 2016 he received the Lifetime Achievement Award of the American Society of Criminology, Division on Critical Criminology and Social Justice.\n\nHe completed his latest book just two months before his death and was able to choose a cover design while in hospital. Appropriately the book is a survey – in inimitable style – of Keywords in Criminology: A cultural dictionary (Routledge, 2024).\n\nVincenzo leaves behind a daughter, Lucia, and his partner Cynthia, with whom he formed a civil partnership after 33 years together – as well as an international family of friends, students and admirers who will all remember Vincenzo as embodying gioia di vivere – he will be missed so much. Please raise a glass….\n\nPrepared by: Nigel South, University of Essex.\n\nJerome H. Skolnick, prolific scholar of policing, law and society, and President of the American Society of Criminology in 1994, passed away on February 22 in New York City. A native New Yorker who grew up in Brooklyn, he received a BA in sociology from City College. He met Arlene while in college and married her as soon as possible, which he said was “the only truly smart thing I’ve done in my life.” They both received PhDs at Yale’s department of sociology in 1962.\n\nAt Yale, Jerry studied with the anthropologist Ralph Linton, and Richard Donnelly and Harold Lasswell in the Law School. Doctorate done, he was drafted into the Army, where he served at Ft. Sam Houston in San Antonio. He returned to Yale to work in the Law School’s new law and social science program, which was developing on the heels of its Legal Realism project. His son Alex writes that Jerry fulfilled his Reserve duty on campus with the office of Army Intelligence, “which gave him an early, behind-the-scenes look at the simmering, oncoming conflict in Vietnam. This instilled in him a strong antiwar sentiment, a generation ahead of the late 1960s anti-war movement. His unintentional glimpse into the military industrial complex” set a foundation for his later scholarly work on state power and protests against its security claims.\n\nJerry’s association with Yale anthropologists and the residue of the Chicago school, along with Lasswell’s encouragement, led him to pursue ethnographic methods in fieldwork. His dissertation covered the culture of alcohol use, and he then began studying the occupational culture of police. The result was Justice without Trial: Law Enforcement in Democratic Society (1966). The book was pioneering and inspirational for generations of scholars. In it, Skolnick explained how police exercise their vast discretion and impose situational sanctions without arrest and trial — practices which emerge from their distinctive occupational culture. He identified conflicts with the rule of law inherent in police work despite the fact that police are expected to enforce the law. The work was only the second deeply researched study on police practices (after a neglected 1950 dissertation by William Westley that was subsequently published in 1970, in light of Skolnick’s work). Justice Without Trial, along with the American Bar Foundation’s study of the Administration of Criminal Justice (of which Jerry was a part), and Caleb Foote’s earlier work on the administration of bail, all were instrumental in opening the field of empirical research on legal practices and especially the administration of criminal justice. The book was influential far beyond the study of police and became a model for numerous books and articles by others who examined powerful low visibility institutions. It was the worthy recipient of a number of awards.\n\nSkolnick then turned to researching and writing his second book, The Politics of Protest (1969), along with Elliott Currie and Tony Platt. The book explored the tensions between state control over political protest and First Amendment constraints on that power — constraints which paradoxically must operate to protect disorder. This work became the Task Force Report on Violent Aspects of Protest and Confrontation to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, which was established by President Johnson after the release of the Kerner Report.\n\nJerry’s time at Yale was followed with brief periods of teaching at Chicago, Berkeley, and San Diego, and he settled in Berkeley in 1970 on the faculty of the School of Criminology. Tom Blomberg, today Dean of Florida State’s College of Criminology and Criminal Justice, writes that “I took an undergraduate course from Jerry after he had just completed Justice Without Trial and was able to hear about his time studying the Oakland Police. Such fascinating stories — all interwoven with relevant theoretical interpretation. It was Jerry who recommended that I read Mill’s Sociological Imagination and I remember him recounting how as a graduate student at Yale he would drive to Columbia University to hear Mills lecture.”\n\nMalcolm Feeley recounts that during this time “Jerry served as the second Chair of Berkeley’s internationally renowned Center for the Study of Law and Society (following its founder Philip Selznick) from 1972 to 1984. Under their leadership, the Center supported a number of large-scale research projects and hosted dozens of scholars from around the world. In his teaching, Jerry produced a legion of loyal students, some of whom became leading reform police chiefs in big cities, and others major scholars on the administration of criminal justice, including Elliott Currie, Candace McCoy, Jonathan Simon and Frank Zimring.”\n\nBut it was a turbulent time, and Berkeley’s School of Criminology was disbanded after strong political pushback – particularly from then-Governor Ronald Reagan — against many of its left-leaning faculty. As a tenured faculty member, Jerry then joined the Law School’s new doctoral program in Jurisprudence and Social Policy, where he remained until 1994. During that time, he published extensively in a variety of law and society journals. His insights about occupational culture in policing and social control also resulted in more books. For House of Cards: Legalization and Control of Casino Gambling, Jerry went to Las Vegas and shadowed the security forces regulating gaming, interviewing everyone from pit bosses to casino owners. He managed to obtain an interview with the powerful gangster Meyer Lansky. Arlene Skolnick reports that he thought Lansky recognized “another smart Jewish guy” in Jerry and was willing to confide in him about how casinos skated around legal regulation without triggering crackdowns.\n\nThe next book, co-authored with David Bayley, was The New Blue Line: A Study of Police Innovation in Six American Cities (1986). Candace McCoy, Skolnick’s research assistant at the time, recalls visiting Jerry and David and Arlene at a condo in Truckee, California where David and Jerry were surrounded with piles of notes and articles. “They would write all morning and ski all afternoon. I learned so much from Jerry about criminal justice, but I also learned from him that you have to know when to stop working and get outdoors.” He was an accomplished skier and avid bicyclist, regularly riding to the summit of Grizzly Peak from his home near the UC campus. Jonathan Simon, who also was Jerry’s student and teaching assistant before joining the Berkeley faculty himself, states that “Jerry helped invent the modern law and society scholar, certainly in the criminal justice area. His casual manner, generosity, social justice values and physical adventureousness were models for me of what an academic should be like.”\n\nAs Jerry told it, he got a call from the late Jim Jacobs of New York University soon after he decided to leave UC Berkeley under an unusual retirement offer to senior faculty. Jerry said that Jim was “the godfather” who “made me an offer I couldn’t refuse,” so he and Arlene returned to New York where he taught criminal procedure and seminars on policing at NYU Law School. With James Jacobs, he also served as co-director of NYU’s Center on Criminal Justice. He co-authored with James J. Fyfe his final book on police practices as shaped by the organizations’ militarized culture: Above the Law: Police and Excessive Use of Police Force (1993). After a big party at NYU, Skolnick retired in 2011.\n\nJerry received widespread recognition in the United States and abroad throughout his long career. Among them were Guggenheim and Carnegie fellowships, National Science Foundation support, the presidency of the American Society of Criminology (1994), ASC’s August Vollmer Award (1972), and the prizes for distinguished scholarship from the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences (1984) and the Western Society of Criminology (1988). He was also a consultant to and advisor of numerous local, state, and national government bodies.\n\nSkolnick’s prodigious scholarly output throughout these “two careers” included several edited volumes and text books, one with his Yale colleague Richard D. Schwartz, and still others with colleagues John Kaplan, Elliott Currie, Malcolm Feeley, and Candace McCoy. Most of his books have been reprinted or came out in revised editions and are still in print. Moreover, the name “Skolnick” is associated not only with policing, law and society but with the sociology of the family, as Jerry and Arlene co-authored a leading textbook on the subject that marched into sixteen editions. “It’s tough being married to the world’s leading expert on the family,” he would tell students and co-workers as he left the office in time to get home for dinner.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Arlene, and their two sons, Alex and Michael, all of New York City.\n\nPrepared by: Malcolm Feeley, Professor emeritus, Jurisprudence and Social Policy Program, University of California, Berkeley & Candace McCoy, Professor emerita, Graduate Center and John Jay College, City University of New York\n\nSome of these individuals participated in the ASC Oral History Project.

He will be greatly missed by all who knew him but especially by his partner and husband of 22 years, Bruce Ponder.\n\nHarry E Allen was born in Selma, Alabama on February 16, 1938. His stepfather was a career military officer of his residency in earlier years was geographically scattered. He attended college at Stetson University in Deland, Florida, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1960. He was ordained a Southern Baptist minister in 1959. He continued his education at Vanderbilt University, obtaining a Master of Arts degree before he enrolled at The Ohio State University to study under Simon Dinitz and Walter Reckless. A newly-minted Ph.D. (1969), he taught at Florida State University briefly before being recalled to Ohio to serve as Executive Secretary of the Ohio Governor’s Task Force on Corrections.\n\nHis work for the Task Force led to an invitation to join the School of Public Administration at The Ohio State University as a tenured Associate Professor (1971) and Professor (1975), and as Director of the Program for the Study of Crime and Delinquency. He recruited and surrounded himself with exceptional doctoral candidates and undertook an extensive research program culminating in over 100 papers presented at professional meetings of relevant criminology and justice programs, 20 monographs, many chapters in books, and 19 books authored, co-authored or edited. With graduate student Clifford Simonsen, he authored in 1975 what is the longest continuously published corrections textbook, now in its 15th edition (Corrections in America). He took particular pride in the careers and performances of his former doctoral graduates, including Edward Latessa, Gennaro Vito, Chris Eskridge, Rick Seiter, and Charles Eden, among numerous others. He was an exceptional mentor to his students.\n\nIn 1978, when The Ohio State University was buffeted by arctic weather and a 63 degree wind chill factor, he received and accepted an offer to teach at San Jose State University in the Department of Justice Studies, San Jose, California. He taught a wide variety of core and elective courses and retired in 1998 to return to seminary at the Pacific School of Religion on “Holy Hill” in Berkeley, California. Professor Allen remains Professor Emeritus, San Jose State University.\n\nProfessor Allen was extensively active in the leadership of professional organizations. He was the first criminologist to serve as President of the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences and the American Society of Criminology. In the Academy, he served as Program Committee Chair, Secretary-Treasurer, President (Second Vice-President, First Vice-President, President and Immediate Past President), among other roles.\n\nHarry Allen received many recognitions, awards and honors, including the Block Award (American Society of Criminology). In 1996, he was recognized as the most-often cited scholar in Corrections, was a Fellow in the Western Society of Criminology, Recipient of the Founders Award and an Outstanding Mentor Award of the Academy, among others. In 2001, he was Distinguished Scholar in Residence at the University of Louisville.\n\nIn 2002, Harry Allen began online teaching for the University of Louisville, team-teaching with his husband Bruce Ponder on a wide variety of courses, including Corrections, Community Corrections, Victimology, Alternatives to Incarceration, International Terrorism, Intelligence and Homeland Security, Drug Abuse, and Ethics[1].\n\n________________\n\n[1] The summary of Professor Allen’s professional career was taken from Willard Oliver, Celebrating 50 years, 1963-2013, Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences.\n\nOral History of Criminology Project Interview\n\nMichael Buerger (age 70) left us on Christmas morning, 2021, and the world is a sadder place for those of us who knew him. It is interesting to say that we knew Michael. I considered him my best friend, and there is so much about him that I did not know. Michael was an extremely private person who held his personal life in abeyance and shared little with even his closest friends and acquaintances. I could talk about all his accomplishments, but that is not what made Michael important to us.\n\nDespite his reticence to divulge much about himself and his life, those of us in his world knew the most important thing about him. He had the biggest heart in the world and cared for everyone around him. He was there whenever you asked for help but he never sought help in return. He would put off taking care of himself and turn down offers of assistance so that he did not burden others and so those around him would not be inconvenienced or miss out on something.\n\nMichael met his wife and children and became a family man late in life. While he did not talk much about his family, his joy with them was obvious when you could get him to open up. He would tell me about the successes of his children and he was very proud of their accomplishments. His family, beloved wife, children, his late mother and father, and his brother were the most important to him.\n\nHis work was his life. I was able to lure him to Bowling Green in 2001 to help launch our fledgling Masters in Criminal Justice degree program. He was in his office seven days a week throughout the year, excepting only when he was at a conference, working with colleagues on projects, or taking care of family members. He worked hard to improve our program and the field of criminal justice. He was loved by his students for his undying passion to see them succeed and his caring attitude. It is interesting to hear those words from students when they also found him to be one of the toughest, most demanding faculty members (he was a “grammar Nazi”). He challenged them at every turn, yet his graduates always praised him. As a colleague, he would sit and listen and could discern what was important. He would offer to write up thoughts on a topic for the department and would then produce a long, detailed missive that got to the target with clarity and precision. He worked with many organizations over the years and was sought after to aid them in their missions.\n\nMichael had eclectic interests that benefited from his early classical liberal arts education. He had a breadth of knowledge that often left his colleagues scratching their heads (and I was certainly one of them). He had a broad vocabulary that would often confuse his listeners and challenged us to learn more. Michael loved literature, music, politics, and world events.\n\nI will remember and miss Michael most for his knowledge of comic books and superhero movies. Like myself, he collected comics and we could talk for hours about the story lines and characters, and colleagues could often hear us talking about how the movies got the story wrong and that they did not follow the “real story” from the comics. Those around us would walk away shaking their heads.\n\nFinally, those who knew him will remember his sense of humor. He decorated his office with cartoons and social commentaries that poked fun at everything. He was able to see humor in the world around him and make people laugh. That is something we will all miss. The world has lost a beacon of joy and a fount of knowledge that benefited us all. We are all the lesser because of his passing.\n\nIf I had the “Infinity Stones”, I would bring him back to us. Excelsior!\n\nSteve Lab\n\nArnold Binder, inaugural chair of the Department of Criminology, Law & Society at the University of California, Irvine (UCI), and founder of the Social Ecology program, died Oct. 2. He was 97.\n\nA first-rate scholar and academic visionary, “Arnie,” as he was gladly referred to by many who knew him well, had major positive influences on colleagues, his department, school, campus and the University of California system for over four decades. Former Social Ecology Dean Daniel Stokols notes, “His legacy of academic innovation and community service is renowned and admired by colleagues around the world. He will be sorely missed.”\n\nAfter receiving his Ph.D. in psychology from Stanford University, Arnie joined the faculty at UCI in 1966. He previously was a professor of psychology at Indiana University and a professor of industrial engineering at New York University.\n\nAs the first director of the Social Ecology program, he oversaw its development and growth. Binder founded the program to provide direct interaction between the intellectual life of the university and recurring problems of the social and physical environment. Begun with a handful of professors as “an experiment,” decades later it remains a thriving school with 80 faculty across three departments. Its interdisciplinary roots have since been emulated both nationally and worldwide. Binder outlined a novel roadmap for the program, including a requirement that each undergraduate student participate in public service through a “field study” course. Always ahead of the curve, Arnie championed the hiring of female faculty which saw Social Ecology with the highest proportion of women of any academic unit on campus as early as the 1970s. He oversaw the hiring of first-rate senior scholars including criminologist, Gilbert Geis among others, and freshly-minted Ph.D.s, including psychologists, urban and environmental scholars, and criminology, law and society, and criminal justice researchers C. Ron Huff, Joseph Weiss, Robert Meier, Peter Scharf, Henry Pontell, and Kitty Calavita. He later urged Joan Petersilia, then with the Rand Corporation, to obtain her Ph.D. in Social Ecology at UCI. Soon thereafter, Joan became the only graduate student ever elected President of the American Society of Criminology. Arnie later led the successful faculty effort to appoint Petersilia as a tenured professor upon her graduation.\n\nIn 1992, the UC Regents recognized Social Ecology as a school at UCI, and Binder served as the initial chair of the Department of Criminology, Law and Society during its first year of operation. In 1998 he served as interim dean of the School of Social Ecology, during which time he helped secure the initial grant leading to the creation of first online degree program at the University of California, the MAS in criminology, law and society, which has repeatedly been ranked #1 in the nation.\n\nIn 1972, Binder founded and initially led the Youth Service Program (later Community Service Programs and now Waymakers), an intervention project providing counseling, housing and other services for delinquent youth and their families.\n\nArnie was also heavily involved in University service and affairs, serving in numerous elected positions including Chair of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate, and Chair of the UC system-wide Academic Senate in 1993-94. In 2002, his outstanding contributions to university governance were recognized with the Oliver Johnson Award for Distinguished Leadership in the Academic Senate.\n\nAdministrative roles aside, Binder is known for his work on juvenile delinquency, juvenile justice, mathematical psychology, research methodology, policing, and hate crimes, among other areas. He wrote several books, including “Juvenile Delinquency: Historical, Cultural, Legal Perspectives”, and “The Badge and the Bullet: Police Use of Deadly Force”.\n\nArnie was a Fulbright Scholar in Ireland during the 1974-75 academic year, and was awarded nearly $2 million in grants over a 30-year period for his research. His other honors included being named “Headliner of the Year” by the Orange County Press Club in 1977, being the recipient of the Western Society of Criminology President’s Award in 1985 and the Governor’s Award for contributions in victimology in 1986.\n\nSince 2003, the Criminology, Law and Society Department has awarded an annual $500 Arnie Binder scholarship to one or more doctoral students in recognition of outstanding service contributions. The award is funded by the sales of the book, “Contemporary Issues in Crime and Criminal Justice: Essays in Honor of Gilber Geis” (H. Pontell and D. Shichor, eds., Prentice Hall, 2001).\n\nCurrent Interim Social Ecology Dean, Mona Lynch notes, “His great legacy lives on, as scholars continue to work across disciplines on major social challenges to improve life conditions for those near and far.”\n\nBinder’s daughter Jen Capasso said UCI held a special place in her father’s heart. “We are so proud of the legacy he has left and the lives he positively impacted at UCI and through Waymakers. We hope that his memory and impact will continue into the future.” She also noted that her father loved travel, meals, and wine with his family. “We all miss him beyond words.”\n\nBinder is survived by his wife of 51 years Virginia; children Andrea, Jeff and Jennifer; and grandchildren Julia, Clare, Elliott and Damien, a freshman at UCI.\n\nNo memorial services are planned, but notes may be sent to: Virginia Binder, 100 Timber Ridge Way NW, Unit 620, Issaquah, WA 98027. Donations in Binder’s honor may be made to Waymakers or Carry the Future, an organization Capasso leads that helps refugees.\n\nOur colleague and friend, Mitch Chamlin, passed away too soon on June 3, 2021 in Toledo, Ohio. A close friend described his loss by observing, “there will never be another.” These words perfectly described the force that was Mitch. He was such a unique character: a self-described rebellious Jewish New Yorker.\n\nMitch graduated from Forest Hills High School in Queens, New York and earned his undergraduate degree in History and PhD in Sociology from the University at Albany, SUNY. He joined the faculty at University of Oklahoma in 1985, earned promotion to full professor at the University of Cincinnati, and was a Professor in the School of Criminal Justice and Criminology at Texas State University at the time of his death. Mitch was a prolific scholar in the field of macro-social criminology, and regularly published in the top journals in criminology and criminal justice. Mitch’s work on deterrence, threat, social altruism, and crime control is profound. He was a foremost expert of ARIMA analyses, and employed the technique to study the reciprocal relationship between crimes and arrests, as well as a tool for social policy analysis.\n\nWhile editor of the Journal of Crime and Justice (2007-2010), Mitch devoted much time and effort to mentor authors and provide detailed feedback, and he loved mentoring students and teaching research methods courses to graduate and undergraduate students. In 2011, he received the inaugural ACJS Minority Mentorship Grant Award.\n\nScholarship was central to his identity, but it wasn’t his entire identity. Mitch was high energy, loved basketball, and was an avid runner, finishing the Flying Pig Marathon and several half marathons. An avowed Deadhead, Mitch was also committed to passing along the genius of Monty Python to another generation. He was a devoted husband to Beth. He appreciated smoking a good cigar and drinking a nice glass of scotch. He looked forward to walking his dog, Maggie. He enjoyed spending time with good friends and recounting stories about his graduate training at SUNY.\n\nMitch placed great value in friendship–demonstrated in the over 100 friends and colleagues who participated in his Zoom memorial. He made the extra effort to stay in touch, and was generous with his time–always willing to help others. Even as a graduate student, he would spend significant time to explain concepts to others who didn’t grasp as quickly. Mitch was a deep thinker who was just as brilliant in his everyday conversation. He liked to make the rounds to connect with colleagues for a quick conversation, mostly stand in the doorway to talk about whatever was on his mind and never in a whisper.\n\nBorn in Queens, New York to the late David and Betty Chamlin, Mitch is survived by his wife of 24 years Beth Sanders; as well as his brother, Rick (Theresa) Chamlin; nieces Michelle and Alex; nephew, Nick Chamlin, and great nieces and nephews.

He had a gift for connecting with people, including meeting his lifelong love Yuan Zhang while the two were 16 year old steel workers in Beijing. His formal education was delayed because the Cultural Revolution required him to work in a factory during much of his high school years. After passing the necessary exams, he started his sociological studies at Nan Kai University. With fellow graduate students, Xiaogang translated D. P. Johnson’s textbook on Sociological theory. In 1986 he left China to pursue a Master’s degree in sociology at Baylor College in Waco, Texas. He continued his graduate studies at the University of Oklahoma, and in the fall of 1989 entered the doctoral program in sociology at the University of Buffalo, where he focused on criminology. His interest in criminology related to his search for the causes and reasons for China’s rising crime rate. Xiaogang’s dissertation critically examined rational-choice and deterrence theories, drawing on data that he collected on a county-wide stop-shoplifting program.\n\nIn 1994, Xiaogang was hired as an assistant professor of sociology at UMass Boston, where he worked until his retirement in 2020. Xiaogang was a vital and highly valued member of the Sociology department and university. He helped develop and served as director of a large criminal justice program, bringing to it the same sociological sensibilities that shaped his research. In 2014-2015, Xiaogang was a Research Fellow at Harvard’s Edmond J. Safra Research Center, where he examined the impact of Guanxi (personal business networks) on economic and political corruption in China. Xiaogang was a beloved instructor, regularly teaching courses in cybercrime, criminology, and research methods. Xiaogang was a kind and generous colleague, providing friendship, collaboration, and mentorship, particularly to his sociology colleagues and to fellow Chinese and Asian colleagues across campus. In 2020, the department named a graduate student paper award in his honor to recognize his many contributions.\n\nYuan accompanied Xiaogang right from the beginning of his academic journeys, and together they were able to pursue and live the American Dream. This included happily seeing his son, Simon (who happened to have the same first name as his dissertation chair), and grandchildren live that dream as well. Xiaogang is survived by Yuan, Simon, daughter-in-law Lorraine, and his two grandchildren, Camille and Chandler.\n\nSimon Singer, Northeastern University\n\nAndrea Leverentz, University of Massachusetts Boston\n\nSatyanshu Kumar Mukherjee (13 September 1935 – 28 August 2021) died at his home in Australia, just shy of his 86th birthday. In America Satyanshu was known as Muk, in the rest of the world as Sat. He was a remarkable man and a great criminologist who will be dearly missed by all those who knew him.\n\nMuk already had a Master’s degree from the Tata Institute for Social Sciences in India when he earned the first MA in Criminology ever awarded by the University of Pennsylvania. He later earned two PhD degrees – the first from the University of Delhi (Social Work) and the second from the University of Pennsylvania (Sociology) working with Thorsten Sellin and Marvin Wolfgang. After receiving his Penn degree in 1971 Muk and his family moved to Rome where he served as a Research Expert at the United Nations Social Defense Research Institute. Moving to Australia in 1977, he joined the Australian Institute of Criminology, first as Senior Criminologist and then, in 1985, as Principal Criminologist, a post he maintained until his retirement in 2000. Throughout his career Muk traveled widely and was a Visiting Fellow at the University of Chicago Law School, Visiting Professor at the University of Manitoba and the University of Alberta, and, on several occasions, a Visiting Expert at the United Nations Asia and Far East Institute in Tokyo.\n\nMuk was a prolific scholar whose contributions to international and Australian criminology are astounding. He is the author of well over 100 books, reports, and articles and his work has fundamentally shaped understanding criminal behavior and the criminal justice system throughout Australia. In Crime Trends in Twentieth-Century Australia he collected and analyzed police, court, and corrections data from 1900 to 1976 in one of the largest and most comprehensive trend studies ever conducted. In many subsequent publications Muk continued to examine crime trends as well as exploring related topics such as women and crime, juvenile justice issues, ethnicity and crime, and firearms and violence, to name a few. Whatever the topic, Muk’s research was thorough and meticulous, guided by his strong statistical skills.\n\nWhen he turned his mind to policy he focused on developing criminal justice policies that are both humane and scientifically informed. Nowhere is that more evident than in his work with the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission in Brisbane (1990-93). The work of that commission, heavily influenced by Muk’s research, uncovered long-term systematic political corruption and abuse of power in the Queensland criminal justice system and led to fundamental changes in the law, policing, and the political landscape in Queensland.\n\nThroughout his life he held a steadfast belief in the value of education and what it would bring. In his case, it brought a life of scholarship that included important contributions to criminology in Australia and beyond. It also brought him deep and abiding friendships throughout the world and, most importantly, it brought a wonderful family. Predeceased by his wife of 49 years, Minoti, he leaves his sons Sujit and Jeremy, Sujit’s wife Laura, and his three grandchildren. Muk was devoted to his family and they to him, caring for him until the very end. His was a life well lived. We will miss him but will be forever grateful for having known him.\n\nSubmitted by Terence P. Thornberry and Robert A. Silverman\n\nCharles R. Tittle passed away on May 6, 2021 at the age of 82. He is survived by his beloved partner Mabe, his son Mark, and his faithful service dog Kota. He will be remembered as a passionate scholar, devoted mentor, and loyal friend.\n\nAlways the scholar, Charles was high school valedictorian and pursued a BA in sociology and history then eventually completed a PhD in Sociology. His career included positions at Indiana University, Florida Atlantic University, Washington State University, and North Carolina State University where he was the Goodnight-Glaxo Wellcome Distinguished Chair of Social Sciences. He retired in 2015 and since then spent his time reading, writing and enjoying the outdoors from his cabin in the mountains of Eastern Tennessee.\n\nCharles spent his career illuminating the theoretical intricacies and empirical properties of social control. His early work focused on deterrence and the mechanisms through which sanctions affect behavior. This work, coupled with Charles’ interests in theory testing, measurement and integration, inspired his control-balance theory. The resulting book, Control Balance: Toward a General Theory of Deviance (1995), won the American Society of Criminology’s (ASC) Michael J. Hindelang Award and the American Sociological Association’s (ASA) Albert J. Reiss Distinguished Scholarship Award. In the following years Charles made significant contributions to cross-national research on causes of crime in understudied socio-cultural contexts around the globe.\n\nCharles published several books and his many articles (often co-authored with graduate students and junior faculty whom he mentored over the years) appeared in our discipline’s top journals, including Criminology, a journal for which he served five years as editor (1992-1997). In this role he helped to cement Criminology as the premier outlet for cutting-edge, theory-driven criminological scholarship. In recognition of his contributions, he was inducted as a fellow of the ASC and received ASC’s Edwin Sutherland Award for a career of distinguished scholarship.\n\nCharles had high expectations of himself, his students, and those he cared about. He showed a fierce loyalty to those he was close with, fostering enduring friendships. Charles also loved to entertain. He was an excellent chef and a consummate host. He valued intellectual exchange, but also appreciated light-hearted conversation and a good laugh. Sociology and Criminology are mourning the loss of an intellectual giant and those of us lucky enough to be close to him are mourning the loss of an influential mentor and loyal friend.\n\nLisa Broidy, Olena Antonnacio, Katya Botchkovar, Patty McCall and Jon Brauer\n\nCriminology has lost a giant figure with the passing of Hans Toch at age 91. One of the founding faculty of the University at Albany’s ground-breaking School of Criminal Justice in 1967, Toch was the author of over 30 books, widely admired for their readability, wit, and insight.\n\nHe received the August Vollmer Award from the American Society of Criminology in 2001, and in 2005 he was recognized with the Prix DeGreff award for distinction in clinical criminology by the International Society of Criminology. He was a fellow of the American Society of Criminology and of the American Psychological Association, and in 1996 served as president of the American Association for Forensic Psychology.\n\nWorking with the other founding faculty members of the University at Albany School of Criminal Justice — William Brown, Fred Cohen, and Donald Newman — Toch helped design the pioneering “Albany model” of criminal justice and principally offered classes in the segment of the curriculum devoted to planned change and innovation. Generations of students were mesmerized by his intellect and insights. His opinions resonated loudly in the School’s hallways and faculty meetings, where he engaged over the years in “lively” exchanges with the likes of Michael Hindelang, Leslie Wilkins, Travis Hirschi, Marguerite Warren, Graeme Newman, Michael Gottfredson, and Frankie Bailey. He was not hesitant to offer advice to a series of deans including Vince O’Leary, Don Newman, Terry Thornberry, David Bayley, Julie Horney, and David Duffee. His cigar smoke—until, to the relief of many, it was banned under University policy—his fortissimo and staccato laugh, the pounding of his typewriter, and occasionally his wandering pet dog were among the reminders that Toch was in his office.\n\nAs an immigrant who escaped the horrors of the Holocaust, first to Cuba and then to the United States, Toch was a fiercely patriotic American, inordinately proud of his military service in the Navy defending San Diego during the Korean War. It was in the Navy that Hans met Doug Grant, his co-author on books like Reforming Human Services: Change through Participation (1982) and Police as Problem Solvers (1991), to whom he credits some of his best ideas. Grant, who became the research chief for the California Department of Corrections was also Toch’s gatekeeper into criminology. Toch’s initial research in psychology had little to do with criminal justice. His formal education began with a psychology degree from Brooklyn College in 1952 and a Ph.D. from Princeton in social psychology in 1955, where he was once accused of “trouble-making masquerading as research” when he proposed to study a student protest against the wearing of academic gowns in the dining halls.\n\nIn his early career, he wrote an important and fascinating book on The Social Psychology of Social Movements (1965) that included an interrogation of the Nazi movement, lynch mobs and cults. That work led to stints as a Fulbright Fellow in Norway and a Visiting Lecturer in the Department of Social Relations at Harvard in the 1960s. However, it was the chance occurrence of being asked to teach a course on legal and criminal psychology while at Michigan State University in the 1960s that led to his lifetime passion of criminal justice reform.\n\nThere were broadly three strands to this research (although these strands frequently and fruitfully entwined) including: the social psychology of violence as in his classic book Violent Men, the lived experience of incarceration as in Men in Crisis: Human Breakdowns in Prison, and the reform of policing in books like Cop Watch. In all of this work, there is a common theme of “change through participation” which he developed in his last great work, summarising a lifetime of work: Organizational Change Through Individual Empowerment. In short, Toch had an unshakable belief in the idea of bottom-up reform, involving staff and ‘clients’ in the process of organisational change. He had searing disdain for elite experts or abstract theorising. He believed in ordinary people and the value of democratic participation to create genuine change. In an authoritarian field based around control and restraint, Toch also stood out as a believer in humanistic approaches to corrections. He saw “handcuffs or tight supervision” as “a superfluous management tool as well as an obstacle to effective performance.”\n\nNo one in academia worked as hard as he did, writing every single day on his electric typewriter. He wrote, “I would argue that in doing psychology it must be the doing as much as the psychology that counts as productivity.” There was no doubting his own productivity, in terms of the sheer volume of output. But, far more importantly, Hans contributed some of the most original and transformative ideas to the field of criminal justice, including ground-breaking work on the concept of ‘community policing’ and ‘therapeutic communities.’\n\nHans himself sees his career path as “more of a cautionary tale, redolent with incidents in which aspirations appeared to have been blunted by obdurate realities and successes proved annoyingly evanescent.” Indeed, to the end, he never felt like he achieved all that he could, but it never stopped him trying.\n\nHis greatest achievement, he would say, was the bestselling book Violent Men, first published in 1969, released numerous times since, including a recent anniversary edition with American Psychological Association Books. In this incredibly readable work (among the first popular academic books on the subject of violence), Toch pioneered the, now fashionable, method of participatory peer research, utilising peer researchers (prisoners, ex-prisoners and ex-police officers) in both the data collection and data analysis processes in an attempt “to blur the line between the observer and the observed.”\n\nOn a personal level, Hans was not a fan of memoirs, although he read many written by friends and contemporaries. “I might as well record that my private life has been conventional and my inner life is overwhelmingly pedestrian. My job has consisted of teaching at the university level. Some of my students claim that in doing this I have come across as intimidating, but I am in fact a pussycat.”\n\nWith his ever-present cigars, beard and thick Austrian accent, Hans bore a passing resemblance to Sigmund Freud and was not averse to playing up the associations, although his relationship to psychoanalytic theory was an appropriately ambivalent one. He once wrote: “if you want to become a well-rounded psychologist, a smidgen of psychoanalysis is good for you,” and among his first ever publications was a 1956 psychoanalysis of “eccentric mail sent to the United Nations.”\n\nHe had a deep love of Scotland and the single malt scotch he collected on his visits there, and he did important work for the Scottish Prison System. In 2003, the Institute of Criminology at the University of Cambridge held a conference in his honor on the subject of the Effects of Imprisonment, timed with his 75th birthday. Toch sat with the legendary convict criminologist John Irwin (one year his senior), both of whom were going deaf by then, and also had no compulsion about loudly conversing during the lectures (“What is this kid trying to say?” “No idea but I wish he would get on with it”). They were the picture of the balcony-seated muppets Statler and Waldorf with a running critical commentary of the proceedings.\n\nToch retired in 2008, but maintained an active writing agenda in the ensuing decade. His last book, a co-edited volume, Living on Death Row: The Psychology of Waiting to Die (American Psychological Association, 2018), received the 2019 Association of American Publishers Award for Professional and Scholarly Excellence (PROSE Award) in Social Sciences: Psychology. At the time he left his academic post Toch was a Distinguished Professor in the SUNY system, and in every meaningful sense of the term.\n\nToch is survived by his son Jay Toch, his daughter Michelle Dinsmore, his son-in-law Daniel Dinsmore and his two grandchildren.

A professor of sociology at New York University until her retirement last year, Jo received a BA in sociology at the University of North Carolina, Greensborough in 1972, her MA in sociology at Emory University in 1981, and her PhD in sociology at Indiana University in 1989. Jo was an accomplished and highly regarded scholar and a deeply committed teacher and mentor. Her studies on criminal sentencing, domestic violence policies and practices, responses to sexual violence, gender stratification in the legal profession, and other topics were published in the top journals of her field including Law and Society Review, the American Journal of Sociology, Social Problems, and Criminology and Public Policy.\n\nAt the time of her death, Jo was completing a comparative justice project that examined the role of state building in efforts by elites to select transitional justice tools capable of attaining the often-contradictory goals of justice and state building. Her research is widely cited and will have a lasting effect on sociological and criminological scholarship for years to come.\n\nJo valued teaching and mentoring. She was recognized for her teaching by New York University in 1999, when she was awarded NYU’s Distinguished Teaching Award, and in 1992, when she was awarded NYU’s Golden Dozen Teaching Award. She directed NYU’s interdisciplinary Institute for Law and Society and its Law and Society graduate program for many years. Jo was an excellent mentor of graduate students. Several of her Ph.D. students received dissertation awards from the National Science Foundation or the National Institute of Justice, and her Ph.D. students have gone on to obtain faculty positions at prestigious universities and have themselves made important contributions to the discipline. Jo has also influenced universities around the world, teaching or conducting research at the University of Vienna and at NYU’s programs in Prague and Abu Dhabi.\n\nJo was an active member of several professional associations, having served as a member of the Board of Trustees of the Law and Society Association, organizer of multiple programs for the American Society of Criminology, and council member of the Law and Society Section of the American Sociological Association. She also served on the editorial board of the American Sociological Review, Law and Society Review, and Law and Social Inquiry.\n\nJo had an inspiring sense of adventure and curiosity. She was beloved by her family and friends, maintaining strong, cherished bonds with friends for decades. She had a wonderful laugh, cheered for her friends’ successes and comforted them at times of sadness and loss.\n\nJo was born in Dunn, North Carolina on November 20, 1949. Her parents were Wallace and Annie Laurie Dixon. She is survived by her loving husband, Mari C. Engracia, her brother Wallace (Dana) Dixon, sisters-in-law Danna Sue Dixon and Ann Tart Dixon, as well her stepchildren, Jennifer, Judith and Jay and many nieces and nephews. She was predeceased by her parents and her brothers EB Dixon and David Dixon. Memorial contributions can be made to the American Tinnitus Association.\n\nHarold G. Grasmick, Professor Emeritus of the Department of Sociology at the University of Oklahoma and one of criminology’s great minds, left our world on April 4, 2020. Harold and his co-authors, Charles Tittle, Bob Bursik and Bruce Arneklev (Grasmick et al. 1993), developed a 24-item attitudinal scale based upon their interpretation of Gottfredson and Hirschi’s (1990) conceptual definition of self-control. This measure, known as the Grasmick Scale, continues to be used widely in tests of Gottfredson and Hirschi’s theory. This publication cemented Harold’s national reputation as a scholar and renowned criminologist. Harold mentored and published research with many students. Over the course of his career, Harold published a book, 54 research articles, and has been cited over 13,500 times. At the University of Oklahoma, Harold was recognized for his achievements with several awards, including the David Ross Boyd Professorship, a Presidential Professorship, and the Kinney-Sugg Award for Outstanding Professor.\n\nHarold served as Chair of the OU Sociology Department from 1982 to 1988, which was a challenging time institutionally as OU was transforming to a national-level university with an emphasis on research. At that time, there were two units, Sociology A and Sociology 1, and new faculty lines were offered in only the research unit. Harold was hired to teach and lead in research, and as part of this, he developed the Oklahoma City Survey, which provided research and statistical training for students. His focus on the creation of knowledge through research also positioned the department to be approved by the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education to grant doctoral degrees. This new teaching style on the graduate level, which focused on learning through research, allowed students to become active participants in the profession through their research, conference presentations, and publications.\n\nHarold’s research was about illegal behavior and norm violations in general, particularly guilt, shame and embarrassment, and their parallels to legal or formal sanctions. Much of his work in the 1990s focused on neighborhoods, social control, and crime, including his book co-authored with Robert J. Bursik, Neighborhoods and Crime: The Dimensions of Effective Community Control. Inspired by the Oklahoma context, Harold noticed that religion was influential to society, and he began to focus his research on how religion shaped people’s attitudes towards punishment, and he published several articles in this area.\n\nHarold was a supportive colleague and dear friend. One colleague remarked, “His presence was huge and unforgettable. He was everything you could ever want in a professor. He was brilliant, accomplished, funny, and just a little bit naughty.” Harold deeply cared for his students, and he was a friend of the OU Department of Sociology. Upon his retirement, he helped establish a fund to support graduate students in mentored research during the summer. As he described it, it was a way to keep our students busy with research and away from working in the bars next to campus. Through the Grasmick Summer Fellowships, Harold’s devotion to students and passion for the creation of research continue.\n\nHarold is remembered as a loving grandfather, father and son and will be missed by many. He is survived by his son Jacob, daughter-in-law Kate and grandson Atlas, of Denver, Colorado.\n\nLoretta Bass, University of Oklahoma; Trina Hope, University of Oklahoma\n\nJames B. Jacobs, who was Warren E. Burger Professor of Constitutional Law and the Courts at New York University – and a proud Fellow of the ASC – died on 19th March 2020 from complications of ALS.\n\nJim was one of America’s most prolific, wide-ranging, and important criminal law scholars. A researcher of astonishing energy and ambition, he achieved world-wide renown as a leading authority in a dozen different specialties, from imprisonment and criminal records to corruption and organized crime, by way of gun control, drunk driving, and hate crime. Academic audiences in Asia, Europe, and Africa have marveled at his grasp of detail, his piercing practical insight, and his contrarian disregard of conventional wisdom. As a criminologist and legal scholar, he stood at the pinnacle of academic achievement and distinction.\n\nBorn in Bronxville in 1947, the son of a lawyer and a home-maker, Jim grew up in Mount Vernon and attended local public school. He went on to graduate from Johns Hopkins with a BA in Sociology and from the University of Chicago with a JD and a Sociology Ph.D.. His doctoral dissertation was a tour de force that combined prison ethnography and organizational sociology with ‘law and society’ and was published in 1977 as Stateville: The Penitentiary in Mass Society – a classic that has been in print ever since.\n\nJim began his career at Cornell where he was jointly appointed in Law and Sociology before moving to NYU School of Law in 1982. He held visiting appointments at Columbia Law School, University of Capetown, and University of Leuven, as well as a J.S. Guggenheim Fellowship. At NYU, Jim taught criminal law, criminal procedure, and federal criminal law, and a variety of other topics including the regulation of vice, guns, and cybercrime. He was a devoted institutional citizen who did more than anyone to make NYU a leading center of criminal law and criminal justice scholarship. For three decades and more he was, as a colleague remarked, “the sun around which New York’s criminal justice community orbited.”\n\nIn 1983, Jim established, and became the Director of, the Center for Research in Crime and Justice at NYU Law School. In the decades that followed, Jim created and ran the Center’s monthly Colloquium series and weekly Criminal Law Seminars, both of which brought together policymakers, judges, prosecutors, and practitioners with academics to create a unique criminal law community, centered in NYC but stretching across the globe. To his fellow professors at NYU Law, Jim was the quintessential colleague, whose relaxed, unpretentious demeanor and breezy good cheer made them happy to belong to the same institution. To students and entry-level academics, he was the supportive, challenging mentor to whom many of them owe their careers. And to visitors, whoever they were and wherever they were from, he was the open-handed host, issuing invitations, drawing them in, connecting them to a vibrant intellectual community here at the heart of New York City.\n\nLet me say a little about the influences and ideas that Jim brought to bear in his astonishing oeuvre – which included 17 books and more than one hundred scholarly articles.\n\nJim’s early works bear the unmistakeable stamp of his training at Hopkins and Chicago and the world-class mentors he found there. Without Norval Morris, there would be no Stateville. Not because of Norval’s ideas – the intellectual influence of Edward Shils is more prominent in the book – but because it was Norval who first dispatched Jim to do research in the Illinois prisons and taught him the importance of realism and pragmatism in the pursuit of the ideal. And without Morris Janowitz, it is unlikely that Jim would have written two books on the socio-legal aspects of the military (though perhaps Jim’s own military service provided insights that Janowitz helped him develop into a sociological thesis.)\n\nJim went on to become a leading authority on both of these topics. But his most distinctive writing, and his characteristic intellectual voice, is most apparent not in these books, nor even in the books on organized crime. Jim’s signature style is, I think, most fully on display in the series of books he wrote on the ironies of American social policy. To explain what I mean, let me distinguish three distinct ‘genres’ that, I would suggest, together constitute Jim’s body of published work.\n\nFirst genre: the work on prisons and imprisonment.The leading works here are Stateville: The Penitentiary in Mass Society; Guard Unions and the Future of Prisons; and Perspectives on Prisons and Imprisonment. And alongside these books there are dozens of articles: including classics such as “Sentencing by Prison Personnel” in UCLA Law Review (1983) – an unmatched tour de force on a topic that was, before Jim wrote it up, completely ignored.\n\nThese prison publications are notable for their insiders’ view and their up-close understanding. But Jim’s most original contribution is a sociological one: it is his insistence on situating imprisonment within the large-scale changes taking place in American society and revealing the surprising effects these have had on the inner life of the prison.\n\nSecond genre: the work on Organized Crime and Racketeering.This section of the collected works consists of 5 books that form a remarkable series – perhaps the most sustained effort to understand racketeering ever undertaken by a single scholar. These organized crime books mostly tell quite positive stories, describing prosecutions that worked; industries that have been cleaned up; and labor unions that have been purged of corruption. If I remind you of some of their titles you’ll see what I mean: Breaking the Devil’s Pact; Gotham Unbound; Busting the Mob; and Organized Crime and its Containment\n\nThird genre:his work on “the ironies of American social policy”If the study of organized crime finds Jim in an optimistic mood, this third genre is much more sardonic in tone. I think of these books as constituting the “Jacobean studies in skepticism.”Each of these contrarian books takes a policy reform that has been universally embraced by liberals and by the legal academy – more or less the same thing, Jim would have said – and proceeds to show, in loving detail, why these reforms backfire. Books in this group include: Can Gun Control Work?; The Pursuit of Absolute Integrity; and Hate Crimes: Criminal Law and Identity Politics. And there are several articles that follow a similar formula, dousing liberal ideas with large quantities of cold water: “Should Hate Be a Crime?” “Can We Ever Clean Up the Javits Center?” and “Will New York’s Safe Act Make Us Safer?” While Jim is best known for his books on prisons; the Mafia; and criminal records I believe that his “studies in skepticism” are the ones that best express his distinctive authorial voice and his personal world-view.\n\nIsaiah Berlin famously said that there were two kinds of writers: foxes (who know many things) and hedgehogs (who know one big thing). In these terms, Jim was undoubtedly a fox. He certainly didn’t believe in “one big thing.” He was a painstaking empiricist and a hard-headed realist who abjured all forms of dogma and who was allergic to any kind of grand theory. As a result, Jim’s thinking was always interestingly at odds with the conventional wisdom.\n\nAs a colleague, Jim was tough-minded, and opinionated, and often contrarian. He was also ever-present: these 17 books didn’t write themselves – and it was clear that he relied enormously on his remarkable wife Jan Sweeney, whom he adored, and who enabled his academic work, as well as their family and cultural lives, while holding down an academic job of her own. As an intellectual, Jim was beholden to no one: there was no party line; no big theory; no ideological purity. His attention was always trained on the real world, on facts and practices, and on what criminal justice actors were actually thinking and doing.\n\nJim’s work, did, of course, contain certain working assumptions. These a prioris include: That not all problems are solvable; That more government is usually not the best solution; That problems like crime and corruption are endemic and have to be regulated; That zealous regulation is liable to produce its own problems; That the role of organized crime in the history of the nation has never been fully recognized. But the lesson that Jim’s work – and his life – told over and over again, was that we need to have faith in people, to look for their positive virtues, and to work together to celebrate our common interests and work to make the world a better place.\n\nJim was a world-renowned academic and a prolific author of well-researched, book-length monographs – the last of which, a study of New York gun control, appeared late last year. But among those who knew him – and there are hundreds and hundreds of us – Jim will mostly be remembered for his warmth, his humor, and his humanity. Above all, he will be remembered for his ability to bring people together in ways that enhanced their lives.\n\nAstonishingly, given his productivity as a scholar, Jim was also renowned for the remarkable extent of his “hinterland” – the busy, adventurous, fun-filled life that somehow co-existed with his non-stop academic activity. Jim was an avid skier, an aficionado of the arts, a Yankees fan, a dog-lover, a NYC boulevardier, a loving husband, father, and grandfather to Jan, Tom, Sophi, and his four young granddaughters – and this too would be absolutely essential to any accounting of who Jim was and of the life he led.\n\nHe had an amazing gift for forming and sustaining friendships. He cared for people. He wanted to know how they are. He never forgot to call, to email, to stay in touch – sometimes over decades and great distances. And, with a twinkle in his eye and something funny or interesting or contrarian to say, he would make us laugh, and make us think, and make us better. Quite simply, Jim enriched the lives of everyone around him. And those of us who were privileged to count ourselves as friends of this distinguished colleague, illustrious scholar, and altogether remarkable man long cherish his memory and smile when we hear his name mentioned – as it will certainly be for decades to come.\n\nDavid Garland, NYU.\n\nNicholas Kittrie passed away in December at the age of 93. He served as the President of the American Society of Criminology in 1975. A professor at American University’s Washington College of Law, Dr. Kittrie was the College’s longest-tenured faculty member, and taught for more than 50 years. See below for a more detailed obituary.\n\nhttp://www.legacy.com/news/celebrity-deaths/notable-deaths/article/nicholas-kittrie-1926-2019-pulitzer-prize-nominated\n\nMichael J. Leiber’s (1956-2020) friends and colleagues are sad to announce his untimely passing. Mike should be best remembered for his desire to see the world become a better, fairer, and more equitable place. He believed in advancing knowledge to correct the many challenging social ills in society, and this concern for social justice guided his career. Mike grew up in and cherished his home town, Milwaukee. He earned his BA from Marquette University, and then entered the MA program at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. He transferred to The University at Albany, where he earned his MA and Ph.D. He held academic positions at the University of Northern Iowa (1989-2005), Virginia Commonwealth (2005-2010), and the University of South Florida (2010-2020), where he also served as department chair (2011-2019). His research focused primarily on juvenile justice and disproportionate minority contact with the criminal justice system. He authored over 100 publications, including 76 articles and book chapters, and more than two-dozen government reports, and received more than $700k in grants and contracts. Mike was the recipient of several scholarly awards of which he was proud, including those from the Division of Minorities and Women (Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences), a lifetime achievement award from the Division on People of Color and Crime (American Society of Criminology), the W. E. B. Du Bois Award from the Western Society of Criminology, and a Distinguished Alumni Award from the University at Albany, among others. He served as editor of the Journal of Crime and Justice, and more recently, Justice Quarterly. He was often an invited speaker at programs and sessions sponsored by the Office of Juvenile Justice & Delinquency Prevention, Washington, D.C. Many knew Mike in a variety of capacities: distinguished scholar, colleague, mentor, and friend. In his personal life, he was a devoted animal lover to his multiple cats and “fidos.” An avid sports fan, he loved his Green Bay Packers, along with the Milwaukee Brewers and Bucks, and the Wisconsin Badgers. He maintained a pristine early 1970s Alfa Romeo Spider. He is survived by his beloved wife of eight years, Lana. Condolences may be sent to her at: 4946 Ebensburg Drive, Tampa, Florida, 33647.\n\n(October 20,1931-March 14, 2020) Our esteemed, longtime colleague and friend, Ted Palmer, passed away peacefully on March 14, 2020. Ted’s research and legacy are classic to the field of criminology and corrections. His contributions include being one of the “firsts” to implement a randomized trial in a juvenile justice setting and pioneering the identification of programmatic factors that affect the quality of interventions. In his 2004 presidential address to the ASC, Francis Cullen recognized Ted as one of the 12 people who “saved correctional rehabilitation.” Ted was later recognized by the ASC Academy of Experimental Criminology which awarded him the 2011 Joan McCord Award.\n\nAs lead researcher for the California Youth Authority and the California Department of Corrections during the 1960s and 1970s, Ted produced a remarkable body of research. One of his most well-know projects, the Community Treatment Project, utilized a rigorous experimental design, amassed a wealth of knowledge about juvenile offenders and developed strategies for identifying and addressing their differential needs. Throughout his career and in retirement, Ted addressed the issue of correctional effectiveness. Most notably, he countered a 1974 article in which Robert Martinson reviewed 231 correctional program evaluations and concluded that no therapeutic model worked to reduce youth recidivism. Ted meticulously reanalyzed Martinson’s data and reported that 48% of the 231 studies actually showed positive or partially positive results and that many programs had worked for some offenders and not others.\n\nIn retirement, Ted was a regular attendee of the ASC meetings. He befriended and advised many younger scholars. Although he never pursued a career in academe, he was a precious mentor who offered wise and gentle counsel. He was regularly sought after as a dinner companion and valued friend. In 2005, Ted and a former colleague established the Marguerite Q. Warren and Ted B. Palmer Differential Intervention Award, an award offered through the ASC Division of Corrections and Sentencing. Ted helped to insure the legacy or rigorous research and instilled in many the value of research in action settings and collaboration with front line agencies.\n\nFriends and colleagues were fascinated by Ted’s life. He was born in 1931, after his parents, Mary Korn and Jack Puchalski, left Poland to escape economic hardship and rising antisemitism. Ted is a veteran of the Korean War where he served as an Army medic providing mental health services to soldiers suffering from “shell shock” (PTSD). He later received his doctorate degree in psychology from the University of Southern California. He was multilingual and an avid student of astronomy and art. In his 70s and 80s, Ted pursued a rigorous travel agenda, which included long trips to such exotic places as the South Pacific Islands, the Great Wall of China, Mongolia, Antarctica, India, Nepal, and Tibet. At the time of his death, he was planning another trip to Southeast Asia which included paragliding in the Seychelles and a stop in Brazil on the way home.\n\nTed’s wife, Mildred, passed away in 2019. He is survived by a daughter, Cara, and a son and daughter-in-law, Clay and Jocelyn.\n\nWe were privileged to know you, Ted,\n\nPat Van Voorhis, Francis Cullen, Fay Taxman, Phil Harris, and Kathleen Heide\n\nCindy J. Smith, past chair of the Division of International Criminology, past Secretary/Treasurer of the Division on Corrections and Sentencing, and most recently, Director of the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI), passed away January 18, after courageously battling cancer.\n\nCindy was born in Fostoria, Ohio. She held a Ph.D. in Social Ecology from the University of California Irvine, a M.S. in Education Administration from the National University, Irvine, a M.S. in Justice from American University and a B.A. from Baldwin Wallace College.\n\nShe began her career at the University of Baltimore, as Associate Professor and Director of the Master’s in Criminal Justice Program (2000-2005). As a first-generation university student, she mentored others like her as well as international students, particularly Turkish National Police managers. Intrigued by Turkey, she enjoyed a year there as a Fulbright Senior Researcher. She shifted smoothly between the academy and policy work, serving as Chief of the International Center at NIJ (2005-2008), Associate Professor at the University of Baltimore (2008-2010), Lead Foreign Affairs Officer at the Department of State (2011-2012), and Senior Coordinator for International Programs in the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons at the U.S. Department of State (2012-2015). In 2015, the Secretary-General of the U.N. appointed her Director of UNICRI, the first woman to serve in this capacity. She retired from this post in 2018.\n\nHer research covered a wide range of topics, including juvenile justice, corrections and human trafficking. She was instrumental in convincing international policymakers to use criminological knowledge to better guide their work.\n\nCindy’s friends remember her as unfailingly positive and a force to be reckoned with. She thought the world was flawed, but woke up every day asking herself, “what can I do about it?” She started “saving the world” one child as at a time by serving as a foster mother and adopting children. Frustrated that she could not do enough, she pursued her doctorate so that she could do more. Ultimately she set her sights on helping the whole world and joined the U.N. She was humble, energetic, and unforgettable. Her stories were legend and made us laugh until we cried. We will miss her greatly.\n\nShe is survived by her husband Rick Smith, seven children, 16 grandchildren and 5 great grandchildren.\n\nRosemary Barberet, John Jay College of Criminal Justice\n\nJoanne Savage, Illinois State University\n\nJodi Lane, University of Florida\n\nPAUL E. TRACY, JR.\n\nPaul E. Tracy, Jr. passed away unexpectedly on January 5, 2020, shortly after retiring from the University of Massachusetts Lowell where he served as professor and graduate director for the School of Criminology and Justice Studies for 8 years. Paul’s long and successful career also included serving on the faculties and impacting the lives of many students at the University of Texas at Dallas, Northeastern University, and the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nPaul’s earned his B.A. from Rhode Island College and his Ph.D. in 1978 in Sociology from the University of Pennsylvania. He was Senior Research Associate for the Criminal Justice Program Evaluation Center at the Mitre Corporation, then returned to Penn as a faculty member to collaborate with his mentor, Marvin Wolfgang, becoming Director of the Graduate Program in Criminology and part of the move from Arts & Sciences to Wharton. He served as Associate Director of the Sellin Center for Criminology & Criminal Law, a position that enabled him to help assure that the 1958 Philadelphia Birth Cohort study was able to include the follow up to age 26 for those 27,160 subjects. In 1985, Paul moved to be close to family and taught at Northeastern for 7 years, leaving to help establish a crime and justice program at the University of Texas at Dallas, where he worked for 19 years, before returning to his favorite part of the country and joining the Lowell faculty.\n\nA skilled methodologist and staunch advocate for improving criminal justice policies, Paul’s scholarly contributions focused on measurement and analysis of criminal careers over the life course, juvenile justice, drug prohibition, prisoner re-entry, and capital punishment. He was author or co-author of eight books, numerous articles and technical reports. He also served as Editor-in-Chief of Crime & Delinquency for 15 years. His scholarship was recognized by the Western Society of Criminology President’s Award in 2003.\n\nA beloved teacher of courses at all levels, he served on or directed nearly 40 dissertations. Paul’s outstanding teaching was accorded Distinguished Teaching Awards by both Penn and Northeastern, the Social Science Teaching Award by UT-Dallas, and the Chancellor’s Outstanding Teaching Award by the University of Texas Systems.\n\nPaul was a proud father, husband, and patriot. He cared about veterans, especially those who had served in Vietnam, as he had. He loved fast cars, spicy food, and practicing the martial arts, at which he was an expert. He will be missed by many.\n\nSubmitted by Kimberly Kempf-Leonard\n\nSome of these individuals participated in the ASC Oral History Project.

He started his career in 1970 at the Institute of Criminology, a precursor for the current Institute of Criminology and Legal Policy at the University of Helsinki. His very first study, ‘Everyday Violence in Finland’ (1971), paved the way for the development of national victimisation surveys and indicators for the measurement of crime and crime damages, a field in which Kauko played a leading role throughout the 1980s and 1990s. As a result of his activity, Finland also became an active participant in international victimisation studies from the very first survey in 1989 onwards.\n\nKauko took an active part in international co-operation and in the development comparative criminal statistics, both as a member of the European Sourcebook Working group and as a member of several working groups of the European Society of Criminology.\n\nKauko was a member of the board of the ESC in 2005-2006 and he acted as president of the association in 2006-2007. He was also the key organiser of the 3rd annual meeting of the European Society of Criminology, held in Helsinki in 2003.\n\nKauko was a key person in Nordic criminological meetings from the 1970s onwards. He gave lasting input into the development of Nordic research co-operation and to the building of connections between researchers and research institutes across the Nordic countries, continuing here the work that had been instigated by his predecessors at the Institute of Criminology, Inkeri Anttila and Patrik Törnudd, during the 1960s. Kauko Aromaa was a long-standing member of the board of the Scandinavian Criminological Council in 1989-2002 and he acted as president of the Council in 2001-2003.\n\nIn 2000, he was appointed as the director of the European Institute for Crime Prevention and Control, affiliated with the United Nations (HEUNI). Thanks to his vast networks, Kauko engaged the institute in various European research projects, thus expanding HEUNI’s research endeavours into new areas. This included research in 2008 on labour exploitation and human trafficking for the purpose of forced labour; he was among the first in Europe to take up this topic. Upon retirement in 2001, he was appointed a professor at the University of Manchester, continuing his career in academia. He continued to participate in European research projects until his death.\n\nIn November 2011 Kauko Aromaa was awarded the Freda Adler Distinguished Scholar Award by the American Society of Criminology. Kauko travelled to Washington, D.C. to receive the award together with his wife, Kaarina.\n\nAs a criminologist, Kauko could be characterised as one of the last ‘Genuine Generalists’. His expertise and interest covered a broad field of major issues of criminological interest; an increasingly rare feature, when research seems ever more to know more and more about less and less. In his capacity as a researcher, he was brimming with ideas. His reactions to societal changes were quick and incisive, and he had broadened the horizons for research into cross-border crime, corporate safety and human trafficking already by the 1990s. A subject which particularly intrigued him in the 1990s was the criminality in Finland’s neighbouring countries—both Russia and the Baltic countries. Kauko worked closely with Baltic colleagues and contributed with significant input into the development of victimisation surveys in the region.\n\nKauko Aromaa did not isolate himself in the ivory tower of academic research. Instead, he took his media responsibility seriously and was always willing to comment and consult with the media. In the course of numerous TV interviews and newspaper reports, he became a familiar figure for the Finnish audience as a criminologist who had the ability to place problems into their appropriate scale and to do so in a language that everyone could understand.\n\nGetting Kauko to attend a meeting, or to make a speech or presentation, was not difficult. In his own words, ‘even the worst seminar is better than staying at home’. Indeed, for the ESC-members and his Nordic colleagues, Kauko was a regular sight at conferences and seminars—his figure pushing through the crowds, always with his black ‘Marimekko bag’ full of all sorts of strange stuff, joking, laughing and talking practically to everyone. During the social events around the conferences we— more often than not —had the opportunity to witness Kauko’s talents as a singer, often inspired either by songs from the resistance movements or Finnish tango. There wasn’t an occasion that would have been unfit for a little song, whether it would be a high-level Nordic criminology meeting with several hundred participants or a singing contest with an ex-Russian general at HEUNI international advisory board dinners.\n\nKauko carried the intellectual and social heritage of the radical 1960s — the protection of the weak and socially marginalised — throughout his whole life. As a student, he was already one of the founding members of the social liberal movement established in Finland in 1967 against social injustices and for the improvement of prisoners’ rights and the living conditions of homeless people. And after his retirement he continued to work in the Federation of Mother and Child Homes and Shelters, supporting children and families in difficult and insecure situations and preventing domestic violence.\n\nThose who have had the opportunity to work together with Kauko remember him as a colleague who never lost his temper and good mood, and who always had time for discussion—and always with a point. We remember him also as a man who loved books, so much that he seemed to want to be literally to be surrounded by them. Some of us still imagine Kauko sitting in his room and surrounded by a massive fortification of stacks of books and papers so that his presence could only be confirmed by the occasional glimpse of his beard and spectacles between the piles.\n\nBut most of all, we remember Kauko as a well-read person within whom education and intellectual curiosity combined with friendliness and a good sense of humour.\n\nMARGARET E. BEARE\n\nDr. Margaret E. Beare (1946-2019) Professor of Sociology and Law, York University and Osgoode Hall Law School\n\nOn August 10, 2019, Margaret Beare passed away after a courageous battle with cancer. For those in the criminology community that knew Margaret, she was a passionate believer in the advancement of knowledge to ameliorate the many social ills that challenge a civil society. She was a regular attendee at the ASC Conferences, as well as the renowned Cambridge Conference at Jesus College. A frequent contributor to local Canadian news organizations on issues related to crime, organized crime, and public corruption, Margaret was a prolific researcher who published many articles, co-edited and co-authored several books, as well as publishing, Criminal Conspiracies: Organized Crime in Canada (2015).\n\nDr. Beare was instrumental in establishing the Nathanson Center for the Study of Organized Crime and Corruption in 1996. Committed to exporting the research of those who challenged traditional notions of organized crime, Margaret was in the fore-front of ensuring that organized crime research was given a diverse platform from which new and innovative approaches could be researched, critiqued and successfully implemented. Inviting renowned social scientists from across the globe to participate in conferences and symposiums organized and funded by the Nathanson Center, Margaret championed conflicting means and methods in describing organized crime and its attendant social and political consequences. She was certainly not shy about enlisting the cadre of conflict and Marxist criminologists in the “war against organized crime,” advancing the belief that much of what is defined or described as organized crime are crimes committed by the state against its people. This certainly set the stage for much after-hours discussions that veered into the wee hours of the morning.\n\nA world traveler, Margaret ultimately adopted the love of her life, Nhai Nguyen-Beare. A devoted mother, Margaret provided Nhai with a wholesome home filled with many academics that came to visit her on a regular basis in Toronto, Canada, exposing Nhai to the diversity that Margaret came to believe was the essence of life. She will be sorely missed by her daughter, and her sisters. And without doubt, by the community of criminologists and students that she infected with her sense of optimism and spirit of adventure. Rest in peace our dear friend and colleague.\n\nFrederick T. Martens, former President of IASOC\n\nTribute to Our Feminist Scholar Sister\n\nLast night we lost our dear sister, Helen Eigenberg. Helen was an amazing scholar and friend who was also an incredibly dedicated teacher and community and campus activist. And she had the best sense of humor.\n\nHad Helen not been stricken with stage 3B breast cancer at the age of 38, at the same time she was denied tenure in an outrageous act of sexism (the case was settled out of court), we are confident she would have published even more cutting-edge feminist contributions to criminology. We can’t recognize everything, but here are some examples:\n\nEigenberg, H. (1990). The National Crime Survey and Rape: The Case of the Missing Question. Justice Quarterly, 7(4):655-671.
