        "text": "De-registered, even criminally charged and jailed psychiatric professionals can skip states, even countries and continue practicing. Some of the most infamous mental health criminals continue to \"care\" for the most vulnerable in society by simply changing cities or countries.\n\nBecause of this, the following database is being presented as a public interest service to law enforcement agencies, health care fraud investigators, immigration offices, international police agencies, medical and psychological licensing boards, and the general public.\n\nIt is a list of convicted mental health practitioners reported to CCHR International since 1990. It is, by far, an incomplete list and does not include all cases reported to law enforcement agencies or the courts.\n\nYou, too, can contribute to this public warning by reporting and sending documentary evidence about criminal arrests and convictions in the mental health industry to CCHR International: Fill out our Abuse Form.\n\nMany psychiatrists have an intimate knowledge of criminality-one which has nothing to do with the professions involvement in the expert witness field.\n\nBetween $20 billion and $40 billion is defrauded by the American psychiatric industry in any given year.\n\nAt least 10% of psychiatrists admit to sexually abusing their patients: In America, that's at least 4,500 rapes and, internationally, more than 15,000 rapes.\n\nPsychiatrists, psychologists and psychotherapists have the dubious distinction of having laws specifically designed to curtail their tendency to commit sex crimes against those in their charge.\n\nA 1992 study of Medicaid and Medicare insurance fraud in the U.S. showed psychiatry to have the worst track record of all medical disciplines.\n\nA close inspection of their disastrous results, reveals that psychiatrists are the last people who should be in charge of improving literacy, drug and criminal rehabilitation, or to be used as \"experts\" in our courts.\n\nShow all database entries.\n\nSearch results"
