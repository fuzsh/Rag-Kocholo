        "text": "Today in History:\n\nOn July 20, 1969, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin became the first men to walk on the moon after reaching its surface in their Apollo 11 lunar module.\n\nOn this date:\n\nIn 1917, America’s World War I draft lottery began as Secretary of War Newton Baker, wearing a blindfold, reached into a glass bowl and pulled out a capsule containing the number 258 during a ceremony inside the Senate office building.\n\nIn 1944, an attempt by a group of German officials to assassinate Adolf Hitler with a bomb failed as the explosion only wounded the Nazi leader.\n\nIn 1951, Jordan’s King Abdullah I was assassinated in Jerusalem by a Palestinian gunman who was shot dead on the spot by security.\n\nIn 1976, America’s Viking 1 robot spacecraft made a successful, first-ever landing on Mars.\n\nIn 1977, a flash flood hit Johnstown, Pennsylvania, killing more than 80 people and causing $350 million worth of damage.\n\nIn 1990, Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan, one of the court’s most liberal voices, announced he was stepping down.\n\nIn 1993, White House deputy counsel Vincent Foster Jr., 48, was found shot to death in a park near Washington, D.C.; it was ruled a suicide.\n\nIn 2006, the Senate voted 98-0 to renew the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act for another quarter-century.\n\nIn 2007, President George W. Bush signed an executive order prohibiting cruel and inhuman treatment, including humiliation or denigration of religious beliefs, in the detention and interrogation of terrorism suspects.\n\nIn 2010, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to approve Elena Kagan to be the Supreme Court’s fourth female justice.\n\nIn 2012, gunman James Holmes opened fire inside a crowded movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, during a midnight showing of “The Dark Knight Rises,” killing 12 people and wounding 70 others. (Holmes was later convicted of murder and attempted murder, and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.)\n\nIn 2015, the United States and Cuba restored full diplomatic relations after more than five decades of frosty relations rooted in the Cold War."
