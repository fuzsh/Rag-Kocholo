        "text": "NEW YORK — When the 68th Tony nominations were announced late last month, several actors found themselves nominated alongside a costar — or, in one case, two costars — in the same category. A Gentleman’s Guide to Love and Murder‘s Jefferson Mays and Bryce Pinkham were both nominated for best actor in a musical; A Raisin in the Sun‘s Sophie Okonedo and Anika Noni Rose were both nominated for best featured actress in a play; and, most notably of all, Twelfth Night‘s Paul Chahidi, Stephen Fry and Mark Rylance were all nominated for best featured actor in a play.\n\nWhile this was undoubtedly received as good news by the nominees and their respective shows, it does beg the question, at least from a stats geek like myself: wouldn’t those individuals have had a better chance of winning their category had they not been forced to compete against another actor — or other actors — from the same show? After all, doesn’t the presence of multiple nominees from the same show increase the likelihood that fans of that show will break in different directions — some voting for one of the show’s nominees, others voting for another or others — which would thereby undermine all of their vote totals and increase the likelihood of someone else sneaking in for the win?\n\nI decided to investigate this theory to see if it is, in fact, supported by history.\n\nFEINBERG FORECAST: A Look at the Tony Awards Field\n\nTo begin with, I looked at every race in the history of each of the eight acting categories — best actor in a play, best actress in a play, best actor in a musical, best actress in a musical, best featured actor in a play, best featured actress in a play, best featured actor in a musical and best featured actress in a musical — and identified the instances, prior to this year, in which two people from the same show competed against one other and in which three people from the same show competed against one another. (Lower down in this post, you can see a category-by-category breakdown of all of these examples.)\n\nThen, I looked to see how many of those head-to-head matchups — or head-to-head-to-head matchups, in some cases — resulted in one of the costars pulling off a victory over the other(s). My findings: of the twosomes, 74 of 155, or 48 percent, still mustered a win, and, of the threesomes, nine of 13, or 69 percent, took home a prize. That means that, overall, in situations in which more than one nominee from a show occupies an acting category, one of those nominees emerges victorious… almost exactly half (49%) of the time.\n\nThere was no scientifically-significant pattern that I could identify suggesting why some people were able to overcome “friendly competition” and others could not. Many of the folks who did so were young newcomers or old veterans; many had the larger (or largest) of the competing parts; and many of them were in shows that were also well represented in other categories.\n\nSome of these stats may be of interest to this year’s competitors. Mays and Pinkham might like to know that 11 of 19 (58 percent) prior instances of twosomes competing in the best actor in a musical category produced a winner; Mays probably has the better shot this year, although most regard it as Neil Patrick Harris‘ to lose for his performance in Hedwig and the Angry Inch. Okonedo and Rose might find it interesting that 9 of 20 (45 percent) prior instances of twosomes competing in the best featured actress in a play category produced a winner; Okonedo probably has the better shot this year, and, in my humble estimation, is probably neck-and-neck with Casa Valentina‘s Mare Winningham. And, just because they number three, Chahidi, Fry and Rylance shouldn’t despair just yet: of the three prior instances of threesomes competing in the best featured actor in a play category, two (67 percent) produced winners.\n\n* * *\n\nBest Actor in a Play\n\n5 of 14 (36%) twosomes produced a winner; 0 of 0 (0%) threesomes produced a winner; 5 of 14 (36%) overall produced a winner\n\n1958: Look Homeward, Angel (Hugh Griffith and Anthony Perkins) = both lost\n\n1960: The Best Man (Melvyn Douglas and Lee Tracy) = Douglas won\n\n1966: Philadelphia, Here I Come!
