        "text": "Hello I want to start by saying thank you all for your service. The bravery is so admirable. As an American born & raised, I can never repay all the Veterans for their sacrifices.\n\nMy grandfather is Sgt. Larry Buckles. He is really like my father. He adopted me at 10 & raised me my entire life. He is all I've ever known. He is not only my grandfather - he is my dad, mom, best friend, & hero.\n\nHe was drafted in 1966 & November that year he was sent to Fort Bragg then to Fort Jackson for training if I'm not mistaken. He then went to Korea & was in Camp Alex Williams from April 1967 - May 1968 he did a 13 month tour. He was promoted to Sgt while serving. After his tour, he was stationed in Fort Hood for a while. His discharge certificate stated he was released in 1972.\n\nI'm so proud to be his granddaughter. He lost all his military things in a house fire. He was devastated. He not only lost his home but all his regalia. I'm trying to figure out how I can replace his uniform & insignias. I want to surprise him because his father's house caught fire like 40 years ago & he's not seen nothing military related since then. I want to surprise him with a replica of his uniform & insignias just to show him that we haven't forgot his service to the country. I want to show him how much we appreciate his sacrifice.\n\nIf anyone knows how to replace these things or even just knows him feel free to text 2764699399 or email tabbi44@gmail.com. I am so appreciative of all you brave people. Thank you for your sacrifice for our country. You'll never be forgotten. God blessLooking for anyone that was in the Charlie Company that TET in Saigon, Vietnam from around June 1969-1970 possibly 1971. My Biological Father was William C. Harris his nickname then may have been Willie, Doc or Bill during this time. I am his only full blood biological child and I was made aware early on that I may very well have a half brother by photos he would show me. He would never tell me his name, his mothers name or any info. My biological father has now passed as of July 6, 2020.I would like to know any information that can be provided to me to help me find the woman who may be the mother of my half brother. We are only less than a year a part in age less than 12 months prob between 9-11 months. I can provide proof that I am his biological daughter and will expect proof from anyone that may have been in his Unit/Battallion during the war. Thank you for your time. My name isVernon J Hall. I was a soldier in co B of the 125th signal battalion based in Cu Chi after arriving in Vietnam 4-15-1968. After spending several weeks as a radio operator at semi-mobile fire support bases, there was a call for volunteers and I agreed to go to a signal site as a security force for a month assignment(this was in the 1st day or two of July). That site turned out to be on top of Nui Ba Dinh, and the only way in and out was via helicopter, and that was only when the mountaintop wasn’t enveloped in clouds! The month ended up being 6 weeks before we were replaced on 8-17-1968 late afternoon. The site was hit at 2AM the next morning in pouring rain and fog. 8 soldiers were killed, and 15 enemy soldiers killed before they abandoned the attack. Those of us that left the day before were quite fortunate, to say the least! I would like to get in touch with the guys who shared the fighting bunker and sleeping hooch for that 6 weeks. The bunker/hooch was right next to the helicopter landing pad and had a separate min-bunker with a 50 caliber machine gun, which wasn’t operative because it “needed parts”!! And if you never found out, this same base was overrun 5-13-1968, something they never told us when seeking volunteers in July!! Please contact me at: vernjhall@gmail.com or 651-210-2179Hi! i am looking for my dad's dad, my grandpa. He was a soldier in Vietnam who had a child with my grandma in 1972. All I know about him is that\n\n1. His name may be Miller. He would have been stationed in Long Binh in 1971 and Tay Ninh in 72. z\n\n2. He had long blonde hair\n\n3. My grandma remembers the number 62 and letter d, though she does not know what they mean (62nd unit possibly?)\n\n4. He had 3 stripes on his shirt\n\n5. He possibly knew he had a kid. She said she remembered saying she was pregnant.\n\n6. My grandma's name is Dam but he might have known her as Dong since they mixed up her name when she applied to work there.\n\n7. He might have been in his early 40's in 1971\n\nThis is all my grandma vaguely remember. Please contact me if you have any information on who this might be or if you were in the area at the same time!I am looking for anyone that was in Vietnam, Thailand, or Laos between 1969 & 1971 who may have been with my husband Ivan Smith. He was a bulldozer & crawl tractor op. he past away in July,2016. He would mention a gentleman quite often ... he was an African American man, he was called Whitey, he was Ivan's best friend. I would very much appreciate any information concerning my husbands stay in the war, as well as Whitey! I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THE VETERANS, THANK YOU FOR SERVING, & RISKING YOUR LIVE TO SAVE OURS! I AM SO proud to have been married to Ivan for such a long time. I still say we are married, we did not divorce, he passed away! I hope to hear from someone. Thank you so much, Ivans wife Ruby! \"rubyivan1983@yahoo.com\" \"TO THOSE WHO HAVE FOUGHT FOR IT, LIFE HAS A FLAVOR THAT THE PROTECTED WILL NEVER KNOW!\"\n\nI came upon this site while surfing the net and knew that the above statement would have special meaning for all Vietnam Vets.. I served with 3/22nd, 25th Infantry Division out of Tay Ninh as an infantryman. Fought the NVA on the slopes of Nui Ba Den twice with numerous firefights in and around the area bordering the Cambodian border. Remember your Christmas in Vietnam? Mine was spent on an ambush patrol near the Cambodian border. After 5 months in the field, I was pulled to the 93rd Evac at Long Binh to work with soldiers suffering from combat fatigue. Over the last 10 years, I chronicled my tour of duty and the response has been overwhelming. With your military background, you may find it interesting. There are presently over One Hundred 5 Star Reviews worldwide\n\nI believe that you will relate to this true story of the fight for Nui Ba Den and the struggles and sacrifices that the soldiers who served their country in Vietnam endured. Thousands of Vietnam Veterans have proudly endorsed these memoirs. Please check out the website at courageonthemountain.com with the accompanying introduction. It will make you proud for your service and all the men and women who served our country during the Vietnam war.\n\nI proud that you made it home brother! Thank you for your service and May God Bless!\n\nGeorge ReischlingMy name is Mildred Ann Crane and I am looking for James T. Coffey.He was a Marine and he served with my brother William H. Johnson ( Bill)in the providence of Thua Thien, South Vietnam in 1967 & 1968. They were providing security for a group of engineers that were building roads.My brother was accidentally shot by another soldier in their bunker on June 12th, 1967.Jim wrote my family for close to a year and then the letters stopped coming. There were 3 other men in the bunker when it happened. One was named Jerry and the other two I don't know their names. I really would like to fine Cpl. James T. Coffey. If anyone else remembers this happening would you please contact me applepie1944@gmail.com. Bill would be 70 yrs if he were alive so I guessing that everyone else would be close in age. I pray that there will be some one out there that will remember the accident and will contact me. Thank so much for any and all help that I get. Hi\n\nI'm looking for anyone that was in Vietnam in 1969 with my Dad his name was Almond Tuttle But everyone called him Dick.\n\nMy dad died on November 1 1977 in a car accident and I like to meet anyone that was in Vietnam with him.\n\nThing is I don't know much about him just what I can remember when I was little girl and now I'm 47 and didn't get to ask him about what it was like there in Vietnam I like hearing old story like that and I would like to tell my boys and my Grandbaby's more about their Grandfather Tuttle they only know what I can remember and what my mom and Grandma's told me.\n\nSo if there anyone out there that was with him you can look me up on Facebook look for Sheila Ann Wood my marred name or send me a email and that is motherwolf.47@outlook.com thank youGUEST: I am writing this message on behalf of my father James Edward Polk, Spc5th Class Tech Sgt, 2nd Armory Div, Stationed in Ft.

MAT GOD CONTINUE TO BLESS AND WATCH OVER OUR BRAVE VETS! Hi my name is Eligio Roman, I could swear that I spend the whole year of 1968 in Pleiku, Hispanic young and silly wasn't thinking about keeping records at that time, now old and still silly, I would like to find people that either remember me or were on the same unit at that time, my unit was \"628th Signal Maintenance Company\" witch I believe was part of the \"62nd Maintenance Battalion\" I remember that we used to wear a plastic patch color orange that had 62nd, 628th, 149th and another unit, I have one of those but can not find it at the moment, I also have a few pictures, some names I vaguely remember are, Estes, Dupond, Reyes, Martinez. I remember our sleeping quoters were tents with wooden frame and sandbags all around them, our working place was a either concrete or wooden building maybe 100 or 200 feet away from the company area, we had a mess hall, half round metal building as an Club and groups from out of country used to come to entertain us, I know there was a medical facility close by if not in the same area, I remember TET offensive, they never made it through at least on our side, they did came close though.\n\nWell don't remember much after this, if anybody care to help you can reach me at \"roman40@verizon.net\" I'm in New Jersey, USA.\n\nThank you, Sincerely\n\nE Roman \"TO THOSE WHO HAVE FOUGHT FOR IT, LIFE HAS A FLAVOR THAT THE PROTECTED WILL NEVER KNOW!\"\n\nI came upon your site while surfing the net and knew that the above statement would have special meaning for you. I served with 3/22nd, 25th Infantry Division out of Tay Ninh as an infantryman. Fought the NVA on the slopes of Nui Ba Den twice with numerous firefights in and around the area bordering the Cambodian border. After 5 months in the field, I was pulled to the 93rd Evac at Long Binh to work with soldiers suffering from combat fatigue. Over the last 10 years, I chronicled my tour of duty and the response has been overwhelming. With your military background, you may find it interesting. There are presently over Ninety 5 Star Reviews.\n\nThis is the true story of the fight for Nui Ba Den and the struggles and sacrifices that the soldiers who served their country in Vietnam endured. Thousands of Vietnam Veterans have proudly endorsed these memoirs. Please check out the website at courageonthemountain.com with the accompanying introduction and pictures and you'll gain a new respect for all the men and women who served our country during the Vietnam war.\n\nI proud that you made it home brother! Thank you for your service and May God Bless!\n\nGeorge ReischlingHELLO I AM LOOKING FOR ANYONE THAT SERVED WITH MY DAD SP5 1ST SGT.

HE ALWAYS WANTED TO FIND THEM BUT GAVE UP AFTER HITTING THE BRICK WALLS AS MANY OF THE MEN DID WHEN THEY ATTEMPTED. MY DAD WAS PROUD OF HIS TIME THERE HOWEVER DIDNT SPEAK MUCH ABOUT IT. I KNOW THAT HE HAD SERIOUS ISSUES WITH A COMMANDING OR HIGHER RANKING OFFICER TUTTLE. DUE TO THE LAST NAME BEING THE SAME AS THE NAME OF THE TOWN HE GREW UP IN. I BELIEVE THE GERMAN CHILD WITH GERTA WAS BORN IN MENNHEIM HOSPITAL. HE HAS 3 CHILDREN THAT HE RAISED AND WE ALL WOULD JUST LIKE TO SEE IF WE CAN IN FACT LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT MY DAD FIND OUR BROTHERS/SISTERS AS DADDY DIED 04/14/2013 AT THE AGE OF 62 HIS DOB IS 04/27/1950 IF YOU HAVE ANY INFO THAT MIGHT HELP IN ANY WAY PLEASE DONT HESITATE TO EMAIL MELISSA.D.JONES1982@GMAIL.COM OR CALL 4055034693I served with B Troop 1/17th Cav 82nd Airborne Div in Viet Nam 1968-1969. I have contact with Reid Lyon, Charlie Severino, Rae Dehnke, Bob Thuel and Clint Dykeman. Can't seem to find anyone else. If anyone out there recognizes the name please respond via e-mail. I'd love to make contact. Arrived in '68 in Phu Bai. Met some great guys at the 101st NCO club then had to move south. While up north I ran an ill-fated ground surveillance operation that buried sensors along trails at night that would self-destruct with any movement. We found much human movement every night but the sensors were unreliable and failed all the time. After a while we loaded all of our Tracks on LSTs and sailed south to set up base camp alongside Tan Son Nhut airfield. We secured the Hoc Mon bridge, ran convoy security, defended the airfield, ran night ops and patrols out to Cu Chi tunnels and rubber plantations, secured the engineers while they stripped back the dense foliage in the area, found many tunnels, weapons and vc personnel and my personal favorite the late night village cordons that would either trap the vc living in the village or initiate some night fighting while watching Arc light strikes in the distance. If anyone remembers any of these activities then there's a good chance you might remember me. I would love to hear how any brothers are doing. God BlessI am looking for Grey Jefferson...

I'm still looking for letters from ANYBODY that was there!!!(smile!!!) 2212 Chamberlain Ave Chattanooga Tn 37404 STAY WELL!!!!! DUCK!!!My brother Granville Lynn Noland aka \"Shorty\" served in the US Army Company D, 20th Engineer Battalion (combat), APO 96318, 4 February 1969 to 3 February 1970 There was an incident that happened. It occurred during a convoy mission from Kontum to Dak Tho. About halfway to Dak Tho one of the dump trucks back wheel went over a land mine and was blown up. It was a mine that was missed during the mine sweep. Several soldiers including Lynn were injured by this explosion.\n\nHe is receiving VA disability, during his disability review they asked him to account for his time spent in Vietnam, he included this incident. The government has stated that this incident did not occur. While this does not bother my brother it does offend me. The men and women that serve this country should be recognized. While this incident will not change his disability rating, it should not be disregarded. Lynn’s memories are starting to fade quickly and I want him to know now that the government recognizes his sacrifices during his service.\n\nA few of the men who served with him are:\n\nHooper Davison\n\nDennis Oliver\n\nMark S Smith\n\nDavid Will\n\nRonald Vizzo\n\nIf anyone knows these men or remember this incident I would appreciate an email alicetaylor62@gmail.com\n\nThank You Alice Taylor (Bigbee)Today I posted the followingon Woody's web for 3/187. I want to thank you for sharing your photos. When my husband was shipped out of country, his camera and photos disappeared. Here s my post in case your readers have any info to help. Thanks and Welcome Home!\n\nMy post:\n\nMy husband was on Team 7, chosen by the Col. The 4 men on Team 7 all had red hair. When he was medivaced out, his team was the last one that was together. His job was recon. He had been in a pagoda when it was hit with RPG rounds. The blast gave him a concussion and caused him to have seizures. He had schrapnel all over his body when he reached the hospital in Japan. After that firefight, he said hhe was dazed and acted like he was on autopilot. He remained in country for some tie. When he was medivaced outy, he was having a problem with sores all over his body. They told him it was something rare and he needed to be sent back to the states for treatment. He returned to Fitzsimons. Subsequently he has applied for a Purple Heart but was turned down because he could not give the location of the incident or names and verification of others to prove the incident really happened.\n\nHis name is Jerome Witt (aka Jerry), after their medic was killed, he took the Aid bag on missions and the guys called him Doc. He also carried the radios and ammo. He was there in ’68-’69. He can only remember one name and that is Ernie who was from Jacksonville Florida and had worked for White’s Grocery before being drafted. I am looking for anyone that can remember Team 7 and help locate any of the members. Perhaps someone knows the First Sgt name and he might have some recollection. Jerry’s military license to move freely about VietNam and to live in villages, was signed by aman named Ralph H Ballard (rank unknown). Perhaps he may have a recollection. Our phone number is 360458-7062 if you have any details that might help.\n\nI see how Jerry struggles with things even today. He has PTSD and I can’t even imagine the things he saw and lives with today. I appreciate this site and am proud and thankful for him and what he has been through. I am thankful to all of his brothers of this war and all I can say is THANK YOU AND WELCOME HOME!!!Hi. I am searching for my brother who was in the marines in Duc Duc Vietnam in 1969 and was injured by a grenade. His best buddy was named Fox. My brother can't remember his first name anymore. My brother was told that Fox was killed by the grenade. Several family members have been to the Memorial Wall but was not able to locate his name. My brother was Gary Thomas Phelps with the CAP 2-9-2 3rd Marine Amphibious Force in Duc Duc Vietnam in 1969. His sergeant was Sgt. Cook. That is all that he can remember. Also there were 2 other guys in his platoon with the nicknames of Cricket and Bear. If you have any information or pictures, please email me at kimsfourpuddleducks@yahoo.com. My number is 252-508-5746. Please text me first as I don't always answer to unknown numbers. Please help me help my brother. He has COPD and is on oxygen full time and his health isn't good. I want to give him some info or pictures or set up a phone call or visit. PLEASE HELP! Thanks so much.I am the wife of a recent retired Msgt and we have started looking for medals awarded to my father from Vietnam. His name was Richard Dowis Johnson and he served from 7/1967 to 5/1969. His helicopter was shot down but he feel out before it crashed. He told my mother that he was \"carried down the mountain by the biggest black man he ever saw\". My dad I don't believe knew who this soldier was. He said he passed back out when he realized it was an American soldier carrying him. Dad dies January 31, 1979. I have my husbands shadow box over the fireplace and I want to honor dad in the same way. So, he was from Tucker Ga, went to Walter Reed then Fitzsimmons for multiple back surgeries, he was in the Army and made E-4 rank. He was a Specialist. I have tried all the traditional was for a DD-214 etc but no one has record of him. He died in the VA in Atlanta but they \"do not have his records\" neither does the Archives. Anyone remember my dad?

We had many American graduate students who were avoiding the draft. We also had some graduate students and professors who had been to Vietnam. The Americans who had not been to Vietnam had lots to say about the war, those that had been there said very little, if anything at all.\n\nIt was a strange time, we could see the war on TV, yet it seemed unreal. As a result, many Canadians were very ambivalent about the war.\n\nIt moves me to see all the veteran responding to your photographs. The war must have been very hard on them. It is impossible for me to know what it was like to have been in the Vietnam War. However, because of your gallery I am starting to get feel.\n\nBrilliant gallery and I will be back often to read more comments. Way too many to read in one evening.\n\nCheers,\n\nDavid Vote My brother Kenneth Julian Palafox.USMC 1963 ..STATIONED AND FAR AS I KNOW WAS ALL OVER THE DMZ.Ken came home but killed a man hea in Texas.Kenneth is dead since 1976\n\nI know my brother before He was only a boy and only 17 years old.Mama had to sign him over.Ken sent all his money to take care of us hea..mama was workin 2 jobs and we was dirt poor.Ken was so proud and me too I LOVED MY BROTHER AND WROTE HIM EVERY DAY..HE WAS A BAD MOTHERFUCKER..THE ONLY COMFORT TO HIM WAS THE MARINE CORPS.In the end ken took his life in prison.I spoke to him before at the county and begged him to stop ..but he wanted to die for an eye for an eye..THE MARINE HE WAS ALWAYS TO THE END/..I CRY EVERY TIME I SPEAK HIS NAME...I`m on facebook if you guys know Ken Please call on me here in Texas 936-560-0344 I`m Randy Palafox hea in Nacogdoches ,Texas we are mostly a family of warriors whom have given all for our country ..WE LOVE THEM MARINES..I PRAY FOR YOU BOYS LIKE YA`LL MY OWN SONS AND FAMILY...

Thank you and all that had to share the that moment in life that seemed like forever in a lost world. Bless you all!Co B 3/187 101 Airborne Vietnam 68-69\n\nMy Uncle Robert VandenBerg was WIA April 25 1969. For several months I have search the web trying to find anything with no . So let me tell the story.\n\nIt was April 25 1969 in Vietnam and their mission was to try to take \"Hamburger Hill\" from the top. He was in 1 of 3 helicopters. His was shot down and he was thrown from the helicopter. When he finally come to a stop he had rolled down the hill. He was alone and his rifle was snapped in half from the impact. He had 2 broken legs and a tree branch went thru his legs. It was quiet for a moment then he could hear the enemy talking and moving around. Then he heard someone call his name and ask him where are you and are you hurt. He told him were he was and that he was hurt and his rifle was broke in half. The brave soldier made his way to him and sat protecting him until they both could be rescued. My Uncle Believes that brave soldier name is Terry Gann. He see in 1 more time after that day on the hill. He was at the Hospital in Hong Kong. My Uncle received a Purple Heart and several other medals. Once he was back in the states he never told anyone about his timein Vietnam\n\nSeveral months ago I found my Uncle living only a few miles from me. I had not seen him in 12 years since my Mothers Funeral. I decided to go surprise him. He did not even know who I ways til I told him my name. He live in an RV that is parked at the back of a Dairy. I as the one who also got a shock. He keeps to himself. Leaves the dairy only to ride a bike to a local store. I spent several hours with him. I asked him if he would tell me the story of how he was wounded in Vietnam and the above story. He final told me the story. He said that was the 1st time he had told anyone. He also told me that he was the lucky one. He missed Hamburger Hill. He said he would have been killed there.He made it home and alot of did died on that damn hill. If any one knows any information or if there is any vets that was there or may know my uncle please get in touch with by email shelli.godinho@yahoo.com.\n\nThank you to all the soldiers who have served to keep us safe.iam looking 4 info on my father phillip r anderson he did 2 tours in vn he was 3rd marine cag the goverment has not any records on his milltary tours they only have that he was in the war but will not give any more detail he was shot and spent time in camron bay vn in country for 6 weeks he relly needs those records to get va help they will not up his diasibalty at all his missions over there were in reg marines and then swicth to cag 3rd marine divison now that he did his missions for our country it would seem that the millatery should honon my father with at least his records he now has lost a leg and can not find any info to help his va disabillaty im not sure y im telling u all this unless u might be able to send me in some other direction that might help me to help my father . my main reason for emailling u was to let u know that i have pictures of a soldier walt wayn lewis i know he is on the wall so if u need a face to go with his name please i would be happy to help he was my fathers best friend i understand i was a child of the vn war thank you.I was with the 1Bn, 2nd of 320th/ Bravo Co. Air Artillery Assault, 101st Airborne.. Went on Patrol with the 1Bn, 2/327th Alpha Co. 71' Two weeks later we ended up in Phu Bai and were on our way for an R&R at China Beach.. Three of us were from the arty and the rest Grunts.. They took 8 of us off the Chinook for guard duty and the rest, 36 men, went down in the Chinook out side of Da Nang.. First we thought they crashed into the sea. Found out 30 odd years later, they were shot down and couldn't be found because of the jungle... Was just wondering if there's still some one alive who was taken off that flight. It happen just after Thanksgiving, we were at Fire Base Eagle for Thanksgiving... Two days later, they went down and I was on guard duty in Phu Bai... Any one left alive from that time? Cpl. Gary Pierson, (alias Zapper) 101st Airborne... \" Balls of the Eagle Sir!\" Love the road sign pic... Kind of hard to find people you served with in the 101st, when most are dead......

Especially when you didn't know where you were in the first place and trying to remember 40 years later..... Good Luck to all looking for some one..

Thanks Janet Marie(Wages)Benjaminhi thanks for the pictures brought back some memories again i thank you.. I served from may 68 to may 69 was in alot of areas but the only 2 things I remember was when i was in recon with 16 other men, there as a firefight just b4 i left my unit due to infections in my hands and the only man that I remember was a last name of PENA who am sorry to say was killed in action along with a number of my brothers ---- I meet with one who recieved a purple heart in Fort Benning Ga. I know its a long shot but if any one out there remembers a wacky LT. who unfortuantly was killed and does remember a SGT PENA please contact me by e/mail ccla30yrs@yahoo.com ---- when i had left my unit i was then reassigned to cam rahn bay as a gunner on a chinook.... I just wish I could somehow attain some information, records to where i was.... Its been 42 yrs hard to remember anythin except that I was there I am a 40 year old UK citizen born 26 November 1968. This is going to sound absolutely crazy but I think I may have been a Vet in a previous life! Whether I was US or Viet I am unsure although my partner says I speak some kind of eastern sounding tong in my sleep. When I was young I was in a children's home which I escaped from. I was chased into a corn filed by police I took cover by diving down into the corn so they couldn't see my position. I was 8 years old how would I know that would have worked. When I was in my teens I was touched by Vietnam war films or shows, So much so my guts would feel wrenched buy what I was watching. Also recently I was watching something where there was machine gun fire, I noticed my finger spasming as though it were on the trigger of that gun that I was hearing.\n\nGuys I am not a kooky nor do I mock the heroic actions of almost all who gave their lives in those times. Guys I don't know whether or not reincarnation is something that any of you believe in but I strongly feel a connection to these times and I feel a desperate need to find out more. My name is Russ Colbeck and I am looking for archives of photographs maybe i looked the same! Anything that I can look through. Please if anyone has any SERIOUS suggestions please email me at russ.colbeck@yahoo.co.uk\n\nThank you and god bless.

JOHNNY PAUL GRISSOM , MY UNCLE PAUL.I HAD A COLLEGE PROFESSOR WHO WAS ALSO A COMBAT PHOTOGRAPHER HIS NAME IS JACK MARTIN AN SOME OF THE PHOTOS LOOK SIMILAR TO HIS.IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CONTACT HIM HE IS TEACHING AT THE ART INSTITUTE OF PHILADELPHIA.I THANK YOU FOR THIS GALLERY IT HELPS PUT A FACE TO A DIFFICULT PLACE IN TIME,I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE SACRIFICES THAT YOU AND THE OTHER SOLDIERS WHO FOUGHT IN THE VIETMAN WAR HAVE MADE SO WE CAN EXPIERIENCE TRUE FREEDOM.I FOUND THIS SITE AND WAS LOOKING FOR PITURES OF FUK BIHN AS MY FRIEND WAS STATIONED THERE IN 1968.HIS MOTHER WROTE HIM 365 LETTERS THAT YEAR,SHE PASSED ON TODAY AND I WAS HOPING THAT YOUMAY HAVE SOME PHOTOS RELATED TO THIS AREA AS I WANT HIM TO FIND THE STRENGTH THAT HIS MOTHER INSTILLED IN HIM. THANK YOU,JACOB W. HAFFERMANDear Mr. Calmes,\n\nMy dad was also a combat fotog in Viet Nam 68-69 for the Army. There was a couple of rolls of pictures that he took for a reporter that represented himself as from National Geographic. He said he took some really great pictures, but he never saw them developed or got his rolls back, and National Geographic had no record of the said reporter. Do you know of any stories like this in Viet Nam or have any information you can share. It would be nice if one day my dad could get his pictures back. When he came back he was stationed in CA and only took one roll of film the whole time he was there bc he was so put out by how his talents were used as a fotog. I think if he could get his pictures back it would kind of close \"the loop\" for him so he wouldn't feel it was all a waste. I think those may have been the only pictures he took over there that were not of dead bodies.i am an Vietnamese exchange student in U.S. And here, in this state not many people-i mean young people know about Vietnamese war and Viet Nam also! some of them dont even know how to pronounce the word Viet Nam exactly! i was so disappointed of that anyway! in my country, i had to study history of that war when i was first grade and keep going until now! it always is reminded to us how horror the war was! and what the people under that war had to stand and see and pass... nowadays, these young American person dont know anything about that war-the dark past, i wonder because that was 30 years ago! not so long time! and it s still hurt many people also in VN and U.S, my host parent even got some family's members died in the war, too. and it mean they didnt let to be studied of that when in secondary school! some others in high school but they dont know, either.\n\nso, they completely support the nuclear bomb even though they got 2 big events in Japan under the second world war(Hirosima and Nagasaki) and the Iraq, i am so amazing of it! they are so.... i just mean a little young American here not all but anyway, that presents for a side of U.S that i used not to learn before...Dear Mr Calmes,\n\nI was too young to remermber correctly the Vietnam War ... I saw a lot of images of this war .. However, I know that this gallery is just a little and \"beautiful\" part of the war. There was a lot of horror scenes like every other wars ... But, behind your photos, we can imagine and feel a very little part of those horrors scenes and that, means your photos are very very powerful and they transmit me, the \"feel\" of moments ...\n\nThat's what we call good photos. When we can feel the instant of the photo is taken, about 1/250th second, and live that moment, the real sens of the photography is there ... goal is touched !\n\nCongratulations for thoses photos but overall, for sharing us thoses moments ... which were too long for everybody, I am sure ....\n\nAll my respect to you and to all soldiers of that war!\n\n(PS: excuse my bad english)\n\nWhat a powerful, revealing, touching collection of pictures from this costly, ghastly war -- a war now being compared to Iraq, with good reason. There is so much here, I will return and review again, and post comments on many of your pictures. For now, I am adding you to my FAVORITES, another way to guide viewers to come and visit what you have so magnificently posted. I do not think we can know enough detail about the terrible sacrifices of the men and women who were involved in Viet Nam during and especially after coming home. Seeing these haunting photos grabs at my heart and makes me wonder at the short-term memories of our \"leaders\", politicians, military brass -- that they cannot recall from one war to the next the toll that is taken upon so many lives. I, too, think that this gallery (and probably the real horror pix you have and didn't publish here) ought to be made into a book, lest another generation forgets just how unglorious killing really is. Bravo, Richard!i have an adopted p.o.w.who i belive is still out there.i blame the u.s. gov.for all casualties in nam.if we were properly trained instead of a were going to kick ass mentallity we would have not lost all those precious lifes.in these last words i qoute,\n\n\"I cant't promise you that I will bring you all home alive.But this I swear before you and before Almighty God;that when we go into battle, I will be the first to set foot on the field and I will be the last to step off and I will leave no man behind. Dead or alive,we will all come home together. So help me God.\"Lt. Colenal Hal Moore.one last thing before i go.over half the percent of homeless are Nam' veterans.when they came home everyone looked down on them that is no way to treat someone who lost friends and family fighting to get you where you are now.think about that.My father served in VietNam in 1968, I believe. His name was Gary Hanley and I am trying to find out all I can about him and his time served over thre. I am not even sure where he was. He was an infantry man, fixed tanks is all I really know. I have a pin of his which is a purple shield with a gold unicorn on it. He had a volitile relationship with my mother, he died of what I beleive to be \"agent orange side effects\" at the very young age of 36. My mom doesnt talk about him, and I am not even sure if she actually got to know who he beacame after the war. He was from Jamestown, New York. If any one knows anything I would be so very grateful!"
