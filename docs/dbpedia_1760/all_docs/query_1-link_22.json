The Sea Stallion was originally developed in response to a request from the United States Navy's Bureau of Naval Weapons made in March 1962 for a replacement for the Sikorsky CH-37 Mojave helicopters flown by the United States Marine Corps (USMC).\n\nIn July 1962, Sikorsky's proposal, which was essentially a scaled-up S-61R fitted with twin General Electric T64 turboshaft engines and the dynamic system of the S-64/CH-54, was selected. On 14 October 1964, the YCH-53A performed its maiden flight; the first deliveries of production CH-53s to operational units commenced on 12 September 1966. The first combat use of the type occurred during the following year when it was deployed to the Vietnamese theater; the CH-53 quickly proved its value for moving heavy payloads, particularly in the recovery of damaged aircraft.\n\nSeveral variants of the type were promptly introduced. The United States Air Force introduced the HH-53 \"Super Jolly Green Giant\", configured for special operations and combat search and rescue (CSAR) missions, during the latter part of the Vietnam War; the majority of these were subsequently rebuilt into the MH-53 Pave Low. The visually similar CH-53E Super Stallion is a heavier-lifting improved version of the rotorcraft, designated S-80E by Sikorsky; its third engine makes it more powerful than the Sea Stallion and thus displaced it for the heavy-lift mission. Furthermore, many early-build CH-53s were refitted with more powerful engines, while others were reconfigured for different mission roles, such as US presidential flights, training, and airborne mine countermeasures (AMCM) operations.\n\nSeveral export deals for the CH-53 were made, leading to several international operators of the type. Among these are Germany, Iran, and Israel. Several unusual or high-profile operations have been undertaken, such as the capture and transportation of a Soviet advanced radar system to Israel under Operation Rooster 53 in 1969, and Iran's capture of five American CH-53s as a result of Operation Eagle Claw in 1980. Various operators deployed their CH-53s during international missions, often under the auspices of NATO or the United Nations, such as for UNSCOM in Iraq, in Kosovo with KFOR, IFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the ISAF in Afghanistan. While several operators have opted to retain the type into the twenty-first century, many others have opted to supplement or withdraw their Sea Stallions in favor of other platforms, sometimes with the more powerful CH-53E. The CH-53 remains in service with German and Israeli forces, and is one of the largest military helicopters in service. Germany is planning to replace its fleet as of the 2020s, with the latest version of the twin-rotor CH-47 Chinook. The latest version of the CH-53, the K model King Stallion is in production as of the 2020s entering service with the United States Marine Corps; this is replacing the Super Stallion, itself an upgraded version of Sea Stallion. The heavily upgraded Jolly Green Giant and Pave Low versions of the CH-53 were retired by 2008, flown by the U.S. Air Force for combat search and rescue. Overall, the CH-53 was replaced in many roles by the V-22 tilt rotor in U.S. service.\n\nDevelopment\n\n[edit]\n\nOrigins\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1960, the United States Marine Corps (USMC) began to seek a replacement for their HR2S piston-powered helicopters. On 27 January 1961, the USMC began working with the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force on the \"Tri-Service VTOL transport\", which would eventually emerge as the LTV XC-142 tiltwing.[2] The design became more elaborate and the program stretched out, causing the USMC to drop out when they decided they would not receive a working machine in a satisfactory timeframe. In particular, there were concerns that the high levels of downwash produced by the XC-142A would render shipborne operations impractical.[2] In the end, the XC-142A, although a very innovative and capable machine, never entered production.[3]\n\nIn March 1962, the United States Navy's Bureau of Naval Weapons, acting on behalf of the USMC, issued a request for a \"Heavy Helicopter Experimental / HH(X)\".[2] The specifications dictated a load capability of 8,000 pounds (3,600 kg) with an operational radius of 100 nautical miles (190 km; 120 mi) at a speed of 150 knots (280 km/h; 170 mph). It was also specified to possess a higher top speed and greater lifting capacity than existing helicopters while also having a lower empty weight than preceding designs as well.[4] The HH(X) was to be used in the assault transport, aircraft recovery, personnel transport, and medical evacuation roles.[2] In the assault transport role, it was to be mostly used to haul heavy equipment instead of troops.[3]\n\nIn response, Boeing Vertol offered a modified version of the CH-47 Chinook; Kaman Aircraft offered a development of the British Fairey Rotodyne compound helicopter; and Sikorsky offered what amounted to a scaled-up version of the S-61R, with twin General Electric T64 turboshaft engines and the dynamic system of the S-64/CH-54, to be designated the S-65.[2] Kaman's proposal quickly died when the British government dropped its backing of the Rotodyne program. Competition between Boeing Vertol and Sikorsky was intense, with the Chinook having an advantage because it was being acquired by the United States Army.[3] During July 1962, it was announced that Sikorsky's bid had been selected as the winner on account of various considerations, including cost, technical factors, and production capability. However, a contract was not immediately forthcoming due to budgetary limitations.[2]\n\nThe USMC had originally sought to procure four prototypes.[2] However, in light of funding shortfalls, Sikorsky, determined to keep the deal, reduced their estimate for the program's development costs by proposing that development could be performed with only two prototypes. Military officials favourably received the company's proposed reduction; in September 1962, Sikorsky was awarded a $9,965,635 (~$76.9 million in 2023) contract for the production of a pair of YCH-53A prototypes, as well as a mockup and a ground-test airframe.[2]\n\nThe development program did not go entirely smoothly, due to a shortage of engineering resources plus various failures of subcontractors and the government, but these problems were gradually overcome. There was also pressure against the program from U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, who promoted the concept of \"commonality\" between the armed services by adopting the Chinook instead. However, the USMC managed to convince McNamara's staff that the Chinook could not meet their requirements without numerous expensive changes.[3]\n\nThe first YCH-53A performed its initial flight at the Sikorsky plant in Stratford, Connecticut, on 14 October 1964, about four months behind schedule.[2] During the previous month, the USMC had already placed an initial production contract for 16 helicopters. Flight trials went more smoothly than expected, helping make up for the time lost in development; on 19 November 1964, the type was formally introduced to the general public.[2] Around this time, it received the military designation and name CH-53A Sea Stallion. On 12 September 1966, the first deliveries of the CH-53 to an operational unit occurred.[5][2]\n\nFurther development\n\n[edit]\n\nThe CH-53A arrived in Vietnam in January 1967 and proved useful, eventually recovering even more downed aircraft than the CH-54. A total of 141 CH-53As were built, including the two prototypes.[3] The U.S. Navy acquired 15 CH-53As from the USMC in 1971 for airborne mine countermeasures (AMCM) activities. The helicopters had more powerful T64-GE-413 turboshafts installed and received the designation RH-53A.[3]\n\nThe United States Air Force ordered the HH-53B in September 1966 and it first flew on 15 March 1967. It added a refueling probe, drop fuel tanks and a rescue hoist; it also featured upgraded T64-GE-3 engines. The Air Force used the HH-53B for combat search and rescue (CSAR).[6] HH-53C was an improved CSAR variant with a smaller 450 US gallons (1,700 L) fuel tank in exchange for more armor and better communication systems. The CH-53C was similar except it lacked a refueling probe. It was used by the USAF for more general transport work.[7]\n\nHeavy lifting in tropical climates demanded more power, so the USMC decided to acquire an improved variant, the CH-53D, with uprated engines, originally the T64-GE-412 then later the T64-GE-413. The CH-53D also included an uprated transmission to go with the more powerful engines, and a revised interior to permit a load of 55 troops.[3]\n\nThe initial flight of the CH-53D was on 27 January 1969. The CH-53D served alongside the CH-53A through the rest of the Vietnam War. A VIP transport version designated VH-53D with plush accommodations was used by the USMC for the US presidential flights.[3] The US Navy also acquired CH-53D-based helicopters for minesweeping. These were designated RH-53D and included mine sweeping gear such as a pair of 0.50 BMG (12.7 mm) Browning machine guns for detonating mines. The Navy received 30 RH-53Ds beginning in 1973. After the RH-53Ds were in service, the RH-53As were handed back to the USMC and restored to CH-53A configuration.[3]\n\nDuring the 1980s, Israeli Air Force's CH-53 Yas'ur fleet was upgraded by Israel Aircraft Industries and Elbit Systems. The project – which ended only in 1997 – improved the CH-53 avionics, robustness and extended its life span by at least two decades.\n\nIn 1989, some of the CH-53As being retired by the USMC were passed on to the U.S. Air Force for training, with these helicopters redesignated TH-53As. The TH-53As were stripped of most operational equipment and painted in USAF camouflage colors.[3]\n\nDesign\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion is a heavy lift military transport helicopter. The CH-53A carries a crew of four; pilot, copilot, crew chief, and an aerial observer. It can carry various payloads, including up to 38 fully-equipped troops, 24 litters with medical attendants, an internal cargo load of 8,000 pounds (3,600 kg), or an external load of 13,000 pounds (5,900 kg) on the single-point sling hook.[2] Access to the main cabin is via the large passenger door on the right side of the fuselage behind the cockpit, as well as by a power-operated loading ramp to the rear.[3] This loading ramp was capable of facilitating drive-on loading operations, enabling quicker cargo movements. The CH-53A was designed to have a useful payload capacity, in terms of weight, of almost half of the rotorcraft's empty weight.[4]\n\nIt is provisioned with mechanical flight controls, which are backed by three independent hydraulic systems.[3] As noted by Sikorsky engineer Edward S Carter Junior, the rotorcraft could be equipped to facilitate all-weather operations.[4] It shares a somewhat similar fuselage design, albeit on a substantially larger scale, with the Sikorsky S-61R series. While the Sea Stallion's fuselage is watertight, the helicopter is not intended for amphibious use and its ability to land on water is meant to only be used in emergency situations. To save space, which is normally at a premium on board most naval vessels, both the tail boom and the rotors can be folded while the helicopter is stowed; to reduce the workload involved in this process, an automated folding system was developed by Sikorsky.[4] Both the crew and vital systems are protected by armouring across key areas. All of the fuel was housed within sponsons on either side of the fuselage.[2] The CH-53A was typically equipped with a pair of 7.62×51mm NATO M60 machine guns that point out to each side of the fuselage.[3]\n\nThe CH-53A features a fully-articulated six-bladed main rotor and four-bladed tail rotor.[2] According to Carter, the relatively high speed requirement stipulated by the USMC was the primary factor shaping the dynamic design.[4] While the Sea Stallion's dynamic systems were largely derived from those used on the earlier Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane, substantial reengineering were also involved due to the vastly different operating requirements. Extensive use of titanium was made across its dynamic components, particularly for elements that may have been susceptible to degradation over time due to metal fatigue.[4] Initially, the CH-53 was powered by a pair of General Electric T64-6 turboshaft engines, each of which provided up to 2,850 shaft horsepower (2,130 kW). These engines were located on the upper fuselage. Later engines included the T64-1, capable of generating up to 3,080 shp (2,300 kW), and the T64-16, which was rated for up to 3,485 shp (2,599 kW).[3] The HH-53B model featured T64-3 engines, which produced up to 3,080 shp (2,300 kW).[7]\n\nThe improved CH-53D features uprated engines, initially using the T64-GE-412 that could provide up to 3,695 shp (2,755 kW), then the T64-413 with its further elevated output of 3,925 shp (2,927 kW); these more powerful engines necessitated the use of an uprated transmission. Interior changes included additional seats, which allowed for up to 55 troops to be carried at a time. The CH-53D is generally armed with twin .50 BMG (12.7 mm) M2/XM218 machine guns. During the type's later years of service, it has become commonplace for CH-53Ds to have been retrofitted with various defensive countermeasures; such apparatus has often included an AN/ALE-39 chaff dispenser and an AN/ALQ-157 infrared countermeasure.[3]\n\nLater production CH-53Ds featured a Blade Inspection Method (BIM) scheme to detect cracks in its metal rotors. BIM involved pressurizing the interior of the rotor blades with nitrogen. If a crack is present pressure is lost and a red indicator on the rotor blade tip was tripped. Later, the BIM system was connected to a cockpit display. BIM reduced the need to routinely swap rotor blades.[3]\n\nOperational history\n\n[edit]\n\nUnited States\n\n[edit]\n\nThe CH-53/HH-53 has seen considerable use in warzones and served in various conflict during its service. It was first used in the Vietnam War, often recovering downed aircraft and evacuating personnel. The CH-53D served alongside the CH-53A through the latter portion of the US's presence in Vietnam; both types played a critical role at the end of the conflict, performing evacuations of personnel during Operation Frequent Wind.[8]\n\nU.S. Air Force HH-53 Super Jolly Green Giants were the primary search-and-rescue helicopter in Southeast Asia between 1967 and 1975, inserted the Operation Ivory Coast rescue team into the North Vietnamese prison camp at Son Tay in 1970, and carried the USMC and Air Force Security Forces who attempted to rescue the crew of SS Mayagüez.[9][8][10] Marine-flown Navy Sea Stallions were the rotary-wing element of Operation Eagle Claw, the attempted rescue of American hostages in Iran in 1980 that ended in disaster and embarrassment at \"Desert One\".[12] Marine CH-53s were used in Grenada during Operation Urgent Fury.[13]\n\nThe CH-53 was operated by the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. It is also operated by all three services in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. It was in the Afghan theatre than the final operational missions of the CH-53D fleet were performed during February 2012.[14]\n\nOn 17 September 2007, VMM-263 of the USMC was deployed with ten MV-22B Ospreys, a tiltrotor aircraft.[15] The V-22 has been the primary replacement for the USMC's fleets of CH-53Ds and CH-46E Sea Knights, but not the more powerful CH-53Es; instead, the in-development CH-53K is planned to supplant the Navy and USMC CH-53E fleets.[16][17]\n\nDuring September 2011, HMH-463 replaced its CH-53Ds with CH-53Es. HMH-363 and HMH-362 are to operate D-models until the squadrons are deactivated. Both units are to be reactivated as MV-22 and CH-53K squadrons respectively. Several CH-53D helicopters will be retained for the 3rd Marine Regiment for training.[18][19] HMH-362 retired the last CH-53Ds after its combat deployment in August 2012 and decommissioned in November 2012.[20]\n\nIsrael\n\n[edit]\n\nIn August 1968, an Israeli Air Force (IAF) delegation visited Sikorsky's Connecticut plant while seeking information to select the service's next assault helicopter.[21] The delegation was looking for a helicopter with augmented payload carry capacity, highly maneuverable and robust, that could survive direct hits from different caliber projectiles. They examined Boeing's CH-47 Chinook and Sikorsky's CH-53, it was recognised that the latter was both larger and stronger than any of the IAF's other helicopters, and thus represented a major advancement in terms of capability. Based upon experience gained from the intense combat of the then-recently fought Six-Day War, the delegation opted to favour the CH-53.[21]\n\nOn 2 October 1969, the first S-65C-3 (CH-53D) helicopters were delivered to Israel of an initial order of seven.[2] At the time, the country was engaged in the War of Attrition, and thus the type was quickly dispatched into combat. Receiving the Hebrew name Yas'ur (Petrel), a further 35 helicopter were delivered to fulfil subsequent orders.[2] On 6 August 1970, the first Yas'ur squadron was established. For several decades, the type has served as the primary cargo helicopters of the IAF, being routinely used to carry both troops and heavy equipment.\n\nIn 1969, during the War of Attrition, IAF CH-53s landed in Egypt and conveyed a captured Soviet advanced radar system back to Israel for examination by Israeli scientists and engineers (see Operation Rooster 53).[22] The Yas'ur was also used in various other capacities during the conflict, including the retrieval of a navigator from a downed IAF F-4 Phantom II under sustained enemy fire on 30 June 1970.[21]\n\nDuring the 1973 Yom Kippur War, the Yas'ur routinely moved artillery batteries and for the insertion of IDF units around the fronts. The type was also used to evacuate hundreds of wounded soldiers and rescued pilots from behind enemy lines in both Egypt and Syria.[21] In one engagement, a single Yas'ur was attacked by multiple aircraft, including a pair of MiG-21s; while sustaining damage, it was still able to return to base. Since 1973, Yas'urs have also been used by the IDF to land and extract Sayeret commandos on raids and patrols deep behind enemy lines in Lebanon Syria and the greater Middle East.[21]\n\nDuring the 1980s, Israel Aircraft Industries, along with Elbit Systems, commenced a major upgrade program for the IAF Yas'ur fleet. The project, which was completed in 1997, improved the CH-53's avionics and increased its robustness, as well as extending the fleet's operating life by at least two decades.\n\nIn 1989, several Yas'urs were used to perform firefighting operations on and around Mount Carmel. They performed dozens of low flyovers into the smoke and flames, dumped 700 tons of water on the fire, and doused it. On 8 November 1992, a pair of CH-53s performed one of the IAF's longest-distance sea rescue operations to retrieve passenger from the distressed yacht Fantasy 2 off the coast of Sudan.[21]\n\nDuring the 2006 Lebanon War, Hezbollah shot down an Israeli CH-53 Yas'ur with an anti-tank missile, killing five air crew members.[23][24] This was reportedly the only combat loss of an Israeli CH-53 during this conflict.[25][26]\n\nOn 16 August 2012, the IAF temporarily grounded its CH-53 fleet following one having experienced in-flight difficulties that led to an emergency landing; initial reports state the issue was related to the rotor blades.[27] The fleet was again grounded for three weeks after a CH-53 was destroyed by a fire during a training exercise; the IAF subsequently attributed this loss to a defective component and blamed Lockheed Martin for failing to communicate the issue.[28]\n\nDuring 2015, it was announced that Israel planned to withdraw the last of its Yasurs around 2025.[29] Replacement options studied included the CH-53K and the CH-47F Chinook, with a prospective order for approximately 20 helicopters being placed for the preferred option.[30] During February 2021, the Israeli Ministry of Defense announced the selection of the CH-53K to replace the Yasur fleet.[31][32]\n\nOn 7 October 2023, during the first day of the Israel-Hamas war, and the first time after 17 years since the 2006 Lebanon War in a similar incident, Hamas shot down an IAF CH-53 with an anti-tank rocket and hitting its left engine, while carrying about 50 paratroopers (a very unusual procedure, as opposed to the approved IAF's max capacity of 33 troops).[33] The pilot managed to land safely in an open field, offloading both the aircrew and the paratroopers. The CH-53 was then hit by a second anti-tank rocket, completely destroying the helicopter. The occupants survived the attack with minor to medium injuries.[34][35]\n\nIran\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the 1970s, an initial fleet of six RH-53D Sea Stallions was delivered to the Imperial Iranian Navy (IIN). Following the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the Sea Stallions continued in service with the renamed Islamic Republic of Iran Navy (IRIN).[5] These were supplemented by five U.S. Navy examples that were abandoned during Operation Eagle Claw in 1980.[36] Despite US sanctions that have blocked the nation from acquiring spares and support from overseas, Iran has reportedly been able to keep at least a portion of their Sea Stallions in an operational condition; this effort has been aided by illegal exports of controlled parts to Iran by US citizens.[37][38]\n\nGermany\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1966, the German military evaluated both the CH-53 and CH-47 as a replacement for the H-21 and H-34G helicopters with an initial requirement for 133.[39] The purchase of the CH-53 was approved in June 1968 but due to budget constraints only 110 were ordered.[39] Following the delivery in 1969 of two pre-production helicopters from Sikorsky the production aircraft were licence built by VFW-Fokker at Speyer in Germany.[39] The first German-built CH-53G Mittlerer Transporthubschrauber helicopter flew from Speyer on 11 October 1971 and was delivered to the Erprobungsstelle der Bundeswehr 61 flight test center at Manching on 1 December 1971.[39]\n\nThe German Army Aviation Corps received 110 type CH-53Gs, derivatives of the CH-53D, between 1971 and 1975. 108 helicopters were built in Germany by VFW-Fokker. The first flight by a German CH-53G was made in 1971, followed in March 1973 by the delivery of the first machines to Heeresfliegerregiment (HFlgRgt, Army Aviation Corps Regiment) 35 in Mendig, and shortly afterwards to the newly formed Army Aviation Corps Regiment 15 based at Rheine and Army Aviation Corps Regiment 25 based at Laupheim.[citation needed]\n\nIn order to meet ever more demanding specifications, over time the CH-53G received modifications from 1990 designed to improve its service life and operational capabilities. These involved three major upgrades: new missile warning and self-protection systems; provision for two external fuel tanks allowing range to be increased to 1,100 mi (1,800 km) when carrying 36 armed soldiers or a 12,100 lb (5,500 kg) payload; and addition of a night vision goggles-compatible cockpit for night low-level flying capabilities. All CH-53Gs were upgraded by Eurocopter Germany by early 2001, resulting in updated GS/GE/GA variants. As a result of foreign military operations 20 CH-53G helicopters were converted to perform Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) missions. Version CH-53GS is equipped with modernized IFR equipment, additional exterior fuel tanks, low-flight night vision cockpit and NVG, partial ballistic protection, engine dust collectors, missile counter measure and self-defence armament. Additionally the original engines were replaced by the more powerful T64-100 engines.[citation needed]\n\nGerman Army Aviation Corps units have carried out a wide range of international missions under the auspices of NATO and the UN, providing transport for members of UNSCOM in Iraq, serving in Kosovo with KFOR, with IFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and more recently with ISAF in Afghanistan.[citation needed] On 1 January 2013, all Army Aviation Corps CH-53Gs were transferred to the German Air Force and incorporated into Helicopter Wing 64.[40]\n\nDuring the 2010s, Germany was reportedly considering options for replacing its aging CH-53G fleet, with candidates including the Chinook and the CH-53K model. On 29 September 2020, the German Ministry of Defense cancelled the \"Schwerer Transporthubschrauber\" (STH) heavy-lifting helicopter program for 45 to 60 helicopters after the initiative was judged to be too expensive and stated that its CH-53Gs fleet would be replaced following a period of reexamination.[41][42] In 2022, the Federal Government announced that all of Germany's CH-53s would be replaced by 60 CH-47Fs.[43]\n\nAustria\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring 1970, a pair of S-65C-2 or S-65Ö (equivalent to the CH-53D standard, albeit without the aerial refuelling probe) helicopters were delivered to Austria. Intended primarily to perform airborne rescue operations in the Alps, they were assigned to 1st Helicopter Wing of the Austrian Air Force, making the service the second foreign operator of the CH-53.[2] Their equipment included same rescue hoist as the HH-53 and fittings for auxiliary fuel tanks and accommodation for 38 passengers. Although they performed well in high altitude operations, the type's relatively high operating costs were a major contributing factor in Austria's decision to sell both rotorcraft to Israel in 1981.[2] However, since the 1999 Galtür avalanche, in which over 7000 thousand people had transported by international collaboration of helicopter resources from Austria, USA, German, France, and Switzerland including 50 helicopters, more helicopter resources have been pursued.[44]\n\nMexico\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring 2003, the Fuerza Aérea Mexicana (FAM) acquired four surplus CH-53D Sea Stallions from Israel at a combined cost of $25 million (~$39.7 million in 2023).[45][46] Prior to their delivery in 2005, all helicopters were upgraded to the Yasur 2000 standard. Due to restricted budgets, only two were actually operated by 104th Air Squadron, while the other pair served as a source of spare parts. Their initial missions were troop transport and commando insertion, but their principal mission was subsequently changed to performing rescue and disaster relief operations, being relocated to BAM 8 at Yucatán. By 2013, all examples had been permanently withdrawn from service.[47]\n\nCivil use\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring 2007, the first commercially owned CH-53D was being converted by the Californian company Heavy Lift Helicopters into a firefighting configuration, which was referred to by the firm as the Fire Stallion Having acquired a batch of six ex-military CH-53Ds, the company planned to make them available for hire by other operators; in addition to fire-fighting, construction work and general transport duties were envisioned for the fleet.[48] While the fleet reportedly flew for a handful of years, they entered storage after only a short period of use due to component shortages.[49]\n\nVariants\n\n[edit]\n\nThis article is about CH-53A, D, G, and related variants.

The internal Sikorsky designation was S-65C-1.[51] A total of 112 were produced including 2 pre-production and 20 assembled by VFW-Fokker and 90 built by Speyer.[52] As of 2007 , 89 German CH-53s were in service, with 80 planned to be in service in 2014. All German CH-53s are going to receive T64-100 engines (in 3 batches; first batch has already been installed, second batch is currently being installed and 3rd batch is planned with funding made available). All will receive IFR-capability.[53]\n\nCH-53GS\n\nUpdate of 20 CH-53Gs in the late 1990s, with additional missile counter measure, upgraded communication and navigation system and two external fuel tanks added.[52] They later received the first batch of T64-100 engines to operate in hot and high conditions that prevail in Afghanistan. MG3 and M3M machine guns were also fitted.[54] A CH-53GS/GE update has also been ordered to provide combat search-and-rescue (CSAR) capability to 26 helicopters.[55][56][57]\n\nCH-53GE\n\nA configuration based on CH-53GS combat search-and-rescue (CSAR) capabilities.[55] The upgrade configuration was formerly known as CH-53GSX.[citation needed] It further updates with modern electronics, two external fuel tanks, counter measures and dust filters for the engines. Upgrade was ordered to support Afghanistan deployment.[54]\n\nCH-53GA\n\nUpdate of further 40 CH-53Gs with new flight deck, new flight control system, autopilot, navigation and communication systems, FLIR, ECM and missile counter measures as well as provisions for additional internal fuel tanks.
