        "text": "Child deaths\n\nDeaths in early childhood have reduced substantially over the past 100 years. In 1907, child deaths (aged 0–4 years) accounted for 26% of all deaths compared to 0.6% in 2022.\n\nChild death rates presented here are calculated as the number of deaths among young children (aged 0–4) divided by the population of the same age and expressed per 100,000 population.\n\nIn 2022, there were 75 child deaths per 100,000 population – 8.4% lower than a decade earlier (2012) and 97% lower than in 1907 when recording began (Figure 2.2). The death rate in 2022 was higher for boys than girls (78 and 73 deaths per 100,000 population respectively).\n\nThe drop in child deaths in Australia mostly reflects a decline in infant deaths (aged less than 1), which is linked to:\n\nimproved access to and quality of neonatal health care\n\nincreased community awareness of risk factors for infant and child deaths\n\nimproved sanitation and hygiene\n\nreductions in vaccine-preventable diseases through universal immunisation programs.\n\nSource: AIHW National Mortality Database; Table S2.2.\n\nOther measures of deaths in early childhood and infancy are also commonly used to describe the health status of a population:\n\nInfant mortality rate is defined as the number of deaths of infants (aged less than 1) divided by the number of live births (and usually expressed per 1,000 live births). For more information on infant deaths, see Australia's children.\n\nPerinatal deaths are deaths of babies who die before birth (stillbirth or fetal death) or within the first 28 days of life (neonatal deaths). For more information on perinatal deaths, see Mothers and babies.\n\nUnder-five death rates are defined as the number of child (aged 0–4) deaths divided by the number of live births, expressed per 1,000 live births. For more information on under-five deaths, see World Health Organization.\n\nPotentially avoidable deaths\n\nPotentially avoidable deaths are deaths among people younger than 75 that are potentially avoidable within the present health care system. They include deaths from conditions that are potentially preventable through individualised care and/or treatable through existing primary or hospital care.\n\nIn 2022, there were 28,509 potentially avoidable deaths accounting for almost half (47%) of all deaths for people aged less than 75. Of these deaths, 63% were male and 37% were female.\n\nPotentially avoidable age-standardised death rates fell by 36% between 2002 and 2022 (Figure 2.3).\n\nSource: AIHW National Mortality Database; Table S2.3.\n\nPotentially avoidable deaths are classified using nationally agreed definitions based on cause of death for people aged less than 75. Historical data may differ from previous reports as the nationally agreed definition of potentially avoidable deaths in 2022 has been applied.\n\nData on potentially avoidable deaths by small geographical areas are available as an indicator within the Australia's health performance framework and the AIHW Mortality Over Regions and Time (MORT) books.\n\nPotential years of life lost\n\nPremature deaths can be summarised in terms of potential years of life lost (PYLLs). This measure considers only deaths that occur before a specified arbitrary age. For example, if dying before the age of 75 is considered premature then a person dying at age 40 would have lost 35 potential years of life.\n\nUsing the age of 75 as the cut-off, there were 944,509 PYLLs in Australia in 2022. There was a 90% decline in the number of PYLLS per 1,000 population between 1907 and 2022 (from 382 to 39 PYLLs per 1,000).\n\nMales are more likely than females to experience premature death, however, the difference between the sexes is narrowing (Figure 2.4).\n\nIn 1980, there were 109 PYLLs per 1,000 males and 58 PYLLs per 1,000 females; a difference of 51 PYLL per 1,000.\n\nIn 2022, the difference reduced to 19 PYLL per 1,000 (49 PYLLs per 1,000 males and 30 PYLLs per 1,000 females).\n\nSource: AIHW National Mortality Database; Table S2.4.\n\nPYLLs can be used to estimate the burden of mortality, which is the loss associated with early death. On this basis it is sometimes used as an indicator of the social and economic impact of premature deaths. Burden of disease measures include a component of years of life lost that is weighted according to the remaining life expectancy at the age of death, rather than using the age of 75 as the cut-off.\n\nFor more information, see Burden of disease."
