        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nChildren and adolescents worldwide are significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Abrupt changes to routine, including removal from in-person schooling and changes in social and community engagement are associated with worsening mental health in children and adolescents, (de Figueiredo, Sandre, & Portugal, 2021) including elevated anxiety, fear of contagion, frustration, boredom, reduced physical activity, and difficulties with sleep and concentration (Roccella, 2020, Wang et al., 2020). One study with a sample of 583 adolescents reported moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression (55%), anxiety (48%), and posttraumatic stress (45%); 38% reported suicidal ideation and 69% reported sleep problems (Murata, Rezeppa, & Thoma, 2020).\n\nThe impact of the pandemic is most notable with pre- and post-pandemic start comparisons. For example, a greater number of adolescents reported poor quality of life (40.2%) and elevated levels of anxiety (24.1%) during the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic control cohort group (15.3% and 14.9%, respectively) (Ravens-Sieberer et al., 2021). Another study of adolescents found significant increases in self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms and a decrease in life satisfaction between 2019 and May of 2020 (Magson et al., 2021). A separate study using established cut-offs of a validated measure of anxiety symptoms found that 18.2% of adolescents endorsed elevated panic or somatic symptoms, 40.4% endorsed elevated generalized anxiety symptoms, and 29.5% reported elevated social anxiety symptoms (Hawes, Szenczy, Klein, Hajcak, & Nelson, 2021). A sample of 407 adolescents (ages 14–17 years) surveyed both prior to and during the pandemic also reported increases in negative affect, decreases in positive affect, elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety, and increased loneliness (Rogers, Ha, & Ockey, 2021). Importantly, these studies largely utilized existing measures of psychological distress developed before the pandemic, and did not assess the specific psychological and emotional impact of COVID-19 on resultant youth behaviors, particularly in relation to their adherence to mitigation strategies.\n\nThere have been a number of efforts to address this gap and to best understand the impact of the pandemic on the lives of individuals worldwide. Researchers across the globe have developed numerous COVID-19-related measures (19 at the time of writing). These measures can be classified into three categories: (1) symptom-specific measures (e.g., the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, 9 FCV-19S), (2) measures designed to capture a comprehensive representation of the impact associated with COVID-19 (e.g., COVID Stress Scales10), and measures of specific domains (e.g., the Pandemic [COVID-19] Anxiety Travel Scale, PATS11). Notably, all of these measures were developed to capture the emotional functioning of adults and few target both COVID-19-specific anxiety and related behaviors.\n\nOf the published measures, only one has been tested in children and adolescents–the FCV-19S, a 7-item unidimensional measure of symptoms of anxiety provoked by COVID-19 (Ahorsu et al., 2020). However, this measure was not developed specifically for use with children and has only been tested with children in three studies; only two of which examined the factor structure: one found a unidimensional structure for the Mandarin translation and another found a bifactor structure for the Japanese translation (Chi et al., 2021a, Chi et al., 2021b, Masuyama et al., 2020, Sakib et al., 2020). Although all of these COVID-19-related measures greatly contribute to the ability to measure novel stressors brought on by the worldwide pandemic, none were developed with the purpose of measuring these in children. Thus, the purpose of this study was to describe the development and initial validation of the caregiver-report version of the Fear of Illness and Virus Evaluation (FIVE) scales, which is being used widely during the pandemic to measure COVID-19 anxiety and related avoidance and mitigation behaviors in children and adolescents.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nAlthough a number of measures have been developed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on individuals and families, (Ahorsu et al., 2020, Chi et al., 2021a, Chi et al., 2021b, Masuyama et al., 2020, Sakib et al., 2020, Taylor et al., 2020a, Zenker et al., 2021) the present study examining the FIVE caregiver-report offers the first empirical evaluation of such a measure specifically designed for youth populations. Results indicated that a hierarchical five-factor model, created after removing four problematic items and adding a higher-order Total Fears factor, provided the best fit for the data. These results were replicated with the M6 timepoint. Notably, the behaviors measured by the three items on the Adaptive Behaviors subscale (i.e., child uses social media/FaceTime to stay connected to friends; child exercises or plays outside; child does schoolwork on a computer) were endorsed by the majority of respondents regardless of their responses on other items or scales. For example, 73% of caregivers reported their child did schoolwork on a computer most or all of the time. Therefore, these items did not provide meaningful information in relation to COVID-19-related fears and worries, but instead reflected behaviors that were likely already common prior to the pandemic. Thus, the final model consisted of two subscales measuring fears (i.e., Contamination and Illness Fears, Social Distancing Fears), two behavior subscales (i.e., Avoidance Behaviors, Mitigation Behaviors), and a higher-order Total Fears factor consisting of the two fear subscales. Measurement invariance was supported across country of residence, child age, and child sex. All FIVE subscales demonstrated strong internal consistency. Results of the multitrait-item analysis indicated acceptable assignment of items to their intended subscales, supported the removal of four items dropped from the best fitting model, and revealed appropriate item-scale discrimination.\n\nResearch conducted since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic indicates widespread psychological impacts on the general population, including increased elevations in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and overall psychological distress (de Figueiredo et al., 2021, Hawes et al., 2021, Magson et al., 2021, Murata et al., 2020, Ravens-Sieberer et al., 2021, Roccella, 2020, Rogers et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2020). Although numerous COVID-19-specific measures have been developed and validated, the FIVE caregiver-report measure was specifically designed for use with children and adolescents. The FIVE caregiver-report appears to be a structurally valid and reliable measure that can be used to capture child contamination and illness fears related to COVID-19, child fears associated with the impact of social distancing restrictions, while measuring associated behaviors in response to these fears. The FIVE differs from other measures of anxiety developed for COVID-19, most of which include items that measure general symptoms of anxiety and are not specific to COVID-19, in its inclusion of items specific to the pandemic (e.g., fears related to social isolation, financial impact, adequate access to supplies). Additionally, the fears and worries captured by the FIVE are not limited to the impact of COVID-19 on the individual, but also measures health or illness-related anxiety as it relates to the pandemic’s impact on loved ones and the larger society.\n\nThe FIVE has demonstrated its utility in its different versions and across different languages. Research teams across the world have translated the FIVE scales (caregiver-report, child-report, and adult versions) and tested them in several populations either in its original hypothesized structure or by analyzing the factor structure. The Arabic FIVE adult-version was tested with 509 adults in Saudi Arabia and reported strong internal consistency based on Cronbach’s α (C&I Fears α = 0.89; SD Fears α = 0.91) (Tounsi, Alammar, & Almaflehi, 2021). However, results of their factor analyses found an alternate factor structure that divided C&I Fears into two subscales: “Fears of Getting Sick” and “Fears that Others Get Sick,” while keeping the SD Fears subscale together, and testing the Behavior items separately (Tounsi et al., 2021).\n\nThe Spanish-language FIVE adult-version, tested with 163 adults, (Cottin, Hernández, & Núñez, 2021) also divided the C&I Fears into two subscales: Fears of Getting Sick (α = 0.88) and Fears that Others May Get Sick (α = 0.74). Additionally, SD Fears were also divided into two subscales: Fears of Concrete Limitation (α = 0.85), and Fears of not being able to meet Basic Needs (α = 0.79). The Behavior items (α = 0.87) and Impact items (α = 0.84) were kept separate as supplemental items (not included as part of the four-factor structure). The four fears scales were all found to significantly predict symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress (Cottin et al., 2021). The Turkish translation of the FIVE adult-version was tested in its original hypothesized factor structure and found to strongly correlate with symptoms of anxiety (r = 0.83) and moderately correlate with depressive symptoms (r = 0.66) (Çölkesen, Kilincel, & Sozen, 2021).\n\nA study of adolescents using the FIVE child-report version did not test the factor structure but provided internal consistency using Cronbach’s α for some of the subscales: SD Fears α = 0.86; 7-item C&I Fears subscale α = 0.84, 9-item Behaviors α = 0.84 (Trucco, Fallah-Sohy, & Hartmann, 2022). This study reported that SD Fears was mildly correlated with measures of stress and anxiety symptoms (Trucco et al., 2022). A separate study of 31 adolescents used the self-report C&I Fears (α = 0.78) and the Behaviors subscales (α = 0.70) and found that greater C&I Fears predicted lower daily physical activity; while greater engagement in behaviors predicted greater daily physical activity (Cummings, Humiston, Cohen, & Lansing, 2021). Another study using the FIVE child-report version adapted the self-report version for 7–10 year old students by adding visuals, kept the original hypothesized factor structure, but did not provide information on the psychometric properties (Bhogal, Borg, Jovanovic, & Marusak, 2021).\n\nIn addition to its utility for research related to COVID-19, the FIVE was designed to be useful in future public health crises, particularly as it refers generically to a “bad virus or illness” and would not require alteration to item content. Another strength of this measure and validation study is the use of feedback from experts to enhance face validity and the assessment of the interpretability of items using two different estimates of their reading level. The FIVE's utility as a clinical measure or one that has incremental validity in comparison to existent measures of youth anxiety and avoidance behaviors will be an important target for further investigation.\n\nFear and anxiety are associated with compliance to health behaviors (Cameron et al., 2015). Specifically, the likelihood that someone will engage in a specific health behavior (e.g., handwashing) can be influenced by the individual’s level of fear or anxiety related to the predicted negative outcome (e.g., getting sick). If the level of fear is very low, it may lead to less motivation to engage in health behaviors, while very high levels of fear may result in avoidant behaviors (Asmundson and Taylor, 2020aaa, Asmundson and Taylor, 2020bbb, Cameron et al., 2015). Thus, the inclusion of avoidance and mitigation behaviors in this measure may provide helpful information for the development of public health strategies to both promote mental health and to increase adherence to mitigation strategies and increase uptake of vaccinations (Asmundson and Taylor, 2020bbb, Harper et al., 2020, Taylor et al., 2020b).\n\nThis study does have some limitations. First, the study was conducted towards the beginning of the pandemic and does not capture the potential long-term impact of this type of stressor or the effect of pandemic fatigue on fears and behaviors. Long-term follow-up data will add to the robustness of our knowledge about the measure’s predictive validity and the course of COVID-19 fears and behaviors in youth over time. Moreover, the generalizability of the present sample can be called into question, and, thus, future psychometric work will be needed in more representative samples to further validate the measure.\n\nThe FIVE itself also has some limitations. For example, the behavior subscales measure the frequency of the reported behavior and do not directly assess their impact or whether the behavior may be an adaptive or helpful response. Additionally, certain behaviors may be adaptive only up to a particular level or frequency, which is not addressed by this measure. As a measure of child fears and behaviors, it is also important to acknowledge that some of the behaviors may not be completely up to the child and may be dependent on the caregiver’s choices; thus, the association between the child’s fears and such behaviors may be indicative of a caregiver’s own fears and anxiety, more than that of the child.\n\nAlthough prior research indicates that caregiver-report of child symptoms are reliable and and helpful, (Lifland et al., 2018, Poulain et al., 2020) the evidence on parent/caregiver-child agreement for anxiety symptoms has been mixed. Notably, higher agreement between parent and child reports of child anxiety symptoms have been found when measuring observable symptoms (Comer & Kendall, 2004). Therefore, future steps should include the evaluation of the caregiver-version of the measure in combination with the child self-report measure. However, child-report data from the FIVE has been relatively slower to aggregate, making direct comparisons inaccessible at the present time. Future studies should also include measures of pandemic fatigue and related factors that were not yet identified at the beginning of the pandemic, when data was initially collected for this study. Pandemic fatigue is associated with a decrease in compliance with public health policies and mitigation strategies to contain the spread of COVID-19 (Lilleholt, Zettler, Betsch, & Böhm, 2021). Therefore, future studies are needed to use the FIVE to explore relationships between COVID-19-related fears and anxiety, related behaviors, and pandemic fatigue in youth.\n\nDespite limitations, results of this study provide support for the face and content validity, structural validity, and internal consistency of the FIVE caregiver-report. All FIVE items included in the final subscales demonstrated appropriate item-total correlations with their assigned subscales, as well as appropriate item-scale discrimination. All subscales had satisfactory internal consistency. Therefore, the FIVE caregiver-report offers a rare, psychometrically robust and useful tool that was specifically developed to assess the fears, worries, and associated behaviors of children and adolescents in the context of a pandemic."
