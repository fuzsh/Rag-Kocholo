Kennedy was the third longest serving Member of the U.S. Senate in American history. Voters of Massachusetts elected him to the Senate nine times--a record matched by only one other Senator. The scholar Thomas Mann said his time in the Senate was ``an amazing and endurable presence. You want to go back to the 19th century to find parallels, but you won't find parallels.'' President Obama has described his breathtaking span of accomplishment: ``For five decades, virtually every major piece of legislation to advance the civil rights, health, and economic well-being of the American people bore his name and resulted from his efforts.'' Senator Kennedy fought for and won so many great battles--on voting rights, education, immigration reform, the minimum wage, national service, the Nation's first major legislation to combat AIDS, and equality for minorities, women, the disabled, and gay and lesbian Americans. He called health care ``the cause of my life,'' and succeeded in bringing quality and affordable health care to countless Americans, including children, seniors, and those with disabilities. Until the end he was working tirelessly to achieve historic national health reform. He was an opponent of the Vietnam war and an early champion of the war's refugees. He was a powerful yet lonely voice from the beginning against the invasion of Iraq. He stood for human rights abroad--from Chile to the former Soviet Union--and was a leader in the cause of poverty relief for the poorest nations of Africa and the world. He believed in a strong national defense and he also unceasingly pursued and advanced the work of nuclear arms control. He was the conscience of his party, and also the Senate's greatest master of forging compromise with the other party. Known as the lion of the Senate, Senator Kennedy was widely respected on both sides of the aisle for his commitment to progress and his ability to legislate. Senator Kennedy was chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Previously he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and served on that committee for many years. He also served on the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Congressional Joint Economic Committee. He was a leader of the Congressional Friends of Ireland and helped lead the way toward peace on that island. He was a graduate of Harvard University and the University of Virginia Law School. He lived in Hyannis Port, MA, with his wife Vicki. He is survived by her and their five children: Kara; Edward, Jr.; Patrick; Curran; and Caroline; and his sister Jean Kennedy Smith. ? MEMORIAL ADDRESSES AND OTHER TRIBUTES FOR EDWARD M. KENNEDY Proceedings in the Senate Tuesday, September 8, 2009 prayer The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer: O merciful Lord, we thank You for the refreshment and accomplishments of our time away and for Your clear, shining inward light that directs our steps. May the Members of this body feel Your peace and power today. Restrain wandering thoughts and break in pieces those temptations that lead them away from Your will. Lord, join our Senators to Yourself with an inseparable bond of love, for You alone truly satisfy. Grant that their love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, so that they may be able to discern what is best, and may be pure and blameless when they stand before You. Lord, this is the first time in nearly 50 years that the Senate will convene without Senator Edward Kennedy as one of its Members. Thank You for his life and legacy. We pray in Your sovereign name. Amen. Moment of Silence in Honor of the Late Senator Edward M. Kennedy Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now observe a moment of silence in memory of our friend and departed colleague, the late Senator Edward Kennedy. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. [Moment of silence.] Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have to acknowledge that as I came into the Chamber this afternoon, I came upon Senator Kennedy's desk, which is covered with the traditional black velvet, with the flowers and his favorite poem on the desk. I read the poem and a tear came to my eye. ... Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senate grieves the loss of one of its giants and one of our great friends. All of us were, of course, moved by the many tributes that have poured in since Senator Kennedy's passing. We will make time later in the week for Senators, including myself, to deliver tributes of our own on the Senate floor. Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to speak to the same issue my colleague Senator McCain spoke to in a couple minutes. First I wish to make some brief comments about two of our colleagues who will no longer be with us--of course, our friend and colleague, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Martinez. Let me, first of all, speak to Senator Kennedy's departure from this body due to his untimely death. During his five decades of public service, Senator Kennedy served with diligence, tireless passion, and, of course, vigor--the word that immediately evokes the Kennedy spirit. Because of who he was, he could have gotten by without a lot of hard work. But that was not his way. He believed deeply, so he worked hard--as hard as any Senator I have known. One thing that has been commented on by many who worked with Senator Kennedy was his willingness to compromise. I have characterized Senator Kennedy as a legislator's legislator, often a results-oriented pragmatist, who knew that clashes between the two parties are inevitable and, in fact, an integral part of our political system, and that it was important to reach across the aisle if you wanted to get things done. He believed that people with dramatically different points of view could usually find some common ground. While Senator Kennedy and I did not share a perspective on very many issues, and he was always ready to make an ideological or political point, my colleagues and I appreciated his efforts to actually legislate as well. His dedication, his hard work, humor, and high spirit will always be remembered. My wife Caryll and I extend our thoughts and prayers to his family. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. ... In closing, let me just say this is the first time I have spoken on the Senate floor since our colleague, Senator Kennedy, has left us. His desk is three down from me. I don't know if the camera shows it now, but there is a black drape over it and some flowers and a copy of Robert Frost's ``The Road Less Traveled.'' I know this poem meant a lot to him, and he certainly meant a lot to me as a very gracious mentor with vast experience who could easily have ignored a new colleague. But he took an interest, and I will never forget his kindness to me. We all will miss his booming voice. He could fill this Chamber with his voice. We will miss his rollicking good humor. No one enjoyed life and enjoyed his colleagues more than the senior Senator from Massachusetts. We will miss his masterful legislative skills as we try to work our way through the obstructions the other side will be throwing up against progress on health care reform. His wise voice and counsel will be missed. Finally, we will miss his lion's heart. He knew when the fight was right, he knew when it was worth fighting for, and he was in it to win it. Ted, God bless you. We miss you. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota. Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me follow on the remarks of my colleague from Rhode Island as he discussed briefly at the end of his remarks the loss of our colleague and friend, Senator Ted Kennedy. The desk that is now cloaked in black and adorned with flowers is a desk that was once occupied by Senator John F. Kennedy, then occupied by Senator Robert Kennedy, and for many years occupied by Senator Ted Kennedy. He was an extraordinary friend to all of us, a remarkable legislator. This is not a case of the Senate just losing one Senator. He was such a much larger presence than that in the public life of our country and particularly in the workings of this Congress. My thoughts and prayers have been with Ted Kennedy and his family over these many months as he has battled brain cancer. Now, since his death, we have all reflected on what he meant to us and to this country. Today it seems inappropriate to take the floor of the Senate without at least acknowledging the absence of our friend, Ted Kennedy, and to send our prayers to his family. Mr. President, when Senator Kennedy would come to the floor with a booming voice, full of passion about an issue, it was an extraordinary thing to watch and to listen to. He had that kind of passion. ... Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I rise to bid farewell to Ted Kennedy, a man who spent so many hours on this floor. It was here that he engaged in the cause that shaped his life, and now shapes our memories--his commitment to everyday people in their pursuit of the American dream. It is hard for me, as it is for all my colleagues, to imagine this place without Ted Kennedy. To serve here with him was a great honor. At the age of 14, I was already wearing a Ted Kennedy for President button. Then when I arrived here, this man, this lion of the Senate, was so friendly and funny and generous. He helped to teach me the ropes in the Senate, and I felt so fortunate to know him as a person, not just to admire him from afar. He and his family are one of the reasons I stand here today. His work in the Senate, his brother John's call for a new generation to serve their country, and his brother Bobby's call for social justice--all these inspired me to run for office to in some way serve my country as Senator Kennedy and his family had. One of the greatest honors of my life was winning the Profiles in Courage Award with Senator McCain, and being recognized by members of the Kennedy family for our work on campaign finance reform. Having Senator Kennedy there that day was part of what made that such an honor. There was no one else like him; he was truly one of a kind. Who else could be such a fierce advocate, and at the same time such a skilled negotiator? Who else could engage in such heated debate, but still count so many of us, on both sides of the aisle, as devoted friends? No one but Ted Kennedy could do that. His qualities were legendary--he was the hardest worker, he was the quickest debater, and he was the guy who lit up a room with his warmth and wit. It was all there in one extraordinary man, who became one of the greatest U.S. Senators in our Nation's history. Even putting aside Ted's legendary personal qualities, his legislative record speaks volumes about how effective he was. It is a record for the ages, with hundreds of his legislative efforts becoming law. His achievements in civil rights, education, health care, and workers' rights speak to the absolute commitment he had to the people he saw who struggled to live the American dream; the dedicated people who are the lifeblood of this country, but who struggle--especially in times like these--when they lose their job, or their health insurance, or their home. In Ted Kennedy, those Americans found their champion, and we thank him for everything he achieved on their behalf. I admired so many things Ted Kennedy did, but most of all I was inspired by his work on civil rights. His commitment, through his 47 years in the Senate, to the cause of equality for every American, was perhaps his greatest achievement of all. In his very first speech on the Senate floor, just 4 months after his brother John's assassination, he called for the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He played a key role in the Voting Rights Act of 1965, was the chief sponsor of the Voting Rights Amendments Act of 1982, and just a few years ago was a key co-sponsor of the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006. He was one of the chief co- sponsors of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the chief sponsor of the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1988, and a key proponent of the Civil Rights Act of 1991. And the list goes on, Mr. President. There simply is no doubt that he was the most important legislative architect of the expansion of civil rights in the last half century. I am committed to helping to continue that work here in the Senate in his memory. Ted was also someone who suffered many personal tragedies, but he bore those burdens with a quiet dignity that came from his tremendous inner strength. You couldn't know him without being awed by that strength, and sensing it whenever he entered the room, or when he took up an issue. When he spoke, his words echoed not just in this Chamber, but across the country and around the world. This was a man who could change the momentum on a bill or an issue just through his own personal will. He was a powerful person determined to help the powerless in our society, and we loved him for it. I think ``beloved'' is the best word to describe how we felt about him here in the Senate, and how so many Americans felt about him around the country. We are grateful that he lived to achieve so much, and to inspire so many. And now we wish, as he did when he laid his brother Robert Kennedy to rest, that ``what he wished for others will someday come to pass for all the world.'' And now we pledge, as he did at the Democratic Convention in 1980, that ``the work goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives and the dream shall never die.'' And now, as we grieve his loss, we say goodbye to our friend, Senator Edward M. Kennedy. We thank him for his lifetime of service to our country, and for his profound commitment to the cause of justice here in the United States and throughout the world.

Res. 255 Whereas the Honorable Edward Moore Kennedy was elected to the Senate in 1962 and served the people of Massachusetts in the United States Senate with devotion and distinction for nearly 47 years, the third longest term of service in Senate history; Whereas the Honorable Edward Moore Kennedy became the youngest Majority Whip in Senate history at the age of 36; Whereas the Honorable Edward Moore Kennedy served as Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1979-1981 and as Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee for nearly 13 years between 1987-2009; Whereas the Honorable Edward Moore Kennedy made the needs of working families and the less fortunate among us the work of his life, particularly those of the poor, the disenfranchised, the disabled, the young, the old, the working class, the servicemember and the immigrant; Whereas his efforts on behalf of the citizens of Massachusetts and all Americans earned him the esteem and high regard of his colleagues; Whereas more than 300 laws bear his name and he co- sponsored more than 2000 others covering civil rights, health care, the minimum wage, education, human rights and many other issues; and Whereas with his death his State and the Nation have lost an outstanding lawmaker and public servant: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate has received with profound sorrow and deep regret the announcement of the passing of the Honorable Edward Moore Kennedy, the great Senator from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate communicate these resolutions to the House of Representatives and transmit an enrolled copy thereof to the Kennedy family. Resolved, That when the Senate adjourns today, it stand adjourned as a further mark of respect to the memory of the deceased Senator. Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 255, submitted earlier today. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the resolution by title. The legislative clerk read as follows: A resolution (S. Res. 255) relative to the death of the Honorable Edward Moore Kennedy, a Senator from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution. Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements be printed in the Record. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The resolution (S. Res. 255) was agreed to. The preamble was agreed to. Mr. UDALL of Colorado. If there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it adjourn under the provisions of S. Res. 255 as a further mark of respect for the memory of our late colleague, Senator Edward Moore Kennedy. There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:06 p.m., adjourned until Wednesday, September 9, 2009, at 10 a.m. Wednesday, September 9, 2009 Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we knew it was coming. Yet the sight of Senator Edward Kennedy's desk draped in the black velvet of mourning is painfully sad. America and the world have lost a great champion of civil rights, human rights, and fairness. As President Obama said so well, Senator Kennedy was not only historic, he was heroic. We will have more time later this week to talk about his extraordinary life and the honor those of us who served with him enjoyed during his life. Today, I wish to say what a great honor it was to have worked alongside Ted Kennedy. On his desk today is a copy of one of his favorite poems, ``The Road Less Traveled'' by Robert Frost. There is another Frost poem that is identified with the Kennedys that Ted Kennedy loved as well. It is called ``Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.'' It is the story of a man who pauses to admire the simple serene beauty of a New England woods filling softly with snow and wishes he could stay longer. It reads: But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep. Unlike his beloved brothers, Senator Kennedy's life was not one of promise cut short but a life of promises kept. He loved America, and his life's work made us a better and more just Nation. If Ted Kennedy were here today, I feel absolutely certain that he would be on the floor at this moment talking about health care. It really was the hallmark of his public career. From the beginning, he understood this was one of the most fundamental things when it came to justice and fairness in America. ... Mr. MARTINEZ. ... We did also strive mightily in this body to seek a solution to immigration reform, something I felt very strongly about. And being the only immigrant in this body, I believed I was dutybound to try to advance that cause. I am proud to say our efforts for immigration reform gave me the opportunity to work very closely with Senator Ted Kennedy, whom we are honoring today, with nearly a half century of service in the Senate. I can recall reminiscing with him one day near his desk. He came to the Senate in 1962. That was the same year I came here from Cuba. It was also immediately after we had a very serious confrontation involving Cuba--the Cuban missile crisis. I remember discussing with him how his family will be tied to that period of time, to the history of Cuba, and how deeply that had touched my life as well. In addition to the many opportunities to reminisce about things such as that with him, I hold dear the opportunity to have sat at a table and negotiated with him what I thought would have been a very good immigration reform package--a bill that I believed would be good for our country and good for many people in our country. We didn't always agree. We didn't always have the same point of view. But we always found a way to get along and be very civil about our differences, and I admired greatly his ability to put differences aside and his desire to find consensus. What was most telling about working with Senator Kennedy is that he was committed to reaching an outcome. He wanted a solution, which then meant--and this might be a lesson for current issues today--that he could put aside the whole banana in order to get what he could. ... President's Address Delivered to a Joint Session of Congress on September 9, 2009 The PRESIDENT ... That is why we cannot fail. Because there are too many Americans counting on us to succeed-- the ones who suffer silently, and the ones who shared their stories with us at townhall meetings, in emails, and in letters. I received one of those letters a few days ago. It was from our beloved friend and colleague, Ted Kennedy. He had written it back in May, shortly after he was told that his illness was terminal. He asked that it be delivered upon his death. In it, he spoke about what a happy time his last months were, thanks to the love and support of family and friends, his wife, Vicki, and his children, who are here tonight. And he expressed confidence that this would be the year that health care reform--``that great unfinished business of our society,'' he called it--would finally pass. He repeated the truth that health care is decisive for our future prosperity, but he also reminded me that ``it concerns more than material things.'' ``What we face,'' he wrote, ``is above all a moral issue; at stake are not just the details of policy, but fundamental principles of social justice and the character of our country.'' I've thought about that phrase quite a bit in recent days--the character of our country. One of the unique and wonderful things about America has always been our self- reliance, our rugged individualism, our fierce defense of freedom, and our healthy skepticism of government. And figuring out the appropriate size and role of government has always been a source of rigorous and sometimes angry debate. For some of Ted Kennedy's critics, his brand of liberalism represented an affront to American liberty. In their mind, his passion for universal health care was nothing more than a passion for big government. But those of us who know Teddy and worked with him here--people of both parties--know that what drove him was something more. His friend, Orrin Hatch, knows that. They worked together to provide children with health insurance. His friend John McCain knows that. They worked together on a patient's bill of rights. His friend Chuck Grassley knows that. They worked together to provide health care to children with disabilities. On issues like these, Ted Kennedy's passion was born not of some rigid ideology, but of his own experience. It was the experience of having two children stricken with cancer. He never forgot the sheer terror and helplessness that any parent feels when a child is badly sick; and he was able to imagine what it must be like for those without insurance; what it would be like to have to say to a wife or a child or an aging parent--there is something that could make you better, but I just can't afford it. That large-heartedness--that concern and regard for the plight of others--is not a partisan feeling. It is not a Republican or a Democratic feeling. It, too, is part of the American character. Our ability to stand in other people's shoes. A recognition that we are all in this together; that when fortune turns against one of us, others are there to lend a helping hand. A belief that in this country, hard work and responsibility should be rewarded by some measure of security and fair play; and an acknowledgement that sometimes government has to step in to help deliver on that promise. ... But that's not what the moment calls for. That's not what we came here to do. We did not come to fear the future. We came here to shape it. I still believe we can act even when it's hard. I still believe we can replace acrimony with civility, and gridlock with progress. I still believe we can do great things, and that here and now we will meet history's test. Because that is who we are. That is our calling. That is our character. Thank you, God Bless You, and may God Bless the United States of America. Thursday, September 10, 2009 Mr. REID. ``A freshmen Senator should be seen, not heard; should learn, and not teach.'' Mr. President, that is a quote from Senator Ted Kennedy. These are the very first words he spoke on the floor of this Chamber. He was hesitant to rise and speak that April day when he said those words. He had been a Senator for less than 18 months. The country was still reeling from President Kennedy's death just months before. But the question before the Senate was the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and Senator Kennedy knew he could hold his tongue no longer. He rose to speak because he loved his country. He waited as long as he did to give that maiden speech because he loved this institution. In that speech, he said a Senator of his stature at the time should be seen and not heard. But 45 years later, we can still hear his great booming voice. He said young Senators should learn and not teach. But who can list all we learned from his leadership? It was a thrill to work with Ted Kennedy personally. He was a friend, the model of public service, and an American icon. He was a patriarch of both the Kennedy family and the Senate family. Together we mourn his loss. At so many difficult times in their family's history, the Kennedys have turned to their Uncle Teddy for comfort. At so many critical times in our country's history, America has turned to Ted Kennedy for the same. We can all remember how he walked solemnly with the grieving First Lady at Arlington National Cemetery. We can remember how his deep love for his brother helped him somehow summon the strength to deliver a defining eulogy in New York. We can all remember how, as patriarch, he memorialized his nephew off the shores of Massachusetts. For decades, Ted Kennedy was a rock to his family. The impact he has etched into our history will long endure. It is now left to us to remember the man who helped remember the lives of so many others. He was a very famous man. If you take the subway, people would always come up to Senator Kennedy. I would joke with him, ``Ted, are they coming for me or for you?'' It was obvious whom they were coming for. It was a joke. Ted was so good. When he thought you did something well, he would drop you a note or give you a call. It meant a lot to me that he would take the time to do that. I have come to learn since his death that he did that for so many people. You didn't have to be a Senator. He would do that for anybody whom he thought deserved a pat on the back. It is up to us to celebrate a Senator who helped so many live better lives. I have long been a devotee of the Kennedys and an admirer of their service to our Nation. As a student at Utah State University, I founded the first Young Democrats Club--in that bastion of Republicanism. I worked for President Kennedy's election in 1960. A week before President Kennedy took the oath of office and implored us to ask what we can do for our country, John Kennedy sent me a personal letter of thanks. He had won the election, but he had not yet been inaugurated. That letter still hangs at the doorway of my Capitol office, just a few feet off the Senate floor, where the three youngest Kennedy brothers ably served. That letter he sent me was for the work I did out West for that campaign. Many times, Ted would come to my office, and he would stop and look at that letter. He would always say, ``That's his signature,'' indicating that some staff hadn't signed it or some machine hadn't signed it. He was proud that his brother had done what he learned from his brother to do--send these very meaningful letters. He was proud of his brother. He was proud of his own work in the Western States during the 1960 race and proud that I kept that memento in such a prominent place. President-elect Kennedy's letter was short, but it overflowed with optimism. He wrote to me that the incoming era would allow us to ``make our country an even better place for our citizens to live, as well as to strengthen our country's position of leadership in the world.'' Think how I felt getting that letter. I was still a student. Ted Kennedy shared the dream his brother had, and he never stopped working to realize it. Ted Kennedy's legacy stands with the greatest, the most devoted, the most patriotic men and women to ever serve in these Halls. Because of Ted Kennedy, more young children could afford to become healthy. Because of Ted Kennedy, more young adults could afford to become college students. Because of Ted Kennedy, more of our oldest and poorest citizens could get the care they need to live longer, fuller lives. Because of Ted Kennedy, more minorities, women, and immigrants could realize the rights our founding documents promised them. Because of him, more Americans could be proud of their country. Ted Kennedy came from a family of great wealth and status. He didn't need to work hard for himself. So he chose a life of working hard for others. When he was admitted to the Massachusetts bar in 1959, the application asked him to state his main ambition. Ted Kennedy answered: ``The public service of this State.'' To quote one of his favorite poems--the Robert Frost verses that now rest on his desk on the Senate floor-- ``that has made all the difference.'' Ted Kennedy's America was one in which all could pursue justice, enjoy equality, and know freedom. That is Ted Kennedy. Ted's life was driven by his love of a family who loved him and his belief in a country that believed in him. Ted's dream was the one for which the Founding Fathers fought and which his brothers sought to realize. The liberal lion's mighty roar may now fall silent, but his dream shall never die. One of his older brothers was killed in World War II. He was a pilot going into a mission, and he recognized going into it he would probably never come back. His other brother--the President--was assassinated. His other brother, as a Senator running for President, was assassinated. Again, Senator Kennedy's dream shall never die. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is recognized. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I, too, would like to speak of our departed colleague, Ted Kennedy, whose passing last month focused the attention of the Nation and whose extraordinary life has been memorialized over these past weeks in so many poignant stories and heartfelt expressions of gratitude and grief. Today, the Senate also grieves--not only because he was a friend but because the Senate was so much a part of who he was and because he became so much a part of the Senate. The simplest measure is sheer longevity. At the time of his death, Ted could call himself the third longest serving Senator in history, having served almost one-fifth of the time the Senate itself has existed. Or consider this: When I was an intern here in the sixties, Ted was already a well-known Senator. When I was elected to the Senate nearly a quarter of a century ago, Ted had already been here for nearly a quarter of a century. He served with 10 Presidents or nearly 1 out of every 4 of them. No one could have predicted that kind of run for Ted on the day he became a Senator back on November 7, 1962--no one, that is, except maybe Ted. Ted had signaled what his legacy might be as far back as 1965, when he spoke of setting a record for longevity. Mike Mansfield saw a glimpse of it, too, a few years later. When somebody mentioned Ted as a possible Presidential candidate, Mansfield responded: He's in no hurry. He's young. He likes the Senate. Of all the Kennedys, he is the only one who was and is a real Senate man. As it turned out, Mansfield was right. But Ted knew even then that his legacy as a lawmaker would not come about just by sitting at his desk; he would have to build it. And over the course of the next 47 years, that is exactly what he did, slowly, patiently, doggedly, making his mark as much in tedious committee hearings as on the stump, as much in the details of legislation as in its broader themes. Ted's last name ensured he was already one of the stars of American politics even before he became a Senator. To this day, he is still the only man or woman in U.S. history to be elected to the Senate while one of his relatives sat in the White House. But to those who thought Ted, even if elected, would avoid the rigors of public life, he became a living rebuke. In short, he became a Senator. He surprised the skeptics, first of all, with his friendliness and his wit. When he made his national political debut in 1962 on ``Meet the Press,'' a questioner asked him if maybe there were already too many Kennedys. His response: ``You should have talked to my mother and father ...'' Russell Long was an early admirer. In what has to go down as one of the falsest first impressions in modern politics, Long spoke approvingly of the new Senator from Massachusetts as ``a quiet ... sort of fellow.'' Ted got along with everybody. The earliest memories family members have are of Ted laughing and making other people laugh. His secret weapon then, and years later, as Chris Dodd rightly pointed out at one of the memorial services, was simply this: People liked him, so much so that he could call people such as Jim Eastland, somebody with whom he had absolutely nothing in common, a friend. Ted had learned early on that he could be more effective through alliances and relationships than by hollering and carrying on. We all know he did a fair amount of that as well. He provided some of the best theater the Senate has ever known. But once he left the Chamber, he turned that off. He sought out allies wherever he could find them-- Strom Thurmond, Dan Quayle, Orrin Hatch, John McCain, and even George W. Bush--and he earned their cooperation by keeping his word and through thousands of small acts of kindness. Senator McCain has recounted the birthday bash Ted threw 10 years ago for his son Jimmy's 11th birthday. Senator Barrasso remembers the kindness Ted showed him as a new Senator. And Senator Barrasso's family will long remember how much time Senator Kennedy spent sharing stories with them at the reception after the swearing in and that he was one of the last ones to leave. Like so many others, I have known Ted's graciousness first hand. Anyone who watches C-SPAN2 could see Ted railing at the top of his lungs against my position on this policy or that policy. What they didn't see was the magnificent show he put on a few years ago in Kentucky at my invitation for students at the University of Louisville or the framed photo he gave me that day of my political role model, John Sherman Cooper. I interned for Cooper as a young man. Ted knew that, and he knew Cooper was a good friend and neighbor of his brother Jack's. Ted's gregariousness was legendary, but his passion and intensity as a lawmaker would also reach near-mythic proportions in his own lifetime. Even those of us who saw the same problems but different solutions on issue after issue, even we could not help but admire the focus and the fight Ted brought to every debate in which he played a part. Over the years, we came to see what he was doing in the Senate. When it came to Ted's future, everyone was always looking at it through the prism of the Presidency. They should have focused on this Chamber instead. It was here that he slowly built the kind of influence and voice for a national constituency that was common for Senators in the 19th century but extremely rare in the 20th. He became a fiery spokesman for liberals everywhere. Ted and I would have had a hard time agreeing on the color of the carpet when we were in the Chamber together. Yet despite his public image as a liberal firebrand, he was fascinated by the hard work of creating consensus and jumped into that work, even toward the end, with the enthusiasm of a young staffer. Ted's high school teammates recall that he never walked to the huddle; he always ran. Anyone who ever sat across from Ted at a conference table believed it. Ted realized Senators could do an awful lot once they got past the magnetic pull Pennsylvania Avenue has on so many Senators. His brother Jack once said that as a Senator, he thought the President had all the influence, but it wasn't until he was President that he realized how much influence Senators had. It was a similar insight that led Ted to tell a group of Boston Globe reporters in 1981 that for him, the Senate was fulfilling, satisfying, challenging, and that he could certainly spend his life here, which, of course, he did. Then, when it was winding down, he saw what he had done as a Senator and what the Senate had done for him. He wanted others to see it too, so he set about to establish the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate, a place that would focus on this institution the way Presidential libraries focus on Presidents. The Founders, of course, envisioned the legislative and executive branches as carrying equal weight. Article I is about Congress, after all, not the Presidency. His life and legacy help restore that vision of a legislative counterweight of equal weight. That is an important institutional contribution every Senator can appreciate. It is something he did through hard work, tenacity, and sheer will. It was not the legacy most expected, but it is the legacy he wrought, and in the end he could call it his own. Toward the end of his life, one of the great lawmakers of the 19th century, Henry Clay, was asked to speak to the Kentucky General Assembly. Thanks to Clay's efforts, the Compromise of 1850 had just been reached, and Clay had become a national hero through a job he had spent most of his career trying to escape. His speech received national coverage, and, according to one biographer, all acknowledged his privileged station as an elder statesman. For years, Clay had wanted nothing more than to be President of the United States. But now, after this last great legislative victory, something else came into view. Clay told the assembled crowd that day that in the course of months and months of intense negotiations leading up to the Great Compromise, he had consulted with Democrats just as much as he had with Members of his own party and found in them just as much patriotism and honor as he had found with the Whigs. The whole experience had moved Clay away from party rivalry, he said, and toward a new goal. ``I want no office, no station in the gift of man,'' he said, ``[except] a warm place in your hearts.'' Every man has his own story. Ted Kennedy never moved away from party rivalry. He was a fierce partisan to the end. But over the years, he reminded the world of the great potential of this institution and even came to embody it. We will never forget the way he filled the Chamber with that booming voice, waving his glasses at his side, jabbing his fingers at the air, or the many times we saw him playing outside with his dogs. How many times did we spot him coming through the doorway or onto an elevator, his hair white as the surf, and think: Here comes history itself. As the youngest child in one of the most influential political families in U.S. history, Ted Kennedy had enormous shoes to fill. Yet in nearly 50 years of service as a young Senator, a candidate for President, a legislative force, and an elder statesman, it is hard to argue that he didn't fill those shoes in a part he wrote all by himself. It is hard to imagine the Senate without Ted thundering on the floor. It will be harder still, I am sure, for the Kennedy family to think of a future without him. You could say all these things and more about the late Senator from Massachusetts, and you could also say this: Edward Moore Kennedy will always have a warm place in our hearts. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell for the time they have set aside for us today to remember Ted Kennedy, our beloved colleague, my senior Senator for nearly a quarter of a century, a friend, a man I met first and who had great influence on me in politics back in 1962 when, as a young, about-to-be college student, I had the privilege of working as a volunteer in his first campaign for the Senate. It is difficult to look at his desk now cloaked in the velvet and the roses, a desk from which he championed so many important causes, a desk from which he regaled us, educated us, and befriended us for so many years, and even more difficult for us to think of this Chamber, our Nation's Capital, or our country without him. On many occasions in the Senate, he was the indispensable man. On every occasion in this Chamber and out, he was a man whose heart was as big as heaven, whose optimism could overwhelm any doubter, and whose joy for life was a wonderfully contagious and completely irresistible thing. Ted loved poetry, and though the verse was ancient, the poet could have had Ted in mind when he wrote: ``One must wait until the evening to see how splendid the day has been.'' Our day with Ted Kennedy was, indeed, splendid, its impact immeasurable. Just think for a moment what a different country we lived in before Ted Kennedy came to the Senate in 1962 and what a more perfect Union we live in for the 47 years he served here. Before Ted Kennedy had a voice in the Senate and a vote in the Senate, there was no Civil Rights Act, no Voting Rights Act, no Medicare, no Medicaid, no vote for 18 year olds, no Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday, no Meals on Wheels, no equal funding for women's collegiate sports, no State Health Insurance Program, no Family Medical Leave Act, no AmeriCorps, no National Service Act. All of these are literally just a part of Ted's legislative legacy. It is why the Boston Globe once wrote that in actual measurable impact on the lives of tens of millions of working families, the elderly, and the needy, Ted belongs in the same sentence with Franklin Roosevelt. Ted's season of service spanned the administrations, as we heard from the minority leader, of 10 Presidents. He served with more than 350 Senators, including those for whom our principal office buildings are named: Richard Russell, Everett Dirksen, and Philip Hart. He cast more than 16,000 votes. He wrote more than 2,500 bills. He had an important hand in shaping almost every single important law that affects our lives today. He helped create nearly every major social program in the last 40 years. He was the Senate's seminal voice for civil rights, women's rights, human rights, and the rights of workers. He stood against judges who would turn back the clock on constitutional freedoms. He pointed America away from war, first in Vietnam and last in Iraq. And for three decades, including the last days, he labored with all his might to make health care a right for all Americans. Through it all, even as he battled, he showed us how to be a good colleague, always loyal, always caring, always lively. His adversaries were never his enemies. And his friends always came first. In my office there is a photograph of the two of us on day one--1985--my first day in the Senate. Ted signed it: ``As Humphrey Bogart would have said: `This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.''' For almost 25 years it was a beautiful friendship, as I worked at his side learning from the best. And, yes, like any colleague in the Senate, there were moments when we had a difference on one issue or another, but we always found a way to move forward in friendship and in our efforts to represent the State. Teddy was the best natural teacher anyone in politics could ask for. I may not always have been the best student, but he never stopped dispensing the lessons. I came to the Senate out of an activist grassroots political base, where the coin of the realm was issues and policy positions. Activists are sometimes, as I learned, so issue focused and intent that they can inadvertently look past the personal touch or the emotional connection for fear that it somehow distracts from the agenda. But Teddy, through his actions, showed us how essential all of those other elements of political life are. Yes, Tip O'Neill taught a generation of Massachusetts politicians that all politics is local. It was Teddy who went beyond that and taught us that all politics is personal. All of us knew the kindness of Ted Kennedy at one time or another, Mr. President. During my first term in the Senate, I came down with pneumonia. I was then single and tired and Ted deemed me not to be getting the care I ought to get. So the next thing I knew, he literally instructed me to depart for Florida to stay in the Kennedy home in Palm Beach and be cared for until I got well. Indeed, I did exactly that. He also showed up at my house the evening of Inauguration Day 2005, and together with Chris Dodd, we shared laughter and stories from the campaign trail. We were loud enough and had enough fun that someone might have wondered if we were somehow mistaken and thought we had won. He understood the moment. He knew the best tonic was laughter and friendship. Many times that is all he needed to do, just be there. You couldn't help but feel better with him around. All of us who served with him were privileged to share Ted's incredible love of life and laughter. In the Cloakroom, sometimes the roars of laughter were so great they could be heard out on the Senate floor. Once I remember Ted was holding forth--I will not share the topic--and the Presiding Officer pounded the gavel and demanded, ``There will be order in the Senate and in the Cloakroom.'' It was the first time I ever heard that call for order. His pranks were also works of art and usually brilliantly calculated. One night after a long series of Thursday night votes that had pushed Senators past the time to catch commercial flights home to the Northeast, Senator Frank Lautenberg had arranged for a private charter for himself in order to get up to Massachusetts. It turned out a number of Senators needed to travel in that direction, and when Frank learned of it, he kindly offered Senator Claiborne Pell, Ted, and myself a ride with him. There was no discussion of sharing the cost. Everyone thought Frank was being very generous. But the next week, when we were reassembled on the floor of the Senate, official-looking envelopes were delivered to each of us under Frank Lautenberg's signature with exorbitant expenses charged for this flight. Senator Pell roared down the aisle, came up to me sputtering about this minor little aircraft and how could it possibly cost so much money. Senator Lautenberg was red-faced, protesting he knew nothing about it, when out of the corner of my eye I spotted Ted Kennedy up there by his desk with this big Cheshire cat grin starting to split a gut, so pleased with himself. The mystery was solved. Ted had managed to secure a few sheets of Lautenberg stationery, and he sent false bills to each of us. He once told me his earliest recollections were of pillow fights with his brother Jack and, in the years following, sailing with Jack. At the end of the day Ted's job was the long and tedious task of folding and packing the sails away. In politics and in the great progressive battles that were his life's work, Ted never packed his sails away. Were he here today, he would exhort us to sail into the wind, as he did so many times. There is still so much to do, so much that he wanted to do, and so much that he would want us to do now, not in his name but in his spirit. When Ted was 12 years old, he spent hours with his brother Jack taking turns reading the epic Civil War poem ``John Brown's Body,'' by Stephen Vincent Benet. It is book length and filled with great and terrible scenes of battle and heartbreaking vignettes of loss and privation and home. It surprises me to read it now and find so much in it that in fact reminds me of Ted. Benet wrote: Sometimes there comes a crack in time itself. Sometimes the Earth is torn by something blind. Sometimes an image that has stood so long it seems implanted on the polar star is moved against an unfathomed force that suddenly will not have it anymore. Call it the mores, call it God or Fate, call it Mansoul or economic law, that force exists and moves. And when it moves it will employ a hard and actual stone to batter into bits an actual wall and change the actual scheme of things. Ted Kennedy was such a stone who actually changed the scheme of things on so many issues for so many people. Over the years, I have received hundreds of handwritten notes from Ted--some funny, some touching, all of them treasures. Just before Thanksgiving Ted sent me a note that he would be spending the holiday with his beloved sailboat, the Mya. He added: ``If you are out on the sound, look for the Mya. She will be there.'' Indeed, I will never sail the sound again without thinking of the Mya and her big hard skipper. There is an anonymous quote that I once read, which because of Ted's faith--which was grounded and deeply important to him--I think describes how we should think of his departure from the Senate. It says: I am standing upon the seashore. A ship at my side spreads her white sails to the morning breeze and starts for the blue ocean. She is an object of beauty and strength. I stand and watch her until at length she hangs like a speck of white cloud just where the sea and sky come down to mingle with each other. Then, someone at my side says; ``There, she is gone!'' ``Gone where?'' Gone from my sight. That is all. She is just as large in mast and hull and spar as she was when she left my side and she is just as able to bear her load of living freight to her destined port. Her diminished size is in me, not in her. And just at the moment when someone at my side says, ``There, she is gone!'' There are other eyes watching her coming, and other voices ready to take up the glad shout; ``Here she comes!'' And that is dying. That is the way Ted Kennedy will live in the Senate--his spirit, his words, and the fight that still comes. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico. Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first, let me thank my colleague from Massachusetts for his eloquent statement which I have had the privilege to hear. Let me make a short statement myself about my friend and colleague, Ted Kennedy. I came to the Senate in January 1983, and my first real opportunity to work with Ted came in the Armed Services Committee at the beginning of that service. Although he had already been in the Senate for 20 years, he had chosen that year to go on the Armed Services Committee. Since we were both going on that year, in 1983, we were considered the two freshmen committee members. Ted and I were able to work together on the Armed Services Committee for many years. He has been described as a visionary leader, a great orator, the keeper of the faith for the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. All of those descriptions, of course, are true. But the Ted Kennedy I came to know and with whom I had the great opportunity to work was a passionate, committed advocate and was the workhorse of the Senate. Frankly, Ted Kennedy set a very high standard for himself in the effort that he made on each and every issue that came up for debate. He set a high standard for the homework he did in preparation for that debate. All of us who served with him found ourselves trying to meet a similar standard. The result was that he raised the level of performance for those of us who served with him by the example he set. In addition to serving with Ted Kennedy on the Armed Services Committee for many years, in May 1990, following the death of Senator Matsunaga, I had the good fortune to be assigned to what was then called the Labor and Human Resources Committee--Ted's committee. As chairman, Ted gave a whole new meaning to the word ``proactive'' in that committee. The volume of useful legislation he was able to move forward through the committee was truly impressive. A major key to his success was the way he found to underscore for all members the importance of what the committee was working on. As chairman, he rightly saw it as his job to put together the agenda and the priorities for the committee's work. But before doing that he would sit down with the rest of us over dinner at his house to get our views on what those priorities needed to be. The serious approach he took to the committee's work inspired those of us who served there to elevate the importance of that work in our own minds as well. During the course of our work in the Senate, each of us gets the opportunity to interact with many colleagues, to form judgments about those colleagues. During my 27 years I have served with many capable and dedicated public servants who deserve recognition and praise. But it is clear to me none of us exceeds Ted Kennedy in our passion or commitment for accomplishing the work we have been sent to do. Hendrick Hertzberg wrote a short piece in the New Yorker last week that captures well the Ted Kennedy with whom I was privileged to know and serve. Mr. Hertzberg wrote: The second half of his 47-year senatorial career was a wonder of focused, patient, unwavering service to a practical liberalism that emphasized concrete improvements in the lives of the poor, the old, the disabled, children, the uninsured, the undocumented, the medically or educationally disadvantaged. That phrase--focused, patient, unwavering service--is a good description of the Ted Kennedy I knew as my chairman and my friend, and I will miss him very much. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut. Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I also want to rise this morning to share some brief thoughts about our colleague from Massachusetts. I want to commend John Kerry and Jeff Bingaman for their comments capturing the good qualities of the Senator from Massachusetts. This is a hall noted for a robust amount of noise, and it seems quiet today because Teddy is not here. So we gather to share a few thoughts. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record some remarks I made at the memorial service for Senator Kennedy at the John F. Kennedy Library. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [Mr. Dodd's remarks can be found on page 258.] Mr. DODD. I was very honored to be asked by Mrs. Kennedy and her family to share some thoughts that evening, and I was proud to do so. I commend my colleague from Rhode Island, Patrick Kennedy, for his comments at his father's funeral, and Teddy's son Edward Kennedy, as well, who made wonderful comments about their father at that funeral service. A few short thoughts this morning, and a proposal I wish to make to our colleagues as we recognize the contribution of Senator Kennedy. When we consider how to pay tribute to our colleagues, we often try to devise monuments to celebrate the work of those who served here and made a significant contribution to our country. It is not an easy task. I have tried to think about what would be an appropriate way to celebrate, in some concrete way, the work of Ted Kennedy. He certainly has been, as our colleagues and others have pointed out over these last couple of weeks, one of the greatest Members to ever serve in this body. I had the distinction and honor of serving as the chairman of the Rules Committee a few years ago. I was asked to complete some of the ovals in the Reception Room. For those who have not been to Washington, or to the Capitol, there is a room a few feet from where I am speaking here this morning called the Reception Room. It was designed by the great artist, Brumidi, and he intended that work to celebrate the work of the Senate. In the mid-1950s, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, then a freshman Senator from Massachusetts, was asked by the leadership of this body to form a committee to identify the five most significant Senators who had served up until the 1950s. Then-Senator John Kennedy of Massachusetts went to work, reviewing the contributions of the people who served in this body since the founding of our Republic in 1789. He concluded there were five Members who deserved recognition. The first three were the obvious ones: Clay, Calhoun, and Webster. The last two, Senator LaFollette of Wisconsin and Senator Taft of Ohio, were more controversial, but were accepted as fine contributions to that room that celebrates those who have contributed the most to this body and our country. I was asked a couple of years ago to help add a couple more names to that honor roll of renowned Members of this body. We concluded that Senator Vandenberg, who made such a contribution to the post-World War II foreign policy of our Nation, along with Senator Wagner of New York, who back in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, was the author of much of the social legislation that we celebrate in this country today, were fine additions to those who had already been recognized in this Reception Room just off the floor of the Senate. One day it will be appropriate to add our colleague and friend from Massachusetts, who deserves to be in that hall of celebrated heroes, having made a significant contribution to this institution and to the people of our country. But there are other ways to celebrate him as well. I suspect that Senator Kennedy, if he had a chance to weigh in on how he would like to be recognized and remembered, might choose other means. There are very few issues over the last half century on which Senator Kennedy did not leave his mark, and a good many of the most significant pieces of legislation that passed this Senate in his time not only bear his mark but bear his name as the author. That, in a sense, is a monument, one with a meaning far broader than anything we might inscribe on any wall. Across America there are people who might have lacked for an advocate had Ted Kennedy not stood up for them, people who can now stand up for themselves with dignity and hope and a chance to make it in America because they had a friend by the name of Edward Moore Kennedy. These Americans are also a monument that I think Senator Kennedy might say is fitting enough--that there are people today doing better, living more secure lives, growing up with a sense of confidence and optimism about their future and the future of our country because of his contribution. That in itself is a great monument. Perhaps we could consider the flood of tributes that have come from across the aisle as well as across the globe, from those who shared in his crusade for social justice and those who spent their careers opposing him, and those who never enjoyed the privilege of working alongside him. All understood how important Senator Kennedy was, not only to this Nation but to millions of people around the globe who today lead better lives because he stood up for them even though they were not citizens of our own country. He understood that the Founders of our Republic, when they talk about inalienable rights, were not limiting those rights in our minds to those who happen to enjoy the privilege of being citizens of our country but knew that they were God-given rights that every human being is endowed with upon birth, regardless of where they live. Ted Kennedy understood that intuitively, deeply, and passionately. That in itself, I suppose, could be a great tribute, knowing there are people whom he never met, never even knew what he looked like, who lead better lives today because of his contribution. Then perhaps we might consider these tributes offered by our colleagues here and others, the literally thousands who lined up in those long hours to pay tribute to their Senator from Massachusetts at the John F. Kennedy Library, the more than 50,000 people in Massachusetts who had known and respected, elected and reelected and reelected and reelected, over and over again, their Senator. They appreciated him immensely for the work he did for them and their Commonwealth for almost 50 years. In itself that is a great tribute. It would be enough, I think, for many of us, being recognized by the people of your State for having fought on their behalf. Teddy's monument can be found in his talented and wonderful family as well. Joe Biden talked about this in the memorial service in the John F. Kennedy Library. When you consider this remarkable family of Senator Kennedy and those of his brothers, their children, their nieces and nephews, it is a source of inspiration when you think of what each of them has done, the contributions they have made. A few short weeks prior to Teddy's passing, he lost his sister Eunice, who was a wonderful friend of mine over many years. She did remarkable things as an individual. To think, millions of people who suffer from mental disabilities enjoy a greater respect today because of one individual, Eunice Kennedy Shriver. Teddy's brother Joe lost his life in World War II, defending our country and fighting for freedom. His sister Jean has done a remarkable job with the Very Special Arts in her contribution to the country. And then look at his wonderful wife Vicki, who was such an incredible source of strength and inspiration for him during their life together and particularly over the last 15 months. There is no doubt in my mind Teddy lived as long as he did with brain cancer because Vicki was at his side and took such nurturing care of him and has done a remarkable job providing all of us the opportunity to celebrate his life as we all wished to do. His children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews--all are following Teddy's example by making a difference in this country. His son Patrick I mentioned already, serves in the other body. His son Teddy is a great friend of mine, lives in Connecticut and is making a significant contribution as a citizen of our State. He holds no office, doesn't have any title. He and his wife make a wonderful difference on many issues in our State every single day, and his daughter Kara, for whom he has such great affection, has also made her contributions as well. That in itself can be a monument. How many would say if your children and family do well and stand up and make a difference in the lives of other people, what better tribute, what higher form of compliment, could you have, or form of flattery, than to know that your children, your family, your nieces or nephews, your sisters and brothers, are out making a difference in the lives of others? In a way, it is hard to decide what is an appropriate way to celebrate the life of someone who filled the room on so many occasions, not only with his booming voice--as we all are familiar with here, particularly the staff of the Senate who would, many times, be the only ones in this room as Ted Kennedy would be pounding that podium back in that corner, expressing his passionate views about some great cause of the country. But we remember also his determination that this country live up to its expectations, that it become the more perfect union that our Founders described more than two centuries ago. Today, I wish to make a suggestion to my colleagues. I talked to the leadership about it and to the Republican leadership as well. Never before in the history of this country have three brothers served in this Chamber: Jack Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and, of course, Teddy Kennedy. That has never happened before in the history of our Nation. One of the rooms that has been of similarly historic significance to our Nation is the Caucus Room in the Russell Office Building. It has been the site of remarkable hearings and meetings. Since its building almost a century ago, that room has been very important. The hearings on the Titanic were held in that room; the Watergate hearings, going back years ago, were held in that room. It is there that we have commemorated tragedies. We have met to celebrate triumphs in that room. We have gathered as Members with our spouses from time to time to share some quiet moments with each other as we reflected on our responsibilities here as Senators. We have held some of the greatest debates that have ever occurred in that room. It is there that Senator Kennedy's Health Committee, in which I was privileged to act as sort of a fill-in for him over the last number of months, held 5 weeks of hearings and debate and markup of a bill that concluded in the adoption of the health care reform legislation that he authored. It is in that room that Senator Kennedy's brothers each announced their candidacies for the Presidency of the United States. Both Jack Kennedy and Robert Kennedy, in that very room, announced that they intended to seek that office. And it is there that I propose we affix the Kennedy name, not just as a monument to the things these three brothers did as Senators and as colleagues of ours here, but in the spirit of compassion and compromise, the fierce advocacy and tender friendship that Teddy and his brothers brought to this body. This was Teddy's wish and desire. I asked him what could we do to recognize him, and he said, ``I would like to have you recognize my brothers as well for their contribution.'' Ted Kennedy believed in impassioned debate. He believed in pounding that podium when it was appropriate. But he also believed that at the end of the day we best serve the people of our great Nation when we respect each other and work together in common cause to solve the problems of our day. Whatever history is made in the Caucus Room of the Russell Senate Office Building in the next century, I would like to believe it will be guided by that spirit of respect and good humor that Teddy Kennedy brought to this institution for almost a half century. Thus, may the Kennedy Caucus Room stand as one monument to the contribution of a family that has made such a difference to our country. They devoted their considerable talents and energy and their lives to serving our Nation that they loved and that loved them back. I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized. Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise along with my colleagues to pay tribute to an extraordinary American, probably the greatest Senator to serve in this body. I think time will confirm that as we go forward. I particularly want to express my deepest sympathy to Vicki and Kara and Patrick and Ted, Jr. I have had the privilege now of serving not only with Senator Ted Kennedy but also with Congressman Patrick Kennedy, and both of these gentlemen have demonstrated zeal for public service and commitment and passion to help people that has been emblematic of the Kennedy family. I particularly am proud of Patrick, and his words at his father's funeral. His continued dedication to the people of Rhode Island is not only commendable but inspiring to me and to all of us. Like so many of my generation, I grew up with the Kennedy family. In 1960, John Kennedy carried the banner of the Democratic Party as the Presidential candidate. He won, but, as we understood then and now, we got the whole family, not just President John Kennedy, and it was a remarkable family--his brother Robert, the Attorney General and later the U.S. Senator from New York, and then, of course, Ted Kennedy. His contribution to the country and to the world is probably unmatchable as we go forward in every area: health care, which was his particular passion and on which President Obama spoke so movingly last evening about his commitment to moving forward in this Congress and finally achieving a dream that has eluded our country for years; his work with his son Patrick on mental health parity, which is so important. On education, I had the privilege of serving with him on the Education Committee and as a Member of the House to collaborate with him on education bills, and every major education initiative in this country bears his stamp, his input, his inspiration. He worked very closely with my predecessor, Senator Claiborne Pell, for the creation of the Pell grants and for so many other initiatives in education. He not only worked with Senator Pell, they developed a very deep and abiding friendship. One of the impressive things about Ted Kennedy is that the public persona was impressive, and the private persona was equally impressive and extraordinarily endearing. He was someone who had a great sense of camaraderie and friendship and good humor. I can recall being invited to join Senator Kennedy at the Pell's home in Newport after Senator Pell retired. Every year, unannounced, without any fanfare, Senator Kennedy would sail his boat up into Newport and insist on taking Senator Pell out for a cruise, and then they would all retire to the Pell home for a delightful supper. I was privileged to be there on a couple of occasions. Toward the end of his life, Senator Pell had difficulty moving around, but Senator Kennedy would insist on coming every summer. The last outing, we literally had to carry Senator Pell aboard. Senator Pell at that time was not communicating as effectively as he was previously, but he didn't have to because Senator Kennedy could take both parts of the conversation--in fact, he could take multiple parts of the conversation. There was never a lost word or a dull moment. It was a great opportunity to see an extraordinary statesman and at the same time an extraordinary gentleman. He said famously about his brothers that they lived to see the American dream become reality, and he said famously that the dream lives on. But he also, more than dreaming, tried to give substance, shape, and texture to that dream effectively, to try to ensure that opportunity was available to every American family, that they could use their talent to build their family and to secure their future and to contribute to a better America. That was why he led on health care, because without adequate health care, you cannot realize your talents, your potential, and you cannot contribute as much to this great country. He led on education, because it is the great engine that pulls this Nation forward and individually gives people an opportunity to move up and to help their families move forward. On civil rights, he was a strong advocate. In fact, I think it is fair to say that his first major speech was in favor of the 1964 Civil Rights Act because he understood that the talent of America was not restricted to any group and that to meet the challenges of this Nation and this world, we need the contribution and the participation of every American, regardless of race, regardless of gender. He also was someone who understood that for the working men and women of this country, they needed help, they needed to share in the bounty of this country. What we have seen over the last decade has been growth, up until the crisis of last September, but that growth was not shared fairly or evenly, executives getting huge salaries and bonuses and working men and women were barely keeping up. In order to have a strong, prosperous economy, we need a strong, prosperous middle class. His work in terms of education and health care and labor--all of that had a purpose not only of helping individuals but, wisely, trying to establish an environment for economic growth that we all could share. He also served on the defense committee with me. And he was very perceptive. He had spent many years viewing the world, and his understanding of not only the military but the forces, economic and cultural, that shape our interaction with other countries was profound in its insights. He was, very clearly, opposed to the operation in Iraq because he understood that it was a strategic deviation from the real task, which continues in Afghanistan, to root out Al Qaeda, to stabilize the region, the most volatile region in the country. That is just one example of his insight into the international arena. There is a story, and it is attributed to either his brother John or to Senator Kennedy, but I think it might be apropos for both. It might be slightly apocryphal, but either John or Ted, according to the story, was standing outside a factory and a worker came up and said, ``They tell me you have never worked a day in your life.'' And Kennedy was taken aback. Then shortly, the worker said, ``Don't worry, you haven't missed anything.'' A family of great privilege, of great opportunity, in fact, worked every day of their lives, and particularly Ted Kennedy, hard, relentlessly to ensure that person coming out of the factory had a chance. Finally, what I sensed when I was at the funeral service--which was extraordinarily moving and inspirational, the outpouring of affection and regard for Senator Kennedy not only by the dignitaries who assembled but by ordinary citizens of Massachusetts--and here lining the route to Arlington, bespeaks a connection and a validation by the American people of an individual who had trials and tribulations but rose above it in constant service to the country, in constant service to the people who do not have a voice, and constant service to those who need a chance to help themselves, to help their family, and to make the Nation a better place. It reminded me of words spoken about Franklin Delano Roosevelt. His cortege was moving through Washington, DC, and a man was visibly shaken and weeping. A reporter went up to him and said, ``You know, you are so upset, did you know the President?'' He said, ``No, I did not know him, but he knew me.'' Ted Kennedy knew us all. He knew our strengths, he knew our weaknesses, he knew that this government could make a difference, a positive difference in the lives of people. He had shared the same difficulties and challenges we face: children stricken with cancer, the loss of one of his sisters in an airplane crash, the loss of his brothers, and the human reality. And because he knew us, he never stopped working for us. His legacy is extraordinary. It will inspire and sustain us as we go forward. His loss, not just to his family, which is considerable, but for all of us, is balanced by how much he made us better, more attuned to the challenge of serving America and leading the world. We will miss him. But our task now is to take up his work, to continue his effort. That is the greatest tribute we can pay. Let us begin with this debate on health care. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand.) The Senator from Kansas. Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I rise to add my voice to those who have already paid tribute to our friend and colleague, the late Senator Ted Kennedy, who passed away this last month after a courageous battle with cancer. He was quite an institution. I came into this body in a seat held by an individual who was quite an institution as well. Bob Dole was in this seat. So I know that when people look to the person who follows after Ted Kennedy, you just can't replace an individual like that who was such a towering figure in this body, who was the lion of the Senate, as many have noted, and certainly deserved that topic and that accolade. While Senator Kennedy and I did not see eye to eye on most political issues, I admired him greatly as a colleague and certainly as a dedicated public servant. Ted Kennedy fought for what he believed and did so with passion and conviction and incomparable ability. When he was your opponent on an issue, you knew you had a fight on your hands, and when he was on your side, you knew you had an advocate who worked hard and effectively. His skills as a legislator were unmatched. I think what was at the core of that was he really enjoyed working with other people. He had built relationships across the aisle with individuals, so that he could personally go to other individuals with that relationship he had built. Even though there were huge disagreements on policy issues on many other fronts, he had the personal relationships. To him, I think, in many cases, it was a lot more about the person rather than policy. I think that is a good lesson for many of us to learn. He mastered the legislative process, became one of the most effective Members of this body and that this body has ever known. One of the keys of his effectiveness was his tenacity and perseverance in attending to, in many cases, the unglamorous details and the sometimes tedious work that goes into crafting and passing a bill. He also understood that getting things done as a politician means compromise. He had a great sense of when to fight on principle and when to reach out to the other side and arrive at an agreement in order to advance the cause for which he was fighting. I think you can probably look back over the last decade or 15 years of this body and no major piece of legislation passed without Ted Kennedy's fingerprints somewhere around or on that piece of legislation. Despite our political differences, I always found him to be professional, courteous, thoughtful, and a caring individual. He was always looking for ways to find common ground and had a wonderful ability to win others over to his side with that charm, Irish wit, fellowship, and gregarious nature. And once he made an agreement, you could depend on him to be true to his word, and to honor in public an agreement he had made in private. Over the years I had the opportunity to work on several legislative issues with Senator Kennedy. As many testified, he was the best ally one could ever hope for. Most recently we worked together to pass the Prenatally and Postnatally Diagnosed Conditions Awareness Act, a pro- life piece of legislation. When I would travel around the country saying that Ted Kennedy and I had introduced a pro-life piece of legislation together, many people would be quite startled. I would explain what this was. It was a piece of legislation that would encourage people, once they had a diagnosis that their child had Down syndrome in utero, not to abort the child but instead to have the child. It put together an adoption registry of individuals who were willing to adopt children with Down syndrome. We have this terrible plague in the country where 90 percent of our children who are diagnosed with Down syndrome never get here; they are aborted. In our office we went to the disability community. We went to his sister Eunice and talked with her about it. And I went to Ted. I remember how effective his sister Eunice would be on lobbying Ted on this piece of legislation. Just this past year, when we were able to move things forward with it, I met with Eunice. She was obviously getting more difficult and failing of health at that point. She said, ``Is Teddy being helpful? Is Teddy working with you and helping?'' I would say, ``Yes, he is, but you can always help us more and push him more.'' And she did. What an effective team that was on providing help for those especially with mental disabilities, even on this pro-life piece of legislation that I hope will result in more people getting here who have disabilities so that they are not killed in utero but instead get here and, if people can't handle that issue in their families, that they put them up for adoption. We have adoption registries ready to go for people who want to adopt a child who may have more difficulties. Working together we were able to find common ground on protecting the dignity of these precious Americans by providing parents who receive a pre- or postnatal diagnosis of genetic disability with resources, information, and a network of support. I am so pleased to know Senator Kennedy lived to see this bill passed and signed into law. It stands as an example of how we can find common ground to advance the interests of all Americans in spite of differences. This body truly will not be the same place without Ted Kennedy, without his rhetoric and his strong voice, his abilities as a legislator. My thoughts and prayers go out to him and his family and friends. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I join today with colleagues to pay tribute to the life and legacy of Senator Ted Kennedy. Each of us has lost a friend with his passing, and all Americans--but especially those in need--have lost a champion of government's ability to bring light to dark places. All of us stand in awe of the lengthy record of accomplishment Senator Kennedy leaves us. It was a great privilege to serve many years with Ted Kennedy on the Armed Services Committee and to witness first hand the traits so well known to Members of the Senate: the tireless preparation, the intimate knowledge of the legislative process, the relentless focus on justice and equality. Today our citizens are safer, our military more capable, our troops better equipped because of his service. Senator Kennedy approached his work with diligence and dedication. But he also knew that work goes more smoothly when it is accomplished with friendship and good humor. It was possible to disagree with Ted Kennedy but never to dislike him. His sense of humor was contagious, and his concern for those around him, from fellow Senators to staff, to the many often unheralded people who make the Senate function, ensured that he was loved as well as respected throughout this body. That love extends across lines of party and ideology, in part because of that good humor and genuine concern for others for which he is so rightly known. But it was not just these qualities that endeared Ted Kennedy to figures of all political persuasions. It was the seriousness and good faith with which he approached ideas that differed from his own. In 1983, this liberal Catholic from Massachusetts traveled to the conservative Liberty Baptist College in Virginia where he told the students: The more our feelings diverge, the more deeply felt they are, the greater is our obligation to grant the sincerity and essential decency of our fellow citizens on the other side. Ted Kennedy lived out that sentiment every day. We salute his ability to work across party lines to achieve consensus, to work on a piece of legislation until doubters became enthusiastic supporters. He excelled in transforming nays to yeas. Senator Kennedy was a master of our own specialized world, and his legislative legacy stands with those of the giants of this Chamber. He tackled what some see as the great game of politics with gusto. But Ted Kennedy's life's work was not a game. Politics was not a contest staged for its own sake or in pursuit of power or prestige. Ted Kennedy was a master not of the politics of the moment but of the politics of meaning. Ted Kennedy's task was to touch lives. He touched the family whose children have health insurance because of the Children's Health Insurance Program he helped establish; the child who has a better chance at an education because of his work on the No Child Left Behind law. More Americans can fully participate in our democracy because of the civil rights and voting rights legislation he pushed forward. We saw Ted Kennedy's passion for justice, tolerance, and understanding again recently when we were working on the Matthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention legislation. I quoted him during that debate on that legislation when the defense authorization bill was on the floor, and I quote him again now. He said: We want to be able to have a value system that is worthy for our brave men and women to defend. They are fighting overseas for our values. One of the values is, we should not, in this country, in this democracy, permit the kind of hatred and bigotry that has stained the history of this Nation over a considerable period of time. The children of our men and women in uniform have some of the best child care available, thanks to the National Military Child Care Act Ted Kennedy championed in 1989. He was actively involved more recently following the outrages at Walter Reed Army Medical Center when we passed the wounded warrior legislation in 2008. The lesson of Ted Kennedy's life and career is that politics at its best is not a game to be refereed by TV pundits. It is not a contest of poll numbers or a scorecard of grievances to nurse and favors to return. Senator Kennedy struck many deals. He brokered many compromises. He won many votes. But the true majesty of his career is not to be found in this Chamber, though his work was done here. His lesson for us is that democracy is best understood in the homes and lives of its citizens. It is in the homes of families less burdened by want. It is in the minds of children freed by education. It is in the relief of parents who no longer fear for a child in need of medical care. It is in the souls of Americans who find inspiration in his triumph over tragedy and over his own shortcomings. It is in the hearts of the colleagues he leaves behind who will be inspired to rededicate ourselves to a politics that recognizes our common humanity and seeks common ground in the pursuit of justice. My wife Barbara and I will always keep in our hearts Vicki, the love of Ted's life, and we will always remember Ted's love affair with the American people. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip. Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, there was a historic moment on Capitol Hill last night. The President of the United States asked for a joint session of Congress to address one of the most important and controversial issues of our time. Emotions were running high in the House Chamber as Members of the House and Senate gathered to hear the President. We know they ran high because there were expressions of support and disapproval during the President's speech. I sat with Harry Reid and other leaders from the Democratic side in the Senate and watched carefully as the speech unfolded. I thought the President was at his best, even under fire, with the high emotions in the Chamber. I wondered what the ending would be and how it would be received. If Members will recall, at the end of the speech, the President referred to a letter that had been sent to him by the late Senator Ted Kennedy to be read after the Senator had passed away. As the President referred to that letter, an amazing thing happened in that Chamber filled with hundreds and hundreds of people. The emotions quieted down. At one point, one could have heard a pin drop in the House Chamber as President Obama recalled the legacy and the promise of the life of Senator Edward Kennedy. I came today to this seat on the Senate floor. It is not my ordinary desk, but it is the row where I sat for a number of years as a new Member of the Senate. It was a particularly good assignment to sit in this row because behind me was Paul Wellstone and then Ted Kennedy. One never had any better back-benchers than those two men. Now they are both gone. As I reflect on the absence, particularly of Senator Kennedy, I recall for history his first speech on the floor of the Senate. It was April 9, 1964. Here is the amazing fact: This speech took place 16 months after he took his Senate seat. That booming voice and presence, which was so dominant in the Senate for decades, waited patiently for his turn, 16 months after the special election in Massachusetts that gave him the Senate seat once held by his brother John. When he rose to make his first speech on April 9, 1964, he said he planned ``to address issues affecting the industry and employment in my home state [of Massachusetts],'' a thoughtful decision by someone recently elected, to make sure that your first speech touches issues important to the friends at home. He said he would make that speech one day. But he decided his first speech would be much different. On that day, with his first speech, conscience and the cause of freedom compelled Ted Kennedy to speak instead in eloquent support of the bill the Senate was then debating. It was a measure President Kennedy proposed nearly a year earlier. Now, less than 5 months after that terrible day in Dallas, TX, when his brother was assassinated, the youngest Kennedy brother stood at the same desk his brother John had used when he served the Senate, the same desk Ted Kennedy used for the nearly 47 years he served in the Senate. He presented more than a dozen letters he had received from religious leaders all urging Congress to pass the Civil Rights Act and end the evil of segregation in America. That was Ted Kennedy's first speech in the Senate. He said: When religious leaders call on us to urge passage of this bill, they are not mixing religion and politics. This is not a political issue. It is a moral issue to be resolved through political means. He continued: Religious leaders can preach, they can advise, they can lead movements of social action. But there comes a moment when persuasion must be backed up by law to be effective. In the field of civil rights, that point has been reached. He concluded by saying: My brother was the first President of the United States to say publicly that segregation was morally wrong. His heart and soul are in this bill. If his life and death had a meaning, it was that we should not hate but love one another; we should use our powers not to create conditions of oppression that lead to violence, but conditions of freedom that lead to peace. It is in that spirit that I hope the Senate will pass this bill. That first speech by Ted Kennedy bore so many of the qualities that would define his public career. The moral courage to take on the most urgent moral question of his time no matter how controversial, the determination to pick up his brother's fallen standard, the prodigious amount of work behind the scenes building alliances, and an optimist's unshakable faith that his beloved America would become an even more just and decent Nation. Listening to Senator Kennedy's speech that day were some of the giants of the Senate--Hubert Humphrey, a man who more than anyone brought me to public life when he allowed me to serve as an intern in his Senate office. The first to speak was a man whom I would come to know well, Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois. He said: I have never heard an address of a more truly noble and elevated tone. He called the young Senator from Massachusetts: A worthy continuer of the great traditions of the seat which he occupies in the Senate, beginning, I believe, with John Quincy Adams, Daniel Webster and Charles Sumner and through ... to his beloved and lamented brother ... Senator Wayne Morse stood to speak as well, and he made a prediction on the first day Ted Kennedy spoke in this Chamber. He said: [I]n my judgment, the junior Senator from Massachusetts has already demonstrated that before he leaves the U.S. Senate, he will have made a record in this body that will list him among the great Senators in the history of the Senate. That prediction was made 45 years ago by Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon. Edward Moore Kennedy was one of the greatest Senators not only of our time but of all time. There was no better advocate and no more determined fighter for civil rights and human rights. He was a son of privilege, but he was a man, despite that background, who identified with the poor and the dispossessed and the voiceless in America. His fingerprints can be found on significant legislation of the last half century: health care, voting rights, women's rights, gay rights, immigration reform, worker safety, fair housing, consumer protection, campaign finance reform, sensible gun laws, national service, minimum wage--the list goes on and on. He was a protector of the vulnerable--of widows and orphans, the wounded and maimed, the grieving and dispossessed. He was a champion of people with disabilities. He believed we should all be judged by what we can do, not by what we cannot do. When I was asked by my local media in Illinois, after Ted Kennedy's passing, if there was something about him that I knew that other people did not know, I said there was one thing most people did not know. As a result of an airplane crash early in his Senate career, when his broken body was dragged out of the plane by his Senate colleague, Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana, whose son now se"
